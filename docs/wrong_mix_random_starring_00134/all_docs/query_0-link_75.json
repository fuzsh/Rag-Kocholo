Kanwischer offers suggestions about drinking and driving.\n\n[audio:siudrinkdrive2.mp3]Word from Kanwischer[/audio]\n\nKanwischer says eating helps absorb the alcohol, especially foods such as cheese and crackers.

It now accounts for 65% of all U.S. corn acres. The grain ends up in thousands of everyday foods such as cereal, sweeteners and cooking oil.\n\nBut over the last few summers, rootworms have feasted on the roots of Bt corn in parts of 4 states. That suggests some of the insects are becoming resistant.\n\nCorn Growers Support Subsidy Expiration\n\nThe ethanol subsidy is expiring at the end of the year and Tricia Braid, with the Illinois Corn Growers Association, says that could mean higher prices at the pump.\n\n[audio:rddBraid1.mp3]A Word From Braid[/audio]\n\nBraid says the expiration creates a bit of uncertainty and that four point four cent incentive will likely be passed on to consumers.

Braid says the oil industry also receives tax incentives but has stepped up to do their part to help bring the nation's economy back on track.\n\nADM Donates Money To African Girls School\n\nA leading Central Illinois Agricultural processor is reaching out to help girls in the Ivory Coast.

Dr. Vic Zimmerman, Superintendent of the Monticello School District explains the buildings they are currently using are very old, but well kept. He says the school Board of Education is considering what the future could hold for renovations of those buildings, or even, new buildings.\n\n[audio:monticellofacilities1.mp3]Dr. Zimmerman On Monticello Looking To Future[/audio]\n\nDr. Zimmerman feels instead of just looking into renovating the current buildings, he would like to think a little bigger. But he says anything and everything is currently on the table. Right now they are just trying to figure where they stand with their current situation.\n\n[audio:monticellofacilities2.mp3]Dr. Zimmerman On Current Process[/audio]\n\nThe school is operating 5 buildings currently, which breaks down to about 2 grades per building. Dr. Zimmerman feels combining school buildings is something he would like to have considered, although he is open to hearing out all the options first.\n\n[audio:monticellofacilities3.mp3]Dr. Zimmerman's Thoughts On Combining Buildings[/audio]\n\nAll these plans and ideas are very early on in the development stage. Dr. Zimmerman stresses right now the district is just exploring options for the future. No decisions have been made, and they are not at the decision making stage yet either. He feels it could be about 8-10 years off before anything is a reality.\n\nLincoln Seeks To Find Lower Electric Rates\n\nA recent piece of legislation that allows communities to receive lower electric rates from providers all over the country is being taken advantage of by a local community.\n\nThe City of Lincoln has been investigating into what is called \"Electric Agrigation.\" Lincoln Mayor Keith Snyder explains the issue goes to referendum first, if approved by the voters, the city would hire a company to go out and acquire bids from electric companies to provide those in the city with electricity, and those in the city can chose to be or not to be a part of the program.\n\n[audio:electricagrigation1.mp3]Mayor Snyder On Program[/audio]\n\nThe major advantage to the city of Lincoln would be providing residents with more options for their electric rates. Snyder notes things may shake out so the city has several options on how they want their electricity provided as well to be more environmentally friendly. He adds several other towns in Logan County have adopted the referendum as well.\n\n[audio:electricagrigation2.mp3]A Word From Mayor Snyder[/audio]\n\nAccording to Snyder, electric rates are currently low. He says the rates they would receive back hinge on what the electric markets do, which could be the one downside to Lincoln being a part of the program.\n\n[audio:electricagrigation3.mp3]Snyder On Electric Rates[/audio]\n\nThe contract the city could enter into can be a short term contract or a long term contract. Snyder says if the city inters into a shorter contract, their rates most likely would be lower, but the longer their contract is the higher the rates would most likely be.\n\n[audio:electricagrigation4.mp3]A Word From Snyder On Contract Options[/audio]\n\nShould the referendum pass, the city will enter into an original contract. After the first contract expires they could then go out for bids again through a company to get rates for them, in hopes of finding lower rates. Snyder says this ensures they do not pay more than what their local provider would offer, which for Lincoln is Ameren.\n\nBears, Rams Notes\n\n>>Bears Give Williams Two-Year Extension\n\n(Lake Forest, IL) -- The Chicago Bears have signed offensive lineman Edwin Williams to a two-year contract extension.

That leaves some Illinoisans wondering whether the state got duped into giving the company a major tax break to keep jobs in the state. David Vite, with the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, says the store closures have nothing to do with the recent tax deal.\n\n[audio:rddDuped1.mp3]Word from Vite[/audio]\n\nVite says it's important to remember that the 100 store closures will likely be spread across the nation, not just in Illinois. Plus, he says Sears has to live up to its end of the bargain before receiving any money from the state. The company is required to invest more than 300-million dollars into its corporate headquarters in order to get the 150-million from the state.\n\nWinter Activities for Miller Park Zoo\n\nThere are many exciting events coming up this winter season at Miller Park Zoo.\n\nThe popular Bloomington zoo is gearing up for several fun events and changes in the coming weeks.

Susan Wilson, Superintendent of the Blue Ridge School district explains the total cost of the project will be a little more than $8-million after some Health/Life Safety issues are addressed.\n\n[audio:blueridgereferendum1.mp3]Wilson On Total Cost of Project[/audio]\n\nAccording to Wilson, the cost of the Health/Life Safety items do not have to be taken care of prior to the building being built, but she feels taking care of them as a part of the current bond would be better than in another year or two coming back and asking the voters to approve more bonds. The Health/Life Safety items are replacement of the roof, remove the chimney, replace the boiler and hot water system and replace the septic system.\n\n[audio:blueridgereferendum2.mp3]Wilson On Health/Life Safety Items[/audio]\n\nWilson explains the district has overcome a lot of financial hardships in the past and built up a nice reserve of savings. She says those savings are now paying off to various areas of the project that they can help fund. Wilson stresses the Board of Education is working to be responsible with the money they have.\n\n[audio:blueridgereferendum3.mp3]A Word From Wilson[/audio]\n\nThe Blue Ridge Board of Education's projected bond and interest rate they are asking to issue are .51 cents. The current rate is .45 cents, which would translate into about a $20 increase for a $100-thousand home per year. Wilson says for those who pay taxes through their mortgages, it would be an increase of about $1.67 per month to their house payment.\n\nAt the school's website, blueridge18.org, there is a link to a site where Blue Ridge residents can keep tabs on the progress of the project, and Wilson says they work to keep it updated as much as possible.\n\nOne Day Electronic Recycling Event Tomorrow in Monticello\n\nNow that Santa has brought you the latest Apple Product or flat screen TV, what are you going to do with the old electronics left laying around the house?\n\nThe Piatt County Soil and Water Conservation District is giving folks the opportunity to have those electronic items disposed of properly. Jonathon Manuel, Resource Conservationist with the SWCD explains they will be accepting electronic items all kinds all day Wednesday.\n\n[audio:electronicrecycling1.mp3]A Word From Manuel[/audio]\n\nThe program is nothing new to Piatt County. Manuel explains before they began offering electronic recycling, his department would find various electronic items discarded on the side of country roads and highways. He feels having this program around has cut back a great deal on that.\n\n[audio:electronicrecycling2.mp3]A Word From Manuel[/audio]\n\nFor those with older computers or cell phones that potentially could have information they do not want reproduced, Manuel explains all items are well taken care. He explains from the time the trailer door is open upon it's arrival in the Chicago area to it being discarded, the process is filmed and those items are wiped out with government software.\n\n[audio:electronicrecycling3.mp3]A Word From Manuel[/audio]\n\nIn the past, the program has sought donations to refund the gas expenses a volunteer who is donating his time and equipment to haul the electronics to and from. Manuel explains last year they had more than plenty to reimburse him, however, this year they have a suggested donation price for some items.\n\n[audio:electronicrecycling4.mp3]A Word From Manuel[/audio]\n\nThe collections takes place at the Monticello USDA parking lot, just off Route 105 on the south side of Monticello. The collection takes place tomorrow (WED) from 8 am to 4 pm.

He says he has to make the best decisions for all of the people in Illinois. Not just Catholics.\n\nCentral IL Human Services Office to Consolidate\n\nA central Illinois department of human services is set to close Tuesday, despite objections from officials in Fayette County.\n\nThe county's Department of Human Services office in Vandalia will be consolidated about 30 miles away to an office in Centralia.\n\nState officials say it's a way to increase efficiency, cut costs and that the move won't reduce services. They also say there are few reasons to physically come to an office.\n\nHowever, Vandalia Mayor Ricky Gottman says he is concerned about those who rely on public transportation and employees having to commute from locations throughout the county.\n\nState officials say the closure is part of Gov. Pat Quinn's efforts to cut costs.\n\nIllinois to Create an Independent Tax Tribunal\n\nTax breaks for Sears and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange got the most publicity out of legislation Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn signed last week.\n\nBut the measure also includes a requirement that by 2013, the state have an independent body to hear tax protests.\n\nMore than two dozen states have adopted the so-called \"tax tribunals.\" But the fact Illinois does not was a major reason a national tax association gave the state a \"D'' for fairness and efficiency last year.\n\nSen. Toi Hutchinson is an Olympia Fields Democrat and sponsor of the bill.

Board Chair Melonie Tilley says the question posed to voters will seek a levy not to exceed point-25-percent of a property's Equalized Assessed Valuation, or EAV.\n\n[audio:ambulanceref1.mp3]Melonie Tilley[/audio]\n\nNot every resident in the county will see the measure on the March ballot. Finance Committee Chair Ed Young explains some areas of DeWitt County are already taxed for ambulance service, and thus can not be \"double taxed.\"\n\n[audio:ambulanceref2.mp3]Ed Young[/audio]\n\nDespite the referendum resolution being approved by an 8 to 2 vote, there are still several questions concerning the future of ambulance service within the county. Young admits that there are few answers at this point.\n\n[audio:ambulanceref3.mp3]Ed Young[/audio]\n\nMuch of DeWitt County is currently served by the Dr. John Warner Hospital ambulance service, however the hospital announced earlier this year that they plan to halt the service at the end of 2012. County and City of Clinton officials are looking to implement a funding source for a potential service before that cutoff.\n\nIn other business Thursday night, the DeWitt County Board...\n\n> approved the appointment of Clinton resident Scott Nimmo (Nim-mo) to the Board in the seat formerly held by Dennis Rich.\n\n> approved the purchase of a new squad car for the Sheriff's Department to replace a vehicle that was totaled in a recent traffic accident.\n\nAnother Official Resigns In Central Illinois Village\n\nAnother official has resigned in Sparland, leaving the central Illinois village board with no quorum.\n\nThe departure of trustee Kenneth Crew brings to six the number of officials who have resigned in the last few days.\n\nCrew submitted his resignation Monday.\n\nThe other officials are: Mayor Linda Medearis, Village Clerk Susan Persinger, Treasurer Margo Danger-Smith, and trustees Louis Lenz and Ralph McCasky.\n\nTrustee Mike Durham says the first five resignation letters were found over the weekend \"in a neat pile\" at Village Hall.\n\nThe resignations are effective different times this week and last week.\n\nUS EPA Stepping Up Enforcement In On-Farm Fuel Storage\n\nIt seems agriculture continues to be hit on all sides with new regulations, and one area the U.S. EPA appears to be stepping up enforcement is on-farm fuel storage.

Superintendent of Clinton Schools Dr. Jeff Holmes explains the question on the referendum includes not only issuing the bonds, but also bringing down the other elementary buildings, and making necessary improvements to the high school facility.\n\n[audio:schoolreferendum1.mp3]A Word From Dr. Holmes[/audio]\n\nThe bonds the district will be issuing could be paid off in a maximum of 19-years, however, Dr. Holmes says with the value of the Clinton school district property rising like it has in the past, the time it takes to pay the bonds off will decrease. He points to the Clinton Jr. High School building, which he stresses has been paid off for nearly four years now.\n\n[audio:schoolreferendum2.mp3]A Word From Dr. Holmes[/audio]\n\nDr. Holmes feels this new facility is about maximizing the students of the districts education. He connects the districts drive to continue it's technological push and having a building that can make that possible.\n\n[audio:schoolreferendum3.mp3]A Word From Dr. Holmes[/audio]\n\nDr. Holmes continues to stress through this process, the bonds they are proposing to issue will not raise the tax rate of those property owners in the school district.\n\nThe Board of Education has assembled a referendum campaign team to reach out to the community to raise awareness about the bonds being issued. Regional Radio News will have more on the campaign team tomorrow.\n\nCubs, Cards Notes\n\n>>Cubs Wheel And Deal On Wednesday\n\n(Chicago, IL) -- The Cubs reportedly have a deal in place to acquire left-handed starting pitcher Travis Wood and two minor-leaguers from the Cincinnati Reds for lefty reliever Sean Marshall.

ISU spokesman Jay Groves says it's a partnership that dates back 40 years and he said it helps the institution's goals. He adds it's a common occurrence for public universities to partner with private groups, noting that the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois and Northern Illinois universities have similar arrangements. The light is being shined on the issue as lawmakers tackle massive loopholes and underfunding within the state's pension systems. Groves says the real problem with the pension system is that the state has not funded it appropriately for about 30 years and has taken money from it without paying it back.\n\nPolice: It Appears Mother Killed Family\n\nAutopsy results from the five victims in the Emington shooting are now available.
