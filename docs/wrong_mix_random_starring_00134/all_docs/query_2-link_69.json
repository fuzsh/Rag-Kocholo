This repository is approved to bank both CNS tissues from patients with neurodegenerative diseases as well as normal controls. Since 2016, the CBB has about 165 donations. These include individuals who died with Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) and other Lewy body diseases (LBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multisystem atrophy (MSA), frontotemporal dementia (FTD-TDP), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS), along with people who died without known neurological diseases. My research has been to bank and distribute tissues. I also pathologically characterize these donations in significant anatomic detail, to determine the patterns of neuroanatomic degeneration. I have recently focused on autopsies with mixed pathological changes, which increase in aging but can also be present in younger individuals. I have a significant collaboration with Dr. Peter Stys, who has been doing spectral analysis of the different forms of amyloid-like proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. My clinical research also includes working with clinicians on various reports that require pathology.\n\nprofiles.ucalgary.ca/jeffrey-t-joseph\n\nProfessor\n\nDepartments of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine and Physiology & Pharmacology\n\nFoothills Medical Centre-McCaig Tower\n\nphone: 403.944.8541\n\nemail: mmkelly@ucalgary.ca\n\nDr Margaret Kelly is a Professor with full Tenure and a Clinician-Scientist in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary.
