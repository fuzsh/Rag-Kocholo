        "text": "I am a certified EcoWisdom Nature and Forest Therapy Guide who was very fortunate to grow up camping. This instilled in me a love of the outdoors. Being outside soothes my soul and rejuvenates me. I am honoured and humbled to have received the first Nancy Lear Scholarship offered by EcoWisdom and the Lear Family. Nancy was a powerful advocate within the disabled community who was instrumental in promoting the use of EcoWisdom’s nature programs as a form of peer support.\n\nEcoWisdom’s philosophy of making nature experiences accessible to everyone really resonates with me as someone with a lifelong disability. As someone who works with non-profit organizations that serve and are led by people with disabilities, I appreciate EcoWisdom’s approach that values expertise based on lived experience. I look forward to sharing my love of nature by continuing to co-facilitate online and in-person Accessible Nature Wellbeing Programs. I am excited to contribute to growing our EcoWisdom Community by becoming a mentor to support Nature and Forest Therapy Guides in training.\n\nImage Description\n\nLaurette, a smiling white person, looks at the camera as she walks on a trail using an upright walker. She is surrounded by thick greenery with black rocks, evergreen trees, blue sky and the ocean in the background.\n\nI (Kari, she/her) grew up playing with crayfish barefoot in creeks and running through grassy fields on my family’s organic farm. I am privileged to be able to live in-tune with nature once again on the EcoWisdom Forest Preserve after decades of urban dwelling.\n\nI bring a robust set of professional trainings along with unique personal experiences to my contemplative forest bathing programming which I have offered in places such as urban greenspaces, forest preserves, retreat centres and online. My programming, offered in collaboration with co-facilitators, weaves together a foundational knowledge in neuroscience, psychology and mindfulness with a commitment to inclusion, compassion, community building and sustainability.\n\nI am fascinated by the research in the field of forest medicine and have had personal experiences of deep healing and symptom management using mindfulness, meditation and forest bathing/ shinrin-yoku. I am deeply appreciative of all the opportunities I have had to connect with others who are interested in exploring nature’s profound gifts and fostering our commitments to caring for the earth and all her beings.\n\nLife Highlights:\n\nReceiving the Royal Society of Canada Alice Wilson Award for Academic Excellence (female emergent scholar)\n\nRepresenting Canada at WHO Disability Policy Development Congress\n\nForming a biracial family and adopting our wonderful daughter\n\nTaking my first steps with my physiotherapist after three years in a wheelchair\n\nExperiencing nature’s healing properties with measured neurological improvements\n\nGoing on silent retreat in nature for five years & then creating EcoWisdom with my partner Dave\n\nLiving off-grid on the EcoWisdom Forest Preserve (since March 2020)\n\nProfessional Training/Positions\n\nSenior Research Fellow with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research\n\nUniversity Professor in Critical Disability Studies\n\nPost-Doctoral Fellowship with the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council\n\nDoctoral Internship, Neurology, Hospital for Sick Children\n\nCommunity Development & Qualitative Research Consultant\n\nPhD Human Development and Applied Psychology\n\nMA Instruction and Special Education\n\nBSc Environmental Studies\n\nSupplementary Certifications\n\nNature and Forest Therapy Guide (6 months)\n\nInterfaith Spiritual Accompaniment, Ontario Jubilee (2 years)\n\nMindfulness Meditation Teacher, MMTCP Brach/Kornfield (2 years)\n\nImage description: Headshot of Kari, a smiling white person looking at the camera, while leaning\n\nagainst a tree trunk outdoors, with evergreen trees and snow in the background.

I’ve spent decades using my bicycle to explore, travel and commute to work (even in winter) which gave me an intimate view of urban life while enjoying my explorations of urban green spaces.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be introduced to camping and canoeing as a youth and have continued to paddle each year with friends for companionship, exercise and the wide-ranging benefit of slow time in nature. During my 30 years of teaching High School, my life was enriched by the enthusiasm, integrity, commitment and positive outlook of students. It has been a great privilege to work with hundreds of young people ready and excited to take action for a more sustainable and just planet.\n\nI am currently working seasonally as Course Director (Math and Science) at The Boundless School and I am also a Lead Steward at the Middle Mill site for Toronto Nature Stewards.\n\nI look forward to continuing to be an active steward of the EcoWisdom Forest Preserve, habitat to wolves, bear, moose, deer and lynx.

She developed complicated and life-changing post-infection conditions including Long Covid, POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), and Chronic Migraines. These health issues forced her to leave her role running a community project in inner-city London and reimagine her life.\n\nHarriet felt a longing to be in nature, but the physical limitations associated with her illnesses and concerns about reinfection made most nearby urban green spaces inaccessible to her. After training as an Integrative Forest Therapy Practitioner (in a modified manner), she has gone on to run online Forest Bathing sessions for people with Long Covid. She has discovered that you do not need to hike in wilderness areas to feel connected to the natural world. Taking an intentionally mindful approach to watching a snail on a leaf or following clouds moving across the sky can be powerful experiences.\n\nShe is a passionate advocate of the Social Model of Disability commonly used in Disability Studies and has experience making programs inclusive for herself and others through appropriate accommodations. You can find out more about Harriet and her work through her website www.kindredsoil.co.uk. Harriet is thrilled to join the EcoWisdom team and very excited about their unique approach which includes a deep commitment to inclusion, equity, and accessibility.\n\nImage description: Headshot of Harriet, a white person facing the camera with a big smile, in\n\nfront of a forested background with green trees.

This deep connection led me to study Biology and Environmental Studies, allowing me to work as a naturalist in parks across Canada, and as a high school science teacher. As a lifelong learner, I have received additional teaching qualifications in the social sciences and Indigenous Issues. I have also completed an MA in theology/spirituality and a diploma in spiritual companioning from University of Toronto, as well as a certificate in Expressive Arts from Fleming College. Retirement allows me time to enjoy reading, piano and art, to volunteer with a citizen’s climate action group, and as an online responder with a crisis text line.
