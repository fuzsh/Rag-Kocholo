        "text": "Professor McKay’s research program investigates health promotion and chronic disease prevention strategies to enhance health at key time points: childhood, adolescence and later life.\n\nHer research evaluates the positive role of physical activity, other lifestyle factors and the built environment on children’s health and older adult physical health, mobility and social connectedness. Through an implementation science lens, she also evaluates scale-up of effective interventions as a means to improve health on a population level. Her work has directly influenced government policy.\n\nProfessor McKay is well known for building interdisciplinary teams and connecting with community partners to move research findings into action (knowledge mobilization). She has been in receipt of grants to support these teams, valued at more than $70M. She led the team that was awarded $40M from Canada Foundation for Innovations, donors and government to build the Centre for Hip Health and Mobility (inaugural Director; 2006-16). Professor McKay was recently inducted as a Fellow into the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. Her ability to meaningfully engage stakeholders, including government, to take upstream action to improve health was acknowledged through a Knowledge Translation Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and a BC Woman of Distinction Award for Health & Active Living.\n\nJoanie Sims Gould is a Clinical Associate Professor in the Department of Family Practice at the University of British Columbia. She is a Canadian Institutes of Health Research New Investigator and a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Scholar.\n\nSims Gould is a dedicated sex and gender health researcher who applies novel methodological and engagement approaches to understanding broad public health concerns, particularly those related to older adults and “adding life to years”. She works with diverse stakeholders to ensure that her research is inclusive and reflects real needs (and questions). With her strong commitment to knowledge mobilization, Sims Gould ensures that her research findings are ‘brought back’ to stakeholders in the public sphere using dynamic and engaging knowledge translation tools, such as film.\n\nSims Gould is directly involved and currently leads several research projects focused on the intersection between older adult health, socio-economic status, culture, mobility and gender.\n\nAt present, she is a Co-PI on a CIHR-funded team grant entitled “Shape the Path: Targeting the Health and Mobility Needs of Older Men through Key Community Partnerships” and Principal Investigator on a CIHR Project Grant entitled: “Choose to Move: Impact and Implementation Evaluation of a Program to Enhance Older Adult Physical Activity, Mobility and Health”. She is Co-PI on a MSFHR implementation science team entitled “Scaling out: implementation of a health promotion model for older adults in small urban, rural and remote regions of BC”. She is a Principal Scientist for the Active Aging Research Team and Project co-Lead for Active Aging British Columbia.\n\nSims Gould holds degrees in Biology (BSc), Gerontology (BA), and Social Work (BSW & MSW) and an interdisciplinary PhD. She also received post-doctoral training and work experience in two distinct settings – UBC’s Department of Sociology and the Centre for Hip Health and Mobility (CHHM) at Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute with Dr. Karim Khan (Scientific Director of IMHA, CIHR). Sims Gould was recognized for her scholarship with a Canadian Institutes of Health Research New Investigator award and a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research Scholar award. This diversity of experience across disciplines and professions and in collaboration with many community stakeholders has uniquely positioned her to address multi-faceted issues in aging and health with a focus on sex and gender.\n\nDr. Dawn Mackey is passionate about helping older adults to maintain mobility and independence. In her Aging and Population Health Lab (APHL) at Simon Fraser University, Dr. Mackey and her team are focused on designing, evaluating, and implementing effective strategies to support older adult mobility and health behavior change. Her current areas of concentration are physical activity, falls and injuries, and fatigability.\n\nDr. Mackey’s research with older adults spans community to long-term care settings. Her work is applied in nature and solutions focused. Her research is embedded in a knowledge exchange framework that supports translation of insights into actions. As such, she engages with stakeholders to design, conduct, and disseminate research to ensure impact.\n\nDr. Mackey received her BSc Honours and MSc in Kinesiology from Simon Fraser University. She received her PhD in Epidemiology from the University of California, Berkeley, and she continued her training in Epidemiology through a post-doctoral fellowship at the San Francisco Coordinating Centre at the University of California, San Francisco. Now as a faculty member, she is committed to providing outstanding mentorship to her trainees.\n\nDr. Mackey’s research incorporates methods and techniques from epidemiology, biostatistics, knowledge translation, and implementation science. These include clinical trials, feasibility and proof-of-concept studies, longitudinal cohort studies, causal inference, laboratory experiments, qualitative inquiries, knowledge synthesis, meta-analysis, and formative evaluation.\n\nRebecca is a values-driven health and social development communications practitioner. She has almost a decade of experience working to improve the health and well-being of both Canadians and people around the world through strategic communications and fundraising.\n\nRebecca is motivated by the truth that all people are universally entitled to health, justice, and dignity. Rebecca enjoys finding ways to dynamically share stories about the work of the Active Aging Research Team with the public and key stakeholders. In addition to her role with the Active Aging Research Team, Rebecca is a fundraising and communications consultant for a variety of international health and development NGOs.\n\nRebecca moonlights as an opera singer. She has performed with the Vancouver Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, and other opera companies, choirs, and orchestras across the country. In addition to her degree in Corporate Communications Management, Rebecca has achieved her Master’s in Music from the University of Toronto. She made her professional debut at age 6 on Sesame Street Canada.\n\nIn her spare time, Rebecca keeps active and socially connected by running on the sea wall, playing soccer, and taking her beloved pups Boy George and Matzie to the local dog park.\n\nDr. Thea Franke is a Research Associate with the University of British Columbia's Active Aging Research Team (AART). She earned her Honors B.A. Specialist in Sociology from the University of Toronto, followed by a Master's in Family Studies and Gerontology from Mount Saint Vincent University, culminating in a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Studies from UBC. Her doctoral research provided valuable insights into the physical activity, mobility, and social connections of older adults within their built and social environments, employing innovative methods such as accelerometry and GPS monitoring systems over a four-year study period.\n\nOver the last five years, Dr. Franke has directed her expertise toward mitigating modifiable risk factors such as physical inactivity, loneliness, and social isolation among older adults. She has been instrumental in the design, implementation, and scale-up of Choose to Move, an evidence-based, health-promoting intervention aimed at enhancing the physical and social wellbeing of older adults across community settings. In her current position, Dr. Franke is spearheading the development and testing of an implementation strategy intervention to bolster organizational capacity, thereby facilitating broader adoption and implementation of Choose to Move throughout British Columbia.\n\nDr. Franke excels in the formation and leadership of interdisciplinary teams and oversees operational accounting, including salaries, expense tracking, and reporting, as well as grant compliance for AART's team grants. Her dedication to improving the quality of life for older adults through practical, evidence-based initiatives underscores her significant contributions to the field of implementation science.\n\nDr. Laura Churchill is a Physiotherapist and Research Associate with the Active Aging Research team at University of British Columbia. Laura completed a MSc and a combined MPT (Master of Physical Therapy) and PhD at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. Her PhD research focused on the development and evaluation of resources to improve the quality of care for individuals with knee osteoarthritis. Most recently, Laura completed a post-doctoral fellowship in the Physical Therapy Program at the University of Colorado with Dr. Jennifer Stevens-Lapsley, where she studied evidence based and technology-enabled solutions for older adults and individuals undergoing total knee replacement. Since 2017, Laura has also practiced clinically as a physiotherapist (with a focus on sport medicine), helping athletes and active community members get back to doing what they love.\n\nWith the Active Aging Research Team, Laura combines her clinical and research experience to adapt the Choose to Move program to clinical populations including those with hip and knee osteoarthritis.\n\nDouglas serves as the Senior Program and Evaluation Coordinator for the Active Aging Research Team at UBC. His early fervour for health and fitness impelled him to pursue a Master’s Degree in Physical and Health Education from the University of Victoria. Douglas is motivated by a commitment to fostering lifelong health-promoting behaviours among individuals, with the aim of enhancing health and mobility across all stages of life, irrespective of factors such as age, race, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, disability status, sexual orientation, or geographic location. Douglas is currently working closely with partner organizations and activity coaches to ensure the successful implementation of Choose to Move throughout the province.\n\nBeyond the confines of his professional responsibilities, Douglas can often be found running in forested areas, honing his skills for upcoming trail races, or enjoying camping and travel adventures in the company of his wife and dog."
