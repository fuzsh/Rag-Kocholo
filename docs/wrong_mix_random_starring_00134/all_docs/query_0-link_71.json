        "text": "I support multidisciplinary teams at the intersection of high tech and health care. From 2006 to 2019, I've lived, learned and worked with entrepreneurs, investors, universities, and corporations in Silicon Valley. I am now back in Europe, as the founder and managing partner of Nina Capital, to invest in this sector alongside a stellar international team.\n\nSectors and Focus:\n\nI am especially committed to innovation in information technology / digital health, and have broader expertise in health technology and medical devices with emphasis on needs and markets identification, product management, regulation (FDA Class I-II), fundraising and growth strategies of early-stage companies.\n\nPersonality:\n\nI have a bias towards entrepreneurs and an appetite for continuous learning. Leveraging my technology and business domain expertise, I have the most fun while mentoring young professionals and contributing to the building of products and companies. I thrive in unstructured environments, where the risks are high and success hinges on creative people with high ethical standards to self-organize and work together towards solving a compelling health care need.\n\nPhilosophy and Goals:\n\nI believe in a culture of collaboration and giving, and in the ripple effect in all aspects of life or business. Keeping my values close and my loved ones even closer, I am moved by a desire to make positive impact and serve a community of health tech innovators, so that their inspiring ideas become solutions that matter in the hands of those who need them the most.\n\nBackground:\n\nI have held roles with vastly different organizations in Europe, Canada and the United States, and developed my operational and creative abilities by contributing to, establishing and growing businesses.\n\nManaging partner, president and co-founder at Asabys.

The son of a Swiss mother and a Catalan father, I grew up watching my family build a successful entrepreneurial venture in the textile industry and attending the Escuela Suiza, a local Swiss school and one of the oldest international schools in Barcelona, as a kid.\n\nSpeaking several languages and traveling was a gift that opened my eyes to the global world. After studying Economics in Barcelona and in The Netherlands, I pursued an MBA at IESE Business School. The entrepreneurship class awakened my entrepreneurial spirit and led me to co-found Advance Medical.\n\nStarting and growing Advance Medical, which eventually became a pioneering and multinational telehealth company, was a fascinating life experience. For 20 years, my co-founder and I established operations in more than ten countries with a global workforce of over one thousand workers to help tens of thousands of patients every day around the world.\n\nWhen Advance Medical was acquired by US-based TELADOC, I was ready to move forward to new challenges. One meeting with Marta during one of her first trips from California to Spain was enough to understand that Nina Capital was exactly the next thing I wanted to do: build a Venture Capital firm based in my city, Barcelona, and ready to support European need-driven founders building health tech companies with international ambitions.\n\nThat this remarkable concurrence of events--her first landing in Barcelona, my exiting Advance Medical after an adventure two decades long--occurred without apparent causal connection is yet more proof that so much of life is about timing, and is one the ingredients that makes Nina Capital’s origin story special.\n\nI am a genetic cocktail of Norwegian and Cypriot DNA raised in an international environment, which precipitated into what some call a “third culture” identity; a blend of contradiction with Mediterranean and Nordic culture. Barcelona is my latest home and I could not have picked a better place to feed my insatiable appetite for the ocean, paddle boarding in the summers and surfing in the winters (yes, you can surf here on a weekly basis), and generally anything outdoors with some adrenaline sprinkled on top; a couple of hours drive to the Pyrenees for hiking in the summers and skiing in the winters.\n\nI also love music, with a near-criminal collection of obscure instruments from all over the world. I do play on occasion; piano, guitar and trumpet are my forte, with a particular interest in playing jazz and funk. You are just as likely to find me at the Palau de la Música enjoying the works of Chopin, to a Black Keys concert, to a dingy jazz “hole-in-the-wall”, to a Joris Voorn event.\n\nA fascination with what makes us tick led me to study neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh with a focus on the biological basis of cognition and memory. I loved Edinburgh so much I stayed to pursue a masters in innovation and management focused on the bioeconomy as a segway into the healthcare innovation space. I ended up, after a stumble or two, at UCL in London where I stayed for four years working out of their commercialization and technology transfer company, UCLB. My time there introduced me to the world of early stage healthcare commercialization; bridging the realm of lab research to the real world through intellectual property strategy, to negotiating licensing deals, to startup company creation.\n\nA yearning for a smaller city and sunshine led me to Barcelona to pursue an MBA at IESE business school; a two-year life-changing rollercoaster that only those with a similar experience can comprehend. I joined Nina Capital as an MBA summer intern and was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to stay. I could not have found a better place to call home.\n\nI was born in Israel, and here I grew up in a small place tucked away in the mostly empty land between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Life in Tel Aviv was better suited for my personality, and I called this cosmopolitan city home for eight years before the warmth of the weather and of the people of Barcelona caught my imagination.\n\nI have a creative soul with an analytical mind—the very obvious result of growing up in a family made of artists on one branch of the tree, and accountants on the other. My appetite for testing new things led me very early to try any kind of medium in plastic art from oil painting to carving in marble. Growing up with a passion for art, I was certain to eventually become an Architect. This was not a passing phase: I carried this ambition for eight years. All it took was one lecture in the school of Architecture to change my mind, leading me to the resolution that what I really wanted to do is conquer the world. Just kidding.\n\nJokes aside, I really was increasingly intrigued by the powers that move the world. To study Law and Economics felt a natural choice to satisfy this curiosity. Before proceeding to world domination, however, I had to travel and learn more about it. With a 15kg bag on my back I hiked through the mountains of Chile and chilled at the beaches of Costa Rica, resulting in a new desire to engage in an international environment.\n\nHaving returned to Israel and fast forwarding to years later, I began working for a large investment house in Israel, investing in Alternative Assets. Specifically, I was sourcing, analyzing, and negotiating opportunities for investment in private companies, VC/PE funds, and Hedge funds. I love being challenged and creating challenges—and the investment world was filled to the brim with hard problems to solve, new strategies, and ideas predicated on weak assumptions.\n\nHowever, the desire for an international experience had never truly left me. It eventually led me to pursue a two-year MBA program at IESE business school in Barcelona. My inner architect was also restless, constantly wanting to build. This is what led me to Nina Capital. One email led to an MBA summer internship and eventually to a very fortunate opportunity to stay and work.\n\nWhen I am not working, I am probably working out in the gym, roaming the streets of Barcelona with my marvelous (and slightly spoiled) rescue dog, or simply enjoying a glass of wine in one of the many breathtaking terraces that Barcelona has to offer.\n\nBorn and raised in Barcelona, I am the youngest member of Nina Capital but also one of the first to join the firm a few months into its existence.\n\nLike most of us here, my path to venture capital was non linear. My obsession for dinosaurs as a kid almost led me to study paleontology, until I came upon biotechnology—and if there is something better than studying dinosaurs, it is being able to create them! Unfortunately, only later did I learn that we were still a bit far from this scientific milestone. It turned out to be, however, just the right choice for me.\n\nDuring my studies in biotechnology at one of the leading schools here in Barcelona, Institut Químic de Sarrià, I discovered the world-changing potential that life sciences will have in our lives in the years to come. In less than a decade, my feelings of disappointment about our limited ability to modify only the genome of living systems before they were born left way to the excitement of seeing that, today, we already have gene therapies that rewrite the code of life as it's unfolding. We are rewriting the pages of a book as it’s being read. What the future of life sciences holds for us, we can only find in science fiction books.\n\nWith so many possibilities, it did not feel right to go into research and commit to a single one. In the meantime and during my last years of university studies, I had developed a strong interest in finance. This newly discovered passion led me to start working in management consulting for the banking industry, where I learnt a great deal of finance—but missed the spirit of science.\n\nA new mission started forming, to dedicate myself to help with access to working capital all the amazing technologies that will be born in the next decade go from idea to reality. Shortly after, I met Marta and resonated deeply with the idea of Nina Capital. The rest, as they say, is another funding round.\n\nJoe Mullings has been building companies and careers since 1989.

This devastating condition affects the elderly and those who suffer from comorbidities such as diabetes and vascular disease. Many patients with chronic wounds not only bear the physical pain of their medical condition, but also are often isolated and sequestered to their beds due to off-loading protocols. Their lives are severely disrupted and patients often spend hundreds of dollars a month out of their own pocket to cover materials needed to care for their wounds. The psychological pain and fear of amputation are the silent companions of their suffering.\n\nThe statistics point to injustices as African-American patients receive amputations at twice the rate of their white counterparts. For patients with vascular disease and chronic wounds, their 5-year mortality rate rivals the five-year mortality rates of cancer patients. Yet, because chronic wounds are not a branded disease and receive little fan fair, few research dollars flow to solve this crisis that is at epidemic levels.\n\nPreviously a founding member of Pearl Capital Advisors LLC—an award-winning investment management firm specializing in volatility-based investments where, as CIO, I led investment research, risk management, and marketing efforts for Pearl’s investment strategies.\n\nCécile joined the Sofinnova MD Start team in 2019.
