        "text": "Verena (Erin) Polowy learned about the dark side of clothing manufacturing while pursuing a degree in fashion design. She decided then to change not only her personal shopping habits but also do what she could to have a positive impact on the industry.\n\nFor over 10 years Erin has been exploring and learning about sustainable and ethical fashion. She created My Green Closet, a youtube channel and blog to share her slow fashion journey, help others build a more conscious wardrobe, and advocate for better industry practices.\n\nErin is from Edmonton, Alberta. When she's not running after her toddler, she can be found sewing, working in the garden, trying new recipes, and listening to audiobooks"
