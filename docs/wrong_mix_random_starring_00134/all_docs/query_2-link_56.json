        "text": "Dr. Adam Dubrowski obtained his PhD from the University of Waterloo in 2001. The following year, he completed his postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience at Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Western Ontario, after which he became a scientist with the Wilson Centre for Research and Education. At the same time, he became an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto. He worked first with the Department of Surgery, and then in 2007 joined the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing. In 2009, he was promoted to Associate Professor and joined the Hospital for Sick Children’s Learning and Research Institutes along with the Department of Pediatrics. In 2013, he became a faculty member with Memorial University’s Disciplines of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics, and was cross-appointed to the Marine Institute. After six years he returned to Oshawa, Ontario as a Professor in Ontario Tech University’s Faculty of Health Sciences.\n\nIn 2002, while at the University of Toronto, Dr. Dubrowski worked with the Department of Surgery as the Director of Surgical Education Fellowship. In 2007, he was appointed the Inaugural Director of the Centre for Research in Nursing Education at the Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing, and strengthened the existing liaison between the new Education and Simulation Centres and post-graduate nursing programs. In 2009, he joined the Hospital for Sick Children’s Learning Institute and formed its research arm, the Fellowship in Education.\n\nAt Memorial University, he founded and Co-Chaired the Tuckamore Simulation and Scholarship Research Collaborative, an entity designed to increase the research and scholarship capacity across the various disciplines, schools and faculties of our many distributed campuses. In 2015, he was appointed the Inaugural Academic Director for the Clinical Learning and Simulation Centre, and in the same year received the Memorial Chair in Teaching and Learning. In 2019, his past leadership and academic accolades led to him being awarded the Canada Research Chair in Health-Care Simulation, which will focus on building SIMmersion, an immersive simulation research network."
