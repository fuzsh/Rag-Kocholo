        "text": "Ask any defender of the current credit card debt balance, and theyâ€™ll point you to the \"low\" delinquency rate as why things are fine. You may have read this from me before, but Iâ€™m doubling downâ€¦itâ€™s a garbage metric. Hereâ€™s why: 1. These rates donâ€™t factor out new card holders. When you add a new card holder, itâ€™s a non delinquent account. If that new card member transfers a balance (most at 0% right now), itâ€™s a double whammy. It's similar to HH penetration and buy rate in CPG...if your HH penetration goes up, your buy rate goes down (for items with an avg. annual frequency >1). Why? New households automatically bring in lower annual spend...they haven't been there a year. Same goes for delinquency rates 2. Whatâ€™s the difference between 3% of $400 billion and 3% of $1 trillion? Itâ€™s a lot. When rates are referred to as the comparison between now and 2019 (higher anyway) or the Great Recession, it assumes the total sum of delinquent dollars to be relatively similar. Ummmm no. In the chart below Iâ€™ve plotted out the projected value of delinquencies based total credit and revolving debt, by quarter. It goes back to 2000. The blue area is non-adjusted numbers. The gray is adjusted using a CPI index (not perfect, but the point is the comparison). Notice anything? The red line should help. In real dollars, the amount of delinquent dollars is crazy. In adjusted dollars, itâ€™s also not looking great (ignore that 2010 thingâ€¦pretty sure itâ€™s a reporting change). Levels similar too, you guessed it, 2008. Iâ€™ve watched the two major credit card companies spike between 3%-5% the past week alone. Outside of taking an absolute bath on put options for one, itâ€™s bothering me quite a bit because it's clear this is a problem, not an opportunity. There are estimated to be over 230 million people with a credit card in the US, with the average debt per adult up between 20%-25% since Q1 of 2020. Someone please help me understand why and how the market believes this is sustainable... Then again...I guess it is the same market that once....eh, never mind. #creditcard #consumerbehavior #retail\n\nJune Retail Sales is expected to come in -0.2% from May. If it happens, it will only be the 9th time in the last 37 readings the change in Retail Sales outpaced the change in total Credit Card balances. I'll take the 3.5:1 it doesn't... I often get frustrated (shocker, I know) with the lack of connectivity between public data sets cited from those with large audiences. It seems like every chart or data scenario is locked in a vacuum and can only be utilized for that talk track. ANY macroeconomic data point, consumer-based especially, is better when it is given context with a related metric...it helps us qualify the actual insight. Case in point - Retail Sales and Credit Card balances. Since the launch of the Consumer Loan metric by the Federal Reserve Board in late 2000, these two metrics have been within 10bps* of each other, in the favor of credit balances, on a monthly cadence. That means if I get a reading on Credit Card balances five days before Retail Sales, like this month, I have a fairly good indicator. However, since June of 2021, that 10bps has shot up to 70bps. This change has largely been driven by the excessive spending in June, inflationary reaction in 2022, and then likely the continuation of spending from higher income households. Unsurprisingly, the two giant boosts in that time (Jan '22 and Jan '23) also coincide with Social Security COLA's going into place.... Both have been slowing quite substantially after a little boost in Q1. On Friday, the final figures for June came in with Credit Card balances down from May...only the 3rd negative read in 3 years but the 2nd in Q2 of '24 (June was -29bps). That said, I'm not crazy enough to suggest retail sales will be down nearly 100bps (-1%) between June and May (-70bs average for Retail Sales from Credit Balance change), but I do believe the projected figure of -10bps is a little light. I'll go with -50bps (-0.5%). We'll see tomorrow. Regardless, this quarter is looking like it hit a wall from the consumer standpoint... #retail #consumerbehavior\n\nAnother earnings season is about to kick off again. It's a bit of a whiplash environment out there for consumer focused companies, but here are a few themes I expect to come up: 1. Consumer pullback/slowing/moderating/etc: You've probably seen it peppered in articles, or casually mentioned on the news, but there's signs of a weakening consumer landscape. I realize I'm a bit of the boy who cried wolf here, but this time others are seeing the wolf as well. I've started to look at the Credit Card and Revolving plan loan figures that come out of the Federal Reserve Board every week. You can see here, the blue line, is showing a pretty sharp drop to just 12bps vs. Q1 (this figure is projected through 6/26, the rate of change is the end values of the quarters). This rate as how much is added to/paid off from these loans...obviously if you're adding, you're spending. Take the ole pandemic time period out of it...there haven't been many quarters that looked like this in the past decade. Oh...and I put it next to Personal Consumption just so you could make your own hypotheses there. Keep in mind, personal consumption is roughly 70% of the contribution to GDP growth... 2. Volume contraction We already saw one major CPG report mid-single digit volume declines for the year, and a little more than that for its most recent quarter. While the above credit card is likely driven by changes in higher income households, lower purchasing power households were already at their limit, now pulling back even more on volume/units. The downward trend in credit usage could very much be a precursor to more volume declines across the landscape. 3. Revised Guidance Like a horse that shoots out of the gate and falls behind on the backstretch, Q2 will bring a lot of revisions to fiscal guidance. The consumer behavior of Q1 surprised almost everyone. With it, came a number of companies holding their guidance set at the end of the prior year, and some even increased it. If this is the case, as an outsider watching the market more closely the past couple of years, downgrading guidance is often a major drag on a stock, even with decent performance. I can see this wiping out some significant value. 4. Correction I already heard it about a dozen times on CNBC yesterday, but even the biggest bulls are suggesting there's a correction coming. There reasons are the Fed's fiscal policy, the election, global influences (i.e. the elections in the UK and France), etc. The real reason has been taking a lot longer to play out, but it's the previously mentioned topic #1 above. This is the most expensive form of social proof. When the market starts to say things (AI, NFT, DTC, blah blah blah), everyone moves in that direction. If this picks up steam, it ultimately becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I may have been early calling the consumer pullback, but this time....I might still be early ðŸ˜‚ . #consumerbehavior #retail #earnings\n\nAn interesting experience at Costco today when the employee working our register asked what we thought of the new rotisserie chicken bags. It was our first experience, so we turned the question back on them.... \"Not great\" was their reply. The employee then went on to explain something that seemed like a huge miss internally. When these chickens are removed from the oven, they're done so on a skewer. The old containers could be set in a way the employees could just lay the chickens in each container and pull out the skewer. That makes 5-6 chickens ready to be packed. Now, each chicken has to be placed in a bag...a not-so-insignificant time suck. \"Sounds like someone in corporate didn't do their research.\" I said to the employee, then went on to my crazy cart packing. Given this national rollout is fairly new, it's only a matter of time before it hits a media wave. A few talk tracks I expect we'll see/hear from the customer perspective: \"There were already lines to wait for these, and now it takes even longer.\" \"The chicken appears to be smaller.\" \"It's difficult to store and/or take off small pieces when I'm not eating the whole thing in one sitting.\" (that one's a personal opinion from today...not a huge deal, but noticeable) Likely commentary from Costco: \"This is how we keep these things $4.99...\" ðŸŽ¤ drop? It'll be interesting to see how the retailer that can do no wrong handles the situation. I might be exaggerating, but this has future HBR case study written all over it. Just depends how loud the rotisserie chicken loyalists get. #consumerbehavior #retail #costco #bagOchicken\n\nIâ€™m coming up on 3 years of tracking public data and connecting it to consumer behavior. Friday was a first seeing consumption chained dollars outpace current dollars. This one is going to get a little detailed, consider yourself warned. Chained dollars is another way to say inflation adjusted. Ever since I started watching these metrics, these two numbers were reversed. While inflation driven spending boosted consumption dollars, and ultimately the perspective of many companies as being more successful than what they were/are, chained dollars showed what was actually happening. In the consumer world, I think about chained dollars more as volume. Volume (ie unit/size) is what fills up plant capacity, ingredient purchases, and all of the jobs connected to them. Volumes have mostly been on the declineâ€¦not a great sign. That said, I was very surprised to see this swing in Fridayâ€™s report. Of course I dug inâ€¦ Consumption is broken out into Durable and Non-Durable goods, along with Services. While services provided the largest change, it actually slowed from the prior month. It was durable goods that shifted significantly, moving from -$20b to +$13b. That seemed like a lot. Off to retail sales. (Before I do, itâ€™s crazy that retail sales comes in 2+ weeks before this readâ€¦any movement based on this report is really outdated.) When I think of gif swings in durable goods, I often look at autos first. Of course, the largest month to month change in May? Correct, cars. So we know cars had a month in May, but why the situation below? Off to the CPI. New vehicle pricing has had accelerated declines every month this year, with May being the peak at -0.5 vs April. Why, you might ask? Inventory. Car companies are dealing with fairly significant inventory issues right now, so theyâ€™re using aggressive deals to turn that inventory. So, as a result of consumer pullback in autos, we saw a significant shift in consumption this last month as pricing DID NOT outpace total spending due to increased discounting activity in the auto sector. This matters a lot because if this theory holds up, the technical glitch at dealerships in June could swing these numbers the other way. Without the context it could seem really surprising to the market. Weâ€™ll learn more as earnings season heats up. #consumerbehavior #pce\n\nThe term bellwether comes from shepherd's tying a bell around the lead sheep in a flock so they could track the flock's movement. Walmart is the lead sheep in the consumer landscape...the flock is moving. In this case, Walmart isn't just up against the strong performance in Q1 (something of a headwind for everyone in retail), but also a strong Q2 last year. It's a bit of a double whammy, especially as the industry clings to lower purchasing power households as the main culprit of a slowing retail environment. The thing is, Walmart has already captured those consumers looking for the lowest price. They've traded down as far as they could go...if Walmart is seeing softness, it's likely due to volume declines and higher purchasing power households pulling back more. Regardless, everyone should take note. Walmart's leadership is very aware of the potential impact of their comments, and over the past few years what they've said this early in a quarter almost always plays out (and you don't need Walmart saying this to see what's happening quarter to quarter - public releases are showing the same thing). Last thing...a rough Q2 consumer environment doesn't mean the company isn't performing. It just means its weathering a potential storm....again. #consumerbehavior #retail"
