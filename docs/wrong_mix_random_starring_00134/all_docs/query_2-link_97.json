Not only has the pandemic led to fundamental changes in our daily lives, but many Canadians have experienced its tragic consequences including the suffering and loss of loved ones, lost jobs and livelihoods, reduced social connections and increased isolation.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Health Portfolio has been at the centre of efforts to respond to the pandemic. These efforts continue as Canada is currently experiencing a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is fuelled by the highly contagious Delta variant.\n\n1.6+ million reported cases of COVID-19 in Canada since the start of the pandemic\n\n28,000+ deaths due to COVID-19 in Canada since the start of the pandemic\n\nApproximately 30 million Canadians received one dose of vaccine, and Approximately 83% of eligible persons fully vaccinated\n\nThe Chief Public Health Officer of Canada\n\nThe Chief Public Health Officer of Canada (CPHO) advises you, as the Minister of Health, on public health related matters, and provides leadership by communicating with other levels of government, voluntary organizations, the private sector and Canadians on public health issues.\n\nThe CPHO has played a key role in the COVID response providing evidence-based, public health advice to the government, and working with PT counterparts to support Canadians.\n\nThe health of Canadians\n\nDespite the significant ongoing challenges with COVID-19, Canadians generally experience good health.\n\nCanada ranks among the top and middle third performers among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member states for most health indicators\n\nPublic health efforts across the Canadian health system, including vaccination programs, have reduced the risks of infectious diseases considerably\n\nEfforts are underway to address systemic health inequities especially for Indigenous, racialized and marginalized populations (e.g., new immigrant, low-income, 2SLGBTQQIA+)\n\nCanada's health care system is a source of pride for many Canadians and one of the reasons for the overall good health Canadians enjoy. However, it faces a number of challenges.\n\nThe health of Canadians â key challenges\n\nChronic disease\n\nChronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes continue to be the greatest cause of disease burden in Canada. While Canadians are generally healthy, 44% of adults 20+ have at least 1 of 10 common chronic diseases, and over 4 out of 5 have at least one preventable risk factor.\n\nInfectious disease\n\nRates of HIV and hepatitis C are slow to decrease, while rates of other sexually transmitted infections have increase exponentially. Overall, infectious syphilis rates have increased by 124% nationally from 2016 to 2020. Canada is not meeting its vaccination targets for certain diseases such as measles.\n\nMental health\n\nWhile many Canadians live with positive mental health, 1 in 3 have, or will have had, a mental illness by the time they reach 40 years of age and, on average, 10-12 Canadians die by suicide every day. COVID-19 has exacerbated mental health challenges for Canadians with higher rates of reported anxiety and depression since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nOpioid overdose crisis\n\nThere were 21,174 opioid-related deaths between January 2016 and December 2020. This has contributed to a slowing or stagnation in the growth of Canadians' overall life expectancy, particularly among men, who did not have an increase in life expectancy from 2016-2018.\n\nAlcohol, tobacco and vaping\n\nWhile smoking rates in Canada are at their lowest level in decades, rates of youth vaping are high. While vaping may be less harmful than smoking for those who switch completely, it is not harmless, and the long-term health effects of vaping remain unknown. Alcohol is the most prevalent substance used in Canada and results in significant public health harms. Its normalization and problematic use led to over 18,000 deaths in 2017.\n\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nAntibiotics are rapidly becoming ineffective because the bacteria they are designed to eliminate are becoming resistant to these drugs. AMR is a complex problem that can result from any use of antibiotics and is made worse by overuse and misuse in people and animals. In 2018, the estimated number of AMR-related deaths in Canada was 5,400.\n\nClimate change\n\nCanadians are already experiencing health impacts from changes to Canada's climate such as increased injury and fatalities related to extreme weather events, mental health challenges, heat and food-related illness, increased food insecurity, and the spread of infectious and vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease.\n\nHealth inequities\n\nSignificant health inequities continue to exist in Canada between Canadians with different socioeconomic status and certain populations, including Indigenous peoples. Disparities exist in areas of life expectancy, infant mortality, mental illness hospitalizations among others. Stigma and discrimination prevent people from accessing resources they need to be healthy and put them at greater risk of disease, violence and injury.\n\nThe Health of Canadians â Pandemic impacts\n\nLong-term care\n\nThe pandemic has emphasized the need for improving the care of seniors in long-term care facilities, with more than 15,000 residents tragically dying since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nBacklogs in diagnosis and treatment\n\nThe pandemic has resulted in cancelled or delayed medical procedures for many Canadians, resulting in a backlog of approximately 580,000 surgeries to date. These delays and cancellations are expected to have an impact on the morbidity and mortality of Canadians.\n\nMental health\n\nThe impacts of both the pandemic and the response to it (i.e. social isolation, job losses and school closures caused by lockdowns) pose risks to mental health, increasing substance abuse, and other social issues. COVID-19 has exacerbated mental health challenges for Canadians across all age groups, with individuals reporting higher rates of anxiety and depression since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nOpioid overdose crisis\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the opioid overdose crisis. For example, nationally there were 5,148 opioid-related deaths between April and December 2020, an 89% increase compared to the same time period in 2019.\n\nAlcohol/other substance use\n\nBetween March and September 2020, the total number of all (alcohol, cannabis, opioids, stimulants) substance-related deaths increased in emergency departments (by 12%) and hospitals (by 13%) compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nDisproportionate impacts on existing inequalities\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has affected all Canadians, some have faced disproportionately higher impacts than others due to existing health and social inequalities. These include low-wage workers, older adults, young people, racialized workers, remote communities, Indigenous Peoples, and women. These vulnerable groups are also those that have seen the strongest decline in their mental health and life satisfaction.\n\nThe health system in Canada\n\nRoles and responsibilities for health care services in Canada are shared between provincial and territorial governments (PTs) and the federal government.\n\nPTs are responsible for the management, organization and delivery of health care services for their residents.\n\nThe federal government is responsible for:\n\nSetting and administering national standards for the health care system through the Canada Health Act (CHA);\n\nProviding funding support for provincial and territorial health services;\n\nSupporting the delivery of health care services to specific groups (i.e. First Nations on reserve; Inuit; serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces; veterans; some groups of refugee claimants, etc.);\n\nProviding other health related functions including the regulation of products (e.g., food, consumer products), health research, health promotion and protection, and disease monitoring and prevention.\n\nHealthcare spending\n\n49% of national healthcare spending comes from PT governments (not counting federal funding that flows through PTs).\n\n19% of national healthcare spending comes from the federal government.\n\nPublic sector share of total health spending: 70.4%.\n\nPrivate sector share of total health spending: 29.6%.\n\nFederal spending is 27.8% of total public spending.\n\nThe Canada Health Transfer (CHT) is the key federal funding vehicle for supporting health care, allocated to PTs on an equal per-capita basis.\n\nThe Canada Health Act (CHA) establishesrequirements PTs must fulfillto get the full amount of their cash entitlement under the CHT.\n\nThe CHA states that the primary objective of Canadian health policy is: \"to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers\".\n\nThe 5 CHA criteria are:\n\nPublic administration;\n\nComprehensiveness;\n\nUniversality;\n\nPortability;\n\nAccessibility.\n\nThe health system â national health expenditures\n\nAs health needs and approaches to delivering care have changed, so too has the focus of spending. The proportion of spending going toward hospitals has declined over time, while spending on drugs and other spending â such as on other institutions and home and community care â have increased.Footnote 1\n\nSpending for hospitals decreased from 45% in 1975 to 26% in 2019.\n\nSpending for physicians remained the same from 1975 to 2019 at 15%.\n\nSpending for drugs increased from 9% in 1975 to 15% in 2019.\n\nSpending in other areas increased from 31% in 1975 to 44% in 2019.\n\nSource: Canadian Institute for Health Information, National Health Expenditure Trends, 1975 to 2019; National Health Expenditure Trends, 2020\n\nThe health system â key trends and drivers in the health context\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\n\nResulted in greater FPT and stakeholder collaboration to scale up testing and tracing, mobilize resources, approve, acquire and distribute vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and communicate key messages and information to ensure Canadians' health and safety.\n\nClimate change\n\nImpacting the health of Canadians by, for example, altering the spread and intensity of certain diseases, and causing extreme weather events. The Health Portfolio is taking action to protect Canadians from the growing risk landscape, including working with FPT partners.\n\nEvolving expectations of the health system\n\nChanges in how Canadians seek health information, advancements in health technologies, and the desire for \"anywhere, anytime\" monitoring, diagnosis and treatment, have implications for Health Portfolio communication strategies, health care delivery and regulatory decisions.\n\nChanging demographics\n\nPopulation aging and increasing chronic conditions shift needs toward services and care provided in the home and in the community rather than in hospitals. Some regions have younger age demographics (e.g., northern communities) while others have higher proportions of recent immigrants, creating unique regional health care needs.\n\nInnovation in science and technology\n\nRapid rise of digital health, advancement of mRNA vaccines, growing artificial intelligence (AI), and precision medicine using genome sequencing are examples of areas where the Health Portfolio is taking action to ensure Canadians benefit without compromising safety.\n\nNew ways data is collected and used\n\nHealth systems are generating more data which can help forecast trends, support decision-making and improve health outcomes and health system efficiency. With the rise of \"big data\" and use of AI technologies, there are also challenges in addressing new regulatory, ethical and privacy concerns.\n\nHealth inequities\n\nHealth inequities in Canada became worse with COVID-19 and there is growing awareness of the need to address systemic racism and discrimination in the health system. Ensuring that a cultural safety lens is applied to health system delivery will be key to curbing the growing inequalities among Canadians.\n\nGlobalization and global supply chains\n\nGlobalization has afforded access to products from around the world and increased the complexity of the medical supply chain. The Health Portfolio continues to partner with international stakeholders to ensure safety in the global supply chain, while also working towards a whole-of-government approach to security of supply.\n\nThe Health Portfolio operates in a dynamic and complex environment, with external trends and factors influencing the health landscape in Canada, as well as priorities for FPT collaboration.\n\nRoles and responsibilities of the health portfolio\n\nAs Minister of Health, you are responsible for five dynamic, science-based organizations, each playing a unique and important role in the health and safety of Canadians.\n\nUnder your direct purview\n\nHealth Canada (HC)\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)\n\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)\n\nArms-Length organizations\n\nPatented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMBRB)\n\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)\n\nThe Health Portfolio's main activities include:\n\nResponding to public health emergencies, including the current COVID-19 pandemic;\n\nStrengthening Canada's universal health care system;\n\nEnabling access to quality, safe and effective health products/regulatory role;\n\nManaging risks to health;\n\nSupporting Canadians in making safe and healthy choices; and\n\nSupporting health research and science, data collection and surveillance capacity.\n\nRoles and responsibilities â responding to public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDeveloping health security measures / Preparing for and responding to health emergencies\n\nSupporting border and travel health\n\nProviding domestic and international health security leadership\n\nProtecting against vaccine-preventable diseases\n\nResponding to the threat posed by antimicrobial resistance\n\nThe National Microbiology Laboratory (NML)\n\nThe NML works with public health partners in Canada and internationally to prevent the spread of infectious disease. It is the only \"Level 4 Lab\" in Canada, meaning it is able to work with the world's most dangerous pathogens.\n\nThe NML enables informed public health action through delivery of innovative approaches to advance laboratory science, testing services, lab-based surveillance, outbreak response and national public health laboratory leadership.\n\nRoles and responsibilities â Strengthening Canada's universal health care system\n\nStewardship of universally accessible, publicly funded health care for Canadians through administration of the Canada Health Act\n\nProviding leadership on emerging issues and working multilaterally and bilaterally with provinces and territories on system improvements\n\nEnhancing the affordability, accessibility and appropriate use of prescription drugs\n\nInvesting in Pan-Canadian Health Organizations to drive progress on health priorities (see Annex 1)\n\nManaging federal grants and contributions programs to support health care and public health innovation and priorities\n\nVirtual care\n\nIn response to the challenges of delivering health care during the pandemic, and to support PTs in accelerating their efforts to put in place tools and supports for virtual services, Health Canada worked with these jurisdictions to institute a range of digital supports that helped Canadians find the information, resources, and care they needed.\n\nAs of August 13, 2021, all 13 bilateral agreements with PTs have been signed, with funding focused on advancing shared priorities on virtual care.\n\nRoles and responsibilities â enabling access to safe and effective health products\n\nAssessing and regulating health products to ensure their safety, effectiveness and quality\n\nModernizing regulatory regimes to increase access to safe and effective treatment options for Canadians\n\nMonitoring health product safety and adverse events arising from use and communicating risks to Canadians\n\nHealth Portfolio regulatory responsibilities\n\nHealth Canada regulates:\n\nMore than 14,000 prescription and non-prescription drugs;\n\nMore than 700 biologics and biotechnology products;\n\nMore than 1,500 veterinary drugs and over 2,500 low-risk veterinary health products;\n\nMore than 150,000 natural health products;\n\nMore than 45,000 medical devices;\n\nMore than 8,000 registered pesticides.\n\nPHAC regulates:\n\nMore than 1,000 facilities that handle human pathogens and toxins.\n\nCFIA conducts:\n\nApproximately 3,150 food safety investigations and an average of 200 primary recalls and 400 total recalls each year.\n\nThe regulatory oversight process is organized from pre-market to post-market and consists of the following stages:\n\nPre-clinical trials\n\nClinical trials\n\nRegulatory product submission\n\nSubmission review\n\nMarket authorization decision\n\nPublic access\n\nSafety, monitoring, surveillance, inspection, compliance, verification, enforcement\n\nRoles and responsibilities â Managing risks to health\n\nIn addition to maintaining readiness to respond to public health threats and emergencies, the Health Portfolio plays a number of other important roles in managing risks to health:\n\nManaging food-related health risks through strong food safety regulations, surveillance and enforcement;\n\nAssessing and managing the health risks of consumer products and cosmetics;\n\nImplementing comprehensive approaches to minimize the health risks associated with legal and illegal substances;\n\nOverseeing the legal cannabis framework;\n\nReducing environmental health risks.\n\nHealth Portfolio role in food safety\n\nThe Safe Food for Canadians Regulations, which came into force in 2019, make our food system even safer by focusing on the food industry's prevention of food safety risks during production and allowing for faster removal of unsafe food from the marketplace.\n\nUnder these regulations, food businesses that import or prepare food for export or to be sent across provincial/territorial boundaries must meet key requirements related to licensing, preventive controls, and traceability.\n\nRoles and responsibilities â Supporting Canadians in making safe and healthy choices\n\nPromoting the health and well-being of Canadians by addressing risk factors and underlying determinants of health and health inequities\n\nPromoting healthy behaviours and practices to improve health\n\nBuilding protective factors and addressing health equity\n\nSupporting Canadians in making better food choices\n\nInforming and engaging Canadians by being a trusted source of information on health and safety\n\nA social determinants of health approach to improve health for at-risk groups\n\nAn individual's health is determined by the social determinants of health â a broad range of personal, social, economic and environmental factors â such as income, housing, education, physical environment, gender and culture.\n\nThe Health Portfolio researched and analyzed the impact of the pandemic on at-risk populations, which highlighted how disproportionately these groups had been affected. Recommendations were made to reduce or close the gap, such as ramping up efforts in visible minority communities to reduce vaccine hesitancy. The Health Portfolio also worked to ensure the needs of at-risk populations were considered and incorporated in pandemic responses.\n\nRoles and responsibilities â Supporting health research and science, data collection and surveillance capacity\n\nFunding research that generates new knowledge, improves health or health services, informs priorities and supports health innovation\n\nFunding National Collaborating Centres that promote the use of evidence by public health practitioners and policy makers\n\nStrengthening surveillance, evidence and public education on chronic and infectious disease\n\nThe primary research arm of the Health Portfolio is CIHR, which invests over $1.2 billion annually to support world-class researchers and trainees across Canada in a broad range of research, from basic science to knowledge mobilization and policy.\n\nPHAC has approximately 85 surveillance systems and data holdings used to generate reports, bulletins and health advisories, and to inform the development of programs and policies.\n\nDuring the pandemic, PHAC built a Public Health Data Platform to facilitate the sharing of COVID case and vaccination data from the PTs, and to support PTs in assessing their data against the national picture. Lessons learned through the pandemic and other research and audits are now being addressed through the development of a pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy.\n\nPartnerships and collaboration â FPT context\n\nAt the federal level, the Health Portfolio works collaboratively with a number of other government departments and agencies.\n\nOngoing FPT collaboration is maintained through well-developed formal structures including:\n\nFPT Health Ministers' Meeting (HMM);\n\nConference of Deputy Ministers of Health (CDM);\n\nPan-Canadian Public Health Network (PHN);\n\nCollaborative work with FPT partners through engagement and leadership on several committees.\n\nFPT collaboration on vaccines\n\nVaccination is one of the most effective public health strategies for protecting populations against infectious diseases.\n\nIn collaboration with PT governments and stakeholders, the Health Portfolio maximizes the impact of PT vaccination programs by:\n\nserving as federal coordinator and focal point for information on vaccine safety; and\n\nworking with the PTs to collect, analyze, and report information on adverse events following immunization, and vaccination coverage across Canada.\n\nThe Health Portfolio continues to lead Canada's COVID-19 response, including securing and distributing vaccines, ensuring their safety, building public confidence in vaccination, and monitoring and reporting vaccine data in collaboration with PTs.\n\nPartnerships and collaboration â Indigenous organizations and governments\n\nIndigenous Services Canada (ISC) funds or directly provides services for First Nations and Inuit that supplement PT services\n\nEngagement is often done in collaboration with other federal departments, such as ISC and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC)\n\nThe Health Portfolio works with other Indigenous health system partners to close gaps in health outcomes for Indigenous Peoples and address systemic barriers to accessing safe and equitable health services. Examples of partners include the Indigenous Physicians Association of Canada (IPAC), Canadian Indigenous Nurses Association (CINA), First Nations Health Authority (FNHA), National Consortium for Indigenous Medical Education, and National Aboriginal Council of Midwives (NACM).\n\nThe Portfolio also contributes to whole-of-government efforts to advance reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples by implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action and supporting the federal response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\n\nCIHR's Network Environments for Indigenous Health Research program is a national network of centres focused on capacity development, research, and knowledge translation centered on Indigenous Peoples. It aims to provide supportive research environments for Indigenous health research driven by, and grounded in, Indigenous communities in Canada.\n\nPartnerships and collaboration â International partners\n\nAs Minister of Health, you will typically engage multilaterally by leading Canada's delegation at international and political fora, and bilaterally with key counterparts from other countries or regional partners.\n\nE.g.,\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n\nG7 and G20 Health Ministers meetings\n\nAs Minister of Health, you will also engage with counterparts from other countries or regions to advance bilateral collaboration on health issues of common concern.\n\nE.g.,\n\nHealth Canada shared information and expertise with international regulatory counterparts to support the review and post-market monitoring of COVID-19 health products.\n\nExample â Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)\n\nRecognizing the international nature of the threat posed by AMR, Canada actively engages multilaterally through a number of fora including CODEX, the Trans-Atlantic Task Force on AMR, the Global Health Security Agenda, and the Alliance of Champions.\n\nAnnex 1 â List and mandate of the Pan-Canadian Health Organizations (PCHOs)\n\nThe Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) is the main national body charged with collecting, analyzing and reporting health data (e.g., wait times, quality of care and outcomes, health expenditures, allocation of health professionals). CIHI data and information supports health system improvements, and is used by Canadian governments, policy-makers and health system managers in making health policy decisions and in supporting effective health system management. CIHI relies heavily on PTs for collection of health data.\n\nThe Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) provides decision-makers with evidence and advice to help provincial/territorial health ministries and federal- provincial/territorial (FPT) drug plans make informed decisions about the effectiveness and efficiency of drugs, medical devices and other health technologies. CADTH's Reimbursement Reviews make recommendations to governments on drugs that are included on public drug plan formularies.\n\nCanada Health Infoway (Infoway) works with PTs, health care providers and other partners to accelerate the development and adoption of electronic health information systems with compatible standards on a pan-Canadian basis. Infoway is currently focused on pan-Canadian initiatives including virtual care, patient access to digital records, and an electronic prescribing system.\n\nHealthcare Excellence Canada is the newly amalgamated organization of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute and the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement. It works with patients and other partners to share proven innovations and best practices that lead to lasting improvements in patient safety and healthcare quality (most recently, its 'LTC+' program provided seed funding and programming support to long-term care and retirement homes to strengthen their pandemic preparedness and response).\n\nThe Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) provides national leadership on the implementation of the Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control (which addresses primary cancer prevention, screening and early detection, standards and cancer guidelines, the cancer journey, health human resources, research, and surveillance), and coordinates efforts of PTs, cancer experts and stakeholder groups. CPAC recently led a refresh of the Strategy, released in June 2019.\n\nThe Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) acts as a catalyst for improving the mental health system and changing the attitudes and behaviours of Canadians around mental health issues (for example, by reducing the stigma associated with mental health illness and treatment). Its work focuses on four priority areas: population-based initiatives, suicide prevention, the integration of mental health and substance use, and engagement with Canadians.\n\nThe Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) provides research, effective knowledge exchange and expertise for the substance use field, promotes increased awareness among Canadians and health system stakeholders about substance use and addiction, convenes stakeholders across sectors (including those with lived and living experience) to reduce the harms of substance use, and promotes the use of programs shown to be effective in combating problematic substance use. CCSA is the only PCHO created by federal legislation.\n\nHealth Portfolio organizations\n\nHealth Canada's mandate and vision\n\nHealth Canada is the federal department responsible for helping the

business lines has been our COVID-19 response. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Health Canada has taken a leadership role to address the health impacts of the pandemic on Canadians.\n\nCOVID-19 fundamentally impacted the department's operations, increased the oversight of the Health Portfolio and dominated the federal provincial planning and governance agendas.\n\nThe magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic required strategic and wide-ranging collaboration with all of Health Canada's partners in health â other federal government departments and agencies, provinces and territories (F/P/Ts), municipalities, Indigenous communities, academic and science and tech organizations, private sector companies, frontline workers and other stakeholders.\n\nIn support of the COVID-19 response, a Health Canada COVID-19 Taskforce was established to coordinate the portfolio's response and provide leadership on health issues, specifically Personal Protective Equipment, Testing and Vaccines.\n\nIn 2020-21, the Department approved 5 vaccines and they were rolled out across the country, providing protection to those most at risk.\n\nDepartmental actions during the COVID-19 response:\n\nVaccines\n\nImplemented innovative and agile regulatory measures to authorize vaccines, as well as treatments and therapies\n\nLed work on expert advice and investment in research and vaccine treatments\n\nTesting & tracing\n\nDeveloped notification apps to alert Canadians on risk of exposure to control the outbreak\n\nScaled up testing and tracing\n\nSupport to PTs\n\nPurchased PPE and supplies; Developed PPE supply and demand model\n\nEnhanced healthcare capacity\n\nMobilized resources to provide surge capacity and support\n\nLaunched digital tools to support mental health of Canadians (Wellness Together Canada)\n\nCommunications and public engagement\n\nProviding timely, trusted, and evidence-based pandemic information to Canadians\n\nOther\n\nReinforced comprehensive strategies to protect public servants' mental health and wellness\n\nHealth Canada's key partners\n\nHealth Canada operates in a complex and dynamic environment where many health challenges â such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid overdose crisis â require a multi-jurisdictional approach.\n\nThe Department works collaboratively and collectively with federal partners, provinces and territories (P/Ts), Indigenous organizations, industry, and international regulators.\n\nHealth Portfolio partners\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada\n\nCanadian Food Inspection Agency\n\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research\n\nPatented Medicine Prices Review Board\n\nProvincial and territorial governments\n\nMultilateral and bilateral machinery (including annual FPT Health Ministers' Meetings and the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network)\n\nHealth system partners\n\nSeven Pan-Canadian Health Organizations (e.g., Canadian Institute for Health Information\n\nNational Non-governmental organizations (health professional associations, regulatory and accreditation authorities, disease-specific organizations)\n\nHospitals and patient safety organizations\n\nAdvocacy groups\n\nIndustry / Consumer groups\n\nPrivate sector enterprises (including manufacturers, distributors, and retailers)\n\nIndustry associations\n\nConsumer groups\n\nStandards development organizations (e.g., CSA Group)\n\nIndigenous partners\n\nNational and regional First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis partners\n\nIndigenous Health Professional Organizations\n\nFederal departments and agencies\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada\n\nInnovation, Science and Economic Development Canada\n\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada\n\nPublic Safety/Canada Border Services Agency\n\nIndigenous Services Canada\n\nWomen and Gender Equality Canada\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada\n\nFinance Canada/Treasury Board\n\nInternational partners\n\nMultilateral fora (e.g., World Health Organization, Pan-American Health Organization, United Nations)\n\nBilateral relationships with key partners and regions (e.g., U.S. Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, and Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration)\n\nHealth Canada financial overview\n\nBudget by Core Responsibility and Internal Services\n\nCore Responsibility 1 â Health Care Systems.
