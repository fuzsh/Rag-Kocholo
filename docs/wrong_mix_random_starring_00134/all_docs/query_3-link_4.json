        "text": "They are successful and glamorous, in a Bushwick, Brooklyn, sort of way. And on Tuesday, U.S. officials arrested them on allegations they sought to launder billions of dollars worth of crypto stemming from a 2016 hack of the Bitfinex crypto exchange.\n\nShe is a young marketing entrepreneur with a cheekish rapper alter ego and a lot of bylines in business magazines. Her husband is a tech entrepreneur who founded a blockchain startup that promised users a chance to keep their privacy. Now their own privacy is gone as they‚Äôre charged with being heavily involved in one of the largest crypto hacks in history.\n\nFor Heather Morgan and Ilya ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù Lichtenstein, it‚Äôs not a long distance from New York's hipster-soaked city cafes to the federal courthouse, but it‚Äôs a long way from where they appeared to be going.\n\nWhile the complaint warrant filed by U.S. authorities today accuse Lichtenstein and Morgan of being significantly involved in what happened with the Bitfinex hack, they did not accuse Lichtenstein or Morgan of being the actual hackers. Rather, the feds said, ‚ÄúIn or around August 2016, a hacker breached Victim [virtual currency exchange‚Äôs] security systems and infiltrated its infrastructure.‚Äù\n\nA University of California, Davis grad, Morgan spent time in the Middle East, getting a Master of Arts degree in international economic development at the American University in Cairo and studying Turkish monetary policy in Ankara‚Äôs Bilkent University, according to what appears to be her LinkedIn profile. (She calls herself ‚ÄúTurkish Martha Stewart‚Äù in a music video.)\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to tell you my secret for making dreams a reality,‚Äù Morgan said in a TikTok video. ‚ÄúI started my company when I was 23 and grew it into a multimillion-dollar business with zero outside funding. I had no connections. I didn‚Äôt go to an Ivy League school and I wasn‚Äôt trust-funded. How did I do it? I learned a simple framework in Silicon Valley from some top entrepreneurs that are now billionaires that I live by. It goes like this: automate, eliminate, delegate.‚Äù\n\nInterestingly, one piece she did for Forbes included quotes from BitGo's chief compliance officer, Matt Parrella. BitGo provided the multi-signature wallets and was custodian for Bitfinex at the time of the nearly 120,000 bitcoin hack in 2016. \"In order to withdraw such a large amount of funds, BitGo would likely have had to sign off on those transactions,\" Stan Higgins wrote at the time for CoinDesk.\n\nOh, and she is a rap star. OK, not quite like fellow entrepreneur Jay-Z or even Vanilla Ice, but her humorous takes were mildly reminiscent of Kitty from a few years ago. Going by the name Razzlekhan (‚Äúlike Genghis Khan, but with more pizzazz,‚Äù proclaims her website), Morgan pumped out songs over the past few months that weren‚Äôt going to make it on the radio but could certainly make for a fun show.\n\n‚ÄúRazzlekhan is a surrealist artist with synesthesia making music for MI$FIT$. üíúüßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Razz creates sexy horror-comedy raps with an authentically awkward twang. This ‚Äòdigital bedouin‚Äô gives you a taste of the silk road--from Cairo to Hong Kong,‚Äù says her Spotify page. The title of one song, ‚ÄúSaaSholes,‚Äù is a nod to her professional career as a SaaS entrepreneur.\n\nHer song ‚ÄúGILFALICIOUS‚Äù is about a ‚Äúgilf,‚Äù which one assumes is an acronym for ‚Äúgrandma I‚Äôd like to have coffee with‚Äù or thereabouts. ‚ÄúI made the song, GILFALICIOUS, as a humorous attack on #ageism against women & #sexism in general. If I make it to 90, this is EXACTLY how I want to be‚Ä¶‚Äù she said on Instagram. Unfortunately for her, there is a chance she may reach that age on the wrong side of prison bars.\n\nMorgan‚Äôs partner, Dutch Lichtenstein, isn‚Äôt quite the same social media presence. He is, however, an alumnus of the prestigious Silicon Valley accelerator program Y Combinator; with that initial funding, he co-founded a data and adtech startup called MixRank which secured funding from Mark Cuban, among others (the company is still active, though Lichtenstein appears to have left in 2016).\n\nOccasionally, Lichtenstein took to Twitter to warn people about the threat of hacks. After a post by one Twitter user saying, ‚Äúwhen you buy an ape on opensea it should pop up a big red warning sign that says never give your seed phrase to anyone, especially m*tamask support,‚Äù Lichtenstein chimed in with approval, saying, ‚ÄúThere really should be a mandatory security tutorial with a test at the end for many crypto assets.‚Äù"
