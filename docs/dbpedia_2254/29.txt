Lais Ribeiro is a Brazilian-born stunner who is no stranger to the catwalk. She began modeling in 2009, just a year after giving birth to her son, Alexandre, and has since become a Victoria's Secret Angel and posed for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. In this episode of Go To Bed With Me, Ribeiro walks us through how she keeps her combination skin perfectly glowy and balanced.

Ribeiro starts by wiping away all her makeup with either a Neutrogena or Pond's face wipe. She then moves on to the Fresh Soy Face Cleanser to make sure all the makeup she was wearing is fully removed. After patting her skin dry, the model applies a foil sheet mask from Estee Lauder. The odd-looking metallic foil traps the anti-aging Advanced Night Repair serum between the mask and your face, so it doesn't prematurely evaporate.

To reduce puffiness, Ribeiro loves to roll her face with the Herbivore Rose Quartz Facial Roller after removing the sheet mask. The model then applies two products from her favorite skincare line iS Clinical: the Youth Complex and Reparative Moisture Emulsion. "Because I have dark skin, I have dark spots and...it's really helpful before...going to bed for the dark spots," she notes.

Though the skin on her face is combination, the model says her body is a little dry. She turns to the best-selling (and best smelling!) Brazilian Bum Bum Cream as a body moisturizer. "It smells really really good. You guys definitely should try," she says.
