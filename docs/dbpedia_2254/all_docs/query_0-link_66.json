        "text": "Though she grew up in a remote and rural town in Brazil, model Lais Ribeiro now calls New York City home.\n\nThe 25-year old Brazilian bombshell––who has walked the runway in fashion shows for Chanel, Rag & Bone, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Roberto Cavallli, Louis Vuitton, and other major brands, and has appeared in numerous ad campaigns for the likes of Gap, Tom Ford, and Ralph Lauren––recently purchased a condo in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nThe 1,279-square-foot apartment at the Slate boasts two bedrooms and two bathrooms, which seems like it would be the perfect fit for her and her young son. It's unknown how much she shelled out for the new pad, but the asking price at one point was $2.49 million. Douglas Elliman's Mark Weinstock was the listing broker.\n\nAside from the tandem of bathrooms and bedrooms, the home houses an open chef’s kitchen, a private balcony, floor-to-ceiling windows, floors made of Brazilian hardwood, limestone and marble accents, and a private storage space. Designed by world-renown architect, Karl Fischer, Ribeiro's new building, which is located at 165 W. 18th Street, has a pet spa, patio, and a gym, which may be ideal for the former tomboy who enjoys sports like boxing, soccer, and volleyball.\n\nThe exotic beauty, who spoke very little English into her late teens, has popped up in the pages of magazines like Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Elle since her modeling debut in 2010.\n\nImages courtesy of the New York Post"
