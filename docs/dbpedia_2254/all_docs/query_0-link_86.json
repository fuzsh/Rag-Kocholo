        "text": "Photographs by Jerome Duran\n\nEco-friendly accessory brand Bottletop has just released its latest campaign, featuring Victoria's Secret model Lais Ribeiro. We caught up with her about why she's involved with the inspiring company, her beauty secrets and how she keeps in such great shape.\n\nHow did you first hear about Bottletop?\n\n\"I first heard about Bottletop through my friend Candice Swanepoel, who was telling me about the work they were doing in Brazil, which is where I'm from and where Candice spends a lot of time.\"\n\nWhat made you want to get involved with the company?\n\n\"I heard first of their up-cycling techniques, the sustainable mission of the brand and that they provide such great opportunities for women and girls in Brazil. Once I met Cameron [Saul, the director], his enthusiasm became contagious and I wanted to be involved somehow.\"\n\nWhy is this cause so close to your heart?\n\n\"There're so many reasons Bottletop means a lot to me: their atelier is in my homestate in Brazil, so knowing that this is teaching a trade and providing opportunities to local women is so good. I also care about our environment and what we're doing to it. The fact that Bottletop is using up-cycled materials to make beautiful accessories, without impacting the environment, is amazing.\"\n\nHow do you choose which brands to work with?\n\n\"I think it's important to work with brands that are committed to social causes, which is why I love working with Bottletop as well as Victoria's Secret, which is very dedicated to raising money to fight cancer.\"\n\nHow important do you think it is to use your high-profile platform to promote charitable or ethical projects?\n\n\"I can't think of anything more important than using my bit of celebrity to promote a charity or social cause. Why be a recognised person if you're not going use it to help others?\"\n\nHow do you prevent yourself from being overworked? What do you do to relax during your downtime?\n\n\"It's tough to not get overworked, regardless of what you do for a living, but I'm learning the art of balancing work with also taking time for myself. My agents are good with keeping in mind that I'm a single mum too, so I'm not always jetting from one place to another. In my downtime, I love spending time with friends – I love game nights or going to a bar to play billiards. I live in New York, so simply walking from a photo shoot to my apartment can suddenly turn into 10 minutes of me-time.\"\n\nHow do you prepare for a photo shoot? Do you have any health or beauty rituals?\n\n\"Well, one of the things about working as a model is that we're always working out, trying to eat as healthily as possible, getting facials, waxing – you name it – so there's no special preparation for a shoot. As for health or beauty rituals, I faithfully wash my face every night. It's as if I'm washing the day away. I also love a massage – it's a great way to deal with jet lag, and if I can't get to a spa – I will do a mud mask at home. My mother always insists on making sure her nails are done – she always says 'Your hands say a lot about you to the people that you meet'.\"\n\nWhat's your go-to workout?\n\n\"I like to mix up my workouts – some boxing, ballet barre, Pilates, but I love to sweat and dance, so have recently started taking dance classes, which is almost like cheating because dancing is so much fun.\"\n\nWhat is the best beauty tip you've ever been given?\n\n\"The best beauty tip I have ever been given was to always moisturise and use sun cream. Another tip was that less is more when it comes to wearing jewellery or applying make-up and to always have a pair of great sunglasses because they will always make you look glamorous.\"\n\n***\n\nMORE FASHION NEWS\n\nThis is the most expensive handbag ever sold\n\nJack Wills' latest advert banned"
