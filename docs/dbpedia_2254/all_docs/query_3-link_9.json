        "text": "Victoria‚Äôs Secret Angel Lais Ribeiro married former Chicago Bulls basketball player Jaokim Noah in a romantic and lavish beachside ceremony in her native Brazil.\n\nRibeiro donned an ethereal white off-the-shoulder A-line bridal gown with a semi-sheer corset bodice, embroidered with delicate floral appliqu√©s cascading down her flowing tulle skirt. The dress was a custom creation from Galia Lahav, which the bride and head designer Sharon Sever spent hours collaborating on, according to the brand.\n\nThe Brazilian beauty carried a luxe bouquet of white flowers, and even incorporated some into her beachy, billowing waves.\n\nNoah donned a white suit with a white flower pinned to the lapel of his jacket. Wearing yellow tinted sunglasses to the ceremony, the groom wore his long hair tied up into a bun. The couple said ‚ÄòI do‚Äô under a floral asymmetrical arch filled with lush greenery.\n\nWhile the groomsmen sported light khaki suits, the bridesmaids (including fellow Victoria‚Äôs Secret models Sara Sampaio and Jasmine Tookes) adorned one-shoulder slinky champagne floor-length custom Galia Lahav gowns. Guests included stars like VS star Candice Swanepoel, who wore a vibrant marigold halter neck gown.\n\nLinked since the summer of 2018, the couple‚Äôs engagement lasted for about three years. Noah popped the question in 2019 at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. Ribeiro posted a sweet snapshot to commemorate the occasion of the pair seen in a loving embrace, hugging under a tent at the festival. ‚Äú@stickity13 surprised me at my fav place in the world and proposed üíç,‚Äù she wrote. ‚Äú And I couldn‚Äôt be happier! We are getting married guys üë∞üíçüòçüíÉüèΩ.‚Äù\n\nA beautiful, blended family, Ribeiro has a 14-year-old son Alexandre from a previous relationship, while Noah is father to two young children, 5-year-old daughter Leia and younger son Emaan, also from a previous relationship. The model posted sweet family photos with all of the children in a carousel on Instagram in honor of Noah‚Äôs birthday in February. ‚ÄúHappy bday to the biggest heart I know. ‚ù§,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt imagine this journey without you. Thank you for your patience, step by step we are building something beautiful and I am so proud of you. Keep inspiring and sharing your light with the world. Te amo picanha ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple!"
