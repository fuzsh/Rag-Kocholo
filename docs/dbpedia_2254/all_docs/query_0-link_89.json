        "text": "Victoria’s Secret Angel Lais Ribeiro to Wear Fantasy Bra at Shanghai Show [Instagram]\n\nLais Ribeiro is the lucky Victoria’s Secret Angel who will wear this year’s fantasy bra at the show taking place Nov. 28 in Shanghai. The 27-year-old Brazilian model has walked in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows since 2010 (except for 2012, when she sprained her ankle during rehearsals) and appeared in numerous campaigns for the brand. This year’s fantasy bra, called Champagne Nights bra, was designed by Mouawad jewelry and is worth $2 million.\n\nCara Delevingne Stars in Burberry Campaign [Pret-a-Reporter Inbox]\n\nBurberry has tapped two It-Brits — Cara Delevingne and actor Matt Smith (The Crown) — to star in the brand’s holiday campaign. Delevingne first worked with Burberry in 2010, and said of “creative genius” Christopher Bailey, “It has been and always will be a joy to work with you and the Burberry family.” Earlier this week, it was announced that Bailey will exit the company at the end of 2018. The ads were photographed by another Brit, Alesdair McLellan.\n\nGiorgio Armani Debuts Exclusive Capsule Collection at Net-a-Porter [Pret-a-Reporter Inbox]\n\nGiorgio Armani is launching an exclusive capsule collection with Net-a-Porter. From now until Dec. 1, the 15-piece selection of daywear and cocktail attire featuring a Japanese-inspired print will be available solely online; after that, it will be available at Giorgio Armani boutiques."
