        "text": "Note from BW of Brazil: It’s been a while since Lais Ribeiro was featured in a story on this blog. In a post from July of 2013, she was the cover feature of the article “Model Laís Ribeiro says companies outside of Brazil ‘are afraid to put a black woman on the cover’ but says nothing about exclusion of black models in Brazil”. She was absolutely right on her observation of how black models are treated on the international fashion scene; I just found it a little strange that she would speak on the situation of black models outside of Brazil when it has been well-documented, including on this blog, that black models often face a ‘blackout’ when seeking exposure on Brazil’s runways.\n\nAnyway, it had been some time since I’d since her face and actually didn’t recognize her when I saw a black woman on the cover of the latest Vogue Brasil magazine. As black women being featured on the cover of Vogue Brasil is so rare anyway, I knew I would do a story on the cover girl whoever she was. Well, as long as she was Brazilian. as it sometimes seems that its easier a non-Brazilian black woman on the cover of Vogue Brasil. Anyway, I haven’t had a chance to check out the photos inside the magazine, but I thought the cover shot was stunning!\n\nLaís Ribeiro featured on the cover of Vogue Brasil of February\n\nLais Ribeiro is the February cover-girl of Vogue Brasil, and was clicked for the latest edition in New York by photographer Greg Kadel, with styling by Pedro Sales, with makeup by Mariel Barrera hair by Nicolas Jurnjack. The executive production was by Ernesto Qualizza, and the magazine hit newsstands last Friday, January 27th.\n\nFor the cover, the Victoria’s Secret angel wears the look of Valentino’s first collection with solo creative direction by Pierpaolo Piccioli, as well as Talento’s jewelry.\n\nLais received a fine homage from stylist Narciso Rodriguez last December. Inspired by the Brazilian, he created a sustainable leather bag from the Amazon and recycled metal for the eco-friendly brand Bottletop, of which the model is an ambassador.\n\n“Lais is one of the most beautiful women in the world. And, more importantly, she’s authentic and has a huge heart,” says Cameron Saul, co-creator of the English brand that encourages artisans from Brazil and Africa.\n\n“I was born in a city full of natural scenery and since I was little I was aware of the importance of the environment,” shares the model, who is from Miguel Alves, located in the state of Piauí.\n\nEngaged, this year she started collaborating with another social project: the Love Together organization, which raises funds for the backlands of the Northeast."
