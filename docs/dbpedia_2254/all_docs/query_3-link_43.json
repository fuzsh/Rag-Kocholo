        "text": "Ask almost any model—aspiring or super—what their dream job is, and chances are they’ll say walking in Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. The only honor higher than earning your wings? Wearing the show’s Fantasy Bra, the diamond-encrusted, multi-million dollar lingerie crafted each year for one very special Angel to wear. This year, 27-year-old Brazilian model Lais Ribeiro will join the likes of Adriana Lima, Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum, and Claudia Schiffer as the lucky recipient of the 2017 Fantasy Bra. “It is just unbelievable,” Ribeiro said. “It is such an honor to be chosen out of 60 models. It is a very special thing.” On Wednesday, Ribeiro was in New York for a dinner in her honor, and of course, the Fantasy Bra itself, flanked by a fleet of bodyguards. Designed and hand-crafted by Switzerland-based jeweler Mouawad, the bra, themed “Champagne Nights,” includes diamonds, yellow sapphires, and blue topaz set in 18 karat gold, weighing more than 600 carats and took almost 350 hours to create. So, it was only fitting that the night’s dinner included a special Champagne pairing as a nod to the sparkling design. “Of course I am,” Ribeiro said when asked if she’s a fan of the bubbly drink. “Who is not? But three glasses, that is it.”\n\nWhen did you find out you would be wearing the bra?\n\nAt the fitting, about a month ago. I was holding the secret for so long. I told my family and my close friends, but I couldn’t really tell anybody.\n\nHow did they reveal it to you?\n\nThey lied, pretty much. I did my first fitting for the first outfit, and the second one, I had a little lingerie and they had the wings, and I was like, “This is awesome, I love the wings.” And then I just felt something come in, and they brought the mannequin in. I was like, “Is this for real?” Then when I saw [the bra] I just started to cry so much. I couldn’t talk. It was such a mix of emotions coming out.\n\nWhat do you think of this year’s design? Is it heavy?\n\nNot at all, because it was molded to my shape. It just fits in, and doesn’t feel heavy. It just goes so well with my skin. I think I need to take it home.\n\nWhat is the strangest thing about wearing $2 million on your body?\n\nI have to bring a bodyguard everywhere. Literally, this is my bodyguard right here.\n\nWhat is your training and workout preparation like now, three weeks from the show?\n\nI think, I’m alright. Before I was really intense, because you obviously want to look your best for the show. But right now, I’m chilling. I did my fitting. I’ll probably get a little intense again about two weeks before.\n\nWhat are you most excited about for the show?\n\nI am excited for the Fantasy Bra, of course, but my dad and my brother, who have never traveled outside of Brazil, are coming to China for the first time ever. That is going to be special for all of us.\n\nRelated: Adriana Lima Reveals How She’s Physically Preparing to Walk in Her 18th Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show\n\nVictoria’s Secret Choreographer Jermaine Browne Demonstrates the Allure of Pole Dancing"
