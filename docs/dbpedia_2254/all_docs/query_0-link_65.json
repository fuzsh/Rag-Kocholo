According to city records, she purchased apartment 3A at the Slate Condominium at 163 West 18th Street for $2.45 million.\n\nTake a look inside here\n\nEthan Hawke’s former Chelsea townhouse lists for $5.98M\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nA four-story Chelsea townhouse once owned by actor Ethan Hawke has hit the market for $5,980,000.
