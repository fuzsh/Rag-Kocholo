        "text": "During the week-long celebration of Carnaval, millions of people emerge onto the streets of Rio de Janeiro as partygoers and musicians dance throughout the Brazilian city. Beyond the showstopping costumes, festive makeup is an absolute must—just ask Piauí-born model Lais Ribeiro, who shared her dream Carnaval look with Vogue on a recent New York afternoon.\n\n“It’s one of my favorites,” Ribeiro says of her playful makeup strategy. “It’s always so happy, with a lot of colors and a lot of glitter.” To prep her face, Ribeiro cleans her skin and applies a hydrating face mask. “Because my skin is so dry, I do moisturize again before my makeup,” she explains while patting on a brightening serum and cream. Lastly, a hydrating essence provides the perfect priming base.\n\n“People take all year long to prepare the costumes,” says the model, who’s attended her fair share of Carnaval experiences. “Everyone uses glitter,” she explains, “so that’s what we’re going to do here today.” For a flawless canvas, Ribeiro mixes a cocktail of two different-colored foundations and pats them in with a Beautyblender. To create the perfect festival-ready eye, the model swipes a reddish shadow onto her lids and a sparkling emerald hue underneath. “As a good Brazilian, you have to put yellow and green in there.”\n\nNext, the model highlights her cheekbones and adds a dab of chunky glitter to the area. “Everybody is covered in glitter,” she says of the Carnaval crowd. “You hug someone, you kiss someone, and you have glitter all over your face. I love it.” Adding to the sparkle appeal, Ribeiro applies a smattering of star- and moon-shaped crystals to her upper eyelid."
