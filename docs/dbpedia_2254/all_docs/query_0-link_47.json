        "text": "While New York Fashion Week is reaching higher levels of diversity on the runway than ever before, many European fashion weeks lag behind and model Lais Ribeiro has had it. The Brazilian beauty keeps busy with her duties as a Victoria’s Secret Angel now a days, but she’s announced she’s not even going to bother with one fashion in particular until it gets real about diveristy. She’s refusing to audition for Milan Fashion Week going forward.\n\n“Of course [representation] has to be better every year, but it still has a ways to go,” Ribeiro explained in a new interview with Coveteur, noting how she’s only one of two Victoria’s Secret Angels at present who are black. “For example, I don’t go to Milan anymore. I used to love Milan, and they’re just like, ‘Oh, we have enough black girls here, you don’t need to come.’ There were two times that they said that, and I was like, ‘Is this for real?’ It has to be better, but it’s a little bit more open for us.”"
