METRO CARS - 01279 - 444.333 www.metro-cars.info Harlow's Metro System GOVERNMENT DELAYS HPA MOVE DECISION By CHRIS MOSS, News Editor chris.moss@hertsessexnews.co.uk THE Health Protection Agency’s proposed move to Harlow has been delayed for at least a year after the Government asked for more work to be done on providing a sound business case for the relocation. Plans to slash overheads by moving part of the HPA from its ageing facil¬ ities in Porton Down, Wiltshire, to the former GlaxoSmithKline site in Flex Meadow were first mooted in 2010, with a final decision expected last year. But ministers considering the £85m proposals - which would see the main elements of the HPA’s microbiology and epidemiology serv¬ ices relocated to New Frontiers Science Park - remain unconvinced about the plan’s value for money and this week asked the Department of Health to provide more evidence to support its business case. News of the delay has frustrated Harlow MP Rob Halfon and senior councillors, who believe the reloca¬ tion would bring \"hundreds\" of new jobs to the town and help enhance its reputation as a centre of scientific excellence. Mr Halfon told the Star: \"I am extremely disappointed the proposals have been hit by further delays. \"There is no doubt in my mind that the relocation of the HPA makes per¬ fect business sense - it would help tackle the rising costs of maintaining the ageing facilities at Porton Down while bringing new jobs and growth to Harlow.\" He dismissed claims made by trade union Unite that the former GSK site was neither safe nor suitable. \"I am one million per cent sure that Harlow is absolutely the right place for the HPA to relocate,\" he said. \"It would perfectly complement our Enterprise Zone status, the Anglia Ruskin MedTech Campus and the National Phenome Centre.” He added: \"Rest assured, I will be doing everything I can to ensure the move goes ahead when Parliament is back in session on September 3.\" Harlow Council leader, Mark Wilkinson echoed Mr Halfon’s resolve and reiterated his authority’s support for the plans. \"We are very disappointed the Government has delayed this deci¬ sion,\" he said. \"The council fully supports the move to Harlow and believes that it would bring many benefits for both the HPA in terms of location and to Harlow in terms of jobs. \"Clearly, the Government has got to get the information it requires from the HPA to enable it to make a deci¬ sion and we hope that this can be done in less than a year.\" _sj Check out all the latest news and views at www.harlowstar.co.uk £] University Centre Harlow Places available for September 2012 Drop in and discover our range of degree courses.

Travelling up the A414 to Chelmsford for the annual event, members of 7th Harlow spent the week rubbing shoulders with Scouts and Guides from as far afield as Australia and Venezuela. The action-packed week fea¬ tured more than 120 adventure activities, a full programme of live music in the evenings, and awareness campaigns on major ethical issues also ran through¬ out to encourage young people to make the right choices. 7th Harlow Scouts young leader Harry Tennison told the Star the Jamboree had been a huge success. \"Eve had so much fun here - there are just so many new things to do with so many new people!\" he said. \"It also helps equip young peo¬ ple with skills that will enhance career prospects as they are offered the chance to experience new roles with different respon¬ sibilities.\" Drunken father who broke woman's jaw is spared prison term A HARLOW thug who fractured a woman’s jaw in what a judge branded a \"wicked and sustained attack\" has been spared jail. Instead father-of-one Phillip Chilcott, of High Street, Old Harlow, was handed a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to Phillipa Turner on December 2 last year. He was also told to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, ordered to pay his victim £1,500 and enrolled in an aggres¬ sion management programme. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that before hitting Ms Turner \"at least 10 times\", Chilcott had also struck a man and another woman who were part of a group of her friends. He admitted assault by beating in respect of both other charges. Nicola May, prosecuting, said Chilcott attacked the group in the Green Park area as they made their way home after a night out in the pub. Miss May told the court: \"They noticed a car parked containing two peo¬ ple with the lights on. “They commented how ‘brave’ they were and joked about how perhaps they were ‘making out’ before Chilcott got out and said: ‘Are you laughing at us?’ \"One of the group, Jack Robinson, who commented ‘what’s your problem?’, found himself confronted and punched on the cheek before he punched Chilcott back, who then got into the car and revved the engine. \"However, he didn’t reverse into them as the group anticipated - instead, he again got out of the car and as he approached, Leane Gleed (another mem¬ ber of the group) asked him to calm down, whereupon she was hit in the face. \"Ms Turner intervened and was punched in the face and when she retali¬ ated, he immediately punched her in excess of ten times around the face area.\" Chilcott later handed himself in to police. Ian Boyes, mitigating, said the defen¬ dant had been studying to be a fully- qualified welder and had displayed \"poor judgement due to an excess of alcohol.\" Mr Boyes continued: \"His temper got the better of him.\" Describing it as \"disgraceful behav¬ iour with alcohol fuelling the flames\", Mr Boyes said Chilcott was in a \"stable\" relationship with a young mum of three. Passing sentence on Thursday, Judge Charles Gratwicke warned Chilcott he would go to prison if he failed to comply with the terms of his sentence. \"People are entitled to go out in the evening to enjoy themselves and make their way home without being set upon by people such as yourself,\" he told the defendant. \"You were quick to take offence and quick to lash out and use violence with¬ out any thought to the consequences.\" >VEI\\T B RIGH T DOMESTIC OVEN CLEANING * Ovens * Agas * Ranges * Hobs * Extractors, etc Using non-caustic, non-toxic products in your home FULLY INSURED & CRB CHECKED 01279 432444 www.ovenbright.co.uk GARAGE DOORS CRAZY SALE MADNESS Top of the range ‘remote controlled’ insulated aluminium rolling garage door, superb product maintenance free.

Ron and Pam Gasson (both 79), of The Chantry, met through mutual friends at the club in Islington at the age of 16, spending three years courting before tying the knot. \"We still laugh about our first date,\" Ron told the Star. \"We went to the pictures, and Pam ended up paying because I didn’t have enough! I was a trainee apprentice back then so money was really tight.\" After spells living in Welwyn Garden City and Suffolk, the couple moved to Harlow in 1966, first living in Barn Mead before moving to a bigger house in Milwards following the birth of their seventh child. \"We certainly had our hands full when we moved here all those years ago,\" Pam said. \"Ron was working as a toolmaker, but I was a full-time mum looking after six kids - and it wasn’t long before we had our seventh!\" Ron, who held jobs at local engineering firms Starfield and Lynar before his retirement, said the happy couple were now looking forward to celebrating their landmark anniversary surrounded by family and friends. \"We’re off to The Three Horseshoes in Spellbrook for a celebratory meal,\" he said. \"I think there’s going to be more than 40 of us there so it will be quite a big do. \"We’re both so happy to have made our diamond anniversary -1 definitely picked the right girl!\" swallow notels^ CHURCHGATE HOTEL MURDER MYSTERY DINNER 3 course meal and interactive murder mystery Saturday 27th October £29.50 TAKE THAT TRIBUTE NIGHT 3 course meal, disco til late Friday 2nd November £33.50 WEDDING OPEN EVENING Thursday 18th October See our stunning venue laid up for your wedding 6.30pm - 9pm SUNDAY LUNCH 3 COURSE LUNCH £9.95 Please call to book your table AFTERNOON TEA SERVED DAILY Contact us for further details or to book 01279 420246 Email events. churchgate @ crerarmgmt. com Churchgate Street Village, Old Harlow CM17 0JT HuntersimiDK KITCHENS 4 August 30, 2012 COMMUNITY CORNER e-mail: star@hertsessexnews.co.uk By VICKY LANE vicky.lane@hertsessexnews.co.uk LIVING on a diet of pasta flavoured with stock cubes and nearly having her fingernails burnt off in the Sahara desert are some of the hardships overcome by a Harlow woman who completed a year-long charity bike trek from London to Cape Town. But it wasn’t all drudgery for former St Mark’s West Essex Catholic School headgirl Loretta White (31) who, with husband Craig and four friends, crossed 27 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa during the 10,000-mile challenge. “This trip has pushed us to our physical and mental limits but it has also been the most incredible adventure,” Loretta told the Star. “We’ve learned that the world is filled with good people and it has been a privilege to experience the kindness of strangers along the way.” Raising money for Cycle Africa, a charity set up by Loretta and Craig to help street children throughout the continent, the group are now over halfway to achieving their £50,000 fundraising target. They have also met the children the money will go on to benefit. “Visiting street children projects in the countries along our route we have seen tiny feet poking out of the bottom of fertiliser bags on the streets of Addis Our 10,000 miles in the saddle to help street kids Ababa and have heard how many children feel safer sleeping in the drains under Africa’s cities but who are then often washed away when it rains. “We have chatted with youngsters while they sniff glue to keep the cold and hunger at bay and we have met the tough kids of Durban, all of whom have been stabbed at least once. “It has been heartbreaking to hear about the terrible things that these children have faced but also inspiring to see how their lives have been transformed by the work of our partner charities who the money we have raised will go towards.” The team, who paid for the trip out of their own pockets so that every penny donated goes towards helping the children, said it was the kindness of strangers that made the biggest impression on them over the year. “The biggest thing we will take from this trip is the incredible generosity of people who have let us camp next to their houses, brought us hot tea on cold nights and who have lifted our spirits when we’ve been struggling,” said Loretta. She added: “We’ve been asked ‘what’s next’ a lot and can comfortably say that there will be very little cycling in the next few months! “We are looking forward to having time to reflect on what we have experienced and to getting back to some normality after such a magical year.” To read more about team Cycle Africa’s adventure or to make a donation to the charity, visit www. cycleafrica. org. Cyclists take the towpath trail to Olympic Park A TEAM of novice cyclists have shown their Olympic spirit after taking on their own sporting challenge in aid of a Harlow disability charity. The group of friends, who all live or work in the town, cycled the 24 miles from Harlow to the Olympic Park in Stratford to raise over £2,500 for Accuro, a charity dedicated to ensuring that those with disabilities are able to participate in everyday pursuits. Spokesperson Sarah Simons (31), of Hull Grove, said friend and charity trustee Gareth Phillips had organised the challenge as he thought it would be a great way to raise awareness and funds for the organisation, \"It was after Gareth saw an article in the Star about the towpath from Harlow being opened up to the Olympic Park that he thought cycling it could be a good fundraiser for the charity,\" she said. \"Although I'm really not a cyclist, I jumped at the chance to join in. I have been hoping to do something for charity for a while, so it was nice to do something with an Olympic theme for such a good cause.\" Narrowly missing afternoon downpours, the group completed the challenge in three-and-a-half hours. Pupils are world record breakers SCORES of schoolchildren from Harlow have officially been recognised as world record-breakers. Pupils from St Albans Academy, Tany’s Dell Primary and Nursery School and Water Lane Primary School were among 114,277 youngsters from across the country who took part in the Guinness World Record attempt for the most people singing and signing a song simultaneously earlier this year. The three schools, who all had to teach themselves to sign and sing a song composed especially for the record attempt, also raised £865.37 for organisers SignHealth, a charity supporting deaf and hearing impaired people. “We are delighted to have broken the world record for the second year running,” said chief executive at the charity Steve Powell. “We organised the sign2sing event to help raise awareness of deafness and the work we do at SignHealth. It was also a fundraiser for the charity and we’re extremely grateful for all the schools’ help as all of the money raised will make a significant contribution to our work.” Plenty of work for volunteers ECOLOGISTS, entertainers, drivers and anyone interested in giving something back to their community are being sought to fill a number of volunteering roles. The Volunteer Centre Harlow has a list of positions for those able to spare a few hours a week. Opportunities range from helping street collections for St Clare Hospice, providing company for elderly residents at various social clubs and a recycling researcher role. “Volunteering has all-round benefits, not just making a difference to your community, but the chance try something new, make friends and develop confidence,” said manager Della Nash.

Officers from Essex Police’s Armed Response Unit swooped on the address in Ram Gorse at around 6.30pm after shocked residents witnessed the fight - which involved two men - spill out onto their street. But after surrounding the property and cordoning off the road, police smashed in the front door to find that both suspects had already fled. However, a samurai sword believed to have been brandished during the altercation was recovered during the raid and taken as evidence. One stunned resident, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Star: \"It was unbelievable - like a scene from a Hollywood film. \"The road was swarming with armed police, and officers carrying machine guns had their weapons trained at the front of the property as they shouted for the occupants to come out and surrender their weapons. \"After they got no response, a group of them approached the front door and smashed it in before running into the flat. \"A little while later they came out and it soon became clear that no one had actually been inside, although it looked as though they’d found the sword used during the fight.\" He added: \"You couldn’t fault the police for their response - they got to the flat in lightning quick time and had cordoned off the area in minutes. It was an unbelievably slick operation. \"It was just a shame they didn’t catch the two idiots responsible - hopefully it will only be a matter of time.\" Police are appealing for anyone who wit¬ nessed the fight or with any information to contact investigating officers on 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. ON HIGH: Stilt-walking lobsters were among the attractions at The Water Gardens’ family fun day on Saturday Sting in the tail for some of fun day's attractions! RAIN couldn’t stop play as families flocked to The Water Gardens to enjoy the shopping centre’s fun day on Saturday. Stilt-walkers, caricaturists and fortune-tellers were among the attractions at the annual event, which also featured a traditional Punch & Judy show and a wildlife tent where brave visitors could get to grips with spiders, snakes, scorpions and birds of prey. Centre manager Beryl Murphy told the Star: \"We are delighted with how the day went - it was very well supported by the community and incredibly rewarding to see so many families enjoying the events. \"There are also some very brave people in Harlow who were able to pick up the scorpion in the wildlife tent - rather them than me!\" sword fight Tyre fire sends smoke over site ESSEX County Fire & Rescue Service received around 20 calls on Tuesday night after thick black smoke was seen over a traveller’s site. But fears that a major fire was spreading across the site in Fern Hill proved unfounded after firefighters arrived on the scene shortly before 7.10pm to find a stack of tyres alight. Using two hose reel jets and foam, crews managed to extin¬ guish the blaze within 40 minutes. The cause of the fire is now under investigation. i pc\"repa7rs 1 I • FREE On-site Visits ® I • Laptop & Mac Repairs I I • Internet / Wireless Setup I I • Networking Home / Bus I I • Virus & Pass.

You can also call them on 01892 525273 or email copy@nla.co.uk SIR, The letter from Ron Bill (Star, August 16) touched a raw nerve, reminding us all of the sporting facilities lost to our town in the last few years. Every area of the town had school holiday playschemes with lots of sports and games. But most of all we lost our wonderful dry ski slope, used not only by our own local schools and inhabitants but even those far afield. It was also used by the many British Disabled Ski Team members, some of whom took part in the Paralympics and won medals. With the help of The Presidents Club it offered ski scholarships to disabled youngsters, many of whom won medals on courses abroad. The benefits, both physical and mental, to those taking part were immeasurable As your headline at the time stated, the ski slope was “sacrificed on the altar of politics”. We may restore other sporting facilities to the town but I cannot imagine enough money or space could be found which might justify creating another slope equally good with such excellent and dedicated qualified instructors. Verica Peacock Burnett Park, Harlow Government reform of council tax system is unfair and unjust SIR, I would like an opportunity to reply to John Wake’s letter (Star, August 23). What he quotes from the council’s press release is the Government's opinion in introducing the new council tax system. It is not mine. Photo of the READER Bill Hopkins took this picture of two cygnets hitching a ride with their mum on the River Stort. \"I was cycling along the river bank with my family when we saw two adult swans and noticed the mother swan carrying her young on her back,\" writes Bill, of Westfield, Harlow. \"This is just one of the amazing sights you can see whilst cycling along the Stort.\" # Do you have a photograph taken in Harlow that you think is good enough to feature in the Photo of the Week section? If so, we would love to see it. Email a high resolution copy in jpeg format along with a brief description of your photograph along with when and where it was taken and your name and address to: star@hertsessexnews.co.uk. Please insert 'Photo of the Week' in the subject line of your email. It may surprise him to learn that I agree with many of the sentiments he expressed in his letter. The introduction next year of this iniquitious new tax will be upon some of the most vulnerable and poorest members of society. I have already had representations from people about their inability to pay. In many ways this is shaping up like the old poll tax 20 years ago. One person suffered a stroke seven years ago, is unable to work and is still well below retirement age. However, this person will probably be caught out by these new Government directives. While income tax on the richest members of society is cut by lOp in the £1, the Gover nm ent expects the poorest and most vulnerable in the community to pay up to £300. This cannot be fair or just. I hope spirited people like Mr Wake will make full respresentations about this. The council has a website and email address to make these views known. Alternatively, letters can be sent to the Benefits Section of Harlow Council at the Civic Centre.

We are dog owners ourselves and always carry disposable bags to pick up our dog’s waste, but our walks are constantly marred by the numerous amounts of mess that is accumulating daily because of less conscientious dogs owners failing to do the same. It is bad enough that we have to be vigilant to dodge stepping in this mess and we can only imagine the nightmare if you are trying to enjoy a walk with children. Please, dog owners, be responsible and consider others who want to enjoy the fabulous walks around Harlow, Name amd address supplied I'm sorry if my garden fires have caused any offence SIR, In response to a letter about garden bonfires (Star, August 16), I am disabled and so live in a bungalow. The garden I inherited from the previous owner had not been looked after for many years and during heavy winds some trees came down. The council will not take trees even when you pay and if you go to the tip there is no help for disabled people. There are steps that I could not use so what do you do in this situation? It’s okay for people who can afford a private gardener to take away all their unwanted stuff but I am not one of them. I always check there is no washing out and no people about as best I can. I have only had two fires this year but I take on board what was said by your correspondent and will not burn any more trees. Many of the people in my area have bonfires but it’s give and take in this world and it does not bother me. If I have offended anyone I am truly sorry. Some people will flytip but I am too responsible to do this. I will now spend hours cutting up the trees up to a size the council will take. Annmarie Joyce Pittmans Field, Harlow Shortsighted approach to housebuilding must change SIR, News from the National Housing Federation shows that, due to the slump in housebuilding over the past decade, the average UK house price has risen to £236,000, making it all but impossible for a generation to ever hope to own their own house. The alternative of renting has also become too expensive for most. It says that to correct this situation 250,000 new homes a year are needed, while in 2010 - 11 only 98,000 were completed. This is a continuation of the ‘perfect storm’ created by government, particularly since 1997, where the illusion of wealth created by massive rises in house values led millions into debt. At the same time uncontrolled immigration swallowed up private rental accommodation. In the aftermath of this storm, there were loud calls from all quarters to allow more housebuilding, yet when developers are prepared to risk dipping into an uncertain market they are met with concerted opposition from residents who don’t want additional housing in their back yard, and politicians more concerned about votes than local and national need. This shortsighted approach must change. Housebuilding need not be a blight. In fact, as Harlow bears witness from Church Langley and Newhall, it brings wealth to the local economy, diversity in terms of local demographics, new schools and other services, new businesses and employment, and new people - many of whom are young and entrepreneurial, and they pay local taxes. As councillors we have a duty to see beyond the immediate future, not be put off by the inevitable protests, and be prepared to facilitate appropriate development rather than to look for ways to oppose it. Of course it is also the duty of councillors and MPs to represent the views of constituents, but they must do so in a way which balances those views with the dire local and national situation.

Organised in conjunction with World Horse Welfare, the British Horse Society and local horse charity Redwings, the horse wel¬ fare day at Latton Common saw 21 horses from across the town checked by a vet, wormed and microchipped. Horse owners were also given the opportunity to register their horses for passports, receive fur¬ ther veterinary advice and sign up their animal for a regular worm¬ ing programme. \"Working with other organisa¬ tions we hold regular events to ensure that tethered horses in the town are being looked after,\" explained councillor Emma Toal, portfolio holder for youth and citi¬ zenship. \"All horses were given a health check by vets and experts were on hand to give owners information and advice on looking after their horses.\" Doggy day out at annual show PAMPERED pooches and scruffy mutts are being called upon to strut their stuff in the Pets’ Corner Annual Dog Show this Sunday. The ‘open to all’ fun day at Pets’ Corner in the town park aims to celebrate Harlow’s hounds whilst giving owners the opportunity to show in one or more of the eight classes. Categories being judged - which can be entered on the day - include cutest puppy, prettiest bitch, most handsome dog, scruffiest mutt, junior handler, ‘waggiest’ tail, dog the judge would most like to take home and the champion of cham¬ pions. In addition to the dog show the wildlife centre is hosting a variety of stalls and entertainment activi¬ ties throughout the day, which runs from 11am to 5pm, including a mini fairground, falconry dis¬ play, doggy agility course and trac¬ tor rides.

The local Muslim community, who meet at the Harlow Islamic Centre in Paringdon Road, presented the provisions to Harlow Foodbank during their Community Iftar - or ‘breaking of the fast’ - which commemo¬ rates the end of the Holy month. Members of the food charity and local dignitaries including Harlow Council leader Mark Wilkinson and chair Maggie Hulcoop then joined in with the religious ritual which follows a programme of Qu’ranic prayer recitals and food. Islamic Centre spokesperson Ajaib Hussain told the Star: \"It was a pleasure to be part of the team who put this event together and see all sections of the commu¬ nity enjoying themselves. \"We are especially pleased to work with Harlow Foodbank in supporting the local community and people in crisis with this food donation and look forward to doing more in the future.\" : • VT* ' By CHRIS MOSS, News Editor chris.moss@hertsessexnews.co.uk A BUILDING firm has been fined £2,500 after an unwanted bathroom suite was fly-tipped in Harlow. In a prosecution Fought by Harlow Council at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, west Herts-based company Acumen Building Contractors Ltd admitted failing to ensure that waste from a refurbishment job in London had been disposed of legally. The charge related to an incident in September last year, when the firm contracted an individual to revamp a bathroom at a proper¬ ty in London. The quotation for the job included a price for the removal and disposal of the old bathroom suite, which was then sub-contracted to another individual. But instead of disposing of it legally, the man - who was not named in court - drove the sink, toilet and other rubbish all the way to Harlow before dumping it in two loads in Latton Common Road and Longwood. A subsequent investigation by the council’s Community Safety Team discovered that the two fly-tips were linked and that Acumen Building Contractors were involved. In court, the company was fined £2,500 (plus a £15 victim’s surcharge), with Harlow Council awarded costs of £500. In pleading guilty to the offence, the firm accepted it had some liability as the main con¬ tractor and admitted no enquiries had ever been made about the waste and what would happen to it. Speaking after the hearing, councillor Emma Toal, portfolio holder for youth & citizenship, said: \"Harlow Council spends around £lm a year of taxpayers’ money cleaning up after oth¬ ers, and keeping the town clean is a priority for residents. \"It is irresponsible people and rogue traders that mess up our town and it is Harlow taxpay¬ ers that pick up the tab every time. \"The size of this fine should send out a warn¬ ing to companies that Harlow is not a dumping ground and that if they are in anyway responsi¬ ble we will track them down. \"Thanks to the hard work of our Community Safety Team we managed to track down one of the parties responsible for this rubbish and we are currently prosecuting the other sub contac¬ tor involved.\" Residents can help with the fight against fly- tipping by reporting the make, colour and regis¬ tration of any vehicle involved and the location, time and date of the incident to Contact Harlow on (01279) 446655, or via contact@harlow .gov.uk.

Animals ranging from giant tortoises to barn owls entertained the crowds at the Stort Valley Harlow Wildlife Day, which was organised by voluntary group Harlow Wildlife Projects in conjunction with Harlow Council and a number of local nature groups. The event was part of celebrations for the official opening of the revamped footpath and bridge network along the town’s river¬ side towpaths, which have been re-routed around boggy areas and made wheelchair friendly to ensure the site is accessible all year round. Financed by a Big Lottery Fund Community Spaces grant, the seven-month development completes phase one of the Harlow Wildlife Projects group’s Stort Valley Meadows - Access for All project, which aims to eventually create a ‘wetlands discovery centre’ in the area. By VICKY LANE vicky.lane@hertsessexnews.co.uk The new network was formally opened by Jon Clempner, Harlow Council’s portfolio holder for environment, who said: \"Harlow Wildlife Projects, with the help of funding from the Big Lottery Fund, and the work of many fantastic volunteers have completed and renewed footpaths and bridges, as well as adding information boards, to make the Stort Valley Meadows accessible to all. \"It was an honour to cut the ribbon on the new walkways and I will certainly be mak¬ ing regular use of them myself!\" Phase two of the project - which will be funded by water firm Veolia and the Stansted Airport Community Trust - begins this autumn and will see the creation of new reedbeds and open water areas for wading birds.

Wiggly pal: Andrew Tomlinson and Jazmine Pryor (4) with a wormery pic:har85425o www.harlowstar.co.uk NEWS August 30, 2012 9 STUDENTS across Harlow celebrated another bumper set of GCSE results as the town’s five secondary schools all reported year- on-year improvements in exam performance. Despite concerns over tougher marking, particularly in the core subject of English, hard-working youngsters recorded some of the best results ever posted by Harlow schools. Top of the class for the second year running was Burnt Mill Academy, where 72 per cent of students picked up five or more A*- C grades including English and Maths - a 16 per cent increase on last year. Among the star performers were Dana Moss who was awarded 7A* grades, 1A and 4 distinctions, Jessamine Stonehouse (6A*, 1A, IB, 2 distinctions, 2 merits) and Kelly Flanagan (6A*,3A, IB, 2C, 2 distinctions), while Year 8 students Harry Grace and Jack Shury both took their GCSE maths exams early and gained A* and A grades respectively. Headteacher Helena Mills has overseen a remarkable transformation at the First Avenue school since taking charge just three years ago, when the A*-C pass rate stood at just 27 per cent. “I am absolutely delighted with these results and congratulate all our students, staff and parents who have worked so hard,” she said. “This is an outstanding achievement for these young people and it shows how far we have come as a school, achieving way above national averages. “Our children and the children of Harlow are entitled to the best support, the best teaching and the best results which will give them every opportunity to access the best sixth forms and universities.” Stewards Academy also celebrated its best- ever GCSE results, with more than 50 per cent of studentst achieving five or more GCSE A*-C grades including English and maths. Jack Baldwin posted the best grades of any Stewards pupil in the school’s history, gaining 14 A* and 3 A grades to add to the two C grades he had already secured in Year 9. Headteacher Rhonda Murthar said: “These results recognise all the hard work which pupils and staff have put in over a significant period of time.” St Mark’s West Essex Catholic School head Elaine Heaphy expressed her delight at the efforts of her GCSE students after 60 per cent achieved the national gold standard of 5 or more A*-C grades including English and maths. Eleven high achievers - Megan Wood, Nirmal Petson, Anna Bakalarczyk, Sanjana Singh, Samuel Robinson, Thomas Mulligan, James Mortimer, Scott Menzies, Elizabeth Henderson, Louise Orme and Saffron Lawrence - picked up an impressive 14 or more grades at A*-C. “We are absolutely delighted with our GCSE results,” she said. “They represent some of our best-ever student performances, with 60 per cent of the students gaining 5 or more A*-C grades with English and mathematics. “I am delighted for the students. They should be proud of their achievements and I wish them all the best for their future endeavours.” Passmores Academy also celebrated its best-ever set of results after a record- breaking 66 per cent of students achieved five or more A*-C grades including maths Exam students set new school records By CHRIS MOSS, News Editor chris.moss@hertsessexnews.co.uk and English - a 16 per cent improvement on last year. Top performers included Lauren Parker, who notched up 12A*/A grades, Tom Cunningham (10 A*/As), Pandora Domin- iak (9A*/As) and Gabriella Burton (8A*/As). A number of students also sat their AS exams early, recording an impressive overall pass rate of 90 per cent between them. Headteacher Vic Goddard said: “Being able to give out the results to our students knowing that they have achieved the grades required to take the next step in their lives is amazing. “What makes that even more satisfying is knowing that throughout their journey at Passmores they have also been given the opportunities to excel at sport, drama, dance, art and so many other things.” He added: “To see the results across the town going against the national trend and making big improvements is great for Harlow.” Mark Hall School also reported year-on- year improvements in exam performance, with pupils achieving an overall A - E pass rate of 98 per cent. Top performers included Liam Barrett, Elbe Matthews, Martell Brighten and Ellis Singleton. Headteacher Jane Hadlow said that particular success had been recorded in maths, science and modern languages. “We are delighted with our overall pass rate for GCSEs; achievement in most subjects has seen an increase on last years’ results. “We have seen very strong performances from a number of our students, some of whom have achieved over 15 A* - C grades at GCSE.” She added: “Staff and students have shown an enthusiasm, commitment and dedication to their studies that has been rewarded with some excellent results.” From 1st September TO CELEBRATE OUR 30TH ANNIVERSARY Take advantage of some unbeatable offers on all our bathroom suites and accessories Wa ro i3af(n ro^rvo Ccnfrcjl^ Find us at 4 Star Street, Ware, Herts SGI 2 7AA Open: Mon-Sat 9am-5pm Tel: 01920 468664/466664 Email: sales@warebathrooms.co.uk www.warebathrooms.co.uk The best bathroom showroom in the South East UP TO 30 % OFF 10 August 30, 2012 NOSTALGIA e-mail: star@hertsessexnews.co.uk arm yourself with some new skills New courses available now from Adult Community Learning Lots of interesting subjects to choose from... you may be eligible for a free course Find out more at our Information and Enrolment Evening (5-9pm) Weds 5 Sept - Rivermill, Hodings Road Harlow CM20 1NW Enrol on the evening and receive a 10% discount tel: 0845 603 7635 visit: www.essex.gov.uk/adultlearning Essex County Council STAR IN YOUR OWN MOVIE... ...and see it on the big screen!

Former trader Karen Taylor, whose mum Carol ran underwear stall Carol’s Corner and whose father Mick was manager of the market for a number of years, thought the chap in the picture standing at the counter enjoying a drink was flower stall holder Steve Webb, who sadly passed away three years ago. Not so, according to Nicola Wood, of Potter Street, who got in touch with an alternative ID. “The man in the photo is my dad, Garry Wood, at the approximate age of 18,” she said. “The photo was taken around 1973 when he was working on a small motorbike parts stall on the market owned by a man called Dennis McHarris, who is no longer alive.” Nicola said it was a Saturday job for her father who, after working in mechanics for most of his life, is now a warehouse employee for supermarket chain Tesco. “He has told me the photo has jogged his memory of the day it was taken,” Nicola added. “He didn’t know whether he should stay in the shot or not!” Former market trader Lea Brock got in touch after reading Karen’s account to make a slight correction. “Market Micky was better known on the market as ‘Mick the knickers’ because he sold ladies lingerie,” she explained. “I know because my husband Ray had a stall and later a custom-made mobile showroom selling window blinds which we manufactured in Enfield in our workrooms adjacent to our showrooms. “He sold and fitted window blinds from Harlow market for 34 years. We believe that we were the first company to sell window blinds from a market stall.” Lea said they will always remember the day when Window Wize Blinds secured what was, at the time, the largest awning contract ever awarded in the country. “Window Wize Blinds won the contract to supply and fit over 150 awnings on Harlow market,” she said. “After the tenders had been submitted, three companies were invited to erect a trial awning for a year to test their durability and Window Wize Blinds won the contract!” % Do you have stories or photos of Harlow Market from days gone by?

T ravelling along First Avenue, it is hard to miss the futuristic Solo Flight sculpture standing opposite the picturesque 15th century St Mary at Latton Church. It was designed by artist Antanas Brazdys in 1979 following a request from Harlow's masterplanner Sir Frederick Gibberd. But did you know it hasn't always stood on the First Avenue site? 1 The stainless steel 1 sculpture, dubbed | 'the great bird', was originally part of a water feature in the Harvey Centre shopping complex when it was built in 1980. According to John Graham of the Friends of Harlow Sculpture and The Gibberd Garden Trust, the huge size of the piece - it measures nearly eight metres high and over six metres wide - meant that the entrance to the Harvey Centre from West Square could not be completed until it was installed. \"I thought that it was in position for good or at least until the building was demolished,\" he writes. \"However, after several decades of it dominating the central mall the new owners decided to remove it to make way for a central lift.\" According to John, Solo Flight had to be cut into pieces to get it out of the building and an engineer was hired to weld it back together again and strengthen it against the elements. The Harlow Art Trust decided on its current location and later dedicated the statue to trustee and former Harlow councillor Sonia Anderson. \"After a chequered history the great bird has finally come to rest,\" said John. \"Or will it take off again some day?\" From the Star 25 years ago Vigilante patrols to combat ” vandalism and noise from late-night revellers leaving Cheeks nightclub are being planned by Old Harlow residents. However, police have warned them not to take the law into their own hands. At a meeting at the club, residents spoke of their misery following a particularly disruptive weekend. A schoolboy jumped over the spectator barrier and into Harlow Pool fully clothed to help a young swimmer in trouble. Although lifeguards had already got the young boy to safety, the would-be-rescuer was still rewarded with a free ticket for the aquatubes.

(Bishops Stortford store only) music test By CHRIS MOSS, News Editor chris.moss@hertsessexnews.co.uk THOUSANDS of music lovers flocked to Harlow Town Park over the Bank Holiday Weekend to rock out to the town’s first major music festival in decades. Almost 6,000 people braved the unpre¬ dictable weather on Saturday and Sunday to attend Linkfest In The Park, which featured a packed programme of up-and-coming tal¬ ent, established local bands and top tribute acts. The line-up was split into two themed days, with local acts including funk-metal loons Papa Shango, anthemic indie tykes Three Day Weekend and psych-rockers Deviant Amps playing the Saturday and cov¬ ers bands Sax On Fire, Repertoire Dogs, Billy Goes West and Sounds Of Weller among the groups featuring on Sunday’s ‘family day’. The free festival was the first major event staged on the Bandstand since Great Parndon Community Association took over responsibility for Harlow Council’s Events Service in April this year - and organiser Jamie Pring told the Star he hoped its suc¬ cess would help pave the way for more. \"I’m so happy everything went smoothly - even though the weather wasn’t ideal on the Saturday, we still had close to 1,000 peo¬ ple turn out,\" he said. \"Most of the crowd were stayers and even when the heavens opened they only retreated under a tree until the showers stopped then all came back out again! \"Sunday was obviously bigger thanks to the weather and we had around 5,000 party¬ ing over the day - the atmosphere was fan¬ tastic. \"Every single performer over the course of the weekend stepped up to the plate and many produced their finest performances to date.\" Jamie said the event’s Facebook page had \"gone mad\" since the weekender came to a close on Sunday night, with hundreds of messages of thanks posted by festival-goers. \"People are already saying they can’t wait until next year and many have posted some terrific pictures of their friends and families having a ball. \"I think it's safe to say the response is a big message to us that this is the kind of thing they want in the park and we are already now making plans for future events. He added: \"I’d like to give a massive thanks to everybody in the team who gave their time and worked amazingly hard to put this on and produce a truly memorable weekend.\" £3,000,000 STOCK FOR IMMEDIATE DISPOSAL Clarins, Clinique, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Dior, Chanel, Phase Eight, Eastex, Alexon, Superdry, Playtex, Triumph, Jane Shilton, Radley, Guess, Hunter, Fitflop, Aubrey, Fiorelli, Gant, Tommy Hilfiger, North Face, Crew, Barbour, Samsonite, Antler, Denby, Portmeirion, Prestige, Stellar, Sabatier, Le Crueset, Dartington, Sanderson, Christy, Cath Kidston, Kylie, Bedeck, Harlequin, Nimbus, Snuggledown, Myers, Relyon, Hypnos, Slumberland, Lego, V Tech, Galt, etc...

Alfred Lord Tennyson may have thought so, but Harlow Theatre Company will let audiences make up their own minds when the group stages a bold new revue exploring love and death at Victoria Hall Theatre next week. Featuring play excerpts, poems, songs and sketches, Love, Death & The Whole Damn Thing promises to be a thought-provoking - and frequently hilarious - musing on the human condition. The brainchild of HTC stalwart Bernard Moule, who also directs, the show will be the first revue performed by the group since relocating to Victoria Hall Theatre from The Playhouse. “The great thing about a revue is that there will always be something in there that every audience member will enjoy,” the director told the Star. “If you go out to the theatre to watch a play and for whatever reason can’t seem to get into it, then you’re in for a very long evening. But with a revue you’re bound to connect with something. “We used to perform quite a few during our time at The Playhouse but have never staged one at Victoria Hall. Hopefully this can kick-start something of a revival.” According to Bernard, the idea first took root when he played Guildernstern in Tom Stoppard’s existentialist tragicomedy Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead early on in his am-dram career. “It was a part that made a real impression on me,” he said. “When I later played Pontius Pilate in Dennis Potter’s Son Of Man, the idea of putting together a revue exploring love and death really began to grow and now I’ve finally got around to acting on it!” Extracts from both plays will feature in the revue, which the director was at pains to point out would not be a gloomy affair despite its central themes. “If there is something tinged with sadness then the next piece will be uplifting - everything will be done in quick succession so the whole show will be quite fluid,” he said. “There’s plenty of food for thought in the material we’ll be performing, but there will also be plenty of laughs. “After all, I want audiences to thoroughly enjoy themselves, not cry themselves to sleep!” # Love, Death & The Whole Damn Thing opens at Victoria Hall Theatre next Thursday (Septmber 6) and runs for three nights. Performances start at 8pm and tickets cost £10 (£8 concessions) from (01279) 420062 or 07973 679364. School's out but lessons continue for dance kids BUDDING young performers spent some of their school holidays sharpening their dance moves after taking part in a Harlow dance school’s intensive summer course. Almost 80 youngsters ranging in age from four to 15 worked up a sweat during the week-long course run by husband-and-wife team Scott and Victoria Simpson at Makin’ Steps. Their hard work culminated in two shows staged for friends and family at the Potter Street Community Centre. Those taking part spent the week making friends and perfecting routines in a range of dance disciplines, including street, hip-hop, ballet, tap and modern. Scott said he had been extremely impressed with the aptitude shown by his young pupils. “The week was so much fun and they worked extremely hard to learn and perfect the numbers ready for the shows,” he said. “As well as learning them, they also had quick changes to contend with and for some it was the first time they had performed on stage. “Victoria and I were so very proud of them all. They showed real professionalism and their hard work really paid off. “It was nice to see so many smiling faces, not only on stage but in the audience, too!” »what’s on Victoria Hall Theatre Bury Road, Old Harlow ( 01279 ) 420062 »variety Expect the unexpected as some of the town's most weird and wonderful acts battle it out in the grand final of Harlow's Got Talent tomorrow (Friday).

THE PCC: WE WILL LOOK INTO YOUR CONCERNS * PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION , 18 August 30, 2012 e-mail: star@hertsessexnews.co.uk cinema TOTAL RECALL certificate 12a, 1h58m THE human brain is capable of processing hundreds of billions of instructions every second, putting to shame many supercomputers. But like those supercomputers, the brain is susceptible to viruses and corruption. False memories can be planted - without any malicious intent: an older family member recounts a hilarious anecdote from our formative years and without any evidence to the contrary, we 'create' an image in the mind's eye to match their perception. The complexities of the brain, and the ease with which it can be tricked, are the central theme of Total Recall , a testosterone-fuelled remake of the 1990 Paul Verhoeven action adventure inspired Punctuated by thrilling action set pieces set to Harry Gregson-Williams's bombastic score, Len Wiseman's film barely pauses for breath to worry about characterisation as preposterous twist follows outrageous turn. Fans of the Arnold Schwarzenegger version will be two steps ahead of the screenwriters, but directorial brio and eye-popping special effects hold our interest when there is nothing on screen to fire our little grey cells. In the late 21st century, Earth is a radioactive wasteland apart from two outposts on opposite sides of the planet: the prosperous United Federation of Britain ruled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston) and the polluted, rain-saturated Colony, home to millions of workers and the underground resistance led by Matthias (Bill Nighy). Factory worker Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) lives in this hellhole with his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) and travels to work in the UFB with best friend Harry (Bokeem Woodbine) via The Fall: a giant elevator running close to the Earth's core which links the two settlements. Unfulfilled and frustrated, Doug visits Rekall, a shadowy company which promises to realise clients' dreams by implanting artificial memories. In Doug's case, he wants to be a super spy. Shortly before the procedure takes hold, Rekall technician McClane (John Cho) discovers that Doug's memory has been wiped. In the blink of an eye, the factory worker's world implodes and he goes on the run in the company of rebel agent Melina (Jessica Biel). Total Recall is bombastic fun so long as you disengage your brain and submit to the gargantuan leaps in logic. THE EXPENDABLES 2 Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his team - including Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li) and Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) - accept a new assignment from Mr Church (Bruce Willis). But what begins as a routine mission descends into bloodshed when rival mercenary Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) murders a member of the Expendables. Grief soon turns to rage and the Expendables recruit two new members - Billy The Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Yu Nan) - to boost their chances against Vilain and his thugs. With heavy hearts and even heavier artillery, Barney and co venture into enemy territory, determined to honour the memory of their fallen comrade. THE BOURNE LEGACY The beginning of the film overlaps with the final chapter of The Bourne Ultimatum and the moment Bourne goes public about the government's intelligence programmes. The clandestine organisation known as Outcome is deemed infected and everybody associated with it has to be extinguished. But soldier/spy Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) and Dr Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), a genetic scientist who was involved with the development of drugs used by the operatives, escape and must embark on a global adventure in an attempt to outrun the bad guys. BRAVE (3D & 2D) King Fergus of Clan DunBroch (voiced by Billy Connolly) and his wife Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) plan to marry off their daughter Merida (Kelly Macdonald) to the first¬ born son of one of the other clans. However, Merida disrupts the Highland Games designed to test the suitors and then flees into the forest where she encounters a witch (Julie Walters), who gives her an enchanted cake which turns Queen Elinor into a bear. The princess fears her father will kill her mother in her fearsome new form, so mother and daughter head into the wilderness to break the spell. TED A Christmas wish brings the teddy bear belonging to a boy called John Bennett (Bretton Manley) to life. Fast-forward to the present day and John (Mark Wahlberg) now works for a car rental company and has a beautiful girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis). When their four-year anniversary dinner ends in a fractious discussion about priorities, John responds by asking the talking toy to move out of the apartment and stand on his own two paws. DR SEUSS' THE LORAX Twelve-year-old Ted Wiggins (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in the carefully controlled utopia of Thneed-ville where town mayor Aloysius O'Hare (Rob Riggle) provides the residents with all they need, including blissful sunshine - everything except for real plants, which are manufactured in a factory. When girl next door Audrey tells him she wants to see a real tree growing in the backyard of her home, Ted sets off on a mission during which he meets forest guardian The Lorax (Danny DeVito) who tells him the mayor doesn't want real trees restored to Thneed-ville because the miracle of photosynthesis would jeopardise his lucrative oxygen supply business. Aware of the perils that lay ahead, Ted resolves to bring green back to Thneed-ville and win Audrey's heart. THE DARK KNIGHT RISES The Caped Crusader is a fading memory and crippled billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a virtual recluse, holed up in his manor with trusty butler Alfred (Michael Caine). But then an encounter with wily cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) draws Bruce into the orbit of hulking terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) who plans to destroy the city. As Bane's uprising gathers momentum, Bruce turns to technical genius Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and loyal board member Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) to protect his beloved Wayne Enterprise but realises he must don his cowl one final time to save the residents of Gotham. »films for kids showing on Saturday morning JOURNEY 2: THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND A boy and his stepfather set off on a mission to find his grandfather, who is thought to be missing on a mythical island.

But with plastic pink flamingos and lawnmower races in the mix, can this young couple find lasting happiness?
