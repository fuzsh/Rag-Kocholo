        "text": "First-stage Report of the Council on the construction of the National Centre for Propulsion and Power and re-development of the Whittle Laboratory\n\nThe Council begs leave to report to the University as follows:\n\n1. In this Report the Council is seeking approval in principle for the construction of a new National Centre for Propulsion and Power and re-development of the Whittle Laboratory at West Cambridge as set out below.\n\n2. The Whittle Laboratory has been successful in securing funds from the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) and various industrial partners to establish a new experimental facility at Cambridge to serve as a National Centre for Propulsion and Power. The Whittle Laboratory has a distinguished record of translating fundamental research into design technologies which have been incorporated in many types of commercial aircraft engines. The resulting increases in efficiency, given the number in commercial service, has given savings in fuel burn and carbon emissions amounting to many times that incurred by building the proposed new facility. The aim of the Centre is twofold: to change radically the technology transfer process in aerospace and turbomachinery science; and to develop new technologies with the aim of decarbonising the propulsion and power sector.\n\n3. The new facility will be located adjacent to the existing Whittle Laboratory on the West Cambridge site. As part of the project, existing accommodation for the Whittle Laboratory will be upgraded and expanded to provide new workshops and offices and the current single-storey office accommodation will be demolished. In total, approximately 3,550m2 (gross internal area) of new building will be added to approximately 2,100m2 (gross internal area) of retained laboratories and workshops. The investment will include a Propulsion and Power Challenge Space. This space will allow the wider University and industry to co-locate and to take on the challenge of decarbonising the propulsion and power sector. The Centre will work in partnership with the University’s Carbon Neutral Futures Initiative.\n\n4. The capital cost of the proposed development is approximately £44m including the specialist equipment for the National Centre for Propulsion and Power. A grant of £13.5m has been secured from the ATI. £2m is expected to be secured from various industrial partners. An allocation of £5m has been committed by the University. At least £10m of the remaining funds are expected to be raised from external sources with the balance underwritten by the University. The costs of loose furniture and equipment and IT and AV costs will be funded by the Department of Engineering. As part of the investment the industrial partners have agreed £8m in direct support for research.\n\n5. The construction works are planned to commence in 2021 and to be completed by December 2022. The works will include infrastructure enhancements to support the project and align with the West Cambridge Master Plan. These infrastructure works will be funded separately as a charge on the West Cambridge Infrastructure account.\n\n6. The Concept Case for the project was approved by the Planning and Resources Committee on 22 May 2019. Further details relating to the design, maintenance, recurrent costs and proposals for funding will be brought to future meetings of the Buildings Committee and the Planning and Resources Committee. A Full Case will be prepared and a Second-stage Report will be published in due course to seek approval to implement the project.\n\n7. A plan indicating the location of the project is below. Drawings of the proposed development are displayed for the information of the University in the Schools Arcade and are reproduced online at https://www.prao.admin.cam.ac.uk/capital-planning/plans-and-drawings.\n\n8.The Council recommends:\n\nI.That approval in principle be given for the construction of the National Centre for Propulsion and Power and the associated Whittle Laboratory redevelopment.\n\nII.That the Director of Estate Strategy be authorised to apply for detailed planning approval in due course.\n\n12 June 2019\n\nStephen Toope, Vice-Chancellor\n\nDavid Greenaway\n\nMichael Proctor\n\nSam Ainsworth\n\nJennifer Hirst\n\nSofia Ropek-Hewson\n\nEvie Aspinall\n\nNicholas Holmes\n\nAndrew Sanchez\n\nR.

The senior academic promotions exercise in respect of promotions to take effect from 1 October 2019 has been completed. The General Board, at its meeting on 5 June 2019, considered recommendations from the Vice-Chancellor’s Senior Academic Promotions Committee in respect of promotion to personal Professorships, Readerships and Senior Lectureships. With the recommendations the Board received an extensive report, which provided the Board with an account of the procedure followed for the evaluation and comparison of the evidence for all applicants. The Board was able to see how recommendations had been arrived at so that, without repeating the entire exercise, it could either approve the recommendations or, if it so wished, consider the basis on which any of the recommendations had been made.\n\n2. The contents of the report were as follows:\n\n•minutes of the Vice-Chancellor’s Committee and School Committees;\n\n•summary lists of Faculty Committee and School Committee evaluations and bandings, indicating adjustments and any special or non-standard aspects of applications;\n\n•summary tables giving names of applicants in priority order by School Committee for each of the senior academic offices;\n\n•funding and statistical information;\n\n•equal opportunity report on all applications received;\n\n•feedback statements.\n\n3. The Board now recommends the establishment of 43 Professorships from 1 October 2019, as set out in Recommendation I. The establishment of these Professorships is proposed on condition that in each case where the person currently holds a permanently established office, that office should be placed in abeyance during the tenure of the Professorship.\n\n4. The Board also proposes the establishment of 46 Readerships from 1 October 2019, as set out in Recommendation II. The establishment of these Readerships is proposed on condition that in each case where the person currently holds a permanently established office, that office should be placed in abeyance during the tenure of the Readership.\n\n5. In order to avoid delay in publishing the Report, the Board has put forward its recommendations before the titles of the Professorships and Readerships have been agreed. The Board will announce these titles at a later date, after consultation with the individuals concerned.\n\n6. The Board has also agreed, in accordance with Special Ordinance C (ix) 1 and the special regulation for University Senior Lectureships (Statutes and Ordinances, p. 760) to appoint the 34 individuals listed in the Schedule to this Report to University Senior Lectureships.\n\n7. The estimated total additional cost to central funds in the first year of the proposals for promotion to personal Professorships and Readerships and of the appointments to University Senior Lectureships of the persons named in this Report will be approximately £876,458.\n\n8. The General Board recommends:\n\nI. That, with effect from 1 October 2019, Professorships be established for each of the following named persons for one tenure, placed in the Schedule to Special Ordinance C (vii) 1, and assigned to the Faculty, Department, or Institution named in each case, as follows:\n\nSchool of Arts and Humanities\n\nDr Caroline Vout, CHR, assigned to the Faculty of Classics\n\nDr Raphael Lyne, MUR, assigned to the Faculty of English\n\nDr Helena Sanson, CL, assigned to the Department of Italian\n\nSchool of the Biological Sciences\n\nDr Uta Paszkowski, JN, assigned to the Department of Plant Sciences\n\nDr Jonathan Simons, EM, assigned to the Department of Psychology\n\nDr Mark Holmes, CHU, assigned to the Department of Veterinary Medicine\n\nDr Elizabeth Murchison assigned to the Department of Veterinary Medicine\n\nSchool of Clinical Medicine\n\nDr Edmund Kunji, TH, assigned to the Department of Clinical Neurosciences\n\nDr George Vassiliou assigned to the Department of Haematology\n\nDr Menna Clatworthy, PEM, assigned to the Department of Medicine\n\nDr Anthony Davenport, CTH, assigned to the Department of Medicine\n\nDr Jason Carroll, CL, assigned to the Department of Oncology\n\nDr Masashi Narita assigned to the Department of Oncology\n\nDr Daniela De Angelis assigned to the Department of Public Health and Primary Care\n\nDr Martin White assigned to the Department of Public Health and Primary Care\n\nSchool of the Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nDr Catherine Burke assigned to the Faculty of Education\n\nDr Nidhi Singal, HH, assigned to the Faculty of Education\n\nDr Andreas Stylianides, HH, assigned to the Faculty of Education\n\nDr Annabel Brett, CAI, assigned to the Faculty of History\n\nDr Peter Sarris, T, assigned to the Faculty of History\n\nDr Sujit Sivasundaram, CAI, assigned to the Faculty of History\n\nDr Paul Warde, PEM, assigned to the Faculty of History\n\nDr David Sneath, CC, assigned to the Department of Social Anthropology\n\nDr Duncan Bell, CHR, assigned to the Department of Politics and International Studies\n\nDr Judith Browne, K, assigned to the Department of Politics and International Studies\n\nDr Albertina Albors-Llorens, JN, assigned to the Faculty of Law\n\nDr Jens Scherpe, CAI, assigned to the Faculty of Law\n\nDr Benjamin Crewe assigned to the Institute of Criminology\n\nSchool of the Physical Sciences\n\nDr Marie Edmonds, Q, assigned to the Department of Earth Sciences\n\nDr Jason Miller, T, assigned to the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics\n\nDr Vasily Belokurov assigned to the Institute of Astronomy\n\nDr Caterina Ducati, T, assigned to the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy\n\nDr Jason Robinson, JN, assigned to the Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy\n\nDr Erika Eiser, SID, assigned to the Department of Physics\n\nDr Austen Lamacraft, JN, assigned to the Department of Physics\n\nSchool of Technology\n\nDr Ahmed Khwaja assigned to the Judge Business School\n\nDr Wah Mak assigned to the Judge Business School\n\nDr Alastair Beresford, Q, assigned to the Department of Computer Science and Technology\n\nDr Paula Buttery, CAI, assigned to the Department of Computer Science and Technology\n\nDr Mateja Jamnik assigned to the Department of Computer Science and Technology\n\nDr Andrew Moore, CC, assigned to the Department of Computer Science and Technology\n\nDr Per Kristensson, T, assigned to the Department of Engineering\n\nDr Sebastian Savory, CHU, assigned to the Department of Engineering\n\nII.

The General Board recommends the establishment of a Professorship of Ophthalmology as set out in paragraph 2 below. The Resource Management Committee scrutinised the funding arrangements at the meeting held on 8 May 2019.\n\n2. The Board has accepted an academic case from the Faculty Board of Clinical Medicine and the Council of the School of Clinical Medicine for the establishment for a single tenure for five years, from 1 August 2019, of a Professorship of Ophthalmology in the Department of Clinical Neurosciences. The salary costs of the Professorship will be shared as follows: 50% from Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, 20% from the Van Geest Foundation Fund for Brain Repair and Neuroscience, 20% from the Cambridge Eye Trust, and 10% from Department funds. The tenure of the Professorship is limited to reflect the duration of the funding from the Van Geest Fund for Brain Repair and the Cambridge Eye Trust. The Board has agreed that election to the Professorship should be made by an ad hoc Board of Electors and that the candidature should be open to all persons whose work falls within the general field of the title of the office.\n\n3.The General Board recommends:\n\nI.That a Professorship of Ophthalmology be established in the University, for a single tenure, for five years from 1 August 2019 or the duration of the funding, whichever is the longer, placed in the Schedule to Special Ordinance C (vii) 1, and assigned to the Department of Clinical Neurosciences.\n\n12 June 2019\n\nStephen Toope, Vice-Chancellor\n\nNicholas Holmes\n\nHelen Thompson\n\nPhilip Allmendinger\n\nMatthew Kite\n\nGraham Virgo\n\nJohn Dennis\n\nPatrick Maxwell\n\nMark Wormald\n\nAbigail Fowden\n\nRichard Rex\n\nChris Young\n\nA.
