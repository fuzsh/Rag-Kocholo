Jake is uniquely positioned to share his insight on complex financial regulatory enforcement matters and the more complex aspects of MiFID transaction reporting including cross-border regulatory divergence.\n\nAdam Soilleux, from BDO LLP, will share his insights into the regulatory activity he is seeing and how firms are responding. BDO provides guidance with PRA s166 reviews, transaction reporting, internal audits, and market conduct compliance across the wholesale and capital markets.\n\nMichelle will not only moderate the session but also add context to some of the issues that continue to challenge firms. She will share her insights gained from overseeing a technology company that checks the accuracy of billions of transactions a year.\n\nThis exclusive Chatham House roundtable will bring together industry practitioners from across the financial services sector and promises to be an interactive and engaging session.\n\nPlaces are extremely limited and we request that you only reserve a space if you are certain you are able to attend."
