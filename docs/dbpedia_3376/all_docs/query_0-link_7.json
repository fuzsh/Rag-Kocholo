FOR HARRY THIS week the Star is calling on its thousands of readers to remem¬ ber the life of a “lovely little boy” who would have celebrated his birthday this weekend. Harry Ellis, a Year 2 pupil at Latton Green Primary School, died last month after being diagnosed with a rare type of brain tumour. He would have been seven on Sunday To mark his birthday, a group of more than 50 par¬ ents from all over the UK and Ireland who have children born August 2007 have organised a Hearts for Harry celebration of the BIANCA CASTRO _ bianca. castro@hertsessexnews .co.uk youngster’s life. Harry’s parents - Matthew and Jennifer - are asking people from across the world to take a photo of a love heart on Sunday and upload it to social media website Facebook using the hashtag #heartsforHarry and including the location. Jennifer, 32, said: “His birthday is going to be really painful for us. It is so unnatural that he was born on August 24 and yet he isn’t here. “As a parent it is incomprehensi¬ ble, the worst thing that could hap¬ pen. The pain is so intense; it is an actual physical pain. “However, our friends, family and everyone taking part in #hearts- forHarry means that something positive and loving is going to hap¬ pen on his birthday. “It means it won’t just be about »continued on page 3 Strength & Conditioning classes for everyone...

It will shock people to know that they are almost as common as leukaemia in children.” Marianne Looby, 26, from Orpington in Kent, is part of the group behind the Hearts for Harry event. She said: “We couldn’t let Harry’s birthday pass us by without doing something to show Jen and Matt how many people were affected by him. “We’d post about him on our Facebook page and our friends would comment and want to show their sympathies too. Even their friends would do the same. “We thought we could share Harry’s hearts, a term that was used throughout his battle, in reference to all those that followed him and his story. “We all met online eight years ago when we were pregnant with our August 2007ers. Our group is very diverse, from doctors to barristers, stay-at-home mums to jewellery designers. We are based all over the UK and Ireland and come from all walks of life. In honesty we’d never have become friends if it wasn’t for our babies. “There are 53 of us in our group and we had discussed what we should do to mark Harry’s birthday. We knew we didn’t want to just light candles; as lovely as that would be it wouldn’t reflect Harry or his birthday.” Hearts for Harry has gained more than 3,000 likes in the two days since it was created with people from all over the world getting involved. “Even the Red Arrows have done a heart,” said Ms Looby. “It’s much bigger than anyone anticipated and it just keeps growing. Anyone can join in and sharing is what it is all about.” Jennifer added: “Thank you to everyone taking part and celebrating Harry’s life with us on what would have been his seventh birthday. You are all amazing people and it’s going to be the most beautiful, inspiring thing to see. “He was a lovely little boy with a sense of humour beyond his years and an amazing strength of character. He is desperately missed but will live on in our hearts forever.” To get involved, search for Hearts for Harry - Worldwide on Facebook. Take a photo of a love heart and upload it on Sunday.

Hunky Davood’s ready to ‘spice up’ EastEnders AN actor from Harlow has landed the big¬ gest role of his career so far after joining the cast of top BBC soap EastEnders. Davood Ghadami, who has already start¬ ed filming on the Elstree set, will play the role of Khoroush ‘Kush’ Kazemi, a charac¬ ter described by the show’s executive pro¬ ducer Dominic Treadwell-Collins as a “leading man to spice up the market”. Mr Ghadami is no stranger to the screen, having alreay appeared in a number of popular television series including Taggart Doctor Who, Top Boy, Silent Witness, Spooks and Casualty He has also done a variety of theatre and film work. “I’m so excited to be joining the cast of EastEnders” he told reporters. “I’ve been a fan of the show for as long as I can remem¬ ber. “It’s surreal to get to work with these actors that I’ve spent so many evenings watching on television.” Man jailed for sexual activity with girl of 14 A MAN who shared a bed with two young girls and engaged in sexual activity with one of them when she was only 14 has been jailed for nine months. Thomas Lacey, 22, of Collins Meadow, Harlow, was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years by judge Anthony Goldstaub, who told him: “You’ve let your family and yourself down badly and undoubtedly damaged your victim.” In addition to the jail sentence Lacey was banned for making contact with either of the girls for three years. He pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court to two charges of sexual activity with a 14-year- old girl in September 2012 in a house where he was staying overnight. Stephen Rose, prosecuting, said the victim had described Lacey as being ‘like an older brother’ but said that he had groped her. John Fairhead, representing Lacey, said in miti¬ gation: “He was 20 and he was mixing with girls four or five years younger than him. Being looked up to by them was an ego boost.” Describing him at the time as immature rather than wicked, Mr Fairhead continued: “He’s got a good family background and a very good work record. He was 20; it’s an age when boys are fre¬ quently immature.” BIANCA CA STRO bianca.castro@hertsessexnews .co.uk Mr Treadwell-Collins said: “Davood’s a brilliant actor and a proper gentleman. We’ve had Kush in our minds for a while now - a new leading man to spice up the market and set some female hearts flutter¬ ing. “And it won’t be long before he has one Walford woman firmly in his sights.” Mr Ghadami’s father Mo, who owns a number of properties in and around Harlow, said he was very proud of his son. “He has been acting for around 10 years and has been in a lot of things,” he said. “Everybody is really excited and we are all very proud of him. It is good news. He is a good boy, very down-to-Earth and a real gentleman.” Davood’s character is due to make his first appearance on the nation’s TV screens in the autumn.

SIR The First World War names on the Potter Street war memorial include two Wheelers - Walter, who was the the subject of your recent feature, and Reginald. Reginald was one of four sons of another Wheeler family living in Latton Street. The other sons were James, William and Edward and all four served in the First World War. All survived apart from Reginald. Recently the Museum of Harlow received a donation from a relative of Edward Wheeler, the youngest of the brothers, of a collection of his memorabilia. It includes photographs of all four brothers and some information about Reginald - particularly a memorial card of his burial at St Mary-at-Latton in 1919. His is one of three war graves in the churchyard. Edward’s war record is of being wounded twice and then taken prisoner at Ypres in 1918, finally being repatriated from Germany in 1919. As a museum volunteer I have been working on Edward’s memorabilia with a view to having some of it ready for a proposed exhibition, hopefully by November. We intend later to research the war records of the other brothers and possibly also the family background, but all this will take some time particularly as we have only one volunteer doing the work. Some help would be greatly appreciated. Brian Mooney Netteswellbury Farm, Harlow Majority of patients got to see GP within a week SIR So 18 per cent of the people who wanted a GP appointment couldn’t get one within a week (Star, August 7). That means that 82 per cent did get such an appointment. Might it just be the case that those 82 per cent were the urgent ones, maybe even used by the elderly or the vulnerable within the community? Of course it’s possible that if someone (and surely not the surgeries because they could never get it right, could they?) had to prioritise the available appointements on the grounds of urgency, some people would have to wait longer than a week. So come on Suzy Stride, let’s be positive about this. Save that £100m, appreciate the fact that the majority of the people got their appointments and accept the fact that sometimes we just have to wait! John Allen Burley Hill, Harlow Advice service continues to provide valuable help SIR What an amazing evening we had when we attended the relaunch of Harlow Advice Centre at Harlow Central Library last month. The two guest speakers - eminent email: star@hertsessexnews.co.uk / twitter: @Harlowstar /facebook: www.facebook.com/HarlowStar PHOTO OF THE WEEK journalists Jason Cowley (editor of the New Statesman) and Andy Lines (chief reporter of the Daily Mirror) - spoke with humour and affection for their years in Harlow and of their support for the advice service which has given this town so much in professional advice over many years. It continues to do so despite the ill- treatment by Harlow Council which removed it from the Advice Centre building which now lies empty and useless. Harlow Advice Centre now operates from the office upstairs in the library and can be reached on (01279) 704002. They are there with the Harlow Credit Union. Wouldn’t it be a great move by Harlow Council to now include information about the new advice service in all its publications? Sheila and Doug Marchant Ladyshot, Harlow Street lights campaign is gathering momentum SIR The ‘Turn Our Street Lights Back On’ campaign is gaining momentum throughout Essex. As a county councillor I was a major proponent of this campaign at the last meeting when I seconded the motion to get the lights back on. This was only narrowly defeated by the Conservative administration at County Hall, with all three major opposition parties voting to turn the lights back on although the Green Party councillors abstained. Harlow Council will continue to maintain the pressure on Essex when it debates a resolution to get the lights turned back on at its September meeting. The Labour group hopes to get all-party backing to protest to the county council T HIS week’s photo of three Red Admiral butterflies on a buddleia bush was taken by Catherine Bauer in the garden of her home in Quarry Spring, Harlow. If you have a photo taken in or around the town which you would like to feature in our Photo of the Week section, email a high resolution copy in JPEG format, along with a description of your photo and details of when and where it was taken to star@hertsessexnews. co.uk. Include your name and address and insert ‘Photo of the Week’ in the subject line. ^ that we need our lights on for safety, for reassurance and to combat nighttime crime. There is also an online petition that people can sign which will trigger further debate in council chambers. Whether the Conservative Party like it or not, this is an issue that will not go away until they relent and simply turn our street lights back on. County councillor Mike Danvers (Labour) Tunnmeade, Harlow There’s no excuse for people dropping litter SIR Is it not a fact that an empty beer weighs less than a full beer can? Then why is it from purchasing said beverage and walking to a park bench consuming the contents there are people who must lose all upper body strength which prevents them carrying their empty cans home or putting them in the nearest litter bin? Is leaving their rubbish in public places their way of giving the finger to society and not caring about anything or anyone? They are not alone. Walk in any park, cycle track or open space and you will see litter dropped by people of all ages and from all walks of life. It seems to me that it is more socially acceptable these days to drop litter than to pick it up. Recently I was behind a car in which there were two adults and three teenagers. We stopped at lights and these people opened ther windows and chucked fish and chip wrappers out on to the road. What a great example to our youth! I know if anyone reads this letter they will say that it’s not just Harlow that has the problem of littering and there are worse places to live, but that does not IvsiKflriiyiWKiiiarsiaB Lt for a nice relaxing walk to come back utter dismay at the amount of rubbish there is and having to sit on a park bench in the midst of someone else’s beer cans and cigarette wrappers. All actions have consequences so please take your rubbish home or put it in a bin. It’s a small task but it has major benefits Wharley Hook, Harlow Rubbish dumping is an all-year-round problem SIR I fully agree with the correspondent who commented about it not being only travellers who make a mess ( Letters , August 14). During the weather we have been having of late the area in question has been an absolute eyesore on a Monday morning and is has nothing to do with travellers. You only need to walk around the town and see how much rubbish is dumped in hedgerows, garage areas and cycle tracks by people who live in this town. This is not just for a few months of the year but all year round. Look at how many residents dump their garden rubbish over the garden fence on to council land and think that is okay. I think we need to start looking nearer to home before we start finger-pointing. R.D. Lucia Coppice Hatch, Harlow Clamp travellers’ cars until they clean up SIR We all know about the mess left behind by the travellers but our laws regarding them are pitiful. It is no good blaming anyone except the political elite for the problem. They have done little or nothing over the years. All political parties are guilty. Why do law-abiding citizens always have to pick up the tab? I have a simple solution to the problem - just go in and clamp a few of their expensive cars. Then make them clear up their own mess with the possibility of having their vehicles crushed or sold if they don’t. This will concentrate their minds. Problem solved and the taxpayers of Harlow can rejoice, knowing it would not happen again. It’s payback time. Brian Matthews Spruce Hill, Harlow Thanks to all who helped when rain caused a flood SIR I would like, through the letters page of the Star, to say the biggest thank you to all my neighbours, including the children with brush and saucepan, who came to my rescue on Sunday, August 10. I have three steps from pavement level to my front door. As a consequence of a sudden downpour the area outside my house became a swimming pool. Without having to ask, these people came to bail me out. Thank you all.

The attack in Long Banks, Harlow, took place at about 5pm on Thursday, luly 31. Two men - one of them holding a crowbar - knocked on the door of the house and when the homeowner answered he was struck in the face and a gold pendant grabbed from his neck. The victim sustained a bruised lip and cuts to his nose and mouth. The two men ran off and got into a dark coloured vehicle. One of the suspects was wear¬ ing light clothing and a black balaclava. An hour earlier burglars broke into a house in Burley Hill by smashing a window in the rear door of the property. However, once inside they were disturbed and fled with¬ out taking anything. One of the suspects is described as a white man in his mid-20s, of medium build and 5ft 6in tall. He was wear¬ ing a grey hooded top and had a luminous yellow scarf around his face Detective Constable Gav Morris, of Harlow CID, said: “These were two nasty bur¬ glaries which have left the homeowners greatly dis¬ tressed. “I am keen to apprehend these suspects as soon as pos¬ sible. In particular I want to hear from anyone who saw this dark coloured vehicle driving erratically in Harlow on the day in question, espe¬ cially in either Long Banks or Burley Hill.” Anyone with information about either incident should call DC Morris at Harlow CID on 101 or ring Crimestoppers on 0800 555111. Amy weaves her loom band magic to help orphans A SIX-year- old is putting her skill at making loom bands to good use by raising money for a children’s home in Nepal. Amy Sheppard, a pupil at Tany’s Dell School, decided to sell the bands after hear¬ ing about the Kapila Valley Primary School and chil¬ dren’s home. It is part of BlinkNow, a not-for-profit organisation providing an education and home for orphaned, impov¬ erished and at-risk children. So far Amy, pictured above, has raised £20 by selling the colourful bands to her dad and his colleagues during a work barbeque and is cur¬ rently busy creating more. She will then send the pro¬ ceeds as well as some of her best bands and loom band kits to the children helped by BlinkNow. Mum Zoe, 28, of Orchard Croft, Harlow, said: “We are really proud of her for doing this. “It was really random; she started making loom bands and then her dad’s work had a barbeque and she decided to sell them there. “My cousin - Daniel Furlong - does fundraising and helps BIANCA CASTRO b ianca. castro@hertsessexnews .co.uk the school and orphanage. Amy is aware of that and she just told me one day she wanted to sell loom bands to raise money for the children there and make some to send to them. “It is amazing. I have not tried to push her too much and I’m just letting her get on with it. She is still trying to sell more of them and is making more to send over.” Amy said: “I’m making loom bands for the charity my cousin helps with. I’m going to make lots more to sell and send to the charity.” Zoe said that when Amy, who only turned six last month, told Daniel about her fundraising plans he was flabbergasted. “He just could not believe it,” she said. “He said she made his week and he has said when she’s older he may take her there to meet the children which she is really up for.” To find out more about the Kapila Valley primary school and children’s home and BlinkNow, visit www.blin- know.org. Knitters urged to help create field woollen poppies KNITTERS are being encouraged to pick^ up their needles and create woollen poppies for a special display 1 in the entrance of Harlow Civic Centre as part of the town commemoration to mark the centenary of the start of the First World War. The community project was launched yesterday (Wednesday) with a ‘knit in’ at the Gibberd Gallery. Harlow Council is asking the town’s knitters to make poppies over a 12-week period in the run up to Remembrance Sunday. People who cannot knit can still take part by creating crochet poppies or weaving them using loom bands. The poppies will go on display in the entrance of the Civic Centre from Monday, October 20. The project is being run by Harlow Council chairman councillor Ian Beckett and Harlow Art Trust. “This will be great way to bring the community together to create something to help remember those who sacrificed their lives for us,” said Cllr Beckett. “Poppies are a symbol of remembrance of soldiers who have died during wartime and each poppy created will be gradually arranged in the entrance of the Civic Centre. It is hoped this will give a poignant impression of a field of poppies growing as the town approaches Remembrance Day.” At then end of the propject the poppies will be donated to the Royal British Legion to raise funds for their work.

A big thank you goes to everyone who has supported them, particularly our staff who are committed to helping them achieve bright futures.” Head of sixth form Tracy Greenall said: “This is the first year when A-level students have not been able to sit unit exams in January which has meant they have had many more exams in one sitting. “These excellent results show just how well students and staff have prepared for this change. They are leav¬ ing us well equipped for university or employment and we wish them the very best for the future.” Matthew Lowe, 18, who achieved the grades he needed to study pharma¬ cology at the University of Hertfordshire, said: “I P think it was a lot harder and there was more pressure on everyone. “I came to Harlow College from Leventhorpe so it was a massive jump but I really appreciate all the support I have been given from teachers here.” Yasmin Watkins, 18, who will be taking up a place to read history at Leeds University after gaining an A and 2Bs said: “I’m really happy. I checked this morning and I’m really pleased to see all the hard work after two years pay off.” Jasmine Lyall, 18, gained two A*s and a C and now plans to read sociology, “I am over¬ whelmed,” she said. “Everyone at Harlow College is great and the teachers are wonderful. “I did sociology as an A Level and it was a bit of a whim really, but it is one of the best choices of my life. I’m really looking forward to going to university.” Harlow MP Robert Halfon said “Yet again Harlow College has had outstanding results. “I congratulate the new principal, the staff and students. The college is helping to put Harlow on the map as the number one town in the east of England for skills and educational achievement and excellence.” Students at St Mark’s West Essex Catholic School achieved a 99 per cent pass rate, with 60 per cent of students gaining A-C grades. Star performers included Ana Bakalarczyk (2 As, 2 Bs) who will be studying social psychology and sociology at the University of Essex, Taska Fry (1 A*, IB and 1C), who will be reading phi¬ losophy and theology at St Mary’s University College, James Mortimer (1 A*, 1A, IB) who will be going to UEA to study English and creative writing, Hon Kit Lee (2 As, 2Cs) who will be reading civil engineering at the University of Surrey and Lauren Richards (1 A* and 2 Bs) who will be doing business studies at the University of Bournemouth. Headteacher Elaine Heaphy said: “These are A-level s BIANCA CASTRO bianca.castro@hertsessexnews.co.uk excellent results for this cohort, for their families and for Harlow. “Our sixth form draws from ah the other schools in Harlow and these results represent success for all the schools that have been involved in their education. I am especially pleased with the partnership work that we have undertaken and subjects that have been deliv¬ ered by other schools have done exceptionally well.” Year 10 Burnt Mill Academy student Harry Grace gained an A grade in his AS-Level in math¬ ematics. Headteacher Helena Mills described it as an “exceptional achievement”. Leventhorpe School in Sawbridgeworth saw an improvement in the percentage of students gaining higher grades, with 61 per cent achiev¬ ing at least two A*-B grades. High achievers included Jack Bradbury (4 A*s, 1A) who has gained a place to study medicine at Cambridge, Georgina Shenton (2 A*s, 2 As) who will be reading English literature at Durham University, Daniel Smith (1 A*, 2 As) who will be going to Oxford to study history, Will Dyball (2 A*s, 1 A, 1 B) who will be studying business at the University of Sussex and Ruby Pease (1 A*, 2 As) who will take up her place reading psychology at York University. Across Essex, more than 4,000 A-level students collected their results last week, with 77 per cent achieveing three or more passes and 91 per cent gaining two or more passes. email: star@hertsessexnews.co.uk Harlow Star | harlowstar.co.uk | August 21, 2014 | 7 Follow us on Twitter @Harlowstar j lUtvvS tudents make their mar MUSIC BUSINESS LEVEL 3 DIPLOMA Music journalism • Event management • Podcasts Representing artists • Marketing • How to make a profit Music contracts • Social media • Copyright START YOUR CAREER IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HERTFORDSHIRE COLLEGE OF MUSIC MUSIC PERFORMANCE LEVEL 2 S3 DIPLOMA Music performance • Song writing Music technology • Improvisation Session musician • Music event management Fully funded 16-18.19 + please call.

More than 1,000 people attended the event organised by Upwards with Downs and held atThe Link, in Parsloe Road. There were about 60 stalls, inflatables and entertainment from bands, the Galaxy Cheerleaders and Dance 21. Organisers Tara Bowers and Cristina Griffiths said they were overwhelmed by the success of the day. “We raised a massive £7,287 with still more to come in,” said Mrs Bowers. “It is a huge amount of money for a small group like us. “Thank you to everyone who made it possible both on the day and also helping with the preparation. It was a team effort and everyone worked really hard. “We have raised a lot but more importantly we have raised awareness of Down’s Syndrome. If we can change just one person’s perspective of the condition then we have accomplished what we set out to achieve.” To find out more about the group, visit www.upwardswithdowns.com. Nursery nurse to scale new heights for cancer charity BIANCA CASTRO_ bianca ,castro@hertsessexnews .co.uk A NURSERY nurse from Harlow is preparing to climb to the top of the highest mountain in the British Isles to raise money for Breast Cancer Care. Catherine Johnson, of Tye Green, has set herself a target of £500 for the cancer charity but is hoping to raise more. She will be hosting a number of fundraising events including a strawberry tea at the Park Inn Hotel in Southern Way, Harlow, from 2-4pm on Sunday, August 31 before she tackles the ascent of Ben Nevis next month. “Breast Cancer Care is an amazing charity,” said 24-year-old Catherine, pictured right “Most people, including myself, know at least one person who has experienced breast cancer. “As well as supporting people affected, they also campaign for improvement in standards of support and care which I think is brilliant. “When people are affected by breast cancer they are often not in a position to be able to fight for better support and care themselves, so the charity does it for them. “The risk of developing breast cancer is one in eight. It’s quite scary, I can think of seven friends and know that statistically one of us will get it. It’s not a female-only disease either; it’s rare in men but around 350 are diagnosed each year.” Catherine, who has signed up as an individual for the trek and has so far raised £200, added: “Ben Nevis is the highest mountain in the British Isles, I’d quite like to be able to say I’ve stood on the summit of that. “I’m also lucky enough to be young and healthy, which is something to make the most of, and I’ve always wanted to do something challenging. “With training I started off using the ‘Couch to 5k’ plan to build up my general fitness level and have been walking lots as well. I’m breaking in my walking boots and on the lookout for hills around Harlow. “Out of everything I would say the hardest thing is just trying to find time to train. The last thing you feel like doing when you get home from work at night is going out training, but I’ve got to or I’ll suffer more at 4,408ft.” Catherine will be arriving in Scotland on Friday, September 26 and is planning to climb Ben Nevis the following day.

Shoppers enjoy greyhound’s visit A CHARITY which rehomes retired racing greyhounds visited the Harvey Centre in Harlow to raise awareness of its work and promote ownership of the breed. Barley Kennels in Waltham Abbey - the Harlow branch of the Retired Greyhound Trust - rehomes dogs when they stop racing. Volunteer John Rogers, who has three greyhounds of his own and has been volunterring for nine years, said: “The Harvey Centre event was a success. We had Molly with us and she was very popular. “Greyhounds make wonderful pets. Many people think they are a very active dog but they are called the 40mph coach potato. They only need two 20-minute walks a day and they love to relax and have a cuddle. They are naturally very calm animals. He added: “We welcome anyone that is interested in giving a loving home to a greyhound.” To find out more about Barley Kennels, visit www.barleykennels. co.uk.

Ritchie Parrott, of Moorfield, Harlow, has gone from 27st 7.5lbs to 15st 81bs since joining a local Slimming World group in November 2012. He said: “Men are usually in the minority and are the people that need the help to lose weight the most usually. “I have always said women are very good at having their own network of support but guys do not tend to do that. “But once I joined Slimming World and started losing weight, it was a fantastic feeling. There were four or five men in my group, all with success which encouraged me.” The 44-year-old made it to the final 10 of the Man of the Year competi¬ tion but lost out to Brendan O’Donnell, 31. As one of the finalists he met Sky Sports presenter Charlie Webster. Ritchie, who works at Princess Alexandra Hospital, volunteer¬ ed in the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in London in 2012 and more recently vol- unteeredfor the Commonwealth Games. Tipping the scales at 27st when volunteering at the London 2012 Games, he said: “I had a desk job for the Olympics and the Parlympics but the Common¬ wealth Games was different. “They were amazing, it was a really fantastic experience and it was great to not feel inhibited by my size.

If a grant application to the Heritage Lottery Fund is successful, the money will be used to digitalise and catalogue some of the archive’s recordings. They include teachers, a chimney sweep, a former Tiller Girl, farmworkers, a former police chief superintendent, a cinema organist, former mayors and domestic servants.

A woman calling herself Sarah and claiming to be based at Basildon police station made two calls to people who became suspicious and hung up on her. It is believed the same woman also called a man in Cambridgeshire, telling him she was based with Essex Police and wanted to search his home as part of an investigation. The man ended the conversation and alerted police. Police enquiries are continuing but at this stage they say they are not being linked to a series of telephone frauds in which victims have been tricked into handing over bank cards or large amounts of money. Inspector Mark Rayner said: “All three calls were made on Wednesday, August 13 and fortunately all the people who received the calls hung up and contacted us. “But we are concerned that there might have been other people who fell for the story and might have let a stranger or strangers into their homes. We urge everyone in the county to be vigilant if they are called by anyone claiming to be a police officer. “If you do receive a call, hang up but try dialling 1471 to get the caller’s number, make a note of the conversation and then call 101 to report the incident to Essex Police. If someone calls you then turns up at your doorstep, dial 999 immediately.” WORKS OF ART: David Nash with his mural of Rik Mayall and, right, Sir Charles Kao Artist David gives theatre a facelift BIANCA CASTRO bianca.castro@hertsessexnews.co.uk A PAIR of 20ft high tributes to two of the town’s more fam¬ ous residents have been unveiled in Harlow. The murals of late comedian Rik Mayall and the inventor of fibre-optic cables Sir Charles Kao, 80, were painted by artist David Nash on the side of The Playhouse. Mr Nash was given permis¬ sion to paint the murals after seeking permission from Harlow Council. The professional artist, who is known as Gnasher, offered to do the pieces for free in return for a contribution towards paint and a location for both murals. Gnasher, 40, who grew up in Harlow, started spray painting in 1988 and stopped in 1993. He picked up the paints again in 2009 and has been creating street art ever since. “I approached Harlow Cou¬ ncil to do a mural as I thought it would be a fitting tribute since he was born in Harlow and the gift of social media helped make it a reality,” he said. “I know the Playhouse doors well and I knew what space I would have to work with so I talked to the theatre’s direc¬ tor, Scott Ramsay, and gave him a few images of Rik Mayall and Sir Charles and we decid¬ ed on the best one. “I am quite chuffed with how they’ve turned out as I’ve never painted such a large face before. Everyone seems to be talking about it which is great. If people do not know about Rik Mayall and Sir Charles this may make them want to find out which is bril¬ liant.” Cllr Emma Toal, portfolio holder for youth and commu¬ nity, said: “We felt if we could help recognise the joy he brought to so many people we should do something. “The final result is absolutely stunning and a fitting tribute to a man who made millions laugh.” Rik Mayall, who starred in TV comedies The Young Ones, Catflap and Bottom, was born in Matching Tye. He died on June 9 this year. Sir Charles Kao is one of two scientists credited with the invention of fibre-optic com¬ munications. The Nobel Prize winner made his discovery while working at telecoms firm STL in London Road dur¬ ing the 1980s.

Instead, a judge at Chelmsford Crown Court placed Paul Stephen Onslow - who traded as Stephen Paul Estate Agents in The Stow, Harlow - on a six-month cur¬ few and imposed a suspended prison sentence. Onslow pleaded guilty to one offence of fraudulently abusing his position as the proprietor of an estate agency business in Harlow between April 22, 2008 and Apri 22, 2013 by using £43,736 of his cli¬ ents’ money for his own purposes. The prosecution explained the charge was limited to a fraud against 14 land¬ lords although Onslow had told police he estimated the total amount of money involved was £180,000. The court was told Onslow “robbed Peter to pay Paul” to keep his business out of financial difficulties when the recession hit in 2008. His firm went from selling eight to 10 houses a month to none and he relied on his 40-50 letting clients. Onslow looked after 89 rooms and 74 dwellings. Samantha Lowther, prosecuting, said Onslow abused his position of trust in several ways. He failed to pay rent he had collected from tenants to landlords, he increased rents without informing land¬ lords, he amended rental agreements and signed them on landlords’ behalf without their knowledge, he changed the bank account tenants paid into and he obtained an additional £70 key deposit from tenants without landlords know¬ ing. COURT REPORTER_ star@hertsessexnews .co.uk Miss Lowther said one landlord dis¬ covered that Onslow had rented out all four bedrooms of one property to differ¬ ent tenants while another was unaware that rent was not being paid into his account until his bank told him in March last year that direct debits to his mortgage lender and other creditors had been returned unpaid. Miss Lowther said that when the pre¬ viously successful house-selling busi¬ ness experienced financial problems Onslow relied on rental properties. At first he collected money at the beginning of the month and paid land¬ lords at the end but as the business went downhill landlords were paid later. Onslow, of Yewlands, Hoddesdon, told police: “It’s not money I have hidden away. I was just robbing Peter to pay Paul so I haven’t physically got it.” He started coming up with excuses not to pay, one of which was that he had a brain aneurysm. Robert James, representing Onslow, said in mitigation he was “clearly not a competent businessman” and had not enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle. “He didn’t set out to defraud, he adopt¬ ed a practice which was doomed to failure,” said Mr James. None of Onslow’s clients or tenants had lodged a complaint with police, who were completely unaware of the fraud until Onslow confessed. Imposing an 18-month prison sen¬ tence suspended for two years, 250 hours of unpaid work and a six-month electronically tagged curfew from 9pm- 6am, judge Christopher Ball told Onslow it would be “significantly less harsh than being banged up in a prison cell”. He said Onslow,who was of previous good character had avoided being sent to jail immediately because he had walked into Harlow police station in April last year to confess and had plead¬ ed guilty to the charge. “Rather than bow down to the inevi¬ table because your area of work was devastated by the recession, you tried to trade your way out of it and in order to do that you deceived and cheated peo¬ ple entitled to money you were holding on to,” the judge added. Like us on Facebook /HarlowStar Council contractor on board as a living wage employer COUNCIL maintenance contractor Kier Harlow has been officially recognised as a living wage employer. The company has followed in the footsteps of Harlow Council which gained the status in July last year and which is aiming to make Harlow a living wage town. Workers receiving the living wage are currently paid £7.65 an hour compared to the national minimum wage of £6.31. The rate is set independently, updated annually and based on the cost of living in the UK. John Phillips, Kier’s regional operations director, said: “We are dedicated to providing the very best opportunities for our employees as well as investing in the communities in which we work. “Our commitment to the living wage standard is just a small step in recognising the vital contribution our staff make to the local community and our company.” Council leader Jon Clempner said: “I am really pleased to see Kier Harlow has achieved this status. It takes us one step closer to achieving the council’s aspiration of making Harlow a living wage town to ensure that low-paid staff are protected and looked after.” Former council leader Mark Wilkinson, who championed the cause for the authority to adopt the living wage, added: “Paying employees a living wage as a minimum is fair, increases equality and independence and has real benefits for employers and the local economy.” TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF BRITAINS VERY BEST VAUXHALL OFFERS BRAND NEW VauxhallCorsa Excite3dr i 4 BRAND NEW VauxhallCorsa 1.2LE3dr • Remote Control Central Locking* Electrically Adjustable Door Mirrors* Power Steering • CD Player ™cE £10249 *After Partners discounts and guaranteed part exchange at £500 £499 DEPOSIT PER MONTH X35PAYMENTS FOLLOWED BY 1 PAYMENT OF £3729 includes finance deposit allowance paid by Vauxhall Excess mileage charged at 9p per mile.

They also changed in April 2014. This article provides basic information on personal not business debts. Courts and public authorities can use bailiffs as a way of getting you to pay what you owe. Bailiffs are only instructed if you fail to repay your creditors, normally after your case has been to court. They will threaten to take your possessions to persuade you to pay the debt, or take and sell things you own to repay your debt. Normally, bailiffs can only visit between 6am and 9pm but you do not have to grant them access. Most bailiffs cannot use force or damage to enter your property, but they are allowed access through normal entrances such as an open door. Bailiffs are, however, allowed to force entry to collect unpaid criminal fines, income tax or VAT. After a bailiff has gained access, they can re-enter without permission - using force if needed - with respect to the same debt.When seizing goods, the bailiff must leave the premises safe. Bailiffs cannot seize items belonging to anyone other than the person on the distress warrant although jointly owned goods may be included. For most debts, bailiffs cannot remove anything needed for basic domestic living including lighting, clothing, bedding and furniture or items on hire purchase or rented. Nor can they take anything required for use in employment or business. However, a bailiff collecting VAT and tax arrears may be able to. The bailiff may remove items immediately but more commonly will make a controlled goods agreement where seized goods legally belong to the bailiff and can be removed at any time. As long as agreed repayments are made they will allow the goods to remain in the home. Seized goods are sold at auction. The bailiff is legally bound to get a fair price, but the resale price of secondhand goods are a small fraction of the purchase price. Debt collectors are not the same as bailiffs. Debt collectors cannot take any direct action against you apart from asking you to pay. High Court bailiffs, known as High Court Enforcement Officers, can only enforce certain types of debt. The rules are complicated. If in doubt seek advice from a specialist advice agency such as Harlow Advice Centre. Harlow Advice Centre is based on the first floor of Harlow Central Library in The High. Telephone (01279) 704002 or email admin@harlowac.org.uk. Opening hours are Monday noon-2pm and Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 10am-2pm. Out of hours appointments are available if necessary. Queen’s letter of thanks for songwriter Harry’s CD AN amateur musician who has been writing and performing songs for more than 30 years has received a letter from Bucking¬ ham Palace after he sent the Queen a copy of his latest - and final - CD. Harry James, of Sewell Harris Close, has spent the past 35 years composing songs for charity, rais¬ ing money for a variety of good causes. The 73-year-old, pictured left, said he would be displaying the letter, which is signed on headed notepaper by deputy correspond¬ ence co-ordinator Jennie Vine - on his wall. “I have been writing songs for charity for 35 years,” said Mr James. “I wrote to the Queen enclosing a copy of my CD but I wasn’t really expecting a reply. “I’m over the moon to have got the letter. I retired from songwrit¬ ing about a month ago so this is really nice.” BIANCA CASTRO bianca. castro@hertsessexnews .co.uk The CD compilation of 16 of Harry’s ‘greatest hits’ included Crazy In Harlow, Harlow Girls and Harlow My Town. He added: “The last charity song I did was for the Royal British Legion and that raised quite a bit of money. I am really proud.” The letter from Buckingham Palace reads: “The Queen has asked me to thank you for your letter of 7th July with which you enclosed a CD of the latest and last song you have written for charity. “It was thoughtful of you to take the time and trouble to write and Her Majesty was grateful for the kind message of good wishes you sent for herself and her family.” Mr James also sent a copy of his CD to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall for which he received a letter of thanks. Station protest over rail fare rise railways have lower fares, are more efficient, and profits are reinvested back into the service. In Britain, publicly owned East Coast Main Line is a success story and in 2013/14 returned £216m to the UK Treasury. In the five years since 2009, East Coast has returned over £lbn to the UK Treasury.” Mr Forman added: “Regulated fares would have risen even more this year if the Government hadn’t capitulated to public pressure to cap last year’s rise to inflation only after several years of inflation-busting rises. “With privatised rail services, we have the highest fares in Europe with profits extracted to pay shareholder dividends. “Evidence shows that about £1.2bn per year is wasted due to privatisation and, if saved, this could fund an 18 per cent cut in fares.” MEMBERS of Harlow Trade Union Council staged a demon¬ stration at Harlow Town station against the latest round of rail fare rises. The protestors spent three hours on Tuesday morning handing hundreds of cards to commuters to highlight the increased rail fares. Rail fares are set to rise by 3.5 per cent from January next year following the release of last month’s inflation figures. The Retail Prices Index for July, which is used as the measure of inflation, was 2.5 per cent according to the Office for National Statistics. Rail fares will rise by that amount plus one per cent. Harlow TUC secretary David Forman said: “Since 2008 fares have risen four times faster than average wages. “In Europe, publicly owned Funeral Services swallow hotels^ The Churchgate Hotel Friday 26th September 80's Night 3 course dinner, tribute and disco £29.50 per person Friday 24th October Top of the Pops includes 3 course dinner £29.50 per person Friday 28th November Adele Tribute includes 3 course dinner, entertainment and disco £35.00 per person Saturday 29th November Dolly Parton Tribute includes 3 course dinner, entertainment and disco £35.00 per person Contact us for further details or to book on 01279 420246 Email: events.churchgate@crerarmgmt.com Churchgate Street Village, Old Harlow, CM 17 OJT iASTERS0 1N i • Pre-paid funeral plans • Irish repatriation specialists 1 Private chapel of rest • Catholic funeral director available • 24 hour service • Horse drawn hearse available Local Independent Family Funeral Directors and Monumental Masons TEL: 01279 626238 Please visit our website www.-rnastersonfuneralhome.com Station Road, Old Harlow CM17 OAS ' t&e cmt^ont cpowi <ww home WALTON LODGE VETS A FAMILY BUSINESS CARING FOR YOUR FAMILY FRIENDS LIFETIME VACINATIONS For your pets FOR ONLY £99 — Check the website for your nearest surgery www.waltonlodgevets.com Walton Lodge are located in Ware, Enfield, Hertford, Hoddesdon, Bishop’s Stortford, Stevenage, Welwyn Garden City, Harlow & Bengeo. *Terms and conditions apply. 16 | August 21, 2014 | harlowstar.co.uk | Harlow Star EPPING FOREST DISTRICT COUNCIL RECYCLING AND REFUSE COLLECTION DATES August 2014 Bank holiday Normal Collection Date Monday 25 August 2014 Tuesday 26 August 2014 Wednesday 27 August 2014 Thursday 28 August 2014 Friday 29 August 2014 Revised Collection Date Tuesday 26 August 2014 Wednesday 27 August 2014 Thursday 28 August 2014 Friday 29 August 2014 Saturday 30 August 2014 Normal Collection Resume on Monday 1 September 2014 Refuse and recycling must be available from 7am on collection day Please contact the Council on 01992564608 ^ Epping Forest District Council Anglia Ruskin University W Among the best in the country j ✓ Stimulating courses ✓ Inspiring tutors / Student confidence* 9 out of 10 of our graduates start their careers within six months.* From Business to Science, through to Health and the Arts, we have a range of undergraduate courses to bring your ambitions to life.

The tiny six-week-old Vietnamese box turtle, which measures the size of a matchbox and weighs just half an ounce, was hatched after being kept at a constant temperature in an incubator at Bristol Zoo for 85 days. The turtle, which is on the critically endangered list of anmials, is so precious it is being kept in a climate-controlled quarantine room away from the public. Tim Skelton, the zoo’s curator of reptiles, said: “This is a very difficult species to breed so I am thrilled with the arrival of this baby. It comes after a lot of hard work. “Little is known about this species so we can learn an awful lot from this baby to improve our chances of breeding more in the future. They are secretive animals so we are keeping it in a warm, humid and quiet room with a constant temperature to replicate its natural habitat where it can burrow among the soil and leaves.” Bristol Zoo is believed to be only the second zoo in Europe to have bred the species. When the baby turtle grows up it will weigh just over a kilo and measure eight inches long. Vietnamese box turtles can live for up to 50 years.

By providing part-time care for a child or young person with a disability... What difference does shared care make? Shared care provides very important support to children with a disability & their families who benefit in a range of ways. Take for instance... Anna & Mark, who have three children under the age of eight. Their eldest child Ben has a rare genetic condition which means he requires constant care and supervision. Ben goes to spend the day with his shared care family once a month. He loves going to visit them and the children in his shared care family love spending time with Ben when he visits. Ben's parents really benefit from the break shared care gives them and the opportunity to spend quality time with their two younger children... What is Shared Care? Shared Care is a short break and friendship scheme for children with learning and/or physical disabilities aged 0-18 years, which provides the child/young person with a safe, stimulating and familiar environment in which they can become a more confident and independent individual, whilst at the same time allowing the child/young person's family to have a break from their caring role and responsibilities. Some children receive overnight care in the carers own home, while other children just receive day care. What support is available? Shared carers are a valuable & prized asset & Accuro seeks to support them accordingly. This includes providing on-going training and, where appropriate, specialist training; regular contact from a nominated & experienced shared care coordinator; the opportunity to meet & share ideas with other shared carers; etc. We are very grateful to have found such a great family to help us with Ben > we really appreciate their commitment to him\". Anna & Mark - Parents of Ben (age 7) Different types of Shared Carers Accuro is an established registered charity that provides a range of services to support children and adults with a disability and their families. We are currently looking to recruit Shared Carers to provide care in their home and/or out in the community. Accuro recruits both volunteer & fee paid carers. Volunteer carers receive reimbursement of expenses, may provide day care or overnight stays & are expected to contribute a minimum of 6 hours per month. Fee paid carers receive a fee per night that reflects the level of need of the child they care for & are expected to provide a minimum of 18 nights care per year, which may be provide individually or in short blocks. How Can I Find Out More? If you are interested in finding out more about becoming a shared carer with Accuro then please contact us.

Now, following on from his hugely successful spring tour of OmidDjalili Live , the comedian is back with his new tour Iranalamadingdong. \"I've done lots of different things and enjoyed them but stand-up, when it goes well - and it often doesn't - is definitely a love,'' he said. \"There's something deeply satisfying about a good gig. I'm not often happy with myself as an actor. \"I get upset when I see myself acting on screen, mostly because of the way I look.

Public speaking has been with us for thousands of years. I remember even feeling a panic when I was younger that I should get up and speak because I'd have to one day so best start young. \"If you're not too nervous about speaking and saying what's on your mind in a one-on-one then that openness is what you need on stage. \"It's important not to be too hung up about what people think of you.
