        "text": "Pedro holds a degree in Telecommunications Engineering, a master degree in AI research, and a PhD in Bioinformatics from the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland awarded in 2015 with the support of a Marie SkÅodowska-Curie fellowship. Before joining EMBL-EBI's Expression Atlas team in 2021, he worked as a bioinformatician and computational biologist at the University of Cambridge and the Sanger Institute. He has developed new methods that utilise very large omics datasets to extract biological insights, and worked closely with scientists to bring bioinformatics to complex biological problems."
