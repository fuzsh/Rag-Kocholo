        "text": "If there's any county which could produce its very own dictionary of words, then it is Essex.\n\nFor the last few decades, we have collected a whole host of slang words and phrases which make perfect sense to us.\n\nYou don't bat an eyelid when someone drops the Baz Vegas bomb, refers to a trip to Chelmo or even declares that their mate is an utter weapon - but people outside of Essex just don't seem to understand.\n\nSome of them are a little rogue, but there's nothing wrong with a bit of slang to lighten the mood.\n\nParticular words were made famous by the hit reality show, TOWIE, (The Only Way is Essex) which has been on our screens for several years.\n\nWhether the term was used by Joey Essex or your best friend, there are some occasions that a perfect Essex slang word completely changes the dynamic in the room.\n\nIt doesn't matter what part of the county you are from, north or south, mid-Essex or the sunny coast, most of these words have been heard by residents from all over.\n\nHere are 27 Essex slang words which make perfect sense to us, but confuse people outside the county:\n\n1. Baz Vegas\n\nWe've all said it, we all know it.\n\nIt's the leisure and entertainment capital of the British new town of Basildon.\n\nFamous for its restaurants, night clubs and probably, being one of the locations for people with fake tan.\n\n2. Chelmo\n\nIt's quite simple - you don't go on a night out in Chelmsford, you go out-out in Chelmo.\n\nKnown for being the birthplace of radio but also for a first-class boogie in Popworld.\n\n3. 'Aaaaaaht aaaaht'\n\nSpeaking of out-out, it is absolutely crucial that you pronounce it as the appropriate 'aaaaht aaaaaaht'.\n\nIf you don't, how will anyone know if you're going just out, or out-out, you see?\n\n4. Saafend\n\nFancy a trip to Saafend? For those of you not in the know, this is of course our beloved seaside spot, the coastal town of Southend-on-Sea.\n\nIt has the longest pleasure pier and three Greggs on the high street. Lovely jubly.\n\n5. Daggerz\n\nDaggerz is of course slang for Dagenham, infamous for being voted the worst place to live in the UK in 2015.\n\nDoesn't stop it having a classic slang nickname though.\n\nThere is also the iconic Dagenham market.\n\n6. Shu'up!\n\nNot the phrase used to tell someone to be quiet, but an exclamation of disbelief.\n\nYou only say this if you are truly shocked, so shocked in fact, that you forget to pronounce some of the letters.\n\n7. Clackers\n\nSouthend isn't the only seaside town, Clacton-on-Sea is often fondly referred to as Clackers, as a term of endearment and banter.\n\n8. Aite Geez\n\nHello, hiya, aite geez - all the same thing but one is a sure sign that you're from Essex.\n\nUsually used between men, it's a greeting or a way of agreeing with someone.\n\n9. Sick\n\nFor probably the younger generation in Essex, we have all had that moment where you have declared something as 'sick' and had some rather odd looks.\n\nSick is obviously not the unfortunate byproduct of a heavy weekend, but instead something very, very cool.\n\n10. Melt\n\nBasically the opposite of cool, if you have been called a melt in Essex, you are a loser.\n\n11. Innit\n\nProbably the most well known slang from Essex is innit, a simple and clear way to say isn't it.\n\n12. Geh'aht!\n\nWe don't simply exclaim 'get out!', we say 'geh'aht'.\n\nMuch like shut up, it is an expression of shock, which some outsiders may not appreciate.\n\n13. Well Jel\n\nAnother memorable Essex slang term - if we tell you we are well jel, we are very jealous.\n\n14. Butters\n\nSomeone outside of Essex may think this is merely just the act of spreading butter on toast, but it also has another Essex slang term that has come up over the years.\n\nYou can only hope that it is not directed at you, because if you are butters, you are reportedly not attractive.\n\n15. Reem\n\nAnother Essex compliment to dish out - if you are reem, you are very cool.\n\n16. Literally/actually\n\nThese are of course, two actual legitimate words. But in Essex, they have developed into a slang that it often used in the middle of sentences or as pauses.\n\n17. Muggy\n\nIt may have been a few years since you heard someone say it, but if you're from Essex, you'll know that muggy is a pretty hefty insult.\n\nIf you have been 'mugged off' then someone has done you dirty.\n\n19. Dutty\n\nPerhaps another one that has been tucked away in the back of your head since secondary school, 'dutty' is just a synonym for dirty or scummy.\n\n20. Babs/babes/hun/luv/darlin'\n\nWhether its ironic, sarcastic or a loving nickname for your friends or partner, these phrases are some of Essex most loved slang terms of endearment.\n\n24. Emosh\n\nSimple - we don't get emotional, we get a bit emosh.\n\n25. On fleek/fleeky\n\nA spectacular eyebrow deserves to be crowned with the slang 'on fleek'.\n\nBut it's also just a compliment we use to tell each other when someone's outfit or look is on point.\n\n26. Hinchers\n\nWe are proud to be the county of Hinchers.\n\nTaken after the one and only Mrs Hinch herself, this is slang for the ones of us who love a good clean. If you Hinch something then you've cleaned it to perfection.\n\n27. Lakey\n\nOr Laaaaaaakeside. Thurrock's Lakeside Shopping Centre is a firm favourite in Essex, which is why it has donned the affectionate slang nickname, Lakey.\n\nHow many of these words have youheard?"
