        "text": "English cricketer\n\nAdam Charles Soilleux (born 29 November 1991) is an English cricketer. Soilleux is a right-handed batsman who bowls right-arm medium-fast. He was born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex.\n\nWhile studying for his degree in Banking Finance and Management at Loughborough University,[1] Soilleux made his first-class debut for Loughborough MCCU against Northamptonshire in 2011.[2] In this match, he was dismissed for three runs in Loughborough's first-innings by David Lucas, while in their second-innings he scored six runs, before being dismissed by Lee Daggett. With the ball, he took the wickets of Niall O'Brien and Alex Wakely in Northamptonshire's first and only innings, in what was a drawn match.[3] This remains his only first-class appearance.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
