        "text": "𝔽𝕣𝕚𝕕𝕒𝕪 #𝕁𝕠𝕓𝕗𝕒𝕚𝕣𝕪 🐝 Lots of activity in the #SustainabilityReporting & #ESG #Assurance space from the #Big4 accounting and auditing firms in Dublin. Can we read anything into this? 🛬 The imminent arrival of standardised ESG reporting metrics for companies, is a huge opportunity for accountancy firms, as #sustainability ambition and impact begins to be tracked using financial procedures and numeric targets. 🔔 The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), is a body that has been set up to mirror the role the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They are setting financial reporting standards and rules, to track non-financial metrics such as companies’ carbon footprints, decarbonisation roadmap and transition budgets, throughout the full value chain. 🌐 The impact metrics generally align with #EUTaxonomy #SFDR & are being ratcheted up, with the introduction of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive #CSRD, next year, through prescriptive #ESRs reporting standards. These, on the face of it, are broadly similar to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) topics. However the broader scope of reporting, in tandem with the greater depth of granularity and detail, makes for a perfect case for assurance firms to apply their vertical audit structures, to thoroughly evaluate companies green claims. Hans van Dam, #EFRAG 🌿 Applying the rigour of an #ISAE3000 or #AA1000 assurance framework, should hopefully start to separate genuine deep green from green blushing and ESG scorecard gamification. Changing the focus from glossy reports with pretty pictures of #BoscoVerticale, to instead front up the ouchey pain points of #decarbonisation action. 🎈International Standard on Assurance Engagements: ISAE 3000 is a standard for consistancy and verification on non-financial information, including sustainability reports. 🤝 AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard is considered the ‘gold standard’ in engagement accreditation. 🧚 Jobs listed on LinkedIn for Dublin: \"candidates qualified in some aspect of #climatechange, #sustainability or #ESG.” KPMG Ireland Sustainability Transformation Associate Director Sustainability Transformation Manager Sustainability Transformation Associate Nature & Biodiversity Expert Risk Consulting Manager ESG Infrastructure & Government Assets Manager Infrastructure & Government Capital Projects Manager EY Director of Climate change & Sustainability Services Technology Consulting – Sustainability Director Technology Consulting – Sustainability Solutions Technology Consulting – Energy Transition Manager Sustainability Marketing Capital Projects Infrastructure & Marine Energy PwC Ireland Audit & Assurance Sustainability Manager Deloitte Sustainability Audit & Assurance Sustainability Senior Audit & Assurance Sustainability Manager Audit & Assurance Sustainability Assistant Manager 🤔 It begs the Question, do the big-4 know something we dont'? #CarbonAccounting #CarbonAsCurrency\n\n🌿 Join the Webinar: Exploring ESG & Sustainability's role in CFO priorities: EY & CCH Tagetik perspectives 🗓️ Date: April 18, 2024 | Time: 10:30 - 11:05 AM CEST As we dive into 2024, finance departments are set to navigate a sea of change, with a new wave of regulations and reporting requirements on the horizon.
