Michelle Zak will host Qomplyâs breakfast roundtable at the beautiful grade-II listed One Moorgate Place.

From three complementary standpoints, the round table discussion will cover topics that all panellists are seeing in their work on regulatory matters

Jake Green, from the law firm Ashurst LLP, regularly advises firms on their interactions with regulators and specialises with respect to FCA governance and conduct matters. Jake is uniquely positioned to share his insight on complex financial regulatory enforcement matters and the more complex aspects of MiFID transaction reporting including cross-border regulatory divergence.

Adam Soilleux, from BDO LLP, will share his insights into the regulatory activity he is seeing and how firms are responding. BDO provides guidance with PRA s166 reviews, transaction reporting, internal audits, and market conduct compliance across the wholesale and capital markets.

Michelle will not only moderate the session but also add context to some of the issues that continue to challenge firms. She will share her insights gained from overseeing a technology company that checks the accuracy of billions of transactions a year.

This exclusive Chatham House roundtable will bring together industry practitioners from across the financial services sector and promises to be an interactive and engaging session.

Places are extremely limited and we request that you only reserve a space if you are certain you are able to attend.
