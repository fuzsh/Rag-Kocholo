        "text": "A European princess has been forced to issue a statement, denying any romantic entanglement with Denmark’s Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John of Denmark.\n\nWATCH NOW: Princess Mary’s children tease her for her Australian accent. Article continues after video.\n\nThe Danish prince is the son of Denmark’s Crown Prince Frederik and his Australian-born wife, Princess Mary, and is currently second in line for the Danish throne following his father.\n\nRELATED || Is Princess Mary still an Australian citizen?\n\nAs a member of European royalty, it comes as so surprise that Christian shares social circles with other royal family members, including Princess Maria Chiara of Bourbon Two Sicilies.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Royal House of Bourbon Two Sicilies, the family reigned over the south of Italy for 150 years before being annexed in 1861.\n\nMaria is the great-great-great-great granddaughter of Francis II, the last King of the Two Sicilies.\n\nAnd whilst she and her family are not royals in the official sense, they certainly live like them – attending various high society events across the world.\n\nAt one such event – the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in fact – Maria was spotted getting up close and personal with Christian.\n\nAnd whilst speculation has been rife that the royal teens have been secretly dating in the months since the Italian princess has put an end to the rumours with a carefully worded statement she says she hopes will “set the records straight.”\n\n“Prince Christian and I share a close friendship,” the statement began.\n\nRELATED || Prince Christian defers royal activities\n\n“However, some inaccurate information has been disseminated. At first, this situation made me smile; however, over time, this rumour has exceeded the limits of common sense and has spiralled becoming at odds with reality.”\n\n“I believe it is now time to put an end to this rumour.”\n\nThe eighteen-year-old then went on to add that she would share “important events” in her life with the public when they occurred going forward.\n\n“I will be happy to share them with you.”\n\n“While we all enjoy dreaming of fairytales, what truly matters is reality.”\n\nWhilst we are certainly sad to hear there is no budding romance between the pair, we are sure teen girls around the world are feeling a spark of hope that the European prince is single.\n\nRELATED || Danish royal celebrates birthday down under\n\nAccording to Tatler, Maria and Christian have long been family friends, mostly due to Chiara’s father Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, being a godfather of Christian’s younger sister Princess Josephine who was born in 2011."
