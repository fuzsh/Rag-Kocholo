        "text": "Crown Prince Christian of Denmark was honoured this week as he saw his Order of the Elephant shield hung in Frederiksborg Palace.\n\nChristian was bestowed the honour of becoming a Knight of the Order of the Elephant on his 18th birthday on 15 October 2023. Now, the teenager has joined his father King Frederik and grandmother Queen Margrethe for a ceremony which saw his coat of arms added to the Knights' Chapel for the Orders of the Elephant.\n\nThough the Order of the Elephant was officially founded in 1693, the order dates all the way back to the 1400s, when it was established as a religious confraternity by a group of about fifty Danish knights. Between 1580 and today, around 890 persons have been bestowed with the Order of the Elephant; with Queen Margrethe adding 68 people during her 40 year reign. The recipients are almost always royal persons and foreign heads of state – though in a rare exception, the order was given to a commoner in 2000.\n\nPrince Christian was bestowed an elephant last year which previously belonged to his grandfather, Prince Henrik. This handing over was always to be, on the basis of a traditional line of inheritance. Ahead of the shield being added to the chapel, Margrethe's monogram was added, as well as his own coat of arms.\n\nPhotographs shared on the royal family's official Instagram page showed the artist Ronny Skov Andersen added his finishing touches to the shield. The caption on the gallery read, ‘A centuries-long tradition is maintained when royal coat of arms painter Ronny Skov Andersen draws and paints coats of arms at his office in the Ordenschapitlet at Amalienborg.\n\n'The process of creating a knight's shield for the two Danish royal orders, the Elephant Order and the Dannebro Order, is extensive. Only the royal painter performs them to ensure compliance with the heraldic principles. First the weapon is drawn up with pencil, then the sketch is transferred to the metal plate with chalk and then coloured with a few colors: red, blue, green, black, gold leaf (yellow) and silver (white).\n\nRead More\n\n‘The amount of Birkins on the grounds of that tennis tournament’: how the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters became the only thing worth doing in April\n\nWith a centre court that looks out to the French Riviera, this tennis event is giving even Wimbledon a run for its money in the glamour stakes. Just ask: Zendaya, Beatrice Borromeo and the F1 crowd. It’s the tournament that is so VIP it’s even turning celebrities away\n\n'In the fall, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince's Elephant Knight Shield was created. This happened as the Crown Prince - then Prince Christian - was awarded the Elephant Order by his grandmother, Her Majesty Queen Margrethe on his 18th birthday. Yesterday the coat of arms was hung in the Knight Chapel at Frederiksborg Castle in Hillerød.'\n\nAt the time of the creation of the Order of the Elephant, Christian I was King of Denmark – and in fact, Norway and Sweden too, creating a personal union known as the Kalmar Union. During this period, the emblem of the club was an image of the Virgin Mary holding her Son within a crescent moon. This was hung from a collar formed of links in the shape of elephants. The confraternity mutated over the centuries but endured a stifled period after the Reformation, in which such clubs became suspect.\n\nIn 1580, Frederik II – eight Frederiks prior to our current Frederik – revived the order and replaced the medallion of the mother and child with an elephant. But it was Christian V, in 1693, who gave the club its official statues and founding order. At this time, it was scheduled as comprising 30 noble knights and one Grand Master (the King) along with his sons. It was only in 1958 that the statutes were amended by Royal Ordinance to allow the ennoblement of women as members of the order.\n\nMembership of the order comes with possession of its rather eye-catching elephantine emblem. The elephant is made of white-enamelled gold with blue housings and is about 5cm high. On its back, the elephant bears a tower of pink enamelled masonry (a design originally intended to reflect the howdah compartments of the Indian subcontinent).\n\nOne striking detail about the circulation of the elephants is that each Order of the Elephant is – in principle – on loan and must be returned to the Chapter of the Royal Orders of Chivalry when a member of the Order has passed away. This rather quaint custom means that elephants are inherited and used several times by different members of the order, with some dating back hundreds of years. Interestingly, the done thing is not to disclose to whom an Elephant has previously been given – though there are some traditional lines of inheritance.\n\nAs to when the elephants come out to play…there are some rather interesting traditions concerning how and when to wear them. The Order of the Elephant has three festival days: new year’s day, the monarch’s birthday and the birthday of Valdemar the Victorious, which, if you didn’t know is on 28 June. On these festival days, the Order of the Elephant is worn on the chest on a gold chain link collar, with links shaped as towers and elephants. The collar sits on each shoulder. On other important occasions, the order is worn on a bright blue sash with a breast star. The star of the order is an eight-pointed silver star with smooth rays; at its centre sits an enameled red disc with a white cross, surrounded by a laurel wreath in silver."
