        "text": "MARIE BONAPARTE A Life. By Celia Bertin. Illustrated. 286 pp. San Diego: A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/ Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $17.95.\n\nPRINCESS Marie Bonaparte was the great-granddaughter of Napoleon's younger brother, Lucien. Through her marriage to Prince George of Greece she became connected with the royal families of Denmark, Russia and Great Britain. She was the aunt of both Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and husband of the Queen of England. Anyone less likely to became a writer, a distinguished psychoanalyst and a favorite pupil of Freud's can hardly be imagined, but such was her destiny. Her story is fascinating and is told with perceptive skill by Celia Bertin.\n\nMarie Bonaparte's paternal grandmother, Princess Pierre Bonaparte, lost all her money at the time of the Commune in 1871. To repair the family fortunes she arranged that her son, Prince Roland, should marry an heiress, Marie-Felix Blanc, whose father owned most of Monaco, including 97 percent of the Casino of Monte Carlo. Thus Marie Bonaparte, the only child of their union, became heiress to enormous wealth. In all other respects she was a most unfortunate child. Within a month of her birth in July 1882, her mother was dead of an embolism. Her father was a scholarly scientific amateur who became an expert on glaciers, but he was remote, preoccupied with study and saw little of his daughter. The household in which Marie Bonaparte was brought up by nurses and governesses was dominated by her paternal grandmother. This formidable woman considered that gregariousness pertained only to the lower orders, and so the young heiress was brought up without companions, isolated and overprotected. It is not surprising that she developed night terrors, morbid fears of illness and various obsessional anxieties.\n\nWhat is unusual is that the little girl, between the ages of 7 1/2 and 10, filled five notebooks with stories that revealed her miseries and the origins of her neurotic symptoms. These notebooks later played an important part in her analysis and were published with her own commentaries and those of Freud. Her adult comment that it was ''by taking refuge in intellectual sublimation that I found peace and happiness'' is certainly appropriate; but the intelligence that enabled her to do this passed unrecognized when she was a child, and her teachers were inadequate. Very early she recognized that if she had been a boy, her talents would have ensured respect and a proper education. The seeds of her lifelong preoccupation with the problems of women were already germinating.\n\nIsolation is the breeding ground of fantasy and encourages susceptibility to romantic love. In adolescence Marie Bonaparte developed an unfortunate infatuation with a Corsican secretary of her father's who later blackmailed her successfully by threatening to publish her letters to him. Just before she was 17, her father launched her social life by giving a ball for her, but she was soon neurotically disabled by a variety of psychosomatic symptoms and became convinced that she would die prematurely like her mother. She became fascinated by the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, who later was the object of her psychoanalytic scrutiny. In 1907, when she was 25, her father chose Prince George of Greece as a suitable husband for her. She fell in love with him and had two children by him; the marriage lasted until Prince George's death in 1957, but it was a failure emotionally. George's affections were directed toward his uncle Waldemar rather than toward women, and on their wedding night, Marie Bonaparte recalled, he apologized, saying, ''I hate it as much as you do. But we must do it if we want children.'' She was driven by her unsatisfied sexual needs to take a variety of lovers, of whom the most famous was Aristide Briand, who was 11 times Premier of France.\n\nBut as she soon discovered, no lover could overcome her frigidity. Her search for a cure led her to become friendly with a French psychiatrist, Rene Laforgue. He referred her to Freud, remarking that she had ''a marked virility complex.'' In 1925, when Marie Bonaparte consulted him, Freud was 69 and already afflicted with the cancer that eventually killed him. They took to each other immediately. Freud, who was never good at following his own injunctions about how psychoanalysts should conduct themselves, told her about his illness and his financial difficulties and was delighted when she told him that she loved him. She soon replaced Lou Andreas-Salome in Freud's affections and became so much his favorite analysand that he gave her two hours a day of his time.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
