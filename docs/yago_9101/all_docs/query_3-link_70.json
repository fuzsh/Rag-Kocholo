        "text": "“I got five days’ notice,” Prince Joachim briefly shared with the waiting press on Avenue Marceau the morning after the release of a much-discussed press announcement from the Danish Crown. The Prince parked his car on his way to the Royal Danish Embassy in Paris where he has worked as a defence attaché since September 2020 after completing France’s highest-ranking military leadership education at Ecole Militaire in Paris (Rabøl; kongehuset.dk).\n\n“In May I was presented with a plan which stated that when the children turn 25 years of age, it would happen (the princely titles of his children will be discontinued). Athena will be 11 years old in January” (Rabøl; Jensen).\n\nA Crown of Denmark press announcement from 28 October 2022 stipulates that effective January 2023: “The Queen wishes to create the framework for the four grandchildren to be able to shape their own lives to a much greater extent without being limited by the special considerations and duties that a formal affiliation with the Royal House of Denmark as an institution involves” (Kongehuset.dk).\n\nIn response to a question about his current relationship with his mother the Prince said: “I don’t think I have to elaborate on it here” (Rabøl).\n\nIn the following hours it was unveiled how the children were ‘shocked’ and felt ‘ostracized’ and that it wasn’t the Queen herself who informed her second son of her decision. It was conveyed to Prince Joachim by the Lord Chamberlain (Hellensberg; Rabøl; Jensen).\n\nAs the situation escalated, the Queen didn’t contact neither her son nor her grandchildren (Rabøl; Jensen).\n\nIn a split second, it was clear that a press announcement revealed a crisis beyond a title row.\n\nA son, a multi-talented employee, and an outstanding royal storyteller, who spent a lifetime as a loyal contributor to the Danish Crown, expressed his feelings.\n\nIn the following hours and days, the crisis grew bigger as members of The Royal Family either fled the press or failed to provide comprehensive and meaningful answers to key questions about the future of the institution upon participating in public events (Nygaard; Nyhederne.dk; Rabøl).\n\nOn 3 October, a statement from HM The Queen said: “My decision has been a long time coming. It is my duty and my desire as Queen to ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times. Sometimes, this means that difficult decisions must be made (…) Holding a royal title involves a number of commitments and duties that, in the future, will lie with fewer members of the royal family. This adjustment, which I view as a necessary futureproofing of the monarchy, I want to take in my own time. I have made my decision as Queen, mother, and grandmother, but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underestimated the extent to which my younger son and his family feel affected. That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry” (Kongehuset.dk).\n\nGoing forward, the descendants of HRH Prince Joachim will use their titles as counts and countess of Monpezat and maintain their places in the order of succession.\n\nQueen Margrethe II bestowed the titles upon both of her sons, their spouses, and descendants in 2008 based on the French title ‘Comte de Laborde de Monpezat’ after their father, Henrik, the late Prince Consort of Denmark (Kongehuset.dk).\n\nNine days after the crisis escalated in the news, the Queen made contact with her son (Hellensberg).\n\nNine Days…a Flabbergasted Public Awaits Clarification\n\nThe modest, tolerant, education-focused, science- and sport-loving, happy-go-lucky natives of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy-tale country, who normally enjoy peaceful co-existence with the Danish Crown, found themselves wondering in awe: has the Queen gotten smørrebrød down the wrong pipe?\n\nBeyond high-profiled science and development, social and sexual equality along with functionalistic, Scandi-cool architecture and design to say nothing of outstanding, experimental food, Denmark is known worldwide as a sensible, consensus-seeking, trustworthy partner with high ethics in politics, business, and leadership approaches.\n\nIndeed, the agile, facts-focused, team-oriented, and collaborative Danes came to a mental standstill. Having long proved to the world that it really is possible to have a flourishing constitutional monarchy and create a comprehensive flexicurity welfare state while enjoying a steadily booming economy, they ponder: is this who we are?\n\nOne of the most socially progressive countries in the world is in the middle of a dramatic gear shift.\n\nA leadership philosophy-exporting country demonstrating participative, inclusive management styles (Lauring; Leebech) with high levels of i.e.:\n\n· employee involvement in decision-making processes,\n\n· employee empowerment stimulating creativity, engagement, and ownership,\n\n· short distances between managers and employees\n\nprimarily debates how the change transpired.\n\nSix million people inhabiting 1419 islands with 8.700 kilometres of wind-swept, tidal shorelines of natural, white-sand beaches recognise royal lineage tracing back to year 936. Fast-forward from Viking King Gorm the Old and King Harald Bluetooth, Danes face an identity crisis after a string of sudden royal blunders (Heinel Jensen; Bakalus; Luth; TV2; Kongehuset.dk; Buhl; Stie; Hansen):\n\nwhat can we expect from our monarchy in future?\n\nWhen the feelings of people affected by change are not taken into consideration and they cannot identify with the rationale behind the change: Houston we have a problem!\n\nWhen the vision for a better future has been left out, dissonance is to be expected.\n\nThe once meet-people-with-your-heart, hygge-inspiring nation of the North takes a turn as the world revives Hamlet, and asks:\n\n“is there something rotten in the state of Denmark?”\n\nThe question is: will the figurehead of Danish soft diplomacy remain unifying?\n\nWhy the Meltdown of a 1100-Year-Old Crown Is Relevant for any Business Network?\n\nNo matter if you are a royalist, a republican or you are unfamiliar with the concepts of constitutional monarchy and the undeniable influence of soft power, there are many learnings within the realms of character, leadership, decision-making, implementation, change and crisis communications management which leaders and professionals can benefit from.\n\nHow so? Simply because leaders make similar mistakes every single day but depending on the situation, topics in question, people impact and public sentiment, they usually don’t get as much media attention as when a 1100-year-old cultural powerhouse suddenly loses its cool.\n\n13 Steps to Successful Change Management:\n\n1. Leadership is about engaging stakeholders in a vision. Down to the short strokes, leadership is about setting a meaningful vision and engaging employees in the attainment of bringing an institution into the future. The precondition for success is the ability to make human connections and build trust, facilitating a work environment in which everyone wants to belong, develop, and perform. No matter what title you have, the same rule applies: without solid human connections, no followership.\n\n2. Find consensus with key players and co-create decisions, especially in relation to sensitive topics where you need broad support to succeed in future. The way decisions are made, says a lot about a working culture. Collaborative social systems are built around leaders who are interconnected through trust and skill, and it always starts at the top. Future-proof decisions are co-created with those who are directly impacted by a change. When key players are involved from the get-go, it is always easier to gain broader stakeholder buy-in and implementation processes go smoother.\n\nIn contrast, when there is neither involvement nor dialogue between key parties, where do people turn?\n\nNo matter if you work in a castle or an office building, a work environment always mirrors the character of a leader.\n\n3. Be strategic in your communications approach; define what success looks like. Change communications activities support formulation, implementation, and routinisation of change. Whatever needs to be accomplished, start by clarifying what you want to achieve and be SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.\n\nSet audience-specific communications goals for awareness (the WHAT), understanding (the context and the WHY), acceptance (belief in and willingness to change) and action (the HOW, behaviours show commitment). Based on your objectives, develop your communications approach, incl. outlining communications roles and responsibilities.\n\n4. Define the burning platform and outline the attractive future. The fundamental content of a watertight message is an outline of situation and challenge. When the reasoning behind change is clear and the need for change is put into context (the WHY), communication must convey the attractive future, what to work towards and what to do differently. A visionary future and a roadmap of how to get there inspire, bring overview, and often wipe away resistance and concerns.\n\nWith the sequence of royal events in mind, there are many unanswered questions. It is not only about title changes:\n\nHow to build a royal brand in the 21st century?\n\nAre there meaningful assignments for a big family representing six million people?\n\nWhat is the vision for the future? What can we expect from those upholding a title?\n\nHow are decisions made?\n\nWhat social behaviours inspire trust and respect? How do we treat loyal family members as they grow older and move down the line of succession?\n\nDoes passion and talent play a role or is lineage all that counts?\n\nWill the answers be in tune with the times reflecting public sentiment?\n\n5. Demonstrate stakeholder empathy. People react to news of change in different ways at different times and attitudes evolve. Map out everyone who has something at stake and consider multiple stakeholder feelings, values, worldviews, and preferences: who will be directly impacted by the change and how does the outside world perceive the change?\n\nThis is usually where communication goes wrong when communicators are not in tune with the times. Social scientists are educated to predict, assess, comprehend, and incorporate stakeholder sentiment, changing societal values and trends or public discourse into messages. If we listen to understand how to change and respond, crisis situations will never occur, right?\n\nThe problem may also be that leaders are either headstrong or blinded by their own ‘rational’ agenda typically using an old-fashioned, top-down approach forgetting that there are other agendas. The future of not only the brand of an individual leader, but indeed, an institution is at stake. While logic is crucial, feelings will always come before any rational, cognitive thought.\n\nA watertight, balanced, and tested message can help facilitate understanding, acceptance, and gain support of target audiences. All changes must be explainable and defendable. Review the messaging carefully considering what motivates and demotivates different stakeholders. Success depends on ability to emphasize with stakeholder wishes, needs and preferences and respectfully announce change whilst recognising the successes of the past.\n\nAs always: the quality of a message depends on the perception of receivers. When people refer to the Queen as ‘ice queen’, brand devaluation is a fact (Johnston; Taylor).\n\n6. Stick to the truth. Fundamentally, there are two kinds of people: those who trade in lies and those who trade in truths. As Abraham Lincoln once said: “You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time” (abrahimlincolmassociation.org).\n\nThe truth will come out, so resist the temptation to justify difficult decisions by referring to rules, practices or customs that don’t exist. Any scientist who compares apples with pears will lose both credibility and employment in a split second.\n\nMonarchical situations and decisions are simply not comparable; stripping royals of titles the way it was done a few days ago has no precedence anywhere. Removing HRH is not the same as removing princely titles (Kungahuset.se; Sewell).\n\nThe American politician, Alan Kooi Simpson, eloquently said:” If you have integrity, nothing else matters. If you don’t have integrity, nothing else matters.”\n\n7. Role-clarity increases stakeholder engagement. During change, the first question people ask is always: what does success look like and how does the change impact my situation? What do individuals or groups need to learn, unlearn and/or relearn in support of the change?\n\nUncertainty is worse than bad news. Whenever there is unclarity of roles, a crisis will surface sooner or later because people spend time fighting for privilege and power. It is completely avoidable.\n\nWhile leadership entails calling the shots, it includes careful consideration of the need for talents to safeguard the future. Conduct talent reviews, develop job descriptions and share role changes as part of change management communication: who has what talents and how to bring talents into play, working towards a common vision? Build your new team based on trusting relations to become high performing; harness talents of the group and keep employees happy and engaged at work.\n\nLinage is inevitable, but a ‘divide and conquer’ approach could harness the unparalleled, much-needed communications talent of Prince Joachim.\n\n8. Co-communicate big decisions in show of unity. Form and content can never be separated. It is usually not what you say, but how you say it. Face-to-face communication is nearly always best and no matter how life-changing a decision is, it is preferable that leaders stand united. If decision-makers are divided, subjects will never follow suit. A royal house is no exception.\n\n9. Plan stepwise communication with nearest leader as main change communicator. Who needs to know what when and through what channels of communication – before, during and after a change? A plethora of surveys show that employees prefer to learn about change from their immediate leaders instead of executives, leaders they don’t have a rapport with, external consultants or in this case, the Lord Chamberlain (Larkin; Kongehuset.dk).\n\nWe listen to people we trust and identify with. Consequently, change communications efforts must always be planned in detail to ensure that a cascade of steps take place by informed leaders who inspire trust and master interpersonal communication, sticking to their message.\n\nTrust breeds trust. Without trust, no followership.\n\n10. Provide opportunities for open stakeholder dialogue and prepare robust answers. In healthy organisations, transparency and stakeholder dialogue are top priorities. Stakeholders not only have the right to ask questions to fully understand what the change is, why change (the burning platform), how things will play out, when the change will take effect, who is in scope and does it impact roles and expectations of certain groups or individuals.\n\nStakeholders are also more likely to support change when they feel that the communications process is well prepared and flawlessly executed, messages are rational and consistently communicated by role models and all affected parties take part in the dialogue.\n\nIn a healthy democracy, those who enjoy great power or are born into privilege know they have a greater obligation to engage in dialogue and execute change within societal norms.\n\n11. Re-consider emotional impact (again) before executing plan. Feelings come before any rational, cognitive thought. We feel before we understand (Davidson; Sapolsky).\n\nTherefore, it is pivotal to revisit messaging (WHAT, WHY) and process (HOW) before execution to ensure that stakeholder feelings and preferences are well integrated.\n\nPut your heart first and you will succeed with people and brand. The way you make people feel equivalates to brand value and the feelings we create in other people become our destiny.\n\nSuccessful leaders know that first, we are humans, and second, we are employees.\n\nIn the wise words of the award-winning, American memoirist, and civil rights activist Maya Angelou: “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”\n\n12. Follow Up: listen to feedback and identify need for communication and celebration. Do target groups understand and accept the change or are there any lose ends?\n\nThere are many ways of following up and gather feedback.\n\nAs with everything else, the listening approach must fit with audience preferences.\n\nAcknowledge that change takes time and dedication; continuously monitor perceptions, listen to concerns, and answer questions.\n\nBeyond dialoguing and ongoing response, remember to celebrate milestones and results.\n\nSeeing is believing.\n\n13. Identify double-loop learnings to improve performance. Whenever a process is ongoing or an implementation process has ended, it is easy to run with the next challenge or project.\n\nHowever, no matter who we are and what position we hold, if we don’t follow up on project objectives (what went well, what went wrong, why?) and learn from failures, we are bound for repetition.\n\nGo beyond a simple evaluation of goal accomplishments and instigate root-cause analysis recognising that the way a problem is defined and solved can be the source of the (repeating) problem.\n\nDouble-loop learning – evaluating assumptions, actions, and results - is an opportunity to rethink how to lead.\n\nAny leader who doesn’t actively learn from blunders, should find another job. Communicators, who don’t actively learn from communications failures, cannot be trusted brand-builders of the future.\n\nCritical thinking is the main ability that every professional brings from academia; let it flourish. Take pride in learnings and share beyond your department to make conscious, well-informed decisions for the future.\n\nThe decisions you make in the present will impact quality of life and work in future.\n\n..........\n\nChange is a constant within organisations and crisis are inevitable. It is not enough to make the right decision; implementation of change must be done sensibly.\n\nThe list of learnings is vast.\n\nCommunication is not easy and should be treated with great care and consideration.\n\nWhile a reputation can be mended, people will never forget the crack.\n\nUneasy Lies the Head that Wears the Crown\n\nAll things considered, quoting William Shakespeare’s 400-year-old play about the quality of reign really does hit the nail on the head.\n\nIn the play, Hamlet, a philosophical Prince of Denmark, suffers inner struggles of character as he tries to navigate endless power in-fights as deteriorating division of a royal family unfolds.\n\nIn a post-modern world, the tragedy of Hamlet seems uncomfortably relevant. Indeed, the biggest threat to any social system, including the Crown of Denmark, is division from within.\n\n“To be or not to be,” that is the question.\n\nUp Next 1: “Houston, We Have a Royal Crisis”\n\nUp Next 2: How to Build a Royal Brand in the 21st Century\n\nAfterwards, the series about leadership, employee engagement and brand-building continues.\n\nAbout Constitutional Monarchy: In a constitutional monarchy, the monarch exercises authority in line with limits prescribed in the legal framework of a constitution. It refers to a system where the monarch acts as a non-party political head of state. A constitutional monarch is a cultural figurehead, a visual and ceremonial symbol of a nation.\n\nAs such, a constitutional monarchy is the opposite of absolute monarchy, in which the monarch holds the decision-making power over government and people. The powers of a monarch vary within constitutional monarchies. Besides dissolving parliament and opening new sessions of parliament, appointing new ministers, signing new laws, receiving incoming and outgoing ambassadors etc., a monarch reflects national identity, unity, pride, giving a sense of stability and continuity. A monarchy builds bridges with other countries, heads of state and governments and as a result, the monarch often hosts or participates in business- and culture-promoting events around the world.\n\nAbout Hereditary Monarchy: In a hereditary monarchy, the throne passes from one member of a ruling family to another member of the family following a lineage. A family that reigns by hereditary right is referred to as a royal family. A royal dynasty is referred to as ‘House of X’. There is often a distinction between persons of royal blood and those who marry into a royal dynasty. When a monarch dies, a law or tradition specifies succession to the throne by which a family member inherits the crown. Rules of line of succession may vary from monarchy to monarchy.\n\nFor more about constitutional or hereditary monarchy, visit official, royal websites.\n\nAbout HRH Prince Joachim: HRH Prince Joachim Holger Valdemar Christian of Denmark was born on 7 June 1969 as the second son of Queen Margrethe II and third in line to the throne. After his brother, Crown Prince Frederik, produced 4 children, he is now sixth in line of succession.\n\nAt the age of nine, the Queen informed him that he was to inherit Schackenborg Castle in South Jutland. After graduating high school, he enjoyed a military career while simultaneously finishing education in agrarian economics and the art of husbandry to be ready for his new responsibilities (Scharff).\n\nMarried in 1995, Prince Joachim had two children: Prince Nikolaj (1999) and Prince Felix (2002). After a quiet, civilised divorce in 2005, the boys were co-raised in peaceful unity. He married HRH Princess Marie, in May 2008 and had two children, Prince Henrik (2009) and Princess Athena (2012). By order of the Queen, he moved to Paris in 2019 to obtain a military leadership education and become Danish Secretary of Defence at the Royal Danish Embassy (Majborn; Nygaard). A lifelong loyalist, Prince Joachim continues obligations to the Danish Crown. The father of four is known as an eloquent, charming, and unmatched communicator. He speaks Danish, French, English, and German.\n\nAbout soft power: Power is the ability to influence behaviours of others. It can be obtained through threats, money, or attraction. Soft power is a way of shaping preferences through appeal and attraction. It includes culture, values, and foreign policies. The contrast to soft power is hard power. Hard power is persuasion using force or threats (Nye).\n\nAbout the illustration: Consisting of gold, precious stones and pearls with a total weight of 2895 g, King Christian IV’s crown features small figures to illustrate virtues and powers of a King. Besides symbolic figures, the crown fascinates with its open ‘patchwork’ construction which was unfashionable at the time. As it was customary to remodel crowns to fit the fashions of time before crowning ceremonies, this crown is a rarity in the world of regalia. Designed to signal ‘openness’, it is one of the oldest crowns of this design. Most crowns are (re-) designed as so-called closed crowns. King Christian IV’s crown was made by Diring Fyring in Odense in 1595-96.\n\nKing Christian IV was king of Denmark and Norway from 1588-1648; the longest-reigning monarch of Scandinavia. With absolute monarchy, the courageous King had a vivid sense of duty and an inventive energy. Christian initiated many projects generating unmatched stability and wealth to his kingdom. He achieved a legacy of popularity, and his building activities is a testimony of his work ethics and great sense of aesthetics. In 1629, the king rebuilt Kronborg Castle, the castle of Hamlet, after a fire. (Bain)\n\nThe Danish Crown Regalia are symbols of the Danish monarchy. They consist of crowns, a sceptre, an orb, the sword of state and an ampulla. Enjoy Danish regalia and crown jewels close-up in the treasury of Rosenborg Castle, Copenhagen, which King Christian IV built in 1606-07 as his summerhouse.\n\nAbout ‘To Be or Not to Be’: The opening phrase of Prince Hamlet’s speech represents the internal struggle over the purpose of human existence and the meaning of life and death: is it better to live or to die? Weighing the pros and cons of human existence in the face of life’s endless sorrows, he is unable to conclude as nobody knows which is the better option. Torn between being and not being, the inevitable pain of life and the fear of the uncertainty of death, the phrase is the most widely known and quoted line in English literature. It signifies a dilemma or duality.\n\nAbout the author: Malene is a social scientist and branding strategist with 20 years of global working experience who passionately partners with executives and leaders to stimulate dialoguing efforts with the most important stakeholders.
