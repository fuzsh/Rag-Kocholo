        "text": "HRH Crown Prince Christian has graduated high school and the whole family joined him to celebrate.\n\nAlong with his parents and three siblings, Prince Christian stood outside Ordrup Gymnasium posing for pictures and speaking to the press.\n\nJust like his other classmates, the young royal wore a traditional studenterhue graduation cap to mark the huge milestone.\n\nWhile the next stages of his education have not been confirmed it is believed Prince Christian will continue with his studies at University, and then like most royals, undertake some form of military training.\n\nKeep reading for everything you need to know about Princess Mary and Prince Frederik’s eldest son.\n\nPeople have always been curious about the eldest son of King Frederik and Queen Mary. Now that Prince Christian is first in line for the throne, there is understandably even more intrigue.\n\nMany are also drawn in by his charm and good looks, proof that he inherited his father’s handsome features and his mother’s good humour.\n\nSo who is Prince Christian, and how has the 18-year-old, who is half-Australian half-Danish, flown under the radar until now?\n\nWe’ve uncovered everything you need to know about this dashing young royal as he gears up to one day be king.\n\nWhen was Prince Christian born?\n\nThe first child of Prince Frederik and Princess Mary, Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John was born on October 15, 2005.\n\nMary gave birth just before 2am at Rigshospitalet, the Copenhagen University Hospital, in Denmark.\n\nIn his first few days, Christian suffered from neonatal jaundice that gave his skin a slight yellow tinge.\n\nThe condition is fairly common and usually harmless. However, he was examined by doctors and received light treatment before making a full recovery.\n\nAs the first Danish royal heir born since his father in 1968, there was much celebration around Denmark when Christian arrived. And of course in Australia too.\n\nWhy is Prince Christian’s name special?\n\nFrederik and Mary followed royal tradition when naming their son.\n\nIn Denmark, each king alternates between the names Frederik and Christian. This means a son born to Crown Prince Frederik would be called Christian.\n\nIf Prince Christian grows up to have a son of his own, he could choose to continue the tradition and name the child Frederik.\n\nIn a touching tribute to her Australian roots, Princess Mary also gave a nod to her father John Donaldson in Christian’s middle name.\n\nWhat was Prince Christian’s childhood like?\n\nChristian was baptised at just over three months old, on January 21, 2006, in Christiansborg Palace Chapel.\n\nThe royal bub made his first visit to Australia at the end of 2006, just before his first birthday.\n\nHowever, Mary and Frederik chose to keep their son’s upbringing relatively private in his early years.\n\nTheir 2006 visit to Australia was a private one, with the young family travelling to Tasmania to visit Mary’s relatives rather than undertaking an official royal tour.\n\nIt wasn’t until 2012 that Prince Christian would attend his first official royal engagement with his grandmother, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\n\nJust six years old at the time, the young royal stole hearts across Denmark and Australia.\n\nWhere did Prince Christian attend school?\n\nMary and Frederik broke away from Danish royal tradition when they decided to enrol their son at preschool in 2007.\n\nHe was the first Danish royal heir to attend preschool and went on to break more traditions when he started “big school” in 2011.\n\nThat year, Christian became the first Danish royal to attend a public state school – Tranegårdskolen in Hellerup. It caused quite a stir at the time. But now that all of his younger siblings followed suit and also attended Tranegårdskolen, it’s much more accepted.\n\nAt the start of 2020, all four of the royal children – Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine – began what was supposed to be a 12-week program at the Lemania-Verbier International School in Switzerland.\n\nHowever, just weeks into their studies the coronavirus pandemic hit and their parents soon withdrew them and returned to Denmark.\n\nChristian then attended Herlufsholm School in Næstved. However, he was transferred to Ordrup Gymnasium in 2022 when allegations of sexual abuse and bullying were made against the boarding school. The prince graduated from Ordrup in June 2024.\n\nWhat have Prince Christian’s parents said about the young royal?\n\nDays after Christian was born, King Frederik revealed he cried when Mary delivered their son.\n\n“You don’t stand there and act like Superman,” he told the newspaper BT.\n\n“We [men] can’t in our wildest dreams imagine what happens for the woman.”\n\nFrederik also told reporters that baby Christian would sleep “within an arm’s length” of his and Mary’s bed.\n\nMeanwhile, Queen Mary has kept quiet about, well, being a mum.\n\nThough it’s obvious she adores each of her children, she rarely shares details with the public.\n\nWill Prince Christian be King one day?\n\nYes! Christian is currently first in line to the Danish throne.\n\nPrince Frederik became King of Denmark on January 14, 2024, after his mother Queen Margrethe II abdicated.\n\nAfter his father’s ascension to the throne, Christian became his heir apparent and ramped up his training to one day be king.\n\nAlthough, with that being said. his training is already underway.\n\nIn November 2023, shortly after Christian came of age, he made a solemn declaration that he would abide by the Constitution. It marked the first time in 100 years, that there would be a successor and an heir to the throne of legal age who could step in as regent.\n\nHis younger sister Princess Isabella is currently second in line to the throne after Christian, but when he has children she will be bumped down."
