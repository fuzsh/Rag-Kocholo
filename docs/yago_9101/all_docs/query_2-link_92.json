If he is an Orthodox, all his claims are probably dead and his children are Orthodox as well, at least if he remains in Russia. What position he has in Russia and which titles his descendants will have is anybody’s guess.\n\nPatronym is easy, Vladimirovich.

Or am I getting him mixed up with Gustaf Vasa (Erik XIV's son)\n\nHis claims was very weak already as his mother was a left hand wife. His conversion doesn't change anything de jura, there was no religious limitation on being elected king of Denmark, on the other hand in practice the Danish nobility would never have elected a non-Protestant as king, I could barely imagine them electing a non-Lutheran Protestant as king. The Danish nobility was rigid High Lutherans far more than the royal family were, which was one of the few thing which favoured Frederick III in his election."
