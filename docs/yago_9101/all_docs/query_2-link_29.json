        "text": "A Royal Wedding\n\nIn 1923, Eleanor had visited her cousin, Baroness von Schilling in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was there that she met a Danish prince, Viggo Christian Adolf Georg. He was the son of Prince Valdemar and Princess Marie, and a cousin of King Christian of Denmark. During the next year, there was much speculation in the press about the couple and a possible marriage. Eventually, Margaret and Viggo announced their engagement, and the Prince renounced his right to the throne in order to marry the American commoner. The two wed at Calvary Church in New York City on June 10, 1924. The New York Times and other national newspapers covered the social event, many stating that there had never been a marriage in the history of New York of such importance. The new couple assumed the titles of Prince and Princess Viggo, Count and Countess of Rosenborg. After the wedding, a reception for 1,500 people was hosted by Miss Sally and Nellie Hewitt, the bride's aunts, at their home on 9 Lexington Ave. Shortly thereafter, the new couple stayed at Ringwood Manor for their honeymoon. The upstairs bedroom was completely redone for the royal couple's stay, with the walls painted a deep pink hue and the furniture reupholstered in rose-patterned fabric.\n\nLife in Denmark\n\nAfter their wedding and honeymoon, the Prince and Princess moved to Copenhagen, where they lived the rest of their lives. They had no children. The couple was extremely popular in Denmark, with Princess Viggo becoming very involved in charity work. She was also known to be quite active as an equestrian and bicyclist. During World War II, the Princess refused to flee the country during its occupation, and she was said to have knitted woolen sweaters and socks for prison-camp internees.\n\nInheritances & Donations\n\nPrincess Viggo inherited the Hewitt family's Bar Harbor,\n\nMaine home after the death of her aunt, Miss Sally Hewitt.\n\nShe also inherited the bulk of her aunts' clothing and accessories, along with other items of value. She donated many of these items to the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, and the Museum at Cooper Union. When her uncle, Erskine Hewitt, died, she inherited a vast sum of money that enabled her to continue her charity and philanthropic work."
