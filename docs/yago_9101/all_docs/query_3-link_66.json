        "text": "Happy International Women’s Day!\n\nFor the last few years, I’ve marked International Women’s Day by compiling and posting on Facebook a list of some of my favorite female historical figures. I’ve decided to consolidate and expand those lists here, where I hope they will be prove interesting and edifying, helping to show that, as a wise friend put it to me once, “capable, independent women are not some new-fangled leftist invention”. There’s no real rhyme or reason behind the choices made, except that these are all people who’s lives I find fascinating, and in many cases, whom I don’t think are as well-known to the general public as they should be. Due to the ongoing pandemic this is getting posted about two weeks late, but it’s still Women’s History Month here in the United States so it still counts.\n\nQueen Artemisia I of Caria (5th Century BCE): Queen of the city of Halicarnassus and a satrap of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, she commanded a squadron of ships in the armada sent by Xerxes against Greece. According to the historian Herodotus, she was the only commander to warn the King of Kings that at an attack on the assembled Hellenic navy was foolish and unnecessary. “Tell the King to spare his ships and not do a naval battle because our enemies are much stronger than us in the sea, as men are to women. And why does he need to risk a naval battle?….The Greeks can’t hold out against him for very long. They will leave for their cities, because they don’t have food in store on this island, as I have learned, and when our army will march against the Peloponnese they who have come from there will become worried and they will not stay here to fight to defend Athens.” Instead, Xerxes ordered his fleet to attack, leading to the disastrous Battle of Salamis that turned the tide of the Persian invasion and forced the Persian army to retreat. Herodotus also says that it was her performance in this otherwise catastrophic battle that led a disgruntled Xerxes to exclaim “My men have become women; and my women, men!” (Source)\n\nTrưng Sisters (c. 12-43 CE): After nearly two hundred and fifty years of Chinese rule in Northern Vietnam, the semi-legendary sisters Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị led a major revolt against the Han Dynasty. They are well attested to in both Chinese and Vietnamese accounts, though the details vary and are hard to pin down. The sisters were the children of a Vietnamese military official who is said to have trained his children in the martial arts. When Trưng Trắc’s husband Thi Sách was executed by the soliders of the Chinese occupation, they raised their banner in rebellion. With (according to some sources) an army mostly consisting of women, the sisters captured sixty-five cities, liberated northern Vietnam, and ruled it as queens for three years before being defeated by a Chinese counterattack. Traditions vary as to whether they were executed by the victorious Han troops or committed suicide. They are now considered to be Vietnamese national heroines and symbol of the country’s (in)famous resistance to foreign rule. (Source)\n\nHypatia (c. 360-415 CE): A female astronomer, mathematician, and pagan philosopher who lived in Alexandria during the 4th and 5th centuries CE. She wrote extensive commentaries, most of which have not survived, and is known to have been widely regarded as a teacher and counselor during her lifetime. She is one of the earliest female mathematicians of whom we have any significant data. Though one of the most prominent Neoplatanists of her day, she taught Christian students and corresponded with prominent Christian scholars as well as pagans. Bishop Synesius of Cyrene wrote of her: “a person so renowned, her reputation seemed literally incredible. We have seen and heard for ourselves she who honorably presides over the mysteries of philosophy.” In 415 CE she became embroiled in a power struggle between the hardline Christian Bishop Cyril of Alexandria and the Roman Prefect, Orestes, who objected to Cyril’s expulsion of Alexandrian Jews. Though Hypatia’s role in the conflict seems to have been limited, she was widely known as a friend and advisor to Orestes. In March 415, she was attacked by a mob of Christians, who dragged her into a Church, stripped her naked, murdered her, and mutilated her body. This was a seen as a huge scandal, even at the time, as philsophers were widely respected and considered sacrosanct, and was widely condemned, with the Roman Emperor himself launching an investigation into Cyril’s culpability, It did not prevent him from becoming a Doctor of the Church, Father of the Church, and Saint. (Source)\n\nIkeda San (c. 1560s-? CE) Details on her, especially in English, are scare. A female noblewoman during the late Sengoku period, she is reputed to have not only fought in battle, but also led a unit of several hundred female musketeers. She served Oda Nobunaga, and then later Hideyoshi, two of the three great unifiers of Japan, leading her troops in the Siege of Gifu Castle and the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute. She is said to have later received a fiefdom in her right worth “10,000 koku”. (Source)\n\nEmpress Catherine the Great (1729-1796 CE): It’s a tale as old as time. Minor German noblewoman is married to Czar of Russia. Czar turns out to be a gibbering idiot, so minor German noblewoman overthrows him in a military coup d’etat, has him murdered, and usurps control over the Russian Empire, which she proceeds to rule as absolute sovereign for the next thirty years. Despite the fact that she had no legitimate claim to the throne, Catherine was able to consolidate power rapidly and reign over what is often considered Imperial Russia’s golden age. A so-called ‘Enlightenment Despot’, Catherine encouraged the arts and culture, patronizing libraries and museums and institutes of higher learning. She oversaw governmental reforms, most famously convening a convocation of representatives of all classes of Russian society in 1767 called the All-Russian Legislative Commission to overhaul the Russian legal code, issuing a new corpus of laws heavily inspired by the ongoing French enlightenment. She introduced both paper money and smallpox inoculation to the Empire as well, and maintained a correspondence with Voltaire for many years. Militarily, she oversaw the conquest of the Crimea and the Black Sea regions, the Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the colonization of Alaska. She never remarried, though she had a series of high-profile official lovers. The claim that she died attempting to have sex with her horse is, however, a baseless slander with no basis in fact. (Source)\n\nRani Lakshmibai of Jhasi (1828-1858 CE): An Indian noblewoman, Lakshmibai was the wife of the Maharaja of Jhansi. When he died, the British East India Company refused to accept the legitimacy of their adopted son and heir and applied the Doctrine of Lapse, seizing the territory for themselves. This was an ongoing source of tension between the British and their Indian vassals, as the Hindus saw no problem with adoptive heirs while the Europeans considered them by definition illegitimate. When the Great Indian Mutiny erupted, the local sepoy garrison mutinied and massacred the British officers being leaving, and the deposed Rani assumed control of the territory in the absence of any other authority. After months without any support from British authority and attacks by other Indian vassals of the East India Company, she proclaimed independence, announcing: “We fight for independence. In the words of Lord Krishna, we will if we are victorious, enjoy the fruits of victory, if defeated and killed on the field of battle, we shall surely earn eternal glory and salvation.” For two months she held the city of Jhasi against a British siege before they finally broke through the walls. Famously, the Rani leapt from the walls of the fort upon her horse, her infant son held behind her, and led her troops in retreat to Gwalior, where she attempted to to rally other Indian rebels to make a stand. Unsuccessful, she began a retreat once again. Her forces were attacked and routed outside the city, and she died in combat. She remains an icon of Indian independence to this day. In 1878, a British officer who had served in the Mutiny wrote of her in his memoirs: ‘Whatever her faults in British eyes may have been, her countrymen will ever remember that she was driven by ill-treatment into rebellion, and that she lived and died for her country, We cannot forget her contribution for India.” (Source)\n\nConstance Markievicz (1868-1927 CE): Daughter of an Anglo-Irish nobleman, raised in the heights of English society, Markievicz became an Irish nationalist, suffragist, socialist, revolutionary, and labor activist. She campaigned for women’s suffrage in England and was a member of Sinn Féin and the Irish Citizen Army, she helped found Cumann na mBan, an Irish women’s paramilitary organization, and Fianna Éireann, an Irish nationalist youth organization, she fought in the Easter Rising and the Irish Civil War. She was the first woman elected to the British Parliament (from prison, on a Sinn Féin ticket in 1918), and the first Minister for Labor in the new revolutionary Irish government proclaimed in 1919, making her one of the first female cabinet ministers in European history, alongside the contemporaneous Alexandra Kollontai, People’s Commissar for Social Welfare in the USSR. She went on to serve in the Irish parliament for decades, and gave away virtually all of her wealth. Her advice to young ladies was “Dress suitably in short skirts and strong boots, leave your jewels in the bank and buy a revolver.” (Source)\n\nMadeleine Pelletier (1874-1939 CE): One of the first woman in France to sit for a psychiatric exam (1906), also trained as an anthropologist, also a socialist and feminist activist, also a Freemason, as well as a birth control advocate and a cross-dresser, also preformed illegal abortions in her spare time. As an anthropologist, she attacked the claim that skull size differences between men and women proved male intellectual superiority. She was secretary of La Solidarité des Femmes, and one of the founders of the French Section of the Workers’ International, which was the dominant French socialist party until 1969, and was a member of it’s governing council until 1914, when she resigned to work for the Red Cross during WWI. Some of her many published works included “Yesterday’s Ideology: God, Morals, the Fatherland”, “The Right to Abortion”, and “The Feminist Education of Girls”. She illegally visited Soviet Russia in 1921, became a Communist upon her return, then left the party in 1926, and became an Anarchist. Arrested in 1939 for the whole illegal abortion thing, died in prison that year. Her explanation for her cross-dressing was “I will show off mine [breasts] when men adopt a special sort of trouser to show off their…” (Source)\n\nPrincess Marie Bonaparte (1882-1962 CE): Napoleon Bonaparte’s great-grandniece, Marie Bonaparte is one of wilder members of a particularly wild family. She was married to Prince George of Greece and Denmark, and had two children with him, but her real passion was psychology. She trained as a psychoanalyst with Freud, funded much of his work, and used her diplomatic immunity as a member of the Greek royal family to smuggle him out of Vienna when the Nazis annexed Austria in 1938, along with his papers, books, and savings. It is said that Freud’s famous remark that “The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is ‘What does a woman want?’” was made to Princess Marie. I do not know what most women want. But it seems that what Princess Marie Bonaparte wanted was to have an orgasm. She was obsessed with her self-perceived frigidity, conducted scientific studies on the matter which she published in the journal Bruxelles-Médical, and designed a terrifying-sounding medical procedure, which she had preformed on herself. Twice. None of this prevented her from sleeping with Aristide Briand, the Prime Minister of France between 1916 and 1919, Rudolph Loewenstein, and a number of other men. Her husband objected to much of this, (mostly it seems, from the embarasing publicity. He was widely believed to be sleeping with his uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark), but Princess Marie’s maternal grandfather had been François Blanc ‘the Casino King’, the man who turned Monte Carlo into the gambling capitol of the world, and he had left her personally a fortune of 60 million francs. She also funded some anthropoligical expeditions, translated much of Freud’s work into French, wrote a biography of Edgar Allen Poe, and founded the Société Psychoanalytique de Paris. (Source)\n\nMiluna Savić (1888-1973 CE): A Serbian girl, she disguised herself as a man and joined the army in place of her brother when he was called up to fight in the Second Balkan War of 1913. I have literally no idea why she did this, but she demonstrated exemplary service and was promoted to corporal. After being injured at the Battle of Bregalnica, her true identity was revealed. She was offered a transfer to a nursing division, but requested to remain an infantry solder, a request which was granted. She served in the Serbian military throughout World War I with great distinction, and was awarded the Order of Karađorđe’s Star twice, the Miloš Obilić medal, the French Légion d’honneur and Croix de Guerre, the Russian Cross of St. George, and the British Order of St Michael and St George, making her the most decorated female soldier in history. After the war she was briefly married and divorced, before raising four daughters (three adopted) through a series of service jobs in Belgrade. She was mostly forgotten until the 1970s, when a wave of renewed public interest in her story led to the city assembly giving her an apartment in 1972. (Source)\n\nEmily Hahnn (1905-1997 CE): A female journalist who traveled the world in the early 20th century, Emily Hahn was from a German Jewish family in St. Louis, Missouri. She attended the University of Wisconson-Madison, where she became the first woman to graduate with a degree in Mining Engineering, that she aquired because they told her she wasn’t allowed to. Before graduating she drove across the United States in a Model T. After graduating, she got a job in the Belgian Congo, which led to her walking across Central Africa, and lived for a time in Italy and Britain. She took a trip to China in 1935, ran into the Jewish multimillionaire Sir Victor Sasoon in Shanghai (I believe in a hair salon), became friends and ended up staying until 1942, where she became part of the avant-grade world of the Shanghai International Settlement. She smoked opium, was involved in a sexual relationship with the celebrated Chinese poet Shao Xunmei, met and wrote a biography of the famous Soong Sisters, one of whom was married to Sun Yat-sen and one to Chiang Kai-shek. She was notorious for crossing the rigid lines between Chinese and European society. After the Second Sino-Japanese War began she relocated to Hong Kong, where she had an illegitimate daughter with Major C.R. Boxer, the head of British Army intelligence in Hong Kong prior to WWII. In a 1944 article, she described she said that she had “decided that she needed the steadying influence of a baby, but doubted if she could have one. ‘Nonsense!’ said the unhappily-married Major Charles Boxer, ‘I’ll let you have one!” When Hong Kong was captured by the Japanese in December 1941, she was interned, but was released in 1943. She married Boxer after the war, when he war released from a POW camp, though they lived separately for most of their marriage. She published fifty-four books and more than two hundred articles and died at the age of ninety-two. (Source)\n\nShulamith Firestone (1945-2012 CE): Shulamith Firestone had one of the greatest names ever conceived of, and was a radical feminist activist and writer from a Canadian-American Orthodox Jewish family. As a girl, she rebelled against the rigid strictures that her family attempted to enforce. As a young woman, she plunged into the tumultuous word of Second Wave Feminism, fighting to try and force the often misogynistic and myopic Left to take women’s concerns seriously. She was part of the group that famously stormed the stage of the National Conference for New Politics in Chicago in 1967 when the organizers refused to recognize any female speakers or discus their resolution, and she went on to help found New York Radical Women, the New York Radical Feminists, and the Redstockings. In 1970, when she was twenty-five, she published The Dialectic of Sex, which attempted to apply Marxian dialectical materialism to a study of the patriarchy and sexism. The book declared that “Just as to ensure elimination of economic classes requires the revolt of the underclass (the proletariat) and, in a temporary dictatorship, their seizure of the means of production, so to assure the elimination of sexual classes requires the revolt of the underclass (women) and the seizure of control of reproduction”. She advocated for the availability of contraception and abortion, but went further, denouncing the nuclear family, and calling for the development of artificial wombs as the only true path to women’s equality. The book was a bestseller, and helped to spark the movement sometimes called ‘cyberfeminism’, but Firestone unfortunately increasingly retreated into isolation as her schizophrenia worsened. Her body was found approximately a week after her death in her New York apartment in 2012. (Source)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
