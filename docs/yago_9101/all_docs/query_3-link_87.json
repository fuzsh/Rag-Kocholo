        "text": "She could always try her home in London. Or the Cotswolds. Or the Bahamas. Or her Yorkshire hunting lodge.\n\nShe’s the scum of the earth. And their title is complete and total crap since Greece outlawed the monarchy 50!years ago.\n\nI grew up w her in nyc. Then at Brown (she used to come up on weekends and hang w Tatiana Von F’berg and the crowd). She is a künt. Her family was always new money — at a time when that shit mattered. Once, when we were about 16, she took her dad’s checkbook to Warhol’s Factory (when it was in the old ConEd building) and wrote a check to Brigid Berlin for Andy to do her portrait. $100,000. She got in trouble for that. But that portrait sits in her house in Greenwich. Two summers ago, a bunch of us were there and I asked if that was the portrait he got in trouble w her dad for. She giggled and said “yeah”. She has adopted a Continental accent these days that belies her natural nasal NY accent.\n\nThe Miller Sisters got a big push by Conde Nast and others of that ilk at the turn of the century. They were very old-school: filthy rich heiresses who married prestigious men. \"Brilliant marriages,\" it used to be called. Unfortunately for the media elite who were pushing these three sisters, modern women of the 21st century were not interested in such a throwback-type of narrative (like it was still the 50s) and showed no interest in these useless twats. The Miller Sisters faded away, but there was a push to make them \"happen\" for awhile.\n\nR23 - yeah, Vanity Fair was furiously masturbating over their impending marriages.\n\nBut they weren't 'old school' really - they were new money. Their father made their money in duty-free shops in airports/other.\n\nIt looked like old school, but it wasn't.\n\nBeggars can't be choosers.\n\nCP Paul chose the well trodden path for broke royal or noble sons; find a wife with buckets of money to set his fortunes straight. So in exile or not CP can continue to live in a style befitting his rank, thanks to his wife's money.\n\nIIRC Prince Michael of Greece once lived (or still does) in Manhattan (Soho or Tribeca?) and name on intercom bell for apartment simply read \"Greece\".\n\nWhen one reads various Wiki entries for Greece branch of House of Glücksburg they all go into great details stressing linage. CP Paul's consort and children all make sure to mention the Miller family's Mayflower connections. Prince constantine Alexios goes on and on about his royal family connections and how he is second in line to the Greek throne... (as if restoration is ever going to happen).\n\nIt really is tiresome and tedious. As if they are attempting to justify themselves as anything but yet another exiled royal family without a throne.\n\nMaybe it takes one hundred years or so for facts to sink in; that is about how long before the Bourbons dropped \"pretender to French throne\". Even the Bonapartes don't bother any longer.\n\nPeople harp on about the Windsors or Windsor-Mountbatten family being useless; well compared to their cousins they look comparatively industrious.\n\nAm quite sure Greek/Danish RF isn't so stupid they didn't insist on a sizable outright settlement as part of CP Paul marrying that shop keeper's daughter.\n\nOTOH Marie-Chantal as we've seen is attached to that \"crown princess\" title too much to forfeit it with a divorce. Worse to see something younger and fluffier become the next CP of Greece and Denmark.\n\nAm not sure but believe Greek RF while still holding onto HRH and prince or princess after Pavlos's father dies he wont be another \"king\", nor will his eldest son become a CP. If this is true then Marie-Chantal will be the last crown princess of Greece.\n\nR52\n\nMr. Robert Warren Miller is no different than Alma Vanderbilt nor hundreds of other wealthy Americans who got themselves prestige or whatever by marrying off their daughters to penniless or at least hard up royalty or nobility.\n\nWealthy heiresses long have been seen as a catch for kings, princes, dukes, or whoever that needed money; if the family was low sometimes that could be worked around.\n\nPrince Phillip of Greece had little more than he stood up in when marrying Princess Elizabeth. Ditto for Albert of Saxe Coburg-Gotha, May (Mary) of Teck etc....\n\nIt is very difficult for a RF to maintain their lifestyle and status once exiled unless they managed to have assets squirreled away abroad. Most thing nearly all had were portable things like jewels which could be sold off bit by bit as needed.\n\nPost WWI and WWII North America well as parts of Europe were flooded with former royals and titled nobility on scrounge to marry anyone with money.\n\nAfter WWI, the Greek Royal Family relied heavily on money from and American, Nancy Leeds, who was married to Prince Christopher of Greece (and created a Princess of Greece in her own right because of the wealth she brought to the family) and from Princess Marie Bonaparte married to Prince George of Denmark (a gay man who had a decades long relationship with his Uncle Valdemar of Greece). It was Marie Bonaparte who paid her nephew, Prince Philip's bills for clothes and school until he moved to England at which time a Mountbatten (another aunt of Philip) began picking up the tab.\n\nPrior to WWI, the bulk of the Greek Royal's private fortune came from Queen Olga of Greece and Helen, Princess Nicholas of Greece (mother of Marina Duchess of Kent), both of whom were Russian Grand Duchesses. The Revolution in Russia stopped that source of income forever.\n\nIt was after the Second World War that the Greek Royal Family were at their poorest. When King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie were kicked out of Greece in the 60s, they lived a comfortable exile supported by Greek shipping tycoons and the King and Queen of Denmark, Anne-Marie's parents."
