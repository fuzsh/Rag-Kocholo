Age of consent between hetersexual relations didnt exist in some countries and in those that it did it may have been as young as twelve. Also there are several examples of uncle niece marriages hopefully you judge them the same way.\n\nOf course. My judgement is based to the two facts i do not agree for, i.e close family relation and young age of one of the pair (actually if they were both sixteen, would be slightly more acceptable for me, than 28 to 16y). The \"same sexe\" matter does not interfere at all. An 28 y old aunt with her 16 nephew, or the opposite is also very bad for me.\n\nFandesacs, I am surprised with your threads.\n\nWhat happens here was normal for royals at that time. They had to have Children.\n\nThey are a of of bi-sexuals among the royals of the past.\n\nMy dear you completely misunderstood my words. I really do not care or judge that Pcs Valdemar + Pcs George had an homosexual relation. I just disapprove that a 28 years person had a sexual relation with the 16 years old, kid of his sibling!!! Heterosexual or Homosexeual it does not make any difference. It was an adult with a kid, his own brother's kid.\n\nJust put into actual years, and think about Pcs Albert of Monaco having a relationship with Charlotte Casiraghi when she was 16!!\n\nOr Pcs Edward, duke of Wessex with Pcs Harry when he was 16!\n\nI do not think that even now in our modern societies it could appear normal.\n\nFair enough, I do understand your arguement re the closeness of kin. However remember that it was commonplace back then for what we call young girls sixteen and up to be married off to much older men. Especially if there was an inheritance involved. I\n\nOf course.

An 28 y old aunt with her 16 nephew, or the opposite is also very bad for me.\n\nWhat strikes me most in the story of the relationship of these people was that it seemed to me that P.George got a really big shock (if not to say trauma) from his father/parents leaving him alone.\n\nHe must have had a real difficult time after that to develop his own personality and became really dependent on his uncle, even after his marriage (and even involving his wife in a threesome)...\n\nAt the time of Prince Valdemar's marriage to Princess Marie of Orleans, it was decided that any sons would be brought up in Valdemar's Lutheran faith.\n\nWas it stipulated that any sons of Prince Valdemar would be in the line of succession to the Danish throne?\n\n​\n\nPrince Valdemar was offered two European thrones, those of Bulgaria and Norway. He declined them due to international pressures.\n\nWhich throne was Valdemar offered first: Bulgaria or Norway?\n\n​\n\nPrince Valdemar was offered two European thrones, those of Bulgaria and Norway.

It would have put Valdemar into direct conflict with his older brother – not favourable for any of the people involved. I actually recall reading in En kongelig familie (2004) that it was Valdemar himself who declined the throne, but I reckon it was a mutual decision between Christian IX and him."
