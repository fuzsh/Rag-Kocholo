        "text": "...This is why I have speculated that the other Great Powers could issue a challenge to Russia: Show that you're genuinely concerned about the Armenians and aren't merely using them as pawns in your own imperialistic ambitions by supporting the creation of an independent Armenian state in eastern Anatolia. Such a challenge would be difficult for Russia to refuse; after all, an independent Armenian state, especially if it was led by some competent and capable King, would provide just as much protection for the Ottoman Armenians as Russian rule would--if not even more so, since they could have more freedoms and whatnot in their own independent state. It would be hard for Russia to refuse this challenge without also giving the impression that it merely wants to use the Armenians as pawns in its own desires to dismember the Ottoman Empire and eventually acquire Constantinople.\n\nIn turn, if Russia will actually accept such a hypothetical compromise proposal, who exactly would be some good neutral compromise candidates for the throne of an independent (Ottoman) Armenia? Specifically a King who will not make an independent (Ottoman) Armenian state subservient to Russia but who will also genuinely take care of the Armenians and other people (Turks, Kurds, Greeks, et cetera) who live there.\n\nThoughts?\n\nFor the record, I imagine an independent Armenian state in such a scenario (please remember that there is no World War I at all in this scenario) would have roughly the same territory as Wilsonian Armenia had (or was proposed to have) in real life, minus the Russian parts of Armenia, which would of course remain Russian in this scenario.\n\nIn such a challenge, the Russians could turn to some choices that would put them into possible good terms with Romania, a kingdom they were wooing just before OTL World War II. A couple of royals from Portugal and Belgium had ties to Romania. And Portugal and Belgium were not a part of any alliance system.\n\n(1) Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern .\n\nHe was the younger brother of King Ferdinand I of Romania. His wife was Princess Joséphine Caroline of Belgium, an older sister of King Albert I of Belgium. Before OTL World War I, in June 1914, the Russian royal family visited the Romanian royal family in Romania in an abortive attempt to arrange a marriage between their families which might lead to an agreement between Russia and Romania and strengthen their position in the Balkans.\n\n(2) The deposed King Manuel II of Portugal who was living in England. He was married to Princess Augusta Victoria of Hohenzollern. Her father was an older brother of King Ferdinand I of Romania. Manuel might be amenable to being king of a new nation. Portugal wasn't taking him back and it would be a life of exile.\n\nIn such a challenge, the Russians could turn to some choices that would put them into possible good terms with Romania, a kingdom they were wooing just before OTL World War II.

Germany would likely not want a pro-Entente and especially a pro-Russian monarch in an independent Armenian state, after all.\n\nWould either of these be perceived as being pro-CP/pro-German or at least neutral(ist)? Germany would likely not want a pro-Entente and especially a pro-Russian monarch in an independent Armenian state, after all.\n\nI think any ruler would have to be broadly acceptable to the Great Powers, the more the better. In OTL Prince Karl Anton of Hohenzollern served as a Prussian Lieutenant general in World War I. Manuel II’s father-in-law also fought for Germany during World War I.\n\nI thought of another possibility for a new King of Armenia. The Danish royal family was often the source of rulers for new kingdoms like Greece and Norway. So perhaps\n\nPrince Valdemar of Denmark, the youngest son of King Christian IX of Denmark, would be a suitable candidate. Valdemar’s father and brother were the Kings of Denmark. Another brother and nephew were the Kings of Greece. His two sisters were the Queen of Great Britain and the Tsarina of Russia. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and King George V of Great Britain were his nephews.\n\nPrince Valdemar married Princess Marie of Orléans. Wikipedia says: “In 1886 the Bulgarian throne was offered to Prince Valdemar, but he and Marie agreed to refuse.” Wikipedia also says this about Princess Marie:\n\nWikipedia said:\n\n“She also saw to the interests of France: she was credited by the French press with having influenced the Franco-Russian alliance in 1894 and the peace in the French-German Colonial conflict over Morocco in 1905.”\n\nAnd if not Prince Valdemar, perhaps one of Valdemar’s 4 sons : Aage, Axel, Erik or Viggo. Any of them would probably be age appropriate at some point and could have married one of Tsar Nicholas’s 4 daughters. Think about it --- How does King Axel and Queen Anastasia of Armenia sound ?"
