        "text": "Van Crisco, MD is originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, he attended college at Wake Forest University and then Medical School at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill School of Medicine. He trained in Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and in Cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta, GA as a basic science molecular cardiologist, general cardiologist, and then interventional cardiologist, finishing in 2000. From 2000-2013, Dr. Crisco served the patients of metropolitan Atlanta, GA as a busy private practice interventional cardiologist. In 2013, Dr. Crisco joined First Coast Heart & Vascular Center in Jacksonville, Florida. As a member of First Coast Heart & Vascular Center his clinical focus includes invasive and interventional cardiovascular procedures, peripheral vascular disease management and endovascular intervention, acute heart attack care, as well as general cardiovascular medicine consultation.\n\nDr. Crisco is also trained in both complex structural heart intervention as well as coronary and peripheral intervention. Structural heart interventions include TAVR and left atrial appendage closure with the Watchman device for the prevention of stroke in patients who have significant risk for both stroke and bleeding complications on blood thinners.\n\nHe has always been actively involved in clinical trialing of cardiac devices, drug therapies, and patient management strategies, including radial artery access for cardiac catheterization and coronary intervention, structural heart disease, same-day discharge coronary intervention, PFO closure, and complex coronary intervention. He holds patents on cardiac devices and drug management systems and has enjoyed success in the cardiac device industry.\n\nDr. Crisco and his son Max enjoy a sporting life including watersports of all types (diving, fishing, skiing, wake-boarding, and boating), as well as hunting, golf, tennis and travelling. Northeast Florida fits his personal interests outside of medicine quite well.\n\nDr. Crisco’s Recommended Links\n\nTools For Your Heart Health\n\nNewHeartValve.com\n\nHeart Attack Tools Resources\n\nHeart Hub\n\nAHA Journals\n\nVascular Disease\n\nPad Coalition\n\nVascular Web – Carotid Stenting\n\nEffect of Sleep Apnea and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on Cardiac Structure and Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation\n\nAffiliated Hospitals\n\nBaptist Medical Center\n\nBrooks Rehabilitation Hospital\n\nFlagler Hospital St. Augustine\n\nMemorial Hospital Jacksonville\n\nOrange Park Medical Center\n\nSt. Vincent’s Hospital – South\n\nVideos"
