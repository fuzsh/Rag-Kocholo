        "text": "You will be asked to fill out a screening form before your MRI. Due to the magnet, you will be asked to remove any wearable metal before your exam, and cannot have the exam if you have certain types of implants. If you have had an incident where metal has/may have gotten into your eye, you will be asked to have some X-rays of your head/eyes to check if there are any particles that could be seen. An MRI exam can take some time. The average time is approximately 45 minutes to an hour depending on the exam. These exams are typically performed on a Monday through Friday basis during regular business hours.\n\nMRI does not use any type of radiation. If you have claustrophobia, we recommend that you speak with your physician about utilizing a sedative if you feel that you need one. Sedatives are not something that can be ordered or distributed by imaging staff. The MRI table weight limit is 300 pounds.\n\nRegular mammograms are important for your health\n\nUsually. your health care provider will notify the hospital that you need a mammogram and you will receive a phone call from our Central Scheduling Department to schedule your exam. That phone number 603-356-4905.\n\nPreparing for your mammogram\n\nIf your last mammogram was NOT done at MaineHealth Memorial Hospital, please arrange to have prior films mailed to us at least 2 days prior to your scheduled exam. A CD of the images is preferred. It is very important that we have prior films; this allows our radiologist to compare the previous and current films a make the best possible diagnosis. Our mailing address is:\n\nMaineHealth Memorial Hospital Radiology\n\n3073 White Mountain Highway\n\nNorth Conway, NH 03860\n\nThe day of your exam:\n\nPlease do not use any deodorant, lotion, powder or perfume on your breast or underarms. The use of personal hygiene products can interfere with your exam.\n\nPlease remove any piercings from the breast area; metallic rings can obscure visualization of the underlying breast.\n\nWhen you arrive for your appointment:\n\nPlease report directly to MaineHealth Memorial Hospital Radiology; any of our hospital staff would be happy to guide you in our direction.\n\nIf your exam will be covered by any program other than insurance please provide coupon or information upon check-in.\n\nAfter your appointment: occasionally you may be called back for additional views and/or ultrasound. A call back does not necessarily mean we found cancer only that the radiologist has requested them in order to view a certain area better.\n\nMammogram services\n\nMammoPad - MaineHealth Memorial Hospital is certified as a Softer Mammogram Provider, meaning we provide a soft foam cushion called a MammoPad. Cleared by the FDA, the MammoPad was designed by a female breast surgeon for use to make patients more warm, relaxed, and generally comfortable during mammogram procedures while not impairing image quality.\n\n3D Mammography - Digital breast tomosynthesis is a technology that creates a three-dimensional image of the breast that is more sensitive and accurate than traditional digital mammography. It is an excellent tool for early detection of breast cancer.\n\nComputerized tomography (CT), also known as computerized axial tomography (CAT), is a painless diagnostic procedure that uses radiation to generate highly detailed sequences of images.\n\nOur new GE Ascend CT scanner brings significant advancement in diagnostic imaging capabilities to MaineHealth Memorial Hospital. The new scanner offers expanded options for exams such as cardiac calcium scoring. The software that powers the scanner also allows the staff to image patients with metal implants more accurately. The table weight limit can accommodate patients up to 675 lbs. and the table goes lower making it easier for patients to get on and off. The scanner also uses some of the lowest doses of radiation in CT scans available. The new scanner also aids in increased image quality, faster image reconstruction times, and an overall better patient experience.\n\nYour exam will be performed by a radiology technologist that is highly skilled and licensed by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). Usually, CT scans take between 15 and 30 minutes. You may be required to take an oral contrast agent prior to the scan or have a contrast/dye administered by a vein which requires an IV.\n\nIn the CT room, the technologist will assist you onto the exam table which will be elevated and moved into the scanner. During the exam, the technologist will have you in full view, and be able to answer any questions or concerns you may have. You may be asked to hold your breath for very short periods of time (only seconds). It is very important that you hold still and follow the breathing instructions to ensure that the images are good quality.\n\nYou may leave immediately following your CT exam. A radiologist will carefully review your your CT scan images and send a report of the findings to your physician.\n\nDuring a bone density exam, we will measure the densest bones in your body which are the hip and the lower back. This is to screen for and/or monitor osteoporosis. You will be asked a series of screening questions and positioned lying on your back. We ask that you wear as little metal as possible and to let us know if you have had any metal implants in your hip or lumbar spine.\n\nThe radiation dose of this machine is incredibly low, as the images produced are non-diagnostic quality. This machine is not capable of evaluating a bone for a fracture, but works wonderfully in evaluating the general density of the bone itself, helping doctors and patients monitor and determine options regarding osteoporosis.\n\nWhile many know this technology is used to image a growing fetus while still in the womb, ultrasound has many other applications. During an ultrasound procedure, our equipment will emit and record the echo of high frequency sound waves to create high quality images of internal structures. Ultrasound is useful in the detection/monitoring of:\n\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n\nEctopic pregnancies\n\nTesticular torsion\n\nGallstones\n\nLive-action of the pumping of the heart, including the direction of blood flow\n\nIntegrity of many internal soft tissue structures\n\nGrowth and development of a fetus during pregnancy. This includes pelvic ultrasounds. Learn more about pelvic ultrasounds.\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nWhen you arrive, the sonographer may have you change clothing or expose the area being looked at. A gel will be applied and a probe will be utilized to scan to the area of interest to obtain many images for the radiologist to interpret for your physician.\n\nIf you are receiving an obstetrical ultrasound, it may include a transvaginal exam. It is performed very much like a gynecologic exam and involves the insertion of the transducer into the vagina after you empty your bladder. The tip of the transducer is smaller than the standard speculum used when performing a Pap test . A protective cover is placed over the transducer, lubricated with a small amount of gel, and then inserted into the vagina. Only two to three inches of the transducer end are inserted into the vagina.\n\nIf you are receiving a pelvic ultrasound, it may include a transvaginal exam. Transvaginal ultrasound is usually performed with you lying on your back, possibly with your feet in stirrups similar to a gynecologic exam.\n\nFor some exams, you may be asked not to eat after midnight, or to drink a lot of fluid and hold your bladder. The preparation instructions depend on what type of exam your doctor has ordered and what body part(s) are being examined.\n\nNuclear medicine visits can last several hours and sometimes require return visits for additional pictures or procedures. To help you plan ahead, we will tell you ahead of time how long the type of testing you will receive typically takes and if you need to be prepared for follow-up visits.\n\nFor many exams, the radioisotope is administered intravenously, so the technologist will need to start an IV. Often there is “down time,” where you may feel idle. During this time, your body is actually performing the important task of capturing its physiology using the administered radiopharmaceutical. At the right time, we will use a special camera to capture an image of the energy (gamma rays) given off by the radiopharmaceutical in your body. We will do our best to make your visit as efficient as possible, and ask for your patience during any “down time.” It is there to ensure the best possible examination.\n\nYou may be asked to wear a gown during the exam, or you may be allowed to wear your own clothing. You will receive specific instructions from the nuclear medicine clinic based on the type of scan you are undergoing. Please note that these are not recommendations. Because nuclear medicine examinations can be extremely sensitive to outside influences, these instructions should be strictly followed. If you have special circumstances making it difficult for you to follow the provided instructions, please contact our staff prior to your examination so that we can find a solution and make sure you get the best study possible.\n\nWhat to tell your provider before your nuclear medicine procedure\n\nPatients should always inform their physician or technologist if there is any possibility that they are pregnant or, if they are breastfeeding. You should also inform your physician and the technologist performing your exam of any medications you are taking, including vitamins and herbal supplements.\n\nPlease also tell them if you have any allergies, have had a recent illness or have any other medical conditions. Jewelry and other metallic accessories should be left at home, if possible, or removed prior to the exam. They may interfere with the procedure."
