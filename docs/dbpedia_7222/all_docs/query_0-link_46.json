        "text": "Period films – films set in a particular period of the past – have been around since the advent of cinema, as film-makers set their films in earlier eras to look at either actual historical events, or the exotic ways of life (of dress, of technology, of speaking, of thinking and of relating) that prevailed among the inhabitants of that strange place called ‘the past’. Period films, like historic novels, help us reflect on our history and heritage, and the life of our ancestors.\n\nThis page looks at the most popular period films made since the Australian film revival began in 1970. Though most popular from 1975 to about 1983, significant period films have continued to be made since that time. In fact, there has been something of a revival of period films in the last decade, and the best of these feature in this list.\n\nThe best films were chosen by looking at three sources: 1) my personal opinion, 2) the weight of critical opinion (an updated version of this page), and 3) your combined opinions, as represented by your ratings and votes at IMDb, all sorted by an algorithm of great sophistication and mystery.\n\nAs discussed in my previous survey of Australian period films in the 1970s (see here), there are no clear criteria as to how long ago qualifies a film to be a period film. For this page, I have limited period films to those set before 1960. Random perhaps, but there it is: a line had to be drawn somewhere.\n\n(By the way, as usual all the films here meet the Ozflicks’ definition of an Australian film, and thus films set overseas and not about Australians, like The Piano and Moulin Rouge, are not included below).\n\nSo let’s look at the top 40 Oz period films, starting at #1:\n\n1. Gallipoli (1981) (Peter Weir)\n\nSet before and during World War One, this is Peter Weir’s classic war drama, and stars a young Mel Gibson in one of his first roles. It tells the story of Australia’s most celebrated battle, the bloody battle of Gallipoli with its characteristic WW1 poor leadership and massive losses among troops forced to charge fortified trenches and machine guns. The story is told through the eyes of two young mates, and shows the idealistic naivety that led so many young Australians to volunteer for the war, and the bloody reality of warfare in WW1, that killed so many young Australian men in Gallipoli and later on the Western Front. The film has a strong narrative and portrays the what Australians see as the iconic Australian virtues of mateship, loyalty and humour, as well as a loss of innocence on a national and a personal level, and a questioning of loyalty to faraway Britain. This is one of a series of historical dramas, which Australian directors made in the 1980s, which attempted to narrate some of the important events in our short history; the others being Breaker Morant, 1915, The Lighthorsemen, Phar Lap and the Man from Snowy River. The film won the 1981 AFI award for best film and Peter Weir also won the best director award. Mel Gibson won the best actor award, and Bill Hunter won best supporting actor for this film as well. The film was also voted as one of Australia’s five favourite Australian films in a 2008 AFI online poll. (See here for more information)\n\n2. Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) (Peter Weir)\n\nThree schoolgirls and a teacher from a rural boarding school disappear during a picnic at Hanging Rock on Saint Valentine’s Day 1900. Peter Weir’s wonderfully evocative and atmospheric film looks at the mythic nature of the Australian bush, at late Victorian Australian attempts to recreate Victorian England, at adolescent girls with their intimacy and their dreams, and the ability of the Australian landscape to swallow up intruders. The film is at times slow and dreamy, yet with a strong narrative. The photography is gorgeous, like a McCubbin painting or a Greek myth, as are the costumes, and the soundtrack, with its unique Pan pipes, adds to the film’s other-worldliness. This film is a landmark in the history of Australian film-making: it was our first successful art-house film, and it was our most sophisticated attempt at cinema up to that time. It marked a radical departure from the bush adventure yarns of the 40s and 50s, and from the raucous comedies and rough action flicks of the early 70s, and was part of a renaissance in Australian cinema. This was the film which made period films the most popular and respected type of films in Australia for the second half of the 1970s. (See here for more information)\n\n3. Breaker Morant (1980) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThis is based on the true story of the court martial of three Australian soldiers, one of whom was an Anglo-Australian horsebreaker called ‘Breaker Morant’, who fought for the British in the Boer War. The three were charged with war crimes after executing Boer prisoners, and a young Australian military lawyer defended them in a hostile court-martial. This film asks a lot of familiar questions about the morality of war, the pressure on frontline soldiers who risk their lives for distant generals’ plans, and Australia’s place in the British Empire. The story is well told, and centres on a gripping courtroom drama (a rare thing in Australian cinema) in which details of the brutal counterinsurgency campaign against Boer guerrilla tactics are revealed. The film also suggests that the soldiers were chosen as scapegoats by the British Army as they were only Australian ‘colonials’. Edward Woodward, a British actor well known in Australia for his role as the cold war spy Callan, is excellent in the title role, as are Australian greats Jack Thomson as the lawyer and Bryan Brown as one of the accused. This is the best of Bruce Beresford’s many fine Australian films before he went to Hollywood to make Driving Miss Daisy and many other US films. This film won multiple AFI awards in 1980, including best film, best director, best actor (Woodward) and best supporting actor (Brown). (See here for more information)\n\n4. My Brilliant Career (1979) (Gillian Armstrong)\n\nAn imaginative and stubborn farm-girl, Sybylla Melvyn, is forced to choose between marriage and writing in the late 19th Century. The story is from Miles Franklin’s famous autobiographical novel of early feminism, and it was the first major Australian film by a woman director, Gillian Armstrong. Judy Davis, in her first starring role (and only her second film), is great as the headstrong, opinionated, witty Sybylla, who is tempted by the very charming Sam Neill (also in one of his first roles), but has a burning desire to travel to England and become a serious writer. This film is full of humour and emotion. This film opened the door for other Aussie women directors and actresses to flourish both within Australia and internationally. The film won the AFI awards for best film and best direction. (See here for more information)\n\n5. The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978) (Fred Schepisi)\n\nJimmie Blacksmith is a young Aboriginal farm-worker who suffer racism and condescension in 19th Century New South Wales, until he snaps. This is an excellent adaptation of Thomas Keneally’s Booker Prize-nominated book, which was in turn based on the true story of the outlaw Jimmy Governor. The film captures colonial Australia and its racist attitudes strongly, and was one of the first Australian films to tell the story of colonial white treatment of our Indigenous people. This is an exceptionally well-made film on an important subject, and is gripping until the end. There is some violence, which is shocking but quickly over. Angela Punch-McGregor won the AFI best actress award for her part as Jimmie’s white wife, and Ray Barrett the best supporting actor award, but all the actors are good, particularly Tommy Lewis in his debut as Jimmie Blacksmith. (See here for more information)\n\n6. Sweet Country (2018) (Warwick Thornton)\n\nIn Warwick Thornton’s second award-winning film, an Aboriginal man, Sam Kelly, is pursued by white policemen across rough country in the Northern Territory for killing an aggressive white neighbour in self-defence. Beautifully filmed with strong performances from the main characters, the film illustrates the racism at play in the outback throughout most of Australian history. The story is centred on Sam Kelly, played by Hamilton Morris, who is a good man caught up by fate in a murder when he kills a violent racist farmer, Harry March (played by Ewan Leslie) in self-defence. More articulate than Samson and Delilah, this is a better film of a different era. Warwick Thornton’s second film swept the main AACTA awards in 2018, winning the best film, best director and best actor awards. (See here for more information)\n\n7. Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) (Phillip Noyce)\n\nThree young Aboriginal girls are taken by the government from their mother in northern WA to be brought up within the white culture at a mission hundreds of miles away from their home. The girls escape and try to follow the rabbit-proof fence back to their mother. This film is based on a true story which highlights the experiences of thousands of Aboriginal children taken from their parents over the first 70 years of the 20th century. The story is one of a gripping escape and mammoth trek by three small children who somehow manage to evade strenuous efforts by the police to recapture them. The acting by the young girls is wonderful as they trek across the endless plains. Kenneth Branagh is also good as the inflexible Western Australian ‘Chief Protector of Aborigines’ who implements this misguided paternalist policy. (See here for more information)\n\n8. The Nightingale (2018) (Jennifer Kent)\n\nClare (Aisling Franciosi), is a 21-year-old Irish convict on the prison island of Tasmania in the 1820s, who sets out with a gun and a young Aboriginal tracker Billy (Bykali Ganambarr) to pursue and seek revenge on the three soldiers who killed her husband and baby. This is a powerful and moving depiction of the violence that permeated Australia’s colonial era: violence of men against defenceless women, of soldiers against convicts (particularly if they were Irish), and, most shockingly, the genocidal violence of soldiers and settlers against the local Aboriginal peoples. It’s a gripping, believable story centring on the young Irish woman who sets out to wreak revenge on the soldiers who did her wrong, and her growing friendship and understanding of the young Aboriginal man Billy, who is the last of his tribe to survive. Together they travel across the rugged bush of Tasmania, trying to catch up with the callous soldiers who are headed for the northern town of Launceston. While criticised by some for the depictions of violence, these were not gratuitous and I did not find them as graphic as I had feared. Neither Clare nor Billy are natural killers, and things do not go smoothly for them, but they persist because of the provocative atrocities committed against those dear to them. The film deservedly won the AACTA Best Film Award. Kent is a natural story-teller, and the story is important, even if shocking. (See here for more information)\n\n9. Ten Canoes (2006) (Rolf de Heer)\n\nSet in Arnhem Land before the coming of the Europeans, this is a story within a story told totally in the local Yolngu language. One Yolngu man tells his younger brother a story, in order to teach him the danger of adultery in Aboriginal society. The story concerns people from a much earlier time who came into conflict over a young wife and how jealousy and a cycle of ritual revenge resulted in two deaths. This is the first feature film to use only an Aboriginal language, in this case the Yolngu language of Arnhem Land. The story reveals the culture, beliefs, concerns and customs of pre-invasion Yolngu people, and is a fascinating window into one of the myriad Aboriginal cultures that existed in Australia only 200 years ago, some of which have survived while others have perished. The wonderful David Gulpilil narrates the film in a playful manner, and the story entertains as well as informs. The film won the AFI awards for best film and best director in 2006. (See here for more information)\n\n10. The Proposition (2005) (John Hillcoat)\n\nIn outback Queensland in the 1880s, a policeman offers a captured outlaw a proposition – if he helps capture his older brother, he and his captured younger brother will be freed. Written by cult singer Nick Cave, this is a gothic Western which pits brutal police against brutal Irish outlaws, in a battle of wits and atrocities with many casualties. At the heart of the story is Captain Stanley, a tough but fair cop haunted by his years of enforcing the law at the edges of the British Empire, and Charlie Burns, who is tired of being an outlaw and agrees to track down one brother to save another one. The story is gripping, with stark scenery, poetic passages and occasional violence. The performances from the all-star British and Aussie cast are memorable, and the film leaves a strong impression of the tough life of frontier Australia. (See here for more information)\n\n11. The Tracker (2002) (Rolf de Heer)\n\nThree white policemen (The Fanatic, The Follower and The Veteran) on horseback and an Aboriginal man (The Tracker) on foot search rough outback country in 1922 for an Aboriginal fugitive, and gradually conflicts emerge within the group. This is an excellent and shocking portrayal of the frontier violence to which Aboriginal people were subjected, as the white invaders gradually pushed them off their land all over Australia. Gary Sweet, as the racist violent leader of the group, typifies an extreme which, while not universal, was probably depressingly common. David Gulpilil plays the tracker, a man caught between his job and his people, trying to maintain dignity in the face of atrocity. Rolf de Heer has made more Australian films (14 so far plus documentaries) than any other director (apart from fellow Dutch-Australian Paul Cox), shifting from bizarre (Bad Boy Bubby) to sci-fi (Epsilon) to revenge thriller (Alexandra’s Project) to many other genres. But his three films on indigenous themes (The Tracker, 10 Canoes and Charlie’s Country) have probably been his most successful, and this is his best. David Gulpilil won the AFI best actor award for this film. (See here for more information)\n\n12. Newsfront (1978) (Phillip Noyce)\n\nA group of journalists working for Cinetone News faced constant challenges to produce weekly newsreels in the 1940s and 1950s to be shown in cinemas. Phil Noyce’s breakout film about a newsreel crew who covered the weekly events in Sydney and NSW established him as another of our great 1970s generation of directors (along with Weir, Beresford, Schepisi, Miller and Armstrong). This film is blessed with a strong cast including Bill Hunter, Gerard Kennedy, Wendy Hughes, Bryan Brown, Angela Punch McGregor and introduced Chris Haywood. The film deftly captures the spirit and details of post-war Australian society, its politics and personal relations and the arrival of migrants. It especially documents the importance of newsreels before the arrival of television and their decline after its arrival. A much more successful depiction of the era than They’re A Weird Mob, the film won four AFI awards, including best film, best director, best actor (Bill Hunter) and best supporting actress (Angela Punch McGregor). (See here for more information)\n\n13. Careful He Might Hear You (1983) (Carl Schultz)\n\nDuring the Great Depression, a small boy, named PS, is fought over by his two aunts after he is abandoned by his father. This is a wonderful adaptation of Sumner Locke Elliot’s novel. Wendy Hughes and Robyn Nevin are excellent as the two sisters, one rich but childless and cool, and the other poor but loving, who become involved in a tussle to claim their sister’s child, after its father shoots through. One feels so much for the little boy, taken from a humble but loving home to a cold, lonely mansion. The film won the AFI awards for best film and best direction in 1983, and Wendy Hughes won the best actress award, with John Hargreaves winning the best supporting actor award for his role as the usually absent, but occasionally disruptive father. (See here for more information)\n\n14. The Man From Snowy River (1982) (George Miller II)\n\nIn the isolated Snowy Mountains during the 19th Century, Jim Craig, a young mountain horseman, tries to prove himself to other tough mountain ranchers following his father’s death, and falls in love with the rich station owner’s daughter. This is Australia’s best western, a retelling of the famous Banjo Patterson poem about a mountain horseman and his chase of the wild bush brumbies. Beautifully filmed in the Victorian high country it follows the story of Jim who is driven off the high country after his father’s death and goes to work for a large cattle-farmer, Harrison (played incongruously, but well by Kirk Douglas) whose daughter he falls in love with – Sigrid Thornton is at her most glowing in this film. The film features spectacular mountain scenery and breathtaking horse-riding and was a great favourite with Australian audiences when it was released, earning over $17 million (equivalent to over $57 million today) at the local box office. Jack Thomson also plays a fine role as Clancy, the veteran mountain horseman. (See here for more information)\n\n15. The Dressmaker (2015) (Jocelyn Moorhouse)\n\nIn a tiny outback town in the 1950s, a dressmaker Tillie Dunnage, played by Kate Winslet, returns home to face her childhood demons, as well as her aging half-demented mother, Molly, played by Judy Davis. This film from Jocelyn Moorhouse has it all: style, panache, humour, mystery, conflict, tragedy, revenge and heart. It is a story in the Australian literary traditions of Patrick White, Peter Carey or Tim Winton, and of films like The Eye of the Storm, Bliss or Cloudstreet. It has the toughness of the Australian experience, as well as the bizarre touches, the sense of history and connections within small towns, the cruelty, the weird individuals, the small kindnesses and the resilience. And also to some extent the defeats and disappointments. With a wonderful troupe of mainly Australian support actors, including Hugo Weaving, Sacha Horler, Barry Otto, Kerry Fox, as well as handsome newcomer Liam Hemsworth, the town bristles with memorable characters who alternately torment and support Tilly and her mother. The film won Winslet the AACTA best actress award, and best supporting actress and actor awards for Davis and Weaving. (See here for more information)\n\n16. The Devil’s Playground (1976) (Fred Schepisi)\n\nIn the 1950s, young Catholic schoolboys at a Catholic boarding seminary try to make sense of the world, but are subjected to repressive ideas of sin and shame, particularly in relation to sex. The film also looks at the lives of the Catholic brothers who also suffer from the ideas they inflict on the boys. This film is an excellent dramatic story about the lives of schoolboys and Catholic teaching brothers at a Catholic boarding seminary at a time when the Catholic Church in many countries was obsessed with sin and guilt about sex. The acting, direction and cinematography are all excellent. The film won the 1976 AFI awards for best film and best director and actors Simon Burke and Nick Tate shared the best actor award. (See here for more information)\n\n17. Ladies in Black (2018) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nThe lives of two woman working at a high class department store in Sydney in 1959 are changed when they make friends with a fashionable newcomer from Europe. Veteran Aussie director Bruce Beresford has created a lively period film that follows the lives of several Australian women (and a few men) in the changing world of 1950s Australia, a time when technology, fashion and society were beginning to change at an increasing rate. The film looks at the impact of the post-war European migration into Australia, and the reaction of the Anglo-Australian population to their changing world. The film also looks at the changing situation for women, when employment and educational opportunities started to gradually appear, despite some opposition. This is an immensely positive view of the world of Beresford’s youth, and there are a host of delightful performances, especially from Julia Ormond, Angourie Rice, and Rachael Taylor. (See here for more information)\n\n18. Beneath Hill 60 (2010) (Jeremy Sims)\n\nThe true story of Oliver Woodward, one of a team of Australian miners who fought on the Western Front in WW1, digging tunnels to try and plant explosives under the German trenches. This is a gripping account of Australians at war, this time in the claustrophobic environment of tunnels under the front lines of the Western Front. The film captures the urgency and danger of war better than any other Oz film since Gallipoli. The cinematography is excellent and all the actors in this ensemble drama do a great job, particularly Brendan Cowell as Woodwood. Highly recommended. (See here for more information)\n\n19. High Ground (2020) (Stephen Johnson)\n\nWhen an Aboriginal tribe are massacred in the Northern Territory by reckless members of a police posse in 1919, a bond of blood is formed between a young survivor Gutjuk, and the head of the police party, Travis, which is repaid during an outbreak of revenge attacks by Aboriginal warriors 12 years later. This is a story of the Frontier Wars (between the traditional Aboriginal inhabitants and the encroaching White settlers) in the Northern Territory, and also falls easily into the Western genre, with gunfights, murders, ambushes, manhunts, good guys and bad guys. But it is the film’s portrayal of the Frontier Wars that is of importance, and this film stands with Sweet Country, The Nightingale, The Tracker and The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith as one of the best films so far on this subject. Simon Baker is very good as Travis, an ex-World War One sniper turned policeman, who tries to treat the Aboriginal people decently, but is haunted by his part in a police raid that resulted in the massacre of a tribe of men, women and children. Jacob Junior Nayinggul is excellent as Gutjuk, the Yolngu teenager who was saved by Travis during the massacre, but later wants revenge for the same massacre. The relationship between these two men dominates the film, but there are a host of memorable support characters who play important roles in the drama. Apart from the film’s portrayal of this era of frontier conflict, it also has large portions set amongst the Aboriginal population where the dialogue is all in Yolngu, which adds greatly to the film’s ability to show the conflict from both sides. Lastly, the film captures the wonderful scenery of West Arnhem Land and Kakadu with beautiful and breath-taking cinematography. The film works on so many levels. It is moving history, as well as being our best Western adventure. (See here for more information)\n\n20. Paradise Road (1997) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nA group of Australian, British, Dutch and American women are captured by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore in 1942, and sent to a prison camp in Sumatra, where they form a choir to help them survive the hardships. This is a remarkable true story of a group of women who survive through three longs years of starvation and disease, under the strict and sometimes brutal supervision of Japanese prison guards. Though many die, some survive by making beautiful music which brings them together and helps them through. It’s an outstanding cast, with Glenn Close playing the key role, Cate Blanchett in one of her first films, as well as Jennifer Ehle, Frances McDormand, Wendy Hughes, Lisa Hensley, Susie Porter, and many others. Bruce Beresford’s films are always well-made and there is always something interesting and moving in them. (See here for more information)\n\n21. Sunday Too Far Away (1975) (Ken Hannam)\n\nThis film, one of the first of the 70s New Wave of Australian Cinema, gives a different view of the Australian bush to the earlier Wake in Fright. The story involves a group of shearers, led by Jack Thompson, working in harsh conditions on outback farms in the 1950s, and their struggles against non-union labour. The film portrays in a more sympathetic and realistic way the tough life of the shearers, working on isolated sheep stations, away from their families and with only the company of their fellow shearers and the occasional visit to local towns for a drinking session, laced with gambling and a bit of a fight, to relieve the boredom. But the film is not boring itself, dealing with the struggle for better wages from station owner, and the relationships between the various characters. Jack Thompson is truly marvellous in this film, the one that established him as our best actor of the mid-1970s. The film won three 1975 Australian Film Institute awards: Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Jack Thompson) and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Reg Lye). (See here for more information)\n\n22. Oscar and Lucinda (1997) (Gillian Armstrong)\n\nA wayward English clergyman with a gambling habit comes to Sydney in the late 19th century. He meets a young Australian woman with a love of glass and a glass factory and the two misfits discover they have a lot in common, including a love of gambling. This adaptation of Peter Carey’s enjoyable but flawed novel (flawed, in my opinion, by its denouement) makes a flawed (for the same reason) but enjoyable film about two nineteenth century misfits in Sydney, who find then lose love. Cate Blanchett is wonderful, and Ralph Fiennes is his usual twitchy, strangely handsome self, which some will adore. The production looks lovely as well. (See here for more information)\n\n23. Country Life (1994) (Michael Blakemore)\n\nIn 1919, Australian Alexander Voysey returns to the family farm in the bush, after many years in London as an effete theatre critic, to laze around the farm putting on airs. His brother-in-law and daughter are at first in awe of his success but this gradually fades. This successful 1994 adaptation of Chekov’s Uncle Vanya to the Australian bush in 1919 is appropriately witty and touching. John Hargreaves as Uncle Jack is wonderful as the provincial brother-in-law whose awe of Alexander later turns to disgust. Sam Neill is also great as the town doctor, a progressive and intelligent man, stuck in a conservative backwater. Both Jack and the doctor fall for Alexander’s beautiful young wife played well by Greta Scacchi, who has become disillusioned with her self-important husband. Kerry Fox is also wonderful as Sally, Alexander’s daughter whom he left behind, whose love for the doctor is not reciprocated. It’s an attractive, thoughtful and entertaining production which successfully locates the story from Tsarist Russia to the political and economic environment of post-World War One Australia. (See here for more information)\n\n24. Swimming Upstream (2003) (Russell Mulcahy)\n\nBased on the childhood of swimming champion Tony Fingleton in 1950s Brisbane, this is an engaging story of family dynamics, of a working-class father who drinks too much and believes sons should be pitted against each other to become strong, of a mother who has the strength to keep the family together and who shows the sons the love they need, and of children who learn to be themselves against the background of their parents’ desires. Geoffrey Rush is superb as the overbearing father doing what he feels is best for his kids, but not listening to them or his wife; Judy Davis is good as the sometimes-battered wife whose resilience keeps the family going; and Jesse Spencer is also great as the son trying to win his father’s respect and who incidentally becomes a swimming champion. This is a strong, beautifully realised drama. (See here for more information)\n\n25. Blood Oath (1990) (aka Prisoners of the Sun) (Stephen Wallace)\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, on the Indonesian island of Ambon, a group of Australian soldiers have to organise a war crimes trial for the Japanese soldiers who killed the majority of the Australian POWs on the island, but are hampered by a lack of witnesses and documentation. This is an engaging court-drama, rather than another brutal Japanese prison camp film, although there are constant allusions to the massacres, beatings and killings for which the Japanese soldiers are being tried. Brian Brown is very good as the chief prosecutor, trying to convict obviously guilty men, but hampered by the Western court rules on evidence, documentation and witnesses. The fact that most of the witnesses are dead or ill or have already been repatriated to Australia means he must try to prise evidence out of some of the more honest Japanese. There is an excellent cast, with a young Russell Crowe assisting Brown, John Poulson as a slightly deranged prisoner, Ray Barrett as the judge and John Clarke as an Australian reporter conveying news of the trial back to Australia. The Japanese cast are also very impressive, with different soldiers reacting differently to the charges brought against them. (See here for more information)\n\n26. The Light Between The Oceans (2016) (Derek Cianfrance)\n\nA lighthouse keeper and his wife who live alone on an island off the WA Coast in the 1920s, rescue and adopt a baby girl they find adrift at sea. Years later, the baby’s true mother comes looking for her baby. This is a slow-paced but effective drama about the moral dilemma faced by a good but childless couple when faced with the grief of the woman whose child they found and adopted. European actors Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender are solid as the lonely couple, and British actress Rachel Weisz is even better as the woman who lost her baby. Despite being based on bestselling Australian novel, and having a fine cast of Australian actors in support roles, there is little to anchor this story in Australia. It was mainly filmed in New Zealand, the main characters have neutral accents (not Australian but neither American nor British either), and they looked like a couple from an American epic who would have been at home on the Prairie or the coast of Maine or Oregon. Nevertheless, since it is supposed to be an Australian story with Australian characters, the film meets the Ozflicks definition of an Australian film, and the lack of Australianness will not deter many people from enjoying this film. (See here for more information)\n\n27. Romulus, My Father (2007) (Richard Roxburgh)\n\nA young boy grows up poor in rural Australia of the 1950s with his loving Romanian father, and his erratic, and often absent, German mother. Based on Raymond Gaita’s memoir, this film sensitively evokes the manners and limitations of life for migrants in the 1950s, and the difficulties for the children of migrants who found themselves trying to fit in to their new English-speaking country at school, while living a migrant life in foreign languages at home. Kodi Smit-McPhee is wonderful as the child, Raimond; Eric Bana plays his dad Romulus as a stoically good man, making the best of the tough life fate has dealt him; and German actress Franka Potente plays the vivacious, but frustrated and somewhat unbalanced mother, Christina, who gets bored of being a rural mum and takes off occasionally for the excitement of the city and other men, including Mitru (Russell Dykstra). It’s a lot for a little kid to deal with, but Smit-McPhee manages to convey the sadness and the resilience with which he and his father cope with it. The film, made by actor Richard Roxburgh, provides us with a window into this world. (See here for more information)\n\n28. Mad Dog Morgan (1976) (Philippe Mora)\n\nDan Morgan, a young Irish rebel, with a kind heart and a fiery temper, takes up bushranging after brutal treatment by the authorities, and successfully evades police attempts to capture him, for a time. Director Mora portrays Morgan as a polite humane man living in a violent, unfair society which mistreats its most disadvantaged citizens. A young, slender Dennis Hopper is a revelation as Morgan, and David Gulpilil is excellent yet again as his Aboriginal offsider. The film covers a lot of issues from the anti-Chinese riots on the goldfields, to sadism and buggery inflicted on convicts, to the class system of colonial Australia, to discrimination against the Aboriginal population, to the corruption of the government who wanted harsh sentencing to increase the pool of free labour for infrastructure development. But it also works as an entertaining story, based around a sympathetic rebel trying to live in his own way. The film was less violent than expected, and better structured. It’s probably our best bushranger flick. (See here for more information)\n\n29. The Drover’s Wife (2021) (Leah Purcell)\n\nMolly Johnson is a pregnant woman left alone in an isolated hut, with her four children in the NSW Snowy Mountains in the late 19th Century. She starts to receive a number of unexpected visitors who threaten to disrupt her life and endanger her children. Writer-director Leah Purcell gives a wonderful performance as Molly Johnson, a self-sufficient woman who loves the wild mountains, who loves and protects her four children, and who slowly comes to terms with her long-denied Aboriginal heritage. She is strong, determined and knows how to use a rifle to kill animals for food. The film starkly portrays the vulnerability of women at the mercy of the rough, violent men of frontier Australia. The film also illustrates, through the character of Yadaka, the precarious position of the indigenous Australians, who were driven from their traditional lands and subject to random violence and exploitation. The film is a powerful depiction of sexual and racial relations in colonial Australia. (See here for more information)\n\n30. The Getting of Wisdom (1978) (Bruce Beresford)\n\nIn 1890s Victoria, a teenage girl, Laura Rambotham, is sent from her isolated farm to attend boarding school in Melbourne, where she tries to fit into the society of richer girls. This is an engaging film about growing up a girl in 19th Century Australia, and is carried along by the enthusiasm of Susannah Fowle’s Laura. The era is beautifully realised by Bruce Beresford, one of our great 1970s directors, and by Donald McAlpine, one of our great cinematographers, both of whom later went to Hollywood. The film also includes some of our young actors who would later achieve fame – Sigrid Thornton, Kerry Armstrong and John Waters. This is still an enjoyable experience all these years later. (See here for more information)\n\n31. One Night the Moon (2001) (Rachel Perkins)\n\nA little girl gets lost one night in the bush chasing the moon near her family farm in South Australia’s Flinders Ranges in 1932. Her father organises a search party but will not have the Aboriginal tracker on his land. This is a poetic song of a film, as mythic as Picnic at Hanging Rock or Walkabout, about the disappearance of a child bewitched by the moon, and the anguished searching of his parents. It’s also about racism and the different attitudes to belonging in the beautiful but harsh outback. With haunting music and songs by Australian musical legends Paul Kelly (who also plays the father, singing as he searches) and Kev Carmody as well as Mairead Hannan, this is an unusual and satisfying experience. At under 60 minutes, it does really not qualify as a feature film, but it did play at cinemas in Australia, so I’m including it in my list. (See here for more information)\n\n32. Hunt Angels (2006) (Alec Morgan)\n\nThe true story of Australian film-makers Rupert Kathner and Alma Brooks whose passionate desire to make Australian films in the 30s, 40s and 50s put them in conflict with the distributors, the police and even the public. Hunt Angels is more than a docu-drama, despite occasional interludes from real-life witnesses to the remarkable careers of Kathner and Brooks. It is a dramatic, sometimes comic and occasionally surreal recreation of their adventures in movie-making. Ben Mendelsohn is electric as the passionate would-be director Katner, constantly trying new angles to get his films made, and Victoria Hill brings a cheeky swagger to his partner-in-art, business and crime. Director Morgan beautifully and often surreally mixes archive film and photography with his own black-and-white film to capture this lost era of Australia, giving the film a certain noir-ish feel. He also uses our remaining 30s architecture for his action pieces, adding to the overall authenticity. But the story is the gripping thing, of man with a passion up against the big film distribution companies who preferred to buy films en masse from Hollywood rather than support Australian films. This film helps explain the collapse of our native film industry in the 1930s and 40s, and the subsequent drought in Aussie film-making until the 1970s. It’s not only a beautiful and entertaining film about this Bonnie and Clyde couple of film enthusiasts, but a lesson in a little-known part of our cultural history. (See here for more information)\n\n33. Sirens (1993) (John Duigan)\n\nAn English Anglican minister and his wife visit the controversial Australian painter Norman Lindsay in his Blue Mountains home in the 1930s to request that he remove an allegedly obscene painting from an exhibition, but find themselves personally affected by Lindsay’s bohemian lifestyle. This is an entertaining portrait of painter Norman Lindsay, whose paintings of nudes in classical settings scandalised polite Australian society early last century. Hugh Grant is in his element as the timid rector, sent on a fool’s errand by his church, and fellow English actor Tara Fitzgerald is very good his wife, who finds herself tempted by the sexual freedom on display amongst Lindsay’s household. Sam Neill is good, as always, as Lindsay and Pamela Rabe plays the artist’s wife and model with dignified aplomb. Also featured are the buxom trio of Elle Macpherson, Kate Fischer, and Portia de Rossi, who play the painter’s often unclad models, with a penchant for idylls and mountain pools. (See here for more information)\n\n34. Ned Kelly (2003) (Gregor Jordan)\n\nNed Kelly, an Irishman living in 19th Century Victoria, tires of being persecuted by viciously anti-Irish police, and goes on the run with three mates, where they become Australia’s most famous bushranging gang. Ned Kelly is the definitive Aussie bushranger/battler/rebel story, and there hasn’t been a definitive film or TV version so far, but this one does a reasonable job of presenting an entertaining version based loosely on historical events. Heath Ledger is a wonderful Ned, strong, restrained, articulate though quietly spoken and dignified under pressure. Orlando Bloom is also good as Joe Byrne, Ned’s mate, Joel Edgerton plays the traitor Aaron Sherritt with nuanced equivocation, and Naomi Watts plays a married lover of Ned’s. The film takes some liberties with the final shootout, based from Robert Drewe’s 1991 novel Our Sunshine, but it is a success overall. (See here for more information)\n\n35. Caddie (1976) (Donald Crombie)\n\nIn 1925, Caddie, a middle-class woman leaves her brutish husband, and is forced to find work as a barmaid to support her two children. Two men vie for her affections, but she is forced to rely on herself and her women friends to get through the Great Depression. This was the most successful of the spate of period films that were released after Picnic At Hanging Rock, and Helen Morse, who starred in Picnic, plays Caddie, a woman whose good humour and resourcefulness help her fit into the rough, working-class world of the Aussie men’s hotel. The film captures the Australia of the time, with urban Australians learning how to cope with the accelerating changes that followed WW1. The film has an excellent supporting cast, including Jacki Weaver and Melissa Jaffer as Caddie’s co-workers in the pub, in whose joys and sorrows she shares; as well as Takis Emmanuel and Jack Thompson as the two men who try to win her affections. Though a more conventional film than Picnic At Hanging Rock, this film has an interesting story to tell, and struck a note with the Australian public who flocked to see it. The film won a spate of AFI acting awards for Morse, Weaver, Jaffer and Drew Forsythe. (See here for more information)\n\n36. Australia (2008) (Baz Luhrmann)\n\nAn upper-class Englishwoman (Nicole Kidman) inherits a vast cattle-station in northern Australia prior to WW2, but finds that a couple of rogues (David Wenham and Bryan Brown) are determined to steal her land or her cattle from her. She is forced to ally herself to an insolent drover (Hugh Jackman) to take her cattle to Darwin. Baz Luhrmann’s second film set in Australia is a big-screen melodrama, full of action, colour and romance. It was widely panned by Australian critics for its stereotypical and clichéd portrayal of Australia. While these criticisms are somewhat valid, and Luhrmann generally uses too broad a brush, the movie is spectacular and beautifully filmed. It also has an interesting melding of droving culture set against the WW2 bombing of Darwin, and has a number positive Aboriginal characters. Though the romance at the heart of the movie is fairly predictable, Kidman fortunately recovers from an awful start as an unbelievably snotty English aristocrat to display more humanity later on, particularly in regard to her friendship with a young Aboriginal boy, Nullah (Brandon Walters). It’s easy to criticise Luhrmann’s excesses, but despite all its failings, the film works as an Australian epic, and there are some very likeable moments in this film. (See here for more information)\n\n37. True History of the Kelly Gang (2019) (Justin Kurzel)\n\nThis film is an alternative retelling of the Ned Kelly legend, replete with lots of style, rock music, violence, rebellion and cross-dressing. In this version, Ned Kelly, one of a family of poor Irish farmers in Victoria, grows up as his family is persecuted by the local police, and eventually becomes a bushranger and robber, trying to escape capture by hordes of police. It’s entertaining, but probably does no more to illuminate the real significance of the Ned Kelly story than any of the previous flawed films have. Nevertheless, the first half of the film about the young Ned’s growth to manhood, under the watchful eye of his fiery mother (played by Essie Davis) is very strong and engaging. There are many wonderful performances here. However, once the gang go bush and get frocked up, along with a dozen other associates, the film starts to fall apart, and the final shootout is a triumph of style over substance. Nevertheless, if you can embrace the statement at the beginning of the film, ‘Nothing in this story is true’, as many have done, this may be a postmodern rollicking-adventure film for you. (See here for more information)\n\n38. We of the Never Never (1982) (Igor Auzins)\n\nAngela Punch McGregor is impressive in this adaptation of the autobiographical novel by Jeannie Gunn.\n\nPunch McGregor plays a woman who travels from Melbourne to live with her husband on a remote cattle station in the Northern Territory in the early 20th century and tries to form a bond with the local Aboriginal people. As the first white woman in the district, she must cope with the blokey sexism of tough stockmen as well as the primitive living conditions and extreme climate. She gradually forms a bond with the local Aboriginal people who comprise an underpaid labour force on the station. It’s an interesting picture of the struggle to develop the outback and of race relations in remote Australia at the time. (See here for more information)\n\n39. Dad and Dave: On Our Selection (1995) (George Whaley)\n\nThis comic remake of a series of famous Australian comedies from the 1930s (based on Steele Rudd’s 1899 book) still works surprisingly well, due largely to the standout cast, but its appeal might largely be restricted to older Australians who have at least heard of the original films. The film follows the adventures of a poor farming family led by Dad Rudd (played by Rumpole of the Bailey’s Leo McKern) and Mum (played with surprising panache by opera diva Joan Sutherland). They, along with their bumpkin son Dave (Geoffrey Rush), struggle to make a living from their little farm in 19th Century Queensland The rest of the wonderful cast, which includes Ray Barrett, Barry Otto and Noah Taylor, make this film a treat. (See here for more information)\n\n40. The Furnace (2020) (Roderick MacKay)\n\nHanif, a young Afghan camel driver is carrying goods to isolated mining communities in 19th Century Western Australia, when the death of his friend and the appearance of a man with stolen gold, lead him taking a dangerous trek to find a furnace for the gold. This is an exotic adventure, finding as its hero one of the thousands of camel-drivers brought from India, Afghanistan and Persia by the British to help open up the vast outback of Western and Central Australia. Hanif (played by Egyptian actor Ahmed Malek) is a shy young man who longs to return to his homeland but needs more money to return. The arrival of a sinister outlaw Mal (David Wenham) provides the promise of money to return, but their journey together becomes progressively more dangerous, with other desperate men along the way, as well as a ruthless police party hunting the gold and an ominous couple of men also on Mal’s trail. It’s an exotic peoplescape with Indians, Afghans, Chinese, local Aborigines, prospectors, police and traders, all out for their own profit, and many of whom end up shot in the empty desert. It’s interesting and gripping at times and a portrait of a wild frontier not seen on film before. (See here for more information)\n\nSo, which Aussie period film is your favourite?
