        "text": "The Cabaret\n\nFull of hot jazz music, dancing floorflushers and endless spectacle, our Cabaret is a great place to pop a bottle of bubbly and take in a show! Enjoy song, dance, and the glitz and glamor of the Roarin’ 1920s.\n\nThe Bar\n\nA dimly lit room perfumed by sweet vermouth and the sounds of a player piano. If you’re looking for drama and theatrics, sidle up on a barstool, order some giggle water, and witness stories and people of a time not so long ago.\n\nThe Casino\n\nThe roll of the dice, the flip of the card, the spin of the wheel. Test your luck at games of chance and have unscripted interactions with the characters in our extravagant Casino.\n\nThe Office\n\nThe faint smell of cigar smoke lingers in the air as the inner workings of this illegal establishment come to life with shady deals and broken promises. Joe’s Clockshop may be the face of the club, but this room is what makes is all tick.\n\nThe Parlor\n\nA gramophone croons out music and the grandmother clock softly chimes as guests and characters mingle with one another. Play games, discuss politics, or get absorbed into a conversation about hopes and dreams for the future. The Parlor is a comfortable room to immerse yourself in the nostalgia and authenticity of the era.\n\nThe Gaslamp Lounge\n\nRemotely tucked away behind the spiral staircase is a hidden bar. Featuring a secret drink menu and a private blackjack table, this handcrafted room is exclusive. Free from the drama of the night, it is ideal for guest wishing to socialize.\n\nImmersive theater is a dynamic form of live performance where traditional boundaries between performer and audience are blurred, creating an environment where spectators are actively involved in the story.\n\nUnlike conventional theater, immersive productions occur in unique settings and invite the audience to explore and interact with the narrative and environment, creating a deeply personal and memorable experience.\n\nWe like to keep our gin joint a secret. Meeting location and detailed instructions are sent via email 24 hours before the day of your visit.\n\nHowever, be prepared to travel to a discreet location where North Beach and Chinatown coalesce.\n\nOur dress code is strictly enforced ONLY on Saturday nights. Cocktail attire is acceptable; 1920s apparel is preferred. Cocktail attire includes a long sleeved button down collared shirt and tie with slacks and dress shoes; or cocktail style dresses and dress shoes. Tennis shoes, yoga pants, T-shirts, denim, or other casual clothes are NOT considered acceptable.\n\nVIP Entry receives a 1-hour earlier admittance. Guests are greeted with a complimentary welcome ‘short pour’ cocktail, enjoy a private jazz band set and Vaudeville Revue in the Main Bar, followed by a 30-minute comedic playlet introducing the characters and storylines of the show. VIP Entry is perfect for immersive theatre aficionados and those wanting a deeper immersive experience!\n\nPremium Entry ticket holders arrive later and will still have access to all the interactive fun activities and Cabaret Shows.\n\nThere are two unique Cabaret Shows. While you do not need reservations to see the Cabaret Shows, we encourage reservations to guarantee you a spot! Choose between a VIP Booth (which seat 4-5 guests) or a Reserved Seat, which will be at a table or our premium rail.\n\nThe Gaslamp Lounge is a secret bar within The Palace Theater accessible to anyone during the show. It allows patrons an escape from the action of the play. It is also available to rent for private pre-show and post-show receptions.\n\nDiscounts are offered only on Wednesday and Sunday performances for groups of 8 or more. Use discount code “WINGDINGS” to save 10%. For larger groups, we encourage you to explore different rooms and compare notes. Narrow passageways and intimate rooms are best experienced with smaller groups or as an individual. You may also contact our box office by calling 415.226.9680 or emailing boxoffice@thespeakeasysf.com to hear about our group options including private pre-show receptions.\n\nThe Palace Theater is the venue The Speakeasy is performed in. It is nearly 10k sq ft and can accommodate over 300 guests. It is also available for private bookings. Contact us by email at events@thespeakeasysf.com.\n\nYes, the venue is fully ADA compliant. When booking your reservation, you may add an “Order Note” or let us know by calling 415.226.9680 or emailing boxoffice@thespeakeasysf.com and we can help arrange accessible entry.\n\nThe Speakeasy is a reflection of the 1920s. In previous versions, storylines of misogyny, gender, politics, racism, post traumatic stress have been explored. The script has been updated to reflect a more jovial and party-like atmosphere.\n\nThis production contains scenes depicting alcohol & drug abuse, domestic conflict, simulated sex, and staged violence. Fog and strobe lights are used during the production.\n\nBoxcar Theatre celebrates inclusion and is committed to workplace diversity. As a matter of policy, we do not discriminate against race, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, or any other articles of identity in our hiring practices.\n\nWe actively encourage people of all backgrounds to apply. Decisions are based on qualifications, merit, business needs, and the desire to build an ensemble reflecting the diversity of San Francisco."
