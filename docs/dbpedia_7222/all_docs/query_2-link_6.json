        "text": "Watch out folks, I’m back. Sorry for disappearing I was just fighting my own demons, we’re good now. When I joined the writing team of the Erik Reeds WordPress my debut text was a little list called “10 films from the 1910s that you should check out”, a small list of lesser-known movies which, at the time, I felt were worth recommending. I always intended on making this a two-part series, as the real recommendations I wanted to make were stuff from the following decade, the 1920s. In order to follow the poetic convention of the title, I’ll one-up the premise of the previous list and now give you 20 films from the 1920s that you should check out!\n\n1 – From Morn to Midnight (1920, dir. Karlheinz Martin)\n\nThe turn of the decade saw a rise in German cinema as an industry and, in turn, a surge in many film styles that would later on be remembered as classic artistic movements inside the medium. The influence of German film on the style and methods of countless film industries throughout the world is undeniable. Of course, in the year 1920 a classic of classics was released in Germany: Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. That film is often described as the first German Expressionist movie, or at least is considered to be the first masterpiece within this style. I’m not gonna debate any of these claims, but instead consider an alternative\n\nMartin’s experimental piece was not exactly a precursor to Wiene’s work (it came out a few months after Caligari), but it does show a different angle to the same point: Expressionism in film. Most of what we consider to be German Expressionist Cinema (let’s call it GEC) is a set of signs and forms that were transplanted from pre-war German theater, including but not limited to Max Reinhardt’s plays. This is one of the reasons why many GEC classics feel so stagey; it’s because in fact they were often taken directly from the stage.\n\nIn From Morn to Midnight, it becomes crystal clear that we’re watching a film adaptation of a play, but it’s also a lot more than that. Already in this picture, there’s a concern in representing the hidden within the apparent, the latent spiritual forces that undermine everyday life. This concern is one of the cornerstones of GEC, and is why so many of the stories in this movement were related to psychosis or demonic possession; Germans were representing through the fantasy of cinema their own psychological and material contradictions in a post-war Weimar Republic. Through several cinematic tricks (that now seem quaint but at the time were noteworthy), Karlheinz Martin explores a world that is hostile to its protagonist and that, in all its weirdness, is captivating and fascinating to look at\n\nAnd here’s one element that sets this movie apart from Caligari, and that I’ll cleverly use here as a setup for a later pick in this list: this film is often considered not only an early GEC work, but also a precursor to Streetfilms (straßenfilm). What the hell are Streetfilms? Well, to put it simply, it was a movement (or genre) that existed parallel to GEC and is often understood as a dialectical opposite to it, in which instead of the drama pertaining to the internal contradictions of the German psyche, it was a lot more about the external material contrasts of urban life. From Morn to Midnight’s major conflict is not of a serial killing somnambulist controlled by an evil doctor, but instead the financial and legal effects that an attractive woman (at this time known as vamp, later to be called a femme fatale) had on the lonely and gullible protagonist. This sounds familiar? Yeah, streetfilms (perhaps more than GEC per se) were a major influence on Film Noir\n\nWe’ll come back to Streetfilms and GEC later, for now here’s number 2:\n\n2 – One Week (1920, dir. Buster Keaton, Edward F. Cline)\n\nI know recommending Buster Keaton in a list of “lesser known films” is ironic but I do think this short film deserves a bit more recognition than it currently has, with it being as much of a masterpiece as his more popular works, in my imo.\n\nIt’s a fun and inventive looney tunes type comedy short with some absurd and ingenious gags that culminates in probably one of the best punchlines of all silent comedy. It showcases Buster’s capacity to understand film as a medium capable of its own type of comedy, and while this is something he’d later explore more deeply in other films, here he’s already doing amazing stuff.\n\nNot much to say aside from that, watch it if you want a good time!\n\n3 – Fièvre (1921, dir. Louis Delluc)\n\nOne lesser known film movement of the silent era is the French Impressionism movement, or as it’s often called the French Avant-Garde movement (let’s not abbreviate this one). Some films of the movement are quite popular (eg J’Accuse, Coeur Fidèle, Ménilmontant, Napoleon), but they’re often not understood as composing an artistic context and rather were singular in their own genius. The truth is that directors such as Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Dimitri Kirsanoff, Germaine Dulac, and in this case, Louis Delluc, were all basically going for the same ideas even if arriving at different results. Let’s take Delluc’s Fièvre as an example.\n\nAround the turn of the decade, French critics and filmmakers (including the ones mentioned above) together tried to establish a new style of filmmaking that neglected the Griffithian method that was codified by Hollywood and was quickly becoming the primary convention for film storytelling. These artists saw the Hollywood style as a denial of the true artistic qualities of film in favor of commercial returns on top of literary and theatrical practices. Basically, Hollywood was too interested in profiting off of adapting books and resembling the theater to actually pursue the highest potential of cinema as an artform. The Impressionists wanted to go the other way around.\n\nI could go into detail on the characteristics and history of French Impressionist Cinema (we can call it FIC, I guess), but I have 17 more films to recommend so I’ll just keep it brief. Louis Delluc was one of the first film critics (an early critic-turned-director) and also a contributor to FIC. He believed film had the capacity to tell stories beyond linear causality, objectivism, or literalism. Much like the other FIC directors, his films often embrace a deeply subjectivist perspective, in which the images are understood as representing the mental (or even spiritual) conditions of the characters involved. In this film, we see the start of the experimentation. This isn’t the most avant-garde of Delluc’s films, but I chose to recommend it instead of his other movies because I see this as a good starting point. It’s conventional enough to be digestible by beginners but it’s also avant-garde enough to get the gears turning. Louis Delluc didn’t make many films (he unfortunately died young) so his filmography is really easy to go through, and if you plan on doing it, I recommend starting at this one.\n\n4 – The Wildcat (1921, dir. Ernst Lubitsch)\n\nIn the list I did for 1910s films I included Lubitsch’s The Doll (1919), which was a slapstick sex comedy with somewhat expressionistic art direction but mostly just a fun farcical fare. Well if you enjoyed that film I have excellent news: Lubitsch has done one upped himself with The Wildcat. I can’t begin to describe how much I love the insanity in this flick, but I’ll try\n\nIn what is possibly Lubitsch’s most unhinged film, a mountain dwelling gang of bandits decide to invade a military fort and the leader of the gang (played by the delightful Pola Negri) ends up falling in love with the lieutenant in charge. Lots of fuckery ensues.\n\nReally, if I were to recommend one Lubitsch picture made during his career in Germany, it would be this one. Not only for the hectic energy and over-the-top attitude of every breathing thing on screen, but also because this film showcases a type of formal experimentation that we don’t really see in American Lubitsch movies. Aside from so many fantastical sets and set pieces, the film also features an almost non-stop sequence of little framing cut-outs that accompany almost every shot. They give such a different look to the scenes that it really feels like you’re reading a children’s book or something, you just don’t see this very often\n\nTo top it off, there’s also something you don’t often see in Lubitsch’s later films: the overall raunchiness. Ernst would later on be known for how well he was able to IMPLY sexuality without actually showing much, but this wasn’t always his ethos. Earlier on he tried to make it very explicit without making it outright obscene. So in this movie, much like in The Doll (1919), there’s quite a lot of onscreen eroticism and libidinous activity. If you’re into the origins of sex comedies and the like, please check this one out\n\n5 – La Roue (1923, dir. Abel Gance)\n\nRewatching this classic with my buddies as a celebration of its 100 year anniversary is the main reason I decided to write this list down. I’m just a big Gancehead, what can I say…\n\nOf course this is another case of “why are you recommending a film from a popular acclaimed director!” and honestly I feel like among Gance’s big three, this one is often the least talked about – or watched, even. People often talk about his war films a lot more than his train film… sad! Especially when this movie has so many special things about it\n\nSo this is often considered the official first French Impressionist film, and as I said previously, the Impressionists were all trying different things even if their objectives were often similar. In La Roue, there’s so many instances of montage and optical effects to reinforce feelings and ideas, in ways that were not done until then. This was so revolutionary that even the Soviets looked at this film in order to study and develop their notions of montage. Not only that but it originally had a whopping 9 hour long runtime, and even though it was edited down to 90 minutes for the original theater releases, it was later re-released in 4 hour versions and recently a 7 hour print. This extreme length allows for so many of the themes and details of the dramas to be reinforced to a hypnotic level, where in the end you see so many of the repeated ideas that you’ve familiarized yourself with the internal language of the film. And when it all ends you genuinely feel like you’ve wandered into a different life and found yourself waking up from a vivid dream.\n\nThis is also a picture that represents change in so many different layers in transcendental ways. I might one day go through all the different ways this film explores this theme, but not now. Check it out if you want some super long train movies (they surely don’t make 7 hour long train movies as they used to)\n\n6 – Die Nibelungen (1924, dir. Fritz Lang)\n\nCalling a Fritz Lang film “underseen” might be a crime in some cinephile circles, but to be quite honest this is definitely one of his lesser known works, especially when compared to classics such as Metropolis and M. Even though it’s definitely one of the more popular films in this list, I personally think it deserves even more recognition than it already has.\n\nBased on the German epic poem “Nibelungenlied”, this film duology is arguably Lang’s first venture into large epic scope productions (keep in mind up until this point his most ambitious film was Mabuse, the Gambler), and already he demonstrates such an understanding of how to translate the epic style into film. This is a very unique movie that moves and looks like nothing else at its time, and arguably to this day. The first part captures the classic hero fantasy of Siegfried with the amount of weight and force necessary to convey such a mythological being, and in the second part, Kriemhild’s Revenge, a dark and twisted war epic unfolds into shattering destruction and all is carried by the eternal look of actress Margarete Schön as she leads her army into death.\n\nThis is Expressionism at its most gothic; if you like how stark and picturesque Lang can be, please check this duology out. While you can argue that it doesn’t deserve the 4 hour duration, in my opinion this is just how Lang (and screenwriter Thea von Harbou) envisioned a film adaptation of an epic poem. It’s long, it’s heavy, it’s self-reverent, it represents mythology in an exploration of the power of images like so few filmmakers managed to do. Also, arguments can be made for this being a fascist film – I’m not gonna enter this argument, I know the Nazis loved this movie, but honestly there’s not much in the text that I think warrants this descriptor and it’s more a case of how fascists at the time received the picture. Basically how “literally me” bros view stuff like American Psycho nowadays\n\nGreat Gothic GEC. Check it out!\n\n7 – The Iron Horse (1924, dir. John Ford)\n\nIt weirds me out that this one is so underseen, I mean you can’t get more canonical than John Ford and yet lots of people have yet to peep his silent epic western The Iron Horse, and they should change that! This film rocks\n\nIf you enjoy that classic western style and if you’re autistic about trains do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I would argue that this is the real start of Ford’s canonical filmography, and not his other western epic Stagecoach, I mean you already have the strong character dynamics, the relentless pacing, the breathtaking set pieces, plus this one has trains! Did I mention it has trains?\n\nI don’t think I need to wax poetic about John Ford’s style or importance, so I’ll save you the banter, I’m just here trying to convince folks that silent-era Ford was still interesting sometimes.\n\n8 – Variety (1925, dir. E. A. Dupont)\n\nPart of the film series that I like to call “Emil Jannings needs a hug”, this is one film that falls less on the GEC side and more on the New Objectivity side… I’ll explain. So during the middle of the 1920s, there was this art movement in Germany called New Objectivity, which proposed a denial of the fantastical and subjectivist mentality of the avant-garde tendencies of the time such as Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, and instead proposed a return to the Realism so common in the previous century. This movement manifested itself in many fields, including in German cinema, and it would eventually become the leading tendency among the aesthetics of late 1920s and early 1930s German film. Two early examples of this movement are G.W. Pabst’s Joyless Street, and this film.\n\nIt’s an interesting story. From the get-go we start in prison with the main character finally confessing his acts, and with that premise we go back in time to see what happened to Emil Jannings that led him to that point. The rest of the film is about the story of this man’s relationship with his lover, and his lover’s lover, and they all work in a variety act in a circus.\n\nThe style is pictorialist, but differs from GEC in a few ways. Instead of spiritual, fantastical, or obscure subject matters, Variety is a story of the common crime, the drama between lovers and the boiling tension between horny German men. There’s still a subjectivity to the form (we see many sequences that represent Jannings’ point of view in a more Expressionistic way) but within New Objectivity this aspect would be abandoned later on.\n\nNew Objectivity’s major player was G.W. Pabst, whose films were shot and edited in a very direct manner, without tricks or effects, and this paved the way for the late 1920s style of Streetfilms and Chamber Dramas, most of which followed a sense of realism (and grittiness) that was explored to different results, and it’s interesting to analyze this other German film movement in detail to see what they achieved and how this related to the rising tensions of German politics of late 1920s and early 1930s. I’ll come back to New Objectivity on this list but rest assured I’ll be writing more about this topic in a future post\n\n9 – By The Law (1926, dir. Lev Kuleshov)\n\nYou probably heard of the Kuleshov effect, right? This often namedropped montage concept is named after a soviet film theorist and filmmaker named Lev Kuleshov, who aside from his contributions to Montage Theory, also made dozens of films in the USSR. Here’s one that I think is worth the watch\n\nBy The Law is not the type of movie you’d expect to see in 1920s Soviet Cinema (but then again this applies to many films in the country, Soviet Cinema is a lot more diverse than you’d think!), with its less propagandistic tone and a more psychologically led character study in this chamber drama that predates so many similar films of this sort (think The Shining, Knock at the Cabin, etc). A premise simple yet intense: a couple and a murderer are stuck in a cabin during a winter storm, the couple must decide whether to kill the murderer or to wait until the storm is over to turn him in to the authorities. The rest of the movie is about the ever growing tension between the three accentuated by the increasingly terrible weather conditions that envelop them in that small shack.\n\nSo many interesting filmmaking techniques are applied, but this is also an amazing portrayal of Soviet acting on screen, with the performance of actress Alexandra Khlokhlova being the highlight. I think it’s worth watching this picture not only for how impressive it is, but also to illustrate the variety of films that the USSR produced in the 1920s, ranging from documentaries to comedies, to action adventures, to psychological chamber dramas, to cartoons… so much stuff! And Kuleshov was spearheading it all, bless this man\n\n10 – The Cat and the Canary (1927, dir. Paul Leni)\n\nFolks usually like to explain the influence of GEC on genres like film noir, but in truth the movement was influencing Hollywood a lot earlier than that, with the first instances of this being the Universal horror films starting as early as the late 1920s. GEC also influenced Hollywood in a very specific way during this same period when F.W. Murnau made Sunrise (1927) and Fox commissioned several filmmakers to make films that looked similar to it (eg Ford’s Four Sons, Borzage’s Street Angel etc), but we’ll talk about that some other time. Back to Universal horror!\n\nThe Cat and the Canary is one of the earliest examples of a Universal Horror film, or at least one of the oldest surviving examples alongside The Phantom of the Opera (1925). During this time, Hollywood was in the process of importing German filmmakers to work for them in the US, and Paul Leni was one of the early hires. Leni made some GEC classics such as Backstairs (1921) a sort of prototype to Murnau’s The Last Laugh, and Waxworks (1924), a more fantasy oriented GEC adventure. In the US he’d be responsible for staying at the forefront of Universal Picture’s foray into horror films, and in the process he informed many of the aesthetic and formal principles of this genre for decades to come.\n\nWell, in truth not only was he influential but I’d argue he did things that no one filmmaker could do inside the Universal Horror trappings. Since this is a silent film – and most of the Universal Horror pictures are talkies – it has the added advantage of being free of all the restrictions associated with early sound technology (think of how slow and quiet Dracula and Frankenstein are). Thus, The Cat and the Canary is probably the most visually dynamic Universal Horror film you’ll ever see\n\nThis movie has such a high amount of tricks, effects, camera movements, montage, all on top of the very Expressionistic art direction you’d expect from German films. It’s almost like Leni was challenging himself to make every shot as visually interesting as possible. You could argue this hinders the general build of atmosphere in what’s supposed to be a horror film, but I’d argue The Cat and the Canary is pretty honest with the fact that horror films can be pretty fun at times and embraces the entertainment value of spooky looking things moving in spooky ways.\n\n11 – The Telltale Heart (1928, dir. Leon Shamroy, Charles Klein)\n\nSpeaking of GEC influence on American Cinema, here’s another example of the phenomenon but on the more independent side\n\nConsidered to be the first adaptation of Poe’s classic, this short film is a collaboration between famous Fox cinematographer Leon Shamroy and playwright Charles Klein. In it, they apply an expressionistic style of art direction and mise-en-scene very much akin to The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and Crime and Punishment (both by Robert Wiene). Since this was made in the latter end of the decade instead of the early years like the German counterparts, many more advanced photography tricks and movements are applied to this formula, which makes this stand out from the GEC classics by having lots of montage and exposure tricks. It’s a fascinating re-interpretation of the style.\n\nOther smaller films were being made in the US at this same time that were also influenced by GEC, like The Fall of the House of Usher, and The Life and Death of 9413, a Hollywood Extra, and those are also very much worth the watch, but since I already have a limited amount of recs I chose this one out of the 3. But take this as a 3-in-1 recommendation while you’re at it!\n\n12 – Shooting Stars (1928, dir. Anthony Asquith, A.V. Bramble)\n\nWhen it comes to classic British filmmakers, the number one name that comes to mind for most people is Alfred Hitchcock, and it’s with good reason, since he directed many classics and masterpieces that are still relevant and beloved to this day. His work in Hollywood is obviously what most cinephiles discuss, but even when talking about his British films, they’ll more often than not talk about his 1930s output like The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, or Sabotage. The only silent film that anyone even mentions among Hitchcock’s filmography is The Lodger. I believe one of the reasons why this is the case is because Alfred’s style and genius only properly developed as the years went on and he refined his filmmaking process, so it’s one of those cases in which the films get better as time goes on. But let’s talk about another British filmmaker that arguably went the opposite way\n\nAnthony Asquith might not be as famous outside the UK as Hitchcock, but at least as far as the 1920s go, he’s way superior, in my imo. While the most interesting film made by Hcock in the silent era was The Lodger (which in my opinion is not even that great), Asquith made 3 excellent silents almost back to back between 1928 and 1929. It’s pretty impressive, honestly. Here, I’ll limit myself to talk about his first (and best) film, Shooting Stars (1928)\n\nObviously inspired by F.W. Murnau and King Vidor, Shooting Stars is a movie about movies, whose setting is a studio and its characters are actors. From the very beginning the line between reality and fiction is played with, when the protagonist is shot from an angle that resembles a romantic scene and as the camera pulls back it’s revealed she’s merely acting in a studio and as soon as the (diegetic) camera stops rolling she starts complaining and yelling with her co-workers. This is the tone of the rest of the film, a conflation between what is done by the characters as people and as actors. In this meta-textual narrative, the drama is also crossing the lines between action and representation, as the main lady is married to her co-star, and in the meantime is having an affair with a comedy actor who’s making another movie in the same studio lot. Her life is torn between men as it’s torn between movies, genres, sets, and crews.\n\nAnd I didn’t even mention how amazing the photography here is. With some sweeping dolly shots that fly above the studio sets and some powerful use of lighting and art direction, this is a gorgeous film that any cinephile interested in silent era filmmaking should absolutely check out.\n\nThe reason I said Asquith went the opposite way from Hitchcock is because I believe his silent era output is a lot more interesting than anything he made after that (at least from what I’ve seen). All of his silent films are great and worth checking out, while his sound filmography is pretty uneven. So if you want an example of what the UK could achieve in the silent era, don’t limit yourself to The Lodger, do check out Shooting Stars, or any of the other Asquith silents (Underground, A Cottage on Dartmoor, hell, even The Runaway Princess)!\n\n13 – Speedy (1928, dir. Ted Wilde)\n\nHarold Lloyd is sometimes perceived as the lesser of the classic slapstick comedians of the silent era. And while I’m not gonna argue against that notion, I do think that among normie film discussions he ends up being tragically underrated and forgotten, while Chaplin and Keaton take the leading roles in the discourse. Here’s a film from the Lloyd man that people should peep!\n\nWhile the film is somewhat of a mishmash of several different seemingly disconnected sequences, I sort of think it’s what makes it funny. At one point the characters are going through shenanigans in Coney Island, then at another point Harold Lloyd is suddenly driving Babe Ruth to his own game in a cab, then it’s suddenly a movie about Civil War veterans fighting to protect a horse-drawn tram business in Manhattan… it’s pretty all over the place, but it’s great\n\nHarold Lloyd has this very cartoonish existence that surrounds him which works in pretty unique ways. While I don’t think his films are as genius as the ones by Chaplin and Keaton, there’s still several sequences that I love and that you should definitely give a looksee!\n\n14 – Accident (1928, dir. Ernö Metzner)\n\nThis is considered one of the more experimental streetfilms made at this time. By 1928 the genre was already starting to become passé and filmmakers were mostly trying to subvert the soon-to-be tired tropes. This film is an early example, but other examples are G.W. Pabst’s Pandora’s Box (1929), Joe May’s Assault (1929), Bruno Rahn’s Tragedy of the Street (1927), and even Fritz Lang’s M (1931). All those films have a subversive character to elements associated with Streetfilms, but let’s talk about this one specifically\n\nMetzner’s short film is very direct with its plot, as it’s about a man who finds a coin in the streets of Weimar Germany. He then uses that money to gamble and to engage in all sorts of debauchery before meeting his unfortunate fate. Not gonna spoil anything, but that’s the gist of it. The reason why this can be considered a subversion of this story is because of how unfamiliar it attempts to make every element while never exactly denying the form of a Streetfilm. With several uses of tricks and montage sequences, the film is more of a bad trip than a grimey realistic tale of a street tragedy, which was sort of the modus operandi of the genre.\n\nOf course it’s not the most experimental film ever or even the best subversion of Streetfilms, but I still think it’s worth watching, especially because it’s short and sweet. Check it out when you can!\n\n15 – The New Babylon (1929, dir. Grigori Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg)\n\nSimilarly to Kuleshov’s film mentioned earlier in this list, here’s another very experimental and delightful Soviet gem. A movie that 100% needs to get more attention, and I have absolutely no idea why it doesn’t.\n\nThe directors of this film have worked together several times, but also each made some solo films that are worth noting (e.g. Kozintsev’s Hamlet adaptations or his Don Quixote film). Their style is less documentary (like Vertov) but more like epic scope dramatizations (like Eisenstein). In fact if you like the specific way in which Eisenstein translated history into grand stories, definitely check this film out.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that Soviet films were, more often than not, period pieces seen through Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism. In a similar way that Classical Hollywood had several films about the Old West and the Civil War as means of understanding and narrating the ideals associated with American Exceptionalism or The American Way of Life, the Soviets saw the history that led to them as a series of lessons that people could learn from and to understand what led to the way in which the world functioned at that time. In particular, period pieces were often made to illustrate what were the class struggles and the movements that changed history that led to the existence of the USSR. That’s why so many films were made about WW1 and the late Tsarist period. But here we go back even more and look at what could possibly be seen as the foundational myth of communist history.\n\nThe Commune of Paris is considered to be the first attempt at establishing a communist society. After the Franco-Prussian War the city of Paris was under siege by the Prussians, and the National Guard was the one defending the city for the most part. Among the Guard, socialist ideals began to spread as the war went on and their isolation from the rest of the French Government led to the rise of a revolutionary sentiment within the workers. When the Third Republic was established after the war, the workers of the National Guard were so well organized that they managed to fight back the imposition of the government and seized power of Paris for 2 months before being suppressed by the bourgeois funded French Army.\n\nI might have butchered several facts in this little history lesson, but I thought it might have been important to explain this because the film kinda expects that you know about the basic outline. The truth is that The Paris Commune was deeply influential in Marxist thought, as it happened while Marx was alive and he and Engels studied the event to better develop their theory, and later on the Bolsheviks did the same to better develop their own revolutionary plans. For the people of Soviet Russia, the Paris Commune represents the first spark of a communist fire and a cathartic tragedy for the emancipation of the working class.\n\nSo when Trauberg and Kozintsev decided to make a film about this event, you know they had to make it as spectacular as possible. And so they did. Of course when I say “spectacular” I don’t mean in the sense of old Hollywood studio productions, but I mean in a new way that represented the revolution in form just as it did in text. Two interesting ways in which this was achieved was first by hiring composer Dmitri Shostakovich to make the soundtrack of the film, which he did by making a whole new composition for the film, and second by hiring the actors of the FEKS (Factory of the Eccentric Actor) group, which was an associated of avant-garde players that were involved in a working-class art movement called Eccentrism which valued the way of acting of everyday individuals and the chaotic movement of the big city. So this isn’t your everyday crew\n\nI believe the result of all this can only be felt when you watch it, but honestly this is such a magnificent work. If you like the close-ups in Eisenstein or Dreyer, definitely check this film out, it has such a masterful use of this type of shot. And it’s a story about characters, their reactions, their actions, the conflict between all these sorts of individuals in this mid-century European milieu, all bubbling and exploding into a triumph as the revolution occurs. It’s lovely, and it’s absolutely worth checking out if you’re into communist history and grandiose films.\n\n16 – In Spring (1929, dir. Mikhail Kaufman)\n\nHave you ever heard of this underground movie called uhhh… Man With a Movie Camera? It’s pretty rare, no one has seen it, so it’s okay if you don’t know about it. Well, Vertov might have made the definitive City Symphony classic but that doesn’t mean the one made by his little brother Mikhail isn’t worth checking out, especially since I think it does some cool things on its own that MWaMC doesn’t!\n\nBut wait a second, what the h*ck is a City Symphony?? Ok so basically at the latter half of the 1920s, a genre of films suddenly emerged in cinemas all over the world, all inspired by Walter Ruttmann’s Berlin: Symphony of a Great City. Ruttmann’s film was innovative at that time because it added an unprecedented aesthetic formalism to documentaries that in itself could also be repurposed as a formula all over the world.\n\nBerlin is a film with no main characters and no story, well at least in the conventional narrative way. It’s a documentary that shows the movements of people, vehicles, machines, and general things as a regular day goes by in the city of Berlin. Ruttmann (who was one of the pioneers of abstract cinema) applied a very rhythmic and fast-paced montage to the footage, owning up to the title of “Symphony of a Great City”. The result is the film that spawned a whole genre of similar pictures made by people all over the world (but mostly Europe) and was arguably the largest documentary genre of the silent era. Once sound films came along the genre sort of died off, but it ultimately inspired lots of modern filmmakers to make similar kind of works (one could argue films like Koyaanisqatsi and My Winnipeg are modern City Symphonies)\n\nMan With a Movie Camera by Dziga Vertov is often described as a City Symphony, and it might even be the best one (definitely one of the most interesting ones at least), but it’s true that it’s also a study of Soviet workers’ everyday life as individuals of the USSR. One thing that film critics often distinguish between Ruttmann’s film and Vertov’s is that in the former there’s a detached attitude towards the workers of the city, in which the German filmmaker only really cares about the movement of the things surrounding/being operated by them (trains, cars, gates, bridges, wheels, etc), whereas in the latter a large amount of attention is given to the people operating the things (the drivers, technicians, salesmen, traffic guards, etc), going as far as to show the operation of filmmaking itself as part of the process of the great machine of modern soviet industry. Thus it’s a documentary that not only fits the City Symphony mold (Vertov focused only on Kiev and Moscow as the setting) but explores the great scope a modernizing society in the process of developing new sociabilities beyond Capitalist liberalism and a film industry uncovering new artistic horizons beyond classical Capitalist (Hollywood) modes. It’s a masterpiece, nuff said.\n\nBut how many people know about the extended Kaufman universe? Dziga Vertov is the pseudonym of Denis Kaufman, whose brothers Mikhail and Boris Kaufman both also had their own contributions to cinema. Those of you into cinematography might know Boris’ work as the DP for many films like 12 Angry Men, On The Waterfront, and notably the films of Jean Vigo, one of which was also a City Symphony (À Propos de Nice)! Here’s my joint recommendation: watch Jean Vigo’s films!\n\nBut anyways, aside from the two aforementioned Kaufman bros, the other one is the director of this film (God, this time I took a while to finally talk about the film huh). In Spring was made at sort of the same time as MWaMC, and it had a very similar mission statement, but I want to recommend it for the fact that it also managed to achieve different results in the process which makes it worth checking out even if only to compare and contrast. Whereas Vertov’s film is mostly limited to narrating the cycle of a single day in a Soviet city, Mikhail’s picture is broader in scope and focuses on the cycle of a whole year, and is not entirely limited to the city, but also shows life in the camps and in the industrial parks. In essence, the film shows how labor related to man’s existence within nature and how this relationship is shaped through the change of seasons and the development of a socialist nation. You might argue that if MWaMC is a movie about a developing socialist culture, In Spring is a movie about a developing socialist environment (in the broadest and most specific sense of the word). For these differences I think the film is definitely worth the watch. You just can’t go wrong with the Kaufman bros.\n\n17 – The Pearl (1929, dir. Henri d’Ursel)\n\nLast time we talked about French Impressionist Cinema was all the way back at La Roue (1923); remember when you were reading the first entries on this list? Feels like yesterday…\n\nThis film isn’t exactly French (it’s from Belgium) but it’s adjacent enough to FIC that I can talk a bit about what happened since Gance’s train movie. People like to divide FIC in three periods: the first being the late 1910s to early 1920s when most of the films in the movement were mostly about camera tricks and elaborate art direction (J’accuse, Fièvre, The Man of the Sea), the second period begins with La Roue and is more about complex montage and camerawork (Coeur Fidele, L’inhumaine, Ménilmontant, Napoleon), and finally the last period is this sort of dispersion period in which each director went off to a different direction and decided to do something a bit different. Abel Gance dabbled with sci-fi in La Fin du Monde (1931), Jean Epstein experimented with horror in The Fall of the House of Usher (1928) and later in documentaries like Finis Terrae, Germaine Dulac pivoted to a form of surrealism, etc\n\nAnd it seems that this late period of FIC was very much a transitionary moment in which this movement was dying off and simultaneously paving the way for other movements like Poetic Realism and, in this case, Surrealism. We all know of the surrealist films of Man Ray, Salvador Dali, and Luis Buñuel, but here’s something that some of you might not know.\n\nI haven’t done the proper research on this and would love to learn more from y’all if any of you know this, but it seems that during this same time in Belgium there was a small but notable scene of Surrealist filmmakers also making their own weird little movies. La Perle (The Pearl) is one of these, and the best one that I’ve seen from this time.\n\nDirected by a rich guy who didn’t need to worry about making a profitable film, this movie is pretty loose on its narrative. In fact you might not even understand what is happening the first time you watch it, but what you will see is a sequence of images that harmonize really well to create a movie in which its style is its substance, and the images will mesmerize you. There’s so many interesting shots and scenes here, and by the end you do feel like you went through some sort of adventure, even if it’s a pretty unusual one. If you’re looking for some lesser known surrealist works from the 1920s, this one is a must watch.\n\n18 – A Throw of Dice (1929, dir. Franz Osten)\n\nIn case you felt this list was a bit too white and European, I have something special here for you. How about a silent epic Indian war-gambling film?\n\nIndian cinema is one of the largest in the world, and, with the recent success of RRR, many cinephiles are turning their eyes to the subcontinent for other high quality pictures. In case you were wondering if there were any good silent Indian films, I can point you to A Throw of Dice (Pranpacha Pash) for starters. Although of course considering India was, at this time, occupied by the British, this is more of a co-production between India, the UK, and Germany, which might not make it count as a purely Indian film, but it definitely makes it looking at its form and style a lot interesting\n\nThe director was a German man called Franz Osten, who lived and worked in India for many years and was responsible for the production of what are now considered many silent Indian classics. He was definitely inspired by the German films of the Weimar republic, and it shows. Films like the epics produced by Fritz Lang and Ernst Lubitsch (not his sex comedies, the epic costume dramas), or even the Joe May serials set in India. All that those filmmakers had in common was a fascination for the exotic, and Osten, unlike his German peers, had the opportunity to shoot on the actual “Orient” that the Europeans so dreamed of. This lent the film to, obviously, be pretty orientalist and capitalizing on how exotic it all looked to white Europeans. There’s no denying it, I’m just getting that out of the way before anything. Also keep in mind Osten would later join the Nazi party, yeah… not the best stuff. But anyways\n\nI still think this movie is worth watching, because it is in itself a unique spectacle. Osten shot with actual Indian actors and used actual historical places as sets (unlike the folks in Europe doing brownface and shooting in studios), it feels a lot more genuine than anything Joe May or Lang tried to do with the similar ideas. Aside from that, it’s an adaptation from a classic story of the Mahabharata, and in case you’re interested in South Asian mythology, you gotta check this out.\n\nIt’s not only a war movie, but also a romance (of course), and most surprisingly a gambling film. Characters make political and strategic decisions based on rolls of dice (hence the title) and it adds an element to the drama that you often don’t see in the Western canon, unless it’s in some sort of ironic twist of the usual war tale. No, here it is played straight and it’s a pretty unique twist.\n\nAnd of course I didn’t even mention the beautiful art direction. So much of this film is just these long tracking shots (reminiscent of Cabiria, in fact. Shoutouts to “10 films from the 1910s…”) that show you the large and lavish palaces and halls that these legendary figures occupy. Obviously this is part of the exoticism, but it still resulted in undeniably beautiful images.\n\nIf you want a silent Indian film, a non-European war epic, or even an interesting gambling story, do check this out!\n\n19 – Man-Slashing Horse-Piercing Sword (1929, dir. Daisuke Ito)\n\nRemember when in the 1910s list I recommended a partially lost film whose surviving print looks like dogshit? Wild moment, possibly a highlight of the whole thing. Well, I couldn’t end this list without recommending another partially lost film, and good news, now the surviving print at least looks decent!\n\nMan-Slashing Horse-Piercing Sword, also called The Sword of Enchantment, or Sword Against Authority, or even Master Sword of Man and Beast (!) is a silent Japanese film made by leftist filmmaker and genre revolutionary Daisuke Ito. Much is talked about how Akira Kurosawa defined the genre of samurai films, but in truth the real pioneers were guys like Ito, who actually created the language of what we now know as a samurai film. There’s so much history here, and I’ll try to be brief, but trust me I’m gonna come back to this in a future blog post\n\nPeriod films (also called jidaigeki) are to Japanese cinema what the Western is to Hollywood, this isn’t a bold statement, most film critics and historians agree with this. The comparison is true not only because both genres deal with an idealized past that had commercial and aesthetic appeal to their respective nations, but also because both genres changed as cinema (and society) changed alongside them. The first Japanese films were more often than not period films, in fact the ratio of period film (jidaigeki) to modern day setting film (gendaigeki) was like 8 to 1. Of course samurai tales were often the focus of these films, but originally they were very different from what we now understand as samurai films\n\nEarly jidaigeki was informed a lot by traditional Japanese theater, and the acting was reminiscent of Kabuki, with actors moving in slow and sweeping manners, and action feeling overly theatrical. Samurai films followed this formula and often felt like stagey operas than anything else. It was during the process of rapid modernization of Japan in the 1920s that this would come to change. Inspired by leftist cinema of the time, Japanese filmmakers started to reinvent the jidaigeki genre to change not only on a formal level but also on an ideological one.\n\nSamurai represent not only a historical profession associated with medieval Japan, but also the entire philosophy ubiquitous of that time, the Bushido. To a modern Japanese person he can represent either the platonic ideal of the Japanese man, a fierce and unrelenting warrior who follows the orders of his superior not because he wants something in return but because it’s the right thing to do; or he can represent the epitome of the exploited proletariat of feudal Japan, who murders and commits inhuman violence just to protect the property of aristocrats who don’t even pay him enough to live a wealthy life, often being exploited to death or misery. This historiographic plurality led to several different readings of the samurai figure, and in the late 1920s a movement of left-leaning revaluations of the samurai film started to surge\n\nDaisuke Ito was spearheading this movement, by making some of the first left-leaning samurai films. In his films, samurais were often criminals or anarchists, figures that actively opposed the socio-political configurations of feudal Japan, and often led revolutionary movements among the peasants in order to fight against the lords, instead of blindly following their orders. MAN-SLASHING HORSE-PIERCING SWORD (sorry I just fucking love this title) is an ideal example of this. In the film, the protagonist, Raizaburo, is a rogue samurai who discovers a conspiracy by a magistrate who plans to kill the heir to the land in order to claim his ownership of that territory. As Raizaburo organizes a plan of his own to stop the evil doings of the corrupt magistrate, he ends up riling up the exploited farmers to support his mission and revolt against their lord. In between this drama, many incredible fight scenes occur\n\nI didn’t mention this, but this period was also revolutionary to samurai films because a change from stagey operatic action scenes to gritty realistic ones happened, and that was the birth of the “chambara” genre, which got its name from the sound of clashing swords associated with the rawer actions scenes. This film features some amazing fight choreography that predates the Kurosawa sequences by a good 30 years. The golden age of chambara was not the 1950s or 1960s, it was the 1920s!\n\nBut of course this film was lost for many years, and a fragment was discovered recently, so you can’t really watch this in full, but the part that remains is still definitely worth watching. I’m gonna come back to this topic in the future, but for now, this is all I’ll say on the matter. On to the final movie!\n\n20 – My Grandmother (1929, dir. Kote Mikaberidze)\n\nHow about ending this on a good note. Here’s a soviet comedy film, did you know those exist? Yeah actually the soviets made a ton of comedies, and they’re really good! This one is also like one of the most wild films to come out at this time, honestly\n\nMy Grandmother is a dark satire of bureaucratic life under capitalism, the characters are this cartoonish farcical personification of lazy obtuseness and the art direction is this expressionistic representation of dystopian excessive brutalism, all to add up to pure shenanigans that make you feel like you’re in a bad trip of some esoteric sort. And this is before the story even begins, as it does, things really just go off\n\nA bureaucrat loses his job at an office, and his life instantly loses meaning, he finds himself with no means of raising his jazz-loving feet-swinging wife and kids, and even tries to khs (korean high school) but the attempt fails and he finds himself forced to face the fact that he needs to look for another job. How, oh how does a man like this lazy pen-pusher get a job in this economy? The solution will surprise you! The outcome of that solution might surprise you even more! Do not miss the chance to get some good laughs, some goofs, even some gags, in this Georgian surrealist fever dream MY GRANDMOTHER. Great way to end this list, dontcha think?\n\nWell, here we are. This was the post that I’ve been looking forward to making for a pretty long time, luckily the stars aligned and I finally got to write it. Did you enjoy it? Will you watch any of these (I mean actually watching not just adding them to your watchlist)? Let me know what you thought of them if you do! I hope I was able to recommend something you never heard of before and are now looking forward to learning more about. There are plenty of rabbit holes to go down from this list, and I myself went through many of them and had a great time. Hopefully you do too\n\nThere’s no guarantee that I’ll make a sequel to this list with the 1930s and beyond, but I’m not entirely opposed to the idea, we’ll see. But what I can guarantee is that some of the topics mentioned here will return more in depth in a future, more well-researched, blog post. It’s something that I’ve been working on and off for over a year at this point, and I promise it will be at least somewhat interesting (it’s definitely interesting to me!), so please look forward to this future “secret” research project of mine. Can’t give a release date, but I promise it will come out sooner than later. For now, I hope this list suffices. Thank you for reading it all, and I hope you have fun!"
