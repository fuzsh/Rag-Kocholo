        "text": "Prior to the 1920s people were already not given equal prosperity. This can be seen in 1882 by the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first significant law restricting immigration into the United States. However, the ban was only against the immigration of Chinese laborers. Furthermore, Andrew Carnegie owner from the steel industry from 1973-1901 controlled the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by in the United States. Although Carnegie gained millions, he paid his workers little. Therefore, the 1920s did not give prosperity to everyone including those who were immigrants, the new technological advancements, and the economic difference in social classes.\n\nAmerica has always been searching for new types of entertainment. In the early twenty-first century, cutting-edge technology and pastimes were introduced. Nightlife was increased due to flappers and jazz music, and the invention of the radio provided amusement and paved the way for more technology. Entertainment provided a way to relieve stress in the Roaring Twenties. Even sports offered a time of leisure for the busiest individuals.\n\nCompare and contrast the American musical theatre in the 1920s with that of the 1930s. How did each reflect and absorb its era? What forms & styles were dominant, what was the same, what was different and why? Do we see elements from these decades in shows today? Use examples from specific musicals.\n\nThe roaring 20’s was an astounding time in the history of the United States of America. Many authors published novels, poems, and other works of literature to show their readers what it would be like to experience this time frame. Some examples of these works include The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and “Harlem” by Langston Hughes. Both of these pieces of literature include literary elements to appeal to the reader’s senses and imagination. A prevalent theme that has been found in works of the roaring 20’s is the wealth that someone may or may not achieve. Literary elements such as figurative language, irony, and symbolism are profound in both The Great Gatsby and “Harlem”, adding depth to both literature works.\n\nNewspapers had once been the only mass communication & entertainment. The demand for new products that emerged in the 1920s created a new industry, advertising, which enticed buyers to purchase new products, and now that the radio had emerged, advertising was integrated into this media outlet . Radio shows like Amos n' Andy, became a nationwide hit. The advertising industry grew with the emerging industries of mass culture, especially radio and cinema. For the first time, from coast to coast, Americans experienced the same shows and used the same advertised products due to mass culture. The first commercial radio station aired in 1920 and broadcast music to a few thousand listeners. By the end of the decade, thirty-three\n\nAugust Wilson discussed the struggles African Americans went through as slaves, how they have to stay strong to survive and how the history relates to today’s society and in theatre. He discussed on the grounds he stand meaning of what he respect in the growing life of theatre. The infamous ancient Greek dramatists who are Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus. William Shakespeare, Shaw and Ibsen, the Americans dramatists were Eugene O’Neill, Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams. Another group of individuals who pave the way were the black theatre writers such as Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey, Marcus Garvey and Elijah Muhammad. He discussed that the “black theatre” was growing into two different black arts that was developed in the past and that it is still considered the same in today’s society such as theatre that entertain white society and art that uplift the black culture in strategies that deliver survival and prosperity. Black theatre is the best theatre; Wilson considered it vibrant and vital. Wilson wants black theatre to be funded and recognized. “Black theatre doesn’t share in the economic that would allow it to support its\n\nThe 1920’s should be considered a time of prosperity in American history. America was introduced to new a modern identity. There was many cultural norms in the 1920’s. The decade also saw an economic boom, through new modern industries and the automotive age. The government went back to a hands off, “Laissez-Faire”, government. The government and politics were going for the return to normalcy type of outlook.\n\nWhen you think of the words “famous playwright,” who is the first one to come to mind? Most people would say William Shakespeare. Shakespeare is one of the most recognized playwrights of all time, with many of his works being archetypes for many stories told today. An example of this would be Twelfth Night, a comedy about a woman who disguises herself as a man to fit in and finds herself in the middle of riotous hijinks and disorder. However, Twelfth Night is set in a time period that is found to be uninteresting to some. That is when someone bold steps up and offers an adaptation in the 21st century. This person was Andy Fickman, who helmed the 2006 film She’s the Man, a modern-day retelling of Shakespeare’s classic comedy. As with any adaptation,\n\nAccording to Boundless.Com some of the main literary figures of the 1920s , examples such as Fitzgerald and Hemingway , wrote novel and short stories judging the selfish and materialism individualism of that age. One of the famous books F.Scott Fitzgerald was “The Great Gatsby” and other books such as “The Side of Paradise” many more. In the 20’s literature reflected realistic characters and themes and many focus and influenced by the Great war and concentrated on the negative effects of modernism.\n\nOver the course of approximately one-hundred years there has been a discernible metamorphosis within the realm of African-American cinema. African-Americans have overcome the heavy weight of oppression in forms such as of politics, citizenship and most importantly equal human rights. One of the most evident forms that were withheld from African-Americans came in the structure of the performing arts; specifically film. The common population did not allow blacks to drink from the same water fountain let alone share the same television waves or stage. But over time the strength of the expectant black actors and actresses overwhelmed the majority force to stop blacks from appearing on film. For the longest time the performing arts were\n\nA life of fame, luxury, and well known plays. This was unquestionably the life of Arthur Miller, who is one of America’s well known playwrights of the twentieth century. His impact on American theater is still recognized today and will continue to be looked at for years to come. However, Miller will not only be recognized by his plays but by his high profile marriage, his work in politics and the list goes on. Arthur miller is viewed through American literature by his life, literary works, and impact on American theater.\n\nHe himself paid a lot of attention to such a matter. In his essay entitled “Some Thoughts on Playwriting” (1941), Wilder argued that there are four principles which make drama very distinctive and different from the other arts. The most relevant of these principles of the dramatic genre is that “It is addressed to the group-mind;” 3 which means that drama orientates its message a very broad audience. Stresau affirms that it is not possible to exclude the fact that Thornton Wilder paid a lot of attention to the future in his work which “contains the man of twentieth century who, in the maelstrom of toppling orders, has frighteningly lost his orientation. Faced with the question of how to live, what is left for him but to trust … the promise that grows out of the unknowable?”\n\nIn our lives, we are surrounded by moments of tragedy that drives our will to keep moving forward. Our daily lifestyles are no different from the famous stories that playwrights have written throughout history. Playwrights are masters at combining theatre elements of tragedy, religion, violence, and numerous relative elements that the audience embrace faithfully. Today, Greek and Roman influence is the main topic since they have inspired the famous plays Desire under the Elms and The Glass Menagerie."
