        "text": "Religious Themes in Film - Blog Entries\n\n15/7/24\n\nThe film Unsing Hero’ tells the true story of Christian music promoter David Smallbone who runs into serious financial trouble in his native Australia in the early 1990’s and moves his musical family to Nashville in the hope of better things. I found it consistently engaging, and though the family’s religious faith is central to the story it avoids the excesses of preachiness and sentimentality. The occasional family conflicts are credible and from an artistic point of view it helps that the main character is not always likeable. That being said his loss of faith in himself as a good father is well portrayed, as is his belated insight. Daisy Betts as the mother, Helen, conveys a quiet confidence and faith.\n\nThe necessity of, and the challenges of, receiving charity in the bad times is explored really well, as is the importance of community support – one family the Smallbones meets in Nashville is particularly generous, but in an unfussy and subtle way.\n\nThe film is very much a Smallbone family venture (e.g. son Joel plays the father David), but it’s not overly self-promotional. That being I am minded to explore further the music of daughter Rebecca, who records as Rebecca St James.\n\nThe film is suitable for school use, though as always clips are more likely to be effective than the full film. In particular there are scenes of grace before meals and some scenes suitable for exploring the theme of prayer- the family has a board divided into two columns – things to be prayed for and prayers answered.\n\nThere are several clips and trailers on YouTube – this one features the song ‘You Make Everything Beautiful’ sung and written by Rebecca. https://youtu.be/d_zxRXL1UtI\n\n11/1/24\n\nMiracle Club is what might be called a ‘small film’ – no need to crank up the home cinema and it’s short by modern standards. It tells the modest story of four women who head off on a pilgrimage to Lourdes with various expectations. It’s set, believably, in 1960’s Dublin, but there are events from the 1920’s that cast a shadow, and the trip to Lourdes brings old secrets, enmities, broken relationships and more to the surface – problems in search of resolution and closure. At times it’s funny, at other times quite moving.\n\nEach of the women has a different reason to be there – some for cures, some for clarity. They range from devout to doubtful and sometimes it seems they are not sure themselves where they come on that spectrum. Maggie Smith, Kathy Bates, Agnes O’Casey and Laura Linney do well in the lead roles. I presume the high-profile duo were chosen for commercial as well as artistic reasons – I’m sure there are several Irish actresses who could have portrayed these feisty Dublin mothers. Laura Linney plans a returning American so that suits well! She plays the role with depth and dignity, even just in facial expressions.\n\nThe male characters are largely feckless husbands, products of their time who have to learn a few things while the women are away. Stephen Rea delivers a typically mannered performance as one of them. If the women struggle with their faith the men are downright cynical.\n\nReligion is treated fairly well, though sometimes it’s seen, by some characters at least, as superstition. The priest, Fr Dermot (Mark O’Halloran), is a gentle soul, doing his best for the parishioners, but doesn’t seem convinced by the factual basis of Lourdes. Yest there is a sense of awe at Lourdes, especially on first arrival. One plot strand concerns an unwanted pregnancy and there’s a problematic and soft attitude to abortion, while suicide is a background theme as well. There’s crude language occasionally (do they add this to bump up the age rating?), so all in all it’s not suitable for children, while school use I’d suggest, would be limited to carefully chosen clips – e.g. the first arrival in Lourdes, some reconciliation scenes (personal, not sacramental) and discussions of what the women want to get from the pilgrimage.\n\n17/8/23\n\nI’m not a great fan of sumptuous costume dramas – sometimes there is too much costume and not enough drama. I was inveigled, not entirely against my will, to watch several episodes of Downton Abbey (Netflix). I found it very contrived, predictable and cliched. And yet because some characters and plot lines were interesting, I gritted my remaining teeth and stuck with it. Downton Abbey (RTE One, Wednesday), the first of the spin-off movies, just felt like a double episode of the TV show. There were a few cinematic flourishes, but they didn’t push the boat out for the big screen. We got a few lavish set pieces (e.g. a parade for the King’s visit), but the touching human moments were few. There was a promising sub-plot about a princess in an unhappy marriage who resolves to make a go of it, but her husband was a cardboard cad and we got little insight. The poncey poshness and privilege is off-putting. I did however like the sharp one-liners given to Maggie Smith as Violet – she asks another character ‘Will you have enough cliches to get you through the visit?’\n\nI thought religion would have a more of a central role in the community surrounding Downton Abbey, but in the series the minister was dragged out only for weddings and funerals, and he didn’t make any appearance in the film. At one stage a character wants prayer for good weather for the King’s visit, and, when she gets it, concludes that ‘God is a monarchist!’ And of course, there was the obligatory gay subplot, handled less discreetly than in the TV show. The film outdid itself in Mills and Boon vibes in the great ball at the end, but for me it was all veneer hiding an empty shell.\n\nIn contrast, Just Mercy (RTE One, Friday) was a more intense, more humane film. It told the true story of a case of racism and injustice involving the death penalty in Alabama. It was by turns moving and disturbing as young lawyer Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) represented prisoners on death row, many of whom had poor legal representation at trial, and at least one of whom, Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), was innocent. One execution scene was particularly upsetting – the man was guilty this time but there were mitigating circumstances that were ignored. The young lawyer was distraught after it, describing it as ‘the most horrific thing’.\n\nReligion figured strongly in the background, as you’d expect in a black community in the Deep South. We got a lively church scene, bible reading, plenty of incidental gospel singing and prayer before the execution. But it wasn’t simplistic or preachy at least not in relation to religion. You could say it was rather preachy against the injustice and the death penalty, but I suppose preachiness is a little easier to take when you share the values being promoted. Maybe there can be inherent values without preachiness, but then too much neutrality can be passionless. Can you hunger and thirst for righteousness and still be detached? Perhaps it’s all about subtlety, especially when it comes to the arts, but then the emotional manipulation can sneak in unnoticed. As you can guess I haven’t got this figured out fully yet! This film was sentimental at times but was a worthy story full of heart.\n\n6/10/22\n\nA credibly conflicted clergyman featured in the film First Reformed, shown on TG 4 last Monday. it is unpredictable and well scripted to a point (by Paul Shrader). Ethan Hawk does a tremendous job as Rev Toller of the First Reformed – a quaint ‘tourist church’ affiliated to the more prosperous mega ministry nearby. He has developing health issues and is very troubled after a family tragedy. He finds it difficult to pray, but, though full of angst, he is good with the parishioners and in particular finds himself counselling a young married couple. The woman (Amanda Seyfried, never better) is pregnant and looking forward to being a mother, but the husband is overcome by climate doom and doesn’t want to bring a child into this world that, as he sees it, has a grim future. Drawing on his own tragic experience Rev Toller says to him: ‘the despair you feel about bringing a child into this world cannot equal the despair of taking a child from it’.\n\nLargely driven by set pieces where the reverend speaks to a variety of people, and by the reflections he writes in his journal, the film teases out so many important issues, like reason, discernment, pride, hope, despair, family, courage, prayer, relationships, desolation and much more. The atmosphere is frequently grim, emphasised by the dark lighting in many scenes and suitably conveying the Rev Toller’s state of mind. ‘It’s hard to struggle against torpor’, he says. His pastor boss, sympathetic to a degree but more worldly, says to him, with Gethsemane in mind, ‘You’re always in the garden, for you every hour is the darkest hour’.\n\nConcern with climate change, pollution and planetary destruction is central, but there are implied warnings against extremism. The only character I found stereotyped and predictable was the businessman who owns the local factory but who funds many church activities.\n\nFor most of the time I found this one the most engrossing films with religious themes I have ever seen, but I thought it went off the rails somewhat in the last quarter, and I wasn’t all happy with the ending.\n\nThe set piece conversations mentioned might be suitable for RE, but on the whole the film is too grim, downbeat and even a bit twisted for young people. There is an implicit admiration of service, but joy is in short supply.\n\nI love a drama series that’s unpredictable, steers clear of stereotypes and has a sharp script, a touch or more of humour and fluid acting. Inside Man on BBC One, which concluded last Monday and Tuesday fits the bill with delights to spare. Its black humour reminds me of Coen Brothers material, especially the Fargo film and series. David Tennant plays a highly conflicted vicar who lands himself in a compromising situation involving a USB drive that he casually agrees to mind for a troubled acquaintance. The random act of kindness propels him into a hellish spiral as he gets tied up in moral knots to rival a dodgy fishing line. This vicar has a foul mouth on him, but is this caused by stress? I’d love to know what kind of vicar he was before the crisis descends. In the throes of it he spins between sacrificial love and cynical manipulation – especially in a church confession scene that’s hard to watch. His son’s maths tutor Janice (the excellent Holly Wells) gets caught up in all of this in the most bizarre of ways.\n\nMeanwhile, and initially connected by just the thinnest of threads, a certain Mr Grieff (the hypnotic Stanley Tucci), a prisoner on death row in the USA who solves mysteries from his prison cell, is drawn into the mystery, along with his wisecracking and serial killer neighbour on the row. Credulity is stretched. The script is sprightly and razor sharp, philosophical, reflective and at times cynical. I loved the dig at ‘the recreationally outraged’ and Mr Grieff’s quip ‘self-loathing is clarity’ as well as his interest in deeds of ‘moral worth’.\n\nThe vicar’s faith could do with more exploring. He seems to believe to an extent, despite his misdeeds while his wife, under pressure, mocks his faith. There’s a cheap shot dig about priests and altar boys – that and some crudeness and bad language are unnecessary. Like so many films it does go off the rails somewhat as it nears conclusion and strains credibility to breaking point. The final musings on human nature are rather downbeat, suggesting that deep down we are all capable of murder. I didn’t find anything here for the RE classroom!\n\n24/6/22\n\nConflicts between Church and State can cause a lot of grief to both, but can also help to clarify principles. These themes were explored in the rather unusual film Servants (Film Four, Tuesday of last week). Set in a Czechoslovakian seminary during Communist times, in 1980, it told the story of young seminarians resisting the imposition of state power and trying to protect the integrity of the Gospel message. Unfortunately some of the college authorities were inclined to compromise to keep the State from closing the institution, which led to investigations, informing on colleagues and even one priest being blackmailed to break the seal of Confession. The title conveys the idea of service – to Church or State and the efforts to maintain that balance.\n\nFilmed in black and white it was a bleak, grim affair with a claustrophobic visual style. It wasn’t what we’d normally regard as entertainment, with an episodic approach, some confusing flashbacks and a largely static cinematography. Yet there were some striking visuals – the large group of seminarians on a spiral staircase, a courtyard football game filmed from above, a truckload of confiscated typewriters, two giant torch-carrying fists in stone butted against each other as seminarians play snowballs (see pic), a deliberately demeaning medical examination of one seminarian, the disposal of a priest’s body under an illuminated railway bridge at night.\n\nI felt it was weakest on character, not helped by the sparse narrative. I’d like to have understood more about why these young men were training for the priesthood and how they became so courageous and conscientious. The older men were more easily understood – the tired and conflicted priests in charge, collaborating for survival, and the tired and diseased state security man unhappy in his surveillance work but carrying it out routinely, almost robotically.\n\n10/6/22\n\nI came to Kenneth Brannagh’s film Belfast with high expectations and I wasn’t disappointed. It was humane, wistful nostalgic, optimistic but not oblivious to sadness. Set against the backdrop of the Troubles it wasn’t excessively violent. An opening scene where Catholic families were attacked in a mixed area gave us a sense of the sectarian context, so we understood the fear and tension, but the focus for the most part was on decent people – in particular a Protestant family with no interest in getting involved with sectarian strife.\n\nMost if not all of the action is seen through the eyes of Buddy (Jude Hill, excellent), a young boy negotiating family and social background. I’ve never seen Jamie Dornan so effective in a role – here he plays Buddy’s father, coping with debts, protecting his family and working in England. Caitríona Balfe is entirely relatable as Buddy’s mother, hoping to be able to carry on and not have her children drawn in to the street violence. The emphasis is mostly on ordinary family life, the politics is mostly peripheral, and there’s a welcome lack of melodrama and cliché.\n\nMaybe it’s a bit preachy at times, but in such a good and subtle film I’m inclined to forgive – the story is so absorbing and I didn’t feel I was being browbeaten by agendas.\n\nReligion is part of the social background, just accepted as part of life, the way things are. There are some funny scenes early on when the youngsters discuss Catholic practices like Confession – the misunderstandings are very funny. There’s a fire and brimstone sermon from a Paisley-like preacher who gets himself into a lather of sweat describing the horrors of hell in the most lurid terms. Later he seems much more humane and restrained at a funeral. One could argue that there is a slightly jaundiced attitude to religion, as if it’s the cause of sectarianism, rather than seeing the sectarian strife as a failure of people to be truly Christian. And yet at other times religion seems an integral and accepted part of one’s existence. I’m looking forward to seeing it again.\n\n14/1/21\n\nI recently saw the film Hidden Figures - about three feisty African American women who play an important part in the US space programme in the early 1960's. Performances from Octavia Spencer, Taraji P. Henson and Janelle Monáe in these roles are top notch, while Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Jim Parsons do well in other roles. The women encounter multiple prejudices - racism and sexism primarily even as they excel at their work. There is a particularly intense scene where the Costner character finally loses patience with the segregated bathrooms. The film is well disposed to religious faith without being preachy - their are positive scenes of church and grace at meal time.\n\n16/7/20\n\nStrong people of faith are rare enough when it comes to film and TV drama. One noticeable exception was the film Greyhoundwhich landed on Apple TV last Friday with very little fanfare. Tom Hanks played a navy captain escorting a merchant fleet across the Atlantic during the Second World War, and in an early scene we saw him praying by his bedside. Right through the drama he was a man of faith and honour. He fought against the German submarines attacking the fleet in mid ocean, too far out for air support, but was conscious of the unfortunate casualties when they sank a sub. He said grace before several meals that he never got to enjoy because some crisis distracted him. In an emotional scene he conducted a dignified and prayerful service of burial at sea but was also a calm, competent commander.\n\nThe violence was not graphic, and while there was one F-word it was apologised for immediately. The sea battle scenes were tense and exciting, though the digital effects were rather obvious. As often in war films it was hard to distinguish some of the young navy men from each other but I did like the way camera focused on their worried expressions. Hanks wrote the script himself and it was rather minimalistic, with lots of technical detail about radar, sonar and the like. The inclusion of Elizabeth Shue as the love interest was also minimalistic – she had little to do, and perhaps a longer lead in to the sea voyage might have been helpful for more effective character development.\n\nThe prayer scenes would certainly be useful in RE class.\n\n25/1/20\n\nA Hidden Life, directed by Terrence Malick (Tree of Life) tells the story of Austrian Franz Jägerstätter, a conscientious objector, who refuses to fight for the Nazis in World War II, or to swear allegiance to Hitler. It’s a challenge film – slow moving and nearly three hours long, but patient viewers will be rewarded. It’s a poetic and beautiful film enhanced by the wonderful classical soundtrack.\n\nThe story is told in a rather episodic and sometimes oblique way, but the characters are riveting and the acting excellent. The central characters are Franz (August Diehl) and his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner), but the secondary characters are fleshed out really well – especially Fani’s sister, Franz’s mother and the local priest.\n\nThroughout the film there is much play (in the home scenes), prayer, generosity, faith and in the prison scenes there is much cruelty (not really graphic) but also, even in prison there is hope, liberation, prayer and faith. And there’s temptation too – one prisoner tries rather intensely to deflect him from his religious faith.\n\nThe film is multi-layered – there’s the historical story of Franz and family, much allegory with biblical resonances (e.g. two very different prisoners reminded me of the two thieves crucified with Christ), conflicts of conscience, contrasts between people and nature, between rural and urban, and deep and true human emotion – a prison visit is particularly heart rending.\n\nFaith underpins the values and choices of Franz and his wife, but it’s not all easy going, and this is not a sentimental or preachy film. Characters wonder about what compromises they can make, about how God can seem to be silent when things are going wrong.\n\nI was reminded by plot themes and script of films like A Man for All Seasons (e.g. the prison visit) Sophie Scholl (the interrogation), Hacksaw Ridge, (conflict with superiors), even The Passion of the Christ, (the temptations)and of Malick’s own Tree of Life (style).\n\nFor school and Religious Education those other films, or at least clips from them, are more accessible for students, but there are useful scenes here too – especially conversations between Franz and others – his priest, his bishop, his interrogator, his lawyer and his judge. Dialogue is sparse enough but there’s an urgency and intensity about these scenes that should hold students’ attention.\n\n10/10/19\n\nI saw the film Unplanned a few nights ago and have mixed feelings about it. It tells the abortion related story of Abby Johnson, clinic director at Planned Parenthood, who eventually saw the wrongness of abortion and became a pro-life advocate. It’s a hard hitting exposé, and may well change hearts and save lives. It’s fairly graphic in the early stages, especially with one suction abortion at the clinic, and Johnson’s own chemical abortion. It’s good to see it getting a wide release in Ireland, though its impact will depend on whether it is attended by more than already-convinced pro-life advocates. For them it will be a huge motivator for continuing their work. It comes very much from a pro-life perspective, though all the usual pro-choice arguments are given an airing, especially by the sympathetic Johnson character herself as she promotes abortion to other young women.\n\nThe message is important and we get insights into the workings of the abortion industry, but I wasn’t impressed with the film on the artistic front. Ashley Bratcher did well in the central role, but other characters, especially the original clinic director and the men were quite wooden, with stilted performances. They were two-dimensional characters, often just used as ciphers for particular pro-life and pro-choice arguments.\n\nI did however see some artistic value in the scenes at the fence of the clinic – the fence acted as a useful symbol for the divisions on this issue, and some of the scenes there were quite moving – e.g. when Johnson, now on the outside, speaks to a young girl heading in for an abortion. An earlier scenes feature an African-American mother frantically trying to dissuade her daughter from aborting a grandchild. Early on we saw some aggressive anti-abortionists at the clinic but they were not treated sympathetically and to some extent the film was a promo for the initiative known as ‘40 Days for Life’, which relied more on prayer and gentle persuasion.\n\nAs regards school use, the graphic abortion scenes are not appropriate, but the scenes at the fence are certainly worthwhile for illustrating various aspects of this controversial issue. There’s also an emotional scene about forgiveness when Johnson discusses with her husband her regrets about the abortions she facilitated.\n\nThere are useful clips on Wingclips - https://www.wingclips.com/movie-clips/unplanned\n\n29/8/19\n\nI like films where conscience is taken seriously and all the more if the film making is of high quality. The film Hacksaw Ridge (Channel 5 last Sunday, RTE 2 last Monday) left me conflicted. It has so much good stuff going for it, but I have serious reservations. Directed by Mel Gibson it tells the true story of US Army medic Desmond Doss, a conscientious objector who saved the lives of many soldiers in the war against the Japanese. Andrew Garfield is excellent as this most appealing and admirable character who stands his ground despite misunderstanding and bullying, standing up for principles largely based on his religious faith – he was a 7th Day Adventist. There’s a sweet and innocent love story involving Doss and a young nurse, interrupted by his conviction that he must serve his country, despite being unwilling to kill another human being. There’s a touching scene where she visits him in jail as he awaits court martial for refusing to follow orders – reminiscent of that scene in A Man for All Seasons when his family visits St Thomas Moore in jail to see if compromise is possible. That court scene along with earlier scenes where he defends his conscientious objections to army authorities are quite compelling and tease out lots of conscience issues - suitable for school use when exploring themes of conscience, principle, virtue and church-state relations.\n\nDoss prays, holds his little Bible dear, especially as there’s a picture of his wife in it, but others who will take part in the war say they also hold to the same values but are willing to kill in what they regard as a just war. As one officer says to him – the Biblical ‘Thou Shalt Not Kill’ is usually taken to mean a prohibition on murder.\n\nHowever the big problem for me is the graphic violence – despite the overall theme it seems to wallow in the bloodletting to an unhealthy degree (the Gibson factor?). This is particularly the case in the opening scene and in the last quarter or so. No doubt it’s a realistic portrayal of the horrors of battle, but I’m not convinced that such repulsive detail is necessary to make the point. Further, I don’t think it’s intended to be an anti-war film as such – the film doesn’t question the need for this particular war, or even the need for the army to keep on attacking Hacksaw Ridge despite the huge losses. There’s a few uncomfortably gung-ho moments towards the end, but I did like the final sequence where we get to see some of the real people the film is based on.\n\n16/8/19\n\nFilms and TV programmes, when dealing with religious themes often go for the cultish, extreme or even twisted versions of faith, but on good days it’s just the pleasantly offbeat. Last Saturday night’s film on BBC Two was all of the above. Stations of the Cross is a German film, serious, well made, but not easy viewing. It told the story of a teenage girl receiving Confirmation preparation from a traditionalist Catholic group who reject the Pope and Vatican II. I found it absorbing, disturbing, sad and challenging. The traditional stations are compared to a series of 14 key events in the girl’s life over a short period. I think militant atheists will be confirmed in their distaste for religion, traditionalists will be displeased about the way they are portrayed and more mainstream people of faith will be uneasy (especially with a Communion scene) but also glad that their outlook is reflected in one of the most sympathetic characters, a French au pair named Bernadette. Apart from confronting the difficulties of being a traditionalist religious teen in a secular society it’s also about the idealism and naiveté of youth and how it much be carefully nurtured, and neither exploited nor crushed.\n\nI gathered another confession scene for my collection. It starts in an ordinary way, but the priests delves too much into sexual matters when the young girl has a delightful innocence. And it's not that that the priest is particularly creepy, but he probably feels he is just doing his duty. This sequence is matched to Simon helping Jesus, but it seems ironic here. Scenes with the girl in the hospital are tough going and belivers may wince when the medical staff have a problem with the girl reciving the Communion host, even though she has asked for it.\n\nThe minor characters are interesting - the mother comes out the worst - loving at times, but frequently cranky and very harsh and lacking in understanding. The father is almost an invisible presence, uneasy at what's happening but ineffectual. The young priest is cheerful, articulate and sincere but too much inclined towards legalism without human understanding.\n\nAll in all it's hard to see this film being useful in RE as it may put students off religion unless they have a very mature and solid faith.\n\n5/4/19\n\nThe movie Unplanned was released in the USA last week. It tells the story of Abby Johnson, formerly a clinic director for Planned Parenthood and now a pro-life advocate and it may well give quite a shake up to the abortion industry. Unplanned – Behind the Scenes (EWTN, Wednesday of last week) gave us an insight into the making of the film. What struck me most was the passion and faith inspiration of those involved. Of course this can sometimes lead to a film that’s overly preachy and therefore less effective with those who most need to get the message. Judging by the clips show it seems the film has avoided the pitfalls. I was impressed by the performance of Ashley Bratcher in the lead role – for her it wasn’t just another role, and in a quirk of fate she found out during the making of the film that she was minutes away from being aborted but her mother left the clinic in time – previously she was aware in a general sense that her mother had considered an abortion.\n\nThe real Abby Johnson and several other pro-life leaders, including Lila Rose, founder of Live Action, and Shawn Carney, co-founder of 40 Days for Life, were enthusiastic about the project and I was inspired by how committed the creative team were to religious faith and the pro-life cause. They even have a supportive prayer campaign accompanying the movie. There’s no sign of the film being released here yet, and when is does arrive I suspect the secular media will be knocking it, but then if the artistic standard is high maybe it will get a fair hearing. In the meantime clips are available athttps://www.wingclips.com/movie-clips/unplanned – worth a look.\n\n29/3/19\n\nBella is one of the most moving films I've seen in quite a while. Set in New York the plot concerns a young chef José who is damaged by a tragedy in the past and a young waitress, Nina, who feels her future is threatened by an unplanned pregnancy. It's slow moving at times, and as the story is not told entirely in a linear fashion it can be hard to figure out at times what's happening - but I see this as a virtue - it keeps the mind working on the figuring out and avoids predictability. The film largely avoids sentimentality too - there's a positive life affirming message, but it's not preachy and is all the more effective for that. The filming is excellent and Tammy Blanchard is outstanding as Nina, giving it an emotional credibility. There's a nice contrast of cultures too, especially when Nina visits José's family - I particularly liked the grace scene as they sit down to eat. The Latin interest in food family and music comes across strongly and it's like a warm blanket for Nina. There are conflicts, but they are handled with such empathy. There are subtle faith elements e.g. José using rosary beads and the grace before meals. As regards educational use the full film should suit senior classes - it's PG rated but juniors might find the pace slow and the plot development confusing. However I'd say they would appreciate that grace scene as one of José's brothers introduces his girlfriend to the family.\n\n28/3/19\n\nFor exploring the theme of forgiveness it might be worthwhile having a look at the film Amish Grace. This is based on a school shooting in the Amish community – it was noteworthy at the time because of how quickly that community offered forgiveness and engaged with the family of the shooter. The film is a bit stiff and wooden at times, and in the efforts to avoid it being too graphic or upsetting the shooting is treated so obliquely that it’s hard to know for a while what exactly has happened. Tammy Blanchard gives a fine performance as the shooter’s distraught wife and deftly captures the gamut of emotions she experiences. Kimberly Williams-Paisley does pretty well as the fictional mother of one of the victims – not surprisingly she has difficulty in being so forgiving and her inner turmoil gives rise to much of the dramatic conflict. Fay Masterson plays a reporter – the media view gives something of an outside perspective on the events, reflective how difficult it is for outsiders to understand the Amish commitment to forgiveness in the face of such tragedy. Likewise students may find the whole Amish thing a bit strange and hard to relate to, but some scenes may be useful – e.g. the community’s first visit to the home of the shooter. There are some strong discussions on forgiveness between the husband and wife of one of the victims, and a touching scene near the end where the mother visits one of the survivors in hospital. There is also the problematic issue of ‘shunning’ – where the community shuns those of their own who have abandoned the community. Background historical information would be useful here for context, and there is plenty of material online giving coverage of the original shooting.\n\n19/10/18\n\nI finally got around to see Lady Bird, Gretta Gerwig’s film starring Saoirse Ronan as Christine/Lady Bird, a teen nearing the end of High School trying to find her unique way in the world, while attending a Catholic school for girls. Despite some reservations I enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nIt’s an entirely credible and touching portrayal of family life – there are plenty of loving frictions, testy exchanges, naiveté, predictable outcomes, unwholesome behaviour, pettiness and great tenderness. The mother daughter relationship is particularly fraught – Laurie Metcalf is excellent as the mother – while that of father and daughter is low key but quite touching.\n\nIn some ways it’s a typical US indie teen movie and there are a few clichéd elements – how many times have we seen a genuine character trying foolishly to impress the cool kids while abandoning their true friends but later learning some sense. But it’s done so well here – largely thanks to Saoirse Ronan’s fine performance, capturing innocence and a darker side equally well.\n\nThe Catholic school background is positively portrayed – the priests and nuns are cheerful and dedicated, with a very human side – an approach that’s a rarity in modern films. There’s a priest who is dedicated to develop school dramas and a nun who responds kindly to a prank because she enjoyed it - some students tie a ‘Just married to Jesus’ sign on the convent car, but eventually Lady Bird says Jesus is ‘a lucky guy’ to have nuns of that calibre married to him! It’s all portrayed with a warm humanity.\n\nThe students are shown as not being that interested in religion – sometimes we see them respectful at Mass, but then again we find two of them, including Lady Bird, wolfing down communion hosts – while stressing that they are not consecrated. She declares very certainly that she does NOT want to go to Catholic colleges after high school. In her more rebellious phase she ridicules a teacher giving a pro-life talk, but it may be more the character than the film that is mocking her. She says just because something looks ugly doesn’t mean it’s morally wrong. Towards the end there is a church scene that is quite positive, but to say more would be a spoiler.\n\nThere are some stereotypes – the large Catholic family, the Irish girls getting ‘sloshed’ before noon on St Patrick’s Day. Though Catholic schooling is presented in a positive light, there is much in the values on show that are not in harmony with Catholic teaching (predictably in attitudes to pre-marital sex). There is quite a bit of foul language, the inevitable gay sub plot, very frank sexual dialogue and a few scenes of sexual activity that are strong enough but perhaps relatively restrained by modern standards (which aren’t very high in this area!) I’d suggest there’s little to suit school use in terms of suitable clips, though perhaps the scene where we expect the nun to scold Lady Bird because of the prank might be useful to portray kindness and understanding, and the scene where the priest tries to get the drama class to cry on cue is rather moving.\n\nThere's quite a collection of music on the soundtrack including Rosa Mystica, Performed by the University of Notre Dame Folk Choir with Music by Chrysogonus Waddell, OCSO.\n\n10/8/18\n\nOn RTE 1 last week I watched Spotlight, a challenging film that outlined in dramatic form the Boston Globe’s investigation into child sexual abuse by priests in that diocese and the subsequent cover-up by Church authorities. The film’s approach was restrained, but of course the abuse highlighted was appalling and any discomfort of Catholic viewers pales into minor significance by comparison. On an artistic level the film was absorbing as the newspaper’s ‘Spotlight’ team forensically investigated the abuse and how it was handled by Church authorities. Civil society, including journalism, didn’t escape lightly either – there was considerable reluctance in police circles to bring abusive priests to book, lawyers facilitated confidential settlements, and even staff at the Boston Globe ignored or missed information sent to them years previously. The film proceeded almost thriller-like with its investigation of the facts, and certainly there was no cheap voyeurism or melodrama. And yet the crusading narrative was somewhat simplistic at times – too often it felt like ‘journalists good, priests bad’. At one stage it was suggested that 6% of priests were likely to abuse, but we got to see precious little of the 94% (there are passing references to two priests who helped, including one auxiliary bishop). I thought there was little of broader context or insight into the phenomenon, e.g. in a throwaway remark it was suggested without evidence that celibacy was at the heart of the problem, and there was no sense that abuse figures for non-Catholic clergy and other professions are similar. There was one scene where an elderly priest tried to rationalise his behaviour to one of the journalists but this intriguing conversation was cut short by the priest’s sister who shut the door on the journalist.\n\nThe film should act as a salutary tale to faithful mature Catholics, a warning against moral blindness, lust, arrogance, clericalism and abuse of power. For others, especially younger viewers, I fear the effect will be to increase prejudice and alienate them from this community of sinners we call the Church.\n\n26/4/18\n\nI saw the film Goodbye Christopher Robin twice recently and think it's brilliant. Domhnall Gleeson is so good in everything he does. Prayers figure a few times in a very positive and endearing way in the early stages as the young 'Christopher Robin/Billy Moon' says prayers at his bedside. Faith doesn't play much of a role other than that, even in times of crisis, but the film is full of warm humanity without being mushy about it. The film is about the life of A.A. Milne, author of the Winnie the Pooh stories. Whether you love the stories or not, I think the film is endearing - the prayer scenes might be useful in RE class - maybe teasing out how childhood prayers could become mature adult prayers, rather than being left behind.\n\n14/12/17\n\nIt was a treat earlier in the week to see the new film in the Star Wars series. Star Wars: The Last Jedi has some eyer popping moments, and while many popular characters return (especially Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill) there are many fresh elements in the plot and visuals - including the scenes shot in Iceland - the red and white motif is particularly striking. Of course Skellig Michael in Kerry figures large and those sweeping aerial shots make it look hugely impressive. Little did the monks of early Christian Ireland think their secluded location would become so popular. The fictional place is described as being one of the remotest places in the galaxy! The beehive huts are central, and there are ancient texts, though I think it's the first time that Jedi is referred to as a religion in the films. I'm open to correction on that. And I realise that some people today declare themselves Jedi when asked about their religion! Commentators have often drawn parallels between religion and 'The Force', though it seems more Buddhist or New Age than Christian. One of the rebels (the good guys!) at one stage says 'God speed' as others leave on a dangerous mission, but this isn't explored further. The universal struggle between good and evil is is noteworthy throughout - evil is clearly recognised for what it is - and the process of temptation is intensely played out in the character of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) - some ket temptation scenes might be useful for RE.. It was good to see the late Carrie Fisher still in the role of Princess Leia, but a pity that she's not around for the release.\n\n24/8/17\n\nThe film The Lady in the Van turned up on BBC 2 last Saturday - my expectations were low but I really enjoyed it. And I was pleasantly surprised by the faith content, which I wasn't expecting. The film tells the story of Miss Shepherd, a homeless lady who parks her van in the driveway of writer Alan Bennett and stays for years. It's a warm human story about unusual relationships. Bennett claims he put up with her out of laziness but I suspect he is just being modest. I also liked the way the story is populated by quirky secondary characters, most of whom are kind to the lady, apart from the ex-policeman who blackmails her periodically. He manipulates the burden of guilt that she carries - relating to a traffic accident from the past. This guilt haunts her and she seems to be a regular at Confession over the matter, though in a new Confession scene for my collection the priest assures her that absolution doesn't expire! She had spent some time in a convent and the nuns don't come out of that too well, reinforcing some negative stereotypes, but I don't think the film is bashing religion. Bennett's homosexuality is obvious and portrayed sympathetically but treated subtly. And I loved the way he has two personas, both well played by Alex Jennings, so that we get an insight into his inner debates and conflicts. As usual Maggie Smith in the title role makes excellent acting look effortless.\n\n13/1/17\n\nI really enjoyed the film Love and Friendship which I rented online a few nights ago. It is based on a lesser known Jane Austen novel, Lady Susan, and was filmed in Ireland. Lady Susan herself, well played by Kate Beckinsdale, is a thoroughly unlikeable character - manipulative, cynical and not very loving towards her daughter, but the joy of the film is its wit and irony, and its barbed social commentary. Religion figured here and there ... there's some funny confusion over the fourth commandment, the obligations of which commandment are teased out several times. There's a young clergyman who is quite enthusiastic but not very intuitive - Lady Susan's daughter comes to him for advice, but gets a learned sermon instead. Mind you he's not as silly as Rev Mr Collins in Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I'd love to see it soon again as there's quite an array of characters and sub plots, mostly based around relationships, so on a second viewing things might make more sense, especially in the opening scenes.\n\n15/12/16\n\nI was lucky enough to get to the Irish premier of Martin Scorcese's new film Silence a few nights ago. It was quite a challenging experience and I'm still conflicted about it. In writing about it I must be constrained as I must do my best to avoid spoilers.\n\nIt's great to see such a highly regarded Hollywood director taking such a deep and serious interest in religion. I doubt it will be a huge commercial success, so I reckon it must be a labour of love. It seems Scorcese has been dedicated to the project for quite some time. Based on the novel by Shûsaku Endô the film tells the story of Jesuit missionaries to Japan in the 17th Century, when many were martyred and some renounced their faith.\n\nThere was much to be admired about the film – the cinematography was superb, right from the misty and moody beginning which portrayed a gruesome martyrdom, with the lush greenery and hilly landscapes of Taiwan standing in for Japan. The acting was excellent, especially from Liam Neeson as a Jesuit who has allegedly gone native and Andrew Garfield as a young priest on a mission to find him. Though nearly 3 hours long I found it absorbing throughout, whether in the action scenes (quite violent) or in the more talky scenes where varying approaches to life, religion, culture and universal truths are teased out. Some characters display an intensity of faith and willingness for self-sacrifice that will leave many in a modern audience scratching their heads, mystified. There are deep conflicts between courage, compromise and cowardice – to say these conflicts are thought provoking is putting it mildly. Much of the action is filtered through the Garfield character, whose faith is sorely put to the test.\n\nTrying to discern the overall point of view of the film isn't easy, and maybe it's deliberately so. I didn't find the overall impact uplifting though it was certainly inspiring at times and challenging throughout. The attitude to religion I found ambiguous, and I suspect that Christians, Buddhists and non-believers alike will all find something to lift them and something to cast them down. The ambiguity was there right to the end. What's not ambiguous is the reality of human weakness, especially in the face of tortuous dilemmas. In some respects it seems to show martyrdom in a poor light, and yet one could also find admiration for the courage of martyrs. There was little ambiguity in the matter of religious intolerance – the suffering inflicted on the local Catholics and the visiting priests came across as a thorough indictment, with plenty of resonance for modern times. I felt that the motivation of the local political figures in seeking to crush Christianity could have been clearer.\n\nThere are negatives. I though the inclusion of the 'voice of God' in a few instances was rather random and presumptuous, even if it was possibly in the mind of one of priests. The cruelty portrayed was intense throughout, and some will find it overly graphic. For the most part the best lines and prominence are given to priests who renounce their faith while those who don't are under-developed as characters. No doubt the director found their struggles the most interesting and complex. It is worth noting that those who renounce their Catholic faith seem spiritless after that but were passionate and energetic before it.\n\nAt times I thought this was a truly unique film, and in many ways it is. But then I was frequently reminded of other films – The Passion of the Christ (extreme violence in an artistic religious film), A Man For All Seasons (martyrdom, conscience v state), Apocalypse Now (seeking a prominent figure who has gone rogue), The Mission (historical, cultural differences, epic sweep). There were plenty of Biblical parallels, especially linking the sufferings of the priests to the Passion of Christ. For example, in a Palm Sunday moment, though reversed somewhat, the Garfield character (who looks like traditional images of Christ at this stage) arrives into a town on horseback (or was it a donkey?) a prisoner reviled by the people. There are resonances of Gethsemane and several crucifixion motifs. At one point the Garfield character is accused of arrogance for relating his sufferings to those of Christ.\n\nAs regards educational use I'd be doubtful. Apart from the length of it, the vicious cruelty, torture and graphic killings are a big problem for school use. As regards faith I suspect young people might just find it weird, and it could as easily shake their faith as nourish it. At the very least it's a film for those of mature and firm faith. Plenty of background information and context would be needed beforehand and a lot of guided discussion afterwards. That being said individual clips might be useful – for example there's a striking scene of Eucharist and quite a few Confession scenes, including several featuring a Japanese man who confesses the same sin of apostasy several times, is always sincere and always sins again – to the point of these scenes acting as comic relief.\n\nMy reactions to the film are still in a state of flux, so I may revisit!\n\n7/5/16\n\nDuring the week I finally got to see the film Sing Street, having heard it praised widely. In a way it's a well worn plot, with young people starting a rock band (this time in 80's Dublin) - reminiscent of The Commitments, School of Rock and That Thing You Do. In fact there's even a nod to Romeo and Juliet. On the plus side it was very funny in spots, especially in the early stages, as the students assemble the band and find their musical identity. Teachers will find lots to laugh at and even some stuff to shiver at as the students get up to mischief, not all of it a matter of harmless larks. Bullying and domestic discord also darken the mood. The original music is excellent as well, and lead actor Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, effectively subtle in his role as Cosmo, does all his own singing. However there is an element of Catholic bashing and some lazy stereotyping of Christian Brothers (the film is set in Synge St!), which spoils the overall good-humoured nature of the proceedings. Yes, teachers can be bullies as well as students, but tarring a whole group with the same brush wouldn't be tolerated in other circles. I won't include a spoiler but I found the ending rather weak and stretching credulity.\n\n18/3/16\n\nPeople (Koreans in this case) encountering racist attitudes was central to the plot of the film Gran Torino, shown on TV 3, last Sunday night. I was never a fan of Clint Eastwood’s macho anti-heroes from his early days, but he has matured wonderfully as an actor and director – he filled both roles with distinction for this film. If anything he flipped his usual persona this time, especially towards the end, but to say more on that front would be too much of a spoiler!\n\nOne engaging plot strand had the Eastwood character, Walt, in an ongoing skirmish with the young local priest who promised his now deceased wife that he’d try to get Clint back to the Church. This culminated in a touching and funny Confession scene – the priest, suspicious of Walt's motives, expected some atrocity from Walt’s time in Vietnam, but what Walt was most worried about was kissing another woman at a Christmas party, short changing another person in a deal over a boat and not knowing his sons well enough.\n\n8/1/16\n\nWatched plenty of films and TV dramas over the holiday period. Finally caught up with the film Gravity, with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. Eye-popping visuals and a tense storyline, and I was surprised to find some faith elements. At one stage, on a Russian space station attention is given to what looks like an icon of St Christopher carrying the baby Jesus, and later in a crisis Bullock's character expresses regret that no-one taught her how to pray.\n\n17/2/15\n\nI finally got to see the film Selma last night and it was certainly worth the trip. David Oyelowo was excellent as Martin Luther King and even better was Carmen Ejogo as his wife Corettta. Their relationship was one of the most interesting aspects of the film, but it wasn't thoroughly developed... things were more hinted at and the actors, especially Ejogo, conveyed the emotional subtleties really well.\n\nThe film seemed to accept to some extent the stories of King's womanising tendencies, while at the same time hinting at FBI plots to discredit him. King came across as confident and sure footed in public, but conflicted in private, as he tried to steer a non-violent path on the way to getting for black people vindication of their right to vote - the right was there in Alabama, but country officials threw so many obstacles in the way of registration that it was practically impossible.\n\nThe filmmakers were wise to concentrate on this one particular phase of King's life, culminating in the famous civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery. The first effort to cross the iconic bridge in Selma was met by brute force on the part of the police and that is conveyed in an effective but quite frightening way. Moments like these are unbearably tense and necessarily violent, but at least our sympathies were with the victims and not the perpetrators.\n\nConflicts within the movement were acknowledged and highlighted which guards against the film being overly sentimental, though there's an understandably triumphal mood at the end.\n\nReligious faith is prominent in the film and sympathetically presented. King, a pastor, is obviously motivated by his faith, as are many of his supporters. At the march, supportive priests, ministers and nuns are very much in evidence. I thought some early scenes were a tad lethargic and overly talky which would make classroom use of the full film tough going, and with hints of King's affairs and a little bad language it mightn't be appropriate for juniors anyway.\n\nOverall I found it an inspiring and moving film and can see plenty of opportunities for school use, especially using clips, in teaching themes like human dignity, justice, politics and faith, courage, maturity of conscience and more. Suitable scenes include one, early on, where a black woman, played by Oprah Winfrey, is thwarted in her efforts to register for voting. Any of King's speech scenes are excellent, including an early one on the importance of the right to vote. The attack on the first march will hold the attention of any class and encourage a strong sense of injustice, though the violence is rather strong. There's a useful scene as well at the second march where King leads the crowd in a silent prayer.\n\n1/10/14\n\nAnother 'Resource of the Day' to highlight - this time I've chosen this supper scene from the wonderful film 'Of Gods and Men'. It comes near enough to the end of the film when the monks who are under threat from insurgents in North Africa. They have decided, despite the danger, to stay on and serve the local community, largely Muslim. The film has many wonderful moments suitable for classes dealing with inter-faith relations, sense of community, the religious life, ritual and more, but this scene is particularly powerful, especially if you have watched the film up to this point so that you know the characters involved. Not a word is spoken, but the scene is beautiful and emotional. The parallels with the Last Supper are clear, and this clip is a wonderful resource for classes on table fellowship. My study guide to the full film is here.\n\n30/9/14\n\nToday's 'Resource of the Day' is a link to Decent Films, a film reviewing website that takes a faith perspective into account. The writer, Steven D. Greydanus, has written for many American catholic publications. His reviews are detailed and perceptive and should help any RE teacher looking for suitable films for the classroom. Maybe I'm calling him perceptive because I agree with most of what he writes! For example there's his recent review of Calvary (here), the best I've read so far, and also of Noah (here). Going back to 2003 I liked his review of Bruce Almighty (here) , often used in RE when studying images of God.\n\nYesterday I highlighted the last interrogation scene from Sophie Scholl: The Final Days, definitely my favourite film for RE. The film tells the true story of Sophie Scholl, a young woman and marvellous role model who campaigned against the Nazis in Munich in the early 1940's. The film packs a powerful punch, and this scene is one of the most useful for RE - touching on themes of racism, conscience, discrimination and more. If you start with this scene you may be persuaded to continue ... shortly after there is a very intense trial scene (the ranting Nazi judge was just like that in real life). As for the ending ....\n\n11/6/14\n\nStill catching up. This week I've been attending events for the Ecumenical Bible Week. In particular there are presentations on the Bible and Film and the Bible and Music. On Monday I got to the film presentation in the Presbyterian Church in Arklow and it an excellent night. David Shepherd, Assistant Professor of Hebrew/Old Testament in the Loyola Institute and Trinity College, explored many aspects of the Bible and film, focussing especially on the recent film Noah and what director Darren Aronofsky intended. He reflected on the biblical and non-biblical aspects and had plenty of clips to illustrate the point. He also looked at Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ especially the portrayal of the non-scriptural Veronica, and where her story might have originated. He related this to a much earlier portrayal of her in a film by French director Alice Guy Blaché, who started making films in 1896 and died in 1968!\n\n25/4/14\n\nI have mixed views about the film Calvary and I suspect it will polarise audiences. It has quite a bit going for it, but many downsides as well, a bit like the flawed humanity it portrays.\n\nBrendan Gleeson gives a powerhouse performance as a priest in the West of Ireland who is told in the opening confession scene that he will be murdered in a week. The rest of the film develops as a sort of countdown to that fateful Sunday on a local beach. Gleeson's Father Lavelle is portrayed as a good man, surrounded mostly by crude and/or vain locals. He goes about his priestly work with empathy and care for his parishioners and we also see him saying Mass and hearing confessions. There's little of the support structures that priests usually have in a parish, and most of the surrounding characters are quite off-putting from the dodgy guard to the drunken businessman living in the big house and the foul-mouthed male prostitute.\n\nIt's an interesting twist that the priest was previously married and has a troubled daughter. She felt that by joining the priesthood after his wife died he had left her with two parents lost to her. She is one of the few sympathetic characters as is the American writer that the priest supplies with provisions. There is some good-natured fun between the priest and a canny altar boy. There are lots of anti-Catholic jibes, especially about paedophile priests, which is a prominent theme, but one could argue that these come from the obnoxious characters and therefore may not form part of the viewpoint of the film.It's not only these elements that that makes the film fit only for mature audiences. The language is frequently though not relentlessly crude and some of the violence is graphic. Suicide is also a strong theme. In its favour Gleeson's performance is a standout, eliciting our sympathy for this good but troubled man.\n\nThemes of forgiveness and redemption are woven into the plot and if anything the film has a very favourable view of the work of a priest, and there are harsh words for his fellow priest who is not very dedicated to the work, though he is a bit of a cliché - I've seen so many dramas where a passionate priest was paired with a wimp of one sort or another. I felt that some of the worthy themes were handled in bite-sized snippets and that the treatment often lacked depth.\n\nDue to the adult content I don't see a lot of use for this film in RE for young people. The confession scene at the start is too crude, but there's a beautiful sequence where the priest anoints a foreigner who has been fatally injured in a car crash, and consoles his wife immediately afterwards. The local doctor's cynicism seems all the more ugly in this light. The forgiveness theme is highlighted in two matching phone call scenes near the end, both involving the daughter, but without context these scenes, especially the latter, won't make much sense.\n\nThere are clichéd and melodramatic scenes (e.g. the pub shoot up) contrasted with some beautifully filmed scenery, making for an interesting but unsatisfying whole. It's heart is in the right place but a dose of subtlety wouldn't have gone astray.\n\n18/4/14\n\nSome other thoughts on Noah ... I deliberately avoided reading any reviews until I had seen the film for myself. It has been fun reading the reviews since then and the film has certainly divided people. For a wide spread try these. The first article is quite negative, the second challenges it and the others range from positive to mixed.\n\nhttp://drbrianmattson.com/?offset=1396394788758\n\nhttp://seenthatmovietoo.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/is-darren-aronofskys-noah-gnostic/ http://www.catholicnews.com/data/movies/14mv040.htm http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3036/inoahi_a_theological_reflection.aspx https://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/noah-controversy/\n\n(the last two by prominent film critic Steven Greydanus)\n\nhttp://wordonfire.org/Written-Word/articles-commentaries/April-2014/Noah--A-Post-Modern-Midrash.aspx (review by Fr Robert Barron)\n\nMeanwhile last Friday's God Slot (RTE Radio 1) had Barry McMillan's perceptive review of the film. He seemed to like it, especially its message of mercy and respect, but called it 'relentlessly odd', 'quite mad' and a 'spectacular grand folly'. He thought the film adhered to the spirit of the original text in Genesis, even if some odd unusual elements were added.\n\n7/4/14\n\nGot to see the film Noah tonight, and so these are first impressions. I may add more later, after 'mature reflection'.\n\nWell first of all the good stuff. Noah is an impressive film on many levels. Sometimes the visuals are poetic and the special effects dramatic. The acting in the main roles is excellent. Russell Crowe seems able to bring a striking humanity to epic roles (eg Master and Commander, Gladiator), Anthony Hopkins dominates his scenes as Noah's Grandfather, Jennifer Connelly is convincing as Noah's wife though she doesn't seem to age as much he does! Emma Watson is fine as an adopted daughter though the characters of Noah's sons are underdeveloped.\n\nThere are two sequences that RE teachers may find particularly useful - a poetic creation sequence as Noah tells the story to his children, and the beautiful rainbow event near the end. This ultimately gives the film a sense of hope and optimism that was absent from much of the film.\n\nThe bleakness is because Noah is convinced that God, referred to throughout as 'The Creator', is punishing all of humanity and is just going to save the 'innocent' animals, using Noah as his vehicle. At times it seems that director Darren Aronofsky is pushing a trendy environmentalist line, a bit like the way the Noah story is treated in Evan Almighty. But it's not that simple, as faith and hope in a loving humanity is restored, a humanity that hopefully will have respect for creation.\n\nThe film takes major liberties with the Genesis story, the most bizarre aspect being the 'Watchers', a bunch of giant rock creatures that are reminiscent of the walking tree creatures (The Ents) in the Lord of the Rings films. It turns out that these are angels that The Creator is punishing for siding with human beings and trying to help them. They protect Noah from other humans who want to be taken on to the Ark and a great big battle scene ensues, a field day for the CGI artists! The Ark itself is more like a fortress, all square shaped and ugly, looking like something that couldn't possibly float. The deluge is spectacular when it comes, not just rain but geysers rising from the earth and the scenes of people drowning are quite distressing. That, the strong violence and a brief suggestive scene rule out the very young.\n\nThe film drags a bit after that, complete with sub-plot about an evil stowaway! The film teases out issues of good and evil, love, discerning the will of God, temptation, choice and free will, and in that way is a cut above many current films.\n\nI see that one of my favourite films The Execution of Private Slovik is now available on DVD (e.g. here at Amazon). This is a 1974 TV movie starring Martin Sheen in the true story of Eddie Slovik, the only US soldier executed for desertion in World War 2. Have ordered it from Amazon, but I did get to see it again few years ago and here's what I wrote at the time: 'It was simple basic and hard hitting, and as moving as ever. It is not in the least heavy handed in it's message, and some viewers may even find Slovik a somewhat unsympathetic character. Two scenes in particular are useful for class - around the middle of the film the chaplain talks to the firing squad about the morality of it all, and towards the end there is Slovik's final experience of the Sacrament of Reconciliation. He prays on the way to execution, but this scene is tough going and may not be suitable for younger classes at least. And without the context of the full film the emotional impact wouldn't be the same. '\n\n5/8/13\n\nFinally caught up with the film Stella Days last night. I was well disposed towards it, being a fan of Martin Sheen, but though it has its good points I found it hard to warm to. Clichés abound in yet another of these awful-Ireland-of-the-past films. The storyline has Fr Barry (Sheen) starting up a cinema in Borrisokane, out off his love for the art form but also to raise funds for a new Church he's not too enthusiastic about. Predictably the cardboard cut-out cranky old bishop (Tom Hickey, in an unsubtle performance) is against it on moral grounds (the filth!) until he sees the money being raked in by other cinemas. Even more opposed is the local politician, right wing Catholic of course (one-note surly acting from Stephen Rea).\n\nIn a way there are too many plots, many of them predictable, for any of them to be handled with any depth - the story of Fr Barry's vocation, whisked away to seminary at age 12, the handsome new teacher who falls for the lonely abandoned wife, the young boy waiting for his father to come home from England, the EBS woman promoting rural electrification, the old lady whose faith is dodgy but who thrives on multiple anointings. The verdict isn't all bad however. Martin Sheen brings a certain warmth to his role that is largely absent from the rest of the film. We can empathise with his efforts to live out a vocation he may never have had, and yet see the vanity that motivates to want to get back to the academic life in Rome. I can't remember any instance of him praying, he's overly distracted by the cinema controversy and in one scene seems unconcerned or even tacitly approving of the adulterous relationship between the teacher and the lodger. Yet he cares for and is kind to his people without in any way trying to lord it over them as the politician and the bishop would like him to do. They're big on control while he wants to be of service.\n\nThough largely dark in mood, the films tries hard at the start to be whimsical, with a pleasantly light-hearted music score and some entertaining confession scenes to add to my collection - most of the time it's people confessing that they've taken the Lord's name in vain. We see him performing several of the Sacraments, for the most part treated respectfully, though one scene seemed to suggest that the new electric cookers were 'magic' like the Eucharist. I couldn't see myself using the full film in class, but the confession scenes might be useful.\n\n1/1/13\n\nI saw the Oscar winning Mystic River for the first time during the holidays and was impressed. It's rough, with lots of F-Words, fairly strong violence and a child abuse theme, but none of this is gratuitous and the film is superbly directed by Eastwood (he doesn't star) and the acting is top-notch as would be expected from the likes of Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Baco and Laura Linney. It's a murder story with an absorbing plot, but is full of humanity. There's a religious background in that many characters are Irish Americans, and there's a First Communion scene.\n\nAlso saw the film Nativity! for the first time - it stars Martin Freeman as a teacher in a Catholic Primary School in England who is reluctanly persuaded to take on the school nativity play. I don't think it's a classic, and teachers will find some unrealistic elements (e.g. a teacher taking two pupils to Los Angeles under the impression that parents had signed permissions!), but it's good natured and amusing, with some touching scenes. The final nativity play is more than a tad over the top, but there's no denying the feel-good atmosphere.\n\n29/10/12\n\nLast night I went to see Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in the O2 in Dublin - it was on a giant screen with full orchestra and choirs onstage providing a live soundtrack. As you got absorbed in the film it was easy to forget that the music was live, and every now and then I looked at the musicians and singers to remind myself that they were present - might have been easier to be aware of that if I hadn't been so far back in the venue! I was reminded of how the scenes with Gollum/Smeagol so well captured the conflict between good and evil in all of us - thiough normally it's not so dramatic. There are several scenes where this character, so damaged by his pursuit of earthly power symbolised by the Ring, engages in this inner conflict, torn between being loyal to the good Hobbits and wanting to kill them for selfish reasons.\n\n11/4/12\n\nLast night I finally got to see the film Gran Torino, where Clint Eastwood plays an irascible old racist in conflict with local immigrants. There's quite a bit of foul and racist language so I can't see myself using it in school, but there's a interesting young priest in the story. He promised the Eastwood character's wife who has just died that will keep an eye on Walt and try to get him to Confession. Needless to say Grumpy old Walt resists. The priest is young, and perhaps naieve (Walt didn't have much time for his funeral oration) but he does persist and both of them learn a lot about life and death. The scenes between them are quite entertaining and thought provoking. Ultimately there's a touching and funny Confession scene - another worthy addition to my collection of Confession scenes!\n\n10/1/12\n\nOne of the best films I saw during the holidays was Doubt , starring Meryl Streep as a school principal and nun who must deal with the suspicion that the school chaplain, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman is conducting an inappropriate relationship with a student. It is set in the early 1960's and the period flavour is well conveyed. The acting is excellent as would be expected of Streep and Hoffman, and the script by John Patrick Shanley has a sharpness and intelligence that is rare in mainstream cinema. The controversial issue of abuse is handled subtly and with restraint, and I didn't sense any hidden agendas or axe-grinding. One could raise issues - e.g. why does no-one seem to question the child? Is the mother's attitude credible? Yet in the context of the time and within the world of the film it was believable. As regards school use, I'd be hesitant. There is a useful scene where the priest gives a strong sermon on the damaging effects of gossip, but I think the film is best suited to a mature audience. For very young students it might just reinforce the paedophile priest stereotype, and they mightn't get the film's subtleties.\n\n30/8/11\n\nThe Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler, a film shown on RTE in the early hours of last Thursday, told the inspiring and true story of a Catholic social worker in Nazi-occupied Warsaw who smuggled Jewish children out of the ghetto to save them from deportation to extermination camps. Anna Paquin, a former child actor who has made a fine transition into adult roles, played Sendler, and was the emotional heart of the film. While it lacked the dramatic intensity of Polanski's The Pianist, one thing the film did well was to show the internal conflicts among the Jews about whether they should let their children be looked after by Polish families who would pretend the children were Catholic. Some couldn't let go emotionally, some couldn't believe that the cultured Germans could plan such a fate for the Jews, some feared their children might be converted, though Sendler stressed that this wasn't her intention.\n\nThough it was somewhat slow in developing the story in the early stages, there were some heart-rending moments, especially when children were separated from their parents, even to save them. There was an especially unsettling scene as children were rounded up from the ghetto orphanages - they went off singing as they thought they were going to a better place. The bleak faces of the adults and Sendler's frustration told a different story.\n\nNazi atrocities were not that graphically portrayed, though the atmosphere of fear was well conveyed. The worst sequence was the interrogation of Sendler by the Gestapo.\n\nAs for specifically religious content, it was unobtrusive. The local priest was seen helping Sendler, convents were seen to be hiding Jewish children, respect was shown to the Jewish tradition - there was no intention to convert the children, and Sendler kept records so that the children could, if possible, be reunited with their own families after the war.\n\nScenes that would be useful in class include a Seder meal, a family discussion on whether the children should be hidden with Christian families, an early scene where some of Sendler's co-workers can't bring themselves to help the Jews because of prejudice (see clip above, which also features other useful scenes). A Jewish community scene also discusses the issue of what to do with the children and raises the difficult of lying to stay alive e.g. documents are forged, Jewish children pretend to be Christian by learning to bless themselves and say Christian prayers - mental reservation anyone?\n\nAs the film ends there's a touching addition where the real Sendler speaks about the Jewish mothers who gave up their children and the Christian mothers who risked their lives to save them. She died in 2008 at the age of 98!\n\nFor more information on Irena Sendler, including educational resources, go here: http://www.irenasendler.com/\n\n12/7/11\n\nThe Tree of Life: director Terrence Malick specialises in reflective storylines, interesting characters and stunning visuals. The Tree of Life includes all these but the emphasis is not so much on plot this time, which makes for challenging viewing. It's a long film (about 2 hours 20 mins), it's episodic like a series of memories, the timeline isn't chronological, the viewer will have to work hard to make sense of it at times, but I'd say the patient, reflective viewer will find it rewarding. The plot, which is only one aspect of this complex film, concerns a family in USA in the 1950's - the father (Brad Pitt) loves his wife (Jessica Chastain) and children but is gruff and rather domineering. This causes problems for his three sons, one of whom, Jack (Sean Penn) we see in his later adult life, trying to find meaning. The film was most appealing to me in the family life scenes, but these scenes are just fragments, only sometimes approaching \"normal\" film style.\n\nThe acting throughout was superb - Pitt can be both appealing and off-putting as the father, Chastain is the moral and emotional core of the film as the mother, Sean Penn doesn't have a lot to do, while the child actors are excellent, especially Hunter McCracken as the young Jack.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful - the camera lingers lovingly (boringly, I'm sure some will say!) on water, skyscapes, sunflowers. These visuals are accompanied subtly by light classical music, and overall the clarity of the picture is exceptional - see it on Blu-Ray when it comes out on DVD!\n\nThere is a strong faith element, but it's more reflective than preachy. The Book of Job figures strongly (the film starts with a quote from the book) and a variety of prayers and scriptural quotations graces the film. Some of the background music is religious as well - e.g. there's a striking Agnus Dei at a particularly significant moment.\n\nBig meaning of life questions are raised and answers are only hinted at. The issue of human suffering is tackled, mainly through the efforts of Jack to make sense of what he has learned about God and the world. The father is a religious man, but it seems too much on the surface, while with the mother it's a more internal thing. Her opening voiceover (clip above), on what she has learned about the difference between nature and grace is crucial to an understanding of the film's themes.\n\nNeedless to say I was wondering how this might be used in school. Certainly I can't see myself showing the full film - I'd suspect students might mitch to avoid it! But there are some useful clips - e.g. the opening voiceover of the mother, a scene where young Jack is praying, a sermon in church, a scene near the end that may be a representation of Heaven.\n\nOne could fault the film for its perfunctory plot, its overuse of lingering pretty pictures, its excessive length,. Some critics have accused it of being ponderous and pretentious (which I wouldn't agree with). Yet it gives the impression that it was well thought out and that everything is the way it is for a good reason. The one thing I'd be less inclined to make allowances for is the difficulty at times of making out what the characters are saying - what with the regional accents and the mumbling and whispering. There's little enough dialogue, so I would have thought it should be clearer. I'd be inclined to activate the subtitles when I get the DVD.\n\nThe more I think about the film the more I find I want to see it again, and that wasn't my first reaction. I think it's one of those films that call for a second viewing - there's just too much to take in first time around.\n\nIn the last few days I've been showing parts of the film Sophie Scholl, The Final Days, with 3rd Year students. (Sophie Scholl was a real life character who campaigned against the Nazis in Germany - she was arrested for leafletting). It fits in really well with the morality element of the course. I even used the clip on left as past of my assessment with the TY students. This clip is the final interrogation of Sophie, and the script is based on transcripts of the original interrogation. One could get several classes out of this ten-minute clip - issues raised include conscience, the state and religion, empathy, world view, persecution of the Jews and the mentally ill, and God. Sophie is a great role model for young people, but even the interrogator is an interesting character. I was glad to see the third years absorbed by this, as there's a lot of talk, and it's subtitled.\n\n29/5/11\n\nFinally got to see The Way last night, and I wasn't disappointed. This new film is about a father-son relationship and is set against the background of the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain. Martin Sheen plays the father, while his son Emilio Estevez plays the son, and also wrote and directed.\n\nIt was quite moving, challenging and thought provoking. Gradually we get to know the Sheen character and the motley crew he meets up with. It's a strongly human film, and its empathy with the characters is what makes it involving and touching. The Pilgrimage motif is of course a powerful one - the journey through life, the baggage we carry apart from our backpacks, the varying paths we take, the people we journey with. Estevez uses the motif subtly enough, but may have been worried about critical reaction as he has the Irish writer (played by James Nesbitt) revel in the \"metaphor bonanza\" and yet wonder if he is being over fanciful - things may be what they seem and no more than that. Perhaps Estevez wishes to distance himself from having an overly religious film - at one stage a minor character says it's not about religion at all, and stresses the point. None of the characters makes an obvious connection with God in any way, yet the film is imbued, in a positive way, with religion, without being heavy handed in any way. The Sheen character prays, though at the beginning he doesn't see the point. In a key scene the woman struggles with prayer. Churches and religious images abound, and there are at least two positive priest characters.\n\nThere are some fine set pieces, and such scenes may well be useful in RE, though the full film is probably too long and leisurely for youngsters. Near the start a French policeman explains the nature of the pilgrimage, and later, on the road, the pilgrims discuss the nature of the \"true pilgrim\" (both clips useful in classes on pilgrimage). For symbolism there's a scene at one point where the tradition is to say a prayer and leave a stone at a particular monument (useful for ritual as well). The scene where they arrive at the cathedral in Santiago de Compostella is really well done, and really captures a sense of awe and wonder. Among the interesting conversations on the road, one has a subtle pro-life message as a woman wonders about her unborn baby. Some elements raise questions of suitability for young viewers - in particular there's an ambiguous attitude to soft drugs, but I think it will give mature viewers a warm glow, Many films deal with journeys (physical and metaphorical) of self discovery but The Way has carved out a distinctive little niche of its own.\n\nIn the last few days I've been showing parts of the film Sophie Scholl, The Final Days, with 3rd Year students. (Sophie Scholl was a real life character who campaigned against the Nazis in Germany - she was arrested for leafletting). It fits in really well with the morality element of the course. I even used the clip on left as past of my assessment with the TY students. This clip is the final interrogation of Sophie, and the script is based on transcripts of the original interrogation. One could get several classes out of this ten-minute clip - issues raised include conscience, the state and religion, empathy, world view, persecution of the Jews and the mentally ill, and God. Sophie is a great role model for young people, but even the interrogator is an interesting character. I was glad to see the third years absorbed by this, as there's a lot of talk, and it's subtitled.\n\n6/2/11\n\nI finally got to see the film Of Gods and Men (Des Hommes et Des Dieux) , still drawing crowds at the Lighthouse Cinema in Smithfield, Dublin. This tells the true story of a group of Cistercian monks under threat from Islamist terrorists in Algeria. It's a slow moving drama but well worth the effort to stay with it. Rarely have I seen a film with such depth of faith and respect for its subject. It's not in the least bit preachy or sentimental, but treats the deepest of religious themes in an accessible but challenging way. Unless you know the historical background very well it's entirely unpredictable - I couldn't help thinking at various stages that Hollywood would treat it so differently, but thankfully it avoids clichés and stereotypes.\n\nThe characters of the monks is what appeals most as they try to serve the local Muslim population with respect and compassion. The increasing terrorist violence in the areas puts them on edge as they grapple with internal and external conflicts, agonising over whether they should stay and risk all or leave to save themselves.\n\nI couldn't see myself showing the whole film in class, because it's so slow moving and so much requiring maturity in the viewer (there's also a rather graphic killing), but there are several scenes that might work well. For example, the scene where they get their first visit from the terrorists is particular striking and tense, and features an unusual bit of impromptu inter-faith dialogue! Later the monks sing together (as they do regularly in the film) in an act of solidarity as a military helicopter hovers menacingly overhead. A scene where they finally decide what to do is also of interest, while near the end there's a touching letter from one of the monks about the relationships between Christians and Muslims. Several scenes show the monks in intense moments of prayer.\n\nWhat remained with me most was the individuals and their relationships - the character of each monk is portrayed beautifully, and the film stands as a tribute to their human dignity, cameraderie, courage and faith.\n\nThe film has been held over at the Lighthouse much longer than expected due to public demand - significant that a challenging film with religion so central should develop such a following.\n\n3/10/10\n\nWatched the film Raising Helen last night and was surprised by how positive it was towards religion and how warm towards people and good values. Kate Hudson is excellent as Helen, a swinging party girl who must grow up fast when she has to raise her sister's children when the sister dies. At one stage she prays that God will find her a good school for the children and immediately passes a Lutheran faith school - \"That was quick\" she says/prays. There's a very funny scene where she pretends to the pastor (she calls him \"Father Pastor\") that they are all Lutherans. The Pastor jokes that they will have to have a blood test to prove it, but Helen doesn't get the irony and says the kids can have no blood tests, on medical grounds. Later, when the pastor asks her out on a date, she feels terrible that she may have lead him away from God and his vows of celibacy - he explains that clerical celibacy is not an issue for Lutherans!\n\n8/9/10\n\nOh well, back to school over a week now and exhausted. Surprised to see how long it is since I added to the blog.\n\nStarting off again with a review of the film Karol, A Man Who Became Pope, shown on RTE 1 last Saturday. There's lots in it that will be useful for RE class, and the follow up film is coming up this Saturday afternoon. The first film takes the story from the German invasion of Poland to Karol becoming Pope. The central performance by Piotr Adamczyk is excellent - thoughtful, convincing, often moving. Also impressive are Malgorzata Bella as Hanna, a possible love interest for young student Karol, and Raoul Bova as Fr Tomasz, a young priest and close friend of Karol. Any scenes with any one or more of these three are intense and involving. In fact it is in some of the set piece scenes that the film excels most. There's one that's fraught with tension as Fr Tomasz is \"invited\" to hear the confession of one particularly nasty Nazi, but storms out from the dinner table after delivering a brave rebuke to the Germans present over their treatment of Jews and their children in particular. Great scene for illustrating themes like injustice and prejudice. All scenes between Karol and Hanna are so credible, a lovely portrayal of friendship and blossoming romantic love. The tensions between them, over how to react to the German occupation (words or guns - useful moral dilemmas here) and his growing discovery of his vocation (see clip above), are sensitively but realistically handled. You can feel Karol's sense of mission, but also Hanna's sense of loss. In fact the way his vocation is handled is so well done that the relevant scenes would be very useful for covering the theme of vocation in class.\n\nScenes of the Nazi cruelty and the persecution of the Jews are strong and affecting. It could hardly be otherwise I suppose. After the World War 2 scenes there's much more talk as the fortunes of the Church and Polish culture are at the mercy of the godless communism of the Russians and their puppet rulers, but this part is affecting too, with some strong emotional moments, especially the forgiveness of a spy - very useful scenes for Confession and forgiveness. I thought the film was less successful when the talk was less concerned with interpersonal issues and more concerned with politics and theology. It's not that I'm faulting the theology, but at times the film was a tad preachy, trying to get important points across with lumps of theology and morality that didn't flow as easily as dialogue should.\n\nIf you missed it, it's available for less than a fiver at amazon.co.uk, and is available in segmented form on YouTube.\n\n17/6/10\n\nSaw the film Premonition on RTE 1 last night. Sandra Bullock played a married woman who has premonitions of her husband's death. It was quite a rivetting thriller with all sorts of timeshifting twists and turns. It raised some interesting issues about love, relationships and what's important in life. At one stage the Bullock character visits a priest to get some guidance - it's an intersting exchange, about two thirds of the way through. He suggests that faithless people leave a vacuum in their lives that other forces may then occupy, and that it's important to know what's really important in your life and to fight for that.\n\n29/3/10\n\nLast Friday to celebrate the school holidays I got to the cinema to see The Blind Side - the film that won a Best Actress award this year for Sandra Bullock. It tells the true story of a black teenager, uniquely skilled at American football, adopted into a white family. It was moving, uplifting and absorbing, though overlong and certainly sentimental.\n\nThere's a faith dimension, but it's not too preachy. Bullock does a great job playing the mother of the adoptive family, a gutsy Christian woman who opens her home to the homeless boy, who is enrolled into a private Christian college. When the authorities there are reluctant, considering the boy's background, one character suggests that the word \"Christian\" on the school's sign should be painted over or taken seriously. A challenge to all our Christian schools.\n\nThemes of racism and family conflict are touched on subtly, but there are no huge conflicts. This makes the film less intense, but more gentle, and it's certainly imbued with a respect and love for its characters - at the end we get to see footage of the real life characters the film is based on.\n\nThis family is certainly well off (huge house!), and while their material wealth isn't questioned there is an empathy for those who are poorer, e.g. in Bullock's visit to the boy's birth mother.\n\nMaybe I'd like it to have been a little rougher around the edges. Is the family too sweet to be wholesome? Perhaps, but it was good for a change not to have the family members having clichéd rows just for dramatic effect. It was certainly believable.\n\n26/2/10\n\nOn Monday last I got to see the Irish Premier of the film Lourdes, shown as part of the Jameson Dublin International Film Festival. It tells the story of a young woman, almost paralysed with MS, who visits Lourdes with a pilgrimage group, helped by Order of Malta volunteers.\n\nIt's a hard one to review as I have conflicted feelings about it. It certainly held the attention throughout its ninety or so minutes, even though for much of it there was nothing dramatic going on. I found it completely unpredictable, which helped, and I suppose because it was subtitled I had to concentrate all the more. The characters were ordinary, but still interesting. Sylvie Testud as the main character Christine was superb - the whole thing might have collapsed without such an intriguing performance. She managed to capture a whole range of emotions - sadness, anger, enthusiasm, loneliness - and yet there were times she was inscrutable.\n\nThe location work at Lourdes captured the atmosphere really well, in fact at times it had a documentary feel to it. But it was difficult to figure out what the viewpoint of the film was. Yes there were possible miracles, lots of prayer and devotion, and the main character, despite her suffering was at least open to faith. But ultimately it seemed like an agnostic's view of the Lourdes experience (and here I'm not making any assumptions about writer-director Jessica Haussner, except that she's highly talented). I felt the film lacked warmth towards faith, and I didn't feel any sense of relationship with Our Lady or Jesus. It's as if Haussner was saying: here's what might happen on an average pilgrimage to Lourdes - what do you make of it?\n\nAnd yet it wasn't entirely objective or dispassionate. There was a quiet empathy with the invalids, especially as so many little cruelties were shown to them - e.g. when Cécile, the chief nurse announces that there will be an outing next day, but that those in wheelchairs would have to stay behind. The carers do their job, often with a smile, but too often they are more interested in flirting with each other - believable but unsettling. \"We are not here to have fun\", says the irritating chief nurse, and sure enough there is little enough of it. Everything is just a bit too slow moving and uninspiring.\n\nThe pilgrimage chaplain is a very average priest, mostly OK with the pilgrims, but his answers to their deep questions smack too much of platitude. The other pilgrims are a mixed bunch, from devotional to cynical. The chief nurse is all smiles and efficiency, not too likeable, but then she is shown to have her own suffering. The chief Order of Malta man attracts the eyes of all the ladies, including the main character, but he too, ultimately, seems hollow.\n\nTalking to some people after the film confirmed what I suspected, that people will have wildly different assessments of the film. Maybe this lack of a clear stance will charm some and disconcert others, but while I did find it riveting, sometimes funny, and even quite hopeful at times, I thought the final impression it left was on the bleak side.\n\nFor that reason I wouldn't be rushing to show it in school, though there was one interesting Confession scene with the main character and the chaplain, where she calmly confesses her anger. I like collecting Confession scenes from film and TV drama, and this will be a worthy addition.\n\n17/2/10\n\nLast night I got a chance to see one of the first Irish screenings of a new feature film about the appearances of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nThe 13th Day was written and directed by Ian and Dominic Higgins. It's great to see Catholic filmmakers turning their talents to spiritual matters in such a creative and imaginative way. Visually the film is a treat - it's not surprising that the Higgins brothers come from an artistic background. Each frame of the film would make for a beautiful still picture - mostly it's black and white, with colour being used when Our Lady appears and Heaven touches the earth. Watching it I was reminded of arty YouTube videos, European cinema, and even The Blair Witch Project (visual effect not content!).\n\nIt was almost surreal in its presentation, which made it quite captivating at times. The film seems to tell the Fatima story faithfully, framing it by using the reminiscences of Sr Lucia as she writes her memoirs. For me the telling of the story was somewhat episodic, always a potential problem when filming real life events. I also felt there was too much narration and not enough dialogue given to the actors which made it difficult for them to really inhabit their roles. That being said the girl who played the young Lucia, Filipa Fernandez, had a striking screen presence, crucial when she was the central personality of the film.\n\nOne thing the filmmakers have achieved is to present this timeless story to a modern audience in an idiom they can understand and relate to. I didn't find it corny or preachy or sentimental, and these are also traps that a religious film can fall into.\n\nAs always I wondered about its use in Religious Education. There would have to be plenty of discussion afterwards, and the teacher would want to be well informed about the background to the Fatima story. The vision of hell and one rather scary angel make it more suitable for secondary students. For teachers who might like to use just an extract, the scene of the miracle of the sun is quite striking and captures the essence of the film. At the time of writing The 13th Day is available only on Region 1 DVD (USA).\n\n5/1/09\n\nWith constant repeats on RTE and Channel 4 one can get overdosed on the Simpsons, but to be fair it takes a lot of repeating to drain the humour out of it. Last weekend both channels showed The Simpsons Movie, and like a lot of comedy shows transferring to the big screen it was a questionable exercise - yes, the movie was funny, but it didn't offer much more than a typical bunch of episodes shown back to back. As always there was an amount of religious content - and while you might welcome films that show religion as a common part of life (airbrushed out of most American shows) you'd smart at the sharp barbs thrown at believers. The story began on a Sunday morning with Homer once again grumbling about going to church - why, he says, can't he be allowed worship God in his own way - \"like praying like hell on my death bed\". He grouches about Rev Lovejoy's congregation, \"pious morons\" with their \"phoney baloney God\". Grandpa Simpson starts speaking in tongues about some apocalyptic event, and wouldn't you know, it was to be an environmental disaster. The show often pokes fun at those believers who are big into \"the end times\". There was one hilarious scene when the end of the world was nigh (yet again) - the believers abandoned the church and headed for the bar, while the drinkers rushed out of the bar and made for the church. The sign on the church said \"We Told You So\"!\n\nWhile Ned Flanders was presented, as usual, as a Holy Joe, he is also portrayed as the most human and caring of the Springfield folks - providing such a stable father figure that Bart wants him as father instead, but only for a while of course. Yes, its mildly crude and borderline irreverent, but its definitely funny, and even thought provoking. And suitably for the time that's in it, it gave an outing to the idea of \"epiphany\" - Homer must get a deep insight into his selfishness or he won't be able to save Springfield and win his family back. And was there every any doubt about the outcome?\n\n30/12/09\n\nGot to have another look at the film Millions on DVD last night. It's a film by Danny Boyle of Slumdog Millionaire fame and features a young boy who's a moral anchor for those close to him who compromise so easily. He tries so hard to be good, and is fascinated by the stories of the saints, many of whom appear to him, complete with halos, in little vignettes through the film. A big bag of money, the proceeds of a train robbery, comes his way - he thinks it's a gift from God and wants to use it responsibly, but finds it so hard just to give it to the poor. It's a sweet film, but not overly sentimental, and it's imbued with a warm attitude to religious faith. The scenes with the saints are particularly clever and amusing. It's not for very young children as there is some menace, complex moral issues and a one-night stand (with possibilities for the future!) between the widowed father and a charity worker.\n\n11/12/09\n\nRecently I got to see the Irish premiere of a multi-award winning documentary The Human Experience.

Some of the film makers were present at the screening which was a treat. I asked about the DVD release but was told it would be a while yet as they were working on distribution arrangements. For the moment check out the film's website, and watch the trailer above.\n\n3/11/09\n\nI know it's unseasonal, but last night I got to attend the multimedia screening of A Christmas Carol - this is Robert Zemeckis' new film adaptation of the Dickens story for Disney, and what a treat it is! Those who have seen his Polar Express will be familiar with the kind of animation applied here - a technique of motion capture that has the characters looking incredibly like the actors that do their voices. The effect here is immeasurably heightened b"
