        "text": "The object of this paper is to clarify what \" intercultural competence \" actually entails for those learning to translate at university level, and will refer to a number of classroom activities that can successfully support the trainees during the learning. Competencies have been studied with regard to learning, and have recently been amplified through the 'Dublin Descriptors' as a result of university reform. Also, intercultural competencies have been studied widely in the world of work. Yet, though the same competencies are now deemed essential for translators there is little information on the sub-competencies involved. Here, it is suggested that in the university first cycle, the cognitive learning competencies could include first an understanding of self and other (cultural locatedness), then translation of culture-bound terms with a clear denotative reference, followed by connotative terms (linguaculture). At this level, students would also learn how to apply relatively fixed communication patterns, having learned about preferred cultural writing styles and orientations. It is argued that it is only at the second level that students are more ready for \" self reflexive \" thinking. At this level they can more easily understand that text meaning (and style) is negotiable according to context. Here, students also become more competent in the metacognitive learning styles, and are more able to mindshift, to change perceptual position and mediate. This will only be fully possible, however, when they are able to move away from the search for text-bound formal equivalence and learn to take risks (low uncertainty avoidance). It is asserted here that, to a large extent, this, and the other competencies discussed, can be taught as part of translator training."
