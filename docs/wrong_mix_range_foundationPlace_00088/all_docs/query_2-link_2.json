Features Application Transparent Data-at-Rest Security with Storage Virtualization High performance and intelligent storage virtualization technology delivers security processing of data-at-rest based on data-owner-defined security rules and policies. No user training is required. Data protected is secured on-the-fly requiring no change on user workflow and application logic. Hardware, Platform and Filesystem Independent Bloombase StoreSafe supports all platforms conforming to standards-based storage networking protocols and it operates on the storage networking layer abstracting filesystem underneath and software applications above. High Performance Leveraging Intel AES-NI and various other third-party hardware cryptographic acceleration technologies to minimize performance degradation as a result of latency with real-time encryption and decryption, pushing encryption speed to the limits meeting throughput-computing needs. Flexible and Secure Access Control Fine grain user and host access control suiting all enterprise storage security needs. High Availability Highly scalable and multiple Bloombase StoreSafe software appliances running in cluster for failover in mission- critical systems and load-balancing for high-throughput storage applications.
