Hereâ€™s what she had to say...\n\nI feel like I am fulfilling my purpose when I am:\n\nUtilizing the gifts that I have been given. Thus, why it is so important to understand your gifts as you move through experiences like AWL.\n\nTo me, leadership is:\n\nThe ability to take someone physically or emotionally on your journey to the destination that you are working to reach. As a leader you have to be able to adapt how you take someone there. For some I have to serve, for some I have to show, for some I need to listen, and for others I need to teach. Each is an important action of leading others."
