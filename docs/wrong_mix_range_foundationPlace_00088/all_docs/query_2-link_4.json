Product overview Bloombase StoreSafe Intelligent Storage Firewall Bloombase StoreSafe Intelligent Storage Firewall delivers storage security no matter where and how your data is stored and structured. Using artificial intelligence (AI), the Bloombase StoreSafe Intelligent Storage Firewall proactively identifies sophisticated attacks on the storage network layer and automatically stops threats in real time, providing actionable countermeasures and remediation to keep you ahead of exfiltration vulnerabilities and prevent breach. Leveraging advanced purpose-built machine learning (ML) capabilities, Bloombase StoreSafe provides accurate detection, classification, and automated protection of sensitive data for prioritized protection of crown-jewels to help ensure compliance without needing manual intervention. Without needing to modify client software applications or retrofit storage systems with encryption hardware, Bloombase StoreSafe operates almost like a storage proxy to deliver OS-agnostic, platform-portable, NIST FIPS–validated encryption services via storage protocols such as NVMe-oF, NVMe/RoCE, NVMe/TCP, VirtIO, FCP, iSCSI, NFS, SMB, CIFS, S3, and REST, for heterogeneous storage technologies from on-premises disk arrays, hypervisor datastores, composable storage infrastructure, to off-premises cloud storage services. The Bloombase StoreSafe Intelligent Storage Firewall has been pretested and validated to run on HPE ProLiant servers to enable organizations of all sizes to lock down business-critical data‑at‑rest on standards-based storage systems using post‑quantum cryptography (PQC) encryption at unrivaled speed and scale, helping customers mitigate data leakage threats, meet data privacy regulatory compliance requirements, and give peace of mind regarding data protection.
