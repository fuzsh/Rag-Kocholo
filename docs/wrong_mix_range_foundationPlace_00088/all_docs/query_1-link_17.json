        "text": "If you're interested in #AI for networking or networking for #AI, Bob Laliberte and I conducted a survey on the impact of AI on Networking. The study was a collaborative effort between ZK Research and #TheCube Research. We talked about the key findings in the study, motivations for buying, key challenges and a whole lot more! It's well worth the watch! If you want to learn more, ping me or Bob! SiliconANGLE & theCUBE https://lnkd.in/gN6f-VSh\n\nEarlier this month Matt Wood delivered an excellent keynote at #AWSSummit in New York. Here are my 5 key thoughts from it 1-#GenAI and machine learning are already a big business for AWS 2-Amazon Web Services (AWS) is committed to continuous #AI innovation 3-AWS has become the place to be for organizations that are on the cutting edge of AI innovation 4-AWS is serious about security ‚Äî and so are its customers 5-AWS is fully committed to #sustainability You can read the post on SiliconANGLE & theCUBE Peter Lo, Katharine Kemp https://lnkd.in/ggmexjPe\n\nHad a great time last week at the Major League Baseball (MLB) #AllStarGame and #HomeRunDerby. The highlight? The excellent #CIO discussions with Extreme Networks Fantastic ‚ÄúTouchless Technology‚Äù panel with Dr. Michael Cunningham of the Philadelphia Phillies, Scott Waid with the Atlanta Braves, and Rob Bence with Tepper Sports & Entertainment Excellent #wifi and #AI presentations from David Coleman and Markus Nispel At Globe Life Field I experienced touchless tech like Go Ahead Entry and Amazon Just Walk Out Nice spending time with Jake Power, Jimmy Serrano, Ryan T. Hall and others Saw a Zoom replay but missed Gary Sorrentino but did run into Bryan Bedford Enjoyed spending time with Kris Peralta of the San Diego Padres and I owe you and Ray Chan a visit to PETCO Park Monica Kumar, Amy Aylward, Blair Donald üåà, Renny Monaghan #AdvanceWithUs\n\nThis week at the Major League Baseball (MLB), I got to experience \"Go Ahead Entry\" for the first time at Globe Life Field, home of the Texas Rangers Baseball Club. This is MLB's entry system that is based on facial recognition. A few points worth noting: -Enrolling was fast and easy, taking under 30 seconds -The feature is in the Ballpark App, so there's no third-party sign-up required and app syncing, as is the case with Clear -The service is fast; check out the video below. You can walk through at normal speed, it knows how many tickets you have and all can enter. If you're at Globe Life, Citizens Bank Park (home of the Philadelphia Phillies), Oracle Park (home of the San Francisco Giants) or soon other parks, check it out and try it! Touchless technology was a big part of the #CIO sessions at the #AllStarGame and MLB did this right! David Hochman, Neil Boland, Bill Schlough, Ken Logan, Dr. Michael Cunningham, Matthew B. Ryan T. Hall, Jake Power, Jimmy Serrano, Extreme Networks, Brandon Lea"
