        "text": "Bloombase StoreSafe provides customers with turnkey data-at-rest encryption security to help meet GDPR\n\nRedwood City, CA /PRNewswire/ - Bloombase, the next-generation data security company, today announced StoreSafe is available to customers of VMware Cloud™ on AWS. VMware Cloud on AWS brings together VMware's enterprise-class Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) software and elastic, bare-metal infrastructure from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to give organizations consistent operating model and application mobility for private and public cloud.\n\nBloombase StoreSafe is an agentless, turnkey, application-transparent, high performance unified stored data encryption solution with non-disruptive deployment (protocol preserving, no operational change to application infrastructure nor daily operations). Unlike traditional data encryption tools which require hardware retrofitting and expensive software upgrades, Bloombase data-at-rest security solution requires no proprietary hardware. It is portable, OS agnostic and can be used across multiple datacenter technologies. Bloombase StoreSafe operates as a holistic encryption virtual appliance with an expansive reach over heterogeneous network storage protocols for on-premises VMware vSphere and off-premises VMware Cloud on AWS. The solution works as a storage proxy for trusted hosts in forms of virtual machines (VM) providing encryption as they write, and unencrypting as they read. Leveraging Amazon CloudHSM for centralized key management, not only the Bloombase solution secures vSAN-backed datastores, but also cloud storage services including Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Block Store (EBS). Bloombase's software-defined architecture is future-proofed to meet infrastructure changes through scalability and flexibility to deliver secure data services for hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), private and public cloud. As an independent add-on software, Bloombase delivers security integrity and helps maintain true separation of duties, enabling organizations to meet GDPR and various other regulatory compliance mandates immediately and cost-effectively.\n\n\"Organizational customers are seeking total data security solutions that are open in standard, turnkey, and embrace true value-added technology for longevity,\" said Sean Xiang, CEO at Bloombase. \"The Bloombase storage security solution for VMware Cloud on AWS addresses intensifying cyberattack challenges and supports evolving data center transformations.\"\n\nVMware Cloud on AWS technology partners enable customers to deploy the same proven solutions seamlessly in both the public and private cloud. VMware simplifies the deployment and eliminates the need for partners to refactor solutions for VMware Cloud on AWS. If a partner solution works on-premises in a VMware vSphere® environment, it will easily support VMware Cloud on AWS. VMware technology partners complement and enhance native VMware Cloud on AWS service and enable customers to realize new capabilities.\n\n\"VMware Cloud on AWS provides customers a seamlessly integrated hybrid cloud offering that gives customers the SDDC experience from the leader in private cloud, running on the leading public cloud provider, AWS,\" said Kristen Edwards, director, Technology Alliance Partner Program, VMware. \"Solutions such as Bloombase StoreSafe enable IT teams to reduce cost, increase efficiency, and create operational consistency across cloud environments. We're excited to work with partners such as Bloombase to enhance native VMware Cloud on AWS capabilities and empower customers with flexibility and choice in solutions that can drive business value.\"\n\nFor more information of the validated Bloombase solution for VMware Cloud on AWS, please visit the VMware Solution Exchange Marketplace at https://marketplace.vmware.com/vsx/solutions/bloombase-storesafe-security-server\n\nAbout VMware Cloud on AWS\n\nDelivered, sold and supported by VMware and its channel partners as an on-demand service, and running on elastic, bare-metal AWS infrastructure, VMware Cloud on AWS is powered by VMware Cloud Foundation™, the unified SDDC platform that integrates vSphere, VMware vSAN™ and VMware NSX® virtualization technologies. With the same architecture and operational experience on-premises and in the cloud, IT teams can quickly derive business value from use of the AWS and VMware hybrid cloud experience.
