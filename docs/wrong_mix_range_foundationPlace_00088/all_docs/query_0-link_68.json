        "text": "The object of this paper is to clarify what \" intercultural competence \" actually entails for those learning to translate at university level, and will refer to a number of classroom activities that can successfully support the trainees during the learning. Competencies have been studied with regard to learning, and have recently been amplified through the 'Dublin Descriptors' as a result of university reform. Also, intercultural competencies have been studied widely in the world of work. Yet, though the same competencies are now deemed essential for translators there is little information on the sub-competencies involved. Here, it is suggested that in the university first cycle, the cognitive learning competencies could include first an understanding of self and other (cultural locatedness), then translation of culture-bound terms with a clear denotative reference, followed by connotative terms (linguaculture). At this level, students would also learn how to apply relatively fixed communication patterns, having learned about preferred cultural writing styles and orientations. It is argued that it is only at the second level that students are more ready for \" self reflexive \" thinking. At this level they can more easily understand that text meaning (and style) is negotiable according to context. Here, students also become more competent in the metacognitive learning styles, and are more able to mindshift, to change perceptual position and mediate. This will only be fully possible, however, when they are able to move away from the search for text-bound formal equivalence and learn to take risks (low uncertainty avoidance). It is asserted here that, to a large extent, this, and the other competencies discussed, can be taught as part of translator training.\n\nAny regular translator is generally considered bilingual, if not trilingual or polyglot; and trying to learn about their more-than-one language acquisition will certainly lead us to dealing with imitation: the most important process of skill-learning. As it is widely believed, more improved linguistic skills and further general knowledge – two main qualifications of a good translator – can only result from reading, practice, and experience. It is clear that both linguistic skills and general knowledge represent an input process, and reading, practice, and experience represent different sources for such inputs. This can explain how cognition and learning are tightly connected. This makes me believe that most human learning – mainly language skills– is based on intertextuality since it is itself based on imitation. In this paper, I will try to give the concept of intertextuality a further cognitive dimension rather than being merely related to literary criticism. This cognitive process is essential in the translation process and plays a crucial role in sharpening the translator’s skills when they take more care of the quality of their textual and informational sources in both source and target languages: the better books and texts they read, the better linguistic –mainly writing– skills and more general knowledge they acquire. This will obviously help with improving the quality of their translation -be it literary or scientific. The idea of giving such importance to intertextuality and taking advantage of it in translation stems basically from the assumption that translating is rewriting; subsequently, any kind of writing or rewriting is tightly related to the concept of intertextuality. Eventually, one question that must be posed here is whether translators, being students, teachers, or professionals, are even aware of this cognitive phenomenon so that they can develop a sensible and sensitive imitating skill which might make their reproduction read like a masterpiece rather than a literal translation. Kew words: Translation – Cognition – Intertextuality – Reading & Writing – Rewriting – Knowledge – Learning – Linguistic Skills.\n\nTranslation Studies and the teaching of translation have been well established for a long time. Recently, however, university departments training future translators have become aware of the fact that academia, and what almost obsessively has been referred to as 'the real world', need to be brought together far more closely than has been the case until a recent past. This has entailed the development of new and more flexible syllabuses. For example, establishing close links with professional translators. Also employing new teaching techniques that may clarify the cognitive processes that take place while a source text is converted into a target one. A concomitant result of the desire to create fully qualified translators has also been a greater awareness that employability is the ultimate aim of the training that takes place in the classroom.\n\nWith the superdiversity (Blommaert 2010, 2013) of today’s societies translator training faces new challenges. This article sets out to explore the issue of intercultural competence in translator training from the perspective of the views and beliefs of English language majors in Poland. Rather than discussing the translation programmes offered to students, the study presented here concentrates on preconceptions as to who a translator is, what skills, knowledge and competences are crucial for a translator and what difficulties s/he may face. Students’ beliefs prove that they are ready for courses which will encourage them to reflect on their views and will help them deepen their understanding of culture to include intercultural aspects as well as aspects of their own culture. As Polish students wanting to be translators may simply not be aware of the intercultural challenges entailed by the profession, it is argued here that overt, explicit focus on intercultural communication and ra..."
