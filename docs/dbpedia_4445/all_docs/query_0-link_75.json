        "text": "For many beer drinkers in Texas and beyond, there’s nothing finer than an ice-cold Shiner. And in recent years, the definition of what a Shiner is has grown a great deal.\n\nThe iconic Shiner Bock with a yellow label from Spoetzl Brewery is no longer the only offering. But the famous Texas brewery’s newest beer offers a look back to even before their signature beer was born.\n\nShiner 1909 Heritage Lager, named after the year in which the 112-year-old brewery opened in Shiner, Texas, incorporates the ingredients originally used by the founding group of German and Czech settlers. It’s worth noting here that the famed, malty signature brew of today, Shiner Bock, wasn’t first developed until 1913, when Kosmos Spoetzl joined the team at the then-named Shiner Brewing Association. The new beer is brewed with Heritage two-row barley, Noble hops and a proprietary lager yeast.\n\nRelated:Cheers! Yuengling is on sale at nearly 40,000 Texas bars, grocery stores and gas stations\n\nAlthough plenty of Shiner’s offerings have featured ingredients as wide-ranging as peach, ginger, grapefruit, lime, sea salt and even Texas dewberries, Shiner 1909 will yield a flavor more similar to the bock. A statement from the brewery says the beer is “a light-bodied lager with a toasty aroma, rich malt flavor and a crisp, refreshing finish.”\n\nSounds like it might go really well with a returning favorite from another beloved Lone Star institution, Whataburger’s Hatch Green Chile Bacon Burger.\n\nShiner 1909 Heritage Lager comes with a 4.5% ABV, just a touch above Shiner Bock’s 4.4% ABV, and will be available year-round in bottled six-packs and 12-packs."
