        "text": "The Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas, in 1909 by Kosmos Spoetzl. Born in Bavaria, his passion for beer carried him as far as Egypt before arriving in tiny Shiner. There, he purchased the town’s brewery and became Shiner’s first official brewmaster, a post that he held for nearly half a century.\n\nToday’s Spoetzl Brewery is a far cry from the old tin shed where Shiner first flowed back in 1909. We think our founder, Kosmos Spoetzl, would probably be amazed at our state-of-the art Brew House. He’d also be happy to know we still brew every drop of Shiner right here in Shiner, Texas. We continue to honor the man with every beer that comes out of the brewery bearing his name. Prosit!\n\nSpoetzl remains an independent brewery with a passion for handcrafting fine beers. When we first started brewing back in 1909, it was to create Old World-influenced beers for our family and friends. We’ve never lost that independent attitude and love for making unique, highly drinkable beers. We just have a lot more family and friends now.\n\nStop in for a tour and the first round is on us. And the second.\n\nFor more on the brewery, its history, and its beers, visit the website shiner.com.\n\nKettles as part of the tour at the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, Texas"
