        "text": "HOUSTON – Welcome to Made in Texas, where we write about products made in the Lone Star State.\n\nToday, we’re featuring the only Texas beer that has been around for 108 years, Shiner.\n\nThe product\n\nShiner is an award-winning Texas craft beer that comes inside a twist-off bottle.\n\nThe beer comes in many different styles including Bock, Light Blonde, Rudy Redbird, Weisse 'N' Easy, Black Lager, Premium and Wicked Juicy IPA. The adult beverage also offers a seasonal flavor named Prickly Pear.\n\nCurrent brewmaster Jimmy Mauric shared his expertise in pairing a Shiner. He says the original tastes good with barbecue, a black lager can be paired with a dessert and its Shiner light blondes go well with a hamburger.\n\nThe founder\n\nFounder Kosmos Spoetzl, born in Bavaria, Germany, arrived to Shiner, also know as the cleanest little city in the Lone Star State, where he purchased the town’s brewery and became the first official brewmaster, according to the company’s website.\n\nThe story behind Shiner beer\n\nShiner beer is brewed at the Spoetzl Brewery in a tiny Texas town named Shiner, which has a population of 2,069 residents.\n\nThe independent brewery was founded in 1909 to create old world-influenced beers to share with family and friends.\n\nThe beer’s popularity grew in the 1970′s when it expanded to the state’s capital.\n\nToday, Shiner beer distributes over six million cases a year to 49 states across the country."
