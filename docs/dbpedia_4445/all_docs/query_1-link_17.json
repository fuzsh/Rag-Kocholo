        "text": "Spoetzl Brewery takes home five medals at the Australian International Beer Awards\n\nMELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA – The Spoetzl Brewery, an independent Texas craft brewery in operation since 1909, garnered significant attention at the Australian International Beer Awards (AIBA). Five beers – Shiner Light Blonde, Shiner Bock, Shiner Ruby Redbird, Shiner Sea Salt and Lime, and Shiner 1909 beers took home honors at the event:\n\nShiner Light Blonde: Gold (Low Carb Lager)\n\nShiner Bock: Silver (Best Amber/ Dark Lager)\n\nShiner Sea Salt and Lime: Silver (Best Fruit Beer)\n\nShiner 1909: Silver (American Style Lager)\n\nShiner Ruby Redbird: Bronze (Best Fruit Beer)\n\nThe results mark a continuation of both domestic and international industry recognition for the brewery’s new launches and adds to the winning tradition of established Shiner brands.\n\n“It’s great that the international community has recognized that we make pretty darn good beer in our little corner of Texas,” says Jimmy Mauric, head brewmaster of Shiner Beer’s Spoetzl Brewery. “Our beers reflect the team’s passionate hard work, curiosity in the craft, and industry-leading quality standards.”\n\nIn its gold medal review, the AIBA described Light Blonde as a very pleasant lager, characterful with good appearance and lively to style with a buttery mouthfeel.\n\nAbout Australian International Beer Awards\n\nThe AIBA is the world’s largest annual beer competition judging both packaged and draught beer.\n\nIt is conducted by The Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria (RASV), who also conduct the Australian Distilled Spirits Awards and Royal Melbourne Wine Awards. Around 50 industry experts assessed approximately 2600 entries across four days in May, with beers received from Australia and around the world.\n\nAbout Shiner Beers and the Spoetzl Brewery"
