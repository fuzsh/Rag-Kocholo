        "text": "SHINER, Texas— The Spoetzl Brewery, the family-owned and independent craft brewer of the iconic Shiner Bock, announces its extensive new onsite sustainability initiatives. With a dedicated mission to care for the environment and surrounding communities, the brewery now implements new sustainable systems including solar-powered energy, updated waste reduction procedures and effective recycling processes.\n\nWith sustainable energy on the rise, The Spoetzl Brewery now features solar panels to the brewery to reduce waste and produce cleaner energy. The solar panels generate over 2.0 megawatts of electricity, powering 30% of the brewer’s electrical requirements. In addition to solar energy, the brewery also uses skylights and super-efficient LED lights to further reduce electricity use.\n\n“At the Spoetzl Brewery, we’re committed to investing in renewable energy initiatives and to minimizing our carbon footprint”, says Tom Fiorenzi, Shiner’s Director of Brewery & Distillery Operations. “We’re proud to have the largest solar array on a Texas brewery and are hopeful that other breweries and businesses will follow in our footsteps.”\n\nIn addition to adding solar panels, the brewery enforces procedures to reduce waste. To date, the brewery recycles 98% of its waste. To further reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, 200 tons of paper and over 300 tons of glass are recycled each year. The Spoetzl brewery also transfers exhaust from brew kettles to a hot water system that supplies heat for wort preheating, cleaning systems and offices throughout the brewery.\n\nWith the new conservation efforts and procedures, the Spoetzl Brewery is focused on helping the surrounding communities and businesses. Each year, over 13,000 tons of spent grain is sent to local farmers as a source of food for animals. The brewery also uses an anaerobic wastewater pretreatment system that collects all the brewery’s processed wastewater. This apparatus generates a biogas that is cleaned, compressed and then used to supply over eight percent of the brewery’s heating needs. Further, over 33 percent of the brewery’s pretreated wastewater is used to grow hay to support local farmers.\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery recently introduced a brand-new onsite BBQ restaurant and a craft spirits distillery with a tour and tastings open to the public. Tours of the Spoetzl Brewery and Distillery are available seven days a week.\n\nFor Brewing fun facts, trivia, movies and more, Click Here.\n\nShiner, TX – Shiner, the independent, family-owned makers of the iconic Shiner Bock, announce a new beer honoring their 112-year history. Shiner 1909 is a small-batch lager brewed with heritage ingredients celebrating the history, endurance, and Texas heritage of the Spoetzl Brewery.\n\nEvery drop of Shiner beer is proudly brewed and bottled in Shiner, Texas at the same brewery founded in 1909 by a group of Czech and German settlers. In 1914, a Bavarian named Kosmos Spoetzl joined the Shiner brewery, finding success using his signature recipe, a combination of old-world Bavarian techniques and his own secret, innovative twist. Kosmos created a legacy with Shiner beers that became a cult classic in Texas and beyond. Today, Shiner Bock is the #1 craft beer in Texas.\n\nInspired by the simple ingredients Shiner’s brewers used in 1909, their founding year, Shiner 1909 is crafted with Heritage 2-row barley, Noble hops, Shiner’s proprietary lager yeast and water from the same artesian well the founders discovered over a century ago. The result is a light-bodied lager with a toasty aroma, rich malt flavor and a crisp, refreshing finish. “We’re so proud to launch Shiner 1909 in celebration of the brewery’s rich history. For 112 years, Shiner has brewed flavorful, refreshing and sessionable beers, becoming a favorite not only of Texans but of beer lovers nationwide. With this new release, we’re paying respect to our past while toasting to the future, and we’re making it available year-round so we’ll all be able to celebrate our birthday every day of the year,” says Matt Pechman, Spoetzl Brewing’s Head of Marketing.\n\nShiner 1909 (4.5% ABV) is available now nationwide and comes in 6 or 12-bottle packs.\n\nAbout Shiner and the Spoetzl Brewery\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas (population 2,069), in 1909, by Czech and German immigrants brewing beer with old-world traditions and recipes for Central Texas. Since then, the brewery has grown to be one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country with beers available in all 50 states and Mexico. To this day, every drop of the award-winning beer is brewed right in Shiner, TX, where it all started 111 years ago.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nhttps://shiner.com/\n\nFun Beer Facts, Breweries and More: Click Here"
