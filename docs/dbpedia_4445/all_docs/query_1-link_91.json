        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Texas native and country music mainstay Aaron Watson announces today his official partnership with Shiner Beer, the independent, family-owned makers of the iconic Shiner Bock. It’s an exciting new collaboration that will bring together two iconic Texas brands.\n\nThis partnership celebrates the recent launch of Shiner Rode0, a new line of non-alcoholic brews featuring three refreshing flavors: Golden Brew, Citrus Wit and Red Amber. As the official sponsor, Shiner Rode0 will be available at all of the remaining tour dates of the 2024 Armadillo Dance Hall Tour in Texas. Come join the fun and follow along for Aaron’s Shiner Rode0 Saturdays featuring Shiner Beer giveaways on his Instagram @aaronwatsonmusic.\n\nThe Armadillo Dance Hall Tour is a family-friendly show featuring fan-favorite hits and infectious melodies. A long-time fan of Shiner and non-alcoholic beer, Watson feels Shiner Rode0 is the perfect sponsor for the tour.\n\n“Nothing says Texas quite like Shiner Bock,” says Watson. “As an independent Texan artist, I’m excited to partner with the oldest independent brewery in Texas. Ever since it was released, Shiner Rode0 is always on my rider! We can’t wait for our fans to try these new non-alcoholic options from the brewery they know and love.”\n\n“We’re proud to be the official sponsor of the 2024 Armadillo Dance Hall Tour, \" says Nick Weiland, Brand Director of Shiner Beer. “Knowing Aaron’s love for Shiner and non-alcoholic beers, we jumped at the opportunity to collaborate.”\n\nAbout Shiner, the K. Spoetzl Brewery, and the K. Spoetzl Distillery:\n\nThe K. Spoetzl Brewery was founded in Shiner, Texas (population 2,127), in 1909,\n\nby Czech and German immigrants brewing beer with old-world traditions and recipes for South Central Texas. Since then, the brewery has grown to be one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country with beers available in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and U.S. military bases around the world. In 2023, the Spoetzl Brewery expanded to include the K. Spoetzl Distillery with its line of Shiner Craft Spirits. To this day, every drop of the award-winning beer is brewed right in Shiner, TX, where it all started 114 years ago.\n\nAbout Aaron Watson\n\nAaron Watson’s career is perhaps summed up best by Forbes, who says he’s “one of country music’s biggest DIY success stories.” For over 20 years, Aaron Watson has traveled the nation as country music’s ultimate underdog troubadour – a truly independent artist with the spirit of the American frontier in his veins, and a self-made empire to match. Working without corporate backers, he has nonetheless reached the Top 10 of Billboard’s Country Album chart five separate times – an impressive feat by any standard. His triumphant 2015 set, The Underdog, landed at #1, becoming the first independent album in the history of country music to top the Billboard Country Albums chart. Matching sold-out shows across the country with homegrown hits, he’s followed suit at country radio, making history in 2017 with “Outta Style” and “Run Wild Horses.” “Watson has made a career out of giving his fans music that focuses on the positive. Music that serves as a salve to what ails them. Music filled with light and joy and an abundance of pride for the country he calls home,” said People of the 2021 American Soul album. With a dozen additional records under his belt, Watson is exceeding major-label-sized metrics while maintaining his independence, further galvanizing his “Texas country's reigning indie underdog” (Rolling Stone) brand. This next chapter of his trailblazing career sees him deep in the weeds working on a 2025 slated album of originals that promises to be his most daring and audacious release to date. Aaron Watson is a man constantly reaffirming his dedication to the craft of songwriting, and it is this commitment to quality and treating his fans with respect that has proven him, time and again, to be the living North Star for country music’s free and indomitable spirit.\n\nArmadillo Dance Hall Tour Dates\n\nJuly 5 - 5D STEAKHOUSE - PORT O'CONNOR, TX\n\nJuly 6 - SCHOEPF'S BBQ - BELTON, TX\n\nJuly 11 - THE RUSTIC - DALLAS, TX\n\nJuly 13 - WYOJAM - SHERRIDAN, WY\n\nJuly 18 - THE RUSTIC - HOUSTON, TX\n\nJuly 19- FLOORE'S COUNTRY STORE - HELOTES, TX\n\nJuly 20 - ON TOUR LIVE - WICHITA FALLS, TX\n\nJuly 24 -OUTLAW SALOON - CHEYENNE, WY\n\nJuly 25 - COUNTRY FAN FEST - TOOELE, UT\n\nJuly 26 - HEADWATERS COUNTRY JAM - CARDWELL, MT\n\nJuly 27 - KNITTING FACTORY - SPOKANE, WA\n\nJuly 28 - KNITTING FACTORY - BOISE, ID\n\nAugust 1 - WAREHOUSE 25 SIXTY FIVE - GRAND JUNCTION, CO\n\nAugust 2 - GRIZZLY ROSE - DENVER, CO\n\nAugust 3 - OTTAWA MEMORIAL AUDITORIUM - OTTAWA, KS\n\nAugust 9 - FLIP FLOPS AND TANK TOPS (@ POTOSI LIVE) - ABILENE, TX\n\nAugust 10 - MARBLE FALLS SUMMER CONCERT SERIES - MARBLE FALLS, TX\n\nAugust 24 - BILLY BOB'S TEXAS - FT.
