        "text": "Shiner Anniversary Beers\n\nIn 2005 Shiner began producing special anniversary beers, a new beer each year leading up to their 100 year anniversary Centennial celebration beer, Shiner 100. Each anniversary beer was labeled with the age of the brewery, so the anniversary beer in 2005 was labeled with a 96 indicating the 96 years of brewery operation up to that point. In 2006 the anniversary beer was labeled a 97, in 2007 a 98, and so on and so forth until the brewery’s centennial celebration. Each anniversary beer was only produced for a limited time, usually less than a year with the exception of the Shiner 100 Commemorator released in 2009 which was in production and on the shelves for the entire year.\n\nA Shiner Tradition\n\nOriginally, Shiner planned to discontinue the annual anniversary beer line after Shiner 100, but because of the positive response from the consumers Shiner decided it would keep the tradition going and produce a new beer every year to celebrate the brewery’s birthday.\n\nThe Shiner Birthday Beer\n\nNow in 2015 Shiner celebrates 106 years of brewing pure awesomeness with the release of a fine chocolate stout dubbed the Shiner 106 Birthday Beer. The 106 Birthday Beer is the Shiner’s first ever stout style beer. The CSTX crew and I were lucky enough to get a taste of the delicious birthday stout a couple of weeks before its release was even announced to the general public… thank you, Shiner; it was a pleasure and an honor. We met with Annie Raabe and Peggy Melton in the brewery’s quality assurance and testing lab. We had planned on asking them some questions about life at the Spoetzl Brewery but and had no idea of the sweet treat we were in for.\n\nBut first, let’s take a look at all of the anniversary beers that led up to the 106."
