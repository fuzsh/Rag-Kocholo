        "text": "This week I decided to try a beer straight out of a small Texas town with only 2,069 residents known as Shiner. Shiner Bock is made in the Spoetzl Brewery which was founded in 1909 by Kosmos Spoetzl. Kosmos and other Czech immigrants founded the brewery because he wanted quality beer that they just couldn’t find in the United States. The brewery is the oldest in Texas and near one of the oldest in the United States. Surprisingly enough the brewery even remained open through the awful time in history known as Prohibition. They stayed afloat in these times by selling ice and what is known as near beer. Near beer contains less than .5% alcohol so it technically cannot be deemed beer. Spoetzl brewery produces 9 beers year round and 4 beers seasonally.\n\nThe current head brewer at Spoetzl is Jimmy Mauric. Mr. Mauric has been working at the brewery since he was 17 years old and was promoted as their 6th head brew master in 2005. He also wears many hats on his day to day job which include things ranging from plant manager to human resources director. The plant has 120 employees which is astoundingly double the amount they had just 5 years ago.\n\nShiner Bock accounts for over 73% of the beer produced at the brewery. Which is for very good reason as I discovered this week after I purchased a 6 pack of it. The beer had a very pleasant aroma that wasn’t overwhelming. It had a sort of sweet caramel and bready taste to it. The color of the beer is very dark. All in all it’s a pretty drinkable beer and a great beer for those interested in begging to drink craft beer since it is a very mellow taste. Feel free to leave feedback and share my blog. Thanks for stopping by again! See you guys next week."
