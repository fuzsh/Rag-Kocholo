        "text": "Laxmi Acharya is not a new name to those who love Nepali folk music especially Deuda songs. Her path to stardom is a captivating story that began in her early years. She was always a vivacious and outgoing individual, driven by an unquenchable passion for singing and dancing. Her playground was the stage of school dance and singing competitions, where the support and encouragement of her teachers played a pivotal role in boosting her self-confidence.\n\nBorn in Tikapur of Kailali on the day of Maghi festival, Acharya believes she was destined to make a career in the music sector. “Perhaps it was the cultural excitement of my birthday that inspired me to become an artist,” she added. Her parents, staunch advocates of her dreams, cultivated an environment where her artistic talents could flourish. Their steadfast support laid the foundation for her future endeavors. After completing her education in Kailali, she set out to explore the world, motivated by her experiences as a scout member and a profound understanding that expanding her horizons was the key to success.\n\nIn 2009, Acharya embarked on a new chapter in the bustling city of Kathmandu with a singular ambition: to pursue a career in music. Her debut song ‘Najik Najik Sarchan’, for which she collaborated with popular singer Ramji Khand, created a perfect launching pad for her in the Nepali musical scene.\n\nAs a native of the far-western region of Nepal, Acharya harbored a deep-seated desire to share its rich cultural tapestry with her country and the world. She wholeheartedly embraced the path of Deuda culture, composing songs steeped in its traditions. With each composition gaining national and international acclaim, she felt an inexorable drive to continue her musical journey.\n\nFollowing the resounding success of her debut song, she released a succession of songs such as ‘Lai Hala Kalo Tika’, ‘Bhana Sali’, ‘Oh Meri Bhauju’, ‘Joi’, ‘Zaraki Man Parayau’, ‘Taruni Vetigai’, ‘Ma Humla ki Chori’, ‘Timro Dilma’, ‘Tin Sal Amerika’, ‘Tero Mero Maya Babali’, ‘Tik Tok ko Raja’, ‘Pauju Bajajhu Ma’ and many more. These compositions were deeply rooted in the language and diction of the far-western region, exuding the essence of local culture and imagery. Listening to these songs transported her back to her hometown while propelling her forward in her artistic pursuits. She knew she still had a long way to go.\n\nWhile accolades and honors serve as affirmations of her talent and dedication, Acharya draws her true strength from the unwavering love and support of her audience. She has been honored with numerous awards, including the Special Contribution Award, Artist Award, Special Contribution Award, Artist Award, 12th National Box Office Film Fair Award, Far Western Artist Award, National Folk Music Artists Association Cassnap Award, Epic Nepal Music Award, Music Khabar Music Award, Far West Sewa Samaj UAE Award, First Chededaha Tourism Award,People's Cultural Federation Award, Nateshwar Music Award, Virat Music and Film Award, 2nd OS Nepal Music Award, Sundara Devi Sandesh Music Award and more and many others. These awards and honors have encouraged Laxmi to dream and achieve big.\n\nHer musical journey has taken her far beyond the confines of her village in Kailali. She has had the privilege of performing Deuda music on international stages in countries such as China, Australia, UAE, Singapore, Thailand, Qatar, Malaysia, and India, among others. Her performances have earned admiration worldwide.\n\nSurviving in the ever-evolving music industry characterized by emerging technologies, social media and growing competition is a challenging ordeal in itself. Nonetheless, Acharya remains steadfast in her dedication to rejuvenating Deuda culture and ushering in a new era. The tranquility and fulfillment of a creative lifestyle sustain her on this challenging path.\n\nReflecting on her journey from Kailali to the bustling capital, she is thankful to her national and global audiences for their support and the opportunities to grace the stage. Acharya believes that music is not just a source of entertainment but also a liberating voice. “It is challenging, especially for women, to achieve success in any field including music. Nonetheless, I believe that if I continue to receive love from all of my audiences, I will be able to spread the light of far-western culture of Nepal worldwide,” she added."
