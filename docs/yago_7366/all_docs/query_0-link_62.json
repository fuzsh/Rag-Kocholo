        "text": "What Marketers Can Learn From ATL’s #TiguanSummer Social Media Campaign\n\nHave you noticed the #tiguansummer hashtag on your timeline lately? It keeps popping up on mine, so I couldn’t help but delving a bit deeper to find out what it’s all about. Many will remember a couple years ago when they did the ATL Group Unbeatable Flash Mobs in Half Way Tree, New Kingston, Ocho...\n\nThe post What Marketers Can Learn From ATL’s #TiguanSummer Social Media Campaign appeared first on Social Media Chica.\n\nThe first two week daily creates…\n\nIn further setting up my blog (using menus and being organized for a change) I am posting these to my blog. I had previously only uploaded these to the individual sites required, such as Flickr, SoundCloud, etc. Here we go! 9/7/14: Tech Confession 9/2/14: My Logo 9/1/14: The Other Side… […]\n\nThe Transit King\n\nDaily create #2! The Lion King was my absolute favorite movie when I was a kid. I would have my mom replay the same scenes, constantly rewinding the VCR. Here’s my transit map!\n\nApp Up and running!\n\nMy app is finally complete or almost complete. All the buttons are functional and each process works. The game works very simple, nothing too fancy. First the user can create their user name which the app uses to address them throughout. Then the user can click the how to play button which will give them […]\n\nThe Kessel Run\n\nThe daily create was to make a map depicting a well-known story, and I went with the Star Wars universe from Episode IV: A New Hope. This is known as “the first one” for folks that remember 1977, the year it was released. Using PowerPoint, I fooled around with the shapes menu and made circles […]\n\nKrups\n\nSeptember 3, 2014. So shiny it hurts. This is a Krups coffee maker on display in Sears, the twin of the new coffee maker we just bought to replace the old one (the electronics didn't survive the camping trip)(yes we take a coffee maker camping). Obvio...\n\nGardner Campbell writes…..as I reflect\n\nGardner Campbell’s A Personal Cyberinfrastructure goes far beyond what an online class may be. Campbell explains progress in ways individuals don’t think of it as. He stated, “progress means looping back to earlier dieas whose vitality and importance were unrecognized or underexplored at the time, and bringing those ideas back into play in a new […]\n\nRepresent a Well-Known Story as a Transit Map\n\nOne of my favorite stories from my childhood is the Wizard of Oz. This is a flow map of the story. It is all connected through Kansas.\n\nPrelude to a Reboot\n\nI received my diploma in the mail yesterday and this has prompted me to clear my throat, in a manner of speaking. Since November 2013, when I began my descent into the valley that would become my masters applied project … Continue reading →\n\nds 106zone LoDown 001 – Thoughts\n\nScott Lockman seemed to be giving us listeners the ins and outs of what ds106 might have in store for us this semester. By him doing these short podcasts daily, I feel as if listening to them will help me with questions or concerns I may come across while doing some of my ds106 work, […]\n\nThe Hobbit as a Transit Map\n\nToday’s Daily Create One of m favorite books as a transit map\n\nA Trip Through The LEGO Movie!!!\n\nWell, I’m not an expert artist, but here is my rendition of a map for The LEGO Movie.\n\nMulan Took The Subway?\n\nAlright, so for those of you who can’t read my handwriting (which should be all of you), i’ll write it out for you. Stop 1:Mulan’s House Stop 2: Army Comes For Dad Stop 3: Does Goes (which doesn’t have end tracks) Stop 4: Mulan Sneaks Out Stop 5: Goes To Family Temple Stop 6: Mulan […]\n\nWill a remastering of the Wire refine or deplete?\n\nEarlier today I found an article by The Telegraph which reported that the Wire will be digitally remastered and replayed on HBO. The episodes will start to replay on September 8, which is perfect timing for all of us in ds106. I fully intend to watch, but to watch with a critical eye as I think […]\n\nWire 106: S01E10 “The Cost”\n\nPaul Bond and I discuss Episode 10 of Season 1 of The Wire: “The Cost.” And as you may have quessed, this season is all about, well, the costs of it all. Also, Wire 106 internaut Maggie Stough provides and … Continue reading →\n\n“Now You’re in the Game.”\n\nFor the GIF assignment, I summarized Season 1, Episode 10: The Cost of The Wire. I picked five scenes that had what I felt were either crucial moments, and/or crucial lines. The actual GIF making process was definitely more difficult than I had thought it would be, but that is because I chose to make it more difficult for myself. I was not… Read more →\n\nAn Unforgettable Journey Back To Earth – Gravity\n\nFor today’s daily create I did Sandra Bullock’s journey in the movie Gravity. This movie had a huge amount of hype that it was going to be amazing before it was released. I do not think it was a great movie and I will probably never watch it again. It all starts with Dr. Stone (Sandra Bullock) and […]\n\nReflective blogging day 4 – What do you love most about teaching?\n\nWhat I love most about teaching is having people know something because I caused that learning, and also helping people gain confidence to learn new things by themselves. I only wish I could inspire all my students...\n\nds106zone LoDown 001Reflection\n\nScott gave us a merry introduction as he began his podcast; it is always nice to feel welcome. He gives us a pretty clear picture of audio, and puts forth a love for pod-casting and all things audio. If I were to have any confusion about the topic, going to him for advice or pointers […]\n\nHow to Write Great Blog Comments\n\nYour task is to give at least four constructive comments on any of participants blog posts. Broaden your scope of class participation by giving feedback to each other (and not always the same person). You have gotten comments and will get more from your instructor, but it’s important as a community to comment on your … Continue reading →\n\n“The Mind’s I ” by The DS106 Shrink Cindy said in her…\n\n\"The Mind’s I \" by The DS106 Shrink\n\nCindy said in her post:\n\n\"Looking for an inspiration, I searched for ‘mind’s eye’ …\"\n\nShe also said she was not a gif maker so I thought I would make a few gifs for her post.\n\nSource: Archive.org\n\nTaking a Trip Through Neverland\n\nEveryone knows the story of Peter Pan! #ds106 #wire106\n\nMy First Ever GIF!!!\n\nI am very proud of myself because after a looooot of figuring things out and tweaking and a lot of programs crashing, I have finished my first ever GIF! Sure it may be poor quality but I am proud of it nonetheless. The explanation of all of the issues I had will be coming on […]\n\nTravel Day\n\nSusan and I have spent a restful morning at Maria’s bed and breakfast making journey daybook pages before we leave Iguacu for the airport.\n\nFuture Logo Right Here\n\nIf I were a scientist, I’d have this as my logo. Big enough for everyone to know who I am and small enough for shirts and business cards!\n\nEpisode 11 – as the world goes by\n\nThere was some interesting photography in episode 11, and I’m not sure what to make of some of it. The opening scene picks up from the end of the last episode, at the scene of the shooting. The segment is … Continue reading →\n\nDaily Create: Transit Map of Betrayal, Crucifixion, and Resurrection of Jesus\n\nI did the Daily Create for September 3, 2014. Despite the fact that I’ve moved away from the church in recent years, I felt compelled to make this Biblical story into a transit map. I know it’s a pretty simplified version of what occurred as there probably could have been … Continue reading\n\nChange of room for class\n\nI believe we are scheduled to meet in SJH 315.
