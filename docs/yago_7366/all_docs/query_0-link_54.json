        "text": "The goal of this paper is to reexamine the circumstances of the Falkland Islands crisis, caused by the Argentine annexation of the archipelago in 1982. It challenges the popular belief that the Falklands invasion was only aimed at distracting the society from the poor conditions of living caused by the deteriorating economy and lack of democracy. The paper takes into consideration a third factor: nationalism of the Argentine armed forces. The article takes both the domestic and international contexts of the Falklands crisis into consideration and presents how nationalist attitudes of the Argentine military influenced the Falklands conflict in 1982.\n\nThis article analyzes the key terms in the ongoing sovereignty debate over the Falklands/Malvinas Islands through a reading of Rodolfo Enrique Fogwill's classic novel Los pichiciegos: Visiones de una batalla subterránea. I argue against critical interpretations of the novel as anti-war and counter-foundational, finding that the novel reproduces sovereignty underground instead of resisting it. I examine this thesis through competing, seemingly irreconcilable claims to sovereignty: Argentina's arguments for decolonization and Britain's arguments for self-determination. In fiction, Fogwill miniaturizes and allegorizes these concepts, borrowing from Argentine dictatorship and Thatcherite discourses. He exposes the concept of sovereignty as the link between the internal Dirty War and external Malvinas War and between dictatorship and post-dictatorship politics and economics. I argue that Fogwill also provides a way to begin considering the legacy of sovereignty after globalization's move away from the nation-state. Re-visiting the novel makes the reader question the key terms of debate-decolonization and self-determination-and look beyond sovereign territory and the nation, suggesting a renewal of democracy.˙\n\nThis article shows a different approach on the Malvinas/Falklands War issue that faced off Argentina and England in 1982. The war has been studied, mainly, from the warlike point of view or by the impact it generated in the disputing countries. However, the consequences of the military conflict between two western block countries have been wider and not properly tackled.\n\nDuring a conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC in 2002, one of China’s most experienced and influential international policy advisors, Zheng Bijian, proposed that the idea of China's “peaceful rise” was an unprecedented concept in contemporary international relations. Beginning in 2004, Bijian noted that to achieve its development goals, China must gradually expand its convergence and influence among communities of interest worldwide. Two years later, within the framework of the 2nd World Forum of Chinese Studies, he gave a speech entitled “China Route, Chinese Dream, and Chinese Heart.” He used this speaking opportunity to outline a possible course for China’s peaceful ascent. In 2013, Bijian presented his ensuing thoughts on the subject at the 5th World Forum of Chinese Studies and stressed that there are three possible avenues for the development of global politics and diplomacy in the 21st century. Firstly, Bijian mentioned the idea that the primary global powers may continue to follow the logic of the Cold War, secondly, that they may involve themselves in local wars and finally that they may seek to invest in, and create communities of interest around the world for mutually beneficial development. This last option is decidedly in tune with the concept of peaceful ascent (Bijian 2013, 2006, 2011)\n\nThis article considers Britain’s relationship with the Falkland Islands and the wider context of UK–Argentine relations. It does so by considering three main themes. First, the current Argentine government’s strategy towards the Falklands (Islas Malvinas) and the manner in which the question of disputed ownership has been tied into wider Latin American relationships designed to unsettle UK and Falkland Islands interests. Second, the debate surrounding the defence of the Falklands is examined for the purpose of considering how this issue, especially sensitive given the 30th anniversary of the 1982 conflict, brings into sharp relief the implications of recent defence and spending reviews. Finally, the article aims to assess and evaluate the manner in which the Falkland Islands community engages with and responds to worsening UK–Argentine relations. It is concluded that UK–Argentine relations are in their worst state since 1982 and that there is little or no prospect of any improvement given the Argentine government’s commitment to force the UK into entering sovereignty negotiations. On its side, the UK and the Falkland Islands’ community do not believe that sovereignty is negotiable and would rather consider how more cordial relations could be established in a manner reminiscent of the late 1990s.\n\nDecades after a violent war that re-established British control over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas in Spanish), commercial fishing regimes and offshore oil discoveries have led Argentina and the United Kingdom to reassert their respective sovereignty claims through scientific advances. Scholarly literature on the South Atlantic archipelago focuses almost exclusively on the 1982 military conflict. However, the remote island chain has been a British imperial frontier of scientific knowledge production since Darwin’s 1833 visit aboard the Beagle, and overlapping maritime claims have now made the colonial holdout a key node for the contemporary use of science to spatialize and materialize desirable geopolitical visions of the future. Marine ecologists and geographers curate data on the South Atlantic to represent contrasting imaginaries: (1) Argentina’s oceanic assertion of territorial integrity through the government’s Pampa Azul campaign on the one hand; and (2) British channeling of the Islanders’ self-determination claim through the Falklands-based South Atlantic Environmental Research Institute (SAERI) on the other. Building on Trouillot, I argue that through these clashing imaginaries, sovereignty, self-determination and particular scientific practices become mobilized as “South Atlantic universals,” prescribed worldviews that project transhistorical power from the global periphery (Trouillot, Michel-Rolph. 2003. Global Transformations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan)."
