        "text": "For an economy that places people at the center.\n\nPincha tu Deuda aims to raise awareness and disseminate the origins and causes of the debt, inviting citizens to analyse, become aware of and share its effect on daily life, as well as to acquire tools and organise themselves to demand a transparent and participatory economy.\n\nWe believe that the only way to achieve greater transparency and responsible debt management is through an aware and educated population, capable of making conscious decisions about its economy. To this end, the Citizen’s Audit, as a tool of democratic citizen financial control, allows us to achieve that collective awareness necessary to progress towards a more democratic, sustainable and humane economy.\n\nTo generate these spaces of reflection and debate we have developed a program with a series of public actions, diverse and open to everyone, which will take place in different parts of the city of Madrid.\n\nItinerant photo exhibition White Elephants by Elise Fitte-Duval, born in Martinique and living in Dakar since 2001, winner of the Casa Africa Award at the Bamako Biennial in 2011. Elise’s work shows us the effects of debt and uncontrolled development on Senegalese citizens.\n\nFilm Series Pincha tu Deuda at the Faculty of Political Science and Sociology of the Complutense University of Madrid, on October 8, 9 and 10, on the occasion of Debt Week. With the films “Deudocracia” by Katerina Kitidi, Aris Chatzistefanou, ¿Quién ha hipotecado mi ayuntamiento” by Yago Álvarez, and “Capitán Thomas Sankara” by Christophe Cupelin.\n\nAwareness video Pincha tu Deuda made by Eduardo Luzzatti, illustrator and activist of the PACD Valencia. The five-minute video aims to bring the issue of debt closer to citizens in a close and enjoyable way: how it is generated, what consequences it has and what alternatives we have. The video will be presented on November 23rd at the Pincha tu Deuda festival.\n\nRepository of experiences, tools and methodologies, a digital repository that gathers experiences in citizen audits in different places of the world, as well as diverse tools and useful documentation for the execution of audits. The repository will be presented on 23 November at the Pincha tu Deuda festival.\n\nPincha Tu Deuda Festival, a three-day international meeting that will take place between Medialab Prado and the Espacio Vecinal Arganzuela on November 21, 22 and 23. We will have the presence of agents from different organizations and a series of activities will be held, alternating workshops with talks and meetings of a recreational and festive nature.\n\nDeuda, femenino plural, a conversation about debt in the Global South. With the participation of Elise Fitte-Duval, photographer, activist and author of the exhibition “White Elephants”, from Senegal; the movement Vivas, libres y desendeudadas nos queremos desde Argentina; and a third person to be confirmed. This meeting is promoted by the network Museo Situado, an initiative in which different migrant groups and neighbourhood associations from the Lavapiés area and the Reina Sofía Museum collaborate. It will take place on 26 November at the Reina Sofía Museum.\n\nGraphic design and illustration for the project by Eduardo Luzzatti. Festival photos by C.A.O. Photo. Live broadcast of the round tables by Rebel Streaming. Simultaneous translation in the round tables by Around The Word. Simultaneous translation of the talk ‘Debt, plural feminine’ by Zenobia Traducciones. Communication and media support from Pandora Mirabilia.\n\nThis project is co-financed by the European Union through the European project Citizens for Financial Justice. With the collaboration of Medialab Prado, the Complutense University of Madrid, the network of the Museo Situado (Museo Reina Sofía), Espacio Vecinal Arganzuela and the Teatro del Barrio. Coordinated by the Plataforma Auditoría Ciudadana de la Deuda, Grigri Projects and Massa Critica Napoli."
