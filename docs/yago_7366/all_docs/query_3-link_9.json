        "text": "In a groundbreaking new venture, The Salvation Army has produced a short film entitled La Deuda, which has been acquired for distribution by HBO. The Spanish-language film will appear on all HBO streaming services, including HBO Max, after making its premiere on HBO Latino on February 1, 2021, at 5:50pm Pacific Time. The film was created by The Salvation Army's Los Angeles-based multimedia team, called Share Change.\n\nLa Deuda was nominated for the HBO Iber-American Short Film Award at the Miami International Film Festival in March of 2020, but the festival was cancelled mid-way through the event due to Covid19 safety guidelines. La Deuda is loosely based on Jesus' Parable of the Ungrateful Servant found in the book of Matthew 18:21-35. Filmed on location in Mexico, La Deuda is a coming-of-age tale, following a young boy in his quest to save the life of his beloved pet goat. A companion Bible Study is available for download in English and in Spanish at: http://salarmy.us/LaDeudaStudy\n\n\"We want to showcase the continued power of Jesus' parables and narrative storytelling to teach the universal truths we all need to understand,\" said Lt. Col. Lisa Smith, Secretary for Program in The Salvation Army's USA Western Territory."
