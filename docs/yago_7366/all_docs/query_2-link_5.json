It is hosted by the journalist Jorge Lanata, and airs on Sunday nights in eltrece. It was highly critical during the Cristina Fernández de Kirchner presidency. In 2013, it won several Martín Fierro Awards including best news TV program and best journalistic work for Jorge Lanata.[1][2] During Fernández de Kirchner's presidency, it was censored in several provinces of Argentina with governors aligned with the president: Tucumán,[3] Formosa[4] Mendoza[5] and Río Negro.[6]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nThe TV program opens with a \"humorous\" stand-up comedy, where Lanata comments on the political events of the week with jokes. These stand-ups are included as an homage to the late Tato Bores, who made similar monologues in his TV programs, which were also aired on Sunday nights.[7] The stand-ups feature a parody of the president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, made by the humorist Fátima Florez. The high success of the parody made by Florez was pointed by the magazine Noticias, which placed her on the main page.[8]\n\nThe theme song is \"Fuck You\", by Lily Allen. It was chosen to redress it after it was used in a telenovela of the state-owned TV Pública, in a poor Spanish translation. The opening features photos of the audience making the middle finger, which soon became the icon of the program.[9]\n\nThe program was redesigned in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. The program did away with the live audience and the big setting, and featured just Lanata alone in a desk. The program was now called \"PPT Box\", and the intro and outro secuences make the visual effect of Lanata being inside a giant box.[10]\n\nInvestigations\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the alleged Kirchner corruption money laundering trail investigation, see K money trail.\n\nMost investigations made by Periodismo para todos generated political controversy. The first airing, on April 15, 2012, made an extensive investigation of the Boudougate, the scandal about the vice president Amado Boudou. Lanata made an interview with Carlos Raúl Schneider, who is registered as the head of \"Tierras International Investments CV\" a firm associated to \"The Old Fund\", led by Alejandro Vandenbroele, which invested million in Ciccone Calcográfica. Schneider is actually a poor pensioner, who was not even aware of the business involving him,[11] who signed papers without reading them and became a victim of identity theft.[12]\n\nLanata made a report of the social and political conditions of the Tucumán Province, ruled by José Alperovich. He detailed the poor social conditions of the people and the wealth of the Alperovich family, which controls the three powers and all political institutions in Tucumán. As the program is censored in Tucumán, Lanata sought to present it live with public of the province. Alperovich did not allow that either, so the program was presented live from a house of social welfare.[13]\n\nCensorship\n\n[edit]\n\nPeriodismo para todos was censored in several provinces with governors aligned with the president. It is censored in Tucumán, and not available in public broadcasting (El Trece is a public channel).[3] The program that criticized governor Alperovich was followed by demonstrations against the censorship, during a speech of the ministry of education.[14]\n\nThe program is not available either for public broadcasting in the Formosa Province.[4] Lanata denounced political corruption, abuses against the indigenous peoples and electoral fraud in the government of Gildo Insfrán; the website of El Trece was hacked during the airing of the program.[4]\n\nEl Trece has a repeater channel in Río Negro, which shows all the programs of the network, with the sole exception of Periodismo para todos. The governor Alberto Weretilneck proposed Lanata to hold a public debate about the censorship, but Lanata refused. \"Censorship is not debated, it is denounced. Show the program first, and then I will debate whatever you want\", he said the following week.[6]\n\nThe program has also been censored in Mendoza.[5] It has been also reported that TV signal uses to drop down just by the time Periodismo Para Todos is on air. Interruptions, interference and other technical issues during the program are often experienced in some cities in the Province of Córdoba on Sundays nights when Periodismo Para Todos is broadcasting live.\n\nAudience\n\n[edit]\n\nPeriodismo para todos seasons Season Episodes Season premiere Season finale Time slot\n\n(UTC−3) Rating Original\n\nnetwork Other\n\nnetworks Kantar Ibope 1st 35 April 15, 2012 December 15, 2012 11:00 pm 15.7\n\neltrece — 2nd 34 April 14, 2013 December 8, 2013 10:00 pm 17.5 USA\n\nCanal Sur 3rd 32 April 13, 2014 November 30, 2014 14.4 4th 23 May 31, 2015 November 29, 2015 16.4 «El K-Jero» (TV-special) 1 March 20, 2016 19.6 5th 23 July 3, 2016 November 27, 2016 14.5\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\n2012 Martín Fierro Awards\n\nBest journalism program[15]\n\nBest male journalist (Jorge Lanata)[15]\n\nBest humoristic work (Fátima Florez)[15]\n\n2013 Tato Awards\n\nProgram of the year[16]\n\nBest journalist hosting (Jorge Lanata)[16]\n\nBest direction in non-fiction (Luis Barros)[16]\n\nBest production in non-fiction[16]\n\nBest journalist program[16]\n\n2013 Fund TV Awards [17][18]\n\nCurrent politics Journalism Program (Programa Periodístico de Actualidad política)\n\nExtraordinary Award (selected among the winners by the jury )\n\n2013 Martín Fierro Awards[19]\n\nBest journalism program\n\n2014 Fund TV Awards[20][21][22]\n\nOpinion Journalism Program (Programa Periodístico de Opinión)\n\n2014 New York Festivals - World's Best TV and Films Awards\n\nSilver World Medal, competition \"Television - News: Reports/Features\" category \"Investigative Report\" [23]\n\n2015 Martín Fierro Awards[24]\n\nGolden Martín Fierro Award for Jorge Lanata\n\nBest journalist program\n\nBest male journalist (Jorge Lanata)\n\nNominations\n\n[edit]\n\n2013 Martín Fierro Awards[25]\n\nBest production\n\nBest female journalist (Luciana Geuna)\n\nBest male journalist (Jorge Lanata)\n\n2014 42ND INTERNATIONAL EMMY AWARDS [26][27]\n\nCURRENT AFFAIRS (Journalism for All - The Route of the K-Money)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nThe K money trail\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
