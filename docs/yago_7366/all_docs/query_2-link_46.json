        "text": "00 09\n\nPatagonia, a vast wilderness of lakes, forests and mountains that straddles the Andes across the southernmost part of South America.\n\nIt’s the ancestral home of the indigenous Mapuche people, who were here when Spanish conquistadors first arrived on the continent over four hundred years ago.\n\nSince the 19th century it’s been divided by the border between Chile and Argentina – but for the Mapuche that’s always been an arbitrary boundary.\n\nFor generations, they’ve fought – and mostly failed - to get their rights to these lands recognized by both nations.\n\n01 06\n\nNow those ancient, simmering resentments are once again bursting into flame.\n\nThe Mapuche say they’ve been pushed to the brink by a surge of environmentally destructive industries, such as logging.\n\nViolence is spiraling and the region has been seen a spate of arson attacks against timber companies and landholders.\n\n02 14\n\nLa Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina’s most prestigious museum of natural history it attracts millions of tourists every year. But the museum’s basement hides a dark secret. Unbeknown to the visitors scurrying above, there’s a room strictly off limits, which says much about the state’s erstwhile attitudes to its indigenous people. Here are the skulls of 1000s of Mapuche captured and killed in the late 19th century as European settlers pushed south into Patagonia in what is euphemistically called the ‘Conquest of the Desert’. Their remains were on display until the 1960s\n\n04 49\n\nClip from Latana’s show in which he interviews a Mapuche in prison\n\nLatata: Someone bought the land. Land is private. you can buy and sell land.\n\nHuela: Since when is it private? Since there was a genocide.\n\nLanata: Since always...\n\nHuela : No, there was a genocide here, 1879/1885.\n\nLanata: Would you say that there was a genocide that ended with the Roman Empire?\n\nHuela: What empire? My people were in concentration camps.\n\nLanata: Do you think we can go to Rome now and ask for a part of the Vatican?\n\n06 23\n\nCritics say that since the election victory of President Mauricia Macri 2 years ago, the state’s attitude to the Mapuche has become noticeably worse.\n\nlast August the issue a PR nightmare for the government when Santiago Maldonado, a white Mapuche supporter disappeared, while fleeing from police when the Mapuche camp on the Benetton estate was raided\n\nIt traumatized Argentina, awakening painful memories of the country’s 30,000 disappeared who vanished during the dictatorship in the 1970s.\n\nThe president appeared on TV to deny involvement.\n\n07 21\n\nFor 3 months the country was gripped by the fate of Maldonado and then his body was found floating in this river, cause of death drowning according to the autopsy. However the body appeared inexplicably in almost exactly the same place as he had last been seen fleeing the police, and there had been numerous searches of the area leading many like Nobel peace prize laureate, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, to doubt the official version.\n\n09 04\n\nInt. Ana Piquer, national director, Amnesty International\n\nIn Araucania region there is the sense that there is the violence that is out of control and that should be somehow addressed by the authorities. Of course, it’s not that we validate the violence of the acts that were being committed in the region, but you cannot use that as an excuse to go over human rights\n\n09 25\n\nA group of militant Mapuche calling itself Coordinadora Arauco Malleco or CAM is engaged in a campaign of sabotage against the logging industry which it says is destroying the environment. So far no one has been injured but the group has caused millions of dollars in damage.\n\nThe government has responded by invoking an anti-terror law drafted during the time of former dictator General Pinochet\n\n10 05\n\nAna Piquer, national director, Amnesty International\n\nit affects the whole community. They arrive violently, they raid every house, they throw tear gas and not clear why in one of very recent cases. This year was affected a pre-school, that was in class with little children inside, that were all affected by the tear gas. And some cases with… had to be taken to hospitals\n\n11 03\n\nShe tells us that a year ago her son was shot in the back by a police sergeant, while trying to defend his 12 year old brother.\n\nIt’s the first court case of its kind and for the Mapuche hopes are high that the perpetrator won’t get away with it this time. As it turns out the sergeant doesn’t even attend the hearing.\n\nHardly surprising, say activists, no policeman has ever been convicted for shooting a Mapuche\n\nBut Ada is in no doubt who she holds responsible\n\n16 33\n\nJose Marileo\n\nThis lands were filled with forestry companies. Looking around you don´t see natural reserves, it´s all pine and eucalyptus... we had to see them taking away those resources right in front of our faces. The few lands left for us were covered in dust, the animals couldn´t find anything to eat.\n\n20 00\n\nWith the victory of conservative Sebastian Pinera in last year’s Chilean presidential election, some feel that the conflict is likely to intensify,\n\n20 12\n\nPinera says: Today the voice of the candidates stopped and the voice of Chileans were heard loud and clear.\"\n\n20 23\n\nDuring the campaign, Pinera received this glowing endorsement from Argentina’s autocratic president\n\n20 32\n\nMacri says: I want your election to go well. And in that I'm not objective, because I've been friends with Sebastian for many years, I admire him and I think he's a great leader.\n\n20 43\n\nA joint approach with neighboring Argentina to the mapuche question is now being formulated and Pinera has vowed to broaden the scope of country’s already fierce anti-terror laws\n\n20 56\n\nAna Piquer, national director, Amnesty International\n\nWe are worried about what might happen. We have always said that the antiterrorist law needs to be reformed. But that reform has to be done in terms of insuring due process standards. And going in that direction will likely do the opposite.\n\n21 52\n\nMaria Nahuel\n\nWe thought it was all over, when on Saturday they killed my nephew \"Rafa Nahuel\". They kept shooting, looking for more people, even though we told them that there was only ourselves there, and that the rest of the people were up(hill) working...\n\n22 32\n\nMasked man\n\nNot a word was said and they started shooting into the air, and aiming at us. We´re fighting for a little piece of land while on this side there´s a rich man with 2000 hectares, on that other side, another rich man with 2000 hectares, And we´re claiming for a just cause, our dignified ancestral rights, and a piece of land that we´re working as a community.\n\n22 58\n\nIts 4 months to the day since the disappearance of Santiago Maldonado.\n\nThe rally organized in the resort town to mark the date is also now remembering Rafa Nahuel who has also become a martyr to the cause.\n\nThere is an odd mood as protesters mix with holidaymakers.\n\nEffigies of President Macri, the police chief and Luciano Benetton are carried to a statue celebrating General Roca, the man who led the desert campaign to pacify the Mapuche in the 19th century.\n\n130 years on and the Mapuche are still suffering the consequences."
