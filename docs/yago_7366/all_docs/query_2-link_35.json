        "text": "Our tradition of bringing real life investors to our Technology entrepreneurship class at Stanford was a huge success this week. Dr. Alexander J. Bischoff shared his perspective as a member of a traditional family office with strong ties to Hollywood and the AI community in SF. He highlighted that what makes inter generational family enterprises successful is a clear value system. Such an important reminder during the AI revolution! Dave McClure brought his characteristic charm, blunt honesty and priceless advice to our student founders - he stressed the importance to bring data if you have traction, but in the absence of metrics, to appeal to a human connection with the investor. Amélie Vavrovsky shared Unshackled Ventures’ compelling value proposition to international founders, as well as her personal experience pitching to investors as a solo founder Needless to say, the students were star struck and delighted to be able to practice their 60sec pitches in front a real life version of shark tank! Thank you Alex, Dave and Amelie for sharing your wisdom and inspiring the students!\n\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging takes a new meaning with the AI revolution. Our Technology Entrepreneurship Stanford students hear it directly from the source: Alana Karen (author of The Adventures of Women in Tech: How We Got Here and Why We Stay https://a.co/d/7txmWGO), Eve Blossom (founder of materialchange.net), Carolyn M. Supple (Google Public Sector and founder of the Center for Ethical Leadership for Media at U Texas). Fascinating and moving conversation! Thank you Alana, Carolyn and Eve!\n\nIf you ever wondered what a modern life Leonardo Da Vinci would look like. you are looking at one! Scott Summit Scott mesmerized my Stanford creativity students with his drawings, designs and by inspiring them on the future of tech-enabled health and wellbeing. Thank you Scott!\n\nWhat makes you irreplaceable? We have been asking this question during the entire quarter in my Redefining Human Creativity and Human Connections in the AI era at Stanford. This week we had priceless insights straight from Hollywood: Michelle Slavich and Carla Vionette Santiago shared their vision in the opportunities that AI may bring to the creative industries, and the potential disruptions to current business models. Their personal life stories were truly inspiring to the students who did not want the class to end! Thank you Michelle and Carla for flying in to guest lecture. We are beyond grateful!\n\nDon’t miss out!! Are you looking to launch a startup? The final application deadline for the Founder Institute startup accelerator is this Sunday, August 4th. I’m a mentor with this program, which helps early stage founders validate their business, launch, and raise funding. You can apply using my referral link to get priority access: https://lnkd.in/gFk39Gbk Mike Sherbakov Apply now!\n\nMy Stanford students are the luckiest - today they had super star speakers Konstantin Guericke Guericke (cofounder of Linkedin), Philip Rosedale Rosedale (creator of Second Life), Sebastian Cao (Service Augmentation at Tesla). We discussed how to build trust in scaling networks, how to fix the world’s currency inequalities and the distinction between automation and augmentation. Very grateful to my dear friends Philip, Konstantin and Sebastian!"
