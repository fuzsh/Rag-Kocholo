        "text": "While global history’s emphasis on networks and its de-emphasis on the nation has brought about a fruitful platform for exploring interregional connections, this article argues that a global history recentered in the periphery and willing to draw from its rich national historiographies has the potential to reveal new forms of globalization and connection. It takes Argentina as an exemplary case to consider the ways in which tracing one nation’s many transnational and global orientations might bring to light motivations, geographical dimensions, and fields of power previously unseen.\n\nIn Argentina, the March 1976 coup d’etat is a conceptual fulcrum. Historians have neatly divided Argentina’s political, social, and cultural pasts as post- and pre-coup. There is a more compelling derivative, though, of that linear break. What the proceso means—how it is understood together with its consequences—keeps shifting, like the disturbing physical breaks in the urban geography of a futuristic Buenos Aires portrayed in novelist Ricardo Piglia’s La ciudad ausente. In part, changing understandings of what the proceso means to past and present complements Argentina’s unusual relationship with its dictatorial past. With the fall of authoritarian rule in 1983, Argentina was the first country in the region to form a truth commission to search for answers into the how and why of murderous dictatorship. It was also the first to bring to trial, convict and imprison military leaders for crimes committed as heads of state—this while dictatorships still functioned in 1980s Paraguay and ...\n\nThis book examines Argentine foreign policy under the military dictatorship from 1976–1983, also known as the National Reorganization Process. It brings together case studies on the most distinctive decisions and key issues in the regime’s foreign relations, including the international response to human rights violations, the dispute with Chile over the Beagle Channel, covert operations in Central America, the Argentine nuclear program, and the Falklands War. Lisińska examines the influence of ideological factors on foreign policy decisions, highlighting the relationship between the nationalism shaping the military’s policy goals and its pragmatic approach to achieving them.\n\nTraditionally, Argentine foreign policy has been regarded as the domain of the executive, and a laudable expression of realism. Perspectives that include domestic variables as a source of foreign policy have only emerged relatively recently, and have only assumed importance in a redemocratised Argentina in the course of its recurrent economic and political crises in the late 20 th and early 21 st century. This dynamic was particularly marked during and after the crisis of 2001. As a result, Kirchnerist foreign policy was affected by a range of complex domestic factors. The aim of this article is to show how those factors drove the governments of Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, without abandoning executive primacy, to prioritise a neodevelopmental economic model, and combine them with an autonomous foreign policy which they believed to be the only way to meet the social demands of those affected by the neoliberal crisis.\n\n\"\"Argentina’s Partisan Past is a study about the production, the spread and the use of understandings of national history and identity for political purposes in twentieth-century Argentina. It analyses how nationalist views about what it meant to be Argentine were built into the country’s long drawn-out crisis of liberal democracy from the 1930s to the 1980s. Eschewing the notion of any straightforward relationship between cultural customs, ideas and political practices, the study seeks to provide a more nuanced framework for understanding the interplay between popular culture, intellectuals and the state in the promotion, co-option and repression of conflicting narratives about the nation’s history. Particular attention is given to the conditions for the production and the political use of cultural goods, especially the writings of historians. The intimate linkage between history and politics, it is argued, helped Argentina’s partisan past of the period following independence to cast its shadow onto the middle decades of the twentieth century. This process is scrutinised within the framework of recent approaches to the study of nationalism, in an attempt to communicate the major scholarly debates of this field with the case of Argentina. The book is written for both students of Argentine history and those interested in the ways in which nationalism has shaped our contemporary world.
