        "text": "Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata began his career when he was 14 years old writing news spots at LRA1 Radio Nacional. In 1987, at age 26, he founded 'Página 12', which soon became one of the three most read newspapers in Argentina, he also was the Managing Editor in Chief of the paper until 1994. The next years he wrote several books, 'La Guerra de las Piedras' (a chronicle about the Arab-Israeli confrontation in the Gaza Strip), 'Polaroids' (short stories), `Historia de Teller' (novel), 'Cortinas de Humo' (an investigation about terrorist attacks on Jewish institutions in Buenos Aires). At the same time he developed a successful carrier on the radio stations 'Belgrano', 'Rock & Pop' and 'Del Plata'. In 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2003 he hosted 'Día D', the most widely viewed political program on national television in Argentina. During 2001 and 2002 he hosted 'Detrás de las Noticias'. In 1997 one of his short stories published in 'Polaroids' was translated and included in 'Prospero's Mirror' an anthology of Latin American literature published in the US. In that year he also published a series of articles compiled in a book called 'Vuelta de Página'. He founded the weekly magazine 'Veintitrés' in 1998 and the monthly magazine 'EGO' in 2001. As a result of five years of investigation in 2002 he published 'Argentinos I' and in 2003 'Argentinos II' distributed in Argentina and neighbouring countries and a special version of one volume was published in Spain in October 2003. Argentinos has become an unexpected publishing success, it has sold more than 340,000 copies so far and it has been in the best-sellers lists of the local newspapers, Associated Press and EFE for more than 60 weeks. Mr. Lanata is currently finishing his first documentary called 'Deuda' about the relation there is between the international organisms of credit and hunger in the developing countries, the film was produced by Patagonik Film Group and will be released in Argentine theatres October 7, 2004."
