        "text": "The U.S. has carried debt since its inception. Debts incurred during the American Revolutionary War amounted to over $75 million by January 1, 1791. Over the next 45 years, the debt continued to grow until 1835 when it notably shrank due to the sale of federally-owned lands and cuts to the federal budget. Shortly thereafter, an economic depression caused the debt to again grow into the millions. The debt grew over 4,000% through the course of the American Civil War, increasing from $65 million in 1860 to $1 billion in 1863 and almost $3 billion shortly after the conclusion of the war in 1865. The debt grew steadily into the 20th century and was roughly $22 billion after the country financed its involvement in World War I.\n\nNotable recent events triggering large spikes in the debt include the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, the 2008 Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic. From FY 2019 to FY 2021, spending increased by about 50%, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tax cuts, stimulus programs, increased government spending, and decreased tax revenue caused by widespread unemployment generally account for sharp rises in the national debt.\n\nComparing a countryâs debt to its gross domestic product (GDP) reveals the countryâs ability to pay down its debt. This ratio is considered a better indicator of a countryâs fiscal situation than just the national debt number because it shows the burden of debt relative to the countryâs total economic output and therefore its ability to repay it. The U.S. debt to GDP ratio surpassed 100% in 2013 when both debt and GDP were approximately 16.7 trillion.\n\nVisualizing the debt - How much is $99999999999999.99 trillion dollars?\n\ntoggle contents\n\nMaintaining the National Debt\n\nThe federal government is charged interest for the use of lendersâ money, in the same way that lenders charge an individual interest for a car loan or mortgage. How much the government pays in interest depends on the total national debt and the various securitiesâ interest rates.\n\nAs of it costs $ 0 billion to maintain the debt, which is 0% of the total federal spending in fiscal year .\n\nThe national debt has increased every year over the past ten years. Interest expenses during this period have remained fairly stable due to low interest rates and investorsâ judgement that the U.S. Government has a very low risk of default. However, recent increases in interest rates and inflation are now resulting in an increase in interest expense.\n\nWhen interest rates remain low over time, interest expense on the debt paid by the federal government will remain stable, even as the federal debt increases. As interest rates increase, the cost of maintaining the national debt also increases.\n\nWhy can't the government just print more money?\n\ntoggle contents"
