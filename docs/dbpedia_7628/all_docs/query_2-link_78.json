        "text": "Barcelona have announced the signing of former Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer after he left the reigning Champions League winners after the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nGundogan began his career at VfL Bochum in 2007, and made his professional debut for the club in 2009. He moved to 1. FC N¼rnberg in 2009, and helped the club to promotion to the Bundesliga in 2010. In 2011, he signed for Borussia Dortmund, where he won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in his first season. He also helped Dortmund reach the UEFA Champions League final in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Gundogan moved to Manchester City for a fee of £27 million. He has since won five Premier League titles, four EFL Cups, two FA Cups, and the UEFA Champions League with the club. He has also been named in the PFA Team of the Year on two occasions.\n\nGundogan has made over 50 appearances for the Germany national team, and has represented his country at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2020.\n\nThe German midfielder scored a brace against Manchester United in the FA Cup final this year and was also their captain for the last campaign. Barcelona have now snapped up Gundogan on a free and on a two-year contract with an option for an extra year.\n\nThe German midfielder has a release clause of 400 million euros attached to him.\n\n\"FC Barcelona and Ilkay G¼ndoÄan have reached an agreement for the German international to sign for the Catalans now that his contract with Manchester City has ended. He will join for two seasons, through to 30 June 2025, with the option to stay for one more year. His buyout clause has been set at 400 million euros.\"\n\n\"The club shall shortly be announcing the details of his official presentation.\"\n\n\"G¼ndoÄan turns 33 next October 24 and has a long and distinguished football career behind him,\" read the statement on Barcelona's website."
