        "text": "After signing Jose Mauri, Milan could be turning their sights to Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nAdriano Galliani is reportedly pursuing the 24-year-old German, who has been the target of several big clubs this summer. Galliani is believed to be willing to spend 25 million euros to land Gundogan's services.\n\nManchester United and Barcelona have both been linked to Gundogan this summer, but he opted to extend his contract with Borussia Dortmund through 2017. Jurgen Klopp, now the former Dortmund manager, described Gundogan as a smart player who is willing to learn.\n\nGundogan joined Dortmund from NÃ¼rnberg in 2011, instantly becoming a mainstay in Klopp's squad. A back injury disrupted his 2013-14 season. Gundogan returned to play 23 games in the Bundesliga last season, but Dortmund struggled to a seventh-place finish.\n\nGundogan was recently called into the German national team squad for a friendly against the United States and UEFA Euro 2016 Qualifying against Gibraltar.\n\nMilan has already bolstered the midfield this summer by signing Mauri, an exciting 19-year-old from Parma, and Italian international Andrea Bertolacci.\n\nCheck out some highlights from Gundogan's 2014-15 campaign below."
