The opportunity to work with a coach like Pep Guardiola is something I am really looking forward to and I am flattered to be the first signing the Club has made this summer.\n\n\"I can promise the City fans I will give everything to help us win titles both in England and the Champions League. These are exciting times.\n\n\"I have my best years ahead of me and I think we can achieve great things together. I can’t wait to begin this new chapter in my career."
