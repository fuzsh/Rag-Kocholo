        "text": "Lars Baron/Getty Images\n\nAside from a DFB-Pokal final against Wolfsburg at the end of May, Borussia Dortmund have very little left to play for this season. Jurgen Klopp will hope to drive the side up to one of the Europa League spots in the Bundesliga, but that will have little impact on how Thomas Tuchel takes over the side this summer.\n\nAs such, a matter that will need addressing quickly and putting at the top of the club's priorities is the situation surrounding Ilkay Gundogan and whether the central midfielder will leave Dortmund this summer.\n\nAs reported in the media, such as by BBC Sport on April 30, the Germany international is expected to leave the Bundesliga club this summer, with a whole host of potential suitors lining up to fight for his signature. Yet which of these super clubs would be best suited to the young talent?\n\nAt the moment, it looks as though Manchester United are best placed to pick up the wantaway star, with the likes of Sky Sports reporting that the Premier League side are willing to part with £21.5 million to acquire the midfielder.\n\nUnder Louis van Gaal, the Manchester club have looked far from settled—at least in terms of who is playing where from one game to the next—but there are plenty of reasons why Gundogan would be suited to a move to Old Trafford.\n\nThe first and perhaps most important reason is the 24-year-old would flourish in the quick, physical football of the Premier League. Although the Bundesliga is played at a slightly slower pace, Gundogan is no stranger to high-pressing football and the need to make his first touches and quick passes perfect.\n\nUnder Van Gaal, United have recently tended to play 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1, both of which would suit the central midfielder. Although technically a holding player under Klopp, Gundogan thrives when he is allowed to play his more natural box-to-box role for club or country.\n\nThis, partnered with an ability to fill in across the midfield, is undoubtedly what entices Van Gaal about the Germany international. Not only could Gundogan slot in as his holding midfielder, but he could also play alongside Marouane Fellaini, terrorizing opposing midfields and defences.\n\nAnother reason to bring Gundogan to Old Trafford would be to make him a key replacement for the central midfielders currently plying their trade in the middle of the park.\n\nJon Super/Associated Press\n\nVan Gaal has used a number of players in central midfield this season through a lack of any clear candidate. Wayne Rooney—perhaps the club's most competent forward—has had to do the odd shift in the middle of the park, yet it will most likely be Michael Carrick who is replaced.\n\nThe England international turns 34 years old this summer and, despite a relatively impressive campaign this season, has started to look his age. If United really wish to challenge for the Premier League title next season, they will undoubtedly need to replace the central midfielder this coming offseason.\n\nFortunately for Gundogan, there are very few alternatives at the club at the moment. Rooney has already been mentioned, but aside from Daley Blind—who has also filled in at left-back when needed—there are very few barriers stopping the Dortmund player from simply arriving in Manchester and walking straight into the side.\n\nA midfield trio of Blind, Gundogan and perhaps even Fellaini further up the field would make sense and offer a solution to a problem brought on by the Red Devils' consistent under-recruiting in the middle of the park. Should the Germany international rediscover his best form in England, he could well play a role for Van Gaal's side for the next eight years.\n\nAnother factor to consider within all of this is the simple fact that Dortmund would much rather sell the player to a club such as Manchester United than some of the more threatening alternatives. Although they remain mere rumours for now, the links with Bayern Munich represent a terrifying prospect that has hampered the Bundesliga club's recovery before.\n\nWhether Gundogan would prefer the Manchester side over Munich this summer may well be irrelevant in the end: Dortmund will surely only sell to a party outside of Germany."
