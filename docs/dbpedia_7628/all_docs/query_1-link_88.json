        "text": "05/08/2024 12:37\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has joked he got angry with Jude Bellingham after the England star snubbed his phone call.\n\nThe 21-year-old won LaLiga, the Champions League and the Spanish Super Cup in an incredible debut season in Spain.\n\nAside from those accolades, Bellingham was also the third highest scorer in the league. He netted 23 goals and grabbed 13 assists in 42 appearances, including 19 league goals.\n\nThat included two goals and the winner in a 2-1 El Clasico victory over Barcelona.\n\nBut despite his heroics for Ancelotti's side last season, this summer Bellingham accidentally gave his boss a reason to have a bone to pick with him.\n\n\"I got angry with Bellingham,\" the Italian told reporters whilst on Real Madrid's pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nWhen asked why, he started smiling and continued: \"Yes, because I called him and he didn't answer.\n\n\"I told him, Vinicius, call him and he immediately answered.\"\n\nHe added: \"So I got angry!\"\n\nHilariously, Ancelotti didn't then try to call Bellingham, but opted for another method instead.\n\n\"No, no, no! Vini passed it to me!\" he said.\n\nReal Madrid's already star-studded squad has had more sparkle added to it this summer following the signing of Kylian Mbappe.\n\nWhen quizzed on whether Bellingham's role, which sees him play in a more advanced position than his deep-lying midfield days, will change, Ancelotti insisted it wonâ€™t despite Mbappe needing to fit into the attack.\n\nHe said: \"Nothing changes for him. Nothing changes.\n\n\"The first season he surprised [us] a lot.\n\n\"He showed fantastic quality, really mature guy.\n\n\"The next season will not be different. He's going to be one of the best players we have and supporting the team a lot with his quality.\"\n\nAs if Bellingham's season hadn't been impressive enough, he also reached the final of Euro 2024 with England.\n\nThe Three Lions suffered a second Euro final heartbreak in a row as they conceded late on to lose 2-1 to eventual champions Spain.\n\nThere had been questions raised by pundits and fans over whether Bellingham was at peak performance levels during the tournament after a hectic season with Real Madrid.\n\nThe ex-Birmingham City star even came out and addressed the criticism around him and the squad himself.\n\nHowever, Ancelotti doesn't believe his player showed any signs of struggling in the tournament as he watched on from home.\n\nHe said: \"This is an opinion but I think Bellingham played very well at the Euros. England played really well. There is the final, they were close to winning.\n\n\"I don't know really how the players are or [if they] are tired for the game. Players that are used to playing every three days, they are at the end of the season without any problems.\n\n\"He played a huge amount of games. He had three weeks holiday and he came back in good condition, fit.\"\n\nReal Madrid's season begins with the Super Cup final against Europa League winners Atalanta on August 14."
