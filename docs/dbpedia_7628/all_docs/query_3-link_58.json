        "text": "Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan has signed for FC Barcelona according to SPORT and Fabrizio Romano.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Relevo reported that it was \"99% certain\" Gundogan would join the Catalans after passing his medical.\n\nThe German international passed the medical in his homeland and would sign a contract for two years plus an additional season once the examination is complete, the Spanish outlet added.\n\nOn Monday, Relevo reported that there was a \"total\" agreement between the Catalans and the 32-year-old, who is coming off a history-making, treble-winning season at the Etihad sealed by his double in the FA Cup final against Manchester United and leading his team to victory over Inter Milan in the Champions League last hurdle.\n\nGundogan joined City from Borussia Dortmund in 2016. The Mancunians wanted him to stay at their club, but attempts to make the player commit his future to them failed.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi-owned outfit offered Gundogan just one fixed year and an additional, optional season whereas Barca have arguably shown more faith in the midfielder by offering a guaranteed two years plus an extra term.\n\nThe extra year Gundogan can play at Camp Nou depends on the amount of appearances he makes according to Relevo. Furthermore, his contact comes with a â‚¬500 million ($538 million) release clause.\n\nAfter Gundogan decided to buy into Xavi Hernandez's blossoming project in Catalonia, his transfer should now be announced immediately by his new employers.\n\nGundogan will become Barca's second first team signing of the summer after Athletic Club defender Inigo Martinez.\n\nAs is common with the Blaugrana's dealings in the transfer market in recent windows, however, it is not clear that either man's contract can be registered rightaway.\n\nThis is because of Barca's struggles in navigating Financial Fair Play limits. Though their viability plan was approved by La Liga a fortnight ago, Barca cannot operate under the 1:1 rule yet and need to make sales in order to introduce fresh faces.\n\nAccording to SPORT, however, Barca are confident of registering Gundogan's terms on July 1 when he officially becomes a free agent.\n\nAfter landing Gundogan, Xavi will still want a more defensive, 'pivot' midfielder to replace outgoing captain Sergio Busquets, who is leaving the club on June 30 after almost 15 years in the first XI.\n\nTargets for the position include Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi and Fiorentina's Qatar 2022 breakout star Sofyan Amrabat."
