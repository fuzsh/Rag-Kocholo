        "text": "The Germany international, 25, signed for City from Borussia Dortmund last month despite a knee injury that will keep him sidelined for the opening weeks of the new Barclays Premier League season.\n\nThat did not prevent Guardiola from making Gundogan his first signing at City, though, and the midfielder revealed he was informed by his new manager that he sees him as pivotal for his vision at the club.\n\n\"He told me that he needs a player like me as a central midfielder,\" Gundogan revealed.\n\nPremier League\n\nMan City hearing set to start in September, outcome likely early 2025 – Paper Round\n\n12/08/2024 at 21:32\n\n\"We haven't had the possibility to talk more. He comes now, we will think about it more then we will see.\n\n\"I like to have the ball, to have the possession and to play passes, to create chances for my team-mates. I think that is what makes me strong. I hope those are things that we need here.\"\n\nGundogan has not featured since April due to a knee injury he suffered while still at Borussia Dortmund and it was that problem that prevented him linking up with his Germany colleagues at Euro 2016 this summer.\n\nCity have three league games in August and their first fixture in September after the international break is at Old Trafford against cross-city rivals Manchester United, whom Gundagon was constantly linked with while still at Dortmund.\n\n\"I hope to be ready as soon as possible, I am looking forward,\" he said of a comeback date.\n\n\"It seems (like it will be the) end of August or September but it is always difficult to say. I am happy right now at the moment and just being positive.\"\n\nCommunity Shield\n\nCity earn Wembley bragging rights over United after shootout win in curtain-raiser\n\n10/08/2024 at 16:54\n\nTransfers\n\nMan City target £68m Eze, PSG in talks to sign Man Utd's Sancho – Paper Round\n\n23/07/2024 at 07:58"
