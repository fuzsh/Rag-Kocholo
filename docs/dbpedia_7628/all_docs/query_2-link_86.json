        "text": "Dear Fans,\n\nNormally I do not express myself to media reports, especially not on Facebook. I want this time but some things back deal and you gain a better insight.\n\nIn recent weeks, I, like you, read again and again, where I would not have signed already fixed. Today in contract negotiations here tomorrow at the medical check there. At first I could still smile about it, but when there was talk of “contract poker” and “rip-off”, that has already voted me very thoughtful. After yesterday an ominous number has appeared in the media, I have decided, now even to say something about it.\n\nThe season 2014/15 is strictly speaking only on 30.06.2015 to the end.Although so far have been made in Europe hardly transfers, was made by me more demanded by rumor to rumor, but rather meet than later a final decision. Forgotten was this: I have one more year contract with BVB.\n\nWhat is important to me: that’s all neither Zockerei, another delaying tactic.What’s next for me personally, I will as soon as possible – but only after the season and our important game for the European Championship qualifier with the national team – decide."
