        "text": "It’s no secret that I’ve been an appreciator of Ílkay Gündogan’s craft at Borussia Dortmund. During the 2012/13 season, I followed his narrative from his Bildungromans moment to the “making friends and influencing people” phase, to now: the conclusion of 2012/13. At this point, the expectations of Gündogan becoming Sahin 2.0 are long, long forgotten, as are the expectations that he’d be able to become Dortmund’s metronome as the key pivot defensive midfielder in Jürgen Klopp’s 4–2–3–1 gegen machine. The narrative has turned. Currently and ironically, we’re now wondering if Sahin will ever become Gündogan’s equal and we’re also left wondering when, not if, the likes Real Madrid will swoop down and rob Dortmund of another key piece of equipment in its machinery.\n\nGündogan has arrived as one of the Bundesliga’s and Europe’s best midfielders. He’s a leader now. “Illy” was a consensus pick for one of the top Bundesliga and European footballers. Indeed, he was slotted in at #7 in our own top 25 list. Gündogan’s narrative has solidified so that he is now perceived as a key part of Löw’s men’s national team squad and as an irreplaceable part of Klopp’s Dortmund squad. The Gündogan narrative has shifted to the realms of stardom.\n\nThe tribute video compilations multiply. Here’s my favorite so far — hat tip to Elliot (@Futfanatico) and The False 9 — it simply shows Gündogan doing what’s paid to do, pass the damn ball. What’s worth noticing from these videos is the completeness of Gündogan’s play as a passer. And it’s this completeness trait that I want to highlight in this article. He’s developed into a midfielder who can seemingly do everything, passing-wise. Here’s what I gather from watching videos like this of Gündogan:\n\nHe can play longballs both on the ground and over the top of everybody (he averages 6.2 of these per match).\n\nHe can bend passes into an attacker with physics-defying curves.\n\nHe is passing a lot from the midfield circle to an attacker on a flank.\n\nHe dribbles, then passes off — that is, he is skilled both as a dribbler and passer.\n\nHe’s can start the engine of BVB’s famed counter attacks, as either he wins the ball or receives the ball from someone who just won it; with his pace, Gündogan then streaks up the pitch and lay offs a precise pass.\n\nHe seems to make the pass before the key pass; that is, he makes the pass to the player who then makes the cross into the box, or lays off a cute pass to someone who then takes a shot. (My hypothesis is that this effect helps explains his lack of assists for Dortmund — I’d love to figure out how to test this idea.)\n\nAnecdotally, I think of Gündogan as a mostly short passer, who excels in spraying the ball around from the central midfield. The reified image I have is of him receiving a pass — usually from Subotic — turning up the pitch, perhaps dribbling a bit, perhaps pivoting around a bit, then placing a precise pass to a running attacker. But I appreciate the videos — selection bias and lack of context noted — because they puncture my reified image of Gündogan’s passing role. The videos remind me that he’s just not a Xavi-like tippy-tapper, but is also a runner and gunner within the breathless game that Klopp’s Dortmund plays. For example, witness his floodgates breaking loose against Fürth in April:\n\nSo there’s a dangerous dimension to Gündogan’s game, even as he plays the defensive midfielder role in Dortmund’s 4–2–3–1. However, fußball really is a game of mostly short passing (e.g. 84% of Dortmund’s passes were coded as “short”), and this element of passing is Gündogan’s bread and butter, compromising nearly 90% of the passes he plays:\n\nGündogan is absolutely reliable in his short passing game, as he rarely ever misplaces a pass. Indeed, I’d venture to guess, if I had the data set, that his “second pass completion” rate would be one of the best for midfielders in the Bundesliga — hence my hypothesis that he makes the pass before the key pass. In this capacity, Gündogan’s passing role is not glamorous and easy to overlook, if you are simply looking at stat sheets. However, without his passing, Dortmund’s attack doesn’t work. So there’s both danger (for the opponents) and reliability in Gündogan’s role as Dortmund key ball distributor: a completeness that, no wonder, has attracted the attention of European giants, like Real Madrid.\n\n2012/13 was the year Gündogan became the leader — albeit a seemingly quiet one — for Dortmund. His modest stat sheet belies the irreplaceable passing role that he plays for BVB. Gündogan’s contribution to Dortmund have become like good infrastructure in a city: its smooth functioning can pass below our consciousness, as we come to assume its quality. For now, however, Gündogan enjoys the turning of his narrative to the platform of stardom.\n\nHeader courtesy of Alex Grimm/Getty Images Europe."
