        "text": "<p>Ilkay Gundogan has admitted to a failed approach from former club Borussia Dortmund this summer.</p>\n\n<p>The German talisman becomes a free agent on June 30 and is free to join a club of his choice this summer if he fails to extend his stay at The Etihad. </p>\n\n<p>Gundogan has been heavily linked with a move to La Liga champions Barcelona since before the start of Manchester City's treble winning 2022/23 season. </p>\n\n<p>The versatile midfielder played a crucial role in City's success last season, playing in 51 matches, scoring 11 goals and providing seven assists. </p>\n\n<p>\"There was contact between Sebastian Kehl (Borussia Dortmund Sporting Director) and my agent (Ilhan Gundogan). I can say that. But it was not very likely. To return to the Bundesliga was not my plan,\" said Gundogan.</p>\n\n<p>\"No decision yet, talks ongoing. You'll be the first to know once a decision has been made,\" he said.</p>\n\n<p>The Citizens manager Pep Guardiola has also been vocal about the potential exit of his skipper this summer, following an unprecedented UEFA Champions League title victory for the club.</p>\n\n<p>\"I'm aware of Barcelona interest but we're also very interested in keeping him at Manchester City,\" said Guardiola, as reported by El Chiringuito TV. </p>\n\n<p>\"I hope he stays with us. If Bar√ßa succeed in signing him, they will get a great, fantastic player.\"</p>\n\n<p>The 32-year-old midfielder has featured in 304 matches in all competitions for City, scoring 60 goals&nbsp;whilst providing 40 assists. Since joining the English side he has won five Premier League titles, four Carabao Cups, two FA Cups and the recent UEFA Champions League title with the club.</p>\n\n<p>Gundogan has also been linked with a big&nbsp;money move to Saudi Arabia, with a number of Premier League players reportedly switching to the Saudi Pro League including Chelsea trio N'Golo Kante (Al Ittihad), Edouard Mendy, Kalidou Koulibaly (both Al Ahli) and Hakim Ziyech (Al Nassr).</p>\n\n<p>When last asked about the possibility of a summer transfer window exit, Gundogan replied \"No decision has been made yet, I am in the process of deciding my future.&nbsp;He further added \"Barcelona is a beautiful city.\"</p>\n\n<p>It will be interesting to see if the German star with 66 international caps decides to follow the recent trend of snubbing European football for the wealthy Saudi Pro League this summer. </p>\n\n<p>The article <a href=\"https://www.planetsport.com/soccer/news/manchester-city-captain-ilkay-gundogan-reveals-borussia-dortmund-interest-amid-barcelona-links\">Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan reveals Borussia Dortmund interest amid Barcelona links </a> appeared first on Planetsport.com.</p>"
