        "text": "Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has emerged as an ambitious summer transfer target for Liverpool.\n\nJurgen Klopp looks to build his Liverpool squad ahead of the 2016/17 campaign and is understood to be in the market for a top quality midfielder.\n\nAccording to Times journalist Jonathan Northcroft, who stands as a highly reliable source, the Reds are interested in signing the Germany international – who could look to leave Dortmund this summer.\n\nGundogan is believed to have stalled on contract talks with the Bundesliga club, with his current deal set to expire at the end of next season.\n\nThis has led to links with Liverpool, among other clubs, but while the 25-year-old would be an ideal signing for the Reds this summer, supporters should not get excited about a move just yet.\n\nHaving recovered from a nightmare back injury in 2015, Gundogan has reaffirmed his status as one of the best midfielders in Europe.\n\nA technically gifted, box-to-box midfielder, Gundogan is capable of thriving in a number of roles, with Klopp having once described him as the ‘complete player.’\n\nHe showcased this in four seasons under Klopp at Dortmund, with his industry and creativity key to BVB’s title success in 2011/12, and their push to the Champions League final in 2013.\n\nHis contribution to Dortmund’s pressing game, and his tactical versatility, saw him become one of Klopp’s most important players.\n\nIf he joined Liverpool, his key status would only be magnified, with the former Nurnberg man poised to provide Emre Can with the perfect foil in midfield, giving the Reds a fine balance in a 4-2-3-1.\n\nThe prospect of pairing Can with Gundogan, with both serving in an all-round box-to-box role in the Liverpool midfield, is mouthwatering, while Gundogan would also complement the likes of Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino astutely.\n\nIf Klopp is able to use his positive relationship with the midfielder to his advantage, Gundogan would be a landmark signing for Liverpool.\n\nBut, as Northcroft attests, interest from wealthier clubs such as Manchester City is likely to see any move fail.\n\nJoining Liverpool would be a leap of faith for a player who, at 25, is set to enter his prime years, while joining City would see him slot into a midfield with well-founded, top-level ambitions.\n\nNorthcroft also suggests Borussia Monchengladbach’s Granit Xhaka as a ‘more likely’ target, and this may be the level that Klopp needs to look at this summer.\n\nHe would be a dream signing for Liverpool, but Gundogan may just be out of Liverpool’s league at this stage – Klopp or no Klopp."
