He made his first career assist in his fourth Bundesliga match against Bayern Munich. He later scored his first goal in a February 2010 match against Bayern Munich.\n\nGündoğan signed a four-year contract with Borussia Dortmund in 2011.

At the end of the year, Gündoğan scored his first goal for Dortmund in a 4–1 victory over SC Freiburg. Another highlight was in March 2012, when he scored a 120th-minute goal to beat Greuther Fürth, sending Dortmund to the DFB-Pokal final. In the final, Dortmund won their first domestic double by defeating Bayern Munich 5-2. Gündoğan soon became a dominant player in the team. In the 2012–13 season, he was instrumental in taking Dortmund to the UEFA Champions League final, the club's first in 16 years. Scoring the equalizer from the penalty spot in the 69th minute, Gündoğan helped Dortmund stay in the game. However, Bayern Munich ended up winning 2-1.\n\nIn July 2013, Gündoğan scored in the DFL Super Cup, helping Dortmund beat Bayern Munich 4–2. The following month, he suffered a back injury that sidelined him for a year. Gündoğan later signed a new contract with Dortmund to remain at the club until 2016; he was finally able to extend this until 2017.\n\nGündoğan signed a four-year contract with Manchester City in 2016. He made his home debut in a UEFA Champions League group stage game, which Manchester won 4-0 against Borussia Mönchengladbach. Days later, Gündoğan scored another 4-0 victory, this time over AFC Bournemouth. A further 4-0 victory came the following month against West Bromwich Albion.
