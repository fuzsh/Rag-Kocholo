        "text": "When Barcelona missed out on signing Lionel Messi, manager Xavi and the club’s sporting directors quickly turned their thoughts to Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nThe Spanish champions had been talking with the player’s representatives since early 2023 but accelerated their pursuit this month. Manchester City’s captain will officially join them on a free transfer on July 1.\n\nBarcelona’s work in the transfer market is limited by their financial problems. The club remains heavily in debt and is still unable to register new players as it is in breach of La Liga’s rules on salary spending. Those tasked with finding a solution to this are holding a key meeting on Wednesday — and The Athletic will report in more detail on the subject later this week.\n\nBut today’s focus is on Gundogan because looking beyond his undoubted quality and experience, there’s a case to be made that his signing might not be the most logical first move of the summer for a club that needs to reinforce other key positions while money is tight, including in defensive midfield. Gundogan will become one of the team’s highest-paid players.\n\nHere, The Athletic’s John Muller and Pol Ballus explore that argument and share more details on how Barca see him fitting in.\n\nJohn Muller: “Gundogan has no obvious role that would immediately improve Barca’s starting XI”\n\nIlkay Gundogan is an excellent player. Everyone agrees on that. No, he’s not young at 32, but up until a couple of weeks ago, he was still a key figure at Guardiola’s City, starting almost every big game along the way to a treble. For Barcelona, signing a veteran midfielder of his calibre on a free transfer looks, on the face of it, like great business.\n\nStylistically, there’s a lot for the Catalan club to like here. Gundogan is technically deft and tactically adept, trained in the same positional play that Xavi learned from Guardiola. He’s a good short passer who can play between the lines in tight spaces and an even better off-ball runner, with a special talent for slipping into the box off a striker’s shoulder to score a surprising number of goals. Importantly for a Barcelona side that lived off its defending last season, he was also an intelligent piece in Guardiola’s pressing schemes.\n\nIn terms of role, though, it’s less obvious where he fits in. The worry, in short, is that his best position is Pedri’s and his second favourite belongs to Frenkie de Jong, and while he would add a new dimension to Barcelona’s attack, he may not be the type of on-ball creator the team is looking for.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nIlkay Gundogan's Barcelona transfer - why Manchester City's captain decided to leave\n\nIn the 3-2-2-3 that City played last spring — and which Xavi quickly adapted for Barcelona — Gundogan lined up as the left attacking midfielder, working between the lines and favouring the left half-space, where Pedri also prefers to operate, while Kevin De Bruyne popped out to either wing a la Gavi. If Gundogan played alongside Pedri, one of the two would move to the right, where neither right-footer is fully comfortable turning inside at the top of the box.\n\nIt’s true that Pedri sometimes scooted over last season so Gavi could play as a false left-winger, a role that involved staying high and wide early in the build-up and then tucking inside when the left-back Alejandro Balde pushed up to the front line. Gundogan doesn’t have the legs to pretend to be a winger and has never been the type of midfielder to get out wide and put in crosses. That would make him a less-than-ideal fit for either the false left-winger role or Barcelona’s right attacking midfield slot, where Gavi’s underlapping seam runs help create space for the right-winger (Ousmane Dembele or Raphinha) to take on defenders one-v-one, the source of so much of the creativity in Xavi’s attack.\n\nWhat about something deeper? In years past, Gundogan dropped alongside Rodri in City’s build-up as a left central midfielder. He’s not quite a high-volume orchestrator type who’s constantly on the ball, organising the side, but he’s clean and effective at linking play. The problem, again, is that he has historically preferred the left side. That’s De Jong’s turf, where he’s coming off his best season in a Barcelona shirt. Either midfielder is capable of playing on the right, where Sergio Busquets sometimes worked alongside De Jong, but as a pair they might not provide enough defensive cover. Xavi’s experiments with Eric Garcia in that role suggest he wants a John Stones-type hybrid to put down an anchor in front of the back line while De Jong roams.\n\nThe word is that Xavi sees Gundogan primarily as an attacking midfielder, a source of creativity to strengthen his attack through the middle and take some of the load off the wings. That suggests he’ll be rotating with Pedri and Gavi and playing something like his recent role for City. But what kind of creativity would he add?\n\nIn six seasons at City, in one of the world’s best attacks, Gundogan averaged just 0.15 expected assists per 90 minutes. That’s closer to the De Jong (0.15 xA per 90 last season) and Gavi (0.13) tier of chance creation than to Pedri (0.23). Gundogan’s best attacking numbers came in 2021-22, when he played more of a super-sub role in a side that often used one or even two false nines, freeing him to slip into the box more. Over 2022-23, working off a conventional striker in Erling Haaland, Gundogan was more of a glue guy than a creator, rarely setting up high-value shots. When he does play passes into the penalty area, they’re usually short, wide-angle balls to a runner on the left side of the box — a pass type that suited Haaland much more than Lewandowski.\n\nInstead of final balls, what Gundogan provides is a second runner in the box, good at sneaking into dangerous pockets behind and to the left of the striker. That’s something neither Pedri nor Gavi does a whole lot of, and it could give Lewandowski some much-needed help finishing Barcelona’s attacks. It’s possible to imagine Pedri and Dembele handling the progressive passing while Gundogan runs the left channel as an auxiliary target.\n\nThe upshot is that Barcelona are getting a gifted, versatile player in Gundogan, but one without an obvious role that would immediately improve their starting XI. He may wind up serving as more of an all-purpose depth option behind Pedri, De Jong and Gavi, closest to Pedri in position and style but capable of filling in for any of the three. That’s not a bad piece to add, but it’s not a major upgrade or a solution to their biggest positions of need.\n\nPol Ballus: “Gundogan is the best option Barca had to reinforce what they consider to be a key area”\n\nGundogan’s signing solves a big problem Xavi first identified last April and has been trying to fix since.\n\nBarca ended the 2021-22 campaign without Pedri, who suffered a hamstring injury in the Europa League defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt. They really missed him as their season petered out; without the star young midfielder, the team lacked rhythm and creativity in attack.\n\nThat summer, as soon as Xavi learned Lewandowski was going to sign, a plan was hatched to add strength in depth on the wings, with the aim of supporting Pedri in his creative responsibilities.\n\nWith one of the best cross-hunters in the world in your team, it made sense for the manager to try to add more wide players to supply his new target man.\n\nHowever, Xavi’s major conclusion from his first full season in the Barcelona dugout has seen that strategy change. He now sees that in order to get his team playing the kind of football he wants, he needs to trust more in midfielders than in wingers.\n\nA mid-season tactical switch saw Barca do just that, with a four-midfielder system helping launch the team’s push towards winning La Liga. The change inspired their best performances but again — when injuries hit, there were problems.\n\nIn the last Clasico of the season, when Real Madrid beat Barca 4-0 in the second leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final, Xavi had to use Sergi Roberto and Franck Kessie in attacking midfield. He needs more depth in the position.\n\n“I understood we needed more control and to be more dominant instead of an end-to-end style of game,” Xavi said just after winning La Liga this season, responding to a question from The Athletic on the change in his tactical approach.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nHow Barcelona won La Liga: Old-school rules, new hunger and a changing of the guard\n\n“We felt better dealing with possession in the opposition’s half of the pitch, so I gave priority to the players who do not lose the ball. At the end of the day, that’s how I see football. For me, football belongs to midfielders, or to the guys who don’t lose possession.”\n\nWhen Pedri and Gavi were absent, it was clear Barca had nobody who could operate in the inside pockets of the final third of the pitch as Xavi would like. This is where Gundogan comes in. Now they arguably have Europe’s best trio in that department.\n\nThere is a case to make, looking back at the numbers and comparing them with Pedri and Gavi, that Gundogan’s influence won’t necessarily be transformative. But there is another key reason why the club pushed hard to sign him — versatility.\n\nGundogan landed in Manchester from Borussia Dortmund in 2016 as a classic number eight. Three years later, when he helped Guardiola’s side win their second Premier League title in a row, he operated as a sole holding midfielder as City closed out the season with 14 consecutive wins.\n\nIn 2021, City were crowned English champions with Gundogan playing on a regular basis as a false nine. He ended that season as the team’s top scorer in the league, with 13 goals. Over 2022-23, as City won the treble, he was playing mainly as a number 10 by the time the crunch games came around. In simple terms, he’s done it all. He listened, learned and executed.\n\nAt the age of 32, some may question how wise it is to offer Gundogan a two-year deal that is likely to extend to three years. City only offered a one-year extension with an option for a second year.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nCelebrating Ilkay Gundogan: The man who made the difference in Man City's biggest moments\n\nAt Barca, he will have one of the highest salaries in the squad. They will hope he can continue to perform as he has been for a long time to come and they will also hope his influence can help shape the team’s two young stars, Gavi and Pedri.\n\nBack in February, Pedri revealed how Xavi had asked him to play closer to the opposition box. “It’s something I want to improve on and that I feel lately I’ve been doing,” he said.\n\nThe 20-year-old ended last season with seven goals, his best return at Barca so far. When the team returns for pre-season training, he will be sharing a dressing room with one of the best in the world at arriving in the penalty area from midfield. Gundogan has scored more than 10 goals over the past three consecutive seasons. If you are looking for a role model for Pedri, here we are.\n\nBernardo Silva was Xavi’s preferred option last summer. There was huge excitement over Messi’s potential return this year. But Gundogan is without a shadow of a doubt the best option Barca had available to reinforce what they consider to be a key area.\n\n(Top photo: Alex Livesey – Danehouse/Getty Images)"
