        "text": "Ilkay Gundogan has become one of the star players at Manchester City, adding further depth to his game under the guidance of Pep Guardiola.\n\nA deep-lying midfielder at Borussia Dortmund who was part of the title-winning side under Jurgen Klopp, Gundogan has gone on to become one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe.\n\nFrom winning titles in Germany to treble success in England, Planet Sport takes a look back on some of Ilkay Gundogan's most iconic moments.\n\nFirst season success\n\nGundogan signed for Dortmund in the summer of 2011 following an impressive spell at 1. FC Nurnberg in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe young midfielder attracted a lot of attention due to his assured performances in the centre of the pitch. Coming off the back of a first title win in nine years, Dortmund were keen to add to their strengths, and did so by securing Gundogan's signature.\n\nGundogan racked up 28 appearances in his debut season, contributing three goals as Dortmund saw off Bayern Munich again to retain their title.\n\nAt the tender age of 21, Gundogan was already a Bundesliga title winner. It was a sign of things to come.\n\nDFB-Pokal heroics\n\nStill in his first season at the club, Gundogan was instrumental in Dortmund's DFB-Pokal success - their first since 1989.\n\nIn their semi-final tie against Greuther Furth, Gundogan had to settle for a place on the bench. With the tie still goalless, Gundogan was introduced in the 82nd minute.\n\nA penalty shootout loomed as the game entered extra-time. However, with the last kick of the game, up stepped Gundogan with a pinpoint strike from the edge of the box to send Dortmund through to the final.\n\nGundogan's semi-final heroics earned him a start against Bayern Munich in what would turn out to be a thrilling finale.\n\nFeaturing for the 90 minutes, Gundogan helped his side cruise to a 5-2 victory - completing Dortmund's first ever domestic double.\n\nChampions League run\n\nAfter Dortmund became a dominant force in the Bundesliga, they set their sights on conquering Europe.\n\nHowever, Dortmund's Champions League quest looked over before it had began when they were paired with Manchester City, Real Madrid and Ajax in the group stage.\n\nVery few expected Dortmund to progress, but impressive wins over all three sides saw them top the group and fans throughout the world started to take notice.\n\nImpressive wins over Shaktar Donetsk and Malaga in the following rounds set Dortmund up for a semi-final face-off with Spanish giants Real Madrid once again.\n\nDespite already having beaten Madrid in the group stages, Gundogan's side were still seen as underdogs.\n\nAn extraordinary 4-1 win in the first leg saw Robert Lewandowski take the plaudits after scoring all four of Dortmund's goals.\n\nHowever, Gundogan was also feted after an instrumental display in midfield.\n\nGundogan maintained his form into the final at Wembley where Dortmund faced German rivals Bayern Munich. Gundogan scored to cancel out Bayern's opener, but it was to be Bayern who lifted the trophy thanks to a 2-1 win.\n\nDespite the result, Gundogan had proven himself a top-level performer, attracting attention from Europe's leading lights.\n\nSecuring more honours\n\nDespite having only been at Dortmund for two seasons, Gundogan had already won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal and finished runner-up in the Champions League. But he wasn't done there.\n\nDortmund's defeat to Bayern in the Champions League final was a cruel blow to end the 2012/13 season, but they were ready to take immediate revenge when they faced Bayern yet again, this time in the 2013 DFL-Supercup.\n\nBayern were caught out by Dortmund as they got their revenge with a resounding 4-2 win. Gundogan was once again instrumental in the tie and added Dortmund's third goal.\n\nA third title in two years was an impressive start for the young player and personal accolades followed - Gundogan was named in the European Sports Media Team of the Year for the 2012/13 season.\n\nBig money move\n\nGundugan's major move came in 2016 when Pep Guardiola made him his first Manchester City signing. The fee was reported to be around £20million.\n\nGuardiola was brought in at the Etihad to turn City into the best in the world following his previous success at Barcelona and Bayern.\n\nGundogan was provided with the stage to take his game to another level and he did just that.\n\nBraces against West Brom in the league and Barcelona in the Champions League group stages announced him to the Manchester City fans. However, a cruciate ligament injury stymied his process, forcing him on the sidelines for nine months.\n\nHe returned to action in September 2017 and slowly refound his form.\n\nPlaying in a side who dominated possession, Gundogan thrived. In the match against Chelsea on March 4, 2018, set new Premier League passing records for the most passes attempted (174) and the most passes completed (167) in a match.\n\nWinning the treble\n\nIn the 2018/19 season, Manchester City went on to break numerous records in what proved to be a historic Premier League campaign.\n\nManchester City achieved the domestic treble, becoming the first England club to simultaneously hold the League Cup, FA Cup and top-flight title.\n\nCity won their first of the three honours by defeating Chelsea on penalties in the final of the Carabao Cup.\n\nThe second trophy came after they narrowly edged out Liverpool to secure the Premier League title on the final day of the season.\n\nA week later, City featured in the FA Cup final against Watford and recorded an emphatic 6-0 win to complete the treble.\n\nThe history-making didn't stop there as they had also won the FA Community Shield at both the start of the season and the following season.\n\nAdding goals to his game\n\nIn the opening 12 Premier League games before the positional switch, Gundogan had failed to score. But as he moved further forward, the goals and assists started to rain in.\n\nNow he sits joint eighth in the top-flight scoring charts with 13, the same number as Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy but from five games fewer.\n\nGundogan's recent form paired with his astute tactical awareness has seen him become one of the best attacking midfielders in the league.\n\nThis recent upturn in form has also seen Gundogan receive consecutive player of the month awards for January 2021 and February 2021."
