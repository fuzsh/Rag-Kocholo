        "text": "ILKAY GUNDOGAN has revealed the secret to success at Dortmund under Jurgen Klopp - turning up drunk.\n\nKlopp masterminded back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012.\n\nAnd Manchester City pass master Gundogan says that Klopp turned a blind eye to the Saturday night sessions that helped bond his players.\n\nGermany ace Gundogan, 27, arrived between the two titles triumphs.\n\nAnd he helped Dortmund shrug off a poor start to the season with a 28-game unbeaten run that set a club record and sealed another title.\n\nIn the Klopp biography 'Bring the Noise', Gundogan has explained how booze helped fuel their success.\n\nHe said: \"We went out quite often as a team.\n\nSUN BETS: BET £10 GET A FREE £30 BET\n\n\"There were a lot of singles in the squad. Sometimes you could see the after-effects in training on Sunday morning.\"\n\nHowever, Klopp had to warn his players after some of the partied until 3am following a midweek win over Bayern Munich.\n\nThey found themselves behind to an early goal against rivals Schalke before fighting back to win.\n\nSAMBA SIZZLERS Five England vs Brazil classic moments\n\nGundogan said: \"Somebody told me a few of you went out during the week… I don’t know who, I don’t want to know.\n\n\"But I can tell you: these players should be happy we won yesterday.\n\n\"Otherwise we would have seen the biggest punishment in the history of club football!\""
