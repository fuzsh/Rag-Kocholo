        "text": "According to the Goal, Euro top scorer Dani Olmo is very close to joining Spanish giants Barcelona from RB Leipzig this summer. Dani Olmo has always been a top quality player. However, Dani Olmo has become an exciting prospect in the football world after his performances for Spain in the Euro 24. The Spanish midfielder was proved to be an important player for the Spainish national team throughout the tournament. Dani Olmo also ended the tournament as the top scorer of the tournament and was rewarded by the golden boot of the tournament. Olmo proved to be a key player for Spanish team. Now the market value of Dani Olmo has skyrocketed and many clubs want to sign the Spaniard.\n\nOne of the clubs that were heavily linked with Dani Olmo was Barcelona. The Spanish club is very unlucky after majority of their players suffered injuries this international break. Many Barcelona defenders like Pedri, Frenkie De Jong, and Gavi, are injured, and there is no expected date of them to return. It is uncertain if they will be available for Barcelona in the upcoming season. Ilkay Gündoğan and Andreas Christensen are currently the only first team midfield options available for Barcelona. New manager Hansi Flick wants a player that can integrate in his tactics just like Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller.\n\nEuro top scorer Dani Olmo is Barcelona’s first signing\n\nBarcelona is undergoing a huge change this season. Last season was a very tough one for the Spanish club. Their former manager and club legend Xavi announced a contract extension at the end of last season. However Barcelona decided to sack their club legend and sign Hansi Flick. After a good pre season under Hansi Flick, things are going in the right direction for Barcelona. The Spanish club managed to win their every game in pre season till now.\n\nHansi Flick’s new tactics are already looking pretty well for the club. Dani Olmo is the first signing of Barcelona this summer. Barcelona were also linked with Athletic Bilbao’s winger Nico Williams after his impressive campaign for the Spanish team in Euro 24. Nico Williams seemed to form a dangerous partnership with Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal in the flanks of Spanish team. However many clubs tried to sign Nico Williams this summer due to his low release clause. After all the transfer saga the Spanish winger decided to stay at Athletic Bilbao for another season.\n\nHansi Flick’s tactics and how Dani Olmo is a great addition\n\nHansi Flick is known for his very physical game style. After some videos from Barcelona’s pre season training were shared on social media, we can see the change clearly. All the Barcelona players are now looking physically stronger than last season. Hansi Flick’s tactics involve playing an attacking midfielder behind the striker for creativity. Earlier this role was given to Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller in their treble winning season. In the pre season we can see this role given to youngster Pablo Torre.\n\nDani Olmo will be a perfect fit for this role in Hansi Flick’s tactics. The Spanish midfielder has great dribbling skills and provide great creativity in the midfield. Olmo also has the ability to provide an end result after we saw his numbers in Euro 24. Barcelona are willing pay €55m (£46m) as a guaranteed price and €7m (£5m) for further add ons. This is a great price for the Euro top scorer and will not affect Barcelona’s poor financial condition. Dani Olmo is also a La Masia product from Barcelona. It is expected that the deal between both the clubs will be completed soon. Dani Olmo is expected to make his debut for Barcelona in the club’s season opener against Valencia.\n\nFor more sports updates, make sure to follow us on:"
