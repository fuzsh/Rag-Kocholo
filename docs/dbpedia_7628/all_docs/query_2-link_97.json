        "text": "German side Borussia Dortmund have told Real Madrid target Ilkay Gundogan to make up his mind over a new contract.\n\nThe 23-year-old has a deal that runs until 2015 with Jurgen Klopp’s side but the Bundesliga side and last season’s Champions League runners-up are keen to tie him down on longer contract and fend off any admirers for his signature.\n\nGundogan has long been linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu to add to Real’s central midfield options, and is seen by many in the Spanish capital as being a long-term replacement for Xabi Alonso. Other sides mentioned as possible destinations should Gundogan decide to leave include Premier League outfits Arsenal and Chelsea.\n\nSpeaking to Kicker magazine, Dortmund’s sporting director Michael Zorc said he didn’t like giving anyone ultimatums, but he was keen for the club to find out whether the Germany international intends on staying at the Westfalenstadion. “Our top priority is to find out if there is a willingness to prolong the contract,” he stated.\n\nShould Gundogan decide he does not want to prolong his stay at Dortmund, the club would likely look to cash in on him rather than letting him run down his deal before leaving on a free. Polish striker, and one-time Real Madrid target, Robert Lewandowski this week announced his decision to leave the club and sign for Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich when his contract ends in June."
