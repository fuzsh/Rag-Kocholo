        "text": "Ilkay Gundogan has revealed how Barcelona is the only club he would have considered leaving Manchester City for after he was confirmed to be joining the La Liga giants.\n\nThe treble-winning City captain was confirmed to be joining the Catalan club on Monday, with his contract at City expiring at the end of this month. The German spent seven years in Manchester, winning five Premier League titles, with a remarkable treble coming in his final season at the club.\n\nThe 32-year-old will officially become a Barca player on July 1, joining the La Liga champions as they continue their quest to re-establish themselves at the summit of European football under the leadership of legendary former player, Xavi.\n\nWriting in the Player's Tribune, Gundogan outlined his reasons for joining Barca, revealing that he had disappointed Pep Guardiola with his decision to join the club he had dreamed of playing for since childhood.\n\nHaving also been a target for Arsenal, he explained: \"I think maybe Pep was hoping that we would come here to City together and leave together, but I know that he understands my decision. I am sure it helps that I’m going to his boyhood club. Hopefully we’ll have a reunion soon in a Champions League Final.\n\n\"If I was going to move, there is only one club in the world that made sense. It was Barcelona or nothing. Ever since I was a little kid, I dreamed of wearing that shirt some day. I am confident that I have a few more years left at the highest level, and I just want to help bring Barcelona back to where they deserve to be.\"\n\nGundogan made his name at Borussia Dortmund, becoming a key player under Jurgen Klopp as the German club won back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 before reaching the Champions League final in 2013. Another former Dortmund player, Robert Lewandowski already plays for Barca, with Gundogan revealing his excitement ahead of linking up with his former teammate.\n\n\"It will be a reunion with my old friend Lewa [Robert Lewandowski], and I’m excited to play under another manager who I have admired for a long time. When Xavi and I talked about the project, it just seemed so natural. I see so many similarities between us as characters and in the way we see the game.\"\n\nThe German took time to make an impact at City, arriving with a knee injury, before rupturing his ACL during his first season, which saw him miss nine months of action. However, Guardiola kept the faith in a player whom he eventually named captain upon the departure of Fernandinho last summer.\n\nGundogan revealed the difficulties he experienced breaking the news to Guardiola, thanking the former Barcelona manager for his faith: \"One of the hardest calls I had to make was to Pep, telling him that I was going to leave. All I could do was to say thank you. Not just for this season, or for all the trophies, but for bringing me here in the first place.\n\n\"I will never forget when I hurt my knee at the end of the season with Dortmund and I had to get surgery, I was so worried that City would pull out of the deal for me. But Pep called me on the phone and said, “Don’t worry, it doesn’t change anything. We want you here. We will wait for you no matter how long it takes.”\n\n\"I can only imagine what the fans thought when this quiet guy with the funny name arrived here in Manchester for a lot of money and he was limping around on crutches at the unveiling.\n\n\"Well, all I can say is.... I came here limping on one foot, but I leave here feeling like I am flying in the clouds.\""
