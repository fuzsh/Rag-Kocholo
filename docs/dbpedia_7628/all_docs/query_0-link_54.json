        "text": "Manchester City are ready to hand Ilkay Gundogan a two-year deal to warn off interest from Barcelona.\n\nThe German's deal is winding down and there had been fears he would quit the Etihad and seek pastures new. Negotiations had hit a wall with City seemingly unwilling to offer the midfielder more than a 12-month extension, but now a U-turn has been made by the champions.\n\nThey are ready to offer a one-year extension with the option of a further 12 months, which could tempt Gundogan into staying, although no decision has yet been made. The former Borussia Dortmund man remains an integral figure in the blue half of Manchester and would be a massive loss.\n\nGundogan moved to the club in the same summer as Pep Guardiola and has continued to be a regular. The 32-year-old keeps turning out classy performances and could yet finish the season as a treble-winner. Guardiola has recently underlined the German's importance by suggesting they may not be able to win the top flight without him.\n\nHe said: “I remember one season when we won the second Premier League when Fernandinho was injured for a long time and he played as holding midfielder in games like against Burnley away with the long balls, second balls and… wow… he played.\n\n\"I said I had the feeling that without him we couldn't win the Premier League. He’s so intelligent Gundo, so clever and competitive. Under pressure he handles it without a problem. He’s one of the best players I ever trained in my career in terms of the whole package. He's top, top class.”\n\nThe City skipper has spoken glowingly about the team's latest achievement after they were crowned champions for the third straight year. Gundogan also paid special tribute to Guardiola.\n\nHe said: “To have helped the club win a third straight Premier League title is something very special. The Premier League is without doubt the most demanding and competitive league in the world - so that tells you everything about what an achievement this is.\n\n“This squad is so talented and so special and to have been captain this season has been an enormous privilege. I would also like to thank Pep, all the backroom staff and everyone who works across this football club. Every single day they help provide us as players with everything we need in order to try to be successful. There is no way we could have won this title without all their support.”"
