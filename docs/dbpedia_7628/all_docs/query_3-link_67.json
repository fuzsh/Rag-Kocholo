        "text": "In an unlikely turn of events, Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gündogan, who was set to leave the German club this summer, looks like he will stay on under new Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, according to his agent.\n\n\"This is clearly an option again,\" his agent and uncle Ilhan Gündogan told German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung when he was asked about the likelihood of the player staying on at Dortmund, and perhaps even signing a contract extension.\n\nIn April of this year, Gündogan revealed he would not be renewing his contract, one that expires in 2016, and that he wanted to leave the club. He was heavily linked with the likes of Manchester United, Barcelona and even German champions Bayern Munich, but no transfer materialized. Gündogan has already met with Thomas Tuchel, and is considering staying on after hearing his plans.\n\n\"There are several things in favor of Ilkay finding a way back to his old level and doing that in a familiar, comfortable environment,\" added the midfielder's uncle. Even club chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke believes there is \"certainly a chance\" of Gündogan extending his deal.\n\nThe talented 24-year-old had been out with a back injury for 14 months before he returned in December last year, but has struggled to recapture his sparkling form of 2013.\n\nDortmund, German champions in 2011 and 2012 and Champions League finalists in 2013, finished seventh in the Bundesliga last season and will find out on July 17 who their opponents will be in the third round of qualifying for next season's Europa League.\n\njh/apc (Reuters, SID)"
