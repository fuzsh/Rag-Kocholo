        "text": "Ilkay Gundogan's services could become available once again this summer, despite only joining Barcelona.\n\nThe 32-year-old joined the La Liga champions on a free transfer after leaving Manchester City. There were a number of clubs interested in the midfielder, with Arsenal reportedly offering him a two-year contract to join Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nGundogan has featured in Barca's pre-season schedule this summer, but he could now be on the move once again. football.london has taken a look at all the latest transfer chatter regarding the former Borussia Dortmund star's future.\n\nSurprise exit clause\n\nIlkay Gundogan will be allowed to leave Barcelona for free on Sunday if he isn't registered in time for the start of the 2023/24 season.\n\nAccording to Forbes, there is a clause in his contract that allows him to leave the club on a free if they don't register him before their La Liga opener against Getafe on Sunday.\n\nReports in Spain have also claimed that Barcelona would have to pay Gundogan for an entire year, a situation they certainly don't want to happen.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal win Premier League, Nicolas Jackson fires for Chelsea - Writers make 2023/24 predictions\n\nBarcelona deal 'agreed'\n\nArsenal's pursuit of Ilkay Gundogan looks set to conclude after Barcelona agreed personal terms with the midfielder.\n\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, the German international has agreed a two-year-deal in Spain and with an option for a further year.\n\nMan City 'release' Gundogan\n\nMan City have announced their release list ahead of the new season and Gundogan is included in the list.\n\nJudging by the list, it would appear that the 32-year-old is set to become a free agent from June 30. However, the Manchester Evening News have claimed that he has to appear on the list even if there is still a chance he could stay as talks over an extension continue.\n\nBarcelona advantage\n\nBarcelona have stepped up their interest in Gundogan in recent days by offering the German an improved three-year contract offer.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Barca boss Xavi has been in contact with Gundogan and has enlightened the former Borussia Dortmund star of his vision for next season. Yet there are concerns within the Catalonia club over the possibility of a deal being completed, as they are unable to guarantee he will be registered under La Liga rules.\n\nDecision timeframe\n\nIlkay Gundogan is set to make a decision on his Manchester City in the coming weeks amid talk of a potential transfer to Barcelona and Arsenal.\n\nAccording to Fabrizio Romano, the 32-year-old has received a three-year contract from Barca, as well as a one-year offer with an additional 12-month option from City. There is also interest from a number of Saudi Arabian clubs.\n\nMertesacker offers Arsenal hope\n\nArsenal academy manager Per Mertesacker has spoken openly about the prospect of his former German international teammate signing for the Gunners this summer.\n\nSpeaking as a pundit for German broadcaster ZDF, via Metro, Mertesacker said the City's Champions League final victory could convince his comptariot to leave the Etihad. \"To say, okay, mission accomplished\", the former centre-back said when discussing the impact the Citizens' treble win could have on Gundogan's future.\n\nMertesacker continued by saying: \"I think the clubs are queuing. Because Arteta knows him and we probably haven’t broken off contact, we’re in a good position.\n\n\"I think he’ll let it all sink in first and then choose from one of the four clubs.\"\n\nFour options revealed\n\nAccording to Spanish outlet Marca, Gundogan has four offers on the table when it comes to choosing what to do with his future.\n\nIt is claimed that a new deal at City, as well as a potential move to Arsenal, PSG or Barcelona, are the prolific midfielder's four main options. Julian Nagelsmann, who looks set to be the next PSG manager, is said to be a huge fan of the German international, persuading the French club to enter the race to sign him.\n\nArteta's triple blow\n\nArsenal 'cannot compete' in the battle to sign Ilkay Gundogan, according to Spanish outlet Sport.\n\nThe report states there are three reasons why a move to Arsenal seems unlikely for the Man City star. Firstly, the Gunners are unable to offer the three-year deal that Barcelona have proposed - instead offering only two.\n\nSecondly, the midfielder is said to be keen on a change of environment and a move to sunny Spain is attracting Gundogan and his family. Finally, if he was to stay in the Premier League, he would remain at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nCity contract breakthrough\n\nGundogan is set to agree a new contract with Manchester City, according to The Sun.\n\nTheir report claims that the former Borussia Dortmund star won't be leaving the Etihad Stadium at the end of the month, when his current deal is set to expire.\n\nBarcelona advantage\n\nAccording to Sport, Gundogan is ready to 'close the chapter' on his spell in the Premier League and has been convinced to join La Liga giants Barcelona.\n\nThe veteran midfielder is claimed to have been offered a three-year contract by Barcelona, an additional 12 months to the initial two-year proposal.\n\nGundogan breaks silence\n\nIlkay Gundogan has broken his silence on his Manchester City future amid links to both Arsenal and Barcelona.\n\nSpeaking about his next steps to the BBC after the FA Cup final win over Manchester United, Gundogan said: \"To be honest, I do not need these kinds of days to feel appreciated at this club, I know that.\n\n\"That is why I am here already for seven years, with all the ups and downs that I have had so far. Nothing is decided yet so we are going to see what is going to happen.\"\n\nGuardiola stance\n\nAn update on Ilkay Gundogan's future has now been provided by Sky Sports reporter Dharmesh Sheth which is not good reading for Arsenal.\n\nSpeaking to Give Me Sport, via The Boot Room, he said: \"It would be an incredible way to bookmark his Manchester City career if, as captain, he wins the treble and lifts all three of those trophies. Where do you go from there?\n\n\"But Pep Guardiola’s thinking is this guy is priceless and someone who is a first-team player. Yes, he’s in his 30s, but that doesn’t matter.\n\n\"Look at the influence he has on the pitch and off the pitch as well. They desperately want him to stay.\"\n\nMan City contract stance\n\nManchester City are ready to hand Ilkay Gundogan a two-year deal to warn off interest from Barcelona, according to The Mirror.\n\nThe German's deal is winding down and there had been fears he would quit the Etihad Stadium and seek pastures new. Negotiations had hit a wall with City seemingly unwilling to offer the midfielder more than a 12-month extension, but now a U-turn has been made by the champions.\n\nThey are ready to offer a one-year extension with the option of a further 12 months, which could tempt Gundogan into staying, although no decision has yet been made. The former Borussia Dortmund man remains an integral figure in the blue half of Manchester and would be a massive loss.\n\nArsenal hold 'concrete interest' in Gundogan\n\nA report from The Athletic states that Arsenal are determined to sign Declan Rice and Mason Mount this summer, but may require an additional player in that department if Xhaka joins Bayer Leverkusen. The report adds that the Gunners hold a concrete interest in Gundogan and Arteta is the driving factor behind it, having worked with the 32-year-old German at the Etihad Stadium and identified him as the ideal replacement for Xhaka.\n\nCity are set to make fresh efforts to convince Gundogan to stay with Pep Guardiola's team but the German has other possibilities to join the likes of Barcelona. As things stand, no agreements have been reached and the situation is still open.\n\nBarcelona transfer stance\n\nManchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan is Barcelona's number one target to reinforce their midfield for next season, according to Spanish news outlet Marca. The club's technical department have been working on the operation for several weeks now, bearing in mind that the player's contract expires on June 30.\n\nThe talks are said to be going very well, but there are still a couple of vital issues to be resolved. Due to the fact the German is available on a free transfer, Barcelona are legally allowed to discuss terms with him.\n\nAt the moment, there has been no formal offer for the player. However, there has been talk of interest and what Barcelona would be willing to pay him as a salary.\n\nThe club's main objective in the initial talks was to find out Gundogan's willingness to leave the Premier League and sign for Los Cules. The response was positive, the report said, and the German would be willing to take on a new challenge in his career, such as coming to La Liga.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nChelsea make clear transfer statement to Arsenal amid £34.2m Man City deal and Granit Xhaka exit"
