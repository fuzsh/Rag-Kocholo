        "text": "FC Barcelona have agreed to sign Ilkay Gundogan from Manchester City, according to SPORT.\n\nFollowing his masterclass in City's 3-0 Champions League quarter-final first leg win over Bayern Munich this week, Mateu Alemany and Jordi Cruyff met with the player's uncle and agent, Ihan Gundogan, at the club on Thursday.\n\nThe pair have an amicable relationship with Ihan Gundogan, given that he also represents center back Andreas Christensen. In success that Ihan Gundogan's nephew will look to replicate, Christensen has proved one of the bargains of the season after arriving on a free from Chelsea last summer.\n\nThe Dane has become a mainstay in Europe's best defense, which has conceded just nine goals in La Liga with Barca in line to win their first Spanish top flight crown in four years.\n\nIlkay Gundogan's contract ends on June 30, and after knocking back renewal offers from City, where has has been since 2016, the 32-year-old has decided to join FC Barcelona with his team working on the move for weeks.\n\nGundogan has agreed to a two-year deal with an additional, optional 12 months which will pay him €12 million ($13.3 million) a season, according to SPORT.\n\nIf these figures are accurate, this works against president Joan Laporta's policy of no player earning more than €10 million ($11 million) per term - though this will be broken for Gundogan's former Borussia Dortmund teammate Robert Lewandowski.\n\nAccording to MARCA, Lewandowski's contract sees him earn a net salary of €10 million ($11 million) this season which rises to €13 million ($14 million) in 2023/2024 and €16 million ($17.25 million) in 2024/2025. In 2025/2026, it returns to €13 million ($14 million) after which the Pole will no longer be tied to the club.\n\nBack to Gundogan, his showing this week against Dortmund's bitter rivals Bayern showed that he is still cut out for the biggest stage despite his advanced years. The veteran can bring much added experience to a young Blaugrana squad, while also having a positive influence on the likes of Pedri and Gavi in the center of the park.\n\nIf the cash is somehow freed up, Barca can make an approach for Gundogan's City teammate Bernardo Silva before the summer transfer window closes too."
