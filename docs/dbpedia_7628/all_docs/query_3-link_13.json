        "text": "It is that time of year when fans are full of hope. No matter what happened last season, the summer brings belief that things could be better next term. Supporters draw up possible XIs for the coming campaign as a short stop to the action sees transfer rumours dominate the headlines. Fantasy football is the order of the day.\n\nDue to the enforced break for the World Cup in November and December, the 2022-23 season only finished in June and the transfer window then opened mid-month. And from July 1, clubs can officially register their new players. Many have sought to do business early this time, with a number of deals already announced. And in Europe, most of the high-profile transfers so far have involved midfielders.\n\nJude Bellingham has moved from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid as Los Blancos continue to rejuvenate their midfield. From Birmingham to the Bernabéu via Borussia Dortmund, the 20-year-old is not the typical English player. After moving to Germany at the age of 17, he was named Player of the Season in the Bundesliga last term and impressed for England at the World Cup. He joins Eduardo Camavinga (20), Aurelien Tchouaméni (23) and Fede Valverde (24) in midfield, plus forwards Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo (both 22) as part of a youthful core at Real Madrid. He can also learn from Luka Modrić (37) and Toni Kroos (33), who have each signed short contract extensions with Los Blancos.\n\nEnglish players have not always done well at the Bernabéu, but Bellingham is an all-action, box-to-box midfielder who can win the ball back, drive forward, assist his team-mates and score goals. His potential is enormous and his dynamic style should add another dimension to Madrid’s midfield. Expect him to change some stereotypes in Spain.\n\nBarcelona’s midfield will also have a new look in 2023-24. For the first time since 2008, there will be no Sergio Busquets in the pivot position for the Catalan club as the World Cup winner opted to leave Camp Nou. He has since agreed to link up with former team-mate Lionel Messi at Inter Miami. Barça have yet to replace Busquets, but did move quickly to sign Ilkay Gündoğan on a free transfer from Manchester City.\n\nAnother former Borussia Dortmund player, the German international’s style of football feels like an ideal fit for Xavi’s side. He was Pep Guardiola’s first signing at City and is the type of player who makes others around him better: he sets the tempo, keeps possession ticking over and as he showed in the FA Cup final, he can also score unbelievable goals. He is 32 years of age, but still has much to offer and should slot in seamlessly at Barça. It will be fun to watch.\n\nWith Gündoğan gone, Manchester City have brought in Mateo Kovačić from Chelsea in a four-year deal and have also been linked with a move for Celta Vigo’s in-demand youngster Gabri Veiga. Kovačić, who was previously seen as a long-term replacement for Modrić at Real Madrid, is an elite ball carrier who should benefit greatly from working with Pep Guardiola. Veiga, meanwhile, is wanted by a number of Europe’s elite clubs including Chelsea and is one of the most exciting talents around. The 21-year-old can play as a central midfielder or in a more attacking role. And although a period of adaptation will be needed as he seeks greater consistency and discipline, he looks to have all the attributes to succeed in the Premier League.\n\nCity had also been interested in signing West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, but were unwilling to meet the Irons’ valuation for the England international. Rice now seems set to join Arsenal instead for a reported £105 million. That will make him the most expensive British player ever and while he is surely not worth that amount, he looks like an excellent signing for the Gunners. The 24-year-old is already one of the best defensive midfielders in the world and he will have better players around him at Arsenal, as well as a manager in Mikel Arteta who understands his position better than most. With both Granit Xhaka and Thomas Partey expected to leave and Champions League football returning to the Emirates next season, the north London club will probably need to bring in another midfielder this summer, though.\n\nAcross the north London divide, Tottenham beat off competition from Newcastle to sign James Maddison from Leicester City. Spurs have been crying out for a creative player in midfield in recent seasons and Maddison’s arrival signals a change of direction as new manager Ange Postecoglou promises an attacking brand of football in keeping with the club’s traditions. If Harry Kane stays, the striker should benefit from Maddison’s vision and creativity in a new-look Spurs side. Maddison revealed Postecoglou had told him: ‘Whether you come or not, you’re going to see a completely different Spurs team under me.’ The Australian favours a 4-3-3 formation, with two number eights either side of a deep-lying midfielder (probably Rodrigo Bentancur) and that should suit Maddison’s skill set.\n\nLiverpool were the visitors at Brighton last season when the actual World Cup was paraded at the Amex for Alexis Mac Allister following Argentina’s win in Qatar. Mac Allister returned to the Seagulls’ starting line-up that day and played the full 90 minutes as Brighton knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup just a couple of weeks later. Manager Jürgen Klopp clearly liked what he saw and the Reds quickly wrapped up a deal to take the Argentine to Anfield this summer, reportedly for an initial £35 million. Mac Allister has excellent technical ability, with impressive close control in tight spaces. His positioning and awareness allow him to drift into dangerous areas and his progressive passes will be an asset to the Anfield club. Meanwhile, Liverpool are also in talks with RB Leipzig’s versatile Hungarian Dominik Szoboszlai, who can play across the midfield. James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are all leaving the club this summer.\n\nDespite spending £600m in the last two transfer windows, Chelsea seem set to splash the cash again. The Blues have already let a number of midfielders leave the club this summer: N’Golo Kanté has gone to Saudi Arabia, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek has moved to AC Milan and Mason Mount is close to joining Manchester United. Gabri Veiga, who has a £34.6m release clause, is said to be their top target as a replacement for the England midfielder, but Chelsea will face competition from City for the Spaniard. The Blues are also keen on Brighton’s Moisés Caicedo, even if addressing last season’s problems in front of goal looks to be the biggest issue for new manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nBrighton expect to lose Caicedo as well as Mac Allister, but Dortmund midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud looks like a shrewd signing and James Milner will add experience for the Seagulls’ first-ever season in Europe. Aston Villa will also be in Europe and Unai Emery has brought in Youri Tielemans following Leicester’s relegation in what appears another solid transfer.\n\nJuly has only just started and there will be many more moves completed yet, with minimal activity outside the Premier League and Saudi Arabia to date. But the midfields of 2023-24 are already starting to take shape and with so many teams changing their personnel in the centre of the park this summer, there will be a lot of clubs playing slightly different football next season. Watch this space."
