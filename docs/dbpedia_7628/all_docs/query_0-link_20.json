        "text": "Ilkay Gündogan, who was set to leave Borussia Dortmund this summer, could stay on under their new coach Thomas Tuchel.\n\n“This is clearly an option again,” his agent and uncle Ilhan Gündogan told Süddeutsche Zeitung when asked whether the player might make a potential U-turn and stay at Dortmund or even sign a contract extension.\n\n“There are several things in favour of Ilkay finding back to his old level and doing that in a familiar, comfortable environment.”\n\nThe Germany international had said in April he would not be renewing a contract that runs out in 2016 and was said to be in talks with a number of clubs for an immediate transfer.\n\nThe talented 24-year-old had been out of action for 14 months before returning from a back injury in December last year. But a possible transfer to the English Premier League, Spain or even Bayern Munich did not materialise.\n\nAfter the departure of the coach Jürgen Klopp at the end of the season, Tuchel, a former Mainz 05 coach, was appointed as his successor.\n\nIlhan Gündogan said his newphew had “now been thinking about” a possible stay after hearing Tuchel’s plans for next season."
