        "text": "Earlier this week, kicker reported that Juventus were interested in signing Gundogan, who has been touted as a replacement for Andrea Pirlo, while Barcelona wanted him to succeed Xavi Hernandez.\n\n\"Is that true? I'll definitely take that as a compliment,\" Gundogan told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, but added that his Germany teammate Sami Khedira has so far not tried to convince him to join Juve.\n\nGundogan said that a move abroad \"one day\" would tempt him, adding: \"But you always have to find the perfect moments, and currently I am very happy at BVB.\"\n\nThe midfielder admitted that playing in the Champions League in the future is a must for him -- with Dortmund in this season's Europa League -- and he is confident the club can return to the competition next term.\n\n\"The Champions League is just too appealing,\" he said. \"But as things look right now, we will qualify and hear the Champions League anthem in our stadium again.\"\n\nHowever, Gundogan could not say whether he will still be at the Westfalenstadion next season to play in Europe's top club competition should Dortmund qualify.\n\n\"To be honest, there are never any guarantees for that,\" he said. \"But I still have a contract, and like I've said, I feel great at Dortmund now.\""
