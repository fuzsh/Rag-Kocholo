        "text": "In October 2007, US Internet giant AOL bought Israeli company Quigo, founded by Yaron Galai and Oded Itzhak, for $325 million. Now, Israeli start-up Outbrain, founded by Galai and Ori Lahav, is buying a company from AOL.\n\nYesterday, Outbrain bought Surphace Technology and other assets from AOL. The purchase price was not disclosed, but estimates of the price tag range from hundreds of thousands to a few million dollars.\n\nOutbrain was founded in 2007, as the sale agreement for Quigo was being negotiated. Its product is a platform for rating and recommending content on blogs, news sites, and via RSS. Through the acquisition, Outbrain will expand its connections with Internet publishers, in a bid to become the leader in the field.\n\nSurphace Technology was founded in 2005. Its investors include True Ventures, Trident Capital and Hearst. It raised $3.5 million, and in 2008 was sold to AOL for a reported $25 million.\n\nPublished by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on February 3, 2011"
