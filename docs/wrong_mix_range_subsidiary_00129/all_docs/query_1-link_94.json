'Every year we raised money for charities in Israel. Mark was one of the members of the fraternity, like many other Jewish students at Harvard.'\n\nHasit, who wears a skullcap, says the 25-year-old Zuckerberg feels an affinity with Judaism. 'He fasts on Yom Kippur,' Hasit says of Zuckerberg. 'Sometimes he would come to the Hillel House, a Jewish organization that ran various activities.' \"[SIZE=+3][/SIZE][SIZE=+3][SIZE=+3][/SIZE][/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+3][SIZE=+3][SIZE=-1]- The Jew Ariel Hasit, who now has joined the Israeli Defense Forces, on his personal experience of the Jewish Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Haaretz, 10/05/2009.[/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE][/SIZE]​\n\n[SIZE=+3][SIZE=+3][/SIZE][/SIZE]\n\n[/SIZE]​\n\n[SIZE=+2]Jewish founder and CEO[/SIZE]\n\nThe popular social networking site Facebook, launched in February 2004, has a 100% Jewish founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nJews readily boast about this fact. The Jewish etnocentrist site Jew or Not Jew: Choosing the Chosen People, see logo below, have a special entry for Zuckerberg (as they have for Googles Sergey Brin and Larry Page), where Zuckerberg gets their \"Jew Score\" total of 12 (4 + 4 + 4).\n\nSee: http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=369 .\n\nThe site, which should be reagarded as some case of internal Jewish humour, explains the meaning of this score:\n\n[SIZE=+1]About the Jew Score[/SIZE]We evaluate how Jewish a person is based on three factors. How Jewish they are internally, how Jewish they are externally and how much we want that person to be a Jew in the first place.\n\nIn practice, the I Score tends to refer to birth history with some adjustments for how we imagine they see/saw themselves. The O Score is for how Jewish they look and act. The K Score stands for Kvell (pride) and is subject to the whims of the creators of this website.\n\nThe Jew Score refers to our opinion only and is affected by but not definitive of one's actual Jewishness.\n\n​\n\nThe site of the World Jewish Digest, as another example, also counts Mark Zuckerberg as one of their examples of Jewish influentials in their list \"10 to watch in 2008 - WJSs shortlist to Jewish standouts\" . Zuckerberg, \"born into a well-to-do Jewish-American family in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y\", gets the rankning place of 3 in their list of 10 influential Jews.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Mark Zuckerberg[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]Zuckerbergs Jewish entourage at Facebook[/SIZE]\n\nThe New York Times, May 13, 2009, reported:\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz noted that Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, a Jewish former Harvard University student.Mr. Schnitt [a Facebook spokesman] told ABC that while some employees of the social-networking service came from families marked by the Holocaust, that was not influencing their decision:\n\nMany of us at Facebook have direct personal connection to the Holocaust, through parents who were forced to flee Europe or relatives who could not escape. We believe in Facebooks mission that giving people tools to make the world more open is a better way to combat ignorance or deception than censorship, though we recognize that others, including those at the company, disagree.​\n\nSo here we learn from the Facebook spokesman Mr. Schnitt that \"many of us at Facebook have direct personal connection to the Holocaust\", which of course means nothing else than that they are Jewish.\n\nSo who are these Jewish actors?\n\nTo begin with, in the absolute beginning, when Zuckerberg decided to spread his new Facebook project to other schools than Harvard, he enlisted help from his Jewish friend Dustin Moskovitz. Moskovitz then became the Vice President of Engineering of Facebook.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Dustin Moskovitz[/SIZE]\n\nThey got their first funding from another Jew, German-born technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of the founders of PayPal.\n\nWe here recommend reading an article from the The Guardian (14 Jan, 2008) on the people behind Facebook which has more information on Thiel. The Guardian concludes that:\n\n\"... the real face behind Facebook is the 40-year-old Silicon Valley venture capitalist and futurist philosopher Peter Thiel.\"​\n\n[SIZE=-1]Peter Thiel[/SIZE]\n\nAs a typical Jewish etnocentrist Thiel prefers to deal with other Jews. His business partner with whom he who founded PayPal is the Ukrainan-born now-American Jew Max Rafael Levchin.\n\n[SIZE=-1]David Sacks[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=-1]George Zachary[/SIZE]\n\nOther Jews Thiel is interacting with are David Sacks, PayPal's former chief operating officer, and George Zachary, \"a friend of Max and Peter's\" and partner of the Jew Ed Skoll from eBay.\n\nBelow follows an excerpt from \"Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good: The Rebirth of Silicon Valley and the Rise of Web 2.0\", by Sarah Lacy, (see: http://www.metroactive.com/metro/06.11.08/cover-supermen-0824.html) on Thiels \"PayPal mafia\":\n\nThe PayPal mafia even had Hollywood success. Jeff Skoll was one of the first eBay executives who became friends with the PayPal crew when eBay bought the company in 2002. He started up Participant Productions on a lark, and it has been one of the most profitable productions companies in Hollywood. Among its first four films were Syriana, Good Night, and Good Luck, North Country, and An Inconvenient Truth. Skoll's success convinced Max and Peter to start dabbling in Hollywood, bankrolling the 2006 indie flick Thank You for Smoking, along with David Sacks, PayPal's former chief operating officer.While Sacks continued to play the Hollywood game, he also launched a new social networking site for families, called Geni.com. It allows people to fill out their family trees and link them to the family trees of spouses and in-laws. Anyone on the tree can add to the tree, the idea being that over time you discover people you're related to that you didn't know. It's a bold idea, one of the first Web 2.0 start-ups aimed squarely at families. Peter Thiel, naturally, backed it early on. And in Geni's first venture capital round with Charles River Ventures, it got nosebleed $100 million valuation. The CRV partner who wrote the check was George Zachary, Skoll's early partner in Participant Productions and a friend of Max and Peter's. By 2006, the PayPal mafia was an incestuous world where, for now, everyone seemed to be making lots of money.\n\n​\n\nThiel makes up one fourth of the Board members of Facebook. Thus apart from providing the money, he really has a lot of influence - just as The Guardian had noted.\n\n[SIZE=+2]Thiel - \"the real face behind Facebook\" - is a Zionist[/SIZE]\n\nWhat The Guardian failed to tell is that Thiel also has an Israel agenda.\n\nThe Israeli-based Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies writes (http://www.adelsoninstitute.org.il/OnAgenda.aspx?id=62&from=a):\n\nOn Tuesday, May 12, 2009, The Adelson Institute hosted Richard Perle, former assistant to the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee during the Reagan administration, and Peter Thiel, Co-Founder of PayPal and President of Clarium Capital Management. The topic of discussion was: The first 100 days of the Obama administration\".Perle briefed the Adleson Institue's staff and faculty and said that the outcome of Obama's new approach towards adversaries will be tested in a few months time.\n\nThiel, who participated in Perle's briefing, said that there is an incredible gap between Israel's reality and its potential. People talk about China, India and Brazil as emerging market countries, he added, while Israel is underrated. According to Thiel, all it takes is a short visit to Israel in order to appreciate the incredible talent, intensity and drive of the Israelis.\n\n​\n\nIt should here be reminded that Richard Perle that Thiel met in a briefing, is the infamous Neo-con from the Bush era who was one of the main Jewish architects behind the Iraq invasion and war in 2003.\n\nFacebook sponsor Peter Thiel reveals his Israel agenda in a video speech he made for the Adelson Institute and which can be seen through the following link: http://www.adelsoninstitute.org.il/MediaViewer.aspx?id=57\n\nThe Adelson Institute gives the following description of Thiels video message:\n\nIsrael is Truly the Country of the Future, May 17, 2009There is an incredible gap between Israel's reality and its potential, says Peter Thiel, Co-Founder of PayPal and President of Clarium Capital Management. Thiel, a guest of the Adelson Institute for Strategic studies, participated in Richard Perle's briefing at the Adelson Institute. People talk about China, India and Brazil as emerging market countries, says Thiel, while Israel is underrated. All it takes is a short visit in order to appreciate the incredible talent, intensity and drive of the Israelis.\n\n​\n\nIn the video Peter Thiel - economic sponsor and Facebook Board member - hails the Jewish state of Israel. Here follows a transcript of some of his statements in the video:\n\n\"I believe that Israel is a truly extraordinary place.\"\"... an incredible potential...\"\n\n\"Just visiting here [in Israel] for a few days one is always struck by the incredible talent and intensity and drive of the people.\"\n\n\"I think that if Israel is able to resolve some of these issues, that surround it over the next few years, it will probably be the best place in the world.\"\n\n\"I believe the future is not in cheap labour or cheap capital or in real estate. I believe the future is in technology and in that sense perhaps Israel is truly the country of the future.\"\n\n​\n\nThe Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem is a 100 % Zionist institution.\n\nWe here reproduce the Mission Statement of the institute Thiel cooperates with:\n\nThe Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem is an academic and research institute founded by its chairman, Natan Sharansky, in 2007. The Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies develops, articulates and builds support for the strategic principles needed to address the challenges currently facing Israel and the West. Israel, as the only democracy in this region surrounded by totalitarian governments, is on the cutting edge of the challenges and dangers confronting Western civilization everywhere.As part of this overall effort, the Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies seeks to explore how the advancement of freedom, democracy, and human rights can be marshaled as an effective measure to secure and strengthen international stability and security. The Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies also seeks to examine international law in light of the new forms of asymmetric warfare and terror; the establishment of credible deterrence against guerilla and terror organizations and the states that sponsor them; the appropriate response to weapons of mass destruction; and the strengthening of Israel's relations with its strategic allies.\n\n​\n\nNatan Sharansky, founder and chairman of the institute, is a racist Russian Jew and Israeli politician (former deputy Prime Minister) famous for his \"tough\" stance on the Palestinians. Palestinian resistance to Zionist domination is branded as \"terrorism\". Sharansky writes in Jan. 15, 2009 (Bloomberg.com) on the ongoing Israeli slaughter in Gaza:\n\nTerrorism is a cancer that cant be cured through proportional treatments. It requires invasive surgery.​\n\nHere follows another article on Peter Thiel and Israel from [vc]cafe (http://www.vccafe.com/2008/01/02/peter-thiel-gambles-on-the-next-internet-hit-israels-hooja/):\n\n[SIZE=+1]Peter Thiel gambles on the next internet hit Israels Hooja[/SIZE]Peter Thiel knows a thing or two about consumer internet. After all, hes a PayPal cofounder, one of Facebooks board members and its first investor ($500,000) way before its $15 billion valuation, giving him a hefty return of a billion. Thiel is known as a savvy investor with a golden touch that tends to invest small amounts early on taking a hands-off approach with management (learn more about his investment strategy in Thiels recent WSJ profile).\n\nApart from Facebook, Thiel invested in some of the internets biggest brand names early on, including: Yelp, Slide, LinkedIn and Friendster.These days, Peter Thiel is managing the hedge fund Clarium Capital, which manages $2 billion under management and hes also a partner in the Founders Fund, that recently raised $220 million for its second fund. Now, for the first time, Thiel is betting an Israeli tech startup, to be the next winner.\n\nGlobes reports that Thiel, along with a group of private investors, raised $1.5 million for Hooja, an Israel-based startup founded in April of 2006 by Naama Moran, a former Greylock Partners associate. Hooja is still operating in stealth mode (landing page only) but its known to be developing a unique search technology that enables content providers to search for personal and social information in the deep web, including social networks. One of Hoojas investors describes the technology as social search basically providing higher ranking to information that a users friends are likely to click on.\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=+2]Other Board members[/SIZE]\n\nThe other Board members of Facebook apart from Thiel are Mark Zuckerberg himself, the Jewish venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and finally Marc Andreessen.\n\nJim Breyer also sits in the Board of Directors of Dell, Walmart and Marvel.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Jim Breyer[/SIZE]\n\nMarc Andreessenis the founder of Netscape (non-Jewish?), but a man who works closely with the Jew Ben Horowitz with whom he founded Opsware. Andreessen has also invested in the Israeli Israel Seed Partners thus becoming a partner of and cooperating with Jonathan Medved, one of Israel's leading venture capitalists. So Andreesen - Jew or not - is well entangled in the Jewish-Israeli Internet establishment.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Ben Horowitz[/SIZE]\n\nIn our section on Google we detailed Sheryl Sandberg, a Jewish woman who was Googles Vice President of Global Online Sales & Operations.\n\nAs Rabbi Levi Brackman and journalist Sam Jaffe write in their book \"Jewish Wisdom for Business Success\", p. 2:\n\nEarly in 2008, she left Google to become the second-in-command of Facebook, the emerging social-networking company.​\n\nThe Jewish \"second-in-command of Facebook\" Sheryl Sandberg is presently Chief Operating Officer. As COO, Sandberg is responsible for helping Facebook scale its operations and expand its presence globally. Sandberg in this position manages sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy, privacy and communications and reports directly to Facebooks CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIt can here be repeated that Sandberg is married to another Jew, David Goldberg,former music head at Yahoo!.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Elliot Schrage[/SIZE]\n\nAnother recruit from Google is the Jew Elliot Schrage, now Vice President of Communications, Public Policy and Platform Marketing at Facebook. In this position he is responsible for developing and coordinating key messages about products, corporate business and partnerships. He also oversees the companys public policy strategy worldwide. At Google Schrage was Vice President of Communications and Public Affairs and in our special section on Google we documented how he worked to promote propaganda together with the Jewish \"US Holocaust Memorial\".\n\nAnother Jew who has had positions of influence in Facebook was Justin Rosenstein,a top engineer who was one of the first employees Facebook poached from Google, where he was a Product Manager, as Facebook began its rise in 2007.\n\nBoth Dusty Moskovitz.and Rosenstein have since left Facebook (2008) to jointly start Internet ventures of their own.\n\nEthan Beard is head of Platform at Facebook. Earlier he was Director of Business Development. Prior to joining Facebook, he was a Director of Social Media at Google.\n\n[SIZE=+2]Facebook and Israel[/SIZE]\n\nThe Jewish state sees the importance in Internet Jews such as Mark Zuckeberg. In 2008 the Israeli paper Haaretz reported:\n\n[SIZE=+1]Facebook, Google founders to attend Jerusalem conference in May[/SIZE]By Guy Grimland, Haaretz Correspondent\n\nHaaretz 01/04/2008\n\nCo-founder of internet giant Google, Sergey Brin, will join Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and Yahoo president Susan Decker at a presidential panel on technology to be held at the Jerusalem International Convention Center May 13-15.\n\nThe convention, which was formed at the initiative of President Shimon Peres, will also be attended by a number of Israeli political, religious and financial leaders, as well as academics and cultural figures.\n\nThe panel will discuss issues facing technology in today's age and the future, in particular in regard to how it will affect Israel and the Jewish world.\n\nFormer UK prime minister Tony Blair will also take part in the conference, as will French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former prime minister of the Czech Republic Vaclev Havel, Nobel Prize Laureate Eli Wiesel, and Georgia President Michael Saakashvili\n\n​\n\nHere we see how the young Jewish entrepreneur Zuckerberg, with fellow Internet-Jew Sergey Brin, is invited down to the Jewish state to participate in the celebrations of Israels 60th anniversary (which was the reason the meeting was held) and to meet with the top Zionist echelons.\n\n(It should here be noted that Shimon Peres is a war criminal. In 1996 he was responsible, as the leader if the Jewish state, of Israels massacre of over 100 Lebanese civilians in Qana.)\n\nOn March 11th, 2008, Nick O'Neill posted an interview with Mark Zuckerberg where they touched on the subject of \"anti-Semitism\" and Internet:\n\nRecently Shimon Peres suggested that Israelis and Jews worldwide use Facebook to fight anti-semitism in addition to inviting Mark Zuckerberg to Israel. I asked him about his thoughts on Facebook as a tool to fight anti-semitism and if Facebook would take proactive measures to fight against it. Mark believes that Facebook need to focus on building useful communication tools and that the users can use these tools to connect and generate more worldly perspectives. As such Facebook does not need to be proactive about it. When asked about whether he will visit Israel next year, he said maybe.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Mark Zuckerberg (left) with fellow Jewish Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz (center) [/SIZE]​\n\n[SIZE=+2]First Facebook user has joined the IDF[/SIZE]\n\nA quite telling detail is that the first real user of Facebook, apart from the co-founders, is a Jew, Arie Hasit (who carries the Facebook URL id 7). Hasit studied with Zuckerberg in Harvard and later on did what the Jews call Aliyah to Israel, that is he settled in occupied Palestine in accordance to the JewishLaw of Return. Hasit has since joined the Israel Defense Forces Spokespersons Unit, a propaganda/desinformation unit of the IDF.\n\nThe Israeli paper Haaretz ran a piece on Hasit and Facebook 10/05/2009 (underlines below added by Radio Islam):\n\n[SIZE=+2]Facebook founder's roommate recounts creation of Internet giant[/SIZE]By Guy Grimland, Haaretz Correspondent\n\nFive years ago, hardly anybody had heard of Facebook. Today, it seems that there is nobody in Israel or the world over who is not familiar with the social networking Web site, which recently crossed the 200 million user threshold. Facebook is estimated to be worth $15 billion after Microsoft bought 1.6 percent stock in the company for $240 million.\n\nArie Hasit, 26, witnessed the birth of Facebook. He shared the same apartment as Mark Zuckerberg, the site's founder, joined the same college fraternity, and witnessed first-hand the company's initial climb from a dormitory start-up to a dominant mega-monstrosity on the Web.\n\nHasit grew up in Philadelphia. Since he was young, he dreamed of immigrating to Israel, which he did two years ago. Today he is serving in the Israel Defense Forces Spokespersons Unit. He chose to enlist for a year-and-a-half rather than the six months which are required of new immigrants in his age bracket. Israel is not foreign to him.\n\n\"Every summer I was in Jewish summer camp in the U.S. From time to time I would visit Israel.\"\n\nAfter completing high school at age 18, he enrolled at Harvard University, where he studied the history of the Land of Israel. \"I thought this would make it easier for me after I would get to Israel,\" Hasit said. \"My parents actually thought I should learned computers so that I would work in high-tech when I got here.\"\n\nHasit focused his studies on the hip-hop genre in Israel, a subject which would become the topic of his thesis. He met Mark Zuckerberg in 2002 after they had joined the same fraternity which primarily concentrated on activities within the Jewish community.\n\n\"We ate Shabbat dinner together,\" Hasit said. \"Every year we raised money for charities in Israel. Mark was one of the members of the fraternity, like many other Jewish students at Harvard.\"\n\nHasit, who wears a skullcap, says the 25-year-old Zuckerberg feels an affinity with Judaism. \"He fasts on Yom Kippur,\" Hasit says of Zuckerberg. \"Sometimes he would come to the Hillel House, a Jewish organization that ran various activities.\"\n\nHasit and Zuckerberg struck up a friendship, though they were not the closest of friends. They later lived together in the college dorms.\n\n\"Mark just happened to live in the apartment where I lived in the dorms,\" Hasit said. \"He was in one room while I was in the other. This was a large apartment, we were seven students crammed into five bedrooms. We saw each other every day for a number of hours. When Mark moved into the dorms I was already in my third year while he was in his second year.\"\n\nHasit says that Zuckerberg decided one day to build a Web site that would serve as a utility for students at Harvard. \"He built the site for fun,\" Hasit says. \"We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was 'hotter' and according to the votes there would be a ranking.\"\n\n\"He only ranked people who received the most votes for being good looking, not everybody,\" Hasit said. \"There were about 1,000 people in all. Within four, five hours the site became so popular that at one point it became impossible to surf the Web on Harvard's Internet server. This was on a Sunday in October 2003.\"\n\n\"The next day, the head of the university denied Zuckerberg access to the Internet. People complained that Mark used their pictures without permission. He apologized and ultimately the university decided not to expel him even though there were columns in the campus newspaper that argued that what he did was completely improper.\"\n\nZuckerberg's stunt came at a time when students were appealing to the university to develop a Web site that would include the pictures and contact details of students in dorms. Now they feared that the Zuckerberg episode would compel the administration to shelve the idea.\n\n\"Mark heard these pleas and decided that if the university won't do something about it, he will, and he would build a site that would be even better than what the university had planned,\" Hasit said. \"Before founding Facebook, he built the site Course Match which allowed students to find out who among those living in the same dorm are taking what courses, so that they could form study groups.\"\n\nZuckerberg started developing Facebook from his modest dorm room. Every visitor who registered at the site received a serial number. The first, second, and third user who registered took up dummy pages. The fourth user was Zuckerberg himself.\n\nThe fifth user is Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook who also served as the company's spokesperson. Dustin Moskovitz, the third part of the site's founding triumvirate, occupies the sixth user spot. Moskovitz led the technical staff at Facebook before quitting the company to found a start-up in 2008.\n\nHasit's is the seventh registered user, which in practice makes him the fourth real user to log into Facebook. \"Often people ask me how I became the fourth user. Sometimes I tell them.\"\n\n\"Mark came to me on the day he built Facebook, and he said to me, 'Arie, I built this site. I want you to sign up.' And that is how I signed up to Facebook. I put a favorite quote of mine in the profile. I specified my favorite books, which courses I take at Harvard. I uploaded one picture to the profile. There was no Wall. There was no News Feed. There weren't too many things in Facebook, which only began its lifespan on the Web.\n\n\"Initially Zuckerberg asked a small group of people to sign up to Facebook. At a certain point he told us to start inviting friends, and that is what we did on the first and second day which the site went up on the Web. We could only invite students enrolled at Harvard. In fact, if you did not have a Harvard e-mail address you could not sign into Facebook. At first, dozens of Harvard students registered. The numbers then reached the hundreds, and by the fourth day it had already reached the thousands. People were very enthusiastic about the site. It enabled them to know who took what courses and to meet new people. It conquered Harvard. In less than a week, some 4,000 students signed up for Facebook.\"\n\nHasit recalls how Zuckerberg spent hours in front of the computer. \"He studied computers and psychology,\" Hasit said. \"Despite the fact that he developed Facebook, he continued his studies as per usual. His grades were okay. He was even in a relationship with a girlfriend. During Facebook's initial days, the walls in his room were filled with graphs and charts which showed how many people joined on a daily basis, who used what application, and who has the most friends.\"\n\n\"After a few weeks, he decided to open up Facebook to another university. He had two friends, one at Stanford and the other at Dartmouth, whom he asked to promote the site there. He also asked for help from his ex-girlfriend who was a student at Dartmouth.\"\n\nFacebook quickly attracted a following in other leading universities. \"Every user specified which university he belonged to, and that was how he kept in touch with other students at the university in which he studied, but all the networks were under one Web site.\"\n\n\"The graphs and charts in his room became graphs and charts which included statistics from all the universities. At one point he received requests from students at other universities who were not in Facebook to open the site to them as well.\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=+3]Wikipedia[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]What is Wikipedia?[/SIZE]\n\nWikipedia is an Internet encyclopedia that anyone can edit and add information.\n\nWikipedia claims its articles are based on a \"neutral point of view\" but as it is human beings writing the articles, of course the contents quickly have been mixed up with politics. For instance organization like CIA have tried to affect the entries (see BBC:s \"Wikipedia 'shows CIA page edits' \"), and big companies try to control the information on themselves. And Israel and its army of \"cyber-soldier\" Jews from all over the world are now doing the same...\n\nThe Wikipedia project has ended into control of student research on the Internet.\n\nThe situation is now that the majority of subjects Googled will show Wikipedia as the top - or one of the firts top results - and thus Wikipedia will get the majority of the hits.\n\nAnd as shown in our section on Google this Internet search-engine is well in the hands of Zionist Jews and also cooperates openly with Zionist organizations such as ADL and the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) to control the searches and censoring information and certain sites.\n\nThis means that apart from Wikipedia other sites may be censored when Googling any given subject.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Larry Sanger[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]Wikipedias Jewish founders[/SIZE][SIZE=+1] [/SIZE][SIZE=+2]- Wales and Sanger[/SIZE]\n\nFrom all the available information it appears Wikipedia was started by two Jews, one a programmer, and the other an 'Adult Site' operator.\n\nThe origins are in a project called Nupedia launched in March 2000 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.\n\nThe Jew Jimmy Wales (actually James Wales,or also known as \"Jimbo\"), with riches from his time as an options trader, became an Internet entrepreneur and decided to create a free, online encyclopedia. He recruited the Jew Larry Sanger, who was finishing a Ph.D. in philosophy at the Ohio State University - whom Wales knew from their joint participation in online mailing lists and Usenet discussion groups - to become the paid editor in chief. Waless company Bomis, an Internet search portal and a vendor of online erotic images (featuring the Bomis Babe Report), picked up the tab initially.\n\nThe Jewish computer programmer Ben Kovitz is the one who suggested to Larry Sanger, Nupedia's editor-in-chief, to transfer the online encyclopedia to a wiki support. Larry and Jimmy Wales accepted and from that time, Wikipedia took over Nupedia and became a huge success.\n\nLarry Sanger, one of the two recognized cofounders, is openly Jewish. In their rabblings of what different famous Jews are doing The Jewish Chroniclementions Sanger in an article \"Larry Sanger... creates a new Wikipedia\", The Jewish Chronicle, 26 October 2006, p. 10.\n\nWales is presently in charge. Sanger left in 2002, and is a professor/lecturer at Ohio State.\n\nJimmy Wales\n\n[SIZE=+2]Jimmy Wales History[/SIZE]\n\nJimmy Wales is the de facto leader of Wikipedia and as thus wields a lot of influence. Time Magazine named him in its 2006 list of the world's most influential people.\n\nShort history: Wales who was born in Huntsville, Alabama, went to the exclusive Randolph prep school, and onto the University of Alabama. Wales graduated and became a Futures Trader in Chicago. Next he opened Bomis, an 'Adult Content' website, which was followed by Nupedia, which morphed into Wikipedia.\n\nWales is the darling of the Jewish crowd at Harvard, being a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, at the Harvard Law School.\n\n[SIZE=+2]What is Bomis.Com?[/SIZE]\n\nBasically 'Bomis' is an adult site, started by Wales.\n\nThe website featured user-generated webrings and that, according to The Atlantic Monthly (September 2006), \"found itself positioned as the Playboy of the Internet\". For a time the company sold erotic photographs, and Wales described the site as a \"guy-oriented search engine\".\n\n[SIZE=-1]Jimmy Wales with Bomis babes[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=-1]a Bomis babe - financing Wikipedia[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]Jewish employees[/SIZE]\n\nNames like Jeremy Rosenfeld (a Bomis employee), Benjamin Kovitz, Seth Cohen, dot the landscape of technical staff.\n\n[SIZE=+2]Wales editing interventions[/SIZE]\n\nIt should here be noted that although Wikipedia states that it professes a \"neutral point of view\" the on-line dictionary has even seen direct interventions from its owner Jimmy Wales over its contents. The Herald Sun reports June 30, 2009, in the article \"Wikipedia edits helped free David Rohde\":\n\nTHE New York Times worked with Wikipedia to keep news of the kidnapping of one of its reporters in Afghanistan off the online user-edited encyclopedia.New York Times reporter David Rohde, who was kidnapped by the Taliban in November, escaped from his captors along with his translator this month.\n\nA number of news organisations, including Agence France-Presse, at the request of the New York Times, agreed not to report the kidnapping out of concerns for their safety.\n\nKeeping the news off Wikipedia was another matter, the Times said.\n\nIt said that on at least a dozen occasions, user-editors posted news of the abduction on a Wikipedia page about Mr Rohde, only to have it erased.\n\nSeveral times the page was frozen, preventing further editing, it said.\n\n\"The sanitising was a team effort, led by Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, along with Wikipedia administrators and people at the Times,'' the newspaper said.\n\n\"We were really helped by the fact that it hadn't appeared in a place we would regard as a reliable source,'' Mr Wales told the Times.\n\n\"I would have had a really hard time with it if it had.''\n\nThe Times said that two days after the November 10 kidnapping, Michael Moss, an investigative reporter at the Times and friend of Mr Rohde, altered Mr Rohde's Wikipedia entry to emphasise that his work could be seen as sympathetic to Muslims, like his reporting on Guantanamo and his coverage of the Srebrenica massacre of Bosnian Muslims.\n\nIt said that the next day, an unidentified user, citing an Afghan news agency report, edited the entry on Mr Rohde and mentioned the kidnapping.\n\nMr Moss deleted the mention, and the user promptly restored it, adding a note protesting the removal, the Times said.\n\nIt said the Times eventually reached out to Wales and Wikipedia put an indefinite block and then a temporary freeze on changes to the page.\n\n\"We had no idea who it was,'' Mr Wales said of the unidentified user making the edits.\n\nHe said there was no indication the user had ill-intent.\n\nThe Times said Mr Wales himself unfroze the page after the June 19 escape by Mr Rohde and his interpreter, Tahir Ludin.\n\n​\n\nInteresting here is to see that people should be kept in the dark of the \"security deterioration\" and the realites of what is happening in occupied Afghanistan. Instead Wikipedia will help in sanitising the image.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Wikimedia Director Sue Gardner in Israel 2009[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]Wikipedia chief Gardner goes to Israel - gets advice[/SIZE]\n\nIsraeli paper Haaretz reports 04/05/2009 on how Sue Gardner, Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation which runs Wikipedia, has participated at a meeting in Israel - aWikipedia Academy 2009 Conference -organized by Wikimedias Israeli supporters and Tel Aviv University's Netvision Institute for Internet Studies. Haaretz writes:\n\n[SIZE=+2]Wikipedia editors: Coverage of Israel 'problematic'[/SIZE]By Cnaan Liphshiz\n\nWikipedia's coverage of Israel-related issues is \"problematic,\" leading Israeli internet researchers claimed Sunday at the Wikipedia Academy 2009 Conference dealing with the world's largest encyclopedia. The conference was organized by Wikimedia's volunteer-based Israel chapter and Tel Aviv University's Netvision Institute for Internet Studies. However, the Web site's leading manager said it merely reflected public discourse.\n\nIn demonstrating what he defined as problems, Eli Hacohen, the Institute's director, showed how Hamas is not defined as a terrorist organization in the first paragraph describing the organization on the English site of the reader-edited online encyclopedia, which is the world's fourth most popular Web site.\n\nHacohen also documented his attempts to define Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as a Holocaust-denier. Each time he included his remarks on Wikipedia, users and editors removed the reference - despite Ahmadinejad's frequent and public Holocaust denials.\n\nOn a related entry, Hacohen also noted that Wikipedia defines David Irving - a known Holocaust denier - as a historian, although his credentials are recognized by no one but himself. Furthermore, the Wikipedia entry on January's Operation Cast Lead in Gaza describes it as an \"intense bombardment\" by Israel on a civilian population.\n\nDror Kamir, a leading Israeli Wikipedia promoter, showed how Lod is not listed as a city in Israel in Wikipedia's Arabic-language version.\n\nAlso attending the conference, which discussed Wikipedia's role in academia, was Sue Gardner, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia. Gardner told Haaretz that she is \"quite comfortable\" with the mistakes on the Web site. \"I know that more or less the same mistakes can be found in the New York Times,\" she explained.\n\nBefore her address at the conference, she defined Wikipedia as a \"just another mainstream news medium.\" Wikipedia, Gardner said, \"will never say anything as Wikipedia. It will only quote relatively well-respected sources, including other media. So it's natural for Wikipedia to reflect public discourse as it fluctuates, and news is the first draft of history.\"\n\nOn her first visit to Israel, Gardner explained that her attitude stemmed from her framework of reference as a journalist in her native Canada, including a stint as director of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Web site.\n\n​\n\nThe boss of Wikipedia thus travels down to the land of the chosen people to be lectured on how Wikipedia can be improved when it divulges information concerning Israel/Jews.\n\nFor a collection of images from this event beteween Wikipedia and Israel, see this link:\n\n[SIZE=-1]Sue Gardner in Israel 2009, Eli Hacohen to the right[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]Wikipedia leading editor also goes to Israel[/SIZE]\n\nDavid Shankbone, leading editor at Wikipedia, has been invited by the Israeli Governments Foreign Ministry to help polish Israels image:\n\n[SIZE=+2]Photo Editing Israels Online Image\n\n[/SIZE]By Sharon Udasin, Staff Writer\n\nThe Jewish Week, 03/04/2009[...]\n\nBut David Saranga, the media consul for the Consulate General of Israel in New York, plans to fight back. After launching a pro-Israel campaign through Twitter.com during the Gaza war and by bringing Maxim magazine into Israel last year, he says he is recruiting the best in the business to revamp Israels online image.\n\nIn just a few weeks, he will bring six American new media experts to photograph Israel, with funds from the Consulate and Israels Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n[...]\n\nHowever, Saranga says the initiative will, hopefully, knock the pictures of destruction much further down the lists, behind photos of ordinary Israeli daily life. And because he has enlisted Internet authorities like pen-named Wikipedia senior editor David Shankbone, Saranga thinks that there is a good chance theyll stay that way.\n\nShankbone whose real name is David Miller first visited Israel in December 2007, when Saranga led a group of journalists on a tour of the countrys high-tech and environmental developments. All in all Shankbone estimates that he illustrates over 4,000 Wikipedia articles with his photography.\n\nThe idea is to create a body of work that not only Wikipedia can use but that the general public can use, he said.\n\nShankbone is not Jewish, but he said he learned extensively about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in school. While he considers himself a supporter of Israel, Shankbone doesnt intend to make Wikipedia a Zionist Web site, and he looks at the Gaza war as a black-and-white situation Israel had a right to respond, but its mode of attack was not without fault.\n\nYet for Shankbone, the purpose of his photo expedition is not to document the aftermath of the war.\n\nPeople want to talk to you about other things than just missiles, he said.\n\nIdeally, Shankbone said hed like to end up at solar power plants in the Negev Desert or in a southern city like Eilat, because he spent most of his time up north during the previous trip.\n\nI particularly like small towns, because my feeling is that anyone can come to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Shankbone said.\n\nWhile on open-source sites, users can add and remove other peoples contributions as they see fit, only an administrator can permanently delete the posts from the storage database, Wikimedia Commons. In his three years working as a Wikipedia editor, however, Shankbone said that he has been careful to avoid inserting his own political positions, and readers have rarely altered his content. His collection remains the largest Creative Commons a Web-based data-sharing platform photograph community generated by one person, he said.\n\n[...]\n\nCritic Oboler, however, questions whether bringing out people like Shankbone will help directly with the grass-roots, anti-Israel and often anti-Semitic activity that occurs online.\n\nWhat it will do is help in the fight for hearts and minds online, he said. This proactive engagement is also important.\n\nIt certainly isnt going to be the silver bullet, Shankbone agreed. It does give Wikipedia the opportunity or responsibility to present accuracy.\n\nAnd while Saranga hopes to change the worlds perception of Israel in the long term with the support of every American Israel consulate, he recognizes that, realistically, results will not be immediate.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single activity wont change perceptions; a single activity wont change the criticism generated by the Gaza war, he said. But what is important is to create a critical mass of positive activities that will improve Israels image.\n\n​\n\nThe Jerusalem Post writes on the same story:\n\n[SIZE=+2]Leading Wikipedia editor to visit Israel[/SIZE]By Herb Keinon\n\nThe Jerusalem Post, Dec 8, 2007\n\nIn an acknowledgement of the importance that the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia has in shaping opinion, the Foreign Ministry is bringing one of its leading editors, David Shankbone, to Israel next week.\n\nWorld According to a communiqu put out by the ministry, Shankbone has carried out dozens of interviews of US personalities for Wikipedia, including presidential candidates, religious leaders, rock stars and journalists. Shankbone will be visiting within the framework of a delegation of technology writers being brought to Israel by the Foreign Ministry and the America-Israel Friendship League.\n\nExplaining the rationale for bringing Shankbone to Israel, David Saranga, the spokesman at the consulate in New York, said: \"More than once we have faced editors connected to Israel that appear on Wikipedia in English that do not represent the reality in Israel. We decided to initiate a visit by Shankbone to describe Israeli reality as it is.\"\n\nWikipedia, according to the Foreign Ministry, is the eighth largest web site in the world, with some 60 million visitors a day, or some 14,000 hits a second.\n\n​\n\nDavid Shankbone - whose real name is David Miller - has himself written on his trip in his private user page in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:David_Shankbone/Israel):\n\n[SIZE=+1]Israel[/SIZE]I went to Israel to expand Wikipedia's quality photographic representation and coverage of Israeli-related articles. My trip was reported on in their press:\n\nJerusalem Post\n\nThe official blog of Israel\n\nHaaretz\n\nI also wrote a series of articles about the trip for Wikinews. I interviewed their President, Shimon Peres, had lunch with the President of the Technion and discussed the philosophy of Wikipedia over dinner with Yossi Vardi. Here is the first one.\n\nAnd if you have a chancecheck out Solar power in Israel, which I recently wrote.\n\nBelow is a gallery of images I took on the trip.\n\n​\n\nAnd here is a nice picture of Shankbone-Miller with Shimon Peres:\n\n[SIZE=-1]Wikipedias David Shankbone (Miller) with Israeli war criminal Shimon Peres - the man behind the\n\nQana massacre of over 100 Lebanese civilians in 1996[/SIZE]\n\n​\n\nShankbones interview with Peres appeared in the Israeli paper Yedioth Aharonoth (here part of the article, reproduced from the Israeli government site http://www.isrealli.org/ - isRealli - The New Blog of the State of Israel):\n\n[SIZE=+2]WikiPeres[/SIZE]By Itamar Eichner\n\nYedioth Aharonoth, 24 December 2007, p.12\n\nA President with Value: Peres is the First Leader to Be Interviewed for Wikipedias News Site\n\nThe nations president proved again yesterday that despite his advanced age he has no need to be embarrassed facing politicians much younger than he. Shimon Peres is the first world leader to grant an interview to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia.\n\nThe interview with Peres will be published on the Wikipedia news site, Wikinews and his statements will be integrated into various articles throughout the encyclopedia.\n\nFor over an hour, Peres sat with one of the Wikipedia senior editors, David Shankbone. Shankbone, who came to Israel with a delegation of journalists, turned to the Israeli Consul for Media and Public Affairs in New York, David Saranga, and asked to schedule an interview with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Peres. To Shankbones surprise, it was Peres who decided to take up the gauntlet and grant an interview to the popular encyclopedia. Wikipedia is the eighth most-popular website in the world in terms of daily traffic.\n\nAt the outset of the interview, Shankbone told Peres, We checked among Internet surfers under age 30 and we found that you are the most popular and most recognizable leader in the world.\n\nPeres used the interview for a bitter attack on Iran. The Iranian economy cannot support the atomic program, he said, and the world must decide if it is ready for nuclear weapons to fall into terrorists hands.\n\nPeres was asked his opinion of the younger generation of Israelis. The 14- 15- and 16-year-olds need to participate in determining the worlds future, the President explained. If it were up to adults, they would want kids to keep dancing the hora or singing Slavic songs, but youngsters dont listen and should not have to. Young women today also wear more risqu clothing than they did in the past and there is no problem with that since they look nicer. Consul Saranga said last night It was important for the Foreign Ministry that part of the interview was dedicated to subjects other than the conflict [with the Palestinians].\n\n​\n\nThe interview has since appeared in Wikinews - \"the free news source\" - as it was destined to be, and can be read at:http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres_discusses_the_future_of_Israel\n\n[SIZE=+2]Shankbone-Miller to return to Israel[/SIZE]\n\nIn his own blog 2008/07/31 Shankbone-Miller writes that he will return to Israel (http://blog.shankbone.org/2008/07/31/david-shankbone-to-go-back-to-israel-for-wikimedia/):\n\n[SIZE=+2]David Shankbone to go back to Israel for Wikimedia[/SIZE]By David Shankbone\n\nLast December I traveled to Israel where I had lunch with Yitzhak Apeloig, the president of their premiere university, the Technion, and interviewed their President and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Shimon Peres (photo, right).\n\nIn the next few months I will be returning to the Holy Land for a week-long photography expedition. From the students of Haifa to the dolphins of Eilat; from the vineyards of the Galillee to the Bedouins of The Negev; I will engage in a photographic documentary of the people and landscape of Israel. The goal is to create a comprehensive body of images of the country that are licensed as free content, meaning my work will be available to everyone via Wikimedia for both commercial and non-commercial uses.\n\nWatch this blog for updates.\n\n​\n\nIn his own blog 2009/03/04 Shankbone writes more on his new Israel trip, where he will be joined by \"baroness of social media, Tamar Weinberg, and her photographer husband\". \"Consul David Saranga in the Israeli Foreign Ministry [...] was instrumental in putting the trip together\"(http://blog.shankbone.org/2009/03/04/my-israel-trip-covered-in-jewish-week/):\n\n[SIZE=+2]My Israel trip covered in Jewish Week[/SIZE]By David Shankbone\n\nSharon Udasin recently wrote in Jewish Week about my upcoming photography expedition of Israel for the creative commons. Also on the plane will be the baroness of social media, Tamar Weinberg, and her photographer husband. The itinerary is not set, but I have requested an interview for Wikinews. Because the focus is on photography, most of my writing will take place on this blog where I hope to document the experience. Consul David Saranga in the Israeli Foreign Ministry, who has spear-headed his countrys foray into social media, was instrumental in putting the trip together.\n\nMy goal here will be to document not just the monuments and public structures that every tourist documents, but also common, every-day features of life and landscape. Cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are not crying out for free media (although they can always use more professional-quality shots). Instead, places like the Arava Valley, the kiryats and the kibbutzes need coverage.\n\nI want to capture life outside the scope of a rifle. That not every Israeli is armed, living in rubble or dodging missiles is lost in a media narrative that filters everything through conflict. The hope is to obtain shots of the country not typically obtained by tourists and photojournalists. Small town and rural Israel holds all the appeal for me.\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=+2]More tricks to control information in Wikipedia[/SIZE]\n\nBut corrupting the very top names of Wikipedia for Israels cause is not enough.

CEO Semel used his position to impress on his fellow Jews. For instance Semel in the shape of Yahoo-boss appeared as one of the main speakers at the Jewish Community Federation in San Fransiscos meeting, January 25, 2006, according to the organizations homepage (http://www.sfjcf.org/aboutJCF/photos/album/default.asp?album=blcbreakfast-jan2006&page=1):\n\n300 JCF donors gathered at the Julia Morgan Ballroom to kibbitz and build a Jewish network of business professionals. Featured speaker Yahoo! CEO Terry Semel gave an engaging, personal talk, sharing his views on philanthropy and leadership.​\n\n[SIZE=-1]Terry Semel speaks at Jewish Community Federation in San Fransisco[/SIZE]\n\nThe Jewish site Jweekly.com writes on the event:\n\n[SIZE=+1]Yahoo CEO talks of philanthropy, teamwork at JCF event[/SIZE]Friday, February 17, 2006\n\nBy Maureen Earl, correspondent\n\nWith more than 420 million users around the world, Yahoo can claim a high spot on the Internet echelon. But it wasn't always smooth sailing for the Sunnyvale-based company.\n\nWhen Yahoo's chairman and CEO, Jewish Brooklyn native Terry Semel, first arrived at the company in 2001, it had just lost $98 million on revenue of $717 million. Semel was determined to put Yahoo back in the black.\n\nHis strategy worked. Last year Yahoo earned $1.2 billion on sales of $5.3 billion and those 420 million users aren't bad, either.\n\nOn Jan. 25 Semel addressed 300 donors to the S.F.-based Jewish Community Federation who gathered for the JCF's first Business Leadership Council breakfast.\n\nSemel, once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood and now one of the most commanding leaders in Internet technology, started the keynote address by announcing that he was not a morning person.\n\n\"I prefer to take an hour to reflect and catch up in the morning,\" he said.\n\nSoft-spoken but authoritative, Semel discussed the importance of philanthropy in business. \"Business and philanthropy go hand in hand,\" he said. \"I came from a lower-income family in Brooklyn, yet by the age of 10 or 12 I'd already been taught the importance of giving.\n\n\"You need to start kids off that young so that it becomes a habit. To accomplish things you also have to give. At first maybe with time, then later with money, and eventually even both if you are able.\"At the age of 10 it was a dollar from his allowance; today, Semel no longer thinks on a small scale.\n\n\"I now think in terms of hundreds of millions,\" he said, \"but the same principles apply whether it's a two-person philanthropy organization or a giant like Yahoo.\"\n\nTikkun olam, repairing the world, is how Semel operates both in philanthropy and business. He recalled how, as an ambitious young man working as a sales trainee at Warner Bros. in the mid-1960s, his boss would arrive shouting and yelling at all and sundry.\n\n\"There and then I decided I would not do that. How people are treated is vital.\"\n\nSemel, who graduated in 1964 with an accounting degree from Long Island University, went on to become chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. During his 24-year career there, Semel and his business partner, Robert Daly, helped shape the company into one of the world's largest media outlets, generating nearly $11 billion in total revenue from businesses in 50 countries.\n\nIn 1999, Semel and Daly pressed their hands into wet concrete outside Hollywood's legendary Mann's Chinese Theater. With the executives thus immortalized in Hollywood lore, the ceremony marked the last day of work for the two at Warner Bros.\n\nIn May 2001, after an 18-month hiatus, Semel joined Yahoo as CEO and chairman immediately after the dot-com collapse in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"I was looking for a challenge. I didn't take the position for the money,\" he said.\n\nWhether he was looking for it or not, Semel has netted $403 million by exercising Yahoo options and selling shares. He still owns shares and options worth more than $230 million.\n\nThe credit of Yahoo's success, Semel said, goes to his staff and their practiced team ability.\n\n\"It's always about team. No one wins if it rests on one star athlete. The superstar ideal will not get you to the Super Bowl, it's not sustainable. It has to be the team. And we [at Yahoo] actually like each other we love the challenge.\"\n\nLast year Yahoo added 220 people a month and now employs about 10,000. Daniel Rosensweig, Yahoo's chief operating officer, said, \"Terry's a Brooklynite at heart. He expects a new fight every day.\"\n\nOne of the biggest challenges Semel faces is adapting the company to fit its users' ever-changing preferences.\n\n\"The big change in technology is that we used to have someone else program everything for us,\" he said. \"Someone else programmed television, so you watched what was on when it was on. Internet has turned the user into programmers we want what we want, when we want, and we get it.\"\n\nOn Friday evenings, Semel boards his private jet in Sunnyvale and returns to his family and home in Bel Air for the weekend. There he is able to relax for a couple of days knowing that he has helped grow Yahoo into a company that has the widest global reach of any Internet site.\n\nNot shabby for a man who, prior to joining Yahoo, had rarely gone near a computer.\n\nSemel may constantly redirect attention to his team, but he is very much an individual. \"I would not have succeeded had I not been true to myself. I never wanted to be the guy who looks back and says 'I wish I'd done this, done that,'\" he said.\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=+2]Summing up Semels pre-Yahoo! career[/SIZE]\n\nPrior to Yahoo! - as stated in the article above - Semel worked in Hollywood where he spent 24 years at Warner Bros. As its chairman and co-chief executive officer, Semel and his partner built the company into one of the worlds largest entertainment enterprises. Prior to Warner Bros., Semel was in charge of Walt Disney's Theatrical Distribution division and he has also been in charge of CBS Theatrical Distribution division.\n\nTerry Semel is a friend of Arnon Milchan, the Jewish Hollywood producer with Mossad connections, and was one of the invited att Milchans Israel party 2008, a party co-organized by the Israeli consulate (The Jewish Journal, September 25, 2008).\n\n[SIZE=+2]Other Yahoo!

The company is taking its battle for survival against Google and Microsoft to Israel on two levels. It will open a research and development center in Haifa, and will also enter the content side of the business here for the first time through a cooperation agreement with Walla!, which is partly owned by Haaretz.\n\nYahoo! is following Google, which set up R&D centers in Tel Aviv and Haifa, as well as establishing a marketing center that also deals in joint content arrangements with Israeli portals. Microsoft, meanwhile, has set up a sales and marketing branch in Ra'anana, as well as R&D centers in Tel Aviv and Herzliya.\n\nYahoo! is now negotiating office space in the Matam high-tech park in Haifa; and is expected to open its research center within a few months.\n\nGoogle kicked off in the Middle East with its Haifa R&D center in July 2006, despite the Second Lebanon War at the time; the center was its first in the region and only its fourth outside of the U.S. Other well-known companies in the Matam industrial park include Intel, Microsoft, Elbit and Zim.\n\nYahoo!'s first foray into the Israeli content market is based on a strategic deal signed with portal Walla!. The goal is to threaten Google's hegemony in the Israeli search market for the first time and the real challenge is to compete in search-based advertising.\n\nUnder the long-term deal signed between Yahoo! and Walla!, the technology and databases will come from Yahoo!, but the search engine will be branded as Walla! Search, the name of Walla!'s present engine.\n\nOnly six months ago there were reports that Walla! was negotiating with Google in the search market, but no agreement was ever reached. Google usually partners with a local search engine by providing the technology and the advertisements, while the revenues are split.\n\nThe joint Walla!-Yahoo! venture will continue using Walla!'s AdVantage platform. This will allow Walla! to continue to manage the advertising itself, and it will receive a higher percentage of the revenues than in a deal that also included advertising, such as Google proposed.\n\nAccording to Walla! CEO Ilan Yeshua: \"The search and advertising in search results sector is one of the fastest growing in the world, and also in Israel. The agreement with Yahoo! allows us to offer Walla!'s surfers an excellent search product ... for the Israeli user. The agreement will help Walla! increase its market share in the search-based advertising market. The existence of another strong player in the search and textual advertising sector will contribute to competitiveness , both in the search experience and in the range of possibilities available to advertisers.\"\n\nYahoo! and Walla! had previously discussed technological cooperation in the past, but nothing serious came of it.

The exact amount has not been announced, but sources close to the situation say the company will go for between $30 million and $40 million.\n\nThe Sirota brothers, new immigrants from Russia, are the big winners in the deal, along with Yossi Vardi and a group of private investors from the United States. Initial investment in the company is estimated at just a few million, and the brothers will be raking in a total of $15 million.\n\n[...]\n\n\"We will become part of Yahoo Entertainment, and they will distribute the FoxyTunes toolbar to as many people as possible.\"\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=+2]More on Jewish Internet actor Semel...[/SIZE]\n\nSemel is currently on the Board of Directors of Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation, Emerson College, and the Guggenheim Museum.

CEO Terry Semel - insists she was the Mean Girls stars first gay love.\n\nBut she claims they kept their affair secret because of the actress fear of coming out to the world.\n\nShe said: Everyone thinks Samantha is Lindsays first lesbian love, but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart. At the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies. But then Samantha came on to the scene and I was dropped.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Terry Semel doing the classic \"palms-out\" pose[/SIZE]​\n\n[SIZE=+3]MySpace[/SIZE]\n\nMySpace is a social networking website with an interactive, user-submitted network of friends, personal profiles, blogs, groups, photos, music, and videos for teenagers and adults internationally.\n\n[SIZE=+2]Jewish co-founders and President[/SIZE]\n\nThe MySpace project was overseen by Brad Greenspan (eUniverse's Founder, Chairman, CEO), who managed Chris DeWolfe (MySpace's starting CEO), Josh Berman, Tom Anderson (MySpace's starting President), and a team of programmers and resources provided by eUniverse.\n\nKnown Jews in this lot are Anderson, Greenspan and Berman.\n\nAs one Jewish blogger writes:\n\nThe website was co-founded by Tom Anderson. Although Tom’s last name reflects his father’s Scottish heritage, he and his mother are Jewish and he was raised in a messianic Jewish household.​\n\nJosh Berman, the other Jewish co-founder of MySpace.com, also served as the company's Chief Operating Officer.\n\n[SIZE=-1]President Tom Anderson (right) and Chris DeWolfe (left)[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=+2]Jewish Vice Presidents including an Israeli paratrooper (reserves)[/SIZE]\n\nAnother Jew, Richard Rosenblatt, was former Chairman of MySpace and thus earned the title the \"MySpace guru\".\n\nThe Jew Travis Katz is presently the international head of MySpace and a senior Vice President (2009).\n\n[SIZE=-1]Richard Rosenblatt[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=-1]Travis Katz[/SIZE]\n\n[SIZE=-1]Josh Brooks[/SIZE]\n\nAmong other names as senior Vice Presidents we have Shawn Gold, the Israeli Nimrod Lev (former Israeli paratroopers and military intelligence) and Josh Brooks. Whether Steve Pearman also is Jewish, we dont know.\n\nAnother Jew - with political insights - is Jeff Berman who joined MySpace in 2006 as Senior Vice President of Public Affairs. In 2007, Berman was promoted to General Manager of MySpaceTV (http://myspacetv.com), where he oversaw the launch of the company's global video platform. There he cooperated with media Jews Michael Eisner, Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick. In 2008 Berman was appointed Executive Vice President of Marketing and Content of MySpace, responsible for spearheading the development and implementation of marketing initiatives and campaigns for MySpace's more than 110 million users worldwide. Berman will thus report to MySpace's CEO and co-founder Chris DeWolfe.\n\nBefore joining MySpace, from 2001-2005, Berman served as Chief Counsel to the Jewish U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer and Staff Director of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Jeff Berman, MySpace Jew with political insights[/SIZE]\n\nMySpace, and its parent company eUniverse (now renamed Intermix Media) was bought in July 2005 for US$ 580 million by arch-Zionist Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.\n\nMurdoch is a fanatic pro-Israeli. In the Jewish magazine 15 Minutes, Issue 26, July 1, 2001, one could read:\n\n[Murdoch] explained at a Museum of Jewish Heritage dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria that, \"I have always believed in the future of Israel and the goals of the international Jewish community\".​\n\n[SIZE=+2]MySpace and Israel[/SIZE]\n\nThe Israeli paper Haaretz writes, January 09, 2007:\n\n[SIZE=+2]Hey, Israeli startups - MySpace wants you[/SIZE]By Lior Haner\n\nEven though most Israeli entrepreneurs say they want to develop their startups into large companies, most secretly wish for generous purchase offers from abroad - and may even prefer working as senior vice presidents in an American corporation.\n\nBoth of these wishes were granted to Israeli Internet serial entrepreneur Nimrod Lev, 35, who founded KSolo in 2005, sold it last summer to Fox Interactive Media and now works as a senior vice president at Fox.\n\nFox Interactive is owned by the media conglomerate News Corp., and owns the popular MySpace Internet Web site. Lev is currently on a personal trip to Israel, and will be speaking at the Israel Management Center's convention this coming Sunday, January 7, where participants will choose the 2006 high-tech CEO of the year.\n\nHaner's current visit is his first to Israel since selling KSolo and he does not hide his intentions to find more Israeli Internet entrepreneurs for Fox's acquisitions department. \"If there is a company can benefit FOx's MySpace, I would rather find it in Israel than elsewhere,\" explains Lev.\n\nDespite his Israeli background and the fact that there are other Israelis who could assist companies in penetrating the American market, Lev insists that due to the cultural gaps and problems in understanding one another, any company that wants to succeed overseas needs a local presence.\n\nThis week Lev hopes to meet with representatives of several Israeli companies whose products are in their initial stages, to form ties between them and Fox. Lev believes that the next big high-tech field combines the Internet and cellular services, but he has not revealed which Israeli companies he thinks have the best potential, or with whom he is meeting. In the meantime, he has been heaping praises on the more established and familiar Internet companies, such as Jajah, Oberon Media and Quigo Technologies.\n\nHe also feels the biggest underachieving company in recent years is Babylon, the interactive dictionary developer, which Lev says could have been much more successful. During his visit, Lev will share his experience and relate the story of his ascent to the upper echelons of the American Internet industry.\n\nLev started out as an editor at the Israeli Internet portal Walla in 1996, a job he landed after editing the student newspaper at Tel Aviv's College of Management.\n\nFiring Cupid's arrow\n\nIn 1999 Lev left Walla to join Zion Madmon, the founder of cupid.co.il, to help promote that company and develop it abroad, thus beginning his journey to American Internet.\n\n\"We established JCupid, which joined forces with JDate,\" recalls Lev. \"In 2004, Cupid was sold to Spark Networks, which operates JDate. That was my first exit and I immediately started looking for my next project and remained in the United States. The next thing turned out to be KSolo.\" KSolo, run by the Israeli developers of Cupid and headed by Lev in New York, is a site for karaoke singing and recording.\n\nLev says that his secret to success is not developing something that he thinks users want, but something that users need. The product does not have to be connected to the success of other sites or the entrepreneur's personal background.\n\n\"I was no longer a bachelor when I began matchmaking on the Web and had no connection to karaoke when I founded KSolo, but it seemed to me like a necessary product. One does not always have to invent the wheel. One can take something that works well in the real world and adapt it for the Internet. This was the case with the two companies I founded,\" he says.\n\n\"At KSolo, we signed an agreement with all the major copyright holders of the songs in America and share the revenues with them,\" Lev adds, adding that in the Internet era, content has so far been considered the main thing.\n\n\"One has to understand that in the past two years, the user has become the focal point,\" continues Lev, \"and it is the users who control the content.\"\n\nLev's path to the Fox deal began like that of many Internet entrepreneurs, with a fund-raising campaign by private investors.\n\n\"The investors were American,\" relates Lev. \"It is easier to raise money in the U.S. It depends on the project, but usually Israelis find it harder to spend money. It is something in their blood. Israeli market evaluations are lower, because Israelis were burned more severely by the bursting of the high-tech bubble. Since the American Internet market was much more advanced, many companies had already had exits, while in Israel, the industry collapsed a moment before companies closed deals, and the sting of the previous experience affects investors' decisions to this day.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2006, about a year after KSolo went on the air, Lev received a telephone call from, Tom Andersen, one of Fox's senior executives, who is also the president of MySpace. He had discovered a karaoke recording by a KSolo user on the user's personal site at MySpace.\n\n\"The negotiations [with Fox] were quick and very serious,\" recalls Lev. \"For a few weeks I attended a great many meetings, at which [Fox representatives] explained to me exactly what they wanted. They exhibited a level of perseverance and determination I had not encountered before and did not waste any time, something critical to startups.\"\n\nLev would not disclose how much he received for the company, but commented that the investors received a good return on their money. After the sale, Lev was appointed a senior vice president at Fox, where he continues to be responsible for KSolo's operations.\n\n​\n\nThe Jewish Vitual Library wrote in their article on MySpaces Lev Nimrods (http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Nimrod_Lev.html) connection to the Israeli military:\n\nIronically enough, it was war-not love-that prepared Lev for his career and reinforced his belief in promulgating the Jewish faith via Jewish marriages. Military service is compulsory in Israel-women serve two years and men three. Lev, however, opted to serve five: three years as a paratrooper in a combat unit and then two years in charge of an intelligence unit that focused on anti-terrorist tactics. Today, he is a captain in the reserves.\"When you walk 60 miles with 40 pounds on you, everything else looks easy,\" he says. \"I wish that young people didn't have to go through this. At this age-after high school graduation-they should be thinking about chasing down dates not about chasing terrorists. But I know that until we find peace, everyone has to contribute to Israel's safety. We're defending Israel so Jews all over the world will have a place to feel safe. This is one of the reasons we need to do whatever we can to bring Jews together.\"\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=-1]Lev Nimrod[/SIZE]The Guardian on how Israels Foreign Office tries to promote Israel via MySpace:\n\n[SIZE=+2]Israel seeks friends through MySpace[/SIZE]By Bobbie Johnson, technology correspondent\n\nThe Guardian, Saturday 24 March 2007\n\nA 58-year-old Jerusalem woman is not a typical MySpace user - the hugely popular social networking site is inhabited mostly by people at least 30 years younger.\n\nBut the profile she is reading is a profile with a difference: it represents the entire state of Israel. Officials hope that running a MySpace page dedicated to Israel will help improve relations with people from other countries, and increase awareness and communication with those under 35.\n\nThe idea belongs to David Saranga, a diplomat based at the Israeli consulate in New York. Mr Saranga said research had shown Israel's image among the young was not good, and that by reaching out through one of the internet's most popular sites he could repair some of the damage.\n\n\"We saw that we had a problem with the 18 to 35 age group. The reason is that this group doesn't see Israel as relevant.We have to talk to them in their language, in platforms they are using, and the new media is one of the ways to do so,\" he said.\n\nThe page is particularly targeted at young Americans, who make up a large proportion of MySpace users. Since Mr Saranga set up the page, \"Israel\" has gained 963 friends from around the world, including fictional characters such as TV secret agent Jack Bauer and Star Wars heroine Princess Leia, as well as, it is claimed, the Hollywood actors George Clooney and Leonardo Di Caprio.\n\nThe pages include pictures of Israeli cities, as well as music that invites the audience to question the cycle of violence and to \"end this holy war\". Among Mr Saranga's other initiatives are a blog called \"isRealli\" and an internet TV station.\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=-1]Shawn Gold of MySpace[/SIZE]\n\nArticle from Prison Planet.com on arch-Zionist Murdochs \"cyber trojan horse\":\n\n[SIZE=+2]MySpace Is The Trojan Horse Of Internet Censorship[/SIZE][SIZE=+1]Media elite's last gasp effort to save crumbling empire[/SIZE]\n\nPaul Joseph Watson & Alex Jones/Prison Planet.com | March 16 2006\n\nMySpace isn't cool, it isn't hip and it isn't trendy. It represents a cyber trojan horse and the media elite's last gasp effort to reclaim control of the Internet and sink it with a stranglehold of regulation, control and censorship.\n\nSince Rupert Murdoch's $580 Million acquisition of MySpace in July 2005, it has come from total obscurity to now being the 8th most visited website in the world, receiving half as many page hits as Google, despite the fact that on first appearance it looks like a 5-year-old's picture scrap and scribble book.\n\nMySpace is the new mobile phone. If you don't have a MySpace account then you belong to some kind of culturally shunned underclass.\n\nWhat most of the trendy wendy's remain blissfully unaware of is the fact that MySpace is Rupert Murdoch's battle axe for shaping a future Internet environment whereby electronic dissent, whether it be against corporations or government, will not tolerated and freedom of e-speech will cease to exist.\n\nMySpace has been caught shutting down blogs critical of itself and other Murdoch owned companies. They even had the audacity to censor links to completely different websites when clicking through for MySpace. When 600 MySpace users complained, MySpace deleted the blog forum that the complaints were posted on. Taking their inspiration from Communist China, MySpace regularly uses blanket censorship to block out words like 'God'.\n\nEarlier this week Rupert Murdoch sounded the death knell for conventional forms of media in stating that the media elite were losing their monopoly to the rapid and free spread of new communication technologies. Murdoch stressed the need to regain control of these outlets in order to prevent the establishment media empire from crumbling.\n\nMySpace is Rupert Murdoch's trojan horse for destroying free speech on the Internet. It is a foundational keystone of the first wave of the state's backlash to the damage that a free and open Internet has done to their organs of propaganda. By firstly making it cool, trendy and culturally elite for millions to flock to establishment controlled Internet backbones like MySpace, Murdoch is preparing the groundwork for the day when it will stop being voluntary and become mandatory to use government and corporate monopoly controlled Internet hubs.\n\nThe end game is a system similar to or worse than China, whereby no websites even mildly critical of the government will be authorized.\n\nThe Pentagon admitted that they would engage in psychological warfare and cyber attacks on 'enemy' Internet websites in an attempt to shut them down. The fact that the NSA surveillance program spied on 5,000 Americans tells us that the enemy is the alternative media and that it will be targeted for elimination. Google has been ordered to turn over information about its users by a judge to the US government.\n\nThe second wave of destroying freedom of speech online will simply attempt to price people out of using the conventional Internet and force people over to Internet 2, a state regulated hub where permission will need to be obtained directly from an FCC or government bureau to set up a website.\n\nThe original Internet will then be turned into a mass surveillance database and marketing tool. The Nation magazine reported, \"Verizon, Comcast, Bell South and other communications giants are developing strategies that would track and store information on our every move in cyberspace in a vast data-collection and marketing system, the scope of which could rival the National Security Agency. According to white papers now being circulated in the cable, telephone and telecommunications industries, those with the deepest pockets--corporations, special-interest groups and major advertisers--would get preferred treatment. Content from these providers would have first priority on our computer and television screens, while information seen as undesirable, such as peer-to-peer communications, could be relegated to a slow lane or simply shut out.\"\n\nThe original Internet will deliberately be subject to crash upon crash until it becomes a useless carcass of overpriced trash and its reputation will be defiled by the TV and media barons cashing in on the perfectly streamlined Internet 2, the free for all network that just requires you to thumbscan in order to log on! Those with a security grading below yellow on their national ID card will unfortunately be refused access. Websites that carry hate speech (ones that talk about government corruption) will be censored for the betterment of society.\n\nFor the aspiring dictator, the Internet is a dangerous tool that has been seized by the enemy. We have come a long way since 1969, when the ARPANET was created solely for US government use. The Internet is freedom's best friend and the bane of control freaks. Its eradication is one of the short term goals of those that seek to centralize power and subjugate the world under a global surveillance panopticon prison.\n\nRupert Murdoch's MySpace and its ceaseless promotion by the establishment media as the best thing since sliced bread is part of this movement. In saying all this we do encourage everyone to set up a MySpace account, but only if you're going to use it to bash MySpace, Rupert Murdoch and copy and paste this article right at the top of the page! See how long it is before your account is terminated.\n\n​\n\n[SIZE=+3]eBay[/SIZE]\n\nThe Jewish boasting page www.jewishachievement.com writes on the Jewish first President of eBay, the Canadian-born Jeff Skoll:\n\nJeff Skoll did not create eBay, non-Jew Pierre Omidyar did in 1993. For Omidyar, born to French and Iranian parents, creating an on-line auction Web-site was a Labor Day weekend hobby project. For its first couple of years, it was simply a free Web-site Omidyar ran on his own home page along with several other of his Web page creations. During the first few months, he tried to recruit Skoll, a Jewish French-Canadian he met through friends, to become his partner. Skoll turned him down, choosing to remain at Stanford Business School.In early 1996, Omidyar's Internet service provider began charging him $250 a month to host the site. Omidyar was forced to start charging a fee, which he passed along to the site's users based on the sale price of auction items. As the checks started rolling in Omidyar realized he needed help. Again, he approached Skoll. This time, after a few months of consulting for eBay, Skoll signed on as its first full time employee and President.\n\n[SIZE=-1]Jeff Skoll[/SIZE]\n\nSkoll grew up in Canada and showed early signs of being a driven entrepreneur. At twelve, he was selling Amway products door-to-door. After graduating from the University of Toronto with a 4.0 grade point average, he set up two high tech companies before moving to Palo Alto to enroll at Stanford Business School. Compensating for Omidyar's easy going ways and enjoyment of programming, Skoll was the driven leader who planned the business and made things happen. He hired key people, established much of the culture, and constantly pushed to build the business.\n\nThe result is the number one auction Web site in the world. It grossed $3.9 billion in 2004, netted $936 million and was worth $53 billion by mid 2005, all of which made both Omidyar and Skoll very wealthy. Skoll has since left eBay and now devotes the bulk of his time to philanthropic activities, particularly his Skoll Foundation to which he has donated $250 million. The Foundation supports social entrepreneurs working to effect lasting positive social changes worldwide. In 2003, Skoll won recognition from Business Week magazine as \"one of the most innovative philanthropists of the past decade\"\n\n​\n\nEd Skoll also interacts with fellow Jewish Internet entrepreneurs. We have named the Israel-loving financier and Board member of Facebook, Peter Thiel, in our section on that company.\n\nThiel togeher with the Ukrainan Jew Max Rafael Levchin founded PayPal. The company was then bought by eBay. In an excerpt from \"Once You're Lucky, Twice You're Good: The Rebirth of Silicon Valley and the Rise of Web 2.0\", by Sarah Lacy, (see: http://www.metroactive.com/metro/06.11.08/cover-supermen-0824.html ), we can see how Skoll \"became friends with the PayPal crew\" of Jews and even entered the movie business:\n\nThe PayPal mafia even had Hollywood success. Jeff Skoll was one of the first eBay executives who became friends with the PayPal crew when eBay bought the company in 2002. He started up Participant Productions on a lark, and it has been one of the most profitable productions companies in Hollywood. Among its first four films were Syriana, Good Night, and Good Luck, North Country, and An Inconvenient Truth. Skoll's success convinced Max and Peter to start dabbling in Hollywood, bankrolling the 2006 indie flick Thank You for Smoking, along with David Sacks, PayPal's former chief operating officer.While Sacks continued to play the Hollywood game, he also launched a new social networking site for families, called Geni.com. It allows people to fill out their family trees and link them to the family trees of spouses and in-laws. Anyone on the tree can add to the tree, the idea being that over time you discover people you're related to that you didn't know. It's a bold idea, one of the first Web 2.0 start-ups aimed squarely at families. Peter Thiel, naturally, backed it early on. And in Geni's first venture capital round with Charles River Ventures, it got nosebleed $100 million valuation. The CRV partner who wrote the check was George Zachary, Skoll's early partner in Participant Productions and a friend of Max and Peter's. By 2006, the PayPal mafia was an incestuous world where, for now, everyone seemed to be making lots of money.\n\n​\n\nJust to clarify both David Sacks, PayPal's former chief operating officer, and George Zachary, \"Skoll's early partner in Participant Productions and a friend of Max and Peter's\", are Jewish.\n\nAnother Jew in Skolls present entourage is Larry Brilliant who we detail more in our section on Google where he for 3 years was responsible for Googles philanthropic arm Google.org. In 2009 Brilliant joined a new organisation set up by Jeff Skoll. But Dr. Brilliant also said he would remain as an advisor to Google.\n\nSkoll was President of eBay until 1998 when he became Vice President, Strategic Planning and Analysis, until back problems necessitated his departure from full-time employment at the company. Once eBay's second largest stockholder (behind only Omidyar) he subsequently cashed out a portion of his company holdings, yielding him around $2 billion."
