The document discusses different options for business intelligence (BI) on big data. It describes three major approaches: ETL to RDBMS, monolithic (all-in-one) solutions, and SQL-on-Big Data. For ETL to RDBMS, data is extracted, transformed, and loaded from a big data store like HDFS into a relational database for analysis. Monolithic solutions provide both data visualization and execution capabilities within a single software platform. SQL-on-Big Data utilizes a SQL query engine sitting on top of a big data platform to enable BI tools to directly query the data.",
