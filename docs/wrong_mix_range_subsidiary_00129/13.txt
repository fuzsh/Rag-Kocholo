Josh Kushner

Founder , Thrive Capital

He may be one of those Kushners (his father , Charles Kushner , founded Kushner Companies , the diversified real estate investment company , in 1985 , where Josh is a principal director) , but there’s a reason why this Kushner has been featured in Forbes’ as well as Vanity Fair’s “Next Establishment.” Founder of social gaming company Vostu and Thrive Capital, an early-stage firm that invests in media (brother Jared is publisher of the New York Observer) and Internet, the firm made a name for itself by investing in Instagram – and “doubling its money in 72 hours” (Forbes).

He is co-founded Oscar, a health insurance startup “focused on utilizing technology, design and data to humanize healthcare.” Since the company’s launch last year, Oscar has enrolled thousands of New York customers and has realized tens of millions of dollars in annualized revenue. Not to worry – he’s still very much an active investor. And a good one to know!

Allison Goldberg

Vice President & Managing Director, Time Warner Investments

She is interested primarily in adtech, music, gaming and social media, but is open to looking at anything that fits into divisions of Time, Inc., Warner Brothers, HBO or Turner. When it comes to impressing her and Time Warner Investments, her biggest questions are, “Is the company already providing a service in something we would want to launch? Why Time Warner? Why is this an interesting company to begin with? Why is Time Warner the right investor?” Hey, best to be prepared.
