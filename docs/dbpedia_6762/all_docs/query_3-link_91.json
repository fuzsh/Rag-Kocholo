        "text": "Rudyard Kipling spent the second half of his life at Bateman's, his solid Jacobean home in the Weald which had been \"untouched and unfaked\" by Victorian \"improvers\". Each morning he went to his study to write or to pace up and down on his Indian rugs while he worked out the rhythms of his verses.\n\nAs he was short, he had his English walnut chair placed on blocks so that he could sit comfortably at his French walnut table. Around the blotter are cherished objects, a pewter ink pot, a tin box for pins, a lacquered canoe-shaped pen tray for the ink brushes he used to obliterate redundant words.\n\nAfter lunch Kipling tramped across his fields, slashing at nettles with a walking stick, before returning to his study and sprawling on the oak day bed with a book. He described himself as a \"hasty and gluttonous reader\", and the bookcases (opposite and to the left of the windows) still contain the works of favourite authors such as Jane Austen and Walter Scott.\n\nIn his study he occasionally received visitors such as Stanley Baldwin, the cousin he thought too left-wing, and Rider Haggard, the author of King Solomon's Mines, who gave advice about planting apples and grumbled about the state of the empire. But intruders were usually discouraged by Carrie, Kipling's bossy and restrictive wife, whose portrait hangs above the fireplace. It was painted by another of the writer's cousins, Philip Burne-Jones, son of the pre-Raphaelite artist.\n\nIn a previous home, the house they built in Vermont, Carrie had installed her desk in an ante-room outside her husband's study. His room at Bateman's was not so physically protected, but the portrait is a reminder of her determination to keep him at work and under her control. Her attitude was mistaken as well as unnecessary. As PG Wodehouse observed, Kipling's work \"depended on messing around and talking to people\", but his wife \"kept him rigidly excluded from the world\". The study, beamed and beautiful as it is, was a bit of a prison."
