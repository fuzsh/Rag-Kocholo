        "text": "Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India on the 30th of December 1865. When he was 5 he was sent to England to be educated. His schooling over, he returned to India where he found employment as the Principal of the Mayo College of Art, the Curator of the Lahore Museum and the assistant editor of the Civil & Military Gazette, before he left India once more to visit the USA and Africa before settling in the UK.\n\nHis career as a writer began with the publication of some of his poems in 1881. He went on to be a prolific author, having over 30 collections of his short stories, including The Jungle Book, The Second Jungle Book and The Just So Stories published, along with four novels, several works of non-fiction and well over 400 poems. He died on the 18th of January 1936 at the age of 70.\n\nRudyard Kipling is probably best known for his celebration of British imperialism.
