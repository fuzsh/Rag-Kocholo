        "text": "Rudyard Kipling British Nobel Laureate From Bombay, 1926 Postcard\n\nAn old 1926 photo postcard of the great Nobel Laureate Rudyard Kipling from Bombay, now Mumbai. Not many may be aware that Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay. He was born to Alice and Lockwood Kipling in 1865. Lockwood was a professor at the J J School of Art (Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy) which was then under the British administration.\n\nHe was instrumental in the design of Crawford Market Fountain’s decorative panels. He also designed the uniforms and decorations for the Delhi Durbar in 1877. His son Rudyard Kipling gained worldwide acclaim after he was honored with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. He was the first Englishman to get this award for literature.\n\nRead more Once Upon a Time: The Inside Story of Rudyard Kiplingâs Mumbai Connection and âThe Jungle Bookâ\n\nDid you know – Kipling would regularly visit Simla (Shimla), to escape the oppressive heat when he was working as a journalist in Lahore."
