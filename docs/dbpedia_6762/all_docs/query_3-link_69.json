        "text": "This edited article about Rudyard Kipling originally appeared in Look and Learn issue number 700 published on 14 June 1975.\n\nA Great man once said that the most exciting years of our lives are those of our earliest childhood. Then, everything is new and strange; each day brings a fresh adventure. Because we live, at that age, so near to the ground, we see and hear things close to the earth. The memory of these things stays with us all our lives, often coming back very powerfully when we are old.\n\nAll this was undoubtedly true in the life of Rudyard Kipling. He spent his earliest years soaking up a childhood’s impressions of India, where he was born in 1865. For his first three years, he crawled or pottered about under its hot sun and tropical rain. He gazed at the waving palm trees and tall grasses, the riot of flowers, savouring the fragrance of lilies, orchids, dunghills and charcoal fires; he watched the darting lizards, the circling vultures and an occasional snake or mongoose. From the Indian servants of his home, he learned to prattle away in Hindustani, the common language of the markets and kitchens. From them also, he heard strange Indian folk-tales so different to the stories which the average English child first hears.\n\nHis curious name, ‘Rudyard’ was chosen by his godmother, because his parents had first met at a place called Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire, where his father was a designer of pottery. His gifts as an artist and sculptor, together with a taste for adventure which his son certainly inherited, gained Rudyard’s father a job under the Government of India. He was sent to Bombay in the summer of 1865, with his wife Alice, whom he had married in the previous March. His task there was to revive the dying art of India’s artists and craftsmen, at the newly opened Bombay School of Art.\n\nThe land to which they went, and where their son was born on the last day of 1865, was not the India which we know today. It was the country of which Queen Victoria had been declared Empress, and which she called “the brightest jewel in the British Crown”. Since the first days of the East India Company, the Indian Empire had gradually come into being. The Indian Mutiny of 1857-58 had ended in British victory, and the transfer of authority to the British Crown. A special Indian Civil Service had been set up, and this took over every aspect of Indian Government. British officials filled all the senior posts, Indians the lesser ones. This system lasted until after the Second World War, but the Kipling family lived there through its hey-day, and even though Rudyard’s father had only a very minor post, the boy grew up with a sense of tremendous pride in British rule and achievements in India, where they held, as he later put it “Dominion over palm and pine.” He became the writer with the greatest gift for expressing in either prose or verse, those feelings and thoughts about “the Empire on which the sun never set” which were so proudly held by most British people well into the present century.\n\nBrief though they were, those three years of infancy in India, left a deep and lasting impression on the little boy Although he did not return until the age of eighteen, when he did come back, he immediately felt at home, and began his career as a writer, a career which was in due course to give the world “THE JUNGLE BOOKS” and many more famous volumes of short stories and verse. The best of these show a deep love and understanding of India, its countryside, and the mystery and wisdom of Indian life.\n\nMeanwhile, young Rudyard’s life followed quite a different course. In those days, the separation of many children from their parents was inescapable for those whose fathers worked overseas. As a result, there were hundreds of private Boarding Schools and plenty of homes which “took in” the children of Civil Servants, Army Officers, and so on. These parents were people who could not possibly educate their children in the hot, unhealthy, and often dangerous parts of the world where they had been sent.\n\nWhen Rudyard’s mother and father left him in England, he was not yet six years old. They left him, together with a younger sister aged three, in the care of a retired Naval Officer and his wife, who lived in Portsmouth. With their foster-father, Rudyard got on well, loving his bluff ways and salty language, and his romantic tales of the sea. But with his foster-mother, “Aunt” Rosa, he was miserable. The two had a ten-year old son of their own, and with him the Kipling children got on worst of all. Being jealous of them, he bullied and teased young Rudyard especially, and constantly made trouble for which Rudyard was often beaten by “Aunt” Rosa. But her favourite punishment was to deprive Rudyard of the one thing which he enjoyed above all else – looking at books. He was an early and tireless reader, but his books were often taken from him as was the lamp by which he read. Parcels of books ordered by his father and sent on to Rudyard by relations, were kept from him. He developed poor eyesight, which the strain of trying to read secretly, in semi-darkness, made worse. From early years he needed glasses with heavy lenses, and in an age when few children wore glasses, these led to a lot of teasing from other boys. The misery of this foster-home went on for five years; his parents were unaware of how badly he was treated, but for him it was a lifelong, bitter memory.\n\nRelief only came when his mother next came to England. When she returned again to India to rejoin her husband, she placed their son, now aged twelve, in a small boarding school, which had the rather grand title of THE UNITED SERVICES COLLEGE, at the seaside village of Westward Ho! in Devon. It was quite a new school, and most of the boys came from families whose parents, like Rudyard’s, were abroad. It could be rough and tough, but by now, Rudyard had gained some toughness of his own, and he could hold out against a bully, whether master or boy, by cunning, if not by force. And he made friends there, friends who were not only to remain throughout his life, but whom he immortalised in a book which became almost as famous a school story as Tom Brown’s School Days. This was Stalky and Co. which, though not often read today, was a great favourite among boys after its first appearance in 1889.\n\nOn the whole, these were happier years. Rudyard could read to his heart’s content, and some of the masters, realising how gifted he was, gave him special help and guided his gift for writing. He not only edited the school magazine, he wrote stories and poems. Far away in Bombay, his proud father had a little volume of his son’s verses privately printed; today it is a collector’s piece, of great value and rarity. But there were all the usual schoolboy adventures, and despite his poor eyesight, which prevented him from any success at games, there was the wonderful coast and countryside around Bideford Bay to explore, a little poaching of rabbits and game to be tried, plays to be acted in the school hall, and the traditional schoolboy pranks of midnight feasts, playing jokes on masters, dodging Chapel Services, and straying out of bounds.\n\nBut in 1882, he was ready to leave and to rejoin his parents. He reached Bombay after travelling out alone on the long sea voyage through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. He reached Bombay in October of that year, to rediscover the splendours and mysteries of an India which today has nearly vanished. But Kipling was soon to record for all time, in Plain Tales from the Hills, Soldiers Three, and a score of other books in prose and verse, the vanished “Imperial India” as no history book could ever do."
