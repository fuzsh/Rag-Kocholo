He went on to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. He was best known for his works of fiction, which have become classics, such as The Jungle Book (1894) and The Man Who Would Be King (1888). His poetry has also added to his reputation, with Mandalay (1890), Gunga Din (1890) and his poem If - (1910) proving popular with subsequent generations."
