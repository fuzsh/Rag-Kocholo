        "text": "Introduction\n\nEach one of us can look back and identify something in the past which has made a lasting impact and remains etched in our memory. This may be a person, a book, a piece of music, a song, a film, a poem or some significant event.\n\nFor me, the poem “IF” by Rudyard Kipling is unforgettable and over the years, events in life have increasingly revealed the depth and meaning of the words.\n\nThe poem was first taught to us in school and I recall my father trying to explain the meaning to me, as a part of my English literature studies. At that stage the poem was just an academic challenge and it would be very unrealistic to expect that its true meaning and deep life philosophy would be comprehensible to a school student. However, this poem has particularly remained in my memory and over a period of time, experiences have revealed and validated the powerful and timeless tenets embedded in its verses. The wisdom it contains are tools to face life’s challenges in all spheres. It is an invaluable guide which can also be used by leaders to develop and strengthen their leadership capabilities.\n\nAbout the poet\n\nRudyard Kipling, was born in Mumbai on December 30, 1865. He died on January 18, 1936, in London. He was an English short-story writer, poet, and a novelist chiefly remembered for his celebration of British imperialism, his tales and poems of British soldiers in India, and his stories for children. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907.\n\nWhat prompted the poem: “IF”?\n\nAccording to Dr. Mardy Grothe who is an author and a psychologist, Rudyard Kipling who was thirty-one years old in 1896, and an internationally-renowned poet and story-teller wrote a poem with a one-word title: \"IF.\" The poem was inspired by \"The Jameson Raid,\" an 1895 military action in the Boer War in South Africa. The raid, led by an English nobleman named Leander Starr Jameson, was considered to be a military disaster for various reasons, but Jameson became a hero in the British press for his courage in attempting the raid and his willingness and courage to take responsibility for the failure of the mission. The entire affair aroused enormous patriotic fervour in England, and Kipling was understandably caught up in the emotions of the times.\n\nThe poem IF by Rudyard Kipling\n\nIf you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;\n\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\n\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n\nOr, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\n\nOr, being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n\nAnd yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;\n\nIf you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\n\nIf you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\n\nIf you can meet with triumph and disaster\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\n\nIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\n\nOr watch the things you gave your life to broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build ’em up with worn out tools;\n\nIf you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\n\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;\n\nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;\n\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\n\nIf you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—\n\nYours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!\n\nThe theme\n\nThe theme of the poem is about the challenges and conditions that we have to face and overcome so as to succeed in life and leave a mark. While the poem has important life lessons for everyone, it has a special significance for leaders who wish to enhance their leadership skills by adopting the tenets prescribed to build a robust, resilient and enduring leadership style which commands respect.\n\nLife lessons from the poem “IF”, by Rudyard Kipling\n\nFirst Stanza\n\n\"If you can keep your head when all about you\n\nAre losing theirs and blaming it on you;\"\n\nThis is a situation which is very familiar to all of us, especially in the corporate world. When things start going awry also starts the blame game. Each one is engaged in a desperate exercise to pass the buck and avoid the responsibility and accountability for failure. Keeping ones cool and adopting a “take charge” approach by seizing the leadership opportunity in adversity, is a powerful way to assert, establish and demonstrate leadership. Paradoxically, an adverse situation can actually be turned to advantage by a calm, level headed approach.\n\n\"If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n\nBut make allowance for their doubting too;\"\n\nMany situations arise which shake our confidence and this is further aggravated by the doubts and aspersions cast on us by others which may include friends, family, colleagues and bosses. A firm belief and confidence in oneself can fortify us to face such situations.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to take note of the feedback and objectively evaluate if there is any merit in the doubts being cast on you. This openness to feedback leads to corrective actions and the leader only emerges stronger.\n\nThe key learning is not to buckle down to criticism but at the same time not to disregard it blindly. Very often it is difficult to maintain a balance between these positions.\n\n\"If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\"\n\nWe live in a world of instant gratification and want everything “now”. This line stresses the importance of patience when it is called for. Precipitate action under such circumstances often proves counterproductive.\n\n\" Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\"\n\nThis deceptively simple line sums up the unfortunate situation which exists around us be it among friends or work colleagues. The tendency to back bite and criticise behind someone’s back is fairly very common. Very often this is accompanied by untruths and baseless rumours. The victim of such malicious attacks, on coming to know of such instances, is often tempted to retaliate in a similar fashion and this ends up setting up a vicious cycle which vitiates the atmosphere, be it in a social or work context.\n\nDifficult as it is, not giving in to the temptation of indulging in such negative behaviour can actually build your reputation and stature as an honest and principled person.\n\n\"Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,\"\n\nBecoming the target of hatred is an unfortunate but common situation faced by all of us in varying degrees. This may be prompted by envy or even by some unwarranted action on our part which triggers this emotion. The important lesson here is not to retaliate in the same form. This is far easier said than done. The tendency to retaliate is hard wired into our “fight or flight \" response mechanism. There is always an apprehension that not responding may be taken as a sign of weakness and may encourage even more negative behaviour against us. In the present context, social media platforms provide multiple means of instant retaliation.\n\nIt definitely takes courage and maturity to understand that carrying negative emotions such as hatred, actually exacts a toll from us and negative emotions cloud our judgement and impede rational actions. It requires a strong person to continue to show love and respect to others even when they may show their hatred towards us. A person who has the maturity to react in such a balanced way is not weak, but has extraordinary strength. Unfortunately, the popular culture projects the so-called heroes who are able to instantly react, often violently and seek revenge, and tend to become role models.\n\n\" And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;\"\n\nThis is a very important line which cautions against becoming proud because one has understood and imbibed the qualities mentioned in the poem. No one likes to interact with a proud and pompous person who struts around wearing a crown of self-righteousness. Such an approach negates the very qualities and sets us up for failure because persons around us feel intimidated and may not readily offer their collaboration and cooperation. Such a situation can be disastrous for a leader, especially in the corporate world.\n\nSecond stanza\n\n\" If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\"\n\nThis is a line which has special significance today. We live in exciting times wherein any one can dream big and work towards achieving those dreams with creativity, innovations and efforts. This is demonstrated by the plethora of start-ups, some of which emerge as unicorns and many others that fall by the way side. None of this would be possible without the big and sometimes audacious dreams of entrepreneurs in all walks of life. In fact, some of the spectacular success stories seen around the world, are based on bold dreams which would have been rejected out of hand a decade ago.\n\nThe lesson here is that dreams fuel success only when accompanied by hard on ground actions. Merely living in dream world will achieve nothing. This is particularly applicable to the leaders who are unable bridge the gap between ideas and execution. They believe that their role is to only ideate and the conversion to reality is delegated to teams below. No doubt the team plays a significant role in execution, however the leader is expected to inspire the team by occasionally rolling up sleeves and dirtying hands by demonstrating efficient execution. Such leaders earn and sustain the respect of their teams.\n\n\" If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\"\n\nThis line further elaborates the ideas explained above and reiterates the importance of converting thoughts into actions. The lesson here for armchair leaders is that, at some point thinking has to be converted into actions.\n\n\" If you can meet with triumph and disaster\n\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same;\"\n\nThese two lines convey the most profound message which is extremely difficult to comprehend and even more difficult to apply in day-to-day life, either in the personal or work context.\n\nIn our single-minded pursuit of success any victory or triumph is celebrated while any setback or disaster is dreaded. The message is to treat both situations with equanimity. No doubt a simple message but extraordinarily difficult to imbibe. Any one success does not carry any guarantee for repeated success and hence there is a need to guard against complacency. Similarly, a setback or failure is not the end but an opportunity to learn, move on towards success and should not be a reason to give up. Keeping this balanced approach helps us to face both situations in a mature and pragmatic manner such that we are not carried away or overwhelmed when faced with either “Triumph” or “Disaster”. These are referred to as imposters or cheats because neither reflects an enduring situation and may deflect us from our real goals which do not end with a single victory or failure.\n\n\" If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\n\nTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\"\n\nThese lines reiterate some of the lessons conveyed in the previous lines with further nuances. These days we see much of this in the form of posts on Twitter and other social media wherein people are seen vehemently defending their statements claiming that they are being “misquoted” by some other person. The short lesson here is that such misrepresentations have to be taken in one’s stride without getting unduly perturbed. Perhaps a larger lesson would be to be circumspect in the first place and avoid statements or conversations which are likely to be misquoted.\n\n\" Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,\n\nAnd stoop and build ’em up with worn out tools; \"\n\nThese lines convey a very hard-hitting message regarding resilience and inner strength required to face adversities. Particularly in the world of work there are situations when we see our ideas and projects, into which we have invested tremendous time, efforts and reputation, failing or being rejected. The reasons could be poor planning, adverse environment, changes in management, policy, priorities, disruptive technology or some other unforeseen eventuality.\n\nIt is very natural to personalise such a calamity and succumb to dejection and withdrawal from further efforts. Often, younger leaders, who have not weathered such storms, find it difficult to come to terms with such setbacks. Such adversities bring out the tenacity of strong leaders who are able to put the adverse situation behind them and focus on new targets and goals even when they are saddened or fatigued by the efforts which have not borne fruits. Worn out tools includes the state of mind which is perhaps benumbed by the adverse situation, but still has the capability of battling on against all odds to overcome the situation.\n\nThird Stanza\n\n\" If you can make one heap of all your winnings\n\nAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\n\nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\n\nAnd never breathe a word about your loss;\"\n\nThe previous theme is continued in these lines. While we plan for success it should be borne in mind that there could be circumstances which can totally upset our plans and calculations. However, this does not stop a leader from planning and taking risks, which is the essence of any business enterprise. There is hardly any human endeavour which is “failure proof”. There are so many examples where long-standing successful ventures have faced a sudden collapse either due to unexpected socio-economic changes, technology upgradation, changes in legislation, unexpected competition and so on. Sometimes these catastrophic events can happen at a personal level in the form of an accidental injury, health crisis, job loss, natural calamities etc.\n\nThe important lesson here is not to spend time in lamenting, blaming or seeking sympathy. It is far more fruitful to re-engage one’s energy and focus on rebuilding and fighting back.\n\nThere is another important aspect of leadership which is addressed in these lines. This is regarding the ability of a strong leader to take well thought out and calculated risks in a decisive manner, even after having faced failure. Many of us become very risk averse especially after an adverse event, where our decisions may have gone wrong. It is important that even after failure, the focus should continue on learning from mistakes and getting on with the task of rebuilding by maintaining self-confidence as well as the confidence and trust of the team. History is replete with examples of strong-minded inspirational leaders with tenacity and grit who have emerged even stronger after adversity. The question is - are we that type of a leader?\n\n\" If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\n\nTo serve your turn long after they are gone,\n\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing in you\n\nExcept the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;\"\n\nThe qualities of tenacity, resilience and both physical and mental stamina are vividly explained in these lines. A strong leader has to draw upon reserves of strength to face and overcome situations of adversity. Both in personal and work life, persons/leaders lacking core strength may succumb and give up the struggle in the face of continuing challenges. On the other hand, a strong person/leader does not give up the struggle and surrender to the circumstances. Such persons fight back on all fronts; conquering fear and emotions (Heart), applying intelligence and knowledge (Nerve) and physical stamina (Sinew). Fortunately, most of us do not face situations where we are fully tested to our physical or mental limits. Sometimes, even in moderately stressful situations, many of us come to a conclusion that we have reached, what we consider, as the breaking point. Little do we realise or draw upon the amazing reserves of strength and courage that human beings possess.\n\nLeaders who are serious about their overall growth would do well to invest time in some reasonably demanding physical activity to test their limits and push the envelope by will power and determination. This will stand them in good stead if and when they are faced with tough situations, either in their personal or professional life, which may make demands on their physical or mental capabilities.\n\nFourth stanza\n\n\"If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\n\nOr walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;\"\n\nThese lines emphasise the fine nuances of managing interactions both at a personal and professional level. An example from the work place may help to understand this important point. There are some leaders who try to cultivate their image as a “popular” leader by inappropriate interactions with their teams during which they may make loose and populist statements e.g. derogatory comments about the Top Bosses or about the Company policies, which they mistakenly believe, will make them more liked by the team members. This actually has the reverse effect and adversely impacts the authority and dignity of that leader. In reality, teams look up to leaders they respect and readily see through the shallow attempts to garner popularity. A good leader knows that while it is crucial to be in touch with, interact and communicate with teams, it is also important to maintain the fine balance between excessive familiarity and aloofness.\n\nThe lines also highlight an opposite situation wherein certain people / leaders lose touch with ground reality because they think that they are far superior and their station in life only warrants mingling with the upper echelons of society or Top leadership in an organisation. Such an approach is also flawed and deprives the person / leader of the real life on ground insights which are essential inputs to take rational and balanced decisions. In organisations, such an approach may have even more dangerous consequences if products, services or even employee policies are designed and launched with little or no understanding of the real needs of the target population. Many times, it is not considered important to ascertain the ground reality or it is mistakenly assumed that persons at the top have all the insights, without thinking it necessary to descend from the ivory tower.\n\n\" If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much;\"\n\nThese lines add further dimensions to the importance of maintaining a balance in life. We are instinctively drawn towards loving friends and shun our enemies. It is important not to be overly swayed by either because it may impair our judgement and prompt actions which are not necessarily in our best interest.\n\nThe second line emphasises the essence of the oft quoted phrase “familiarity breeds contempt”. It is important to maintain a certain distance in all interactions, personal or work related. This prompts others to respect our identity and not take us for granted. This message adds to the theme of the earlier lines, and cautions against the temptation to surrender your point of view, opinion or identity, for the sake of being accepted or merging with the crowd, either in the social or work context. This misplaced desire to “blend in “may prevent us from performing our duty, by taking actions which may not necessarily make us popular.\n\n\"If you can fill the unforgiving minute\n\nWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run\"\n\nThese lines bluntly make us face the reality that the passage of time is merciless, unrelenting and we have to make each second count by putting in hard efforts and tangible and discernible contributions, in whichever activity we are engaged.\n\nIn all areas of work, we are familiar with various input/output ratios and productivity measures. Imagine that you are able to achieve one unit of work (whatever it may be) in 60 seconds, this works out to a ratio of 1.66 % (1 / 60 x 100), imagine further that you decide to take it easy and achieve the same task over 2 minutes or 120 seconds, the ratio sharply drops to 0.83% (1 / 120 x 100). The math is very simple but the implications are huge. You may substitute any measure of activity in the numerator and units of time in the denominator. That is the basic measure of our “life productivity”. It is the stark measure of the “distance run”.\n\nInstead of finding excuses and blaming our lack of progress and achievement on extraneous factors, it would far more fruitful to understand the simple calculation above and immediately take the responsibility and commence actions to improve and maintain our life productivity.\n\n\"Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\n\nAnd—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! \"\n\nThe final lines tell us that if we fulfil the demanding conditions as explained in the earlier lines, we can practically achieve anything that we set our mind to. There is no goal that is beyond us and no mountain too high to be surmounted.\n\nWe have often heard the phrase, that there is always “room at the top”. What this means is that there is little competition for a person who is focussed, dedicated, determined and committed to achieve the goals set out. We often do not put in the requisite efforts citing the ready excuse that there is far too much competition, the rules are not fair, someone is more privileged and so on. The reality is that there is a severe shortage of persons, both in the social and work context, who are equipped, and more importantly willing, to put in “sixty seconds’ worth of distance run”.\n\nSuch a person will not only succeed in whatever they set out for themselves, but will have fulfilled a higher purpose, for which we are destined, by virtue of being born as human beings. We can become complete and perfect human beings.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt should be remembered that Rudyard Kipling wrote this poem for his son, as it is addressed in the very last line. Rudyard Kipling wanted to impart life lessons to his son and show the right way to be a complete leader in the future. However, this powerful message is for all of us who are seeking to achieve our true potential in any form of human endeavour.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
