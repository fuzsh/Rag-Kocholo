        "text": "Rudyard Kipling\n\n1961 US first edition cover\n\nPublication\n\n1960\n\nFormat\n\nMonograph\n\nSeries\n\nThe Bodley Head Monographs\n\nCollection\n\nArthur Ransome, Rudyard Kipling, Walter de la Mare (1968)\n\nRudyard Kipling is a monograph on the writer and his works for children, published in 1960 in the Bodley Head Monographs series. It was collected alongside Arthur Ransome by Hugh Shelley and Walter de la Mare by Leonard Clark, which also focus on their subjects' writing for children. Kathleen Lines was the series general editor.\n\nA highly condensed version of the text appeared as the article \"Kipling for Children\" in The Kipling Journal no. 156 in December 1965.\n\nSummary[]\n\nRudyard Kipling was born in 1865 in Bombay, the son of John Lockwood Kipling, principal of the School of Art. At age 5, Rudyard and his younger sister Trix were taken to England to board with a guardian whom Kipling refers to in his autobiography as \"The Woman,\" who abused him mentally and physically for the next six years. During this period he discovered reading, and spent yearly holidays with his beloved aunt Georgie Burne-Jones, wife of the Pre-Raphaelite painter. Kipling's mother discovered the abuse when he was 11, and he was sent to the United Service College in Devon, which inspired Stalky & Co (1).\n\nIn 1882 Kipling rejoined his parents in Lahore where his father directed the Museum (which later appeared in Kim), where he worked as assistant editor for the Civil and Military Gazette, for which he began writing Plain Tales from the Hills and accumulated the experience which would inform his portrayal of life in India. In 1889 he went to London, where he became hugely celebrated and well-paid. He befriended Walcott Balestier, with whom he wrote The Naulahka, and to whose sister Carrie he became informally engaged. Soon after returning to India in 1891, Kipling received word that Balestier had died, and he left for England and married Carrie. They settled in her home of Brattleboro, Vermont, where The Jungle Book and their eldest child Josephine, the \"Best Beloved,\" were soon produced (2).\n\nThe Second Jungle Book, Captains Courageous, and Elsie Kipling were also born in Vermont. The Kiplings moved back to England in 1896, eventually settling in Rottingdean, near their Burne-Jones and Baldwin relations, where John Kipling was born. Kipling began Stalky & Co., Kim, and The Just So Stories, but on a business trip to New York in early 1900, Kipling and all three children took ill, and Josephine died of pneumonia (3). The Kiplings went to South Africa where Kipling covered the Boer War, and began to search Sussex for a new home. They found it at \"Bateman's,\" a country house dating to 1634, where a play put on by Elsie and John inspired Puck of Pook's Hill, its sequel Reward and Fairies, and the last of Kipling's writing for children, the poems in A History of England. John was killed in the Great War; Elsie married; and Kipling died at the age of 70 on January 22nd, 1936 (4).\n\nSutcliff notes that she has omitted much biographical detail that did not inform Kipling's writing for children, the subject of her study. She selects the two Jungle Books, Captains Courageous, Stalky & Co., Kim, The Just So Stories, Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies as her recommendations for children, commenting that Kipling's volumes of short stories are on mixed subjects and not for the average child, the novel The Light That Failed more likely to appeal to adolescents, and that she loathes Thy Servant, a Dog (5).\n\nSutcliff first considers The Jungle Book (1894) and The Second Jungle Book (1895), her own introduction to Kipling at age 5 or 6. As a child she loved both their strangeness and Kipling's power to write his characters and situations \"from the inside out;\" as an adult she came to see the underlying theme of divided loyalties in the Mowgli stories. The novel Kim (1901), its \"sense of crowding riches\" of setting not originally written for children and not likely to appeal to all, shares this looming sadness of division, its \"shameless\" hero Kim pulled between the freedom of the road and Her Majesty's secret service (6).\n\nStalky & Co. (1899), which ten-year-old Sutcliff disliked on first hearing it aloud, was innovative and controversial in the genre of school stories for its realism and the relative subtlety of its morals. She protests the charge of jingoism sometimes levelled at Kipling, pointing to Stalky's satire of jingoists in \"The Flag of their Country.\" The Just So Stories (1902), by contrast, demand to be read aloud, their repetitions and incantations calculated to enthrall small children. Sutcliff's childhood favourites were the two father-and-daughter stories of Taffy and Tegumai, though the final two stories \"The Cat that Walked by Himself\" and \"The Butterfly that Stamped,\" written after Josephine's death, are deeper and more complex (7).\n\nSutcliff first read the novel Captains Courageous (1896) as an adult, and is therefore far less emotionally involved with it. Like Kim, it was not written for children, and combines vividness of setting with looseness of plot, though Sutcliff considers its atmosphere and characters less engaging. Puck of Pook's Hill (1906) and its sequel Rewards and Fairies (1910) were written for Elsie and John (who appear as Una and Dan), and matured with them. The stories in Rewards and Fairies are more complex, polished, and difficult than those in Puck, yet Sutcliff finds that the images and characters of the earlier book are more vivid and memorable, particularly Parnesius and Sir Richard Dalyngridge. She points out, after Charles Carrington, that the hero of the books is Old Hobden, who embodies the continuity of the land and people (8).\n\nSutcliff reports that in contemporary libraries in London and Toronto, The Just So Stories and the Jungle Books remain popular with children, teachers, and parents; while the Puck books are neglected, both fairies and historical fiction being out of fashion with children. Kim, Captains Courageous, and Stalky also have their adherents, and Kipling is perhaps more popular among Torontonians than Londoners. Sutcliff believes that Kipling, though certainly not for every child, still has much to offer the modern reader: original and evocative writing, worthwhile values, and a gift for empathy that lets the reader \"perform the minor miracle of self-identification which so much helps a small growing mind to stretch itself and open out.\" (9)\n\nThe book concludes with a bibliography of Kipling's books of interest to children in print at the time of writing (10).\n\nChronology[]\n\n1857-8 – Indian Mutiny and establishment of the Indian Empire\n\n1865 – Birth of Rudyard Kipling in Bombay\n\n1868 – Birth of Trix Kipling\n\n1871 – Rudyard and Trix left in the care of \"The Woman\" in England\n\n1877 – Kipling children removed from \"The Woman\", Kipling goes to United Service College\n\n1882 – Kipling leaves the United Service College, aged 16, and returns to India\n\n1885 – Kipling begins writing Plain Tales from the Hills for the Civil and Military Gazette\n\n1887 – Kipling transfers to the Allahabad Pioneer; writes the The Story of the Gadsbys\n\n1889 – Kipling goes to London; The Ballad of East and West published in November\n\n1891 – Kipling returns to Lahore after world tour; Walcott Balestier dies\n\n1892 – Kipling marries Carrie Balestier; The Naulahka published; The Jungle Book begun; Josephine Kipling born\n\n1894 – The Second Jungle Book written; visit to Kipling's parents in England\n\n1896 – Elsie Kipling born; the Kiplings move to England; Stalky & Co. begun\n\n1897 – the Kiplings move to Rottingdean; John Kipling born; Kim and The Just So Stories begun\n\n1899 – Stalky and Co. published\n\n1900 – Kiplings visit New York; Josephine dies 6 March\n\n1901 – Kipling covers the Boer War in South Africa; finishes Kim\n\n1906 – Puck of Pook's Hill published\n\n1910 – Rewards and Fairies published\n\n1911 – C.R.L.
