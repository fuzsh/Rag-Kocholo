British writer Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) was born in Mumbai, India and educated in England. He returned to India in 1882 to live with his parents. Kipling’s experiences during his stay in India inspired him to write and publish several short stories. These were featured in his collection titled Plain Tales From the Hills (1888), which became very popular in England. Kipling also published a second collection of short stories titled Wee Willie Winkie (1888), and American Notes (1891), which featured his first impressions of America. Amongst Kipling’s bestselling books are The Jungle Book (1894) and The Second Jungle Book (1895). The prolific author was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907 for “originality of imagination, virility of ideas, and remarkable talent for narration” which characterise his creations.
