        "text": "Jump to…\n\nBest of Lewes\n\nThe first town in the first state is famous for its maritime history, state park and dining\n\nBest Historic Area\n\nIn 1631, the Dutch arrived in what is now Lewes to start a whaling colony, and fishing remained the leading industry for generations. In the 1950s, Lewes was a top fishery for menhaden, used to make fish meal and fish oil. Locals called the pungent aroma the “smell of money.” It kept developers from building motels downtown. When the fish factories closed, the old buildings were still standing. Thanks to the Lewes Historical Society, many were restored, and in 1977 the Lewes Historic District entered the National Register of Historic Places. Worth visiting: the society complex at Shipcarpenter Square (a collection of buildings representing Sussex County history), the Lewes History Museum, the Zwaanendael Museum and the Cannonball House, hit by the British during the War of 1812.\n\nLewes Historical Society, 110 Shipcarpenter St., historiclewes.org; Lewes Chamber of Commerce, 120 Kings Highway, leweschamber.com\n\nBest Park\n\nCape Henlopen State Park is a haven for swimmers, surfers, hikers, campers, bicyclists and birders. Back in the 1940s, it was home to Fort Miles, a World War II Army installation. The concrete fire towers used for target practice dot the sand from the cape to the Indian River Inlet. Battery 519, a bunker built into the Great Dune, is now the Fort Miles Museum. But most people come for the 6 miles of sparkling coastline and the fabulous trails. Seaside Nature Center boasts a touch tank and a borrow-a-bike program. The beach by the bathhouse has lifeguards. Entrance to the park is $10 for out-of-state vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15099 Cape Henlopen Drive, destateparks.com/beaches/capehenlopen\n\nBest Rail Trails\n\nFormer railroad tracks are becoming flat trails for runners, bicyclists and walkers. The Georgetown-Lewes Trail runs on the Delaware Coast Line Railroad’s old bed. When complete, the trail will be 17 miles and end in Georgetown. For now, it’s 10 miles with endpoints at Fisher Road and Gills Neck Road. The trail cuts through Lewes—and over some busy roads—and links to the Junction & Breakwater Trail, which runs to Rehoboth. At various points along the trail there’s free parking, including a lot next to the trail at Old World Breads (32191 Nassau Road in Lewes).\n\nAdvertisement\n\ndelawaregreenways.org\n\nBest Farmers Market\n\nSavvy shoppers know to head to the Historic Lewes Farmers Market, open 8 a.m. to noon on Saturdays through Sept. 28. This is a producer-only market, meaning you won’t find third-party vendors, and all 35 of the Saturday morning participants must commit to every event but two. Along with produce, you’ll find mushrooms, eggs, chicken, dairy products and artisanal goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge H.P. Smith Park, Johnson and Dupont avenues, historiclewesfarmersmarket.org\n\nBest Chocolate\n\nEdie Bee’s is a Parisian-style boutique artfully packed with sweet delights. Individual chocolates seem almost too beautiful to eat—almost. In 2020, Michelle Teed purchased the shop from founder Leisa Berlin, and the quality remains. Along with exquisite chocolates, you’ll find hard candies, gummies, chocolate-covered pretzels and caramels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n115 Second St., ediebeeslewes.com\n\nBest Dining Atmosphere\n\nFor a big serving of charm, head to the three Victorians lined up on Savannah Road. Heirloom is an acclaimed establishment in a circa-1899 Victorian. Owner Meghan Lee outfitted the multiroom restaurant with vintage plates, mismatched silverware and botanical prints. The menu changes seasonally, and the cocktails are creative. At Raas, an Indian/pan-Asian restaurant with a wraparound porch and attached gazebo, the menu is an upscale approach to familiar dishes, including tandoori and crabcakes. Bramble & Brine at The Buttery serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and has a lounge with craft cocktails. It occupies the mansion at the corner of Savannah Road and Second Street. The name pays tribute to owner Megan Kee’s first restaurant, Bramble & Brine, in Rehoboth Beach, and The Buttery, a restaurant that once occupied the grande dame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeirloom, 212 Savannah Road, heirloomdelaware.com; Raas, 210 Savannah Road, raaslewes.com; Bramble & Brine at The Buttery, 102 Second St., bramble-brine.com\n\nBest Family-Friendly Brewpub\n\nBackyard barbecues and lazy afternoons in a hammock inspired the beach-themed Crooked Hammock Brewery. The owners had small children when the brewpub opened in 2015, and the enclosed yard features cornhole games, a playground for kids and a firepit. In warm weather, garage-style doors open to the beer garden and backyard. The menu has such cookout favorites as grilled meats and refreshing salads, and there’s a kids menu. A huge pretzel—a brewery requisite—is a bestselling appetizer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n36707 Crooked Hammock Way, crookedhammockbrewery.com\n\nBest Cruises\n\nThe Parsons family’s red-and-white boats are familiar sights on the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal; the family has been running fishing expeditions from Lewes Harbour since 1937 through its business, Fisherman’s Wharf. Over the years, sightseeing excursions and cruises have been added, including whale and dolphin watches, seal watches, and fireworks cruises. One of the most beautiful outings is a two-hour sunset cruise past the Harbor of Refuge and East End lighthouses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n107 Anglers Road, fishlewes.com\n\n—Pam George\n\nBest of Rehoboth Beach\n\nA mile-long boardwalk anchors this town. Keep an eye out for President Biden, who has a home here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Non-Beach Outdoor Experience\n\nThe partly shaded Gordons Pond Trail is a welcome option for a scenic walk, run or bike ride in season, when Rehoboth’s beach and boardwalk are less accessible to dogs and cyclists. The 3.2-mile crushed-gravel course inside Cape Henlopen State Park skirts a 900-acre marsh surrounding a serene brackish-water lagoon and features a half-mile stretch of elevated boardwalk to protect the wetlands. Look for snowy egrets, willets, laughing gulls, ospreys and more at the three overlooks. The ocean beach here is less congested than Rehoboth’s. Free to walk or bike in; $10 per out-of-state car. Dogs on leashes no longer than 6 feet are allowed on the trail and beach.\n\nNorth end of Ocean Drive, destateparks.com/wwwroot/maps/cape-henlopen/wolfe-neck-gordons-pond.pdf\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Place To Be Inspired\n\nA pine-shaded, birdsong-filled historic site tucked away in upscale Henlopen Acres, the Rehoboth Art League provides a cool escape. Art lovers can wander several galleries offering rotating exhibitions and works by members, and stop by the creatively stocked gift shop. The docent-staffed, Colonial-era Homestead is also free to visit. On the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance, it displays furniture, artifacts and decorative items of that time, and includes a historically accurate formal garden.\n\n12 Dodds Lane, rehobothartleague.org\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Takeout\n\nIt’s window service only at Frank & Louie’s Italian Specialties, a family-run eatery named after brothers Frank and Louie Bascio, who you’ll see on-site. The hearty sandwiches are made to order, with freshly sliced meats and cheeses served on crusty ciabatta rolls delivered daily from a New York bakery. You also can get cooked and chilled entrees such as eggplant Parmesan, mushroom-stuffed chicken and lasagna. The hand-baked desserts are mom Diane’s recipe; the cookies—pignoli and macaroons among them—are especially in demand. There’s no online ordering, so call in your request (302-227-5777).\n\n58 Baltimore Ave., frankandlouies.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Breakfast/Brunch\n\nA recent expansion has made it a bit easier to nab a table at Egg, open daily from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the historic McQuay’s Market building. The charming whitewashed interior is warmed by wood accents and splashes of red—and images of chickens everywhere. The menu ranges freely from eggs (of course) with a variety of breakfast meats (including pecan wood-smoked bacon), to crab and avocado toast, to poblano stuffed with eggs, cheese and chorizo, to a wine and cocktail list. Can’t decide? You can order just one of an item that typically comes in twos; for example, half a serving of rich eggs Benedict or one lemony crepe.\n\n510 Rehoboth Ave., eggrehoboth.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Raw Bar\n\nHenlopen City Oyster House is a crowd-pleasing restaurant (the Bidens dined there in February) that doesn’t take reservations or offer a happy hour. Folks queue up for tables in the summer and arrive early to snag a spot in the offseason. What’s the hook? The vibe is friendly, the staff is knowledgeable, and the seafood, such as the crispy scallops appetizer and the meaty lobster roll, is top-notch. The ever-changing raw bar menu reads like a sommelier’s pitch—an oyster might be described as having a “subtle salinity” and “hint of sweetness”—and your choices will arrive thoroughly cleaned, skillfully shucked and beautifully presented.\n\n50 Wilmington Ave., hcoysterhouse.com\n\nBest Family Outing\n\nLocated on Rehoboth’s mile-long boardwalk, Funland, a pint-size, family-owned amusement park, is packed with 19 rides, 11 games and infinite nostalgia. Several antique attractions are only part of the retro charm that draws legions of returning families. Tots who wave with tentative pride from the 1940s-era boats (one ticket) grow into teens who shriek happily on the modern Superflip 360 (six tickets). Entry is free. The 75-cent ride tickets never expire. Save by purchasing 25-, 50- or 100-ticket books; you can also preorder online. Perpetually favorite games include Skee-Ball (50 cents) and Derby ($2). New this year: a duck pond game.\n\n6 Delaware Ave., funlandrehoboth.com\n\nBest Bookstore\n\nEstablished in 1975, when Jaws was this beach town’s top-selling book (check the outdoor mural for more), Browseabout Books is a singular survivor among independent bookstores. It has grown into a bustling 13,000-square-foot space offering 35,000 titles—bestsellers, staff picks, local interest, manga, romance, etc., plus a robust selection for kids. Summer events will include local authors Maribeth Fischer and Ethan Joella, and New York Times bestselling novelists Liz Moore and Mary Kubica. You’ll find a coffee bar, as well as an ample array of toys, puzzles, beachy gifts and decor, clothing, jewelry and greeting cards.\n\n133 Rehoboth Ave., browseaboutbooks.com\n\nBest Pickleball Courts\n\nThe four free courts at Rehoboth Beach Elementary School are only a few years old—and still pristine. Plus, they’re dedicated pickleball courts, not tennis courts painted with pickleball lines. Play is limited to after 4:30 p.m. and weekends during the school year, but come summer vacation, picklers can start at 7 a.m. daily. The crowd is friendly, but waits are likely at this first-come, first-served facility. There are also two tennis courts and a basketball court in this complex. Bonus for parents: The school’s large playground is open to the public when school is out.\n\n500 Stockley St.\n\n—Elizabeth Chang\n\nBest of Dewey Beach\n\nLive music, cocktails and water sports draw fun-seekers to this happening town\n\nBest Place to Hear Rock ’n’ Roll\n\nIf you grew up in the D.C. area, chances are you found your way to Bottle & Cork at some point during your youth. The beloved dive bar has a slicker appearance these days, and it remains one of Delmarva’s top venues for curated music in an intimate open-air setting. The cash-only bar is for age 21 and older. Grab a cold beer, find a place to stand and get ready to shake it up with the likes of country artist Justin Moore or British rockers the Struts.\n\n1807 Coastal Highway, bottleandcork.com\n\nBest Beach to Bring Your Dog\n\nFurry friends are allowed on the beach year-round, making Dewey Beach a favorite vacation destination for dog lovers. You can take long walks along the shoreline and, during the offseason, they can play off-leash all day (but must be controllable by voice commands). From Saturday of Memorial Day weekend through Sunday following Labor Day your pooch is allowed on the beach before 8:30 a.m. and after 5:30 p.m. All owners must purchase a Dewey Beach license for their dog online or at the kiosk beside town hall. Many hotels are dog-friendly, too, and cleanup bags are available at each dune entrance. Dewey is the site of the Golden Jubilee in May and September, when hundreds of golden retrievers converge on the beach.\n\n105 Rodney Ave., townofdeweybeach.com\n\nBest Brewery\n\nWithin the tiny enclave of Dewey Beach is the mighty Dewey Beer Co. (DBC). Open since 2015, the brewery began producing pale ales and fruity sours, and rapidly gained a following. This year, the brewery was named best brewpub in the nation in USA Today’s10Best Readers’ Choice Awards. Along with a rotation of about a dozen beers on tap, the gastropub serves a lineup of sandwiches and appetizers. DBC has opened new outposts in Denver and Harbeson, Delaware, but Dewey is where this party started.\n\n2100 Coastal Highway, deweybeerco.com\n\nBest Outfitter\n\nDewey Beach Water Sports has everything you need for an unforgettable day on the water. Located on the northeast corner of Rehoboth Bay, the outfitter begins with safety instructions and demonstrations, and then it’s all aboard. Get the family together for an afternoon on a pontoon boat. Skim the surface on a guided personal watercraft tour. Choose a kayak or stand-up paddleboard to navigate the coves around Thompson Island. Families can ride on a Banana Boat.\n\n113 Dickinson St., deweybeachwatersports.com\n\nBest Local Produce\n\nFrederick Fifer opened his first farm stand in 1919, and today, the family has an orchard and two markets, including a seasonal location in Dewey Beach. Fifer’s Farm Kitchen in Dewey sells produce from the family’s farm and orchards, along with ready-made products and grocery items. Fifer’s Farm Kitchen also has a small deli, where you can order breakfast, sandwiches and salads to-go. Feel like picking your own? Pluck strawberries, peaches and more at Fifer’s Orchard in Camden, Delaware. Open seasonally; call 302-227-8680 for hours.\n\n200 Cullen St., fiferorchards.com\n\nBest Bloody Mary\n\nThe Starboard opened for business around 65 years ago and quickly became a revered Dewey Beach destination. Why this spot? It’s a year-round bar that serves tasty food, hosts live music and is an overall friendly hangout. The menu is big, but the bloody marys are a standout—the perfect accompaniment to a Starboard breakfast. Choose to layer your vodka and tomato juice with olives, bacon, veggies and even crabmeat. Starboard leans into the iconic Delmarva crush cocktail—a combination of vodka, triple sec, soda and fresh squeezed juices over ice—and now serves nine variations.\n\n2009 Coastal Highway, thestarboard.com\n\nBest Tours\n\nFlanked by the Atlantic Ocean, Rehoboth Bay and Indian River Bay, Delaware Seashore State Park is a public beach and home to Indian River Life-Saving Station. This building was constructed in 1876, when the United States Life-Saving Service was called upon to rescue victims of shipwrecks—these teams were the precursor to the U.S. Coast Guard. At the Life-Saving Station, you can listen to a self-guided tour of the small museum on your phone or sign up for a $10 guided or moonlight lantern tour that explains how shipwrecked sailors were saved.\n\n25039 Coastal Highway, destateparks.com\n\nBest Crabcake\n\nCritics often call the tender jumbo lump crabcake at Woody’s Dewey Beach “the best,” and we agree. There’s almost no filler and minimal seasoning, just a quick char on the baseball-size jumbo lump crabmeat, and voila. Try a crabcake on a platter, as a sandwich or on a salad. Add to the experience with a bowl of Maryland crab or cream of crab soup. Woody’s has a lively bar area, a 25-seat patio, and a late-night menu offered until 1 a.m. for revelers enjoying Dewey’s nightlife options.\n\n1904 Coastal Highway, deweybeachbar.com\n\n—Renee Sklarew\n\nBest of Bethany Beach\n\nAn iconic surf shop, a trolley and good eats help make the quiet beach town lively\n\nBest Yoga Experience\n\nThe Bethany Beach Summer Exercise Classes are cherished by locals and visitors alike. Bright and early, people carrying yoga mats convene on the beach to salute the sun as it rises over the waves. Led by local instructors, Sunrise Yoga begins with traditional poses, while Vayu Yoga (a seated, gentle version of yoga) is the second practice. On some days, yoga classes are held in Bethany’s Central Park. Try sports performance, boot camp or Pilates classes, too, or the latest addition: Sunset Yoga with Sound Healing.\n\nClasses ($10-$20 each) are held in Central Park, on the beach in front of Garfield Parkway, and on the beach in front of Ocean View Parkway. townofbethanybeach.com/383/summer-exercise-classes\n\nBest Seafood Restaurant\n\nBluecoast Seafood Grill and Raw Bar delivers an optimal waterfront dining experience thanks to stunning views of Salt Pond and a wide array of seafood. Founded by late James Beard Award-winning chef Matthew James Haley (of Matt’s Fish Camp), this destination restaurant serves classics such as crabcakes and shrimp and grits. Arrive between 4 and 6 p.m. for whatever oysters or clams are available that day for $1 each. Or try fried baby lobster tails and steamed shrimp dumplings to lead off your meal. Accompaniments include curated cocktails, sinful desserts and an overflowing wine list.\n\n30904 Coastal Highway, bluecoastbethany.com\n\nBest Sweet Treats\n\nCheck out the crowds strolling the Bethany boardwalk and chances are they’re sipping a coffee or slurping ice cream from Maureen’s Ice Cream and Desserts. It’s been a staple for 20 years and remains a beloved tradition. Begin your day with zesty coconut oatmeal, then stop by in the afternoon for a refreshing fruit smoothie or Oreo-topped doughnut. After dinner, choose gelato or a frosty milkshake.\n\n99 Garfield Parkway, maureensicecream.com\n\nBest Prepared Foods and Carryout\n\nDiFebo’s Cafe & Deli has you covered for a delicious night at home, whether you’re seeking a small carryout meal or require enough to fill a hungry group of 12. The market prepares trays of rigatoni and meatballs, spicy Firenze chicken with penne pasta, and heaping bowls of antipasto salad that will leave everyone grateful when you say, “Mangia!” Prefer to dine in? Find Italian classics and an expansive wine list. Reservations are recommended.\n\n789 Garfield Parkway, difebos.com/bethany-beach\n\nBest Views\n\nNestled beside the majestic Indian River Inlet Bridge, Big Chill Beach Club resembles a posh resort with multiple bars and a full restaurant. With panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean, the elevated Sunset Lounge is protected from wind and rain by mobile garage doors. There’s also the fully open-air South Bar, where you can sip a cocktail while taking in the sounds of the surf or digging your toes into the sand by the firepits. Big Chill is within Delaware Seashore State Park ($10 parking for non-Delaware residents).\n\n27099 Coastal Highway, bigchillbeachclub.com\n\nBest Transportation\n\nIn much of Bethany, visitors can leave their car behind and ride the Bethany Beach Trolley, an open-air bus that resembles a vintage railcar. Operational from the Friday before Memorial Day through mid-September, the free trolley runs from 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. with 17 regular stops (you also can flag down the driver). The trolley is convenient for getting to and from the beach without worrying about parking—and an easy way to entertain a toddler.\n\ntownofbethanybeach.com\n\nBest Surfing Store\n\nSince it opened in 1980, Bethany Surf Shop has been regarded by many as Delaware’s most prestigious store for surfing wear. Kids hanker for that logo on their clothes, and surfers can find cutting-edge gear. But the shop goes beyond that with instruction and rentals, offering hourlong stand-up paddleboard excursions around the coves of the Assawoman Canal. You can rent surfboards, bodyboards and skim boards, and watch the shop’s pro skim riders on Mondays in the summer from 6 to 7 p.m. on the main beach.\n\n99 Garfield Parkway, bethanysurfshop.net\n\n—Renee Sklarew\n\nBest of Fenwick Island\n\nCrack crabs, visit a marine museum and catch the sunset in this tiny beach town\n\nBest Landmark\n\nDrive over the causeway and you can imagine why the Fenwick Island Lighthouse played an outsize role in the town’s history. The 87-foot tower was operational from 1859 to 1978. Before it was moved inland, ships could see this beacon of light from 15 miles away and know they were approaching land. The keeper’s residence sits beside the tower, and both are maintained by the Friends of the Fenwick Island Lighthouse. While you can’t climb to the top, you can visit the small museum on Friday through Sunday in June, and Thursday through Sunday in July and August to soak up Fenwick’s maritime history.\n\n103 146th St., fenwickislandlighthouse.org\n\nBest Museum\n\nLearn about a pirate’s life on a visit to the charming DiscoverSea Shipwreck Museum. Founded by historian Dale W. Clifton Jr., the free marine archaeology museum is home to an extensive array of treasures recovered from centuries-old, international shipwrecks. Clifton developed his passion for collecting when he uncovered his first treasure in 1979. His mission became researching and acquiring artifacts from the colonial seafaring era, then exhibiting them at this small museum. Among the relics is a Mayan statue, a FeeJee Mermaid and a gold chain designed for Spanish Queen Isabella. Open from late March until November, the museum is located above Sea Shell City, a souvenir shop.\n\n708 Coastal Highway, discoversea.com\n\nBest Entertainment for Younger Kids\n\nEnter the gates of Viking Golf and Thunder Lagoon Water Park and expect to keep cool and carry on (the fun). While this entertainment complex has activities geared for younger kids, adults and teens will love the options, too. Families can chip away at Viking-themed mini golf, launch themselves down a tubular waterslide, zoom around a go-kart track or bob along a lazy river. Viking also has concessions stocked with kid-friendly food, so no one gets cranky.\n\n38960 Island St., fenwickfun.com\n\nBest Vintage Crab Restaurant\n\nThe competition for best pick-and-eat crab spot in Delmarva is stiff, but Fenwick Crab House has attracted loyal crowds of crab lovers for 62 years. Served alongside the bushels of steaming hot crabs are bountiful seafood platters and entrees made with tried-and-true regional recipes. For sides and salads, owner Scott Fornwalt buys produce from nearby farms and purchases seafood directly from local watermen. While the vibe is vintage, the menu has such modern dishes as avocado shrimp ceviche and salmon tacos, along with a lineup of microbrews.\n\n100 Coastal Highway, fenwickcrabhouse.com\n\nBest Gift Shop\n\nStep inside the Seaside Country Store to find an eclectic collection of merchandise. The two-story red barn is packed with dishware, clothing, seasonal decor and nautical-themed items. Food gifts are the main attraction, and here you can sample before you buy, including creamy fudge and house-blended cheeses. A family business for generations, Seaside opened in 1969 and has long been a Fenwick Island landmark.\n\n1208 Coastal Highway, seasidecountrystore.com\n\nBest Restaurant To Watch the Sunset\n\nAs the sun sinks below the horizon, raise your glass to the waterfront views at Harpoon Hanna’s. This lively spot overlooking the Fenwick Island Bridge features a drink menu with eight types of crush cocktails (Delmarva’s classic vodka, soda, triple sec and juice concoction) and seven frozen drinks. At the tiki bar, there’s live music most evenings during the summer. The family-friendly restaurant is hailed for its hefty crabcakes delicately spiced with Old Bay seasoning and the baskets of complimentary corn muffins served with honey butter.\n\n39064 Harpoon Road, harpoonhannasrestaurant.com\n\nBest Seafood Classics\n\nMatt’s Fish Camp has earned a devoted following in Delmarva for more than a decade thanks to the staff’s attention to detail and commitment to quality. Part of the SoDel Concepts restaurant group, this menu skews Americana—think deviled eggs and mac and cheese. If you crave the seafood classics, this is your place. The raw bar showcases a variety of succulent clams, crab legs and oysters. The grits and catfish entree is stellar, and don’t miss the Maine-style lobster roll. Check out the daily specials, too, including half-price wine bottles on Friday nights and $12 lunch combos.\n\n700 Coastal Highway, mattsfishcampfenwick.com\n\n—Renee Sklarew\n\nBest of Ocean City\n\nWater sports, dining and party places abound in the ‘White Marlin Capital of the World’\n\nBest Rooftop Dining\n\nThe menu at Spain Wine Bar features tapas, paella and other dishes from the Iberian Peninsula. The view, however, is decidedly local. Peter Elias’ beautiful restaurant is on the roof of the Cambria Hotel, enabling breathtaking views from indoor and outdoor dining areas. Guests can spot the Route 50 drawbridge, the Ocean City Inlet, West Ocean City and even Assateague. Get ready to post on Instagram, with photo ops including the Ocean City boardwalk’s amusement park and the yacht-filled White Marlin Marina, the headquarters for the annual billfish tournament. (In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dubbed Ocean City the White Marlin Capital of the World.) While the vistas make an impression, people return for the exceptional food, bottomless brunch, Spanish wines and innovative cocktails.\n\n13 St. Louis Ave., spainwinebar.com\n\nBest Place To Get Your Groove On\n\nThe Jamaica-themed Seacrets boasts resort-style amenities. If you like craft cocktails, you’ll appreciate the on-site distillery. Love oysters on the half shell? The raw bar has won awards. And if you like music, check out the summer concert series, the DJs and the lineup of musicians. To preview the action, go to the website, where you can view live cams of the venue, including a nightclub, pier stage on the bay, tiki stage and beach stage. (Minors accompanied by an adult are welcome in the dining areas until 10 p.m.)\n\n117 49th St., seacrets.com\n\nBest Beach Bar\n\nCoconuts Beach Bar & Grill at the Castle in the Sand Hotel brings the tropics to the mid-Atlantic with frozen drinks, palm trees and fresh seafood. Beach servers bring rum punch and other libations to lazy sunbathers. Happy hour is just that: from 5 to 6 p.m. Order two for one. Try O.C.’s famous crushes made with vodka, triple sec, soda and juices over ice. During the summer, the establishment showcases two bands a day for afternoon and evening entertainment.\n\n3701 Atlantic Ave., castleinthesand.com\n\nBest Place To See a Show\n\nAt 10 years old, the Ocean City Performing Arts Center is a youngster on the city’s cultural landscape, but it’s made a lasting impact. A Jay Leno show in May was part of the 2024 lineup, and the venue hosts plays, musicals, tribute bands and symphony performances. It’s also an example of repurposing. Located inside the Roland E. Powell Convention Center, the space once was home to Exhibit Hall C and the ballroom above it. The two were transformed into a two-story auditorium with 1,216 seats, including a removable orchestra section that extends the stage. Parking is free.\n\n4001 Coastal Highway, ococean.com/performing-arts-center\n\nBest Sunsets\n\nOcean City is situated on a slender strip of land, which is a perk for those who enjoy sunrises and sunsets over water. Admittedly, many people prefer the latter, and locals say Northside Park provides the perfect sunset vantage point. The 58-acre park—Ocean City’s largest—has a long pier that juts into Assawoman Bay for uninterrupted views.\n\n200 125th St., oceancitymd.gov/oc/departments/recreation-parks/northside-park\n\nBest Boardwalk Rides/Games\n\nOcean City is famous for its nearly 3-mile oceanfront boardwalk, and the games and rides sweeten the appeal for visitors of all ages. A stop at Trimper Rides is a tradition; it’s been a landmark since the early 20th century, when Margaret and Daniel Trimper created the oasis of fun. The rides range from the little tykes’ carousel to the Tilt-A-Whirl, a looping roller coaster. Trimper owns Marty’s Playland, a five-minute walk from the amusement park, which includes a vintage fortune teller, antique pinball machines and Skee-Ball alleys.\n\nTrimper Rides 700 S. Atlantic Ave., trimperrides.com; Marty’s Playland, 5 Worcester St., martysplayland.com\n\nBest Water Sports Rentals\n\nThe Croker family opened Odyssea Watersports in 1997, and it’s still a family affair that consistently wins Best Jet Ski Rental in OceanCity.com’s Best of Ocean City contest. Customers praise the friendly service and state-of-the-art equipment. The company started with eight personal watercrafts. Not only have they expanded their fleet, but they also offer pontoon boats.\n\n120 52nd St., odysseawatersports.com\n\nBest Dining Experience\n\nWhen Ocean City foodies mention L.A., they don’t mean Los Angeles. They’re singing the praises of Liquid Assets, which evolved from a beer-and-wine store to a liquor shop with a cocktail bar to a full-service restaurant that still sells packaged alcohol. At this acclaimed eatery, even familiar foods are finessed. Consider a French onion potpie made with short ribs, onion broth, Gruyere and an onion pastry. Don’t miss the Smith Island cake.\n\n9301 Coastal Highway, la94.com\n\n—Pam George\n\nThis story appears in the July/August edition of Bethesda Magazine.\n\nRelated Stories"
