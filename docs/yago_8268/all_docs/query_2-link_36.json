        "text": "Ronald “Cary” Daniel, 78, of Lewes, passed away peacefully Monday, March 4, 2024. surrounded by family and lifelong friend, Dr. Michael Daly,\n\nHe was born Dec. 30, 1945, in Hartford, Ky., to Glendall Maurice Daniel and Ina Faye (Young) Daniel. Cary was known to his close friends and family as “Big Cary” and his daughter (namesake) was known as “Little Carrie.”\n\nFrom a young age, Cary exhibited a bright mind and a passion for reading. It is said by his family that he often preferred sitting inside with a good book to playing games outside with his brother and cousins. His passion for reading stayed with him throughout his life, and he spent much time taking in new knowledge about history and other subjects. He knew a little something about just about everything.\n\nThough he was classically introverted, all who met Cary, strangers included, experienced his fun sense of humor. He never missed a Kentucky Wildcats basketball game as a lifelong fan of the team and sport. He obtained his bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from the University of Kentucky in 1968 and was recruited by NASA but turned down the position to support the family business at home. He joined the reserves during the Vietnam War and served for six years. During this time, he met and married the love of his life, Cynthia (Brewer) Daniel.\n\nCary started his career as an engineer and moved his way up the managerial ranks, first managing teams of engineers and then overseeing manufacturing plants. His work opportunities took him from his homeland of Kentucky to Indiana, Missouri, Florida, and Delaware, where he happily resided since the mid-‘90s. He served as the director of operations at Dentsply Caulk, and very much enjoyed the beauty and history of the seaside town of Lewes.\n\nCary loved fatherhood; his favorite life memories were of spending time with his children Brent and Carrie as they grew up. In his later years, Cary took on his cherished role as Papaw to granddaughters Izzy and Vivi.\n\nHe was preceded in passing by his father, Glendall “Glen” Daniel; mother, Ina Faye Daniel; brother, Landreth Michael “Mike” Daniel; and brothers-in-law, Thomas “Britt” Brewer, Brady Brewer and Roger Seacord.\n\nCary is survived by his beloved wife of 49 years, Cynthia “Cindy” Daniel; daughter, Carrie Daniel; son Brent (Maggie) Daniel; granddaughters, Isabelle and Vivian Daniel; sisters-in-law, Sheila Daniel, Zilda (Jim) Wilson, Lorie Gambill, Merry Belle Seacord, Beth Brewer and Clara Brewer; and many beloved nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nAlways calm in the face of life’s curveballs and challenges, Cary overcame many health obstacles in the final 22 of his 78 years, defying the odds on multiple, miraculous occasions. Cary was a true embodiment of mind over matter and was at peace with his long and beautiful life. He carried great love and compassion for his family, friends, and world. May his life and ethos be an inspiration to all.\n\nTo honor Cary’s wishes, there will be no funeral service.\n\nHe requested, in lieu of flowers, that all who knew and loved him carry out an act of kindness in his honor."
