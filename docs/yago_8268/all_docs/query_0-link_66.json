        "text": "North Shores is a vibrant ocean front community in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where families and friends gather to celebrate summer and all the other seasons.\n\nThe centerpiece of the community is the Bath & Tennis Club, which provides recreation facilities for our residents and their visitors during the summer months. The facilities include a magnificent swimming pool, two tennis courts, a marina with slips for 30 boats, and our greatest asset, approximately 2,200 feet of beautiful Atlantic Ocean beach.\n\nThe beach is for the exclusive use of residents and their guests. The Bath & Tennis Club employs a certified staff to ensure a safe and healthy environment for the community.\n\nEstablished by Daniel G. Anderson and J. Rodney King, when they purchased the land in 1956 with a vision of the community that today consists of 192 single-family lots, 48 apartments and 55 townhouses. An additional 10 lots and 11 condominiums have recently been annexed or licensed into the community. The subdivision Covenants were recorded in 1966."
