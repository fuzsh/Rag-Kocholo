        "text": "North Shores is a vibrant oceanfront community in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where families and friends gather to celebrate summer and nature's gifts throughout the other seasons. Established in 1956 by Daniel G. Anderson and J. Rodney King, whose vision of the community is enjoyed today! The community consists of single-family homes, apartments and townhouses where residents and their guests may enjoy the lovely Bath & Tennis Club during the summer months. The facilities include a magnificent swimming pool, two tennis courts, a marina with slips for 25 boats, and of course, the approximately 2,200 feet of beautiful Atlantic Ocean beach. The private beach is for the exclusive use of residents and their guests. The quaint and scenic area is located north of Rehoboth Beach and is adjacent to the glorious Gordon's Pond State Park. With a expansive beach, part of which welcomes pets, you can also access the bike trail to Cape Henlopen State Park, which is in Lewes. DE. A little over 5 miles, this trail skirts the western side of Gordons Pond, a 900-acre saltwater lagoon that offers some of the most stunning views youâ€™ll find in the area. Bonus: Our President Joe Biden's vacation home is located in North Shores!"
