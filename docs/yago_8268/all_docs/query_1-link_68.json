        "text": "November 10th, 2021\n\nHenlopen City Oyster House, Restaurant, Review, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Southern Delaware, Delaware Beaches\n\nIt’s early in the morning as I sit down to write this post. Living in Rehoboth Beach gives me the opportunity to try so many good restaurants. Besides the beaches who attract so many visitors, this seaside village is a foodie’s destination. Up and down the Delaware coast chefs outdo each other all the time preparing amazing dishes with the freshest ingredients available.\n\nI have my favorite restaurants and depending on my mood I pop in usually to sit at the bar. I find that part of a restaurant the most fun.\n\nI love seafood. I thoroughly enjoy plump, cold and salty oysters and what better place to have them than at Henlopen City Oyster House located at 50 Wilmington Ave. in Downtown Rehoboth Beach. 302-260-9193.\n\nhttp://Www.hcoysterhouse.com\n\nSitting at the oyster bar we ordered these gorgeous Main oysters.\n\nThey were delicious. Our next tasting was the clam chowder, New England style with smoked bacon, potatoes and veggies. This soup is always on the menu and they have perfected it.\n\nThumbs up to the Crispy Blowfish Tails. Beer battered, with apple cider and pink peppercorn aioli and lemon.\n\nMy actual dinner consisted of the whole fish. This was a Massachusetts Haddock. This is a mild flesh fish. It was rice flour dusted, tamari braised dittmar purple top turnips, crispy ninja radishes, chesterfield heirlooms eggplant, blistered shisito peppers, and a lime soy vinaigrette.\n\nThis is definitely a full meal. But to tell you the truth it is a light one. Don’t be scared of a whole fish. In Asia a whole fish is considered to bring good luck. When eating it whole you get more meat and any meat cooked on the bone is more flavorful.\n\nI loved it. I used the fork and knife and my fingers too. So Justin Jordan who is the Chef comes out and said to me. I wished I could hire you to show the customers how to eat a whole fish. The woman next to me mentioned she did not know how to eat it until she saw what I was doing. I do the same work with crabs, lobsters and fried chicken. ?\n\nSpeaking about the young woman next to me I took a photo of her main meal. She chose the Lobster Roll. It was gigantic and her side was the Golden Raisin Sofrito Roasted Carrots.\n\nThat dinner was not enough because a friend and I made it to lunch on Friday when more oysters to the table and she had the lobster roll with fries, and I had the hamburger. Their City Burger, cooked medium rare for me had pickled sweet peppers, crispy onions, tomato bacon jam, shredded lettuce, gouda cheese on a brioche roll. Juices ran down my chin but after working on that whole fish a few days before who cares, right?\n\nPlease visit our restaurants and remember that eating is a need but enjoying it, is an art.\n\nAboutMyBeaches has its own Facebook Page and Twitter Page too.\n\nApril 7th, 2021\n\nOut & About, Rehoboth Beach, Lunch, Henlopen City Oyster House, Review, Season 2021, Delaware Beaches, Southern Delaware\n\nWhat a gorgeous Easter Weekend here in Rehoboth Beach, DE. The main roads were heavy with traffic, and I was just thinking what will it look like this summer. I will have to plan to go to the grocery store either at midnight or at the crack of dawn. Not kidding.\n\nOn Monday temperatures were warm and my sister in law, Susie, and I took off to check Downtown Rehoboth. A lot of people had left and the boardwalk was just delightful for a power walk.\n\nWhat to have for lunch? Indian, Pizza, Salad, or seafood? Our choice was Henlopen City Oyster House located on 50 Wilmington Ave. This restaurant I have posted before here or shared photos on my FB page. Fresh seafood, amazing salty oysters, and great Bloody Marys.\n\nI call it the Oyster House and it is great that they are opened year round for lunch and dinner and carry out, as well. Their website? http://www.hcoysterhouse.com\n\nAn order of smelts to share. It has been some time since I have had those. Lightly fried with a lemony sauce.\n\nNew on the menu is a King Crab Salad. Very well received by my sister in law. Having seafood and salads on this day after all our Easter delicacies.\n\nIt does not fail. I usually order one of their salads with scallops. Today they were grilled scallops. There is plenty on the menu and it is all good but this is a favorite.\n\nWhile in Rehoboth, check them out. You will not be disappointed.\n\nWant to leave a comment? Please visit my Facebook Page AboutMyBeaches and put your 2 cents in.\n\nHave a great day!!\n\nFebruary 5th, 2021\n\nHenlopen City Oyster House, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Restaurant, Review, Dine-In, Curbside PickUp, Delaware Beaches, Southern Delaware\n\nHenlopen City Oyster House is located in Downtown Rehoboth Beach, Delaware at 50 Wilmington Avenue. It is one of the few restaurants that, at this time of the year, are open for lunch and dinner. It closes on Tuesdays.\n\nWebsite? http://www.hcoysterhouse.com\n\nWe sat at the oyster bar. Perfect seating watching the guys shucking oysters. We had 3 varieties….the saltier the better in my book.\n\nYou see that glass of wine there? We asked for a suggestion of what would pair well with the oysters. It was called Barbara Ohlzelt and it is a Gruner Veltliner type of wine from Austria. It was perfection with our oysters and seafood choices.\n\nA New England Clam Chowder was ordered. It had plenty of clams, smoked bacon, potatoes and veggies. Look how good it looked.\n\nUp and down the beaches I have my favorite restaurants for a particular food. Henlopen City Oyster House is a favorite of mine for scallops. Any which way they fix them, I love them. Always perfectly cooked. So my choice last night was Seared Massachusetts Scallops with saffron migas, tangerine-meyer lemon emulsion, butternut squash, and sage and speck. Speck is a pork fat with or without some meat in it. It is sort of a type of prosciutto. My review? Excellent!!\n\nI usually rave about the grilled octopus in another local restaurant in town. So I was very excited when the Grilled Octopus was order at Henlopen City Oyster House. I tasted a little bite and it was up there with my other favorite one. Tender and very well seasoned. Braised in red wine, with bay water purple sweet potatoes, bravas sauce, crispy capers, olive oil and parsley. Both the octopus and the clam chowder were appetizers that were ordered as a main entree.\n\nEven through a Pandemic, Rehoboth Beach continues to be a foodie’s destination with our restaurants offering really good food. There is something for everyone in this town.\n\nAboutMyBeaches has a Facebook Page. Leave me a message will you?\n\nTGIF\n\nDecember 21st, 2015\n\nRehoboth Beach Eats! Henlopen City Oyster House, Restaurant, Review, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Delware Beaches\n\nBeautiful weather in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. Walking the award winning, one mile Boardwalk is a past time for visitors and residents. At this time of the year is the perfect time to take a stroll with a friend or try to work out some of the food that has been enjoyed in our award winning restaurants. Rehoboth Beach is a dining destination and only a few hours from Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia.\n\nThere you see Jody and I walking off scrapple on Sunday morning!!\n\nIt has been quite some time since I last visited Henlopen City Oyster House located at 50 Wilmington Avenue in Downtown Rehoboth Beach. Tel. 302-260-9193 Website? http://www.hcoysterhouse.com.\n\nHenlopen City Oyster House is open daily. Lunch begins at Noon, Happy Hour at the Bar begins at 3 p.m. until 5 p.m. and Dinner begins at 5 p.m. Please note that they will be closing on Thursday, December 24th and Friday, December 25th.\n\nThis restaurant is serious about oysters, so if you like them please make sure that while visiting Rehoboth Beach you make a point to stop. One of my other friends came from Bethany Beach to have a bite to eat before Christmas. Cathy had one the beers on tap and I proceeded to have a glass of champagne.\n\nAfter discussing the menu with our server, which by the way was excellent, we decided to start with some salads. The menu changes daily but there are some dishes that are always on the menu.\n\nThe Butternut Squash Salad had tuscano kale, quinoa, hazelnuts, pears, and pomegranate.\n\nI love beets so I will always order them if found on the menu. Their Roasted Beet Salad is always on the menu. Sunflower seeds, sliced pickled radish, feta cheese, and a balsamic reduction. Loved the 2 color beets!!\n\nCathy decided on the Herb Grilled Carolina Wreckfish brushed with fresh herbs, and served with her choice of Mascarpone Mashed Turnips and Broccoli. Wreckfish are from the bass family. They have a big head with a big mouth. They are found in waters ranging from 140 feet up to 3,000 feet deep. Although they are found all along the East Coast, most of the commercial fishery operates over the Charleston Bump, located 80 to 100 miles southeast of Charleston, SC. It was mild and perfectly seasoned.\n\nEven though Henlopen City Oyster House is known for oysters and seafood, they also have elk, wild boar and ribeye steak. In speaking to our server he said the Shiitake Encrusted Elk Rack was amazing. So no brainer…that’s what I had and it did not disappoint. Cooked just like it should be eaten it had an amazing taste. It was oven roasted, with miso acorn squash, chestnut wild rice, black garlic, and lemongrass cranberry. Not to be missed.\n\nA sweet ending of Key Lime Pie for Cathy and I. It was good too. Just enough tartness and not overly sweet.\n\nHave a good one….kick back and relax!!\n\nMay 4th, 2015\n\nHistoric Lewes Farmers Market, 10th Anniversary Celebration, Progressive Dinner, 3 Historic Homes, 3 Chefs, Eating Fresh & Local for 10 Years, Historic Lewes, Delaware Beaches, Opening Day, Saturday, May 9th!!\n\nThere were so many guests gathering for a special celebration, as the Historic Lewes Farmers Market celebrates its 10th year in the community. Buying directly from family farmers and vendors…getting up close and personal with them. Buying local food means it does taste better, it is fresh and therefore, more nutritious, as well. The Historic Lewes Farmers Market will be opening for Season 2015 on Saturday, May 9th, from 8 a.m. until Noon. Location? The Lewes Historical Society Complex. More info? Please visit http://www.historiclewesfarmersmarket.org\n\nOur Progressive Dinner Party in honor of HLFM started with 3 groups divided by color. Our cards indicated the order in which we would visit each home. My group had the color Green!!\n\n3 Star Chefs, 3 Historic Homes….and 10 Years of Being Fresh!! Let the party begin!! Each of these chefs prepared light fare at each house, accompanied by specially selected wines, beers, and champagne. Many of us did not know each other at the beginning of this journey…we were friends by dessert.\n\n240 Second Street is the home of Nancy Staisey and Stan Divorski. We thank them for opening their gorgeous home to all of us. The Featured Chef was Hari Cameron, who is the Executive Chef and Owner of a(MUSE.) in Downtown Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe patio of this home was beautiful and on a cool spring night in Lewes it was just wonderful.\n\nInside, Chef Hari Cameron was so busy. Hari always has time for his guests. He will stop what he is doing and give you complete attention, explaining everything that he is doing. I hope he takes this as a compliment, because it is.\n\nAs he got ready for us we proceeded to get drinks and some appetizers…meats, cheeses, and mustards.\n\nHari outdid himself with the following:\n\nHomemade ricotta cheese, Davidson’s exotic mushrooms, and spring peas.\n\nBeetroot soup, fresh goat cheese, radish, and herbs and spices. I am one of those that love beets, so, for me this was awesome! A little spicy with a lot of flavor.\n\nHousemade carrot pasta, bay scallops, dill and watercress. Have you tried any of Hari’s pastas? I have tried his pumpernickel, and now this carrot one. The flavors are just incredible.\n\nThis first round was a total success….check my plate. There was a pickled okra that was so yummy!!\n\nAfter 45 minutes the bell rang which meant we had to go to our next rotation….\n\n231 Second Street is the home of Jody Ware and Bob Hyberg. Again, we thank the homeowners for opening their home. The Featured Chef was Bill Clifton, who is the Executive Chef of the Henlopen City Oyster House in Downtown Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThis home is generally referred to as the Daniel Rodney House. He was a relation to Caesar Rodney, signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was, also, a Governor and U.S. Senator for Delaware. It is a fine example of early Lewes architecture, circa 1800. Some accounts point to the late 1700s. One link is the inference that this house may have been where the body of Camptain James Drew, Commander of HMS DeBraak, laid in state in 1798.\n\nChef Bill Clifton offered us…\n\nHenlopen City Oyster House is known for its oysters. They were the Main Event on this rotation. Chincoteague Island Oysters pack the full salt of the Atlantic. They are skinny and elongated…on ice, of course.\n\nSpringfield Farms braised lamb bacon, romaine, backyard jams, tomato jelly on brioche.\n\nThe Mediterranean Spring Rolls were very interesting…Calliope Farms fava bean hummus, cucumber, dried olives, sprouts and piri piri sauce.\n\nOnce again the bell rang and off we went to our next and final rotation.\n\n228 Second Street is the home of John Mini and Robert Perri. Many thanks for opening your home to us. The Featured Chef was Aaron Berg, Executive Chef of The Buttery.\n\nThis was our last rotation on this very special evening. My Green Group was still going strong…plenty to drink and to eat. The kitchen was getting ready for us.\n\nIn the meantime, the following is what Chef Aaron Berg had for us…\n\nChapel Creamery Cheese Board with specialty crackers and sauces.\n\nShaved asparagus and arugula salad, deviled duck eggs, pickled rasperries and lavender honey. These deviled duck eggs were awesome and my group certainly loved them The pickled rasperry was definitely a most delicious touch.\n\nBraised pork belly, sweet carrot puree, smoked cherry BBQ sauce. It was crispy, perfect addition was the carrot puree…a favorite of the evening.\n\nEnjoying drinks outdoors we did….waiting for the Cake.\n\nIt was time to cut the Historic Lewes Farmers Market Anniversary Cake. Each home had a cake. HLFM thanked all of us for making this evening such an unforgettable night.\n\nFunds from this event will help HLFM operate the market so that their local farmers and vendors can grow, support their families, and build the local food movement in Delmarva.\n\nAnd, until next time….have a good one!!\n\nOctober 10th, 2013\n\nDining, Henlopen City Oyster House, Restaurant, Review, The Second Season, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Beaches, Southern Delaware,\n\nCathy and I decided to stop for something to eat at one of the most popular restaurants in this coastal town…Henlopen City Oyster House. It is located on 50 Wilmington Avenue, Rehoboth Beach, DE 19971. Tel. 302-260-9193. Website? http://www.hcoysterhouse.com. Open for lunch and dinner…no reservations.\n\nIt was surprising to see Rehoboth Beach so crowded on a Tuesday night. Almost no parking…can you believe it? It is a thing of the past when Rehoboth Beach used to roll up its sidewalks until the following season. No way…this is a year-round resort. Very vibrant, offering its visitors and residents something to do, practically every night of the week.\n\nI love this restaurant….it never disappoints. Fresh seafood, salty oysters, beer, specialty drinks, and wine.\n\nA Fruit and Nut Salad offered sliced apple, five spice pumpkin seeds, candied walnuts, dried cherries, bleu cheese, and a while balsamic dressing. A substantial salad full of flavor.\n\nI love beets and their Roasted Beet salad contained sunflower seeds, pickled radish, feta cheese, mixed greens, drizzled with a balsamic reduction. Very good!!\n\nThe Herb Grilled Maryland Rockfish was ordered by Cathy and it was grilled and lightly brushed with an herb olive oil, served with her choide of seasonal veggies and braised kale. Seasoned to perfection!\n\nI ordered the Sesame & Spice Seared New Zealand Hapuka Seabass with spicy coconut green bamboo rice, lobster mushrooms, zipper peas, grilled long beans, and a cashew curry sauce. All those combinations gave this dish an array of flavors that were truly delicious.\n\nEven though the desserts can be tempting at Henlopen City Oyster House, we were very satisfied. Perhaps another time.\n\nTalk to you later….have a good one!!\n\nMarch 21st, 2013\n\nWelcome! Spring at the Delaware Beaches….Oh well, There is Always Happy Hour in Downtown Rehoboth Beach, Henlopen City Oyster House!!\n\nHey, it’s Spring…enjoy the weather and blame the groundhog!!\n\nMy poor flowers are so confused….to bloom or not to bloom. It’s like we are going two steps forward and one step back. What a tease this weather is!!\n\nWell, Happy Hour is starting at Henlopen City Oyster House and when all fails stop for some delicious oysters and plenty more. Location? 50 Wilmington Avenue in Downtown Rehoboth Beach. Website? http://www.hcoysterhouse.com Opens for lunch and dinner.\n\nThe Broadwater oysters from Virginia they were just right…salty!! Shelley and I are still celebrating our birthdays…so we decided to stop by. An order of the oysters, beet salad, and steamed shrimp with pickling spices hit the spot.\n\nThere is always tomorrow…Sun? Maybe…talk to you later.\n\nNovember 18th, 2012\n\nDining, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Henlopen City Oyster House, Restaurant, Raw Bar, Seafood, Review, Delaware Beaches\n\n“We like to keep a constant rotation of beverages and fresh food on hand, that’s why we update our menu daily.” henlopen city oyster house\n\nWith that in mind, my friend, Debbie, and I decided on this restaurant for lunch. She had asked me to choose…believe it or not, I had never been. I must be the only one in Rehoboth Beach who has not. Henlopen City Oyster House is located at 50 Wilmington Avenue in Downtown Rehoboth Beach. Tel. 302-260-9193. Website? http://www.hcoysterhouse.com. It opens at Noon for lunch and for dinner, as well. No reservations.\n\nAs you entered the restaurant, to the left was the bar. Already the Sunday football fans were taking their places. The bar was crowded and the oyster bar was busy.\n\nIt is an oyster house, therefore, a wide variety of oysters are available. Please check their selections. Have in mind that they get updated all the time. http://www.hcoysterhouse.com/specialy.html.\n\nWe were surprised to see friends from Ocean City. They had plates full of oysters.\n\nWe chose to sit in their dining room. It was comfortable with large windows, and the perfect spot to catch up.\n\nThe lunch and dinner menu looked great. Fresh seafood and local foods, supporting the local farmers is something this restaurant takes seriously.\n\nThe question to my server was…If you have never eaten here, what would be the dish that would really hook you? There was no hesitation on her part when she answered…New England Lobster Roll or the Lobster Reuben. She said they were delicious.\n\nFor me that did it. An order of their Lobster Reuben. Lobster salad, cole slaw, thousand island dressing, gruyere, grilled rye, served with a choice of side. I decided on the side salad since this sandwich was going to be big. When it was placed in front of me, it looked great. The bread nice and thick….the first bite had my taste buds dancing. I was hoping I did not have to share.\n\nDebbie went all out, by ordering their Classic Oyster Stew. It was made in a traditional Eastern Shore classic way with cream, oyster liquor, Worcestershire Sauce, Tabasco, and Old Bay. It was a little thicker than the one I just had last week in Philadelphia. Great flavor and consistency.\n\nShe decided on the Henlopen City Po’Boy Sandwich. Debbie chose the Po’Boy made with a combination of scallops and shrimp. This sandwich was huge, with Creole mustard marinated cabbage, pickled red onions, soft roll. Her side was the Mac & Cheese, which was creamy, well seasoned with a hint of nutmeg.\n\nNo dessert was necessary….a walk around Downtown Rehoboth Beach is what we needed.\n\nWe really enjoyed it….great to get together with good friends…Priceless!! Talk to you later."
