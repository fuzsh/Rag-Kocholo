        "text": "A Four Corners investigation has identified a man suspected of being behind hundreds of kilos of methamphetamine hitting Australia's shores.\n\nAustralian man Daniel Rodney Badger is being named for the first time as part of the months-long investigation into crystal meth, or \"ice\".\n\nThe 38-year-old listed a Western Sydney housing commission property as his address in 2016 and may currently be living in Vietnam or Cambodia.\n\nA video posted online in 2019 shows his lavish wedding in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nIn 2022, it's believed he obtained Cambodian citizenship and got a new Khmer name – Sovannarith Sen.\n\nFour Corners understands Mr Badger is now on the Australian Federal Police's \"high-value target\" list.\n\nThe list names fewer than 100 people who police allege are having a significant impact on criminal activity in Australia – including major drug importers.\n\nAFP deputy commissioner Ian McCartney told Four Corners, \"Daniel Rodney Badger is of significant interest to the AFP\".\n\nFour Corners made attempts to contact Mr Badger and send him a list of detailed questions. It did not receive a response.\n\nAs part of its broader investigation, Four Corners has spoken with current and former meth dealers, cooks, enforcers and runners with knowledge of the South-East Asian supply chain.\n\n\"Over 70 per cent of our major targets that are organising drug importations into Australia actually reside offshore,\" deputy commissioner McCartney said.\n\nHousing commission to suspected meth importer\n\nMr Badger listed a humble housing commission home in Western Sydney as his address in 2016.\n\nA year later he became a major shareholder in a multi-million Vietnamese export company.\n\nThe company says it exports fertilisers to Australia and it has an extensive logistics network, including bonded warehouses – a place where goods can be stored.\n\nFour Corners does not suggest that the company has any involvement with an illegal drug trade.\n\nPhotos posted on social media in 2017 show Mr Badger sporting new tattoos.\n\nMr Badger sold his holdings in the fertiliser company in 2018.\n\nIn 2020, he opened a car wholesale business in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nMr Badger's parents still live in Western Sydney. They told Four Corners they hadn't seen him for a few years.\n\nAsked about his son's alleged involvement in the meth trade, his father said: \"I didn't know … and I would be quite ashamed if he is.\"\n\nMajor meth market\n\nAustralia is one of the most lucrative meth markets in the world.\n\nAround 10 and a half tonnes of meth – mostly ice – was consumed in Australia in the year to August 2023, a 17 per cent increase on the year before. It was more than double the amount of cocaine consumed in the same period.\n\nAustralians spent an estimated $10 billion on meth in that time, despite its devastating consequences.\n\nIce is a highly addictive stimulant linked to chronic physical and mental health problems.\n\n\"I think this concept of party drugs is completely incorrect,\" deputy commissioner McCartney said.\n\n\"These drugs have such a disastrous impact on the Australian community.\"\n\nStopping major players in South-East Asia won't necessarily stop the supply coming into Australia.\n\nWhile governments in the West have been fighting the flood of drugs from the region for decades, the frontline has now shifted to meth coming in from North America.\n\nDeputy commissioner McCartney said the AFP is working with its international partners on a two-pronged strategy to both seize illegal drugs destined for Australia, and effect the arrest and prosecution of those behind the organisation of their importation.\n\n\"The AFP needs to tackle crime at its source,\" he said.\n\n\"We have pictures of all of the high-value targets on the wall, and we're just working through them one by one and ticking them off.\n\n\"We know where these people are. We know what countries they're in. We know where they live … where they frequent, and we are coming after them.\"\n\nThe Cambodian government did not respond to questions about Mr Badger.\n\nWatch the Four Corners documentary, 'Meth Highway', tonight from 8.30pm on ABC TV and ABC iview.\n\nSubscribe to the Four Corners newsletter and follow Four Corners on Facebook.\n\nDo you know more about this story?
