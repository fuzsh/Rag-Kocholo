The Ori or Trust was taking over Earth slowly. Jennifer goes back to Earth and Rodney realizes he's been in love with John more then her and dumps her. Jack, Daniel, John and Rodney with a few others and the president slowly start making a plan to help Earth by putting supplies and other things off world in case of needing to leave. And then they start getting people off Earth mainly family of SGC. John goes to get his brother and his two daughters and the mother shoots John and something is taking over him, they learn they have to use the ascension to save him Rodney, Radek and someone else was in the room getting John ready. Also learned that someone was still alive out their helping the enemy and was in John's mind telling him they almost have him and Daniel. Daniel was also at SGC I think in the gateroom surrounded by Marines that where already taken over. Jack was also with the president and Cadwell. That's where I had left off when I thought it saved. I'm racking my brain trying to find it, any help would be great. It was on AO3. I'm still searching on their but no luck.\n\nComing Around Again by toasterpop (auntbijou) mific.dreamwidth.org found it for me! Thank you so much! :)"
