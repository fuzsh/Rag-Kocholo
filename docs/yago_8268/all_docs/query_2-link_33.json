        "text": "Sean grew up working on the farm as an All-State wrestler at Caesar Rodney High School in Camden, DE and started his “Best-of-Delaware” award-winning culinary career at Dogfish Head Brewery & Eats on Rehoboth Avenue. After attending culinary school at CIA in New York City earning his stripes as the “pasta guy” under world-renowned chef Daniel Boulud at Michelin Star restaurant, Daniel, Sean moved back to the beach and continued to refine his skills as chef at restaurants like Espuma, Nage and Fork + Flask.\n\nTom grew up down Old Landing Rd. in Rehoboth and began his career in hospitality cooking cheesesteaks at the Peddler’s Village General Store in Lewes at the age of 15. He waited tables while studying and playing football at McDaniel College in Westminster, MD, where he eventually graduated with a BA in Sociology and Communication in 2011. After moving back to the beach, he assisted in opening several different restaurants from Delaware to South Carolina, and as La Vida Hospitality’s first marketing employee, helped lead development efforts for a variety of regionally recognized brands.\n\nTim began his hospitality career during summers at the beach as a dishwasher at the Avenue Restaurant in Rehoboth Beach during its heyday. He was one of the founders of Eatwell Enterprises, the genesis of the chef-driven Charlie Palmer Collective where Tim served for 22 years in a senior operations leadership role as well as overseeing the enterprise’s business affairs as its general counsel. Tim grew up in Dover, Delaware and is a graduate of Salesianum School, Villanova University, and Fordham School of Law."
