        "text": "If you haven’t yet attended a First Friday event at the Lewes Historical Society, you may want to mark your calendar for the next one, set for March 3. Each month, historic interpreters in period attire operate the Sussex Tavern from 4 until 7 p.m. The space inside the Rabbits Ferry House on the LHS campus has been transformed to resemble a Colonial-era tavern with a cage bar in the corner, and mismatched tables and chairs, all illuminated by candlelight.\n\nWeather permitting, fire tenders keep the embers aflame near the outdoor bar, while musicians enliven the atmosphere inside. When you review the menu, some of the drink names may not be familiar to today’s ears, as the list features typical cocktails from the period. How do we know? One of the items in the LHS Archives is a late 18th century ledger maintained by tavern-keeper Simon Marriner.\n\nIn it, you will see familiar Lewes names such as David Hazzard, Jonathan Gordon, Stephen Warrington and Daniel Rodney. African Americans frequented the tavern as well, including Jacob Learmouth, Charles Dingee, Mingo Jacobs and Jack Maull. All of these men drank grog, milk toddy, slings, porter and wine. And, the ledger shows them paying with corn, salt, shoes, wood, potatoes, and articles of clothing.\n\nTo keep the operation of Sussex Tavern consistent with what was known about the drinking habits of the period, historical interpreters at LHS developed recipes for the various libations on offer, beginning with the most popular – grog. This is not unlike what seamen would have drunk while aboard their ships: a mixture of rum, sugar and lime juice (to help prevent scurvy).\n\nThe bittered sling combines whiskey, lemon juice, sugar, bitters and a dash of grated nutmeg, so perhaps it’s the ancestor of the current-day old fashioned. Another cocktail served at the Sussex Tavern is called sangaree. This tastes a bit like sangria, but is a bit more potent, made with Madeira or Port, brandy and orange liqueur. A rattleskull adds a bottle of porter to two fingers of rum and is best consumed in moderation.\n\nMary Rockett’s milk punch is the cocktail that generates the most questions and takes the most time to prepare, starting a few days in advance of the tavern opening. With origins in Great Britain, milk punch was very popular here during the 18th century. And, although milk is one of the ingredients, the cocktail is neither milky in flavor nor cloudy in appearance.\n\nThe key feature of milk punch is the clarifying step. Once you add milk to the mixture of citrus-infused brandy and fruit juice, you can watch the casein (milk protein) coagulate, forming a raft of curds. Once these are strained, the remaining liquid will be crystal clear with a hint of amber color and a rich flavor, similar to the body you’ll find in a wine that has aged for a long while.\n\nWith all the pouring and imbibing of alcoholic drinks on First Fridays, you will be reassured to know the requirements LHS has imposed on those working at the tavern. In addition to wearing correct period attire (not a costume, but hand-sewn pieces in the styles and fabrics worn at the time) everyone has to complete training and testing to earn ServSafe bartender certification.\n\nIf First Friday does’t fit your schedule, LHS offers private Tavern Nights by reservation to groups of at least 25 people. Several local homeowners associations have already enjoyed happy hour at the Sussex Tavern. And, if you’d like to try creating Colonial cocktails at home, I’ve included recipes here, all adapted from the Sussex Tavern.\n\nGrog\n\n2 oz rum\n\n1/2 oz lime juice\n\n1 t sugar\n\ntwist of lime\n\nCombine rum, lime juice and sugar in a cocktail shaker with ice.
