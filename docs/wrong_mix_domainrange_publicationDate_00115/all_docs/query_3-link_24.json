        "text": "Bonjour √† tous! üíï Hi everyone! Welcome back to the French Made Easy podcast! This is episode number 23, num√©ro vingt-trois! Thanks for tuning in today. In this episode, you'll learn how to conjugate the French verb \"aller\" (to go) in the present tense! We'll first talk about the two different types of French verbs, then we'll dive straight into the conjugation of \"aller,\" and then we'll see some examples.\n\nBefore we get started, please make sure you have your cheat sheet in front of you, so you can see how to words are written. Or, at least, check out the transcript! At the end of the episode, make sure you download your exercises, so you can put pen to paper and practice what you've learned.\n\nVous √™tes pr√™ts? Are you ready? On y va.\n\nSo, there are two types of verbs in French: regular verbs and irregular verbs.\n\nThe regular verbs are regular because they follow the same pattern when they're conjugated. On the contrary, irregular verbs follow a different pattern when they're conjugated; that's why they are called irregular.\n\nSo, we've seen two irregular verbs already in our lessons. We've learned \"√™tre\" (to be) and \"avoir\" (to have.) If you want to know more about these verbs, check out episodes 15 (here) and 16 (here.)\n\nAlright, \"aller\" (to go) is another irregular verb. It's often mistaken for a regular verb, because of its ending, but it's not! It's very irregular. And it's also a super common verb.\n\nSo there's not much you can do but to learn this one by heart, \"par coeur.\"\n\nCONJUGATION\n\nSo let's see the present tense of \"aller\" (to go):\n\nR√©p√©tez apr√®s moi, repeat after me.\n\nje vais (I go or I'm going, same thing)\n\ntu vas (you go, or you're going, singular)\n\nil va (he goes)\n\nelle va (she goes)\n\non va (we go, informal)\n\nnous allons (we go)\n\nvous allez (you go, plural)\n\nils vont (they go, masculine)\n\nelles vont (they go, feminine)\n\nQuick pronunciation note, make sure you use the \"liaison\" properly in the plural forms.\n\n‚Üí It's \"nous allons\" not \"nous allons.\" You've got to link the two words together with the \"z\" sound.\n\n‚Üí It's also \"vous allez\" not \"vous allez.\" Same here, you link the two words together with the \"z\" sound.\n\nNow, if you're not too sure what the liaison is, you have to check out my course, French Pronunciation Kickstarter, where I teach you all the basic French pronunciation rules you need to know, without the extra complicated fluff.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nOK parfait. Now let's see some examples of the French verb \"aller\" conjugated in the present tense.\n\nR√©p√©tez apr√®s moi, repeat after me.\n\nJe vais au supermarch√©. (I go, or I'm going, same thing, to the supermarket.)\n\nTu vas √† la plage ? (Are you going to the beach?) üèñ\n\nIl va √† la biblioth√®que. (He's going to the library.) üìö\n\nElle va √† la piscine. (She's going to the pool.) üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nOn va au restaurant. (We're going to the restaurant.)\n\nNous allons au parc. (We're going to the park.)\n\nVous allez o√π ? (Where are you going?)\n\nIls vont au cin√©ma. (They're going to the movies.) üçø\n\nElles vont √† l'√©cole. (They're going to school.)"
