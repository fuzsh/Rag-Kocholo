My First Day In America Research Paper Everyone has to experience an important stage, which create significant changes in his life. I am not an exception. When I am 16 years old, I made one of the most important decision of my life, when I decided to take part in an exchange program and live far away from my family for nearly a year. Although the program have not finished yet, I had a lot of memorable moments in America, and the first day at my school is one of them. The first day at American High school is the first time in many years, I experience such exciting feeling. My host mother took me to the school, right then, a strange feeling and many appeared in my head. This mixture of excitement and nervous would be the most memorable feeling that I have never experience since I ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... I knew it was not the time to think about my feeling or my memory. I come here to experience, that s why I have to face it. I spent months to get used to life in America when I am at home, including studying environment, but I could not predict that I have to face a lot of changes like this. I was shocked for hours. I had to move between classes, and had to study many subjects that I have never study before, or even know its existence. I could not listen to all of my teacher s instruction, and I did not understand some of them at all. Language barrier was still an obstacle for me to conquer the subjects. However, that was all difficulties that I have faced. Beside, there are a lot of interesting things that I can explore at my school. School cafeteria offer a wide variety of not only delicious but also nutritious food. I could also sit with my new friends and chat with them for half an hour. More interestingly, I found a bottle of spicy ketchup at my first lunch, made by a Vietnamese company. It was also my favourite sauce, so I felt really exciting to taste my country s flavour while studying abroad. Lunch time has always been a great time until now and I hope my time in the cafeteria each day could be longer. The beautiful smell and taste of food of my first lunch at CCA were so wonderful that in the next days, they are the only things in my mind at the first four hours. However, it is not the most interesting time of the first day. For the first time in my life, I can play a real soccer match, and that drove me crazy. Although the cold air in Michigan almost made my lung freeze everytime I breathe, I had a lot of fun with a good game with my nice teammates, and we have been good friends since ...

The Salomon principle dictates that if the company is established in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, it starts to operate as a separate legal entity. The corporate veil becomes the dividing line between this entity and its shareholders. However, it soon became obvious that this concept can be easily abused, therefore Courts fought hard in order to establish exceptions to the Salomon principle in the form of lifting or piercing the veil, allowing them to look behind the curtain if they spot some irregularity. In order to justify these drastic measures, Courts would look for something substantive, such as an agency relationship, fraud, avoidance of obligations, or group piercing grounds. In order to determine ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... As described by Professor Gower, once the company is registered, the corporate veil comes down between the existing company and the shareholders, protecting them from any potential liability. Soon it became apparent that the companies could be easily abused and used for improper purposes. As a response to these developments, Court would use the concepts of lifting and piercing of the veil in order to go behind the veil and attach an appropriate liability to those who were behind it. Lifting of the veil was seen as the least drastic option, as the Court would look behind to see if there is some impropriety, and put the veil down, still recognising the company as a separate legal entity. Whereas piercing would involve tearing up the veil, completely disregarding company as a separate entity and looking at it as an agent for another. The process is very ad hoc, and therefore based on the discretion of the Courts. In order to persuade the Court to look behind the corporate veil, the grounds must be substantive. One of the established exceptions justified by the Court in order to lift the veil is when the evidence shows that the company is being used as a device for avoidance of existing obligations. The good examples of this exception would be the cases of Guildford Motors v Home and Jones v Lipman. In Jones v Lipman Russell J ordered specific performance ...

Some examples would be overjet, overbite, open bite, cross bite, and under bite. It has been found that these occlusal discrepancies may play a role in the progression of periodontal diseases. Some research has been done on the relationship of these two aspects but it is very controversial and more research needs to be performed before a definite answer can be provided. Many researchers have studied where or not occlusion has a connection with progression of periodontal disease but it has been very controversial. Some researchers have stated that they have found evidence that occlusal discrepancies cause progression of periodontal disease and others say that ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Some studies have been conducted but the World Workshop on Periodontics stated that controlled clinical trials that evaluated the role that occlusion had on the progression of periodontal disease in humans, was unethical. To avoid unethical situations, patient records from a private practice facility were collected and studied to see if there was a connection between occlusal discrepancies and the progression of periodontal disease. The records that were studied were from patients that had periodontal evaluations as well as occlusal assessments. All of the patients studied had periodontal disease but only some of them had occlusal decencies. After a twelve month period some patients returned and had another periodontal evaluation and occlusal assessment and the data was compared to the data that was collected twelve months prior. The data collected was compared. Patients without occlusal discrepancies and patients with occlusal discrepancies both had worsening periodontal disease after twelve months of no treatment but, the progression of periodontal disease and increased pocket probing depths ...

The parents said that her preschool teacher had a hard time understanding her in class and suggested to take her to a speech pathologist. Lauren spoken language is English and there were no prior medical issues. Therefore, I decided to give Lauren the Goldman Fristoe to see what phonemes she struggled with. Since Lauren is 4 years, 10 months and 17 days old, I gave her the sounds in words section then sounds in sentences section for ages 4:0 6:11.

I felt I did a decent job at giving the Goldman Fristoe to Lauren. I read the directions and tried to make taking the test fun. I used the directions whenever Lauren did not say the word I wanted to hear and did not talk monotone. I From the view of a client, I felt taking the Golden Fristoe was difficult. It was difficult to mispronounce phonemes within words. Though I practiced mispronouncing my phonemes, when I came to taking the test, I still struggled mispronouncing them. It was easier to mispronounce phonemes in words rather than in sentences. I also found it hard to mispronounce phonemes during the stimulability section of the test. I felt one thing I could have done to make the test giving process better is being more fluent when giving the test. One thing I could have done to make taking the test easier is mastering my incorrect phonemes. While I was taking the test, I was trying to fronting and stopping.

Canada, which is the headquarters of Barrick Gold Corporation, runs 60 percent of the world s mining corporations across the globe. Notwithstanding the fact that even though it is the forerunner in this industry, Canada has not taken the lead on mediating or taking responsibility for the behavior of their corporations abroad. The consequence of this carelessness is, Canada has drawn criticisms from around the world, first from the environmental, religious and human rights organizations, and now increasingly from international institutions, such as the United Nations. 1.

Subsequently, the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman of the World Bank issued a report refuting LEAT s claims of mass murder and the number of people displaced, based on evidence supplied by the Tanzanian government and Barrick Gold challenged this evidence. Similarly, Barrick s North Mara mine suffered great human rights abuses under its predecessor, Canada s Placer Dome. Lissu, who has been jailed for anti mining activism, claims that Bar rick s security operatives at the North Mara mine have since been linked to six violent deaths and that the killings are part of a strategy to silence mine critics. Most of the conflict arises over whether the local tradition of alluvial mining became illegal under arrangements and contracts held by the Porgera gold mine. ATA claimed that no Ipili agreed to give up traditional rights. The company has hired a 400 men security team, which it calls Asset Protection Department, to guard the facility. Over the years, what started as a congenial arrangement has turned into small scale armed conflict that has caused hundreds of injuries, sometimes 40 to 50 a day, according to ...

The Treatment Of Discrimination In Richard Wright s Native... In the United States, there is an immeasurable amount of hate. Ever since our ancestors came here from England, we search only for differences in each other. These differences can be anything from the color of one s skin, religion, sex, or expression of his or her gender, even political beliefs. Consequently, generally one will treat another differently due to characteristics that they have lack control over. As a human being, one can only tolerate this treatment for so long, and the subject will eventually retaliate. Yet, when an individual does retaliate due to poor treatment, no one asks why they did so. Several characters from Native Son experience this mistreatment which people are still experiencing today. In Richard Wright s novel Native Son, the characters are treated unjustly. Due to his skin color and socioeconomic status, Bigger Thomas misses countless opportunities in life. Almost every minority during this era is born with some disadvantages, identical to Bigger s.

Waterfall Methodology Essay Choosing a proper method for software design is completely depended upon the requirements and end products of the company. These requirements and goals might change in the process of development of software depending upon the decisions of stakeholders, developers and system analysts. Waterfall life cycle model and Agile methodology are the methods to implement and develop software. The initial methodology used by company is Waterfall methodology consists of sequential steps for the designing of software. One can predict cost, duration and requirements of the project in this method. This method is primarily used when organization knows what the end product of the project is. Proper planning is required before the start of the project. But there are some disadvantages of waterfall methodology. One major disadvantage is that developers cannot go back to the previous step once they have completed the step. If the project requirements are not satisfied initially then there might be a chance of project failure. It might also cost budget issues as well as more duration to complete the project. If developers want to make certain changes in the code of project in between then they again need to start from the beginning to write the code. To overcome these disadvantages of waterfall model, Agile methodology is designed. This methodology uses incremental approach unlike waterfall model which uses sequential steps to develop software.

Comparing Voice In Poetry And Psalms 6 Voice is a main force that drives along a piece of literature, it adapts to new paths and takes on new meanings based on the speaker, addressee, context, and many other factors. In If You Want to Sing from Islamic Mystical Poetry and Psalms 6, through similar basic structures, both writings deploy voice in order to describe suffering and affirmation of each respective speaker s position. However, through this fundamental parallel, the differences in the particularities of the voices employed are further highlighted. The similarity in the general voice and structure allow for higher scrutiny of the individual texts, accentuating the particular differences in emotionality and clarity that the respective voices carry. Though seemingly different on first look, the two writings follow a similar pattern and basic plot. In both, there is an encouragement ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... In terms of voice, generally, both deploy a very declarative voice, announcing their struggles and sufferings. Towards the end, however, both move to a more affirmative voice that sustain their stable positions in triumphing against their enemies. Through this similar scheme and movement though different voices, a greater window is created to inspect more meticulously at the detailed differences between the two works in terms of voice. Although they both do deploy a declarative voice in the beginning, there are nuances that give the writings a different meaning and light. Specifically, Psalms 6 brings more emotionality to the way suffering is described. For example, Psalms 6 spends verse two, three, six, and seven just describing in detail how much anguish is felt. In verse six, crying is illustrated through two different ways, flooding the bed and drenching the couch, which constructs a tangible picture in the readers minds.

Telomerase is an enzyme that aids in the lengthening of telomeres through replenishing TTAGGG ribonucleic repeats that do not code for particular amino acids and is present in high amounts exclusively in cells such as gametes or stem cells. These repeats then undergo chromosomal shortening rather than the necessary ribonucleic acid sequences of DNA. (Yuanjun et al., 2014). Telomerase itself is a highly intricate enzyme that is capable of interacting with accessory proteins, RNA templates, and the ribonucleoprotein complex of a catalytic human reverse transcriptase. The human telomerase gene commonly referred to as hTERT is responsible for activating telomerase and is further regulated by transcription factors. Copious studies have revealed that aging and other growth crises such as cancer is telomere length dependent and may be avoided through the increased expression of the hTERT gene, telomerase activity, and stabilization of telomere length. (Degerman et al., 2011). Aging is additionally avoided in cells through the negation of ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n20. Essay On Colombia What does Colombia s Flag Mean?

Examples Of Split Infinitives Of the three verb classes, infinitives might be the easiest to understand, as it is the basic form of the verb, without an infection binding it to a particular subject or tense (Oxford Dictionaries).

Anne Curzan states that one of the largest myths about standard English is that it always makes sense. She uses split infinitives as an example for this myth, as there is no clear explanation for where the rule came from. However, despite some speakers proclamations against split infinitives, Curzan (and Pullum in his previously mentioned article) state that split infinitives clear more ambiguity than they add to a sentence. Examine the sentence: Tell her to please be careful . If a writer rewrites the sentences to unsplit the infinitive, it changes what exactly please modifies. For example, Please tell her to be careful , please now references the listener rather than the her in question. If please is moved to follow careful , like Tell her to be careful please it becomes ambiguous if the speaker is asking the listener please or still referring to the other person.

In this article, Wong takes an atypical side to the tradition self help style of writing. He approaches the genre with an aggressive, volatile, angry tone to motivate those who find themselves unmotivated. Wong divides his audience into two distinct groups. He uses a scene from the famous 1992 movie Glengarry Glen Ross to his aid. This particular scene is the Alec Baldwin, If you want to work here, CLOSE! speech that received massive critical praise. Wong uses this scene to parallel the audience to those who worked under Alec Baldwin. Wong directly then divides the audience into those who get things done in the face of adversity, and those who fail to even step up to challenge. After making this distinction, Wong then targets those who fail to step up to the challenge, and proceeds to portray his ideas on how to improve one s dire situation. However, what Wong doesn t fully understand is that through this article, he truly alienates the group that he is trying to assist in the first place.

Importance Of Meditation And The Kind Of Mindset Yoda Basing one s understanding of meditation from the terms mentioned above, one can see the resemblance and connection between meditation and the kind of mindset Yoda asks Luke Skywalker to emulate. In Star Wars, concentration is essential to the life of a Jedi Knight, because through its practice, a Jedi is able to let the force flow through them, to guide his actions, instead of suffering and failing from clinging to the notion of control. Buddhist Meditation allows for one to be fully present, to take in everything that the present moment has to offer, instead of clinging to the past that is long gone, and the future that has yet to come. Correspondingly, Jedi Knights are asked to focus on the present because every emotion that disrupts their mission to protect the galaxies, lies in clinging to emotions that surround the past and the future. To further understand the concept of being fully present, according to author Matthew Bortolin: We become caught in the memories of our past mistakes and lost in fantasies about future triumphs, and in so doing we lose the joy available in the present. In the time of the Buddha his disciples were known to be exceptionally joyful and even radiant. It was a striking sight: simple monks, residing in the wilderness and eating very little, yet so luminous and serene. When asked how this came to be, the Buddha said, They do not repent the past, nor do they brood for the future. They live in the present. Therefore they are radiant. By ...
