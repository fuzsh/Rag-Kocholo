Conventions differ over time and place (although with globalisation they are now as likley to converge as they are to diverge), and between one publisher or institution’s in-house style-guide rules and those of another be the spacial distance confined to the same central London post code. This guide differs from most others in that it cites many examples of bad practice and sets out to explain why they are wrong and how they can be corrected. Instances of such malpractice do change a little every year but they do, oddly, have their fashions.\n\nNo one who takes language seriously can want to impose a procrustean idea of ‘right language’. Language grows and changes, but it does have to make sense. Thus this list is simply a reasoned check-list of good practice. Ideas about good style differ with age and clime but refer to this article written by Joseph Addison in The Spectator (1712 [№ 476]) and ask yourself, is the perspective voiced still of contemporary relevance today? (I’d say so!) Fixing simple errors, such as the now common failure to know when to use a comma and when to use a full stop, is relatively simple alas, improving a style is an altogether much harder endevour.\n\nWhy do we have conventions?\n\nOne can think of language by analogy with other human processes: when driving a car, if the visible traffic signs and invisible conventions of the highway code are well understood by everyone, vehicles can execute complex manoeuvres at high speed with minimal risk of accidents. If one person fails to spot one sign or fails to observe one invisible rule, a crash can result. Similarly in dance, elegance and emotional impact depend on each performer doing just what he or she is supposed to do at exactly the right time and place. Where language is concerned, bruises or bodily death is only rarely the consequence of failure, but there are documented instances of how language misunderstood in a courtroom has led the innocent to the scaffold. More generally, the life and death of sense, and the chance of grace, are companions in every utterance. If the writer makes skilful use of the agreed conventions, complex sense can flow rapidly and smoothly between people; if not, then chaos can result. As Robert Lowell once remarked, a comma can be intelligent, or stupid. Scholarly writing as a genre\n\nScholarly writing must make exact sense (even when being deliberately ambiguous); it is highly articulate, a matter of joints. One thought hinges on another, and a good hinge lets you hang a door, kick a ball or hammer a nail. Articulate sentences help us make the world. No literary critic, historian or philosopher would question this for a moment. It follows that it is the task of all teachers and students to accept the challenge of being as articulate as they possibly can and that even the apparently modest comma has a crucial role to play in this process. Grammar and Glamour\n\nAn amusement: the origin of the word ‘glamour’ is a Scottish variant on the word ‘grammar’, grammar having been associated in days of yore with the power to cast magic spells, just the sort of thing that learned persons were expected to be able to do. It follows that grammar is literally glamorous! Professionalism\n\nThe recent spread of word-processing has radically altered the production of writing in all social contexts. Students, scholars and businessmen used to write in manuscript; their typing was done by secretaries. Now everyone uses keyboards and even businessmen type their own reports on laptops and send them direct to the boardroom. It follows that students now have to be much more exacting in their own use of English and their understanding of such matters as layout and proper punctuation. Good writing was always essential but it is now canonised and commodified as a ‘transferable skill’. Particular Problems for English and History Majors\n\nScholars and students who read works written in other times learn that conventons [sic] of spelling and punctuation change across time; those used in The Spectator essay attached above would invite correction if used to day. By the same token, if students do not understand their own conventions, they will not be able to explore the nature of historical differences. They will not be properly equipped for reading the past. It follows that a secure understanding of such issues is required.\n\nChapter 1. Punctuation\n\nPunctuation marks cut the flow of words into meaningful groups and prevent confusion. There is no punctuation in speech: we use pauses to indicate grammatical units and intonation and facial expression to give emphasis. We use punctuation when writing because we lack these phonetic and visual means of indicating how our the flow of sound is to be parsed; indeed punctuation was invented 2500 years ago when Greek dramatists thought it best to guide actors where to pause, where to stop, when to exclaim, and so on. The words “comma” and “colon” date back to this time.\n\nPunctuation is today used quite tightly to mark out grammatical segments. Full stops or periods, for example, mark the end of sentences; commas mark complete clauses or phrases within sentences. These are the basic markers. Natural language functions just like software application code in which conventional markers tell a processor that a particular operation is beginning or ending. If a marker is in the wrong place, the software application will crash. The same applies to natural language punctuation. Good punctuation enables sophisticated processing; bad punctuation causes crashes and the reader is left scrabbling for sense. Here is a simple example from an essay on Jane Eyre:\n\nAt Lowood Jane encounters the positive mother, Miss Temple. After Miss Temple leaves Jane takes herself to Thornfield.\n\nThe reader stumbles after the second Jane, thinking first that the sentence means after Miss Temple leaves Jane then realising that the word Jane opens what is in fact the main clause of the sentence. After Miss Temple leaves is in fact a phrase establishing an implied condition on the main verb leaves. If the sentence is clearly punctuated the reader gets the sense the first time around:\n\nAfter Miss Temple leaves, Jane takes herself to\n\nThornfield.\n\nAnd here’s another witty example. Compare:\n\nThe panda eats shoots and leaves.\n\nThe panda eats, shoots and leaves.\n\nThe first sentence might be from a zoology book; the second is a\n\nlinguist’s invention, but it might be from the script from an\n\nanimated film. The fact that the two sentences mean very\n\ndifferent things indicates that punctuation is not just there as\n\na guide to how a phrase should sound; it is also semantic — it\n\ncarries meaning.\n\n1.1 Basic Essentials\n\nStrictly when you have a new main subject and a new main verb,\n\nyou have an independent clause which should stand as a new\n\nsentence or be joined to another clause by a conjunction or a\n\nrelative pronoun, or they should be joined by a period or a\n\nsemi-colon (or occasionally a colon — for which see para 1.3\n\nbelow).\n\nFor example, the following are correct:\n\nMarjorie went out. Her car was parked outside.\n\nPeter screamed and shouted but John didn’t care.\n\nIt began to rain so the team decided to take tea.\n\nDo not use commas to form this kind of conjunction. Here is an\n\nexample of a common error:\n\nMarjorie went out, her car was parked outside\n\nBy many teachers this is called a ‘run-on’ or a\n\n‘comma-splice’ because there are two sentences\n\nrun together: the comma should be a period because a new\n\ngrammatical subject is introduced by the car. This error\n\nis very common. You could say\n\nMarjorie went out; her car was parked outside\n\nThe semi-colon warns the reader to expect an independent clause.\n\nBetter perhaps to write\n\nMarjorie went out to her car which was parked outside.\n\nWhen you say Marjorie went out to her car, you turn the\n\ncar from a subject of the verb was to an\n\nindirect object of the phrasal verb out to. Marjorie’s\n\ncar was parked outside now becomes part of a ‘relative clause’\n\nintroduced by the ‘relative pronoun’ which. The objects\n\nand actions in the world do not change, but their grammatical\n\nrelations in language do change.\n\nWriting strings of clauses that are not properly coordinated by\n\npunctuation or grammar is a common fault in students’ essays.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nOthello desires Desdemona for her companionship, one could\n\nunderstand the speech as professing his impotence.\n\nHeathcliff’s dismissal of Isabella extends to his own child,\n\nLinton is Heathcliff’s only blood relation.\n\nThe character of Heathcliff is a constant presence throughout\n\nthe novel, his influence persists through Catherine in his\n\nabsence.\n\nIn these cases the comma should be a full stop or semi-colon. The\n\nsentences are comprehensible but not as articulate as they could\n\nbe. In the following sentence, there are actually three sentences\n\nthrown together, the subject of the first being voices,\n\nthe subject of the second being we, the subject of the\n\nthird being there (a kind of placeholder for a subject).\n\nThe voices within the novel give the reader a sense of\n\nunderlying sadness, we never feel a sense of euphoria, even in\n\nthe happiest moments there is the undertone of melancholy.\n\nSome novels of this century include paratactic strings of this\n\nkind, such as John went out of the house, he saw a car parked\n\nacross the road, he picked the lock and drove away. Using\n\ncommas where there ought to be periods gives a sense of moving\n\nfast from event to event or thought to thought – almost like\n\nspeaking – but the only logic of such a string is that of\n\nsequence: one thing after another. Formal academic prose, on the\n\nother hand, needs analytic subtlety, the ability to communicate\n\ncomplex logical relations and therefore more hypotaxis (more\n\nfrequent use of subordination and relative clauses). It must\n\ntherefore have more exact control over its co-ordination.\n\nThe above examples are at least still comprehensible because the\n\nconceptual subject remains roughly the same whilst the\n\ngrammatical subjects change. However this way of writing tends to\n\nlead to more serious faults where sense fails entirely. For\n\nexample\n\nWith new advances in medicine, invalidism cornered the social\n\nmarket, coupled with the boom of the leisure industry, the cult\n\nof invalidism prevailed throughout the nobility of late\n\neighteenth-century society.\n\nThere’s a lot going on here but the pattern of cause and effect\n\nis all a muddle and it is not clear whether the muddle starts in\n\nthe syntax or in the history. Certainly there should be a period\n\nafter the market, and if there was one the problem of\n\nthe first sentence might become more evident to writer and\n\nreader: how can invalidism corner a market? And is invalidism a\n\nresponse to the advances in medicine, or are the advances in\n\nmedicine a response to invalidism. Or is it a complex dialectic\n\nthat needs to be stated as such? Sloppy punctuation accompanies\n\nsloppy thought.\n\n1.20 Commas\n\n1.21\n\nCommas and Parentheses\n\nCommas are used to mark out the grammatical structure of a\n\nsentence, essentially indicating where phrases or clauses end so\n\nthat readers can read more confidently and quickly. If you are\n\nunsure of the grammar of sentences, then one guide to the use of\n\ncommas may be breathing: should you pause at this point to help\n\nthe reader get the sense? If yes, then put a comma. However be\n\ncareful that this rule of thumb does not lead to mistakes of\n\nsense and note that television drama (notably\n\nNeighbours) uses very odd pauses and may be entirely\n\nresponsible for the generalisation of fault 1.22 listed below.\n\nHere’s an example of where commas should be used to make the\n\nsense clearer:\n\nThere is also a feeling that even when they want to people\n\ncannot link language to their sentiments.\n\nThis reads better with commas indicating the parenthetical\n\nclause: There is also a feeling that, even when they want to,\n\npeople cannot link language to their sentiments.\n\nIn this parenthetical form, the commas mark out a qualification\n\nor a condition. In this case it is an intensifier.\n\nIt is quite common for students (and others!) to put a comma at\n\nthe beginning or end of a parenthetical clause or phrase, but not\n\nat the end (or at the end but not at the beginning). For example:\n\nThere is also a feeling that, even when they want to people\n\ncannot link language to their sentiments.\n\nThe first comma opens an anticipation of a closing comma to\n\nsignal the end of the parenthesis. When the parenthesis does not\n\ncome, a small alarm bell rings in the mind of a sophisticated\n\nreader and distracts attention from the sense of what is being\n\nargued. It may also alter the sense. For example:\n\nHamlet’s mother, Queen Gertrude married King Hamlet’s\n\nbrother.\n\nEven knowing the story, this takes a moment to fathom. It read\n\nmuch better as:\n\nHamlet’s mother, Queen Gertrude, married King Hamlet’s brother.\n\n1.22\n\nCommas Separating Subjects from Verbs\n\nA comma should not separate a subject from its verb unless a\n\nparenthetical clause intervenes. The following are egregiously\n\nwrong:\n\nFreud in this case, pays heed to Greek poets rather than any\n\nbiological proof.\n\nLacan’s theory, takes note of ‘the complicity between the\n\nlaws of language and the laws of kinship’.\n\nThis kind of error may derive either from modern speech patterns,\n\nor from confusion with the correct punctuation of sentences which\n\nopen with an adverb or adverbial phrase which qualifies the main\n\nverb. Thus:\n\nHurriedly, she put the gun in her purse.\n\nDuring the opening scenes, Othello strikes us as secure in\n\nhis martial authority and control of language.\n\nIn its desire to exert control over the readers’ responses,\n\nthe book resembles the political reflexes of the\n\neighteenth-century magistracy.\n\nBy giving preference to the popular and persuasive over\n\nlearned discourse, Granville is here reflecting the Royal\n\nSociety’s debt to the previous century’s Ramist reforms.\n\nYou can always test whether you have understood the syntax\n\ncorrectly by putting the clause at the end of the sentence and\n\nseeing if it still sounds all right. Viz:\n\nGranville is here reflecting the Royal Society’s debt to the\n\nprevious century’s Ramist reforms by giving preference to the\n\npopular and persuasive over learned discourse.\n\nClauses are entire or relatively entire grammatical units that\n\ncan be moved around in a sentence (like chairs in a room) without\n\nfalling to pieces. The sense may shift a bit but there is no\n\nevident sense of breakage or lack when they are put in another\n\nplace.\n\nNote that this rule of not splitting subjects from verbs can be\n\nbroken when you want to put an intervening parenthesis, provided\n\nthat, as in the following, the parenthesis is closed before the\n\nverb:\n\nCentral to this argument is the contention that Tristram\n\nShandy, and more specifically the character of Dr Slop, embodies\n\nSterne’s reaction to the advance of technology in Britain.\n\nThe novel illustrates how truth, in the form the region’s\n\naboriginal history, is oppressed and erased from memory in Latin\n\nAmerica.\n\n1.230\n\nCommas and Relative Clauses\n\nThe question of whether or not to put a comma before\n\nwhich or that seems hard to fathom to some\n\nstudents, and not without reason. To begin with the elementary,\n\nthere are a number of relative pronouns which we use to introduce\n\nrelative clauses: who, whom, whose, which, that, when, where,\n\nwhile.\n\nWhich came in the door is not a sentence because it\n\nlacks a subject, except where it is a question-form meaning\n\nWhich one came in the door? When it is not\n\ninterrogative, which came in the door is a relative\n\nclause describing or modifying whatever which refers to\n\nand it would be wrong to write Marjorie went out in her car.\n\nWhich she had just bought. One might, however, in certain\n\ncircumstances, write Marjorie went out in her car, which she\n\nhad just bought, and found it had been splashed with red\n\npaint. There are rules governing when it is possible or\n\nnecessary to put commas before relative pronouns in this type of\n\nsentence, and these rules depend on knowing when the clause is\n\n‘restrictive’ or ‘non-restrictive’.\n\n1.231\n\nRestrictive or Defining Relative Clauses\n\nRestrictive relative clauses, which are also called ‘defining\n\nrelative clauses’, restrict or limit the number of possible\n\nreferents of its antecedent. That is the most frequent\n\nrelative pronoun used for introducing restrictive relative\n\nclauses, although in certain circumstances which or\n\nother members of the wh- group (which, who, whom,\n\nwhose, when, while) may be used. Here are some examples of\n\nrestrictive relative clauses:\n\nShe wrote many novels which use gothic elements.\n\nShe wrote a best-seller that grossed over two million\n\ndollars.\n\nNovels which use gothic elements are rarely found before\n\n1780.\n\nMen who wear yellow ties nearly always have big feet.\n\nUnlike non-restrictive clauses (see below), a restrictive or\n\ndefining relative clause cannot be separated from the main clause\n\nby commas or other forms of punctuation unless the comma\n\nintroduces a parenthesis.\n\n1.232 Non-restrictive or Amplifying\n\nRelative Clauses\n\nNon-restrictive clauses do not restrict the possible referents of\n\nthe antecedents; rather, they amplify the sense of the\n\nantecedents. For this reason they are also called ‘amplifying’\n\nclauses. They function very much like parentheses and have\n\nsimilar punctuation requirements. For example:\n\nHe put Kant’s Critique, which he had just begun to\n\nread, on the table in front of her.\n\nHe put down Kant’s Critique, which he had only just begun to\n\nread.\n\nSentences which include non-restrictive relative clauses contain\n\ntwo independent statements, one of which can be dropped without\n\nharm to the main clause. In spoken English the non-restrictive\n\nrelative clause is separated from the main clause by a change in\n\nintonation. In writing the non-restrictive relative clause is\n\nalways preceded by a comma and closed off by a further comma or a\n\nfull stop or period. Non-restrictive relative clauses are\n\nintroduced by wh- form pronouns, nver by that.\n\nThe following sentence appears wrong. Why?\n\nIt is this destruction, which symbolises the triumph of\n\npatriarchy.\n\nAnswer: the comma and the use of which imply that what\n\nfollows is a non-restrictive clause, whereas in fact the clause\n\nis restrictive. What the writer actually means is It is this\n\ndestruction that symbolises the triumph of patriarchy. (Cf.\n\nShe wrote a best-seller that grossed over two million\n\ndollars. )\n\nAs a rule of thumb, therefore, in most cases you should resist\n\nthe inclination to put a comma before which or\n\nthat unless you want to mark a non-restrictive\n\nparenthetical clause or phrase before resuming the main line of\n\nthe sentence. For example:\n\nThe audience, which had paid a fortune to get in, was not at\n\nall pleased.\n\nIf the clause is restrictive rather than amplifying, this kind of\n\nparenthesis cannot be used. In the next example, the relative\n\nclause is inaugurated by when but the problem is the\n\nsame:\n\nLear’s natural authority as father is undermined by Goneril\n\nand Regan, when they force his complete abdication, demonstrating\n\ntheir filial ingratitude’.\n\nEvidently the relation of when they force his complete\n\nabdication is restrictive so the comma before it is merely\n\nconfusing.\n\nThe use of commas to indicate restriction or non-restriction can\n\nhave completely change the sense of a sentece, and even have vast\n\nlegal and historical implications. For example, in the following\n\nthe presence or absence of commas radically changes the meaning\n\nby making the clause either restrictive or non-restrictive:\n\nMembers of the audience, who were middle class, were taken\n\nout and shot.\n\nMembers of the audience who were middle class were taken out\n\nand shot.\n\n1.233\n\nSentential Relative Clauses\n\nIn this special kind of non-restrictive relative clause, the\n\nsentential relative clause amplifies the sense of an entire verb\n\nphrase or a full sentence. For example:\n\nShe wrote a best-seller, which we had long suspected she\n\nwould do.\n\nHe tells Jane that he will never let her leave, which prompts\n\nJane to confess her love for him.\n\nIn these cases the nature of the clause is almost disjunctive and\n\nthe comma helps to signal that what will follow is set off\n\nagainst the main clause. You can test for this kind of clause by\n\nasking if the clause would stand on its own as a sentence, if the\n\nrelative pronoun were replaced by this.\n\n1.234\n\nSequences of Relative Clauses\n\nFor stylistic and grammatical reasons it is generally as well to\n\navoid having too many relative clauses in one sentence. Very\n\nsophisticated writers, of course, by definition offer lucidity in\n\ncomplex structures, but it is best to realise that this is an art\n\nform in itself. What must not be done is to put two relative\n\nclauses together in the same clause or phrase, as in the\n\nfollowing example:\n\nAs Edgar’s death is approaching, having been comforted by the\n\nloss of his daughter, which may well have been a displacement\n\nwhich aided the process for him, he confesses to Nelly that he\n\nhas ‘prayed often for the approach of what is coming, and now I\n\nbegin to shrink and fear it.’\n\nThis sentence violates the general guideline that you should not\n\nhave more than one relative clause introduced by which\n\nor that in a sentence, unless you mark off the clauses\n\nwith commas. This sentence is in fact so bad it could not be\n\nsaved by inserting a comma after displacement.\n\nThe following sentence is similarly dire. Whilst it does at least\n\nkeep the two relative clauses at a distance, it is still\n\nlogically very hard to fathom.\n\nCathy’s memories of the past and nature are curbed, allowing\n\na repression of her love-object until the liberation, which\n\ncauses the melancholia, and consequently the Death Instinct,\n\nwhich ultimately kills her.\n\nSuch sentences remind me of a Charlie Chaplin cartoon in which he\n\ncarries a pile of plates across a restaurant, begins to stumble,\n\ndrops one plate, and trying to catch that plate stumbles some\n\nmore, and so rushes across the screen trying to catch the plates\n\nand falling further from the vertical at each futile attempt to\n\nsave the situation. They are so much fun, here’s another:\n\nFreud talks of the case of Judge Schreber, who wrote a book\n\nabout his psychotic illness where he describes how he felt that\n\nGod, who supposedly resembles Schreber’s father who was a famous\n\nphysician, chose to emasculate him in order for him to reproduce\n\nas a woman and create a new race of men. Schreber’s case is\n\nremarkably similar to that of Victor Frankenstein who wants to\n\nmake a woman without the participation of woman.\n\nChaplin’s pathos derives from the gulf between his good-hearted\n\nintentions and the outcome. The same pathos is evident in the\n\nabove where intelligence and real learning fail in their goal,\n\nand in this writing there is no deus ex machina to bring\n\nabout a happy ending.\n\n1.31\n\nColons and Semicolons\n\nIn simple terms, colons are used to signal that what follows is\n\nan explanation or an example of what has gone before. The\n\nmovement is usually from a general remark to a specific example.\n\nThe matter coming after a colon may involve an expansion, a list\n\nor an extended quotation. There should always be a relation of\n\ngrammatical equality between what comes before and what comes\n\nafter the colon, a rule which demands that each be able to stand\n\nas sentences in their own right. For example, Many leading\n\npoliticians have been notorious womanisers: David Lloyd George\n\nand Jack Kennedy were two of a kind.\n\nSemicolons can be seen as similar to full stops but slightly\n\nweaker. It is misleading to see them as a variant on the colon\n\n(despite the name). Semicolons are used to separate independent\n\nclauses in strings, thus:\n\nThis novel is as much about literature as it is about the\n\nhistory of Latin America; published in 1967, the novel is\n\ncharacteristically postmodern in its awareness of its own\n\nfictional status.\n\nOr, as another example:\n\nOedipa Maas, as the classic private-eye, needs to know; she\n\nmust struggle to bridge the gap between appearance and reality;\n\nshe must question the reliability of every source.\n\nSemicolons should not be used to separate a phrase from a clause\n\n[a clause has a subject, finite verb and predicate; a phrase\n\nlacks one or more of these parts and cannot stand as an\n\nindependent unit of sense]:\n\nOne unifying factor is the teasing relation between text and\n\nreader, perhaps augmenting the conventional role played by\n\nsuspense; embroiling the reader in the mystery.\n\nHere the semicolon should be a comma.\n\nConversely, commas should not be used to join two clauses. Here\n\nthe appropriate punctuation is a semicolon.\n\nAusten’s novels are romances; they all lead to marriage and\n\nhappy endings.\n\nOne test for this use of the semicolon is that it can be\n\nexchanged for a period without violence. (See 3 above). If a\n\nconjunction is used (for example one could insert ‘since’ in the\n\nabove) then the semicolon should not be used; a comma is\n\nappropriate.\n\n1. 4\n\nDashes\n\nDashes can be used to set off parenthetical remarks where the\n\nintegration of the material inside the host sentence is very\n\nunclear. They might be seen as rather like oral ‘asides’. They\n\nare effective for introducing vivacity into a discourse but if\n\nthey are used extensively they lead to a loss of precision\n\nbecause their grammatical relation to the host sentence is\n\nuncertain.\n\nTypographically dashes should be typed either as a long dash\n\n(called an ‘em-dash’ because it is as long as a letter ‘m’, hence\n\ndistinguished from an ‘en-dash’ which is as long as an ‘n’), or\n\nas two hyphens (en-dashes) with no space between. Conventions\n\ndiffer about whether or not there should be a space before and\n\nafter the dash: in American English there tends to be none; in\n\nEnglish English there often is. For example:\n\nAn initial reading of Wuthering Heights through Freud’s\n\nconcept of the structure of the psyche – his Id, Ego and\n\nSuper-ego – may be to align the Id with Heathcliff, the Ego with\n\nCathy and the Super-ego with Edgar.\n\n1.50\n\nApostrophes\n\n1.51\n\nThe Use of the Apostrophe S for Possessives\n\nIn the 1970s or thereabouts many UK school teachers gave up\n\nteaching the use of the apostrophe s to indicate possession, but\n\nit is now back into the English Language GCSE syllabus because it\n\nactually matters if you wish to make your sense clear. The\n\nEnglish language has a particular need of this sign since it is\n\nour primary method of indicating what in a language with cases\n\n(Latin, German) is called the genitive.\n\nFor example\n\nIn the singular: the reader’s responses (meaning the\n\nresponse of a single reader).\n\nIn the plural: the readers’ responses (meaning the\n\nresponses of various readers)\n\nWhere the final consonant of a singular word is already an s\n\nopinions differ about how to indicate the possessive. You can\n\nwrite\n\nDickens’s novels or Dickens’ novels (the novels\n\nof Dickens). Generally the first form is better, but observe that\n\none would write the parent’s orders (the orders of the\n\nparent) but avoid writing the parents’s orders (the\n\norders of the parents) because one would not pronounce it like\n\nthis. In this case, then, the parents’ orders is to be\n\npreferred.\n\nNote: the family’s home, society’s values [not\n\nfamilies, societies which are plurals]\n\n1.52\n\nThe apostrophe of omission: It’s and Who’s (as\n\nopposed to Its and Whose)\n\nThe apostrophe of possession is often confused with an apostrophe\n\nmarking the omission of a letter, particularly when one says or\n\nwrites it’s in place of it is. Because we say\n\nSusie’s car there’s a naturally tendency to think that\n\nthe apostrophe in it’s is an apostrophe marking\n\npossession. Actually, no: this apostrophe marks the omission of\n\nthe i in is — it’s means it\n\nis.\n\nIf you want a possessive pronoun that indicates someting is a\n\nproperty of something else then you use its without the\n\napostropher (on a par with hers, theirs, yours). For\n\nexample, he polished the table until you could see your face\n\nin its shine.\n\nHere’s an example of the use of both kinds of apostrophe in one\n\nphrase:\n\nIts quality, it’s clear, is above reproach.\n\nIn the same vein, do not confuse who’s and\n\nwhose. The former is a contraction of who is,\n\nthe latter is a possessive pronoun.\n\nExample Who’s coming to the pub? and Whose car shall\n\nwe go in. These usages are rarely mistaken in English,\n\nwhereas the “its and it’s conundrum” bedevils\n\neveryone at some stage or other.\n\n1.60\n\nHyphens\n\nMany combinations of adjectives, adverbs and nouns into combined\n\nforms (well-made, well-wishing, free-floating, the\n\nnineteenth-century novel) require joining with hyphens.\n\nEnglish is very rich in such combinations and the use of hyphens\n\nusually optional, but sometimes more or less required by\n\npredominant practice. Many of these requirements are given in\n\ndictionaries so if in doubt it is well worth checking. Sense can\n\nalso be a good guide: hyphenation is a way of indicating to the\n\nreader that the first term in the sequence is there to modify\n\nwhat comes after it, rather than meaning to stand on its own\n\nfeet. For example, we would write some time during the\n\nnineteenth century, but we should write public health in\n\nnineteenth-century London.\n\nThe following rules are worth learning:\n\nAlways use a hyphen to link a number to a noun in a compound\n\nadjective placed before a noun. For example, second-year\n\nstudents, early-nineteenth-century novels. But note there is\n\nno hyphen in such forms as novels of the nineteenth\n\ncentury. In this case century is functioning as a\n\nnoun, not as part of a compound modifying string.\n\nSimilarly, use hyphens to join the following adverbs or\n\nadjectives placed before the noun they determine; well-read,\n\nall-powerful, all-consuming, better-known, ill-constructed,\n\nunder-paid, lower-class. Note that almost all compounds\n\nbeginning in well- and all- should be\n\nhyphenated. Note that when coming after the noun (‘postpositive’)\n\nthe hyphens are dropped: He was a very well-read man.\n\nBut He was renowned for being very well read.\n\nUse hyphens in other compound adjectives where the lack of\n\nthe hyphen will lead to a problem of sense. For example, the\n\nEnglish-language textbooks (i.e. textbooks on the English\n\nlanguage, as opposed to English language textbooks,\n\ntextbooks on language that are published in English).\n\nThere is a common and erroneous tendency to drop hyphens in\n\ncompounds formed with self, as in\n\nself-development, self-understanding. For\n\nexample, if one says The novel depicts the neurosis of\n\ninvalidism in a self obsessive world the reader will at\n\nfirst think you are saying depicts the neurosis of invalidism\n\nin a self and only then realise that there is something more\n\nto come. The novel depicts the neurosis of invalidism in a\n\nself-obsessive world reads more effectively. As a rule,\n\nalways hyphenate self in compound forms.\n\nNote the following where hyphens are usual:\n\nRole-model, word-play, son-in-law.\n\n1.61\n\nHyphens and Prefixes\n\nNever use a prefix followed by space, as in post war,\n\npost modern, anti feminist. Either close up or\n\nhyphenate.\n\nGenerally you should not hyphenate a prefix. Use postwar\n\nnot post-war, postmodern not post-modern,\n\nanticlimax not anti-climax. However sometimes\n\nyou may want to hyphenate a suffix in order to make the sense of\n\nseparation clear. For example, post-Victorian,\n\npost-Freudian, pre-Renaissance, pre-Augustan,\n\nanti-feminist, post-Modernists, anti-American,\n\nanti-Communists, anti-abortion, anti-apartheid.\n\n1.62\n\nHyphens and Suffixes\n\nUsing like as a suffix, hyphenate. For example in\n\ndoll-like.\n\n1.63\n\nPunctuating Quotations:See 6.43\n\nbelow.\n\nChapter 2. Logic\n\n2.1\n\nCausal Conjunctions and Logic\n\nAvoid ‘gestural causality’, by which I mean avoid using ‘thus’ or\n\n‘because’ or ‘therefore’ to suggest a causal relation where none\n\nhas been otherwise established.\n\nA focus on freedom — how one is free and how that freedom is\n\ndefined against society — is a main issue in\n\nRosmersholm. Here there is even more of a sense\n\nthat you cannot be free this side of death, thus the tragic\n\ndouble suicide ending. Sexuality is not the tense undercurrent\n\nthat it is in A Doll’s House.\n\nThe writer is failing to explain how you can be free after death\n\nand why the double suicide occurs. There are such links to be\n\nmade, but instead of being made they are being gestured towards.\n\nHere is another example: Malcolm Bradbury and James\n\nMacFarlane suggest that modernism is a literature of crisis, that\n\nthe modernist novel tries ‘to handle a sense of the nihilistic\n\ndisorder behind the ordered surface of life and reality’. Thus\n\nthe focus on things such as death and sexuality starts to become\n\nso integral to the plot.\n\nAnd another where thus is vainly trying to establish a\n\ncausality inside what is in fact a dull tautology: The laws\n\nof polite society govern whether she is to constitute part of the\n\n‘everybody’ and thus transgression of the polite society would\n\nplace her outside of acceptability.\n\nAnd another where whereby is covering a lack of\n\nknowledge rather than helping us to learn: In ‘The Second\n\nTreatise on Government’ Locke represents a fantasy world of\n\nnature whereby all men are equal and given a fair chance to\n\nsucceed.\n\nIn many cases of gestural (or specious) causality the point would\n\nbe accepted if the writer used no conjunctions at all. What is\n\nbeing asserted is an association, a condition of concomitance,\n\nand this can best be communicated by a simple period or by ‘and’.\n\n2.2\n\nDangling Causes\n\nIt is rarely forceful to conclude a sentence with a causal\n\nexplanation.\n\nThis desire arises from the mother lavishing too much\n\ntenderness on the boy, and can result in his inability to bond\n\nwith other females when he grows into an adult, because of the\n\nguilt of unfaithfulness.\n\nCf.: This desire arises from the mother lavishing too much\n\ntenderness on the boy and can result in a guilty sense that he is\n\nbeing unfaithful when as an adult he tries to bond with other\n\nfemales.\n\n2.3 The\n\nIndefinite ‘This’ and Logic\n\nA common sign that logic is becoming weak is when one wants to\n\nbegin a sentence with ‘This’. This is not an invariant sign of\n\npoor logic (see this sentence as an example), but I do counsel\n\ncaution every time this impulse is felt. Be sure that ‘This’\n\nrefers to a clear and unambiguous subject of the previous\n\nsentence or group of sentences. If ‘this’ gestures vaguely\n\ntowards a host of complex ideas, be sure that it can legitimately\n\nhold them together, otherwise the logic wobbles and falls over.\n\nBeware equally of the use of ‘this” to end a sentence, viz.:\n\nWhilst some apologists for Burroughs have cited the satire of\n\nJonathan Swift as the main literary inspiration for his work, he\n\nis in fact closer to de Sade, both writers sharing the same\n\ndesire for human freedom from the forces and power structures\n\nthat imprison them, and both using much the same methods to\n\ndepict this.\n\nTo which the immediate response is to say ‘This what?’\n\nHere’s another very fine example, taken from an essay on\n\nWaiting for Godot:\n\nThroughout the play, the two main characters try to remember\n\ntheir past in order to obtain a justification for their\n\nexistence. This does not satisfy them so they continue to ask\n\nwhat is their purpose and function: ‘Estragon: ” What do we do\n\nnow, now that we are happy?”\n\nWhat is meant by this ‘this’ that does not satisfy them? The\n\ntrying? The remembering? The failing to remember? The writer is\n\nskating across the surface, content with vagueness, not searching\n\nout precisely what is happening in the play.\n\nHere’s an example of the same problem, but this time using ‘It’:\n\nIbsen presents a view of the struggle faced by women in a\n\nmale-dominated society. It is not altogether satisfying, after\n\nall neither of his women survive, but it does highlight the\n\nimportance of the social issue.\n\nEvidently the loose use of ‘it’ in the second sentence is not the\n\nonly problem this writing offers.\n\n2.4\n\nLike and As\n\nLike and as are used to establish relations of\n\nidentity or similitude between objects, concepts or events.\n\nAs means ‘in the manner of,’ or ‘in exactly the manner\n\nof’, whereas like implies some kind of identity, whether\n\nclose or loose. Therefore whilst at times the sense of both words\n\nis almost identical, because as implies identity rather\n\nthan mere likeness there are times when like is just too\n\nloose. Here are some examples where like should be\n\nreplaced by as:\n\nIs it more or less voyeuristic to claim, like Andy Warhol\n\nonce did, that . . .\n\nIn To the Lighthouse, like in Cubism, emphasis is\n\nplaced on the representation of successive perceptions in\n\ntime.\n\nCampion uses spaces conventionally when making a point about\n\nwomen’s forced subordination, like when Ada is literally\n\nbarricaded into her own home.\n\nLike the piano was Aida’s fetish, she was his fetish.\n\nThis may be because like is stronger than as so when like is\n\nused the reader will question just what the similarity is and\n\nwonder if what the writer says is valid. When the writer says as\n\nthen the reader accepts a loose parallel and moves on without any\n\nquestion.\n\nLike is clearly being over-used and abused in\n\ncontemporary discourse, especially in radio discussions where you\n\nwill sometimes hear like, and even the richly redundant\n\nexpression kinder like, pasted into nearly every\n\nthought. Evidently this misuse indicates an attempt to see\n\npattern or establish associations but these are intuitions or\n\nimpressions loosely understood. It is an intellectual’s role to\n\nfind the deeper sense, and it does not take many likes\n\nin a string to weaken beyond reason the logic of an argument.\n\n2.5\n\nLoose Relations\n\nBeware using a relative pronoun such that the articulation of the\n\ntwo thoughts around it is imprecise. For example\n\nThe business man is therefore able to cross previously closed\n\nsocial boundaries as a result of money which had the effect of\n\nloosening the social structure and eventually leading to more\n\ndemocratic politics.\n\nThis sentence comprises two, articulated around which.\n\nWhat comes after which qualifies money but\n\nbecause which is being used in a non-restrictive manner\n\n(see 1.232 above) one has the sense of two thoughts being tied\n\ntogether with a leather thong after the fashion of a flail. Flail\n\nis what the sense does. No knee or elbow joint in this\n\narticulation.\n\nChapter 3. Problems with verbs\n\n3.1\n\nSplit Infinitives\n\nIn this famous example, To boldly go where no man has gone\n\nbefore, the infinitive ‘to go’ is split by ‘boldly’.\n\nSimilarly in to better understand, to quickly run. Split\n\ninfinitives are relatively common, sometimes amusing, sometimes\n\ninoffensive, sometimes silly. Always better to avoid them.\n\n(Always to better avoid them, if you see what I mean.)\n\nFor example, compare\n\nIt is tempting to initially conclude\n\nIt is tempting initially to conclude\n\nIt is initially tempting to conclude\n\nThe third version is the best since it makes clear that it is the\n\ntemptation that is initial. The first version is the worst since\n\nit brings initially and conclude so close it\n\nverges on nonsense: how can one conclude (i.e. reach an end)\n\ninitially (i.e. to begin with)? The second version is almost as\n\ngood as the third version.\n\nHere are some other split infinitives which may repay study:\n\nShe has enough strength to only do what she feels is\n\nright\n\nCf. She has enough strength only to do what she feels is\n\nright.\n\nThe device is used to both demonstrate and retain\n\nauthority\n\nCf. The device is used both to demonstrate and retain\n\nauthority\n\n3.2\n\nPrepositional or Phrasal Verbs\n\nThe English language makes abundant use of prepositional or\n\nphrasal verbs (to go up, to go down, to go\n\naround)—indeed there are said to be more than 3000\n\nprepositional verbs in regular use in English—but these seem to\n\nconfuse more and more writers when the preposition is remote from\n\nthe verb itself. Here is an example of the preposition going\n\nwrong:\n\nThis essay aims to familiarise the reader of the social\n\nenvironment of the time.\n\nThe writer evidently means that this essay aims to\n\nfamiliarise the reader with the social\n\nenvironment of the time. What is written implies that the\n\nreader being written about lived in a time before the time of\n\nwriting, whereas logically one deduces that the reader is a\n\ncontemporary of the author. In fact, the author would have been\n\nbetter advised to write the writer aims to make the reader\n\nfamiliar with the social environment of the time, keeping\n\nthe verb and the preposition close together and so averting any\n\npotential ambiguity. There are no simple cures for problems of\n\nthis kind. It is necessary re-read and to pay acute attention to\n\nhow the preposition relates to the verb and to other words in its\n\nimmediate context.\n\n3.3\n\nAgreement of Tense\n\nTake care to avoid changes of tense inside a sentence, thus:\n\nCrusoe was stranded on a desert island and is forced to\n\nrepent for his previous sins. This error usually arises from\n\nthinking in the continuous present and then inadvertently\n\ndropping into the past. Whilst one could put the whole in the\n\npast tense, this sentence reads better as Crusoe is stranded\n\non a desert island and is forced to repent for his previous\n\nsins. Consider similarly: Fraud was a crime worthy of\n\ndeath while theft is seen as something than can be condoned by\n\ncircumstances. The shift to the present in the second verb\n\ncreates doubt as to whether theft was seen in this way\n\nor is still seen in this way.\n\n3.4\n\nAgreement of Number\n\nSimilarly, take care to ensure agreement in number (singular or\n\nplural) between the subject of a verb and the verb itself.\n\nFor example, The smell of lemons causes her to sneeze.\n\n(Not The smell of lemons cause her to sneeze.)\n\nProblems usually arise when the subject and the verb are some\n\ndistance apart, as in the following example: The\n\nsituation Roxana finds herself in as regards the threats\n\nof imprisonment or worse at the hands of the jewel collector\n\nare brought about by one of her previous husbands.\n\nArguably this writer would not have made the error if he had not\n\nproduced such an ungainly structure in the first place.\n\nProblems may also arise when using collective nouns and complex\n\nsubjects, as for example:\n\nA herd of cows is quite dangerous. [Not are quite\n\ndangerous.]\n\nChapter 4. Lexicon (Vocabulary)\n\nThe Greek word ‘logos’ meant word and reason (implicitly\n\ntherefore ‘order’). The Greek Old Testament began In the\n\nbeginning was the word and the word was with God, and\n\nthereby signified that law and the word were simultaneously\n\nincarnate. The Latin word ‘lex’ meant law, and ‘lexicon’ meant a\n\ndictionary. Again the word was law. And more recently Jacques\n\nLacan has provided a synoptic critique of this structure in his\n\npunning realisation the le nom du père (the name of the\n\nfather) is also le non du père (the No! of the father).\n\nRadical thought admits, even as it critiques, that to speak badly\n\nis to risk that to speak or write is to risk both the\n\npromulgation and the subversion of the law.\n\n4.1\n\nConcision and Plain Style\n\nGenerally, good style is lean: the fewer words, the more force,\n\nprovided the words are exact to their task. Similarly good style\n\nuses the simplest words for its task. The thought may be very\n\ncomplex, the structure may be highly articulated, but if you look\n\nat the building bocks (words, phrases), they are almost\n\ninvariably the most fitted to their purpose.\n\nThe following might ‘sound good’ to some, they do not\n\ndisclose their hearts in shared confidences but does it tell\n\nus more than they do not share confidences?\n\nThe following sounds like a government service euphemism:\n\nThose women who recognise their need for a masculine presence\n\nwithin their existence\n\nBad writing usually results from the writer thinking they need to\n\nsound like someone in authority and, as a general rule, it is\n\nwrong to try to sound like something one is not. Complex thought\n\ncomes out of complex thinking, not out of complex style. Look\n\nclosely at the sentences of most distinguished writers and you\n\nwill invariably find that the words chosen and the syntax used\n\nare fundamentally simple. What makes for complexity is the way\n\nthe words fit together.\n\n4.20\n\nThe Personal\n\n4.21\n\nSpeaking in one’s own voice — the Personal\n\nPronoun\n\nIt is unwise to use the first person when writing scholarly\n\nessays because foregrounding personal belief often leads to\n\nsimple assertion (‘I believe’, ‘I find’, ‘I like’) where\n\nwhat is needed is an intellectual demonstration of why the reader\n\nshould be persuaded to agree with your contentions. [Cf. the\n\ndiscussion and examples in 4.94 below.] Evidently to intrude the\n\n‘I’ occasionally can be honest and helpful, as when one might\n\nsay, for example, ‘Speaking personally I find this very hard\n\nto credit.‘ However striking the right balance here needs to\n\nbe recognised as a fine art.\n\n4.22\n\nColloquialism\n\nDeadening professional jargon is the Scylla of bad style;\n\ncolloquialism is the Charybdis: a salty everdayness will be\n\nwelcomed if it is acute to its task, but colloquialism is usually\n\nslack and imprecise. For example\n\nWork becomes the most valuable part of Crusoe’s life on the\n\nisland, as that is the only thing that gets him anywhere.\n\nThis sentence is not wrong, it just passes up the opportunity to\n\nsay something interesting about what work means to Robinson, or\n\nabout what he actually achieves.\n\nOr consider these pleasures:\n\nWhen Gulliver starts to bad-mouth British society . . .\n\nThey lived off of what they needed . . .\n\nThe horses get Swift’s moral case across . . .\n\nIbsen is into the truth and the freedom of humankind.\n\n4.3\n\nRedundancy\n\nRedundancy is the obvious failure to be concise. In 1.1 above we\n\nquoted the phrase invalidism cornered the social market.\n\nWhy did the writer say ‘social’? Was it doing any work? Can one\n\nhave an asocial market?\n\nHere are some simple examples where the addition of a needless\n\nadjective weakens communication rather than improving it\n\n. . . a mental frame of mind\n\n. . . from a social class point of view\n\nHere are some common spoken locutions which are needlessly fat\n\nand which should be shortened if used in written professional\n\nEnglish:\n\nThe question as to whether Whether He is a man who He This is a subject which This subject In a very fluent way Fluently Hamlet’s nature is to be indecisive Hamlet is indecisive Very strong Strong\n\n4.40\n\nEchoes\n\n4.41\n\nInternal Echoes\n\nInternal echoes occur when a word is used more than once within a\n\nfew sentences. As with the repetition of musical phrases and\n\nmusical notes, such repetition needs handling with great care if\n\nthe repetition is not going to sound flat, dull, weak,\n\nuninventive. Here’s an instance of repetition seeming to indicate\n\nthe writer has a very small range of concepts to call upon:\n\nBrecht believed that the working class were oppressed and\n\nstrongly believed that they could be given strength through\n\norganised political action.\n\n4.4\n\nExternal Echoes\n\nExternal echoes occur when words are used in such a way at to\n\nbring to mind particular ways of speaking (registers) in other\n\ndiscourses. Consider the following, already mentioned in 1.1.\n\nabove: With new advances in medicine, invalidism cornered the\n\nsocial market, coupled with the boom of the leisure industry, the\n\ncult of invalidism prevailed throughout the nobility of late\n\neighteenth-century society. When this phrase was written the\n\nterm social market was often being used in the media as\n\npart of an ideological counter-attack on the supposed triumph of\n\n‘market values’. Cornered the market is also a phrase\n\noften used in stock-market vernacular. The writer seems to have\n\ntaken his phrases from recent newspaper or radio bulletins and\n\ntried to use them to describe a complex historical process\n\noccurring in late-eighteenth-century England. Can invalidism\n\ncorner anything? This transfer of sense from other discourses\n\ninto the discourse of criticisms is more confusing than helpful.\n\nGood writers take care to know how words are being used in\n\ncurrent discourses, and how they once were used. They align their\n\nown uses for or against other dominant uses. Accidental\n\nalignments therefore indicate a failure of intellectual control\n\nover your own means of making sense.\n\n4.5\n\nStrange Bedfellows\n\nMaria and Julia do generally have an extent of intimacy.\n\nCan intimacy be spatial? Can one extend it? We tend to think\n\nof intimacy as intensive, not extensive. You can extend\n\nacquaintance, but surely you deepen intimacy? Effective writing\n\nthinks harder about what words means and the kinds of association\n\nthe meanings wish to set in place.\n\n4.6\n\nMixed Metaphors and Inapt Metaphors\n\nIn the following the metaphor ‘area’ is mixed with the metaphor\n\n‘spinning’\n\nWe find these two areas of concern spinning rapidly around\n\nthe novel.\n\nHow does one imagine an area spinning? And does this effort of\n\nimagining help one better to understand the condition being\n\ndescribed? Generally mixed metaphors add a distracting confusion\n\nto the semantics of a sentence. Here are some other examples:\n\n. . . a focal point upon which the seeker can attach a\n\nnecessary importance . . .\n\n. . . to sink back on a wave of sympathetic emotion . .\n\n.\n\nIn the following sentence we encounter a problem of\n\nmetaphorisation which is also a problem of the logic of\n\nsimilitude:\n\nLaertes’ delayed reaction is in line with mourning.\n\nWhat kind of relation is the writer wishing to establish between\n\nLaertes and mourning? The point is interesting and potentially\n\nvalid, Freud having established that those who are mourning are\n\ninclined to delay. However, using the expression ‘in line’\n\nconjures echoes of ‘standing in line’ and ‘being in line for’ and\n\nthe very linearity of the term does not strike me as particularly\n\nhelpful to establishing the relationship. It certainly does not\n\ndeepen the recognition.\n\n4.7\n\nCatachresis (The incorrect use of words)\n\nThe underlined words in the following examples are not being\n\nproperly used but all the examples come from third year honours\n\nstudents for degrees in English Literature. The sentences or\n\nclauses as they stand are meaningless and it is worth reflecting\n\nthat if a foreign learner were to select these words in a\n\nCambridge Proficiency Examination they would be considered\n\nfailures.\n\nThe Dashwoods are privy to unnecessary cruelty at the\n\nhands of their half-brother and his wife\n\nThe prevalence of the new bride over the single\n\nwoman\n\nThis device pre-empts that both men learn what is\n\nacceptable\n\nAusten therefore provides an implicit social impact\n\nupon the individual character\n\nCritics who assert that the works are mere fairy tales are\n\njuxtaposed by those who claim they are social\n\ncritiques.\n\nCatachresis is like a fungal blight: not always fatal, always a\n\nblemish, always a reduction to health and beauty, it is cured by\n\nregular consultation of a dictionary and paying acute attention\n\nto what people mean when they write and speak.\n\n4.8 Not\n\nthe best word\n\nCatachresis is a manifest lexical mistake, but there are many\n\nsofter versions of this fault where the writer has chosen a word\n\nwhich works, but which does not give the best possible sense. For\n\nexample, a student writes If speech is a means of gaining\n\nsocial recognition, then by refusing to utter meaningful oratory\n\nthis character refuses to be socially integrated. The\n\nexpression meaningful oratory is far too grandiose for\n\nthe desired sense. The character is not refusing to orate, only\n\nto engage in normal conversation. The over-done is always a\n\ndistraction and mistake.\n\n4.90\n\nCommon Lexical Errors\n\n4.91\n\nSplit Words, Combining Words\n\na) Do not split the following\n\nAny one Anyone Any thing Anything Can not Cannot Mean time Meantime Never the less Nevertheless Some one Someone Some thing Something Some what Somewhat What ever Whatever\n\nb) note, that, just to be awkward, whilst (British) English\n\nprefers anyway, anything, anyone, anybody it does not\n\naccept anytime. This should be any time.\n\nSimilarly, whilst we have contracted nevertheless,\n\nopinions divide about none the less or\n\nnonetheless. Take your pick on this one.\n\nc) Take care with into and in to, onto\n\nand on to. Where the in or on are part\n\nof a phrasal verb, they are not fused with to. For\n\nexample, he fell onto the roof; the soldier fell in\n\nto line; the car ran into a bus; the student gave the essay in to\n\nthe teacher.\n\n4.92\n\nShall and Will\n\nWhen someone writes This essay shall consider Pope’s use of\n\nthe mock-heroic it sounds odd. In fact this of\n\nshall used to be correct English and the use of\n\nshall to form futures in spoken English is still common:\n\nI shall go to the beach tomorrow. However there is a\n\nchange going on in the usage of shall. Shall\n\ngenerally implies compulsion, obligation or determination,\n\nespecially when used in the second or third person (for example:\n\nthe tenant shall ensure that rent is paid on time, I shall\n\nclimb Everest before I am forty!) so nowadays will\n\nis normally used to form the future in all three persons. It is\n\ntherefore probably best to reserve shall for usages\n\nwhere you wish to imply compulsion, obligation or determination.\n\n4.930\n\nCommon Confusions and Abuses\n\nOne could take the temperature of a culture by noticing what\n\nwords are frequently used and abused at any moment. These days\n\nthe following errors tend to scream out:\n\n4.931\n\nSpelling Confusions\n\nIndependent There is no such word as independant. A\n\ndependant is someone, usually a relative, who needs\n\nfinancial support. Someone who clings on to your shirt tail\n\nis very dependent. Loose used for lose To loose is to ‘let go’. To lose is to go\n\nhome hungry. Lead used for led Led is the correct past form, even though it sounds like\n\na dull metal. Sprung for sprang sprung is the past participle, to be used in such forms\n\nas he had sprung. Sprang is the past tense, to be used in\n\nsuch forms as she sprang to his help Bourgeoisie for bourgeois Bourgeoisie is the name of the social class, bourgeois is\n\nthe correct adjective\n\n4.932\n\nSemantic Abuse\n\nAffect and effect To affect someone is to influence them emotionally,\n\nusually negatively, hence to disturb; or it means to put on a\n\nshow. To effect is to bring about or accomplish. The\n\neffect is the consequence of an action; the\n\naffect is its emotional reception. Advancement Means promotion in rank or status by someone. E.g. He\n\nsought advancement in the court. It should not be used\n\nother forms of improvement or progress. Brilliant Now used variously to mean ‘thank you’, or ‘good’, with no\n\nsense of either a literal polish or a figurative intellectual\n\nillumination. Dependant and dependent See Independent in 4.831 above. Due to As in ‘it is due to the fact’ : generally careful\n\nusers of English avoid using due to as a preposition\n\n(i.e. before the noun to which it refers) in the written\n\nform. Because of is nearly always preferred. Some\n\nusers believe that due to should be restricted to\n\nits monetary meaning. Fabulous As above, a word presiding over the death of the truly\n\nmarvellous as advertising makes each new banal material\n\nconquest into a index of the divine. See Roland Barthes’\n\nbrilliant essay on ‘The New Citroen’ in his\n\nMythologies as a prophylactic. Infer Often incorrectly confused with imply. To\n\ninfer should only be used in the sense of to\n\ndeduce. You cannot logically infer something to\n\nsomeone. It’s ironic that Thrown about when no irony is intended or possible, usually\n\nto mean just odd, curious, funny, strange. Pre-empt The proper meaning is to acquire in\n\nadvance of or, to the exclusion of, others; to appropriate;\n\nas in the military use, pre-emptive strike. Societal for social Societal is a relatively new term emphasising of society,\n\nwhereas the older term social goes back to the sense of\n\ncompanion, comrade, friend and implies a community, an\n\ninter-related group. To distinguish the societal from the\n\nsocial therefore implies that you can have a group that is\n\nnot a community; it is a term that fits with a market\n\neconomics view of society. Personally I think we should not\n\ngo along with this general slippage. Tragic Now being used in newspapers to whip up emotion about any\n\npublic death. Utilise for use utilise means to make practical or worthwhile use of.\n\nThrough its relations with utility and utilitarian it\n\nstresses the tool-like aspect of use. Much used (utilised) by\n\nmilitary technologists and distribution managers because it\n\nsounds male and scientific. Utilised is definitely not to be\n\nused in place of use for fear that all words will be made\n\ntool-like things.\n\n4.94\n\nSexism\n\nIt should go without saying these days that no sentence should\n\nimply that man is a sign that can stand for all men and\n\nwomen. This trope, common to writing before the mid 1970s, relied\n\non the assumption (which used to be general law) that the male\n\nidentity covered the female and was superior to it. Such\n\nsentences as the following, written by a female student aged 20\n\nin 1999, should no longer be written: In our contemporary\n\nsociety where the individual is cut off from his religious roots,\n\nman feels lost and his inexplicable actions appear absurd and\n\nuseless. This sentence should have read: In our\n\ncontemporary society where individuals are cut off from their\n\nreligious roots, people feel lost and their inexplicable actions\n\nappear absurd and useless. Use the plural and\n\npeople instead of the singular man.\n\n4.95\n\n‘Interestingly’\n\nThe problem with ‘interestingly‘, or ‘it is\n\ninteresting to note that’, is that this you have to be very\n\nsure that what you say immediately after it does in fact justify\n\nthis rhetorical flourish. If you use the word and say no more,\n\nthen it reads like an empty claim. It is therefore best used with\n\ngreat caution, if at all. My favourite example of the misuse of\n\nthis word is the following: ‘Interestingly Moll’s role as a\n\nwoman fascinates me.‘ To which one might respond, ‘Good\n\nfor you.’\n\nChapter 5. Improving a Style\n\n5.1\n\nParagraphing\n\nPagraphing can be seen as a larger kind of segmenting than the\n\nsentence, and as smaller than the essay, chapter or section.\n\nParagraphing has much to do with how much material the human\n\nbrain can process before it needs to digest and store what has\n\nbeen said. It can therefore be thought of by analogy with eating,\n\nand with computer processing. In all such processes, only so much\n\ncan be taken in before the batch has to be dealt with and put\n\ninto storage. Paragraphs that are too short feel bitty and\n\ninsubstantial; paragraphs that are long are hard to digest. The\n\nhappy size of a paragraph is related to its content. Dense work,\n\nlike shortbread, needs to be taken in small bites; lighter work,\n\nlike soufflés, can be taken on big spoons.\n\nTo find guidance on the appropriate length, examine examples of\n\neffective writing. As a simple guide, five to fifteen lines is\n\nnormal, and no paragraph should be longer than a page.\n\nThe first sentence of each paragraph should announce the topic\n\nwhich succeeding sentences will expand upon. When the paragraph\n\nis not the first in a section, the first sentence should also\n\nestablish a relationship with the preceding paragraph, perhaps\n\nhelping to draw what was said in the preceding paragraph together\n\nas it establishes the ground for what is about to be discussed.\n\nThis process will be helped if the last sentence of the preceding\n\nparagraph has worked to bring the matters discussed in that\n\nparagraph together.\n\n5.2\n\nImproving Coordination\n\nThe following paragraph from an essay on T. S. Eliot’s poem\n\nThe Waste Land brings together a number of valuable\n\nperceptions, but tends simple to associate them in a loose\n\ncollocation.\n\nThe ‘Burial of the Dead’ claims London to be an ‘unreal city’\n\nand includes the often quoted lines ‘ a crowd flowed over London\n\nBridge/ I never knew that death had undone so many’. This is a\n\nreference to the modern urbanisation and the artist’s sense of\n\nalienation within it. There is a possible touch of personal\n\npessimism here. Eliot was one of the rush hour ‘masses’ when he\n\nworked for Lloyds of London; a period when he felt his artistic\n\ncreativity stifled. The Waste Land expresses a fear of the\n\nmasses; they are ‘so many’ and they keep flowing. Their sheer\n\nnumber is threatening and their movement, whilst continual, is\n\nnot progressive. They are the living dead and they allude to the\n\nsoldiers of the First World War marching to their death. The tone\n\nis pessimistic and relays a sense of hopelessness as ‘each man\n\nfixed his eyes before his feet’, unable to look far ahead. They\n\nare the sacrifice of war not the salvation for a decaying\n\ncivilisation.\n\nBy making small stylistic adjustments throughout, the same\n\n‘matter’ can be made to read better and make much more powerful\n\nsense:\n\nThe ‘Burial of the Dead’ represents London as an\n\n‘unreal city’ and includes the often quoted lines ‘a crowd flowed\n\nover London Bridge/ I never knew that death had undone so many’,\n\nwhich capture in one graphic image the idea of modern\n\nurbanisation and the artist’s sense of alienation within it,\n\nan alienation which has a personal ring because Eliot was\n\none of the rush hour ‘masses’ when he worked for Lloyds of\n\nLondon. The Waste Land expresses a fear of the masses, of their\n\nsheer number and of their movement which is continual\n\nbut not progressive. The masses are the living dead and\n\nthere is something in their manner — ‘each man fixed his eyes\n\nbefore his feet’, unable to face the future – which alludes to\n\nthe soldiers of the First World War, marching to their death.\n\nThey are the sacrificial victims of modernisation and of war, not\n\nthe salvation for a decaying civilisation.\n\n5.3\n\nAvoiding Using Excessive Relative Pronouns\n\nIn the following example, The grief which they undergo at his\n\ndeath is magnified by their loss of income . . . , it is\n\npermitted to remove the relative pronoun, thus: The grief\n\nthey undergo at his death is magnified by their loss of\n\nincome. (Grammatically the clause remains a relative clause\n\nbut it has a zero relative pronoun.) Whilst in simple sentences\n\nthis economy produces a small gain, in more complex sentences the\n\nimproved digestion of the sense is more noticeable: for example,\n\nThe consequences for his daughters lives reads better\n\nthan The consequences which this has on his daughters\n\nlives.\n\n5.40\n\nImproving Flow\n\n5.41\n\nKeep the Structure Clear\n\nThe following is needlessly jumbled:\n\nIt could be argued that Edmund is symptomatic of the Oedipal\n\ndesires, as cited by Freud, in his quest to avenge his father’s\n\nadultery . . .\n\nThis could be revised thus:\n\nIt could be argued that Edmund’s quest to avenge his father’s\n\nadultery is symptomatic of the Oedipus complex as described by\n\nFreud\n\nGenerally it is best to keep the main parts of the main clause as\n\nclose together as possible. For example, keep subjects and verbs\n\nclose together. Compare\n\nThe legal status of women in the eighteenth and nineteenth\n\ncenturies was little better than that of slaves.\n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the legal status\n\nof women was little better than that of slaves.\n\n5.42\n\nParsing Your Thoughts; Using Logical\n\nExpressions\n\nTo parse is to assign constituent structure to a sentence or the\n\nwords in a sentence. In the following there are two\n\nthoughts compressed together: The book is a commodity in that\n\nto buy the book is to purchase the illusive Moll Flanders\n\nherself. There are two problems here. Firstly, the writer\n\nshould say illusory not illusive (a confusion\n\nwith elusive); secondly the writer’s use of in\n\nthat has the effect of joining two similar but different\n\nthoughts: a) all printed books are commodities, b) the ‘Moll\n\nFlanders’ offered in the book is also a commodity, a virtual\n\nobject which the consumer buys the book to get. These thoughts\n\nneed parsing out, not forcing together, since the book would\n\nstill be a commodity even if it were an atlas selling useful\n\ninformation about the world. Saying in that tends allows\n\nthe writer to avoid the larger implications of this thoughts.\n\nWhilst brevity is the soul of wit, it is also essential to have\n\nenough sentences, properly articulated, to bring out the full\n\ncomplexity of one’s understanding.\n\nHere’s an example of a similar error: The themes expressed in\n\n‘Othello’ allow sexual anxieties to develop. The\n\nthemes do not allow anything to develop; the\n\nthemes might involve the development of sexual anxieties; or\n\nsexual anxiety might be said to be one of the themes.\n\n5.43\n\nAvoid Recapitulation\n\nOne sentence must clearly relate to another in order that\n\nmutually they can make sense. Indeed it is worth thinking about\n\nlanguage in terms of gestalt psychology: the sum of the\n\nwhole is always more than the sum of its parts. (If you prefer a\n\nless scholarly model, then consider a house: the house is a lot\n\nmore than a pile of timber, sand, cement and bricks.) Paratactic\n\nsentences (‘one damn thing after another’) are simple ways of\n\nbuilding gestalt effects; hypotactic sentences (using\n\nco-ordination and subordination) are evolved ways of building\n\neffects. Recapitulating a former sentence inside of a later\n\nsentence is a fairly poor way of building such effects:\n\nAda seems to attach sexual desire to the piano. The first time we see Ada play the piano it is in the middle of the night. She is interrupted by a disapproving woman and Ada stops playing abruptly. It is as if she was doing something very private, for example performing a sexual act. The piano is constantly seen as an object of desire. Baines employs a piano tuner to tune it before Ada visits to give him a lesson. The piano tuner admires the piano tuner as beautiful and unusual, like Ada. He sniffs it in an intimate fashion as if he can smell perfume on it. All these factors promote the piano as a sexual object. The way Baines and Ada touch it also shows its sexual presence. For example, Baines walks around it naked and wipes dust off it with his underwear. Ada’s tiny fingers constantly caress the strong substantial keys of the piano. When Ada plays the piano her body language implies the reaches an almost physical ecstasy from rhythmically playing the keys.\n\nThere are thirteen sentences here, ten of which mention the piano and eight of which mention Ada. The ideas are interesting, but the style is tiring, probably because the writer lacks confidence about syntactic structure. It could have been done like this:\n\nAda seems to attach sexual desire to the piano. The first time we see her play it is in the middle of the night when she is interrupted by a disapproving woman and stops playing abruptly, as if she was doing something very private, for exampleperforming a sexual act. The piano is constantly seen as an object of desire. The piano tuner sniffs it intimately, as if it were a woman. Baines walks around it naked and wipes dust off it with his underwear. Ada’s tiny fingers caress the keys sensuously as she plays and she seems almost to reach physical ecstasy.\n\nSix sentences, six mentions of the piano and three mentions of Ada.\n\nENGLISH LIT.\n\nEnglish style guide\n\nThe English language\n\nBooker / “Nobel” / Pulitzer\n\nElizabethan era / “Love letters”\n\n“Definitive List of Literary Works”\n\nFrench in English / Latin in English\n\nAnthology / Chronology / Terminology\n\nPhrases & idioms with their etymologies\n\nLiterary criticism: analysing poetry & prose\n\nGlossary of works, writers and literary devices:\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\n📙 Books 📕 Poets 📗 Thinkers 📘 Writers\n\nREADING LISTS ETC.\n\nWRITERS\n\nAtwood, Margaret\n\nAusten, Jane\n\nBrontë sisters\n\nBurton, Sir Richard\n\nChaucer, Geoffrey\n\nConrad, Joseph\n\nCurtis, Adam\n\nde Cervantes, Miguel\n\nDickens, Charles\n\nDostoevsky, Fyodor\n\nFaulkner, William\n\nForster, E.
