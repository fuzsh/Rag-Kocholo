        "text": "DJ retains complete ownership of the Program, including all rights to the music and visuals created. However, DJ grants Roy Webb Productions exclusive rights to exhibit the Program in cinema theaters worldwide as part of Roy Webb Productions' 90-minute productions, as long as payments are made as stated in this Agreement, even after termination.\n\nRoy Webb Productions agrees to compensate DJ each time the Program is incorporated into a 90-minute production and exhibited in any theater worldwide. Compensation details will be agreed upon separately and outlined in a schedule attached to this Agreement.\n\nDJ has the creative freedom to design the visuals and concept for the Program in collaboration with visual artists. DJ can utilize AI technology such as OpenAI's Sora, DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, along with various other technologies available over the internet, to aid in this process. DJ must ensure that all copyrights for the complete Program are secured and will be fully responsible for settling any disputes related to the content. If DJ opts to have Roy Webb Productions create the visuals for his music, then all rights to those visuals will remain with Roy Webb Productions.\n\nDJ will receive appropriate billing in all promotional materials and during live events where the Program is featured. The exact billing format (e.g., name placement, size, visibility) will be determined by Roy Webb Productions; however, the DJ and his visual artist(s) will be well featured. DJ may provide a list of visual artists to be included in the billing.\n\nDJ warrants that the Program submitted to Roy Webb Productions does not infringe upon any copyrights or intellectual property rights of any third party. DJ retains full responsibility for securing all copyrights related to the Program and agrees to indemnify and hold Roy Webb Productions harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from any copyright infringement or other intellectual property disputes related to the submitted Program.\n\nBoth parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary information and trade secrets related to the Program and the terms of this Agreement. This confidentiality obligation will survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\nDJ agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Roy Webb Productions and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any breach of this Agreement by DJ or from any claims of infringement related to the Program.\n\nNeither party shall be liable for any failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if such failure results from circumstances beyond the party's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, labor disputes, or governmental actions.\n\nThis Agreement shall commence on the effective date and continue until terminated by either party with 180 days' written notice. Termination shall not affect rights accrued before termination. Roy Webb Productions retains the right to exhibit the Program as long as payments are made as stated in this Agreement, even after termination."
