A Memorial Gathering to Celebrate Roy's Life will be from 6 to 8pm, Friday evening, June 8th at the Alden-Harrington Funeral Home in Bonner Springs, KS. Roy was born on April 22, 1953 in Kansas City, Kansas to Lloyd and Martha Webb. Roy was always proud to tell you he had 12 years of perfect school attendance. He farmed with his folks for many years and had also worked at Schutte Lumberyard until his mother got sick and he quit to take care of her. He was a great caregiver. Roy loved his friends and helping them was his greatest pleasure in life. It was about them, not about him. He chose to live a different life than others, but seemed happy. Thank you to all of you that were his friends and had showed him kindness and special love. Roy was preceded in death by his parents Lloyd and Martha and is survived by his sister Betty Webb of Springfield, Ill as well as many wonderful friends that will miss him greatly.   Interment of Cremated Remains to be 10:30am Tuesday, Sept. 4th in the Glenwood Cemetery.",
