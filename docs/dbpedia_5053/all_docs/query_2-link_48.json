        "text": "This is a look at old and new Redditch, Worcestershire, through the letters, poetry, reminiscences and musings of the late Roy Webb, edited by his sister Tina Webb-Moore. Through Roy’s affinity for nature and eloquent use of language comes one man’s love of his local area and his concern about the changes brought about by the Redditch Development Corporation in the 1960s. Anyone familiar with the area will recognise the local characters, beauty spots, sights and sounds and identify with Redditch’s transition from an unassuming quiet and green neighbourhood to a modern new town. The work of conservationists in England’s Redditch-Worcestershire area is included together with considerable detail about the work of the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB)."
