        "text": "Roy Webb\n\nRoy Webb was born in New York City on October 3, 1888, and while he was a student at Columbia University he composed their fight song, “Roar, Lion, Roar.” He enlisted in the Navy for WWI, and was attending officers’ school when armistice was signed. In New York, Webb was a musical director and arranger of musicals, including those of Rodgers and Hart. He had already worked on many films before he received his first screen credit in 1933. Webb spent almost his entire film career working for RKO, from the early thirties until the mid-fifties, although he often wrote on his piano at his Westwood home. The composer liked automobiles and golf, and spent some of his summers at Nantucket Island off Cape Cod. He was a charter member and treasurer of the Screen Composer’s Association and was a co-founder of ASCAP."
