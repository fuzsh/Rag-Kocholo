Quite often, people use short versions of their name (i.e. Jeff vs. Jeffery), sometimes they use their name’s international variations (Paul/Pavlos). It is quite rare but still happens that a person can be found being listed under a completely different name.\n\nAlter Name Full NamePersons Count ?Share ?
