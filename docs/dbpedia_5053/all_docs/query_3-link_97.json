Many of the Gazetteers include the distance from a community such as Roy Webb to various places of note, such as the White House.\n\nWith a nod to our favorite Gazetteers, the straight-line distance<2> beginning in Roy Webb and extending to:\n\nAnniston, which is the Seat of Calhoun County, lies 18 miles [29 km]<2> to the south southwest. If you could walk a straight line from Roy Webb to Anniston, with an average speed<3> of 2.2 miles [3.5 km] per hour, it would take just over a day to make the trip. A horse and buggy averaging 3.2 miles [5.1 km] per hour would take five to six hours.\n\nMontgomery, which is the State Capital of Alabama, lies 111 miles [178.6 km] to the south southwest (SSW). Driving, with an average speed of 63 miles [101.4 km] per hour, would take about two hours, a buggy would take 5 days and walking would take 7 days.\n\nThe White House (Washington, DC) is 592 miles [952.7 km] to the northeast (NE). Driving would take just over a day, a buggy would take 24 days and walking would take 34 days.\n\nThe shortest distance<4> to Jerusalem (specifically the Temple Mount and the Dome of the Rock) is 6,487 miles [10,439.8 km] and it lies to the northeast (NE).<5>\n\nThe distance to the Great Mosque of Mecca (specifically the Ka'bah - or Kaaba ) is 7,195 miles [11,579.2 km] and it lies to the northeast (NE).<6>\n\nThe distance to Saint Peter's Basilica (The Vatican) is 5,071 miles [8,161 km] and it lies to the northeast (NE).<7>\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know of a website for Roy Webb. If you can help, please contact us through our Feedback Page.\n\nThe official website for Calhoun County: www.calhouncounty.org/\n\nThe official website for State of Alabama: https://www.alabama.gov/\n\nFootnotes ...\n\n<1>The location has been supplied by the Geographic Names Information System - which is maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). While these values should be definitive, we found that accuracy can vary and you should double-check the location if accuracy is required. <2>Our distances are not driving distances, but are calculated as a 'straight-line' (or point-to-point) distance. A straight line distance ignores things like rivers, canyons, lakes, et cetera - it's truly a line from Point A (ie- Roy Webb) to Point B. Our distance measurements begin at a specific point in Roy Webb. The point we use is located at these GPS coordinates - Latitude: 33.9204, Longitude: -85.7272 In this case, the coordinates for Roy Webb have been provided by the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). <3>While we have tried to pick reasonable speeds, the rate of travel is very theoretical - obstacles like fences, hills, lakes, river crossings and rest stops have been ignored. When we say 'Days' of travel, we're assuming 8 hours of travel per day. <4>The shortest line can be visualized by stretching a string on a Globe from Point A to Point B - this is known as a Great Circle Route. Where you might expect the shortest route from Roy Webb to the Middle East to be East and South, the Great Circle Route actually lies to the North and East. <5>The calculated bearing (or angle) to Jerusalem is 313.055 degrees. <6>The calculated bearing (or angle) to Mecca is 308.625 degrees. <7>The calculated bearing (or angle) to the Vatican is 309.777 degrees."
