Barry Cardiff graduated with a BEng from the Department of Electronic Engineering in UCD in 1992 and an MEngSc (by research) thereafter. In 2011 he obtained a PhD, as a mature student, in the field of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for wireless and optical communications.

Dr Cardiff worked for as a design engineer for Nokia Mobile Phone (UK) Ltd from 1993 to 2001 working on some of world’s more advanced and innovative products culminating in the role of Chief Engineer and as a contributor to the 3GPP standardization process.

He continued to work for S3 group for several years after a break between 2007-2011 to obtain a PhD from UCD under Prof. Tony Fagan with a thesis entitled “Detection Techniques in Vector Systems in Communications”.

In September 2013 he joined the academic staff in UCD to complement the teaching staff both in Dublin and in a joint collaboration in Beijing (BDIC).

His research interests are in the area of DSP applications mainly in communication systems both in the theoretical analysis and practical advancement of such systems. The area of power/complexity reduction techniques in circuit design, i.e. DSP algorithms for digitally assisted analog circuits, is also of current interest.
