        "text": "From supply chain to value chain\n\nKNAPP is a partner to industry and ensures its customers long-term success. The keys to success are flexible and scalable logistical concepts that can grow with the demands.\n\nThe zero-defect philosophy is state-of-the-art and combines quality with efficiency and economy. Smart assistance systems raise service to a new level; intuitive man and machine communication brings high-tech to the warehouse.\n\nA value chain emerges from the supply chain thanks to new technologies and flexible processes. Interconnected systems turn logistics specialists into value providers.\n\nKNAPP acquires shares in the KHT Apostore Group. KHT Apostore is a specialist in pharmacy autopickers and measurement devices. With this, KNAPP completes its portfolio and offers solutions for the entire pharmaceutical supply chain.\n\nInnovations in shuttles, software, work stations and tailor-made services open up a new dimension in intralogistics.\n\nThe company specializes in all-in-one solutions and comprehensive service. At the same time, KNAPP lives out its slogan, making complexity simple.\n\nThe new Corporate Headquarters and Development Centre is opened. The systematic expansion of the subsidiaries follows over the following years.\n\nKNAPP acquires Dürkopp Fördertechnik, headquartered in Bielefeld, and strengthens its presence in the fashion sector.\n\nForging new paths\n\n2002 welcomes the 1000th employee. 2009 sees the number of employees rise to 1,605.\n\nIn 2002, the first OSR Shuttle™ starts operation at Richter Pharma in Wels. With the OSR Shuttle™, KNAPP unleashes an evolution in intralogistics.\n\n2007 witnesses the founding of KNAPP AG. The company strategically aims for continued growth.\n\n2008 has KNAPP acquiring the Scandinavian specialist for pallet conveyor systems, MOVING AB (today KNAPP AB).\n\nGrowth and progress\n\nKNAPP builds up its competence in software and control systems.\n\nAt the end of the 90s, KNAPP acquires the software companies Syslog and Logim.\n\nIn the 90s, the first subsidiary is established in Italy.\n\n1995 KNAPP acquires the company ATIS, today KNAPP Systemintegration in Leoben.\n\nThe first order from the USA opens the way for overseas markets. KNAPP continues to build up its presence in North and South America. Within a few years the number of employees grows to 650.\n\nSoftware rounds off the service portfolio\n\nIn the early 1980s, Günter Knapp decided to supply and integrate software in addition to mechanics, electrical components and hardware.\n\nKNAPP expands into new markets and supplies customers from all over Europe. The company acquires the Hart bei Graz location, today headquarters of the KNAPP group.\n\nThe time is right for the autopickers. Günter Knapp finally dusts off his idea. With it, he revolutionizes order fulfilment in pharmaceutical wholesaling. Microprocessors act as the control system.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the company has 105 employees.\n\nMoving\n\nThe company primarily builds lifts, lifting systems and belt conveyors, for pharmaceutical wholesaler Herba Chemosan, for example. They are still a KNAPP customer to this day.\n\nHis inventive genius drives Günter Knapp forward. His vision: an automated picking machine for pharmaceutical wholesale. The market is not yet ready for this idea.\n\nWhy pharma in particular?\n\nIng. Günter Knapp recognizes the growing need for a fast supply of medicines and the potential for automated handling of medicine cartons."
