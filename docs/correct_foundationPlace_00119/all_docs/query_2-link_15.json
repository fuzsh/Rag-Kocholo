        "text": "DUBLIN & SAN JOSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--S3 Group, a global independent supplier of Mixed-Signal IP and tailored silicon solutions to semiconductor vendors, OEMs and service operators, today announced that Geo Semiconductor Inc. has selected Data Converter IP from its family of Video Digital to Analogue Converters (DAC), to be used in their next generation of video processing IC’s. GEO Semiconductor is an industry leader in high performance Camera Video Processing (CVP) IC solutions aimed at real-time video, camera, and geometry processing.\n\nS3 Group’s family of video converters, utilize its leading high-speed current steering DAC architecture that provides optimal non-spurious image conversion, specifically tailored for video and graphics applications that arise across the consumer, IoT and industrial markets. Sampling at 300MS/s, one of these 10-bit converters provides less than 0.5LSB of DNL and less than 2LSB of INL. Engineered for minimal glitch energy and ultra-low distortion, these DACs provide optimized dynamic performance for video/graphic applications, exhibiting greater than 51dBc SFDR over the target input range.\n\n“GEO Semiconductor’s decision to select from S3 Group’s Video Converter family was based on their IP performance, integration flexibility and industry recognized quality delivery. In addition, their application and integration knowledge greatly complemented the system specification and chip implementation phases” said Sudhir Chandratreya, VP Engineering of GEO Semiconductor.\n\n“Over the past year we have focused S3 Group’s Mixed-Signal IP developments on end applications. This has led us to provide optimized application specific IP for sensing, communicating and imaging. In addition, with the understanding that ‘one size does not fit all’ in the Mixed-Signal world, our flexibility in IP integration has given GEO Semiconductor precisely what they need, when they need it” said Darren Hobbs, Director of Product Management Semiconductor Solutions at S3 Group.\n\nAbout S3 Group:\n\nS3 Group delivers RF and Mixed Signal IP and tailored Silicon Solutions to Semiconductor companies , OEMs and Service Operators. The company is one of the longest serving independent silicon design service providers in the industry and has built a wealth of experience and engineering expertise as well as an enviable delivery track record over more than 25 years. S3 Group provides a comprehensive portfolio of RF and mixed-signal IP, in addition to IC design services. The IP portfolio includes high performance ADC and DAC converters, PLLs, Analog Front Ends (AFEs), Power Management, RF Transceivers and other miscellaneous circuits which have been silicon proven at a variety of foundries (including TSMC, Global Foundries, SMIC and UMC amongst others) at nodes ranging from 180nm to 28nm. Global end markets served by S3 Group clients include Consumer Mobility, Consumer, Satellite Communications, Communications Infrastructure, Automotive, and Industrial. Founded in 1986, S3 Group, headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, has development centres in Ireland, Poland, the Czech Republic and Portugal with sales offices and representatives worldwide.\n\nFor further information please visit www.s3group.com/semiconductor-solutions and www.twitter.com/S3Group_Silicon\n\nAbout GEO Semiconductor\n\nGEO Semiconductor (GEO) is an industry leader in delivering programmable camera video processors to the rapidly growing consumer and automotive camera markets.
