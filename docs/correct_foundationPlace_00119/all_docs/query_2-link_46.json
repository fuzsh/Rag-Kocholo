The consistent pursuit of market-leading innovation, quality and customer service, backed by investment in our people and processes, underpins everything we do.\n\nWe remain focused on continuous improvement in all aspects of our business to deliver long-term, sustainable success for our stakeholders.\n\nArdagh operates 61 metal and glass production facilities in 16 countries, employing approximately 20,000 people with sales of approximately $9.4bn.\n\nArdagh Metal Packaging (AMP), 76%-owned by Ardagh Group is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nArdagh Group also holds a 42% interest in Trivium Packaging, a leading supplier of sustainable metal packaging to the food & specialty and personal care markets.\n\nArdagh is pleased to announce that its acquisition of Consol Holdings Proprietary Limited, the leading\n\nproducer of glass packaging on the African continent, has completed.\n\nThe people at Ardagh share much more than a strong brand and an excellent reputation. We each share a common Purpose – We make packaging for good. Our Purpose defines who we are as a company and forms the foundation of our business. Our Purpose enables us to deliver customer innovation, provides an inspirational environment for our people and drive our business through growth and development.\n\nThe future we’re creating for Ardagh is built around our four Core Values of Inclusion, Trust, Teamwork and Excellence. We are committed to conducting our activities with the highest standards of integrity and business practice in dealing with all of our stakeholders. Our Code of Conduct is a guide for conducting our business in an honest and professional manner.\n\nGlass packaging protects its content and enhances a brand’s appeal. As a permanent material glass is 100% and infinitely recyclable, making it the perfect packaging choice for products today and in the future. Ardagh produces distinctive and innovative glass packaging in all shapes and sizes for the world’s leading brands and offers a choice of almost 20 different colours.\n\nBeing infinitely recyclable, a glass bottle or jar can be made into a new one over and over again, with no loss in quality or purity. Making new glass bottles and jars from recycled glass reduces the amount of energy needed in the production process and lowers emissions into the atmosphere."
