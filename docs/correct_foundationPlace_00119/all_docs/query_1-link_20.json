        "text": "We develop and manufacture intelligent warehouse systems using the latest solutions in digitalization, software, automation and robotics. Our company founder Günter Knapp was a visionary inventor, and this remains part of our corporate culture today. His ideas, which solved many of the problems faced by businesses in the fifties, are also still with us. Günter Knapp started the business in Graz in 1952, with just two employees. Since then, the company has grown to become an international group of 7,700 employees with 49 locations all over the world.\n\nWith our innovative technologies, we offer everything that companies need for efficient warehouse automation – all from a single source. Despite our size and international orientation, we are still a family-owned business at heart and are proud of our positive corporate culture. Each and every one of us has a different background, qualification and point of view – and that’s a good thing. We place great value on diversity and that is what makes us successful. What unites us is the passion we feel for our daily work: our KNAPP spirit.\n\nTo be successful, we need innovators and progressive thinkers, shapers of the future and sharp minds. Are you a good fit for our corporate culture? Then get to know the various areas we work in and the different types of career paths at KNAPP.\n\nWe look forward to receiving your application!"
