A major focus of the group is using Black Hole Perturbation Theory to model small mass ratio binaries. These are key sources for the forthcoming European Space Agencyâs (opens in a new window)LISA mission. The group are full members of the LISA consortium and are lead developers of the (opens in a new window)Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.\n\nPeople\n\n(opens in a new window)Dr Sarp Akcay\n\nResearch Interests: General relativity, gravitational wave astronomy, black hole perturbation theory, effective-one-body theory\n\nProf Adrian Ottewill\n\nResearch Interests: âGeneral relativity, Quantum field theory in curved space-time\n\n(opens in a new window)Dr Niels Warburton\n\nResearch Interests: Gravitational waves, black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals, intermediate mass ratio inspirals, general relativity, numerical modeling, geodesic motion in black hole spacetimes\n\nDr Barry Wardell\n\nResearch interests: General Relativity, Gravitational Waves, Black Holes, Cosmic Strings, High-performance Computing\n\nResearch Fellows\n\nChris Kavanagh\n\n(opens in a new window)Christiana Pantelidou\n\nMathematical Physics\n\nUCD has a long history of excellent research in Mathematical Physics conceived very broadly, including research in Geometry in Physics, the mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics, and Solid Mechanics. Current research in the school reflects this tradition, and includes research in Quantum Gravity, the mathematical foundations of Turbulence, and qualitative methods for Partial Differential Equations inspired by Physics.\n\nPeople\n\nAssoc Prof Miguel Bustamante\n\nResearch Interests: âFluid Dynamics and Turbulence, Nonlinear PDEs, Hamiltonian Methods and Integrable Systems\n\nDr Marius Ghergu\n\nResearch Interests: âPartial Differential Equations, Nonlinear Analysis, Potential Theory\n\nDr Rupert Levene\n\nResearch Interests: âFunctional Analysis, Operator Algebras, Operator Spaces, Quantum Information Theory, Matrix Analysis"
