This resulted in some impaired EC2 instances and degraded performance for some EBS volumes in the affected Availability Zone. Power was restored at 3:22 pm PDT.[292] 2019 August 23 Outage A number of EC2 servers in the Tokyo region shut down due to overheating at 12:36 pm local time, due to a failure in the datacenter control and cooling system.[293] 2019 August 31 Outage and data loss The US-EAST-1 data center suffered a power failure at 4:33 am local time, and the backup generators failed at 6 am. According to AWS, this affected 7.5 percent of the EC2 instances in one of the ten data centers in one of the six Availability Zones in US-EAST-1. However, after restoring power, a number of EBS volumes, which store the filesystems of the EC2 cloud servers, were permanently unrecoverable. This caused downtime for companies such as Reddit.[294][295][296] 2019 October 22â€“23 Service degradation from DDoS AWS sustained a distributed denial of service attack which caused intermittent DNS resolution errors (for their Route 53 DNS service) from 10:30 am PST to 6:30 pm PST.[297] 2020 November 25 Outage Beginning at 9:52 am PST the Kinesis Data Streams API became impaired in the US-EAST-1 Region.
