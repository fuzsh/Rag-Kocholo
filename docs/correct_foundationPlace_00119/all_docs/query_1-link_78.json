        "text": "Lucinda Creighton\n\nQuestion:\n\n42. Deputy Lucinda Creighton asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 19 November 2013, the names of companies since March 2011 where Enterprise Ireland has provided information on contracts won during trade missions as appropriate; the reason the names of companies who accompany him on Enterprise Ireland events could be considered commercially sensitive information; if Enterprise Ireland have sought legal advice to that effect; if he will confirm whether Enterprise Ireland would seek to refuse providing this information through a freedom of information request on the grounds of commercial sensitivity; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [51733/13]\n\nView answer\n\nAs the Deputy will be aware, Enterprise Ireland is the Government agency responsible for the development and internationalisation of Irish enterprises. Each year, Enterprise Ireland organises a series of targeted, international, Ministerial-led trade missions. The participation by Irish companies in those missions is organised by Enterprise Ireland. I am informed that Enterprise Ireland takes the view that, while there may be press activity around a particular trade mission, it is generally for participating companies to disclose their interest in particular markets and not a matter for Government or its agencies. Matters of commercial sensitivity can also be a factor, as I indicated in my reply to Question No 129 of 19 November. On this basis and in light of advice from Enterprise Ireland concerning the above question, details of specific company participation were not released at that time. However, following further consideration of the matter by Enterprise Ireland, it has been decided, in this instance, to release the names of the participating companies. Enterprise Ireland has provided the attached list of participating companies.\n\nTrade Mission to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia & the State of Qatar, 16–20 October 2011\n\nLed by Ms. Jan O’Sullivan, T.D.
