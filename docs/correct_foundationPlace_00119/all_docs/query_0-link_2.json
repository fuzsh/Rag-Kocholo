        "text": "CONNECT is the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Future Networks and Communications. Its mission is to research and develop innovative solutions for the communications challenges facing society today. The Internet of Things, 5G/6G networks and future communications services are the Centre’s main areas of focus.\n\nOver 300 CONNECT researchers across 10 Higher Education Institutes are supported by €90 million of funding from the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centres Programme, the European Regional Development Fund and industry partners.\n\nCONNECT also leads the ENABLE Spoke research programme which investigates ways of connecting communities to smart urban environments through the Internet of Things.\n\nResearch Areas\n\nCONNECT focuses on six research themes looking to the next generation of networks:\n\nDependable Networks: Low-latency services, such as Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and Mixed Reality (MR), leveraged by edge computing, and exploiting recent advances in data analytics for the design and operation of dependable networks.\n\nSustainable IoT: Scalable integrated energy harvesting, storage, and power management, for sustainable IoT edge networks. Low-power IoT platforms based on reconfigurable, software-defined sensing, computation, and communications to support long-term network operation. New security and resiliency mechanisms.\n\nLink Performance: Multi-Gbps wireless and wireline data transmission, flexible mmWave communications, enabled through converged photonic networking. Signal processing operations for multi-dimensional data structures. Molecular communications and interfaces for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things.\n\nCustomised Networks: Virtualisation and dynamic resource sharing, resource characterisation, provisioning, and isolation. Monitoring customised networks. Embedded trust and security mechanisms.\n\nData-driven Optimisation and Management: Predictive power of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to effect configuration changes before adverse conditions arise. Metrics of users’ experience of network. Apply in distributed, resource-constrained contexts.\n\nThe New Operators: Intelligent dynamic management and provision of network slices across a combination of independent radio access networks. Recommendations on a policy and regulatory environment and financial framework for new operators.\n\nCONNECT researchers have vast expertise in test and experimentation in these areas."
