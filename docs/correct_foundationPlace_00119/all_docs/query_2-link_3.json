        "text": "Amazon cloud computing resources are hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These locations are composed of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones. Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area. Each AWS Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.\n\nBy using Local Zones, you can place resources, such as compute and storage, in multiple locations closer to your users. Amazon RDS enables you to place resources, such as DB instances, and data in multiple locations. Resources aren't replicated across AWS Regions unless you do so specifically.\n\nAmazon operates state-of-the-art, highly-available data centers. Although rare, failures can occur that affect the availability of DB instances that are in the same location. If you host all your DB instances in one location that is affected by such a failure, none of your DB instances will be available.\n\nIt is important to remember that each AWS Region is completely independent. Any Amazon RDS activity you initiate (for example, creating database instances or listing available database instances) runs only in your current default AWS Region. The default AWS Region can be changed in the console, or by setting the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variable. Or it can be overridden by using the --region parameter with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). For more information, see Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface, specifically the sections about environment variables and command line options.\n\nAmazon RDS supports special AWS Regions called AWS GovCloud (US). These are designed to allow US government agencies and customers to move more sensitive workloads into the cloud. The AWS GovCloud (US) Regions address the US government's specific regulatory and compliance requirements. For more information, see What is AWS GovCloud (US)?\n\nTo create or work with an Amazon RDS DB instance in a specific AWS Region, use the corresponding regional service endpoint.\n\nAWS Regions\n\nEach AWS Region is designed to be isolated from the other AWS Regions. This design achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability.\n\nWhen you view your resources, you see only the resources that are tied to the AWS Region that you specified. This is because AWS Regions are isolated from each other, and we don't automatically replicate resources across AWS Regions.\n\nRegion availability\n\nThe following table shows the AWS Regions where Amazon RDS is currently available and the endpoint for each Region.\n\nIf you do not explicitly specify an endpoint, the US West (Oregon) endpoint is the default.\n\nWhen you work with a DB instance using the AWS CLI or API operations, make sure that you specify its regional endpoint.\n\nAvailability Zones\n\nWhen you create a DB instance, you can choose an Availability Zone or have Amazon RDS choose one for you randomly. An Availability Zone is represented by an AWS Region code followed by a letter identifier (for example, us-east-1a).\n\nUse the describe-availability-zones Amazon EC2 command as follows to describe the Availability Zones within the specified Region that are enabled for your account.\n\naws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region region-name\n\nFor example, to describe the Availability Zones within the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1) that are enabled for your account, run the following command:\n\naws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region us-east-1\n\nYou can't choose the Availability Zones for the primary and secondary DB instances in a Multi-AZ DB deployment. Amazon RDS chooses them for you randomly. For more information about Multi-AZ deployments, see Configuring and managing a Multi-AZ deployment.\n\nLocal Zones\n\nA Local Zone is an extension of an AWS Region that is geographically close to your users. You can extend any VPC from the parent AWS Region into Local Zones. To do so, create a new subnet and assign it to the AWS Local Zone. When you create a subnet in a Local Zone, your VPC is extended to that Local Zone. The subnet in the Local Zone operates the same as other subnets in your VPC.\n\nWhen you create a DB instance, you can choose a subnet in a Local Zone. Local Zones have their own connections to the internet and support AWS Direct Connect. Thus, resources created in a Local Zone can serve local users with very low-latency communications. For more information, see AWS Local Zones."
