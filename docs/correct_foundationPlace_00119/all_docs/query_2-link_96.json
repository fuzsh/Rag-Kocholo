        "text": "1 min read, last updated on 2021-12-20\n\nIntroduction\n\nHow many major outages AWS had in the past? ð¤\n\nSuch a question hit me in 2017 when Amazon S3 had one of the worst outages in cloud history.\n\nSo I decided to prepare content about that. The idea appeared in 2017, and yet, we need to have another big one in us-east-1 again, more than 3 years later, to force me to dust off the topic. So I have refurbished the notes I have prepared back then and prepared a timeline.\n\nIt turned out it was an exciting journey, and I am sharing those results with you down below. I am doing that hoping that it wonât jinx anything. ð Letâs go then!\n\nResources\n\ndanluu/post-mortems: this is a great source, I strongly recommend it!\n\nItâs so great because itâs not only about AWS.\n\nAWS Post-Event Summaries\n\nMy spreadsheet, that I have used below.\n\nTimeline\n\nSummary\n\nMy goal was to collect all the most critical outages of AWS cloud that happened over the years. However, did I collect every single one? I doubt it, so I encourage you in the comments to remind me which one I have missed! ð¯\n\nAlso, I would love to hear horror stories that were the most painful for you personally - I intuitively feel that those most recent, related to Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams will be at the top. But who knows? Maybe I am wrong? Share yours in the comments below."
