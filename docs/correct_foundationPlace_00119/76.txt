Irish technology and communications company S3 Group has sold its S3 TV technology side of the business to Accenture to bolster the latter’s Digital Video Services division.

The buyout of this portion of S3’s business – S3 TV Technology – will see Accenture use the Irish-developed technology in its business, but it has not revealed the financial terms of the deal.

According to Accenture’s announcement on the deal, the company will integrate S3’s StormTest automated testing platform and video consulting capabilities with the software and solutions of Accenture Digital Video Services, part of Accenture’s Communications, Media and Technology group.

With this addition, Accenture said it will help video service providers create and evolve high-quality content through broadband and broadcast networks, as well as non-linear services such as catch-up TV and video on demand (VOD) through broadband networks.

Keeping competitive

Founded in 1986 with its headquarters in south Dublin, S3 made headlines last year after it announced it had created the world’s smallest analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) chip for use in Wi-Fi and LTE-connected devices.

Its TV Technology division has for some time been working with major TV network providers and VOD services such as Liberty Global, BT and Sky to manage the readiness of their platforms in the face of stiff competition.

“In the volatile new media and entertainment ecosystem, one thing is unchanged – consumers will keep demanding more from their screens of choice,” said Francesco Venturini, Accenture Digital Video Services lead.

“S3 TV Technology’s test automation solution, live event monitoring, video technology consulting capabilities and systems integration experience… will create an end-to-end platform that will help video service providers use cutting-edge technology to stay competitive by delivering more innovative features to customers.”
