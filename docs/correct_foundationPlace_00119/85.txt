Dublin technology company S3 has been selected to support the software that will feature in consumer electronic devices like set-top boxes that will emerge from a new joint venture forged by US media giants Time Warner Cable and Comcast Cable called RDK Management.

The appointment of both S3 Group and ITAAS will support the development of the reference design kit (RDK) that will power IP or hybrid set-top boxes and gateway devices for consumer electronics manufacturers and chip manufacturers.

Leopardstown-based S3, which originated as a spin-out of electronics giant Philips, employs 250 people worldwide and has annual revenues of around €22m.

S3 has been selected for the role of code management in implementing the RDK vision of continuous improvement through community contribution.

“With S3 Group and ITAAS, we have engaged independent third parties with respected expertise to provide the necessary community support structure to the RDK community,” said Steve Heeb, president and general manager of RDK Management LLC.

“S3 Group and ITAAS come to the RDK with strong backgrounds in key areas, including code management, release management, support and training. Our licencees will be able to rely on the crucial skills and resources S3 Group and ITAAS offer as they implement the RDK into their products and services,” Heeb said.
