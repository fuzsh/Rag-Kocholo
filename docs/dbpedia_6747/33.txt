Pope Alexander VI, born Rodrigo Borgia, ascended to the papacy in 1492 and left a complex legacy. His tenure saw efforts to combat crime in Rome, patronage of the arts, and significant influence on the Age of Exploration with the 'Inter Caetera' bull. Despite attempts at Church reform, his reign was tainted by scandals such as nepotism and the Banquet of Chestnuts. His mysterious death in 1503 preceded the election of Julius II.
