        "text": "All articles\n\npainting\n\nTitiaan\n\nJacopo had recaptured the island of Santa Maura in 1502 from the Turks, thereby earning his place in heaven. Pesaro, a bishop and the commander of the papal fleet, kneels before St Peter following his victory. Pope Alexander VI stands behind him, blessing the hero. The composition of the canvas was designed by Giovanni Bellini, the most important artist in Venice at the time. Titian was responsible for its further execution. Noteworthy features include the typically Venetian colours and the brilliant technique. This is a very early Titian, yet it remains typical of the style and working method of the emerging genius."
