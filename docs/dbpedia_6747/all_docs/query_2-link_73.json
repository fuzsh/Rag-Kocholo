        "text": "Alexander Pope was a celebrated English writer from the 18th century, known for his excellent poetry, translations, and satires. He came from humble beginnings and undertook a successful journey to becoming one of the most influential English poets of his time. The poetical works of Alexander Pope were mainly centered around satirical commentaries of society through the depiction of characters.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAlexander Pope was born in London, England, in May of 1688. His parents were Edith and Alexander Pope. They were both Catholic, and his father made a successful living as a linen merchant. As a young boy, Pope was taught to read by his aunt and then attended Twyford School from about 1698 to 1699. His education was stymied by what then was the recently passed Test Acts. These laws banned Catholics from teaching or attending university. He attended two more schools in London before Pope’s formal education came to an end.\n\nIllness\n\nFrom a young age, Pope suffered from a number of health problems. These would plague him throughout his life and would include respiratory issues, high fevers, and abdominal pain. It is thought that Pott’s disease, which he contracted as a child, stunted his growth. He stopped growing at 4ft 6in. These facts, in addition to his identity as Catholic, mostly kept Pope out of the public sphere.\n\nWhen he was twelve, his parents moved to Binfield, Berkshire. They lived on an estate that was close to the royal Windsor Forest. This move from London was also the result of anti-Catholic sentiment. There was a statute that kept anyone of the faith from living within ten miles of London.\n\nDuring this period, Pope became interested in self-education and spent time reading the works of writers such as Homer and Virgil, as well as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Dryden. It was during this time that he became associated with other writers such as William Wycherley, William Walsh, and Henry Cromwell. He also dedicated himself to studying languages and was able to read in English, French, Latin, Greek, and Italian.\n\nLiterary Scene\n\nPope became known in and around the literary scene in London. He met William Wycherley and Samuel Garth and became close friends with John Caryll. It was in 1709 that Pope published ‘Pastorals.’ It was included in the sixth part of ‘Poetical Miscellanies’ and resulted in Pope being thrust into the spotlight in a way he had not been before.\n\nAlexander Pope’s poetry started to gain momentum. He followed this work with ‘An Essay on Criticism’ in 1711 which was also well received. It was in this same year that Pope formed the Scriblerus Club alongside fellow writers Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, and Thomas Parnell. It was around this time when he became friends with writers Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. It was the goal of the club to satirize what they saw as ignorance through the fictional Martinus Scriblerus.\n\nLiterary Successes\n\nIn 1712 Pope published what would become one of his most famous poems, ‘The Rape of the Lock.’ It was dedicated to his friend John Caryll. It is a mock epic, meaning that it satirizes the traditional epic form and all its particular structures. It tells the story of a quarrel between Arabella Fermor and Lord Petre, two stalwarts of society. The poem was republished two years later with an increased focus on one’s own quest to find an individual voice. It is said that this is the work that helped Pope secure his fame.\n\n‘Windsor-Forest’ a poem that had taken him several years to complete, was published in 1713. It focused on the rule of Queen Anne. This poem and those which preceded it were collected in Pope’s first volume, ‘Works,’ published in 1717. It was at this same time that Pope was hard at work on his verse translation of Homer, for which he would come to be well remembered. The first volume, which contained Homer’s ‘Iliad,’ Books I-IV, was published in 1715. It was finished in 1720 and was followed by ‘Odyssey’ in 1725 and 1726. This piece was created as a collaboration with William Broome and Elijah Fenton. These translations are noted today for the way they are able to convey accurately the spirit of the original text. He was also responsible for adaptations of the works of William Shakespeare, which allowed him to be self-sustaining financially. He then moved to Twickenham into a grand villa.\n\nIn the early 30s, Pope published the philosophical poem, ‘An Essay on Man.’ It was Pope’s intention that this piece becomes only part of a poetic system of ethics. The poem was written to challenge an anthropocentric, or human-centric, version of the world.\n\nLater Life and Death\n\nIn the later part of his life, Pope published eleven editions of the ‘Imitations of Horace.’ They included paraphrases of themes that had been altered to fit in with contemporary society. The pieces were popular from the first edition and spoke on the widespread corruption Pope was witnessing under George II. The last major work of his life was ‘The Dunciad,’ a narrative poem that celebrates the goddess Dulness and her companions: decay, imbecility, and tastelessness. The work is considered to be an attack on the Shakespearean editor Lewis Theobald.\n\nDuring the final years of Pope’s life, he wrote little. A few lines survive of a proposed epic titled ‘Brutus,’ but it was never finished. Alexander Pope died on May 30th, 1744, surrounded by friends, in his home."
