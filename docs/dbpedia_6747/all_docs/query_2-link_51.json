He is the third-most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. Only Shakespeare & Tennyson are quoted more often. [1] Some of his more well known or witty phrases include “Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed.”; “To err is human, to forgive, divine.”; “Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.” and “A little Learning is a dangerous Thing.”. [2]\n\nAlexander was the only son born to Alexander Pope (1646–1717) and Edith Turner (1643–1733), who were both Catholics. He is said to have been in born in Plough Court, London where his father was a merchant in the linen trade. [3] Alexander senior's business was doing well enough to provide the services of a wet nurse, Mary Beach, to look after the baby Alexander.[3] The house at Plough Court was Alexander's home for the first four or five years of his life until, under the impositions of the Ten Mile Rule, they were forced, as Catholics, to move further out of the City to Chiswick. At about the same time, Alexander was made one of the main beneficiaries in the will of his aunt and godmother Christiana Cooper. [4] By about 1700, the whole family had removed to Binfield in Berkshire. [5]\n\nPrior to the family's move to Berkshire, Pope's education was sporadic. He learned to read and write at home and spent some time at Catholic academies being taught Latin and Greek by the priests. [6] Then, at about the age of 12, he contracted Potts Disease, a form of tuberculosis that affected his spine. Because of this he only grew to a height of only 1.37 m (4 ft 6 in) tall and suffered from almost continual headaches for much of his life. [6] When his father died in 1717 Alexander was one of the major beneficiaries of his will.\n\nIn the spring of 1719, Alexander moved to Twickenham, leasing some property from Thomas Vernon of Twickenham Park. He took with him his elderly mother, his childhood nurse, Mary Beach and a hound named Bounce, the first of many so named! After demolishing an old cottage, Alexander set about building a fine Palladian style villa on the banks of the Thames. It was here that Alexander Pope, who became known as 'the wasp of Twickenham', wrote many of his great works - including The Dunciad, which ruthlessly satirised Colley Cibber who later became the Poet Laureate. [7]\n\nOne interesting feature of Pope's home in Twickenham was a grotto, built into the cellars. Seven years of translating Homer's Iliad brought him both money and a delight in classical mythology which found expression in the creation of the grotto. Complete by 1725, he wrote to his friend Edward Blount that, \"having found a spring of water it lacked nothing but nymphs.\" Towards the end of 1739 Pope visited the Hotwell Spa on the banks of the Avon at Bristol. He was very interested in the geology and colours present in the gorge and resolved to redesign his grotto as a museum of mineralogy and mining. He began to gather samples from far and wide which he had installed in his grotto. [8] This grotto is the last remaining part of his villa and is now under the protection of the Pope's Grotto Preservation Trust. Their project will involve the careful cleaning and re-fixing of the minerals that line the grotto and the installation of an appropriate lighting scheme to evoke the days when candlelight sparkled on mirrors and stones. An uncovered area of floor and part of the spring that previously ran through the grotto will be visible behind a glass viewing panel. In a parallel project the Grotto’s statuary and carved elements, some of them dating to the 19th century, will be conserved.[9]\n\nAlthough he never married, he had many female friends to whom he wrote witty letters. Allegedly, his lifelong friend Martha Blount was his lover.\n\nHe died on 30 May 1744, nine days after his 56th birthday, of acute asthma and dropsy [6] and was buried on the 5 June 1744 in the nave of the church of St Mary at Twickenham beside his mother. [10]He is commemorated there with a plaque, erected by his friend William Warburton, that reads For one who would not be buried in Westminster Abbey: Heroes and Kings your distance keep, In peace let one poor poet sleep. Who never flatter'd folk lie you, Let Horace blush and Virgil too.[11]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Wikipedia contributors, \"Alexander Pope,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, Wikipedia (accessed December 11, 2019).\n\n↑ Good Reads Pope Quotes\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Rogers, Pat A Political Biography of Alexander Pope Routledge, 6 Oct 2015 pg Google Books\n\n↑ Rumbold Valerie Women's Place in Pope's World Cambridge University Press, 29 Sep 1989 pg 24 Google Books\n\n↑ Felicity Rosslyn, Alexander Pope: A Literary Life Springer, 27 Jul 2016 Google Books\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 Gale, Cengage Learning A study guide for Alexander Pope's \"The Rape of the Lock\" Gale, Cengage Learning , 13 Mar 2015 Google Books\n\n↑ Poet's Graves [1]\n\n↑ Alexander Pope, The Twickenham Museum Twickenham Museum\n\n↑ Pope's Grotto Preservation Trust Grotto\n\n↑ Greater London Burial Index, Find My Past citing:Alexander Pope Esq, 5 June 1744, Twickenham FMP accessed:11 Dec 2019\n\n↑ Poet's Graves [2]\n\nSee also:\n\nAlexander Pope (1688-1744) on Find A Grave: Memorial #6884177 retrieved 14 May 2018\n\nAlexander Pope Wikipedia page\n\nAlexander Pope Wikidata page\n\n'Virginia Woolf' a biography by her nephew Quentin Bell, published by The Hogarth Press, Pimlico, London in 1996.
