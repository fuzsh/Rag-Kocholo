        "text": "Pope Alexander VI in the series \"Borgia\" (Hungary, Ireland, Canada, 2011-2013)\n\nIn previous articles (first, second, third) we talked about how the young Spaniard Rodrigo Borjo became Cardinal of Di Borgia (Borgia) and his famous children Cesare and Lucrezia. Today we will talk about how Rodrigo Borgia became Pope Alexander VI, and about his activities as pontiff.\n\nFirst steps\n\nAs we remember from first article, the authority of Cardinal Rodrigo Di Borgia in Rome was very high (stories of universal hatred for this pontiff appeared after his death and were spread by enemies of the Borgia family). During the reign of four popes, Rodrigo Di Borgi was Vice-Chancellor of the Holy See, and therefore no one was surprised that he was finally elected pontiff. It happened in 1492 after the death of Innocent VIII.\n\nThe attitude of the Romans towards the new pope can be judged by the following fact. Rodrigo (more precisely, already Alexander VI), who came out to the people, was picked up by the crowd and carried in his arms through the streets of Rome to the Lateran Palace - to the roar of trumpets and joyful cries. Here, the new dad lost consciousness from an excess of feelings. At this time, the hero of our article was already over 60 years old. He was to rule the Holy See for 11 years.\n\nPope Alexander VI in front of the Risen Christ, fresco by the Borgia court painter, Bernardino di Betto Biagio, nicknamed Pinturicchio - \"The Little Artist\"\n\nIn stories about the activities of Pope Alexander VI, the emphasis is usually on evidence such as that left by the master of ceremonies of the Roman Curia, Johann Burkard. Talking about the famous “chestnut banquet” with 50 invited “harlots”, arranged in the Vatican in 1501 by Cesare Borgia, he writes:\n\n“Lucrezia, the pope and the guests threw roasted chestnuts, and the harlots picked them up, running completely naked, crawling, laughing and falling. The more dexterous received from his Holiness silk fabrics and jewelry as a reward. Finally, the Pope gave the sign to the contest, and an unimaginable revelry began. It is completely impossible to describe it: the guests did whatever they pleased with the women. Lucrezia sat with her father on a high stage, holding in her hand a prize intended for the most ardent and tireless lover.\n\nThat is, we see a description of a standard and unremarkable party in Silvio Berlusconi's favorite \"bunga-bunga\" style. Father and daughter Borgia are not participants in the main action, but spectators and judges. Plain \"games\" of this kind have always been popular at all times. They were arranged for Mark Antony by the famous Cleopatra, they are also popular on the yachts of modern Arab sheikhs. The naked actresses of one of these shows on April 3, 2021 massively (in the amount of 40 pieces) “lit up” on the balcony of the Dubai Marina Hotel. It is unlikely that all this could shock and greatly surprise the Romans, who had long been accustomed to the playful mores of the popes of that time.\n\nHowever, there were other aspects of the activities of Alexander Borgia. So, it is he who is considered the founder of the residential development of the Vatican. By his order, they expanded and paved the square near the Castel Sant'Angelo. A new street was laid to the Vatican, which was then called Via Alexandrina, and now Borgo Nuovo. A new tower of the Vatican Palace was built, paintings by Pinturicchio, his students and assistants appeared in the halls. By order of Alexander VI, the Roman quarter of Tor di Nona was fortified, thanks to which the Eternal City turned out to be practically invulnerable from the sea.\n\nHartmann Schedel, The Nuremberg Chronicles. Map of Rome 1493\n\nAt the same time, the construction of fortifications in Subiaco and Nepi took place.\n\nIn June 1493, Alexander VI concluded an alliance with the Kingdom of Naples, the pledge of which was the marriage between his youngest son Jofre (he was only 13 years old) and Princess Sancha of Aragon (granddaughter of the reigning king Ferdinand I). Sancha, who was older than her husband, was credited with cohabitation with his brothers, Juan and Cesare. But the union of Naples and the Papal States was destroyed after Sanchi's brother Alfonso, who married Lucrezia Borgia in 1498, was killed in Rome in the summer of 1500.\n\nAnother great merit of Alexander VI was the filling of the papal treasury. It is known that his predecessors left him debts in the amount of about 120 thousand ducats. After 11 years, despite the large expenses incurred by him during the completely unfriendly \"visit\" of the French king Charles VIII of Valois and the fighting of the Second Roman campaign, the Vatican's budget was in surplus. Enemies spoke of the excessive extravagance of Alexander Borgia, but it is known that the cardinals did not like to dine at his table - not because they were afraid of being poisoned: they were simply not used to the single change of dishes practiced by the cooks of this pope.\n\nOn May 4, 1493, the bull Inter caetera was issued, asserting the right of Spain and Portugal to the newly discovered lands in America and regulating their division between them. Moreover, on June 19, Alexander VI allowed the Spanish monarchs to tax churches - to cover the cost of converting \"infidels\" in Spain and the New World. In 1496, he conferred the title of Catholic King on Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon.\n\nEmblem of the Catholic kings\n\nAlexander VI Borgia vs. Tommaso Torquemada\n\n12 years after the founding of the Inquisition in Spain, in 1492, at the insistence of the famous Tommaso Torquemada, the Catholic kings issued the notorious Edict of Granada to expel the Jews from the country.\n\nCatholic kings and Torquemada\n\nThen two people helped these people. The first was the Turkish Sultan Bayezid II, who ordered Kemal Reis, whose squadron fought on the side of Granada in Andalusia and the Balearic Islands since 1487, to evacuate the expelled people to the lands of the Ottoman Empire. About 150 thousand people took advantage of his offer, settled in Constantinople, Edirne, Thessaloniki, Izmir, Bursa, Gallipoli, Amasya, Patros, Larissa, on the island of Corfu and in some other areas. Bayazid even mockingly thanked King Ferdinand II for enriching his country while ruining his own. The Sultan commented on the Edict of Granada with the words:\n\n\"How can I call King Ferdinand wise if he enriched my country, while he himself became a beggar.\"\n\nPart of the Jews expelled from Spain went to Italy, including Don Abravanel (Yitzhak ben Yehuda), a former close associate of the Portuguese King Afonso V and Minister of Finance Ferdinand the Catholic. Here, too, they were not welcome everywhere, but the newly elected Pope Alexander VI Borgia became the second person after Bayezid II to treat the Sephardim who arrived in his area humanely. It is curious that local Jews opposed their resettlement here. Fearing that against the background of the influx of these refugees, their own situation would worsen, they turned to Alexander with a request to prevent the fugitives from entering the territory of the papacy and Rome. Enraged by such selfishness, Alexander fined the Jewish community two thousand ducats.\n\nIn addition to the Jews, Alexander Borgia allowed the Marranos, who had been persecuted by the Spanish inquisitors, to settle in the papal region, as the Jews who converted to Christianity and their descendants were called in the Iberian Peninsula. These decisions provoked conflict with the Catholic kings. Not wanting a break, Alexander VI actually staged the expulsion of Jews from Rome, followed by the return in small groups back. And the Marranos were given the opportunity to bring a formal promise of renunciation of \"heresy\", the implementation of which no one really controlled.\n\nPope Alexander generally acted as an irreconcilable opponent of the Spanish inquisitors. It got to the point that on June 23, 1494, he sent four coadjutors (\"assistants\") to Spain, who were given the right to appeal against the decisions of the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada himself - \"due to his advanced age and various ailments.\" The offended Torquemada tried to resist, on his orders two bishops who dared to complain about him to Rome were even sentenced to death. However, at the request of Alexander VI, they were pardoned by the Catholic kings.\n\nThe confrontation between the two giants - Alexander VI Borgia and Tommaso Torquemada, ended with the fact that the aged Grand Inquisitor in 1496, nominally retaining his position, actually retired and retired to the monastery of St. Thomas built with his active participation.\n\nAnd since 1498, the chief rabbi of Rome and part-time famous astronomer, the Provencal Jew Bonet, became the personal doctor of Alexander Borgia.\n\nPope Alexander Borgia and Turkish Prince Cem\n\nOttoman Sultan Mehmed II, who entered history nicknamed Fatih (Conqueror), upon accession to the throne in 1451, he immediately ordered the death of his younger brother. Later, he issued a law officially allowing the sons of the deceased sultan to kill each other \"for the sake of the public good\" (Nizam-I Alem) - in order to avoid confusion and internecine wars:\n\n“And which of my sons will get the sultanate, in the name of the common good, it is permissible to kill brothers. This is supported by the majority of ulema. Let them act on it.\"\n\n\"Extra\" princes were supposed to be killed \"without shedding blood\" - usually they were strangled with a silk cord. Of the three sons of Mehmed II himself, at the time of his death in 1481, two were alive - shehzade Bayazid and his younger brother Cem (Zizim). The Sanjak of Jem was closer to the capital, but the messenger sent to him was intercepted, and Bayazid arrived in Constantinople before his brother. He achieved the favor of the Janissaries of the capital by ordering to increase their content from 2 to 4 akçe per day. Having settled in Bursa, Cem also declared himself a sultan, but the power was on the side of Bayezid. Defeated, Jem fled to Cairo, and from there he moved to the Hospitallers - to the island of Rhodes.\n\nGrandmaster of the Ioannites - Pierre Aubusson, who in 1480 led the famous defense of Rhodes from the huge Ottoman fleet, away from sin, transferred the Turkish prince to one of the French fortresses. After that, he entered into a bargain, since he received lucrative offers for the extradition of Jem from the sultans of Turkey and Egypt, the French king Charles VIII and Pope Innocent VIII. In the end, Aubusson exchanged the prince for the rank of cardinal, and in the spring of 1489 Cem was brought to Rome.\n\nInnocent VIII officially declared that the prince remained faithful to Islam and recognized him as the legitimate ruler of the Ottoman Empire. Unpleasantly surprised, Bayazid II sent the famous “spear of Longinus” to the pontiff in 1492, along with an urgent request to give him a pretender, or at least guarantee his longest stay in Rome.\n\nThis is a drawing of the Vatican \"spear of Longinus\", which is kept in St. Peter's Basilica. There are three more artifacts that claim the title of \"Holy Spear\" - Viennese (the most famous), Krakow and Armenian. It is the Vatican spear that is the most ancient - it has been known since 570, and besides, as they say, it looks like an ancient Roman hasta, which at the time of Christ served as an award weapons\n\nBarely having time to receive the \"spear of Longinus\", Innocent VIII died, and in 1492 Alexander VI Borgia was elected the new pope. He established a very favorable relationship with Sultan Bayazid, accepting both money and Christian relics from him in exchange for promises that Cem would continue to remain an honorary prisoner in Rome. Gritting his teeth with rage, Bayezid assured Alexander Borgia in his letters:\n\n\"Our friendship, with the help of God, will grow stronger day by day.\"\n\nPortrait of Sultan Bayezid II, British Museum\n\nPortrait of Jem by Pinturicchio\n\nPope Alexander VI\n\nFinally, the Ottoman sultan decided on “an offer that cannot be refused”: 300 ducats, provided that the soul of Cem “changes the vale of sorrow for a better world” - and then “Your Holiness will be able to buy your sons a principality.”\n\nIt is difficult to say what Alexander Borgia's answer would have been, but Bayezid's ambassadors did not reach Rome. They were captured by Giovanni della Rovere, the brother of Cardinal Giuliano, who would later become Pope Julius II. Giuliano della Rovere, as we remember, was the worst enemy of the Borgia family, of course, he tried to accuse Pope Alexander VI of conspiring with the Turkish Sultan. Prince Jem was now very \"toxic\" to the Borgias, and Alexander tried to sell him to the French King Charles VIII. However, Cem died unexpectedly in 1495, and it is unlikely that anyone from Borgia was involved in his death: the Ottoman prince was too valuable \"capital\", and his death was completely unprofitable for this family.\n\nItalian campaign of Charles VIII Valois\n\nCharles VIII\n\nIn an article dedicated to Cesare Borgia, we talked about the fact that in 1494, after the death of King Fernando I of Naples, the French king Charles VIII tried to lay claim to this state, which once belonged to the Angevin branch of the Valois dynasty.\n\nItaly in 1494\n\nIn the army of Charles VIII was Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, who in 1492 was the main rival of the hero of our article in the election of a new pope, but lost to him. Now he hoped, with the help of the French, to remove the legitimate Pope Alexander VI Borgia from power and seize the Holy See. Florence also sided with the French, from which Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici was expelled in November. As a result, the enemy of Pope Alexander Borgia, the Dominican Girolama Savonarola, came to power in this city.\n\nGirolamo Savonarola in a portrait by Moretto da Brescia\n\nBy the way, his student in his youth was Mikhail Trivolis - the future Orthodox saint and one of the leaders of the \"non-possessors\" party, known in our country as Maxim the Greek.\n\nMaxim Grek on an icon of the second half of the XNUMXth century, State Historical Museum\n\nSavonarola declared Jesus Christ the king and signor of Florence, after which he turned this cheerful city into the gloomy Geneva of the times of John Calvin for three and a half years. Detachments of fanatics who call themselves the holy police and exalted children (\"innocent lambs\") broke into houses to see how their inhabitants observed the Lord's Commandments. They took \"worldly things\" like playing cards and dice, chess, secular books, perfumes, rouge, wigs, musical instruments. All this was then burned on the \"bonfires of vanity.\" Botticelli personally carried several of his paintings to such a fire.\n\nLet us return to the Papal States, where the influential clan of the Colonna family went over to the side of Charles VIII. They managed to capture Ostia, because of which food supplies to Rome were interrupted: signs of famine appeared in the city.\n\nOn December 3, 1494, the French army entered the Papal States. Alexander VI moved to the hastily fortified castle of the Holy Angel. On December 25, he was forced to agree to the free passage of French troops through the territory under his control. After that, the five thousandth French corps was located on the left bank of the Tiber. On the night of December 31, 1494 to January 1, 1495, the King of France entered the Eternal City.\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, on January 15, 1495, the parties came to an agreement: Alexander VI would provide food for the French troops and appoint French subjects as commandants of his castles. The key to fulfilling the terms of this agreement on the part of the pope was his son Cesare, who was to be held hostage in the French army for 4 months. As we remember from the previous article, very soon Cesare managed to escape, disguised as a groom. The troops of Charles VIII entered Naples without a fight, but this was the last success of this king. Just at that time, an epidemic of syphilis began in Italy, which the Italians then called the “French disease” (morbo gallico), and the French, on the contrary, the “Neapolitan disease”. Then Cesare Borgia also became infected, who, according to some sources, was forced to wear a mask at the end of his life.\n\nOn April 1, 1495, an anti-French defensive league was created, which included the Papal States, the Holy Roman Empire, Milan, Spain and Venice. Later, the British also joined them. An army was assembled, in which there were from 40 to 50 thousand people. The French army then had only about 10 thousand soldiers and officers. On May 12, 1495, most of the French army, led by Charles VIII, left Naples.\n\nOn June 6, at Fornovo, she entered into battle with the coalition troops, who, despite their numerical advantage, could not achieve victory. Charles VIII managed to avoid disaster and withdraw his army to France. But the troops of the Duke de Montpensier, left by the king in Naples, capitulated a year later - on July 20, 1496. The last French garrisons stationed in various fortresses in Italy surrendered in 1498.\n\nSecond Italian (Roman) War\n\nIn 1496, Alexander VI Borgia decided to punish the Orsini and Sforza clans, who had betrayed him by supporting Charles VIII. Initially, his son Juan, recalled from Spain, was appointed gonfaloniere (commander in chief of the papal army). He turned out to be a useless commander, and in January 1497 he was defeated at the castle of Bracciano, which belonged to the Orsini clan.\n\nOn June 14, 1497, Juan Borgia was killed in Rome, and his place was taken by Cesare, who acted much more successfully and efficiently. Having visited the new king of France, Louis XII, on a diplomatic mission and married during this visit the sister of the Navarre king, Charlotte d'Albret, he returned to Rome, bringing with him 4 infantry and 000 horsemen. Having attached mercenary detachments to them and bringing the number of his troops to 1 thousand people, he began a military campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dominican Girolama Savonarola, who had usurped power in Florence, also recalled himself, who in March 1498 wrote a “Letter to the Sovereigns” demanding the deposition of the pope. It must be said that Alexander Borgia repeatedly tried to establish relations with the new lord of Florence and even offered him the rank of cardinal. But, as they say, \"Ostap suffered.\"\n\nHowever, the days of this fanatic were already numbered: on April 8, 1498, a crowd of angry citizens broke into the monastery of St. Mark, capturing Savonarola and two of his associates. The investigation, organized by order of Pope Alexander VI, lasted a month and a half. May 22, 1498 was sentenced to death, May 23 - Savonarola was hanged in the Piazza Senoria, his body was burned.\n\nPope Alexander VI and Savonarola in the series \"Borgia\" (Hungary, Ireland, Canada, 2011-2013)\n\nFilippo Dolcati. The execution of Savonarola in Piazza della Signoria\n\nLater, this half-crazy extremist was recognized by the Catholic Church as a martyr of the faith.\n\nAnd Cesare Borgia by 1503 subjugated almost all of Umbria, Emilia and Romagna.\n\nA little about poisons\n\nIn the first article of this small series, we found out that the only poisons available to Borgia were the notorious cantarella (cantharidin) and arsenic. Arsenic in a dose sufficient for fatal poisoning (5-17 grams for a person) acts too quickly - death from paralysis of the respiratory muscles occurs within one to two hours. This, of course, would have aroused suspicion and a very unpleasant response for Borgia from the relatives and close circle of the dead - after all, it only made sense to poison people important and having great influence both in church circles and in the entire papal region. And the power of the pope was by no means absolute, and the crowd could easily put any of the pontiffs out of the city or drive them to the castle of the Holy Angel.\n\nAnd cantharidin was used in ancient Rome as a means to increase male potency (“Spanish flies”). Tacitus reports that Empress Livia, the wife of Augustus, poured this drug on guests during dinner - not with the aim of poisoning them, but in order to provoke sexual intemperance and get compromising evidence.\n\nKantharidin was taken by Emperor Henry IV, the husband of the Russian princess Evpraksia Vsevolodovna, who later accused him of Satanism and numerous sexual perversions. Spanish flies were widely used in France. In the XNUMXth century, the potion of Catherine Monvoisin, known by the nickname La Voisin (“Neighbor”), was extremely popular in Paris, whose clients were representatives of the highest aristocracy of the kingdom. For dramatic effect, she added mole and bat blood to cantharidin.\n\nIn the 120th century, sweet and colorful “Richelieu lozenges” containing cantharidin were in great demand (this is not the famous cardinal, but a marshal who lived much later, who supplied King Louis XV with them). The lethal dose of cantharidin is about XNUMX grams. In doses that could be hidden even in the famous Borgia ring, even in the key, cantharidin would act exactly as an aphrodisiac (the dose of arsenic hidden in the ring is also insufficient for fatal poisoning). Therefore, modern researchers are more than skeptical about the stories of mass poisoning of Borgia opponents.\n\nDeath of Alexander VI Borgia\n\nArticle \"To Be Caesar or Nobody\" we have already spoken of the alleged poisoning of father and son Borgia. And they found out that the ill-fated dinner was held on August 6, 1503 in the house of Cardinal Adriano Castellesi da Corneto. If we assume that the guests were nevertheless poisoned, then this, of course, did not happen by chance, and it was the owner of the house who could poison them.\n\nHowever, Pope Alexander VI died only 12 days after visiting the house of Cardinal da Corneto, and there is no reason to associate his illness with this visit. Evidence of poisoning was considered the fact that the corpse of the pontiff quickly swelled in the sun - just a ridiculous argument, given the weather in Italy in August.\n\nCesare Borgia survived, although he then lost almost everything. He died in 1507, his fate was described in a previous article. And in 1519, after giving birth, Lucrezia Borgia died.\n\nRyzhov V.A.\n\nOur news channels\n\nSubscribe and stay up to date with the latest news and the most important events of the day.\n\n136 comments\n\n\"Right Sector\" (banned in Russia), \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) (banned in Russia), ISIS (banned in Russia), \"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\" formerly \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (banned in Russia) , Taliban (banned in Russia), Al-Qaeda (banned in Russia), Anti-Corruption Foundation (banned in Russia), Navalny Headquarters (banned in Russia), Facebook (banned in Russia), Instagram (banned in Russia), Meta (banned in Russia), Misanthropic Division (banned in Russia), Azov (banned in Russia), Muslim Brotherhood (banned in Russia), Aum Shinrikyo (banned in Russia), AUE (banned in Russia), UNA-UNSO (banned in Russia), Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people (banned in Russia), Legion “Freedom of Russia” (armed formation, recognized as terrorist in the Russian Federation and banned), Kirill Budanov (included on the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists), the International LGBT public movement and its structural divisions are recognized as extremist (decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated November 30.11.2023, XNUMX)\n\n“Non-profit organizations, unregistered public associations or individuals performing the functions of a foreign agent,” as well as media outlets performing the functions of a foreign agent: “Medusa”; \"Voice of America\"; \"Realities\"; \"Present time\"; \"Radio Freedom\"; Ponomarev Lev; Ponomarev Ilya; Savitskaya; Markelov; Kamalyagin; Apakhonchich; Makarevich; Dud; Gordon; Zhdanov; Medvedev; Fedorov; Mikhail Kasyanov; Dmitry Muratov; \"Owl\"; \"Alliance of Doctors\"; \"RKK\" \"Levada Center\"; \"Memorial\"; \"Voice\"; \"Person and law\"; \"Rain\"; \"Mediazone\"; \"Deutsche Welle\"; QMS \"Caucasian Knot\"; \"Insider\"; \"New Newspaper\""
