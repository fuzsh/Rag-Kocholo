        "text": "On June 29 in the jubilee year of 1500, lightning made a direct hit on Vatican City, striking the roof directly above the corrupt, scheming Spanish-born Pope Alexander VI — better known in our time as Rodrigo Borgia — while he sat on his majestic throne. The blast sent a stone fireplace on a higher floor crashing through the ceiling, leaving His Holiness “engulfed by an avalanche of wood and plaster.” In her evocation of this scene in “Blood and Beauty,” her novel about the notorious Borgias, Sarah Dunant sends papal guards rushing to save their lord, “throwing themselves onto the pile, tearing at the rubble with their bare hands.”\n\nBefore reading into this thunderclap a demonstration of divine judgment against Borgia and his power-hungry, lascivious sons — who conspired through murder, war and strategic marriages to dominate Italy at the height of the Renaissance — consider two facts. First: the Borgia pope survived. And second: lightning also made a direct hit this year on the dome of St. Peter’s, on Feb. 11, the same day Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation. Was it the wrath of God or a twist of fate — ordered, as Rodrigo suspects, by “that other deity, Fortuna”? Sometimes a lightning bolt is just a lightning bolt.\n\nIn the five centuries since Rodrigo Borgia’s death in 1503, his family name has become synonymous with poison, incest and violent intrigue, and has inspired a host of biographies, paintings, operas, novels, movies and television dramas — the latest of which, Showtime’s three-season series, has just concluded. The Borgias were definitely bad, but were they as bad as all that? Dunant, the author of several previous best-selling works of fiction set in the Italian Renaissance, doesn’t think so.\n\nDid Rodrigo Borgia sleep with his daughter, Lucrezia, as her first husband charged? “Not true,” the author protests in a video on her Web site. Did Lucrezia have a steamy affair with her syphilitic brother, Cesare? “Not true,” Dunant scoffs. Was Lucrezia a serial poisoner? Again: “Not true.” Were the Borgias “tremendous murderers and ruthless merchants?” Well, you’ve got her there."
