        "text": "Alexander Pope Biography\n\nAlexander Pope was born into a prosperous middle-class family in London. His father, also named Alexander Pope, was a successful cloth merchant who had married Editha Turner, a member of a prominent Catholic family from Yorkshire. Shortly after his birth, the family moved out of central London, settling in Binfield near Windsor Forest in accordance with a law that forbade Catholics from living within ten miles of the city center. Pope’s parents were both already in their 40s when he was born and were wealthy enough to retire following the move.\n\nAlexander Pope enjoyed his boyhood in the countryside but had mixed experiences at school. After he was beaten by his teachers at the Twyford School in Hampshire, his parents withdrew him. He returned home, where he had occasional tutors but was largely self-educated.\n\nAlways short and thin, Pope contracted tuberculosis of the spine when he was 12, also known as Pott’s disease. This caused pain and disability for the remainder of Pope’s life, giving him a kyphotic (hunched) spine and limiting his height to about 4’6”.\n\nAs a teenager, Pope began traveling into London more and more frequently. He learned French and Italian there and started frequenting the literary coffee houses where famous writers would gather. Pope entered the literary scene with the publication of his \"Pastorals\" in 1709 and his \"Essay on Criticism\" in 1711. Both displayed Pope’s exceptional talent and craftsmanship but were largely overlooked at first. Two years later, he gained real attention with \"The Rape of the Lock\", a mock-heroic poem making light of a trivial social faux-pas that had caused a rift between two prominent families.\n\nPope now began to move among the upper circles of London literary society. He came up with a plan to secure his financial independence: he would translate Homer’s Iliad in installments, delivering them as part of a paid subscription service. Using his connections, he hoped to be able to find many well-heeled subscribers. The plan, the first of its kind, proved enormously successful and netted Pope over £9,000 (well over £1,000,000, adjusted for inflation). Pope was now financially free to pursue whatever work he chose. One of the first things he did was set himself up in a rural estate in Twickenham, just outside of London. He would build a garden complete with a grotto that he would obsessively improve upon for the rest of his life.\n\nIn these years, Alexander Pope also became increasingly close with Jonathan Swift (1667-1745), John Arbuthnot (1667-1735), and Thomas Parnell (1679-1718). Together, these friends invented a persona they named Martinus Scriblerus and collaboratively wrote satire in his name. They used these writings to publish humorous satirical attacks on pomposity and dullness. This loose association was known as the Scriblerus Club, and its members Scriblerians.\n\nThroughout this period, Pope gained many enemies as well as friends. He was often ruthlessly mocked for his height, disability, and religion. His credentials to translate Homer were openly questioned (and it is true that he knew little Greek). When he later edited a volume of William Shakespeare’s works, a well-known Shakespearean scholar named Lewis Theobald publicly accused him of editorial incompetence. This was mostly par for the course in the cutthroat world of early 18th century London literary society, and Pope gave as well as he got. In 1728, he published \"The Dunciad\", which ruthlessly mocked his enemies in brilliantly polished verse (Theobald became \"Tibbald, King of Dunces\"). \"The Dunciad\" is still widely studied today, though most of Pope’s targets are themselves forgotten to history.\n\nIn the 1730s, Pope developed a friendship with Henry St. John, 1st Viscount of Bolingbroke, with whom he would have long philosophical discussions. This led to one of Pope’s most famous poems, \"An Essay on Man\". First published in 1734, it was a brilliant and witty summary of popular Enlightenment-era philosophical and theological beliefs, widely admired in its time."
