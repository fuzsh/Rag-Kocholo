        "text": "September 20, 2021\n\nAs this charming little book is about a 17th century Italian Baroque artist/architect it will have limited general appeal. This is a rather an unusual book in that it is something of a biography of Lorenzo Bernini who gave us the baldacchino, the bronze canopy, over the altar of St. Peter's Church in Rome as well as the embracing colonnade that encloses St. Peter's Square. He also is responsible for one of the most beautiful churches I have ever seen, Sant' Andrea al Quirinale, a sensuous and lyrical rhapsody in stone. Of course these are by no means his only artistic contributions but they are unusual in that Bernini was primarily a sculptor and not an architect though his architecture is what he is known for.\n\nWhat really makes this book unusual is that it is relatively short, only 271 pages of text, and there are no chapters. It is a continuous textual discourse with numerous page breaks and lavishly illustrated. Without illustrations any book about a visual art or artist is worthless and may as well be junked. In that regard the reader will not be disappointed. Reading this chapterless book put me in mind of a transcript of a lecture on Baroque architecture in Rome but it is too relaxed and informal, almost conversational which makes it easily understood and endured. While the book is about Bernini it is hardly an exhaustive treatment of his life and art. It is also about the people that advanced and supported his career as well as a history of the city of Rome and Roman culture. It ends with the author presenting the reader with a descriptive walking tour of the city of Rome and the obelisks found in that city. It was at this point that I came to realize that this book is more of a tour guide of Rome in the Baroque era with particular emphasis on its most noteworthy architect of that period. As I stated it is not an exhaustive treatment of this period or its notable personages but it is an excellent introduction and worth reading if the period, the art, or the city are of interest to you."
