        "text": "Coat of arms of Pope Alexander VII, St Peter's Square\n\nSome popes left their mark on the Eternal City more than others and one such figure was Alexander VII (r. 1655-67).\n\nAlexander VII was born Fabio Chigi, a member of a princely Roman family of Sienese extraction. The heraldic arms of the Chigi family, which takes the form of six mountains surmounted by an eight-pointed star, can be seen all over Rome.\n\nThe Chigi coat of arms is sometimes quartered with that of the Della Rovere family, a privilege conferred on Agostino Chigi (1465-1520), an immensely wealthy banker and patron of the arts, by Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere, r. 1503-13). Rovere is the Italian word for oak and, unsurprisingly, the family's coat of arms incorporates an oak tree.\n\nThe Chigi family's motto is Micat in Vertice (It shines at the summit).\n\nâ€‹\n\nRelated post: Papal Coats of Arms.\n\nOrgan loft, Santa Maria del Popolo\n\nElephant and Obelisk, Piazza della Minerva\n\nHeraldic arms of Pope Alexander VII atop the obelisk in Piazza della Minerva\n\nPorta del Popolo\n\nSant' Andrea della Valle"
