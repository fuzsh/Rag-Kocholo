        "text": "PART 1\n\n'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill\n\nAppear in writing or in judging ill;\n\nBut, of the two, less dang'rous is th' offence\n\nTo tire our patience, than mislead our sense.\n\nSome few in that, but numbers err in this,\n\nTen censure wrong for one who writes amiss;\n\nA fool might once himself alone expose,\n\nNow one in verse makes many more in prose.\n\n'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none\n\nGo just alike, yet each believes his own.\n\nIn poets as true genius is but rare,\n\nTrue taste as seldom is the critic's share;\n\nBoth must alike from Heav'n derive their light,\n\nThese born to judge, as well as those to write.\n\nLet such teach others who themselves excel,\n\nAnd censure freely who have written well.\n\nAuthors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,\n\nBut are not critics to their judgment too?\n\nYet if we look more closely we shall find\n\nMost have the seeds of judgment in their mind;\n\nNature affords at least a glimm'ring light;\n\nThe lines, tho' touch'd but faintly, are drawn right.\n\nBut as the slightest sketch, if justly trac'd,\n\nIs by ill colouring but the more disgrac'd,\n\nSo by false learning is good sense defac'd;\n\nSome are bewilder'd in the maze of schools,\n\nAnd some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.\n\nIn search of wit these lose their common sense,\n\nAnd then turn critics in their own defence:\n\nEach burns alike, who can, or cannot write,\n\nOr with a rival's, or an eunuch's spite.\n\nAll fools have still an itching to deride,\n\nAnd fain would be upon the laughing side.\n\nIf MÃ¦vius scribble in Apollo's spite,\n\nThere are, who judge still worse than he can write.\n\nSome have at first for wits, then poets pass'd,\n\nTurn'd critics next, and prov'd plain fools at last;\n\nSome neither can for wits nor critics pass,\n\nAs heavy mules are neither horse nor ass.\n\nThose half-learn'd witlings, num'rous in our isle\n\nAs half-form'd insects on the banks of Nile;\n\nUnfinish'd things, one knows not what to call,\n\nTheir generation's so equivocal:\n\nTo tell 'em, would a hundred tongues require,\n\nOr one vain wit's, that might a hundred tire.\n\nBut you who seek to give and merit fame,\n\nAnd justly bear a critic's noble name,\n\nBe sure your self and your own reach to know,\n\nHow far your genius, taste, and learning go;\n\nLaunch not beyond your depth, but be discreet,\n\nAnd mark that point where sense and dulness meet.\n\nNature to all things fix'd the limits fit,\n\nAnd wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit:\n\nAs on the land while here the ocean gains,\n\nIn other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;\n\nThus in the soul while memory prevails,\n\nThe solid pow'r of understanding fails;\n\nWhere beams of warm imagination play,\n\nThe memory's soft figures melt away.\n\nOne science only will one genius fit;\n\nSo vast is art, so narrow human wit:\n\nNot only bounded to peculiar arts,\n\nBut oft in those, confin'd to single parts.\n\nLike kings we lose the conquests gain'd before,\n\nBy vain ambition still to make them more;\n\nEach might his sev'ral province well command,\n\nWould all but stoop to what they understand.\n\nFirst follow NATURE, and your judgment frame\n\nBy her just standard, which is still the same:\n\nUnerring Nature, still divinely bright,\n\nOne clear, unchang'd, and universal light,\n\nLife, force, and beauty, must to all impart,\n\nAt once the source, and end, and test of art.\n\nArt from that fund each just supply provides,\n\nWorks without show, and without pomp presides:\n\nIn some fair body thus th' informing soul\n\nWith spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,\n\nEach motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains;\n\nItself unseen, but in th' effects, remains.\n\nSome, to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse,\n\nWant as much more, to turn it to its use;\n\nFor wit and judgment often are at strife,\n\nThough meant each other's aid, like man and wife.\n\n'Tis more to guide, than spur the Muse's steed;\n\nRestrain his fury, than provoke his speed;\n\nThe winged courser, like a gen'rous horse,\n\nShows most true mettle when you check his course.\n\nThose RULES of old discover'd, not devis'd,\n\nAre Nature still, but Nature methodis'd;\n\nNature, like liberty, is but restrain'd\n\nBy the same laws which first herself ordain'd.\n\nHear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,\n\nWhen to repress, and when indulge our flights:\n\nHigh on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,\n\nAnd pointed out those arduous paths they trod;\n\nHeld from afar, aloft, th' immortal prize,\n\nAnd urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise.\n\nJust precepts thus from great examples giv'n,\n\nShe drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n.\n\nThe gen'rous critic fann'd the poet's fire,\n\nAnd taught the world with reason to admire.\n\nThen criticism the Muse's handmaid prov'd,\n\nTo dress her charms, and make her more belov'd;\n\nBut following wits from that intention stray'd;\n\nWho could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;\n\nAgainst the poets their own arms they turn'd,\n\nSure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.\n\nSo modern 'pothecaries, taught the art\n\nBy doctor's bills to play the doctor's part,\n\nBold in the practice of mistaken rules,\n\nPrescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.\n\nSome on the leaves of ancient authors prey,\n\nNor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they:\n\nSome drily plain, without invention's aid,\n\nWrite dull receipts how poems may be made:\n\nThese leave the sense, their learning to display,\n\nAnd those explain the meaning quite away.\n\nYou then whose judgment the right course would steer,\n\nKnow well each ANCIENT'S proper character;\n\nHis fable, subject, scope in ev'ry page;\n\nReligion, country, genius of his age:\n\nWithout all these at once before your eyes,\n\nCavil you may, but never criticise.\n\nBe Homer's works your study and delight,\n\nRead them by day, and meditate by night;\n\nThence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,\n\nAnd trace the Muses upward to their spring;\n\nStill with itself compar'd, his text peruse;\n\nAnd let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.\n\nWhen first young Maro in his boundless mind\n\nA work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,\n\nPerhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,\n\nAnd but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:\n\nBut when t' examine ev'ry part he came,\n\nNature and Homer were, he found, the same.\n\nConvinc'd, amaz'd, he checks the bold design,\n\nAnd rules as strict his labour'd work confine,\n\nAs if the Stagirite o'erlook'd each line.\n\nLearn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;\n\nTo copy nature is to copy them.\n\nSome beauties yet, no precepts can declare,\n\nFor there's a happiness as well as care.\n\nMusic resembles poetry, in each\n\nAre nameless graces which no methods teach,\n\nAnd which a master-hand alone can reach.\n\nIf, where the rules not far enough extend,\n\n(Since rules were made but to promote their end)\n\nSome lucky LICENCE answers to the full\n\nTh' intent propos'd, that licence is a rule.\n\nThus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,\n\nMay boldly deviate from the common track.\n\nGreat wits sometimes may gloriously offend,\n\nAnd rise to faults true critics dare not mend;\n\nFrom vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,\n\nAnd snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,\n\nWhich, without passing through the judgment, gains\n\nThe heart, and all its end at once attains.\n\nIn prospects, thus, some objects please our eyes,\n\nWhich out of nature's common order rise,\n\nThe shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.\n\nBut tho' the ancients thus their rules invade,\n\n(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made)\n\nModerns, beware! or if you must offend\n\nAgainst the precept, ne'er transgress its end;\n\nLet it be seldom, and compell'd by need,\n\nAnd have, at least, their precedent to plead.\n\nThe critic else proceeds without remorse,\n\nSeizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.\n\nI know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts\n\nThose freer beauties, ev'n in them, seem faults.\n\nSome figures monstrous and misshap'd appear,\n\nConsider'd singly, or beheld too near,\n\nWhich, but proportion'd to their light, or place,\n\nDue distance reconciles to form and grace.\n\nA prudent chief not always must display\n\nHis pow'rs in equal ranks, and fair array,\n\nBut with th' occasion and the place comply,\n\nConceal his force, nay seem sometimes to fly.\n\nThose oft are stratagems which errors seem,\n\nNor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.\n\nStill green with bays each ancient altar stands,\n\nAbove the reach of sacrilegious hands,\n\nSecure from flames, from envy's fiercer rage,\n\nDestructive war, and all-involving age.\n\nSee, from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!\n\nHear, in all tongues consenting pÃ¦ans ring!\n\nIn praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd,\n\nAnd fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind!\n\nHail, bards triumphant! born in happier days;\n\nImmortal heirs of universal praise!\n\nWhose honours with increase of ages grow,\n\nAs streams roll down, enlarging as they flow!\n\nNations unborn your mighty names shall sound,\n\nAnd worlds applaud that must not yet be found!\n\nOh may some spark of your celestial fire\n\nThe last, the meanest of your sons inspire,\n\n(That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights;\n\nGlows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)\n\nTo teach vain wits a science little known,\n\nT' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!\n\nPart 2\n\nOf all the causes which conspire to blind\n\nMan's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,\n\nWhat the weak head with strongest bias rules,\n\nIs pride, the never-failing vice of fools.\n\nWhatever Nature has in worth denied,\n\nShe gives in large recruits of needful pride;\n\nFor as in bodies, thus in souls, we find\n\nWhat wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind;\n\nPride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,\n\nAnd fills up all the mighty void of sense!\n\nIf once right reason drives that cloud away,\n\nTruth breaks upon us with resistless day;\n\nTrust not yourself; but your defects to know,\n\nMake use of ev'ry friendâand ev'ry foe.\n\nA little learning is a dang'rous thing;\n\nDrink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:\n\nThere shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,\n\nAnd drinking largely sobers us again.\n\nFir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts,\n\nIn fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,\n\nWhile from the bounded level of our mind,\n\nShort views we take, nor see the lengths behind,\n\nBut more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise\n\nNew, distant scenes of endless science rise!\n\nSo pleas'd at first, the tow'ring Alps we try,\n\nMount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky;\n\nTh' eternal snows appear already past,\n\nAnd the first clouds and mountains seem the last;\n\nBut those attain'd, we tremble to survey\n\nThe growing labours of the lengthen'd way,\n\nTh' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes,\n\nHills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!\n\nA perfect judge will read each work of wit\n\nWith the same spirit that its author writ,\n\nSurvey the whole, nor seek slight faults to find,\n\nWhere nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;\n\nNor lose, for that malignant dull delight,\n\nThe gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with wit.\n\nBut in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow,\n\nCorrectly cold, and regularly low,\n\nThat shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep;\n\nWe cannot blame indeedâbut we may sleep.\n\nIn wit, as nature, what affects our hearts\n\nIs not th' exactness of peculiar parts;\n\n'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,\n\nBut the joint force and full result of all.\n\nThus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,\n\n(The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!'\n\nNo single parts unequally surprise;\n\nAll comes united to th' admiring eyes;\n\nNo monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;\n\nThe whole at once is bold, and regular.\n\nWhoever thinks a faultless piece to see,\n\nThinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.\n\nIn ev'ry work regard the writer's end,\n\nSince none can compass more than they intend;\n\nAnd if the means be just, the conduct true,\n\nApplause, in spite of trivial faults, is due.\n\nAs men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,\n\nT' avoid great errors, must the less commit:\n\nNeglect the rules each verbal critic lays,\n\nFor not to know such trifles, is a praise.\n\nMost critics, fond of some subservient art,\n\nStill make the whole depend upon a part:\n\nThey talk of principles, but notions prize,\n\nAnd all to one lov'd folly sacrifice.\n\nOnce on a time, La Mancha's knight, they say,\n\nA certain bard encount'ring on the way,\n\nDiscours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage,\n\nAs e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage;\n\nConcluding all were desp'rate sots and fools,\n\nWho durst depart from Aristotle's rules.\n\nOur author, happy in a judge so nice,\n\nProduc'd his play, and begg'd the knight's advice,\n\nMade him observe the subject and the plot,\n\nThe manners, passions, unities, what not?\n\nAll which, exact to rule, were brought about,\n\nWere but a combat in the lists left out.\n\n\"What! leave the combat out?\" exclaims the knight;\n\n\"Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.\"\n\n\"Not so by Heav'n\" (he answers in a rage)\n\n\"Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage.\"\n\nSo vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.\n\n\"Then build a new, or act it in a plain.\"\n\nThus critics, of less judgment than caprice,\n\nCurious not knowing, not exact but nice,\n\nForm short ideas; and offend in arts\n\n(As most in manners) by a love to parts.\n\nSome to conceit alone their taste confine,\n\nAnd glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line;\n\nPleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit;\n\nOne glaring chaos and wild heap of wit.\n\nPoets, like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace\n\nThe naked nature and the living grace,\n\nWith gold and jewels cover ev'ry part,\n\nAnd hide with ornaments their want of art.\n\nTrue wit is nature to advantage dress'd,\n\nWhat oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd,\n\nSomething, whose truth convinc'd at sight we find,\n\nThat gives us back the image of our mind.\n\nAs shades more sweetly recommend the light,\n\nSo modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.\n\nFor works may have more wit than does 'em good,\n\nAs bodies perish through excess of blood.\n\nOthers for language all their care express,\n\nAnd value books, as women men, for dress:\n\nTheir praise is stillâ\"the style is excellent\":\n\nThe sense, they humbly take upon content.\n\nWords are like leaves; and where they most abound,\n\nMuch fruit of sense beneath is rarely found.\n\nFalse eloquence, like the prismatic glass,\n\nIts gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place;\n\nThe face of Nature we no more survey,\n\nAll glares alike, without distinction gay:\n\nBut true expression, like th' unchanging sun,\n\nClears, and improves whate'er it shines upon,\n\nIt gilds all objects, but it alters none.\n\nExpression is the dress of thought, and still\n\nAppears more decent, as more suitable;\n\nA vile conceit in pompous words express'd,\n\nIs like a clown in regal purple dress'd:\n\nFor diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort,\n\nAs several garbs with country, town, and court.\n\nSome by old words to fame have made pretence,\n\nAncients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;\n\nSuch labour'd nothings, in so strange a style,\n\nAmaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile.\n\nUnlucky, as Fungoso in the play,\n\nThese sparks with awkward vanity display\n\nWhat the fine gentleman wore yesterday!\n\nAnd but so mimic ancient wits at best,\n\nAs apes our grandsires, in their doublets dress'd.\n\nIn words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;\n\nAlike fantastic, if too new, or old;\n\nBe not the first by whom the new are tried,\n\nNot yet the last to lay the old aside.\n\nBut most by numbers judge a poet's song;\n\nAnd smooth or rough, with them is right or wrong:\n\nIn the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire,\n\nHer voice is all these tuneful fools admire,\n\nWho haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,\n\nNot mend their minds; as some to church repair,\n\nNot for the doctrine, but the music there.\n\nThese equal syllables alone require,\n\nTho' oft the ear the open vowels tire,\n\nWhile expletives their feeble aid do join,\n\nAnd ten low words oft creep in one dull line,\n\nWhile they ring round the same unvaried chimes,\n\nWith sure returns of still expected rhymes.\n\nWhere'er you find \"the cooling western breeze\",\n\nIn the next line, it \"whispers through the trees\":\n\nIf \"crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep\",\n\nThe reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with \"sleep\".\n\nThen, at the last and only couplet fraught\n\nWith some unmeaning thing they call a thought,\n\nA needless Alexandrine ends the song,\n\nThat, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.\n\nLeave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know\n\nWhat's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow;\n\nAnd praise the easy vigour of a line,\n\nWhere Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.\n\nTrue ease in writing comes from art, not chance,\n\nAs those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.\n\n'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,\n\nThe sound must seem an echo to the sense.\n\nSoft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,\n\nAnd the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;\n\nBut when loud surges lash the sounding shore,\n\nThe hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.\n\nWhen Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,\n\nThe line too labours, and the words move slow;\n\nNot so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,\n\nFlies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.\n\nHear how Timotheus' varied lays surprise,\n\nAnd bid alternate passions fall and rise!\n\nWhile, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove\n\nNow burns with glory, and then melts with love;\n\nNow his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,\n\nNow sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:\n\nPersians and Greeks like turns of nature found,\n\nAnd the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound!\n\nThe pow'r of music all our hearts allow,\n\nAnd what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.\n\nAvoid extremes; and shun the fault of such,\n\nWho still are pleas'd too little or too much.\n\nAt ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence,\n\nThat always shows great pride, or little sense;\n\nThose heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,\n\nWhich nauseate all, and nothing can digest.\n\nYet let not each gay turn thy rapture move,\n\nFor fools admire, but men of sense approve;\n\nAs things seem large which we through mists descry,\n\nDulness is ever apt to magnify.\n\nSome foreign writers, some our own despise;\n\nThe ancients only, or the moderns prize.\n\nThus wit, like faith, by each man is applied\n\nTo one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.\n\nMeanly they seek the blessing to confine,\n\nAnd force that sun but on a part to shine;\n\nWhich not alone the southern wit sublimes,\n\nBut ripens spirits in cold northern climes;\n\nWhich from the first has shone on ages past,\n\nEnlights the present, and shall warm the last;\n\n(Though each may feel increases and decays,\n\nAnd see now clearer and now darker days.)\n\nRegard not then if wit be old or new,\n\nBut blame the false, and value still the true.\n\nSome ne'er advance a judgment of their own,\n\nBut catch the spreading notion of the town;\n\nThey reason and conclude by precedent,\n\nAnd own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.\n\nSome judge of authors' names, not works, and then\n\nNor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.\n\nOf all this servile herd, the worst is he\n\nThat in proud dulness joins with quality,\n\nA constant critic at the great man's board,\n\nTo fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord.\n\nWhat woeful stuff this madrigal would be,\n\nIn some starv'd hackney sonneteer, or me?\n\nBut let a Lord once own the happy lines,\n\nHow the wit brightens! how the style refines!\n\nBefore his sacred name flies every fault,\n\nAnd each exalted stanza teems with thought!\n\nThe vulgar thus through imitation err;\n\nAs oft the learn'd by being singular;\n\nSo much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng\n\nBy chance go right, they purposely go wrong:\n\nSo Schismatics the plain believers quit,\n\nAnd are but damn'd for having too much wit.\n\nSome praise at morning what they blame at night;\n\nBut always think the last opinion right.\n\nA Muse by these is like a mistress us'd,\n\nThis hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd;\n\nWhile their weak heads, like towns unfortified,\n\nTwixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.\n\nAsk them the cause; they're wiser still, they say;\n\nAnd still tomorrow's wiser than today.\n\nWe think our fathers fools, so wise we grow;\n\nOur wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.\n\nOnce school divines this zealous isle o'erspread;\n\nWho knew most Sentences, was deepest read;\n\nFaith, Gospel, all, seem'd made to be disputed,\n\nAnd none had sense enough to be confuted:\n\nScotists and Thomists, now, in peace remain,\n\nAmidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck Lane.\n\nIf Faith itself has different dresses worn,\n\nWhat wonder modes in wit should take their turn?\n\nOft, leaving what is natural and fit,\n\nThe current folly proves the ready wit;\n\nAnd authors think their reputation safe\n\nWhich lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh.\n\nSome valuing those of their own side or mind,\n\nStill make themselves the measure of mankind;\n\nFondly we think we honour merit then,\n\nWhen we but praise ourselves in other men.\n\nParties in wit attend on those of state,\n\nAnd public faction doubles private hate.\n\nPride, Malice, Folly, against Dryden rose,\n\nIn various shapes of Parsons, Critics, Beaus;\n\nBut sense surviv'd, when merry jests were past;\n\nFor rising merit will buoy up at last.\n\nMight he return, and bless once more our eyes,\n\nNew Blackmores and new Milbourns must arise;\n\nNay should great Homer lift his awful head,\n\nZoilus again would start up from the dead.\n\nEnvy will merit, as its shade, pursue,\n\nBut like a shadow, proves the substance true;\n\nFor envied wit, like Sol eclips'd, makes known\n\nTh' opposing body's grossness, not its own.\n\nWhen first that sun too powerful beams displays,\n\nIt draws up vapours which obscure its rays;\n\nBut ev'n those clouds at last adorn its way,\n\nReflect new glories, and augment the day.\n\nBe thou the first true merit to befriend;\n\nHis praise is lost, who stays till all commend.\n\nShort is the date, alas, of modern rhymes,\n\nAnd 'tis but just to let 'em live betimes.\n\nNo longer now that golden age appears,\n\nWhen patriarch wits surviv'd a thousand years:\n\nNow length of Fame (our second life) is lost,\n\nAnd bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast;\n\nOur sons their fathers' failing language see,\n\nAnd such as Chaucer is, shall Dryden be.\n\nSo when the faithful pencil has design'd\n\nSome bright idea of the master's mind,\n\nWhere a new world leaps out at his command,\n\nAnd ready Nature waits upon his hand;\n\nWhen the ripe colours soften and unite,\n\nAnd sweetly melt into just shade and light;\n\nWhen mellowing years their full perfection give,\n\nAnd each bold figure just begins to live,\n\nThe treacherous colours the fair art betray,\n\nAnd all the bright creation fades away!\n\nUnhappy wit, like most mistaken things,\n\nAtones not for that envy which it brings.\n\nIn youth alone its empty praise we boast,\n\nBut soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost:\n\nLike some fair flow'r the early spring supplies,\n\nThat gaily blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies.\n\nWhat is this wit, which must our cares employ?\n\nThe owner's wife, that other men enjoy;\n\nThen most our trouble still when most admir'd,\n\nAnd still the more we give, the more requir'd;\n\nWhose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease,\n\nSure some to vex, but never all to please;\n\n'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun;\n\nBy fools 'tis hated, and by knaves undone!\n\nIf wit so much from ign'rance undergo,\n\nAh let not learning too commence its foe!\n\nOf old, those met rewards who could excel,\n\nAnd such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well:\n\nThough triumphs were to gen'rals only due,\n\nCrowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too.\n\nNow, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown,\n\nEmploy their pains to spurn some others down;\n\nAnd while self-love each jealous writer rules,\n\nContending wits become the sport of fools:\n\nBut still the worst with most regret commend,\n\nFor each ill author is as bad a friend.\n\nTo what base ends, and by what abject ways,\n\nAre mortals urg'd through sacred lust of praise!\n\nAh ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,\n\nNor in the critic let the man be lost!\n\nGood nature and good sense must ever join;\n\nTo err is human; to forgive, divine.\n\nBut if in noble minds some dregs remain,\n\nNot yet purg'd off, of spleen and sour disdain,\n\nDischarge that rage on more provoking crimes,\n\nNor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.\n\nNo pardon vile obscenity should find,\n\nThough wit and art conspire to move your mind;\n\nBut dulness with obscenity must prove\n\nAs shameful sure as impotence in love.\n\nIn the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,\n\nSprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase:\n\nWhen love was all an easy monarch's care;\n\nSeldom at council, never in a war:\n\nJilts ruled the state, and statesmen farces writ;\n\nNay wits had pensions, and young Lords had wit:\n\nThe fair sat panting at a courtier's play,\n\nAnd not a mask went unimprov'd away:\n\nThe modest fan was lifted up no more,\n\nAnd virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before.\n\nThe following licence of a foreign reign\n\nDid all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;\n\nThen unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,\n\nAnd taught more pleasant methods of salvation;\n\nWhere Heav'n's free subjects might their rights dispute,\n\nLest God himself should seem too absolute:\n\nPulpits their sacred satire learned to spare,\n\nAnd Vice admired to find a flatt'rer there!\n\nEncourag'd thus, wit's Titans brav'd the skies,\n\nAnd the press groan'd with licenc'd blasphemies.\n\nThese monsters, critics! with your darts engage,\n\nHere point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!\n\nYet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice,\n\nWill needs mistake an author into vice;\n\nAll seems infected that th' infected spy,\n\nAs all looks yellow to the jaundic'd eye.\n\nPart 3"
