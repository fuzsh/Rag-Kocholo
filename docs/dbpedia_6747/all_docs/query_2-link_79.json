        "text": "I'm sure you've all heard the crazy stories about Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) and his family.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that Lucrezia's second husband, Alfonso Duke of Bisceglia, whom she actually loved, was strangled in bed by Cesare's private assassin Micheletto Correglia while he was recovering from a failed assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square. So it was of no use that his wife and sister had provided him with home-cooked food to prevent him from being poisoned.\n\nAlso through Micheletto Correglia, Cesare had the 16-year-old Duke of Faenza, who was imprisoned in Castel Sant'Angelo, murdered, as well as his brother. Later he had the papal captain Paolo Orsini murdered and then also the papal secretary Troche, this again by Correglia, with Cesare secretly watching.\n\nBut the Borgia's favorite means of killing was poison. They preferred to use it to kill cardinals, prelates and bishops. Cesare liked to consult his captain, Lorenz Beheim, about the effects of poisons added to food, and he was interested in the length of time it took to reach the fatal purpose (1 or 4 or 6 months).\n\nLucrezia was more a puppet of Borgia politics than a criminal perpetrator, being married to men who seemed helpful to the Borgia power politics, which was in principle a common method in aristocracy. After two broken engagements, she was married at the age of 14 to Giovanni Sforza of Milan and then, after the annulment of the marriage by her father, to the 17-year-old Alfonso di Bisceglia, which was not beneficial to his health, since he was murdered - see above - by Cesare's hitman. She was then married for the third time to Alfonso d'Este, at incredible financial expense - each of her hats alone cost 10,000 ducats. When calculating today's purchasing power of 10,000 ducats, I found on the internet the figure of several 100,000 euros, but I cannot guarantee this, though at least the order of size should be correct, since the indicated gold value of 10,000 ducats is also so high. By Borgia standards, this was peanuts, considering that a Borgia son could well be adorned with a jewel worth 150,000 ducats.\n\nThat Lucrezia had ... with her father and her brother is narrated by her shunned first husband Giovanni Sforza, whose marriage had been annulled (see above) because of alleged impotence. This angered Giovanni so much that he spread the word about his ex-wife that the pope \"wanted his daughter for himself\" and had \"sexual intercourse with her countless times.\"\n\nI myself consider these stories to be realistic. Why would guys like Alexander Borgia and Cesare Borgia shy away from what is common in many apparently normal families that are otherwise more law-abiding than the Borgias, who knew no boundaries at all? I myself could have had intercourse with my sister, but I refrained (though not for moral reasons regarding incest but because she was married).\n\nAccording to papal master of ceremonies Johann Burkard, the Borgias held \"tournaments\" with coitating stallions and mares, during which father and daughter allegedly became so excited that they locked themselves in a palace room together for an hour. This could be made up - or not. But what about the \"whores' tournament\", in which 50 of the most beautiful whores of Rome (there were several 10,000 in the city at the time) collected chestnuts naked on the floor before the spectators actively enjoyed the ......, with Lucrezia presiding with her father on a podium and distributing prizes? This story has been handed down in several sources.\n\nPope Alexander himself is said to have died by a poison that he and Cesare had intended for another, Cardinal Adriano Castellesi, at a banquet in his villa. This accidental suicide is assumed by many experts.\n\nI myself consider these stories to be realistic. Why would guys like Alexander Borgia and Cesare Borgia shy away from what is common in many apparently normal families that are otherwise more law-abiding than the Borgias, who knew no boundaries at all? I myself could have had intercourse with my sister, but I refrained (though not for moral reasons regarding incest but because she was married).\n\nI can't tell if you're trying to be funny or just trolling. But incest is not common in most normal families. In fact in most countries it's a crime. Also just because a family has no qualms about assassination doesn't mean they have no morals at all. Even some of the most evil people can have their own moral code. Genghis Khan killed millions but raised the son his wife had after she was abducted and ..... by a rival clan, as his own. I'd say it's very likely that Rodrigo and Cesare would draw the line at incest. It's strange because most of your response is very logical and sound but then you say something like that. If the rest of your post wasn't so knowledgeable and articulate I would've just dismissed you as a troll.\n\nI can't tell if you're trying to be funny or just trolling. But incest is not common in most normal families. In fact in most countries it's a crime\n\nI am very surprised at your inability to read my text correctly. I wrote \"apparently normal families\", which means that these families outwardly give the appearance of normality, but in secret have very special behaviors. At least that's how I meant it (I'm not a native speaker).\n\nAnd I didn't write anything about \"common\" either, but used the word \"many\", which, considering the millions of families, may well refer to a very small minority. Anyway, according to sociological studies on incest, the \"dark figure is very high\".\n\nSo I would be pleased if you apologize for the troll accusation which borders on slander.\n\nAnd as for your attempt to exclude the Borgia family from the accusation of incest, I think that is rather blue-eyed. Unrestrained when it comes to murder, but recoiling when it comes to incest...? Sorry, that's very weak. We are talking about Alexander and Cesare Borgia, two of the most lascivious fellows in Italy in those days, especially Alexander. You seem to have a very moral defense attitude against incest. That is your right, but please do not project your own feelings onto the Borgia family. This is no way to do historical science.\n\nThe Image of Alexander VI and Cesare Borgia in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries on JSTOR\n\nJ. N. Hillgarth, The Image of Alexander VI and Cesare Borgia in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 59 (1996), pp. 119-129\n\nThis article indicates that his reputation was a favorite target of Protestant propagandists.\n\nBy the Earl of Derby about 1640. Discusses Alexander VI dividing the world in half. Does not discuss his reputation directly.\n\nThat article seems incredibly wrong-headed.\n\nThe Borgias mixed secular and, spiritual politics together to achieve significant political and, economic power. They were a de riguer target of polemicists in their own time as a result.\n\nAs a result, anything that \"protestant commentators\" writing centuries after the fact are doing to \"revile\" the Borgia papcy is just so much meaningless static. In the first place, it's all based on things written and, propagated by the Borgias' political rivals during their own heyday and, in the second, it's just utterly irrelevant boosterism and, anti-papal noise.\n\nThe Catholic church and Papacy under the Borgias was significantly different in almost every regard from the Catholic Church being railed against by 17th century protestants. For one thing, the Doctrine of Papal Infallibility was gaining steam which meant that Protestants and others needed some sort of example to point to in order to demonstrate that Popes could be fallible.\n\nWhat better example than the oft attacked and only a few decades gone Borgias?\n\n\"But I shall conclude with a Copy of the Grant made by Pope Alexander the 6th (Father to Caesar Borgia) of the Indies to Ferdinando King of Spain, and his Heirs for ever, wherein you may read at large the pride of the Popes in the Power they pretend to.\"\n\nThis is from the dialogue I quoted by the Earl of Derby, which actually must be from the 1660s after the Restoration. It does not revile Alexander VI, but just mentions that he is the father of Caesar Borgia, who as notorious in his own right. The corruption of the Catholic Church and Alexander VI are only aluded to. However, there is a point that that pope was chosen in an anti-Catholic dialogue. I would agree that the Catholic Church and popes of that period were different from Alexander VI, but that would not stop Protestants from talking about Alexander VI. The dialogue also quotes the whole grant of the Indies to Spain (England's adversary) by that pope. The dialogue is supposed to be between a Protestant and Catholic royalist after the eventual victory over the Puritans.\n\nThis is one example of Alexander VI being used by a Protestant propagandist. I would assume the article quoted was not making thing up and there were others."
