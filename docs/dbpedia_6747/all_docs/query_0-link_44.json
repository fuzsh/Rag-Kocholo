        "text": "Charles VIII conquers Naples, which he loses again, in 1495.\n\nFerdinand of Naples dies on January 25, 1494, and is succeeded by his son, Alfonso II.\n\nIn October 1494, Lodovico Sforza becomes Duke of Milan and is immediately challenged by Alfonso II, who also has a claim on Milan. Lodovico decides to remove this threat by inciting Charles to take up Innocent’s offer.\n\nCharles VIII crosses the Alps in September 1494 with a massive army of 30,000 men to reclaim the kingdom of Naples. They pass peacefully through the territory of Milan and no doubt expect to do the same through Florence’s Tuscan lands. France’s quarrel is only with Naples. Alfonso de Aragon abdicates in favour of his son Ferdinand, who, unable to resist the French army, flees Naples in February 1495. Charles becomes king of Naples but has to return to France and leaves a governor in his place. This gives Ferdinand the opportunity to regain the throne in July 1495. Ferdinand dies in 1496 and is succeeded by his uncle Frederick. Charles VIII dies in 1498.

Sensing a crisis, the young Piero de’ Medici, cedes several key castles, together with the ports of Pisa and Livorno to the French king.\n\nThe Florentine signoria protest that Piero has no authority to cede these possessions, but it is too late. The French enter Florence and occupy Pisa before moving on south.\n\nWhen Piero returns to Florence, he is summoned to appear before the signoria. He makes the mistake of doing so with an armed guard. The city’s bell is tolled to call the people to the piazza. A mob ransacks the Medici palace. Piero and his two brothers escape from the city. It is nearly twenty years before his family returns.\n\nThe Florentines establish a republican government. Bernardo Rucellai and other members of the Florentine oligarchy then acted as ambassadors to negotiate a peaceful accord with Charles. France will prove to be Florence’s only hope to recoup its territories and maintain the republic. Source: Historyworld.net.

They are also joined by their cousin Giulio, the future pope Clement VII.\n\nThey return to their palace in the Via Larga and restore their coat of arms. They also take over the government of the city. Giuliano will rule it until his death in 1516.\n\nAfter that, Florence would be ruled by his nephew Lorenzo (1492-1519) grandson of Lorenzo the Magnificent and father of Alessandro de Medici. Lorenzo rules Florence between 1516-1519.\n\nAfter Lorenzo’s death, Pope Leo X sent his cousin Giulio (cardinal at the time), to rule the city. When Giulio became pope in 1523, he continued to rule Florence and lost it temporarily when Rome was sacked by the troops of Charles V in 1527.\n\nOn Macchiavelli\n\nAfter the return of the Medici, Machiavelli is dismissed from his positions, along with others who had served the republic. He is banished from Florence, and lives on a small estate that he owns at San Casciano, not far from the city. In 1513, he isimprisoned, tortured, and released with a fine.\n\nOn December 10, 1513, Macchiavelli wrote a now-famous letter to his friend Francesco Vettori. He describes with disgust the petty pursuits and dull companions that fill his days. Then he tells how he solaces himself in his miseries:\n\nOn the coming of evening, I return to my house and enter my study; and at the door I take off the day’s clothing, covered with mud and dust, and put on garments regal and courtly; and reclothed appropriately, I enter the ancient courts of ancient men, where, received by them with affection, I feed on that food which only is mine and which I was born for, where I am not ashamed to speak with them and to ask them the reason for their actions; and they in their kindness answer me; and for four hours of time I do not feel boredom, I forget every trouble, I do not dread poverty, I am not frightened by death; entirely I give myself over to them.\n\nAnd because Dante says it does not produce knowledge when we hear but do not remember, I have noted everything in their conversation which has profited me, and have composed a little work On Princedoms, where I go as deeply as I can into considerations on this subject, debating what a princedom is, of what kinds they are, how they are gained, how they are kept, why they are lost. And if ever you can find any of my fantasies pleasing, this one should not displease you; and by a prince, and especially by a new prince, it ought to be welcomed.

He is the second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent who had intervened to make him cardinal in 1489.\n\nHe grants indulgences to those who donated to reconstruct St. Peter’s which practice was challenged by Martin Luther. He seems not to have taken seriously the array of demands for church reform that would quickly grow into the Reformation.\n\nHe borrowed and spent heavily. A significant patron of the arts, upon election Leo is alleged to have said, “Since God has given us the papacy, let us enjoy it.” Under his reign, progress was made on the rebuilding of St. Peter’s, and Raphael decorated the Vatican rooms. Raphael died in 1520, a year before Leo.\n\nLeo also sponsored the poets Baraballo and Mozarello."
