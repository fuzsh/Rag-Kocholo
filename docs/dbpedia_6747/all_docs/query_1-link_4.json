        "text": "St. Alexander I (died c. 115/119, Rome [Italy]?; feast day May 3) was the sixth pope and successor to St. Evaristus. Little is known about Alexander’s rule, which is attested by St. Eusebius (pope 309/310). Some Roman Catholic writers ascribe to him the introduction of holy water and the custom of mixing sacramental wine with water, but this is unlikely. However, he may have made additions to the liturgy. Some believe he was martyred, possibly by decapitation, under the Roman emperor Trajan or Hadrian, but this is improbable. He was succeeded by St. Sixtus I.\n\nPope Alexander I has sometimes been confused with St. Alexander, one of three Roman martyrs buried along the Via Nomentana. Alexander’s jailer, St. Quirinus, and his daughter St. Balbina are said to have been converted by him."
