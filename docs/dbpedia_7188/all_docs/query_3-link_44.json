        "text": "Peacock subscribers aren’t going to care that a few of its new arrivals in August failed at the summer box office just a few months ago. If anything, it worked out in their favor since The Bikeriders and The Fall Guy were both well-reviewed films that may enjoy a digital afterlife. But since The Fall Guy isn’t arriving until August 30, we’ll have to wait until we add it to the list of the best movies on Peacock.\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of other options in the meantime, including the rom-com Marry Me, almost all of the Fast and Furious flicks, and the crime epic Casino. You can find those films and more in our roundup of the best movies on Peacock right now. And remember that some films are only available to Peacock subscribers on the two premium tiers.\n\nCan’t find anything you like on Peacock? Lucky for you, we’ve also curated guides to the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Hulu, and the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nThe Bikeriders (2024)\n\nThe Bikeriders raced though theaters like the law was on the trail of the titular motorcycle gang. That may not have been what Johnny Davis (Tom Hardy) intended when he formed The Vandals as a motorcycle club in the ’60s. Johnny assembles likeminded bikers including Benny (Austin Butler), who soon courts and marries Kathy (Jodie Comer).\n\nThrough the eyes of Kathy and photographer Danny Lyon (Mike Faist), we see the rise and fall of The Vandals. At times, Johnny’s creation threatens to spiral out of his control. And it’s going to take more than just words for Johnny to hold on to his authority over the gang.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 80%\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nStars: Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, Tom Hardy, Michael Shannon, Mike Faist, Norman Reedus\n\nDirector: Jeff Nichols\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 116 minutes\n\nMarry Me (2023)\n\nMarry Me is based on an independent comic by Bobby Crosby that features Jennifer Lopez playing a very J.Lo-like pop star, Katalina “Kat” Valdez. With three failed marriages under her belt, Kat is ready to tie the knot again at one of her concerts to the latest love of her life, Bastian (Maluma). But when Kat discovers that Bastian was unfaithful before the ceremony on stage, she makes an impromptu decision to wed a man in the crowd who was holding a “Marry Me” sign.\n\nThe man in question is Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson), an unassuming teacher whose life is turned upside down when he accepts Kat’s offer to marry him. Rather than breaking off things quickly, they agree to stay together for a while. And without the glare of the media on them, Kat and Charlie start developing real feelings for each other, even if no one expects them to last.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 61%\n\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\n\nStars: Jennifer Lopez, Owen Wilson, Maluma, John Bradley, Chloe Coleman\n\nDirector: Kat Coiro\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 112 minutes\n\nFurious 7 (2015)\n\nAlmost all of the Fast and Furious films are back on Peacock this month, but we’re focusing on Furious 7 because it’s widely regarded as the best movie in the series. This is also where it became more of a spy action franchise. After the events of the previous film, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), are ready to settle down. So too are Dom’s best friend, Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker), and his romantic partner/Dom’s sister, Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster).\n\nUnfortunately for them, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) is looking for payback against Dom and his crew for what happened to his young brother, Owen. Shaw is such a force of nature that he even manages to take out Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Against an enemy like this, Dom’s team needs help. That’s where Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) comes in. He can give “the fam” everything they need to stay ahead of Shaw if they help him track and protect a hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and the dangerous tracking program she created.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 81%\n\nGenre: Action\n\nStars: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Kurt Russell\n\nDirector: James Wan\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 137 minutes\n\nCasino (1995)\n\nMartin Scorsese reunited his Goodfellas co-stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci for another crime epic, Casino, which is closing in on its 30th anniversary. In the ’70s, Sam “Ace” Rothstein (De Niro) is sent by the mafia to run their operations with his friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci), by his side. And while Sam is a high-earner and a crime family veteran, even he isn’t prepared for the level of corruption he finds in Vegas.\n\nSam romances and marries Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone), which starts an incredibly toxic relationship that threatens to destroy both of them. And as the walls close in on Sam thanks to pressure from the law and other criminals, he’s forced to wonder if there’s anyone left in his life he can trust.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 79%\n\nGenre: Crime, Drama\n\nStars: Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 178 minutes\n\nMen In Black (1997)\n\nDespite getting two sequels and a spinoff, none of the follow-ups have managed to be as funny or as good as the original Men in Black. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Agent K, a member of the secretive Men in Black organization that polices and protects aliens living on Earth. While looking for a new recruit, K is impressed by Detective James Darrell Edwards III (Bad Boys: Ride or Die‘s Will Smith) after he stumbles upon a potential alien threat to the world.\n\nAfter James signs up to be Agent J, he and K are forced to contend with The Bug (Vincent D’Onofrio), a roach-like alien masquerading as a human. K and J’s search leads them to coroner Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino), a woman who has had her own close encounters with aliens. But if K and J can’t crack the mystery, then The Bug’s actions may lead to the destruction of Earth.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 91%\n\nGenre: Sci-fi, Comedy, Action\n\nStars: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Linda Fiorentino, Vincent D’Onofrio, Rip Torn\n\nDirector: Barry Sonnenfeld\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 98 minutes\n\nCocaine Bear (2023)\n\nWhile it’s true that there was a real “Cocaine Bear,” director Elizabeth Banks and her collaborators took some creative license with the movie of the same name. The title character of Cocaine Bear is basically Jaws with legs in the woods, and he’ll kill anyone who gets in the way of his next cocaine hit.\n\nSari (Keri Russell) is a single mom who gets caught up in this mess when her daughter, Dee Dee (Brooklynn Prince). To complicate things even further, a fixer named Daveed (O’Shea Jackson Jr.) has been sent by his boss to retrieve the missing cocaine from the woods. And even Daveed isn’t prepared to face an increasingly aggressive bear hopped up on cocaine.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 66%\n\nGenre: Horror, Comedy\n\nStars: Keri Russell, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Christian Convery, Alden Ehrenreich, Brooklynn Prince\n\nDirector: Elizabeth Banks\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes\n\nThe Cabin in the Woods (2011)\n\nWhat if there was a reason for every single horror movie cliche that you’ve ever seen? The Cabin in the Woods offers up an explanation, as five friends find themselves embodying the character archetypes from those stories. Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), Curt Vaughan (Furiosa‘s Chris Hemsworth), Jules Louden (Anna Hutchison), Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz), and Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams) don’t realize something’s wrong until it’s too late to run away.\n\nAs the friends start dropping one-by-one, the survivors inadvertently discover why they’ve been subjected to such evil. And why they may have to lay down their lives for the greater good.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 92%\n\nGenre: Horror, Comedy\n\nStars: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams\n\nDirector: Drew Goddard\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 95 minutes\n\nPuss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\n\nCats supposedly have nine lives, and that’s something that Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) has used to his advantage for years. But in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, the title character is on his last life, and he’s understandably scared. He even gives up his life of adventure just to play things safe.\n\nWhen Puss discovers that a wishing star may be able to restore the eight lives that he lost, he embarks on what could be his final quest. The problem is that Puss isn’t the only one who wants or needs the wishing star, and he’ll have to face his mortality one way or another.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 95%\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nStars: Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone\n\nDirector: Joel Crawford\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 102 minutes\n\n3:10 to Yuma (2007)\n\n3:10 to Yuma is the second adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s story, and director James Mangold was up to the task of updating this Western tale. In 1884, a rancher named Dan Evans (Christian Bale) has the misfortune of being robbed of his horses by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). Although Ben spares Dan’s life, he leaves him desperate for money.\n\nWhen Ben is arrested, Dan accepts a significant payment to join the posse who are supposed to deliver their prisoner to the train referenced in the title of this movie. However, a lot of people want Ben dead before he can get there, and he won’t stop trying to get away.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 89%\n\nGenre: Western\n\nStars: Christian Bale, Russell Crowe, Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 122 minutes\n\nFarewell, My Lovely (1975)\n\nRaymond Chandler’s hard-boiled private detective, Philip Marlowe, isn’t exactly in vogue anymore. But the classics never truly go out of style. In the 1975 adaptation of Chandler’s Farewell, My Lovely, Robert Mitchum steps into the role of Philip as he finds himself in the midst of two difficult cases that may be related.\n\nIn the first, a bank robber named Moose Malloy (Jack O’Halloran) hires Phillip to find his missing girlfriend, Velma (Charlotte Rampling). In the second case, Phillip is helpless to prevent the murder of his client, Lindsay Marriott (John O’Leary). Not even police intimidation can keep Phillip from finding answers and solving the mystery."
