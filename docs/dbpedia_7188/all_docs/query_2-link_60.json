        "text": "Disney+ is a great place to stream some of the best movies. While animated blockbusters are what Disney is best known for, there is also plenty of genre variety on the streamer. With Marvel Studios superhero capers, Lucasfilm’s Star Wars space operas, and National Geographic’s wealth of inspiring and educational documentaries, audiences are spoiled for choice.\n\nThe streamer’s impressive catalog can make it tough for viewers to pick something for movie night. Thankfully, there is more than enough to suit the tastes of every demographic, and this monthly guide focuses on some of the best movies on Disney+ right now.\n\nIf you haven’t considered it already, the Disney Bundle is worth your money. This package deal gives customers access to Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for just $13 a month. It’s a great overall value.\n\nIf you want to expand your search, we’ve also rounded up the best shows on Disney+, as well as the best movies on Netflix, the best movies on Amazon Prime, and the best movies on Hulu.\n\nYoung Woman and the Sea (2024)\n\n129m\n\nGenre\n\nHistory, Drama\n\nStars\n\nDaisy Ridley, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Stephen Graham\n\nDirected by\n\nJoachim Rønning\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe sports drama Young Woman and the Sea was originally a Disney+ original movie until the company opted for a theatrical release following successful test screenings. Directed by Joachim Rønning (Kon-Tiki, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales), the story follows the journey of real-life competitive swimmer Gertrude “Trudy” Ederle.\n\nThe movie chronicles her life, from overcoming a near-fatal case of measles as a child to her rise as an Olympic athlete. Young Woman and the Sea received a strong critical reception for its inspirational retelling of Ederle’s life. Bolstered by Daisy Ridley’s lively lead performance, Young Woman and the Sea is a must-watch for fans of biographical sports dramas.\n\nX-Men: First Class (2011)\n\n132m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Science Fiction, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nJames McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon\n\nDirected by\n\nMatthew Vaughn\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nFor audiences wanting more mutant action after Deadpool & Wolverine, X-Men: First Class is essential. Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass, Kingsman: The Secret Service), this origin story mainly follows the growing bond and eventual rift between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender).\n\nWhile Xavier and Magneto’s recruited mutants gradually take sides, Hellfire Club leader Sebastian Shaw is dead set on sparking nuclear war amid the Cuban Missile Crisis. X-Men: First Class remains one of the best live-action portrayals of the mutant team thanks to its terrific ensemble cast. It juggles its characters well, and using the 1960s as a backdrop makes First Class an excellent superhero-themed period piece.\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)\n\n132m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nHugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender\n\nDirected by\n\nBryan Singer\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nMatching First Class was no easy task, but X-Men: Days of Future Past achieved that and more. Directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Bohemian Rhapsody), this sequel sees Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) travel back to 1973 to prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nJoining the past versions of the heroes from First Class with the classic iterations from the 2000s movies, the team fights to prevent a dystopic future where robot Sentinels slaughter humans and mutants alike. X-Men: Days of Future Past received strong reviews for its striking visuals, exciting action sequences, and the increased scope of its story. It raised its stakes to postapocalyptic levels without feeling derivative and did justice to Chris Claremont and John Byrne’s acclaimed comic book arc of the same name.\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987)\n\n99m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Family, Fantasy, Comedy, Romance\n\nStars\n\nCary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin\n\nDirected by\n\nRob Reiner\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe Princess Bride is a 1980s classic that’s aged incredibly well. Directed by Rob Reiner and adapted from William Goldman’s 1973 novel, it tells the tale of the farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes) and Buttercup (Robin Wright) — the titular bride — who fall in love and go to great lengths to reunite.\n\nWestley and his group of adventurers must rescue her from her arranged marriage to the evil Prince Humperdinck. The Princess Bride is a timeless, acclaimed movie that has the perfect mix of fantasy, romance, comedy, action and adventure. Despite its seemingly simple premise, it’s a story that can appeal to anybody and gives the otherwise tired “damsel-in-distress” trope a colorful spin.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox (2009)\n\n87m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Animation, Comedy, Family\n\nStars\n\nGeorge Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman\n\nDirected by\n\nWes Anderson\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nDirector Wes Anderson is known for his unique visual style and eccentric storytelling, and his 2009 adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr. Fox is no exception. The plot revolves around the adventures of a fox (Wolfs‘ George Clooney) working as a newspaper columnist tempted by his past as a thief.\n\nAfter a string of heists on a group of farmers goes wrong, Mr. Fox, his family, and his community find themselves hunted. Fantastic Mr. Fox earned critical acclaim partly for its impressive stop-motion animation and art direction. The story was similarly praised for using the animation medium and anthropomorphic cast to convey themes of class struggles and societal norms.\n\nLet It Be (1970)\n\n81m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary, Music\n\nStars\n\nJohn Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison\n\nDirected by\n\nMichael Lindsay-Hogg\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nFor over 50 years, director Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s Let It Be could be found almost exclusively as bootleg copies. Thankfully, a 4K restoration of this Beatles time capsule was finally made available on Disney+.\n\nLet It Be records The Beatles’ rehearsal sessions from January 1969 for the eponymous album, which was initially titled Get Back. The documentary was originally released after the band’s breakup in 1970, but every attempt to rerelease it on home video formats since the 1980s failed. Let It Be is an insightful retrospective and chronicles an important part of the band’s history.\n\nJim Henson Idea Man (2024)\n\n108m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nJim Henson, Frank Oz, Dave Goelz\n\nDirected by\n\nRon Howard\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nJim Henson was one of the most influential puppeteers for creating now-iconic franchises like The Muppets, Sesame Street, and The Dark Crystal.

Thanks to its charming premise and Hanks’ hilarious and lively performance, it holds up well today as a comedy classic.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)\n\n143m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Fantasy, Action\n\nStars\n\nJohnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley\n\nDirected by\n\nGore Verbinski\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean movies are still the studio’s most lucrative attempts at adapting iconic Disney park rides.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl stands as the series’ best, taking advantage of the novelty behind building an engaging story around a theme park ride. The movie was well-received for its swashbuckling tone and spirited performances by the main cast.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012)\n\n136m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nAndrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans\n\nDirected by\n\nMarc Webb\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThough Sony’s post-Sam Raimi reboot didn’t pan out as hoped, Marc Webb’s first take in The Amazing Spider-Man was a promising start. Led by Andrew Garfield as the titular hero, it follows Peter Parker’s struggles to balance his new dual life while attempting to uncover a conspiracy surrounding his parents’ disappearances,. This leads to a violent clash against Dr. Curt Connors’ (Rhys Ifans) beastly persona the Lizard. Peter’s love interest Gwen Stacy (Poor Things‘ Emma Stone) also gets caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man features a passionate performance by Garfield, as he carries a convincing coming-of-age story amid the action. Similarly, Stone’s casting as Gwen Stacy is pitch-perfect. She’s convincing character on her own merits while maintaining an electric chemistry with Garfield’s Peter.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\n141m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo\n\nDirected by\n\nJoss Whedon\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nJoss Whedon’s The Avengers was always going to be a tough act to follow, but Age of Ultron was still a respectable sophomore entry. Now with more teamwork experience under their belts, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) tackle a new breed of villain.\n\nA beast of Tony Stark’s making, the A.I. Ultron goes rogue and aims to incite a mass extinction event. While not as convincing as its predecessor, partly due to a less interesting villain, Avengers: Age of Ultron is entertaining thanks to the team’s growing dynamics. Dramatic special effects and Elizabeth Olsen’s introduction as Wanda Maximoff also helped the movie feel like a milestone event in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nToy Story 2 (1999)\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Comedy, Family\n\nStars\n\nTom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack\n\nDirected by\n\nJohn Lasseter\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nEven with the first Toy Story‘s acclaim, the sequel more than lived up to its expectations.

The movie tells the story of the first Black astronauts who broke through racial barriers during the early days of the Civil Rights movement to become key figures within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including Guion Bluford, Ed Dwight, and Charles Bolden.\n\nIt’s an enlightening and fascinating watch that revisits this story through a combination of decades’ worth of film archives and interview materials. The Space Race is a compelling documentary movie that covers a lesser-known aspect of American history.\n\nX2 (2003)\n\n133m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nHugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen\n\nDirected by\n\nBryan Singer\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe early 2000s continued to be kind to one of Marvel Comics’ most iconic superhero teams with X2: X-Men United.

X-Men details how several of the iconic Marvel mutants joined Professor Charles Xavier (Star Trek: The Next Generation‘s Patrick Stewart) and his titular team while focusing particularly on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin).\n\nXavier and his mutant allies find themselves in the middle of a violent conflict with the more extreme Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto (played by Ian McKellen). Director Bryan Singer’s X-Men is a nostalgic watch in the modern age, filled with action and a packed ensemble cast. It contains just the right amount of early 2000s campiness to be an engaging story even today.\n\nThe Wolverine (2013)\n\n126m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Science Fiction, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nHugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Mangold\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nFollowing up on the disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine, director James Mangold steps in to put the titular mutant hero’s story on the right track with The Wolverine. The movie sees Logan travel to modern-day Japan in the aftermath of X-Men: The Last Stand, where the hero has to deal with a dangerous nemesis without the benefit of his regenerative abilities, all while grappling with a sense of guilt over Jean Grey’s death.\n\nWhile not the most compelling X-Men movie or Logan’s most engrossing solo story, The Wolverine was a solid and welcome return to form that leans into its dramatic action sequences. It does the character justice while boasting some striking production design.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)\n\n132m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nSimu Liu, Awkwafina, Zhang Meng'er\n\nDirected by\n\nDestin Daniel Cretton\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nEven though the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been growing steadily more stale in recent years, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stands as a bright spot for many longtime fans. Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, the movie tells a story of self-discovery for the titular hero (played by Simu Liu) as he comes into conflict with his father, Wenwu (played by Tony Leung), when he and his terrorist organization attempt to invade a mystical village.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings was seen as a refreshing new perspective from which to view the MCU, using its hero to incorporate more Asian culture into this superhero world. Leung was widely praised for hisstandout performance in the movie, which is a welcome change considering the franchise’s issues of producing mostly bland villains. Likewise, its martial arts sequences and action set pieces were well-received.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)\n\n155m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nHarrison Ford, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Mangold\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe beloved Harrison Ford closes out his tenure as the adventurous archeologist in director James Mangold’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. In this final outing, Indy and his estranged goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) team up in a race against time to find a dangerous ancient artifact.\n\nNazi scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) intends to uncover this mysterious tool to change the outcome of World War II. Though the movie had a comparatively lukewarm reception when looking at more celebrated features like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dial of Destiny still shows why Ford succeeded in making the swashbuckling action hero a household name.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home (2019)\n\n129m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nTom Holland, Samuel L. Jackson, Jake Gyllenhaal\n\nDirected by\n\nJon Watts\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe streaming availability for Spider-Man movies isn’t always clear-cut due to the complicated licensing rights between Disney/Marvel Studios and Sony. However, Disney+ now adds director Jon Watts’ sophomore endeavor from his trilogy with Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nPeter Parker (Tom Holland) and his friends find themselves facing catastrophic supervillain threats while on a school trip across Europe, with the young man struggling to balance his life as a student with that of a hero with deadly serious responsibilities.

Led by the funny and charismatic Ryan Reynolds as the titular antihero, the movie follows the tragic origins of Wade Wilson and his relentless hunt for the man who ruined his life.\n\nAs tragic as his origins are, Deadpool seamlessly weaves in the character’s signature raunchy comedic edge from the comic book source material. The movie’s success further popularized the idea of R-rated superhero productions, with Reynolds’ casting proving to be a match made in heaven.\n\nDeadpool 2 (2018)\n\n66%\n\n7.7/10\n\n120m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Comedy, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nRyan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin\n\nDirected by\n\nDavid Leitch\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nDirector David Leitch takes the reins for Deadpool 2, which sees the beloved Merc With a Mouth take on a wider array of threats from the X-Men universe. Wade forces the X-Force superhero team to help save a young mutant boy from a ruthless time-traveling soldier named Cable (Josh Brolin).\n\nOverall, Deadpool 2 doubles down on the action and comedic elements that made the original such a hit, and it largely pays off. Reynolds’ performance as the foul-mouthed mercenary with a heart of gold is as charismatic as fans would hope, and his chemistry with Brolin’s Cable is effortlessly entertaining.\n\nLogan (2017)\n\n77%\n\n8.1/10\n\n137m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Drama, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nHugh Jackman, Dafne Keen, Patrick Stewart\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Mangold\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nPerhaps one of the best superhero movies in general, director James Mangold brought to screen Wolverine’s best theatrical outing in Logan. Set in an alternate canon separate from the mainline X-Men movies, this gritty tale sees a punished and battered Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) in a post-apocalyptic countryside where mutants are vehemently persecuted, killed, and experimented on for nefarious purposes.\n\nAlong the way, the aged pair ends up defending a young mutant girl named Laura from the mutant-hunting Reavers. A masterful blend of the superhero, neo-noir, and Western film genres and bolstered by Oscar-worthy performances from Jackman and Stewart, Logan is one of the most impactful comic book movies since The Dark Knight.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2017)\n\n133m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction, Drama\n\nStars\n\nTom Holland, Michael Keaton, Robert Downey Jr.\n\nDirected by\n\nJon Watts\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nAs the most lucrative singular superhero in pop culture, it was only a matter of time before Spider-Man was rebooted into Marvel Studios’ MCU. Tom Holland’s iteration of the Wall-Crawler came in Captain America: Civil War, but Spider-Man: Homecoming is the hero’s first solo outing.\n\nDirected by Jon Watts, Peter finds himself grappling with the burden of being a responsible hero who still has to balance his day-to-day life as a high schooler, and he’s faced with Michael Keaton’s imposing Vulture as the villain leads crime sprees powered by alien technology. Spider-Man: Homecoming was a solid debut for the MCU’s rendition of this young hero, with Keaton’s villainous performance being a highlight.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)\n\n150m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Adventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nChris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Gunn\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nAfter an extended delay, James Gunn finally came back to put his finishing touch on the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy with Vol. 3. Set after the events of Avengers: Infinite War and Endgame, Quill and the rest of the misfit superhero crew are still dealing with the death of their timeline’s Gamora.\n\nNow joined by an alternate version of Gamora introduced in Endgame, the Guardians take off on a mission to rescue Rocket Raccoon from the High Evolutionary (played by Chukwudi Iwuji), an alien cyborg scientist who seeks to create his twisted idea of a perfect society. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has been praised for its relentlessly emotional approach and sendoff for this beloved team of underdog superheroes.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)\n\n137m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Adventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nChris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Gunn\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nFollowing up on the immense critical and commercial success of the original installment, James Gunn returns to the directing chair for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. The movie takes place not long after the events of the first outing, with the dynamic main cast members (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel) reprising their roles as an unlikely collection of superheroes. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the titular spacefaring team get involved in helping Peter Quill uncover the mystery of his parentage. This sophomore venture was well-received for building on the endearing relationships between the ragtag bunch of heroes and doubling down on the underlying emotional theme of the found family.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Science Fiction, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nChris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Gunn\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nJames Gunn and co. have wrapped up their beloved trilogy of movies, and the original Guardians of the Galaxy still holds up well today. Released in 2014 not long after the hype of The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy successfully raised the bar at the time for how creative superhero team-up movies can be. Starring Chris Pratt, Zoë Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel, this MCU caper follows an unlikely group of antiheroes-turned-heroes who find themselves on the run when they steal one of the most important artifacts in the universe. What spawned into some of the strongest movies in Marvel Studios’ catalog, James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy managed to turn a ragtag group of characters into household names.\n\nStar Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\n68%\n\n7.6/10\n\n140m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nHayden Christensen, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nWhile George Lucas’ Star Wars Prequel Trilogy was largely seen as uneven, Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith ended it on a strong note. Set during the waning days of the Clone Wars with the Republic fighting off the Separatists, Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor) deal with a myriad of grim revelations threatening the stability and well-being of the galaxy. Between General Grievous wreaking mayhem as General of the Separatist army; Palpatine being outed as the Sith’s shadow puppet master; and two brothers-in-arms being turned cruelly against each other, this sci-fi epic is filled with dramatic spectacle. Revenge of the Sith lives up to the space opera atmosphere of the franchise and is packed with emotional weight to transition seamlessly into A New Hope.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water (2022)\n\n192m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Adventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nSam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Cameron\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nIt was over a decade in the making, but director James Cameron finally followed up on 2009’s Avatar with The Way of Water. The movie was released to resounding commercial success, once again pushing the boundaries of visual effects in filmmaking. Avatar: The Way of Water sees Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña return as the Na’vi duo faces a renewed threat of human invasion. The two seek refuge among the aquatic Metkayina clan, expanding upon this still-budding universe’s expansive worldbuilding. The Way of Water managing to up the visual flair from its predecessor is quite the feat, considering the 2009 film’s effects still hold up fairly well.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\n\n115m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nHarrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman\n\nDirected by\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nIn preparation for Harrison Ford’s last hurrah as Indiana Jones, Disney+ is adding the series’ beloved classics. Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, Raiders of the Lost Ark marks the debut of the fan-favorite adventurer trying to stop Nazi forces from securing a dangerous treasure.\n\nThe movie was revolutionary for its time, pushing the boundaries for action set pieces and the evolution of the pulpy adventure genre. Indiana Jones is still an iconic character, with the swashbuckling archeologist’s first theatrical outing holding up well even today.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\n\n118m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nHarrison Ford, Kate Capshaw, Ke Huy Quan\n\nDirected by\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg followed up on the blockbuster hit that was Raiders with the solid Temple of Doom. The plot follows Harrison Ford’s treasure-hunting adventurer arriving in India to retrieve a mystical stone and stop a bloodthirsty cult. The local villagers are desperate for Indy’s help, as the Thugee cult indulges in ritual sacrifices, sacrifices, and blood magic.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was well-received for its intense new story and darker approach, though, it was more controversial in the ’80s for its comparatively bleak atmosphere to Raiders.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)\n\n127m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nHarrison Ford, Sean Connery, Denholm Elliott\n\nDirected by\n\nSteven Spielberg\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nOnce again helmed by Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a strong finish to the original three movies. While Temple of Doom was technically a prequel to Raiders, Last Crusade moves the timeline forward as Indy travels around the world to rescue his missing father Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery).\n\nJones Sr. went missing on a hunt for the Holy Grail and was held hostage by Nazis. Temple of Doom retroactively received the positive reception it deserved, but Last Crusade does well to reintegrate the lighter, swashbuckling atmosphere of the first movie.\n\nSpider-Man 2 (2004)\n\n127m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nTobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco\n\nDirected by\n\nSam Raimi\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nDisney+’s Spider-Man catalog continues to grow, including Sam Raimi’s sophomore effort. Now with two years under his belt as New York City’s neighborhood hero, Spider-Man 2 has the character go up against the infamous Doctor Octopus. In the wake of the tragic death of Otto Octavius’ wife, he dons this villainous persona to recreate the unstable experiment that killed her. It’s tough for any movie to follow up on the praise of its predecessor, but Spider-Man 2 was widely acclaimed as the best in Raimi’s trilogy. The story is an emotionally powerful continuation of Peter’s character arc, filled with tragedy, redemption, and triumphant perseverance.\n\nSpider-Man (2002)\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nFantasy, Action\n\nStars\n\nTobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst\n\nDirected by\n\nSam Raimi\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nSpider-Man distribution rights are something of a tussle between Sony and Disney, but Disney+ now hosts some excellent legacy movies. Sam Raimi made his mark on the beloved character’s history with the Tobey Maguire-led Spider-Man.\n\nCo-starring Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry Osborne, and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, 2002’s Spider-Man is a soulful origin story with exhilarating action. It still holds up well over 20 years later and is a love letter to the iconic superhero’s comic book lore.\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019)\n\n181m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Science Fiction, Action\n\nStars\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo\n\nDirected by\n\nAnthony Russo, Joe Russo\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe built itself into a wildly lucrative property since 2008’s Iron Man. 11 years later, Avengers: Endgame was released to become a pop-culture phenomenon and the crossover event of the decade.\n\nReeling from the catastrophic events of Infinity War, the Avengers gather who remains to lead a final assault on the galactic conqueror Thanos. The Russo brothers managed to make Endgame a satisfying payoff to 11 years’ worth of mythos and cap off the Infinity Saga.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2018)\n\n149m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo\n\nDirected by\n\nAnthony Russo, Joe Russo\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nOne of the biggest comic book movie events in recent years, Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Infinity War is a jam-packed crossover event. The first in a two-part story with the sequel Endgame, Infinity War finally sees the cosmic threat Thanos — played menacingly by Josh Brolin — take his universe-wide fight to Earth and its mightiest heroes.\n\nIt delivers a long-awaited series of clashes and interactions between various heroes and villains, and is a major bright spot in the MCU’s catalog. Infinity War is constantly tense with action and revelations, setting the stage for this universe’s biggest narrative payoff.\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016)\n\n147m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nChris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson\n\nDirected by\n\nAnthony Russo, Joe Russo\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nMarvel Studio’s Captain America trilogy raised the stakes with The Winter Soldier, often praised as being among the MCU’s best. Steve Roger’s trilogy closer, Civil War, was another solid follow-up this time functioning as a sort of mini Avengers film. In the aftermath of Avengers: Age of Ultron, the titular superhero team finds themselves starkly divided when pressures of international oversight mount over metahuman activity. Effectively divided into “Team Captain America” and “Team Iron Man,” Captain America: Civil War pits friends against friends in an explosive story.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)\n\n162m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nLetitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira\n\nDirected by\n\nRyan Coogler\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nSince the tragic passing of actor Chadwick Boseman, the sequel to Black Panther was always going to have a somber atmosphere about it. However, Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever succeeds in being a tasteful and touching tribute that advanced the story from this corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nIn the wake of King T’Challa’s death, the leaders of the nation need to rally together as Namor — the king of an ancient underwater civilization — leads an assault on Wakanda. Angela Bassett, in particular, leads the film with a commanding performance.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)\n\n136m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nChris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan\n\nDirected by\n\nAnthony Russo, Joe Russo\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nWidely considered to be one of the best movies to come out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an impressive sophomore entry in the titular hero’s film series. While most things in the mainline MCU aren’t particularly gritty, The Winter Soldier serves as an effective action-thriller with some conspiratorial intrigue. In this story, Captain America and Black Widow team up to uncover the seedy underbelly of S.H.I.E.L.D., as well as the sudden reappearance of the ominous Winter Soldier. It’s a refreshing change of pace, injecting a welcome dose of dramatic grit into this vast cinematic world.\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\n135m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Adventure, Action\n\nStars\n\nAlden Ehrenreich, Joonas Suotamo, Woody Harrelson\n\nDirected by\n\nRon Howard\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThough it underwhelmed at the box office, Lucasfilm’s Solo: A Star Wars Story managed to garner a moderately positive critical reception for its efforts. Solo sees the origin story of Han Solo played by Harrison Ford whom fans have long since come to know and love, with actor Alden Ehrenreich putting up an admirable performance as the young scoundrel on a series of high-octane space heists. From street kid to infamously talented bounty hunter, this Han is joined by a colorful and entertaining supporting cast, including Donald Glover’s take on a young Lando Calrissian and Game of Thrones alum Emilia Clarke’s portrayal of original character Qi’ra.\n\nReturn of the Jedi (1983)\n\n135m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nMark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nDirected by\n\nRichard Marquand\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nEven if it doesn’t quite hold up to the astronomically high standards set by A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi is still a deeply rewarding conclusion to one of the greatest movie trilogies. After the revelations and fallout of Empire‘s climactic events between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, the young Jedi sets out on a mission to destroy the Empire’s second Death Star and defeat them for good. The Ewoks may overstay their welcome, but Return of the Jedi is similarly climactic and a resounding finish to Luke’s hero’s journey.\n\nAvatar (2009)\n\n83%\n\n7.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n162m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Fantasy, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nSam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Sigourney Weaver\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Cameron\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nIt’s been a few months since Disney+ pulled Avatar so that people would watch it again in theaters. But now that Avatar: The Way of Water is here, James Cameron’s beautifully realized vision has returned. Sam Worthington stars as Jake Sully, a disabled Marine who is given the chance to replace his late brother in the Avatar program on the alien world, Pandora. Under the orders of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), Jake’s mind inhabits an alien body similar to the Na’vi, Pandora’s native race. It’s Jake’s job to win the trust of the Na’vi, but his growing love for the Na’vi girl, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), makes him realize that he’s on the wrong side.\n\nBlack Panther (2018)\n\n88%\n\n7.3/10\n\n134m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nChadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o\n\nDirected by\n\nRyan Coogler\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nThe original Black Panther movie was an unexpected cultural phenomenon in 2018, on its way toward becoming one of the most successful superhero films ever made. Credit for that in large part goes to director Ryan Coogler, the late Chadwick Boseman as T’Challa/Black Panther, and a terrific supporting cast. Michael B. Jordan’s Killmonger also gave T’Challa an incredibly compelling villain whose own tragic backstory challenges the Black Panther’s worldview. When Killmonger threatens to take over Wakanda itself, T’Challa will have to find it within himself to become the hero and the king that his people need.\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\n65%\n\n7.8/10\n\npg-13\n\n133m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Adventure, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nFelicity Jones, Diego Luna, Alan Tudyk\n\nDirected by\n\nGareth Edwards\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nWith the release of the political sci-fi thriller series Andor, it’s a good time to revisit Rogue One, one of the very best Star Wars movies of the Disney era. Director Gareth Edwards delivered a beautiful stand-alone film that serves as a prequel to the original Star Wars. Felicity Jones headlines the cast as Jyn Erso, a rebellious thief who is recruited to locate a former associate in order to receive a message from her long-missing father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen). But soon enough, Jyn, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), K-2SO (Alan Tudyk), and a ragtag team are on a suicide mission to steal the Death Star plans from the Empire in a desperate bid to save the Rebel Alliance.\n\nToy Story (1995)\n\n95%\n\n8.3/10\n\ng\n\n81m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Adventure, Family, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nTom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles\n\nDirected by\n\nJohn Lasseter\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nToy Story was a game changer in every sense of the word for Pixar, Disney, and the entire animation industry. Prior to 1995, hand-drawn 2D animation reigned supreme. As Disney and Pixar’s first full-length computer-animated film, Toy Story was a revelation at the time. And it is still a technical marvel nearly three decades later. Tom Hanks stars as the voice of Woody, a cowboy action figure who is the favorite toy of a boy named Andy. Or at least he was until space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) came along. Woody’s attempt to get rid of his rival puts both toys in danger. And they can only save each other by working together.\n\nStar Wars (1977)\n\n90%\n\n8.6/10\n\npg\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Action, Science Fiction\n\nStars\n\nMark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nForty -five years ago this week, the original Star Wars hit theaters and changed the movies forever. It was subsequently given the “Episode 4: A New Hope” name, but to the first generation of fans, it all starts here. In a desperate bid to keep Darth Vader (David Prowse with James Earl Jones as Vader’s voice) from retrieving the plans for a super weapon called the Death Star, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hides them with two droids. From there, destiny awaits a restless young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an exiled Jedi called Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), the Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and the scoundrel known as Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Even after all of these years, it’s still a rousing space adventure.\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\n79%\n\n7.9/10\n\npg-13\n\n126m\n\nGenre\n\nAction, Science Fiction, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges\n\nDirected by\n\nJon Favreau\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nBefore Jon Favreau wowed Star Wars fans with The Mandalorian, he helped found the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man. Unlike many of its MCU brethren, this movie feels a lot more grounded as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has an epiphany after getting kidnapped by terrorists in Afghanistan. Instead of selling weapons, Tony decides to create an armored suit unlike anything ever created before under the wary eyes of his employee, Virginia “Pepper” Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his shady business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Iron Man set the template for almost every comic book movie that came after it. And it’s now available to stream in its IMAX-enhanced aspect ratio.\n\nThe Avengers (2012)\n\n69%\n\n8.0/10\n\npg-13\n\n143m\n\nGenre\n\nScience Fiction, Action, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo\n\nDirected by\n\nJoss Whedon\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nIt’s not an exaggeration to say that The Avengers changed the game for superhero movies. Marvel Studios’ first-ever team-up film brought together Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) together under the watchful eye of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to take on Thor’s estranged brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The heroes’ frequent personality clashes are even more engaging than the fights. Regardless, the climactic Battle of New York features the heroes at their best as they take on an alien invasion. It’s almost a perfect superhero film, even though it was upstaged by its sequels.\n\nStar Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\n82%\n\n8.7/10\n\npg\n\n124m\n\nGenre\n\nSci-Fi, Action, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nMark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nDirected by\n\nIrvin Kershner\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\nWidely considered the best installment of the entire sci-fi saga, The Empire Strikes Back is the chapter that featured the most dramatic character arcs of the original trilogy and established both their legacies and the tragic events that intertwined their destinies. Not only that, but it also introduced some of the franchise’s most popular supporting characters, Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett, and featured one of the trilogy’s most memorable battles, set on the frozen planet of Hoth. After the heroic events of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back offered a far more somber exploration of the gritty realities of war against an oppressive, formidable force led by a seemingly indestructible foe: Darth Vader.\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nA University of Houston graduate in Print Media Journalism, Guillermo has covered sports entertainment and practically all forms of geek culture as a freelance writer.\n\nHis young career so far has seen him write about soccer through websites including Read Bundesliga and Bayern Strikes, specializing in FC Bayern Munich.
