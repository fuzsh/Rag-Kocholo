When recently single Steven (Matthew Broderick) moves into his new apartment, cable guy Chip (Jim Carrey) comes to hook him up — and doesn’t let go. This early progenitor of the Judd Apatow factory was directed by Ben Stiller, who also packs himself among a motley crew of mid-’90s actors and comedians including but not limited to Leslie Mann, Janeane Garofalo, David Cross, Jack Black (and Kyle Gass) and George Segal (RIP) among others."
