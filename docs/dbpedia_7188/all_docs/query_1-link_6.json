        "text": "I watched Jim Carrey's The Cable Guy last night. I had always heard it was a disaster of a movie, and those people were mostly right. It had some good funny and/or disturbing bits. But overall, it was kinda middling. What stuck out to me was an early scene where Carrey takes Broderick's character to see a satellite receiver, and does a speech about how the internet is coming.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv_utSYQIFA&t=60s\n\nI know it wasn't news to the more computer savvy people in the mid nineties, but I feel the internet wasn't as mainstream with the normies of the time. I always enjoy when a movie gets its predictions about technology right. Everything Carrey says about the internet came true. Everyone is watching shows/porn, shopping, and playing video games online as a regular everyday thing we now take for granted.\n\nWhat'd you guys think of the Cable Guy?\n\nWhat are some other examples you like of prescient media?\n\nI *loved* Jim Carrey in the 90s. I was 10 when Ace Ventura came out, 11 for the sequel, around the same age for Dumb and Dumber, like peak age to love that type of comedy. I remember seeing Dumb and Dumber and being like ... thats it... there's not a funnier movie possible than this, wrap it up folks. The Cable Guy sticks out to me as one of the first movies I watched where I was kinda disappointed. I think I saw it when I was 12 or 13, I was all in on the \"weird cable technician\" schtick because I was into tech stuff myself, but... man it just didn't land, and I remember my dad saying \"Hm this is a pretty weird movie, this guy is creepy...\" kinda to disarm how I was put off by it, and so that's always been my impression. I haven't seen it since it's HBO run in the late 90s probably.\n\nI love Cable Guy. I think it only had a bad reception when it came out just because people didn't expect it to be dark, but now it's more appreciated as it should be\n\nHow I feel. Loved it when it came out. My family now always asks each other \"what's the score with dinner?\" or whatever else because of Owen Wilson's part. I remember thinking \"yeah sure, Jim\" when he was talking about playing Mortal Kombat with a friend in Vietnam.\n\nThis is one of my fave Carrey movies. We watched it countless times in my house growing up.\n\nYeah, this was a staple with my friends group. Ben Stiller as the twins on the news, so ridiculous.\n\nSo many great moments too. \"Don't do this Stephen. I made you breakfast. Scrambie eggs\".\n\nThe Star Trek bit at Medieval Times still cracks me up.\n\nGoing through the IMDB trivia, one thing I thought was clever was that it's implied Carrey's character was the one who murdered the brother, framing the other brother. It's apparently Carrey's voice on the phone call that's played in one on the court segments, impersonating the brother.\n\nI've watched this movie likely dozens of times and never clued in to that. Damn.\n\nI know it wasn't news to the more computer savvy people in the mid nineties, but I feel the internet wasn't as mainstream with the normies of the time. I always enjoy when a movie gets its predictions about technology right. Everything Carrey says about the internet came true. Everyone is watching shows/porn, shopping, and playing video games online as a regular everyday thing we now take for granted.\n\nI don't really understand what you're saying. How did the movie predict anything, or how was it \"prescient,\" if it was just pointing out stuff that, as you've yourself pointed out, wasn't news to people who were knowledgeable about computers?\n\nIf I ask a few a few scientists and tech people what they think will be the biggest advancements in their field in the next 2-3 years and then include that in a movie, is that a \"prediction?\" I don't think so, they're probably going to be able to name things that are currently being work on and just aren't available yet.\n\nAnd that's the timeframe we're looking at. Like I don't know the dates for every thing Carrey mentions, but the Dreamcast came out like a year or two after Cable Guy. It's not like this was stuff that seemed totally unbelievable at the time of release and took decades to come to fruition.\n\nI've watched this movie likely dozens of times and never clued in to that. Damn.\n\nSame, lol. I wonder it's intended though or just like an Easter egg.\n\nI keep telling younger people that watch media from the 90s and some 80s and think it was way ahead of it's time, it was actually it's time. We were constantly told back then how easier it was going to get and we were experiencing it in real time. 1993 to 2000 internet moved at a crazy pace. All the stuff carrey's character mentions we were already doing pretty much and we could see the trajectory. It's just sooooo much more ubiquitous now. That goes for stories with climate change, sexuality (to an extent), consumerism, etc too\n\nAs for the movie, I remember it getting blasted but I thought it was whatever. Much worse shit was out there like biodome. It really felt like it was used to hate on Carrey just because. It's funny how \"a has been\" was a thing that I don't feel exists anymore\n\nI remember being dragged to it by a bunch of friends who thought Ace Ventura Pet Detective was the funniest thing ever.\n\nI was the only one who enjoyed it, and it definitely put Ben Stiller on the map for me for at least a while. I think it has issues, but most of its failure was that it was a dark comedy. They sure as hell didn't advertise it as one in the UK. You can't blame audiences for thinking it was like his previous movies when that's what the commercials were selling.\n\nI'm glad it wasn't though."
