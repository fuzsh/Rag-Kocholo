Software using docker can be installed using the command line or via graphical interfaces such as Portainer. Software is installed with Docker by downloading an image file containing the application, then creating a copy that sets up its own dependencies and configuration within what is called a container. Without containers you would often need to install different versions of the same programming languages or tools to satisfy the dependencies for the software you want to use which can get complicated.\n\nTools for Self-Hosting\n\nBack to the Top\n\nBack to the Top\n\nContainer is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies(including CPU, memory, file storage, and network connections) so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.\n\nApplication Container Security Guide | NIST (PDF)\n\nContainer Image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application such as the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.\n\nBest places to get Container Images:\n\nDockerHub Container Images\n\nLinuxServer.io Container Images\n\nQuay Container Images\n\nDocker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications.
