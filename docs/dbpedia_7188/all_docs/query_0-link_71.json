Okay?\"\n\n(The Cable Guy) \"So, what are you trying to say?\"\n\n(Matthew Broderick) \"I don't want to be your friend.\"\n\n(Matthew Broderick) \"You're right.

And I'm interested in learning about every detail of the complicated splendor that is you.\"\n\n(Leslie Mann) \"Oh.\"\n\n(Matthew Broderick) \"Dammit. Son of a bitch. The cable's out.\"\n\nAndy Dick as Medieval Times host\n\n(Andy Dick) \"Preferred customer my ASS.\"\n\nBen Stiller as Sam Sweet\n\n(Ben Stiller) \"Oh my God. Oh my God. My twin brother has been shot. I think it was an Asian gang or something -- There was this guy, he looked Asian -- and he was speaking another language, I'm pretty sure it was -- Asian.\"\n\nJack Black as Rick\n\n(Jack Black) \"I have a list here of every cable installer fired in the last four years.
