        "text": "Which cameras are suitable for live streaming?\n\nHow do you know a camera is good for live streaming? Can you use the one you already own? There are many features you should consider when choosing a camera for streaming. While some features are nice to have in a streaming camera, there are four that are simply essential.\n\nFour essential criteria for live streaming cameras\n\n1. Clean HDMI out\n\nTo live stream from a camera, you have to capture the signal coming directly from its HDMI or SDI out port. Along with the video feed, some cameras will also send all the user interface (UI) elements visible on the display (e.g., battery life, exposure, aperture). To be suitable for live streaming, your camera has to be capable of sending a “clean” signal over HDMI, i.e., a signal without any UI elements visible. Unless it’s clean by default, there should be a menu setting you can toggle.\n\nConnector type\n\nHDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is one of the most popular connector types for video. It comes in three varieties: HDMI micro, HDMI mini, and full-size HDMI. Check which one your camera uses and be ready to buy adapters.\n\nThough popular, HDMI connectors are often said to be unreliable, especially the micro and mini varieties. It’s easy to accidentally pull out these cables in the middle of an important event. Additionally, HDMI cables are limited to about 100 ft in length, beyond which the signal starts to degrade.\n\nAnother popular connector is SDI (Serial Digital Interface). SDI is a faster connection than HDMI. SDI cable connectors also offer a physical locking mechanism and can run for distances of up to 300 ft.\n\nSimultaneous streaming and recording\n\nIt’s a good idea to have a backup recording of your live stream, just in case. Keep in mind that some camera models don’t allow simultaneous internal recording and video capture for streaming. A quick way to determine whether your camera can do both is to connect it to a TV and press record on the camera. If the recording starts and you are still able to see the live feed on the TV screen, your camera is able to stream and record simultaneously.\n\nThere is another option when it comes to simultaneous streaming and recording: all-in-one hardware encoders like Pearl-2 and Pearl Mini can both stream and record video at the same time.\n\nRotating display (flip screen)\n\nYou want to be able to see what you look like on camera. Cameras with a screen that rotates to face you and flips the image are designed for this. This handy feature saves the extra effort it takes to set up an external confidence monitor.\n\nGoing mobile\n\nIf you are planning to use your camera for a mobile live stream, be sure to review the camera’s battery life (and get a few additional battery grips). Also consider the weight, size, and shape of the camera. For example, the design of many DSLR cameras makes it challenging to hold them steady without a tripod for extended periods of time. Camcorders, meanwhile, were designed for handheld shooting.\n\nOther important gear (lights, tripods, etc.)\n\nAs amazing as camera technology is today, respecting the basic principles of filmmaking is still crucial. It’s important to pay just as much attention to lighting and composition as to your choice of camera. Even the world’s best camera won’t be able to save a poorly lit shot. Similarly, a sturdy tripod can do more for image stabilization than the best image stabilization software.

First off, more often than not the HDMI port on your computer is an OUT port, not an IN port. Secondly, the small USB port on your camera was designed for slow data transfer and not for the continuous, rapid, high-resolution image transfer required for streaming. In most cases, video capture for live streaming is possible only through HDMI. Lastly, HDMI video capture requires special drivers computers lack.\n\nTo capture HDMI video from a camcorder, DSLR, mirrorless, or any other non-USB camera, you will need a USB capture card.\n\nOptimal settings for a live streaming camera\n\nTo get the best possible video quality, be sure to check the following settings before going live. Some of these settings will be easily adjustable using dials on the camera body, while others may be hidden deep within the system menu.\n\nCoordinate exposure and fps\n\nSet the exposure time fraction to be a multiple of the chosen frame rate. For example, if you are streaming at 30 frames per second (fps), set your camera’s exposure to be 1/30; at 60 fps make it 1/60; etc.\n\nFully open aperture\n\nThe more light the camera receives, the better the image quality, as more light is able to hit the sensor.\n\nProgressive, not interlaced\n\nVideo sources that are listed with the letter “p” are called progressive scan signals (e.g., 720p, 1080p), while those listed with “i” are interlaced (480i, 1080i). Progressive signals look better because they display both even and odd scan lines simultaneously. Interlaced signals alternate between even and odd scan lines, making the video look stripey. Always go for “p” for streaming, not “i”."
