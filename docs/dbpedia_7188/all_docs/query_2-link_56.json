        "text": "As more and more streaming services opt to put their movies directly online instead of, say, in the movie theaters, the choices for home viewers are becoming very hard. With hundreds of titles across every streaming service, it’s no wonder cable was such a hit all those years ago! They just decided what movie you were going to watch at any given time, and now we have choices. With the power of choice, comes the power of trying to sort through what’s actually worth watching.\n\nWhen it comes to Disney+, you’ve got a lot of options. There are various original films, animated features, stop-motion animations, Star Wars content, computer animations, selections from Pixar selections, Disney’s animated classics, works from National Geographic, and, of course, the extensive catalog from Marvel Cinematic Universe. But only some of these movies are the best of the best. If you’re looking to settle in with a worthwhile flick, here are the 25 best movies on Disney Plus as of this very moment.\n\nLast updated on June 24, 2024.\n\n1. Avatar\n\nYear: 2009\n\nStarring: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure, Sci-Fi\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 162 minutes\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nYou probably saw Avatar in theaters in 2009, because everybody did. But if you didn’t (or just want to dive back into the ever-evolving blue world) it’s definitely worth watching, even if it’s just to keep up with the many conversations surrounding the blockbuster series. The movie brings you to the lush world of Pandora, where everyone is big and blue, and the government wants to ruin it all. It’s the first chapter in the movie series that seemingly will never end, as long as James Cameron has his way, especially after the box office hit that was Avatar: The Way Of Water.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n2. The Incredibles\n\nYear: 2004\n\nStarring: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nGenre: Family, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 116 minutes\n\nDirector: Brad Bird\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nIt’s hard to go wrong with any early-ish entry in the Pixar lexicon, though The Incredibles is still a top-tier film. If you’re tired of all of that Marvel bloat that’s been going around, The Incredibles is a perfect solution for anyone who wants to watch some lowkey-superhero fun. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter voice Mr. and Mrs. Incredible, a couple of supers who used to dabble in some crime fighting. Now, they are just regular old parents juggling three kids… who also have powers. In order to stop a new threat, they must band together as superheroes AND as a family to protect the city. It probably makes your family get-together look pretty tame.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n3. Avengers: Endgame\n\nYear: 2019\n\nStarring: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Tom Holland\n\nGenre: Superhero, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 185 minutes\n\nDirector: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nEvery time The Avengers meet with the most powerful beings in the galaxy, they end up beating them and going out for dinner after because they are just that good. But Endgame proved that sometimes, superheroes don’t survive, and things can get dark before they get better again. After Thanos snaps half of the world from existence, The Avengers have to scramble to try to get the universe back into its place, but not before facing deadly consequences.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n4. The Lion King (1994)\n\nYear: 1994\n\nStarring: Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones\n\nGenre: Family, Musical, Animated\n\nRating: G (but it should be PG-13, honestly)\n\nRuntime: 93 minutes\n\nDirector: Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nTo address the elephant and lion in the room, yes, there is a 2019 live-action rendition of The Lion king and yes, Beyonce is in it. It is also on Disney+ so you are welcome to watch that one, but if you are looking for something with a little more dancing and a little less like a nature documentary, the original is the way to go!\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n5. Up\n\nYear: 2009\n\nStarring: Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer\n\nGenre: Family, Drama, Animated\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 96 minutes\n\nDirector: Pete Docter\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nUp is a Pixar staple because it checks off all of the boxes that make a hit children’s movie: a cute little kid, a lovable animal sidekick, and a dead adult. The opening sequence is not for the faint of heart (or for anyone who has elderly people in their life) but the heartwarming tale of a young boy and his grumpy neighbor really does tug at those emotions. Plus, it has one of the best Pixar soundtracks, so even if you don’t enjoy the movie, you’ll get some great music out of it.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n6. Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back\n\nYear: 1980\n\nStarring: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nGenre: Science Fiction, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 128 minutes\n\nDirector: Irvin Kershner\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nYou could go with any Star Wars title here, but we all know that this is the one you want to watch, right? The third film in the iconic series, Star Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back follows the aftermath of the destruction of the Death Star, as the Imperial forces hunt the Rebel Alliance, which includes Princess Leia, Han Solo, and the cuddliest guy in the galaxy, Chewbacca. How will they make it out of this one?\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n7. Black Panther\n\nYear: 2018\n\nStarring: Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o\n\nGenre: Superhero, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 138 minutes\n\nDirector: Ryan Coogler\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nIn the first installment in the series, Chadwick Boseman plays the honorable T’Challa, a young king who is expected to rule the futuristic world of Wakanda after the death of his father. But when looming threats put their civilization in jeopardy, he has to rise to the occasion and protect his family as Black Panther. Boseman’s portrayal of the superhero is one that should not be missed, and the movie is even credited as a major turning point for Marvel.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n8. Avatar: The Way Of Water\n\nYear: 2022\n\nStarring: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Kate Winslet, Sigourney Weaver\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure, Sci-Fi\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 192 minutes\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis sequel literally took decades to come together, but the end result was worth it, even if no reports surfaced of James Cameron’s prediction that he’d make people “sh*t themselves with their mouths wide open.” You gotta admire Cameron’s commitment to taking us back into the lush realm of Pandora, and Kate Winslet joined the returning cast to set a record that must drive Tom Cruise nuts. Cameron has promised a few more sequels, so we’ll see if Cruise can break Winslet’s record, and she can one-up him by doing it again.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n9. Toy Story\n\nYear: 1995\n\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen\n\nGenre: Family, Comedy, Animated\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 84 minutes\n\nDirector: John Lasseter\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nAt one point or another, everyone thought that their toys came to life whenever they left the room, right? Though you probably never expected that they would have the familiar voice of Tom Hanks. Toy Story is the first movie in one of Disney’s most beloved franchises, and it’s always a good watch, whether it’s your first or fortieth view. Andy’s favorite toy, Woody, feels threatened when a shiny new toy joins the gang, and the duo set out on their own adventure after accidentally being given away. It’s also one of those rare Walt Disney stories that get even better with its sequels.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n10. Deadpool 2\n\nYear: 2018\n\nStarring: Ryan Reynolds, Josh Brolin, Zazie Beetz\n\nGenre: Superhero, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 121 minutes\n\nDirector: Devid Leitch\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThis may or may not be the movie that required Disney+ to establish their parental controls, but we’ll never really know. What we do know is that Ryan Reynolds fought pretty hard to get his raunchy superhero movie on the streamer, and it worked! In this second installment, Wade Wilson joins forces with another familiar team of supers, though not too familiar, because they don’t have all of those rights. Isn’t Hollywood amazing?\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n11. Pirates Of The Caribbean\n\nYear: 2003\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 142 minutes\n\nDirector: Gore Verbinksi\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nWhile the Pirates movies have a long, complex history, there is one positive thing that came from the franchise, which is that it brought the word “swashbuckling” back into the cultural consciousness. The movie that started it all, based on the iconic Disney ride of the same name, follows the eccentric pirate Jack Sparrow as he sets out to steal his ship back from a gaggle of ghost pirates who took it. Yo-ho! It’s a pirate’s life, after all.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n12. Captain Marvel\n\nYear: 2019\n\nStarring: Brie Larson, Samuel, L. Jackson\n\nGenre: Superhero, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 127 minutes\n\nDirector: Anna Boden, Ryan Fleck\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nNot every superhero movie can work in a fighting montage set to No Doubt’s “Just A Girl,” but this one sure did. And it worked! After years of minimal female-led Marvel movies, Captain Marvel is a good reminder that superhero movies can be fun and silly, especially if they take place in the ’90s. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers as she is recruited by the Avengers to help save the planet… and all of that fun stuff.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n13. Hamilton\n\nYear: 2020\n\nStarring: Daveed Diggs, Jonathan Groff, Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nGenre: Superhero, Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 160 minutes\n\nDirector: Thomas Kail\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nIt’s been hard to escape the Hamilton frenzy over the last few years, and now that the iconic musical is on Disney+, it is much more accessible for everyone to watch. Plus you can have your own intermissions, which is great because it is nearly three hours long. Filmed in 2016, the smash hit tells the tale of Alexander Hamilton through a more modern lens, complete with great period-specific costumes and, of course, Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n14. Raiders Of The Lost Ark\n\nYear: 1981\n\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime:109 minutes\n\nDirector:Steven Spielberg\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nReal-life Disney Prince Indiana Jones finally gets his place on Disney+ now that the Indiana Jones collection is available on the streamer. It’s always best to start at the beginning, which began with Raiders of the Lost Arkin 1981. Harrison Ford stars as the titular archeologist/adventure aficionado who races against the Nazis in order to track down a very coveted artifact. Nothing can stop him… except snakes.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n15. Return Of The Jedi\n\nYear: 1983\n\nStarring: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure, Sci-Fi\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 136 minutes\n\nDirector: Richard Marquand\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nEvery Star Wars movie is culturally significant in one way or another, and Return Of The Jedi is known for a few things, like being the last movie in the original saga, and tying up some of those loose ends regarding who is related to who. But the best part about episode six isn’t the monumental action scenes or the climactic conclusion — it’s the movie that brought Ewoks into the world. And that, alone, makes it work watching, in addition to all that galactic war.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n16. Spider-Man: Homecoming\n\nYear: 2017\n\nStarring: Tom Holland, Zendaya, Robert Downey Jr.\n\nGenre: Superhero, Action\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 133 minutes\n\nDirector: Jon Watts\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nIf Tobey Maguire isn’t your preferred spidey (no shame!), you might as well give Tom Holland a shot. Spider-Man: Homecomingis the third spidey reboot, though this time his story nicely ties in with those other Marvel guys for some cross-movie storytelling. Iron Man shows up to help Parker learn the ropes, but, as always, there’s a new bad guy in town looking to stir up some drama. And his name is Michael Keaton!\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n17. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\n\nYear: 1988\n\nStarring: Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd\n\nGenre: Comedy, Fantasy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 104 minutes\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nBefore Space Jambecame the leading name in hybrid animation films, Roger Rabbit was it. Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is an innovative comedy from 1988 that combined the two most popular themes of the time: mysteries and annoyingly loud children’s cartoons. The movie follows a private investigator as he tries to figure out who frames Roger Rabbit, a three-foot-tall rabbit with red suspenders who is looking to clear his name after a gruesome murder.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n18. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n\nYear: 2023\n\nStarring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure, Sci-Fi\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 150 minutes\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nYour favorite group of ragtag space thieves is back for their final (?!) ride, though things are a bit different here. Star-lord is still reeling after the death of Gamora, but as with most Marvel movies, things are not always what they seem, and an alternate version of Gamora eventually teams up with the group in order to save Rocket. Just don’t question it too much and you’ll have fun!\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n19. Black Is King\n\nYear: 2020\n\nStarring: Beyoncé Knowles-Carter\n\nGenre: Music, Dance\n\nRating: TV-14\n\nRuntime: 85 minutes\n\nDirector: Beyoncé Knowles-Carter\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nBlack Is King is a mesmerizing visual and musical reimagining of The Lion King that centers on Black families and self-identity by using the themes and lessons from the classic 1994 Disney-animated film (and the 2019 remake, for that matter). Beyoncé uses stunning visuals and extravagant sets along with some special guests in order to create a powerful piece of art focused on family and community.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n20. Monsters Inc\n\nYear: 2001\n\nStarring: John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi\n\nGenre: Comedy, Animated, Family\n\nRating: G\n\nRuntime: 92 minutes\n\nDirector: Pete Docter\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMike and Sully are just a couple of well-meaning monsters who are trying to make an honest living by scaring children by jumping out from the inside of their closets. Who can’t relate? But after one of the kids gets lost in the monster world, the duo has to find a way to get her back safely before the other monsters want to use her for her screams. It might seem evil, but it’s very eco-friendly to use vocals to power a city!\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n21. Logan\n\nYear: 2017\n\nStarring: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart\n\nGenre: Drama, Superhero\n\nRating: R\n\nRuntime: 139 minutes\n\nDirector: James Marigold\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThere was a time not too long ago when we all thought that 2017’s Logan would be the last time we would see Hugh Jackman don those piercing claws and grow out his unruly sideburns, though that’s not the case anymore. Still, the final chapter in Wolverine/Logan’s life is an unexpectedly dark drama that acts less like a superhero movie and more like a heartbreaking character study of an ailing man with a conflicting past.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n22. Thor: Love And Thunder\n\nYear: 2022\n\nStarring: Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tessa Thompson\n\nGenre: Action/Superhero\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 118 minutes\n\nDirector: Taika Waititi\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMighty Thor made her entrance here with the return of Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster. She’s somehow weilding Mjolnir despite its formerly shattered state and Thor’s own lack of worthiness to pick up his most famous magical weapon. Taika Waititi is having a ball here again, although this outing is quite as rollicking as Thor: Ragnarok, which partially landed the way it did through the element of surprise. In other words, a Hulk Butt goes a long way, but this followup remains a worthy one.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n23. Soul\n\nYear: 2020\n\nStarring: Jamie Foxx\n\nGenre: Animation/Adventure\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 100 minutes\n\nDirector: Pete Docter, Kemp Powers\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nAlthough Pixar’s status as an always-home-run-producing powerhouse has waned, this remains one of their better recent outings. The cast includes Jamie Foxx as Joe, a piano teacher and jazz devotee who goes for his big break and almost gets there, but then he nearly dies and finds himself to be a disembodied soul who must fight his way back to his own ailing body. As usual, this film tackles the larger life questions that Pixar knows how to do with flair, so while emotions do run high at times, the journey ultimately a life-affirming one.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n24. The Little Mermaid\n\nYear: 1989\n\nStarring: Jodi Benson, Christopher Daniel Barnes\n\nGenre: Family, Animated, Musical\n\nRating: G\n\nRuntime: 87 minutes\n\nDirector: John Muscker, Ron Clements\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nMermaid Ariel dreams of a life above the sea, but that’s hard when you don’t have human legs and instead are half-fish. But it’s not impossible! The Little Mermaid is the classic cautionary tale of what can happen if you trade a part of yourself in order to date the handsome sailor with the cute dog. But, as it is a Disney movie, of course, it all works out in the end for Ariel and her various sea pals. The upcoming live-action remake will hit theaters next year.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n25. Avengers: Infinity War\n\nYear: 2023\n\nStarring: Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans\n\nGenre: Action-Adventure, Superhero\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 149 minutes\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nThe most expensive movie ever made! Join all your favorite superheroes for one last fun little adventure in which the powerful Thanos is trying to eliminate half of the population. Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, and the rest of the super gang team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to battle to death over the universe. Again.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n26. Spider-Man 2\n\nYear: 2004\n\nStarring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco\n\nGenre: Action, Superhero\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 127 minutes\n\nDirector: Sam Raimi\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nBefore there was an Andrew Garfield spidey or a Tom Holland spidey, there was a Tobey Maguire spidey and his tentacled friend Doc Oc. Spider-Man 2 is a fun ride no matter which iteration of Peter Parker you prefer, all because of Alfred Molina’s take on Dr. Octavius. Plus, you get to see a young James Franco try to avenge his father (Willem Dafoe from the first installment).\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n27. Flamin’ Hot\n\nYear: 2023\n\nStarring: Jesse Garcia, Annie Gonzalez, Dennis Haysbert, Emilio Rivera, Tony Shalhoub\n\nGenre: Drama, Biographical\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 98 minutes\n\nDirector: Eva Longoria\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nEva Longoria presents her directorial debut, which follows the “true” story of Richard Montañez (Jesse Garcia), a Frito Lay janitor who rose up through his Mexican-American heritage to transform Flamin’ Hot Cheetos in the eye of the American snack-craving public. Actually, this was no mere snack but a full-on sensation. After this film quickly became Searchlight Pictures’ most streamed movie ever, Longoria is apparently buried under a deluge of additional scripts from which to pick her next project.\n\nWatch it on Disney+\n\n28. Cruella\n\nYear: 2021\n\nStarring: Emma Stone\n\nGenre: Adventure/Comedy/Crime Drama\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRuntime: 134 minutes\n\nDirector: Craig Gillespie\n\nTrailer: Watch here\n\nCruella de Vil received an origin story that no one knew that she ever needed. Emma Stone relishes this role with wild cackling, and you will fear those moments whenever puppies come into view, but nonetheless, this movie gives us a telling glimpse into the rebellious early days of this classic Disney villainess. I Tonya director Craig Gillespie is just the helmer for this gig, which dives into the fashion world as set against the punk-rock revolution of 1970s London. Estella gets down to grifting, and then it is on when she crosses paths with Emma Thompson’s Baroness von Hellman.\n\nWatch it on Disney+"
