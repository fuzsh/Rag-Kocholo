        "text": "DRAG ME TO THE MOVIES is an interactive movie-going experience featuring drag artists, movie bingo and prizes. It is hosted by Weird Alice.\n\nT HERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FREE CABLE. Learn the hard way with Weird Alice and special guest ENSH as they revisit the 90s cult classic THE CABLE GUY. Directed by Ben Stiller and starring Jim Carrey, this comedy thriller is worth the price of installation!\n\nWhen recently single Steven moves into his new apartment, cable guy Chip comes to hook him up—and doesn’t let go. Initially, Chip is just overzealous in his desire to be Steven’s pal, but when Steven tries to end the ‘friendship’, Chip shows his dark side. He begins stalking Steven, who’s left to fend for himself because no one else can believe Chip’s capable of such behaviour.\n\nFriday February 10th, 7:00 PM/6:30 PM Doors"
