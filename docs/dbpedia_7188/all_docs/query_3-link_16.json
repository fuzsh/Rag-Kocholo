        "text": "While January is often a slower month in movie theaters, it’s usually when major Oscar contenders start hitting streaming platforms. That’s definitely the case this year as 2024 kicks off with the long-awaited arrival of Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” on Apple TV+. The $200 million Western crime failed to turn a profit in theaters ($156 million worldwide), but it’s a seven-time Golden Globe nominee and a 12-time Critic’s Choice Award nominee and will surely bring in a lot of eyeballs to Apple’s streaming platform this month. Anyone who stayed away from “Flower Moon” in theaters because of its hefty 206-minute runtime no longer has an excuse. Watch it from home and take all the bathroom breaks you need.\n\nA second major Oscar contender new to streaming is Alexander Payne’s “The Holdovers,” which technically debuted Dec. 29 on Peacock but is now getting its first full month of streaming availability. Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph are near locks to land nominations for best actor and best supporting actress, respectively, and their chances of winning are surging for many Oscar pundits. Netflix also has the international contender “Society of the Snow” launching this month, while Hulu is debuting the riveting documentary contender “Beyond Utopia.”\n\nOutside of the Oscar players, streaming highlights for January 2024 include “Schitt’s Creek” creator Daniel Levy making his film directorial debut with Netflix’s “Good Grief” and Saoirse Ronan teaming up with Paul Mescal for Prime Video’s sci-fi mystery “Foe.” Check out more buzzy new films to streaming this month below."
