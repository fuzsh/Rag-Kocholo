        "text": "Although Amazon Prime Video doesn’t do a very good job of promoting its comedy specials on the Prime Video home page, it does offer stand-up fans another outlet to see some of the best comedians in the business. There just aren’t as many comedy specials throughout the year as you may find on Netflix.\n\nRegardless, Prime Video has delivered new comedy specials for 2024 featuring Sam Morril, Marlon Wayans, and Subhah Agarwal, each of whom bring their own style of humor. Although some of the humor is darker than you may be comfortable with, especially in Wayans’ Good Grief. But if you’re looking for some laughs, you’ll find them here among the best stand-up comedy on Amazon Prime Video right now.\n\nLooking for even more laughs? Check out our other streaming guides, including the best stand-up comedy on Netflix, as well as the best comedies on Amazon Prime and the best comedies on Hulu.\n\nSam Morril: You've Changed (2024)\n\n7.2/10\n\n50m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nSam Morril\n\nDirected by\n\nJames Webb\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe name of Sam Morril’s latest comedy special, You’ve Changed, does get explained in the course of the hour, as one of his critics reemerges from the past… in shall we say a very different way. Morril’s argument is if they can change that much, then so can he. Morril also shares a string of texts from his ex that might be considered Baby Reindeer-adjacent, although it never quite goes as far as Netflix’s show.\n\nMorril isn’t breaking new comedy ground by making jokes about his sex life, bad dating partners, or getting older. But he knows how to tell a story and how to take back command of the room whenever any hecklers try to get a word in edgewise.\n\nMarlon Wayans: Good Grief (2024)\n\n6.1/10\n\n68m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nMarlon Wayans\n\nDirected by\n\nTroy Miller\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nFor his latest comedy special, Good Grief, Marlon Wayans mines the deaths of his parents for some dark humor. But you may not be prepared for the level of detail that Wayans goes into about taking care of his mother late in her life. There’s some deeply unsettling things he describes about her that simply aren’t funny.\n\nThe things that are funny are about Wayans’ upbringing, and his theory about why his father was a Jehovah’s Witness. However, the most profound part of this special is the way Wayans uses his humor to deal with not only his grief for his parents but all of the other people in his life that he’s lost as well.\n\nSubhah Agarwal: Airport Pigeon (2024)\n\n61m\n\nGenre\n\nStand-up comedy\n\nStars\n\nSubhah Agarwal\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Volk-Weiss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nSubhah Agarwal has a way of letting the audience laugh with her and at her while describing her ongoing struggles with her mental health in her comedy special, Airport Pigeons. It’s particularly funny when she recounts how she’s been bullied by children as an adult, but she explains how it happens. She also finds a way to bring up Stephen Hawking’s love life and uses his own documented affairs to bring the humor out of his situation as well.\n\nJoel McHale: Live from Pyongyang (2019)\n\n4.8/10\n\nr\n\n58m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJoel McHale\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Volk-Weiss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nYou may know him best from Community or as the host of The Soup, but actor-comedian Joel McHale is a stand-up comedian, too. And his this foray into stage material is titled Joel McHale: Live from Pyongyang. If you’re in the mood for a bit of (mostly) clean irreverence, this is the special to watch. Toss in a dash of self-deprecation, some fourth-wall breaking, and enough sarcasm to keep the boat afloat, and the final dish is a one-hour performance piece from a renowned and often-relatable talent.\n\nTrevor Wallace: Pterodactyl (2023)\n\n5.9/10\n\nr\n\n66m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nTrevor Wallace\n\nDirected by\n\nGeorge Nienhuis\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nTrevor Wallace’s cavalcade of internet characters have been eliciting laughs for several years now. Now, for the first time, we get to see this wild performer bring his ingenuity to a live audience. Watching Trevor Wallace: Pterodactyl, you would think the entertainer has been doing stand-up for years. His stage presence is energetic, but natural, and the jokes don’t stop landing. Covering a number of subjects, Wallace doesn’t hesitate to make things a tad uncomfortable, but he’s adept enough to rope the audience right back in.\n\nKevin James: Irregardless (2024)\n\n60m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nKevin James\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nWe’re betting that most of the media-consuming world knows Kevin James from a little show called The King of Queens. Another chunk of humanity may know him from films like Grown Ups with Adam Sandler (Hustle) and Paul Blart: Mall Cop co-starring a Segway. Whatever show or movie you know him from, we’d like to draw your attention to the goofball’s latest stand-up special: Irregardless. Mr. James isn’t here to push the envelope per se, and that’s OK in our book! If you’re in the mood for some family-friendly fun, or you’d like your kids to experience their first stand-up special, Irregardless is the perfect Kevin James tour de force to indulge in.\n\nHank Chen: I'm Not Supposed to Be Here (2023)\n\n60m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nHank Chen\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Volk-Weiss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nNot many stand-up comics can say they’ve taken the stage merely six hours after being in a car accident, but such is the case for Hank Chan. The performer’s debut special is called I’m Not Supposed to Be Here, and Chen proves to be a fireball of comedic genius . Everything from dictatorships to family life gets roasted in this blistering hour.\n\nRussell Peters: Deported (2020)\n\n4.5/10\n\n67m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nRussell Peters, Jason Collings, Vicky Kaushal\n\nDirected by\n\nDavid Higby\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nCanadian comic Russell Peters has been around for a minute, and his comedic talent and notoriety has skyrocketed. Peters’ new comedy special is called Deported, and it’s his first production for Amazon Prime Video (his last two specials are on Netflix). A bulk of the material focuses on immigration and ancestry, two subjects that Peters is well-versed in. Let’s just say this is an observational masterpiece you don’t want to miss.\n\nNate Bargatze: Hello World (2023)\n\n8.1/10\n\n60m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nNate Bargatze\n\nDirected by\n\nMike Lavin\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nNate Bargatze is one of the rare comics of today who manages to get everyone keeled over in laughter without dropping any f-bombs or racy material; a comedic skill he’s been honing for years. In his latest special Hello World, Bargatze covers everything from family conundrums to the many disadvantages of being a first-born child. Hello World is a major triumph for Bargatze, and it’s all clean (for the most part), it’s all succinct, and it’s ridiculous amounts of fun from start to finish.\n\nZarna Garg: One in a Billion (2023)\n\n6.0/10\n\n66m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nZarna Garg\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Volk-Weiss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nZarna Garg is the kind of comedic talent that isn’t afraid to get introspective, tapping into her personal life to deliver her iconic jokes and riffs. Such bravura is on full display in One in a Billion, a 2023 release that finds Garg tackling every facet of family drama, and all from the unique perspective of being an Indian-immigrant mother who isn’t afraid to push the envelope. With a runtime of an hour and five minutes, the “time flies when you’re having fun” adage couldn’t be more true here, as One in a Billion feels like it’s over in a flash.\n\nKellen Erskine: Zoomed Out (2022)\n\n7.6/10\n\n43m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nKellen Erskine\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Volk-Weiss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nWhen we walk around the world, there’s stuff that inevitably strikes us all as bizarre. Why rush out for bread and milk before a huge storm? Do we really need a blessing whenever we sneeze? Call it tradition or just idiosyncratic, but if you want to watch a stand-up comic call out these eccentricities in a bold and unforgiving fashion, you need to watch Kellen Erskine’s Zoomed Out. Throwing a spotlight on the absurdities of everyday life is what Erskine does best, and we guarantee you’ll be in stitches when you watch the man do his work.\n\nSebastian Live (2009)\n\n63m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nSebastian Maniscalco\n\nDirected by\n\nManny Rodriguez\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nSebastian Maniscalco is the kind of comedic talent who isn’t afraid to shine a light on the many idiosyncrasies of humanity, and if his stand-up special Sebastian LIVE is to be believed, our species has plenty of quirks to poke fun at.\n\nthe special was filmed at the prestigious Paramount Theatre in St. Louis, and if you’re in the mood for the kind of observational humor that will have you rolling around on the floor in laughter, look no further than Mr. Maniscalco.\n\nJim Gaffigan: Noble Ape (2018)\n\n67m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJim Gaffigan\n\nDirected by\n\nJeannie Gaffigan\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nYou don’t get into our comedy roundup twice unless you’re really funny, but it should come as no surprise that Jim Gaffigan gets a second shout-out. In his 2018 special Jim Gaffigan: Noble Ape, the renowned talent (he starred in the wonderful Linoleum earlier this year) gets a bit more personal, incorporating his wife’s harrowing run-in with cancer into the show.\n\nIt’s a bold decision on Gaffigan’s behalf, but it’s a mature call that serves to remind us that life may throw a million wrenches our way, but sometimes all we can do is snicker as the projectiles fly toward us.\n\nJim Breuer: And Laughter for All (2013)\n\nr\n\n58m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJim Breuer\n\nDirected by\n\nJay Chapman\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nJim Breuer is an unchained force to be reckoned with in the outrageous 2013 stand-up special, Jim Breuer: And Laughter for All. Originally produced for Epix, Jim ditches the Goat Boy threads in favor of something a bit more rooted but equally off-the-charts.\n\nExploring topics of fatherhood, modern suburbia, and teen-year antics, Breuer’s approach may be unrelenting, but fans of his style know exactly what they’re signing up for.\n\nGeorge Carlin: Life Is Worth Losing (2005)\n\nr\n\n74m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, TV Movie\n\nStars\n\nGeorge Carlin\n\nDirected by\n\nRocco Urbisci\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nOne of the O.G. titans of stand-up, the late-great George Carlin left far more than your traditional mark on the entertainment world. A constantly called-upon influence for today’s leading comic legends, the man’s talents are on full-display in George Carlin: Life is Worth Losing. Jam-packed with Carlin’s rapid-fire and astute commentary on the continually-crumbling Planet Earth, this humorously bleak eulogizing remains as relevant today as the maestro’s words were nearly 20 years ago.\n\nIain Stirling Failing Upwards (2022)\n\n5.9/10\n\n67m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nIain Stirling\n\nDirected by\n\nChris Howe\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIain Stirling is best known as the narrator for the seminal hit Love Island, but Stirling also has a solid stand-up career. In Failing Upwards, the Scotsman talks about his life and how he compares to his more famous wife, which often pits him as the lesser half of the duo. Stirling also does an excellent job of taking what the audience gives him, from laughter to the occasional heckler. This is Stirling’s first stand-up special for Prime Video.\n\nCocoa Brown: Famous Enough (2022)\n\n53m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nCocoa Brown\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Volk-Weiss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nCocoa Brown may not be famous enough to have her own Wikipedia page (yet), but she is famous enough to have her own stand-up special on Amazon Prime Video. In her set, Brown speaks on dating and parenting during Covid, as well as double standards in the dating world and family drama. The special was filmed in New York City and marks Brown’s stand-up debut. Viewers may recognize Brown from Never Have I Ever and Tyler Perry’s Single Moms Club.\n\nEddie Izzard: Wunderbar (2021)\n\n6.5/10\n\n78m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nEddie Izzard\n\nDirected by\n\nSarah Townsend\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nWunderbar was filmed at the tail-end of a world tour that would soon be made near-impossible due to the pandemic. Eddie Izzard’s London show has the usual laughs but also serious musings about aging and the cosmic power of circles. Izzard has a number of stand-up specials on Amazon Prime, so feel free to check them out once you’ve run through Wunderbar.\n\nGeorge Carlin: You Are All Diseased (1999)\n\n8.5/10\n\n65m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Documentary, TV Movie\n\nStars\n\nGeorge Carlin\n\nDirected by\n\nRocco Urbisci\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nGeorge Carlin is a stand-up comedy legend. In You Are All Diseased, the late comic rants about airport security, germ phobias, businessmen, cigars, and angels. Some of the jokes don’t age well — particularly some of the thoughts on airport security, as this was filmed pre 9/11 — but Carlin’s act still shows why he was one of the best comedians to ever take a stage.\n\nJimmy O. Yang: Good Deal (2020)\n\n7.1/10\n\nr\n\n57m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJimmy O. Yang\n\nDirected by\n\nMarcus Raboy\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nJimmy O. Yang is most known for his roles in Silicon Valley and Space Force, but he’s also a veteran of the stand-up comedy circuit. In Yang’s stand-up debut, Good Deal, he introduces himself to audiences, discusses his background and upbringing, as well as the key differences between Chinese supermarkets and American supermarkets. The special tackles some familiar, stereotypical territory, but Yang’s delivery of the material is endearing and emblematic of his rise in the industry.\n\nBrad Williams: Daddy Issues (2016)\n\n7.6/10\n\n61m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nBrad Williams\n\nDirected by\n\nScott L. Montoya\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nBrad Williams has no issue addressing the elephant in the room. In Daddy Issues, the comedian born with a form of dwarfism makes jokes about the prejudice he faces on the daily due to his height. One particular story delves into the time he ran in the Special Olympics, and it’s a hilarious tale. While Williams’ jokes are funny, some of what he has to say is also biting, particularly in regards to the adversity that drives him, due in some part to his father. This is Williams’ second stand-up special, following Fun Size.\n\nRhys Darby: Mystic Time Bird (2021)\n\n6.7/10\n\n83m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nRhys Darby, Rachel House\n\nDirected by\n\nBarry Castagnola\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nRhys Darby has fans for life courtesy of anyone who ever watched Flight of the Conchords. The New Zealand comedian shows off some of that same charm in Mystic Time Bird, which debuted last year. The comic takes stock of physical comedy, making strange observations and even stranger sound effects while discussing mysticism and birds, as the title suggests. The fact that Darby can make so many bird noises and not turn off viewers during this special is a feat in itself.\n\nAndrew Santino: Home Field Advantage (2017)\n\n5.6/10\n\n71m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nAndrew Santino\n\nDirected by\n\nBrandon Dermer\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nYou’ve probably seen Andrew Santino before. He’s popped up as a producer of a fictional television show in This Is Us and currently stars as the manager in FX’s Dave. Santino is also a stand-up comedian, with his coup de grace Home Field Advantage released in 2017. The special, which debuted on Showtime, is very much a product of Santino’s love for Chicago, where the special was filmed, as he gets into all things Windy City. He also jokes about his signature red hair and expresses his problematic takes on gender, although he mostly avoids politics. His cynical character from I’m Dying Up Here shines through in his special.\n\nMaria Bamford: Weakness Is the Brand (2020)\n\n7.8/10\n\n75m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nMaria Bamford\n\nDirected by\n\nRobert Cohen\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nMaria Bamford’s comedy is genius, and there’s no better proof than her 2020 special Weakness is the Brand. One of her overpowering strengths as a comic is her ability to make the most brilliantly constructed jokes come off as neurotic improvisation, and that’s never more fully on display than it is here. From hearing about the bizarre role-playing she enjoys with her husband, to stories about negotiating with her alma mater, to her deceptively adorable reminder that while it is not okay to visit harm upon certain politicians it’s perfectly legal to lead them “into a bramble,” Weakness Is the Brand is a delightful and hilarious watch.\n\nMaria Bamford: Weakness Is The Brand (Official Trailer)\n\nJosh Blue: Broccoli (2020)\n\n7.1/10\n\n66m\n\nStars\n\nJosh Blue\n\nDirected by\n\nBrandon Naughton\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nCiting a ranting man in Reno who loudly accused the comic of having no hobbies, Josh Blue describes himself as a crazy person magnet in his 2020 special Broccoli. Wearing a black T-shirt bearing the title vegetable of the special and coming off like a time-lost hippy, Josh Blue revels in making his audience uncomfortable as much as he keeps them howling. From lamenting the choice to move downwind from a dog chow factory to the comic’s self-deprecating humor about his cerebral palsy, Blue will keep you laughing as well as wondering about the awkward benefits of using your lips to point rather than your fingers.\n\nJosh Blue: Broccoli (2020) | Official Trailer HD\n\nJayde Adams: Serious Black Jumper (2020)\n\n7.4/10\n\n62m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJayde Adams\n\nDirected by\n\nPeter Orton\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn her 2020 Amazon Original special, Serious Black Jumper, Jayde Adams wants to educate you. She gives you a crash course in the history of feminism, “yoof-‘splaining” for the over-50 crowd, and ably demonstrates how all you have to do to force the world to take you seriously is wear a black turtleneck. The sharply witty and brilliant British comic delivers a hilarious hour of social commentary mixed with good, plain fun.\n\nAmazon Prime Video presents Jayde Adams: Serious Black Jumper (Trailer)\n\nJim Gaffigan: Quality Time (2019)\n\n7.6/10\n\n75m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nJim Gaffigan\n\nDirected by\n\nJeannie Gaffigan\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn the opening moments of Jim Gaffigan’s 2019 Quality Time special, the comic pats his stomach and says “This is what I look like. It’s mostly my fault.” And that sets the tone for the comic’s charming and childlike self-deprecating humor. Still obsessed with food, Gaffigan kicks things up to a new level with Quality Time. He goes to the rarely explored areas of cannibal humor, as well as discussing what it’s like to try reindeer meat right after Christmas. As usual, we get not only Gaffigan’s stand-up but his hilarious whiny-voice internal critic responding to his jokes.\n\nJim Gaffigan: Quality Time - Official Trailer\n\nMovie images and data from:\n\nBlair Marnell has been an entertainment journalist for over 15 years.
