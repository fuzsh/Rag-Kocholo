Braceface is an animated Canadian show produced by Alicia Silverstone (who also voices the main character for the first two seasons). The show follow the exploits of Sharon Spitz, an average eighth grader who at the start of the series is forced to get braces for her teeth. Typical of teenage life, she worries about how this will affect her usual status amongst her peers as she goes through her daily life.

The show, when first advertised, put much emphasis on Sharon's braces, as they were affected during a lighting storm while being fitted onto her mouth. Every now and then they would occasionally affect the environment around her (lockers, water fountains, radios, etc). As the show went on, this focus was dropped for the usual slice of life and "teenage issues" stories (though it does occasionally pop up).

The series lasted from June, 2001 to August 2005. A total of 78 episodes in roughly three seasons. Only the first two aired in the States starting on ABC Family first then moved to Disney Channel before being dropped. The third season never made it for some odd reason--though the inclusion of a gay character (Dion) and some of the subject matter may have been a factor.

Now has a character sheet.
