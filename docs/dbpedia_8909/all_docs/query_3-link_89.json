        "text": "I am sure all of you braces fans out there know about braceface.com, a site about a orthodontist in Florida who went digital camera crazy it seems back in the late 90's (I think it went live late 97?), but after a while, they must have ran out of server space and a bunch of pics disappeared. I know how to get o them by using the parent directory, however, there are newer pics that look like they are from braceface.com I know this site has some scattered, but does anyone know a central location that has all pics from when that ortho stopped posting? Thanks!\n\nI have watched Braceface the show in the past, but haven't in a long time. It was ok, I liked the idea behind it, but I think a live-action show of the same kind would have been more intersting."
