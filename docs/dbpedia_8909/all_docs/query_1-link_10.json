The show features actress Alicia Silverstone from the movie Clueless (who also voiced the titular character for the first two seasons) serving as executive producer. The episodes focus on the misadventures of Sharon Spitz, a high school student who often struggles with an unusual ability occurring in her braces, which often creates mishaps in her daily life. Although considered to be a trademark feature in the series, later episodes began to drop this narrative in favor of tackling real-world issues\n\nSummary[]\n\nThe series, set in Elkford, British Columbia, recounts the travails of Sharon Spitz (a play on words, \"sharing spit\" being a euphemism for kissing), who is a junior high school student with braces that get in the way of leading a normal teenage life. Her braces are somehow electrically charged at all times, giving her strange abilities such as remotely operating machinery, tapping into wireless communication channels, and even discharging electricity directly into what's in front of her, though much of these abilities are often outside her control. In the first season, she is enrolled at Mary Pickford Junior High but later on, the show progresses her into attending Elkford High School The Show Will Premiere On Cbeebies In Janaury 2024"
