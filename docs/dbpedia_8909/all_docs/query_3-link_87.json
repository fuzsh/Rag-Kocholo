        "text": "If you follow me on Instagram and watched my Insta stories last week you might have noticed something different about meâ€¦\n\nI got braces! At 26 years old. For the first time.\n\nI have hated my teeth my whole life. Theyâ€™re crooked, my mouth is narrow, and I have an overbite. On top of the cosmetic problems the shape of my mouth also causes me to be a mouth breather and affects my sinuses. Iâ€™m on three allergy meds year round because of how my upper jaw impedes into my nasal area. Itâ€™s a party. ðŸ˜‰\n\nWhere other kids complained about having to get braces, I begged my dad for them. But he was a single parent and we didnâ€™t have the money, so they didnâ€™t happen. And as I got older, I became more and more self-conscious about my smile.\n\nI realize this is a total first world problem, but everyone my age has nice teeth. Getting braces as a kid is pretty standard these days, so to not have a nice smile is something that is very noticeable and sets you apartâ€¦ in a not good way.\n\nI went for a braces consultation in my early 20â€™s and was told that not only do I need braces, but because of my age and the fact my jaw is no longer malleable, I also need jaw surgery. (The procedure is called a Le Fort I and involves breaking your upper jaw into three pieces.) My parentâ€™s insurance wouldnâ€™t cover jaw surgery and it was not something I was able to afford on my own as a college student, so I filed the information away and went back to sucking up my insecurities about my teeth.\n\nEnter now. Josh and I have stable jobs, my insurance covers jaw surgery, and even offers a discount on orthodontia. So here I am at 26, with a metal mouth, looking at nine months of braces, followed by jaw surgery, followed by six more months of braces. And I could not be happier.\n\nItâ€™s going to be a journey, and one Iâ€™m excited to share with you. Five days into braces and I am currently on a soft food only diet and coating my mouth with dental wax every day. Everyoneâ€™s telling me it will get better, and slowly but surely it is.\n\nIt feels sort of weird to get braces in your 20â€™s, visiting a dental office clearly designed for kids, where the parents in the waiting room are closer to your age than the patients, but I know it will all be worth it in a few years. Braces will eventually be a distant memory and Iâ€™ll have the smile Iâ€™ve always dreamed about. At the end of the day, I decided 26 was way too young to stop pursuing my dreams."
