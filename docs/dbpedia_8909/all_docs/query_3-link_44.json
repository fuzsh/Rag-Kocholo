        "text": "Watch the videos, read the care kit cards and reference our social media pages for guidance on how to use the tools in the kit. Remember you can refer back to them whenever you need a refresher or ask your orthodontist regarding specific questions about your treatment. With our easy-to-follow instructions you will be using your tools like a pro in no time.\n\nAlways remember to clean your tools prior to use every time.\n\nIf your braces are causing you discomfort, contact your orthodontist for personalized help. If you can’t visit the office, our Brace Face kit has the tools to ease discomfort, replacing makeshift items like wires cutters and toenail clippers.\n\nIt is important to remember that some braces discomfort is normal.\n\nThe first step toward your perfect smile is scheduling a consultation with an orthodontist near you. In many cases, you don’t need a referral for this consultation. Look for an orthodontist who is board-certified and/or a member of the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO). These credentials ensure you’re receiving care from a qualified and dedicated professional who can guide you on your journey to a beautiful smile.\n\nThe cost of braces or orthodontic treatment can vary depending on factors such as complexity of your case, the type of braces chosen, and your location. It is best to schedule a free consultation with an orthodontist to discuss your specific needs and receive an accurate estimate of the cost.\n\nPhase I orthodontic treatment, typically for children aged 6-10, focuses on specific issues like creating space for adult teeth with methods such as headgear or limited brackets.\n\nPhase II treatment, usually ages 11-13, fine-tunes your bite and alignment once most permanent teeth have erupted. However, phase II treatment can be beneficial at any age for achieving a beautiful smile.\n\nIf you need some help with your Brace Face Kit, we’re here for you! First off, if you’re feeling any discomfort, give your orthodontist a call- they’re the pro’s! For all other questions, send us an email at info@bracefacekit.com or access our website and videos 24 hours a day."
