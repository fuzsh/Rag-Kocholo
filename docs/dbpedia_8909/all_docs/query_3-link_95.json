        "text": "This blog is still alive! Joy!\n\nAnother anniversary of a favorite cartoon falls on Throwback Thursday today! This time, it’s 15-year-old Braceface, my biggest Nelvana obsession since Wayside! Although I caught some interest in this show back in summer 2013, it wasn’t until February 2014 when I became a true fan, obsessively watching every episode on demand.\n\nFor those who forgot what Braceface was, it was a show set in Canada about a 13-14-year-old girl named Sharon Spitz who gets a pair of braces that make her budding adolescence even more frustrating than it already was. However, I must admit that, by the time the gang went up to high school, Sharon’s braces became less of a focal point in the stories.\n\nCall this show a mediocre waste of paper if you want, but I honestly find it to be one of the greatest and most underrated Canadian cartoons of all time. Alongside another Teletoon classic, What About Mimi?, it’s essentially the As Told by Ginger of Canada (albeit less ugly). In fact, I revealed on my “Ginger Snaps” blog a year ago that Braceface was the show that inspired me to give Ginger a try. And I ended up loving that show even more! At one point, I was so obsessed with Ginger that it felt like committing adultery if I looked at Braceface again. Silly me!\n\nHowever, I am jealous of Braceface retaining its spot on Amazon, while the ugly one got the boot.\n\nBut let me tell what Braceface did that not even As Told by Ginger dared to look into: one episode talked about the dangers of adult sites! Holy frig! Canada sure has some loose censorship, doesn’t it? Also, I was amazed that this kids’ cartoon was able to portray confirmed homosexuality in a respectable manner. I’m referring to the season three episode where Sharon tries to play matchmaker for her gay fashion designer friend Dion. I’m not kidding! That is awesome! And we’ve yet to see the day where Courtney Gripling comes out of the closet!\n\nOh, and another episode had Sharon become a victim of underaged intoxication! Holy crap!\n\nThen, there is an episode where Sharon’s grandfather comes over, and acts like a G-rated version of Hank’s dad from King of the Hill. In other words, he was acting like a racist! Don’t you just love when cartoons aimed at kids and young teens have more maturity when it comes to dealing with controversial topics than certain adult cartoons out there?!\n\nSo in conclusion, Braceface is a well-done slice-of-life cartoon for teenagers that rivals As Told by Ginger with its balls to push the boundaries of presenting relatable storylines in such a down-to-earth way. I’ve yet to write a full post on “Ginger Snaps” comparing these two great shows.\n\nI don’t care if she has braces on; Sharon is so beautiful… even if she can be an annoying, egotistical, rebellious, stubborn, mouthy, whiny brat a lot of times.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
