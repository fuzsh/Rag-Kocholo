The show features actress Alicia Silverstone from the movie Clueless (who also voiced the titular character for the first two seasons) serving as executive producer.[2] The episodes focus on the misadventures of Sharon Spitz, a high school student who often struggles with an unusual ability occurring in her braces, which often creates mishaps in her daily life. Although considered to be a trademark feature in the series, later episodes began to drop this narrative in favor of tackling real-world issues. Unlike most animated shows which take place in fictional cities or states, etc., this one takes place in the real-life town of Elkford, British Columbia.\n\nSummary\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series, set in Elkford, British Columbia, recounts the travails of Sharon Spitz (a play on words, \"sharing spit\" being a euphemism for kissing), who is a junior high school student with braces that get in the way of leading a normal teenage life.[3] Her braces are somehow electrically charged at all times, giving her strange abilities such as remotely operating machinery, tapping into wireless communication channels, and even discharging electricity directly into what's in front of her, though much of these abilities are often outside her control. In the first season, she is enrolled at Mary Pickford Junior High but later on, the show progresses her into attending Elkford High School.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nSharon Esther Spitz (voiced by Alicia Silverstone in Seasons 1-2 and Stacey DePass in Season 3) is the lead character of the show.\n\nAdam Francis Spitz (voiced by Dan Petronijevic) is Sharon and Josh's older brother.\n\nJosh Spitz (voiced by Michael Cera) is Sharon and Adam's younger brother.\n\nHelen Spitz (voiced by Tamara Bernier Evans) is Sharon, Josh and Adam's divorced mother.\n\nMaria Wong (voiced by Marnie McPhail) is Sharon's classmate and best friend, who is of mixed Chinese and Italian descent. She is also Brock Leighton's girlfriend.\n\nConnor MacKenzie (voiced by Peter Oldring) is another one of Sharon's classmates and best friends.\n\nAlden Jones (voiced by Vince Corazza) is Sharon's crush at school and boyfriend. They later break up. Sharon and Alden eventually get back together by the end of the series.\n\nNina Harper (voiced by Katie Griffin) is Sharon's nemesis at school and ex-best friend.\n\nBrock Leighton (voiced by Daniel DeSanto) is Alden's best friend and bandmate and Maria's boyfriend, who is African-American.\n\nAlyson Malitski (voiced by Emily Hampshire) is Nina's ex-best friend and later Sharon's new friend. She soon has a relationship with Connor.\n\nHannah Corbett (voiced by Elisa Moolecherry) is the Spitz's next door neighbor and Adam's girlfriend.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Braceface episodes\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series was produced by the Canadian animation studio Nelvana and Jade Animation (Shenzhen) in China, with the additional pre-production work done by Studio B Productions and Atomic Cartoons.[citation needed]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSarah Wenk from Common Sense Media rated the series three out of five stars, stating \"ultimately it's rather lightweight and, well, cartoony. There's nothing wrong with that, but it could use a bit more substance and less silliness.\"[4] Nancy Wellons from Orlando Sentinel stated \"What could be a wonderful premise about the struggle of adolescents to confirm and yet remain individuals instead turns into a half-hour full of inane jokes, cliched characters and bad dialogue.\"[5] Evan Levine from Newspaper Enterprise Assn. wrote, \"The brace subplot sometimes adds an uneasy note — is it fantasy? — and can be vaguely confusing. But the show holds the possibility of being a clever takeoff of the preteen years, whether you have braces or not.\"[6] Jeanne Spreier from Knight Ridder wrote, \"Braceface takes a refreshingly light look at junior high challenges — boys, braces, friends, popularity, parents, school — without giving in to nastiness, violence, ill-will or dejection.\"[7]\n\nIn 2004, the episode \"Ms. Spitz Goes To Warsch & Stone\" won an award at the Environmental Media Awards.[8][9]\n\nTelecast and home media\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States, the series originally aired on Fox Family Channel starting on June 2, 2001, with reruns on its successor ABC Family until May 26, 2003. Disney Channel later aired reruns and premiered new episodes from May 2, 2004 until September 1, 2005, but some episodes were edited for content and time. Four episodes (\"The Worst Date Ever. Period\", \"Miami Vices\", \"Whose Life Is It, Anyway?\" and \"Grey Matters\") were skipped from Disney Channel airings due to their content. Half of season 2 (episodes 16 through 26) and the entirety of season 3 never aired in the United States until years later when services stream. In Canada, it ran on Teletoon from June 30, 2001[10][11] to September 1, 2004.[1]\n\nInternationally, the series aired on Fox Kids[12] and Fox8 in Australia, and Channel 5 and Pop Girl in the UK. It also aired on Nickelodeon in Germany and South Africa. In India, the series aired on Star One.[13] It aired in Ireland on RTÉ Two from 3 September 2001 to 2005.[14] In Japan, Braceface was aired on STAR Plus Japan. In the Netherlands, the show aired on Fox Kids/Jetix. In Romania and Hungary, it aired on Minimax.\n\nIn Canada, DVD releases of the series were released by KaBOOM! Entertainment, and in the United States, DVDs were released by Funimation Entertainment.\n\nIn the UK, Maverick Entertainment released a DVD, titled \"Brace Yourself\" in 2006, which contains the first four episodes. Fremantle Home Entertainment later released two more DVDs.\n\nCurrently, the series is now streaming on both networks, FilmRise Kids and Tubi. The series is also available to stream on Prime Video, iTunes, Google Play and YouTube (thru Nelvana's Keep it Weird! Channel).[15] As of February 28, 2022, reruns can be seen on Nickelodeon Canada weeknights at 4:00 AM. YTV later started airing reruns of the show since January 2, 2024, airing on late night Tuesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
