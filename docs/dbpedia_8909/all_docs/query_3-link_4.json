As a result, they decide to disguise themselves as females so they can enter the contest as well--and win the expensive music equipment. So as the girls take a walk on the masculine side (I'm not sure that joining a rock group is necessarily a masculine thing to do), the guys dress like Britney Spears wannabes and call themselves the Mangled Petals.
