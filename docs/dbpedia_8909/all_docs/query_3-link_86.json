Meanwhile, when Sharon learns that her class will be dissecting frogs (and this project will make up the majority of her grade), she completely flips out. Tally approaches Sharon to reveal that she's equally disgusted by the science project. Among other projects, Sharon starts a \"\"cut it out\"\" campaign to abolish frog dissection and finds that Tally is her biggest supporter -- which really irks Maria and Conner.\n\nIt's Christmas in Elkford!

Sharon could not wait to get home and put the tofurkey in the oven,(Sharon is a vegan) decorate the tree, and sing carols. However, her plan backfires when Ellen has work, Josh celebrates Channukah, and Adam has to camp out in the freezing weather in the driveway with tthe family's pioneer-like uncle.

When her dad announces that he's moving in with his girlfriend Lauren, Sharon doesn't react as negatively as her brothers. In fact, Sharon is excited by the hip downtown loft and lifestyle. When she discovers that Lauren's fifteen-year-old son has been kicked out of boarding school and is moving in with her as well, Sharon thinks her days of boredom are over. Drawn to Griffin's edginess and the rebellion he represents, Sharon decides she wants to move in with her dad and Lauren as well. She soon discovers that the grass isn't always greener on the flip side of the divorce coin. Not only is Sharon uncomfortable with her new lifestyle, Griffin doesn't prove to be such a cool new friend either.\n\nAfter Sharon is mistaken for being \"\"13 and under\"\" once too often, she determines that it's because some other girls her age are better developed.

After an initial thrill at all the extra attention her new fuller figure is receiving, she discovers that her more mature look comes with its own unique set of problems.\n\nSharon is thrilled to land a job at the new medieval theme restaurant. But delight turns to dread when she learns her father works there too - as a wandering minstrel! This isn't exactly the cool, rock musician she's invited to her school's 'career day'. Sharon tries to avoid embarrassment by 'un-inviting' Richard to school but then Nina and her family show up at the restaurant for dinner and Sharon's plans start to unravel! She decides that unless she can get the Harpers out of the restaurant before Richard's act, she'll never live down the humiliation at school.\n\nNina's cousin, Petra, casually admits to the long ago 'crime' of ripping the heads off Nina's dolls. Nina had always accused Sharon of this, but now knowing the truth, Nina initiates a truce with Sharon. Sharon is reluctant, but she goes along; it could mean the end of Nina's abuse. But then Sharon learns the only thing worse than being Nina's enemy - is being her friend!\n\nWhen Sharon's expected prom date doesn't materialize, Lauren arranges another 'date'; Taylor Knight, a pop star who's passing through town on a promotional tour, will escort her to the formal as part of a TV3 publicity stunt. At first Sharon is ecstatic about this sudden turn of events. The singing idol is one of Sharon's faves!

So Sharon is extremely curious who this girl is - until she discovers it's Nina! Nina puts her best foot forward and really impresses Lauren and Richard.

Until she realizes Winnie may have a secret agendaâ€¦\n\nEach student in Sharon's social studies class is given a high-tech baby-doll as part of a project on â€˜parenting'. Sharon thinks that when she grows up she'll be a great mom who will also be able to do anything and everything she wants; in other words, she'll \"\"have it all\"\". For the first while, she does well. But things start to get a little strained as she tries to balance â€˜parenting' with her other responsibilitiesâ€”like looking after her pets, working at the vet's and trying to have a social life. When she becomes hyper-vigilant about the â€˜baby' Sharon doesn't notice a toddler feed Pigger chocolate in the park and soon she's at the vet'sâ€”on the â€˜other side of the counter' with a very sick pooch. As she stays up all night to watch her beloved pet, she realizes that looking after something you love is not a game and that you'd better be an adult before you have a child.\n\nBrock and Maria start to play pranks on each other. The practical jokes catch on and soon everyone joins in on the â€˜fun'. Feeling left out, Sharon becomes desperate to be part of the crowd. Then she has an idea to play a practical joke on Connor--using a secret he confided to her years ago--he's afraid of scary bugs! Sharon scares him with a rubber cockroach and it goes over big with everyone. That is, everyone except Alyson and Connor who is furious and feels betrayed. Sharon tries to â€˜jolly' him out of his mood--she was sure he'd gotten over it--but Connor doesn't forgive her. And later Sharon gets upset when she discovers that Connor has divulged one of Sharon's minor secrets to Alyson. Now both injured parties start to feel as if they've outgrown each other and decide their friendship is officially over. In the end they both realize that their relationship doesn't have to disappear--it just has to change.\n\nSharon, the only one in her crowd who's not half of a couple, overcompensates by raving about her romantic Italian boyfriend, Marcello. So when he announces he's coming to visit, she's over the moon. And when he arrives, everything is great! But not for long; his â€˜European-ness' doesn't translate well to North America. Instead of being romantic and poetic, he just seems dorky and cornball. In an effort to recapture what they had, Sharon tries to make Marcello over into a more North Americanized version. When that doesn't work, she tries to avoid being alone with him. But Marcello doesn't take the hint. Then she tries to turn him off by making herself unattractive. When her scheme fails, Sharon is forced to hire â€˜Dirty Work', a project that Adam and his pals started for their Economics Class. Their service is to do the deeds someone can't do on their own. But when the â€˜Dirty Work' messenger accidentally gives Connor the message, he thinks Alyson is trying to break up with him. Now Sharo\n\nWhen her English teacher compliments Sharon on her poetry, Sharon decides to perform at a local poetry slam. And she's a hit until Adam - at Sharon's urging - also performs. His natural talent gets even more attention, immediately eclipsing her moment in the sun. Not only that, Adam needs Sharon's help for inspiration, but eventually Sharon isn't so sure she wants to help if it's at her expense.\n\nSharon is feeling dull, ordinary and unadventurous. And worst of all, her friends see her that way, too. So when a quirky substitute-student teacher encourages Sharon to be more free-spirited, Sharon embraces a new spontaneity. But as she grows closer to the teacher she begins to alienate her friends. Soon she learns that it's a fine line between being free-spirited and eccentric.\n\nSharon is bummed! There just don't seem to be any appealing guys: they're all immature, dumb or gross. But then she meets Pablo, who seems the perfect guy - until Sharon learns he's only 12 years old! Now Sharon must reconcile her romantic feelings with the fact that Pablo's younger, while hiding his age from Alden and Brock - who could humiliate her for the rest of her life!\n\nSharon's Mother takes a vacation to Hawaii and brings along David. While Sharon, Adam and Josh are left alone with Mitzy... Well, until Mitzy leaves them Home Alone to go see a new born baby her relative had.
