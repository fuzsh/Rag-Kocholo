        "text": "Exactly a hundred years ago, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti urged the readers of the first Futurist Manifesto, “Turn aside the canals to flood the museums! …Oh, the joy of seeing the glorious old canvases bobbing adrift on those waters, discolored and shredded!” Then, the horrors of the First and Second World Wars ameliorated the pathos of destruction which the Futurists used as their weapon. If for no other reason then because there was no dearth of destruction in the aftermath. The new, post-war sentiments leaned towards the paradigm of preservation and assumed as a given the fragility of culture and historical heritage. Thus, the museum again took center stage. The museum in 2013 has become a part of an industry of entertainment on a very mass scale.\n\nPermm Museum of Contemporary Art in Russia staged an interesting exhibition in 2009 aimed not at showing the work of an artist but at addressing the audience that comes to see art in a museum. It addressed that fact that this audience is usualy bewildered when seeing Contemporary Art.\n\nMost often, the problems for this audience come from the unfamiliar “rules of the game,” i.e. stylistic and formal differences that set it apart from earlier epochs, its seeming indiscrimination in means of expression, and the conceptual basis of various artistic gestures and objects. This exhibition therefore aimed at showing how in different movements from Pop Art onwards Contemporary Artists often referred to past masters but they manipulated the material revived it and venerated it. “The Night at The Museum” show was aimed at showing art that was in dialogue with works of the past but at the same time drew the viewer in\n\nby showing him images he could read and understand – and then therefore, through them ,what Contemporary Art strove to do. The exhibition reversed the role of the museum as a place where artists are honored by having their work hung and shown into a place aimed at pleasing the public, honoring the public and acknowledging that art was difficult to understand – and the public should not be made to feel uncomfortable in not understanding Contemporary Art. The exhibition was curated by Marat Guelman, a curator who is one of the leaders in Russia in bringing Contemporary Art to a Russian Audience. It would have been good to have this show travel to the West."
