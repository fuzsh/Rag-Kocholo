The Openness of the Visual Art Curriculum towards a New Visual Art Language\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAprotosoaie-Iftimi Ana-Maria\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Visual art curriculum should allow a wide range of activities to develop children's imagination and creativity, to provide a balanced framework for the harmonious development of people who can cope with the massive ammount of images that invade our daily lives. Contemporary art develops a new language - a hybrid language - which for now remains unknown to the majority of the public and it is not integrated into the Arts curriculum. General frame analysis reveals that Fine Arts are studied only up to the 10th grade, except for the humanity profile and for the vocational arts profile. School curricula stipulate fine arts study up to mid twentieth century. Openness towards contemporary art and the language of art starting with the second half of the twentieth century is quite limited even if the curriculum allows a certain flexibility in the approach.\n\nUnderstanding Language: A Primer for the Language Arts Teacher.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMalmstrom, Jean\n\nThis volume aims to bridge the gap between language arts teaching and linguistic theory.

Integrating arts into an English as a Foreign Language (EFL curriculum could benefit students who experience foreign language anxiety, which hinders them from being socially and linguistically successful in the classroom according to multiple studies outlined in the literature section. The focus for students in this study was on listening skills because it is a major element in foreign language development that is explored to a lesser degree than reading, writing and speaking skills. The eight introductory-level classes were split between control and experimental classes. During the first part of the arts implementation, the experimental classes began with drama theatre for 30 minutes. This consisted of students taking a theme in English, such as home and directions, then creating a creative performance for their peers involving relevant vocabulary and phrases. The second part consisted of a 15 minute music cloze section, where students were filling in lyrics for a song that they were actively listening to. Two academic assessments were given as department-wide mid-term and final academic assessments, two subjective surveys and the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS were given at the beginning and end of the school semester. The FLCAS determined that studentsâ anxieties lowered on 15 questions and increased on 18 questions, so the arts integration has not notably altered foreign language anxiety. The arts-integrated classes received average scores of 80.5%, while the control classes received 74%. Students have performed higher academically with an arts integrated curriculum. It is therefore recommended that arts in the form of music cloze and drama theatre should be included in EFL curricula to increase academic achievement\n\nLanguage Arts Teachers' Resistance to Teaching LGBT Literature and Issues\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nThein, Amanda Haertling\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn recent years, scholars and other educators have encouraged language arts teachers to include LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) issues and texts in their classrooms. Despite these efforts, scholars have pointed out that LGBT perspectives are seldom included in language arts pedagogy. Studies of teacher attitudes toward addressing LGBTâ¦\n\nEducating the public, defending the art: language use and medical education in Hippocrates' The Art.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRademaker, Adriaan\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe Hippocratic treatise The Art is an epideictic speech in defence of medicine against certain unnamed detractors. The author of The Art is fully aware of the fact that for him, language (as opposed to, say, a live demonstration) is the medium of education. Accordingly, the author shows full command of the main issues of the late fifth century 'sophistic' debate on the nature and the correct and effective use of language. In his views on language, the author seems to adopt a quite positivistic stance. For him, words reflect our perception and interpretation of the visual appearances or eidea of the things that are, and these appearances prove the existence of things in nature. To this extent, language reflects reality, provided that we language users have the expertise to form correct interpretations of what we observe. At the same time, language remains a secondary phenomenon: it is not a 'growth' of nature, but a set of conventional signs that have a basis in reality only if they are applied correctly. There is always the possibility of incorrect interpretation of our perceptions, which will lead to an incorrect use of language that does not reflect real phenomena. Words remain conventional expressions, and not all words can be expected to reflect the truth. In fact, the unnamed detractors of the art are victim to many such incorrect interpretations. Consistent with his view of language as secondary to visual phenomena, the author claims in his peroration that as a medium for the defence of medicine, the spoken word is generally considered less effective than live demonstrations. This modesty, while undoubtedly effective as a means to catch the sympathy of his public, still seems slightly overstated. Our author is fully aware of the powers and limitations of his medium, and shows great sophistication in its use.\n\nNo Child Left Behind in Art Education Policy: A Review of Key Recommendations for Arts Language Revisions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrey, Anne C.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFrom bipartisan origins and a laudable intent, the No Child Left Behind (Act) of 2001 has profoundly altered the condition of art education.

Specifically, it looks at how language differences become instruments for the language play that characterizes the participatory arts programs, TimeSlips and the Alzheimer's Poetry Project. These are two approaches that are predominantly spoken-word driven. Although people living with dementia experience cognitive decline that affects language, they are linguistic agents capable of participating in ongoing negotiation processes of connection, belonging, and in- and exclusion through language use. The analysis of two ethnographic vignettes, based on extensive fieldwork in the closed wards of two Dutch nursing homes, illustrates how TimeSlips and the Alzheimer's Poetry Project support them in this agency. The theoretical framework of the analysis consists of literature on the linguistic agency of people living with dementia, the notions of the homo ludens (or man the player) and ludic language, as well as linguistic strategies of belonging in relation to place.\n\nSemiotics of Art: Language of Architecture as a Complex System of Signs\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLazutina, Tatyana V.; Pupysheva, Irina N.; Shcherbinin, Mikhail N.; Baksheev, Vladimir N.; Patrakova, Galina V.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article examines art in the semiotic aspect.

As detailed in our extended interview with Clare McAndrew, the art market has grown rapidly over the last twenty years, leading to systemic and structural changes in the art field. For some, this growth of the market and its significance for art is an institutional misfortune that, for all of its effects, is nonetheless inconsequential to the normative claim that art and money shouldnât mix. This commonplace premise looks to keep the sanctity or romance of art from the business machinations of market mechanisms, as eloquently summarised by Oscar Wildeâs definition of cynicism (âknowing the price of everything and the value of nothingâ. This issue repudiates that normative moral code, and precisely for the reasons just stated: by now, the interests of the art market permeate all the way through the art system. The interests of the art market shape what is exhibited and where; what kinds of discourse circulate around which art (or even as art and in what languages; and what, in general, is understood to count as art. In short, the art market â comprising mainly of collectors, galleries and auction houses â is now the primary driver in what is valuable in art.\n\nUnderstanding How College Students Describe Art: An Analysis on Art Education in China\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHong Wang\n\n2015-05-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aims to explore how Chinese college students appreciate art as reflected in their descriptions of an artwork. Studentsâ descriptions were defined by a content analysis with respect to opinions and facts, art elements and principles. A questionnaire was also used to investigate studentsâ attitudes toward art education. 85 students who were divided into four groups participated in the study. The results showed: (1 participants were more familiar with art appreciation than art elements and principles; (2 there was a slight but no significant difference between studentsâ describing facts and opinions; (3 participants had significantly higher scores on describing art elements than describing art principles; (4 among all participants with regard to all elements and principles, there was a significant difference of describing space between students of art education and students of music education, and also, there was a significant difference of describing value between Chinese language students and other students. The results suggested that participants, including those of art education, had poor knowledge and strategies of understanding art, implying art education in China may have ended up with failure.\n\nIntegrating Mathematics, Science, and Language Arts Instruction Using the World Wide Web.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClark, Kenneth; Hosticka, Alice; Kent, Judi; Browne, Ron\n\n1998-01-01\n\nAddresses issues of access to World Wide Web sites, mathematics and science content-resources available on the Web, and methods for integrating mathematics, science, and language arts instruction.

This discourse cuts across time and space, impacting all art historical specializations, from prehistoric to contemporary, and from Africa to the Americas. Yet, the mainstream theoretical discourse on global art or art history focuses almost explicitly on contemporary and, to a lesser extent, modern art, operating from the premise that only these arts were created in an age of globalization and, thus, emphasize hybridity. This essay seeks to expand the mainstream theoretical discourse regarding global art to pre-modern examples, given that artistic exchange and hybridity dates as early as the prehistoric era all over the world and is not dependent on newer technologies. Indeed, one might argue that the study of pre-modern examples of global art could provide a powerful historical lens through which to analyze contemporary global art.\n\nUsing Cooperative Learning To Improve Reading and Writing in Language Arts.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBromley, Karen; Modlo, Marcia\n\n1997-01-01\n\nDeals with S.

Does the grammatical gender of nouns in an artistâs native language indeed predict the gender of personifications in art? In this paper we analyzed works in the ARTstor database (a digital art library containing over a million images to measure this correspondence. This analysis provides a measure of artistsâ real-world behavior. Our results show a clear correspondence between grammatical gender in language and personified gender in art. Grammatical gender predicted personified gender in 78% of the cases, significantly more often than if the two factors were independent.

Many of the available tools still work best in such environments. These environments typically utilize special hardware such as LISP machines and relatively unfamiliar languages such as LISP or Prolog. Space Station applications will require deep integration of expert system technology with applications developed in conventional languages, specifically Ada. The ability to apply automation to Space Station functions could be greatly enhanced by widespread availability of state-of-the-art expert system tools based on Ada. Although there have been some efforts to examine the use of Ada for AI applications, there are few, if any, existing products which provide state-of-the-art AI capabilities in an Ada tool. The goal of the ART/Ada Design Project is to conduct research into the implementation in Ada of state-of-the-art hybrid expert systems building tools (ESBT's). This project takes the following approach: using the existing design of the ART-IM ESBT as a starting point, analyze the impact of the Ada language and Ada development methodologies on that design; redesign the system in Ada; and analyze its performance. The research project will attempt to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the potential for embedding expert systems in Ada systems for eventual application in future Space Station Freedom projects. During Phase 1 of the project, initial requirements analysis, design, and implementation of the kernel subset of ART-IM functionality was completed. During Phase 2, the effort has been focused on the implementation and performance analysis of several versions with increasing functionality. Since production quality ART/Ada tools will not be available for a considerable time, and additional subtask of this project will be the completion of an Ada version of the CLIPS expert system shell developed by NASA\n\nTwenty-One Ways to Use Music in Teaching the Language Arts.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCardarelli, Aldo F.\n\nTwenty-one activities that integrate music and the language arts in order to capitalize on children's interests are described in this paper.

When an artist creates his/her work of art, the process he/she realizes is supported by different engineering disciplines. Therefore, especially modern artists need to understand engineering science and this results in transforming artists into engineers. Opportunities provided by technology and science enable artists to expand his/her vision and to improve his/her works. Especially kinetic art has become an approach that combines art with engineering. Kinetic art, which is nourished with varied disciplines, is an excellent example to prove that art is interdisciplinary and to show the relationship between artist/art and engineering.\n\nLearning the âlanguage of connectionsâ.

Within the scope of this unique iconographic art a number of key issues are examined: the origin of ancient art, its attribuÂ­tes and functions, the relationship between art and science, the role of art as an important means of human cognition and communication. Thus, rock art is presented as subject of art history and aesthetics, manifestation of scientiÂ­fic knowledge of the past, and an oldest iconographic language with characÂ­teristic features of book culture. These general scientific aspects are elucidated alongside achievements of anÂ­ciÂ­ent Greek and medieval Armenian philosophy. As a result, it becomes obvious that different problems of art during millennia remained within the foÂ­cus of the Armenian aesthetic mind, testifying to the continuity and succeÂ­ssion of creative activitiy in Armenian culture.\n\nThe Critical Concepts.

Through these processes we see and understand that the world is vaster than it is said to be. Artistic processes are mediated experiences that open up the world. A successful work of art expresses a reality beyond actual reality: it suggests an unknown world using the means and the signs of the known world. Artistic practices incorporate the means of creation developed by science and technology and change forms as they change. Artists and the public follow different processes of abstraction at different levels, in the definition of the means of creation, of representation and of perception of a work of art. This paper examines how the processes of abstraction are used within the framework of the visual arts and abstract painting, which appeared during a period of growing importance for the processes of abstraction in science and technology, at the beginning of the twentieth century. The development of digital platforms and new man-machine interfaces allow multimedia creations. This is performed under the constraint of phases of multidisciplinary conceptualization using generic representation languages, which tend to abolish traditional frontiers between the arts: visual arts, drama, dance and music.\n\nIntegrating the English Language Arts Common Core State Standards into Physical Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJames, Alisa R.; Bullock, Kerri\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPhysical education teachers are expected to implement the English language arts (ELA) Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in their instruction.

It focuses mainly on the possibility to introduce art as a source of material for language teaching, providing a wide spectrum of possibilities to introduce different types of activities. The author understands art not only as a source for language teaching/learning but something more than that. For her, the art can be a source for presenting moral and aesthetic values and the material, which will develop learners as a complete personality. The art can bring ethics, culture, history to the language lesson and can help learners to understand the mentality and culture of the target language countr(ies more deeply. The paper is the case study done at the secondary school (1st graders, using some materials and preparing them for achieving the states aim, by the author.

Thinking with Te WhÄriki retains the potential to ignite thinking post-developmentally about art, pedagogy and practice in teacher education, and in the field. It offers examples of how creating spaces for engaging (with art as pedagogy acts as a catalyst for change, art offers a dynamic way of knowing, and being-with the different life-worlds we inhabit. While new paradigms for thinking and practicing art in education continue to push the boundaries of developmentally and individually responsive child-centred pedagogies, an emphasis on multiple literacies often gets in the way. This prohibits opportunities for engaging in other more complex approaches to pedagogy and art as subject-content knowledge, something essential for developing a rich curriculum framework. The article draws on research that emphasises the importance of teacher education in opening up spaces for thinking about (the history of art in/and of education as more than a communication/language tool. It considers an inclusive and broad knowledge-building-communities approach that values the contribution that art, artists, and others offer the 21st early learning environments we find ourselves in.\n\nIndividualized Language Arts--Diagnosis, Prescription, Evaluation.

W.; Rogerson, T. M.; Chambers, L. H.; Fischer, J. D.; Oots, P. C.; Lewis, P. M.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nScience can serve as an authentic motivational and instructional vehicle for instruction in language arts. Two NASA educational outreach programs provide ample opportunity for strengthening vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills, through the integration of authentic activities and scenarios in the context of a real-time NASA mission. The NASA CERES Studentsâ Cloud Observation On-Line (SâCOOL) project is a hands-on project that supports NASA research on the Earthâs climate. Students are engaged in identifying cloud-types and levels and sending that information to NASA. If the studentsâ observations are within +/-15 minutes of the CERES satellite-based instrument passing over their location, this is designated as a âmatchâ. The participating teacher is sent an e-mail asking the student-observers to consider the various aspects of the match, including the interpretation of a graphical aid, using the correct terminology to express level of agreement, and writing comments to describe their âmatchesâ, all of which contribute to strengthening skills in language arts. To further integrate the language arts, the SâCOOL website provides several teacher-authored on-line lessons that integrate reading skills, vocabulary, and composition. The Mentoring and inquiry using NASA Data on Atmospheric and earth science for Teachers and Amateurs (MY NASA DATA) project is a project to enable K-12 teaches and students, as well as citizen scientists, to explore the large volumes of data that NASA collects about the Earth from space.

Here, we investigate some of these properties in three categories of art that differ in artistic claim and prestige: (1) Traditional art of different cultural origin from established museums and art collections (oil paintings and graphic art of Western provenance, Islamic book illustration and Chinese paintings), (2) Bad Art from two museums that collect contemporary artworks of lesser importance (Â© Museum Of Bad Art [MOBA], Somerville, and Official Bad Art Museum of Art [OBAMA], Seattle), and (3) twentieth century abstract art of Western provenance from two prestigious museums (Tate Gallery and Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen). We measured the following four statistical image properties: the fractal dimension (a measure relating to subjective complexity); self-similarity (a measure of how much the sections of an image resemble the image as a whole), 1st-order entropy of edge orientations (a measure of how uniformly different orientations are represented in an image); and 2nd-order entropy of edge orientations (a measure of how independent edge orientations are across an image). As shown previously, traditional artworks of different styles share similar values for these measures. The values for Bad Art and twentieth century abstract art show a considerable overlap with those of traditional art, but we also identified numerous examples of Bad Art and abstract art that deviate from traditional art. By measuring statistical image properties, we quantify such differences in image composition for the first time.\n\nTeaching Literacy to English Language Learners in the Borderlands: A Case Study of A Sixth Grade Language Arts and Reading Teacher\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSmith, Ann Marie; Salgado, Yolanda\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this case study was to investigate how an English language arts teacher used young adult literature to help English language learners improve English and literacy comprehension.

Hippocratic authors tried to show that an art of medicine existed indeed. They contrasted the concept of art with that of chance, not experience that Plato and Aristotle distinguished from art. In fact there are similarities and discrepancies between Hippocratic epistemology and Platoic epistemology. Hippocratic authors maintained that the products of chance were not captured by art. They distinguished the domain of art charactered by explanatory knowledge and prediction from the domain of chance ruled by the unexplained and the unforeseeable. They minimized the role of luck and believed the role of art. Hippocratic authors thought that professional ability contained both knowledge and experience. In Hippocratic corpus, experience is a synonym of competence and usually has a positive meaning. But Plato gave empirical knowledge the disdainful sense and decided a ranking between two types of knowledge. Both Hippocratic authors and Plato held that a genuine art had connection with explanatory knowledge of the nature of its subject matter. A common theme that goes through arguments about art-chance and art-chance is the connection between art and nature. Hippocratic authors and Plato regarded art as a highly systematic process. Art provides us with general and explanatory knowledge of human nature. Art and nature is a mutual relationship. The systematic understanding of nature helps us gain the exactness of art and an exact art helps us understand nature well.\n\nPrinciples and Practices for Building Academic Self-Efficacy in Middle Grades Language Arts Classrooms\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcTigue, Erin; Liew, Jeffrey\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAcademic self-efficacy contributes to students' motivation and persistence for learning.

Jansen van Vuuren\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The arts as a pedagogic medium can be an important tool for language learning, and yet many teachers avoid it, often because of a lack of confidence. The main purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of generalist educators, as opposed to art specialists, using the arts successfully as a cross-curricular tool to accelerate English First Additional Language acquisition. Most South African learners speak African languages as a mother tongue, yet they are taught in English from Grade 4 onwards. With the use of an action research project, learnersâ English proficiency was assessed with a custom-designed tool and, thereafter, they participated in 10 weekly sessions of arts-integrated English activities before being re-assessed. Positive results confirmed that generalist educators are able to utilise arts, and it showed the urgency for more focused arts-integrated educational training in generalist educator courses at South African universities. Although the research was limited in scope, it raises the question of how teachers for the primary school are educated with regard to learning a language with the use of the arts.\n\nOld Friends, Bookends: Art Educators and Art Therapists\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAllison, Amanda\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThis viewpoint presents a reflection on a meaningful relationship that developed between a university art education department and a local art therapy studio.

How we react to a beautiful painting or symphony draws upon instincts laid down long before humans existed. Now, in this enhanced edition of the highly popular The Artful Universe , Barrow further explores the close ties between our aesthetic appreciation and the basic nature of the Universe. Barrow argues that the laws of the Universe have imprinted themselves upon our thoughts and actions in subtle and unexpected ways. Why do we like certain types of art or music? What games and puzzles do we find challenging? Why do so many myths and legends have common elements? In this eclectic and entertaining survey, Barrow answers these questions and more as he explains how the landscape of the Universe has influenced the development of philosophy and mythology, and how millions of years of evolutionary history have fashioned our attraction to certain patterns of sound and color. Barrow casts the story of human creativity and thought in a fascinating light, considering such diverse topics as our instinct for language, the origins and uses of color in nature, why we divide time into intervals as we do, the sources of our appreciation of landscape painting, and whether computer-generated fractal art is really art. Drawing on a wide variety of examples, from the theological questions raised by St. Augustine and C.S. Lewis to the relationship between the pure math of Pythagoras and the music of the Beatles, The Artful Universe Expanded covers new ground and enters a wide-ranging debate about the meaning and significance of the links between art and science.\n\nAn experience in Language Teaching Seminar of Primary Education Degree through the Seventh Art\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÃngela GARCÃA-MANSO\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This study describes the Seminar Â«Language Skills and Seventh ArtÂ» developed at the University of Extremadura in the course 2015-2016.

G.; Walker, C. C.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nChildren's literature has often featured an understanding of our world through imaginative means: Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland both display this quality. As Wonderland was a manifestation of Alice's own imagination, her journey to understand Wonderland was actually a quest to understand the phenomena that comprised her 'real' world. It was author Lewis Carroll's way of showing that human beings must use multiple intelligences to understand the complicated mystery that is the world and all things in it. The specific way in which we each interpret the facts presented determine if we become an 'artist' or 'scientist.' But does the label matter? Albert Einstein himself once said, 'Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.' Inherently, discovery---the finding of something new---demands that one must imagine something that is heretofore unknown. Researchers in both science and the arts use the same basic principles to examine different fields of study. These principles will be discussed via examples such as comparative analysis of scientific vs. historical research methods; how scientific language compares to arts language and why they often mean the same thing; and how study of a subject matter could often be improved through a mutual understanding of both science and art. Because of the apparent difference in subject matter, a schism between the two sides of human understanding has grown to the point where they are thought to be two different and unrelated schools of thought. Here we present several examples of the integration of science and art, and show how 'different' actually means the 'same,' in terms of scientific and artistic processes. We argue that 'science' and 'art' are not mutually exclusive; they are often the same practice and can be taught as such. Simple changes in language prove that methods of inquiry in science are the same as those in the arts. In order to support the mission of STEAM\n\nArt and brain: insights from neuropsychology, biology and evolution.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZaidel, Dahlia W\n\n2010-02-01\n\nArt is a uniquely human activity associated fundamentally with symbolic and abstract cognition. Its practice in human societies throughout the world, coupled with seeming non-functionality, has led to three major brain theories of art. (1) The localized brain regions and pathways theory links art to multiple neural regions. (2) The display of art and its aesthetics theory is tied to the biological motivation of courtship signals and mate selection strategies in animals. (3) The evolutionary theory links the symbolic nature of art to critical pivotal brain changes in Homo sapiens supporting increased development of language and hierarchical social grouping. Collectively, these theories point to art as a multi-process cognition dependent on diverse brain regions and on redundancy in art-related functional representation.\n\nArt across the Curriculum: Burchfield...

Within any discussion of art, critical analysis must maintain an objective openess, particularily when the discourse concerns new media. To apply technological invention to art, new media is often without precedent on which to base criticism and bias. For this reason, holography falls prey to comparative rhetoric and established evaluation of other forms of imaging,as photography emulated the compositional romanticism of painting initially. Isolated and often misunderstood within the context of history, new media vascillates between legitimacy and curiosity in an attempt to create specific parameters to identify perceptual transition.\n\nArts Impact: Lessons from ArtsBridge\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShimshon-Santo, Amy R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nArts Impact summarizes lessons learned at the ArtsBridge Program.

The article first highlights the importance of activities expressing artistic creativity within modern curriculums. Then, it presents an empirical study that examines the preschool teachersâ and assistant teachersâ opinions on the importance of the educational fields, art genres, and visual arts fields. In research hypotheses, we presumed that preschool teachers find individual educational fields, individual art genres, and individual visual arts activities to be of different importance; consequently, education in kindergarten does not achieve the requisite holism. The study is based on the descriptive and causal-non-experimental method. We have determined that the greatest importance is attributed to movement and language, followed by nature, society, art and mathematics. Within art genres, the greatest importance is attributed to visual arts and music and the least to audio-visual activities. Within visual arts, drawing and painting are considered to be the most important and sculpting the least. These findings can support future studies and deliberation on the possible effects on practice in terms of requisitely holistically planned preschool education.\n\nMotivating the Documentation of the Verbal Arts: Arguments from Theory and Practice\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFitzgerald, Colleen M.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFor language documentation to be sufficiently extensive to cover a given community's language practices (cf.

Therefore can be said that Grafitti is subjected to the informal laws of the city, on the other hand, is the city itself being transformed. There are different technics in the making of graffiti, but two streams are predominating: Graffiti rises on unused walls of constructions or demolitions. It avoids public patrimony and private spaces, uses paintings and strong colors and can take months to be finished. Writer (scribbler, tagger, trow-up is an intervention of illegible nicknames. The writers consider the risk to mark prohibited places such as high, invigilated, inaccessible public spaces, private walls, edifices, bridges, train stations and sculptures, but they affirm: âWhen we have some place in our mind there are no limits, no barriersâ (intervewee in Poato, 2006, p. 35â. Among these streams, lots of interventions are accomplished: stencils, writing painters (piece, stickers, etc. With some exceptions, all of them are prohibited. Two reasons why they are prohibited can be suggested: the first one is that it is not clear defined where vandalism finishes and art begins, the second can be recognized in the fact that âworkersâ arrogate themselves the right to interfere in public space, without asking for previous approval. In a generic sense the city is complex and mutable. In a subjective sense the city is everydayâs life experience. Both aspects are considerated by analysing the practice of graffiti. If we understand urban art as an aehstetic dimension of the city and the city not only as language, but also as a growing practice, graffiti increases the variety of aesthetic communication and works against an inactive and passive social behaviour. Do grafitti language and method only keep their original meaning and coherence if they are illegal? What is the right posture of public politics?

Neuroimaging studies of visual art have investigated artistic style and esthetic preference but not brain responses attributable specifically to the artistic status of images. Here we tested the hypothesis that the artistic status of images engages reward circuitry, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during viewing of art and non-art images matched for content. Subjects made animacy judgments in response to each image. Relative to non-art images, art images activated, on both subject- and item-wise analyses, reward-related regions: the ventral striatum, hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex. Neither response times nor ratings of familiarity or esthetic preference for art images correlated significantly with activity that was selective for art images, suggesting that these variables were not responsible for the art-selective activations. Investigation of effective connectivity, using time-varying, wavelet-based, correlation-purged Granger causality analyses, further showed that the ventral striatum was driven by visual cortical regions when viewing art images but not non-art images, and was not driven by regions that correlated with esthetic preference for either art or non-art images. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis, leading us to propose that the appeal of visual art involves activation of reward circuitry based on artistic status alone and independently of its hedonic value.
