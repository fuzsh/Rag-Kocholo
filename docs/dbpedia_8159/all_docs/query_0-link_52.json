        "text": "Åmells welcomes all fans of modern and even historical art in their halls. For the duration of this event, you´ll be drawn in by majestic art pieces of multiple talented individuals of Swedish nationality, specialising in the Swedish modernism.\n\nThe exhibition Modern Pioneers: GAN and the Halmstad Group, Åmells wants to give the public another example of the rich variety of Swedish modernism. At the same time, it highlights the importance of the friendships and reciprocal artistic exchanges that often occurred across national and generational boundaries in the European art metropolises of the interwar period. The exhibition is a follow-up to last spring’s highly acclaimed presentation of the artist duo Isaac Grünewald and Sigrid Hjertén, who were certainly also modernists, but who manifested their modern artistic vision by quite different artistic means.\n\nOpening: Saturday 4 February, 12-16\n\nPrivate viewing: if you are interested in a specific work, you can book a private viewing in our viewing room by contacting us at info@amells.com.\n\nAddress: Birger Jarlsgatan 14, Stockholm\n\nExhibition period: 4 – 25 February\n\nOpening hours during the exhibition: weekend Mon-Fri 10-18, Sat 12-16\n\nThis time it is GAN – Gösta Adrian-Nilsson – who represents the Swedish avant-garde of the early 20th century. GAN was one of the first in our country to try out the Cubists’ fragmentation of form and he shared the Futurists’ future-oriented fascination with machines, movement and technology. In this respect, his modernism reflects an external world.\n\nThe members of the Halmstad group, on the other hand – the brothers Axel and Erik Olson, Waldemar Lorentzon, Esaias Thorén, Sven Jonson and Stellan Mörner – were initially strongly influenced by GAN, but in time became much more than GAN’s followers; they in turn came to interest the older colleague in the inner reality that can be expressed through Surrealism. GAN and the Halmstad group had a close relationship for many years and will probably always remain closely linked in Swedish art history. This exhibition is, if nothing else, a reminder of that.\n\nA warm welcome!\n\nFor more information or to book a private viewing please contact us at: info@amells.com or 08-611 41 93.\n\nPicture: Gösta Adrian-Nilsson, Melting Furnace, oil on canvas, 64.5 x 54.5 cm, signed GAN.
