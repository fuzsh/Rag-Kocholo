        "text": "Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well.\n\nOne of the fab things about having a blog that’s now in it’s tenth year, is that people eventually get to see your postings, especially if they are concerning illustrators from the 1960’s who don’t often appear online. Such is the case with the aristic duo Dale and Betty Maxey who I have previously written about here, here and more recently here.\n\nFirstly, I got an email from James Tate, who kindly contacted me to say that he had a publicity shot of Betty with his father and would I like a copy\n\n… well of course I would and so here it is.\n\nFrom left.. the first person is unidentified, then Chuck Kessler, Betty Maxey, James’s father Don Tate & Tom Hoyne. If anyone knows who the first person on the left might be then James would like to find out. Thanks again for sharing this lovely shot.\n\nSecondly, just a couple of weeks ago, Jose messaged me. He has just recently inherited Dale and Betty’s old house and on visiting, he discovered that they had left a whole collection of original artwork that he wanted to share with me and ultimately find a buyer for. I was very excited when a rather huge zip file appeared, full of wonderful midcentury goodies from both Dale and Betty’s portfolios.\n\nThere’s so much that it not only took me a long time to assemble into a format to be able to show you, but I’ve also decided to split it up into a few posts so that you don’t get overwelmed all at once. If anyone has an idea what these paintings maybe worth or is interested in buying them, I can gladly put you in touch with Jose.\n\nLet’s start with some of Betty’s paintings. There’s no information or dates with most of the images, so we can only assume they are studies for her work or personal paintings of friends etc that have never before been seen. How exciting …..\n\nI particulalry like these first three. Partly because people rarely seem to draw their sitters smiling (as it’s hard to hold a smile for that long whilst posing for a portrait), and the beautiful ‘woman with cat’ painting, where the diagonal stripe across the paper shows all the detail and captures so much.\n\nBetty was best known for her illustrations for children’s books like some of the Famous Five stories. She also painted portraits and did advertising work, creating images to accompany stories for magazine articles.\n\nPerhaps some still life paintings, just for her own enjoyment. Obviously practising her figure drawing was essential and she made numerous studies to perfect her skills.\n\nEveryday scenes were important too. Perhaps some of these helped her illustrate how versatile an artist she was to any potential employers.\n\nNature studies.\n\nLocation studies, perhaps drawn whilst on holiday and then made into limited edition prints.\n\nHer models came in all sizes and age groups.\n\nI wonder how many of these sitters were friends and people she knew.\n\nShe certainly captured the essence of a person in her sketches.\n\nThese were finished drawings for books, you can see Betty referencing on which page they should appear in the book.\n\nOther projects.\n\nHistorical references and skies.\n\nI’m pretty sure she must have had a cat.\n\nAll in a days work. Friends chatting on a sofa, a beautiful study of an outdoor scene and the profile of a busy gent at his desk. Mad Men era.\n\nI hope you enjoyed looking through Betty’s delightful work as much as I did. More about her husband Dale Maxey in a few weeks too. If you know anyone who could tell me what these paintings might be worth, then I’d also be interested to know. craig@fishink.co.uk thank you.\n\nInstagram has been a great source for finding new artists and designers for me lately. I’m forever (mentally) OOO-ing and AHH-ing at the wealth and range of people’s creative styles and talent. I am taking part, on Instagram, in the #artistsupportpledge which was created by the Matthew Burrows Studio for artists to have a platform from which to sell their work.\n\nHere’s some of my latest work before it goes off to be kiln fired today. Fingers crossed that the fire gods are in a good mood lol\n\nI have more ceramics and Illustration work available for sale on there right now and you can find me by clicking here. Please remember to follow me @fishinkblog so you can see the latest work and blog posts that are happening weekly. Thank you to everyone who has helped support my work and has made a purchase lately too, it all helps enormously.\n\nToday’s guest Sarah Allen, inspired me from the moment I first spotted her beautiful birds on Instagram and from there on in, I was hooked !\n\nSarah lives in Austratlia and works in a marvelous studio where she breathes in nature and creates her own beautiful version of it. I tracked her down and she was kind enough to answer a few questions for us.\n\nWhat’s your earliest memory of spending time doing artistic pursuits ?\n\nI was always drawing and crafting as a kid. I remember taking great care in lettering fancy headings with my Derwent pencils in primary school. I was always making something but never gave creativity much thought as something serious or as a career option as I didn’t know anyone who was a professional artist.\n\nWhen did you first realise you had developed a definite style to your work ?\n\nAround 2014, I decided to change careers and become a professional illustrator. I started taking courses with Make Art That Sells, taught by Lilla Rogers. The courses are fast-paced and you produce a lot of work in a short amount of time. After taking several courses and working on developing my folio over three or so years, I began to see my style emerge.\n\nWhich other artists presently inspire you?\n\nSo many that it’s hard to name a few. I’m a huge fan of Yuval Zommer’s non-fiction picture books. His series, “The Big Book of Blue” … are fun, vibrant and filled with interesting facts. I love them as an adult and would have loved them as a kid. Other artists that I’m currently inspired by include: Miroco Machiko for her unique drawing style and distorted shapes, Makoto Kagoshima’s amazing decorative ceramics, Ophelia Pang for her beautiful abstracted patterns and colour sensibility, and Anne Bentley who draws people and plants in such a unique, stylish way.\n\nDo you have any plans to expand into other ranges, such as gift wrap , textiles etc ? I think some of your prints would work really well in these areas.\n\nThank you, Craig! I had the pleasure of seeing my art on gift wrap for the first time earlier this year. I’d love to design more for this market area and have plans to expand my ranges. My gift wrap and cards are available through Earth Greetings.\n\nYour love of Nature is clearly an important part of your work and all that you create. Where do you see your work going in the next few years ?\n\nThe natural world always inspires me. Australia just had the most devastating bushfire season on record and we have a huge list of threatened and critically endangered species. I feel that it’s really important to create art about the species we have on this planet in this extraordinary moment in time. No matter what I create, I hope to make beautiful things that bring people joy. If my work can also educate through delight, then that would make me very happy.\n\nDo you have a particular colour palette that you work to or just a feel for colours that work in any particular line or collected product range ?\n\nI tend to gravitate towards greens and yellows and need to make a conscious effort to mix things up. I love experimenting with how colours play off each other and the moods that can create. I think there are benefits to sticking to colour palettes for bodies of work and creating collections. To date, I’ve tended to jump around a bit more than that but I’d like to explore working in collections some more.\n\nWhich is your most favourite item ?\n\nI think the Regents Honeyeaters image is my favourite because it’s where I hit upon subject matter that I care about, expressed in a way that seems really me. Visually, it is a culmination of colour, transparency and crisp shapes that are common throughout my work. This piece is also one of my first bird drawings which led me to draw a bird series which, in turn, led me to write the text for a picture book. I was lucky enough to get a publishing deal and I’m currently working on the illustrations. The book is due out at the end of 2020.\n\nSarah is no stranger when it comes to creating books, she has a fair few under her Illustrator’s belt already.\n\nShe has also decorated buildings !\n\nShe also has an eye on the food and drink market. Take a look at some of her stunning retro-flavoured artwork below.\n\nSarah says:- “Since becoming a full-time illustrator, I’ve mainly focused on illustration commissions and children’s book work. I’ve always loved pattern though, and I’d love to see my art on textiles and homewares too. I hope to make more time for experimental, personal work because that is where my work seems to evolve the most”\n\nBeautiful work, full of life and energy. Thanks again Sarah for answering my questions, the best of luck with your new book.\n\nYou can find more from Sarah on her Instagram account or website.\n\nGood Morning everyone. I hope this finds you well and getting used to the new indoor routines and way of living.\n\nFor those of you who are familiar with my blog, you will know that I work predominantly as an artist and ceramist and sell my work through shops and fairs in the local Manchester area. Like many other artists, all of my ususal places to sell and display my work are closed which makes the idea of making a living quite difficult. I heard about a trend that was developing established by an artist called Matthew Burrows. He created the idea on Instagram of the #artistsupportpledge, a page where people like myself could showcase their work with a view to selling and creating a small living again. For every £1000 raised, each artist agrees to spend £200 on another artist or artists work within the pledge community, thus creating a place where people can view and purchase work and keep some flow of funding trickling through the arts community.\n\nI therefore have a favour to ask my readers. Firstly, if you are on Instagram could you please follow my account which is @fishinkblog (www.instagram.com/fishinkblog), please tell your friends to pop over and do the same and have a look at the work I have for sale right now, which I’m adding to daily. There is quite a range of different items from original hand drawn Illustrations and artwork. Greeting cards and Ceramics, all made by hand by myself and in this quiet time I’m even taking on personal commissions for drawing quirky characters of your choice.\n\nMy Illustrations start from £10 plus p&p for a small (8 x 12.5 cms) hand drawn piece of artwork and a greeting card.\n\nSome drawings come from sketches and some of my artwork inspire greeting cards (like the cat above).\n\nLarger collage work ( 20 x 20 cms) are £30 plus p&p. Everything is individually designed, drawn, cut out and assembled my hand.\n\nLarger framed work (25.5 x 30.5 cms) is £50 plus p&p.\n\nHand drawn black and white inks for £30 plus p&p.\n\nCeramic brooches for £8 plus p&p.\n\nDifferent sized Fish for hanging on your wall (with a wall hook attached), these guys are £10 each plus p&p.\n\nBirds at £15 plus p&p.\n\nCeramic Cats, Dogs and Creatures, different sizes and prices ranging from £15 plus p&p.\n\nTo £22 plus p&p\n\nDogs at £22 plus p&p.\n\nSmaller Cats at £18 plus p&p.\n\nSome Cats and Dogs who get along !! at £22 plus p&p.\n\nIf you know of anyone in need of a beautiful birthday, wedding, lockdown or ‘treat yourself’ present, please have a think about the work available at Fishinkblog on Instagram.\n\nI sell using secure payments through Paypal (which you don’t need to have an account to use) and ship all over the world.\n\nJust a thought, happy week ahead and I’ll be back with another artists work next week. Thanks for listening, reading and being part of Fishink Blog too. Much appreciated, Craig.\n\nHi Everyone, Happy Easter if you are celebrating this holiday where you live or a happy start to your week anyway. I’ve a special treat for you today with a toe dipping into the world of celebrity caricature.\n\nI recently made contact with Peter Emmerich, whose stunning work has caught my eye for some time now and asked if he would like to feature in a blog post.\n\nI half expected there to be a long delay in hearing back from Peter, (who must be a rather busy chap being Art Director at Disney TV Animation and having over 39,000 followers on instagram alone !), but to my surprise (and delight) he messaged back within ten minutes saying ” Hi Craig, I’ve admired your blog for years ! It would be a privilege and an honour! ” Wow I thought what a great start.\n\nHi Peter, can I begin by asking what’s your earliest memory of drawing, and who first got you interested in being an artist?\n\nI can remember drawing alongside my brother who is also talented artistically (but did not pursue it professionally). My mother was very supportive when I was little and never inhibited me from drawing. If I said I wanted to draw, she would hand me a stack of typing paper and pencils or markers and allow me to just do what I wanted, as long as I didn’t make a mess. As I got older, I can recall both of my parents being incredibly supportive of my gifts and really encouraging me to use them.\n\nHow right to describe your artistic talents as ‘gifts’.\n\nHow long have you been working with Disney? Did they find you or how did your meeting come about ? Would you call it your dream job ?\n\nThis June will mark a 25 year association with The Walt Disney Company. I was recruited straight out of college, graduating on a Friday from The Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC, and starting at Disney that following Monday. A marvelous woman named Cyndee Whitney who had been an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation was now recruiting artists from around the country to be a part of an apprenticeship training program at Walt Disney Consumer Products. I was very lucky to be included and it was the best training of my life. A dream job, to say the least.\n\nA Happy Quarter Century for June too !\n\nI’m sure you can spot a few famous faces here today.\n\nI read in your blog back in 2008 that you have a gent called John Quinn to thank for advising you to carry and use a sketchbook at all times. What advice would you give to young artists today who want to be like you and follow their dreams in illustration ?\n\nJohn Quinn is a great friend and we were both part of the Disney apprentice program in 1996. He kept and still keeps the most beautiful sketchbooks. Watching him draw and keep his books filled had an enormous influence on how I approached drawing and learning to draw. It was his influence that made me pick up a book and draw it it daily. It was the most important influence on my draughtsmanship, and I am so grateful to John for having inspired me to do it. Learning to draw and observe things properly has allowed me to be able to have a career. I am always practicing my craft, but I would advise any young person to spend a period of their life drawing and keeping sketchbooks and truly learn to observe what they see and interpret it in their own unique way. Draw, draw, draw.\n\nWhen you start work on a new caricature, what process do you go through to get the results you’re happy with ?\n\nThe process of caricature is something I have always been fascinated by. I gather lots of reference and study them all. Quite often when I start a drawing, I am drawing from my memory of the images and my interpretation of who I feel the person is, not directly from one photo. Sometimes one image dominates because it is the essence of who I feel that person is, but mainly I am drawing a feeling, not a photo. I will also listen to that persons music, or play their films, or even listen to interviews of them speaking. I believe it helps me to imbue their feeling into the drawing.\n\nWhat mediums do you most love to use.. digital.. paints etc ?\n\nI work in all media really. Most of my professional work is done digitally because it is faster and I can easily correct and change work according to the requests of my editors/art directors, When I am just drawing for myself it is a mix of both but I have a tendency to lean more towards traditional media, especially ink. I have been sculpting more lately as well as some collage work.\n\nI love the book you have out at the moment, do you have any plans for other books or products ? Famous greeting cards come to mind lol.\n\nThere are other things in the works, but I can’t speak about them specifically at the moment. I will just say thank you for liking the new book, and know there is more to come!\n\nDo you feel it’s harder or easier to draw famous people? There maybe hundreds of photos of them for reference but then everyone knows what they look like!\n\nWhat’s funny is until I illustrated my first children’s book last year, A is for Audra: Broadway’s Leading Ladies from A to Z , I had never drawn any caricature for professional purposes, it was only for my personal joy. I tend to only draw people I liked or admire or want to pay tribute to, which means I have some level of emotional interest in them. Somehow that makes it easier for me. If you asked me to draw someone I was not interested in, I could do it, but my heart wouldn’t be in it quite the same way. I like drawing people I feel something for and it is usually the version of them that says who they are to me. I was once asked to do a caricature of Cher, which I was happy to take on, but I asked the person, “Which Cher? 70’s long and sleek Sonny and Cher, Cher? 80’s Moonstruck, dancing on an aircraft carrier Cher?” The period says so much about the person and how they should be interpreted. It goes beyond just hair and clothes.\n\nWho has been the hardest to draw and why ? Who have you most enjoyed drawing ?\n\nI had the hardest time drawing Michael Jackson in my first attempt. I had this very elaborate idea in my head of how I wanted him to be posed. Something that really reflected his energy and spirit. I roughed it out and labored over it for hours trying to get everything that would define his gesture just so. It was awful….I stopped and opened a new document in Photoshop and without much thought, from memory, drew an extremely closeup image of just his facial features. It honestly could not have taken more than five minutes and that wound up being the one I went with. It said all I needed to say, I just added some color to it. I enjoy drawing Liza Minnelli very much, she has so much energy and liveliness that whenever I draw her, it comes through very naturally and effortlessly. Nina Simone and Elizabeth Taylor are also subjects that I tend to return to quite a lot.\n\nWhat ambitions do you still want to achieve and where do you see your career taking you in the future ?\n\nI am enjoying working in children’s books very much at the moment. Since we have had so much time where we are required to be at home, I am getting the chance to experiment with new styles and projects. I would like to write and illustrate my own books as well as illustrate other authors’ work. I would like to start designing and making short films as well. I am lucky because I get to enjoy my job developing children’s programming at Disney as an art director and I get to experiment with fun personal projects at home.\n\nPeter thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule to answer my questions and be a part of Fishinkblog. It’s been great getting to look through your portfolio and I look forward to seeing what you have in store for the future. There’s plenty more of Peter’s work on tumblr, blogspot and Instagram.\n\nHi there and I hope this finds you all well, I picture you snuggled down with a cuppa ready to be visually entertained lol. Well I hope not to disappoint with the vibrant and fun artist I have in store for you today.\n\nI’ve been following Helen Foster’s company Rollerdog for quite a while now. Helen is an Illustrator and Designer, living in Derbyshire. She is also on Instagram as rollerdogdesign. As you can probably tell, Helen, like myself, has a penchant for lovely (and often lanky) longdogs! Here’s a couple of her initial drawings.\n\nI messaged Helen to ask her more about her company.\n\nHow did you first become interested in the Lurcher, Greyhound, Whippety dogs that you illustrate?\n\nI’ve always been enchanted by the gentle elegance of these dogs with their supremely long snouts, and their affectionate, sweet nature really appeals to me. I had a whippet called Speedy and sort of shared our neighbour’s beautiful greyhound, Talent, who I had a deep bond with. I also love it that despite their noble appearance, they often have hilarious, tangled sleeping positions and some extremely goofy facial expressions.\n\nI noticed that you had been inspired by some great pics of other hounds from Instagram, which helped create some of your wonderful designs. Do you have any plans to branch out into more products using antics from pet profiles online as your inspiration? Perhaps it could be a competition for a new tea towel design lol\n\nThat’s a lovely idea! I’ve run a few competitions in the past and invited folks to upload their hound photos and I was overwhelmed with the funny and touching responses. And yes, I’ve been so inspired by my Instagram feed: I love the ‘pile of whippets’ photos of @cosmicpearlwhippet, and those of your very own Boo of course! I really enjoy making a cup of tea and scrolling through the beautiful photos and incredible artwork that’s being made all over the world. Talking of Instagram, I’ve found happiness in the ‘creative hub’ experience of getting to know fellow creatives. As an example, a creative ‘visual conversation’ started after I made drawings based on some of @cosmicpearlshippet’s beautiful whippety flower crown photos. Jane then recreated her original photo, complete with flower crown and a handmade collar to match the collar I’d worked into my drawing, as you can see in these photos:\n\nWhat is your training or business-life prior to Rollerdog Design?\n\nI became a freelance illustrator after leaving uni in the late nineties, and carried out commissions for some wonderful and diverse clients, including educational publishing houses, charities and public sector organisations. One memorable project was to design the children’s range of packaging for Hotel Chocolat, for which I was part-paid in Turkish delight! (Don’t worry Association of Illustrators, I was paid properly in actual money too).\n\nI love the fact that you donate to the Forever Hounds Trust. Did you choose this worth-while Charity for a specific reason?\n\nIt started with a phone call from Naomi from the charity, who’d seen my work online, and we hit it off. Afterwards I looked at the gorgeous hounds on their website and I’ve never looked back. They have a fabulous team of volunteers who rescue abused or abandoned greyhounds, lurchers and other sighthounds from all over the country.\n\nI believe the business is more than 2 years old, is this a full-time venture for you or something that’s still developing and growing?\n\nAnswering this question reminded me that Rollerdog turned 3 in January this year, and I completely forgot to celebrate! Yes, it’s a full time venture which continues to grow. It still feels new and I don’t get bored – there are always new products to try my designs out on (some more successful than others…let’s try to forget the unfortunate saggy socks experiment of January 2020).\n\nCushions, Tote Bags, Cards, Coasters, Aprons, Magnets, Tea Towels and Keyrings… what’s next for Rollerdog Design?\n\nI often get asked about producing art prints and have recently found a fab print house that produces beautiful quality prints onto a range of art papers, so I’d like to offer this as an option in my shop. I’d also like to look further into getting my work licensed so that I can spend more time making new designs (although retail that can be great fun, and not meaning to lay it on too thick but I’ve truly never had a mean customer. I receive the most touching feedback, sometimes with very sweet photos – and quite often with the hound interacting with their new Rollerdog goody in the cutest ways, as you can see in these photos, the first one giving new meaning to the term ‘doggy-bag’ !\n\nI’m loving the new cards and would like to see more of a range of those that you can purchase separately or together with the gift selection you presently offer. Also a few more male centered doggy designs for us dog loving males too : )\n\nI’ve been talking with my printing chap (@artistgiftprinting) who produces the cards and we’re hoping to start offering just the cards on their own in the months to come. I’m also planning to bring some other animals into the mix, such as one of my favourite mammals of all time, the beautiful but endangered pangolin. I’m also a great fan of the beautifully dinosaurial rhea and seeing a hare in the wild always gives me a jolt of happiness – and they need our help too due to the cruel sport of hare coursing.\n\nAny other dog related businesses or Illustrators work that you follow and admire?\n\nSo many. One of my favourite artists who also happens to love sighthounds is Whyn Lewis (@whynlewispaintings). I admire the characterful drawings of J. Otto Seibold (@jottoseibold) and Marc Boutavant (@chienpourriii) and Helen Dardik (@helen_dardik) produces the most gorgeous, fun patterns and paintings. Not dog-related I know but as a lifelong Moomin lover I find the work of the wonderfully wise and funny Tove Jansson endlessly inspiring. The list could go on and on.\n\nMany thanks Helen for your informative, amusing replies. I get a sense that you match your chirpy characters very well ; ) I recently bought four beautiful coasters which I admire everytime I make a cuppa, which as were all in home isolation right now.. is quite often these days lol. How fab are these ? You can purchase anything from Rollerdog’s great range of gifts here and tell Helen I sent you : ).\n\nStay Safe everyone, I’m thinking of you all.\n\nHello everyone and welcome to a rather special and rather beautiful return to the Mad March Hare. I spotted these guys recently doing their crazy boxing and looking rather splendid in the early morning /evening glows.\n\nThey reminded me of the work I’d seen a while ago at one of the Great Northern Contemporary Craft Fairs, by Embroiderer and Needle Felting Artist, Zoe Stainton. (https://zoestaintonsculpture.com )\n\nI tracked down Zoe’s site (www.zoestaintonsculpture.com) and asked her a few quick questions.\n\nHi Zoe, where did your knowledge and love of embroidery originate from ?\n\nHI Craig, I am self taught in Felting and embroidery. I was actually originally trained in Ceramics B.A & M.A at U.W.I.C, Cardiff.\n\nHow did you first get inspired to create the animals you do ?\n\nI suppose it was the natural thing to do , living in Holmfirth and surrounded by beautiful landscape and wildlife I was simply inspired by what’s around me.\n\nYour pieces are wonderfully realistic, do you ever surprise yourself by thinking there is a Fox or Badger when you enter your studio room ?\n\nI think the very nature and qualities of needle felting means you can create life-like animals. Although my latest ideas are leading me down the path of more experimental use of textiles and using printing within the piece.\n\nWhat is the most common reaction when people see your work ? Any unusual responses ?\n\nPeople love the fact they are realistic and very tactile. They are sometimes surprised by the fact the eyes are all felted and not glass and that they are so light in weight.\n\nWhen you see the animals up close you can appreciate the intricate work that helps make them so realistic. Such lovely details.\n\nHow long would it take you to create a large Hare and is each one different in it’s own way from previous Hares ?\n\nIt can take me around two weeks to create a larger piece. Yes they are all unique which I love. The layering of colour and stitching is difficult to replicate and that is not my intention. Each piece has its own unique presence and character.\n\nAre there more animals that you are thinking of introducing into your range and if so what are they ? I personally would love to see some red squirrels and hedgehogs : )\n\nI’m currently working on some new ideas through drawing, something I need to do more of. I’m firstly looking at making an urban and rural fox incorporating textile elements. I also want to explore the idea of mother & daughter bonds , experiment with textiles and printing onto textiles which can be used in my pieces.\n\nAny plans for other gift products, greeting cards or gift wrap featuring your animals would be lovely too ?\n\nA lot to do but I’m very enthused and excited about pushing my work forward.\n\nThanks Zoe for the insight into your beautiful work. We will certainly be watching this space for more animals coming along in the year ahead. In the meantime you can also catch Zoe on Instagram (@zoestaintonsculpture).\n\nIf you liked this post check out the work of Mister Finch too."
