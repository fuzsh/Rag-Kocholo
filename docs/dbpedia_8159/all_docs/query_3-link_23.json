        "text": "Oskar Korsár\n\nReflections on Styx\n\n18 may – 8 june\n\nIt is with great pleasure that Åmells presented Oskar Korsár, whose original art stands alone among artists working today. His paintings invite us into an intriguing and magical world populated by human-like figures and mythical characters. The thirty new works, five bronze sculptures and twenty-five drawings, included in this exhibition were carefully selected and, like the exhibition's title, reflected the fascinating expression that Korsár possesses. The variety of techniques testifies to the fact that he is an artist in possession of considerable talent and broad knowledge, which in turn reflects the artistic values that Åmells has stood for for generations.\n\nSpring Exhibition 2024\n\nApril 13 – May 4\n\nAfter an unusually cold winter, it is wonderful to be able to present a well-composed Spring Exhibition. Here, all those who long for brighter and milder days can get a taste of the scents and colours of spring and summer, conveyed by some of the Nordic region's most talented artists. Highlights include Carl Fredrik Hill, Anders Zorn and Hilma af Klint. Among the modernists, several stand out for their exceptional quality. Gösta Adrian Nilsson's, as well as Isaac Grünewald and Sigrid Hjertén, were represented. For those who appreciate somewhat rarer artists, the Spring Exhibition had several treats to offer. Akseli Gallen-Kallela, Robert Thegerström, Åke Göransson and Tor Bjurström are relatively rare in Åmell's selection, but their works are well worthy of attention. The paintings are representative both of the individual artists and of the period in which they worked, and are also united by a very high artistic quality. Carl Milles shone this time alone in the sculpture section with two majestic bronzes in which his figures twist, bend or seemingly float freely in the air in a way that is unique to Milles.\n\nCarl Larsson\n\nas Illustrator\n\n54 illustrations for Anna Maria Lenngren's\n\nCollected Poems\n\nMarch 16 – 28 2024\n\nThe exhibition presented 54 drawings, all original works by Carl Larsson, executed directly on paper. They are part of a suite of a total of 138 illustrations that Larsson made in 1883-84 on behalf of Adolf Bonnier's publishing house to be included in their magnificent edition of Anna Maria Lenngren's (1754-1817) poetry collection Samlade Skaldeförsök. The poetry collection was first published in 1819 and has since been revised and edited in several editions, of which Bonnier's magnificent edition from 1884 is considered the most lavish. Although Carl Larsson became increasingly established as a painter from the 1880s onwards, he never completely abandoned his role as a draughtsman and illustrator. He undertook numerous illustration assignments for various Christmas magazines, books and collections of fairy tales, and from 1895 he also began publishing his own texts and images inspired by his home and private life in Sundborn, Dalarna.\n\nColour and Form:\n\nmodern art for\n\nFolkhemmet\n\nFebruary 10 – March 2 2024\n\nIn May 1932, some 10 Swedish artists formally joined forces to found the Föreningen Färg och Form (Colour and Form Association) in Stockholm. The aim was primarily to promote the economic interests of the artists. By creating a common marketing platform and starting their own gallery business, they would gain better control over the sale of their works and avoid costly intermediaries. The initiators of the association included Axel Nilsson, Eric Hallström, Bror Hjorth, Sven X-et Erixson and Albin Amelin.\n\nWith the exhibition Färg och Form-gruppen - modern art for the Folkhemmet, Åmells wants to do its bit to consolidate the importance of the group's existence. It presents nine artists, all of whom were part of Färg och Form's core group and who were either founders or otherwise active members of the association during its first 20 years.\n\nIce and Snow:\n\nGustaf Fjæstad and others\n\ndecember 9 – january 9 2023/24\n\nIn this year's winter exhibition, Åmells highlighted the changing stages of the Nordic winter and rich variety in art. For artists in general and landscape painters in particular, winter brings both challenge and inspiration, and in the exhibition the many faces of winter were depicted in forest areas as well as in frozen lakes, archipelago environments, urban landscapes and the Norrland panorama. In the presentation, the effects of the cool winds were just as clearly felt in Gustaf Fjæstad's sparkling winter pieces and Roland Svensson's paintings of the snow covered archipelago as in Frits Thaulow's counterparts from Norway or August Hagborg, Anton Genberg and Nils Kreuger's Stockholm scenes.\n\nAutumn Exhibition 2023\n\nnovember 4 – 25 2023\n\nWhen Åmells began producing annual autumn and spring shows nearly forty years ago, the idea was that they should reflect both the breadth and depth of our steady supply of high-class Nordic art. In terms of time and style, the works spanned over a hundred years, from the second half of the 19th century to the mid-1960s. In terms of motifs, most artistic genres were covered: portraits and landscapes, still lifes, interior pictures, fairytale motifs, marines and city views. Among the highlights this autumn were Anders Zorn's portrait of Gods-Kari and Helene Schjerfbeck's Girl with a long neck, Ingeborg Westfelt-Eggertz's Self-portrait with a cigarette, Carl Holsöe's fine-tuned Interior with a young woman reading by a window, Erik Olson's alter ego in Interior with a view, GAN's Industri and Carl Kylberg's Figure on balcony. With this, Åmells wanted to emphasise that we were proud to once again be able to present a richly varied, high-quality and representative Autumn show with several brilliant works.\n\nBruno Liljefors with Brush and Rifle\n\nseptember 16 – October 7 2023\n\nBruno Liljefors: with Brush and Rifle offered a comprehensive overview of Liljefors' extensive body of work, ranging from the early tentative successes of his youth to the mature artist's masterful interpretations of his perspective on nature. The individual pieces showcased both wild and domesticated animals, portrayed in forested plains, meadows, wetlands, archipelagos, and coastal landscapes. Several paintings also captured the unique relationship between humans and dogs in hunting scenarios. Bruno Liljefors was an avid hunter himself, and the phenomenon of hunting fascinated him on various levels. Most of the displayed works were created using oil or watercolour, although the selection also included drawings, oil studies, and sculptures. Furthermore, the majority of these works had recently been exhibited at the Jamtli art museum in Östersund during 2022-23. Just like the curators at Jamtli, Åmells aimed to emphasise with this exhibition that Bruno Liljefors' art never loses its relevance. In a world where untouched nature is increasingly becoming a scarce resource, his subjects evoke a deep sense of yearning within us.\n\nFlowers and Leaves still lives of the ages\n\nAugust 7 – 26 2023\n\nFlowers and leaves: still lifes of all times were a contribution to the understanding of the meaning and function of leaves and flowers in the pictorial tradition of painting, as much as independent still life motifs as clear elements in other stylistic means of expressions. The emphasis was on 20th century painting with the exhibition taking its temporal point of departure in a stately early modern floral piece. The presentation then moved on past the Danish Golden Age towards the late 19th century masters and the modern breakthrough to finally reach the modernist pinnacle. The exhibition contained genuine floral still lifes as well as views, landscape pictures and interior motifs, all of which were united in their separate, but skillful, representations of nature's delightful representatives.\n\nIslets and rocks Roland Svensson\n\nand others\n\nJune 10 – July 7 2023\n\nThe painter's meeting with islets and rocks, coast and sea was the common thread in the 2023 summer exhibition at Åmells. The exhibition was based on Roland Svensson's atmospheric depictions of the Stockholm archipelago landscape. The thematic cohesion in the presentation was defined by the overarching sea theme and the variety found in the seascape. Among the artists represented, in addition to Roland Svensson, were painters such as Axel Sjöberg as well as prominent generational peers such as Oskar Bergman and Albert Engström. Also highlighted were Thure Wallner and Christian Swensson, as well as Maria Wiik and the contemporary mediator Jonas Nilsson, who took place among the colleagues with animal depictions that allowed the viewer get really close to the seabirds in careful, slightly impressionistic works.\n\nSpring exhibition 2023\n\nApril 22 – May 13 2023\n\nWhen Åmells welcomed the spring of 2023, the emphasis was on all the scents and colours of the bright season. The painting by Carl Larsson (1853–1919) that graced the cover of the comprehensive catalog was just one of many examples of what Åmell's Spring Show had to offer from the Nordic art treasure. The presentation also contained works by Georg Pauli, Olle Olsson-Hagalund, Einar Jolin, Anna Palm de Rosa and Isaac Grünewald among many others. In Carl Larsson's watercolor Evening Blush, it was the Nordic summer evening that framed the main motif and conveyed the special mood that penetrates so deeply into many art-loving souls. Also participating were Gothenburg colourists such as Ivan Ivarson and Inge Schiöler as well as Sigrid Hjertén, Agnes Cleve and Vera Nilsson, along with Anders Zorn and Albert Edelfeldt.\n\nHelmer Osslund\n\nTones of Norrland\n\nMarch 18 – April 6 2023\n\nIn the exhibition Tones of Norrland, Helmer Osslund's depictions of the Norrland landscape were presented in high-pitched compositions that reproduce the tones and shades of nature in symphonies of colour. With an expressive use of colour that seems unique in Swedish art history, Osslund gradually conquered Norrland, from Gästrikland in the south to Laponia in the north. He discovered the beauty and vicissitudes of vast landscapes he found, where his brush captured burning autumn forests, the drama of clouds in the sky and the reflection of water in rivers. Influences from Paul Gauguin and other continental experiences together with a view of nature that was slightly poetic produced highly personal stories from silent, often deserted but consistently expressive expanses.\n\nModern Pioneers GAN and the\n\nHalmstad Group\n\nFebruary 4 – 25 2023\n\nWith this presentation, Åmells wanted to give the art audience yet another example of the rich variety of Swedish modernism. At the same time, the significance of the friendships and mutual exchanges of artistic experience that often arose across both national and generational boundaries in interwar European art metropolises was highlighted. In the exhibition, GAN – Gösta Adrian-Nilsson – represented the Swedish avant-garde in the early 20th century. The Halmstad Group, in turn, interested the older colleague in the inner reality that can be expressed through surrealism. GAN and the Halmstad Group had a close relationship for many years and will probably always remain closely connected in Swedish art history. This exhibition was, if nothing else, a reminder of that.\n\nJonas Nilsson\n\nfrom mountain to sea\n\ndecember 17 – 22 2022 and january 9 – 14 2023\n\nThe anniversary year's exhibition program was filled with ventures that were all out of the ordinary, and the last presentation of the year was no exception. Jonas Nilsson should by now be familiar to most people who have followed Åmell's operations in recent years. When he returned to the gallery for a fifth solo exhibition, the opportunity was given for deeper insights into his circle of motifs. In Jonas Nilsson - from mountains to sea, the gaze was directed towards nature's varied visual world, and especially the kingdom of birds. With pen and eye, binoculars and sketchpad, Nilsson chases the immediate moments on nature's stage. Jonas Nilsson was born in 1968 and lives and works in Uppsala, where he works in both oil and watercolour. He has exhibited on around forty occasions in Sweden and abroad.\n\nWest Coast\n\nPaintersfrom Carl Wilhelmson\n\nto Inge Schiöler\n\nNovember 26 – December 10 2022\n\nVästkustmålarna: from Carl Wilhelmson to Inge Schiöler was last among Åmell's theme initiatives during the Jubilee Year 2022, when we celebrated that it was 100 years since we were established in Stockholm. The exhibition connected to the year's previous gatherings in such a way that the content was concentrated on motifs and artistry that were not included in any of the Jubilee Year's previous presentations, and here there were common denominators between all the artists who were represented this time. The exhibition originated in Carl Wilhelmson and contained works by, among others, Anna Gardell Ericson, Carl Kylberg, Ragnar Sandberg, Ivan Ivarson and Johan Ericson and, of course, Inge Schiöler.\n\nAnniversary\n\nExhibitionÅmells 100 years\n\noctober 8 – 29 2022\n\nIn 2022, it was exactly 100 years since Åmells started its operations in Stockholm, and in connection with this year's traditional Autumn Show, Åmells wanted to draw a little extra attention to the 100th anniversary. We did that by letting the Autumn Show take the form of an imaginative Jubilee exhibition where quality-packed seriousness was mixed with irreverent style clashes. The Anniversary Exhibition: Åmells 100 years was an exposé of our hundred-year history, where the overall presentation revolved around three eras in Åmell's history: the antiques trade, the art trade and the gallery.\n\nIvan Aguéli\n\nspace and\n\nheavenly light\n\nseptember 3 – 17 2022\n\nÅmell's 100th anniversary celebration meant, among other things, a major investment in themed exhibitions about important and interesting artists. Ivan Aguéli (1869–1917) was an artist who went his own way and reached places, both physical and philosophical but above all artistic, that few Swedes before him had explored. For Aguéli, colour and composition functioned as metaphors for a spiritual reality where the different colours had different symbolic meaning, and in the exhibition Ivan Aguéli's unique view of art was manifested with versatile and shifting landscapes from Sweden, France, Spain and North Africa.\n\nSky & Sea\n\nAxel Sjöberg\n\n& Roland Svensson\n\nJune 11 – July 8 2022\n\nIn the summer exhibition during Åmell's 100th anniversary, the archipelago painters' rich collection of works was presented, where the effect of light on sky and sea is depicted in seascapes immersed in golden sunsets and atmospheric nocturnes. With the exhibition Sky & Sea – Axel Sjöberg & Roland Svensson, the emphasis was placed on the artistry of Axel Sjöberg and Roland Svensson, but there were also other like-minded portrayers of the breathtaking biotope that is the Stockholm archipelago.\n\nHjertén & Grünewald Masterful modernists\n\nApril 30 – May 21 2022\n\nHjertén & Grünewald was the second theme exhibition of the Jubilee Year 2022 and was a comprehensive presentation of two of the leading figures of Swedish modernism: the artist duo Sigrid Hjertén and Isaac Grünewald. An important aspect highlighted in the exhibition was the couple's mutual respect and admiration for each other's work. The exhibition featured roughly 35 works in oil, watercolour, gouache and ink, several public decoration and illustration assignments as well as costume sketches for the theatre. Grünewald's late production of floral still lifes was also abundantly represented. The exhibition included a 96-page, richly illustrated catalog with a newly written introductory essay by Görel Cavalli-Björkman, professor of art history and former head of research at the National Museum.\n\nSpring exhibition 2022 with a 1920s theme\n\nMarch 19 – April 6 2022\n\nÅmell's 100-year celebration permeated all exhibitions and events during the Anniversary Year 2022, which meant that the Spring Show had a little extra focus on the art that was new and groundbreaking when Åmells was founded. In addition to the exhibition's mixed selection of modernists such as Leander Engström, Hilding Linnqvist and Carl Milles, touches were made on 1920s Swedish avant-garde, which mainly included Erik Olson and Esaias Thorén, but also Gösta Adrian-Nilsson and Otto G. Carlsund. However, the spring exhibition did not only contain Swedish modernism and its various expressions. There were also outstanding works that were performed only a few decades earlier, but which reflected the ideals that were prevalent during the late 19th century and the time around the turn of the century 1900.\n\nCarl Fredrik Hill with brush, pen\n\nand crayon\n\nfebruary 5 – 26 2022\n\nThis exhibition started the Jubilee Year 2022 when Åmells celebrated 100 years. The exhibition, which was the largest exhibition with the Hill in decades, included a total of 28 works and spanned the artist's entire life and artistry. In addition to The Tree and the River Bend, another five oil paintings were shown, including from the famous series of Seine landscape and flowering fruit trees from Bois-le-Roi. All the oils shown were created before Hill suffered from the paranoid schizophrenic psychosis that became acute around the turn of 1877/78. The exhibition included a richly illustrated catalogue, which included an introductory essay by the prominent Hill expert Sten Åke Nilsson, professor emeritus of art history at Lund University.\n\nWhite views Winter landscapes\n\ndecember 11 2021 – January 15 2022\n\nFor artists in general and landscape painters in particular, winter brings both a challenge and a fascination, and the exhibition depicts the many faces of winter in archipelago environments and forest areas as well as in lakes, urban motifs and the Norrland panorama. In the exhibition, the effects of the cool winds were just as clearly visible in Roland Svensson's and Axel Sjöberg's captivating paintings of the archipelago in various stages of winter wear as in Helmer Osslund's highly chilled Norrland scenery and Gustaf Fjæstad's frosty water mirrors. The exhibition also included a rare winter motif by Carl Larsson together with works by Frits Thaulow, Moose Stoopendal, Thure Wallner, Prince Eugen and Nils Kreuger.\n\nThe artistic\n\nperspective Rolf Wertheimer\n\nnovember 27 – december 10 2021\n\nThe artistic perspective presented Rolf Wertheimer's photographs of the bustling public life in Stockholm, the vibrant 1960s at the Modern Museum and the audience's encounter with avant-garde art, the youth gangs on Kungsgatan and the inauguration of the modern Hötorgscity, as well as a series of Wertheimer's abstract paintings from early 1950s onwards. Wertheimer is one of the great Stockholm portrayers in Swedish photography. His interest in the camera as an artistic medium was sparked in 1956, when he discovered Henri Cartier-Bresson's book Images à la Sauvette. Inspired by the book's photographs of street life in Paris, Wertheimer himself has since the 1950s captured the zeitgeist with a keen eye and documented the city and its inhabitants.\n\nIrving Penn The Artist’s Eye\n\nOctober 30 – November 20 2021\n\nIrving Penn (1917–2009) was one of the foremost photographers of the 20th century. Renowned for his powerful images and masterful developing techniques, Penn early developed a visual language where surface and form were tastefully accentuated in his photographs of both people and things. With a career that spanned six decades, Irving Penn is a central figure in the evolution of photography, and his iconic work has shaped the art and fashion worlds as well as generations of photographers. In the exhibition, supermodels in haute couture were displayed side-by-side portraits of both a crown prince and a member of the Hells Angels alongside still life images and Miles Davis' hands on the trumpet. All exhibited works came directly from the artist through The Irving Penn Foundation.\n\nAutumn Exhibition 2021\n\noctober 2 – 16 2021\n\nThis year's Autumn Show at Åmells revolved around three key words: fairytale, dream and reality. These three words formed the innermost core of several of the exhibition's most important and significant works. The dream as a starting point for artistic creation was also evident in several of the exhibition's works by Hilding Linnqvist, Axel Nilsson, Olle Olsson Hagalund and Erik Olson. Among the artists who strove for a true-to-life art in the exhibition, as so often, Bruno Liljefors was in a class of his own. Three of the female artists of the late 19th century also made a big impression in this exhibition: Elisabeth Keyser, Charlotte Wahlström and Anna Palm. The Autumn Show also featured two of Carl Larsson's exquisite watercolours: Brita at the piano and Lilla Karin.\n\nJonas Nilsson In still waters\n\nseptember 4 – 18 2021\n\nIn the exhibition In still waters, snapshots that arise in the encounter with events in nature were shown. During Jonas Nilsson's walks in the woods and fields, he collects impressions and visual experiences that inspire him for the motifs in the nature depictions. In this exhibition, Nilsson's classic approach to nature painting was displayed. When Åmells introduced this virtuoso animal and nature painter to the art public in 2018, it was a huge success and today, Nilsson is one of the foremost nature painters.\n\nOur capital in\n\nthe artsAnna Palm and others\n\naugust 14 – 27 2021\n\nOur Capital in the Arts, Anna Palm and others depicted the story of Stockholm city's many faces. The exhibition showcased outstanding vistas and genre-like urban motifs, landscapes and buildings reproduced with great topographical accuracy, which gives them a special position as documents of the time. At the center were Anna Palm's (1859–1924) popular depictions of urban landscapes in watercolour painting, the technique she came to master so well that in 1889 she became the first female teacher at the Academy of Fine Arts. These paintings gave an insight into how the city and the people appeared through the ages and are united by an atmospheric scent of the times of the city life that once was.\n\nSUMMER IN\n\nTHE ARCHIPELAGORoland Svensson\n\nand others\n\nJune 19 – July 9 2021\n\nWith this exhibition, Åmells highlighted how Swedish artists interpreted and portrayed Stockholm Archipelago from several different perspectives: that of the summer visitor, that of the nature lover and that of the inveterate fisherman. Paintings by our most famous painters of the archipelago were shown here, such as Roland Svensson, Axel Sjöberg and Artur Bianchini, whose core and colouristically refined paintings have their starting point in long-term stays on Möja, Långviksskär and Sandhamn, among others.\n\nRobert Högfeldt Drollerier\n\nMay 29 – June 18 2021\n\nIn this exhibition, a considerable number of Robert Högfeldt's (1894–1986) works were shown, where humour was a typical characteristic. Högfeldt used humor to reveal human flaws, but also to highlight the small joys in life. Robert Högfeldt's humor is astonishingly accurate, but usually quite inoffensive. Högfeldt respected tolerance, so even in the pictures where the \"trolls\" act less sympathetically, he has portrayed them with mild indulgence. \"The human quality I value most is tolerance,\" he once wrote himself.\n\nSpring exhibition 2021\n\nApril 17 – May 14 2021\n\nÅmell's annual Spring Show reflected the breadth of our Nordic art treasure. The exhibition's modern section was both colorful and energetic and represented several of our most prominent artists, for example Isaac Grünewald, Olle Olsson Hagalund, Ivan Ivarson and Hilding Linnqvist. In the exhibition's classic segment, Paul Fischer and crisp summer bouquets by Olle Hjortzberg were presented, among other things. Particularly outstanding was also one of Carl Larsson's most interesting child portraits from the Sundborn period.\n\nAutumn Exhibition 2020\n\nOctober 24 - November 20 2020\n\nThis years Autumn Exhibition presented artworks of exceptionally high quality from a time span which width is unusually large. The exhibition took off in the 1600s with a splendid still life of Ottmar Elliger. Two shining stars from our Nordic neighbouring countries are Wilhelm Hammershøi and Maria Wiik. For a long time Wiik was eclipsed by her friend Helene Schjerfbeck, but have in the later years gotten a well deserved revenge. Just look at her portrait of the girl Marietta, and you will understand why! Other artists presented in this years Autumn Exhibition were Ernst Josephson, August Strindberg, Carl Fredrik Hill, Carl Larsson and many more.\n\nJonas Nilsson\n\nseptember 5 - 25 2020\n\nThe third time Åmells presented Jonas Nilsson the audience got to experience his characteristic bird portraits of smug tit birds and stoic owls, but also both majestic four-legged predators with watchful eyes and sheer butterflies captured in a fleeting dance. Jonas Nilsson really knows his models, one can tell from his titles of the paintings: the lively little Kingfisher is called the Fisherking, the quiet owl he calls the Majesty…\n\nSpring Exhibition 2020\n\nApril 25 - July 3 2020\n\nThis years’ Spring Exhibition showcased an excellent mixture of Scandinavian painting and sculpture from the 1800s and 1900s. The exhibition included artworks from our most well-known artists, such as August Strindberg, Bruno Liljefors, Helmer Osslund, GAN and Carl Milles. It also included less known artworks, for example Fanny Brate’s adorable portrait of her daughter. This years’ Spring Exhibition also presented several interesting water colours. One that deserved extra attention was Carl Larsson’s School youth Chorus at Ladugårdsgärdet.\n\nAutumn Exhibition 2019\n\nNovember 9 - December 6 2019\n\nÅmells finished the year 2019 strong by presenting its annual Autumn Exhibition with an exceptional selection of art historically significant works by some of the most prominent Nordic artists. The pièce de réstistance of the exhibition was Inferno by August Strindberg. The exhibition also featured several works by our foremost Swedish painters, where especially the works by Bruno Liljefors and Carl Larsson illustrates the immense level of talent that these artists had throughout their lives.\n\nWest Coast Painters\n\nSeptember 28 - October 18 2019\n\nThe exhibition West Coast Painters illuminates the special importance of the Swedish West Coast as a source of inspiration to many artists. The artworks shown in West Coast Painters range over a chronological span of a hundred years, dating from 1870 to 1970. The so called ”Gothenburg Colourists” form the core of the exhibition, but artist such as Alfred Wahlberg, Carl Wilhelmson and John Jon-And are also represented.\n\nHidden Treasures\n\nJune 5 - July 5 2019\n\nCertain artworks have not been met with the appreciation, accolade or the level of fame for the artist that one might expect. Thus, there are hidden treasures to discover by many artists that might not be particularly well-known to a wider public but that are, indeed, works of very high quality."
