The material includes painting, study sketches for stage designs for opera and ballet, theatre costume drawings, studies for decorative  schemes for public spaces, applied art, design, illustrations and film. The exhibitionl considers Grünewald’s strong standing in Swedish cultural life against the background of societal changes of the early and mid-twentieth century, and in relation to his social contacts and networks in Sweden and internationally.

The name is composed of Waldemar, an Old German noble male name, and udde, meaning cape. It is derived from a historical name of the island Djurgården, Valmundsö.  \n\t\n\tIt was the former home of the Swedish Prince Eugen, who discovered the place in 1892, when he rented a house there for a few days. Seven years later he bought the premises and had a new house designed by the architect Ferdinand Boberg, who also designed Rosenbad (the Prime Minister's Office and the Government Chancellery), and erected 1903–1904.\n\t\n\tPrince Eugen had been educated as a painter in Paris and after his death the house was converted to a museum of his own and others paintings. The prince died in 1947 and is buried by the beach close to the house.\n\t\n\tThe complex consists of a castle-like main building—the Mansion—completed in 1905, and the Gallery Building, added in 1913. The estate also includes the original manor-house building, known as the Old House and an old linseed mill, both dating back to the 1780s. The estate is set in parkland which features centuries-old oak trees and reflects the prince's interest for gardening and flower arrangement. The Art Nouveau interior, including the cocklestoves, by Boberg are designed in a Gustavian style and makes good use of both the panoramic view of the inlet to Stockholm and the light resulting from the elevated location of the building.\n\t\n\ten.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldemarsudde\n\t.",
