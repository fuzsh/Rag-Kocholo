Combining high and low art forms, modernism turned fashion designers into artists and vice versa.\n\nBringing together internationally renowned scholars across a range of disciplines, this vibrant volume explores the history and significance of the relationship between modernism and fashion and examines how the intimate connection between these fields remains evident today, with contemporary designers relating their work to art and artists problematizing fashion in their works.\n\nWith chapters on a variety topics ranging from Russian constructionism and clothing to tango and fashion in the early 20th century, Fashion and Modernism is essential reading for students and scholars of fashion, dress history, and art history alike.\n\nContributors:\n\nPatrizia Calefato, Caroline Evans, Ulrich Lehmann, Astrid Söderbergh Widding, Alessandra Vaccari, Olga Vainshtein, Sven-Olov Wallenstein\n\nList of Figures\n\nNotes on Contributors\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIntroduction by Louise Wallenberg and Andrea Kollnitz\n\nPART I: 'Fashion, Change, Modernism'\n\n1.Sven-Olov Wallenstein, 'Tarde, Simmel and the Logic of Fashion'\n\n2.Patrizia Calefato, 'Italian Futurismo and Fashion'\n\n3.Ulrich Lehmann, 'Modernism v.
