        "text": "GRMN 0010 Bad Taste\n\n\"Beauty is not a quality inherent to things: it only exists in the mind of the beholder.\" (David Hume) \" Most of us can recognize bad taste as soon as we see it: Harlequin romances, Elvis on black velvet, lawn ornaments. But bad taste also has a history, and kitsch has been identified as a peculiarly modern invention related to capitalism and consumerism. Beginning with a discussion of taste in the eighteenth century, we will investigate under what conditions good taste can go bad, for example when it is the object of mass reproduction, and, on the other hand, why bad taste in recent times has increasingly been viewed in positive terms. Categories such as the cute, the sentimental, the popular, the miniature, kitsch, and camp will be explored. We will also ask what forms of ideological work have been done by this brand of aesthetics, for example in the connection between politics and kitsch, femininity and the low-brow, or camp and queer identity. Writers and film-makers to be discussed include: Hume, Kant, Goethe, Flaubert, Bourdieu, Sacher-Masoch, Thomas Mann, Nabokov, Benjamin, Greenberg, Sontag, John Waters.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0011 In Praise of the Small in Literature and the Arts\n\nWe can memorize aphorisms and jokes, carry miniature portraits with us, and feel playful in handling small objects. This seminar will ask us to pay attention to smaller texts, art works, and objects that may easily be overlooked. In addition to reading brief texts and looking at images and objects, we will also read texts on the history and theory of short genres and the small.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0011\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0012 Jews and China: Views from Two Perspectives\n\nJews in China??? Who knew??? The history of the Jews in China, both modern and medieval, is an unexpected and fascinating case of cultural exchange. Even earlier than the 10th century. Jewish trader from India or Persia on the Silk Road, settled in Kaifeng, the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty, and established a Jewish community that lasted through the nineteenth century. In the mid-nineteenth century, Jewish merchants, mainly from Iraq, often via India, arrived in China and played a major role in the building of modern Shanghei. After 1898, Jews from Russia settled in the northern Chinese city of Harbin, first as traders and later as refugees from the Bolshevik Revolution and Russian Civil War. In the first decades of the twentieth century, a few Jews from Poland and Russia visited China as tourists, drawn by a combination of curiosity about the cultural exoticism of a truly foreign culture and an affinity that Polish Jewish socialists and communists felt as these political movements began to emerge in China. During World War II, Shanghai served as a port of refuge for Jews from Central Europe. In this freshman seminar, we will explore how these Jewish traders, travelers, and refugees responded to and represented China in their writings. We will also read works by their Chinese contemporaries and others to see the responses to and perceptions of these Jews. We will ask questions about cultural translation: How do exchanges between languages, religions, and cultures affect the identities of individuals and communities? What commonalities and differences between these people emerge?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: JWST 0012\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0013 Euro Zone Crisis - The EU in a Currency War for Suvival?\n\n\"Let me put it simply...there may be a contradiction between the interests of the financial world and the interests of the political world...We cannot keep constantly explaining to our voters and our citizens why the taxpayer should bear the cost of certain risks and not those people who have earned a lot of money from taking those risks.\" Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, at the G20 Summit, November 2010. In January 1999, a single monetary system united Germany, a core nation, with 10 other European states. Amidst the optimism of the euro's first days, most observers forecast that Europe would progress toward an ever closer union. Indeed, in the ensuing decade, the European Union became the world's largest trading area, the euro area expanded to include 17 member states, and the Lisbon Treaty enhanced the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union. In 2009, Greece's debt crisis exposed deep rifts within the European Union and developed into a euro zone crisis - arguably the most difficult test Europe has faced in the past 60 years. After two years of a more benign EURO debt situation, the risk of recession, EU sanctions agains Russia, and a possible collision of a newly-elected Greek government with its creditors, the euro crisis returned with a vengeance in 2015. In addition, the pressure mounts for European leaders to find a solution to the refugee crisis which reached a peak in the fall of 2015. In 2016 the Brexit delivered the latest blow to the European Union, and the future of the European project without the UK looks bleak. The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is still fragile, and economic and political developments in 2017 could determine the future of the euro. Does the EU have what it takes to emerge from these crises? Will the European nations find a collective constructive solution that will lead to a fiscal union that implies further integration?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0015 Hipster Philosophy from Marx to Zizek\n\nFrom Wes Anderson to Williamsburg, hipster culture is everywhere. And yet the very notion of the hipster remains notoriously difficult to define--whether we perceive this cultural phenomenon as the waste product of the postmodern, as a new form of consumerism, as a peculiar attitude toward irony and authenticity, as scenester posturing or as just plain cool. This course addresses such tensions through an examination of the intellectual history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Each week pairs philosophical and theoretical readings with an artifact of hipster culture: reading Instagram beside Walter Benjamin, ironic facial hair with Friedrich Nietzsche, Facebook through the lens of Georg Lukacs and indie music alongside Theodor Adorno. No previous knowledge of skinny jeans required.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0017\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0016 Babylon Berlin: German Crime Books\n\nWhy are crime books and crime shows so popular? 2017 marked a moment in time when a serialized domestic TV show took off in Germany like wild fire. The first three episodes of \"Babylon Berlin\" were seen by an average 7.8 million viewers on ARD last year, achieving a 24.5% share and reaching a peak of 8.5 million. On Sky, it boasted the best ratings ever for a non-English series and was only beaten overall by the seventh season of \"Game of Thrones.\" Babylon Berlin is based on Volker Kutscher's crime books. Thus, this course will trace the success of German crime books as a best-selling genre by analyzing the appeal of the whodunit format and by questioning the transnational appeal of this genre. \"Babylon Berlin\" exemplifies the success of German crime books because the treatment of historical events combined with a critical eye toward the Zeitgeist of cultural products sheds light on the representation of culture and its co-construction of a transnational identity.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0017 Politics of Commemoration\n\nIn this course, we will examine how commemorative traditions in Germany and the United States have been invented and contested since the nineteenth century. We will discuss why certain events in the past rather than others have been the object of commemoration; what these creations stood for originally; how their meanings have changed over the time; and the lessons, if any, these commemorative practices continue to teach us today. We also will examine the ways in which Europeans and Americans have protested, torn down old monuments, erected new ones, and turned to a wide variety of artistic forms to call into question stories about empire, fascism, communism, westward expansion and settler colonialism, enslavement, as well as military victory and loss. We will discuss topics, such as racism, ethnic conflict, Antisemitism, settler colonialism, guilt and victimhood, cultural appropriation, as well as gender and sexuality. To answer these questions, we will focus on literature, essays, art, films, podcasts, and public art and monuments found in Germany, on Penn’s campus, and around Philadelphia.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0018 Climate Change and Community in Indonesia\n\nClimate change isn’t fair. Countries and small island states that have contributed little to cause climate change are already confronting the worst impacts. This trend will continue. While wealthy countries in the Global North scramble to respond to sea level rise, drought, extreme weather, and other impacts with technological and infrastructural solutions, countries in the Global South know they won't be able to protect their vulnerable populations in that way. For them, part of the answer lies in social resilience: the ability of a community or neighborhood in a city or region to withstand and recover from climate shocks and stresses. What are the ingredients that promote social resilience? In this first-year seminar, we will take Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world, as an example. Classified as a newly industrialized developing country, Indonesia has the capacity to mount some large projects such as the decision to move the government from Jakarta to a newly created capital city on the island of Borneo. At the same time, in Jakarta and all along the coasts of the thousands of islands that make up this archipelagic nation, vulnerable communities must foster resilience within themselves. Participants in this seminar will become acquainted with Indonesia’s colonial and recent history, learn about its deep cultural resources, and engage with its current efforts to mitigate emissions and adapt to climate change. Highlights include modules on the plan to protect Jakarta, designing the new capital city, and the use of the arts to increase community resilience in urban and rural kampongs in other parts of the country.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: SAST 0018\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0019 Using Media & the Arts to Survive Climate Change in Small Island States\n\nLow-lying islands are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, especially sea level rise. Even if worst-case scenarios don’t play out, several island nations could be partially or completely uninhabitable by the end of the century. No wonder that small island developing states (SIDS) have played an outsize role in advancing climate policy at the UN climate summits. In this course, students will learn how climate change affects small low-lying islands and how islanders have responded creatively to these threats, through advocacy, policy innovation, media, and the arts. Students will explore alternative futures for islands and their inhabitants such as floating cities and other forms of climate adaptation. Students will become familiar with the most threatened islands systems (Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Maldives, and the Marshall Islands), as well as the Dutch islands of the Caribbean (Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Eustatius, Saba, and Sint Maarten), where the instructor’s research is focused. This includes their cultural history and their iconic interventions in the climate discussion. Throughout the semester, experts at Penn and elsewhere will be consulted.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: FIGS 0019\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0100 Elementary German I\n\nDesigned for the beginning student with no previous knowledge of German. German 0100, as the first course in the first-year series, focuses on the development of language competence in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage in simple conversations about familiar things, know greetings and everyday expressions, they will be able to count and tell time, and negate sentences in day-to-day contexts. Furthermore, students will be able to speak about events that happened in the immediate past and express plans for the future. In addition, students will have developed reading strategies that allow them to glean information from simple newspaper and magazine articles and short literary texts. Because cultural knowledge is one of the foci of German 0100, students will learn much about practical life in Germany and will explore German-speaking cultures on the Internet.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0150 Accelerated Elementary German\n\nThis course is intensive and is intended for dedicated, highly self-motivated students who will take responsibility for their learning and creation of meaning with their peers. An intensive two credit course in which two semesters of elementary German (GRMN 101 & 102) are completed in one. Introduction to the basic elements of spoken and written German, with emphasis placed on the acquisition of communication skills. Readings and discussions focus on cultural differences. Expression and comprehension are then expanded through the study of literature and social themes.\n\nFall\n\n2 Course Units\n\nGRMN 0200 Elementary German II\n\nThis course is a continuation of GRMN 0100 and is designed to strengthen and expand students' listening, speaking, reading, and writing competence and to deepen an understanding of German-speaking cultures. By the end of the course, students will be able to handle a variety of day-to-day needs in a German-speaking setting and engage in simple conversations about personally significant topics. Students can expect to be able to order food and beverages, purchase things, and to be familiar with the German university system, the arts, and current social topics. Students will begin to be able to talk about the past and the future, make comparisons, describe people and things in increasing detail, make travel plans that include other European countries, and make reservations in hotels and youth hostels. By the end of the course students will be able to talk about their studies and about their dreams for the future. In In addition, students will develop reading strategies that should allow them to understand the general meaning of articles, and short literary texts. Furthermore, students will feel more able to understand information when hearing German speakers talking about familiar topics. Cultural knowledge remains among one of the foci of German 0200, and students will continue to be exposed to authentic materials.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nMutually Exclusive: GRMN 5020\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 0100\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0300 Intermediate German I\n\nThis course is designed to improve students writing and speaking competence, to increase vocabulary, to deepen grammar usage, and to help develop effective reading and listening strategies in German across literary genres and media as students interpret and analyze cultural, political, and historical moments in German-speaking countries and compare them with their own cultural practices. This course is organized around content-based modules and prepares students well for GRMN 0400 and a minor or major in German.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 0200\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 0350 Accelerated Intermediate German\n\nThis course is intensive and is intended for dedicated, highly self-motivated students who will take responsibility for their learning and creation of meaning with their peers. This accelerated course is designed to improve students writing and speaking competencies, to increase vocabulary, to deepen grammar usage, and to help develop effective reading and listening strategies in German across literary genres and media as students interpret and analyze cultural, political, and historical moments in German-speaking countries and compare them with their own cultural practices. This course is organized around content-based modules. Students conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an authentic literary text; offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries.\n\nSpring\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 0200 OR GRMN 0150\n\n2 Course Units\n\nGRMN 0400 Intermediate German II\n\nA continuation of GRMN 0300. Expands students writing and speaking competence in German, increases vocabulary and helps students practice effective reading and listening strategies. Our in-class discussions are based on weekly readings of literary and non-literary texts to facilitate exchange of information, ideas, reactions, and opinions. In addition, the readings provide cultural and historical background information. The review of grammar will not be the primary focus of the course. Students will, however, expand and deepen their knowledge of grammar through specific grammar exercises. Students will conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an authentic literary text; offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 0300\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1010 Freud: The Invention of Psychoanalysis\n\nNo other person of the twentieth century has probably influenced scientific thought, humanistic scholarship, medical therapy, and popular culture as much as Sigmund Freud. This course will study his work, its cultural background, and its impact on us today. In the first part of the course, we will learn about Freud's life and the Viennese culture of his time. We will then move to a discussion of seminal texts, such as excerpts from his Interpretation of Dreams, case studies, as well as essays on psychoanalytic practice, human development, definitions of gender and sex, neuroses, and culture in general. In the final part of the course, we will discuss the impact of Freud's work. Guest lectureres from the medical field, history of science, psychology, and the humnities will offer insights into the reception of Freud's work, and its consequences for various fields of study and therapy.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1010, GSWS 1010, HIST 0820\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1015 Freud's Objects\n\nHow do we look at objects? And which stories can objects tell? These are questions that have been asked quite regularly by Art Historians or Museum Curators, but they take a central place within the context of psychoanalytic studies as well. The seminar \"Freud's Objects\" will offer an introduction to Sigmund Freud's life and times, as well as to psychoanalytic studies. We will focus on objects owned by Freud that he imbued with special significance, and on Freud's writings that focus on specific objects. Finally, we will deal with a re-interpretation of the \"object\" in psychoanalytic theory, via a discussion of texts by British psychoanalysts such as Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3560, CLST 3509, COML 2052, ENGL 1425\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1020 Marx, Marxism, and the Culture of Revolution\n\nCapitalist society is the object of Karl Marx's analysis and critique—a society that is the product of history and may one day vanish. This course will trace Marx’s critique by moving between the fields of philosophy, economics, and politics. We will locate key interventions of Marx’s thought that transform modern conceptions of history, the relation between economics and politics, and the limits of struggle and emancipation in capitalist society. We will consider the historical conditions of Marx's writing and the development of his thought to discover many sides of Marx and many divergent Marxisms (humanist, post-structuralist, feminist, and others) that follow, often at odds with each other. Further, we will ask about what kind of horizons Marx's and Marxist interventions open up for critique and analysis of capitalist society with respect to gender, race, class, and nation. \"Theory becomes a material force when it has seized the masses,\" argues the young Marx; indeed, his theories have fueled emancipatory movements and propped up tyrannical regimes, substantiated scientific theories and transformed philosophical debates. In examining Marx's legacy, we will focus on the elaborations and historical limitations of his ideas by examining the challenges of fascism, the communist experiment in the Soviet Union and its collapse, as well as the climate and other crises currently taking place. In conclusion, we will turn to the question of whether and to what extent Marx's ideas remain relevant today, and whether it is possible to be a Marxist in the contemporary world dominated by global capital.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1020, PHIL 1439, REES 1172\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1030 Nietzsche's Modernity and the Death of God\n\n\"God is dead.\" This famous, all too famous death sentence, issued by the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, also signaled the genesis of a radical challenge to traditional notions of morality, cultural life, and the structure of society as a whole. In this course we will examine both the \"modernity\" of Nietzsche's thought and the ways in which his ideas have helped to define the very concept of Modernity (and, arguably, Postmodernity) itself. In exploring the origin and evolution of Nietzsche's key concepts, we will trace the ways in which his work has been variously revered or refuted, championed or co-opted, for more than a century. We will survey his broad influence on everything from philosophy and literature to music and art, theater and psychology, history and cultural theory, politics and popular culture. Further, we will ask how his ideas continue to challenge us today, though perhaps in unexpected ways. As we will see, Nietzsche wanted to teach us \"how to philosophize with a hammer.\"\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1030\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1040 Berlin: History, Politics, Culture\n\nWhat do you know about Berlin's history, architecture, culture, and political life? The present course will offer a survey of the history of Prussia, beginning with the seventeenth century, and the unification of the small towns of Berlin and Koelln to establish a new capital for this country. It will tell the story of Berlin's rising political prominence in the eighteenth century, and its position as a center of the German and Jewish Enlightenment. It will follow Berlin's transformation into an industrial city in the nineteenth century, its rise to metropolis in the early twentieth century, its history during the Third Reich, and the post-war cold war period. The course will conclude its historical survey with a consideration of Berlin's position as a capital in reunified Germany. The historical survey will be supplemented by a study of Berlin's urban structure, its significant architecture from the eighteenth century (i.e. Schinkel) to the nineteenth (new worker's housing, garden suburbs) and twentieth centuries (Bauhaus, Speer designs, postwar rebuilding, GDR housing projects, post-unification building boom). In addition, we will read literary texts about the city, and consider the visual art and music created in and about Berlin, and focus on Berlin's Jewish history. The course will be interdisciplinary with the fields of German Studies, history, history of art, urban studies, and German-Jewish studies. It is also designed as a preparation for undergraduate students who are considering spending a junior semester with the Penn Abroad Program in Berlin.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2370, COML 1040, HIST 0821, URBS 1070\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1050 Metropolis: Culture of the City\n\nAn exploration of modern discourses on and of the city. Topics include: the city as site of avant-garde experimentation; technology and culture; the city as embodiment of social order and disorder; traffic and speed; ways of seeing the city; the crowd; city figures such as the detective, the criminal, the flaneur, the dandy; film as the new medium of the city. Special emphasis on Berlin. Readings by, among others, Dickens, Poe, Baudelaire, Rilke, Doeblin, Marx, Engels, Benjamin, Kracauer. Films include Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1050, URBS 1050\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1060 The Fantastic and Uncanny in Literature: Ghosts, Spirits & Machines\n\nDo we still believe in spirits and ghosts? Do they have any place in an age of science of technology? Can they perhaps help us to define what a human being is and what it can do? We will venture on a journey through literary texts from the late eighteenth century to the present to explore the uncanny and fantastic in literature and life. Our discussions will be based on a reading of Sigmund Freud's essay on the uncanny, and extraordinary Romantic narratives by Ludwig Tieck, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Prosper Mérimée, Villiers de Isle-Adam, and others.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1060, GSWS 1060\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1065 Fashion and Modernity\n\nIn this class we will study the emergence of the Modernist concept of the \"new\" as a term also understood as \"new fashion.\" We will move back and forth in time so as to analyze today’s changing scene with a view to identify contemporary accounts of the \"new\" in the context of the fashion industry. Our texts will include poetry, novels, and films. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2889, COML 1072, ENGL 1071, FREN 1071\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1070 Fascist Cinemas\n\nCinema played a crucial role in the cultural life of Nazi Germany and other fascist states. As cinema enthusiasts, Goebbels and Hitler were among the first to realize the important ideological potential of film as a mass medium and saw to it that Germany remained a cinema powerhouse producing more than 1000 films during the Nazi era. In Italy, Mussolini, too, declared cinema \"the strongest weapon.\" This course explores the world of \"fascist\" cinemas ranging from infamous propaganda pieces such as The Triumph of the Will to popular entertainments such as musicals and melodramas. It examines the strange and mutually defining kinship between fascism more broadly and film. We will consider what elements mobilize and connect the film industries of the Axis Powers: style, genre, the aestheticization of politics, the creation of racialized others. More than seventy years later, fascist cinemas challenge us to grapple with issues of more subtle ideological insinuation than we might think. Weekly screenings with subtitles.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1070, COML 1071, ITAL 1930\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1080 German Cinema\n\nAn introduction to the momentous history of German film, from its beginnings before World War One to developments following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification in 1990. With an eye to film's place in its historical and political context, the course will explore the \"Golden Age\" of German cinema in the Weimar Republic, when Berlin vied with Hollywood; the complex relationship between Nazi ideology and entertainment during the Third Reich; the fate of German film-makers in exile during the Hitler years; post-war film production in both West and East Germany; the call for an alternative to \"Papa's Kino\" and the rise of New German Cinema in the 1960s.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1080, COML 1080\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1090 Jewish Films and Literature\n\nFrom the 1922 silent film \"Hungry Hearts\" through the first \"talkie,\" \"The Jazz Singer,\" produced in 1927, and beyond \"Schindler's List,\" Jewish characters have confronted the problems of their Jewishness on the silver screen for a general American audience. Alongside this Hollywood tradition of Jewish film, Yiddish film blossomed from independent producers between 1911 and 1939, and interpreted literary masterpieces, from Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" to Sholom Aleichem's \"Teyve the Dairyman,\" primarily for an immigrant, urban Jewish audience. In this course, we will study a number of films and their literary sources (in fiction and drama), focusing on English language and Yiddish films within the framework of three dilemmas of interpretation: a) the different ways we \"read\" literature and film, b) the various ways that the media of fiction, drama, and film \"translate\" Jewish culture, and c) how these translations of Jewish culture affect and are affected by their implied audience.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1090, ENGL 1289, JWST 1090\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1100 Women in Jewish Literature\n\n\"Jewish woman, who knows your life? In darkness you have come, in darkness do you go.\" J. L. Gordon (1890). This course will bring into the light the long tradition of women as readers, writers, and subjects in Jewish literature. All texts will be in translation from Yiddish and Hebrew, or in English. Through a variety of genres -- devotional literature, memoir, fiction, and poetry -- we will study women's roles and selves, the relations of women and men, and the interaction between Jewish texts and women's lives. The legacy of women in Yiddish devotional literature will serve as background for our reading of modern Jewish fiction and poetry from the past century. The course is divided into five segments. The first presents a case study of the Matriarchs Rachel and Leah, as they are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible, in rabbinic commentary, in pre-modern prayers, and in modern poems. We then examine a modern novel that recasts the story of Dinah, Leah's daughter. Next we turn to the seventeenth century Glikl of Hamel, the first Jewish woman memoirist. The third segment focuses on devotional literature for and by women. In the fourth segment, we read modern women poets in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English. The course concludes with a fifth segment on fiction written by women in Yiddish, Hebrew, and English.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 1100, JWST 1100, MELC 0375, NELC 0375\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1110 Jewish American Literature\n\nWhat makes Jewish American literature Jewish? What makes it American? This course will address these questions about ethnic literature through fiction, poetry, drama, and other writings by Jews in America, from their arrival in 1654 to the present. We will discuss how Jewish identity and ethnicity shape literature and will consider how form and language develop as Jewish writers \"immigrate\" from Yiddish, Hebrew, and other languages to American English. Our readings, from Jewish American Literature: A Norton Anthology, will include a variety of stellar authors, both famous and less-known, including Isaac Mayer Wise, Emma Lazarus, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Celia Dropkin, Abraham Cahan, Anzia Yezierska, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Cynthia Ozick, and Allegra Goodman. Students will come away from this course having explored the ways that Jewish culture intertwines with American culture in literature.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1110, JWST 1110\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1111 Yiddish Literature and Culture\n\nThis course introduces a variety of themes and genres in Yiddish literature and culture, depending on the instructor and programmatic needs. The focus of the course may include Yiddish literature and culture in America; Yiddish literature and culture in Eastern Europe; Yiddish modernism; Art and music in the Yiddish context; Yiddish theater; Yiddish journalism; Yiddish film. Readings will be in English translation, while primary sources in Yiddish will be available, as well. Classes and coursework will be in English. There will be an optional graduate component to this course.\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1111, JWST 1111, YDSH 1111\n\nMutually Exclusive: YDSH 5111\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1120 Translating Cultures: Literature on and in Translation\n\n\"Languages are not strangers to one another,\" writes the great critic and translator Walter Benjamin. Yet two people who speak different languages have a difficult time talking to one another, unless they both know a third, common language or can find someone who knows both their languages to translate what they want to say. Without translation, most of us would not be able to read the Bible or Homer, the foundations of Western culture. Americans wouldn't know much about the cultures of Europe, China, Africa, South America, and the Middle East. And people who live in or come from these places would not know much about American culture. Without translation, Americans would not know much about the diversity of cultures within America. The very fabric of our world depend upon translation between people, between cultures, between texts. With a diverse group of readings--autobiography, fiction, poetry, anthology, and literary theory--this course will address some fundamental questions about translating language and culture. What does it mean to translate? How do we read a text in translation? What does it mean to live between two languages? Who is a translator? What are different kinds of literary and cultural translation? what are their principles and theories? Their assumptions and practices? Their effects on and implications for the individual and the society?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1120, JWST 1120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1130 Water Worlds: Cultural Responses to Sea Level Rise & Catastrophic Flooding\n\nAs a result of climate change, the world that will take shape in the course of this century will be decidedly more inundated with water than we're accustomed to. The polar ice caps are melting, glaciers are retreating, ocean levels are rising, polar bear habitat is disappearing, countries are jockeying for control over a new Arctic passage, while low-lying cities and small island nations are confronting the possibility of their own demise. Catastrophic flooding events are increasing in frequency, as are extreme droughts. Hurricane-related storm surges,tsunamis, and raging rivers have devastated regions on a local and global scale. In this seminar we will turn to the narratives and images that the human imagination has produced in response to the experience of overwhelming watery invasion, from Noah to New Orleans. Objects of analysis will include mythology, ancient and early modern diluvialism, literature, art, film, and commemorative practice. The basic question we'll be asking is: What can we learn from the humanities that will be helpful for confronting the problems and challenges caused by climate change and sea level rise?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1130, COML 1130, ENVS 1040\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1132 Forest Worlds: Mapping the Arboreal Imaginary in Literature and Film\n\nThe destruction of the world's forests through wild fires, deforestation, and global heating threatens planetary bio-diversity and may even, as a 2020 shows, trigger civilizational collapse. Can the humanities help us think differently about the forest? At the same time that forests of the world are in crisis, the \"rights of nature\" movement is making progress in forcing courts to acknowledge the legal \"personhood\" of forests and other ecosystems. The stories that humans have told and continue to tell about forests are a source for the imaginative and cultural content of that claim. At a time when humans seem unable to curb the destructive practices that place themselves, biodiversity, and forests at risk, the humanities give us access to a record of the complex inter-relationship between forests and humanity. Forest Worlds serves as an introduction to the environmental humanities. The environmental humanities offer a perspective on the climate emergency and the human dimension of climate change that are typically not part of the study of climate science or climate policy. Students receive instruction in the methods of the humanities - cultural analysis and interpretation of literature and film - in relation to texts that illuminate patterns of human behavior, thought, and affect with regard to living in and with nature.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1520, COML 1054, ENVS 1550\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1140 Liquid Histories and Floating Archives\n\nClimate change transforms the natural and built environments, and it is re-shaping how we understand, make sense, and care for our past. Climate changes history. This course explores the Anthropocene, the age when humans are remaking earth's systems, from an on-water perspective. In on-line dialogue and video conferences with research teams in port cities on four continents, this undergraduate course focuses on Philadelphia as one case study of how rising waters are transfiguring urban history, as well as its present and future. Students projects take them into the archives at the Independence Seaport Museum and at Bartram's Garden. Field trips by boat on the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers and on land to the Port of Philadelphia and to the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge invite transhistorical dialogues about how colonial and then industrial-era energy and port infrastructure transformed the region's vast tidal marshlands wetlands. Excursions also help document how extreme rain events, storms, and rising waters are re-making the built environment, redrawing lines that had demarcated land from water. In dialogue with one another and invited guest artists, writers, and landscape architects, students final projects consider how our waters might themselves be read and investigated as archives. What do rising seas subsume and hold? Whose stories do they tell? What floats to the surface?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 1440, COML 1140, ENGL 1589, ENVS 1440, HIST 0872\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1146 Queer German Cinema\n\nTaught in English. This course offers an introduction into the history of German-language cinema with an emphasis on depictions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer themes. The course provides a chronological survey of Queer German Cinema from its beginnings in the Weimar Republic to its most recent and current representatives, accompanied throughout by a discussion of the cultural-political history of gay rights in the German-speaking world. Over the course of the semester, students will learn not only cinematic history but how to write about and close-read film. No knowledge of German or previous knowledge required.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: CIMS 1146, GSWS 1146\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1150 Comparative Cultures of Sustainability\n\nSustainability is more than science, engineering, policy, and design. Surveying the world, we see that the politics and practice of sustainability play out in different ways depending on cultural factors. Some cultures are more prone to pursue ecological goals than others. Why? Do the environmental history and experience of a nation affect policy? Do nature and the environment play a crucial role in the cultural memory of a nation? Can cultural components be effectively leveraged in order to win approval for a politics of sustainability? And what can we, as residents of a country where climate change and global warming are flashpoints in an enduring culture war, learn from other cultures? This course is designed to equip undergraduate students with the historical and cultural tools necessary to understand the cultural aspects of sustainability in two countries noted for their ecological leadership and cultural innovation, Germany and the Netherlands. This hybrid course combines online instruction with a short-term study abroad experience in Berlin and Rotterdam. During the pre-tip online portion of the course, students will become acquainted with the cultural histories of German and Dutch attitudes toward sustainability and the environment through a combination of recorded lectures by the instructor, reading assignments, viewing assignments (documentary and feature films), threaded discussions, and short written assignments. The goal of the pre-trip instruction are to help students develop tools for analyzing and interpreting cultural difference, construct working models of German and Dutch concepts of sustainability, and formulate hypotheses about the relation between culture and policy in Germany and the Netherlands. The class will spend a total of ten days in Europe: five days in Berlin and five days in the area of Rotterdam. The days will be jam-packed with visits to important sites of sustainable practice; discussion with policy makers, activists, and scientists; and immersion in the cultures of the Netherlands and Germany. Upon our return from Europe, the class will debrief and students will present online projects. There are no prerequisites or language requirements.\n\nSummer Term\n\nAlso Offered As: ENVS 1540\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1151 Comparative Cultures of Resilience and Sustainability in the Netherlands and the United States\n\nCoastal and riverside cities worldwide are under increasing pressure from sea level rise and other effects of climate change. Resilience and sustainability are paradigmatic concepts for the ways in which cities address the effects associated with global warming: sea level rise, extreme weather, changing climate, and their impacts on water, food, energy, and housing. This course focuses on the cultural side of resilience and sustainability in four signature cities: Rotterdam (with areas 6 meters below sea level), Nijmegen (which has devised a new way to live with a major river), New York City (which was devastated by Hurricane Sandy), and New Orleans (one of the most vulnerable American cities). Of course, other cities (Amsterdam, Arnhem, Boston, The Hague, Houston, Miami, etc.) will also come into play. In deeply uncertain times, cities such as these confront an array of interconnected choices that involve not only infrastructural solutions, but priorities, values, and cultural predispositions. Ideally, the strategies that cities devise are generated through inclusive processes based on the understanding that resilience and sustainability should be grounded in the cultural life of their communities. When this is the case, resilience and sustainability can become unique and motivating narratives about how cities and their residents co-develop the kinds of hard, soft, and social infrastructure the climate emergency requires. With this in mind, we will analyze the cities’ climate action plans and resilience strategies; explore their cultural histories relative to flooding events; and consult with Dutch and American experts in climate adaptation, governance, community development, and design. The highlight of the course will be travel to the Netherlands during spring break for site visits and discussions with experts.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: URBS 1151\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1153 Is Europe Facing a Spiritual Crisis?\n\nIs Europe Facing a Spiritual Crisis? On Contemporary Debates about Secularization, Religion and Rationality. Point of departure for this course is the difference between Europe and the US as to the role of religion in the unfolding of their respective \"cultural identities\" (cf. Charles Taylor, A Secular Age, 522-530). As a rule, both the US and Western Europe are now defined as secularized cultures, even if their histories and specific identities are strongly rooted in the Christian heritage. Given this contemporary situation, four research questions will be dealt with in this course. 1) What is meant by secularization? In answer to that question, two secularization theories are distinguished: the classic versus the alternative secularization thesis; 2) What is the historical impact of the nominalist turning-point at the end of the Middle Ages in this process towards secularization? 3) How did the relation between rationality and religion develop during modern times in Europe? 4) What is the contemporary outcome of this evolution in so-called postmodern / post-secular Europe and US? We currently find ourselves in this so-called postmodern or post-secular period, marked by a sensitivity to the boundaries of (modern) rationality and to the fragility of our (modern) views on man, world and God. In this respect, we will focus on different parts of Europe (Western and Eastern Europe alike) and will refer to analogies and differences between Western Europe and US. This historical-thematic exposition is illustrated by means of important fragments from Western literature (and marginally from documents in other arts) and philosophy. We use these fragments in order to make more concrete the internal philosophical evolutions in relation to corresponding changes in diverse social domains (religion, politics, economy, society, literature, art...).\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: DTCH 1153\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1160 Sustainability & Utopianism\n\nThis seminar explores how the humanities can contribute to discussions of sustainability. We begin by investigating the contested term itself, paying close attention to critics and activists who deplore the very idea that we should try to sustain our, in their eyes, dystopian present, one marked by environmental catastrophe as well as by an assault on the educational ideals long embodied in the humanities. We then turn to classic humanist texts on utopia, beginning with More's fictive island of 1517. The \"origins of environmentalism\" lie in such depictions of island edens (Richard Grove), and our course proceeds to analyze classic utopian tests from American, English, and German literatures. Readings extend to utopian visions from Europe and America of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as well as literary and visual texts that deal with contemporary nuclear and flood catastrophes. Authors include: Bill McKibben, Jill Kerr Conway, Christopher Newfield, Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Karl Marx, Henry David Thoreau, Robert Owens, William Morris, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ayn Rand, Christa Wolf, and others.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1160, ENGL 1579, ENVS 1050, STSC 1160\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1170 Global Sustainabilities\n\nThis research-oriented seminar focuses on the ways in which \"sustainability\" and \"sustainable development\" are linguistically and culturally translated into the world's languages. We may take the terms for granted, but they have only really been on the global stage since they were widely introduced in the 1987 United Nations report, Our Common Future. Seminar participants will first become acquainted with the cultural and conceptual history of the terms and the UN framework within which sustainability efforts directly or indirectly operate. Having established the significance of cultural and linguistic difference in conceiving and implementing sustainability, participants will collaboratively develop a research methodology in order to begin collecting and analyzing data. We will draw heavily on Penn's diverse language communities and international units. Seminar members will work together and individually to build an increasingly comprehensive website that provides information about the world's languages of sustainability.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1170, ENVS 1450\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1210 Witnessing, Remembering, and Writing the Holocaust\n\nWitnessing, Remembering, and Writing the Holocaust What is a witness? What do the witnesses of the Shoah see, hear, experience? And how will they remember things, whether they are victims, perpetrators or bystanders? How are their memories translated into survivors' accounts: reports, fiction, art, and even music or architecture? And what does this teach us about human survival, and about the transmission of experiences to the next generation? The course will ask these questions by studying literature on memory and trauma, as well as novels, poetry, and non-fiction accounts of the Holocaust. We will also look at art work created by survivors or their children, and listen to video testimonies. Among the authors and artists discussed will be work by Primo Levi, Paul Celan, Jean Amery, Christian Boltanski, Daniel Libeskind. The course is supported by the USC Shoah Foundation Visual History Archives.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2871, COML 1210, JWST 1210\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1235 Autobiographical Writing\n\nHow does one write about oneself? Who is the “author” writing? What does one write about? And is it fiction or truth? Our course on autobiographical writing will pursue these questions, researching confessions, autobiographies, memoirs, and other forms of life-writing both in their historical development and theoretical articulations. Examples will include selections from St. Augustine’s confessiones, Rousseau’s Confessions, Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography, as well as many examples from contemporary English, German, French, and American literature.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1235\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1240 Reckoning: Art and Monuments in Europe and the Americas\n\nIn this course, we will examine how commemorative traditions in Europe and the Americas have been invented and contested since the nineteenth century. We will discuss why certain events in the past rather than others have been the object of commemoration; what these creations stood for originally; how their meanings have changed over the time; and the lessons, if any, these commemorative practices continue to teach us today. We also will examine the ways in which Europeans and Americans have protested, torn down old monuments, erected new ones, and turned to a wide variety of artistic forms to call into question stories about empire, fascism, communism, westward expansion and settler colonialism, enslavement, as well as military victory and loss. To answer these questions, we will focus on the history and theory of public monuments and sculpture, painting, commemorative sites, museum exhibitions, and film. The lecture topics will range from the Napoleonic Wars and Occupation, the American Civil War, German Unifications, National Socialism and Fascism, Holocaust Memorials and Museums, the Disappeared in Argentina, Spanish Civil War and Post-Francoism, Refugees and Migrants in the Mediterranean, as well as works by individual artists who have reflected on these historical events. Taught in English.\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2779\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1300 Topics German Cinema\n\nThis topic course explores aspects of Film History intensively.

The material is organized thematically around four topics: religious art as piety and politics; antiquity as a source of tradition and imagination; the formulation of a public discourse that exposed social threats; and the distinctiveness of artistic claims of individual achievement. A motif throughout the course is the question of how the survival of fragments may be presented in museum contexts as parts standing in for an absent whole. We will also consider how historians approach designs for works of art now lost or never completed. Encouraging encounters with art and artifacts around the city, assignments focus on objects in Philadelphia collections.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2610\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6610\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1302 Writing About Art Seminar\n\nWhat does it mean to write about art? What are the historical origins of this undertaking? How does language mediate the intellectual, somatic, and cultural rapport between the viewing self and the physical object? As an initial response to these questions we will examine the writings of the Tuscan artist and critic Giorgio Vasari (1511-1574), the biographer of such renowned artists as Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo. We will also read the letters of famous artists from the early modern period, and examine the theoretical forays of artists such as Albrecht DÃ?rer, who attempted to sketch the relationship between the memory and the imagination. Finally, we will look to examples of works of art for how we might read visual images as expressive of theories about what are is and what it can do.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3510, ENGL 0549, ITAL 3610\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1303 Introduction to Literary Theory\n\nThis course introduces students to major issues in the history of literary theory, and provides an excellent foundation for the English major or minor. Treating the work of Plato and Aristotle as well as contemporary criticism, we will consider the fundamental issues that arise from representation, making meaning, appropriation and adaptation, categorization and genre, historicity and genealogy, and historicity and temporality. We will consider major movements in the history of theory including the \"New\" Criticism of the 1920's and 30's, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and psychoanalysis, feminism, cultural studies, critical race theory, and queer theory.

Norwegians, Danes and Swedes left their homeland to trade, raid and pillage; leaving survivors praying \"Oh Lord, deliver us from the fury of the Norsemen!\" While commonly associated with violent barbarism, the Norse were also farmers, craftsmen, and merchants. As their dragon ships sailed the waterways of Europe and beyond, they also transformed from raiders to explorers, discoverers and settlers of found and conquered lands. This course will introduce students to various facets of the culture and society of the Viking world ranging from honor culture, gender roles, political culture, mythology, and burial practices. We will also explore the range of Viking activity abroad from Kiev and Constantinople to Greenland and Vineland, the Viking settlement in North America. We will use material and archeological sources as well as literary and historical ones in order to think about how we know history and what questions we can ask from different sorts of sources. Notably, we will be reading Icelandic sagas that relate oral histories of heroes, outlaws, raiders and sailors that will lead us to question the lines between fact and fiction, and myth and history.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: HIST 1210\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1306 Origins of Nazism: From Democracy to Race War and Genocide\n\nWhere did the Nazis come from? Was the Weimar Republic bound to fail? Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of antisemitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of a war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population, cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements, and waged a brutal war of extermination that aimed to racially reorder all of Europe. Thinking about Nazi racism and genocide, their origins and trajectories, in both its particular specifics and in a larger historical context is the main goal of this course.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: HIST 1280\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1500 Texts and Contexts\n\nIn this course, you will explore themes of cultural and historical significance in contemporary German-speaking countries through literature and nonfiction, through film and current event media coverage. Whether you wish to dive deeply into historical or political contexts, explore untranslatable cultural phenomena or the aesthetic rhythm and semantic complexity of the German language, \"Texts and Contexts\" will inspire your imagination and deepen your understanding of German language, culture and literature. Students will develop intercultural competence and understandings that are fundamental to communicative competence, as well as appropriate levels of linguistic and discourse competencies necessary for cross-cultural and interactional communication in all modalities. By the end of the semester, you will be able to: - Gain insight into complexities of concepts of Heimat, Identity, and Belonging in relation to Black and Peoples of Color (BPoC) in the German context. - Develop analytical and critical thinking skills, including the ability to interpret and analyze a wide range of cultural practices, products, and perspectives within their socio-historical contexts. - Gain awareness of cross-cultural differences between your own society & German society, including social and political structure, and an understanding of how these differences inform concepts of Heimat, identity, and belonging. - Develop all four proficiencies (reading, writing, speaking, listening) in German to meet the standards of the advanced-mid level.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 0400\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 1510 Handschrift-Hypertext: Deutsche Medien\n\nThis course will provide an introduction to German-language literary studies through exemplary readings of short forms: fables, fairy tales, aphorisms, stories, novellas, feuilletons, poems, songs, radio plays, film clips, web projects and others.

Where are the borders between German, Austrian and Swiss culture? What is part of the \"cultural canon\"? Who decides and what role does memory play? Relying on the theory of collective memory (Halbwachs) and the concept of \"places of memory\" (Erinnerungsorte; Nora, Francois/Schulze) and with reference to examplary scholarly and literary texts, debates, songs, films, documents, and paintings from high and pop culture, this course will weave a mosaic of that which (also) constitutes German or German-language culture.\n\nFall\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 2100\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3210 Krautrock und die Folgen\n\n„Wir hatten den Drang, etwas ganz anderes zu sagen.“ So erklären Faust ihre experimentelle Musik, die seit Beginn der 70er Jahre als Krautrock bekannt geworden ist. Der Begriff geht zurück auf eine abwertende Bezeichnung britischer Musikjournalisten für deutsche Rockbands, abgeleitet von der in England gängigen Vorstellung der Deutschen als Krauts (von Sauerkraut). Gemeinsam ist diesen Bands ihr innovativer Stil, der aus unterschiedlichsten Quellen schöpft. Bedeutsam sind unter anderem Psychedelic Rock, elektronische Musik, Funk, Minimalismus sowie Free Jazz. Einige Künstler haben einen Hintergrund in zeitgenössischer experimenteller klassischer Musik. So sind Irmin Schmidt und Holger Czukay (Can) Schüler des Komponisten Karlheinz Stockhausen. Diese Einflüsse fanden ihren Ausdruck in der Abkehr von den Mustern der klassischen Songstruktur und Melodie, wie sie bei Rockmusik aus Amerika und Großbritannien vorherrschend sind. Krautrock hat schließlich maßgeblich zur Entwicklung eines neuen mechanischeren und elektronischen Sounds beigetragen, der wiederum für zahlreiche neue Musikstile der 80er und 90er Jahre verantwortlich wurde. Wir wollen im Seminar einen Blick auf diese besondere musikalische Epoche und ihre Geschichte werfen, die kennzeichnend für das geworden ist, was heute als Underground in der Musik angesehen wird. Bekanntlich hat Krautrock auf die weitere Entwicklung der Popmusik in so unterschiedlichen Stilen wie Punkrock, Ambient, Elektro und Seattle Grunge gewirkt. Weniger bekannt sind hingegen die enge Einbindung der Musik ins weitere künstlerische und auch politische Umfeld dieser Jahre. So ist die Zusammenarbeit Amon Düüls mit Wim Wenders oder Rainer Werner Fassbinder legendär, ebenso berüchtigt aber auch ihre Verbindung zur Baader-Meinhof Gruppe. Im Fokus des Seminars stehen vor allem die Anfänge und frühen Jahre der bekanntesten Bands. Die spätere Entwicklungen soll jedoch ebenfalls Beachtung finden. Ziel ist es, einen umfassenderen Blick auf die deutsche Subkultur der zweiten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts zu gewinnen. Den Abschluss des Seminars wird eine gemeinsam organisierte künstlerische Arbeit bilden (das genaue Format wird zu klären sein: Ausstellung, Kolloquium, Konzert, etc.).\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3212 Seeing Green: Environmentalism in Germany and Austria\n\nMany regard Germany as a leader in the transition to renewable energy. The Green Party has been a significant player in federal and local politics since 1981. The current Austrian chancellor is a member of the Green Party. Soon, Germany will shutter its last nuclear reactor. Work on the coal phase-out has already begun. Germans overwhelmingly support aggressive climate action by their government. How can we explain this? In this course, we will become familiar with current climate, environmental, and energy policy and practice in Germany and Austria, but we will also delve into the cultural history of German environmentalism. We'll learn about the origin of the German concept of sustainability in early 18th-century forestry; the role of the forest in Romanticism; the origin of the concepts of ecology and environment in the work of Ernst Haeckel and Jacob von Uexkull; the role of the mountains in Austrian environmental thinking; Nazi-era environmentalism; \"Waldsterben,\" the anti-nuke movement and the rise of the Green Party; the \"Energiewende\"; and the impact of the uprising to protect the Hambacher Forest on the coal phase-out. We'll make use of readings from policy, history, and literature, and screen feature and documentary films.

Public book burnings were the most visible sign of a complete reorganization of the literary world. What was it like to be a writer in the Third Reich? How did censorship work? What kind of choices were writers forced to make? What political roles did writers adopt? Under what conditions could they publish? Who read their books and how did they read them? These are some of the questions we will ask as we become acquainted with German writers in ideological adherence or alliance, in exile throughout Europe and the Americas, in \"inner emigration,\" even in concentration camps, and in hiding. By focusing on their writing, we will shed light on the value of literature in dark times.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3221 German Ideas and Nazi Ideology\n\nRight-wing movements are often considered to be a reservoir of those who are left behind and economic losers. This seems to apply as much today as it did to the fascist movements of the first half of the 20th century. Admittedly, the economic situation has had a considerable influence on the development and success of these movements and most intellectuals have obviously reacted with open rejection to the aggressive and racist policies, which has led to mass emigration, especially to the United States. It must be noted, however, that the movement itself was supported by a prominent conservative worldview from which it emerged and through which it is best understood. The notion of the \"Downfall of the West\" (Oswald Spengler) or the prevailing view among the intellectual elite that \"Germany's soul is the place where Europe's spiritual oppositions are carried out\" (Thomas Mann) and the resulting disdain for political business, are all expressions of the idea of a special historical responsibility of the Germans. Even though this intellectual elite was opposed to the National Socialist movement, it must be said that the most renowned thinkers not only arranged themselves with the regime, but even supported it at times. Three particularly important examples are Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt and Gottfried Benn. Today they are counted among the intellectual giants of the 20th century and their works are studied worldwide, including the University of Pennsylvania. In this seminar, the spirit of National Socialism will be explored. To this end, we will look at the intellectual background in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century, but especially at the period between the two wars, before we will then intensively deal with the National Socialist involvement of the three thinkers Heidegger, Schmitt, and Benn.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3240 Crime and Detection\n\nThe detective story and the crime drama are time-honored genres of literature and popular culture. In this course, you will question the popularity of the crime novel, and the genre conventions that engage readers. What does this genre say about the Zeitgeist of cultural products, their representation of a culture, and their co-construction of a global/local identity? The process of detection, of deciphering clues, is much like the process of reading and interpretation. In this course we will read a variety of detective and crime stories, some by famous authors (e.g., Droste-Hülshoff, Brecht, Benjamin, Freud), others by contemporary authors that address interesting aspects of German culture (e.g., Turkish-Germans, gay and lesbian subcultures, DDR and Wende). We will also look at episodes from popular West, East, and post-reunification German TV crime shows (e.g., Tatort).Your research will revolve around five theoretical thematic circles through whose lens we view, analyze, and address the various texts. Be it social or sociocritical, geographical, historical, or narratological, the fascination of the crime novel will captivate you as well. Furthermore, we will deal with the historical interpretations of the genre concept of crime literature by reading critical literary criticism on the basis of Wolfgang Iser's reader theory.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3250 Theater and Language: Staging the 20th Century\n\nGermany's relationship to theater has been intimate since its beginnings, and the events shown on its stages have close ties to the country's social, political, and economic conditions. In this course, students will improve their language skills and cultural knowledge by reading Germany’s social and political history through the lens of some of its most fascinating theatrical moments: death scenes. Whether gruesome, suspenseful, uneventful, or unexpected, death fascinates an audience like almost nothing else, and the greatest German-language playwrights of the twentieth century—including Brecht, Wedekind, and Dürrenmatt—knew this well. Their works feature everything from friendly executions to grisly serial killings, which students will both read and watch against a background of German cultural history. Taught in German.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3260 Topics in German Literature\n\nTopics vary annually. The course description for Spring 2015 is as follows: Typically \"the Other\" stands for a person or a group of people from another cultural background. But there have always been other encounters that forced people to distiguish themselves from an \"other\". Foremost, in order to define what is \"human\", the \"unhuman\" needed to be described. Initially, this meant distinguishing the human from the rest of nature. With the industrial revolution, the technological became a concern--machines as monsters. On a figurative level, we have the supernatural, ghosts, aliens, and cyborgs. In this course we will explore the ways in which real and imagined encounters with these \"other Others\" are depicted in German language literature and culture.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3265 Kafka's Creatures\n\nFranz Kafka's writings are replete with bestial beings, talking animals, hybrid creatures and other non-human or quasi-human entities. Examining the monstrous or grotesque bodies his work offers up for display, this course, taught in German, will interrogate how Kafka's short stories and novellas construct and call into question the very category of the anthropological. Examining the tradition out of which this creaturely writing grows (reading Kafka's animal fables beside Aesop's, for instance) and its legacy in literature, art and cinema (comparing, for example, Kafka's Metamorphosis with David Cronenberg's The Fly), we will also attend to how these incongruous critters and bodies-in-becoming reflect on Kafka's minoritarian experience as a German-speaking Jew in Habsburg-Era Prague and are in turn reflected in uncanny and ever-evolving aesthetic forms.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3270 German Literature after 1945\n\nFocus on the continuity of the literary tradition, innovation, and prominent themes related to coming-of-age in today's society, and specific stylistic experiments. Topics include: the changing literary perspective on German history and World War II; the representation of such prominent issues as individual reponsibility, German reunification, and human relations in modern society.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3273 Critical Theory of Christa Wolf: What remains?\n\nUnderstood as one of the most prominent writers of the GDR, Christa Wolf's literary contributions shape cultural production of former East Germany and beyond. Nevertheless, her critical engagement with the writing process and the role that memory plays for identity formation and a collective historical process remain less known. This course will shed light on Wolf's iconographic text Die Dimension des Autors, in which she develops the notion of fossilization--medallions of memory--to unpack cultural and historical productions. Indeed, the course traces her most influential texts such as Storfall, Kassandra, Kindheitsmuster and Was bleibt? within her theoretical framework, thereby offering students an opportunity to connect East German literary production with critical theory. The course seeks to illuminate the intrinsic connections between cultural products, practices and perspectives. The course will be taught in German and could fulfill Cross-Cultural Analysis.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3275 Poetry and Songs: A German Language Legacy\n\nWhat does the 2011 founded German rock band AnnenMayKantereit have in common with the idiosyncratic 19th-Century poet and novelist Rainer Maria Rilke? Beginning with this question, the course traces the long tradition of German language poetry and song from the epic medieval Nibelungenlied to the lyrics of 21-century German pop songs. Situated firmly in the context of literary analysis and literary history this course introduces students to recognizing and analyzing genre conventions of German lyrical legacies. Spanning examples from German Romanticism, Expressionism, Dada, Exile, GDR, and contemporary German poetry and song the course familiarizes students with the legacy of German language poetry and song lyrics including examples from Switzerland and Austria. Course taught in German.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3280 Decadence\n\nThe period of the late nineteenth and turn to the twentieth century has often been described as a time of decadence--a decline in the \"standards\" of morals and virtue. While Freud explored the nature of sexual desire, writers like Schnitzler or Wedekind made this exploration central for their stories or plays. The course will focus on the literature and culture of fin-de-siecle Vienna and Berlin, and consider a variety of texts as well as their later reception and translation into film. Lectures and discussion in German.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 3290 Topics in German Culture\n\nTopics vary; see departmental website for details.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 4100 Trans(l)its\n\nDrawing on Goethe's musings on \"world literature\", the course focuses on authors who have arrived at their German words via global, worldly itineraries. The course considers movements between languages, including those of the students themselves and encourages students to develop their own voice as authors via a series of critical and creative writing exercise. At the same time, students develop strategies to reflect on their own language learning. This course provides an important space for German-learners at Penn to draw on one another's experiences in the program and to build a sense of community. The course is required for all German majors in the Fall semester of their senior year.\n\nFall\n\nPrerequisite: GRMN 3110 OR GRMN 3120\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 4201 Independent Study-Senior\n\nIndependent Study-Senior.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5010 Elementary German I\n\nDesigned for the beginning student with no previous knowledge of German. German 101, as the first course in the first-year series, focuses on the development of language competence in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. By the end of the semester, students will be able to engage in simple conversations about familiar things, know greetings and everyday expressions, they will be ble to count and tell time, and negate sentences in day-to-day contexts. Furthermore, students will be able to speak about events that happened in the immediate past and express plans for the future. In addition, students will have developed reading strategies that allow them to glean information from simple newspaper and magazine articles and short literary texts. Because cultural knowledge is one of the foci of German 101, students will learn much about practical life in Germany and will explore German-speaking cultures on the Internet.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5020 Elementary German II\n\nThis course is a continuation of GRMN 101 and is designed to strengthen and expand students' listening, speaking, reading, and writing competence and to deepen an understanding of German-speaking cultures. By the end of the course, students will be able to handle a variety of day-to-day needs in a German-speaking setting and engage in simple conversations about personally significant topics. Students can expect to be able to order food and beverages, purchase things, and to be familiar with the German university system, the arts, and current social topics. Students will begin to be able to talk aboutthe past and the future, make comparisons, describe people and things in increasing detail, make travel plans that include other European countries, and make reservations in hotels and youth hostels. By the end of the course students will be able to talk about their studies and about their dreams for the future. In In addition, students will develop reading strategies that should allow them tounderstand the general meaning of articles, and short literary texts. Furthermore, students will feel more able to understand information when hearing German speakers talking about familiar topics. Cultural knowledge remains among one of the foci of German 102, and students will continue to be exposed to authentic materials.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nMutually Exclusive: GRMN 0200\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5040 Intermediate German II\n\nA continuation of GRMN 103. Expands students writing and speaking competence in German, increases vocabulary and helps students practice effective reading and listening strategies. Our in-class discussions are based on weekly readings of literary and non-literary texts to facilitate exchange of information, ideas, reactions, and opinions. In addition, the readings provide cultural and historical background information. The review of grammar will not be the primary focus of the course. Students will, however, expand and deepen their knowledge of grammar through specific grammar exercises. Students will conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an authentic literary text; offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5070 Elementary Middle High German\n\nDesigned to familiarize the student with the principal elements of Middle High German grammar and to develop skills in reading and translating a major work of the twelfth century. Limited text interpretation.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5090 Topics in Yiddish Literature: Modernist Jewish Poetry\n\nOne version of this seminar considers works by Jewish women who wrote in Yiddish, Hebrew, English, and other languages in the late 19th through the 20th century. The texts, poetry and prose, will include both belles lettres and popular writings, such as journalism, as well as private works (letters and diaries) and devotional works. The course will attempt to define \"Jewish writing, \" in terms of language and gender, and will consider each writer in the context of the aesthetic, religious, and national ideologies that prevailed in this period. Because students will come with proficiency in various languages, all primary texts and critical and theoretical materials will be taught in English translation. However, those students who can, will work on the original texts and share with the class their expertise to foster a comparative perspective. Because we will be discussing translated works, a secondary focus of the course will, in fact, be on literary translation's process and products. Another version of this seminar presents Jewish modernism as an international phenomenon of the early 20th century. The course will attempt to define \"Jewish modernism\" through the prism of poetry, which inevitably, given the historical events in Europe and America during this time, grapples with aesthetic, religious, and national ideologies and methods. The syllabus will focus mainly on poetry written in Yiddish and English, and will also include German, Russian, and Hebrew verse. All poetry, critical, and theoretical materials will be taught in English translation, although students who know the languages will work on the original texts and will bring to the table a comparative perspective. Because we will be discussing translated poems, a secondary focus of the course will, in fact, be on literary translation's process and products.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5090, GSWS 5090, JWST 5090, YDSH 5090\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5100 Kant I\n\nThe course will concentrate on the Critique of Pure Reason and discuss in detail Kant's conception of knowledge and experience, his criticism of traditional metaphysics and the resulting project of a system of transcendental philosophy.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5110 Stylistics\n\nTextual analysis based on communication theory.

Thinking Nature with Schelling and Goethe.\n\nAlthough the starting point for the Anthropocne is still under discussion, there is broad agreement that the industrial revolution and the turn to fossil fuels mark an intensification of humanity's impact on the Earth. It may not be a coincidence that Kant's proclamation of the Copernican revolution in philosophy, according to which human reason replaces the natural light of traditional metaphysics, falls roughly in the same period. Human finite cognition became the measure for God and his creation. The dawn of the era of human freedom and the ramped up exploitation of resources coincide. It is against this background that the Naturphilosophie of F. W. J. Schelling can become particularly interesting. The genesis of German idealism is closely related with the opposition between freedom and necessity that lies at the heart of Kant's critical project. Kant associated the former with man and the latter with nature. In trying to bridge the gap between them, Schelling reinstates nature as an autonomous actor in its own right. Schelling's thinking about nature chimed with the literary and empirical-scientific work of his contemporary Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In the productive interplay of poetry, science, religion, and philosophical thought, Goethe and Schelling offer a critical alternative to philosophy in the aftermath of the Copernican revolution that may be viable or useful today as humanity tries to come to terms with anthropogenically induced climate change. This co-taught interdisciplinary seminar will focus on works by Schelling (Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature, First Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature, On the World Soul) and Goethe (scientific writings, Faust I & II), in addition to engaging recent scholarship of Schelling and Goethe in relation to environmental humanities.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5250\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5260 The Trouble with Freud: Psychoanalysis, Literature, Culture\n\nFor professionals in the field of mental care, Freud's work is often regarded as outmoded, if not problematic psychologists view his work as non-scientific, dependent on theses that cannot be confirmed by experiments. In the realm of literary and cultural theory, however, Freud's work seems to have relevance still, and is cited often. How do we understand the gap between a medical/scientific reading of Freud's work, and a humanist one? Where do we locate Freud's relevance today? The graduate course will concentrate on Freud's descriptions of psychoanalytic theory and practice, as well as his writings on literature and culture.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5260, GSWS 5260\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5350 The Elemental Turn\n\nThe unfolding effects of climate change--rising sea level, melting ice sheets, subsiding land masses, drought stricken regions, wild fires, air laden with greenhouse gases, and inundated cities--heighen our awareness of the elements: air, earth, fire and water. Within the context of the new materialism, philosophers, eco-critics, and writers are re-turning to the elements and encountering, at the same time, predecessor texts that assume new relevance. This seminar will place current thinking and writing about the elements into dialogue with older traditions ranging from the classical (Empedocles, Plato, Lucretius) to writers and thinkers of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries (e.g., Goethe, Novalis, Tieck, Stifter, Bachelard, Heidegger, Boehme).\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5350\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5370 Translating Literature: Theory and Practice\n\nThe greats all have something to say about translation. The Hebrew poet H. N. Bialik is attributed with saying that “he who reads the Bible in translation is like a man who kisses his bride through a veil.” That, however, is a mistranslation: What Bialik really wrote was, “Whoever knows Judaism through translation is like a person who kisses his mother through a handkerchief.\" (http://benyehuda.org/bialik/dvarim02.html), a saying that he probably translated and adapted from Russian or German. (https://networks.h-net.org/node/28655/discussions/116448/query-bialik-kissing-bride) Robert Frost wrote, “I could define poetry this way: it is that which is lost out of both prose and verse in translation.” Walter Benjamin defines it: “Translation is a form. To comprehend it as a form, one must go back to the original, for the laws governing the translation lie within the original, contained in the issue of its translatability.” Lawrence Venuti rails against translation that domesticates, rather than foreignizes, thus betraying the foreign text through a contrived familiarity that makes the translator invisible. Emily Wilson wants her translation “to bring out the way I think the original text handles it. [The original text] allows you to see the perspective of the people who are being killed.” https://bookriot.com/2017/12/04/emily-wilson-translation-the-odyssey/ Is translation erotic? A form of filial love? Incestuous? A mode of communion, or idol worship? Is translation a magician’s vanishing trick? Is translation traitorous, transcendent? Maybe translation is impossible. But let’s try it anyways! In this graduate seminar, we will read key texts on the history and theory of translating literature, and we sample translations from across the centuries of the “classics,” such as the Bible and Homer. We will consider competing translations into English of significant modern literary works from a variety of languages, possibly including, but not limited to German, Yiddish, French, Hebrew, and Russian. These readings will serve to frame each student’s own semester-long translation of a literary work from a language of her or his choice. The seminar offers graduate students with their skills in various language an opportunity to take on a significant translation project within a circle of peers.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5370, JWST 5370\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5400 Franz Kafka and J. M. Coetzee\n\nThis seminar will listen attentively to the echoes of Franz Kafka in the novels of J.M. Coetzee. Building on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's concept of a minor literature, elaborated on the example of Kafka's oeuvre, we will situate Kafka against the backdrop of the German-speaking Jewish community of Habsburg-era Prague and read Coetzee within the context of apartheid and his native South Africa. Beyond an investigation of empire and its aftermath, this course will consider the arguably posthuman ethics of these authors, examining them through the lens of animal studies and the environmental humanities in order to reveal how they anticipate and participate in current thinking on the Anthropocene. Reading Kafka's fables beside Coetzee's allegorical narratives, the seminar will follow the twisted course taken by literary justice from the Josef K. of Kafka's Trial to Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K. Alongside these two towering figures, the influence of and affinities with other German-language authors (Heinrich von Kleist, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Robert Walser) and Anglophone contemporaries (Samuel Beckett, Nadine Gordimer, Cormac McCarthy) will also be considered. Other works to be read will include Kafka's Castle, In the Penal Colony, Metamorphosis and late animal stories as well as Coetzee's In the Heart of the Country, Waiting for the Barbarians and Elizabeth Costello. Advanced undergraduates may enroll with the permission of the instructor.

Weekly readings and discussions will be complemented by guest speakers from a range of disciplines including ecology, atmospheric science, computing, history of science, medicine, anthropology, literature, and the visual arts. Participants will develop their own research questions and a final project, with special consideration given to building the multi-disciplinary collaborative teams research in the environmental humanities often requires.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5430, ENGL 5430, ENVS 5410, SPAN 5430\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5440 Public Environmental Humanities\n\nBy necessity, work in environmental humanities spans academic disciplines. By design, it can also address and engage publics beyond traditional academic settings. This seminar explores best practices in public environmental humanities. Students receive close mentoring and build collaborative community to develop and execute cross-disciplinary, public engagement projects on the environment. This spring, this broadly interdisciplinary course is designed in conjunction with the ongoing environmental humanities project, An Ecotopian Toolkit for the Anthropocene. In the framework of our seminar, students will have opportunities to work with tne project’s curators and educators as well as Toolmakers on project-based assignments that also engage wider publics around issues of climate and environmental justice. This lab-style seminar is suitable for advanced undergraduates (with permission) and fulfills the “Capstone” requirement for the Minor in Environmental Humanities. It is also open to graduate students in departments across Arts and Sciences as well as other schools at the university.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ANTH 5440, COML 5440, ENVS 5440, URBS 5440\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5450 Reading Benjamin Reading Kafka\n\nReadings and discussions in English. Walter Benjamin's study of the works of Franz Kafka is as enlightening as it can be bewildering. Moving from philology to Marxism, metaphysics to messianism, Daoism to Talmud, this densely argued piece elliptically touches on almost all of Kafka's published works in just four short sections. This seminar proposes a line-by-line reading Benjamin's 1934 \"Franz Kafka on the Tenth Anniversary of His Death\" with an eye to its literary, philosophical and religious contexts as well as to the rich history of its intellectual reception. Reading Kafka's works as the essay evokes them, we will situate this piece with regard to Benjamin's other writings, the essay's interlocutors (Brod, Scholem, Lukacs, Brecht) and its most illustrious interpreters (Adorno, Arendt, Celan, Hamacher).\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 5650, JWST 5650\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nGRMN 5470 Writing in Dark Times: German Literature\n\nThe rise of Hitler and the Nazis in 1933 radically disrupted the literary marketplace in Germany.

What kind of choices were writers forced to make? What political roles did writers adopt? Under what conditions could they publish? Who read their books and how did they read them? These are some of the questions we will ask as we become acquainted with German writers in ideological adherence or alliance, in exile throughout Europe and the Americas, in \"inner emigration,\" even in concentration camps, and in hiding.
