        "text": "Damporträtt (Fru Ellen Hoppe)\n\nArtist: Isaac Grünewald (1889-1946)\n\nIsaac Grünewald (1889-1946) was a Swedish painter, graphic artist, designer and art educator. He also composed costumes and stage designs for the opera.\n\nGrünewald worked as a visual artist and ceramist and was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm from 1932-42. In 1942, he opened Grünewald's painting school in his old studio at slussen in Stockholm. Grünewald held a leading position in the Swedish modernist movement during the 1910s and became its representative in Sweden's contemporary art debate.\n\nHe was a student at the School of the Artists' Union and at Henri Matisse's Open Academy in Paris. In 1909, he made his debut at the \"De ungas\" collective exhibition. Paul Cézanne was an artist who inspired him, as did his wife and colleague Sigrid Hjertén.\n\nIsaac Grünewald's urban life is often depicted from a bird's eye view. He uses all the bright colours of the rainbow. Subjects at surprising angles, ranging from views, parks and interiors are frequent. During his decade, he was clearly influenced by Matisse. In the twenties, his style changed after he returned to Paris. Grünewald also produced a number of important portraits, such as Ellen Hoppe (1931)."
