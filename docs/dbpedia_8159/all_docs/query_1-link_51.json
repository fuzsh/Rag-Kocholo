        "text": "Isenheim Altarpiece, panels painted in oils on a sculpted altarpiece created by German artist Matthias Grünewald about 1512 to 1515. Little is known of Grünewald’s life, but he is famous for his undisputed masterpiece, the large folding altar painted for the Monastery of St. Anthony hospital chapel at Isenheim in Alsace, then part of Germany.\n\nThe Isenheim Altarpiece’s physical structure is complex, comprising two sets of folding wings. By folding and unfolding these wings, the altarpiece offers three distinct views. This view shows the patron saint of victims of the plague, St. Sebastian, on the left wing; the patron saint of the hospital’s religious order, St. Anthony, on the right wing; and Jesus Christ being laid in his tomb on the lowest wing. In the middle panel is Grünewald’s dark and harrowing depiction of the crucifixion. The horribly wounded, etiolated, crucified figure of Christ, dead or close to death, is flanked by the pointing St. John the Baptist, the desperately praying St. Mary Magdalene, and the traumatized Virgin Mary, who is held by St. John the Apostle."
