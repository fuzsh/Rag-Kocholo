Vallman studied at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm and developed a colourful naivist style of painting under the influence of Isaac Grünewald and Sven Erixson. His breakthrough came with the Ung konst (\"Young art\") exhibition in Stockholm in 1947. He later learned to know the Danish artist Asger Jorn, whose influence made Vallman develop a more abstract style. Uno Vallman was one of the original members of the avantgarde movement called COBRA which included artists like Karel Appel and Corneille. Uno Vallman travelled a lot for studies to Italy, Spain, North Africa, China, Rumania, Mexico, Russia and the USA.\n\nVallman lived in Paris for several years from 1940–1960. During these years he got acquainted with none other than Marc Chagall. Marc Chagall on his behalf was in contact with the artist Miro. He learned a lot of them. Chagall and Vallman had an exhibition in 1952 in the USA. Uno Vallman became known as one of the 'Men of 1947' and was one of a group of artists responsible for moving art forwards into a modern age in Scandinavia. The 'Men of 1947' was a group of artists who had an exhibition together during 1947. During the 1960s Vallman was described as the \"Picasso of the North\" by French art critics.\n\nUno Valmann's art was not only art but was considered a way of living called 'Valmanismen'. In 1968 Uno Vallman was invited to represent Scandinavia together with August Strindberg and Edvard Munch for a modern art exhibition in Mexico City as part of the Olympics.\n\nUno Vallman's works are included in the Swedish National Museum, The Swedish Modern Museum and other museums. His works are also included in the collections of Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter and the Tessin Institute in Paris."
