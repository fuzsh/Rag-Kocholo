        "text": "Mobility is an important part of the everyday life and practice of artists. Many artists take part in short-term mobility in order to gain inspiration, form partnerships and contacts, and create networks and/or collaborations. Some of these pathways created through mobilities are well-established while other transnational connections have only recently been formed as artists connect to new, emerging art centres. With each new connection usually linking up yet another city, and with every artist presenting a different set of connections and trajectories, the artistic ‘transnation’ (Yeoh and Willis 2004, 1) is constantly developing. This article describes how this type of short-term, multi-directional mobility not only creates connections, forms collaborations, and helps to establish transnational communities, but is also vital in helping liminal cities to become part of the so-called global art world. More importantly, these artists’ base remains in the Baltic cities - Vilnius, Riga,...\n\nUnlike Modernism in the Netherlands, France, Germany or the Soviet Union, \"Functionalism\" in Sweden was not the result of a revolutionary upheaval after the First World War, but instead arose largely as the result of reception of the Bauhaus and Neues Bauen in the Weimar Republic. In this contribution we will examine some aspects of this transfer from the continent to the north and its impact in Sweden. Looking northward reveals the overlaps with, as well as the differences from, a closely related, yet alternative, development of modernity. Swedish reception only began in the second half of the 1920s: inter alia, Sven Markelius (1889–1972) visited the Bauhaus in 1927, and Sune Lindström (1906–1989) studied there in 1928. Increasingly lively exchanges around 1930 – with the Stockholm exhibition in 1930 and the Acceptera Manifesto (1931) – led to the breakthrough of Modernism in Sweden and, vice-versa, to international recognition of Swedish Modernists. This was followed almost seamlessly by the arrival of a number of exiled Bauhaus figures, such as Fred Forbat (1897-1972) and Werner Taesler (1907-1994), who emigrated to neutral Sweden. Both reception of the Bauhaus by Swedish architects and work by Bauhaus protagonists in Swedish exile contributed significantly to establishing a Swedish \"Functionalism\" that formed an aesthetic and political programme for Sweden's transformation into a welfare state.\n\nArchitects in Exile. Stories of New Spatial Experiences 29 and 30 May 2023 Politecnico di Milano. Collective imagination has traditionally associated architecture with political and economic power. As a result, when quoting Edward Said: «Modern Western culture is, in large part, the work of exiles, émigrés, refugees», the last people we typically consider are exiled architects. But is the heritage left by exiled architects truly insignificant? Can we find expressions of their spiritual quest, new life experiences, nostalgic feelings, and aesthetic shocks in their works? When does Modernism cease to be a uni- versal language and instead becomes an existential language of the exile – and can they both coexist? The international conference Architects in Exile. Stories of New Spatial Experciences aims to address these questions.\n\nWhat really happened in the 90’s? Well, we learned the art of collecting frequent flyer miles, travelling to peripheries in search of the new.1 Nordic Art Review Today’s fight for modernity is being waged in the same terms as yesterday’s, barring the fact that the avant-garde has stopped patrolling like some scout, the troop having come to a cautious standstill around a bivouac of certainties (biuoac de certitudes). Art was intended to prepare and announce a future world; today it is modelling possible universes.2"
