We are delighted to offer for sale a unique watercolor painting by the renowned Swedish artist, Isaac Grünewald (1889-1946). This special piece is painted on a postcard and depicts a farmer holding a pitchfork, ready for a day's work. The farmer is adorned in yellow shoes, checkered trousers in shades of pink and green, a blue jacket, and a straw hat. The features of his nose and lips are distinctly rendered, and the pitchfork is held high, signaling his readiness to work.

On the back of the postcard, Isaac penned a New Year's greeting to the Aschberg family. According to the postmark, the postcard was sent in 1923, making it exactly 100 years old. The postcard has been recently framed in a specially crafted, reversible frame handmade by Stockholms Bildhuggeri.

Isaac Grünewald was one of Sweden's most prominent modernist painters. Born in Stockholm in 1889, he studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and later in Paris under Henri Matisse. Grünewald was heavily influenced by the Fauvist movement, and his work is characterized by its bold use of color and expressionist style.

This watercolor postcard is not only a testament to Isaac Grünewald's skill as an artist but also a piece of history, providing insight into the artist's personal connections and the way in which he used his art to communicate with friends and loved ones. The detailed depiction of the farmer, combined with the personal message on the back and the expertly crafted, reversible frame, make this artwork a fascinating and valuable addition to any art collection.
