Isaac Grünewald (1889 - 1946) active as a visual artist and ceramist as well as a professor at the Art Academy in Stockholm during the years 1932-42. Grünewald had a leading position in the Swedish modernist movement during the 1910s and became its representative in Sweden's contemporary art debate. He was a student at the Artists' Association's school and at Henri Matisse's open academy in Paris. In 1909, he made his debut at the "De ungas" collective exhibition with artists such as Ture Ander and Arvid Nilsson. Grünewald considered himself an expressionist as his focus was on the expression of the artwork. Paul Cézanne was an artist who inspired him as well as his wife and colleague Sigrid Hjertén. He depicted the seething city life in surprising angles, often in a bird's eye view, virtuosoly treated in the bright colors of the rainbow. His paintings are taken from reality, but not captured in front of the subject but from memory. He painted the city and its swirling life, vistas, parks and interiors. With diagonals and cuts, he built his compositions and underlined the interplay between the warm and the cold colors. During his twenties, he was significantly influenced by Matisse. During the twenties, his style changed after he returned to Paris. The landscapes were painted directly in front of the subject, so also a series of colorful floral still lifes and nude models. Later he approached reality even more, but never completely abandoned memorial painting.
