        "text": "An Advance Base in the Solomon Islands Area, Nov. 17.\n\nThe death of Rear Admiral Norman Scott in battle off Guadalcanal in the early hours of last Friday, Nov. 13, deprived the United States navy of a fighting admiral whose ships had become known as “Scott’s Night Raiders.”\n\nHe was last seen standing on the bridge of a cruiser, binoculars to his eyes, watching the first phase of an uneven conflict with bigger Japanese guns.\n\nA shell hit the bridge, killing nearly everybody on it. If I hadn’t run out of money a few days before and left the ship to cable for more, I would have been with him on the bridge.\n\nOn other missions with Admiral Scott, I had observed how keenly he was admired by the men of the fleet as a fighting admiral and as a friendly, plain-spoken and down-to-earth gentleman. He was the embodiment of the offensive spirit – a factor vital against an enemy as bold as the Japanese.\n\nHis force became known as Scott’s Night Raiders in a battle sector where the Japanese preferred to strike at night.\n\nScott left Washington only last June and achieved flag (rear admiral) rank shortly afterward. At the start of the war in the Pacific, he commanded a cruiser. Then he was called to Washington for a brief spell at a desk job.\n\nBack on sea duty, he soon enhanced his reputation as a striking admiral. I first heard of him early in October when I happened to be on a cruiser that wasn’t having luck running into anything that would make newspaper copy. An officer said, “Why don’t you get with Admiral Scott?”\n\nAt the next port, I missed his force by one day – the time it seriously damaged a force of Japanese cruisers and destroyers by night in the second battle of Savo island.\n\nI caught up with him a couple of weeks later and sure enough he was in pursuit of a sizable Japanese force, possibly one bigger than his own. He told me about the second battle on Savo island and blessed his luck. He caught the enemy completely by surprise. He insisted on giving the captains of all his ships major credit for the victory.\n\n“All I did was lead them in,” he said.\n\nReturning to the problem at hand, he said: “This is a tough one but we’ll see what we can do.”\n\nHis flag secretary confided: “History is going to be made tonight.”\n\nA message from Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the United States Pacific fleet, was relayed to all hands. “Your comrades away from the battle scene are cheering for you. Good luck.” admiral’s message said.\n\nFor several hours it looked like yes or no for big stakes, but the opposing forces never made contact.\n\nA few mornings later, we streamed along the north coast of Guadalcanal giving the Japanese land positions there the heaviest and longest bombardment of the war up to that time. It lasted two hours and 15 minutes. When it was over, Admiral Scott looked for another place to strike. He had no hesitancy about going in with inferior numbers and size.\n\nHe was a stickler for accuracy in reporting and believed in the strictest enforcement of regulations. One day I went into a certain part of the ship without knowing it was barred to correspondents. The admiral promptly gave me a dressing down. But we were still friends and, a little while later, he was speaking with warmth and brilliance about books and ships and other reporters he had known.\n\nUnlike many senior naval officers, he spoke as plainly as the people you hear on street corners of small towns. Perhaps that was due to his Hoosier background. He came from Indianapolis but more recently called Washington, D. C., his home.\n\nIn the first World War, Admiral Scott, then a junior officer, commanded the destroyer Jacob Jones in patrol off southern Ireland, and he was on that ship when she was torpedoed.\n\nHe deeply respected his men and they followed him proudly. The feeling that existed throughout ships he commanded was well illustrated by the remarks of a young shell-handler who had exhausted himself while passing up ammunition to bombard the Japs on Guadalcanal.\n\n“I’m so tired I can hardly move,” the youth said, “but we got a ‘well done’ from Admiral Scott and that’s good enough for me.”\n\nAt A U. S. Naval Station in the Marshalls –\n\n. . . I was catching a plane that morning and had to be over at the airport in an hour. “Come over to the signal tower when you’re dressed and I’ll have some hot coffee for you, “the voice said. . .\n\nI dressed and went across the street. Signalman 2/c John E. Hamadock was waiting for me with hot coffee.\n\n“I did a hitch in the Navy back in the early twenties,” he said, “and got out in 1923. I’m 43 now and have a wife and four children. My home’s in Elizabeth, Pa., just outside Pittsburgh.” He paused for a moment and then asked half shyly if I thought I could do him a favor. It was like this, he said. When he finished his last hitch back in ’23 his commanding officer was Lt. Comdr. Norman Scott of the old USS Burns. “He was the greatest guy I ever knew,” Hamadock continued, “and when I learned he had been killed down in the South Pacific I felt I’d like to enlist again and in some small way do my part in repaying the Japs for Admiral Scott’s death. I figured I owed him a debt for the many fine things he had done for me and other members of his crew. My wife didn’t want me to go . . .\n\n“Well, I went out and enlisted and my wife got a job in a war plant . . . What I meant by a favor, well – when we took this place I recovered some papers which I figured had some valuable military information and turned them over to my officers. The other day I got a letter commending me and the letter indicated the papers were valuable, all right. What I mean is, if you could mention this in the paper someway and my wife would see it she’d know I’m really doing my bit and my enlistment wasn’t a foolish thing to do like she said. I feel like I’ve already paid back some of that debt to Admiral Scott.”\n\nI said I’d see what I could do and told him I had known Norm Scott years ago and recalled him as a fine man.\n\nAnd that is why I have written this little piece about an old Navy man who wanted to repay a debt. His sincerity was evident and I got kind of a lump in the throat as we stood there in the half light talking. He wasn’t a very big fellow, just average height and balding and his face was lined with the care of raising a family of four and it was tanned and leathery from the wind and sun. . .\n\nHe kept referring to the late Norman Scott and you could see he had been devoted to him. Said he used to get a letter from him once in a while. “He never forgot the men who had served under him,” he said simply. “That’s why I just couldn’t let him down and I hope wherever he is he knows I’m back doing my small part. . .”"
