        "text": "George Herbert’s anguish when he sensed that God was calling him to become a priest, his almost mystical vision of the priestly office, and the total dedication with which he finally embraced it, provide us with inspiration and encouragement in our own desire to serve God. In this perceptive study of four of Herbert’s best-loved poems, ‘The Collar’, ‘Love’, ‘Aaron’, and ‘The Flower’, Kenneth Mason shows how Herbert’s way with words illuminates God’s ways with the human heart.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nGeorge Herbert died at the age of 39, in March 1633. A month before, he had given the manuscript of his poems to an emissary of Nicholas Ferrar, who had it copied out and then printed as The Temple. In the preface to that popular book, Vaughan would have learned that Herbert was ‘nobly born’, but had given up on a fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, ‘choosing rather to serve at God’s Altar’. In 1630, Herbert became rector of Bemerton, near Salisbury, where he remained for the rest of his short life.\n\nClick here to see all books by this author.\n\nKenneth Mason, born in 1931, was ordained priest in 1959. After eleven years in parish ministry in the Diocese of York, he moved to Canterbury, where he was engaged from 1969 to 1989 in ministerial training and education. He was then Principal of Coates Hall, the Episcopal Theological College in Edinburgh, until 1995. He now lives in retirement in the Diocese of Ripon.\n\nClick here to see all books by this author."
