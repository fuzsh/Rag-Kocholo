        "text": "Footnotes\n\nFine photograph of the Scott and his officers seated for dinner to celebrate his forty-third birthday on 6 June 1911 in Antarctica. \"It shows that they ate very well and that this special occasion they took great care with the presentation of the meal... There is a strong patriotic atmosphere: a Union Jack is laid on the table and behind Scott we see sledge flags belonging to the team\" (D. Hempelman-Adams, S. Gordon and E. Stuart, The Heart of the Great Alone. Scott, Shackleton and Antarctic Photography, 2009, p.113).\n\nThe Fine Art Society mounted the first public exhibition of Ponting's photographs at their gallery in New Bond Street, London on 4 December 1913, displaying 146 images, and generating some 680 orders. They were available in four sizes, the present sample being the third largest exhibition format. Landscapes proved the most popular, with comparatively few portrait ordered (for example just thirteen orders were received for the special set of large photographs of the polar party), with the present image rare and one of the few images Ponting developed as toned silver bromide prints.\n\nProvenance: Fine Art Society label (captioned in ink \"Capt. Scotts Birthday Dinner / 1911. / 51\" on the reverse), with pencil name \"Jeffreys L.\" beneath in pencil. On the backing board of the frame is a trade label of Richard Jeffreys, picture dealer and framer, Liverpool."
