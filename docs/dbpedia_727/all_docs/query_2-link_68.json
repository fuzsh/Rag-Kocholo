The Grierson edition is not to be regarded as a Collected Letters. For a full (ongoing) list of correspondence to and from Scott, consult the Millgate Union Catalogue of Walter Scott Correspondence. The Walter Scott Digital Archive would like to thank Constable & Robinson Ltd for permission to make this e-text available.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Editor\n\nSir Herbert Grierson (1866-1960), born in Lerwick, Shetland, was the first Professor of English at Aberdeen University (1894-1915) and was later appointed Regius Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh University (1915-35). He is best-known for introducing the work of the Metaphysical poets to T.S. Eliot and the Modernist generation through his 1921 anthology Metaphysical Lyrics & Poems of the Seventeenth Century and his edition of the works of John Donne (1912). He was also, however, an important Scotticist. Besides editing Scott's correspondence with assistance from Davidson Cook and W.M. Parker, he published a life of Scott 'supplementary to and corrective of, Lockhart's biography' (1938) and the Saltire Classics edition of Songs and Lyrics of Sir Walter Scott (1942). For the centenary year 1932, he published a series of 'lectures to the young' on Scott and edited the volume of essays Sir Walter Scott To-day. He was knighted for his services to English Studies in 1936. The Notes and Index to his edition of Scott's Letters were prepared by James C. Corson and published in 1979.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe Transcriber\n\nThe Walter Scott Digital Archive would like to thank Professor Takero Sato who prepared this e-text and very kindly offered to make it generally available via our site. A distinguished Scotticist, Takero Sato is the author of A Concordance to the Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott (1996) and of Japanese translations of The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1983), Marmion (1995), and The Lady of the Lake (2002), and of J.G. Lockhart's Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Bart (2001). Since retiring from his post as Professor of English at Tsukuba International University, he has become President of the Japan-Scotland Society.\n\nBack to top\n\nE-Text\n\nClick on the text links below to access PDF files of The Letters of Sir Walter Scott.

'3-55' indicates that the text corresponds to Vol. III, p. 255 of the Constable edition. Numbers which occur in the text refer to footnotes in the original edition.\n\nBack to top\n\nBack to Index of E-Texts"
