        "meta_description": "SCOTT GEORGE HERBERT: (1888-1930) British airship pilot and engineer who commanded the airship R34 on its return Atlantic crossing in 1919, which marked the first transatlantic flight by an airship and the first east-west transatlantic flight by an aircraft of any kind. Scott was killed in the R101 crash in northern France during a flight to India. Scarce fountain pen ink signature ('G. Herbert Scott') and date, 17th October 1929, in his hand on an oblong 12mo piece neatly laid down to a page removed from an autograph album. The page also features a small newspaper portrait of Scott and a similar signed piece by Hannen Swaffer (1879-1962) English journalist, and to the verso appears an irregularly clipped signed piece by Maud Tree (1863-1937) English actress. Some light age wear, VG",
