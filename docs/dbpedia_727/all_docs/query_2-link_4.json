        "text": "Scott is a surname of Scottish origin.[1] It is first attributed to Uchtredus filius Scoti who is mentioned in the charter recording the foundation of Holyrood Abbey and Selkirk in 1120, the border Riding clans who settled Peeblesshire in the 10th century and the family lineage of the Duke of Buccleuch.[2]\n\nEtymology and history of the surname\n\n[edit]\n\nThe surname Scott (Scot, Scotts, Scutt, Scotter) as opposed to its earlier unrelated usage first appears in the 12th century and derives from the Anglo-Scottish border and its medieval border clans.[1][3] Scott is one of the twelve most common surnames in Scotland. Clan Scott was one of the most powerful of the Riding clans of the Scottish borders and rose to power in the turbulent, often violent region, where they conducted fierce raids and battles with neighbouring clans.\n\nThe surname appears in Kent, England by the 14th century, the family of Scot's Hall being a notable example. Descent is thought to be from Alexander de Balliol or William de Balliol le Scot, brothers of John de Balliol King of Scotland, or from retainers of King David I of Scotland who held lands from the Earl of Huntingdon.[1] By the 17th century the name is first recorded in Ireland as a surname.[3] There is no evidence the surname may have originated with the first Gaelic settlers from Ireland despite its use as a marker for a Gael by the Romans. Moreover, in the medieval period the surname was associated with the Kingdom of Scotland rather than an early Irish medieval Gaelic kingdom Dalriada who did not refer to themselves as such, even though separate sources claim that the name was derived from the Scots who invaded Dalriada (Argyll) from Ireland.[4]\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople with the surname\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Scott (given name)\n\nReginald Scot, author of \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\"\n\nScot's Hall, a landed family based in Kent, England\n\nScott (baseball), a 19th-century American professional baseball player whose given name is unknown\n\nScott Baronets of Great Barr, a baronetage of the United Kingdom created in 1806\n\nAaron Scott (footballer) (born 1986), New Zealand footballer\n\nAdam Scott (golfer) (born 1980), Australian golfer\n\nAdam Scott (actor) (born 1973), American actor\n\nAdrian Gilbert Scott (1882–1963), English ecclesiastical architect\n\nAdrienne Williams Scott, American ophthalmologist\n\nAlexander Walker Scott (1800–1883), entomologist\n\nAlfred Angas Scott (1875–1923), British motorcycle designer, founder of the Scott Motorcycle Company\n\nAllan Scott (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nAmber Scott, Australian ballet dancer\n\nAndrew Scott (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nAnn London Scott (1929–1975), American feminist\n\nAnne Firor Scott (1921–2019), American historian\n\nBarbara Ann Scott (1928–2012), Canadian figure-skater\n\nBarry Scott (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nBeckie Scott (born 1974), Canadian cross-country skier\n\nBen Scott (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nBenjamin Scott (1814–1892), Chamberlain of London\n\nBill Scott (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nBobby Scott (U.S. politician) (born 1947), American politician from Virginia\n\nBon Scott (1946–1980), Scottish-born Australian rock musician, AC/DC\n\nBoston Scott (born 1995), American football player\n\nBrandon Scott (born 1981), American actor, voice actor and producer\n\nBruce Scott (disambiguation), multiple people\n\nByron Scott (born 1961), American basketball coach\n\nByron N.
