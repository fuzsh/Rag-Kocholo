        "text": "About the title\n\nKing of glory, King of peace, I will love thee;\n\nand that love may never cease, I will move thee.\n\nThou hast granted my request, thou hast heard me;\n\nthou didst note my working breast, thou hast spared me.\n\nWherefore with my utmost art I will sing thee,\n\nand the cream of all my heart I will bring thee.\n\nThough my sins against me cried, thou didst clear me;\n\nand alone, when they replied, thou didst hear me.\n\nSeven whole days, not one in seven, I will praise thee;\n\nin my heart, though not in heaven, I can raise thee.\n\nSmall it is, in this poor sort to enroll thee:\n\ne’en eternity’s too short to extol thee.\n\nGeorge Herbert, 1633\n\nThis has long been a favorite hymn text of mine. Why did I choose the title of my blog from the opening words of the third verse? I think it captures our purpose as Christians — to praise God without ceasing. The Christian life is not an exercise for Sundays; it is rather something in which we seek to immerse ourselves at all times, and in all places.\n\nAbout the blogger\n\nI’m Scott Gunn, an Episcopal priest. In my ministry, I serve as the Executive Director of Forward Movement in Cincinnati, OH. Our mission is to inspire disciples and empower evangelists, which is something I’m always glad to go on about. You can buy books I’ve written. I am a Deputy to General Convention, serving on behalf of the Diocese of Southern Ohio. In 2012 and 2009, I served in this capacity from the Diocese of Rhode Island. I’m also on the board of the Anglican Theological Review. When I’m not on the road preaching or speaking, you can find me at Christ Church Glendale here in the Cincinnati area.\n\nNot only am I a church geek, but I am a bona fide technology geek. Prior to ordination, I worked in technology spheres, including The Atlantic Monthly & Fast Company, the MIT Media Lab, and Education Development Center. If asked, I’ll tell you about my high-flying and quickly-crashing experience at a dot-com.\n\nOh, yes, the final obligatory bits. I’m married, and we have one dog in our household. You can follow our dog, George, on Instagram (@georgetdog). Yes, he’s named after George Herbert. I enjoy music, reading, photography, and travel.\n\nYou can find me on Bluesky, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, or flickr. If you want to send email, write to 7wd {at} swingspan dot c o m.\n\nSharing Content from the Blog\n\nEverything I write for this blog is licensed under Creative Commons.
