        "meta_description": "\"This aggression will not stand.\" With these words, George Herbert Walker Bush committed the United States to the liberation of the oil-rich Kingdom of Kuwait, after it had been occupied by the Republic of Iraq in August of 1990. Over considerable opposition, Bush rallied the country to the cause, and assembled an unprecedented international coalition. George H. W. Bush devoted his life to his family and to his country. He enlisted in the Naval Reserve and flew combat missions in World War II while still a teenager. After enjoying success in business, and raising his family, he entered political life, serving as Congressman, Vice President and finally President of the United States. His administration saw the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, renewal of the Voting Rights Act, and successful American military actions in Kuwait and Panama. Over the course of his career, he involved himself in many of the most contentious political debates of the age, but through it all he retained the personal goodwill of political allies and adversaries alike.",

        "text": "Who inspired you as a young person?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Abraham Lincoln truly inspired me. It wasn’t just the freeing of the slaves, he kept the Union together. Some people even forget that today. What I think inspired me was the fact that in spite of being the president of the United States he retained a certain down-to-earth quality. He never got to be a big shot, and he cared about people.\n\nWas there a book that inspired you?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: One of the historians here in Williamsburg talked about War and Peace. I had to read that in school. It was an inspiring, lengthy treatise. I read it twice. It taught me a lot about life. There was a marvelous book by Salinger called Catcher in the Rye. There was a book about discrimination called Gentleman’s Agreement. These books I think helped shape my life. But to be honest with you, not one book stands out as the defining book for me.\n\nHow important is passion to achievement?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Passion is terribly important. You’ve got to feel something strongly. If you don’t feel something strongly you’re not going to achieve. You’re not going to go the extra mile. Passion is important in relationships. It’s important in a man/woman relationship. Letting the other person know that you really love her and that you care. And so, it’s a powerful word, but without passion, without really believing something, it’s hard to achieve.\n\nHow do you see the importance of preparation for high achievement?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Know what you’re talking about. Get out there and do enough homework, have enough background, understand enough history so that you’re prepared for what you face today, and prepared to achieve your objectives. So, preparation is important. And it could be erudition, studying, so that you’re bright. It could be being schooled in values, so you can be kind and gentle, it could be a lot of things. But preparation – particularly for the younger people who haven’t really experienced the real business of living — it means work and it means broadening yourself so that you can better perform, better achieve objectives.\n\nHow about perseverance?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: To achieve, you’re going to have to persevere. And by that I mean that you can’t let a roadblock turn you around. You can’t expect life’s path to be totally smooth. You’re going to have to overcome adversity.\n\nPerseverance means having the strength to prevail, to achieve your objective. I think if I were a high-achieving high school kid, privileged to attend meetings like the one I’m attending now in Williamsburg, Virginia, I would say, “You’ve come a long way. You’re better than your peers, but you’re just beginning.”\n\nIf you really want to make a difference, whether it’s in helping other people, or whether it’s in fighting for your country, or whether it’s in the political arena, or journalism, or physics, you’ve got to persevere. You’ve got to understand that there are going to be some enormous bumps in the road. They can be personal. You can get hurt badly. You can lose a friend, or a child, or a wife, or a husband. But you’ve got to persevere, you’ve got to be guided by certain principles and stay the course. If you quit, if you run away when the going gets tough, you won’t really understand what a full life is all about.\n\nWhat role do you think courage plays?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Courage is a terribly important value. It means you don’t run away when things are tough. It means you don’t turn away from a friend when he or she is in trouble. It means standing up against the majority opinion. In a fundamental sense it means: are you willing to give your life so somebody else can save his or hers? Courage is terribly important. There’s a lot of people who won’t wear it on their sleeve, or display it through some heroic act. But courage is having the strength to do what’s honorable and decent.\n\nIf you had a tip to share with young people, what would that be?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: If I were to give advice to young people, high-achieving young people for example, I’d have to say, don’t neglect your family. Politics is important, sitting at the head table is glamorous. Traveling around the world, trying to do something for world peace was wonderful. But family and friends and faith are what really matter in life. And I know that. I see it so clearly now. And so, as they climb the ladder of achievement, I’d simply say, remember what Barbara Bush told those girls at Wellesley: “What happens in your house is more important than what happens in the White House.” And it’s true. It’s so 100 percent true. And that means we — each of these achievers — must find some way, not only stay in touch with family, but to help others who might not be blessed with family. To strengthen the American family.\n\nIt’s family, and it’s faith, and it’s friends, and it’s not the glamour of the Presidency, or the wonder of going to receive the Nobel Prize. All those are important, of course. But maybe it’s just that I’m 71 years old now. It’s family, and it’s faith, and it’s friends. I would tell them that. Don’t forget that. In your brilliance, don’t turn your back on your friends. Don’t think you’re entitled to something because you’re smarter than the next guy.\n\nWhat does the American Dream to you?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: The American Dream means being what you want to be. Achieving something. Giving it your all to achieve. But it means helping others. It means understanding that we are the kindest and most generous nation on the face of the earth. We’ve got huge social problems, I’m afraid that some bright young people today, and older people, don’t really appreciate the blessings of living in the most decent, strongest, fairest, most generous country on the face of the earth. And I say that with some historical perspective. The American Dream means giving it your all, trying your hardest, accomplishing something. And then I’d add to that, giving something back. No definition of a successful life can do anything but include serving others.\n\nHow do you see the concept of vision in public service?\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: Vision is an interesting word. I’m the president that the national press corps felt had no vision, and yet I worked for a more peaceful world. And we did something to say to a totalitarian dictator in Iraq, you’re not going to take over your neighboring country. There’s a vision there, which was peace. So, I’m a little defensive in the use of the word. Because I think the pundits had it down that I had no vision, but I did. You need a vision, you need a central core. You need to say, “Here’s what I’m going to try to do to make life better for others.”\n\nIt doesn’t have to be proclaimed in the fanciest prose. It doesn’t have to be done with the most rhetorical flourish. It has to be your inner self. It’s got to drive you. It can be a personal thing. It can be your set of values. Your vision can be, “I want to live to this code of behavior.” It can be so many different things for one person or another. But I think you need it. I think you need to have an idea of where you want to be the next day, and ten years from now.\n\nI’ve got a vision now. I’ve been President of the United States, and my vision is being the best grandfather in the entire world. It’s a good vision. You let all these kids talk about all these marvelous books they’re going to write, Nobel Prizes they’re going to win, political mountains they’re going to climb, but I can tell them, having been there, it’s family that’s important. My vision is to stay the hell out of the press and to be a good father and a good grandfather. That’s a good vision, because there are families under great stress these days.\n\nCommunication is very important.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: It is. Nobody has ever accused me of being a superior communicator. If I could have conveyed to the American people the concerns I had, and my heartbeat, a little more clearly, maybe I would not be unemployed and retired. And I might not be this happy, either.\n\nI learned a lot from Ronald Reagan about communication. Never got to be in his league in terms of it, but he could say something and the American people might not agree with the issue, but they could empathize with him. He could communicate in a marvelous way, with humor, and conviction.\n\nI suppose it’s a skill you can learn, but I always figured, if I do my best and try my hardest, there will be some good things, there will be some failures, the American people will judge me on all of that. And they will. It takes time. I’m not going to write a memoir. Let somebody else figure out my shortcomings and my possible successes.\n\nYou’ve moved on.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush: I don’t want to be called a senior citizen, I feel like a spring colt. I don’t want to be called a has-been, because there’s things I want to do in life. But, I’ve been there and I’d say, “Don’t let the bastards get you down.” And they don’t anymore, I don’t talk to them anymore, so they don’t get me down. I’ve got my family, and I’ve got so many blessings that I don’t think I’ve earned, that I’m a very happy man. I can’t wait for the next day."
