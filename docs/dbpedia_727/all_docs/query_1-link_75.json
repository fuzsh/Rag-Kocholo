The following detailed analysis of Hebrews 3 and 4, paralleled with a close reading of both \"The Pulley\" and an additional four Herbert poems--\"Aaron,\" \"Peace,\" \"Sunday,\" and \"Even-song\"--will show something of Herbert's broader consideration of the ideals of rest explored by the author of Hebrews.(from article)",
