        "text": "published on 2018-03-09T14:07:11Z\n\nIn this episode you will hear renowned actor Andrew Scott talking about the poem that has been a friend to him - 'Love (III)' by George Herbert. Andrew visited us Battersea, London and is in conversation with The Poetry Exchange team members Fiona Bennett and Michael Schaeffer. 'Love' is read by Michael Schaeffer. ***** Love (III) Love bade me welcome. Yet my soul drew back, Guilty of dust and sin. But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack From my first entrance in, Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning If I lacked anything. âA guest,â I answered, âworthy to be here.â Love said, âYou shall be he.â âI the unkind, ungrateful? Ah my dear, I cannot look on thee.â Love took my hand, and smiling did reply, âWho made the eyes but I?â âTruth Lord; but I have marred them; let my shame Go where it doth deserve.â âAnd know you not,â says Love, âwho bore the blame?â âMy dear, then I will serve.â âYou must sit down,â says Love, âand taste my meat:â So I did sit and eat.\n\nGenre\n\nStorytelling"
