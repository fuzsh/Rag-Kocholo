        "meta_description": "Winfield Scott was born to William Scott (1747–1789) and Anna Mason (1748–1803) on Laurel Branch, the family plantation in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, near Petersburg, Virginia, on June 13, 1786. He briefly attended College of William and Mary, studied law in the office of a private attorney, and served as a Virginia militia cavalry corporal near Petersburg in 1807.\r\n\r\nScott's long career in the United States Army began when he was commissioned as a captain in the Light Artillery in May 1808, shortly before his 20th birthday.\r\n\r\nScott's early career in the army was tumultuous. Scott openly criticized the then Commanding General of the Army, James Wilkinson. Scott was court-martialed for insubordination in 1810 and had his commission suspended for one year. Afterwards, Captain Scott served in New Orleans on staff of General Wade Hampton from 1811 to 1812.",
