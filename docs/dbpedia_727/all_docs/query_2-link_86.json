        "text": "A few days ago, I had blogged all 291 resolutions for the 81st General Convention of the Episcopal Church. But your intrepid Resolutionpalooza writer has been keeping an eye on the virtual binder, and...\n\nSince I wrote a few days ago, back when there were 275 resolutions heading to General Convention, there have been twelve new ones. In this post, we’ll look at one B resolution, one C resolution, ten D resolutions, and one X resolution.\n\nResolutionpalooza has blogged 260 resolutions before this post. That net caught all the resolutions that were available as of a few days ago. Since then, there are a few new ones. So this post will sweep up the newest resolutions heading to various committees.\n\nIt’s time for three committees in one post! Committee 20: Confirmation of the election of the Presiding Bishop, Committee 21: Dispatch of Business, and Committee 23: Privilege and Courtesy. Relax, it’s just six resolutions.\n\nResolutionpalooza continues with a deep dive into serious church geekery, this time with a look at proposed changes to the Episcopal Church’s constitution and canons. Many of these changes are simple cleanup, but some have huge potential to change our church — for better or worse, depending on your perspective.\n\nThe sanctum sanctorum for church nerds: the committee on rules of order. We will look at proposed changes for both the joint rules (for bishops and deputies), as well as those for the House of Deputies. If you’re a bishop or deputy, pay attention. If not, perhaps move along.\n\nToday’s theme in Resolutionpalooza is Title III, the ministry canons of the Episcopal Church. There are no proposals here about the baptismal ministry of all Christians, just some (important) stuff on religious folk and clergy.\n\nIn today’s installment of Resolutionpalooza fun, we turn to the resolutions concerning clergy discipline. These are the rules for dealing with clergy who are accused of wrongdoing of various kinds.\n\nResolutionpalooza continues with a bonus post today, this one on the committee addressing resolutions about accessibility and inclusion. Here we go!\n\nResolutionpalooza continues today with a look at all the resolutions heading to committee 16 on safety, wellness, and mental health. The name of this committee causes me to want to write a resolution making it a Title IV offense to omit the Oxford comma, but I digress.\n\nI believe climate change and environmental degradation constitute the greatest threat to human well-being, so environmental stewardship and care of creation is definitely something the church should be paying attention to! We should lead the way as a model of ethical behavior\n\nThis batch of resolutions considers resolutions about ecumenical and interfaith work. The former is important because we must seek to repair Christ’s Body, the church, and to seek unity. The latter is important because we need to love our neighbors, and that means talking about the most important things, matters of faith."
