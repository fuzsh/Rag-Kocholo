To accomplish this, the agency must be continuously engaged in risk, threat, and vulnerability assessments.\n\nThese efforts result in tailored, intelligence-driven protection that identifies and mitigates threats and vulnerabilities before enemies to the judicial process can exploit them.\n\nThe judicial security team utilizes best practices, innovation, intelligence, and increased collaboration within and outside of the U.S. Marshals Service to improve how it keeps people and places safe every day."
