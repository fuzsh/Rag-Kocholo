Community Health Initiatives The Department of Health (Philippines) has launched multiple community health campaigns like the National Dengue Prevention and Control Program and the Vax-Baby-Vax campaign. These initiatives present opportunities for collaboration with healthcare providers and suppliers of vaccines and medical supplies.

Government Partnerships By partnering with organizations like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Suffolk County Water Authority, the DOH demonstrates a commitment to public health collaborations. This opens avenues for solution providers offering technology, research, and services in the healthcare sector to work on joint projects.

Technology Adoption The use of tech tools like Drupal, MySQL, and Shopify within the DOH infrastructure signifies a readiness to leverage digital solutions. Tech companies providing healthcare software, data management systems, and IT services can explore opportunities to offer tailored solutions to enhance the department's efficiency.

Executive Leadership Under the leadership of Secretary Francisco Duque, the DOH emphasizes quality healthcare provision and regulatory excellence. Solution providers can engage with key decision-makers in the department to align their offerings with the strategic vision set by leadership for improved health services.
