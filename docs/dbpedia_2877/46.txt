MANILA, Philippines — The health emergency allowance (HEA) of health workers who served during the COVID pandemic amounting to P76.1 billion has been released.

In a statement released on Tuesday night, the Department of Health (DOH) said more than 8.5 million claims from July 2021 to July 20, 2023 have been settled.

The DOH said P19.9 billion has been allotted for HEA under the programmed appropriation for this year, of which 99 percent or P19.7 billion was distributed to eligible health facilities.

“The DOH still requires an estimated P27 billion to pay for arrears filed by health facilities,” the department said.

Additional funds can be released only after signing of memorandums of agreement as well as liquidation by concerned local government units and private hospitals of HEA funds that had been paid.

The DOH gave assurance that it continues to coordinate with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) for the payment of HEA.

“We are ready to release the funds as soon as concerned private and local government unit hospitals comply with the law that requires liquidation,” it said.

The DBM said it has released a total of P91.2 billion to cover the benefits of healthcare workers since 2021.

It called on the DOH to finalize the computation of pending HEA claims to determine if additional funding is required.

The grant of HEA to eligible health care workers is provided under the Public Health Emergency Benefits and Allowance for Health Care Workers Act.

Under the law, health care workers are entitled to HEAs for every month of service while the country is under a state of public health emergency.

Meanwhile, DOH employees defended the department against criticisms over the delay in the release of HEA as well as COVID sickness and death compensation.
