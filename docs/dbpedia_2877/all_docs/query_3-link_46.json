        "text": "Immigrant petitions:\n\nFor immigrant petitions, there is a two-step process after obtaining a labor certification from the Department of Labor, if applicable (employers seeking to hire professional nurses or physical therapists apply for Schedule A, Group I certification by filing an uncertified labor certification and visa petition directly with USCIS):\n\nStep 1: Generally, the Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker, is first filed by an employer on behalf of the prospective noncitizen worker. In adjudicating the I-140 petition, USCIS reviews all eligibility requirements. In addition to evaluating the petitioner’s continuing ability to pay the proffered wage, this review includes examination of the beneficiary’s qualifications (for example, education, experience, licensure, and/or training as set forth in the job opportunity’s requirements on the labor certification and the preference category and Schedule A Group I requirements as applicable).\n\nFor physical therapists, 20 CFR 656.15(c)(1) requires that the employer include evidence to establish that the beneficiary currently has (and had at the time of filing) a permanent license to practice in the state of intended employment or, in the alternative, a letter or statement, signed by an authorized state physical therapy licensing official in the state of intended employment with the petition submission to USCIS. The letter must confirm that the noncitizen is qualified to take that state’s written licensing examination for physical therapists.\n\nFor nurses, 20 CFR 656.15(c)(2) requires that the employer include CGFNS certification, a full and unrestricted (permanent) license to practice nursing in the state of intended employment, or passage of NCLEX-RN as part of the petition submission to USCIS.\n\nSchedule A Group I applications require other evidentiary submissions such as a prevailing wage determination covering the proffered position in the geographic location where the work will be performed and a notice of filing either posted at the facility or location of the employment or, if applicable, sent to the appropriate bargaining unit.\n\nStep 2: If the noncitizen worker is in the United States, they may file a Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. It is only upon the filing of an I-485 that the health care worker certification is required and will be used to determine admissibility for adjustment of status. While the noncitizen worker may receive interim benefits such as a work permit and travel permission with the favorable exercise of discretion, the filing and adjudication of the Form I-485 is dependent upon an immigrant visa number being available and the validity of the underlying visa petition.\n\nIf the noncitizen worker is living outside the United States or living in the United States, but chooses to apply for an immigrant visa abroad, USCIS will send the approved petition to the Department of State’s (DOS) National Visa Center (NVC), where it will remain until an immigrant visa number is available. The noncitizen worker must present the health care certification to the consular officer at the time the visa is issued.\n\nNonimmigrant petitions:\n\nFor nonimmigrant petitions seeking admission, an extension of stay, or a change of status, there are two considerations:\n\nConsideration 1: The petitioner files a Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, or Form I-129CW, Petition for a CNMI-Only Nonimmigrant Transitional Worker, for approval of the noncitizen worker’s classification as a nonimmigrant. In adjudicating the petition for the classification requested, USCIS reviews all eligibility requirements, including licensure, if applicable. The health care certification must be presented at the time of visa issuance or admission (if the noncitizen worker is visa-exempt).\n\nConsideration 2: If the noncitizen is already in the United States, the Form I-129 may also serve as a petition to extend the period of the noncitizen's authorized stay or to change their status. Although the Form I-129 petition classification may be approved, the request for an extension of stay or change of status will be denied if the petitioner fails to submit the health care worker certification required by law. See 8 CFR 212.15(a).\n\nPlease note: USCIS does not accept a health care worker certification as the sole evidence that the foreign worker has met the minimum requirement for the given position and is, therefore, eligible for the requested visa classification. While the health care worker certification verifies the worker’s credentials for admissibility into the United States under INA 212(a)(5)(C), it is not binding on DHS. See 8 CFR 212.15(f)(1)(iii).\n\nUSCIS uses the certification to verify the worker’s credentials for admissibility into the United States. See INA 212(a)(5)(C). Additionally, USCIS must ensure that the health care worker meets educational requirements for the classification and any applicable licensure requirements. In reviewing the worker’s educational documents, USCIS considers the education credential evaluator’s opinion in conjunction with a review of the noncitizen’s relevant education credentials (if submitted), and other available credible material regarding the equivalency of the education credentials to college degrees obtained in the United States.\n\nIn the course of the adjudication, USCIS may refer to educational equivalency resources to clarify an individual’s academic credentials, although information from such sources is not binding. Note that even if it is established s that a bachelor’s degree from the home country of the noncitizen worker represents a level of education that is equivalent to a bachelor's degree in the United States, it is possible that the degree would not qualify the individual for the EB-2 advanced degree category unless they also have five years of post-baccalaureate progressive experience. In such cases, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence asking the petitioner to provide evidence demonstrating that the beneficiary has either a United States advanced degree or foreign equivalent degree or has a United States bachelor’s degree or a foreign equivalent degree, and evidence in the form of letters from current or former employer(s) showing that the beneficiary has at least five years of progressive post-baccalaureate experience in the specialty.\n\nA foreign worker’s certification must be used for any admission into the United States, extension or change of status within the United States, or adjustment of status within five years of the date that it is issued. See 8 CFR 212.15(n)(4). For this reason, the certification is only valid for five years. This ensures that the individual continues to meet the regulatory requirements for issuance of the certification. Therefore, if the foreign worker has not used the certification because they have not been admitted to the United States or adjusted their status within five years of when the certification was obtained, a new certification is required at the time they seek adjustment of status, to change or extend status with USCIS, or when seeking visa issuance by DOS or admission at the port of entry.\n\nPlease note that certification does not remove requirements for licensure, if applicable.\n\nHowever, the credentialing organization must have a formal policy for renewing the certification if an individual’s original certification expires before admission to the United States or application for adjustment of status. See 8 CFR 212.15(k)(4)(viii). The credentialing organization is limited to updating information on licensure to determine the existence of any adverse actions and the need to re-establish English competency, and therefore does not re-evaluate the educational credentials when renewing the certification."
