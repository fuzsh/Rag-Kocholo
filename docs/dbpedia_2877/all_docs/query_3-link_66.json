        "text": "Subscribe to the Department’s YOU Belong in STEM Newsletter Here\n\nYOU Belong in STEM\n\nYOU Belong in STEM is a key component of the Biden-Harris Administration's Raise the Bar: STEM Excellence for All Students initiative designed to strengthen and increase Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education nationwide. This new Biden-Harris Administration initiative will help implement and scale equitable, high-quality STEM education for all students from PreK to higher education—regardless of background— to ensure their 21st century career readiness and global competitiveness. The imitative has three primary goals:\n\nEnsure all students from PreK to higher education excel in rigorous, relevant, and joyful STEM learning;\n\nDevelop and support STEM educators to join, grow, and stay in the STEM education field; and,\n\nInvest in STEM education strategically and sufficiently using federal, state, and local funds.\n\nIn support of the initiative and its goals, the Department:\n\nPublished a STEM Dear Colleague Letter and enclosure to state and district leaders outlining how federal education funds can be used to enhance STEM teaching and learning.\n\nPartnering with EXPLR in hosting the first-ever 2024 National STEM Festival.\n\nPartnered with Women in Aerospace (WIA), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Club for the Future, and the Space Foundation to develop a space communication campaign illustrating the value and benefits of the space enterprise.\n\nPartnered withBeyond100K to identify the key challenges regarding the supply and demand of STEM teachers at the state and local levels.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nBackground\n\nDepartment Offices that Support STEM\n\nExamples of the Department's discretionary grants that can support STEM\n\nGrant Applicant Resources\n\nCall for Peer Reviewers\n\nAmerica's Strategy for STEM Education\n\nSecretary's STEM Priority\n\nSTEM Education Briefings\n\nArchived STEM Briefings\n\nResources\n\nOther Federal Agency STEM Websites\n\nDepartment STEM Contacts\n\nBackground\n\nIn an ever-changing, increasingly complex world, it's more important than ever that our nation's youth are prepared to bring knowledge and skills to solve problems, make sense of information, and know how to gather and evaluate evidence to make decisions. These are the kinds of skills that students develop in science, technology, engineering, and math, including computer science—disciplines collectively known as STEM/CS. If we want a nation where our future leaders, neighbors, and workers can understand and solve some of the complex challenges of today and tomorrow, and to meet the demands of the dynamic and evolving workforce, building students' skills, content knowledge, and literacy in STEM fields is essential. We must also make sure that, no matter where children live, they have access to quality learning environments. A child's zip code should not determine their STEM literacy and educational options.\n\nDepartment Offices that Support STEM\n\nOffice of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development (OPEPD)\n\nOffice of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE)\n\nOffice of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE)\n\nOffice of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS)\n\nOffice of Postsecondary Education (OPE)\n\nOffice of Non-Public Education (ONPE)\n\nOffice of Educational Technology (OET)\n\nOffice of English Language Acquisition (OELA)\n\nInstitute of Educational Sciences (IES)\n\nWhite House Initiatives\n\nFederal Student Aid (FSA)\n\nOffice of Communications and Outreach (OCO)\n\nExamples of the Department's discretionary grants that can support STEM\n\nBelow are investments made in FY 2020:\n\n$3.6 million for the Alaska Native Education Equity Program\n\n$300,000 for Braille training (rehabilitation services demonstrations and training)\n\n$5.1 million for the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP)\n\n$5 million for the Comprehensive Centers Program\n\n$185 million for the Education Innovation and Research Program (EIR) (awarded in early FY 2021)\n\n$124.7 million for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (Partnership Grants) (GEAR-UP)\n\n$23 million for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need\n\n$25 million for Innovative Approaches to Literacy\n\n$5.7 million for the Jacob K.

The Forecast of Funding Opportunities lists virtually all Department discretionary grant programs for FY 2021.\n\nGrant Applicant Resources\n\nThe Department published in spring 2020 two new grant applicant resources. These resources were developed to (1) provide an overview of the discretionary (or competitive) grants application process and (2) offer more details intended to be used by prospective applicants, including new potential grantees. These support one of the Secretary's new administrative priorities on New Potential Grantees that was published in March 2020. They can also be found under the \"Other Grant Information\" on the ED's Grants webpage.\n\nCall for Peer Reviewers\n\nThe Department is seeking peer reviewers for our Fiscal Year 2024 competitive/discretionary grant season, including in the STEM/CS areas (among others). The Federal Register notice spotlights the specific needs of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), the Office of English Language Acquisition (OELA),, the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE), and the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS). The How to Become a Peer Reviewer slide deck provides additional information and next steps.\n\nAmerica's Strategy for STEM Education\n\nThe STEM Education Strategic Plan, Charting a Course for Success: America's Strategy for STEM Education, published in December 2018, sets out a federal strategy for the next five years based on a vision for a future where all Americans will have lifelong access to high-quality STEM education and the United States will be the global leader in STEM literacy, innovation, and employment. It represents an urgent call to action for a nationwide collaboration with learners, families, educators, communities, and employers—a \"North Star\" for the STEM community as it collectively charts a course for the Nation's success. The Department is an active participant in each of the interagency working groups focused on implementation of the Plan.\n\nLearn more about what the Department and other federal agencies are doing to implement the plan in these progress reports:\n\nProgress Reports\n\nOctober 2019\n\nDecember 2020\n\nDecember 2021\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nApril 2024\n\nSecretary's STEM Priority\n\nSecretary Cardona finalized his six priorities for use in agency discretionary grant programs; equitable access to rigorous STEM, including computer science, experiences is noted in Priority 2.
