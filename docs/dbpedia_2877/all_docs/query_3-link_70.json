        "text": "On this page: Recalls | Outbreaks | Resources\n\nRecalls\n\nFind a Recent Recall\n\nWhat is a Food Recall?\n\nA food recall occurs when a food producer takes a product off the market because there is reason to believe that it may cause consumers to become ill. In some situations, government agencies may request or require a food recall. Food recalls may happen for many reasons, including but not limited to:\n\nDiscovery of organisms, including bacteria such as Salmonella or parasites such as Cyclospora.\n\nDiscovery of foreign objects such as broken glass or metal.\n\nDiscovery of a major allergen that does not appear on the product label.\n\nWhat is a Public Health Alert or Safety Alert?\n\nThese alerts are issued to inform the public about potential health risks in food products. These are typically issued in cases where a recall cannot be recommended. For example, a Federal agency may be aware of an outbreak of foodborne illness, but the source has not yet been identified, or illnesses may occur due to improper handling of a particular product and the agency may issue an alert to remind consumers of safe food handling practices.\n\nWhat to Do with a Recalled Product\n\nA food product that has been recalled due to a possible germ contamination or illness, can leave germs around your kitchen and contaminate surfaces, including the drawers and shelves in your refrigerator.\n\nIf you've already prepared a recalled food item in your kitchen or still have it in your refrigerator, it's important to throw out the food and clean your kitchen.\n\nWash all cookware and utensils (including cutting boards) with hot soapy water.\n\nClear off counters and refrigerator drawers and shelves and wash them with hot soapy water.\n\nThen wipe any surfaces, shelves, or drawers and rinse dishes and cookware with a sanitizing solution and let them air dry. You can use a diluted bleach solution (1 TBSP unscented, liquid chlorine bleach in 1 gallon of water).\n\nProducts recalled due to an undeclared allergen may be a risk for anyone in your household with an allergy to that substance. If the product has never been served, throw it away or return it for a refund. If the product has been served, wash with soap and water any surfaces – plates, pots and pans, utensils, and counters – with which the product may have had contact.\n\nLearn more about how to clean your refrigerator because of a food recall.\n\nAdd the Food Safety Recalls Widget to Your Website\n\nUse the recalls widget on your website to notify your users about the latest food safety recalls and alerts. Click on the \"Embed\" button and copy and paste the code in your web page. When new alerts and recalls are issued, the widget will be automatically updated.\n\nOutbreaks\n\nRecent Outbreaks\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posts food safety alerts and investigation notices for multistate foodborne disease outbreaks. Click on the link below for a list of the latest outbreaks.\n\nCDC Multistate Foodborne Disease Outbreaks\n\nWhat Is an Outbreak?\n\nA foodborne outbreak occurs when two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. When an outbreak is detected, public health and regulatory officials work quickly to collect as much information as possible to find out what is causing it so they can take action to prevent more people from getting sick. This action includes warning the public when there is clear and convincing information linking illness to a contaminated food. Federal, state and local officials may investigate an outbreak, depending on how widespread it is.\n\nResources\n\nSeparate government agencies are responsible for protecting different segments of the food supply. Click on an agency's page below to see more information on recalls and outbreaks. Your state or local public health agency may also list state-specific recalls and outbreak alerts on their websites.\n\nCDC Foodborne Outbreaks\n\nFDA Recalls, Outbreaks & Emergencies"
