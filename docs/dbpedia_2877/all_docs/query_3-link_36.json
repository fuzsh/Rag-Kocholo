        "text": "Information on Apostille and Notarial Certificates issued by the Florida Department of StateÂ\n\nForeign embassies or consulates often require an apostille or notarial certificate for vital record certificates. The 1961 Hague Convention established the apostille as a form of authentication for its member states. The apostille certifies the authenticity of the issuing official’s signature. Countries that are nonmembers of the 1961 Hague Convention are issued notarial certificates, which also authenticates the issuing official’s signature. The Florida Secretary of State is the only designated Competent Authority to issue apostilles in the State of Florida.\n\nOBTAINING AN APOSTILLE OR NOTARIAL CERTIFICATE IS A 2-STEP PROCESS THAT INVOLVES BOTH THE FLORIDA BUREAU OF VITAL STATISTICS AND THE FLORIDA DEPARMTENT OF STATE, DIVISION OF CORPORATIONS.\n\nBefore ordering, we urge you to contact the nearest consulate or embassy for the country in which you will be using the apostille or notarial certificate to obtain their requirements for the vital record certificate.\n\nAny person who willfully and knowingly provides any false information on a certificate, record or report required by Chapter 382, Florida Statutes, or on an application or affidavit, or who obtains confidential information from any Vital Record under false or fraudulent purposes, commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in Chapter 775, Florida Statutes.\n\nLINKS TO FORMS:\n\nApostille Birth Application (English)\n\nApostille Death Application (English)\n\nApostille Marriage Application\n\nApostille Single Status Application\n\nApostille Dissolution Application\n\nAffidavit to Release Birth Certificate\n\nAffidavit to Release Death Certificate with Cause of Death\n\nIf you have any questions about obtaining a vital record certificate to be used for the apostille or notarial process, please contact us at 904-359-6900 extension 9006 or e-mail us at: VitalStats@FLHealth.gov."
