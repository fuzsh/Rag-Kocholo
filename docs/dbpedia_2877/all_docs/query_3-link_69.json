        "text": "A. Data collection and sampling\n\nFour FGDs were conducted from 15–24 February 2022 by the HTA Philippines (HTA Council–Joint Subcommittee on Self-Administered Antigen Test and support staff from the HTA Division) via online platforms to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. These included HCWs, at-risk groups, economic frontliners, and employers and managers of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and/or academic institutions. These groups were chosen because they were deemed to have diverse perspectives in health care which can be generalized to the wider context of acceptability in the local health system.\n\nFGD 1: HCWs—Nine participants consisting of one barangay health worker and eight leaders of organizations representing physicians, pharmacists, nurses, caregivers, and dentists were included.\n\nFGD 2: At-risk groups—Seven formal organizations for chronic illnesses, lung diseases, cancer, kidney transplantation, and HIV/AIDS were secured.\n\nFGD 3: Economic frontliners—Six workers composed of a cab driver, a jeepney driver, delivery riders, a fieldworker, and a public school teacher were included in the FGD.\n\nFGD 4: MSMEs and academic institutions—A total of seven representatives were included in the FGD, five of which are managers or administrative officers of an MSME in the field of human resources, air conditioning, pharmaceutical industry, and sugar industry, while there are two decision makers in their respective private schools.\n\nDue to the urgency of the assessment of SAAgT, snowball sampling was used to invite the participants. Some of the participants from previous FGDs conducted by HTA Philippines were invited and/or asked for referrals.\n\nBoth Filipino and English were used as primary media of instruction for the first and last FGDs, while Filipino was the main medium for the second and third FGDs. Each FGD was facilitated by two to three representatives from the HTA Council. FGDs were conducted to have in-depth discussions and exchange of ideas and to observe the patterns of interaction among the participants [Reference Neuman9].\n\nB. Data analysis\n\nThe preset codes were used to register the responses of the participants. All FGD responses were encoded using Google Docs.\n\nIn order to analyze the raw data obtained from FGDs, both open and axial analyses were performed. For the open analysis, the codes were analyzed inductively and subsumed under preset codes that represent key decision points. New codes were included when responses did not fit any of the preset codes. The frequency of codes determined the number of times that participants mentioned or discussed the concept. If a code has been interpreted for at least three times in one FGD, then that code is considered as significant and is included in the analysis. Following the open analysis, axial analysis was performed by clustering first-level codes and recognizing patterns or relationships between the codes to generate themes from the users and implementers.\n\nC. Instrument\n\nA semi-structured questionnaire was created by the HTA Philippines to guide the discussion of the participants’ perspectives, acceptability, and willingness to self-report. See Table 1 for the complete instrument used per FGD. Initial questions were added to capture the baseline knowledge and perception of the participants. The instrument also contained a brief context on SAAgT after every few questions to assess how the level of knowledge can affect their perception. The participants would then be asked whether they will change their previous answers given this new information. Context slides were not presented until after the sixth question. Members of the HTA Council validated the content of the questions and context slides based on the objectives of the FGDs. The tool was tailored to match the interest of subgroups with respect to COVID-19 testing."
