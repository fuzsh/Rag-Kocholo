        "text": "Hello po! Here is a guide in availing the free anti rabies vax here in the capital of the Philippines, Manila's San Lazaro Hospital.\n\nI had come here years before and indeed there was a multitude of people back then. But now due to Covid-19 pandemic, there are way less patients availing the anti-rabies shot for animal bites, scratches.\n\nAs a preventative measure, most city/ provincial vets (in the City Hall) offer free anti-rabies shots for pets. Just bring the animal to their office.\n\nGetting a vaccine is important as this virus is really scary. There are private clinics that offer anti-rabies but they cost a pretty penny. Those who are trying to save choose to go to SLH.\n\nThese are the steps as I can remember. Note that it may change from time to time.\n\nFIRST VISIT\n\n1. Assessment 1 as you enter. Fill up form and get weight taken.\n\n2. Records.\n\n3. Dr tent, interview.\n\n4. Table 2 room, Pharmacy, letter.\n\n5. Cashier.\n\n6. Table 2 room, Pharma, syringe.\n\n7. Assessment area 2. List names, signature, address.\n\n8. Table 2 room, Injection (3 turok? One of the syringe was BIG).\n\nSECOND VISIT\n\n1. Blotter area. Get number.\n\n2. Doctor table, PPRV paper.\n\n3. Assessment 2 (address).\n\n4. Table 2 room, Injection (Both forearms).\n\n*You can always ask the guards and staff about where to next.\n\nFirst visit, it took me about a total of one hour to finish. Succeeding visits were faster.\n\nDuring the third visit, the physician asked where the cat that scratched me was. When I told him that she went missing, he recommended an additional shot, skin test and ERIG. But he took it back when I told him I already got ERIG a couple of years ago. He then allowed me to proceed with the regular shot.\n\nFourth visit, they gave PVRV (2 sites) and toxoid shot (felt heavy), and was advised to return April next year for third tetanus shot (offers 5 years protection).\n\nFEES\n\n1st visit, paid a total of 130 Pesos (I think Php 50 registration fee, then Php 70 for syringes). 2nd and 3rd visit, no payment. 4th visit, I paid Php 37.50 for a big syringe (there was one small syringe left from my first visit).\n\nThe site of injection felt a bit painful, heavy for about 3 days.\n\nImportant is NOT to eat prohibited malansa foods. You can take a bath when you get home.\n\nDo's:\n\nBring face mask and face shield.\n\nBring a fan (pamaypay), food and drinks in case you feel famished. Otherwise, there are many stores you can buy from around the vicinity. There is also free Wi-Fi in the area that kept me entertained.\n\nBring money as this is not entirely zero fee.\n\nLatest you can come is 2 PM because if you arrive at 3:01 it is already past their posted schedule and you will not be allowed inside (usually, there's fewer people in the afternoon than in the morning).\n\nSan Lazaro Hospital is located at the Department of Health Compound, Quiricada St., Sta. Cruz, Manila. If you came from Tayuman LRT, just walk straight southwards Avenida. First you will reach is Kagawaran ng Kalusugan (DOH), then Jose Reyes Hospital. When you reach Quiricada, you will see a fire station. Turn right and there is SLH. Go to the OPD.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis blog post is from my experience, made for the purpose of helping other Filipinos, especially the first timers or those who traveled from provinces just to avail the free anti rabies vaccination from this government hospital. It is not intended to malign anybody. Please contact them directly for more information."
