The goal of these organizations was to create a national voice to advocate for the unique and diverse health needs of AA and NH/PI communities and the community health providers that served those needs.\n\nSince that time, we have advocated for policies and programs that improve the provision of health care services that are community-driven, financially affordable, linguistically accessible, and culturally appropriate.\n\nAdvocacy Work »\n\nAmong other things, we develop, test, and evaluate health education and promotion programs with national significance. We also offer technical assistance and training to promote the establishment and expansion of services for medically underserved AA and NH/PI communities. And lastly, as a unified voice of our membership, we share our collective knowledge and experience with policymakers at the national, state, and local levels. For more on our story, read about our Guiding Principles and Values.\n\nLearn About Our Programs »\n\nAAPCHO’s Board of Directors has a governing role over the organization’s policies and priorities. The Board is comprised of the Executive Director (unless otherwise appointed) of each member organization that holds full membership status with AAPCHO, and a Consumer Advocate At-large. Many of AAPCHO’S Board Members are nationally recognized leaders and have decades of experience delivering primary care services to medically underserved AAs and NH/PIs.
