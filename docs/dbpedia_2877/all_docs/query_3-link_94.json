        "text": "Apostilles and Notary Certifications\n\nApostilles and certifications attest to the legal status of New Jersey Notaries Public and selected public officials, such as Superior Court judges, County Clerks, and the State Registrar of Vital Statistics, who have authenticated or notarized documents to be used in business transactions and/or international document exchange. Public officials for whom our office will issue Apostilles and certifications.\n\nApostilles and certifications issued by the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services are one-page, 8.5 x 11 documents with a color laser print of the Great Seal of the State of New Jersey and the signature of the New Jersey State Treasurer.\n\nWe affix Apostilles and certifications to the signature page of the submitted document with staples. Please do not remove the Apostille or certification once it is attached.\n\nThe Division will provide an Apostille if the transaction involves a country that subscribes to the Hague Convention. If the authenticated or notarized document is going to a country that does not appear on the Hague Convention list, the Division will provide a certification of the public official.\n\nIn all cases involving international document exchange, we recommend that you contact officials in the receiving country or visit the U.S. Department of State website for further information and guidance on the exchange process.\n\nFor additional information on apostilles, \"The ABCs of Apostilles\" brochure provides basic information about the Apostille Convention and the Convention's operation that has been prepared by the Permanent Bureau (Secretariat) of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and is provided with the Permanent Bureau's permission.\n\nHow to Obtain an Apostille or Certification:\n\nObtain the original or certified copy of the document bearing the original notarization or certification by the public official.\n\nImportant Notes: Obtain vital records (birth, marriage, divorce, death, etc.) from January 1, 1923 forward from the NJ Department of Health, Office of Vital Statistics and Registry (609.292.4087). For vital records dated prior to January 1, 1923, contact the New Jersey State Archives. Order a copy of your vital records online.\n\nWe cannot issue Apostilles or certifications for vital records from other states. Have out-of-state records authenticated in the state of origin.\n\nFor documents in languages other than English, we recommend that you attach a notarized English translation. Note that if you attach a notarized translation to a vital record, we will issue two Apostilles/Certifications, and we will assess two fees.\n\nSubmit notarized documents with the original (inked) signature of the NJ Notary Public and the original (inked) signature of the person who presented the document for notarization.\n\nClick on the Order link below to use our online Apostille/Certification Service.
