        "text": "Health Secretary Ted Herbosa is toying with the idea of renaming the Department of Health (DOH) to the Department of Health and Wellness in recognition of its role in public health.\n\nDOH Assistant Secretary Albert Domingo shared Herbosa’s plan in a message to reporters.\n\n“The proposal to rename the Department is a sound idea floated by the Secretary, anchored on a broad understanding of the ultimate goal of public health,” he said.\n\nHerbosa said his renaming proposal takes into account the goal of keeping Filipinos healthy and free of illness.\n\n“Kasi dito sa Universal Health Care, pinu-push naming ang primary care, yung ime-maintain mo yung wellness mo, hindi yung maysakit ka pupunta ka emergency room. So ang idea nito is ma-promote yung being healthy and wealth.Kasi pag wealth tayo, illness lagi ang pinag-iisipan,” he said.\n\nHerbosa clarified that the proposal is still under study since its approval will entail an overhaul of the DOH’s logo, letter head, and emblems on vehicles and buildings.\n\n“Inaaral ko pa rin, baka may benefit pa rin pero ang important maintindihan ng tao na ako sa kagawaran ng kalusugan, yung wellness ma-promote nating sa mga kababayan natin. Hindi enough na wala kang sakit, kailangan healthy ka,” he said."
