        "text": "Category: SEPTEMBER-The SEVEN SORROWS of MARY and The HOLY CROSS\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 1 July – ‘ … While He is judged, Wisdom remains silent and the Word says nothing. …’\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 1 July – “The Feast and Month of the Most Precious Blood” – Hebrews 9:11-15,; John 19:30-35 – Scripture search here: https://www.drbo.org/\n\n“But one of the soldiers opened His side with a lance and immediately there came forth, Blood and water.” – John 19:34\n\nREFLECTION – “Today the Cross is advancing, creation exults. The Cross, path for those who have gone astray, hope of Christians, the Apostles’ preaching, security of the universe, foundation of the Church, fountain for those who are thirsty… In great gentleness, Jesus is led to the Passion – He is brought to Pilate’s judgement seat; at the sixth hour, people mock Him; until the ninth hour, He bears the pain of the nails, then His Death ends His Passion. At the twelfth hour, He is taken down from the Cross. You could say, He is a sleeping lion …\n\nWhile He is judged, Wisdom remains silent and the Word says nothing. His enemies despise and Crucify Him … Those, to whom yesterday, He gave His Body as food, watch from a distance as He dies. Peter, the first of the Apostles, is the first to flee. Andrew also took flight and John, who rested at His side, did not prevent the soldier from piercing that side with a lance. The Twelve fled – they did not say one word in His favour, they, for whom He is giving His Life. Lazarus is not there, he, whom He called back to life. The blind man did not weep for Him Who opened his eyes to the light and the crippled man, who could walk thanks to Him, did not run to Him.\n\nOnly a bandit who was crucified next to Him confessed Him and called Him his King! O thief, precocious blossom from the tree of the Cross, first fruit of the wood from Golgotha! … The Lord reigns, creation rejoices. The Cross triumphs and all nations, tribes, languages and peoples (Apoc 7:9) come to adore Him … The Cross gives Light to the whole universe, it chases away the darkness and gathers the nations … into one single Church, one single Faith, one single Baptism in charity.

Virtues of Christ Crucified\n\nThought for the Day – 23 April – The Spiritual Combat (1589) – Dom Lorenzo Scupoli OSM (c1530-1610)\n\n“None shall be crowned who has not fought well.” 2 Tim 2: 5\n\nLII: … The Benefits derived from Meditations on the Cross\n\nand the Imitation of the Virtues of Christ Crucified\n\n“GREAT are the ADVANTAGES to be derived from meditating on the Cross, the first of which is, not only a detestation of past sins but also, the firm resolution to fight against our ever-present disorderly appetites which, Crucified our Saviour.\n\nThe second advantage is, the forgiveness of sins, obtained from Jesus Crucified and, a wholesome self-contempt which inspires us, forever to forsake offending Him and continually to love and serve Him with all our heart, in acknowledgment of that which He suffered for our sakes.\n\nThe third, is the unceasing labour with which we root out all depraved habits, however trivial they may appear.\n\nThe fourth consists in our ardent efforts to imitate our Divine Master, Who died, not only to expiate our sins but, to bequeath to us, the sublime example of a life of sanctity and perfection.\n\nThe following method of meditation will be highly serviceable, assuming, as I do, that you particularly wish to imitate the patience of your Saviour in carrying your crosses.\n\nConsider well these several points:\n\nWhat the Soul of Christ suffered for God.\n\nWhat God did for the Soul of Jesus.\n\nWhat the Soul of Jesus did, for itself and its Body.\n\nWhat Jesus did for us.\n\nWhat we ought to do for Jesus.\n\nConsider in the first place that the Soul of Jesus engulfed in the ocean of Divinity, contemplated that Infinite and Incomprehensible Being, before Whom, even the most exalted of creatures is utterly insignificant – contemplated, I say, in a state so debased as to suffer the vilest indignities of ungrateful man, without the least diminution of its essential glory and splendour.\n\nAnd from the depths of its suffering, the Soul of Christ adored its Sovereign Majesty, giving it myriad thanks and accepting all for its sake.\n\nBehold, on the other hand, what God bestowed on the Soul of Jesus – consider that the Divine Will decreed the scourgings, spittle, blasphemies, buffetings, crown of thorns, for love of us and the crucifixion which were meted out to Jesus, the Only and Beloved Son of God.\n\nSee with what delight God, knowing the admirable end to which it was all directed, beheld His Divine Son, loaded with infamy and overwhelmed with affliction.\n\nContemplate next, the Soul of Jesus and observe with what alacrity it submitted itself to the Will of God, either because of the immensity of its Divine Perfection, or the Infinity of Divine Favour bestowed upon it.\n\nWho can describe the ardent affection of this Soul for crosses?\n\nThis was a Soul which sought, even new ways of suffering,and failing in this, abandoned itself and the innocent Body to the mercy of miscreants and the powers of Hell.\n\nTurn, then, your eyes to Jesus, Who, from the midst of His Agony, addresses you in this affectionate manner:\n\n“See to what depths of misery I am reduced by thy ungovernable will, which refuses the least constraint in compliance with mine.\n\nBehold the horrible pains I endure, with no other purpose than to teach thee a lesson of patience.\n\nAnd let me persuade you, by all these sufferings, to accept with resignation, this cross I here present and those which I shall send in the future.\n\nSurrender your reputation to calumny and your body to the fury of the persecutors whom I shall choose for your trial, however vile and inhuman they may be.\n\nOh, that you didst know what delight your patience and resignation afford me!\n\nBut then, how can you be ignorant of it, when you behold these wounds received to purchase for you, those virtues with which I would adorn your soul, more dear to me, than life itself?\n\nIf I have suffered this debasement for you, can you not bear a light affliction, in order to lessen My Agony to some degree?\n\nCan you refuse to heal those Wounds, I have received, through your impatience, Wounds more cruel to me than physical anguish?”\n\nConsider who it is who speaks thus to you – consider that it is Jesus Christ, the King of Glory, true God and true Man.\n\nConsider too, the magnitude of His torments and humiliations, greater than that deserved by the most vicious of criminals. Be\n\nastonished to behold Him in the midst of these agonies, not only firm and resolute but even replenished with joy, as if the day of His Passion was a day of triumph.\n\nJust as a few drops of water sprinkled upon a flame, only adds a fresh intensity to its glow, so did His torments, embraced in a charity which made the burden seem light, serve to augment his joy and desire of suffering still greater affliction.\n\nMoreover, reflect that throughout His entire life, He was motivated, not by compulsion or self-interest but rather, by pure love alone that you may learn from Him, the manner of practicing patience.\n\nEndeavour, therefore, to attain a perfect knowledge of what He demands of you and consider His delight at your practice of patience. Then form an ardent desire of carrying this cross and heavier ones, not only with patience but with joy, that you may more exactly imitate Christ Crucified and render yourself more acceptable to Him!\n\nPicture to yourself all the torments and indignities of His Passion and amazed at His constancy, blush at your own weakness.\n\nLook upon your sufferings as merely imaginative, when compared to His and regard your patience as not even the faintest anticipation of His.\n\nDread nothing so much as an unwillingness to suffer for your Saviour, rejecting such unwillingness as a suggestion from Hell.\n\nConsider Jesus on the Cross as you would a devout book, worthy of your unceasing study and, by which you may learn the practice of the most heroic virtues.\n\nThis is the book which may truly be called the “Book of Life” [Apocalypse, III, 5], which, at once enlightens the mind by its doctrines and inflames the will by its examples.\n\nThe world is full of books but were it possible for man to read them all, he would never be so well instructed, to hate vice and embrace virtue, as by contemplating a Crucified God!\n\nBut remember that there are those who spend hours lamenting the Passion of our Lord and admiring His patience and yet, on the first occasion, betray as great an impatience, in suffering, as if they had never thought of the Cross.\n\nSuch men are like untried soldiers, who, in their barracks breathe nothing but conquest but on the first appearance of the enemy, beat\n\na hasty and inglorious retreat!\n\nWhat is more despicable after considering, admiring and extolling the virtues of our Redeemer, than to forget them all, in an instant, when an opportunity of practicing them presents itself!”\n\nDom Lorenzo Scupoli\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 11 April – St

Cist. (c1080-1157)\n\nCistercian Abbot\n\n“When Jesus was going round towns and villages preaching the Gospel, Mary was His inseparable companion, clinging to His footsteps and hanging upon His words, as He taught, so much so, that neither the storm of persecution, nor dread of punishment, could deter her from following her Son and Master.\n\n“By the Lord’s Cross there stood Mary, His Mother.” Truly a Mother, who did not abandon her Son, even in the face of death! How could she be frightened of death, when “her love was as strong as death,” (Sg 8:6) or rather, stronger than death? Truly she stood by Jesus’ Cross, when, at the same time, the pain of the Cross crucified her mind and, as manifold a sword, pierced her own soul, (Lk 2:35) as she beheld the body of her Son, pierced with wounds. Rightly, therefore, was she recognised as His Mother there and by His care, entrusted to a suitable protector, in which both the mother’s unalloyed love for her Son and the Son’s kindness toward His Mother, were proved to the utmost …\n\nLoving her as He did, Jesus “Loved her to the end” (Jn 13:1), so as not only to bring His life to an end, for her but also, to speak almost His last words for her benefit. As His last will and testament, He committed, to His beloved heir, the care of His Mother… The Church fell to Peter, Mary to John. This bequest belonged to John, not only by right of kinship but too, because of the privilege, love had bestowed and the witness, his chastity bore… It was fitting that none other than the beloved of her Son, should minister to the Mother of the Lord… Providence too arranged, very conveniently that he who was to write a Gospel, should have intimate conferences with her, who knew about them all, for she had taken note from the beginning, of everything that happened to her Son and “treasured all the words concerning Him, pondering them in her heart” (Lk 2:19).” – (4th Sermon for the Assumption).\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 22 March – “Woman, behold thy son. … Behold thy mother” – John 19:26\n\nOne Minute Reflection – 22 March – Friday in Passion Week, the Fifth Friday in Lent, Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows – Judith 13:22, 25, John 19:25-27 – Scripture search here: https://www.drbo.org/\n\n“Woman, behold thy son. … Behold thy mother” – John 19:26\n\nREFLECTION – “Mary, the Mother of the Lord, stood by her Son’s Cross. No-one has taught me this but the holy Evangelist John. Others have related how the earth was shaken at the Lord’s Passion, the sky was covered with darkness, the sun withdrew itself and how, the thief was, after a faithful confession, received into paradise. John tells us what the others have not told, how the Lord, while fixed on the Cross called to His Mother. He thought it was more important that, victorious over His sufferings, Jesus gave her the offices of piety, than that He gave her a Heavenly Kingdom. For if it is the mark of religion to grant pardon to the thief, it is a mark of much greater piety, that a mother is honoured with such affection, by her Son. “Behold,” He says, “thy son.” “Behold thy mother.” Christ testified from the Cross and divided the offices of piety, between the mother and the disciple.\n\nNor was Mary below what was becoming the Mother of Christ. When the Apostles fled, she stood at the Cross and with pious eyes beheld her Son’s wounds. For she did not look to the death of her offspring but to the salvation of the world. Or perhaps, because that “royal hall” knew, that the redemption of the world would be through the death of her Son, she thought that by her death, she also might add something to that universal gift. But Jesus did not need a helper, for the redemption of all, Who saved all without a helper. This is why He says, “I am counted among those who go down to the pit. I am like those who have no help.” He received indeed, the affection of His Mother but sought not another’s help. Imitate her, holy mothers, who in her only dearly beloved Son, set forth so great an example of maternal virtue.

For man has departed from the love of God and fallen into sin and, because of this was, I say, excluded from the divine abode of paradise. And when he was weakened by that disaster, he yielded to the devil tempting him to sin and death, following that sin, he became the prey of fierce and ravenous wolves. But after Christ was announced as the True Shepherd of all men, He laid down His life for us (1 John 3:16), fighting for us against that pack of inhuman beasts. He bore the Cross for us that by His own death, He might destroy death. He was condemned for us that He might deliver all of us, from the sentence of punishment – the tyranny of sin being overthrown by our faith -fastening to the Cross, the decree that stood against us, as it is written (Colossians 2:14).\n\nTherefore, as the father of sin had, as it were, shut up the sheep in hell, giving them to death to feed on, as it is written in the Psalms (Ps. 48:16), He died for us, as truly Good and truly our Shepherd, so that the dark shadow of death is driven away, He might join us to the company of the blessed in Heaven and, in exchange for abodes which lie far in the depths of the pit … grants us mansions in His Father’s House above. Because of this, He says to us in another place: Fear not, little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you a Kingdom (Luke 12:32).
