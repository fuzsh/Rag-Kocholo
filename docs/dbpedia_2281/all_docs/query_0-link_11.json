(1898-1944), born in France, served as porter and cellarer in the seminary of LaBrosse-Montceaux.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war most Oblates in France have been convinced that resistance to the Nazi regime was a religious necessity, because of their anti-Christian principals. This deep religious conviction had moved Fr. Piat, the scholastics Cuny and Perrier and some other Oblates at LaBrosse-Montceaux to become involved in “La Compagnie Notre-Dame”, a cell of French underground, which drew people together un the patronage of Our Lady to resist the neopaganism of German National Socialism.

Lorenz back to the army, but as chaplain. In 1940 he was discharged from the army, as were all religious priests of officer rank. On his return to Stettin he found himself, perhaps at first innocently, involved in a group which was becoming more and more to realize and criticize, the growing injustices, crimes and atrocities of the Nazi regime. In February 1943 Fr. Lorenz, along with other 40 people, was arrested. He was endlessly interrogated and beaten. In December 1943 he was transferred to the prison of Halle and proceedings against him started. He was accused of lack of patriotism and of undermining the fighting spirit of German soldiers. Together with two other priests, Fr. Herbert Simoleit (1908-1944), a diocesan priest from Berlin and Mgr. Carl Lampert (1894-1944), the vicar general of Innsbruck, Fr. Lorenz was condemned to death on July 28, 1944. One of the lawyers said: “This is not a case of criminals. Their only tragedy is that they are Catholic priests.” The three priests died by the guillotine in the prison of Halle on November 13, 1944. One of them, Mgr.

On October 24, 1956 Fr. Buliard took the decision to leave his mission only for some hours. He hitched his six dogs to the sled to get some fish out of the net. Shortly after he left a blizzard started. Wind picked up, snow reduced visibility. Fr. Buliard was never seen again. His disappearance remained mysterious. Until 1978 different rumours and theories came up that Fr. Buliard had been murdered. But most probably, that day in October 1956, because of the weather, the dogs went straight ahead, without taking the detour to avoid the undercurrent whish freezes only very late and Fr. Buliard drowned with his dogs sled.\n\nJanuary 22, 1964\n\nIn the Congo (then Zaire) in 1963 a group of young rebels, led by Muhele, were organized to overthrow the government. The acts of sabotage and distraction increased in the country. The Catholic Church was in danger of becoming a special target to some of the group influenced by communist principles. In early January 1964 there were increasing attacks on missions.\n\nIn January 22, 1964 tragedy struck the Oblate mission at Kilembe. About 11.00 pm over 50 armed rebels attacked the mission.

Ménard lying dead amidst a great splattering of blood around the house. He suffered 20 large stab wounds and gashes in his back, and his skull had been smashed in three places. The motive of a ritual murder was suspected. According to a custom, when a person feels lacking in power he kills someone who he regards as a worthy man. Part of the murdered persona, e.g. blood or parts of flesh, are taken and consumed. This is seen as a way to imbibe the spirit, or power, of the murdered person. When Fr. Menard´s body was examined there war found clear evidence that a large quantity of blood had been siphoned off from the body and was missing. Six men were arrested and found guilty of Fr. Ménard´s murder. But the motive of the murder has never established.\n\nMay 25, 1971\n\nFr. Renaud Bouffard O.M.I.

The following night of May 25, 1971, two burglars entered Fr. Bouffard´s bedroom in the first floor by an open window. The third one was holding the ladder. One of them killed Fr.

He started his ministry in the Archdiocese of Cotabato at Esperanza. At this time the continuing trouble between Moslem and Christian groups in the area had flared up again. Elections were due, and there was genuine worry, based on past experience, about irregularities in the election process. A group of Christian leaders of Esperanza, including Fr. Javellana was concerned about the justice of the elections. They prepared a petition to the chairman of the Commission on Elections seeking new procedures to ensure a just result. Fr. Javellana set out on November 3, 1971, with a busload of 12 people to meet the government officials at the airport. The chairman arrived on the 5.00 pm plane, and the group presented their petition.

He was an intelligent man, and he taught his students not only about Christ but also that Christ loved them and did not want them to live under the oppressive military regime that then ruled Bolivia. In 1971 in La Paz there was a coup against the government. On August 21, 1971 Fr. Lafèbvre was supportive of the resistance of the coup and volunteered to drive into a zone of street battles to take out the wounded. He drove his van clearly marked as Red Cross, but as he wound through the streets he was fired on. Fr. Lefèbvre, on his mission of mercy, was not killed instantly. The troops surrounded the ambulance as he bled to death and permitted no one to come to rescue him. It took him three hours to die on the street, and he forgave those who had shot him before he finally died.\n\nDecember 23, 1976\n\nFr. Raynald Beauregard O.M.I.

Beauregard heard a knock at the outer door. Thinking the people outside were latecomers he opened the door and three men burst in. One man covered him with a revolver and the other two brandished knives. They demanded money, overpowered Fr. Beauregard and tied his hands and feet. Then they began the savage beating and stabbing. This ended only when they though him to be dead. Leaving Fr. Beauregard on the floor, they ransacked office and bedroom until they found little money. They departed after midnight. After Holy Family sisters had found the wounded victim and organized immediately to take Fr. Beauregard to the hospital in Roma / Lesotho. It took about 20 hours to arrive there. Shortly after his arrival at the hospital Fr. Beauregard died. Before he died, he said that he forgave those, his own parishioners, who had attacked and killed him. Until today it is not clear if the motive of murder was robbery. In fact, some of his new converts, his own parishioners who had not yet understood the new life given by Christ, killed Fr. Beauregard. They admired his great physical strength and thought they would share in it if they killed him.\n\nNovember 10, 1987\n\nFr. Michael Rodrigo O.M.I.

Together with Buddhist monks and lay people he worked towards bettering the lot of the peasants, awakening the poor to a consciousness of their worth and the possibility of growth. Fr. Michael Rodrigo shared his experience of “religious dialogue a village level” at many international conferences in Seoul, Bangkok, Ottawa and San Francisco. Much appreciated by the farming community of Buttala, his work no doubt provoked enmity among others. He had been threatened several times. He was assassinated while celebrating an evening Mass in his little chapel on November 10, 1987. From a window behind the altar, an unknown gunman shot him dead at point-blank range.\n\nBibliography: https://www.omiworld.org/wp-content/uploads/Bibliography-on-Fr.-Michael-Rodrigo.pdf\n\nSeptember 3, 1991,\n\nMons.
