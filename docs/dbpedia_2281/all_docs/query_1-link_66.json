        "text": "It is a story of a simple, hardworking people who sacrificed for what they believed. It is a story of dedicated priests who loved the people given over to their care. It is a story of hope in the midst of challenge. It is a story of faith passed on from one generation to another.\n\nThroughout the last one hundred years, countless numbers of faithful have walked through these holy doors to encounter the very presence of the one, true, living God within this holy temple. Countless echoes of praises have sounded within these walls as the sacramental presence of Christ has animated the hearts and souls of all who have entered our doors. We have responded to the mission given us: to take what we received here to the world!\n\nThe founding members of this parish family, led by Father Francisco Jose Constantino Flores, gathered more than one hundred years ago to begin a journey of faith. Their dream of creating a worshipping community has continued throughout the last century and into the present one. One hundred years later, it is our ardent task to continue building on their dream. As we face new challenges and opportunities, our mission is the same: to make the presence of Christ known in the lives of those who worship here. The presence of our founding fathers remains tangible as they worship together with us this day in the heavenly Eucharistic Feast.\n\nThe many sacrifices of those who have gone before us are not forgotten. Their memories are cherished in the midst of this community. Our journey, our story, is one of determination, one of struggle, one of perseverance. But, most of all, our journey has been, and will continue to be, one of faith, hope and love.\n\nIn the late 1890’s, the City of Fall River, Massachusetts, along the banks of the Taunton River, became the home to many people who left their native Azorean islands in Portugal in time of extreme poverty to seek a new life and new opportunities. As they made the journey across the Atlantic, they brought with them a culture which cannot die. As they journeyed to a new land, many fears and apprehensions must have filled every fiber of their being. At the same time, new opportunities were their driving force. On the many voyages between the Azores and their new land of America, their faith in Jesus Christ and in his gospel was transported with them. They were missionaries, bringing a deep faith to their new land.\n\nThe first Portuguese Catholic community in all of North America was founded in 1872 in the whaling city of New Bedford, Massachusetts. Shortly after, priests from Saint John the Baptist Parish would pack their bags and travel on the weekends to Fall River, as the Mission of Saint Anthony, later to become the Parish of Santo Cristo dos Milagres, came into being on Columbia Street in the center of the city. Often coming to Fall River from New Bedford was the legendary Father Manuel C. Terra, a young, vibrant, colorful priest known for his missionary work throughout the area and for his zealous preaching of the gospel. Father Terra was born in New Bedford of Azorean parents, and attended seminary in Boston, so his experience, knowledge and understanding of both cultures must have made the transition for his parishioners an easy one. The first Portuguese faith community in Fall River was born in 1892 – Santo Christo Parish.\n\nIn the 1890’s, many Portuguese immigrants settled in the Bowenville neighborhood in Fall River’s north end. Families would make the trek on foot each Sunday to Santo Christo Church on for the celebration of the Sunday Eucharist despite even the most harsh weather conditions. Within time, their desire to build a church of their own and hopefully a parish community in Bowenville, was at the forefront of their concerns. Little did they know, that with great determination and faith, their dream was soon to become a reality!\n\nIn 1896, we were part of the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island. Father Candido d’Avila Martins was the pastor of Santo Christo. He listened with great concern to the needs of his parishioners and presented Bishop Matthew Harkins of Providence with their request for a new church. Under the leadership of Father Martins, a basement church was constructed and the cornerstone was blessed by Bishop Harkins on May 30, 1896. This “mission” Church is the lower half of our current church. It was a long building with a flat wooden roof. The upper extension was added in 1922.\n\nDuring the years of 1896 and 1902, the priests from Santo Christo would travel to the new mission church of Saint Michael to celebrate Mass and to administer the sacraments. In 1898, Father Martins resigned as Pastor of Santo Christo due to a lack of administrative ability and died shortly after on November 17, 1898. Bishop Harkins then assigned Father Francisco Silveira Mesquita, a native of the island of Pico in the Azores, and assistant at Saint John the Baptist in New Bedford, as the new Pastor of Santo Christo Parish. With his new assignment, Fr. Mesquita was also responsible for the mission in the north end.\n\nIn the winter of 1898, Father Mesquita and his assistant, Father da Rosa stopped using the basement church at celebrated Mass for the Portuguese community at Saint Mathieu Church at the corner of Saint Mary and Wellington Streets, our neighboring parish.\n\nIn January 1902, Father Mesquita sent his annual report to Bishop Harkins explaining to him that conditions had improved at Santo Christo Parish and Mesquita suggested that Saint Michael Mission become a separate parish. Thus, we were set apart from our “mother” church and became our own parish!\n\nOn February 28, 1902, Rev. Francisco Jose Constantino Flores, assistant at Santo Christo, was named the first pastor of Saint Michael Parish. The first baptism was recorded on March 09, 1902 of Virginia Camara.\n\nFather Flores was born in 1862 in the island of Flores in the Azorean archipelago. He was ordained in Angra, Terceira in 1886. He served in parishes in the Azores until 1889 when he came to the United States. He served for one month in New Bedford, 2 months in Provicetown before coming to Santo Christo.\n\nAs the first pastor of Saint Michael Parish, his congregation numbered 1,800. When he arrived on Essex Street, he found that there was no rectory for him to live in. Flores petitioned Bishop Harkins for permission to build a rectory and the new house, which still serves as our parish rectory, was ready for occupancy on December 04, 1902. Father Flores only lived in the new house for one day. He was stricken with appendicitis on December 05 and died two days later at the age of forty. He only served as Pastor for a short ten months. His parishioners were heart-broken.\n\nReplacing Fr. Borges was Fr. John de Fontes Ferraz, a competent leader and a priest with insight and vision. Fr. Ferraz was born in Ponta Delgada, St. Michael, Azores on January 08, 1880, son of Joao and Joanna (Correia) Ferraz. He was ordained on January 18, 1903 and served in the Azores and was a well known teacher. Fr. Ferraz came to this country in 1911 and served at Espirito Santo Parish before becoming pastor of Saint Elizabeth of Portugal Parish on Tucker Street in 1915, constructing the new church. On January 26, 1917, Father Ferraz was named pastor of Saint Michael Parish.\n\nAn immediate concern of Fr. Ferraz was the construction of the Church. Within a short time, it was determined that instead of constructing a new church building, it was much more feasible to add upward to the exisiting basement church. In October 1921, work began on the construction of the Church and was completed in the Fall of 1922. The church of gothic style with Spanish accents was dedicated on December 03, 1922. The construction was completed by the Charles Hodgate Company of Boston.\n\nDuring this period, Fr. Ferraz was asked to officially begin to serve the people of Assonet who had no parish of their own. Fr. Ferraz, in addition to his responsibilities here, would travel up North Main Street to celebrate Mass and the Sacraments in parishioner’s homes. Our baptism register shows evidence of many Portuguese children, as well as children with English surnames, among the newly baptized. Due to the leadership of Fr. Ferraz, Saint Bernard Parish was finally established in Assonet and a new pastor was named there. In the early years of the parish, our priests were also responsible for celebrating Mass for the Portuguese community of Saint Peter Parish in Dighton.\n\nIn the late 1920’s, it was a concern of Fr. Ferraz to minister to the Portuguese community across the river in Somerset. After consultation with the Bishop, the beloved Fr. Augusto Leal Furtado, parochial vicar at our parish, was sent to Somerset as the first pastor to establish a new community. Young, vibrant and filled with energy, Fr. Furtado worked to gather a community and, in 1928, the parish of Saint John of God was founded under the patronage of Saint Michael Parish. Fr. Furtado would serve that parish for the rest of his life.\n\nUpon completion of the Church, Fr. Ferraz’s dream for a parish school began. His main concern was that of providing a Catholic education for his young parishioners. His vision and leadership led him to purchase the Fulton Street School from the City of Fall River in 1930. He employed the assistance of the Holy Union Sisters and the first classes began on September 8, 1931. Read the Wednesday, September 02, 1931 Fall River Herald News article of the 09/08/1931 opening of St. Michael School.In 1934, the Lindsey St. School (the current site of Michael’s Provisions) was donated to the parish and became our “second” school building.\n\nOn December 9, 1936, Fr. Ferraz was named a Monsignor by Pope Pius XI and for many years served as a diocesan consultor and defender of the bond at the Diocesan Marriage Tribunal. Msgr. Ferraz continued to work tirelessly for our parish and school. Much of his pastorate here was plagued by financial hardship but he always showed great dedication to the poor. Parishioners tell the story of how Msgr. Ferraz’s mother and sisters would prepare sandwiches for the poor, especially the mill workers, and they would distribute them at the door of the rectory. Failing health began to restrict his abilities to function as he once did. Nonetheless, Msgr. Ferraz could still be found each day walking to each of the three school buildings.\n\nMsgr. John F. Ferraz died on All Saints Day, November 1, 1944 at the age of 64 while consoling a parishioner in the front office of the rectory. His funeral Mass was celebrated by Bishop Cassidy here in our Church and he is buried in a family plot at Saint Patrick Cemetery, Fall River.\n\nDuring this time, the parish was still growing in numbers but was still plagued by financial difficulty. The church was leaking and was in need of many repairs, but the money was limited. In 1944, Fr. Augusto Leal Furtado, Pastor of St. John of God Parish in Somerset was appointed as our new pastor. It was difficult for Fr. Furtado to leave behind the close-knit that he began in Somerset. The seeds that he planted there are still evident today. Fr. Furtado was overwhelmed by the challenges he encountered here at Saint Michael Parish, especially the financial situation, and was sent back to Somerset after only six months as our pastor.\n\nAt that time, our parish was experiencing great financial difficulties and something needed to be done. Fr. Joseph M. Silvia was named pastor, replacing Fr. Furtado in 1944. Father Silvia was born in the Azores in 1899 and came to this country as a young child. He was ordained at Saint Mary Cathedral in 1926 and served at Saint John the Baptist in New Bedford before becoming pastor of Saint Elizabeth in Fall River. Father Silvia came into our parish from Saint Elizabeth Parish determined to get the parish on its feet again. Father Silvia, as noted in the parish bulletins, was concerned not only with securing the financial stability of the parish, but in the spiritual growth and formation of the whole parish family. He continually stressed the importance of Sunday worship and the faith formation of parish youth. During the pastorate of Fr. Silvia, parish societies thrived: Saint Vincent de Paul, Holy Name Society, Children of Mary and Holy Rosary. Father Silvia was assisted for many years by Fr. George E. Amaral and Fr. Ernesto do Rego Borges who is still living and is retired in the Azores.\n\nUpon Cardinal Medeiros’ appointment as Bishop, the parish received a new Pastor in the person of Monsignor Luiz G. Mendonca. Monsignor was our first and only American-born Pastor. Born in New Bedford in 1919, Monsignor prepared for the Priesthood in the United States and also in the Azores. A distinguished and scholarly priest, Monsignor Mendonca worked for the revitalization of the parish community.\n\nA new wave of immigration began and Fr. Luciano Pereira came to Saint Michael Parish and established a bilingual school and night classes for up to 500 students to help the newly arrived to become citizens of their new country. Fr. Pereira also became involved in the Fall River School System and developed the ESL Program. The work of this young priest is still remembered today in the hearts of all those whom he helped through his social ministry, especially the immigrant youth. In the parish, Fr. Pereira began a Faith Formation Program for youth which was viewed as a model program for the diocese.\n\nMsgr. Mendonca was responsible for implementing the liturgical changes of Vatican II in the life of our parish. In 1968, our parish welcomed our first and only transitional deacon, John A. Gomes, as he prepared for priesthood ordination in May of 1969. Fr. Gomes is currently Pastor of Annunciaton of the Lord Parish in Taunton.\n\nMonsignor Mendonca only served our parish for three years. In 1969 he became Pastor of Saint John of God Parish in Somerset and served his final years as Pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish in New Bedford. He died in February 1997.\n\nFather Edward Correia was born on July 6, 1942 in New Bedford, MA and grew up in Immaculate Conception Parish. In high school, he became a member of Saint John the Baptist Parish in New Bedford. Father knew he had a priestly vocation as early as the second grade. After high school he entered Saint Thomas the Apostle Seminary in Bloomfield, CT for his first two years of college, then transferred to Saint John Seminary in Brighton, MA for his last two years of college and for his four years of theology. Father Correia was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Fall River by Bishop James L. Connolly on May 18, 1968 in Saint Mary’s Cathedral.\n\nHis first assignment was to Our Lady of Victory in Centerville which lasted only a few months (June-October 1968). He spent the next eight months on Martha’s Vineyard (October 1968-May 1969) only to return to Centerville to serve there until October of 1972. His next assignments brought him to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, New Bedford (1972-1977) and Saint Anthony of Padua, Fall River (1977-1982). From 1982-1986, he served as Chaplain of Saint Luke’s Hospital in New Bedford, while residing at Saint John the Baptist Church.\n\nHe was named Pastor of Saint Bernard Parish of Assonet in 1986, serving there until 1991. He was subsequently named Pastor of Saint Anthony of Padua in Fall River (1991-1993), Saint James in New Bedford (1993-2004), and Saint Francis of Assisi in Swansea (formerly Saint Michael Parish, Swansea, MA 2004-2006). In June 2006, Father Correia became the Pastor of Saint Michael Parish in Fall River and was named Diocesan Director of Vocations effective August 18, 2004 until June 2007. As of June 2011, Father Correia was appointed as Pastor of St. Joseph Parish, Fall River, MA while still remaining Pastor of St. Michael Parish. Fr. Ed Correia retired from his Pastoral duties on June 25, 2013.\n\nFather Jay Mello, S.T.L., was named Parochial Administrator on January 12, 2015 by Bishop Edgar da Cunha. Fr. Jay was born in Fall River on February 29, 1980. He was a parishioner at Sts. Peter and Paul school and attended the parish school. He graduated from Diman Regional Vocation Technical High School in 1998 from the culinary arts program. Fr. Jay was inducted into the High School’s Hall of Fame in 2014. He attend the Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio, graduating in 2003 with a bachelor degrees in Philosophy and Theology and Religious Education. After graduation from the university, Fr. Jay was assigned to the Pontifical North American College in Rome for seminary formation. He attended the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and earned a Sacred Theological Baccalaureate.\n\nOn July 7, 2007 Fr. Jay was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop George Coleman at St. Mary’s Cathedral. He was then assigned to return to Rome for continued studies where he earned a Sacred Theological Licentiate from the Gregorian University. In 2008, he was assigned to be the Parochial Vicar at St. Julie Billiart Parish and chaplain of Bishop Stang High School in North Dartmouth. In 2010, he was assigned to St. Patrick’s Parish in Falmouth. In 2011, Fr. Jay was made the assistant Vocation Director for the Diocese of Fall River. In 2012, he was assigned to be the parochial vicar at St. Mary’s Parish in Mansfield. In 2014, he was assigned to be the temporary parochial administrator of Our Lady of Fatima Parish in New Bedford. In January of 2015, he was made the Parochial Administrator of St. Michael’s and St. Joseph’s parishes in the city of Fall River. Father Jay Mello was installed as Pastor of St. Michael and St. Joseph Parishes on April 12, 2016."
