        "text": "20 August • yesterday\n\n• tomorrow Memorial of Saint Bernard, Abbot and Doctor of the Church In the light of the Divine Goodness, it seems to me, though others may think differently, that ingratitude is the most abominable of sins and that it should be detested in the sight of our Creator and Lord by all of His creatures who are capable of enjoying His divine and everlasting glory. It is a forgetting of the graces, benefits, and blessings received, and as such it is the cause, beginning, and origin of all sins and misfortunes. Contrariwise, the grateful acknowledgment of blessings and gifts received is loved and esteemed both in heaven and on earth. - Saint Ignatius of Loyola Daily Bread #4, by Father Richard Waldo Sibthorp Mary: The Perfect Woman, Rhythm II - The Second Eve\n\nSaint Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nAlso known as\n\n• Mellifluous Doctor of the Church\n\n• Last of the Fathers of the Holy Church\n\nProfile\n\nBorn to the French nobility; brother of Saint Humbeline. At age 22, fearing the ways of the world, he, four of his brothers, and 25 friends joined the abbey of Citeaux; his father and another brother joined soon after. Benedictine. Founded and led the monastery of Clairvaux which soon had over 700 monks and eventually 160 daughter houses. Revised and reformed the Cistercians. Advisor to, and admonisher of, King Louis the Fat and King Louis the Young. Attended the Second Lateran Council. Fought Albigensianism. Helped end the schism of anti-Pope Anacletus II. Preached in France, Italy, and Germany. Helped organize the Second Crusade. Friend and biographer of Saint Malachy O'More. Spritual advisor to Pope Eugene III, who had originally been one of his monks. First Cistercian monk placed on the calendar of saints. Proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius VIII.\n\nEvery morning Bernard would ask himself, \"Why have I come here?\", and then remind himself of his main duty - to lead a holy life.\n\nBorn\n\n1090 at Fontaines-les-Dijon, Burgundy, France\n\nDied\n\n20 August 1153 at Clairvaux Abbey, Ville-sous-la-Ferté, Aube, France\n\nCanonized\n\n1170 by Pope Alexander III\n\nPatronage\n\n• beekeepers\n\n• bees\n\n• Burgundy, France\n\n• candlemakers\n\n• chandlers\n\n• Cistercian Order\n\n• Cistercians\n\n• Gibraltar\n\n• Knights Templar\n\n• Queens College, Cambridge, England\n\n• Speyer Cathedral\n\n• wax-melters\n\n• wax refiners\n\nRepresentation\n\n• beehive\n\n• bees\n\n• book\n\n• Cistercian having a vision of Mary\n\n• Cistercian with a beehive\n\n• Cistercian with a chained demon\n\n• Cistercian with a mitre on the ground beside him\n\n• Cistercian with a swarm of bees nearby\n\n• Cistercian with a white dog\n\n• Cistercian writing and watching Mary\n\n• instruments of the Passion\n\n• pen\n\n• white dog\n\n• with Saint Humbeline\n\nVideo\n\nYouTube PlayList\n\nWritings\n\n• On Loving God - read online or download the EPub\n\nReadings\n\nIn dangers, in doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name depart from your lips, never suffer it to leave your heart. And that you may obtain the assistance of her prayer, neglect not to walk in her footsteps. With her for guide, you shall never go astray; while invoking her, you shall never lose heart; so long as she is in your mind, you are safe from deception; while she holds your hand, you cannot fall; under her protection you have nothing to fear; if she walks before you, you shall not grow weary; if she shows you favor, you shall reach the goal. - Saint Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nLove is sufficient of itself; it gives pleasure by itself and because of itself. It is its own merit, its own reward. Love looks for no cause outside itself, no effect beyond itself. Its profit lies in the practice. Of all the movements, sensations and feelings of the soul, love is the only one in which the creature can respond to the Creator and make some sort of similar return however unequal though it be. For when God loves, all he desires is to be loved in return. The sole purpose of his love is to be loved, int he knowledge that those who love him are made happy by their love of him. - from a sermon by Saint Bernard\n\nLook at that clever calumniator! He begins by fetching a deep sigh, he affects to be humble, and puts on a modest look, and with a voice choking with sobs tries to gloss over the slander which is on the tip of his tongue One would fancy that he expressly assumed a calm and easy demeanor; for when he speaks against his brother, it is in a tender and compassionate tone. I am really hurt, says he, to find that our brother has fallen into such a sin; you all know how much I love him, and how often I have tried to correct him. It is not today that I have noticed his failing; for I should always be on my guard to speak of others, but others have spoken of it too. It would be in vain to disguise the fact; it is only too true, and with tears in my eyes I tell it to you. This poor unfortunate brother has talent, but it must be confessed that he is very guilty, and however great may be our friendship for him, it is impossible to excuse him. - Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, 24th sermon on the Canticles\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-bernard-of-clairvaux/\n\nBlessed Teofilius Matulionis\n\nProfile\n\nThe middle of three brothers born to the peasant family of Jurgis Matulionis and Ona Juocepyte; after his mother died, his father re-married, and the couple then had seven more children. Teofilius studied at Antaliepte, Lithuania from 1887 to 1892, then Dvinsk (modern Daugpilis, Latvia) from 1892 to 1900, and then at the seminary in Saint Petersburg, Russia; he could speak Russian, Latvian and Polish. At one point he questioned his vocation, left seminary, and supported himself by teaching, but later returned to seminary. Ordained a priest of the diocese of Mohilev, Belarus on 17 March 1900.\n\nHe assisted briefly in several parishes in Latvia, and on 26 June 1900 was assigned to Latgalia, Latvia. From 1910 to 1929 he was assigned to the parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Saint Petersburg, an area where Catholics were a distinct minority, and where they came under increased persecution following the Communist takeover of Russia. The Bolsheviks confiscated all churches in 1922. Father Teofilius was imprisoned from 1923 to 1925 for failure to cooperate with the Soviets in the persecution of Archbishop Jan Cieplak.\n\nChosen Auxiliary Bishop of Mohilev, Belarus and Titular Bishop of Matrega by Pope Pius XI on 8 December 1928, he was consecrated in secret on 7 February 1929. On 24 November 1929 he was arrested and sentenced to hard labour in a prison camp north of Arctic Circle for the crime of having had contact with people outside the Soviet Union. In prison he would often get up in the middle of the night to celebrate Mass in secret, distributing the Eucharist to other prisoners when possible. The privations of the prison broke his health; Father Teofilius was re-located to solitary confinement in a prison in Saint Ptersburg and finally turned over to Lithuania as part of a prisoner exchange.\n\nChosen Archbishop of Kaisiadorys, Lithuania on 9 January 1943 by Pope Pius XII. In 1946 he released a pastoral letter to his diocese; the Soviet authorities imprisoned him for ten years for actively practising his vocation. Released in 1956, he was placed under house arrest in Birstonas, Lithuania to prevent his returning to active work as a bishop. On 25 December 1957 Matulionis consecrated Vincentas Sladkevicius a bishop without the consent of the Communists. The authorities mocked him for celebrating the consecration is his kitchen; Matuliones shamed them for forcing him to such a reduced state. For his disobediance, the Communists exiled him to Seduva, Lithuania for the rest of his life. Martyr.\n\nBorn\n\n22 June 1873 in Alantos, Moletai, Russian Empire (in modern Lithuania)\n\nDied\n\n• during a routine search of his apartment by Soviet authorities, he was given an injection by a KGB nurse and dropped dead on 20 August 1962 in Seduva, Radviliskis, Lithuania\n\n• his body was exhumed and autopsied in 1999; tests indicated that he had been poisoned\n\n• interred in the crypt of the Transfiguration Cathedral of Kaisiadorys, Kaisiadorys, Kaisiadorys District Municipality, Kaunas, Lithuania\n\nBeatified\n\n• 25 June 2017 by Pope Francis\n\n• beatification celebrated at the square of the Cathedral Basilica of Sventasis Stanislovas ir Sventasis Vladislovas, Vilnius, Lithuania, presided by Cardinal Angelo Amato\n\n• it was the first beatification celebrated in Lithuania\n\n• it was the first beatification of a Lithuanian martyred by Communists\n\nReadings\n\nYou are a martyr. It is you who must bless me. â Pope Pius XI during an audience in the Vatican on 24 March 1934\n\nIt is an honor to the Lithuanian nation to have such a hero. â Pope Pius XI\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/blessed-teofilius-matulionis/\n\nSaint Maria de Mattias\n\nProfile\n\nBorn to a pious and educated upper class family. Though women of her day were forbidden a formal education, she learned to read and write, and much about her faith at home from her father. Being an upper class girl of the time, she grew up isolated and self-involved, but in her mid-teens she felt the hollowness of her life, and began to search for more meaning. She prayed for enlightment and received a mystical vision that led her to leave home and wander the roads, explaining the love of God to any who would listen.\n\nAt age 17 she attended a mission preached by Saint Gaspare de Bufalo, and saw the obvious changes to people who attended. She wanted to have the same effect, and with the aid of Venerable Giovanni Merlini she founded the Congregation of the Sisters Adorers of the Blood of Christ in Acuto, Italy on 4 March 1834, a woman's congregation for teaching girls. She expanded their work to teaching and catechizing women and boys. Though, due to the social mores of the time she was not allowed to speak to men, they would often gather on their own, sometimes in hiding, to listen to her teaching. Pope Pius IX assigned her to running the San Luigi Hospice in Rome, and from there she worked to expand the Adorers. The congregation experienced occasional opposition from the clergy, but always support from the laity; they ran 70 schools by Mary's death, most in small isolated towns, and over 400 by her beatification.\n\nBorn\n\n4 February 1805 at Vallecorsa, Frosinone, Papal States (modern Italy)\n\nDied\n\n• 20 August 1866 in Rome, Italy of natural causes\n\n• buried in the Verano cemetery, Rome\n\n• relics venerated in Rome at the Church of the Precious Blood\n\nCanonized\n\n18 May 2003 by Pope John Paul II at Vatican Basilica\n\nReadings\n\nO God, through the Congregation founded by Your servant Blessed Mary de Matthias, many young people come into contact with Your love and divine presence. Through her intercession, may we always care for the salvation of the young and teach them the joy of Your Sacramental presence in their lives. This we ask through Christ our Lord. Amen. - from Lives of the Saints II\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-maria-de-mattias/\n\nSaint Zacchaeus the Publican\n\nAlso known as\n\nZaccheo\n\nAdditional Memorials\n\n• 20 April (Coptic calendar)\n\n• 32nd Sunday after Pentecost (Byzantine calendar)\n\n• 27 August (Martyrology of Rabban Sliba)\n\nProfile\n\nMentioned in Gospel of Luke as the short tax collector who climbed a tree in order to see Jesus because he couldn't see over the crowd. Jesus decided to go to the man's house, and when the locals grumbled that Christ was friendly with sinners, Zacchaeus showed his conversion by making retribution to any he had harmed, and by giving largely to charity.\n\nSince that's all we actually know, many legends have grown around him, including that he married Saint Veronica, that he became bishop of Caesarea in Palestine, and that he is Saint Amadour who was an early hermit in France.\n\nPatronage\n\ninnkeepers (the word publican formerly meant a collector of taxes from the public; in English it later meant the proprietor of a public house, pub or inn\n\nVideo\n\nYouTube PlayList\n\nReading\n\nNow a man there (Jericho) named Zacchaeus, who was a chief tax collector and also a wealthy man, was seeking to see who Jesus was; but he could not see him because of the crowd, for he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus, who was about to pass that way. When he reached the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your house.\" And he came down quickly and received him with joy.\n\nWhen they all saw this, they began to grumble, saying, \"He has gone to stay at the house of a sinner.\"\n\nBut Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, \"Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.\"\n\nAnd Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham. For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.\" - Luke 19:2-10\n\nhttps://catholicsaints.info/saint-zacchaeus-the-publican/\n\nSaint Oswine of Deira\n\nAlso known as\n\nOsuine, Oswin\n\nProfile\n\nBorn a prince, the son of King Osric of Deira in Britain.
