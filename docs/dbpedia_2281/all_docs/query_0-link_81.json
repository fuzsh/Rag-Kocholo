For the past forty-three years Mrs. Hagenah had lived in the home on South Walnut street, a conscientious, christian life, supplying the comforts and pleasures of home to her loved ones, rendering many acts of assistance to friends and neighbors in time of sickness and need, in a word acquitting herself of her duties to family and to society in a noble, unselfish manner. Her illness had been of long standing and yet throughout it all she was a patient sufferer, accepting with remarkable fortitude and resignation the burden she was clled upon to bear. Throughout the last weeks of her illness her daughter, Miss Esther, was her constant companion and attendant. Four sons and two daughters survive. They are: Mrs. H. W. Verthein, Delavan; A. H. and A. A. Hagenah, of Chicago; R. E. Hagenah, New York; Hugo Hagenah and Miss Esther of this city. All were present for the funeral services with the exception of R. E. Hagenah.

From the Reedsburg (Sauk Co, WI) Free Press November 5, 1931: Former Ironton Lady Dies In California The following obituary of a former Ironton resident was published in the Whittier News of Whittier, Calif. under date of October 22nd. Funeral services for the late Mrs. S. B. Horine were held yesterday afternoon at the White-Emerson Funeral Parlors, conducted by the Rev. Ernest E. Day, pastor of the Plymouth Congregational Church. Mrs. Jack Bliss and Mrs. Stauss, accompanied by Mrs. Winifred Folgleman Lawrence sang \"He Leadeth Me\", and \"Sweet Peace the Gift of God's Love\" and Mrs. Strauss sang \"Safe in the Arms of Jesus.\" Interment was made at the Rose Hills Cemetery. Pallbearers were A.C. Coleman, A.D. Holloway, E.J. Sharpless, B.A. Smith, E.T. Stoddard and F. N. Velzy. Lillie May Beeson was born September 21, 1866 near Ironton, Wisconsin, and died October 19, 1931, at Anaheim Hospital. In the year 1854 Meredith and Melinda Mason-Beeson moved with other Quakers, by covered wagon, from Hamilton county, Indiana, to the picturesque forest-clad hills of the Little Baraboo Valley, near Ironton, Wisconsin, where there was a Quaker settlement. Here they builded a home and reared a family of seven children, four having died in infancy. Lillie was next to the youngest. She was educated in the public schools and the Sunday School of that community, and by quiet Christian parents, and under good influence, a favorite among her young friends. She united with the Wesleyan Methodist Church, to which her parents adhered. On October 27, 1887, she was united in marriage to Stephen D. Horine, a prospective minister of that pioneer place, who preceded her to the better land February 9, 1931. After their marriage they did pastrol work for three years in the suburbs of Chicago, where he later attended and was graduated from the Chicago Theological Seminary and was called to the pastorate of the Congregational Church at Ogden, Iowa. Here in 1896, Rev. S.D. Horine was stricken with that strange paralytic ailment which rendered him an invalid for practically the remainder of his life, the last twelve years of which he was helpless on his bed. In 1901 the family came to Whittier where relatives and friends had sought health and prosperity. Here, a pioneer, with little means, an invalid husband and young children, Lillie Horine faced life bravely, courageously trusting in God and willing to do her whole part. She sacrificed all on the altar of love to God and her family and friends, never thinking of herself apart from devoted service to others. Since the death of her husband eight months ago, she has been visiting a part of the time with her living children, all married and much attached to their mother, welcoming her at all times. Her Christian faith was shown in her daily life of which her children say \"Nothing to too good to say about our dear mother, who was the best friend we ever had.\" Her shrine was always the invalid husband's chamber, always so neat, clean and cheerful with flowers, bright decorations and sunshine. Yet occasionally she arranged to slip away to her church, a social gathering or the W.C.T.U. to which she belonged. So uncomplaining was she that even her family did not know of her physical condition, and her death after two weeks in the hospital was a shock to all. Only one of her father's family is left, a brother, Rev. J.F. Beeson, of Monaca, Pennsylvania. Her brothers were Thomas, John, William, Jonathan, Charles and one sister, Mrs. Clementine Warner. To mourn the loss of a loving mother are four sons, Merrill of Victorville, Felix B. and Marcellus of Whittier, Scott of Long Beach, and one daughter, Mrs. Denelda Hoag of Huntington Park; also eight grandchildren. As her children were about her at the hospital, she said, \"A kind Father is watching over you, be true Christians.\" Although she did not expect to die so soon, she had no fear of death, but the kind Father took her to meet the little boy, Douglass, the husband so lately gone and a host of other dear ones in that \"sweet bye and bye.\" Her prayers and beckoning hand are for a united family in Heaven.\n\nHorstman, Louis J.
