        "text": "NOTICE: 100th Anniversary Memorial -- Friday, December 9, 2011\n\nView results of the 100th Anniversary Memorial and Public Tour\n\nView a youtube link of story: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMl9XItQ2IU\n\nKnoxville and the surrounding areas were able to rebuild after the Civil War faster than many parts of the South due in large part to the manufacturing and mining jobs created by the Knoxville Iron and Coal Company. Cross Mountain was one of their mines and it opened in 1888. By 1911, the Cross Mountain Mine had two power plants to generate electricity for the operation. The main entries and haul ways of the mine were lit by electric incandescent light. Coal was cut by electric chain machines and hauled out of the mine by electric motor cars. Miners loaded the coal onto the cars and used carbide and open oil lamps for illumination. Mules were used to pull coal cars from remote areas to the main entries so the electric motor cars could transport the coal out of the mine.\n\nBecause the fan was damaged by the explosion, another fan was brought from a nearby mine and assembled at the drift mouth to force air into the mine. Meanwhile, a bonfire was set at the airshaft to induce ventilation out of the mine by throwing bales of burning cotton down the shaft. Also, the fan at the adjacent Thistle Mine where George Camp was superintendent, normally operated as a force fan, but its direction was reversed in an attempt to induce ventilation. Coal pillars had previously been robbed between the two mines causing the ground adjacent to the mines to cave. The effort at Thistle was done to draw out afterdamp (i.e. poisonous gases that form after an explosion) from the Cross Mountain Mine through the caved ground that separated the two mines. It worked. Afterdamp was detected at Thistle 10 minutes after the direction of the fan was reversed. The success of that effort was also evidenced by all the rats in the Thistle Mine being killed by afterdamp.\n\nRescue Operation\n\nOne of the miners who responded to the explosion was a Welsh miner named Phillip Francis. He had led one of the rescue parties at Fraterville in 1902 and later wrote in a book about his life: A few years after the Fraterville mine explosion, another explosion took place at an adjoining mine called Cross Mountain Mine. A message was sent to me to come at once as they needed rescuers. I left Jellico on the morning train for Coal Creek. Many other miners were on the train. As I arrived near Coal Creek, several miners approached and said to me \"We have forty miners on the train going to the mine to help. If you would be our leader we would follow you into the mine. We wondered why you would risk your life going into a closed shop Union Mine. We know you have fought our Union for many years with men having been killed on both sides and the fight still continues\". I said \"Yes, I have fought you hard, but when I see my fellow miners in distress, I cannot fight them for I am one of you\".\n\nOn arriving at the mine, the same sorrowful scene greeted us. Women and children were weeping and all in great distress. Once again, I must control myself and not let my sympathy weaken me. I had work to perform. So I went into the mine with those forty men. It was a drift opening. After going in nearly one mile, I came to a body lying on one side of the entry. Black damp had taken his life. The air was foul. I met a man with a small cage with a dead canary in it. I met another man with a gas mask on and carrying his oxygen with him.\n\nThen, 58 hours after the explosion, a door was found open at the 18 Left entry that said, Dont shut this door, men in 16 Left. Rescuers found that barricade walls had been built between 16 Left and 17 Left entries. They tore down the barricade wall and tested the air with one of their canaries. Inside, they found three men. One of them was crouched against a wall, smoking his pipe. The others were burned but alive. Later, two other men who had left the barricaded room to attempt escape were also found alive. One of the reasons they had selected their location to await rescue was because it was where tubs had been placed for mules to drink and provided the trapped miners with a source of drinking water.\n\nTen days after the explosion, another barricade wall was found with writing on it. Inside, the rescuers found that Alonzo Wood and Eugene Ault had already suffocated. They also found where those miners had written their farewell messages on an adjacent barricade wall before they died. Eugene Aults farewell message is inscribed on his headstone in Briceville Cemetery.\n\nA listing of the 84 miners who were killed and the five who were rescued at Cross Mountain, and where they are buried, is attached.\n\nBefore he suffocated in the Fraterville Mine in 1902, Powell Harmon wrote: Dear wife and children, my time has come to die. I trust in Jesus. Teach the children to believe in Jesus. We are all almost smothered. I hope to meet you all in heaven. May God bless you all wife and children for Jesus sake goodbye until we meet to part no more. My boys, never work in the coal mines. Henry and Condy be good boys and stay with your mother and trust for Jesus sake. Condy Harmon did not follow his fathers advice. He died in the Cross Mountain Mine explosion and is buried next to his father in Longfield Cemetery. In the early 1900's, if you wanted to support your family in Coal Creek, you mined coal. Today, a good education provides students with unlimited opportunities for professions, like Powell Harmons great-grandson who graduated from college and owns a computer software development company.\n\nCause of Explosion\n\nAlthough Cross Mountain was classified as a non-gassy mine, methane gas was detected during the subsequent investigation at 25 Left entry. Based on the evidence, a roof fall had occurred at that location which released the gas. The gas apparently ignited when one of the miners approached to examine the roof fall.\n\nCross Mountain was one of the first successful rescue operation led by the Bureau of Mines. They documented what they found, compiled lessons-learned, and developed methods to reduce the potential for future disasters. Their success at rescuing the miners at Cross Mountain led to continued funding and allocation of resources which have resulted in safer working conditions for miners today.\n\nLEGACY\n\nMine safety is now the mandate of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) that led the successful rescue of miners trapped in the flooded Quecreek Mine in Pennsylvania in 2002. Coal mining is no longer on the list of most-dangerous professions in the U.S. In 1911, 2,656 miners lost their lives in the Nation's coal mines. Last year, 28 coal miners died nationally while producing the coal that provides over half of the electricity used in this country.\n\nAttempts to portray the Coal Creek miners as poor and abused do them a disservice. They came to Coal Creek from as far away as Wales to seek a future for themselves and their families. Nobody held guns to their heads making them work in the coal mines. To the contrary, when their neighbors started losing their jobs to the convict lease system, they literally went to war to protect the mining jobs in Coal Creek.\n\nThe legacy of the Coal Creek miners....fueled the industrial revolution, abolished the convict lease system in the South, and made working conditions safer for future miners.... rivals that of any comparable group its size in history."
