        "text": "Today is the feast of Our Lady, Help of Christians. St. John Chrysostom was the first person to use this Marian title in year 345 A.D. It is associated with the defense of Christian Europe (Latin and Greek), the north of Africa and the Middle East from non-Christian peoples during the Middle Ages. In 1571, during the expansion of the Islamic Ottoman Empire intended to invade Christian Europe, Pope St. Pius V invoked Christian armies and its victory achieved was consequently attributed to the intercession Our Lady, Help of Christians.\n\nIt is interesting to note the affinity this title has with today which is also known as Empire Day. A celebration of the British Empire and its dependencies. Something which I had previously been aware of (2015). I thought it particularly curious to chart my path from a celebration of one to the other. Now we live in a world without the British Empire as such even if it still has a influence on a global level. I am now more concerned with the spiritual battle Christians (and others) face rather than on a rose-tinted view of what this country does. Of course I am still proud of my nation’s heritage but I now longer subscribe to the notion that what the goes on today is anything like a traditional state of affairs.\n\nAdditionally there is the move from Britannia – as Athena or Wisdom – to Our Lady as the Divine Sophia. Both appear as figures ready to shelter us from the world behind a shield or or mantle, sub tuum praesidium as it were. The latter is an orientation upwards as opposed to horizontal – the supernatural over the natural – yet a unification of both is necessary, hence the Cross.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that this title of Our Lady is venerated by the Chinese Catholics. In May 2007, Pope Benedict XVI designated 24 May her feast for the Roman Catholics in China, who face persecution and restriction from the Chinese Communist Party. Again showing a move from nationalism to a community based on a conscious spiritual affinity.\n\nHere we see that at the very least the people of the Christendom in the Middle Ages, and to a certain extent British Empire, knew who they were and what they stood for – something which we would all benefit from today.\n\nOur Lady, Help of Christians, pray for us!\n\n“When around one everything has become silent, solemn as a clear, starlit night, when the soul comes to be alone in the whole world, then before one there appears, not an extraordinary human being, but the eternal power itself, then the heavens open, and the I chooses itself or, more correctly, receives itself. Then the personality receives the accolade of knighthood that ennobles it for an eternity.”\n\nEither/Or part II p. 177\n\nSoren Kierkegaard’s description of the knight of faith will be evocative for anyone familiar with the path to gnosis outlined by Tomberg, Mouravieff, and others. Through quieting the emotions, the passions, one becomes as a mirror ready to reflect the Will of Him above and ready to hear the Word of God in the silence of the heart. For Kierkegaard he describes it as one who has transformed his personality through a noble asceticism, receiving his “I” as “the accolade of knighthood”. Can we not see this too in St Bernard of Clairvaux, the Desert Fathers, St John Henry Newman, and many more besides?\n\n“The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien.”\n\nFear and Trembling, Hong p. 50\n\nSo too in the modern world, those without faith – without insight – are among the growing numbers of those with mental health issues. Cut off from God, from a certain sense of self, they are adrift upon the sea of iniquity. It is their belief that they have freedom by denying divinity, where really the man who says “not my will, but Thy will be done” has true freedom; this Tomberg alludes to in his work Covenant of the Heart. He asks: “What is an act of faith?” Kierkegaard, as the first quote above suggests, would be inclined to answer that one has to take a leap of faith to receive the insight and thus would be convinced when one does so in the conscious act itself. Hence his use of Abraham and Isaac in depicting the knight of faith.\n\nThe question “what is an act of faith?” like the dilemma of Abraham or the mystery of the Incarnation, the Word made flesh, in the quiet of Nazareth long ago are not something to solve, rather they are profound moments for meditation. We should be struck by them, as one is when one hits their head on a windowpane, for they are after all right there in front of us but we do not see them. We may hear the words of the Masters voice but are we His sheep? Do we hear His voice?\n\nPostscript\n\nThe Patrons of Europe\n\nSs. Benedict of Nursia, Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, Catherine of Siena, and Edith Stein (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) are considered patrons of Europe. Benedict is the main patron saint, while the others are considered co-patrons. In addition, it is believed the whole continent was granted protection under Our Lady of Europe in the 14th Century. Which politicians today recognise this? What if we recognised this in ourselves first?\n\nWomen may appear strange to those who do not know them. Just as with men, women like to socialise, some do this with a greater sense of urgency than others. For instance they like to take many photos of themselves and post them on social media. Others prefer solitude, they are quiet and reserved.\n\nIn much the same way, the Soul or Anima will be confusing or be unrelatable to those who are unfamiliar with stillness. In an article from a few years ago, Cologero highlights the aim of meditation which is to “bring the I consciousness into the lower parts of being … [where] one will find other beings, i.e., different “I’s” or different personalities, each claiming to be the true I.” Discovering more about oneself can be exciting, as can finding out more about women, it depends on what path you want to take.\n\nLet us consider a suggestion and a warning from a holy man of God:\n\nA most excellent means of keeping ourselves pure, is to lay open all our thoughts, as soon as possible, to our confessor with the greatest sincerity, and keep nothing hidden in ourselves.\n\nWhen sensual thoughts come into the mind, we ought immediately to make use of our minds, and fix them instantaneously upon something or other, no matter what.\n\nSt. Philip Neri\n\nSaint Philip is here talking about the passions and their unnerving ability to lead us down paths we do not wish to go down. Through meditation we can unify the Self with the Soul or Anima so that our passions do not control us. By revealing our thoughts, even if it is painful to do so, we can gain knowledge of the Self. This is essentially what C. J. Jung describes in his Two Essays on Analytical Psychology.*\n\nThe Diurnal and the Nocturnal\n\nBecause history—as, moreover, the life of the individual —is “worked” by day and by night. It has a diurnal aspect and a nocturnal aspect. The former is exoteric, whilst the latter is esoteric. The silence and obscurity of the night is always full of events in preparation — and all that which is unconscious or superconscious in the human being belongs to the domain of “night”. This is the magical side of history, the side of magical deeds and works acting behind the facade of history “by day”.\n\nValentin Tomberg, Letter V, The Pope\n\nAs history repeats itself so do our dreams. I have had some interesting dreams recently. I will detail them as events that actually happened. Meeting someone new is a unique opportunity to reflect on oneself, reflecting on dreams can also be fruitful. As Tomberg affirms, “The silence and obscurity of the night is always full of events in preparation.” I wrote about my dreams before; I found the process to be helpful, reflective and enjoyable.\n\nIn the first dream I distinctly remember a sensation of touch as if the woman before me, who was standing in the room, was touching my arm. She was naked, smiling, and somewhat familiar – perhaps it was a memory or a film I had watched – Ex Machina comes to mind.\n\nThen, last night, I again met someone who I thought I had met before. It is probably just my subconscious using images from my day to day life. However the way in which I met them was curious. I was in a beautiful house with multiple rooms. Each room was lavishly fitted and appointed. I was left to my own devices to explore, though meeting “the parents” was somewhat awkward.\n\nThere was a definite sense that the mansion was mine for the taking, being linked as it were, to the woman in the dream. This then could represent the extent of my existence and the woman as a potential aspect of my soul. Compounding this was the inclusion of another woman who appeared later, different from the first, but similarly familiar. While intimate with the first the second was more intimate, not much later, I woke up.\n\nSo there are three women, each distinct, from the first to the last becoming progressively more intimate; from a touch, to kisses, to embracing. When considering my life so far it seems to me that the physically pales in comparison to the spiritual and emotional effects of union with a woman, as strange as that might seem to some readers.\n\nSome questions arise:\n\nHow does one go from a path of courtly love, in which the Knight and his Lady remain apart, often not meeting again, to the Catholic position on marriage, of which the principle goal is to get one’s spouse to Heaven?\n\nWhat is meant by the choice between Good and Evil in the Soul? Eve came from Adam, and through her obedience to the Serpent rather than God turned Adam from God to the Earth. How does one undo that wrong and return to God?\n\nA good place to start – for meditative insight – would be with Dante’s Comedia, where the Blessed Virgin Mary is exalted as the new Eve, where we find Beatrice and Saint Lucy, and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux too. Furthermore, his initiation into the Fedeli d’Amore, and the fruits thereof cannot be left untouched. Fortuitously a Dante reading group has just started…\n\n*The ultimate synthesis – speaking from the male point of view – is the integration of the Anima archetype, The archetypes are inborn in the psychic makeup, so the Anima is the image of the woman in the man. Prior to conscious awareness of the Anima, it is a dark force, erupting into awareness as unexplained moods and other ways.\n\nThe gentrified ignore Wisdom’s call.\n\nThis is a post based upon work I did in the summer. It did not turn out how I intended it to. Essentially what I understood is that Solomon and David came from different backgrounds. David was a shepherd and Solomon born to wealth. Solomon here has been gentrified. He is not like St Cuthbert (also a shepherd) or Conan the Barbarian, he has lost his primal instincts. That said the wisdom of Solomon is something to marvel at.\n\nI looked into the Book of Proverbs, which are written by Solomon son of David, king of Israel. King David, the prophet par excellence in Christianity, is an ideal king and the forefather of the Messiah. His son Solomon sought after Wisdom or Sophia (though not until old age did, he recognise the folly of his earlier years). Our Lord, while portraying Solomon as a teacher of wisdom and arrayed in glory, declared he was excelled by “the lilies of the field”.[1] How reminiscent of viewing the commonplace with wonder?\n\nOne thing I realised is for all Solomon’s wisdom it is David that I am more drawn to. Perhaps when I am older I will see that my earlier years were folly as Solomon did? However, it is the romantic in me that is drawn to the tale of the underdog, the shepherd boy, who rises to greatness rather than the one who is born into greatness. Choosing ones birth is a conscious decision, then life becomes a question of how rather than why. St John Henry Newman wrote:\n\nThe Mission of My Life\n\nGod has created me to do Him some definite service. He has committed some work to me which He has not committed to another. I have my mission. I may never know it in this life, but I shall be told it in the next. I am a link in a chain, a bond of connection between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good; I shall do His work. I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place, while not intending it if I do but keep His commandments. Therefore, I will trust Him, whatever I am, I can never be thrown away. If I am in sickness, my sickness may serve Him, in perplexity, my perplexity may serve Him. If I am in sorrow, my sorrow may serve Him. He does nothing in vain. He knows what He is about. He may take away my friends. He may throw me among strangers. He may make me feel desolate, make my spirits sink, hide my future from me. Still, He knows what He is about.\n\nAmen\n\nAddendum\n\nAs Proverbs is in part about the Blessed Virgin Mary personified as Wisdom we might say a little about her role in the creation of the Word through her fiat to God. She made herself through her humility and devotion into the perfect reciprocal for the Son who’s Incarnation we have just celebrated. Proverbs read in this way shows how she was there in the mind of God from the beginning with the Word. She is the vessel through which grace passes into the world:\n\nThe Gifts of Wisdom\n\n8 Does not wisdom call,\n\nand does not understanding raise her voice?\n\n2 On the heights, beside the way,\n\nat the crossroads she takes her stand;\n\n3 beside the gates in front of the town,\n\nat the entrance of the portals she cries out:\n\nProverbs 8:1-3\n\nWisdom’s Part in Creation\n\n22 The Lord created me at the beginning of his work,\n\nthe first of his acts of long ago.\n\n23 Ages ago I was set up,\n\nat the first, before the beginning of the earth.\n\n24 When there were no depths I was brought forth,\n\nwhen there were no springs abounding with water.\n\n25 Before the mountains had been shaped,\n\nbefore the hills, I was brought forth—\n\n26 when he had not yet made earth and fields,\n\nor the world’s first bits of soil.\n\n27 When he established the heavens, I was there,\n\nwhen he drew a circle on the face of the deep,\n\n28 when he made firm the skies above,\n\nwhen he established the fountains of the deep,\n\n29 when he assigned to the sea its limit,\n\nso that the waters might not transgress his command,\n\nwhen he marked out the foundations of the earth,\n\n30 then I was beside him, like a master worker;\n\nand I was daily his delight,\n\nrejoicing before him always,\n\n31 rejoicing in his inhabited world\n\nand delighting in the human race.\n\nProverbs 8:22-31\n\nThe gentrified are too comfortable, like Solomon, they go there way in the city when Wisdom calls from the square and the rooftops. A ‘rebuke’ to follow Our Lady when she invites us to.\n\nI have of late been praying the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary more than I have at any time before. I would like to share some revelations on the mysteries and the Rosary itself that I have received.\n\nFor a while now I have utilised a contemplative practice of ‘calling down’ revelation. A better way to describe it may be to place oneself in a state open to receiving revelation. This could be done without a Rosary, one would simply remain still, not fidget, and centre oneself. Usually for Westerners this focuses on the front of the head around where the forehead is, often just behind. I personally get this sensation and it is above my eyes. In this contemplative state I can sift my thoughts as if I was panning for gold in a stream of consciousness. Hopefully I can by this method remove or refocus negative thoughts and if I am blessed find nuggets of remembered truth.\n\nThis process can be further extenuated by the following schema:\n\nHead – initial point of focus for revelation\n\nNeck – point at which words are vocalised and revelation expressed\n\nHeart – point at which revelation is internalised\n\nThis process can, and in some circumstances should, be continued to the lower elements. The Knights of the Temple would be candidates for this continued process. As monks they are called to the former but as warriors they are also called to the latter, that is to actualise revelation in all elements including lower telluric currents for example, libido, the stomach, work and soldiering (in the sense of the kshatriya).\n\nI will now consider the three sets of mysteries that make up the Rosary, the Joyful, Sorrowful and Glorious mysteries, totalling one hundred and fifty Hail Marys which mirror the psalms of the Psalter. Roughly speaking I now see the mysteries as encompassing three broad schemes;\n\nJoyful – associated with the decent of revelation often through the Spirit or in proximity to the Word\n\nSorrowful – a threshold and/or purgation of both the body and the soul of impurities\n\nGlorious – after the dark night and descent downwards there is the ascent upwards repeated so that what is below becomes what is above and vice versa\n\nJoyful\n\nThe Joyful mysteries begin with the Blessed Virgin Mary in a state of prayer, as above yet perfect in every sense. She is then visited by the Archangel Gabriel, who reveals to her the promise of Motherhood of God. She contemplates this thought; she ponders it in her heart. Thus, she receives revelation, brings it to her heart and then back though her neck in her vocalisation of accent. It is important to note that she accepts the offer first in her heart then vocalises her response. Also be doing this so perfectly she manifests this truth in her flesh as St Augustine writes.\n\nShe then takes the Divine Word to St Elizabeth, her cousin. It is through her proximity to the Word that St Elizabeth can proclaim Mary as the Mother of the Lord. Mary is also able to utter the Magnificat due to being filled with the Word or revelation as previously stated.\n\nThe shepherds do not receive revelation in a vision but rather a dream. They have not prepared themselves as Mary had done. Yet this gives us hope that some of our dreams can be revelatory if we have the wisdom and prudence to discern them.\n\nSimeon’s proximity to the Word, like Elizabeth, imbues him with revelation. Moreover, both he and Elizabeth show pious devotion in patience and fasting. We can appreciate those who can wait and fast as tuning their bodies as antenna to receive revelatory signals.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most cryptically, Jesus, Mary and Joseph travel to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast just as Christ will before his Passion. Jesus is ‘lost’, what does this mean? Mary and Joseph cannot have been so careless, what it means, I think, is they went to the temple in Jerusalem as they ought to have done yet revelation was with them always. Jesus confirms this with the words “I must be about my Father’s business.” Likewise, we must be about Our Father’s business; what is contained in the eponymous prayer.\n\nSorrowful\n\nWe have a choice to make, just as Jesus did in the Garden of Gethsemane, do we let this chalice pass? Clearly Christ the Son is conformed to the Will of the God the Father, yet he still prayed for the chalice to pass (if it be God’s Will). We must do the same, we might not all be called to deeper conformity with the Trinity in this life. This is a test. A threshold that once crossed leads to suffering, scourging, humiliation and ultimately death, though not death as we might think.\n\nThese mysteries recall a sense of purgation. The Crowning with Thorns is a mortification of the Will, the Carrying of the Cross mirrors our sufferings yet in Christ they are made new. We can suffer materially for Christ, but we can also undergo a dark night of the soul, both are necessary to bring revelation to the elements of our being. Each person will encounter these tasks in different ways.\n\nGlorious and Conclusion\n\nAfter the dark comes the light, and with it the vertical ladder which ascends and descends. Christ descends into Hell and after three days returns to Earth. If our mortal life be these three days, then it is a small price to pay for eternity in Heaven. By receiving revelation, we conform ourselves, body, spirit and soul to the Word, making us a vessel worthy of receiving it. We aim to rid ourselves of sin also known as mistakes, these negative aspects, that seek to pull us into perversions.\n\nJesus then ascends into Heaven. He prepares a way for us by showing us the path we must follow. Mary does this too though we shall mention more on this later. St Clement of Alexandria (c. 150–215), wrote: “Yea, I say, the Word of God became a man so that you might learn from a man how to become a god.”[1] And just so, at Pentecost, the Apostles and Our Lady are blessed with the wisdom of the Spirit by dwelling in peace and stillness of mind.\n\nMary, as our solitary boast, not a divine creature like Christ is our surest way to Christ and therefore to the Blessed Trinity. How did Mary do this? Mary was immaculately conceived, free from Original Sin and thus in an Edenic State. Like Adam she could commit no sin, knew all the essences of the animals, had a united Intellect and Will and so on. By conforming ourselves to Mary we can attempt to come as close as possible to the state of Man before the Fall.\n\nTo present another schema like to the one above, we know Christ is the ‘head’ of the Church while Mary then is the ‘neck’, and we are the ‘body’:\n\nHead – Christ\n\nNeck – Mary\n\nBody – Man\n\nMary has been given the privilege of mediating graces from Christ to the body of the church, thus making her the neck in this schema. I believe this matches the first schema in which we see revelation in the head (Christ), and vocalisation in the neck (Mary). It was the latter’s ‘fiat’, that vocalisation of the revelation, which brought it into her body. This parallels Mary’s role in the Church and our goal of bringing revelation down through the neck from the head to the heart and to the rest of the body.\n\nWe may like Mary come to Heaven through a dormition at the end of our earthly lives, hopefully fortified by the Sacraments of the Church, and in joyous expectation of what it to come. Poetically the ascension of Galahad is perhaps another way it might ‘end’.[2] It is due to his purity of heart that he is both able to succeed in achieving the Grail and having the strength to overcome the obstacles in his way. We can see St Bernard as the prototypical Galahad as we have mentioned elsewhere, and this is where, with the help of Our Lady, we will continue our search.\n\n[1] For more on the Fathers who teach this doctrine see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divinization_(Christian) N.B. A further article on this topic shall follow in the future.\n\n[2] After many adventures, Galahad and Percival find themselves in the mystical castle of Corbenic at the court of Pelles and Eliazar, his son. These men bring Galahad into a room where he is finally allowed to see the Holy Grail. Galahad is asked to take the vessel to the holy island Sarras. After seeing the Grail, Galahad, however, makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing. So it is, while making his way back to Arthur’s court, Galahad is visited by Joseph of Arimathea, and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die. Galahad bids Percival and Bors farewell, after which angels appear to take him to Heaven, an ascension witnessed by Bors and Percival. While it is not explicit that the Holy Grail is never to be seen again on Earth, it is stated (in Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur) that there has since then been no knight capable of obtaining it. The Grail being analogous to the Sacred Heart as we have written elsewhere."
