        "text": "HomePage Home Page for Mary, Mother of God\n\nProposed 5th Marian Dogma\n\nLinks\n\nMary: Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, Advocate\n\nby Mark I Miravale, S.T.D.\n\nForward\n\nRome\n\n5 May 1993\n\nI read with pleasure and admiration this theological study about Mary, Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, Advocate.\n\nIt is all in conformity with Divine Revelation, in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, in the Tradition of the Church from the times of the Apostles, and in the solemn and ordinary Magisterium of the Church, up to and including Pope John Paul II in his encyclical, Redemptoris Mater.\n\nI had the great honor to be the professor of Mariology to the Polish student Karol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II), when he attended the Pontifical Athenaeneum International \"Angelicum\" in Rome, for his license and doctorate in Theology (1947-1948).\n\nThe doctrine of St. Albert the Great (now thought to be Pseudo-Albert) and of St. Thomas Aquinas about the maternal participation of the Virgin Mother in the Redemption as Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, and Advocate had a great influence in the Church.\n\nI share the hope of Dr. Mark Miravalle:\n\n\"With the profound contribution of our present Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, to the understanding of the mediating mystery of Mary with Christ and the Church ... there is only one final action that remains in bringing the Marian roles of Coredemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate ... into the fullest acknowledgement and ecclesial life of the People of God: that our Holy Father, in his office as Vicar of Christ on earth and guided by the Spirit of Truth, define and proclaim the Marian roles of Coredemptrix, Mediatrix of all graces, and Advocate for the People of God as Christian dogma revealed by God, in rightful veneration of the Mother of Jesus, and for the good of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church of Christ.\"\n\nYours sincerely in Christ and in the Vigin Mary,\n\nLuigi Cardinal Ciappi, O.P.\n\nPapal Theologian Emeritus\n\nfor\n\nPopes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I and John Paul II\n\nPreface\n\nThe following document concerning Mary, Mother of Jesus, contains little that is fundamentally new. It is rather for the most part a synthesis of Mary's exalted roles as Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, and Advocate as they are already contained in the sources of divine revelation, Sacred Scripture and Apostolic Tradition, as interpreted by the Magisterium (cf. Dei Verbum, n. 9,10), and as it is presently understood and experienced in the dynamic ecciesial life of the Living, Pondering, and Praying Church, the People of God.\n\nIt is true that in the divine drama of how God makes himself and his will known to humanity, certain doctrinal truths are only more fully penetrated after the Church has ages of human history in which to ponder and reflect upon the divine seeds of these truths which are contained in the Word of God, both written and handed down. If God has reserved a greater and more complete understanding of certain revealed seeds of faith regarding Mary, the Mother of Jesus, until our own recent centuries, then such a greater understanding granted by the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, should not be met with a potentially stagnant incredulity on this fact alone. Rather, it should evoke a fresh appreciation for the ever-dynamic designs of God in leading the pilgrim People of God towards their eternal home, and for the Holy Spirit, who blows where he wills (cf. Jn. 3:8).\n\nI believe such to be the case about the roles of Mary, Mother of Jesus, as the Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, and Advocate for the People of God. This in no way infers a new public revelation about the Mother of Jesus; but rather a new and more developed penetration into the already revealed truths about Mary and the intimate \"union of the mother with the Son in the work of salvation\" (Lumen Gentium, n. 57).\n\nMay our minds and hearts be one with the Lord and his words at the Last Supper, in openness to and trust in the Holy Spirit, the Counselor of the People of God and Divine Spouse of Mary, in leading us to the deepest possible understanding about the revelation of God concerning the Mother of Jesus. May the Holy Spirit lead us to the whole truth about Mary:\n\n\"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you in all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come\" (Jn 16:12).\n\nMark I. Miravalle, S.T.D.\n\nAssociate Professor of Theology and Mariology\n\nFranciscan University of Steubenville\n\n31 May 1993\n\nIntroduction\n\n\"When the fullness of time had come, God sent his son, born of a woman . . . to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons\" (Gal 4:4-5).\n\nIt was the will of the heavenly Father that his Son, Jesus Christ, be sent into the world for the purpose of redeeming the human family (cf Jn 3:16, Phil 2:6-11). It was also the will of the Father that a woman be intimately involved in this wondrous plan of human redemption; for as John Paul II tells us, \"the Mother of the Redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation.\"[1]\n\nIn the rich Tradition of the Church founded by Christ, four divinely revealed doctrines about Mary, Mother of Jesus, have come forth from the inspired pages of Sacred Scripture, and through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, these Marian doctrines have been gradually brought to light by the living Church.[2]\n\n\"The Virgin Mary, who at the message of the angel received the Word of God in her heart and in her body and gave Life to the world, is acknowledged and honored as being truly the Mother of God and of the redeemer.\"[3]\n\nThese words of the Second Vatican Council echo the Council of Ephesus where in 431 A.D. this early ecumenical council defined the first Marian doctrine which, the Motherhood of God, \"Theotókos,\" proclaims that Mary is truly the Mother of God the Son made man: \"the Holy Virgin is the Mother of God since according to the flesh she brought forth the Word of God made flesh.\"[4]\n\nA few centuries later, the living and praying Church, pondering the Scriptural revelation of Mary's virginity, defined the second Marian doctrine, the Perpetual Virginity of Mary. At the Lateran Council in 649, Pope Martin I proclaimed the three-fold nature of the virginity of Mary:\n\n\"she conceived without seed, of the Holy Spirit...and without injury brought him forth...and after his birth preserved her virginity inviolate.\"[5]\n\nThe third Marian doctrine came to its most complete illumination by the Church more than a thousand years later.\n\n\"The Most Holy Virgin Mary was, in the first moment of her conception, by a unique gift of grace and privilege of Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, preserved free from all stain of original sin.\"[6]\n\nThe infallible statement by Pope Pius IX in 1854 which defined the Immaculate Conception of Mary confirmed centuries of Christian belief that she who was greeted by the angel as \"full of grace\"(Lk 1:28) entered into human existence without the stain of ' original sin.\n\nIn more recent times, the Assumption of Mary was the fourth Marian doctrine defined to be contained in God's revelation to humanity. \"Mary, the immaculate perpetually Virgin Mother of God, after the completion of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into the glory of Heaven.\"[7] The woman who intimately shared in the victory of Christ over the serpent (cf. Gen 3:15) could not suffer the effects of sin and death that came from the Evil one and his seed, with whom she was given complete enmity by Almighty God.\n\nBut at the same time we know that the Marian mystery in God's plan of salvation does not end with the earthly life of the Virgin of Nazareth and her departure. The Second Vatican Council reminds us: \"Taken up in Heaven she did not lay aside this saving office, but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation.\"[8]\n\nThe Council goes on to say: \"Therefore the Blessed Virgin is invoked in the Church under the titles of Advocate, Helper, Benefactress, and Mediatrix.\"[9] These titles of Mary, such as Mediatnx and Advocate, refer to roles given to Mary by the heavenly Father and sustained by the Holy Spirit because of her intimate sharing in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.\n\nTo understand, therefore, the roles of Mary as Mediatrix and Advocate which she now exercises with the aid of the Holy Spint from her rightful place in Heaven we must examine the meritorious foundation for these God-given roles during her earthly life as the \"handmaid of the Lord\" (Lk 1:38).\n\n\"Thus the daughter of Abraham, Mary, consenting to the word of God, became the Mother of Jesus. Committing herself wholeheartedly and impeded by no sm to God s saving will she devoted herself totally as a handmaid of the Lord to the person and work of her Son under and with him, serving the work of redemption\"....[10]\n\nMary's intimate cooperation with the Redeemer began at the Annunciation, where she freely participated in the work of man's salvation through faith and obedience (cf. Lk 1:28).\n\nBut the cooperation of the Mother of the Redeemer in the work of redemption did not cease with her fiat to the angel.\n\n\"The Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith and faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross, where she stood, in keeping with the divine plan, enduring with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffering, associated herself with his sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim which was born of her.\" [11]\n\nThese profound words of the Second Vatican Council describe the spiritual sufferings and intimate cooperation Mary experienced with the Redeemer at the foot of the cross (cf. Jn 19:26) in perfect maternal obedience to God's plan of salvation.\n\nIt is in light of Mary's unique and intimate cooperation with the Redeemer, both at the Incarnation (cf. Lk 1:28) and at the work of Redemption at Calvary (cf. Jn 19:26), that the Church has invoked Mary under the title, \"Coredemptrix.\"[12]\n\nThe prefix \"co\" does not mean equal, but comes from the Latin word, \"cum,\" which means \"with\". The title of Coredemptrix applied to the Mother of Jesus never places Mary on a level of equality with Jesus Christ, the divine Lord of all, in the saving process of humanity's redemption. Rather, it denotes Mary's singular and unique sharing with her Son in the saving work of redemption for the human family. The Mother of Jesus participates in the redemptive work of her Saviour Son, who alone could reconcile humanity with the Father in his glorious divinity and humanity. Jesus Christ, true God and true man, redeems the human family, as the God-man. Mary, who is completely subordinate and dependent to her redeeming Son even for her own human redemption,[13]participates in the redemptive act of her Son as his exalted human mother.\n\nBecause of her intimate and unparalleled sharing in the mysterious work with the divine Redeemer, Mary, human Mother of the Redeemer, has merited the Church title, \"Coredemptrix\" which literally means, \"with the Redeemer.\"\n\nMary's other roles in the Church as Mediatrix[14] and Advocate[15] are in fact a flowing over of her role as Coredemptrix. Pope John Paul II tells us, \"Mary's role as Coredemptrix did not cease with the glorification of her Son.\"[16]\n\nThere remains one final doctrinal pillar of the Marian mystery revealed by God that seems to call for the proclamation of clarity and truth that only the Church can provide in its crucial task of \"giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God.\"[17] It is the Christian revelation of Mary as Coredemptrix with the Redeemer, as well as the resulting roles of Mediatrix and Advocate for the People of God. For the People of God, as the Council tells us, \"still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties, until they are led into their blessed home.\"[18]\n\nLet us proceed to examine these Marian roles of Coredemptrix, Mediatrix, and Advocate, as they manifest themselves in the rich revelation of the Word of God entrusted to the Church.[19] Let us in a special way invoke the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, for \"the Holy Spirit, through whom the living voice of the Gospel rings out in the Church - and through her to the world - leads believers to the full truth, and makes the Word of Christ dwell in them in all its richness\" (cf. Col 3: 16).[20] Hence the Christian faithful will be able to listen attentively to what \"the Spirit\" is \"saying to the Churches\" today about the \"Handmaid of the Lord\" (cf. Rev 2:7,11,17; Lk l:38).[21]FOOTNOTES\n\n1. Pope John Paul II, Redemptoris Mater, 25 March 1987, n. 1.\n\n2 Cf.

The earliest documents, as they are read in the Church and are understood in light of a further and full revelation, bring the figure of a woman, Mother of the Redeemer, into a gradually clearer light. Considered in this light, she is already prophetically foreshadowed in the promise of victory over the serpent which was given to our first parents after their fall into sin\" (cf. Gen 3:1 5).[22]\n\nThe Mother of the Redeemer and her providential role in redemption is prophetically foreshadowed in the promise of the future Saviour revealed in the inspired book of Genesis.\n\nFollowing the sin committed by our first parents in the garden, God addresses the serpent: \"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall crush your head and you shall lie in wait for his heel\" (Gen 3:15).\n\nThe sacred text reveals a crucial struggle, singular and absolute, between the tempter Satan and the future redeemer, Jesus Christ. This revealed struggle will end in triumph for the \"seed of the woman.\"[23]\n\nThe \"woman\" foreshadows the mother of the redeemer, who intimately shares in the same struggle and same victory as the future redeemer against the serpent of evil. For it was God's manifest will that the Woman share in the same \"enmity\" between herself and the serpent as does her redeeming seed (cf. Gen. 3:15). This struggle and victory over the serpent foreshadows the great work of redemption effected by the Saviour of the world, as well as the Mother of the Redeemer's intimate cooperation in this saving act. Mary is indeed \"prophetically foreshadowed in the promise of victory over the serpent which was given to our first parents after their fall into sin \"[24]\n\nPope Pius IX explained Mary's \"intimate and indissoluble\" union with Jesus Christ in his redemptive triumph over Satan which was prophesied in Genesis 3:15 in the apostolic letter which infallibly defined the Immaculate Conception:\n\n\"By this divine prophecy [Gen 3:15], the merciful Redeemer of mankind, Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was clearly foretold; that His most blessed Mother, the Virgin Mary, was prophetically indicated; and, at the same time, the very enmity of both against the Evil One was significantly expressed. Hence, just as Christ, the Mediator between God and man, assumed human nature, blotted out the handwriting of the decree that stood against us, fastened it triumphantly to the cross, so the most holy Virgin united with Him by a most intimate and indissoluble bond, was, with Him and through Him, eternally at enmity with the evil Serpent and most completely tnumphed over him....\" [25]\n\nMary was eternally in complete and absolute opposition to Satan, for with and through her Son the Redeemer, the Woman was to intimately share in the complete redemptive triumph over Satan.\n\nThe early Church Fathers gave immediate confirmation to this scriptural prophecy of Mary's true sharing in the work of redemption by modeling the Mother of Jesus as the \"New Eve\" [26] In the mind of the early Fathers Mary was the New Eve who intimately participated with the \"New Adam\" Jesus Christ, in restoring the supernatural life of grace lost by Adam and Eve. Pius XII refers to this Patristic designation of Mary as New Eve and her intimate sharing in the redemptive victory of her Son (based on the Genesis passage) in his apostolic constitution infallibly defining the Assumption of Mary:\n\n\"Since the second century, the Virgin Mary has been designated by the holy Fathers as the New Eve, who, although subject to the New Adam is most intimately associated with Him in that struggle against the eternal foe, which, as foretold in the proto evangelium, finally resulted in that most complete victory over sin and death....\"[27]\n\nThe intimate and unique coredemptive role of Mary, the Woman of the seed (cf. Gen 3: 15) with the Redeemer, the seed of victory over the serpent, is already prophetically revealed in the first inspired text of Sacred Scripture.\n\nIsaiah 7:14 - Mother of the Suffering Servant\n\nAnother great Old Testament prophecy that foretells the coming of the saving messiah is the prophecy of Isaiah 7:14. The Lord reveals to Ahaz a sign of salvation for the people of Israel: \"Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel\" (Is 7:14). Through this virgin-mother (the later Virgin Mother of Nazareth [28]) the Emmanuel, the \"God with us,\" will enter the world to effect its salvation.[29]\n\nBut what would be the price this messiah would have to pay to ransom the world (cf. Mt 10:45)? The same prophetic book of Isaiah describes the redeeming price that would be paid by the messiah, the \"suffering servant\" of God:\n\n\"He was despised and dejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces...he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" (Is 53: 3-5).\n\nThe Virgin Mother prophesied by Isaiah would indeed bring us the redeeming Messiah, the God-with-us. But since her Child was destined to buy back the world \"at a price\" (1 Cor 6:20), the Mother of the Suffering Servant was also, by nature of her maternal relation, destined to suffer. The future Mother of the Redeemer was predestined to suffer with her redeeming Son.\n\n1k 1:38 - New Testament Beginning of Coredemptrix\n\n\"The Redeemer of man, Jesus Christ, is the center of the universe and human history.\" [30] It was the will of the Father that in the fullness of time (cf. Gal 4:4), the Son came into the world as the Redeemer of humanity, to perform the work of the redemption on the Cross (cf. Jn 19:25). But the eternal plan of the Heavenly Father to send his Son for the salvation of the world also included the predestined role of a woman. The Second Vatican Council tells us:\n\n\"The Father of mercies willed that the Incarnation should be preceded by assent on the part of the predestined mother, so that just as a woman had a share in bringing about death, so also a woman should contribute to life. This is pre-eminently true of the Mother of Jesus, who gave to the world the Life that renews all things, and who was enriched by God with gifts appropriate for such a role.\"[31]\n\nWhen the Father elected Mary [32] from among all women (cf. Lk 1:41) to be the Mother of the Redeemer, it was by virtue of this choice by God and the consent of the Handmaid that Mary began her coredemptive role of cooperation with the Redeemer.\n\n\"Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you\" (Lk 1:28). The angel greets the Virgin of Nazareth under a new title, \"full of grace\", in the place of her earthly name, \"Miriam\" or Mary. [33] The Greek word for this new title, \"kécharitôménê\" is the perfect participle of the verb, which tells us that this profound event of grace ascribed to Mary is an action that has been completed in the past, before the announcement of the Angel, [34] and, thus, describes the present state, \"full of grace.\"\n\nIt was Mary's Immaculate Conception that properly prepared her and made her worthy for the intimate and unique cooperation she was to have with the Redeemer made man in the work of salvation. Pope John Paul II states:\n\n\"We must above all note that Mary was created immaculate in order to be better able to act on our behalf. The fullness of grace allowed her to fulfill perfectly her mission of collaboration with the work of salvation: it gave the maximum value to her cooperation in the sacrifice.\" [35]\n\nThe sanctifying action Mary received at the first instant of her conception was enacted by the power of the Holy Spirit, the Divine Sanctifier, for Mary is the \"only one who has become the dwelling place of all the graces of the Holy Spirit.\" [36] Here too at the Annunciation, it will be by the power of the Holy Spirit that Mary will become the Mother of the Redeemer (cf. Lk 1:35). It is the Holy Spirit, the Divine Spouse of Mary, who prepares and sustains Mary at each stage of her coredemptive role.\n\nAfter Mary receives the word from the heavenly messenger that she in her virginity would be overshadowed by the Holy Spirit to become the Mother of the Son of God (cf. Lk 1:34-35), this Daughter of Zion [37] gives her free response to the invitation sent by Yahweh, the Father: \"Behold I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word\" (Lk 1:38). It is the providential union of the creative overshadowing of the Holy Spirit (cf Lk 1:35) and the consenting cooperation of Mary (cf. Lk 1:38) by which \"the Word became flesh\" (Jn 1:14) in the redemptive Incarnation.\n\nWith the freely given \"yes\" of Mary to the new plan of salvation offered by the Father, Mary willfully and physically enters into the heart of the new covenant established for the redemption of the human family. The Council confirms:\n\n\"After a long period of waiting the times are fulfilled in her, the exalted Daughter of Zion, and the new plan of salvation is established, when the Son of God has taken human nature from her, that he might in the mysteries of his flesh free man from sin.\"[38]\n\nAt the Annunciation, Mary begins her role as the Coredemptrix with the Redeemer. Her fiat mihi to the angel is a free \"let it be done to me\" to an intimate sharing in God's new plan of salvation revealed by the angel (cf. Lk 1:31-33). It is a free \"let it be done to me\" to the giving of a human body to the Redeemer, who would fulfill the saving messianic role referred to in Mary's own magnificat (Lk 1:46-55), which \"rejoices in God my Saviour\" (Lk 1:47). It is a free \"let it be done to me\" in cooperating with the Redeemer so intimately that Mary Coredemptrix gave to the Saviour the very instrument of Redemption - his human body - for \"we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all\" (Heb 10:10).\n\nEarly Church Fathers: Mary, the \"New Eve\"\n\nPossibly the most ancient doctrinal image of Mary in the Early Church is that of the \"New Eve.\" The early Fathers saw Mary (cf. Gen 3:15; Lk l :28) as having a free and uniquely integral role with Jesus Christ, the \"New Adam\" (cf. Rom 5:12; 1Cor 15:21), in the redemption of the human family, through the restoration of the supernatural life of grace. [39] As the virgin Eve, through her disobedience to the Father, interiorly cooperated with Adam in the sin that lost the saving life of grace for the human family (cf. Gen 3:6), the Virgin Mary, in her obedience to the Father (cf. Lk 1:38), interiorly cooperated with Jesus Christ, the New Adam, in the salvation of the human family through his redemption.\n\nSt. Irenaeus exemplifies the early Patnstic understanding of Eve's secondary though instrumental sharing in the \"death\" of the supernatural life for the world and Mary's parallel (though antithetical), intimate sharing in the salvation of the human race:\n\n\"...the Virgin Mary was found obedient, saying 'Behold Thy handmaid, O Lord, be it done unto me according to Thy word.' Eve, however, was disobedient; for, while yet a virgin, she did not obey. Just as she...became disobedient and became the cause of death to herself and the whole human race, so Mary...being obedient became for herself and the whole human race the cause of salvation.\"[40]\n\nMary's unequaled participation in the redemption of the human race as the New Eve was the universal Christian teaching in the Early Church.[41] The Second Vatican Council notes the unquestionable acknowledgment by the Fathers of the Church of Mary's unique and free cooperation with the Redeemer in the work of man's salvation:\n\n\"Rightly, therefore, the Fathers see Mary not merely as passively engaged by God, but as freely cooperating in the work of man's salvation through faith and obedience... Not a few of the early Fathers gladly assert with him [St. Irenaeusl in their preaching: 'the knot of Eve's disobedience was untied by Mary's obedience: what the virgin Eve bound by her disbelief, Mary loosened by her faith.' Comparing Mary with Eve, they call her \"Mother of the Living,\" and frequently claim: \"death through Eve, life through Mary.\" [42]\n\nWe can summarize the profound wisdom of the Fathers by saying that just as Eve had an active sharing with Adam in the loss of salvation for the human family (although a role secondary and subordinate to that of Adam), so Mary had an active sharing with Jesus Christ in the redemption of the human family (although a role completely secondary and subordinate to that of Jesus Christ). [43]\n\nFor the Fathers, the Incarnation of Jesus Christ into the world was the beginning of one unified divine act of redemption that saw its merciful climax in the passion and death of the Redeemer on the Cross.[44] The Incarnation is the Redemption begun and anticipated,[45] and Mary's moral and physical cooperation in the Redemptive Incarnation alone merits her Patristic titles of being, in her rightful subordinate manner, the \"cause of our salvation,\" [46] \"the price of the redemption of captives,\"[47] and she who \"brought forth redemption for the human race.\"[48]\n\nFollowing then this Patristic parallel between Eve and Mary, Eve could rightly be seen as the Co-peccatrix (\"with the Sinner\"). For it was Eve who freely gave the \"instrument\" of the Fall, the \"forbidden fruit,\" (cf. Gen 3:6) to Adam, the Peccator (\"the Sinner\") whose sin as father of the human race led to loss of grace for the human race. [49] It is through the instrumentality of the Co-peccatrix that the Peccator effected the death of the human race. [50]\n\nMary then can rightly be seen as the Coredemptrix (with the Redeemer). For it is Mary who freely gave the instrument of the Redemption, the human body to Jesus Christ. The Father no longer desired the sacrifices of the Old Law but prepared for his Saviour Son a body as the New Law instrument of Redemption.\"When Christ came into the world he said Sacrifices and offerings thou hast not desired, but a body has thou prepared for me.\" (Heb. 10:5).\n\n\"We have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ (Heb. 10:10).\" This body, the God-designated instrument of Redemption was freely given to the Redeemer at the Incarnation by Mary, the Coredemptrix.\n\nTruly can it be said that Eve was the Co-peccatrix with the Peccator; Mary the Coredemptrix with the Redeemer.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Father elected Mary from among all women to be the Coredemptrix with the Redeemer. Mary s physical and moral gift of humanity to the Redeemer constitutes an inner participation in the work of Redemption that no other creature in heaven or on earth could ever reach. By giving flesh to the \"Word made flesh\" for our salvation, this act alone rightfully and exclusively merits for the Handmaid of the Lord the title and honor of Coredemptnx.\n\nBut Mary's cooperation at the Annunciation is only the beginning of her faithful role as Coredemptrix.\n\n\"This union of the mother with the Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of Christ's virginal conception up to his death...\"[51] \"The Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in union with her Son unto the cross.\"[52]\n\nThe Son came into the world as the Redeemer of all nations, and the work of Redemption was climaxed at the Cross. Calvary, therefore, was also the event to which the coredeeming Mother was destined to go with her Redeemmg Son.\n\nLk 2:35 - Presentation Prophecy of Coredemptrix\n\nThe New Testament prophecy of the climax of Mary's role as Coredemptnx comes from the inspired words of Simeon at the presentation of the infant Lord to the Temple (cf. Lk 2:25-37).\n\nIt is again by the power and sustenance of the Holy Spirit (cf. Lk 2:26-27) that Mary receives the prophetic message of Simeon foretelling the climactic sharing by the Mother of Jesus in the price of Redemption.\n\n\"Inspired by the Spirit\"(Lk 2:27), Simeon came into the temple and took the infant Redeemer in his arms, proclaiming,\n\n\"Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen the salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all the peoples\" (Lk 2:29-31).\n\nSimeon's inspired words about the future Redeemer correspond to the meaning of the name given to him by the angel, \"Jesus\", which means \"God is salvation\"[53]. The redemptive mission of the child Jesus was also made known to the temple prophetess Anna, who \"gave thanks to God and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem\"(Lk 2:38).\n\nThe elderly prophet then addressed the Mother of the Redeemer.\n\n\"Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, 'Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be contradicted' (Lk 2:34).\"\n\nAnd with particular attention to Mary, Simeon prophetically states: \"and a sword will pierce through your own heart, too\" (Lk 2:35).\n\nThis sorrowful annunciation to the Mother of the Saviour confirms that her intimate sharing in the redemptive work of her Son will be at the price of profound suffering, and will lead her in the obedience of faith to the side of the suffering Redeemer. John Paul II tells us:\n\n\"Simeon's words seem like a second Annunciation to Mary, for they tell her of the actual historical situation in which the Son is to accomplish his mission, namely, in misunderstanding and sorrow. While this announcement, on the one hand, confirms her faith in the accomplishment of the divine promises of salvation, on the other hand, it also reveals to her that she will have to live her obedience of faith in suffering, at the side of the suffering Saviour, and that her motherhood will be mysterious and sorrowful.\"[54]\n\nJust as Mary anticipated her Son's stainless entry into the human family by her Immaculate Conception, so too did the Mother go before her Son in the order of suffering that would lead to the climax of Redemption on the Cross. The coredeeming Mother of the Saviour was eternally predestined [55] to sacrifice and suffering in her election by the Heavenly Father. And from the time of her joyful and sorrowful announcements (cf Lk 1:28, Lk 2:35), Mary anticipated her Son's redemptive suffering at Calvary in her motherly heart. \"Where Mary is, Jesus will soon appear,\"[56] and for the Child destined to suffer, the Mother must also precede. The Mother always went before the Son in the order of suffering.\n\nJn 19:26 - Climax of the Coredemptrix\n\nThe Work of Redemption\n\nJesus Christ, Son of God and Son of Mary, is the Redeemer of all peoples and nations through his passion, death, and resurrection on the cross. Through the sacrifice at Calvary, the Son of Man reconciled humanity with the Father and ransomed us from the true burden of sin. \"In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins\" (Eph. 1:7). It is in the sacrifice of Calvary that \"Christ has bought us back from the curse of the law\" (Gal 3:13). \"The Son of Man came ...to give his life as a ransom for many\" (Mt 20:28); and it is upon the cross that \"a death has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant\" (Heb. 9:15).\n\nThe Old Testament understanding of a \"redeemer\" (Hebrew, \"go'el\") often included the idea of a family member, kinsman, or close relative who was responsible for \"ransoming back from bondage\" another family member (cf. Lev 25:48; Jer. 32:7).[57] Redemption also included the idea of a covenant relationship, where God would act as a \"redeemer\" in ransoming back Israel his \"people\" from Egypt because of his covenant with them:\n\n\"I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burden of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm\" (Ex. 6:6).\n\nThe Old Testament foreshadows a redeemer of men who would be a \"family redeemer\", being the Son of Yahweh, and also a redeemer bringing forth a \"new covenant of my blood\" (Lk 22:19) through \"a death\" that \"has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant\" (Heb. 9:15).\n\nBut here too we see the wisdom of God in having Mary, Mother of the Saviour and Daughter of Zion, intimately involved in the family and covenant act of Redemption.\n\nAs Mother of the Saviour and spiritual \"Mother of the Living,\"[58] Mary rightly has, by maternal relation, an intimate sharing in the familial \"ransoming back\" of her human family with her Son, the Redeemer. As Daughter of Zion, Mary is the faithful and obedient Daughter of Israel who profoundly participates in the new and everlasting covenant between the Father and the new People of God. In both the familial and covenantal aspects of Redemption foreshadowed in the Old Testament, Mary as Mother of the Saviour and spiritual Mother of the Living, as well as the faithful Daughter of Zion, rightly participates in the heart of the New Covenant act of Redemption.\n\nThe Coredemptrix in the Work of Redemption\n\n\"Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary, the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, 'Woman, behold your son!' Then he said to the disciple, 'Son, behold your mother! 'And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own home. After this, knowing that all was now finished...he said, 'It is fmished'; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit\" (Jn 19:26-28, 30).\n\nThe term, \"Woman\" unites the Mother of the Saviour at the foot of the cross with the \"Woman\" of the seed of redemption in Genesis (cf Gen 3 15), who will work with the Redeemer in the triumph over Satan and his seed of sin and death. Mary, who previously was the Handmaid of the Lord at the Annunciation, becomes through the bitter suffering of Calvary the Woman with the Man of Redemption, the Mother with the Son of Salvation, the Lady (Domina) with the Lord (Dominus) of all peoples.\n\n\"Thus the Blessed Virgin advanced in her pilgrimage of faith, and faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross, where she stood in keeping with the divine command endunng with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffenng associated herself with his sacnfice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim which was born of her.\"[59]\n\nThese sublime words of the Council Fathers summarize the rich fruits of the Church's prayerful pondering over nearly two millennia on the scriptural passage of Jn 19:26 and its inspired revelation of Mary's intimate coredemptive role with the Redeemer.\n\nPapal Teaching on the Coredemptrix at Calvary\n\n\"The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God, whether in its written form or in its oral form of Tradition, has been entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church alone.\"[60]\n\nAnd with the profound Johannine passage, Jn 19:26, of the written word of God, the teaching office (Magisterium) of the Church has provided a rich and inspired interpretation which manifests the Marian mystery of Coredemptnx.\n\nThis deeper and fuller understanding of the inspired text of John 19:26 regarding Mary's role as Coredemptrix as taught by the Church is the rich fruit of a greater penetration into the Patristic understanding of Mary as the New Eve; as well by the contributions of Church Fathers, Doctors, Mystics, and Saints, including St. Bernard of Clairvaux,[61] St. Bonaventure,[62] St. Albert the Great,[63] and John Tauler.[64] These and numerous other Church writers, leading through the Middle Ages and up to the Modern period,[65] represent aids to the teaching Church, which \"at the divine command and with the help of the Holy Spirit...faithfully expounds\" [66] the Word of God. All these ecclesial sources have contributed in their own way and collectively to a greater unraveling of Mary's role as the \"Coredemptrix\"[67] as taught by the Church.\n\nThe modern papal commentary on Jn. 19:26 with regard to Mary's intimate cooperation with the Redeemer at Calvary in the work of Redemption provides a treasure of authoritative and theological insight in grasping the fullest meaning of this inspired text of Sacred Scripture. The fruitful combination of authoritative consistency, as well as individual theological contribution in development, make this series of papal statements a wellspring of the \"authentic interpretation of the Word of God\" [68] concerning Mary's coredemptive role at the foot of the cross.\n\nIn the Papal teaching of Leo XIII (1878-1903, [69] we see that Mary freely offered her dying Son in obedience to the justice of the Father, beginning at the temple and climaxing at the cross, where she intimately shared with the Redeemer by \"dying with Him in her heart\" in painfully atoning for the sins of humanity:\n\n\"When Mary offered herself completely to God together with her Son in the temple, she was already sharing with Him the painful atonement on behalf of the human race. It is certain, therefore, that she suffered in the very depths of her soul with His most bitter sufferings and with His torments. Finally, it was before the eyes of Mary that the Divine Sacrifice for which she had borne and nurtured the victim, was to be finished...we see that there stood by the Cross of Jesus His Mother, who in a miracle of charity, so that she might receive us as her sons, willingly offered Him up to divine justice, dying with Him in her heart, pierced by the sword of sorrow.\"[70]\n\nPope Leo XIII further teaches the Christian faithful that Mary was the \"cooperatrix\" (the female cooperator or \"co-worker\" with Christ) in the Redemption of humanity, and therefore would likewise be the intimate cooperator in the distribution of the graces of Redemption: \"...she who had been the cooperatrix in the sacrament of man's Redemption, would be likewise the cooperatrix in the dispensation of graces deriving from it.\"[71] In this statement, Leo XIII establishes Mary's coredemptive role in the act of acquiring the graces of Redemption, as well as a consequential role with the Redeemer in the future conveying of these graces to the human family.\n\nPope St. Pius X (1903-1914) confirms the doctrine of Mary's coredemptive role, as well as adding greater specificity in regards to the merit of the Mother of the Redeemer for her cooperation in the redemption.\n\n\"Owing to the union of suffering and purpose existing between Christ and Mary, she merited to become most worthily the reparatrix of the lost world, and for this reason, the dispenser of all the favors which Jesus acquired for us by His death and His blood. Nevertheless, because she surpasses all in holiness and in union with Christ, and because she was chosen by Christ to be His partner in the work of human salvation, she merits for us de congruo, as they say, that which Christ merits for us de condigno, and she is the principal dispenser of the graces to be distributed.\"[72]\n\nApart from the papal references to the distribution of graces by Mary (which will be discussed in the following chapter), St. Pius X designates Mary as the chosen partner of Christ in the work of redemption, and due to her unified suffering and purpose with the Redeemer, Mary became the \"reparatrix,\" the female restorer with Christ, of the world lost by sin.\n\nSt. Pius X further establishes that due to Mary's unique union with Christ in suffering and the redemptive purpose, this chosen partner of Christ in the work of redemption merits graces for the human family in the order of what is fitting or appropriate (de congruo) that which our Lord merits for us in the order of justice (de condigno).\n\nThe human family is \"justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus\"(Rom. 3:24).The God-man alone merits the graces necessary for the redemption of the world in strict justice, with an equality between his meritorious sacrifice on the cross and the reward of the graces of salvation.[73] But it is also fitting or appropriate that the Father in his generosity of grace should reward the chosen Mother of the Saviour who cooperated and suffered with the Redeemer in the work of salvation.[74] \"For he will render to every man according to his works\" (Rom. 2:6), and St. Pius X [75] rightfully teaches that the work of the Woman with her redeeming Son merited graces for her exiled children at least in the order of fittingness [76] in light of the graciousness of the Father, who is \"rich in mercy\" (Eph. 2:4).\n\nPope Benedict XV(1914-1922) not only confirms the doctrine of Mary's Coredemption as taught by the modern popes, but articulates this Marian truth with even greater clarity.\n\n\"...The fact that she was with her Son crucified and dying, was in accord with the divine plan. To such extent did she [Mary] suffer and almost die with her suffering and dying Son; to such extent did she surrender her maternal rights over her Son for man's salvation, and immolated Him - insofar as she could - in order to appease the justice of God, that we may rightly say she redeemed the human race together with Christ.\"[77]\n\nMary intensely shared the price of ransom (cf. Mt 20:28) with the Redeemer, almost to the point of her own death. This is the chosen vocation of the coredeeming Mother of the Saviour in light of her motherly relation and union with the \"Sacrifice\" offered for our salvation. For \"...taking not the blood of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption\" (Heb 9:13), Christ was the new covenant sacrifice offered for our salvation. And Mary, as Mother of the Victim, obediently offered her sublime motherly rights of nature and grace in relation to her Son to the heavenly Father in performing her subordinate role with Christ in appeasing the infinite justice of the Father (cf. 1Cor 1:30). Mary freely and obediently offered Jesus as Mother [78] to the heavenly Father for the salvation of her spiritual sons and daughters (cf. Jn 19:26).\n\nPope Pius XI(1922-1939) continues the rich teaching of the Magisterium on the doctrine of Mary's Coredemption. Pius XI repeatedly referred to Mary under the title of \"Coredemptrix,\" and here invokes the Coredemptnx who suffered with the Redeemer to preserve in us the spiritual fruits of the Lord's redemption and Mary's compassion (\"suffering with\"):\n\n\"O Mother of love and mercy who, when thy sweetest Son was consummating the Redemption of the human race on the altar of the cross, did stand next to Him, suffering with Him as a Coredemptrix...,preserve in us, we beseech thee, and increase day by day the precious fruit of His redemption and the compassion of His Mother.\"[79]\n\nAgain, Pius XI states:\n\n\"She brought forth Jesus the Redeemer, fed Him, offered Him as a victim at the cross, by her hidden union with Christ, and an altogether singular grace from Him, was likewise the Reparatrix....\"[80]\n\nPius Xl's papal repetition manifests the coredeeming Mother's meritorious offering of her Son the \"victim\" as the price for our redemption (cf. 1Cor 6:20). But Pius XI also refers to the \"altogether singular grace\" Mary received from the Redeemer to be the female restorer at the side of the New Adam. The Coredemptrix received the altogether singular grace to cooperate uniquely with the Redeemer from the Redeemer, to whom the Coredemptrix was always subordinate to and dependent upon.[81]\n\nPope Pius XI clearly establishes the just invocation of Mary under the title of Coredemptrix for her coredeeming role with her Saviour Son:\n\n\"From the nature of His work the Redeemer ought to have associated His Mother with His work. For this reason we invoke her under the title of Coredemptrix. She gave us the Savior, she accompanied Him in the work of Redemption as far as the Cross itself, sharing with Him the sorrows of the agony and of the death in which Jesus consummated the Redemption of mankind. And immediately beneath the Cross, at the last moments of His life, she was proclaimed by the Redeemer as our Mother, the Mother of the whole universe.\"[82]\n\nPius XII(1939-1958) generously continues the papal teaching on the doctrine of Mary's Coredemptive role at Calvary in several teachings of the Church's Magisterium. Pius XII profoundly integrates the Patristic understanding of Mary as the New Eve with her climaxing Coredemptive role at the foot of the cross.\n\n\"It was she [Mary] who, always most intimately united with her Son, like a New Eve, offered Him on Golgotha to the Eternal Father, together with the sacrifice of her maternal rights and love, on behalf of all the children of Adam, stained by the latter's shameful fall.\"[83]\n\nThe New Eve intimately shared and suffered with the New Adam in the saving sacrifice of Calvary, which constitutes the climax of the work of redemption on behalf of us, the \"children of Adam.\" The New Eve of the Fathers reaches her fullness as the Coredemptrix at Calvary, suffers with the Redeemer in her motherly heart, and offers her Son's bitter passion along with her own maternal compassion,\n\nbecoming \"the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole human race.\"[84] \"Death through Eve, life through Mary.\" [85]\n\nPius XII continues at another place:\n\n\"Are not Jesus and Mary the two sublime loves of the Christian people? Are they not the new Adam and the new Eve whom the tree of the cross unites in sorrow and in love in order to make satisfaction for the guilt of our first parents in Eden?\"[86]\n\nPius XII specifies the role of Mary, the New Eve at the \"tree of the cross\" (cf. Jn 19:26) for the purpose of making \"satisfaction\" for the guilt of humanity. The sublime association between the Coredemptrix and the Redeemer in the mystery of Redemption is attested to by Pius XII in these words:\n\n\"For having been associated with the King of Martyrs in the ineffable work of human redemption, as Mother and cooperatrix, she remains forever associated with Him, with an almost unlimited power, in the distribution of graces which flow from the Redemption.\"[87]\n\nThe Second Vatican Council, under the pontificates of John XXIII (1958-1962) and Paul VI (1963-1978) gave conciliar strength and confirmation to the consistent ordinary Magisterial teachings of the modern popes regarding the coredemptive role of Mary.\n\n\"She devoted herself totally, as handmaid of the Lord, to the person and work of her Son, under him and with him, serving the mystery of redemption, by the grace of almighty God....This union of the mother with the Son in the work of salvation is made manifest from the time of Christ's virginal conception up to his death.\"[88]\n\nIn clear confirmation of the Jn. 19:26 interpretation of the modern papal predecessors (as manifested both in text and footnotes [89]), the Second Vatican Council teaches Mary's coredemptive suffering and offering with the Redeemer at the foot of the cross in section 58 of Lumen Gentium (Dogmatic Constitution on the Church). Mary \"faithfully persevered in union with her Son unto the cross, where she stood, in keeping with the divine plan.\"[90] Mary's coredemptive cooperation at Calvary was in obedience to the will of God, who desired a New Eve along side of the New Adam.\n\nThe Council further teaches in section 58 that it was Mary who was \"enduring with her only begotten Son the intensity of his suffering.\" The Coredemptnx suffered with the Redeemer, enduring with her Son almost to the point of death [91] the intensity of the price of ransom (cf Mt 10:45). She \"associated herself with his sacrifice in her mother's heart, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of this victim which was born of her.\" This conciliar teaching echoes the papal teaching of Benedict XV[92] and Pius XII [93] in ascribing to Mary at Calvary a profound sharing in the redemptive sacrifice in her motherly heart. And as Mother, Mary offered her Son as saving victim to the Father to satisfy God's infinite justice.\n\n\"Finally, she was given by the same Christ Jesus dying on the cross as a mother to his disciple, with these words: 'Woman, behold your son' (Jn 19:26-27).\" The last words of the dying Christ to the Woman announces the near end of her coredemptive suffering on Calvary, as well as the fruit of this climax of her association with the Redeemer. The Coredemptrix who \"shared in her Son's sufferings as he died on the cross...\" and who in a wholly singular way \"cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope, and burning charity in the work of the Saviour in restoring supernatural life to souls,\" was rightfully rewarded by the Redeemer before leaving the cross and returning to the Father as the \"mother to us in the order of grace.\"[94]\n\nJohn Paul II and in 19:26 - \"The Coredemptrix\"\n\nPope John Paul II has made contemporary in certain and generous fashion the consistent Magisterial teaching on the role and doctrine of the \"Coredemptrix.\"[95]\n\n\"In her [Mary], the many and intense sufferings were amassed in such an interconnected way that they were not only a proof of her unshakable faith, but also a contribution to the Redemption of all.... It was on Calvary that Mary's suffering, beside the suffering of Jesus, reached an intensity which can hardly be imagined from a human point of view, but which was mysteriously and supernaturally fruitful for the Redemption of the world. Her ascent of Calvary and her standing at the foot of the cross together with the beloved disciple were a special sort of sharing in the redeeming death of her Son.\"[96]\n\nThe Holy Father points out that the suffering of Mary at Calvary, which \"reached an intensity which can hardly be imagined from a human point of view\" was truly efficacious and grace-giving for our Redemption. The Coredemptrix participated in a \"special sort of sharing in the redeeming death\" of the Redeemer.\n\nJohn Paul II teaches in another place:\n\n\"As a witness to her Son's passion by her presence, and as a sharer in it by her compassion, Mary offered a unique contribution to the Gospel of suffering, by embodying in anticipation, the expression of St. Paul,. ..she truly has a special title to be able to claim that she 'completes in her flesh' - as already in her heart - 'what is lacking in the suffering of Christ'.\"[97]\n\nWe have in these words of John Paul II a monumental exposition of Jn 19:26 and the ineffable sharing of the Coredemptrix in the suffering of Calvary. By Mary's witness to Christ's passion and by her own compassion ( cum passio, \"suffering with\"), the Coredemptrix suffered not only in her motherly heart, but also in her bodywith the Redeemer. By \"embodying in anticipation,\" the expression of St. Paul, the Coredemptrix truly \"has a special title to be able to claim that she 'completes in her flesh'- as already in her heart - 'what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ'\"(cf. Col. 1:24).\n\nIn the sufferings of Calvary, both spiritually and bodily, the Lady (Domina) shared with the Lord (Dominus) of Redemption.\n\nThe Holy Father further specifies Mary's complete coredemptive abandonment at Calvary:\n\n\"On that wood of the Cross her Son hangs in agony as one condemned. ...How great, how heroic then is the obedience of faith shown by Mary in the face of God's 'unsearchable judgements'! How completely she 'abandons herself to God' without reserve, 'offering the full assent of her intellect and will' to him whose 'ways are inscrutable' (cf. Rom 11:33)! And how powerful too is the action of grace in her soul, how all-pervading is the influence of the Holy Spirit and his light and power!\"[98]\n\nIn the above quoted passage from his Marian encyclical entitled, \"Mother of the Redeemer\" (Redemptoris Mater), John Paul II also properly acknowledged the role of the Holy Spirit, the Divine Spouse of Mary, whose grace and power have sustained Mary throughout her coredemptive function with the Redeemer. It is by the power and grace of the Holy Spirit that Mary was conceived immaculate (cf. Gen 3:15, Lk 1 :28) so as to give the Redeemer a selfsame immaculate nature; that she was made fruitful in conceiving the Redeemer in her womb by the overshadowing of her Heavenly Spouse (cf. Lk 1:35); and that she was foretold of the climax of her role as Coredemptrix with the sword piercing her own heart (cf. Lk 2:35) by the prophetic power of the Spirit of Truth (cf. Lk 2:26-27).\n\nSo too at the foot of the Cross, it is the \"influence of the Holy Spirit in his light and power\" that is \"all-pervading\" in the soul of Mary that sustains and fills the Sorrowful Virgin with the grace to follow the divine plan for her as the Coredemptrix with the Redeemer.\n\nJohn Paul also incorporates the Canticle of Kenosis (Phil 2:5-11) in describing the self-emptying at Calvary for the Mother of Jesus as\n\n\"perhaps the deepest 'kenosis' of faith in human history\": \"Through this faith Mary is perfectly united with Christ in his self-emptying. For 'Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men': precisely on Golgotha 'humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross' (cf. Phil 2: 5-8). At the foot of the Cross, Mary shares through faith in the shocking mystery of this self-emptying. This is perhaps the deepest 'kenosis' of faith in human history. Through faith the Mother shares in the death of her Son, in his redeeming death.\"[99]\n\nMoreover, John Paul refers to the \"spiritual crucifixion\" of Mary in her coredemptive role at Calvary:\n\n\"Crucified spiritually with her crucified Son (cf. Gal 2:20), she contemplated with heroic love the death of her God, she 'lovingly consented to the immolation of this Victim which she herself had brought forth' (Lumen Gentium, 58). She fulfills the will of the Father on our behalf and accepts all of us as her children, in virtue of the testament of Christ: 'Woman, there is your son' (Jn 19:26).\"[100]\n\nIt was indeed a \"spiritual crucifixion\" for the Woman at the foot of the cross. It is right, therefore, that in light of this most intimate suffering with the Redeemer at Calvary, that the Coredemptrix would also be rewarded with the full gift of spiritual motherhood to the People of God whom she \"redeemed together with Christ.\" [101]\n\nIt is in fact the profound continuation after Calvary of the role of Mary Coredemptrix as \"Mediatrix\"[102] and \"Advocate\" [103] for the People of God that Pope John Paul II refers to when he declares that \"Mary's role as Coredemptrix did not cease with the glorification of her Son.\" [104]Summary\n\nMary, the humble handmaid of the Lord was chosen by the Father and sustained by the Holy Spirit in fulfilling her God-elected task with her redeeming Son as the Coredemptrix (\"co\" not meaning \"equal to\", but rather \"with\"). She was foreshadowed as the Coredemptrix in the Old Testament (cf. Gen 3:15; Is 7:14) and became the Coredemptrix with her obedient and free consent at the Annunciation (cf. Lk 1:28). The climax of her role as Coredemptrix with the Redeemer was prophesied to her by the power of the Holy Spirit at the Temple (cf. Lk 2:35). And she who began as Mary, Virgin of Nazareth, became the Coredemptrix in its fullest expression through her intimate cooperation and intense suffering with the Redeemer at the foot of the cross (cf. Jn 19:26).\n\nAs gift to the Coredemptrix for her sharing with the Redeemer in the redemption of the human family, Mary also becomes Mediatrix and Advocate for her children in the order of grace. Pope John Paul II concludes, \"Mary's role as Coredemptrix did not cease with the glorification of her Son.\"[105]\n\nWe end with a fourteenth century liturgical hymn to Mary Coredemptrix:\n\nLoving, sweet, and kind,\n\nWholly undeserving of any sorrow,\n\nIf henceforth you chose weeping,\n\nAs one suffering with the Redeemer,\n\nFor the captive sinner,\n\nCoredemptrix would you be [106]\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n22.

Note: Although St. Bernard's commentary was not specifically directed to the Jn 19:26 passage, his contribution regarding Mary's \"offering of the Victim to the Father\" rightly includes St. Bernard in the development of the understanding of Mary's coredemptive role at the cross.\n\n62. Cf. St. Bonaventure (d. 1274), Collatio 6 de donis Spiritus Sancti, n. 5, n. 15, n. 16, n. 17; Opera Omnia, (Ad Claras Aquas), v. 5, p. 486; Sermo 3 de Assumptione, Opera Omnia, v.9, p. 695; III Sent., dist. 4, a. 3, qu. 3, concl.; Opera Omnia, v. 3, p. 115. For example: \"Just as they [Adam and Eve] were the destroyers of the human race, so these [Jesus and Mary] were its repairers...\" (Sermo 3): \"She [Mary] also merited reconciliation for the entire human race ...\"(III Sent); \"She paid the price [of Redemption] as a woman brave and loving - namely, when Christ suffered on the cross to pay that price in order to purge and wash and redeem us, the Blessed Virgin was present, accepting and agreeing with the divine will\" (n. 16).\n\n63. Cf. St. Albert the Great (d. 1280), Comment. in Matth., I, 18; Opera Omnia, ed., Borgnet, Vol.20, Paris, 1898, p. 36; St. Albert or \"Pseudo-Albert\", Mariale, Q. 42, Opera Omnia, v. 37, p. 81; Q. 150, p. 219; Q. 51, p. 97. For example:\n\n\"To her [Mary] alone was given this privilege, namely, a communication in the Passion; to her the Son willed to communicate the merit of the Passion, in order that He could give her the reward; and in order to make her a sharer in the benefit of Redemption, He willed that she be a sharer in the penalty of the Passion, in so far as she might become the Mother of all through re-creation even as she was the adjutrix of the Redemption by her co-passion. And just as the whole world is bound to God by His supreme Passion, so also it is bound to the Lady of all by her copassion\"(Q. 150).\n\n64. Cf. John Tauler (d. 1361), Sermo pro festo Purificationis Beatae Mariae Virginis; Oeûvres complètes, vol.6, Paris, 1911, ed., E. P. Noel, p. 253,-255; p. 256, p. 259. For example: \"God accepted her oblation [on Calvary] as a pleasing sacrifice for the utility and salvation of the whole human race...\"(p. 253); \"He foretold to thee [Mary] all thy passion whereby He would make thee a sharer of all of His merits and afflictions, and thou would co-operate with Him in the restoration of men to salvation...\"(p. 256).\n\n65. For a more comprehensive treatment of Mary's Coredemptive role at Calvary trom the post-Patristic period through the Middle Ages and up to the Modern Period, see Roschini, Maria Santissima Nella Storia Della Salvezza, p. 179; J. B. Carol, De Corredemptione Beatae Virginis Mariae, p. 151.\n\n66. Vatican Council II, Dei Verbum, n. 10.\n\n67. Apart from the numerous references to Mary's Coredemptive role with Christ before this time (see Footnotes 40 and 41), the first recorded use of the title, \"Coredemptrix\" appears to date back to the fourteenth century, for example, in the liturgical book found in St. Peter's in Salzburg, with the verses:\n\n'Pia, dulcis et benigna\n\nNullo prorsus luctu digna\n\nSifletum hinc eligeres\n\nUt compassa Redemptori,\n\nCaptivato transgressori\n\nTu Corredemetrix fieres. Loving, sweet, and kind,\n\nWholly undeserving of any sorrow,\n\nIf henceforth you chose weeping,\n\nAs one suffering with the Redeemer,\n\nFor the captive sinner,\n\nCoredemptrix would you be.\n\nCf. Oratione of St. Peter's in Salzburg, in Dreves-Blume, Analecta hymnica medii aevi, v. 46, n. 79, p. 126; Cf. PLanctus oratius...ad B. Virginem Filium de cruce depositum sinu tenentem, in R. Laurentin, Le tître de Coredemptrice, Etude\n\nhistorique in Marianum, 13, 1951, p. 429.\n\n68. Cf Vatican Council II Dei Verbum n 10\n\n69. Note Pope Pius IX more generally begins the papal references to Mary's ~\n\nLoredemptive roie in Ineffabilis Deus (1854), when he relers to Mary as the \"parentum Reparatricem\" (\"Reparatrix [secondary restorer] of parents\") in reference to Adam and Eve in the teachings of the Church Fathers.\n\n70. Pope Leo XIII. Encyclical Letter, Jucunda Semper, 1894, Acta Sanctae Sedis (ASS) v.27, p. 178.\n\n71. Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical Letter, Adjutricem populi, 1895, ASS. v. 28, p. 130.\n\n72. Pope St. Pius X, Encyclical LetterAd diem illum, 1904, ASS., v.36, 1903-1904, p. 453.\n\n73. Meritum de condigno (condign merit) ex toto rigore justitiae (equality between the meritorious action and its reward, as well as between the persons giving and receiving the reward) is a type of merit (\"a right to a reward\") that can be obtained only by Jesus Christ in light of his divine nature. The redemptive act by Jesus Christ on the cross was both satisfactory (removing the relationship of guilt between the human race and God) and meritorious (establishing a right to a reward from Almighty God, which is always at the same time presupposing a gift of grace from God). Cf. Council of Trent, D 799, D 809,810; J. B. Carol, O.F.M., \"Our Lady's Coredemption\" in Mariology, Bruce Pub., 1957, v. 2, p. 410.\n\n74.Meritum de congruo (congruous merit) is a right to a reward based on its appropriateness or fittingness, along with the generosity of the person granting the reward. In light of Mary's unique participation with Christ in Redemption and the graciousness of the Father, such de congruo merit is rightfully attributed by St. Pius X to Mary.\n\n75. For Church references to the title \"Coredemptrix\" under the pontificate of St. Pius X, see Sacred Congregation of Rites, 13 May 1908, AAS 41,1908, p. 408; Holy\n\nOffice, Decree of 26 June 1913, MS 5,19 13, p. 364; Holy Office, Decree of 22\n\nJanuary 1914, AAS6, 1914, p. 108\n\n76. The Magisterial statement by Pope St. Pius X regarding Mary's merit de congruo should serve as an authoritative aurea media in veritate (golden mean in truth) in the debates over the nature and degree of Mary's merit as Coredemptrix. Without saying the last word on whether or not Mary also merited de digno, de supercongruo. or de condignoex mera condignitate. (just as the dogma of the Assumntion did not say the last word concerning the debate over the \"Death\" of Mary), St. Pius X's statement should serve as an authoritative confirmation that Mary at least merited de congruo as Christ merited de condigno, and as such represents a unified doctrinal statement regarding the question of Mary's coredemptive merit.\n\n77. Pope Benedict XV, Apostolic Letter Inter Sodalicia,1918, AAS 10, 1918, p. 182.\n\n78. Mary's offering of Jesus at the foot of the cross should be understood fundamentally as an offering in virtue of her singularly graced motherhood, and in virtue of her priesthood of the laity which is shared by all those baptised in faith and grace. The reference here to Mary's offering should not be construed to refer to Mary's individual offering of sacrifice in a true and proper sense, as understood in the reality of ordained priesthood.\n\n79.
