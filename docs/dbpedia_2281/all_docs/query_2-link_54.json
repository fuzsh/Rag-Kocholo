        "text": "Capitol Construction Timeline\n\nCentennial Abbreviated Outlines\n\nBob Priddy – 12/23/13\n\nNov. 8, 1910, voters reject bond issue for new Capitol\n\nSunday, Feb. 5, 1911, Fire destroys building (all times are approximate, drawn from various sources)\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nFather Joseph Selinger, leaving St. Mary’s Hospital, sees storm blowing in.\n\n6 p.m. (approximate)\n\nFirst Lady Agnes Hadley in mansion thinks lightning has hit mansion. Hits capitol instead.\n\nPardon Attorney W. L. Chambers, who was in the governor’s office, telephones the mansion that the capitol is on fire. Governor Hadley is entertaining about thirty newspapermen at the time at the mansion.\n\nThe city fire alarm bell rings. Local departments under Chief Ed Gray respond with their hose carts from the Central Station in the basement of City Hall at Monroe and High Streets, from the Richmond Hill Volunteer Department at 116 Bolivar Street, the Muenichberg department at the corner of Dunklin and Washington, and the hose shed at Clark Avenue and Miller Streets. Fire horses King and Dick, at the main station, trained to run under a “swinging harness” at the sound of the fire bell, immediately respond.\n\nGovernor Hadley telephones Warden Henry Andrae at the state penitentiary, tells him to bring all guards he can spare. Orders Adjutant General Frank M. Rumbold to call out Company L, Second Infantry Regiment of the state militia.\n\nGovernor calls local Missouri Pacific superintendent, who sends squad of railroad employees to help the fire fighters. Every foot of hose that can be found in the city is taken to the scene.\n\nHadley, after consulting with local architect Fred Binder about the safety of the burning building, runs with Binder to his office, instructing private secretary Charles Thompson, his stenographer, Mrs. Mary Leo, Pardon Attorney Chambers, and Sam Haley, another stenographer, to get everything together and be ready to move although he felt the fire could still be brought under control.\n\nOther state officers arrive at their offices with their department clerks, janitors and volunteers.\n\nA steady stream of legislators filing up and down the stairs, carrying books and papers out, dumping them on the lawn.\n\nSenate Secretary Robert McClintic is one of the first officials of the legislature to decide the battle would be lost. He saves every record he can. Senators and clerks save all the important senate records. When the senate records start moving out, other state officials start their efforts.\n\nCompany L, members wearing khaki and rubber service coats, arrive about the same time Deputy Warden Gilvin arrives with 12 negro convicts.\n\nState officials go to the capitol and begin organizing records for removal in case fire cannot be stopped. Secretary of State one of the first in the building.\n\nFor half an hour “the flames unchecked ate into the bid dome and then crawled around it down to the roof of the central, or main, building.”\n\nHenry J. Vetter, Frank Kuntz and Arthur Scruggs among the men who climbed into the dome with Chief Ed Gray, stringing a hose with them, getting as close as possible. The fire drives them back step by step to the main floor, where hoses were turned onto the building from the outside.\n\n6:45 p.m.\n\nDome crashes through into the corridor below, covering the great seal of the state inlaid on the main floor under the dome.\n\nHouse chamber is the first of the legislative halls to go. An effort was made to save oil paintings of McKinley, Garfield, Lincoln, Benton and Jefferson, but none could be saved.\n\nSen. M. E. Casey stays in Senate chamber at great risk to rescue paintings of Thomas Jefferson and others.\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nSecretary of State orders the historic land records dating from the days of the French, be removed from his office. Also orders the Great Seal moved. Senator-elect Reed and Senator F. M. Wilson respond by forming a long line stretching from the Capitol to the supreme court building, passing books and records from one hand to another. In less than 40 minutes the last of them had been removed except those things in the fireproof time vault. A good thing because at 9:10, the situation suddenly got worse. :\n\nPolice officers under Chief Richter, patrol the halls, keeping idle spectators out of the way of those who were working, preventing doors and steps leading to the building from being blockaded.\n\nPiles and piles of books were handed along lines. Fully two-thirds of the male population of Jefferson City and all the members of the legislature and employees in the city helped save what “they all knew to be exceedingly valuable property.”\n\n“Desks were tumbled down the long stairways leading to the building, books were thrown about topsy turvy and in thirty minutes the south side of the capitol park was an indiscriminate mass of books, papers and furniture. Wagons drove back and forth gathering up load after load, and long rows of men carried the removable property into the old Supreme Court building, where they will be kept for the present. “\n\nIn the line of workers were many women and girls employed in state depts.. Miss Mary Lee, Mrs. Annie Baxter and Pauline Roach, of the secretary of state’s office, were among those who worked heroically. “They knew from experience with the records just what to take and what to leave. There were few idlers about the buildings.\n\nP. Evans, state superintendent of schools, got all the valuable records from his office and several desks but the library was destroyed.\n\nThe insurance Department, the first of the state offices to burn, was entered by the Superintendent and his forces who got the more important papers out.\n\nTreasurer’s office, records all removed, and four streams of water were kept constantly playing all night on the big vault where money, bonds and legislative scrip were stored.\n\nSecond floor, well-cleared of valuable records by the time the roof fell in on the house and senate.\n\nThe governor’s quarters and offices of the secretary of state were last.\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nWooden timbers supporting metal sheathing crumble and the upper dome falls onto north side of the buildings, setting fire to roof of the House of Representatives. Timbers also fall to floor of rotunda, covering inlaid state seal.\n\n8:43 p.m.\n\nMayor John F. “King” Heinrichs, calls Sedalia mayor J. W. Mellor asking to use the Sedalia fire department. The huge steam engine and hose cart from company #2 are pulled to the MOPAC depot where they waited for a special train. (see 10:18)\n\n9:10 p.m.\n\nRoofs of both wings collapse about the same time. Governor, other officials, and volunteers flee for their lives.\n\nJoseph Frank, volunteer fireman, carried from the building half suffocated, but revives when reaches the air. Senate Secretary R. S. McClintic and his clerks carrying out senate records when a skylight collapsed over their heads. McClintic escapes injury by grabbing a tin bucket to use as a helmet to protect himself from flying glass. Others use willow baskets but a few are still cut.\n\n10:18 p.m.\n\nTrain made up of locomotive and tender, two flat cars for equipment, a coach for the firemen, newsmen and a few others, and a caboose leaves Sedalia with fire equipment and crew, Chief W. H. Paul and four men . Conductor Walter Mann and Trainmaster C. M. Hunt in charge. John Overmier was the engineer. The train carries the steam engine pump and a hose cart from Sedalia Fire Company #2. MOPAC gave it the right of way all the way to Jefferson City. Engineer Overmier pulls the throttle wide open….cover the 65 miles in 74 minutes. Arrive 11:32 p.m.\n\n4 a.m.\n\nThe water main breaks in the 800 block of West Main Street, perhaps caused by a stone wall falling on a fire hose, causing back pressure that might have caused the break. However Jefferson City resident John Sturm remembered the water company put heavy pressure from the pumping station near the river and it was more than the line could bear.\n\nGov Hadley personally directed the small army of legislators, National Guardsmen, volunteer firemen and convicts. He was assisted by US Senator-elect James A. Reed, warden Henry Andrae of the penitentiary, AG Frank M. Rumbold, and all department chiefs.\n\nMonday, Feb. 6, 1911\n\n8 a.m.\n\nSedalia FD returns home after being served breakfast at the Madison House Hotel, praising “King” Heinrichs, the mayor of JC, and the entire people of JC. Sedalia newspaper reported the cost to the state of the special train was $126.\n\nLegislature convenes, the Senate in the Cole County Courthouse, the House in the Jefferson City Theatre (also known as the Jefferson Opera House.) After this day the Senate moves to the Supreme Court Building, Division II and the House moves to St. Peters Hall.\n\nGovernor Hadley sends special message to legislature saying it has no power to change the location of the capital city unless the state constitution is changed through a public vote.\n\n12 p.m.\n\nJonas Viles, University of Missouri history professor, arrives by train from Columbia, asks for permission to remove water-soaked and frozen papers to State Historical Society in Columbia.\n\nTuesday, Feb. 7, 2011, Water supply restored.
