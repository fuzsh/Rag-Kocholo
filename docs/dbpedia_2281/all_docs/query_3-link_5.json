        "text": "It was the Superior General, Father Bernard Mary Silvestrelli, C.P., who accepted the request of Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney, for the Passionists to come to Sydney, Australia, in 1887.\n\nBlessed Bernard Mary Silvestrelli, C.P., was born Caesar Peter Silvestrelli on 7th November 1831 in the house at number 38, Minerva Place in Rome\n\nHe was baptised the same day in the Church of Santa Maria in Minerva, Rome. The Silvestrelli family tomb is in this Church\n\nCaesar was 17 years old when his mother died and 22 years old when his father died. At his father’s funeral there were 120 Franciscans, 40 Dominicians and 80 Capuchins\n\nFrom 1840 to 1847 he attended the Roman College of the Jesuits\n\nIn 1853, the year after his father’s death, St. Paul of the Cross was Beatified\n\nOn 21st February 1854 he entered the Passionists at Sts. John and Paul in Rome\n\nOn 21st March 1854 he departed Sts. John and Paul for his novitiate in Monte Argentario\n\nOn 7th April 1854 he received the Passionist habit at Monte Argentario\n\nBefore long the Novitiate records read: “Silvestrelli left on 3rd May 1854 because this life was totally wearisome for him and he was overcome with sadness”\n\nHe asked to be allowed to remain as a guest of the community in Presentation Retreat, Monte Argentario, while he continued his studies for the priesthood. He studied under Father Pacifico of St. Joseph and wore the ecclesiastical habit\n\nFrom 31st June to 24th August 1855 he lived in the retreatants wing at Sts. John and Paul in Rome\n\nOn 22nd December 1855 he was ordained a priest by Bishop Molajoni\n\nAs an expression of his gratitude for their hospitality Bernard, at his own expense, restored the Chapel of the Crucified in the Church of the Presentation, Monte Argentario and built a new chapel in honour of St. Paul of the Cross\n\nBernard rejoined the Passionists and went to Morrovale for a Novitiate in 1856\n\nOn 27th April 1856 he received the habit again for the second time and became Bernard Mary of Jesus\n\nHe was professed a Passionist on 28th April 1857\n\nAs a sign of gratitude to the community which had welcomed him and helped him to happily succeed in his desire, Bernard presented the sacristy at Morrovale with two valuable copes, one in cloth of silver and the otherin cloth of gold\n\nIn January 1865 Bernard was chosen as Master of Novices at Scala Santa in Rome\n\nOn 20 September 1867 his brother, Luigi, died with Bernard present. On 23rd September his brother’s body was transferred to the family tomb in the Church of Santa Maria in Minerva, Rome\n\nOn 27th May 1869 Bernard was elected Superior of Scala Santa. He was confirmed for another three years on 14th April 1872\n\nHe was elected First Consultor on 7th June 1875 and moved to Vetralla which at that time was the Provincial Residence\n\nAt the death of the Provincial, Father Pier Giovanni, C.P., in July 1876 Bernard became Provincial\n\nOn 4th May 1878 Bernard was elected Superior General of the Passionists. At the time the Passionists had been in existence for 158 years and were present in 8 nations\n\nBernard Silvestrelli, C.P. as Superior General accepted the request of the Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Moran, for the Passionists to start a foundation in the Archdioecse of Sydney in 1887\n\nThe Passionist General Chapter in 1884 re elected Bernard by acclamation\n\nIn 1888 Bernard resigns as Superior General – “he finds himself weakened in health and weary in spirit and therefore in need of quiet and peace“\n\nOn 2nd January 1889 he communicates his resignation as Superior General to the Congregation\n\nIn August 1890, he went to Monte Argentario to the Retreat of of the Presentation. He chose one of the smallest cells on the Brothers’ corridor and “passed long hours in the church, praying before the Blessed Sacrament“\n\nOn 3rd May 1893 he was elected Superior General once again\n\nThe General Chapter of 1899 confirms Bernard once again on the first vote\n\nIn 1905 he convoked the General Chapter with the imagery of a ship. He considered the Congregation voyaging towards port (the Chapter) in order to take on the supplies it needs for its subsequent voyage and take on a new pilot. The Chapter is a time in port to be refreshed, change pilot and resume its voyage with greater energy\n\nHe reminded Passionists that “love for the institute should be creative“\n\nOn 8th May 1905 the General Chapter re elects him Superior General in the first ballot\n\nBernard develops arthrosis of the spine preventing him from freely moving his neck and legs. He becomes psychologically weary of being so many years caught up in annoyances, troubles and frictions of the Congregation.\n\nOn 7th July 1907 Pope Pius X accepts Bernard’s resignation and assigned him the title of Honorary General as a sign of his great esteem\n\nOn 20th May 1908 the Pope nominated Bernard as President of the General Chapter beginning on 24th May\n\nBernard leaves Sts. John and Paul in Rome on 4th June 1908 for the last time\n\nHe died on 9th December 1911 at the Passionist Monastery at Morricone.\n\n– Notes taken from the book “Bernard Mary Silvestrelli” by Fabiano Giorgini, C.P."
