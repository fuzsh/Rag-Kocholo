        "text": "When he was twenty-one, Dominic received the first direct inkling of what the Lord's plans for his future might be. He writes: \"One of these days (I think it was one of the last of the year 1813) as I was saying my prayers, the idea came to me that God wanted me to be a priest, and that I was to go and bring the light of the Gospel to a foreign nation.\"\n\nAs a Passionist, Vincent was a man of prayer and community observance. He was also a zealous and effective missionary preacher. He helped to develop the methodology for Passionist missionary preaching and also exercised roles of authority and leadership in the congregation. As biographer of the founder he did much to preserve St. Paul’s spirit for future generations.\n\nBlessed Isidore of Saint Joseph, also known as ‘the Brother of the Will of God’ born Isidore de Loor, a lay brother of the Passionist Congregation, born on April 13, 1881 in Vrasene, Belgium; died October 6, 1916 at Kortrijk, Belgium. Beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1984.\n\nIn 1934 the Christian Brothers at the school in Turon asked him to come and hear the confessions of the children of the school. At dawn on Friday October 5th 1934 militiamen forced their way into the Brothers' school. Alongside the Brothers, Father Inocencio was imprisoned, condemned to death, and executed by a firing squad, their bodies buried in a common grave.\n\n“The world lives unmindful of the sufferings of Jesus which are the miracle of miracles of the love of God. We must arouse the world from its slumber.” And so Paul did through thousands of letters he wrote and sermons he preached. Traveling even to marshlands infested with malaria, Paul taught people how to pray and meditate upon the suffering and death of Jesus.\n\nVen. Leonarda of Jesus Crucified, CP, entered the monastery of Passionist Nuns in Ovada, Italy in 1931. In 1947, she was elected superior of the monastery, a position she held until her death in 1953. Under her government, prodigious facts unfolded: during the wartime scarcities in Italy, a dried well continued to give water, and a barrel of flour did not run out! Her confidence in Divine Providence was unmeasured.\n\nBlessed Pius of Saint Aloysius, born Luigi Campidelli, was a religious and clerical student of the Passionist Congregation. He received Minor Orders but was struck down with tuberculosis before he could be ordained priest. He died at 21 years of age on November 2, 1889, offering his life for his troubled home region of Romagna.\n\nThe Passionist Bishop and Martyr Eugene Bossilkov was born November 16, 1900 in Belene (Bulgaria), a village in the Danube Valley. He was executed in the prison (left) at Sophia on the night of November 11, 1952 at 11:30 P.M. His body was thrown into a common grave for criminals; the precise location of his burial place and his body is unknown.\n\nMother Mary Crucified was the superior of the first convent of Passionist Nuns. Through this role and because of her profound sharing in St. Paul's charism she is also called \"co-foundress\" of the Passionists. In 1982 Pope John Paul II approved the document declaring that she had practiced heroic virtue and should be called \"Venerable.\" We await the day of her beatification!\n\nGod raised up Fr. Charles just at the time when Ireland was coming out of the catacombs of 300 years of Protestant persecution. Fr. Charles was a humble man of God who came into the midst of the discouraged, poor and down-trodden Irish people. He performed signs and wonders, giving them new hope that God did care about their afflictions and was still in their midst.\n\nVen. Maria Magalena founded the monastery of Passionist Nuns in Madrid, Spain. She also wrote extensively (under the pseudonym J. Pastor) to promote the ideal of holiness of life. Her autobiography, entitled the “Apostle of Love”, is described by the Dominican theologians of Salamanca, Spain as “the most sublime work ... that has ever been written about God’s love for all creatures”.\n\nWhile seeing the highly honored miraculous picture of our Lady in Spoleto borne about in solemn procession, Francis felt the fire of divine love rising in his heart and almost at once made the resolve to join the Passionists, a religious congregation dedicated to the veneration of and meditation on the passion of Jesus Christ.\n\nAlthough Gemma was not a Passionist in the canonical sense, she desired to be and God raised her up as a true paradigm for those who desire to follow St Paul of the Cross. She is one of the most popular saints of the Passionist Congregation. Devotion to Gemma is particularly strong both in Italy and Latin America.\n\nSt. Maria Goretti was born of a poor peasant family in Corinaldi, Italy, in 1890. She was well known to her neighbors for her cheerfulness and piety. When she was twelve, a vicious stranger burst upon her, bent on raping her and destroying her childlike purity. With splendid courage she surrendered herself to God and preferred to die rather than to lose her virginity.\n\nThe characteristic spirituality of Sr. Maria Addolorata was characterized by the offering of her life in order to be conformed to Jesus Crucified. This was demonstrated in her total and unconditional acceptance of her physical sufferings, of which she willingly spoke and wrote, so that everyone would know about her great love for Jesus.\n\nLed away as if they were criminals, the Passionist religious left the church. No one thought about running from death. All remained faithful to the Lord. After praying and receiving the Eucharist, the Passionists of Daimiel, felt that they were strengthened and prepared to confront their passion and to completely drink the chalice that the heavenly Father had prepared for them.\n\nWhen he was twenty-one, Dominic received the first direct inkling of what the Lord's plans for his future might be. He writes: \"One of these days (I think it was one of the last of the year 1813) as I was saying my prayers, the idea came to me that God wanted me to be a priest, and that I was to go and bring the light of the Gospel to a foreign nation.\""
