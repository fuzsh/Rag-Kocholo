        "text": "Social Sharing\n\nWARNING: This story contains distressing details.\n\nFollowing the preliminary discoveries of unmarked graves at former residential schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan, calls have rippled across Canada for similar searches at other sites to get a more accurate answer to a troubling question:\n\nHow many Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes, never to return again?\n\nIn Manitoba, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission determined at least 338 children who were forced to attend the schools died either during their time there, or within a year of being discharged from the school.\n\nThe latter includes those who died in a hospital or sanatorium after being transferred there — a common practice at residential schools when students were suffering from terminal illness, the TRC's final report notes.\n\nOf those 338 students, only 164 — just under half — were on the commission's named register.\n\nBut the actual count could be higher.\n\nThat number only includes students at the 14 Manitoba schools that fell under the federal Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement. There were many more institutions Indigenous children were forced to attend, including day schools and sites that were run without government support.\n\nSome of the residential school deaths that are known about aren't linked to a particular school. Others may have gone undocumented.\n\nChildren at residential schools died at a much higher rate than those in the general population, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission says, and the causes ranged from accidents to untreated illnesses to suicides.\n\nMost of the time, the practice was to not send their bodies back to their home communities, the commission's Missing Children and Unmarked Burials Project found.\n\nToday, some are only identified by one name. Others have no known date of death.\n\nHere are the names of the residential school students in Manitoba who are known to have died and their recorded date of death, according to years of research compiled by the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba.\n\nAssiniboia Residential School\n\nGrant Ross (died on March 20, 1971).\n\nBirtle Residential School\n\nAgnes Ben (died between March 11 and April 16, 1930).\n\nAmelia Bunn (died on Jan. 1, 1934).\n\nCaroline Bunn (died in December 1939).\n\nElsie (died in 1902 or 1903).\n\nElsie Blackbird (date of death unknown).\n\nEmma Bird (died on Oct. 3, 1934).\n\nFrank Hunting Hawk (died on Feb. 16, 1925).\n\nFred Kashananilowlgran (date of death unknown).\n\nJulie Bunn (died on June 20, 1938).\n\nMary F.
