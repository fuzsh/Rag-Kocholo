Bredesen, judge of Municipal Court 18 years and a veteran of World War I, died Monday night at Maplecrest Sanitorium, Whitelaw, following a long illness. He was 65. Judge Bredesen, a native of Stoughton, Wis., where he was born Aug. 16, 1893, served municipal court from May 1, 1933, until his resignation June 1, 1951. He succeeded the late Judge Albert H. Schmidt, who served in that capacity 28 years. At the time Judge Bredesen resigned Harold W. Mueller was appointed by Gov. Kohler to be seated on the bench in his place, a position he has had continuously since. Judge Bredesen retired because of physical disabilities midway in his fifth four-year term. The Order of the Purple Heart has been presented to Judge Bredesen Dec. 7, 1932, by the War Department for his gallantry in the first war. He served for 13 months and was a member of the Second Division, Fifth Regiment, of the U.S. Marine corps. He held the rank of corporal. Wounded in France The judge was seriously wounded during the historic battle of Belleau Wood in France June 6, 1918. He and two other marines were the only ones of his company to survive. The machine gun wounds were so severe that the judge was unable to return to active duty. It was while he was recuperating from these war wounds at Camp Barry, Great Lakes, Ill., that he married Stella Engeldinger April 5, 1920. A Marine chaplain performed the ceremony. The son of the late Rev. Adolph and Inanda Torrison Bredesen attended Luther college at Decorah, Iowa, for a year before enrolling at Marquette University School of Law. He was graduated from the Wisconsin school in 1924 and moved to Manitowoc where he began the practice of law. He also was credit manager for the O. Torrison Co. The judge and a buddy, Thomas Rowley, of Chicago were reunited at Manitowoc in March of 1937. The chance meeting occurred when the judge read a notice inserted by Rowley in a Veterans publication. Five Children Shortly after Judge Bredesen resigned his judgeship he and Mrs. Bredesen disposed of their residence at 1117 S. Eighth St., and moved to Venice, Fla., where a brother, the Rev. Alfred Bredesen, served a church. The Bredesens returned to Manitowoc in February of last year and established residence at 803 Pine St. The Bredesens observed their silver wedding anniversary in 1945, an occasion for them to recall the 13th anniversary of their wedding, for it was April 5, 1933, that he was elected municipal judge. Judge Bredesen was a member of Drews-Bleser Post, American Legion, Wisconsin Bar Assn., Elks Lodge, 40 ?? ? of the Legion and the Eagles Aerie of this city. He is survived by his wife, three sons, (private); two daughters,(private); a brother, the Rev. Mr. Bredesen of LaCrosse; two sisters, Mr. G.A. Sundby and Mrs. Inga Norstog of Decorah, Iowa, and 13 grandchildren. Funeral services will be at 3 p.m. Thursday at Urbanek and Schlei Funeral Home with the Rev. Arthur Johnson officiating.

He had been in declining health for several months but his condition was not thought critical. Death was due to a complication of troubles. He was about 45 years of age. Besides his wife he leaves his father, a step-brother and a step- sister, Mrs. Ackerman, both of Milwaukee. His wife before her marriage was Miss Rosa Link, daughter of the late Frank Link of Liberty. On matters pertaining to the support of his father the deceased had been involved in litigation with the city and Manitowoc Rapids for some years. There is at present a suit pending in circuit court. The funeral will be held Saturday afternoon from the home at 2 o'clock. Interment will be in Evergreen cemetery. Manitowoc Pilot Thursday, January 26, 1911 pg. 1 ********* BREY SIGNS TO PAY Affixes Name to Contract for $9 Per Month for Father Failing in an attempt to have his father committed to the county asylum as a poor charge and threatened with immediate prosecution, Jacob Brey, Jr., has signed a contract to pay $9 per month to August Kaems, who will board and care for his aged parent. The agreement was drafted in probate court today when Brey appeared on summons of the city and was given a last chance to pay the sum which he was ordered to ten days ago. Brey, Jr., objected to permitting Mr. Kaems to care for his father but when it came to a choice of facing a suit or paying, he yielded. Brey has held out against the city for weeks. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Saturday, December 1, 1906 P. 1 ******* DEATH MAY END FAMOUS BREY (sic) CASE Jacob Brey Jr., Died at Home in Rapids Today, Aged 44 Death has halted the famous Brey case pending in circuit court and forced an adjournment over the term if it has not closed the case entirely, by claiming Jacob Brey Jr., the defendant in the action whose demise occurred at his home in Rapids at 11 o'clock this morning. Brey's death followed a protracted illness of several months which was the basis for postponement of the trial when it was scheduled to be taken up earlier in the January calendar of the court. Brey, who was 44 years of age, a native of Rapids, a life resident of the town has been in litigation for four years with the city of Manitowoc and Town of Rapids over demands of the municipalities that he contribute to the support of his aged father, Jacob Brey Sr. The present action in court is an appeal from probate court in the case of the Town of Rapids vs Brey in which the probate court issued an order compelling Brey to pay $2.50 per week for support of his parent. The case was heard in July and the order was issued at that time. Brey appealed and furnished bonds and had thus evaded payment of the weekly stipend. The appeal was on the jury calendar of the present term of court but under an agreement of attorneys in the case, Healy and Joyce, for the town board and Kelly and Wyseman for Brey, it was taken from the jury calendar and placed upon the court calendar for hearing later in the term. The delay was taken owing to illness of Brey. Brey had been involved in a series of suits with the City of Manitowoc and Town of Rapids over his refusal to contribute to the support of his father, Jacob Brey Sr. Past 80 years of age, Brey Sr., claimed to have deeded his farm to the son and a bond of maintenance was given by Brey Jr., was later released when the son paid a certain sum. The aged father was later robbed of the money, he declared, and penniless and ill, applied to the city and town for aid. Brey Jr. defeated the city in an action against him on the grounds that his father was not a resident of the city but later took the aged man into his home. Brey Sr. refused to remain with his son however, and later was supported by the town, the officials of which sued Brey Jr. in probate court. An order was issued compelling the son to pay $2.50 per week but an appeal was taken. Whether an attempt will now be made to hold Brey's estate for the order of probate court, $2.50 per week since July and for future care of Brey Sr., is a question, but in this event the executor of Brey's estate would probably be substituted for the dead man as a defendant. The order of probate court it is said, has the same effect as a judgment and is collectible from the state and the Town of Rapids will probably press the claim. In any event, it is probable the case will be adjourned over the present term of court. The death of Mr. Brey followed an illness of several moths and was due to Bright's disease. During the past year or two, Brey had been a victim of fate and for months had been incapacitated for work as result of accidents. Brey sustained a fracture of his leg in an accident and had just recovered from the injury when the limb was again fractured in the same place. Born at Rapids, January 22, 1866, Jacob Brey had passed his life in the county and was well known in city and county. He was married in 1891 to Rosa Link, the widow who survives him. Besides his widow, Brey is survived by his aged father, a step brother, Joseph of Milwaukee and a step sister, Mrs. Ackerman, also of Milwaukee. The funeral will be held from the late home in Rapids Saturday afternoon with interment at Evergreen in the city. Manitowoc Daily Herald, Wed., Jan. 25, 1911 ******* RAPIDS FARMER IS HURT Jacob Brey(sic) Jr., Thrown From Wagon on Middle Road Jacob Brey, Jr., a Town of Rapids farmer, was seriously injured in an accident late Friday night while enroute to his home west of the city and is now being cared for at the hospital. Brey was driving on the Middle Road and was halted between two tracks of the C & NW by a freight train which blocked the track. His horse became ?? and Brey lost control of the animal which, in attempting to turn, threw Brey from the wagon and he was rendered unconscious by the force of the fall. A severe fracture of the leg between the knee and the ankle resulted and it was feared that internal injuries had been inflicted. Brey was removed to the hospital in the city patrol and Drs. Staehle and Kemper attended him. According to Brey's statement the freight train blockaded the track for twenty minutes and his horse became restless. The tracks are outside the city limits. Brey is the man who had trouble with the city over the questions of providing for support of his aged father. He is said to be prosperous.
