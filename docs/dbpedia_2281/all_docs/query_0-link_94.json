By St Alphonsus\n\nOur Morning Offering – 16 March – Saturday of the Fourth Week in Lent and our Mother Mary’s Day\n\nLook Down, O Mother Mary!\n\nBy St Alphonsus Maria de Liguori, (1696-1787)\n\nMost Zealous Doctor\n\nTransl, Fr Edmund Vaughan, CSSR in 1863\n\nLook down, O Mother Mary!\n\nFrom thy bright throne above;\n\nCast down upon thy children\n\nOne only glance of love.\n\nAnd if a heart so tender\n\nWith pity flows not o’er,\n\nThen turn away, O Mother!\n\nAnd look on us no more.\n\nSee how, ungrateful sinners,\n\nWe stand before thy Son;\n\nHis loving heart upbraids us\n\nThe evil we have done.\n\nBut if thou wilt appease Him,\n\nSpeak for us—but one word;\n\nThou only canst obtain as\n\nThe pardon of our Lord.\n\nO Mary, dearest Mother!\n\nIf thou wouldst have us live,\n\nSay that we are thy children,\n\nAnd Jesus will forgive.\n\nOur sins make us unworthy\n\nThat title still to bear\n\nBut thou art still our Mother,\n\nThen show a Mother’s care.\n\nOpen to us thy mantle,\n\nThere stay we without fear,\n\nWhat evil can befall us\n\nIf, Mother, thou art near?\n\nO sweetest, dearest Mother!\n\nThy sinful children save;\n\nLook down on us with pity,\n\nWho thy protection crave.\n\nOur Morning Offering – 9 October – To Our Lady of the Rosary “Through Thee, to Us, Our Saviour Came”\n\nOur Morning Offering – 9 October – “The Month of the Most Holy Rosary and of the Angels”\n\nThrough Thee, to Us, Our Saviour Came\n\nTo Our Lady of the Rosary\n\nBy St Amadeus of Lausanne O.Cist (1108-1159)\n\nThrough thee, to us, our Saviour came,\n\nThrough thee, to Him, we fain would go.\n\nOur lives are marred by wrong and shame,\n\nYet, confidence in thee we know.\n\nThe friendship thou dost give to all\n\nWho love thy name, shall ever be\n\nAssurance thou wilt hear our call,\n\nSweet Lady of the Rosary!\n\nThou art our Strength upon the way,\n\nOur Morning Star, to cheer and guide;\n\nOur Beacon Light to show the day,\n\nAnd lead us to the Saviour’s Side;\n\nA Comforter in ev’ry pain\n\nWe find, O Mother blest, in thee,\n\nAnd seek we, never, thee in vain,\n\nFair Lady of the Rosary!\n\nThy praises, Mary, we would sing,\n\nAnd all our faculties employ,\n\nThat unto thee our hearts might bring\n\nA glory-crown of love and joy.\n\nBless thou each humble effort made\n\nIn thy regard and grant that we,\n\nMay by thy influence be swayed,\n\nOur Lady of the Rosary!\n\nOur Morning Offering – 25 February – Shelter Me Under Thy Mantle, Refuge of Sinners\n\nOur Morning Offering – 25 February – The First Saturday of Lent\n\nShelter Me Under Thy Mantle,\n\nRefuge of Sinners\n\nBy St Alphonsus Liguori (1696-1787)\n\nMost Zealous Doctor\n\nMost holy Virgin Immaculate, my Mother Mary,\n\nto thee, who art the Mother of my Lord,\n\nthe Queen of the Universe, the Advocate,\n\nthe Hope, the Refuge of sinners,\n\nI, who am the most miserable of all sinners,\n\nhave recourse this day.\n\nI venerate thee, great Queen\n\nand I thank thee for the many graces\n\nthou hast bestowed upon me, even unto this day,\n\nin particular, for having delivered me from the hell\n\nwhich I have so often deserved by my sins.\n\nI love thee, my dearest

Month of the\n\nImmaculate Heart of Mary\n\nDevotion to the Heart of Mary\n\nDevotion to the Heart of Mary is but the consequence of the devotion due to the Heart of Jesus. It is a consequence of that boundless love of Jesus for His Most Holy Mother, which leads Him, to share with her ,all the riches and honours, as far as they can be communicated to a creature.\n\nThe Church never disassociates the Mother from her Divine Son, in the festivals which she celebrates in His honour. If she celebrates the Mysteries of the Saviour, from His Incarnation to His Ascension, she celebrates, likewise, all the Mysteries of Mary, from her Conceptions to her Assumption. The Feast of the Sacred Heart of Mary (Immaculate Heart of Mary) is, therefore, but the natural consequence of the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\nLet us love and honour these Two Hearts, so intimately united; let us go to the Father through the Heart of Jesus; let us go to the Saviour through the Heart of Mary. Let us render to God the Father, through the Heart of Jesus, what we owe to His infinite justice and goodness and let us render to God, the Son, through the Heart of Mary what we owe to His Mercy and all His benefits to us. We shall obtain everything from the Father and the Holy Ghost through the Heart of Jesus and we shall obtain everything, through the Heart of Mary.\n\nIt is customary with many pious persons, to dedicate the Five First Saturdays of the month to the particular honour of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, as the Nine First Friday are devoted to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 1

Rosary, we can imgine that we are witnesses of the Annunciation to Mary, in her home at Nazareth.\n\nAn Angel descends from Heaven and bows before the Blessed Virgin as she kneels, absorbed in prayer.\n\n“Hail, full of grace,” he says, “the Lord is with thee.

I open the Old Testament and find the Song of Songs which presents me with two most beautiful comparisons (cf Song of Solomon 2:2-3) – “As a lily among brambles, so is my love among maidens.”\n\nCan we not all see here, in the delicate image of the lily, Mary the Immaculate, beautiful and resplendent?\n\nIn the same passage I find: “As an apple tree among the trees of the wild forest, so is my beloved among young men.”\n\nWhat is this tree, laden with fruit, which resembles the beloved?\n\nThis apple tree that grows among the trees of the wild forest, the fruit of which is wholesome and sweet to the taste?\n\nObviously, it is Jesus – the fruit of the tree is the Sacrament of His Body and Blood.\n\nOh, what a wonderfully apt association of images!\n\nThe lily and the tree – Mary and the Eucharist!\n\nThe Church is compared to a lovely garden, “a garden locked.”\n\nIn it, the fountains play and herbs and fruits make it pleasant and perfumed like a garden of Paradise.\n\nAnd see! beside the fountain blooms the lily, near at hand is the tree.\n\nThe faithful soul seeks for himself a place between the fragrant lily and the fruit-laden tree, between Mary and the Holy Sacrament and lingers with great delight in the shade of the tree. “I sat in his shadow….”\n\nO Mary, pure lily, tender and delicate flower!\n\nO Holy Sacrament!\n\nO mysterious tree, truly the most beautiful of all the trees in the wild forest, because you are the Christ!”\n\nThoughts of Mary – 12 May – To Jesus Through Mary\n\nThoughts of Mary – 12 May – “Mary’s Month”\n\nTo Jesus Through Mary\n\nMoments with Saint Pope John XXIII (1881-1963)\n\nThe simple words of the first page of Matthew’s Gospel: “Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ” (Mt 1:16) suffice for me, to establish the fundamental principle of all the great theological teaching which illustrates the connection between the Blessed Sacrament and Our Lady.\n\nChristian piety has rejoiced to learn from the Book of Acts, that Mary was present at the first gatherings of the faithful, when they broke read together as brothers and spent long hours in prayer.\n\nAnd modern art has often portrayed the heavenly Mother in the act of receiving, from the hand of St John, the beloved apostle, the Communion of the Body and Blood of her Son.\n\nBut all this is superfluous and unnecessary for our convinced belief.\n\nWhen we say, that in the Eucharist, we have the Son and in Mary, we have His Mother, have we not said all?\n\nThe great genius of Hippo, St Augustine, with his eagle-eyed power of vision, found the words which so brilliantly contain the Doctrine – Ave corpo vero, nato de Maria Virgine – Hail, true body, born of the Virgin Mary!\n\nIn this way – a delightful thing to say, a sublime thing to contemplate – the terms of this twofold mystery are merged into one, so that Mary appears to us radiant in the light of the Eucharistic mystery; they are merged and yet they are the two extreme points, between which is evolved and developed, the whole Catholic Dogma of the Incarnation and of the continuing life of the Church.\n\nThought for the Day – 2 May – The Intercession of Our Lady\n\nThought for the Day – 2 May – Meditations with Antonio Cardinal Bacci (1881-1971)\n\nThe Intercession of Our Lady\n\n“Mary’s intercession is very powerful with God.\n\nSt Bernard tells us that it is the will of God, that everything comes to us through her holy hands (Sermo in Nativ BMV no 7).\n\nHe assures us, that Mary is the Mediatrix through whom we receive all favours from God (In Assump. BMV sermo 2, no 2).\n\nHer power of intercession is the result of her divine and human motherhood.\n\nBecause she is the Mother of God, Jesus refuses her nothing; because she is our mother, she loves us dearly and is eager to obtain from God, the spiritual favours, for which we ask.\n\nFor this reason, we should approach her with complete confidence.\n\nSt Bernard also writes: “If anyone feels that he is overwhelmed by the tempests of this world and cannot keep an even course, let him raise his eyes towards Mary, let him remember Mary and call upon her…. In danger and in doubt, let him remember and call upon her. Let the thought of Mary never leave his mind; let her name never be far from his lips and from his heart …” (Super Miss. Homil 2, no 17).\n\nIn all our necessities, we should have confident recourse to our heavenly Mother.\n\nLet us remember, however, that if we wish to be true sons of Mary and to be sure of being heard by her, we should ask especially, for spiritual graces.\n\nAfterwards, we can ask, with equal confidence but, with resignation to God’s will, for temporal favours, provided that they will not stand in the way of our eternal salvation.”\n\nAntonio Cardinal Bacci\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 28 May – God alone!\n\nQuote/s of the Day – 28 May – Tuesday of the Third Week of Easter and the Memorial of St Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716), St Peter Chanel (1803-1841) Priest and Martyr, St Gianna Beretta Molla (1922-1962), Blessed María Felicia of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament OCD (1925-1959)\n\n“God alone!”\n\n“Chosen soul, how will you bring this about?\n\nWhat steps will you take to reach the high level\n\nto which God is calling you?\n\nThe means of holiness and salvation,\n\nare known to everybody,\n\nsince they are found in the Gospel,\n\nthe masters of the spiritual life have explained them,\n\nthe Saints have practised them…\n\nThese means are –\n\nsincere Humility,\n\nunceasing Prayer,\n\ncomplete Self-denial,\n\nabandonment to Divine Providence\n\nand obedience to the Will of God.”\n\n“Since grace enhances our human nature\n\nand glory adds a still greater perfection to grace,\n\nit is certain, that our Lord remains in heaven,\n\njust as much the Son of Mary as He was on earth.\n\nConsequently, He has retained the submissiveness\n\nand obedience of the most Perfect of all Children,\n\ntowards the Best of all Mothers.”\n\nTrue Devotion to the Blessed Virgin, #27\n\n“The greatest saints,\n\nthose richest in grace and virtue,\n\nwill be the most assiduous in praying\n\nto the most Blessed Virgin,\n\nlooking up to her,\n\nas the perfect model to imitate\n\nand as a powerful helper to assist them. “\n\nSt Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716)\n\n“It does not matter, whether or not I am killed,\n\nthe religion has taken root on the island,\n\nit will not be destroyed by my death,\n\nsince it comes not from men but from God.”\n\nSt Peter Chanel (1803-1841) Priest and Martyr\n\n“The stillness of prayer\n\nis the most essential condition\n\nfor fruitful action.\n\nBefore all else,\n\nthe disciple kneels down.”\n\n“Our body is a cenacle,\n\na monstrance –\n\nthrough its crystal,\n\nthe world should see God.”\n\nSt Gianna Beretta Molla (1922-1962)\n\n“Father, for Your glory,\n\naccept the total surrender of my being,\n\nin union with the perfect sacrifice of Your divine Son.\n\nIn Him, through Him and with Him,\n\nI live, love, believe, suffer and die….”\n\nBlessed María Felicia of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament (1925-1959)\n\nOur Morning Offering – 4 April – Loving Mother, have pity on me …\n\nOur Morning Offering – 4 April – Saturday of the Fifth week of Lent, Year C “Marian Saturdays”\n\nMother of Sorrows, of Love, of Mercy\n\nBy Fr Lawrence Lovasik SVD (1913-1986)\n\nMary, most holy Virgin and Queen of Martyrs,\n\naccept the sincere homage of my childlike love.\n\nInto your heart, pierced by so many sorrows,\n\nwelcome my poor soul.\n\nReceive it as the companion of your sorrows\n\nat the foot of the Cross, on which Jesus\n\ndied for the redemption of the world.\n\nSorrowful Virgin, with you,\n\nI will gladly suffer all the trials,\n\nmisunderstandings and pains\n\nwhich it shall please our Lord to send me.\n\nI offer them all to you in memory of your sorrows,\n\nso that every thought of my mind\n\nand every beat of my heart,\n\nmay be an act of compassion and of love for you.\n\nLoving Mother, have pity on me,\n\nreconcile me to your Divine Son Jesus,\n\nkeep me in His grace and assist me\n\nin my last agony,\n\nso that I may be able to meet you in heaven\n\nand sing your glories.\n\nMary, most sorrowful Mother of Christians,\n\npray for us.\n\nMother of love, of sorrow\n\nand of mercy, pray for us!\n\nAmen. Amen!\n\nSaint of the Day – 31 March – Blessed Bonaventure Tornielli OSM (1411-1491)\n\nSaint of the Day – 31 March – Blessed Bonaventure Tornielli OSM (1411-1491) Priest of the Servite Order, called the “Apostolic Preacher”, Confessor, Biblical expert, Missionary Preacher – born in 1411 in Forli, Italy and died on 31 March 1491 of natural causes, aged 80 years old. Patronages – Missionaries, Catechists.\n\nThe Roman Martyrology says of him: “In Udine, in the territory of Venice, Blessed Bonaventure Tornielli, Priest of the Order of the Servants of Mary, who moved the villages to penance with his preaching in various regions of Italy. He died as an octogenarian, while preaching a Lenten sermon.”\n\nBonaventura Tornielli was born in 1411 in Forlì to the nobleman Giacomo Tornielli and he received a devout family education.\n\nHe enlisted into the Servite Order in 1448, where he became noted as a Biblical expert and was later Ordained as a Priest. He completed his studies in Venice in 1454 and earned his Master’s Degree in his Theological studies. After he was Ordained to the Priesthood, he made preparation for a life of apostolic work, by a year in solitude. After this period of retirement, he began to preach eloquently and successfully.\n\nHe became noted for his love of contemplative silence in which to meditate on the Gospel, while also preaching sermons and missions in the Papal States and in other Italian cities, all on the subject of repentance.\n\nHis fame for personal holiness spread at a rapid pace even to the ears of Pope Sixtus IV who named him as the “Apostolic Preacher.” Fr Bonaventura served for an unknown duration as his order’s Vicar-General. In this office, he gave proof of wonderful administrative ability and charity.\n\nIn 1468 he led a sermon before the Senate of the Republic of Venice (also to them in 1482) and in 1488 at the San Marco Basilica. He also led sermons in Florence at the Cathedral at the request of their Senate and also at the Cathedral of the Annunciation in 1481 . He preached during a period of plague in 1476 in both Bologna and Perugia . In 1483 he served as Prior of the San Marcello convent in Rome and there decided to retire, with six others, to a hermitage after receiving papal permission to do so. This was short lived, for Pope Sixtus IV on 31 May 1483, requested that he preach in the Papal States.\n\nFr Bonaventure participated in the General Chapter of his Order in 1485 in Vetralla and again in 1488 at Bologna where he preached.\n\nIt was said that he walked barefoot regardless of the weather conditions and also refrained from consuming both meat and wine. Fra Filippo Albrizzi wrote: “He was a priest of great holiness. His beard was unkempt, his feet were bare, suffering the heat of summer and the freezing cold of winter. He never wore shoes and his feet were often seen to be bleeding.” Fr Bonaventure also slept either on the floor or on a bed of wooden planks.\n\nFr Bonaventure died on 31 March 1491 – on Holy Thursday – in Udine where he was preaching during the Lenten season.\n\nIn 1507 the Lieutenant Andrea Loredan was on a trip from Venice to Udine when he fell ill and was cured, after turning to the late Fr Bonaventure for intercession. His remains were moved in 1509 to Venice to the Church of Saint Mary of the Servants that Loredan himself oversaw. His remains were relocated to the private home of a Servite priest – due to the Napoleonic invasion. In 1971 his remains were moved to Udine. In both Udine and the City of Venice, a cultus grew up around him, it was marked by many miraculous cures. This cultus was confirmed in 1911 when he was Beatified by St Pope Pius X.\n\nOh God, who didst impart to Blessed Bonaventure, the Confessor, the grace of recalling sinners to repentance, grant we beseech Thee, through his merits and intercession, that we may also weep over our sins, so that, renewed in heart and will, we may serve Thee faithfully, until death. Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen\n\nLenten Reflection – 28 March – “This is the Christ.”\n\nLenten Reflection – 28 March – Saturday of the Fourth week of Lent, Readings: Jeremiah 11:18-20, Psalm 7:2-3, 9-12, John 7:40-53\n\n“Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall declare your praise.”\n\nOthers said, “This is the Christ.” ... John 7:41\n\nDaily Meditation:\n\nApart from You we can do nothing.\n\n“In Christ we encounter such human characteristics that they have nothing to distinguish them from the weakness common to us mortals. At the same time, we encounter characteristics so divine, that they can only be appropriate to the sovereign and ineffable divine nature. Too small to comprehend this, the human mind is so dumbfounded, that it does not know what to take its stand on, nor which path to follow. Is it aware of God in Christ? Yet it sees Him die. Does it take Him to be a man? But see Him coming back from the dead with the prize of His victory, having destroyed the reign of death. In the same way our contemplation needs to be practised with such reverence and fear that, in the same Jesus, it considers the truth of the two natures, avoiding attributing to the divine essence those things that are not worthy of it or do not belong to it but also avoiding seeing only an illusory appearance in historical events.\n\nIn truth, causing such things as these to be heard by human ears, trying to express them in words considerably surpasses our ability, talent and language. I even think it surpasses the capability of the apostles. More still, the explanation of this mystery probably transcends the entire order of angelic powers.” … Origen (c 185-253) Father, Priest and Theologian\n\nMy shield is with God,\n\nwho saves the upright in heart.\n\nPsalm 7:10\n\nIntercessions:\n\nLet us always and everywhere give thanks to Christ our Saviour\n\nand ask Him with confidence:\n\nLord, help us with Your grace.\n\nMay we keep our bodies pure,\n\n– as temples of the Holy Spirit.\n\nMay we offer ourselves this day to the service of others\n\n– and do Your will in all things throughout the day.\n\nTeach us to seek the bread of everlasting life,\n\n– the bread that is Your gift.\n\nMay Your Mother, the refuge of sinners, pray for us,\n\n– and gain for us your loving forgiveness.\n\nClosing Prayer:\n\nO Jesus, Mary’s Son!\n\nBy St Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274)\n\nDoctor Angelicus, Doctor communis\n\nHail to Thee!

Patronages – Manises, Persecuted Christians, Engineers. As he was being taken away on the morning of 14 February 14, 1937, his wife called out to him and said, “See you tomorrow.” Vicente replied, “Until tomorrow or in heaven!” Minutes later he was shot to death.\n\nThe youngest of eight children, Blessed Vicente was born to a ceramics manufacturer and his wife on 28 June 1889, in Valencia, Spain. His parents were devoted to their Catholic faith and their children received a good Christian education. After attending a school run by the Piarist Fathers, Blessed Vicente enrolled at a technical school and earned an industrial engineer’s degree.\n\nAt the aged of 33, Blessed Vicente married a young woman named Isabel (died 1993) and the two lived a model Christian life together. Blessed Vicente became involved in his Parish, helping the Priests however he could. He spread fundamental Christian morals among his fellow colleagues and was known for his deep commitment to charitable works in the name of the poor. He served as an industrial engineer in his own ceramics farm that he had inherited and oversaw, with three of his brothers, after the premature death of their parents. David also held several important municipal positions where he put the social teachings of the faith into full practice and was renowned for his deep commitment to fundamental values and traditional principles. Youth organisations were also a forum for his work, as well as a range of parish activities.\n\nHe also took over the management of his father’s ceramics factory. His workers saw him, not only as their boss but also as a caring father. He was concerned that they would be treated with the justice and dignity to which all workers have a right.\n\nIn the summer of 1936, the Spanish Civil War was at its peak in Valencia. ,,The persecution of Catholics and of the Church by the governing regime was also very intense. Blessed Vicente, who had been teaching at a ceramics trade school, was fired because of his Catholic beliefs. He bravely continued to encourage other Catholics and to give the Priests whatever support and help he could by protecting their whereabouts and hiding them in his home.\n\nOn 14 February 1937, he was called to appear before a tribunal and commanded to stop his activities on behalf of the Catholic Church. Blessed Vicente replied that being a Catholic was his greatest calling and he would not give up, even if it meant death. He was immediately sentenced to be executed. He was permitted to see his wife and encouraged her with words of faith and conviction. He publicly forgave his persecutors and enemies. Then he was shot to death on the very same day he was arrested.\n\nThe ceramics factory workers were outraged. In protest at Blessed Vicente’s execution, they went on strike for three days. They told the socialist officials who tried to prevent their strike, “You have robbed us of our employer and our father. Because he was prudent, kind and concerned for our working conditions, we not only respected him, we loved him.”\n\nBlessed Vicente was Beatified on 1 October 1995 by St Pope John Paul II. His death by violent hands was recognised as a true Martyrdom for the faith.\n\nOur faith applies to every aspect of our lives. In our family and social life, our time at school, our time spent working, we are called to put into practice the values that Jesus taught in the Gospel.\n\nThought for the Day – 30 January – How to Guard Holy Purity\n\nThought for the Day – 30 January – Meditations with Antonio Cardinal Bacci (1881-1971)\n\nHow to Guard Holy Purity\n\n“Purity of heart is a quality which attracts everybody, even those who are evil themselves. It makes a man seem like an angel in human form, for it shines from his countenance.\n\nUnfortunately, the virtue of purity, is as difficult as it is beautiful.\n\nIt is fatal for anyone to cast himself into the mire.\n\nThe first sin of impurity is a disaster, because it is often the first link in a tragic chain, which makes him the salve of his lower impulses and of the tyrannical enemy of souls, the devil.\n\nWe must resist the earliest suggestions of the flesh, by every means in our power, both natural and supernatural.\n\nSt Thomas Aquinas tells us that none of the passions dethrones reason so much as sensuality (Summa Theologiae, II-II, q.53, a.6).\n\nSt Augustine warns us also in his Confessions, that lust has it’s cause in a perverse will and if anybody surrenders to it, he acquires the evil habit.\n\nIf this habit is not resisted, the sin becomes a frightening necessity.\n\nResist from the beginning, if you wish to avoid ruin and the slavery of the devil, who cunningly uses this passion, to capture souls.\n\nIf a man is overcome by violent temptation and falls into sin, however, he should not lose courage.\n\nGod is infinitely good and merciful.\n\nHe knows our weakness.\n\nWhen anyone falls, let him rise immediately.\n\nLet him return to God by repenting and making a good confession.\n\nLet him resolve to make any sacrifice, rather than fall again!”\n\nAntonio Cardinal Bacci\n\nQuote of the Day – 26 October – A Saint’s Prayer Corner – St John Henry Newman\n\nQuote of the Day – 26 October – Saturday of the Twenty Ninth week in Ordinary Time, Year C, Marian Saturdays\n\nAs we draw to the end of the Month of the Holy Rosary, let us listen to our newest Saint on the Rosary.\n\nA Saint’s Prayer Corner\n\n“Now the great power of the Rosary lies in this, that it makes the Creed into a prayer – of course, the Creed is, in some sense, a prayer and a great act of homage to God but the Rosary gives us, the great truths of His life and death, to meditate upon and brings them nearer to our hearts.\n\nAnd so we contemplate all the great mysteries of His life and His birth in the manger and so too the mysteries of His suffering and His glorified life. But even Christians, with all their knowledge of God, have usually more awe than love of Him and the special virtue of the Rosary lies in the special way in which it looks at these mysteries, for with all our thoughts of Him are mingled thoughts of His Mother and in the relations between Mother and Son, we have set before us the Holy Family, the home in which God lived.\n\nNow the family is, even humanly considered, a sacred thing, how much more the family bound together by supernatural ties and, above all, that in which God dwelt with His Blessed Mother.”\n\nBelow is part of Newman’s cell in the Birmingham Oratory. One sees clearly the Rosary beads hanging on the wall, in a prayer corner with devotional images and items.\n\nMay he pray for us!"
