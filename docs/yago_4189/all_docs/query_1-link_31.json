        "text": "The Langlois Affair began on February 9, 1968. That was the day when Henri Langlois, the director of the Cinémathèque Française, which he had established, in the mid-thirties, with his friend Georges Franju, and dedicated to preserving and exhibiting movies from all periods and countries, was relieved of his position and replaced by a man named Pierre Barbin. Barbin was an obscure and relatively inexperienced film-festival organizer, and Langlois was a culture hero, a status recognized even by his adversaries. One of the men who engineered his dismissal, Pierre Moinot, called him “a ragpicker of genius.” Langlois was also, as it turned out, a fox, and his confrontation with French officialdom is one of the great stories of a year whose meaning, like the meaning of 1789 and the meaning of 1848 and, someday, probably, the meaning of 2001, is a forever deepening mystery, even for—especially for—the people who lived through it.\n\nPierre Moinot’s description was not unjust. Film stock is famously perishable, and for many years movies were considered, even by the companies that made them, disposable commodities. Langlois saved movies from death and disintegration, not just the rags of cinema but the riches as well. It is because of Langlois that Abel Gance’s silent-era epic “Napoléon” (1927) survives. Langlois contrived to keep the Cinémathèque going during the Nazi Occupation, when American movies and most film societies were banned; and, after the Liberation of Paris, the Cinémathèque’s tiny, sixty-seat screening room, on the Avenue de Messine, became the premier repertory house in France. Sartre and Beauvoir were habitués; so were Léger, Braque, Gide, and Georges Pompidou. And so were the cinephiles of the postwar generation—Truffaut, Godard, Rohmer, Rivette, Chabrol. The Cinémathèque is where the New Wave was born.\n\nLanglois was a scavenger, and he had a scavenger’s regard for ethical and personal decorum. In the beginning, he stored films in his bathtub, a practice that (as one historian, Herman Lebovics, has noted) gives an accurate measure of his commitment both to collecting and to hygiene. No one knew exactly how he obtained all of the films that ended up in his possession, or where they were stored. His reputation for obsessiveness was his principal business asset; for many years, people entrusted their films to him because they believed that he would protect them, if called upon, to the death.\n\nThen came the Fifth Republic. When Charles de Gaulle took office as President of France, in 1959, he created a new Ministry of Culture and appointed his old comrade André Malraux (who had been a minister in de Gaulle’s brief first government, in 1945-46) to head it. Malraux was a culture hero, too, though of a very different stripe. His celebrity was the public kind: as a prize-winning novelist; as a tank commander in the French Army and, after escaping from the Germans, an officer in the Resistance; as an art historian; and as an almost comically indefatigable promoter of French culture. One of his first acts as Minister of Culture was to create the avance sur recettes, a system of state subsidy that helped finance many of the movies that made the nineteen-sixties a period of renaissance for French film: “Last Year at Marienbad,” “Cleo from 5 to 7,” “Jules and Jim,” “Diary of a Chambermaid,” “Two or Three Things I Know About Her,” and “Belle de Jour.” Also “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” “A Man and a Woman,” and “King of Hearts.”\n\nAdministration was not among Malraux’s many talents. He seems to have been persuaded by people like Moinot, the director of Arts and Letters in his own ministry, that the Cinémathèque and its enormous collection had become too important to be left in the hands of a secretive, overweight, and badly groomed bohemian like Langlois. Langlois’s administrative gifts were not great, either. He was accustomed to operate in a culture of personal loyalty based on common loyalty to an idea, the idea of cinema, and he was not disposed to answer to some bureaucrat for his expenses. He was not inclined to reveal the full extent of his collection, either, since not every movie’s provenance could bear the light of day. Serious friction between Langlois and the government began with the opening of a big new auditorium for the Cinémathèque, made possible by Malraux, at the Palais de Chaillot, on the Right Bank, in 1963. The new facilities were part of a government plan to convert the Cinémathèque from a coterie club into a national institution, but Langlois was not converted along with it, and by the winter of 1968 the ministers had had enough. Barbin was inserted as director, the locks were changed, and vague promises of an advisory role for Langlois were duly uttered. The Gaullists must have imagined that movie lovers would approve the changes; the idea, after all, was to give the Cinémathèque a sounder political and financial foundation, not to close it down. The Gaullists were mistaken.\n\nThe reaction was nearly instantaneous. Langlois was dismissed on a Friday. Within twenty-four hours, forty filmmakers, including Gance, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean Renoir, and Robert Bresson, had withdrawn permission for their films to be shown at what was soon referred to as the Barbinothèque. They were quickly joined by dozens more, including Charlie Chaplin, Roberto Rossellini, Fritz Lang, Richard Lester, Carl Dreyer, Orson Welles, and Jerry Lewis. On Wednesday, a crowd of three thousand showed up at the Trocadéro, in front of the Palais de Chaillot. The demonstration was broken up by a police charge, leaving a number of people slightly wounded, including Truffaut, Godard, and Bernard Tavernier.\n\nBy February 23rd, Cahiers du Cinéma, the critical organ of the New Wave, had collected signatures from more than seven hundred people protesting Langlois’s dismissal. Almost the entire French film industry, including directors, like Marcel Carné, who had little fondness for the Cahiers or the New Wave, put their names to the protest. So did more than a hundred foreign directors, among them Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Luis Buñuel, Peter Brook, Alfred Hitchcock, Elia Kazan, Akira Kurosawa, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Satyajit Ray, and Andy Warhol. Jean-Paul Belmondo, Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve, Marlene Dietrich, Jane Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, Peter O’Toole, Toshiro Mifune, and Gloria Swanson appeared on the list; so did Roland Barthes, Samuel Beckett, Alexander Calder, Truman Capote, Max Ernst, Eugène Ionesco, Pablo Picasso, Paul Ricoeur, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Telegrams continued to pour in: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Pauline Kael, Norman Mailer, Andrew Sarris, Susan Sontag, Iannis Xenakis. It was nearly a Who’s Who of postwar arts and letters.\n\nThere were more demonstrations, more police violence, more telegrams and petitions. At one rally, Jean-Pierre Léaud, the actor who, as a fifteen-year-old, had played Antoine Doinel in Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows” (1959), and was therefore almost the incarnation of the New Wave spirit, gave a speech exhorting the crowd. Malraux backed down. On April 22nd, the general assembly of the Cinémathèque convened and voted to reinstate Langlois, with the tacit approval of Malraux, who, in exchange, pulled the government’s representatives from the assembly and cut funding to a minimum. The Cinémathèque was snatched back from the jaws of the state. On May 2nd, with some fanfare, Langlois reopened the Left Bank screening room, on the Rue d’Ulm. The next day, there were student demonstrations on the streets of Paris. By the twentieth, nearly ten million students and workers were on strike, and the country was virtually shut down. The Langlois Affair had nothing to do with the general strike, but for many people in France it has always seemed the dress rehearsal for the violent, ecstatic, and amazingly brief revolution of May ’68—the revolution that vanished into air.\n\nThe Langlois Affair is the setting for Bernardo Bertolucci’s new movie, “The Dreamers,” which Bertolucci adapted from a novel, “The Holy Innocents” (1988), by the British writer Gilbert Adair. The movie is intense and languid, gritty and dreamy, sexy and silly, sentimental and pretentious, didactic and inconclusive—that is, pure Bertolucci. It is also—assuming, as one needs to with many of Bertolucci’s movies, a willingness to suspend skeptical habits of viewing—rather beautiful in conception. There are three main characters: Matthew, an American film lover who has run off to Paris for reasons never fully explained; Isabelle, a darkly nubile young Frenchwoman; and her twin brother, Théo, also darkly nubile. They are twenty years old. Matthew (played by Michael Pitt) meets the twins in the spring of 1968 during a pro-Langlois demonstration at the Cinémathèque and is invited to dinner at their apartment; when the twins’ parents leave Paris for the seashore, the three enter into a ménage à trois, a sexual and fraternal idyll, during which they rarely leave the house, and which lasts, apparently, several weeks. The story ends with the May riots.\n\nThe ménage is not consummated in every possible combination, which is a change from Adair’s novel, where Matthew’s tastes are, at first guiltily, homosexual, and where Isabelle (or Danielle, as she’s called there) is described as physically boyish. (The actress who plays her in Bertolucci’s movie, Eva Green, is not boyish.) Nor is there, strictly speaking, incest in the movie. The relation between Isabelle and Théo is completely uninhibited: they sleep in the same bed and perform sex acts in one another’s presence. But Matthew does not have sex with Théo (who is played by Louis Garrel), and Théo, apart from masturbating in front of them, doesn’t have sex with either his sister or Matthew. The movie is really the story of Matthew falling in love with an androgynous ideal, male and female halves of a metaphysical one. In the end, the halves cannot be parted, and the twins leave Matthew for the revolution. (Adair has said that he prefers Bertolucci’s version, and intends to rewrite his novel.)\n\nStill, “The Dreamers” has a ratings problem. It was shown, out of competition, at the Venice Film Festival, in September, but the American release is being held up because of the threat of an NC-17 rating (effectively an X). There is a good deal of nudity in “The Dreamers”; Eva Green wears nothing or next to nothing much of the time. More relevant, probably, are a few, detumescent seconds of (in ratings language) “male frontal”; they will probably be reduced to even fewer seconds, and the movie will be released, probably in March, with an R. It is natural for the film’s story and ratings trouble to invite recollections of the previous movie Bertolucci shot in Paris, but this is not 1972, and “The Dreamers” is not “Last Tango in Paris.”\n\nThe road to “Last Tango” runs through the Cinémathèque. Bertolucci was born in 1941 near Parma—in the province that also produced a figure of whom he is in every way the artistic descendant, Giuseppe Verdi. Bertolucci’s father, Attilio, was a distinguished poet and an enormous presence in his son’s life. He turns up repeatedly in the father figures in Bernardo’s movies, including “The Dreamers,” where the father of those interesting twins is supposed to be a famous French poet. Alberto Moravia was a friend. So was Pier Paolo Pasolini, who lived downstairs from the family after they moved to Rome, in 1952. In 1959, as a high-school graduation present, Bertolucci’s parents sent him for a month to Paris, where, at the dawn of the New Wave, he attended the Cinémathèque, and fell in love with cinema.\n\nIn 1961, Bertolucci dropped out of the University of Rome to work as a production assistant on Pasolini’s first film, “Accattone.” Pasolini knew very little about film—he had contributed to a few screenplays, but rarely went to the movies—and Bertolucci later described working with him as like watching a man invent cinema. Bertolucci made his own first feature in 1962, when he was twenty-one—“The Grim Reaper,” from a story by Pasolini. His next movie, finished in 1963, was “Before the Revolution,” a story, loosely based on “The Charterhouse of Parma,” about a young Italian Communist who has a nine-month affair with his attractive, much older, and slightly crazy aunt, but who, disillusioned by the Party’s lack of revolutionary commitment, abandons her—the climactic scene takes place in the Parma opera house during a performance of Verdi’s “Macbeth”—and marries a pretty bourgeoise to please his family. “Fabrizio accepts everything now,” his mother says in the dénouement.\n\nApart from Pasolini, who cited the movie in a famous essay, “The Cinema of Poetry,” in 1965, the Italians hated “Before the Revolution.” The French adored it. The movie was screened during the Critics’ Week at Cannes in 1964, where it won prizes and was identified by French critics as “an homage to the school of the Cahiers,” which it certainly was. Bertolucci had been a regular reader of the Cahiers almost since he was a child—he was introduced to the magazine by his father, who wrote movie reviews as well as poetry—and he was an acolyte of Godard, whose stylistic fingerprints are all over the movie. Bertolucci became the New Wave’s adopted Italian. He went to Paris and met Godard, Langlois, Agnès Varda. Though no one could see his movie, because it lacked a distributor, it became a critical touchstone at the Cahiers. (The movie also played a role in the so-called Hollywood New Wave; it is an influence on Martin Scorsese’s first major picture, “Mean Streets,” which came out in 1973.) For his part, Bertolucci used to say that he preferred to give interviews in French, on the ground that French is the true language of cinema. Langlois himself was responsible for the French release of “Before the Revolution,” which finally happened in 1968. The Cahiers critics all awarded it four stars, their highest rating—“chef d’oeuvre.” By 1968, student radicals were citing it as explanation and inspiration, and the phrase “before the revolution” appeared in accounts of the events of May in the French press.\n\nThe words are taken from a remark of Talleyrand’s: “He who did not live in the years before the revolution cannot understand what the sweetness of living is.” Bertolucci insisted that he meant the title ironically, that life “before the revolution” is agony; he has his protagonist mutter, despairingly, “It’s always ‘before the revolution’ if you’re like me.” But with movies you believe the camera—what the camera loves cannot be all bad—and the camera tells us that although Talleyrand was undoubtedly on the wrong side, he was not wrong. “At first my story was a modern ‘Charterhouse,’ ” Bertolucci explained in an interview in the Cahiers in 1965, “but then it gradually developed into ‘Sentimental Education.’ ” Fabrizio is not a revolutionary; he is playing at being a revolutionary, because that is what young people in the postwar middle class do. His kind of revolution is just a chapter in the bourgeois family romance (thus the incest: it violates the norms of the nuclear family). If “Before the Revolution” is a prophecy of the rebellion of May ’68, in which students from the Sorbonne marched in solidarity with workers from the Renault auto plants, it is also a prophecy of its failure.\n\nBertolucci was not in Paris for the events of May. He was in Rome, making “Partner,” a Godardesque mélange of dogma and surrealism. But his star, Pierre Clémenti, flew to Paris on weekends and brought back stories of the revolution, which, Bertolucci later said, they used as material for the scenes they were shooting. In 1969, Bertolucci joined the Italian Communist Party. He also went into analysis. The analysis explains a lot more about his movies than the Communism does.\n\nKilling the father is a theme that turns up fairly often in interviews with Bertolucci. In “The Conformist” (1970), Bertolucci killed Godard. The movie was adapted from Alberto Moravia’s novel, published in 1951. Its protagonist, Marcello Clerici, is a police spy in Mussolini’s government who is sent to Paris to arrange the assassination of a Professor Quadri, an Italian émigré and political opponent of the regime. Clerici’s principal task is to supply Quadri’s address to the men who will carry out the killing. The address and telephone number that Bertolucci assigned to Quadri in the movie were Godard’s.\n\nThe cold formalism of “The Conformist,” so unlike the hot formalism of Godard, matches the cold formalism of the protagonist, a man who will admit to only one desire, the desire to be normal. Moravia plainly created Clerici in order to explain something about the sort of person who is attracted to fascism; for Bertolucci, though, the politics was less important. He entirely changed the ending of the novel, in which Clerici and his family are killed in an Allied air raid, closing instead with the famous shot of Jean-Louis Trintignant sitting in the rubble of liberated Rome, looking over his shoulder at a male streetwalker—a question mark left hanging forever, like the freeze-frame of Jean-Pierre Léaud’s face at the end of “The 400 Blows.” The movie made Bertolucci an international success, and its imagery, its colors, and its brilliantly managed tempo provided the palette for the first two “Godfather” movies, in 1972 and 1974. And Coppola, after borrowing the palette, borrowed the paintbrush, hiring Bertolucci’s cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, to shoot “Apocalypse Now.”\n\n\"Last Tango in Paris” was made from a screenplay that Bertolucci wrote with Franco Arcalli. Agnès Varda contributed some of the dialogue; so (uncredited) did Moravia. Bertolucci had wanted to use Trintignant and Dominique Sanda, who played Quadri’s bisexual wife in “The Conformist”; but Trintignant was too shy and Sanda was pregnant. Bertolucci was able to persuade Marlon Brando to play the male character, Paul, by showing him “The Conformist.” (Brando had finished filming “The Godfather,” but the movie had not yet come out.) Maria Schneider, who plays Jeanne, was the result of a casting call.\n\n“Last Tango” premièred on October 14, 1972, the last night of the New York Film Festival. It was an event. A week later, Pauline Kael announced, in The New Yorker, that the date “should become a landmark in movie history comparable to May 29, 1913—the night ‘Le Sacre du Printemps’ was first performed—in music history. . . . Bertolucci and Brando have altered the face of an art form.” In December, “Last Tango” opened in Paris and sold a million tickets in a month. It opened in New York City in January, 1973, with tickets at the premium price of five dollars. It was a smash in London. It was banned in Spain. In Italy, the prints were seized by order of the public prosecutor. The order was rescinded by a court, but the prosecution appealed and, eventually, in 1976, succeeded in banning the film. It was not shown in Italy again until 1987. Bertolucci was stripped of his right to vote for five years.\n\nWhat was Kael so excited about? She thought that Bertolucci had solved a problem that was threatening legitimate cinema. The problem was sex. “Last Tango in Paris” was released seven months after “Deep Throat” (a depressing and unfunny anaphrodisiac if there ever was one) inexplicably made hard-core chic. “Last Tango” was a commercial success in the United States: it cost United Artists—whose parent company, Transamerica, was not thrilled to be associated with the product—a million dollars to make, and it ended up grossing more than thirty million here. But “Deep Throat,” also a five-dollar ticket in New York, is estimated to have grossed more than forty million, and it cost twenty-five thousand dollars. You could have made it on a credit card. “The Devil in Miss Jones,” which opened around the same time as “Last Tango,” finished at No. 7 in 1973 American box-office revenues, just behind “Live and Let Die.” There was a market out there; there was also, apparently, critical interest. Intellectuals were taking the stuff seriously. The question was how far Hollywood was prepared to go down the road to explicitness.\n\nAs Jon Lewis points out in “Hollywood v. Hardcore” (2000), the problem arose partly from the replacement of the Production Code with the ratings system. When Jack Valenti became head of the Motion Picture Association of America, in May, 1966, the old world of the Code was in collapse. He found himself sitting in a three-hour meeting trying to decide whether “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” could be released with the words “screw” and “hump the hostess.” (“Hump the hostess” was permitted; “screw” was censored.) A few months later, M-G-M released Antonioni’s “Blow-Up,” featuring female nudity in an orgy scene, without M.P.A.A. approval. It was the first time a major studio had distributed a film with frontal nudity in it. And the nudity sold tickets. I remember seeing “Blow-Up” as a fifteen-year-old, in 1967. There was a middle-aged couple seated behind me in the theatre. When one of the girls in the orgy scene took off her top, the man turned to his wife. “There they are,” he said.\n\nSensing that matters were starting to get out of M.P.A.A. control, Valenti introduced the ratings system, in 1968. But he did an interesting thing: he copyrighted the ratings G, M (soon changed to PG), and R, but not the X rating. In other words, no company could advertise its movie as G-, PG-, or R-rated unless the M.P.A.A. had reviewed it, but anyone could use the X. Valenti’s idea, apparently, was to identify, with the R, a market niche for movies made for grownups, and to delegitimatize hard-core by causing the X to be associated with raunchy, low-budget porn. Which, eventually, is what happened, but for a while it wasn’t at all clear how Hollywood would define its own limits. And the unsettled state of obscenity law made things even more uncertain. No one knew how much frontal the Supreme Court would put up with.\n\n“Last Tango in Paris” was given an X by the M.P.A.A., and it was as an X-rated movie that Kael responded to it. This was X for grownups, she was essentially saying. When hard-core entered the mainstream, she said, “we had expected artistic blue movies, talented directors taking over from the Shlockmeisters and making sophisticated voyeuristic fantasies that would be gorgeous fun—a real turn-on. What nobody had talked about was a sex film that would churn up everybody’s emotions.” That, she believed, was what Bertolucci had done. Norman Mailer disagreed. His reply to Kael ran in The New York Review of Books in May, 1973, when the movie was near the peak of its celebrity. Mailer was not an entirely disinterested interlocutor, since Kael had, in her review of “Last Tango,” taken the occasion to hold up Mailer’s own movies, “Wild 90” and “Beyond the Law,” as examples of failure in the same line. But Mailer made the basic point: the sex in Bertolucci’s movie may be realistic sex, but it is not real sex. “Brando’s real cock up Schneider’s real vagina would have brought the history of film one huge march closer to the ultimate experience it has promised since its inception,” as he suavely formulated the problem.\n\nAnd, after all, Brando never has his pants off while he simulates sex in the movie. Bertolucci tried a scene with male frontal, in fact, but it didn’t work. “It was such a cold day,” Brando explained, “that my penis shrank to the size of a peanut.” Schneider’s naked body is shot from nearly every conceivable angle, but Brando, already on the way to his fat phase, was photographed with great circumspection. Whatever Bertolucci was trying to do with his movie, pushing the genital envelope was not crucial to him. To the extent that people like Mailer, excited by the hard-core insurgency though disappointed by the product, were proposing sexual authenticity as the test for artistic authenticity, Bertolucci declined the gambit. He was making a movie, and the first truth about movies is that they are fake.\n\nBy the time Bertolucci’s “Luna” came out, in 1979, the world had lost interest in cinematic boundaries. The Supreme Court, in cases, decided in 1973 and 1974, involving local bans on obscene material, had basically handed over to the M.P.A.A. the authority to make the distinction between legal and illegal sex. If it was an R, the Constitution shielded it. (The movie in that case was “Carnal Knowledge.”) If it was an X, though, the Court would not overturn a ban. “Luna” was an R, but American critics ridiculed it. Donald Barthelme, in The New Yorker, called it “near-ludicrous,” to which one can only say yes, but you have to get over that. A lot of Verdi is near-ludicrous, too; so, for that matter, is Brando talking about farting pigs while being digitally sodomized by Maria Schneider. With “Luna,” Bertolucci deliberately set out to make a sentimental melodrama, a melodrama that happens to be the story of an opera singer’s incestuous relations with her fifteen-year-old son, who is a heroin addict.\n\nJill Clayburgh, who plays the singer, is as wonderful as Brando and Schneider are in the earlier film. Their wonderfulness comes from their complete willingness (for which the director can take a good deal of credit) to play characters who can express themselves only sexually. (Both Schneider and Brando were shattered by the experience, and for years could barely bring themselves to talk to Bertolucci.) Clayburgh’s character, Caterina, is a successful but not very intelligent or articulate woman. She’s a singer, a person who is somehow more theatrical and less convincing offstage than she is onstage—just as Brando, when his sexual idyll is over, turns out to be a chattering middle-aged man whose trousers are too short, and Schneider reverts to her bourgeois self and marries her boyfriend, a dippy self-styled filmmaker, played by Jean-Pierre Léaud. When Caterina sees her son’s misery, she knows no way to console him except with a parody of the way a mother consoles a baby: she masturbates him while he sucks at her breast. Caterina uses sex as therapy for life’s unhappiness even though she knows, with terrible clarity, that using sex as therapy only prolongs the unhappiness. Her sexuality, like Brando’s in “Last Tango,” is pure and seductive and tragic. Jeanne shoots Paul at the end of “Last Tango” not because she is too shallow to appreciate what he is offering her but because liberation, on those terms, leads to death.\n\nTragedy is what “The Dreamers” does not have. The characters are young and strong and beautiful. They don’t carry, on their perfect bodies, marks of mortality; and though, at the end of their idyll, they flirt with self-destruction, we know they are not going to die, because they have no reason to die. The actors are pretty to watch, even fascinating to watch; but they do not engage. “The Dreamers” will make some people think of Truffaut’s movie about a threesome, “Jules and Jim” (1962), but a much more obvious precursor is Jean-Pierre Melville’s 1950 adaptation of Jean Cocteau’s strange story of sibling love, “Les Enfants Terribles.” The brother and sister in “Les Enfants Terribles” are not lovable; they’re terrible.\n\n\"You can’t hide in a room,” Bertolucci once said, commenting on the meaning of “Last Tango”; “reality will come in through the window.” In “The Dreamers,” he cashes the metaphor: a rock crashes through the window of the twins’ apartment. “The street came into the room,” Isabelle explains. It is May, ’68, and kids are throwing rocks at the police. The lovers rush outside to join them. Matthew refuses to participate in the violence, so the twins leave him behind. Molotov cocktails are thrown, the police charge, and the credits roll. Behind them, Bertolucci plays Piaf: “Non, rien de rien. Non, je ne regrette rien.”\n\nDon’t regret what, exactly? Bertolucci’s own comments about his movie do no better with this question than anyone else’s: we were all pretty deluded back then, but at least we had dreams is the general line. Bertolucci has already mocked this view, in “Luna.” “Oh, the sixties,” Caterina says, dancing gaily at a party, “when we believed in . . . things.” It is an odd, delayed phenomenon of moments of upheaval, like 1968, that at a certain point they stop looking like movements forward and suddenly reveal themselves to have been, at some deeper level, movements backward.\n\nOne of the most astute comments on the Langlois Affair was made by the great French journalist Françoise Giroud—the woman who, in an article about postwar French youth, in 1957, coined the term New Wave. “We have come to this paradoxical situation,” she wrote of the anti-Malraux protesters, in L’Express, in March, 1968: “For the most part, these are ‘left-leaning’ people who want to wrest the Cinémathèque away from the state in order to turn it back into a private enterprise!” High-end French film culture was a private club. You had to pass a test of connoisseurship to belong. Every step toward making it public and democratic was secretly feared, and therefore loudly attacked as a bureaucratic and nationalistic encroachment on the sort of free-thinking cosmopolitanism the protesters imagined themselves to represent.\n\nBut Langlois did not prevail because Godard had his eyeglasses knocked off by the police or because Jean-Pierre Léaud read a speech to the crowd (a clip of which is included in “The Dreamers”). He prevailed because among the friendships he had cultivated in a lifetime of friendship cultivation was that of Jean Riboud and his wife, Krishna, a film enthusiast. Jean Riboud happened to be the chief executive of Schlumberger, the global French oil-services company. He was a man the French government listened to, and he was the intercessor who worked out the deal that allowed Langlois to return from his brief exile. And Langlois also succeeded because Barbin, inexplicably, let it be known that he planned to demand that a copy of every film distributed in France be donated to the Cinémathèque, at a cost of a million francs (about a thousand dollars today). Immediately, the head of the Motion Picture Export Association of America, Frederick Gronich, informed the French government that not only would no prints of American movies be deposited at the Cinémathèque until Langlois was reinstated but all prints already on deposit must be returned within twenty-four hours. Barbin was advised to back down. The Motion Picture Export Association of America is the shadow ruler of the French film industry, for it is, ultimately, the dog that guards the American film market. If you annoy the dog, you don’t get in the house. The empire, in other words, defeated the nation. And what was at stake? Nothing, really, since the age of the repertory cinema and the art house was over, anyway. The Cinémathèque was saved, but it was already a museum, an attraction for tourists like Matthew on their trip to Paris. The events of May lasted only until June, when de Gaulle’s party won a landslide victory in general elections. May was a bubble in the cauldron of modernization that had been brewing in France since 1945.\n\nStill, it was a bubble in which it was good to be young and middle-class. All the normal personal rebelliousness of youth seemed magically echoed in the great world outside. Kids, for the most part, were inside having sex and arguing about whether Jimi Hendrix was a better guitarist than Eric Clapton; but they were aware, in some half-formed way, that something was happening in the streets, and the revolution outside seemed to them perfectly continuous with the little revolution of casting off the middle-class moral code. It was, on the whole, not such a bad dawn in which to be alive.\n\nBertolucci does his best to reanimate the moment: the incestuousness reproduces, a little bit, the frisson of personal rebellion then. But it’s a struggle, and it shows. The present-day Léaud makes a brief appearance in “The Dreamers,” alongside the clip of his younger self. He’s put on weight. So has Bertolucci. So has the teen-age boy who smiled at the squares behind him watching “Blow-Up.” “The Dreamers” has not been well received by the left-wing press in France. “Monstre kitsch,” Libération called it. Bertolucci may once have been a man of the left, the paper said (citing, naturally, “Before the Revolution”), but that was before he became “l’un des mammouths de la superproduction auteuriste de luxe.”\n\nIt’s not his fault. It happens—like when you revisit your kindergarten classroom and are amazed by how tiny the chairs are. There is a reason, I think, that the parents in “The Dreamers,” though they are not onscreen very long, are more compelling than the children, mysterious and somehow lovely in their maturity. They see, at some point, what has been going on in the apartment while they were away at the seashore, and though they decide not to interfere, it plainly doesn’t make sense to them. They’re too old. Bertolucci knows all about this estrangement, for his camera loves the parents, and we should trust the camera. ♦"
