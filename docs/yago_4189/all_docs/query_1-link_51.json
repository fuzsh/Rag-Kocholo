        "text": "\"AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES THAT DOUBLES AS A\n\nCRASH COURSE IN THE EVOLUTION OF FILM LANGUAGE\" - Dennis Lim, LOS ANGELES TIMES (read full article)\n\nAvailable for USA and English Language Canada only\n\nA 3-DVD Collection of More Than 75 Early Films\n\nby Alice Guy • Louis Feuillade • Léonce Perret\n\nThe invention of cinema—and its growth into a sophisticated art form—are vividly brought to life in this massive collection of films from the early years of the influential Gaumont Film Company. Each disc is devoted to one of Gaumont’s artistic directors, who oversaw all film production at the studio, and profoundly influenced not only the identity of the studio but also the evolution of the cinema itself.\n\nMORE THAN TEN HOURS OF FILMS,\n\n1897 - 1913\n\nDVD 1 – ALICE GUY:\n\nBathing in a Stream (1897), At the Hypnotist’s (1898), Wonderful Absinthe (1899), The Cabbage-Patch Fairy (1900), Faust and Mephistopheles (1903), Félix Mayol Performs “White Lilacs” (1905, with synchronized sound), The Consequences of Feminism (1906), On the Barricade (1907), and more!\n\nDVD 2 – LOUIS FEUILLADE:\n\nThe Colonel’s Account (1907), Spring (1909), Custody of the Child (1909), The Defect (1911), The Roman Orgy (1911), The Trust (1911), The Obsession (1912), Tragic Error (1913), Bout de Zan Steals an Elephant (1913), The Agony of Byzance (1913), and more!\n\nDVD 3 – LÉONCE PERRET:\n\nThe Mystery of the Rocks of Kador (1912), The Child of Paris (1913).\n\nIncludes Two New Documentary Shorts:\n\nLouis Feuillade: Master of Many Forms and Léonce Perret: The Filmmaker’s Filmmaker\n\nDVD 1 Alice Guy\n\nFew individual artists have exerted as profound an influence upon the evolution of cinema as Alice Guy (later known as Guy-Blaché). With this collection of more than 60 films, culled from the world’s leading archives and carefully mastered, Guy may no longer be seen as a “woman filmmaker.” These films, produced by Guy for Gaumont before she moved to the US, reveal her to be an unqualified pioneer whose work stands alongside that of the Lumière Brothers, Georges Méliès, and Edwin S. Porter, in cinema’s rapid growth from an optical illusion to a storytelling medium to an art form. Among the highlights are a 19th-century serpentine dance, early “trick” films, experiments with hand-coloring and synchronized sound, comedies, social commentaries, and (as the collection’s centerpiece) a 33-minute religious epic: The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ (1906).\n\n1897\n\nThe Fisherman at the Stream\n\nBathing in a Stream\n\nSerpentine Dance by Mme.

Full-frame (1.33:1)\n\nMusic by Sorties d’Artistes, except\n\nThe Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ: Music by Patrick Laviosa\n\nAmerican Edition produced by Bret Wood\n\nDVD 2 Louis Feuillade\n\nBest remembered today for his espionage serials Les Vampires and Fantômas, Louis Feuillade had a more varied and profound influence upon French cinema than many of his followers realize. For more than a decade, he was the artistic director at Gaumont, encouraging the rise of such filmmakers as Abel Gance and Léonce Perret. This collection of films offers a wider view of Feuillade’s directorial efforts -- but, admittedly, it is only a small portion of the nearly 800 films he is believed to have directed. These films run the gamut of ribald comedy (The Colonel’s Account), charming fantasy (Spring), tragedy (The Heart and Money), social commentary (The Defect) and historical epic (the remarkably poignant The Agony of Byzance). No Feuillade collection would be complete without a sampling of thrillers. To that end, we offer The Trust: Or the Battles for Money and The Obses-sion, which are characterized by the brisk pacing and diabolical tone for which he would become famous.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE\n\nLouis Feuillade: Master of Many Forms\n\nThis collection of scenes from more than twenty films demonstrates Feuillade’s mastery of (and influence upon) a wide range of cinematic genres.\n\nThe Colonel’s Account (1907, 4 min.)\n\nA Very Fine Lady (1908, 3 min.)\n\nSpring (1909, 7 min.)\n\nThe Fairy of the Surf (1909, 7 min.)\n\nCustody of the Child (1909, 11 min.)\n\nThe Defect (1911, 41 min.)\n\nThe Roman Orgy (1911, 8 min.)\n\nThe Trust (1911, 24 min.)\n\nThe Heart and the Money (1912, 17 min.)\n\nThe Obsession (1912, 23 min.)\n\nTragic Error (1913, 24 min.)\n\nBout de Zan Steals an Elephant (1913, 9 min.)\n\nThe Agony of Byzance (1913, 29 min.)\n\nCurated by Pierre Philippe\n\nTotal running time: 217 Min.\n\nFull-frame (1.33:1)\n\nMusic by Patrick Laviosa\n\nAmerican Edition produced by Bret Wood\n\nDVD 3 Léonce Perret\n\nUntil now, the films of Léonce Perret have been virtually unseen in the United States, yet he was a hugely influential figure in the growth of the French film industry. As an actor, he appeared in more than 100 films from 1909 to 1916, including the long-running series of “Léonce” comedies. But his greater contribution was as a director. Working at Gaumont under the supervision of Louis Feuillade, Perret set the standard to which other French filmmakers aspired. His films had a technical mastery and aesthetic grace that allowed them to reveal subtleties of character and meaning.\n\nPerret’s artistic maturity is beautifully represented in the influential feature The Child of Paris, a naturalistic drama reminiscent of Émile Zola. Of this film, critic Georges Sadoul proclaimed, “Léonce Perret was able to render a graceful and lively story by using an extraordinarily refined cinematic repertoire: backlighting, low-angle shots, close-ups, moving shots and numerous other innovations, all of which Perret implemented with flair, in stark contrast to...the still somewhat primitive technique of David W. Griffith at that time.”\n\nPerret made a number of self-referential films, in which the medium of cinema is a component of the plotline. In The Mystery of the Rocks of Kador, an amnesiac woman undergoes a sort of cinematic hypnosis as a means of recalling the details of a tragic crime.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURE:\n\nLéonce Perret: The Filmmaker’s Filmmaker\n\nIllustrated with rare film clips, this mini-documentary reveals the artistry and wit of French cinema’s unsung hero.\n\nThe Mystery of the Rocks of Kador\n\n(Le Mystère des roches de Kador)\n\n1912 Color Tinted 43 Min. Directed by Léonce Perret\n\nThe Child of Paris (L’Enfant de Paris)\n\n1913 Color Tinted 124 Min.\n\nWritten and directed by Léonce Perret\n\nCurated by Pierre Philippe Full-frame (1.33:1)\n\nMusic by Philippe Dubosson\n\nAmerican Edition produced by Bret Wood"
