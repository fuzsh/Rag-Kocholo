        "text": "LOS ANGELES — It starts with spider sex.\n\nLouise Linton, in character as Catherine Black, an exquisitely attired bisexual sociopath, watches a hairy spider tiptoe across her desk. It comes a little bit closer. And closer. In steely voice-over, Catherine contemplates the peculiarities of arachnid biology: how some females kill and consume their partners after sex. Why are some males willing to risk anything, even copulatory suicide, to get it?\n\nAnd then she tosses the critter into her mouth: chomp.\n\nThis is “Me You Madness,” a comedic thriller that was also written, directed and produced by Ms. Linton, the much-vilified wife of Steven Mnuchin, the departing Treasury secretary."
