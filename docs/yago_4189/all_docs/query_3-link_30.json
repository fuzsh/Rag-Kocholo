        "text": "Abel Gance, the cinematic pioneer whose 1927 classic ''Napoleon'' is still acclaimed by audiences around the world, died tonight at his Paris apartment, friends of the family reported. He was 92.\n\nThe friends said that Mr. Gance had been in a hospital in Boulogne since Nov. 1 for a lung ailment. His condition had deteriorated, they said, and his adopted daughter Clarisse decided to take him home Tuesday night.\n\nA Technical Virtuoso By JOSH BARBANEL\n\nThough Mr. Gance continued to direct films and television scripts into the 1960's, his period of greatest independence and vision extended from the close of World War I, when he produced the first postwar pacifist film, to the closing days of silent film, when ''Napoleon'' was first shown.\n\n''Napoleon,'' originally titled ''Napoleon Vu Par Abel Gance'' or Napoleon as Seen by Abel Gance, was first shown in 1927, and is recognized as the greatest technical achievement of the silent-film era, using every technique known in cinema up to that day and more.\n\nThe original four-and-a-half-hour film was the first to use three cameras simultaneously for a wide-screen effect to contain Mr. Gance's sweeping vision of history. Decades later, the technique became popular as Cinerama. The Camera as Participant\n\nMr. Gance also freed the camera from silent cinematic conventions by using it as an active instrument that participates in the drama. The camera is set on a galloping horse, a swinging pendulum, suspended from wires, all in the service of Mr. Gance's vast, romantic story of a Napoleon who assumes the dimensions of a heavensent savior.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
