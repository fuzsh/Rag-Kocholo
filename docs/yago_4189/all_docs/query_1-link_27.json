        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nSELECTED TEXTS 1 Firmin Gemier (1865—1933) was a famous actor and director who collaborated with Antoine at the Theatre Antoine and the Theatre de l'Odeon, and occasionally worked in the cinema. His most celebrated stage role came in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, which he staged in the early 1920s. 2 Emmy Lynn briefly enjoyed some success as an actress in the films of Abel Gance and her husband, Henry Roussel, during the late 1910s and early 1920s. 3 Leonce-H. Burel (1892—1977), who was responsible for the \"rare richness\" in lighting, was one of the top cinematographers of the French silent period. He worked first with Abel Gance on such films as Mater Dolorosa (1917). La Dixieme Symphonie (1918), J'Accuse (1919), and La Roue (1922), and then with Jacques Feyder on Crainquebille (1923), Visages d'enfants (1925), and L'Image (1926). In the 1950s, he worked often with Robert Bresson. LOUIS DELLUC, \"Beauty in the Cinema\" From \"La Beaute au cinema,\" Le Film 73 (6 August 1917), 4-5. ACHANCE evening at a cinema on the Boulevards gave me such extraordinary artistic pleasure that it seemed to have nothing at all to do with art. For a long time, I have realized that the cinema was destined to provide us with impressions of evanescent eternal beauty, since it alone offers us the spectacle of nature and sometimes even the spectacle of real human activity. You know, those impressions of grandeur, simplicity, and clarity which suddenly cause you to consider art useless. Obviously, art would be utterly useless if each of us was capable of appreciating consciously the profound beauty of the passing moment. But the education of a responsive mass of people is going too slowly for us to deprive ourselves yet of the many centuries of artworks which ensure the exalted confidence of others' spirits. The cinema is rightly moving toward the suppression of art, which reveals something beyond art, that is, life itself. Otherwise, it would merely be a median term between stylization and transient reality. And it has so much progress to make up for in order to reach perfection that we cannot say exactly when the screen will have trained us sufficiently— and this will be wonderful—to see into nature and the human heart. Already much more than a reflection of this vibrant natural beauty has been revealed to us here and there. I would say much more about travelogues except that they are far too short. If the companies which lease them still do not comprehend that, it serves them right. Why do these views— I have seen some whose lighting and photography prove the cameraman's skill—last no more than a hundred meters? The poster announces Japan, Peru, or the Himalayas, and it barely lifts the curtain. The success of certain documentary films, significant in subject matter and intelligently exhibited , however, has provided evidence of the public taste for these armchair voyages. And the public is ready to go farther than the North Pole. PART TWO 1915-1919 Advice to the cinema owner who would be the first to let us pass an entire evening in Italy, Spain, or Poland. Tourists would hasten there in droves. This week everyone in Paris is praising a film which is, in fact, astonishing . Who has not yet seen the passage of that military convoy of ships in stormy weather. It is beautiful. I have had occasion to see this film three times, in three different cinemas, with three kinds of audiences. The enthusiasm has been the same in all three. As well as the heavy sigh at the end, which came all too soon. There, that's beauty, real beauty—I would say the beauty of chance, but the cameraman must be given his due. He has learned how to see with such skill that we have exactly the same experience of the sea, sky, and wind as he himself had. It is not just a film. It is natural truth, and the thought that such views will be offered us in abundance for the next several years is a great consolation. After this, how can one indulge in the blunders of a totally new art which the French have shackled with all manner of embellishments? No matter, it will unshackle itself. The same program included two masterpieces. . . . Yes, Ames d'etrangers {Alien Souls, 1916} and Chariot cambrioleur [Police, 1916}, are they not masterpieces ? Quickly, tell me why, even if you believe..."
