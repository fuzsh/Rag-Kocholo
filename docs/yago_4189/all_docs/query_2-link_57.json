        "text": "If you’re unfamiliar with flapper-era icon Louise Brooks, that’s easy enough to remedy.\n\nCheck out “Pandora’s Box” and “Diary of a Lost Girl.”\n\nBoth silent German films made in 1929, they’re remarkable for many reasons, especially their lead actress. Brooks, wearing her black hair in a bob that came to symbolize the Jazz Age, transcends time with her subtle acting (unlike the work of her melodramatic contemporaries), projecting a depth of intelligence, an unshakeable independence, a provocative sensuality. She could have been a great star in any era, including this one.\n\nInstead, her film career was cut short, apparently because of her dislike of the Hollywood scene and her refusal to play by the rules.\n\n“The Chaperone,” based on a novel by Laura Moriarty and set in 1922, concerns Brooks as a talented, rebellious 15-year-old dancer from Wichita, Kansas. When Louise (Haley Lu Richardson) has the opportunity to study with a respected dance company in New York, her self-consumed pianist mother (Victoria Hill) seeks out a chaperone to accompany her. She finds one in Norma Carlisle (Elizabeth McGovern), a conventional wife and mother who inexplicably (at first) volunteers to travel with Louise and stay with her during her time in New York.\n\nMuch of the film involves the tension between flirtatious wild child Louise and the more reserved Norma. To say it’s a battle of wills would be putting it too strongly – “The Chaperone,” written by Julian Fellowes, the driving force behind “Downton Abbey,” and directed by Michael Engler, who also has worked on the show, is too restrained for that kind of intensity. But, despite Norma’s resolve to fulfill her role and keep Louise out of trouble, Louise is even more determined to get out and experience life.\n\nAs the title suggests, the film is in many ways more Norma’s story than Louise’s. It’s about her secret mission while in New York, and how Louise perhaps influences her more than the other way around.\n\nBut it doesn’t come as a huge surprise that Louise Brooks – even the teenage Louise Brooks – is far and away the more fascinating character, and every scene in which she appears has a spark that the rest of the movie lacks. Richardson (“Five Feet Apart,” “The Edge of Seventeen”) steals the film as this lifetime-rebel-in-the-making, who even at her young age understands her power over men and knows how to use it to her advantage. At the same time, it’s clear that this sexual precociousness has come at a price – a premature loss of innocence not of her making.\n\nAnd that, the film and Richardson subtly suggest, might be the underlying tragedy of Louise Brooks.\n\nWhat: “The Chaperone”\n\nStar rating: ***\n\nStarring: Elizabeth McGovern, Haley Lu Richardson, Geza Rohrig and Campbell Scott\n\nDirected by: Michael Engler\n\nWritten by: Julian Fellowes\n\nBased on: the novel by Laura Moriarty\n\nRunning time: 103 minutes\n\nRating: Not rated\n\nWhere: Chatham Orpheum Theater\n\nNow Showing"
