        "text": "Louise Brooks, the legendary silent film icon who spent more than the last third of her life as a recluse in Rochester, will be the subject of a film that's in the works for 2018.\n\nPBS and Masterpiece Theatre have announced the production of its first feature film, and it will reunite the writer, director and star of Downton Abbey.\n\nThe source for the film will be The Chaperone, Laura Moriarty’s best-selling novel, which supposes what may have happened when a 36-year-old housewife from Wichita, Kansas, volunteered to be a chaperone for the talented but rambunctiously free-spirited 15-year-old Louise Brooks as she goes to New York in 1922 to study modern dance.\n\nBrooks eventually became a featured dancer with the Ziegfeld Follies, and then a silent film star, eventually acclaimed as perhaps the first modern actress. But those events occurred after the time portrayed in Moriarty's fictionalized account.\n\nNow, for the Downton Abbey connections: The Chaperone will be scripted by Julian Fellowes and directed by Michael Engler, and will star Elizabeth McGovern, who played Lady Grantham in the hit series. McGovern will be the title character, while Julia Goldani Telles (of TV's The Affair and Nurse Jackie) will play the teenage Louise.\n\nThe book is an entertaining story of a conservative Midwest woman, trying without much success to corral a rambunctious and wild teenage girl amid the urban delights of Manhattan. As a friend of the late Louise Brooks, and a longtime student of her life and career, I found the book leaning more on the older woman than on the teenage girl, but I still enjoy it, and look forward to the film adaptation, especially with a script by the notable Julian Fellowes.\n\nIn her great memoir, Lulu in Hollywood, Brooks seemed to barely remember her chaperone, except that she was \"a stocky, bespectacled housewife of 36.\" Brooks added that she only tolerated the chaperone's \"provincialism because she shared my love of the theater.\"\n\nDespite her Kansas roots and American background, Brooks' most notable films were three European gems — Pandora's Box, Diary of a Lost Girl and Prix de Beauté. Her American titles included Beggars of Life, The Canary Murder Caseand the early John Wayne westernOverland Stage Raiders, which was her last film.\n\nShe lived in an apartment at 7 N. Goodman St. in Rochester from 1956, during a time when she studied film at the George Eastman Museum, wrote articles for academic film journals, and compiled her memoir, Lulu in Hollywood. Brooks died in 1985 at the age of 78.\n\nThe Chaperone will present the film to distributors at the Cannes Film Festival this month. Masterpiece officials say it will air on PBS stations nationwide after its initial theatrical run.\n\n'Chasing Trane'\n\nThe first One Take Film Festival, celebrating documentary film, wraps up Sunday, May 21. However, The Little Theatre's tradition of showcasing one documentary film each month will continue. And, boy, they've got a winner for June.\n\nChasing Trane: The John Coltrane Documentary, a superb new film on the life and music of the late, legendary saxophonist, is being screened at 7 p.m. June 13 and 3 p.m. June 17.\n\nThe film is enriched with great performances, along with fabulous interviews with performers, family members and observers (including perceptive comments from that other \"saxophonist,\" former President Bill Clinton). also love the extensive use impressionistic artwork in the film and on the poster by Rudy Gutierrez, from the book Spirit Seeker: John Coltrane's Musical Journey.\n\nThe film's title is adapted from a famous, high-powered Coltrane track, \"Chasing the Trane,\" from his Village Vanguard recordings. The film's appearance at the Little also serves as a grand prologue to the Xerox Rochester International Jazz Festival, which will be held June 23-July 1.\n\nBaby Jane\n\nIf you were among those (like me) who recently watched the intriguing, hard-boiled FX TV Series, Feud: Bette and Joan, about the bitter, mean-spirited relationship between Hollywood Golden Age actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, you'll be interested in two films on Turner Classic Movies on Monday night, May 22. Both figured prominently in Feud.\n\nThe primary film — the centerpiece in Feud — is What Ever Happened to Baby Jane, a Robert Aldrich fright flick, with performances by Crawford and a particularly grotesque Davis. Baby Jane airs at 8 p.m.\n\nThe secondary film was detailed as an example of a schlock horror role taken by Crawford. It's Strait-Jacket, a 1964 horror film by William Castle. It's at 10:30 p.m."
