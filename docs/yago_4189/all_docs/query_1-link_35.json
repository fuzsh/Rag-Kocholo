        "text": "art as a means of reinventing what has been lost, only to find you have much more to lose than you think you do. endlessly inquisitive, dramatic and singular, the image and the sound become one, both invented at the same instance of consciousness, finally reunited.\n\nThe idea that the great Abel Gance once directed a biopic of Ludwig Van Beethoven is an appealing realization. No less so when knowing that heavyweight French actor Harry Baur has the lead. What Gance did here was combine his great masterpieces and adding life to various segments of the great composer's life, focusing on his loves, gradual deafness and eventual poverty. Doesn't quite reach the greatness of Beethoven's genius, but there are many strong points in this visual composition combined with an attempt to discover the person Beethoven was.\n\nFirst off: there's two different versions of this film floating around, and the only reason I know the details of what I'm about to say is because of a CriterionForum post from 2008. The French release of this film is of better quality and opens with a garden party, the U.S. release is much dingier looking and opens with Beethoven looking at his grieving neighbor's window. Unfortunately, there's only English subtitles for the U.S. version, and it looks more like scenes were shuffled rather than recut (the opening scenes of each version appear in the other shortly afterward), but I don't know for sure. My need to learn French only grows more urgent. (EDIT: it has been determined that the…\n\nThe music alone made this more than worth watching, plus it being directed by the grand Gance and starring one of the best French actors of the time. It has all the qualities and strengths of the making of a great picture, with some memorable cinematography.\n\nUltimately what keeps it from being a masterpiece is the story, it’s good but imagine a Beethoven film focusing on something other than a love triangle.\n\n+++ It made me play Beethoven for the following two hours.\n\n1936 COLLECTION\n\nABEL GANCE RANKED\n\nSet in 1801, this is the story of the \"immortal beloved\" who was Beethoven's mysterious correspondent, and purports to reveal the truth behind the legend. That aspect of the film pretty middling melodrama. Harry Baur as Beethoven is sometimes affecting, sometimes overly stagy.\n\nThe neat thing is that all the music in the film, whether diegetic or setting the mood, is Beethoven's. Especially after he goes deaf, his music becomes the soundtrack to Beethoven's mind, a part of how we understand him. It gives the film a near-unique quality (Forman's Amadeus accomplishes the same thing for Mozart). The specific moment where Beethoven loses his hearing is quite fascinating: the sounds of the world, Beethoven's own music, transform into a distorted modernistic shriek, and then, ultimately, into total silence.\n\nWeird that the English title uses the plural (\"Loves\"), since the whole point of the immortal beloved is that she was the only one.\n\nThe first half and the ending are some of the best Abel Gance has been in years here, really solid stuff, except for the second chunk of the movie, which leans heavily on a romance drama that unfortunately doesn't work\n\nI do think this is worth a watch for the other stuff tho! If you wanna see a good Abel Gance movie made after Napoléon do check this one out. It's got a lot of his style in this, even if it's kinda abandoned to favor melodrama\n\nSome of the most creative sound editing in the 1930s, period"
