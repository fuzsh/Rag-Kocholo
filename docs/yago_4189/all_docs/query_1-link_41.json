        "meta_description": "This chapter treats Germaine Dulac’s ‘psychological films’, or what has come to be known as Dulac’s ‘Impressionist’ cinema, as she worked among the filmmakers of this first avant-garde movement, Marcel L’Herbier, Jean Epstein, Abel Gance, and Louis Delluc. For Dulac, Impressionist cinema meant the ‘psychological film’, which placed a character in a particular situation in order to penetrate the secret domain of their inner life. The chapter explores the extent to which Germaine Dulac was able to make the inner life of the characters in her films, as well as their reality, accessible to the public. Dulac’s ‘psychological films’ would help to define a specifically French style of cinema in the face of strong American post-war competition. Dulac herself tells us that her film La Cigarette (1919) marked the beginning of her work in psychological film, a genre that she would not abandon until La Folie des vaillants (1925), when she began to pursue more overtly her interest in musically composed film.",
