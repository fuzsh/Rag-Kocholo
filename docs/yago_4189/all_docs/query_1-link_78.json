        "text": "A GREAT FRENCH ACTRESS SEIZES THE LIMELIGHT AT A MAJOR RETROSPECTIVE BY BERNARD DREW --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bernard Drew is an author and critic who writes regularly about film. PARIS ''Looking back over 50 years of making films, I don't think I can remember more than 10 of them,'' Edwige Feuillere sighs. ''I do recall that in the 1930's, when I was very busy making movies, French actresses were only permitted to play prostitutes, courtesans and striptease artists. I had to wait for the end of the war to become aristocratic and noble.\n\nLast year, when Part I of ''Rediscovering French Film'' appeared at the Museum of Modern Art, more films starring Miss Feuillere were shown than of any other French star.\n\nWhen Part II of ''Rediscovering French Film'' opens this Thursday at the brand new Roy and Niuta Titus Auditorium, scheduled to last, on and off, for the rest of the year, at least five and possibly more of Miss Feuillere's films will be on the program.\n\nThey include Abel Gance's 1935 ''Lucrece Borgia,'' Max Ophuls's 1939 ''Sans Lendemain,'' Robert Siodmak's 1936 ''Mister Flow,'' probably Autant-Lara's 1953 ''Le Ble en Herbe'' and Autant-Lara's 1958 ''En Cas de Malheur'' and possibly more."
