        "text": "In 1930, Claude, who was a stage-struck set designer at the Oden Theater, a repertory house in Paris, learned an ailing actor's part in two hours and took it over without a rehearsal. Tristan Bernard, the famous French playwright and producer took notice of this feat. He engaged Dauphin for the leading role of his next play \"La fortune\" was was also made into a film the next year. Dauphin's next break came when Charles Boyer left for American movies. As Boyer left for America, Dauphin succeeded in the Henri Bernstein organization, outstanding stage producers in Paris. Before the outbreak of World War II, Dauphin starred in several plays as well as 65 French-made pictures. Dauphin received his elementary education at Ecole Fenelon and high school at Lycee Condorcet. he also graduated from Lycee Louis de Grand in literature and philosophy, all of these schools located in Paris. Between 1940 and 1945, he was a soldier in the French and Allied armies. He was a lieutenant in the French tank service and would shudder later in life at his memories of that kind of grisly warfare. After the fall of France, he organized his own stock company and toured non-occupied cities and small towns. he was also serving in the French underground movement. Threatened with exposure, he escaped by buying a small fishing boat in the south of France and sailing to Gibraltar. After reaching London in 1942, he first served with the British Secret Service and then joined the Free French forces of DeGaulle. Claude quickly learned English, of which he was unfamiliar, and became a liaison officer between the French LeClerc division and the press corps of the American Army and General Patton. Because of this association, he was one of the first to enter Paris on Liberation Day. Dauphin's American film debut was in the movie \"Deported\", produced primarily in Italy. He later appeared in many stage productions on Broadway including \"No Exit\" and \"Happy Time\". He later had a screen test with Warner Bros. and then returned to France. Having almost forgotten about the test, he was summoned to Hollywood for \"April in Paris\" starring Doris Day and Ray Bolger.\n\nOrson Welles once called beloved French character star Raimu (né Jules Auguste Cesar Muraire) \"the greatest actor who ever lived.\" It is hard to argue the compliment of one genius to another.\n\nThe jowly, cigar-chomping comedian was born in Toulon, France on December 17, 1883 of very humble means, his father making ends meet as an upholsterer. Raimu began his stage career at age 16 as a music hall extra imitating famous French comic idols. Using the stage name of Raimut (he later dropped the \"t\"), he eventually gained a following in dance halls, cafe concerts, nightclubs and pubs as an entertainer but cemented his reputation on the Parisian comedy stages. Around this time, he also began to appear in minor roles in silent film shorts (1911-1917), but nothing much came from them and he left the screen.\n\nContinuing to thrive on the live stage, Raimu's serious intentions as an actor were solidified with the 1929 stage production of the Marcel Pagnol play \"Marius,\" which told story of a wanderlust sailor, his wife Fanny and father César. Raimu transferred the role of César brilliantly to the film trilogy Marius (1931), Fanny (1932) and César (1936) all co-starring Pierre Fresnay as Marius and Orane Demazis as Fanny. He went on to work with Pagnol quite frequently.\n\nClosely identifying himself with the iron-willed working class, Raimu swayed quite effectively from humor to great pathos in characters that reminded one in looks and flavor of a grubby, weary-looking Honoré de Balzac. Immortalized in Pagnol's trilogy, arguably celebrated as the greatest series ever put together, Raimu continued to charm in primarily 1930's social comedies. His star role with leads in Le blanc et le noir (1931), La petite chocolatière (1932), Mamsell Nitouche (1931), Théodore et Cie (1933), the title roles in Charlemagne (1933) and Tartarin de Tarascon (1934), Der König (1936), Faisons un rêve... (1936), Vous n'avez rien à déclarer? (1937), Le héros de la Marne (1938), Monsieur Brotonneau (1939) and Noix de coco (1939). For his superb work in both Julien Duvivier's Spiel der Erinnerung (1937) and Pagnol's Der Bäcker und seine Frau (1938), he won the National Board of Review award.\n\nAlong the way Raimu worked with a host of legendary directors including Marc Allégret, Henri Decoin, Alexander Esway and Sacha Guitry. His film popularity continued to soar into the war years with roles in Pagnol's Die Tochter des Brunnenbauers (1940), as well as L'homme qui cherche la vérité (1940), Das unheimliche Haus (1942), Das Geheimnis der blauen Limousine (1942), Les petits riens (1941), Untel père et fils (1943) and the title role in Balzac's Gräfin Chabert (1943). He also returned to the theatre in such productions as \"The Bourgeois Gentleman\" and \"The Imaginary Invalid.\"\n\nRaimu returned to filming following the war with Les gueux au paradis (1946) co-starring Fernandel. In March of 1946, while shooting his next post-war film Der ewige Gatte (1946), he was involved in a car accident that would require some surgery. The 62-year-old actor died of a heart attack on September 20th following an allergic reaction to anesthesia while on the table for a minor leg operation. The outpouring of grief felt by his native country was monumental.\n\nSurvived by wife (from 1936) Esther Metayer (1905-1977) and daughter, Paulette Brun (1925-1992). Raimu was laid to rest in a cemetery in the town where he was born. In 1961, the French government placed his image on an honorary postage stamp.\n\nCharles Vanel was a French actor. His film career lasted for 76 years, from 1912 to 1988. He appeared in over 200 films.\n\nVanel often worked under famous directors, such as Luis Buñuel, Henri-Georges Clouzot, Jacques Feyder, and Alfred Hitchcock. A career highlight was his role as truck driver Jo in the thriller film \"The Wages of Fear\" (1953). In France, it was the 4th highest earning film of the year. The film won both the Golden Bear and the Palme d'Or.\n\nVanel won the Best Actor award of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival , for his role as Wolf Andergast in the drama film \"L'affaire Maurizius\" (1954).\n\nVanel had a supporting role in the thriller film \"To Catch a Thief\" (1955) as restaurant owner Monsieur Bertani, who is a veteran of the French Resistance. In retrospect, the film was considered one of Hitchcock's strongest films.\n\nVanel won the Best Actor award of the San Sebastian International Film Festival, for his role as Albatrasse in the thriller film \"Burning Fuse\" (1957).\n\nIn 1979, Vanel received a Honorary César Award for his career. In 1981, he won the Best Supporting Actor award in the David Di Donatello Awards, for his role as pater familias Donato Giuranna in the drama film \"Three Brothers\".\n\nVanel's last film role was in the film \"Les Saisons du plaisir\" (1988). He died in April 1989, at the age of 96.\n\nCelebrated French stage actor/director/producer Jean-Louis Barrault was born on September 8, 1910. A superlative tragedian and mime, his dedication to both avant-garde and classical plays helped revive the French theatre after World War II, while presenting world premières of works by such playwrights as Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco and Jean Genet. A rebel with many causes, he once hid French Underground members on the set of his greatest film Kinder des Olymp (1945).\n\nBarrault initially was a teacher and studied art before turning to the theatre. A gifted student of both Charles Dullin of drama and Etienne Decroux of pantomime, he supported himself as a bookkeeper and flower salesman during those lean years. He made his official film bow in Vagabonds imaginaires (1950) (billed as J.L. Barrault), and took his first curtain call a year later playing a servant in \"Volpone\" at the Theatre de l'Atelier. While he made quite an impact in numerous classic, romantic films, including Ein sonderbarer Fall (1937), Mirages (1938) and Kinder des Olymp (1945) (the last two opposite the exquisite Arletty), the theatre would remain Barrault's greatest passion, marking his directorial debut with \"Les beaux jours\" in 1935. Five years later he would join the Comedie Francaise as both actor/director.\n\nIn 1936 Barrault met actress Madeleine Renaud, who was a decade his senior, and married her four years later. Together the couple founded many theatres (including the Renaud-Barrault Paris stage company in 1947) and toured extensively, becoming the Lunt and Fontanne of European theatre with such performances in \"Christopher Columbus\" (1957) (she as his Queen Isabella), \"The Misanthrope\" (1957) and \"The Marriage of Figaro\" (1964) among their many collaborations. In November of 1952, Barrault and Renard made daunting Broadway debuts touring in repertory with \"Les Fausses Confidences\", \"Baptiste\", \"The Trial\", \"Amphitryon\", \"Scapin\", \"Keep Your Eyes on Amelie\" and \"Hamlet\". In 1957, they returned with \"Christopher Columbus\", \"Volpone\", \"The Misanthrope\", \"Intermezzo\", and others. He received a \"special\" Tony award for his work.\n\nBarrault's thin frame, gentle bearing and sensitive features belied a great power and those same talents were utilized magnificently, if sporadically, on film, associating with the greatest of directors including Abel Gance, Georg Wilhelm Pabst, Sacha Guitry, Jean Delannoy, Max Ophüls and Jean Renoir. His initial impression playing Beethoven's nephew Karl in Beethovens große Liebe (1936), led to other fine filming. Arguably his most notable triumph on film was his portrayal of Baptiste in Kinder des Olymp (1945), which was based on the life of the mime-actor Jean-Gaspard Deburau, a character he originally suggested to Marcel Carné and Jacques Prévert. The phenomenal success of that film singlehandedly revived public interest in the art of pantomime and subsequently influenced the popularity of legendary mime Marcel Marceau. Barrault's peerless performance in that role is still studied in acting and mime schools today. Elsewhere, he appeared in historical characterizations ranging from that of composer Hector Berlioz to Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nIn later years Barrault served twice as director of the Theatre des Nations and in 1974-1981 was the director of the Theatre d'Orsay. His last film performance at age 78 was in La lumière du lac (1988). The beloved 83-year-old actor died of a heart attack in Paris on January 22, 1994; wife Madeleine died in September of that same year at age 94.\n\nOrson Welles once called beloved French character star Raimu (né Jules Auguste Cesar Muraire) \"the greatest actor who ever lived.\" It is hard to argue the compliment of one genius to another.\n\nThe jowly, cigar-chomping comedian was born in Toulon, France on December 17, 1883 of very humble means, his father making ends meet as an upholsterer. Raimu began his stage career at age 16 as a music hall extra imitating famous French comic idols.

Raimu was laid to rest in a cemetery in the town where he was born. In 1961, the French government placed his image on an honorary postage stamp.\n\nErich von Stroheim was born Erich Oswald Stroheim in 1885, in Vienna, Austria, to Johanna (Bondy), from Prague, and Benno Stroheim, a hatter from Gleiwitz, Germany (now Gliwice, Poland). His family was Jewish.\n\nAfter spending some time working in his father's hat factory, he emigrated to America around 1909. Working in various jobs he arrived in Hollywood in 1914 and got work in D.W. Griffiths' company as a bit player. America's entry into WW1 enabled him to play sadistic monocled German officers but these roles dried up when the war ended. He turned to writing and directing but his passion for unnecessary detail such as Austrian guards wearing correct and expensively acquired regulation underwear which was never seen in 'Foolish Wives' caused the budget to reach a reported $1 million. Although the film became a hit the final edit was given to others resulting in a third of his footage being cut. Irving Thalberg fired him from 'Merry Go Round' which was completed by Rupert Julien. He then started on 'Greed', which when completed was unreleasable being 42 reels with a running time of 7 hours. It was eventually cut down to 10 reels which still had a striking effect on audiences. 'The Wedding March' was so long that even in it's unfinished state it was released as two separate films in Europe. Gloria Swanson fired him from her production of 'Queen Kelly' when with no sign of the film nearing completion the costs had risen to twice the budget partly due to him re-shooting scenes that had already been passed by the Hays office. She then had to spend a further $200,000 putting the footage into releasable state. It was the end for him as a director, but he made a reasonable success as an actor in the talkies."
