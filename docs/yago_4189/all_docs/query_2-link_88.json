        "text": "New 4K Restoration\n\nThelma and Louise – a bored housewife and a straight-laced waitress at a coffee shop – are best friends who are sick of what they’ve settled for. Deciding to escape the tedium of their everyday lives, the pair sneak off in Louise’s ’66 T-bird convertible for a three-day fishing trip with no husbands, no boyfriends and no problems. But things don’t go quite according to plan when an encounter with a drunken, foul-mouthed, would-be rapist transforms their quiet getaway into a cross-country escape that will change their lives forever.\n\nThelma & Louise has been digitally restored from a new 4K 16 bit scan, supervised by director Ridley Scott using the original negative. The film has been restored by The Criterion Collection with participation from MGM Studios and Park Circus."
