        "text": "J'ACCUSE (Films Abel Gance, 1918-19)\n\nDistributed in France by Charles Pathe; released in the U.S.A. through United Artists, 1921. Written, produced and directed by Abel Gance; made with the cooperation of the French\n\nArmy Cinematographic Service. Assistant to the director - Blaise Cendrars; photographed by L.H. Burel, Andre Bujard, Maurice Forster; montage by Andre Danis.\n\nWith: Severin-Mars (Francois) Maxims Desjardins (Mario) Manse Dauvray (His daughter); Romuald Joube (Jean Diaz) Mancini (Mme Diaz) Angele Guys (Little Angele).\n\nMost Gance films today (from his silent period at least) are frustrating affairs to attempt to research or see. Apart from abstract descriptions of style, critical comment on the film is usually uninformative; and the films themselves survive in such fragmentary form that it is not only unfair but also impossible to reach any kind of a verdict on them. A further frustration is that few people really seem to care about Gance, which may account for the limited attempts by museums and archives to preserve his work. (When we revived a substantial, 7-reel version of his marvellous Napoleon a few years back, response was positively apathetic - and the audience half the size of our average turnout for any Clara Bow film!) J'Accuse, in its original form, was a monumental work that was premiered in four parts through April of 1919, and ran to a total of 17 reels! This \"condensation\", running only four reels, thus represents less than a quarter of the original work. Too, the print derives from several sources and is only of fair quality. Titles are in French and Italian, and so brief as to be difficult to read even if one were fluent in those languages. There is overlapping footage from both Italian and French prints -- sometimes the same thing happens twice, but not quite in the same way! Obviously, one cannot judge the original by this version -- nor, we suggest, should you expend too much energy in trying to understand it all. (Even in complete. and uncut form, the mystical Gance is sometimes tough to figure out!) But we can be thankful that these glimpses of a legendary film remain, and if one regards them as fascinating fragments rather than a unified whole, they are of considerable interest. Regardless of the lack of continuity, much of Gance's old power comes through. The images are often striking and imaginative. The war scenes are sweeping and spectacular, the brief rape sequence a terrifying and dramatic episode with its use of exaggerated shadows, the occasional use of the moving camera and the hints of Griffith in the editing, continually interesting. And the famous episode of the war's dead returning to life to confront the living (a story sequence that Gance re-used, though in quite different context, in his talkie J'Accuse, which was not a remake, although similar in being a passionately pacifist film) is still a bizarre and gripping piece of film-making.\n\nWANDERING WILLIES (Pathe-Mack Sennett, 1926) Director: Del Lord\n\nWith Billy Bevan, Andy Clyde (in two roles), Kewpie Morgan, Ruth Taylor. Two reels.\n\nWandering Willies, like J'Accuse, is minus titles. But a titleless Sennett presents far fewer problems, Indeed, not a single title seems necessary, and their only function must have been to eliminate jump-outs\n\nand certain establishing scenes. It's sight-gag from beginning to end, starting with the delightful idea of dressing a duck in baby-clothes to make a cop think a baby is drowning, going through the oyster-stew gag that was later to see service with the 3 Stooges, Abbott & Costello and sundry other comics, and after the inevitable Interlude with a Sennett lion, winds up with a grand slapstick chase. 1926 was the last really good year for Sennett; thereafter his two-reelers slowed down and went in more and more for marital misadventures and situation (rather than sight) stories.\n\n- INTERMISSION -\n\nTHE SCARLET EMPRESS (Paramount, 1934) Directed by Josef von Sternberg; screenplay by Manuel Komroff, based on a diary of Catherine the Great; Art direction by Hans Drier: assisted by Peter Ballbusch and Richard Kollorsz; titles and effects by Gordon Jennings; costumes by Travis Banton; musical score, based on Tschaikowsky and Mendelssohn, arranged by John M. Leipold and W. Frank Hurling; photographed by Bert Glennon; 13 reels.\n\nWith: Marlene Dietrich, John Lodge, Sam Jaffe, Louise Dresser, Maria Sieber, C. Aubrey Smith, Ruthelma Stevens, Olive Tell, Gavin Gordon, Jameson Thomas, Hans von Twardowski, Davidson Clark, Erville Alderson, Marie Wells, Edward van Sloan, Jane Darwell, Harry Woods, Phillip Sleeman, John Davidson, Gerald Fielding, James Burke, Belle Stoddard Johnstone, Nadine Beresford, Eunice Moore, Petra McAllister, Blanche Rose, James Marcus, Thomas C. Blythe, Clyde David, Dick Alexander, Hal Boyer, Bruce Warren, George Davis, Eric Alden, Agnes Steele, Barbara Sabichi, May Foster, Minnie Steele, Katherine Sabichi, Julianne Johnson, Elinor Faire, Dina Smirnova, Anna Duncan, Patricia Patrick, Elaine St. Maur, Leo White, Akim Tamiroff, Warner Richmond.\n\nThe sixth of the seven Sternberg-Dietrich films, The Scarlet Empress is tha most eye-popping of them all, and the best - or weakest - of them all, depending on how one regards Sternberg. If one regards his pictorialism and elegance as the be-all and end-all of his films (never strong in a story sense at the best of times) then The Scarlet Empress is not only one of his best films, but also one of the landmarks of cinema. Historically, this interpretation of Catherine the Great is open to question; dramatically it is sometimes such a shambles that Sternberg has to resort to titles to bring you up to date on what is going on in terms of time and place, before he launches into some new hallucinatory effect. But who cares? Visual treats like this are such a rarity -- even in those days -- that one not only marvel a at it for what it has to offer, but also wonders how in blazes Sternberg ever got away with it. How could he have ever justified expenditure like this with the script that (presumably) Zukor and the front-office had read? Not that the extravagance doesn't pay off -- and a careful study of the sets reveals short cuts and economies that the overall gloss and elegance conceals. But those sets! Those wonderful (if totally unnecessary) trucking shots over banquet tables! The decor! The marvellous gauze shots, and stunning closeups of Dietrich. One really shouldn't write about such an essentially visual film (although Curtis Harrington's evaluation in the BFI's Von Sternberg index is a first-rate analysis); rather one should just sit back and stare open-mouthed at it all.\n\nRather like a joyous and totally undisciplined collaboration between Welles, Bunuel, Stroheim and Sternberg - with Gregory LaCava and W.C. Fields dashing in for odd scenes - it's a completely wild and unpredictable film, and the wonder is that the players get any kind of a shuffle at all. The \"old guard\" represented by C. Aubrey Smith is kept well under control, Dietrich looks stunning, and gives one of her best performances -- one feels that despite Pola Negri, Tallulah Bankhead, Bergner, Bette Davis, Louise Dresser and Mae West (!) - her Catherine probably comes the closest to reality. (Her own daughter, now an established actress as Maria Riva, plays Catherine as a child). That excellent actor John Lodge is, as always, first-rate -- whether as Count Alexei here, or as Bulldog Drummond, or in \"Koenigsmark\", he always makes one wish he had stayed before the cameras and not wandered off into politics. Sam Jaffe, in his first movie role, was somewhat justifiably criticised as being too much like Harpo Marx -- but then the mad Duke Peter probably was more like Harpo Marx than he was like Douglas Fairbanks jr (who played Peter in the Ozinner-Bergner version). The supporting cast is a veritable who's-who of old favorites. But it is the wonderful madness of it all, the gargoyles, the giant doors, the stylish decor which imagines and suggests Russian architecture instead of recreating it, that are the real stars and players of this astonishing work.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Wm.

So far however, these titles, though promised, haven't arrived, and rather than risk a last- minute switch we have finally set the program for next Tuesday as under:\n\nPETER IBBETSON (1935, with Gary Cooper, Ann Harding) - Henry Hathaway's lovely, poignant, mystical fantasy from the DuMaurier novel; regarded as a classic in Europe; overlooked in the country.\n\nTHE GREEN GODDESS (1929) - one of the best, and certainly the most enjoyable, of all the George Arliss vehicles. He has a field-day in this brilliantly written and witty old melodrama; with Alice Joyce, H.B. Warner, Ralph Forbes. stock shots from the '23 version, and sets from Curtiz' Noah's Ark.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nTHE BIRTH OF A NATION -- shot-sheet by Theodore Huff.\n\nThanks to the energy and initiative of Mrs Eileen Bowser, to whom we all automatically owe a debt of gratitude, the Museum of Modern Art has issued in very handsome form a completely detailed shot-sheet (tantamount to an overelaborate script) of this Griffith masterpiece. As compiled by Theodore Huff in 1939, it contains details of shots now missing from existing prints, and is an invaluable piece of study material, Only 100 copies were printed; available to members of the Museum at $2.06., and non-members at $2.75 and worth a good deal more. All enquiries to the film library of the Museum.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -"
