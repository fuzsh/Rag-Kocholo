The redoubtable Mrs. Henderson is the sort of character that Dench was born to play: funny, eccentric, cranky and with a spine of all-too-visible steel.

Detroit NewsTom Long

It's a variety show of a film with something for everyone if nothing of great consequence.

Denver PostMichael Booth

The greatest pleasure of Mrs. Henderson Presents is watching two of the grandest British lions taking their talents for a long walk.

Houston ChronicleBruce Westbrook

Though nudity will keep this from being a family film, for those who love the family of the theater, this postcard from its past is worth framing in your heart.

Boston GlobeTy Burr

Frears gives us a sweet, old-fashioned study of time and place and one unsinkable woman.

Chicago Sun-TimesRoger Ebert

Mrs. Henderson Presents is not great cinema, and neither was the Windmill great theater, but they both put on a good show.

Philadelphia InquirerCarrie Rickey

Me, I prefer my candy bittersweet. But purring Dench and sparring Hoskins are agreeable company.

Minneapolis Star TribuneJeff Strickler

Dench's Oscar-worthy performance is a delight. She turns Mrs. Henderson into a cross between the stereotypical little old lady and a hurricane. As Guest's character discovers, you've got to love her even as she's steamrolling you.

Atlanta Journal-ConstitutionEleanor Ringel Cater

It's an amusing and well-meaning celebration of the stiff-upper-lips that got Britain through the Blitz. And the lead acting couldn't be more nimble.

Austin ChronicleMarjorie Baumgarten

Dench deserves better, and unfortunately it will probably be a long time before she gets another starring role in a movie custom-made for an actress her age.

ObserverAndrew Sarris

A sloppy vaudeville turn by those glorious troupers Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins in what amounts to a silly orgy of nostalgic patriotism and the titillating naughtiness of stationary nudity.
