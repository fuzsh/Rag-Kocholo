Mrs. Henderson Presents (2005) Movie Drinking Game

Take a Drink: every time women appear nude and/or topless

Drink a Shot: for every graphic shot of female “you-know-whats”

And Cheers: to Judi Dench for starring in what is perhaps her sexiest motion picture!

By: Alex Phuong (Two Beers) –

Sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction.

During World War II, one of the most scandalous shows ever performed occurred… and featured totally nude women! Nevertheless, this strange moment in world history formed the basis of a modern dramedy featuring the one and only Judi Dench.

A Toast!

First of all, Judi Dench is superb in the leading role. Her performance is very honest, and the film is very revealing (pun intended). Sandy Powell also designed fabulous costumes that the women wore when they did not bare it all. It is no surprise that Powell would dress (or undress) Judi Dench since they had both previously won Academy Awards for Shakespeare in Love (1998).

Beer Two

Of course, this film could be deemed pornographic given its subject matter. It might even make fans of Fifty Shades of Grey blush!

Verdict

Enjoy what Mrs. Henderson has to present to the world to help assuage the pain and suffering that happened during World War II!
