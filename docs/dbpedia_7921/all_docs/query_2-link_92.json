        "text": "This new entry in the British sub-genre of “nude inspirational” films has recent widow Laura Henderson (Judi Dench, MRS. BROWN) buying an old, rundown theater and eventually putting on a nude revue.\n\nIt is just prior to WWII reaching England and Mrs. Henderson is bored with widowhood, so she hires impresario Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins, MERMAIDS) to run her Windmill Theater, putting on at first a successful musical revue. However, once the other theaters in town begin copying their style, the Windmill begins to lose money. This spurs Mrs. Henderson to suggest live nudes, which Van Damm wonders whether Lord Cromer (Christopher Guest, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN) will allow.\n\nSo Mrs. Henderson persuades old family friend Cromer to okay the nude revue with the stipulation that the women not move. So with government approval, Van Damm sets out to discover his beauties, literally running over star Maureen (Kelly Reilly, PRIDE & PREJUDICE). However, the bombing of the Germans and a row between Mrs. Henderson and Mr. Van Damm over his previously unknown wife threaten the survival of the theater, despite boasting that it would never close.\n\nDirector Stephen Frears (HIGH FIDELITY) props up the frothy tale with the combative repartee between Dench and Hoskins. There is more to Mrs. Henderson’s desire for a nude revue than sheer cheekiness, which brings some poignancy to the story. Additionally, she is trying in her own way to lift the morale of London with continuing business as usual no matter what the Nazis throw at them.\n\nDame Judi Dench could earn an Oscar nomination playing a comatose woman for an entire film, so her Oscar nod here is expected and deserved. However, Hoskins is equally as good, but his role lacked the flare that baits the Academy come award time. It’s a shame that he has only one Oscar nomination under his belt for MONA LISA, which was his breakout performance in the early ‘80s. The only major complaint I had was with some of awful visual effects work done on rooftop shots during the Nazi bombings. What this uplifting tale of persistence ultimately achieves is witty, fun entertainment."
