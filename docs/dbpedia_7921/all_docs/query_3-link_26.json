For those participating in the Screen Pass beta, they will be able to send a Screen Pass-eligible movie to others who did not purchase it for co-viewing, at no additional cost.\n\nTotal digital purchases from Movies Anywhere for April and May were up 65% compared to last year, the company said, but the increase for specific genres was even more notable.\n\n\"We are seeing the largest spikes around family animation and sports, as well as escapist movies such as horror and thrillers,\" said Karin Gilford, the Movies Anywhere general manager.\n\nMovies Anywhere said that family films were still the top genre for the service, but other genres saw significant spikes.\n\n\"Contagion,\" a 2011 movie about a deadly pandemic, saw a surge in popularity during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, which was clear for Movies Anywhere, too. It was the top movie for the thriller and disaster genres, which were up 149% and 143%, respectively, in year-over-year sales in May.\n\nSports movies saw a dramatic increase in sales of 339% in May compared to last year, suggesting audiences were starving for that content while real-life sports took a hiatus.\n\nMovies Anywhere also saw spikes in the amount of time users spent watching on certain devices in April, year-over-year:\n\nAndroid TV — up 57%\n\nApple TVOS — up 30%\n\nAmazon Fire TV — up 27%\n\nRoku — up 27%"
