        "text": "One day Timothée Chalamet had small-ish roles in projects like Homeland and Interstellar, and the next, he was the Oscar-nominated up-and-comer that seemingly every director wanted to work with, thanks to his emotional turn as Elio in Call Me by Your Name.\n\nHis role in Luca Guadagnino’s 2018 coming-of-age drama that also starred Armie Hammer made Chalamet the youngest person in 80 years — he was 22 at the time — to be nominated for best actor at the Academy Awards. At the time, The Hollywood Reporter senior reviews editor Jon Frosch wrote that Chalamet gave “the performance of the year” in the film.\n\nFollowing Call Me by Your Name, Chalamet began landing roles in higher-profile projects like Oscar nominees Lady Bird and Little Women, as well as Wes Anderson’s 2021 film The French Dispatch. It wasn’t long before the actor scored his arguably biggest role as Paul Atreides in Denis Villeneuve’s Dune — a part he reprises in the film’s upcoming sequel, Dune: Part Two.\n\nThat same year, Chalamet also starred in Netflix’s climate change title, Don’t Look Up, in which he acted alongside a star-studded group that included Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett, Mark Rylance and Jonah Hill.\n\nChalamet and Guadagnino reunited for another coming-of-age film: 2022’s Bones and All. The director’s tender cannibal love story follows Chalamet and Taylor Russell as they road-trip across the country together.\n\nLast year was set to be massive for the actor — not only did he have the buzzy sequel for Dune but also Wonka, Warner Bros.’ prequel of the beloved chocolatier. However, due to the actors strike, Dune: Part Two was pushed to 2024 so that its star-studded cast — which also features Zendaya, Florence Pugh and Austin Butler — would be able to embark on the film’s press tour. And that they have.\n\nBelow, THR rounds up some of Chalamet’s most popular films and one of his highly anticipated ones."
