Hiring feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm (Ian Bartholomew) to look after the newly renovated Windmill Theatre, the improbable duo present a bill of non-stop variety acts. But as war looms something more is required to boost morale and box office… When Mrs Henderson comes up with the idea of The Windmill Girls – glamorous young women posing as nude statues – audiences flock. And as the Blitz hits London, The Windmill provides a refuge for all, boasting the spirit-raising slogan “We Never Close”.\n\nAbout\n\nBased on the much-loved film that starred Dame Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins, Mrs Henderson Presents is the hilarious new musical with lyrics by Don Black, music by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain and book by Terry Johnson.
