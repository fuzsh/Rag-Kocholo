        "text": "This journey back to Soho's Windmill Theatre in the Thirties has plenty of heart, but its art is somewhat lacking\n\nSix times a day, six days a week. The nude revues (the “Revudeville”) that eccentric proprietor Mrs Laura Henderson and her Dutch manager Vivian Van Damm introduced to the Windmill Theatre in Soho in the Thirties didn’t just transform the venue’s fortunes. They helped change British society, rolling back Victorian prudishness – albeit by means of demure statuesque poses (the maximum “exposure” allowed). When the war came, the place made history by refusing to close, keeping “our boys” entertained and the nation’s pluck up at the height of the Blitz.\n\nThis remarkable story of hedonism and heroism was ably told in a charming, modestly successful 2005 Britflick starring Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins. Now a musical version of the tale has made it into the West End, following a well-received try-out in Bath last summer. Just a short stroll from Great Windmill Street (home now to a strip-club and lap-dancing joint), Mrs H’s shapely lovelies have in effect been reincarnated on the London stage for the very first time.\n\nThe full-frontal display of female flesh on view at the Noël Coward makes the show, ahem, an undeniable hot ticket. The playwright Terry Johnson, who has written the book and directs, is the man who gave us a disrobing Kathleen Turner in The Graduate – but this is a veritable breast bonanza by comparison. Titillating, perhaps – but empowering? There’s bound to be a debate on that, but Johnson and co reportedly claim so.\n\nAlthough it may sound disingenuous, there’s something touching about the recaptured innocence of it all, the celebration of the female form in a mock-classical style with no sniggers attached. And when a carefully arranged phalanx of unclad Windmill girls join forces to stick two fingers up at Adolf Hitler during the rousing, climactic first half number, you get a stirring sense that their Boudiccan spirit did indeed help win the war.\n\nIn short, the show’s heart is in the right place. Its art, however, is somewhat lacking. I kept thinking: where’s the dramatic meat? The Lord Chamberlain, with whom Mrs Henderson has to do battle, gets a Gilbert and Sullivan-esque number making the wry case for censorship, but that’s hardly a conflict to write home about. None of the male clientele gets a look-in – a missed opportunity. Composers George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain (with serviceable lyrics from Don Black) luxuriate in pastiche period sounds, but they’re groping for tangible emotions amid much generalised patriotic sentimentality.\n\nThe evening is bolstered by the patter of a cockney emcee (Jamie Foreman’s Arthur), who provides welcome respite from the diligent musical onslaught. This feels like a semi-triumphant evocation of a bygone demi-monde: there’s something missing, and it’s not the clothes.\n\nMrs Henderson Presents is at the Noël Coward Theatre, London until June 18.
