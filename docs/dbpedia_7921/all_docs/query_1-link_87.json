        "text": "Mrs Henderson Presents is a 2005 film based upon the story of the Windmill Theatre in London. The film chronicles the fiesty relationship between theatre owner, Laura Henderson and the director she appoints, autocratic Vivian Van Damm during the period of The Blitz in London.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears. Written by Martin Sherman, Kathy Rose and David Rose.\n\nThe show must go on, but the clothes must come off. taglines\n\nLaura Henderson\n\n[edit]\n\n(After seeing him naked) Why Mr Van Damm, you are Jewish!\n\nYou men certainly do get yourselves into such a state over the \"midlands\"!\n\nMy husband put me on top of the cupboard once. You have so much in common.\n\nAre you American? Strange people, lovely manners.\n\nAnd if we cause too many people to congregate in the street, who gives a fiddler's fuck?\n\nBut I've told all my friends, that I'm helping to build a home for future bastards!\n\nYou needn't worry. Our lighting will be so subtle, the disputed area [the female genitalia] will be barely visible. And anyway, we'll have a barber!\n\nTomorrow, we have auditions! Isn't that exciting? People come in to entertain us, and we say either stick around or buzz off!\n\nMy dear, you must never interrupt a perfectly good argument!\n\nShowbusiness is full of Jewish people. One must make do!\n\nAs you know, these are difficult times. So many of our delightful variety performers have been forced onto the milkline.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJudi Dench - Laura Henderson\n\nBob Hoskins - Vivian Van Damm\n\nWill Young - Bertie\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\n\"The show must go on, but the clothes must come off.\"\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nMrs Henderson Presents quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nMrs Henderson Presents at Rotten Tomatoes"
