        "text": "The bar chart illustrates the ratio of filmâ€™s genres that are most chosen by male and female and the pie chart describes the proportion of these genres contributing to the total ticket sales in the USA during 2010. Overall, action movies are the most famous genre among all movie categories while science fictions drew the least attention from both men and women. It is also clear that action movies accounted for the highest percentage in all film categories.\n\nAccording to the bar graph, action, thriller and science fiction were far more popular with male than females. The percentage of men almost doubled those of females in terms of action movies, with 40 versus 25 and 10 as opposed to 5. Moreover, comedy and western had the same patterns, with one-fifth and one-tenth percent respectively. With regard to thriller movies, people paid more attention for this kind of movie at 15%, which was considerably higher than that of women, at one-tenth. By contrast, the proportion of females being interested in romantic comedy outnumbered those of male, at 30 and 5 respectively.\n\nMoving to the pie chart, action movies got the highest percentage of ticket sales in all categories, nearly half of the pie chart, doubling the percentage of comedy movies, at only 24. It is also interesting to note that the proportion of thriller and other type of movie combined was merely 15%, which was slightly higher than that of romantic comedy, at 15%."
