        "text": "With some money in her pocket after the death of her husband, Mrs. Laura Henderson (Dame Judi Dench) buys a theater and hires the irascible theater manager Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run the business, despite bad blood between the two. Henderson has a hit on her hands when she decides to add beautiful nude women to the stage shows at her Windmill Theatre. Though they are touched by tragedy, Henderson and her company bravely keep the theater active during the 1940-’41 Blitz of London.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons, My Beautiful Launderette), it received 2 Oscar nominations (Dench, and Sandy Powell’s costumes), features plenty of bickering-banter between the two lovable leads, and a rather decent amount of tasteful nudity for an early 2000’s crowd-pleaser."
