        "text": "Whether you’re thinking about learning how to shoot film photography or you’re interested in how to make your digital images look like film, one of the first steps is knowing about the different types of camera film and which one has the look you’re going for.\n\nThere are plenty of amazing film brands out there, and each has different film stocks to choose from. Different types of camera film will create different looking images, thanks to variances in color tones, contrast, saturation, grain, and so on.\n\nIn this blog, we’re listing some popular types of camera film and showing you some examples of what they look like to help you decide.\n\nMany of the images in this blog are actually digital images that were edited with presets that emulate that film very accurately, so you can learn how to get the film look on your digital images, too!\n\nPS: Before purchasing real camera films, make sure they come in the right format for your camera, whether it requires 35mm film, medium format film, or something else.\n\nTypes of Camera Film: Color Negative Films\n\nAlso known as color print film, color negative film is the most common type of camera film. It’s typically the most affordable and easy to develop.\n\nHere are some popular types of color negative film brands and stocks to check out!\n\nKodak Films\n\nKodak Portra\n\nThere are a few different versions of Kodak Portra film, including:\n\nKodak Portra 160\n\nKodak Portra 400\n\nKodak Portra 800\n\nPhotographer: Eric Rudd | Preset: Portra 400\n\nKodak Portra is known for its true-to-life colors, great skin tones, and low grain. This film look is lovely on natural-light portraits (hence the name) and a popular film choice for photographers in the wedding, family, lifestyle, fashion, and boudoir genres.\n\nKodak Portra film stocks are super versatile and perfect for a warm and neutral look on your photographs.\n\nAnother reason why Portra films are popular is because they can be easily pushed. When you push color negative film, it increases the contrast and grain, creating a more “dark and moody” image.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Portra presets here, and Portra Pushed film presets here.\n\nKodak Gold 200\n\nKodak Gold 200 is another popular type of camera film that offers a more bright and vivid film look.\n\nPhotographer: Nicole Anderson | Preset: Gold 200\n\nAs the name implies, Gold 200 is a golden-toned film with medium contrast and saturation, offering rich colors while still being very versatile. It’s known for being nostalgic and affordable—a great film look for travel, landscape, and candid photos.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Gold 200 preset here.\n\nKodak Ektar 100\n\nKodak Ektar 100 takes the bright and vivid film look up a notch!\n\nPhotographer: Eric Sowers | Preset: Ektar 100\n\nEktar 100 is a bold film look with high saturation and contrast. It’s bright and colorful with fine grain and saturated reds. If you want your images to really pop, give this one a try!\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Ektar 100 preset here. Along with Gold 200, this is by far one of the most popular presets we see used by the Mastin Labs Community!\n\nFujifilm Films\n\nFujicolor Pro 400H\n\nIf you’re interested in a light and airy film look, Fujicolor Pro 400H is where it’s at!\n\nPhotographer: Michal Ben Abir | Preset: Fuji 400H\n\nFujicolor 400H is known for its natural skin tones, pastel tones, cyan greens, and low saturation. It’s an especially popular type of camera film amongst wedding photographers and family photographers.\n\nLike Portra, Fujicolor films can also be pushed to create a punchier look with higher contrast and grain.\n\nPreset: Fuji Pushed Pack\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Fujicolor 400H preset here, and Fujicolor Pushed presets here.\n\nFujicolor Superia 400\n\nFujifilm Superia 400 is a versatile film that is a great option for everyday photography.\n\nPhotographer: Heather Broom Holdiness | Preset: Superia 400\n\nSuperia 400 offers a bold and balanced film look with deeper reds and neutral shadows. Perfect for a bit of pop without going over the top! Some people consider Superia 400 to be “Ektar light,” with similarities in the vividness but a bit less saturation and contrast. It works well for natural and low-light photography.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Superia 400 preset here,\n\nFujicolor Natura 1600\n\nFujicolor Natura 1600 is a discontinued film, sadly. But we’re still mentioning it on this list because it’s a classic film look and can still be emulated with the help of film presets.\n\nPhotographer: Daryl Love | Preset: Natura 1600\n\nNatura 1600 is a versatile film that is great for low light photography with warm skin tones and medium contrast. It’s also a great film look for off-camera flash and studio photography.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Natura 1600 preset here,\n\nCinestill Films\n\nCinestill 800T\n\nCinestill 800T is one of those cult classic types of camera film, especially when it comes to night film photography.\n\nPhotographer: Lindsey Topham | Preset: Cinestill 800T\n\nCinestill 800T emulates a cinema-esque look on still photographs. It is tungsten-balanced (that’s what the “T” stands for) making it excellent for capturing neon lights and halation. This type of camera film is also known for its vibrant reds, edgy blue greens, and pink glow around lights.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Cinestill 800T preset here,\n\nTypes of Camera Film: Slide Film\n\nSlide film works a bit differently than color negative film.\n\nAlso known as color reversal film or color positive film, slide film is a bit less common because it is typically less accessible, more expensive, and harder to develop. Regardless, slide film is revered for its beautifully vivid colors, fine grain, and a true vintage feel.\n\nHere are a few popular types of slide film.\n\nKodak Slide Film\n\nKodak Ektachrome E100\n\nKodak Ektachrome E100 gives us all the nostalgic feels with rich, warm color tones and soft highlights.\n\nPreset: Ektachrome 100\n\nEktachrome E100 is perfect if you’re going for a vintage look with fine grain, especially in daylight. It’s a popular film look for portraits, lifestyle, and fashion photography.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Ektachrome 100 preset here,\n\nFujifilm Slide Film\n\nFujichrome Velvia 50\n\nFujifilm’s Fujichrome Velvia 50 is a slide film with vivid colors, fine grain, and deep shadows.\n\nPreset: Velvia 50\n\nVelvia 50 brings out vibrant reds and muted blue-green tones, perfect for images with a pop of bright color. Velvia 50 is popular for travel, landscape, and lifestyle photography.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Velvia 50 preset here,\n\nFujichrome Provia 100F\n\nFujifilm’s Fujichrome Provia 100F is still quite vivid, but has a softer look than Velvia 50 with medium contrast and saturation.\n\nPreset: Provia 100\n\nProvia 100F’s magenta tones offer a stylish edginess, making this film especially popular for fashion photography, studio photography, and lifestyle photography.\n\nSee more examples and learn more about our Provia 100 preset here,\n\nTypes of Camera Film: Black and White Photography Films\n\nWe couldn’t finish this list without talking about black and white camera films!\n\nBlack and white film photography is an amazing way to create timeless photos. Removing the element of color creates space for storytelling and emotion.\n\nHere are some types of black and white camera film to try.\n\nIlford Black and White Films\n\nIlford Pan F Plus\n\nYou can’t talk about black and white film without mentioning Ilford. Ilford considers themselves “the home of black and white film photography,” and with good reason!\n\nPreset: Pan F\n\nOne popular black and white film by Ilford is Pan F Plus.
