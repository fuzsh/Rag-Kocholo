        "text": "The show is a theatre spectacle, set in London in 1937 and telling the story of the Windmill Theatre.\n\nBased on the 2005 movie starring Dame Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins, it features owner Mrs Henderson’s idea of introducing nudity to the stage, in bid to boost troops’ morale - and box office.\n\n“It’s so great to be part of an original show,” says Matthew, who plays stage worker Eddie. “And the cast are fantastic to work with.”\n\nTrace Bennett, who once starred in Coronation Street plays Mrs Henderson and Ian Bartholomew plays Vivian Van Damm, the theatre manager.\n\n“They are fantastic. And I am completely in awe of Ian. He gives a master class in acting every night, and always seems so relaxed.”\n\nMatthew points out the show is on its way to becoming a west end hit because it’s getting great word of mouth.\n\n“The film was a nice little movie but most people haven’t heard of it.”\n\nIt’s certainly not a familiar transfer to film, as was the case with producer John Reid’s major west end success, The Graduate.\n\n“There are also some who come a little concerned about the nudity,” says Matthew.\n\n“They assume it’s going to be some sort of sex show. But it’s not gratuitous at all, it’s done very tastefully.”\n\nHe adds; “One reviewer of the show passed judgement when she pointed out that a west end musical in 2016 features girls getting their clothes off, but she was missing the point.\n\n“This is a historical piece. It reveals exactly what happened. And we should be celebrating what these women did in 1940, for the troops and for morale.\n\nThe Windmill Theatre became famous for its nudity, however the censor’s insisted the girls could be naked, provided they didn’t move.\n\nIn the Forties, the girls would have felt vulnerable. That vulnerability is captured perfectly in this production, contrasting it with modern-day sensibilities.\n\n“Women were only beginning to work, never mind appear naked on stage.”\n\nMatthew was amazed he had landed the role.\n\n“I did the first audition and it went ok, but then went off to work on Singing In The Rain in Japan. If you can’t make second auditions you rarely land a part. But I got it, and was delighted to realise it was far bigger than I had imagined.”\n\nHowever, director Terry Johnson made an early impact during rehearsals.\n\n“I come from a musical theatre background, where performers are desperate for people to like them and so you go on smiling,” says Matthew, grinning.\n\n“Terry said to me; ‘No smiling. You don’t have to smile for people to like you’.\n\n“Then he told me to stop acting, to stop thinking and just say the words. I think what he meant was keep it real, don’t try too hard.\n\n“And it worked. My character is a nice, straightforward guy who works in a theatre, then decides he should off and do his bit for the war effort.”\n\nMatthew’s performance career began aged eight when he danced with the Ian McLeod Theatre School in Helensburgh.\n\n“At the time I was caught up with Michael Jackson’s Moonwalk. I begged my mum for months to take me to dancing school.\n\n“Then Ian said I should make a career in dance, that I should study ballet and tap. But I didn’t fancy that at all. I just wanted to do the Moonwalk.”\n\nMatthew went on to attend the Dance School of Scotland and did study ballet and tap.\n\n“I found myself sulking and crying through ballet. I remember I missed one Monday night ballet class to play for the school football team and I got a really big talking to.\n\n“But in the process I learned about dedication, about sacrifice. And that’s what you need in theatre.”\n\nHe adds, with a shrug; “The amount of family weddings and events I’ve had to miss because of my job.”\n\nMatthew knew he wanted a career in musical theatre after seeing Cats and Barnum and after graduation worked his way through a series of ensemble roles in shows such as Matilda and Chicago.\n\nBut he’s gone on to star in the likes of Edward Scissorhands.\n\n“This was one of the hardest jobs I’ve ever had, thanks to the costume, for I needed needed two dressers.\n\n“However, half the skill in this business is keeping employed. Being a a good all-rounder gives me options.”\n\nMatthew will marry his dancer fiancé this summer. At least his wedding dance should be a great spectacle?\n\n“You’d be amazed how many times I get asked that question. But no, it will be very understated. We wouldn’t want to disappoint.”\n\n*Mrs Henderson Presents, now running at the Noel Coward Theatre, London."
