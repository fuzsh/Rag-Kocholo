From the pie chart, action films accounted for nearly 50 percent of ticket sales, only five percent being other types not listed in the chart.\n\nIn detail, as regards action films, 40 percent of men said they like this, while only 25 percent of women supposed that they enjoyed action types. By contrast, six times as many women liking romantic comedies as men, at 30 percent and five percent respectively. The number of men and women who liked comedies and western films was equal, at 20 percent and ten percent. Fifteen percent of men were interested in the thriller, whereas only ten percent of women liked this. In science fiction films, the number of men who liked this type was twice higher than the number of women, at ten and five percent in turn.\n\nLooking at the pie chart, action films sold the most tickets, at 40 percent, making it significantly more common than comedies, at 24 percent. Romantic comedies came next, at 12 percent, while thriller was slightly less popular at ten percent. Bottom of the list was other types of films with only five percent of ticket sales.\n\nHolt Educational Consultant - / 15122 4849\n\nNov 12, 2021 #2\n\nEvery sentence should contain only one idea or 2 related ideas. When faced with 2 images of differing content / descriptive subjects, the writer should present each image and its related subject seperately. That means, the summary should have 2 seperate description sentences rather than just 1. Do this for clarity purposes. The sentence structure for the image insuction should not be used or repeated in the exam takers version. It is not to be used as a template in the test presentation.\n\nFor the trending statement, the implied measurements should be mentioned. Actual data measurements should be saved for the actual report. So, the presentation for the first image is right but, the second image is incorrect as it mentions actual data already.\n\nIn the actual report, the writer should use a uniform numerical data presentation. If you start with numbers then use that throughout. That would be ideal since it makes the report easier and faster to read. It is not recommended that you spell out the numbers for speed and writing accuracy.\n\nThe report is acceptable out can use some formatting changes. The clarity score will be helped if my suggestions are applied by the exam taker in future essays.."
