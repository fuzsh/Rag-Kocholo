        "text": "The highest grossing movies of the 90s was stuff like Jurassic Park and Titanic, so not really sure \"romcom\" fits there\n\nUnless you have a dark sense of humor regarding the Titanic\n\nNot necessarily the highest selling but there are lots of them for that decade.\n\nThe highest grossing movies of the 90s was stuff like Jurassic Park and Titanic, so not really sure \"romcom\" fits there\n\nUnless you have a dark sense of humor regarding the Titanic\n\nRomcoms we're definitely popular in the 90s, even if they didn't land at the very tip top of the box office.\n\nI'm not sure we could pinpoint singular genres, but I will say that there are definitely some threads and undercurrents evident within the trends of each decade. These are some that come to mind for me.\n\n70s: Crime/NeoNoir, Gangster\n\n80s: Pulp, low budget/high concept, evolution of the gangster\n\n90s: high school dramedy, blockbuster action (as has been mentioned this includes: disaster movies, \"classic\" action movies, etc), psychological thriller\n\nWhat you'll likely notice though, as some earlier comments suggest, is that each decade popularizes a set of interests which are then expanded upon in the years that follow.\n\nElder millennial reporting in. When I think of the 90s, 00s, and 10s, the closest thing I can think of that felt like a decade-spanning trend was kind of an offset one: the largely dreadful Apatow-gang comedies of the mid-00s to mid-10s. And a pre-edit for another mid-decade one: the weird run of classic TV adaptations from the mid 90s to mid 00s\n\nSo far the 20s definitely feel like they're going to be defined by jingling keys \"fandom movies made by fans\" fare, but there's still time to pull out of this nosedive\n\n1930s to 1950s was all westerns\n\nLol\n\nI wouldn't even say westerns were the most successful when you had Bogart doing noirs left and right, Hitchcock making crime films, musicals were everywhere, the whole of Universal making monster movies like Frankenstein and Dracula, Billy Wilder with his comedies - the golden age of Hollywood was everything including westerns.\n\nThe way it works is that one movie blows up big, and then there are several years of copy cats. Sometimes this fits within a decade, but often does not. For example, Halloween in 1978 kicked off the slasher horror genre which was mostly mid-to-early 1980s. When Harry Met Sally in 1989 kicked off a certain type of romcom with movies like Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, and so on in the 90s. Blair Witch in '99 kicked off a trend of found footage horror in the 2000s. American Pie in 1998 kicked off this kind of raunchy teen/college comedy run with movies like Old School, Euro Trip, Wet Hot American Summer, etc.\n\nI think it would be more useful to call out these movies and the trends they started, rather than looking at a particular decade and trying to define it.\n\nI think it would be more useful to call out these movies and the trends they started, rather than looking at a particular decade and trying to define it.\n\n👏\n\nThe Most Popular Movie Genres in Each Decade\n\nMovie tastes have changed significantly from decade to decade.
