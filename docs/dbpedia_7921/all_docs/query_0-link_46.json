        "text": "One of the occupational hazards of film criticism is that the reviewer risks forgetting the art of watching movies for its own sake, to see them in the manner the filmmakers intended audiences to see them. The critic is compelled to be analytical of every movie, rather than watch them as a consumer. But the greatest risk of being a critic is that over time, one forms a rigid set of criteria for what makes a film worthy of viewer’s patronage and a place in film history books. Occasionally, however, a film comes along that serves as a tonic for such a critic.\n\nStephen Frears’ “Mrs. Henderson Presents” tells the mostly-true story of a newly widowed British woman, Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) who in the late thirties purchases a theater and, together with manager Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins), runs a musical revue. Its gimmicks: Non-stop performances and nude ladies, albeit nude ladies required to remain perfectly still (so it can be explained to complainants that it’s only slightly different from paintings). The theater enjoys great success but then runs into trouble with the onset of World War II. Henderson and Van Damm must then convince the authorities to let them continue performances amid the country’s wartime mentality.\n\nI chastised Bill Paxton’s “The Greatest Game Ever Played” for lazily exploiting the Horatio Alger myth and not adding anything to it. “Greatest Game” was a highly simple affair, going through the motions of a stock story of people with a good heart but looked down upon by the dominant society. The downtrodden then manage to prove themselves worthy of respect and become paragons of human achievement. From a literal standpoint, the plot and tone of “Mrs. Henderson” is highly similar to that of “Greatest Game.”\n\nAnd that’s not the only problem with the film. “Mrs. Henderson Presents” sloppily tries to insert serious subject matter into its otherwise happy-go-lucky texture. The film addresses callous manipulation (a subplot involving one of the nude models and a young soldier is particularly nasty), wars, and casualties of said wars. It even mentions one of the few subjects that are still impervious to being made light of – the Holocaust. While historically accurate, such issues do not sit very well with the film’s cheery atmosphere. Whenever such topics are tackled, the viewer gets the feeling that the filmmakers attempted to shoehorn in the material in attempt to give the film some weight.\n\nOne of the main conflicts in the film is between Henderson and Van Damm. Van Damm constantly criticizes Henderson for not living in the real world, of assuming good intentions of everyone who has a kind face, of gaily assuming a worldview of eventual harmony. A film critic could easily accuse this film with the same charges. None of the deeper questions in the film, such as romanticism versus realism or the validity of good-natured trust, are resolved in the course of the movie. The film focuses on its main subject of the crimes of Puritanism upon sexual freedom, and only addresses other topics to use them as examples for the main argument.\n\nBut this film seemed to stand defiantly, daring me to attack it on such bases. It did this by causing me to question why a film should automatically be criticized because it brought up such topics and did not fully address them during the course of the movie. After all, is there a rule written somewhere that states that a film fails if does such a thing? Does the film not succeed in its goals? To answer that question, we must extrapolate from the film what its goals were in the first place. My best guess was that the filmmakers intended to produce a feel-good, humanizing film.\n\nAnd does it succeed? As a matter of fact, it succeeds exactly where “Greatest Game” failed. You know those stories about idealistic young misfits who try to put on a show for the locals? “Mrs. Henderson” feels like the product of such an effort. It has a soul that “Greatest Game” lacked and tried to compensate for with overwrought cinematography and music. It’s like watching Gene Kelly tap-dance: One would be hard-pressed to find someone so world-weary and cynical they fail to enjoy the spectacle.\n\nThank goodness for Dame Judi Dench, who demonstrates that upper-class elderly British ladies using four-letter words will always be funny, and no film snob has the right to make anyone feel guilty for laughing. And thank goodness for this film as a whole, for serving as a reminder for film critics not to take movies, particularly ones of these sorts, too seriously."
