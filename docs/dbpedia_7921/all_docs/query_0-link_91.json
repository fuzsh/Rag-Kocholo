        "text": "The film: British director Stephen Frears steers away from the sort of gritty films (Prick Up Your Ears, My Beautiful Laundrette) that made his name in this charming war-time tale. That's not to say the film lacks dark moments, but for the most part Mrs Henderson Presents is a glorious romp that celebrates life and the human spirit.\n\nAt its centre is a brilliant performance from stage and screen veteran Judi Dench that deservedly won her an academy award nomination this year. She has never been better suited to, or more in command of, a role.\n\nDench plays a version of the real-life Mrs Henderson, widowed between the wars in London and looking for a way to see out her years. She stumbles across a closed theatre and decides to breathe life back into it, with the help of impresario Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins, right with Dench), a man as dour as she is ditzy. The pair come up with an inspired idea: to have their dancing girls go naked. It's a huge success, of course, and as the second world war breaks out, it becomes an escape from the Blitz.\n\nWhat Frears establishes so well is the pair's relationship, the rise and rise of the theatre, and the drama that unfolds both front-of-house and backstage. The central pair play off each other with aplomb. Dench at her feisty best manages to somehow come across as the sexiest thing on show, in spite of her age and all the young flesh that's on display around her.\n\nThe sets, show tunes and choreography capture the mood of the era and the film is a high-stepping dancehall luvvies' dream. When things get soppy and sentimental you're so swept up in the moment that you won't question the obviousness of it all.\n\nBritain's Pop Idol winner Will (call me William) Young is a real find as the hoofer who comes on board to help get the show rolling, while Christopher Guest takes himself as far away from This is Spinal Tap as he's ever likely to get, playing a stuffy lord who tries to close the show down.\n\nThe extras: The making-of documentary is a delight, as the cast and crew gather in one section with the revue's original dancers to relive the glory days. The women come across as full of spirit as they were 60-odd years ago. You also get to see what a pro Dench is, helping everyone on set to lift their game. Frears gives an insightful commentary that adds to the history of the Henderson tale. Sadly, this first version to arrive in Hong Kong has no Chinese subtitles.\n\nThe verdict: Almost impossible not to fall for its ample charms."
