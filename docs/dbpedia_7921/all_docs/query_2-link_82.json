        "text": "Dame Judi Dench is poised to win a fifth Oscar nomination for her tour-de-force theatrics in Mrs Henderson Presents, a lively true story of wartime heroism and daring.\n\nShe attacks the lead role with gusto in Stephen Frears' energetic and nostalgic film which could win similar plaudits for its immaculate production design and Martin Sherman's delicious screenplay, arguably his finest work since Bent.\n\nAnd in a sly piece of casting, the film provides Will Young with his big screen acting debut, essaying a song and dance man not too far removed from the Pop Idol himself.\n\nThe film has a great deal of heart and soul too, paying tribute to the young men and women whose courage and daring kept the home fires burning across Britain as Hitler's bombs decimated the key cities.\n\nThe film opens with a funeral. Socialite Laura Henderson (Dench) bids farewell to her beloved husband Robert and faces up to the terrifying prospect of widowhood.\n\nHer best friend, Lady Conway, (Thelma Barlow), suggests she finds herself a hobby - embroidery or some such frippery - or, failing that, a young lover. But on an afternoon drive around Soho, Laura formulates her own action-plan.\n\nShe purchases the derelict Windmill Theatre and sets about renovating the property so the auditorium can play host to a vaudeville revue, to which Robert was partial.\n\nLaura hires Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) as her artistic director. He quickly secures the services of singer Bertie (Will Young) and a troupe of dancing girls to headline the capital's first non-stop musical show: Revudeville.\n\nThe money pours in until rival theatres copy the Windmill's revolutionary idea.\n\nThen Laura hits upon a tantalising solution: \"Why don't we get rid of the clothes. Naked girls ... what do you think?\"\n\nDench and Hoskins are a brilliant double act and many of the laughs arise from Laura and Vivian's constant bickering.\n\nA running joke about Vivian's supposed Jewish heritage leads to the best one-liner in the entire film, shortly after Hoskins sheds his clothing.\n\nYoung impresses, showcasing his silky vocal skills in the various musical numbers, while Barlow (better known as Mavis in Coronation Street) is a riot."
