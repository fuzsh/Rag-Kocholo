        "text": "Following a successful run at Theatre Royal Bath last summer, Mrs Henderson Presents has (sadly temporarily) found a new home at the Noel Coward Theatre in the heart of London’s Theatre Land. Seeing as an original musical is something of a rarity in the current world of theatre, it was a refreshingly enlightening experience to visit this gem of a show before it closes later this month.\n\nMrs Henderson Presents is based on the true story of the establishment of the Windmill Theatre, following the escapades of the various individuals involved in its journey. One of the most remarkable things about the experience of watching this show is the fact that it is performed in the city in which it is set over 70 years previously. This makes the references to World War Two and the Blitz even more poignant, and dramatically increases the realism of the piece – which contributes to its charm.\n\nThe plot’s action revolves around the lives of two women Laura Henderson (played by Tracie Bennett) and Maureen (Emma Williams). Bennett portrays Mrs Henderson perfectly, from her elderly stance and vocals to her knowledgeable and cultured demeanour. Her performance of Whatever Time I Have in act 1 is the first show stopping musical number, and her interactions with the other figures are often hilarious. Emma Williams’ Maureen is naïve and shy at first, she displays some impressive character development over the course of the show. The parallels between the two leading ladies are clever and thoughtful, such as the way that both their lives are affected by deaths in the war; and their unwavering motivations in life (as displayed in the stunning If Mountains Were Easy to Climb). Their relationship could have done with a little more stage time to properly develop a connection, but what is displayed is beautifully heart-warming.\n\nThe supporting cast do an excellent job, and this is made clear from the lively opening number Everybody Loves the Windmill. Ian Bartholomew is hilariously matter of fact as Mr Van Damm, and Matthew Malthouse is charming and believable as Eddie. Bartholomew’s performance of Living in a Dream World so beautiful and finishes the first act perfectly and poignantly. A couple of supporting performances aren’t quite as strong as these however: I’m not particularly keen on some of the comedian Arthur’s jokes (performed by Jamie Foreman), and the Lord Chamberlain sections seem a bit too satirical and over played at times. These do not detract from the overall show though, as these parts provide a certain degree of comic relief – they just occasionally seem to ruin the mood a little.\n\nThe nudity, which is inevitably a focal point of the story, is dealt with very tastefully and cleverly. The scene preceding it in which most of the characters nearly get their clothes off is one of the funniest moments in the show, and the dance with the feathers is well choreographed and spectacular. The song We’ll Never Close also features some very impressive choreography (but no nudity!) and exploits the undeniable talent of the ensemble members. Having sat in the second row with a perfect view into the band pit I have to mention the band (led by Barney Ashworth), who perform impeccably and deserve all the credit and praise they can get!\n\nMrs Henderson Presents is a brilliant example of a classic British musical. The way it is rooted in British heritage is great to see, and watching it in London (the city in which it is set) is so thought provoking and makes it totally realistic. The cast are absolutely incredible, especially Emma Williams and Tracie Bennett, and it is such a shame that this incredible show is closing so soon as it would have been amazing for even more audiences to get to experience this stunning show."
