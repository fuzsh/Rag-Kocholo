        "text": "There are just six weeks left to see the critically acclaimed, Olivier Award nominated musical MRS HENDERSON PRESENTS at the West End’s Noel Coward Theatre. The final performance of this strictly limited 18-week season will be on Saturday 18 June 2016.\n\nBased on the 2005 film of the same name MRS HENDERSON PRESENTS stars Tracie Bennett as ‘Mrs Henderson’ and Ian Bartholomew as ‘Vivian Van Damm’ (played by Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins respectively in the film); Emma Williams as ‘Maureen’; all recently nominated at the 2016 Olivier Awards, and Jamie Foreman as ‘Arthur’.\n\nIt’s London, 1937, and recently widowed eccentric, Laura Henderson, is looking for a way of spending her time and money when her attention falls on a run-down former cinema in Great Windmill Street. Hiring feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm to look after the newly renovated Windmill Theatre, the improbable duo present a bill of non-stop variety acts. But as war looms something more is required to boost morale and box office… When Mrs Henderson comes up with the idea of The Windmill Girls – glamorous young women posing as nude statues – audiences flock. And as the Blitz hits London, The Windmill provides a refuge for all, boasting the spirit-raising slogan “We Never Close”.\n\nBios\n\nTracie Bennett is a double Olivier Award-winner for her performances in the musicals She Loves Me and Hairspray.
