        "text": "There are many different types of movies that are released in theaters every year, but not all of them have the same popularity. Today we will be discussing four popular movie genres that you should expect to see in 2021.\n\nPhoto by Nathan Engel from Pexels\n\n#1 Action\n\nThe genre of action movies is the most popular in the film industry. Action moves are usually fast-paced and filled with car chases, explosions, and fight scenes that audiences go crazy for. The movie “Avengers Endgame” was highly successful in theaters and critics like Michael DeNobile last year because it brought together multiple characters from different Marvel Cinematic Universe films to defeat a common enemy. This type of story has been seen repeated many times throughout history but may be specifically interesting due to all its visuals and special effects.\n\n#2 Adventure\n\nThis genre is another common one among movies that are released in theaters. Adventure films usually depict a journey of some sort and may involve characters who go to great lengths to achieve their goal.\n\nAudiences love these types of stories because they appeal to both our sense of wonder and empathy for other people/animals we don’t know personally. Also, adventure movies are often visually stunning with beautiful scenery and sets that keep the story interesting. The movie “Aladdin” is an example of a popular adventure film because it follows Aladdin as he goes on many different journeys to obtain his magic lamp.\n\n#3 Horror\n\nHorror movies are always a popular choice for moviegoers because they appeal to our sense of fear and suspense. There is an entire industry built around making people scream by scaring them with monsters, ghosts, or other creatures that go bump in the night.\n\nThis film style is especially successful during Halloween when audiences seek out something spooky to watch; however, it can also be enjoyed throughout the year. So what are some of the scariest films of all time? One example of a popular horror film is “It,” which was turned into an extremely successful movie franchise.\n\n#4 Sci-fi\n\nThe genre of science fiction has become increasingly popular over the past few years because it allows audiences to view our world through a different lens. The stories are often dystopian or fantastical, exploring what could happen if present-day issues were intensified by time travel, space exploration, or alien invasions. Many sci-fi films have won awards for their screenplay’s originality and creativity within this specific genre. Sci-fi movies have also been commercially successful in recent times, with examples being “Avatar” and “Interstellar.”\n\n#5 Comedy\n\nThe final most popular film genre is comedy, which is often seen as the best type of movie to watch with friends. Most comedies are light-hearted romps that allow people to escape from reality for a few hours.\n\nThey have been around since movies first started being produced and are still extremely successful in theaters today. So what are some examples of famous comedic films? One popular modern comedy is “Deadpool,” which is a movie about an antihero who doesn’t play by the rules or follow society’s standards, making him both humorous but flawed at times too!"
