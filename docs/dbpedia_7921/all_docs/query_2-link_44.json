        "text": "One of the most common complaints from movie critics and movie-goers is that nothing new ever comes along. All that is being released in theaters these days, the claims go, are remakes of old films, updates of old TV shows and sequels geared to cash in on the financial success of the originals.\n\nWell, obviously those critics and movie-goers haven’t seen the delightful, fact-based and very funny “Mrs. Henderson Presents” (Genius Products, $28.95).\n\nThe marvelous Judi Dench garnered a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of the title character, a newly widowed upper-class woman who in 1937 buys a London theater, the Windmill, and hires a rather bombastic impresario, the wonderful Bob Hoskins, to run it. Its innovative always-open policy is an immediate hit, but when other theaters begin copying the policy, Mrs. Henderson comes up with a zinger of an idea: Continue with the musical shows but add nude women.\n\nDench is perfect as a woman who isn’t afraid to say what she thinks, even if it is off color. And Hoskins, also the film’s executive producer, is perfect as her foil. They get great support from Christopher Guest as a prudish British lord who’s the exact opposite of his “Spinal Tap” character, Nigel Tufnel; English pop singer Will Young as the show’s star; and Kelly Reilly as one of the girls in the show.\n\nThe DVD of “Mrs. Henderson Presents” has some great extras, including a 24-minute behind-the-scenes documentary that begins with a party reuniting some of the original Windmill girls. In addition, there are some nice production stills and an informative if somewhat sparse commentary track by veteran English director Stephen Frears.\n\n“Mrs. Henderson Presents” is also available in a full-frame version.\n\nJuorneyman\n\nWho would have thought that Monty Python member Michael Palin would end up turning out some of the most entertaining and informative travel documentaries to come along? If you like visiting off-the-wall places, you’ll definitely want to check out the nice two-disc edition of “Michael Palin: Sahara”(BBC, $34.98).\n\nPalin sets out to explore the world’s largest desert, which stretches across the top third of the African continent. What makes Palin such a good travel host is that he has a terrific, self-deprecating sense of humor and loves to meet people of different cultures.\n\nThe two-disc DVD of “Sahara” doesn’t have a lot of extras, but the ones it does have are super, including 16 deleted scenes, a video diary and an extensive interview with Palin.\n\nHostile environment\n\nTwo young Americans and a pal from Iceland backpacking across Europe get all the beautiful girls they want, but they also find pain, suffering and death in the grisly and gross “Hostel”(Sony, $28.95).\n\nThe violence in this unrated version of the film is some of the most horrific you’ll ever see (at one point an innocent young girl’s eye is gouged out and left hanging on her cheek). “Hostel” certainly isn’t for the faint of heart and it certainly isn’t what I would call “entertaining.”\n\nThe DVD does have plenty of extras, though, including four commentary tracks featuring director-writer Eli Roth, executive producer Quentin Tarantino, several of the film’s producers, the film’s editor and a couple of the no-name actors. There’s also a lengthy documentary on the making of the film and a multi-angle feature in which several young children trash a car.\n\nMy advice is to stay away from this one unless you’re into this kind of thing.\n\nAll releases are due in stores today."
