        "text": "Judi Dench (born December 9, 1934, York, North Yorkshire, England) is a British actress known for her numerous and varied stage roles and for her work in television and in a variety of films.\n\nDench studied at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art in London. In 1957 she gave her first important critically acclaimed performance, as Ophelia in the Old Vic production of Hamlet. The following year she made her Broadway debut in Twelfth Night. Her performance as Lady Macbeth in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Macbeth (1977) earned her a Laurence Olivier Award from the Society of West End Theatre Managers (now the Society of London Theatre). It was her first of eight Olivier Awards; she also won for Juno and the Paycock (1980), Pack of Lies (1983), Antony and Cleopatra (1987), Absolute Hell (1996), A Little Night Music (1996), and The Winter’s Tale (2016), and in 2004 she received a special Olivier Award.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nFrom the beginning of her career, Dench frequently acted on television, in adaptations of plays as well as in series. Among her notable credits were two romantic comedy series that aired on the BBC: A Fine Romance (1981–84), which she starred in with her husband, Michael Williams, whom she had married in 1971 and who died in 2001; and As Time Goes By (1992–2005). She later starred in the BBC miniseries Cranford (2007–09), based on works by Elizabeth Gaskell.\n\nAfter making her big-screen debut in the crime drama The Third Secret (1964), Dench acted in such films as A Room with a View (1985) and A Handful of Dust (1988). She took the role of James Bond’s boss, M, in GoldenEye (1995)—the first of several Bond movies in which she appeared—and subsequently played two British queens, the recently widowed Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown (1997) and Queen Elizabeth I in the comedy Shakespeare in Love (1998). For her role as Elizabeth I, she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress, and, for that of Queen Victoria, she won an Academy Award nomination and the Golden Globe Award for best actress in a drama. Additional Oscar nominations for best actress came for her portrayals of British writer Iris Murdoch in Iris (2001), an eccentric theatre owner in Mrs. Henderson Presents (2005), and the lonely teacher Barbara Covett in Notes on a Scandal (2006). During this time she also was nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in Chocolat (2000).\n\nAfter appearing in the musical Nine (2009), Dench played Mrs. Fairfax in Jane Eyre (2011), an adaptation of the Charlotte Brontë novel. In Clint Eastwood’s biopic J. Edgar (2011), she portrayed the mother of J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), and, in the drama My Week with Marilyn (2011), she appeared as actress Sybil Thorndike. She was featured in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011) and its 2015 sequel, both of which concern the comic hijinks of a group of British retirees in India. Dench also starred alongside Steve Coogan in Philomena (2013), based on the true story of a woman’s search for a child she had given up for adoption in her youth. She earned another Oscar nomination for best actress for her work on that film.\n\nIn 2015 Dench paired with Dustin Hoffman in a BBC adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot (1990), and the following year she had a cameo in Tim Burton’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. Dench then reprised the role of Queen Victoria in Victoria and Abdul (2017), which follows the aging monarch’s unlikely friendship with a young servant from India named Abdul Karim. That year she also was part of an all-star cast in Murder on the Orient Express, an adaptation of Agatha Christie’s 1933 novel. Her films from 2018 included Red Joan, a spy drama directed by Trevor Nunn, and Kenneth Branagh’s All Is True, in which she played Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare’s wife. The following year Dench appeared in Cats, a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s hit stage musical. Her later movie credits included Six Minutes to Midnight, a World War II drama, and the comedy Blithe Spirit (both 2020), which was based on a Noël Coward play. For her performance in Branagh’s Belfast (2021), a drama inspired by his childhood during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Dench earned her eighth Oscar nomination, for best supporting actress."
