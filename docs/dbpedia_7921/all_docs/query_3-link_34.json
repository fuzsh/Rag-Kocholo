        "text": "The most popular genre in 2012 was action/adventure\n\nAction/adventure remained the most popular genre among all racial/ethnic groups\n\nMusicals were the least popular genre among all racial/ethnic groups, but art house/indie received the fewest votes overall\n\nAfrican Americans were the biggest fans of dramas\n\nHispanics and Asians appreciated romantic comedies most\n\nHow much of the ranking is based on the perceived quality of 2012 movies available in each genre? For example, if someone felt there were not good musicals in 2012 but normally enjoys musicals, their votes are skewed. If considering movie advertising or product placement, this data may not fully represent where to find your audience."
