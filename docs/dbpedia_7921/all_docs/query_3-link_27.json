        "text": "While we don’t hesitate to label a film “science fiction”, it’s a much rarer occasion that we’ll call a film a “fantasy”. Sure, things like Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and Harry Potter immediately scream fantasy, but beyond these key examples, things can get a little fuzzy. Just the other day, I was trying to think of my favourite fantasy films and found myself floundering.\n\nFantasy books? Easy. Films? Not so much.\n\nAt first, this made me think that the fantasy genre just isn’t as prominent in cinema as it is in science fiction. After all, it seems a new sci-fi block buster comes out every month, and here I was struggling to name the last fantasy film trailer I saw. Then I thought about it a little more and discovered the real reason.\n\nThere are plenty of fantasy feature films out there. The difference is that we don’t always think of them as “fantasy movies”. In fact, the genre is so broad and prolific that when it comes to films, we often focus more on fantasy sub-genres or genre-blends than we do on the overarching genre.\n\nFantasy Movie Types\n\nSo, what are these sub-genres and genre-blends?\n\nWell, I scoured through several “top 100 fantasy movies” and “best fantasy movies of all time” lists on movie-rating sites to identify a few key types. Many films get classified as Action, Adventure, Thriller, Horror and Comedy, but those categories are a bit broad and could encompass fantasy and non-fantasy films, so it seems more useful to narrow things down further:\n\n1. Epic Fantasy Films\n\nThese are the most recognisable “fantasy films”. They are usually based on books and involve swords, spells, wizards, dragons, quests, princes, princesses and just generally all the things you would associate with a run-of-the-mill fantasy.\n\nSome examples: Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Harry Potter, Stardust, The Chronicles of Narnia, Eragon, The Neverending Story, The Golden Compass, The Wizard of Oz\n\n2. Horror Movies/Paranormal Thrillers\n\nYes, not all horror films are fantasy films, just as not all horror novels are fantasy novels, but many are, particularly when it comes to ghosts and supernatural creatures. There are many films that focus on vampires, werewolves, witches, ghosts and the occult, usually in a real-world setting. Because these films often get nested under the categories of ‘thriller’, ‘horror’ and ‘action’, they don’t always get the ‘fantasy’ label.\n\nSome examples: Underworld, Dracula, Constantine, Van Helsing, The Frighteners, The Exorcist, Paranormal Activity, Let the Right One In, The Conjuring, The Others, The Ring, The Sixth Sense\n\n3. Disney Animated Features\n\nAlmost every single Disney animated film is a fantasy. Furthermore, they’re almost all fairy tale fantasies, but I’ve given them their own category because Disney is such an iconic brand that people tend to think of Disney films as a genre all of their own.\n\nSome examples: Frozen, Tangled, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Pinocchio, The Lion King\n\n4. Fairy Tale Films\n\nFilms that are heavily based on a traditional fairy tale, or have a fairy tale feel to them, would include many Disney animated films, and other animated films, but also many live action films.\n\nSome examples: Ever After, Maleficent, Mirror Mirror, Snow White and the Huntsman, Once Upon a Time, Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, Jack the Giant Slayer, Edward Scissorhands\n\n5. Superhero Movies\n\nYes, some superhero films explain away the superpowers with science, but generally superhero films are as much fantasy as they are science fiction, perhaps more so, given the impossible and fantastical nature of many of the superpowers.\n\nSome examples: Thor, The Avengers, The Incredibles, Hellboy, Watchmen, The Hulk, Spider-Man, Superman, Mystery Men\n\n6. Children’s Films\n\nSo many children’s films are fantasy movies – i.e. involve magic or impossible happenings/creatures in some way, but we often overlook these aspects and think of them simply as ‘children’s films’ or ‘family films’. Talking animals and magical powers are so commonplace in this kind of movie that we barely bat an eyelid when we see them.\n\nSome examples: How to Train Your Dragon, Toy Story, The Witches, Jumanji, Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Lego Movie, The Princess Bride, Monsters Inc.\n\n7. Monster Movies\n\nMany monster films are more science fiction than fantasy, working under the guise of scientific plausibility (e.g. Jurassic Park). However, some are equal parts fantasy, with supernatural monsters coming out of the woodwork to terrorise cities and countries.\n\nSome examples: Godzilla, The Mummy, Dracula, Van Helsing, The Creature from the Black Lagoon\n\n8. Christmas Movies\n\nAgain, not all Christmas movies are fantasy films, but many are. The moment you get reindeer and elves and Santa Claus involved, things tend to be pretty solidly in the realm of magic and the impossible.\n\nSome examples: Elf, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Gremlins, A Christmas Carol, The Nightmare Before Christmas, The Santa Claus, The Polar Express\n\n9. Magical Realism\n\nThere is often contention as to whether magical realism is truly a type of fantasy or not (often it involves the magic being not real but in fact imagined by the characters, or being something symbolic rather than something tangible). I tend to be pretty broad in my understanding of a fantasy, so I include it.\n\nSome examples: Pan’s Labyrinth, Sucker Punch, Alice in Wonderland, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, Amélie, Life of Pi, Big Fish\n\n10. Magical-Twist Romantic Comedies\n\nOkay, I call them that for lack of a better title, but you know the kind I’m talking about. One impossible, magical thing happens that changes someone’s life: they become a teenager again, or they change genders, or they are suddenly much older, or they can suddenly hear what other people are thinking, or they are suddenly God. These ones are very light on the fantasy element, I have to admit, but still hinge on a bit of fairy dust or some magical voodoo to get things happening.\n\nSome examples: Suddenly 30, Dating the Enemy, Bruce Almighty, Shallow Hal, 17 Again, Liar Liar, Groundhog Day, About Time\n\n______\n\nOf course, some of the above genres overlap, and you could classify a film as using several of them… but that’s in the nature of genres to be a bit fuzzy and non-exclusive."
