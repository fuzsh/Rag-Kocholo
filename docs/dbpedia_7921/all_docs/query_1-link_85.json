        "text": "The full cast has now been announced for the upcoming West End premiere of the new musical Mrs Henderson Presents which transfers to the Noel Coward Theatre following a run at the Theatre Royal Bath in 2015. The production will begin previews on 9 February 2016, with an official opening on 16 February.\n\nJoining the previously announced Tracie Bennett as 'Laura Henderson', Ian Bartholomew as 'Vivian Van Damm' and Emma Williams as 'Maureen' will be EastEnders actor Jamie Foreman as 'Arthur'.\n\nAs well as creating the role of Derek Branning in hit BBC soap 'EastEnders', Foreman's other TV credits include Lenny in 'Birds of a Feather'. His film credits include Bill Sikes in Roman Polanski's 'Oliver Twist', 'Layer Cake', 'Nil by Mouth', 'Elizabeth' and 'Sleepy Hollow'.\n\nThe full company for the West End production has also been announced, including Robert Hands (Cromer), Matthew Malthouse (Eddie), Samuel Holmes (Bertie), Katie Bernstein (Peggy), Lizzy Connolly (Doris), Lauren Hood (Vera), Liz Ewing (Lady Conway), Sarah Bakker, Andrew Bryant, Rhiannon Chesterman, Alexander Delamere, Emily Goodenough, Victoria Hay, Oliver Jackson, Ian Gareth Jones, Katrina Kleve, Lauren Logan, Tania Newton, Sam O'Rourke, Neil Stewart and Dickie Wood.\n\nFeaturing a book and direction by Terry Johnson, lyrics by Don Black and music by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain, the musical is based on the original screenplay by Martin Sherman.\n\n\"It's London, 1937, and recently-widowed eccentric, Laura Henderson, is looking for a way of spending her time and money when her attention falls on a run-down former cinema in Great Windmill Street. Hiring feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm to look after the newly renovated Windmill Theatre, the improbable duo present a bill of non-stop variety acts. But as war looms something more is required to boost morale and box office... When Mrs Henderson comes up with the idea of The Windmill Girls - glamorous young women posing as nude statues - audiences flock. And as the Blitz hits London, The Windmill provides a refuge for all, boasting the spirit-raising slogan \"We Never Close\".\"\n\nThe production features choreography by Andrew Wright, design by Tim Shortall, sound by Gareth Owen, costumes by Paul Wills and lighting by Ben Ormerod."
