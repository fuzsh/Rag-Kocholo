        "text": "The darker issues of wartime pregnancy and Van Damm’s Jewishness arise naturally from the story and the interplay of character. And there is nothing coy about the big moment when the girls first disrobe, having made the men disrobe first for the sake of parity.\n\nThe stage seems to thrum with an erotic innocence that must have echoed the original revues. The cast, including Jamie Foreman’s authentic “Now then! Now then!” comic, Bennett’s no-nonsense heroine and the girls themselves are superb, capturing the era as well as their characters. The original Windmill Girls came on stage to a standing ovation at the premiere. It made me proud to be British.\n\nMrs Henderson Presents at the Noël Coward Theatre, until June 18 then touring UK Tickets: 0844 482 5140; noelcowardtheatre.co.uk.\n\nYou can now book your theatre and concert tickets online at expresstheatretickets.co.uk."
