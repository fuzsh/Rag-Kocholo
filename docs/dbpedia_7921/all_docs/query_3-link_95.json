        "text": "Featured\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's Greatest Films:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock has been considered the acknowledged auteur master of the thriller or suspense genre, manipulating his audience's fears and desires, and taking viewers into a state of association with the representation of reality facing the character. No list of suspense or thriller films can be complete without mention of the English film-maker/director. He helped to shape the modern-day thriller genre.\n\nAlthough nominated five times as Best Director (from 1940-1960), Hitchcock never won an Academy Award.\n\nFilmsite's listing of Hitchcock's films include links to either a shorter illustrated review, and/or a lengthier analytical review (with poster illustrations)\n\nHitchcock's films often placed an innocent victim (an average, responsible person) into a strange, life-threatening or terrorizing situation, or in a case of mistaken identity, misidentification or wrongful accusation. He also utilized various cinematic techniques (i.e., extreme zoom shots or pull-back shots, prolonged cross-cutting, virtuoso set-pieces, visually-expressive motifs, and montages). He would often interweave a taboo or sexually-related theme into his films (i.e., repressed memories, latent homosexuality, voyeurism, obsession, or a twisted Oedipus complex). In many of his films, there was the inevitable life and death chase concluding with a showdown at a familiar landmark.\n\nAdditional links are provided below for Hitchcock's MacGuffins, and for his signature cameo appearances in most of his feature films.\n\nSee also > > Alfred Hitchcock: MacGuffins, Alfred Hitchcock: Cameo Appearances\n\nAbout Filmsite.org\n\nFilmsite.org (aka Filmsite) is an award-winning website for classic film buffs, students, moviegoers and anyone else interested in the great movies of the last century. Detailed plot synopses, review commentary and film reference material are just some of the features available on the site. The site also contains film analysis, original content, information on the top films and most memorable movie scenes, \"Best of...\" articles, and the most popular film quotes in all genres of film. Its many resources include a comprehensive overview of film history, a complete survey of the Academy Awards (Oscars), milestones and turning points in the industry, and background and descriptions for hundreds of classic Hollywood/American and other English-language movies from the last one hundred years. In the mid-1990s when it was first launched, filmsite.org was one of the first websites to initiate the trend to select 100 Greatest Films in the history of cinema."
