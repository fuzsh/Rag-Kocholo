For you to love the while he lives and mourn for when he's dead. It may be six or seven years or twenty-one or three; But will you, 'til I call him back, take care of him for me? Now will you give him all your love nor think the labor vain, Nor hate Me when I come to call him back again. For all the joy Thy child shall bring, the risk of grief we'll run. But should the angels call for him much sooner than we've planned, We'll brave the bitter grief that comes and try to understand. Profoundly Missed and Deeply Loved,Your Family and Friends\n\n↧\n\nBOSETTI CHARLES ALBERT OF PITT...\n\nBOSETTI CHARLES ALBERT Of Pittsburgh, on September 12, 2013, age 92.
