        "text": "The following is a list of funds made possible through the generosity of trustees, alumnae, parents and friends of the University. Each scholarship has specific criterion. Converse awards named endowed scholarships to deserving students who possess academic ability and leadership potential. Distribution of the endowed scholarship award is made in two equal payments in the fall and spring semesters, unless otherwise noted. The award will be directly applied to the student’s account upon verification of the student’s full-time enrollment. Students will be notified of which donor (s) support their endowed scholarship awards each fall by the Director of Donor Relations. Students are expected to properly acknowledge their donor (s) each year with a progress report of their studies at Converse.\n\nAda Smith Lancaster Endowed Scholarship\n\nAeolian Music Club Scholarship\n\nAgnes Callison Page Carstarphen ’62 Endowed Scholarship\n\nAgnes Petty Pringle Scholarship\n\nAlgernon Sydney Sullivan Foundation Scholarship\n\nAlice A.
