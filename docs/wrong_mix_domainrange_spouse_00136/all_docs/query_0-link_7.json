        "text": "The Smith Family History Part 1 – The Captain\n\nThis month’s family history features the Smith family beginning with Captain James A. Smith and his wife Mary Anne Underwood. According to the Museum’s family history binder, James A. Smith was born circa 1825 in Pendleton, Co., and married Mary in 1848 in Indiana. I could not find documents to support this. The 1861 Census for Amherstburg lists James and Mary Smith along with their children Henry, John, Joseph, James, Sarah, Clarence, Mary and Gertrude. The 1871 Census lists a few more children including Roman, Filo (Philo), and Anna. This record also lists James as a Steward, while his son John was a Mariner and Joseph was a Farmer. The 1881 Census lists the occupation for James Sr,, James Jr., Clarence and Roman as Mariners, while Mary E. was a seamstress.\n\nBefore discussing James and Mary’s children, I will share a few more details about them first. Sadly, on November 13, 1891, The Amherstburg Echo printed Mary Underwood Smith’s obituary writing “SMITH – In Amherstburg, on Tuesday, November 10th, Mary Ann, beloved wife of Capt. James A. Smith, aged 53 years, 9 months. Deceased, whose maiden name was Mary Ann Underwood, was born in Mount Pleasant, Jefferson Co., Ohio, on January 17th, 1824, and was a daughter of Rev. Mr. Underwood, who preached here several times, some years ago, although he was never stationed here. Mrs. Smith came here when about 16 years old and in 1848 was married to James A. Smith, who survives her. Three brothers of the deceased are also living, viz.: Rev. J.P. Underwood, of Mt. Pleasant, Ohio; James Underwood, of Mananhua?, Wis., and Albert Underwood, of California. By her union with Mr. Smith, she has borne twelve children, of whom, two are dead, Pleasant Henry and George. The surviving children are: John W., mariner, of Cleveland, O.; Joseph L., of Marquette, Mich.; Jas. W., mariner; Sarah J. (Mrs. Geo. Foster, of Malden); Clarence, who is steward on the steambarge, Prentias; Mary, (Mrs. Samuel McDowell, of Windsor); Roman F., steward on the Bulgaria; Gertrude (Mrs. Wm Bush, of Amherstburg); Philo G., steward on the John Martin; and Annie, who lives at home. Mrs. Smith has lived here ever since her marriage and enjoyed good health until about 10 years ago, when she began to fall and in June last she was taken worse, since which time she has suffered much. She was troubled considerably with her kidneys and an ulceration in the stomach. For almost two weeks previous to her death she was troubled much with hemorrhages. Every [sic] since coming to Amherstburg, Mrs. Smith has been a regular consistent member of the First Baptist church and the funeral will take place from the late family residence on King street to the church this (Friday) afternoon at 1 o’clock thence to the cemetery. Rev. J.A. Holt will officiate and will be assisted by Rev. W.S. Kane.”\n\nI was also able to find James A. Smith’s death record and obituary. According to his death record, James passed away on August 8, 1904. His obituary which appeared in The Amherstburg Echo on August 12, 1904 shares that “SMITH – In Windsor, Monday, August 8th, at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. S. McDowell, 151 Windsor avenue, James A. Smith, aged 78 years and 11 months. Capt. James A. Smith was born in Virginia in 1821? And came to Amherstburg 1840? He was married to Mary Ann Underwood in 1847. Twelve children were born to them as follows: John W. of Cleveland; Joseph L. of Marquette; James W., of Cincinnati; Clarence, who is steward on City of Banger; Gertrude (Mrs. Wm. Bush), Amherstburg, Philo, steward of Str. Senator; Anna, (Mrs. J.C. Weeden), of Springfield, Ky; Mary, (Mrs. Sam’l McDowell, Windsor; Roman, steward of steamer Princeton, Sarah J., (the late George H. Foster), died on 23rd March, 1899, and Henry and George died in Youth. Besides above he leaves 25 grandchildren. Mrs. Smith died on November 10th, 1891. Capt. Smith resided here continuously from 1841 to about 1894, when he sold his property and went to live with his daughter, Mrs. McDowell, in Mich. He was a member of the First Baptist church for over 53? Years. Deceased followed the lakes for many years and sailed the schooners Barber and Annie L. Sloan. He was very successful so cumulated a good deal of property, including a farm in Colchester North. He was a most even tempered man and was never known to be angry or say an angry word. He was a friend to all and did not have any enemy. The funeral took place yesterday, Thursday, via funeral car on the electric railway, thence to the First Baptist church where services were conducted by Rev. Mr. Bradby, Windsor, assisted by Rev. T.W. Johnston. Interment took place in Rose Hill cemetery. The pallbearers were Thos. H. Harris, Wm. Edwards, Jas. Dodsin, J.D. Brown, S. McDowell and Jos. Bell.”\n\nWhat we publish is not a complete history of any family and is based on the documents that are available. We welcome photos and information to fill in the gaps. See you next week for part 2.\n\nThe Smith Family History Part 2 – The Barber\n\nAs mentioned, James and Mary had 12 children including Henry, George, John, Joseph, James, Sarah, Clarence, Mary, Gertrude, Roman, Philo and Anna. I’ll start with Henry. According to James A. Smith’s obituary, Henry died in youth. The 1861 Census lists him as 15, meaning that he was born circa 1846. The 1871 Census does not list Henry, so it is likely that he passed away between 1861 and 1871. There was also limited information for Henry’s brother George. His father James’ obituary mentions that he, just like Henry, died in youth.\n\nGeorge’s brother John W. Smith, according to the 1871 Census, was a mariner. He married Amelia Brown, the daughter of William Brown, on August 16, 1875 in Amherstburg. On August 20th, The Amherstburg Echo reported “SMITH – BROWN – At Amherstburg on Monday, August 16th, by the Rev. Wm. Pitt, Baptist Minister, Mr. John W. Smith son of Capt. Smith, to Miss Amelia Brown, all of Amherstburg.”\n\nJohn’s brother Joseph L. Smith is next. The 1871 Census states that he was a farmer and born circa 1851. He married Ida French on May 18, 1879 in Marquette, Michigan. The 1880 Census for Marquette records Joseph and his wife Ida and their daughter Ida. Joseph is also listed as a Barber. The 1900 Census records Joseph and Ida along with their other children James L., Grace F., Erma L., Zerelda E., Joseph L., and Margaret J. Find A Grave also lists Florence and Gertrude as additional children of Joseph and Ida. Their daughter Ida is not listed because she sadly passed away on August 5, 1897 in Marquette, Michigan. Ida’s birth record states that she was born on June 7, 1880. The next Census for 1910 lists Joseph as widowed, meaning that Ida passed away between 1900 and 1910. I could not find an obituary for Ida. The 1910 Census also shows that Joseph was still working as a Barber but owned his own shop.\n\nI found a few documents for Joseph and Ida’s children. Their daughter Margaret was born on February 10, 1899 in Marquette, Michigan. I couldn’t find a birth record for Margaret’s brother James L. Smith, but I found his death record. His death record says that he passed away on November 1, 1903. James was also a student and single. James’ brother Joseph Smith passed away on December 12, 1927 in Chicago at the age of 31. His death record also reveals that he was born on October 5, 1896 in Marquette, Michigan. Joseph was also single and worked as a labourer. Joseph’s sister Gertrude’s death was reported in the October 28, 1898 edition of The Amherstburg Echo which reported “On Tuesday, Mrs. Geo. H. Foster received a telegram from Marquette, Mich., stating that Gertrude, daughter of her brother, Jos. L. Smith, aged 16 years, died there. It is only a year since Mr. Smith lost an older daughter.”\n\nJoseph’s father Joseph L. Smith passed away on October 28, 1928 in Marquette, Michigan. Joseph’s death record states that he was born on August 23, 1851. The Amherstburg Echo reported his death on November 9, 1928 writing “SMITH – In Marquette, Michigan, Tuesday, October 30th, 1928, Joseph L. Smith, son of the late Capt. James A. Smith, and brother of Mrs. W.H. Bush, Sandwich street, Amherstburg, aged 77 years.”\n\nJoseph L. Smith’s brother James lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, but I could not find any further information for him. I was able to find substantially more on James’ sister Sarah J. Smith. She married George H., the son of Levi Foster and Elizabeth Waring. George was born on July 3, 1838 in Ohio. George’s father operated several businesses and he and his brother James W. continued their father Levi’s livery stable business after he passed away. Advertisements for their business can be found in The Amherstburg Echo and one ad from April 30, 1875 says “FOSTER & BROTHER’S Livery Stables – Apsley Street, near Richmond, Amherstburg – All parties requiring horses for hire can obtain the best in town, with stylish Buggies or Cutters at their stables. Commercial travellers supplied with fast and reliable horses and good buggies or wagons on short notice. All visiting this town who require anything in this line will do well to call on FOSTER & BRO.”\n\nGeorge H. and Sarah had at least seven children: George H. Jr., Waring, Philo Smith/Smithie, Maud, Evelyn, Madeline and Sarah. Their children will be discussed shortly, but first a bit more about George H. and Sarah. George H. worked as a porter on the Great Lakes fleet, and The Amherstburg Echo mentions that in April 1895, George H. worked as a steward on the steamer ‘State of Michigan,’ while in August 1898 “Mrs. George H. Foster left on Wednesday morning for Port Stanley to visit a week with Mr. Foster who is steward on the steamer Flora.” When his wife Sarah (Smith) sadly passed in 1899, George H. stopped working in this profession and was left to solely care for their children on their farm.\n\nIn Sarah’s 1899 obituary found in The Amherstburg Echo it says “This township suffered a keen and distinct loss on Thursday last, in the death of Mrs. George H. Foster. The deceased lady was widely known and her many estimable qualities endeared her to a large circle of friends, who were most assiduous in their attentions during her illness. She suffered more or less for the past two years with cancer of the stomach, and when it terminated fatally her many friends were grief stricken. The funeral was held on Sunday, and was one of the largest seen for sometime. Services were conducted in the First Baptist church, by Rev. J.H. Hot, pastor assisted by Rev. W. T. Artis, pastor of the A.M.E. church, and Rev. W. Dickey, of Chicago. The church was crowded to the doors and many stood outside listening to the very impressive services. Interment took place in Rose Hill cemetery, following being the pall- bearers: – D.R. Davis, J.H. Alexander, Samuel McDowell and Leander Jones. Mrs. Foster was born Jan. 12th, 1854, and so was 45 years 2 months of age at her death. She was one of a family of ten, being a daughter of Capt. James A. Smith, of Amherstburg. The other members of the family are John W., of Erie, Pa.: Joseph L., of South Dakota; Clarence E., of Amherstburg; Mary E. (Mrs. Samuel McDowell), of Windsor; Gertrude (Mrs. W.H. Bush), of Amherstburg; Roman J., of Cleveland, Ohio; Phylo G., of Wanesburg, Pa., and Annie M., of Shelbyville, Ky. Mrs. Foster was married to Geo. H. Foster, at Amherstburg, on May 6th, 1874. Seven children were born to them, all of whom are living – 3 sons and four daughters – George, aged 23, Waring, 16; Philo, 14, Maud, 13, Evelyne, 11; Madaline, 6, and Sarah, 4. The deceased was an earnest Christian and was a member of the Baptist church the past 31 years. Her Christian fortitude enabled her to bear her last illness without a murmur. She expressed herself as ready and willing to go at her Master’s bidding. She frequently told her husband not to grieve, for she was all right. Liberality and kindness were two great traits in her character and her home was open to all whom she could assist. The sorrowing family wish to return sincere thanks to their many friends who were so kind and attentive to their loved one in her last illness, some especially being particularly attentive, whose names it will be unnecessary to mention. Those from a distance who attended the funeral were Samuel McDowell, wife and son, and L. Hyatt, of Windsor; Roman Smith and wife, of Cleveland, and Annie M. Smith, of Shelbyville, Ky.”\n\nA few years after Sarah passed, in 1902, George H. passed away which is recorded in The Amherstburg Echo. The article says, “A very sudden death, of a citizen of this township, occurred Monday evening last, on the quarry road, when George H. Foster passed away without, so far as is known, a moment’s warning. Mr. Foster had been in Amherstburg that day and on returning home went about his chores. Later he was driving a hog along the quarry road and it is supposed that he became worried following the animal, bringing on a sudden attack of heart failure, he having been troubled for some time with heart disease, and he dropped on the road, never apparently having moved again. When the children came from school they found the house locked and the neighbors became alarmed at Mr. Foster’s absence for the man was always very punctual, and a number of them went out to search for him. In the meantime the body had been found by the Powers’ boys, who reported same to coroner Hobley. An order was given for its removal and it was taken to the house. The death has caused a profound sensation amon[g] the people of the section and in Amherstburg where deceased was well known. He was a most kind hearted man and was always showing little kindnesses to his friends. He was born in the State of Ohio, July 3rd, 1838, so was 64 years of age last July. With his parents he came to Amherstburg, when he was but an infant. His father, the late Levi Foster, kept livery stable in Amherstburg on Apsley street for many years. There was a large family, five of whom are left. They are: – Levi, of Wisconsin; Elizabeth, of Los Angeles, Cal.; Mrs. Jacobs, of the same place; besides two half brother, John, of Amherstburg; Thos. Of Biggar City, Oregon, and a half sister, Mrs. Annie Hyatt, of Windsor.”\n\nThe obituary continues saying, “On May 6th, 1875 the deceased was married to MISS SARAH J. SMITH, in Amherstburg. They lived there for a few years and then moved to Malden, on the farm next to the cemetery. They had eight children, seven of whom are living. They are: George H. of Cleveland; Waring, Smith, Maud, Evelyn, Madeline and Sarah, at home. Mrs. Foster died three years ago last March. Since that time Mr. Foster had remained at home and attended to the farm. Previous to that he had been a steward on some of the larger liners. He was a member of a Masonic Lodge in Cleveland and a member of the First Baptist Church, Amherstburg.”\n\nAfter George H.’s passing several of his children were sent to live with their Aunt Gertrude Smith Bush, wife of William H. Bush and sister of George’s wife Sarah Smith Foster. Gertrude and William married circa 1888 and the couple had no children. Additionally, Gertrude was active in the community, particularly as a member of the First Baptist Church for more than sixty years, a member of the Ladies Sewing Circle and the Ladies Missionary Society.\n\nGeorge H. and Sarah’s sons followed in the footsteps of their father and worked as cooks in the shipping industry. The August 3, 1900 edition of The Amherstburg Echo states that George and Sarah’s son, George H. Jr. worked on the steamer ‘Iron Chief’ while in the December 21, 1900 edition it says Waring Foster, was “among the arrivals home from sailing this week.” I found another reference to Waring Foster in The Amherstburg Echo from September 9, 1921 which says “Mrs. William Bush, Sandwich street, received a telegram Tuesday evening from her nephew, George Foster, of Cleveland, stating that his brother, H. Waring Foster, had died that day at Welland, Ont., where he had been employed. No further details have been received up to going to press. Mr. Foster was a son of the late George Foster, of Malden. He leaves two brothers, George and Smith, of Cleveland, and uncle Philo, Pennsylvania, and three sisters, Mrs. Lightfoot, teacher in the Public schools, Cleveland; Mrs. Reynolds, of Cleveland, and Mrs. Charles M. Jones, of Carrying Place, Ontario. The remains were brought to Amherstburg last (Thursday) evening and will be interred today (Friday).”\n\nWaring’s brother George H. Jr. married Florence Isabelle Dunjill and The Amherstburg Echo describes their wedding which took place on Christmas night in 1901, adding that “The decorations were appropriate to the Christmas season. After the ceremony a reception was held at the bride’s home and the happy couple left that night for their wedding trip to Canada. They expect to make Cleveland their future home. The bride’s maids were Miss Addie Hackley and Miss Florence Wilson. The groomsmen were J.E. Dunjill and J.G. Robinson.”\n\nNext is George H. Jr.’s sister, Maud. She married Charles L. Jones who was the son of Leander Jones of Anderdon. On December 22, 1911, The Amherstburg Echo printed a brief account of their wedding which says “A very quiet and pretty wedding was solemnized last Tuesday afternoon, when Rev. Allan Peavy using the ring service, united in marriage Miss Maud Foster, eldest daughter of the late Geo. H. Foster, and Charles L. Jones, son of the late Leander Jones, of Anderdon. The bride was daintily attired in white … and was attended by her sister, Mrs. Evelyn Foster McCurdy, who was also in white. H.W. Foster served as best man. Those present were the immediate relatives of both families, the out-of-town guests being Mrs. Louisa F. Jacobs, of Los Angeles, Cal.; Mrs. George H. Foster, of Cleveland, Ohio; Mrs. Leroy N. McCurdy and son Foster, of Conneaut, Ohio, and Philo G. Smith, of Waynesburg, Pa. The bride was the recipient of many handsome and useful presents. Mr. and Mrs. Jones will be at home to their friends at his mother’s home in Anderdon for the present.”\n\nMaud’s sister Madeline married Dr. John E. Murrell and the couple had a daughter named Marilyn. Madeline and John’s marriage is recounted in the September 22, 1922 edition of The Amherstburg Echo and says “The residence of Mr. and Mrs. P.W. Lemon, 2330 E. 55th street, Cleveland, was the scene of a quiet but very pretty wedding on the evening of September 2nd, when Mrs. Madeline E. Lightfoot, third daughter of the late George H. Foster, of Malden, and John E. Murrell were united in marriage by Rev. E.A. Clarke of St. John’s A.M.E. church. ‘O Promise Me’ was sweetly rendered by Madame Grace Willis Thompson, followed by the Mendelssohn wedding march, played by Miss Marguerite Sanford. The bride was beautifully attired in white crepe romaine trimmed with satin and lace and carried a shower bouquet of white rosebuds. A string of pearls and lilies of the valley in her hair were the only ornaments. The ceremony was performed amid a profusion of gladioli and palms and Philo S. Foster, brother of the bride gave her in marriage. During the reception, Harry Thompson sang several selections. Mr. and [Mrs.] Murrell were the recipients of many lovely gifts in silver, cut glass, china, linen and mahogany.”\n\nAccording to her October 31, 1946 obituary from The Amherstburg Echo, “Dies Suddenly In Cleveland – Madilene Foster Murrell passed away suddenly of a heart attack at her home, 1065 E. 97th Street, Cleveland, Ohio, September 25. She was born in Amherstburg, daughter of the late George H. and Sarah Smith Foster and niece of the late Mrs. Gertrude Bush. She leaves to mourn her loss her husband, Dr. John E. Murrell and daughter Marilyn, besides three sisters and two brothers, Mrs. Maud Jones of Toronto; Philo S. Foster of Geneva, Ohio, and George H. Foster, Mrs. Evelyn Cowan and Mrs. Sara Lee of Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs. Murrell received her degree in education at Western Reserve University. She retired a year ago after teaching in the Cleveland Public Schools for thirty years. She was a member of St. John’s A.M.E. Church, Alpha Kappa Alpha National Sorority, and had long been active in the League of Women Voters.”\n\nMadeline’s husband is also praised in the September 5, 1930 edition of The Amherstburg Echo which writes “Graduate of Our High School” – “The Editor of The Echo was glad to meet on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition, at Toronto, on Press Day, Friday last, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Jones and to learn how well Mr. Jones is getting along. He will be remembered as a native of Anderdon, who after graduating from the public and high schools here passed through the normal school and taught for a few years in Ontario. He then entered Queen’s university and graduated from that institution after a very creditable course, and is now mathematical teacher on the staff of one of the largest high schools in Toronto. Mrs. Jones is the eldest daughter of the late George Foster. Mr. and Mrs. Jones are a frugal pair, have saved their money, and are just completing a nice new home in Toronto. The products of this district certainly do make good out in the world in competition with the best of them.”\n\nMadeline’s obituary mentions that her sister Sarah Maria Foster married into the Lee family and lived in Cleveland, Ohio. With further research, I discovered Sarah’s marriage certificate which says that she married James Reynolds Lee of Cleveland, Ohio, on October 19, 1914 in Amherstburg. James was the son of John L. Lee and Susan Reynolds. Their marriage record also reveals that Sarah worked as a stenographer, while James Reynolds Lee was a dentist.\n\nWhat we publish is not a complete history of any family and is based on the documents that are available. We welcome photos and information to fill in the gaps. See you next week for part 3.\n\nThe Smith Family History Part 3 – The Preacher\n\nNow that I have discussed Henry, George, John, Joseph, James, and Sarah, I will continue with their siblings Clarence, Mary, Gertrude, Roman, Philo and Anna. Clarence married Sarah Monroe Smith, the daughter of Rosina Turner and William Monroe. There is a detailed write up for Clarence Smith in the Amherstburg Echo printed in the May 8, 1914 issue, following his death. It says “Clarence Smith, one of the best known marine chefs sailing from the port, passed away in the Marine Hospital, Buffalo, Monday afternoon. News of his death came with a shock to the town for it was not generally known marine chefs sailing from the boat, the John J. Barlum, two weeks ago, he was in a very weakened condition. He had suffered considerably during the winter with stomach trouble, but partly recovered and when spring came, he received a telegram from the owners of the Barlum asking him to merely superintend the work of ? out so decided to leave. The work however, overtaxed his strength and he was taken off at Buffalo, and removed to the Marine hospital a week ago Monday. Mrs. Smith was called there to see him on Thursday, returning Sunday, as the hospital authorities declared he was too weak to be moved. The body arrived home Wednesday evening, and funeral services took place yesterday (Thursday) afternoon, being conducted in the First Baptist church, of which deceased was a deacon and devoted member for thirty years. Lovely floral offerings covered the casket, chief among which were those from John. J. Barlum, the A.F.&A. M., O.E.S., and Ladies’ Sewing Circle. Mr. Smith was a native of Amherstburg, his parents being the late Mr. and Mrs. James Smith. Of the family three sisters and five brothers are living – Mary, Gertie, Annie, John, Joseph, James, Roman and Philo. From his youth he took up the vocation of marine steward and spent a useful life following the lakes and had charge of the steward department of many of the largest freight steamers that run from one end of the Great Lakes to the other, and at the time of taking to his death bed when he was removed from the boat to the Marine hospital in Buffalo, he held the position of head steward on the steamer John J. Barlum the flagship of the Portal Steamship Co., of Detroit, Mich. Mr. Smith’s activity in church and lodge were recognized as very valuable among the fraternity. He was married to Sarah Monroe, daughter of William and Rosine Monroe, of Amherstburg, and leaves to mourn his loss his beloved wife Sarah Smith, and two children, Blanche and Mortimer. Mr. Smith was personally known to nearly everyone in town. He possessed a good education and worked strenuously to improve the schools. His industry and thrift are evidenced in the beautiful home they occupy corner Gore and Bathurst streets. He spent two sessions in Toronto at the Legislature during the life of Hon. W.D. Balfour, and became the personal messenger in the House of the late Hon. A.S. Hardy, Premier of Ontario.”\n\nI was also able to find an obituary for Clarence’s wife Sarah in the December 12, 1949 issue of The Windsor Daily Star which says “Mrs. Clarence E. Smith – Mrs. Sarah Munroe Smith, 889 Marentette avenue, died on Saturday at her residence after a long illness. Mrs. Smith was born in Amherstburg, and lived there before coming to Windsor 27 years ago. She was a member of the Missionary Society of First Baptist Church. She was the widow of Clarence E. Smith. She is survived by one son, Mortimer, and one daughter Blanche E., both at home. Funeral services will be held from the residence on Tuesday at 2 p.m. Rev. Mack Brown officiating. Burial will be in Rose Hill Cemetery, Amherstburg.”\n\nAccording to Clarence’s obituary, he and Sarah had two children: Mortimer and Blanche. Mortimer C. Smith was born on August 14, 1892 in Amherstburg and according to his Naturalization Papers from 1948, he was single with no children, and worked as a Janitor. Blanchie Smith’s birth record states that she was born on March 20, 1888 in Amherstburg.\n\nClarence’s sister Mary E. Smith is the next child of Captain James A. Smith and Mary Ann Underwood. She married Samuel McDowell, the son of John and Mary McDowell, on May 10, 1882 in Amherstburg. Mary and Samuel had several children including James, Samuel Lyons, Roman Lafayette, Mary Gertrude, Benjamin Arthur, Frederick Robert, Ethel/Edith Eloise, Sherman, Lawrence. James was born on December 9, 1882 in Windsor, but sadly passed away the same day. Samuel Lyons was born on May 14, 1884 in Windsor, while his brother Roman Lafayette was born on January 4, 1886, also in Windsor. Roman married Anna Ward, daughter of James Dennis and Esther Crump, on June 19, 1924 in Detroit. She was born on August 18, 1880, in Colchester South. Her marriage record to Roman lists her as Anna Ward, but her maiden name is Dennis. This is because she was previously married to Virgil M. Ward, son of Virgil M. Ward and Mary E. Snowden. The couple married on October 25, 1905, in Detroit.\n\nRoman’s wife Anna is mentioned in The Broder Cities’ Star on March 1, 1932 because of a concert presented by the Baptist Church in Amherstburg. The program included “an interesting paper on ‘Woman’s Place in the Federation of Churches’ which was presented by Mrs. Roman McDowell. Roman also served in WWI based on an article from The Border Cities’ Star which, on December 20, 1918, printed “Wreath of Flowers from Flanders Field – In the front room window of the home of Mrs. Mary McDowell, 131 Windsor avenue, hangs a Christmas wreath made of holly from France, in which are woven many flowers from the battlefields of Flanders. The wreath was sent to Mrs. McDowell by her son, Pte. R. McDowell, now overseas, and who, previous to his enlisting, was well known in Windsor.” I believe that Pte. R. McDowell is Mary’s son Roman and this is confirmed in his obituary. His obituary appeared in The Windsor Star on October 31, 1950 and says “Roman L. McDowell, 64, died yesterday at Receiving Hospital, Detroit, after a short illness. Mr. McDowell was born in Windsor and lived here all his life prior to moving to Detroit 15 years ago. He was a member of the First Baptist Church, Windsor, and a veteran of World War I. Survivors are his wife, Mrs. Rose McDowell; two brothers, Arthur and Sherman McDowell, of Windsor; and one sister, Mrs. Eloise Taylor, of Windsor. Funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. on Thursday at the First Baptist Church, Windsor, with Rev. M. Brown officiating. Burial will be in Windsor Grove Cemetery. The body will be at the Bristol Funeral Home, Detroit, until the funeral service in Windsor.” In Roman’s obituary it mentions that his wife was named Rose. This is a shortform for Roseanna, also mentioned previously as Anna Ward. I can confirm that Rose and Anna are the same person because of Roman’s naturalization record which lists Rosanna as his wife, whom he married on June 19, 1924. This is the same date that he married Anna, confirming that they are the same person.\n\nRoman’s sister Mary Gertrude McDowell was born on September 2, 1887 in Windsor. Her death record states that she passed on December 13, 1907 in Windsor at the age of 20. She is also listed as single. I could not find an obituary for Mary Gertrude. Gertrude’s brother Benjamin Arthur McDowell was born on July 15, 1889. His brother Frederick Robert was born on June 14, 1891, but sadly passed away the following month on July 22, 1891.\n\nEthel Eloise McDowell is the next child of Samuel McDowell and Mary Elizabeth Smith. She was born on June 21, 1892 in Windsor. According to her marriage record, she married Louis Franklin Taylor, the son of Frank Taylor and Doshea Wilson, on October 23, 1920. Ethel sadly passed away on July 22, 1984 as was reported in The Windsor Star on July 25th. Her obituary says “TAYLOR – Eloise Ethel, 96 years, July 22, 1984 at Beacon Hill Lodge, formerly of Windsor Ave. Predeceased by her husband Louis Taylor (1957). Dear mother of Louis (a former member of the National Parole Board) Willowdale. Two grandchildren also survive. Resting at the Anderson Funeral Home, 895 Ouellette Ave. from 7pm Tuesday. Will rest at the First Baptist Church, (Mercer at Tuscorora St.) from 12 noon Wednesday, July 25, until 1 pm, time of Service. Rev. Mack Brown officiating. Interment Windsor Grove Cemetery.”\n\nEthel’s brother Sherman was born on February 12, 1896. He married Ida Mae Brooks, daughter of Daniel Brooks and Eliza Lewis, on May 31, 1924 in Windsor. On January 9, 1964 The Windsor Star reported that Sherman McDowell passed away. His obituary says “Hotel Figure Dies at 67 – Sherman Smith (Chief) McDowell, 67, former head porter at the Prince Edward Hotel, died Wednesday at IODE Memorial Hospital. He lived at 1093 Windsor Ave. ‘Chief’ as he was called by his fellow workers and hotel guests, was employed by the hotel for approximately 32 years. During his years as head porter of the downtown hotel, Mr. McDowell’s main job was setting up travellers’ display rooms. He worked at his job until he became ill in September 1960. During the First World War, he served overseas with the 18th Battalion, CEF. Surviving are his wife, Ida Marie; a brother Arthur, of Windsor; a sister, Mrs. Eloise Taylor, also of Windsor, and three nieces.”\n\nI could not find a birth record for Sherman’s brother Samuel Lawrence, but he is referenced a few times in the press. On October 2, 1908, The Amherstburg Echo printed “Lawrence McDowell, one of Windsor’s best known colored men and a graduate of the Collegiate Institute, left on Monday for Richmond, Va., where he will continue his studies for this ministry.” He is mentioned again on June 3, 1910 when The Amherstburg Echo reported “Samuel Lawrence McDowell, son of Mr. and Mrs. S.L. McDowell, Windsor avenue, Windsor, formerly of Amherstburg, has sent word to his parents that he has passed his final examination in theology at the Virginia Union University at Richmond, Virginia, where he has been studying for the past three or four years. At the graduating exercises Mr. McDowell was literally showered with presents from fellow students and the professors. He was popular with his different classes and the teachers. In all his examinations he passed with honors, and during the past year was frequently called on to teach the class in theology in the temporary absence of the professors. Mr. McDowell immediately after being graduated left for Toronto, Ont., where he becomes pastor of the University Avenue Baptist church, a large and influential congregation. Mr. McDowell was a bright student while at the Windsor Collegiate Institute and his friends predicted he would shine in his college course.”\n\nOver a decade later, The Border Cities’ Star reported “Dr. M’Dowell To Talk Sunday – Former Windsor Man Will Conduct Services In Church Here – Dr. S. Lawrence McDowell, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Brownsville, Tenn., will preach at the evening service in First Baptist Church, Windsor, Sunday. Dr. McDowell is a speaker of wide experience, having been stationed in several churches in the north as well as the south. He was formerly pastor of the University Avenue Baptist Church at Toronto. One Tuesday night at 8 o’clock Dr. McDowell will lecture on ‘The Negro Facing the Future.’ The meeting will be open to the general public. Dr. McDowell is a former Windsor man, being the oldest son of Mrs. Mary McDowell, 511 Windsor avenue. The morning service in the First Baptist Church will be conducted by the pastor, Rev. H.L. Talbot. His subject will be ‘The Three Survivors.” It was also reported on January 26, 1950 in The Amherstburg Echo that “Rev. S. Lawrence McDowell, a former moderator of the Amherstburg convention of the B.M.E. Church died Monday at Nashville, Tennessee, after a lengthy illness.”\n\nNow that I’ve discussed the children of Mary Elizabeth and Samuel McDowell, I’ll end this section with a few more details about Mary and Samuel. On November 4, 1910 The Amherstburg Echo printed Samuel’s obituary which says “The funeral of the late Samuel McDowell, whose death notice appeared in the last issue, took place Saturday afternoon to Windsor Grove cemetery and was largely attended by friends and relatives from this town. Mr. McDowell was a son of the late John McDowell, and was born in Anderdon fifty-five years ago. He was one of a large family, only one of whom is now living, Benjamin, of Toledo. He moved to Amherstburg as a young man and was here married to Mary Smith, daughter of the late Capt. James A. Smith. Mrs. McDowell is sister of Mrs. W.H. Bush and Clarence Smith, of this town; Roman Smith, of Cleveland, and J.L. Smith, of Marquette, Mich. Mr. and Mrs. McDowell moved to Windsor some 28 years ago, and became not only one of the best know chefs on the great lakes, but was one of the most highly respected citizens of Windsor. He had charge of the kitchen on the big steel steamer Amasa Stone, for years, and often catered to John D. Rockefeller, J. Pierpont Morgan, and other well known financiers on trips up the lakes. He was compelled to give up his position a short time ago owing to heart trouble, and this caused his death. Besides his widow, he leaves the following family: Rev. Lawrence, pastor University Baptist church, Toronto; Arthur B., clerk, Windsor postoffice; Roman, a mariner and Ella Louise, at home.”\n\nOver a decade later, Mary’s obituary was printed in The Amherstburg Echo which said “Amherstburg homes were saddened by the death in Windsor, Sunday evening, of Mrs. Mary Elizabeth McDowell, widow of the late Samuel McDowell, of that city. She had been a patient sufferer for more than two years. Funeral services were held at the family home, 511 Windsor avenue, Wednesday afternoon, to the First Baptist there, followed by burial in Windsor Grove cemetery. Mrs. McDowell came from one of Amherstburg’s old families. Her maiden name was Mary Elizabeth Smith, and she was a daughter of the late Capt. James A. Smith, who is well remembered in Amherstburg. She was married here about 39 years ago to Mr. McDowell, and they spent all their married life in the Border Cities. Surviving her is the following family: Rev. Lawrence McDowell, of Durham, N.C.; Roman of Detroit; Arthur, mail carrier, of Windsor; Mrs. Lewis Taylor, of Detroit, and Sherman, at home. Besides she leaves the following brothers and sisters: John Smith, of Lorain; Joseph, of Marquette; Philo, of Waynesboro, Pa; Mrs. Wm. H. Bush, of Amherstburg, and Mrs. H. Weeden, of Louisville, Ky., to all of whom sincere sympathy is extended.”\n\nThe Border Cities’ Star also printed an obituary for Mary which shares further details. It says “Mrs. M. M’Dowell – Resident of Windsor for 42 Years Passes; Amherstburg Native – Mrs. Mary McDowell, 511 Windsor avenue, died Sunday at her residence. She was an old resident of Windsor, having lived here for 42 years, coming here from Amherstburg, her birthplace. The late Mrs. McDowell was active in church work, and was a member of the Board of Management of the Home of the Friendless. Surviving her are one daughter, Mrs. Louis Taylor, of Windsor, and four sons, Rev. Lawrence McDowell, of Durham, N.C., Arthur, Sherman and Roman, all of Windsor. Funeral services will be held at the First Baptist church, Wednesday, at 2 p.m. Interment will be made in Windsor Grove cemetery.”\n\nWhat we publish is not a complete history of any family and is based on the documents that are available. We welcome photos and information to fill in the gaps. See you next week for part 4.\n\nThe Smith Family History Part 4 – The Cavalry\n\nNow that I have discussed Mary Elizabeth Smith McDowell, I’ll move on to discuss her sister Gertrude Henrietta Smith. Gertrude married William H. Bush, the son of Luther Bush and Martha Kirtley, which was announced in The Amherstburg Echo and said “At Sandusky, Sergeant William H. Bush, to Miss Gertie H., third daughter of Capt. J.A. Smith, all of Amherstburg.” The Echo also mentions William’s service a second time stating “William H. Brush, eldest son of Luther Bush, of Amherstburg, has returned home after five years service in the U.S. cavalry.” I was able to find a military record for William Henry Bush which recorded that he was a Private in Troop C9, US Cavalry. This record also says that William was born on May 18, 1857, enlisted on June 11, 1878 and was discharged on June 10, 1883. It also mentions the date of his passing, March 3, 1937, which is confirmed on William’s death record.\n\nWilliam’s obituary shares more information and says “Death of W.H. Bush – Following an illness of seven weeks, the death occurred of William Henry Bush, Wednesday, March 3, at his home on Sandwich Street, Amherstburg. Deceased was one of the well known and highly respected members of the colored community and his death is deeply regretted by his large circle of friends. Mr. Bush was born in Amherstburg, the son of Luther and Martha Bush, and resided here until a young man, when he joined the United States Cavalry to fight in the Indian wars. He enlisted June 11, 1878, and served until the year 1883 when he received his honorable discharge. The first year he was in the army he was promoted to the rank of sergeant and won for himself a distinguished record for bravery in battle. In 1890 he was married to Gertrude Smith of Amherstburg, daughter of the late Capt. James Smith and the former Mary Underwood. Deceased was best known for his lengthy career as a marine chef. He sailed the lakes for 15 years, retiring only nine years ago. The last boat on which he sailed was the Homer D. Williams. Since his retirement he has devoted most of his time to his chief hobby, the culivation [sic] of flowers, and his lawn and flower beds showed more than anything else the love of the beauties of nature which he possessed. Surviving him are his wife and one cousin, Mrs. Clara Mitchell of Ann Arbor, Mich. One brother predeceased him. The funeral service will be held this Friday afternoon at his late residence with the Rev. Penny of Windsor, and Rev. I.H. Edwards of Amherstburg, officiating. Interment will take place in Rose Hill cemetery.”\n\nIt was only a few years later that Gertrude’s passing was reported in The Amherstburg Echo on April 27, 1944 which reported “Death of Old Resident – Mrs. Gertrude H. Bush, widow of William H. Bush, passed away at her home on Sandwich Street, Friday, April 21. She was born in Amherstburg, October 18, 1869, the daughter of the late Captain James Smith and Mary Ann Underwood and was educated in the public schools here. About the year 1888 she and William H. Bush were married. There were no children born to this union. Mrs. Bush had been a member of the First Baptist Church for more than sixty years and was an interested member of the Ladies Sewing Circle and the Ladies Missionary Society. She was the last of the Smith family and is survived by numerous nieces and nephews. The funeral service was held at the First Baptist Church Monday afternoon at two o’clock. The officiating clergymen were Rev. I.H. Edwards, pastor; Rev. Bradby, Second Baptist Church, Detroit; Rev. Banks and Rev. Henry Talbot, all old friends of the deceased. The hymns were sung by the choir and during the service Mrs. Ralph McCurdy sang a solo. Burial was in Rose Hill Cemetery with four nephews acting as pallbearers, Roman McDowell, Philo Foster, John Foster and Dr. J.R. Lee. The out-of-town relatives attending funeral were Dr. and Mrs. J.R. Lee and Mrs. J.E. Murrell of Cleveland; Mrs. Chas. L. Jones of Toronto; Mrs. Louis Taylor and son Louis Jr. of Windsor; Mr. and Mrs. Philo Foster of Genevea, Ohio; Roman McDowell and Mrs. James Benson of Detroit and many others from the surrounding district.”\n\nGertrude’s brother Roman is the next child of James A. Smith and Mary Anne Underwood. He married Alice Christian, the daughter of Henry and Ann Christian, on May 18, 1889 in Amherstburg. Just a few years later, on April 6, 1894, The Amherstburg Echo wrote “J.H. Wright and Roman F. Smith left on Wednesday afternoon for Cleveland to take their positions as head stewards on the Wawatam and Mesaba.”\n\nAccording to Alice’s obituary from August 3, 1944 in The Amherstburg Echo she formerly lived in Anderdon and Amherstburg but passed away in Cleveland, Ohio. It also lists her surviving children which includes five daughters: Mrs. Marion Brodess, Mrs. Hazel Hickman, Mrs. Manola Langrum, Mrs. Vivian Parker of Cleveland and Mrs. Anne Benson of Detroit.” In addition to her daughters, Alice also had sons named Wilfred (m. Billie), and Roman Jr. According to Wilfred’s death record, he died on January 4, 1943 in Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 47. He was born September 27, 1895 in Amherstburg and worked as a caterer. His spouse’s name is listed as Wilma, but he was divorced.\n\nAlso found was a marriage record for Charles Smith, listed as the son of Alice Christian. This marriage record states that Charles Smith married Katherine Winters, the daughter of Joseph Winters and Grace Jacobs, on March 4, 1918 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. At the time, Charles worked as a clerk.\n\nThere was no other available information for Alice’s daughter Marion Brodess (also spelt Broadus) other than her being listed as one years old on the 1891 Census with her parents Roman and Alice. There are more details to share about her remaining siblings Hazel, Manola, Victoria, Anne, Wilfred and Roman. Hazel married Harry Hickman and the couple had a daughter named Alice who married Cleve Brooks. In the Plain Dealer Hazel is also listed as Hazel H. Green, meaning that she married more than once.\n\nHazel’s sister Manola was born on January 4, 1897 in Amherstburg and in the 1901 Census she is listed as living with her grandmother Anne Christian, in addition to Anne’s children Ellen, Ada, and Thomas. Manola’s obituary states that her married name was Langrum and further research reveals that her husband’s name was Dr. Edgar L. Langrum, the son of John E. Langrum and Mary Nash. At the time of Edgar’s passing on November 25, 1944, he was living in Los Angeles. His death record also states that he was a WWI veteran born on May 12, 1898 and was born in Crockett, Texas.\n\nThe next child of Alice Kelly and Roman Smith is Vivian. She married Augustus Parker who became a Chief Justice and even appeared in JET magazine. In the 1940 US Census, Vivian and Augustus are listed with their son Augustus Jr. In her obituary from December 1988, Vivian Smith Parker is listed as living in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nVivian’s sister Anne married James Benson on October 12, 1936 in Steuben, Indiana. According to their marriage record Anne was born on July 23, 1906 in Cleveland, Ohio and worked as a teacher, while James was born on June 16, 1900 in Bessemer, Alabama and was the son of James Benson and Mary Mason (some records say Mary Owens). Alice’s husband James worked as a Druggist at the time. This record also reveals that Alice’s father Roman worked as a Steward, while James Benson Sr. was a Contractor.\n\nGoing back to their father Roman Smith, he passed away on August 13, 1920 in Ashtabula, Ohio. This record also shares that he was a cook on a lake steamer for Pittsburgh S.S. Co. I could not find an obituary for Roman.\n\nNext is Roman’s brother Philo. On April 1, 1881, The Amherstburg Echo mentions his participation in the debate “That the gun is more useful to a community than the dog” as part of activities with The Amherstburg Literary Society. Philo Smith and George Monroe took the affirmative side and Jos. Green and John Monroe the negative. It was written that “The boys all did well in this, their first debate, discussing the question in a manner which would have been creditable to older persons. The judges decided in favour of the gun.”\n\nPhilo married Laura Alice Grinage/Grinaje, the daughter of William and Elizabeth Grinage, on March 28, 1895 in Amherstburg. An extensive writeup appeared in The Amherstburg Echo on April 20, 1934, following Philo’s passing. His obituary says “‘Burg Native Dies in Pennsylvania City – Many old residents attended the funeral Thursday of last week and accompanied the remains to Rose Hill cemetery, of Philo Smith, who died the Monday before at Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Mr. Smith, it will be remembered, was a son of the late Captain James Smith and his wife Mary A. Underwood, the family home being at the corner of King and Simcoe Streets, Amherstburg. His remains were brought to Windsor in charge of his brother-in-law, H.C. Weeden, barrister, and the funeral took place from the home of the late Mrs. Mary E. McDowell, 511 Windsor Avenue. Rev. Edwards officiating. Burial was in Rose Hill cemetery, Amherstburg, by the side of his parents as was his dying wish. The pallbearers were four nephews, B. A. McDowell, Roman McDowell, Shermon McDowell, of Windsor, and Roman Smith, of Cleveland. The Democrat Messenger, published at Waynesburg, Green County, Pennsylvania, has this to say of the deceased, under the heading, “Death Takes Retired Lake Ship Steward: Philo Smith, aged 63, one of the most prominent and highly respected colored residents of Waynesburg, died at five o’clock yesterday morning, April 9th, 1934, in the Greene County Memorial hospital. Death was due to a complication of ailments. Mr. Smith was a native of Canada, having been born in Amherstburg, Ontario, but had been a resident of Waynesburg for about 25 years. He was a retired ship steward, having been employed by the Pittsburgh Steel Company on freighters plying the Great Lakes for several years. His father, Captain James Smith, was employed on Great Lakes steamers for a period of 50 years, and his grandfather Underwood was connected with the famous ‘Underground Railroad’ which helped southern slaves escape to the north. His mother was Mary Smith who has been dead several years. His wife, Alice Grinage Smith, died September 10, 1933. He is survived by two sisters, Mrs. H.C. Weeden, of Louisville, Ky., and Mrs. Gertrude Bush, of Amherstburg, Canada. Funeral services will be held Tuesday evening at seven o’clock at the Hoge & Garrison funeral home. East High Street, with Rev. G.B. Duff, pastor of the Bethel A.M.E. Church, in charge. The body will be shipped Wednesday morning to Ontario, Canada, for interment.”\n\nWhat we publish is not a complete history of any family and is based on the documents that are available. We welcome photos and information to fill in the gaps. See you next week for part 5.\n\nThe Smith Family History Part 5 – Weeden’s History\n\nThe last child of James A. Smith and Mary Ann Underwood is Annie. She married Henry Clay Weeden. An entry about Annie’s husband, Henry Clay Weeden, from the Encyclopedia of Louisville, reveals that “In 1901 he married Anna Marshall Smith, a black Canadian whose grandparents had been active in the UNDERGROUND RAILROAD in Ontario. Following her death, she was recognized as a prominent black poet. They had three children and lived at 816 Hancock St. Weeden is buried in the Louisville Cemetery.” As mentioned, they had three children and I was able to identify two, Mary and Philo. Mary Gertrude Weeden was born on January 8, 1912 in Jefferson, Kentucky. Her death record reveals her married name Slater, but she was divorced at that time. Her death record also shares that she passed on August 25, 1996 in Cleveland, Ohio and that she passed at the age of 84.\n\nMary Gertrude’s brother Philo, as mentioned, passed away at a young age. His death record states that he passed on June 3, 1923 in Louisville, Kentucky at the age of 17. I could not identify the last child of Annie and Henry that passed away, but one record states that this child passed at the age of 12.\n\nAnnie’s husband Henry Clay Weeden was described in a March 15, 1929 article from The Amherstburg Echo which wrote “H.C. Weeden, prominent attorney and counsellor-at-law, of Louisville, Kentucky, was a week end guest with Mr. and Mrs. W.H. Bush, Sandwich street. Mr. Weeden is also identified with the ministry and though not pastoring now he is general secretary-auditor of the A.M.E. Zion connection, which represents half a million communicants. Mrs. Weeden, a sister of Mrs. Bush was Miss Annie Smith, and prior to her marriage taught school in this district and in the southland.”\n\nHenry Clay Weeden was quite well known in Louisville, Kentucky. According to the Notable Kentucky African Americans Database, Henry was born enslaved in LaGrange, Kentucky and has several impressive accomplishments. He wrote Weeden’s History of the Colored People in Louisville which was published in 1897 and can be read here https://archive.org/details/weedenshistoryof00weed/page/n3/mode/2up?view=theater . On page 5 is a section called ‘Our Compiler’ which includes a biography of Weeden and was written by Joseph S. Cotter. It says “Mr. Henry Clay Weeden was born in Oldham county, Kentucky. Dr. Givens and wife taught him to read and write before entering the LaGrange public schools, presided over by the Rev. E.P. Marrs. He came to Louisville at an early age and entered the old school at Fourteenth and Broadway, afterwards attending the city schools, passing through them he entered the services of Dr. Stuart Robinson and Col. Bennett H. Young. He continued his studies under these distinguished gentlemen, especially those in languages, and Latin under Col. Bennett H. Young of whom he is a protégé. He then became sub-publisher of the Christian Index, under the late Bishop Miles, keeping the books and looking after nearly 1800 subscribers. After this he became editor of Zion’s Banner, having the distinction of being the youngest editor in the world. His editorials were copied and commented upon by so able a paper as the New York Independent. This was, indeed, an honor. Since then he has been connected with several papers as correspondent and on the editorial staff. He has represented local dailies, being the only colored man in the city holding a certificate from same. During the G.A.R. Encampment, 1895, he was special reporter, and was allowed to go through all lines and enter all places in search of news. In 1881, as associate special reporter to Mr. Joseph Ekin (now of the New York World) to reported the proceedings of the great educational convention which met at Lexington.”\n\n“As a church worker Mr. Weeden has rendered great services. He was superintendent of Sabbath Schools twelve years, and for twelve consecutive years was made delegate to Annual Conferences of Zion Church. Twice has he been a member of General Conferences, and appointed to represent his Church at the Ecumenical Conference at Baltimore, and assigned to read a paper on ‘Missions.’”\n\n“As a politician Mr. Weeden stands high. He is a good speaker and an able organizer. He was a member of the National Republican League of the United States, which met in Buffalo, New York, September, 1892, elected from State at large. By support of the New Jersey delegation he was elected secretary of one of the leading committees. He held a high position in the postal service. During General Harrison’s term of office, he held the highest office of any colored man in this district, and as a guager he distinguished himself. Mr. Riley, chief deputy under Colonel Scott, said of him: ‘Mr. Weeden is the only colored guager in the United States.’ So able was he along this line the special agents recommended him to the Department at Washington in glowing terms. He has been a delegate to Republican conventions for ten years, and a member of the City and County Committee for eight years. In 1892 he was elected secretary of the Fifth District Republican Convention, being the first colored man so honored. He has been identified with every movement for the advancement of his people.”\n\nThe biography continues by saying “He is a Knight Templar and Thirty-second degree Mason. Recently, the Zion Church honored him by making him trustee of Atkinson College, Madisonville, Ky. He is still actively engaged in newspaper work, being on the staff of the Star of Zion, the connectional paper which speaks to 450,000 people. Besides this he does special work for the dailies. For nearly two years he has been connected with J.P. Simmons as local and traveling salesman. No young man among us is better known for uprightness of living and devotion to duty than he. His qualities are such that many older men would do well to copy them. I have known him for years, and the better I know him the better I like him. So far, he has made an heroic effort to be of service to his fellow-men, and by so doing has won a host of friends. So well has he improved the past that if the future has not in store for him many good things it will do him a great wrong.”\n\nHenry Clay Weeden is also mentioned many times in the press, including an article about his political career from the Hopkinsville Kentuckian from November 15, 1895 titled ‘They Want to ‘Domernate.’ It says “It is said that H.C. Weeden, the colored man from this city who is seeking the chief deputyship in the land office, will receive the solid support of every colored voter in Louisville, and that his claims will be urged with a persistence that will not bear refusal. The colored Republicans will hold a mass meeting at Thirteenth and Walnut streets Thursday night at which it is expected that Weeden’s candidacy will be indorsed. The meeting is said to have been called for the purpose of discussing how much and what particular slices of ‘pie’ should come to the colored Republicans of Louisville, and it is probable that candidates will be put in the field for a number of places.”\n\nIt does not appear that Weeden gained enough votes for the deputyship because a few months later (February 7, 1896) The Courier Journal printed that he was applying for a clerkship in the City Hall. The article ‘Weeden Thinks a Clerkship On One of the Executive Boards Would Suit Him. H.C. Weeden, colored, who organized the colored Republican forces during the last campaign, is an applicant for a clerkship in the City Hall under the new Administration. He has the indorsement of a large number of white Republicans, as well as the solid support of the colored contingent, and declares that if he does not get a place and a good one, something will drop in November. Weeden was a gauger under Collector Scott. He thinks a clerkship in either one of the executive boards would be about his size, and intends to have it or know the reason why.”\n\nH.C. Weeden was very active politically as was recorded in The Courier Journal on February 29, 1896 which says “A movement is on foot among the colored Republicans of this city which if carried out successfully may throw cold water on the Bradley presidential boom. They are quietly organizing by wards and precincts, with the intention of capturing the primary conventions at which delegates to the district and State conventions are to be selected, and declare that they will allow no Bradly men to be chosen. The movement is led by H.C. Weeden and others. Weeden organized the negroes for Bradley last year, but is opposed to Gov. Bradley for any place that he may seek in future. The colored troops are mad because they fought nobly and got nothing – not even a crumb from the pie counter. They find that they are even unable to get any preferment from the Louisville Republicans, and it is finally dawning upon them that they are wanted only for their votes. H.C. Weeden, who is a candidate for delegate to the National Convention from the State-at large, said yesterday that not only he, but nine-tenths of the colored Republicans of the city are aggrieved because the Republicans have failed to redeem their ante-election promises. “If they do not do something for the negroes and the negro race their goose is cooked,’ said Weeden. ‘The negroes supported them this year under pressure, and they promised us not only place and power, but a repeal of the Separate Coach Bill. We get nothing, not even consideration. We all understand Gov. Bradley’s bluff about the appointment of Postell at Hopkinsville. He knew that Postell’s appointment would not be confirmed when it was made, but he thought it would satisfy the negroes. If he was in earnest about giving the place to a colored man, why didn’t he nominate another, and another, if necessary? Why didn’t he act like Cleveland did about Hornblower? Just because he wasn’t in earnest; he didn’t intend that a colored man should have the place. There are 9,000 colored men in this city who voted the Republican ticket last fall. In some wards we will elect our own delegates. In those wards where the white Republicans predominate, we shall demand of them representation in proportion to the number of votes we cast. This will give us ninety votes in Louisville, and you may rest assured that Gov. Bradley will not get them.”\n\nA few years later, Weeden appears in a writeup in the St. Louis Palladium on May 14, 1904 which says “Rev. H.C. Weeden, A.M., at one time the most prominent layman in the west. Edited and published Zion’s Banner, the first church paper of the A.M.E. Zion denomination. Gave the church great prominence through the local dailies. He is now stationed at Springfield, where Zion in this part of Kentucky has been given an impetus along all lines under his administration. Rev. Weeden is prominent in politics, being held in high esteem by the leaders of the republican party. Through his efforts Dr. E.E. Underwood was made delegate-at-large to represent Kentucky in the national republican convention. Rev. Weeden is a very fluent speaker.”\n\nThe Courier Journal also mentions on September 12, 1927 that Weeden was the treasurer for the Lincoln Bar Association which gathered and “Advice to members of the race, furtherance of justice and upholding of legal ethics were named as the objects of the association.”\n\nHenry Clay Weeden passed away on October 8, 1937. His death record lists him as widowed and a preacher. Surprisingly, for someone who was mentioned often in the press, I could not find an obituary for him. I was able to find an obituary for his wife Annie which appeared in The Amherstburg Echo on December 21, 1934. It says “Following a long illness, Mrs. H.C. Weeden died in Louisville, Ky., Thursday night, December 14th. Born in Amherstburg in 1870, Mrs. Weeden was Annie, the youngest of the 12 children of the late Capt. James A. and Mary Underwood Smith. She was educated in Amherstburg, spent her girlhood here, and taught a school term in S.S. No. 1, Anderdon. Forty years ago she accepted a school in Shelbyville, Ky., and a few years later she married H.C. Weeden, attorney-at-law, of Louisville, Ky., who survives her with one daughter, Mary Gertrude. One son died in early manhood, and another at the age of 12. She also leaves behind one sister, Mrs. W.H. Bush, of Amherstburg, who is now the sole survivor of this well known family. Funeral services were held in Louisville Sunday afternoon.”\n\nWhat we publish is not a complete history of any family and is based on the documents that are available. We welcome photos and information to fill in the gaps. See you next week where we will celebrate another amazing family."
