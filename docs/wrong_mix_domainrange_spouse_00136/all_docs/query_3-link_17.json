The comprehensive primary care at the Midtown resident clinic is also impressive, but what made Rainbow rise to the top of my list was how well the program supports its residents through the ups and downs of life. The structure of the program and the wonderful people in charge here do a really good job of promoting balance in all things.\n\nCarolyn Vekstein, MD\n\nHometown: Cleveland, OH\n\nUndergrad: Brown University\n\nMedical School: Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine\n\nProfessional Interests: Undecided, but potentially hospitalist medicine, medical education, advocacy, patient and peer wellness & mental health\n\nPersonal Interests: Cooking/baking, exercise (running, yoga, spinning), reading, spending time with my husband, our dog, and family/friends!\n\nWhy I Chose Rainbow: I fell in love with Rainbow when I rotated as a medical student.

The PD’s experience-based discussion of concrete changes the program has taken to improve resident wellness in recent years (no intern call, X+Y schedule) and convincing understanding of the psychology behind resident wellness displayed on interview day was also meaningful. Other aspects of Rainbow I loved were medium program size, institutional dedication to family-centered care, Angie’s Garden (rooftop oasis), additional week of vacation at the end of intern year, and the program coordinators’ warm hospitality.
