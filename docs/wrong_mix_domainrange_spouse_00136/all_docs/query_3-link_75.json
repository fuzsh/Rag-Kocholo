        "text": "2023 Inductee\n\nAdolphine Fletcher Terry was a civic-minded woman from a prominent Little Rock (Pulaski County) family who used her position to improve schools and libraries, start a juvenile court system, provide affordable housing, promote the education of women and women’s rights, and challenge the racism of the Old South. Terry pushed for social change in the early years of the civil rights movement and may best be known as the leader of the Women’s Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools (WEC).\n\nAdolphine Fletcher was born on November 3, 1882, in Little Rock to John Gould Fletcher and Adolphine Krause Fletcher. Her father worked in the cotton business and in banking and served terms as sheriff of Pulaski County and city mayor. She was the oldest of three children. Pulitzer Prize–winning poet John Gould Fletcher Jr. was her younger brother.\n\nWith her mother’s encouragement, Fletcher enrolled in Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, when she was fifteen. Her East Coast education and schoolmates broadened her views on race relations. She graduated in 1902, at a time when few men and even fewer women had college degrees.\n\nFletcher’s father died in 1906, and her mother died three years later.\n\nAfter college, Fletcher and another Vassar graduate from Arkansas, Blanche Martin, were asked to serve on a national committee to investigate the state’s educational needs. They discovered a system of mostly one-room schoolhouses among 5,000 school districts, inadequate supervision, and no consistent policies. The two made school consolidation their cause, writing articles for newspapers, making speeches, and lobbying. In 1908, Fletcher was leading efforts to consolidate school districts, appoint professional county superintendents, and provide school transportation in rural Arkansas.\n\nAs a young college graduate, Fletcher also co-founded a group to encourage women to become college educated. The group eventually became the Little Rock branch of the American Association of University Women. She also formed the first School Improvement Association in Arkansas, forerunner of the Parent Teacher Association; organized the first juvenile court in Arkansas in 1910; and chaired the Pulaski County Juvenile Court board for about twenty years. She helped start the Girls Industrial School near Alexander (Pulaski and Saline Counties) for girls detained by the court, as well as a temporary home for young people who had no adult supervision.\n\nOn July 7, 1910, Fletcher married Little Rock native and lawyer David D. Terry. The couple had four children: David, Mary, Sarah, and William.\n\nMary Terry was born in 1914 with a rare condition, called osteogenesis imperfecta, that caused her bones to break for no apparent reason. The condition crippled Mary for life and had a significant impact on her mother. Despite doctors’ predictions, Mary lived a long life, earned a college degree, traveled, and had a career in psychological testing. Terry said caring for Mary led to an awakening in which she found “in some measure the spiritual meaning of life, a sense of real achievement and peace.”\n\nTerry and her husband adopted a fifth child, Joseph, an orphan whom Mary befriended when she was in Boston for medical treatment.\n\nHer daughter’s illness and her own coming to terms with Mary’s condition formed the basis for Terry’s first book, Courage! (1938). The book was written under the pseudonym Mary Lindsey. Her other books include Cordelia, Member of the Household (1967), about a young African-American girl who lived with the Fletcher family when Terry was a child; Charlotte Stephens, Little Rock’s First Black Teacher (1973); and her unpublished autobiography, Life is My Song, Also (1973–1974).\n\nWhile her husband served in the army during World War I, Terry continued to put her energy behind social and political causes. Shortly after the war, she was one of three white women to act as an adviser to the newly established black Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA). While her sister Mary was a leading local suffragette, Terry also marched for voting rights for women in 1920. “To me, the vote represents more than just saying how a person feels about an issue or a candidate,” she said. “It represents human dignity and the fact that a citizen can express his or her opinion on any subject without fear of reprisal. That, I think, is what real human dignity consists of.”\n\nTerry’s husband served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1933 to 1942. During her husband’s early years in Washington DC, Terry remained in Little Rock to raise their children and head an American Legion auxiliary committee that secured federal funds to pay the salaries of librarians in Arkansas. As part of that arrangement, she and the committee collected books and found the space to open free libraries throughout the state. The committee also convinced the Arkansas legislature to create a state library program. In Little Rock, Terry was a trustee of the city public library for about forty years, retiring in 1966. She recalled, in an interview a few years before her death, that she worked quietly to open the library to black adults in the 1950s and then to black children.\n\nAlso in the 1930s, Terry and others formed the Little Rock Housing Association to secure federal funds under the 1937 Housing Authority Act to combat slum housing. She later organized a group of women who spoke on radio programs and before civic groups about the importance of low-rent housing and slum clearance. During this time, she was also active in the Arkansas chapter of the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.\n\nIn the fall of 1957, when Terry learned that Governor Orval Faubus had used troops to prevent black students from attending Central High School during the Little Rock desegregation crisis and that a white mob had terrorized the students, she wrote: “For days, I walked about unable to concentrate on anything, except the fact that we had been disgraced by a group of poor whites and a portion of the lunatic fringe…. Where had the better class been while this was being concocted? Shame on us.”\n\nTerry and two friends, Vivion Brewer of Scott (Pulaski and Lonoke Counties) and Velma Powell of Little Rock, formed the Women’s Emergency Committee (WEC) after a ballot measure to close Little Rock’s high schools, as a means of avoiding desegregation, passed in 1958. They became the first organized group of white moderates to oppose the governor and demand the reopening of the city’s four public high schools.\n\nIn the months following its formation, the WEC worked to persuade the public to reopen the schools. In May 1959, the WEC, black voters, and a group called Stop This Outrageous Purge campaigned successfully to recall three school board members who were segregationists. The recall election was the first full-scale loss for Faubus and the segregationists. The WEC efforts, including a study documenting the negative effect the school crisis was having on Little Rock’s economy, altered the course of public action and helped reopen the schools in 1959.\n\nIn other efforts, Terry was instrumental in starting the Pulaski County Tuberculosis Association and the Community Chest, the forerunner of the United Way. She was active in historic preservation and the arts. In later years, she worked to make the city auditorium accessible to older people and the handicapped.\n\nTerry had a stroke sometime after her ninetieth birthday, and her health declined. Her family moved her to a nursing home from the antebellum mansion the Pike-Fletcher-Terry House, which was built by Albert Pike, where she had lived since she was a child. She died on July 25, 1976, in the nursing home at age ninety-three. She is buried in Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock.\n\nTerry and her sister, Mary Fletcher Drennan, willed the family mansion to the city of Little Rock, and it became the Decorative Arts Museum of the Arkansas Arts Center (now the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts). In the fall of 2004, the former Decorative Arts Museum was renamed the Arkansas Arts Center Terry House Community Gallery and reopened as a space for collaborative exhibitions and programs with arts and non-profit agencies. The Adolphine Fletcher Terry Library of the Central Arkansas Library System is named for her.\n\nPeggy Harris\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas\n\nThis entry, originally published in Arkansas Biography: A Collection of Notable Lives, appears in the CALS Encyclopedia of Arkansas in an altered form.

This year, she will enter her fiftieth year in banking. She was fresh out of college when the bank president died suddenly, and she was asked to take on the role of running the bank, where she had spent summers and holidays working. She officially began her career in the summer of 1974, although her memories of the bank go back to the day the First State Bank of Sherwood opened its doors in 1967.\n\nAs the daughter of the bank’s founder, there were questions from the moment she initially walked through the door about how she got the job, and whether or not she belonged there. She knew she had two options. She could quit, walk out, and prove her critics right, or stay, work hard, and prove them wrong. She chose the latter option, and she will tell you that this decision she made when she was sixteen years old changed the trajectory of her life, and has led her to the most rewarding career she could have imagined.\n\nCathy earned her BSBA in Finance and Banking from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and her Graduate Banking Degree from the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking, at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX. She is also honored to be a National Security Forum Air War College Alumnae, Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nNot long ago, Cathy was one of very few women in a banking leadership role, and often the only female in the room. She is the only female to chair the Arkansas Bankers Association in its 132-year history. She currently serves on the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee of the American Bankers Association, the largest financial trade association in the United States. She also chairs its Government Relations Committee, which is the American Bankers Association’s leadership council, and chairs its Professional Development Committee.\n\nShe also sits on the Board of Hastings Holding Company and oversees the management of One Financial Centre.\n\nIn 2022, Cathy was named One of the Most Powerful Women in Banking to Watch, by American Banker, New York. In 2019, she was knighted into the Knights of Saint Martin, in Rome, Italy, into the Order of San Martino of the Mount of Beatitudes, which is a knighthood sanctioned by the Pope in recognition of and focused on promoting equality and service to those less fortunate. This same year, she was the recipient of the Sandra Wilson Cherry Award, in recognition of leadership and exemplary community service.\n\nCathy has served on and chaired many community and charitable boards and committees. She is currently the Immediate Past Chair of the Baptist Health Foundation Board, a member of the Arkansas Bankers Association Government Relations Committee, Fifty for the Future Board, Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum Foundation Board, North Little Rock Chamber of Commerce Board, and is a member of the Arkansas International Women’s Forum. Highlights of her previous leadership roles and volunteer activities include the Arkansas Arts Center, Fine Arts Club of Arkansas, Junior League of Little Rock, Mount Saint Mary’s Academy, Arkansas State Fair, Little Rock Marathon, Girl Scouts, Pi Beta Phi Sorority, and the Little Rock Air Force Base.\n\nShe is especially proud of the work she and a small group of men did to save the USS Hoga (a towboat best known for her actions during WWII during the attack on Pearl Harbor) and bring her to her resting place in North Little Rock.\n\nCathy is also a proud daughter, wife, mother, and grandmother.\n\n2023 Inductee\n\nDorothy McFadden Hoover was an accomplished aeronautical research scientist who was born in Hope, Arkansas in 1918. One of her greatest achievements was her contribution to the development of the “thin sweptback tapered wing,” which became the aviation industry standard and transformed air travel in the 20th century. Her life story was essentially unknown until she was briefly mentioned in the highly acclaimed book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race by Margot Lee Shetterly. Shetterly described Hoover as “exceptionally fluent in abstract mathematical concepts and complex equations.”\n\nDorothy Estheryne McFadden was the youngest of four children born to William McFadden and Elizabeth Wilburn McFadden. She graduated from Henry Clay Yerger High School in Hope in 1934 at the age of fifteen. McFadden entered Arkansas AM&N, now the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, as a sixteen-year-old in 1934 and graduated in 1938 with a BS in mathematics.\n\nAfter teaching high school for several years, Dorothy earned an MS in mathematics from Atlanta University (now Clark Atlanta University), the first institution in the country to award graduate degrees to African Americans. Her thesis, “Some Projectile Transformations and Their Applications,” prepared her for her future work in aeronautics.\n\nDorothy was one of the first of six African American women hired by Langley Labs, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, later NASA). Her graduate-level work helped set her apart from her peers, and she was given rigorous mathematical assignments from Langley engineer R. T. Jones, the premier aeronautical engineer of the twentieth century. In 1946 Jones selected Dorothy to be his personal mathematician. She was the first of the Black human computers to work directly with an engineer and she thrived in this highly competitive environment.\n\nIn late 1946 Dorothy began working with R.T. Jones’ successor, Frank S. Malvestuto Jr., a brilliant engineer and prolific researcher. By 1951, she had earned the title of Aeronautical Research Scientist. That same year, she was listed as co-author with Malvestuto on two significant research publications addressing “thin sweptback tapered wings” on aircraft. Being listed as a co-author was a landmark accomplishment. She was the first African American woman to be listed on a Langley engineering report.\n\nIn 1952, Dorothy’s marriage to Ricardo Hoover ended, and she temporarily left the world of engineering to pursue her interests in theoretical mathematics, earning an MA in physics at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. She was the first woman, of any race, to earn a master’s in physics from UA. A portion of her 1954 master’s thesis, “Estimates of Error in Numerical Integration,” was included in the Journal of the Arkansas Academy of Science the following year.\n\nHoover returned to the Washington DC area, where she served in a variety of government positions. In 1959 Hoover joined a small group of highly skilled mathematicians in the theoretical division of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, combining her work in physics with her mathematical prowess and contributing valuable information that promoted America’s success in the space race.\n\nDorothy McFadden Hoover’s tenacity in her pursuit of advanced degrees in mathematics and physics blazed a trail for all women, and especially for women of color. In addition, she broke the “glass ceiling” several times in her professional life, coauthoring papers with white male scientists at NACA and achieving a number of “firsts” in both academics and in government service. Ms. Hoover’s success was stunning given the many obstacles of the Jim Crow South, coupled with the fact that she was a woman in a male-dominated profession.\n\nWhile continuing her mathematics research in Goddard’s Theoretical Division, Hoover began writing a book, A Layman Looks with Love at Her Church, a history of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. Hoover was a member of the Campbell AME Church located in the Anacostia Historic District in southeast Washington, D.C. The book was published in 1970.\n\nDorothy McFadden Hoover died in 2000 in Washington DC.\n\n2023 Inductee\n\nJoyce Elise Williams Warren is Arkansas’ first Black female judge, the first Black person ever elected to an Arkansas state-level trial court judgeship, the first Black female graduate of the UALR William H. Bowen School of Law, the first Black law clerk for the Arkansas Supreme Court, the first Black female appointee and first Black Chairperson to serve on the Arkansas State Board of Law Examiners, the first Black female appointee and first Black female to serve as Chairperson on the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission, the first Black person to be elected to the Arkansas Judicial Council Board of Directors, the first Black President of the Arkansas Judicial Council, and the first Black person to receive the “Outstanding Jurist Award” from the Arkansas Bar Association and the Arkansas Bar Foundation. She was only 11 years old when she and nine other Black students were the first to integrate West Side Junior High School in Little Rock. Although she has blazed many trails, most of those accomplishments were made without her knowledge that she would be a “first.”\n\nWarren is most often credited with her dedicated and tireless work as a juvenile judge who formed, joined, and led collaborative efforts—both on and off the bench—to improve the lives of Arkansas’ children and families. Her contributions helped create a new Arkansas juvenile justice system, adopt improvements to adoption laws, create standards for attorneys who represent children and parents in child abuse and neglect cases, establish accountability for those who provide or should provide services to children in need, and protect those children in correctional facilities and/or medical facilities.\n\nShe was born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas on October 25, 1949 and grew up in Little Rock. Her parents, both of whom were teachers, divorced when she and her sister, Janice, were very young. She developed her interest in helping children and families because she was surrounded by her mother, maternal grandmother, and two maternal aunts—all of whom were public school teachers. She witnessed these closely-knit family members devoting their time and resources to help provide for the needs of children 1 and families in their classrooms and in the community. She attended public schools in Little Rock, breaking the color barrier when she was one of ten Black students who integrated West Side Junior High School—just four years after the Little Rock Nine integrated Central High School. She graduated from Central High School in 1967, and attended both Rockford College (now Rockford University) in Rockford, Illinois and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Anthropology. She began attending law school part-time at night. She married James in 1972, and they had two sons, Jonathan and Jamie, while she was still in law school. She earned her law degree from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Law (now UALR William H. Bowen School of Law) in 1976—becoming the law school’s first Black female graduate. Warren continued her legal and judicial education after she became a judge, and earned a Diploma of Judicial Skills from the American Academy of Judicial Education in 2001.\n\nWarren’s first job after law school started in January 1977, when she became a law clerk for Arkansas Supreme Court Associate Justice Darrell Hickman—thus earning her the distinction of becoming the first Black person to serve as a law clerk for the State’s highest court. Her next job was as an assistant attorney general for Bill Clinton. In January 1979, when Clinton took office in his first term as Governor, she worked as one of his administrative assistants until November 1979. She was an in-house legal advisor for the Arkansas Department of Health from November 1979 until February 1981. She had a brief family law practice, and then worked as a staff attorney for Central Arkansas Legal Services from January to December 1982. In January 1983, Pulaski County Judge Don Venhaus appointed her as Pulaski County Juvenile Court Judge—making her the first Black female judge in Arkansas. She served in that capacity until January 20, 1987, when the Arkansas Supreme Court declared the county juvenile court system unconstitutional. Shortly after that court decision, Governor Clinton appointed her to serve on the newly created Arkansas Juvenile Justice Commission, which was tasked with making recommendations for the creation of a new juvenile court system. During the period of the Commission’s existence, she and James had their last child, Justin. Also, in that same time frame, she served briefly as a special 2 master hearing juvenile cases for the Sixth Judicial District Circuit and Probate (Chancery) Judges, and was later appointed by Venhaus to serve as Pulaski County Paternity Judge, holding that office from July 1987 until April 26, 1989.\n\nIn March 1989, the Arkansas Legislature created 17 new circuit-chancery judgeships to hear juvenile matters—with only one of those designated for the Sixth Judicial District (Pulaski and Perry Counties). Governor Clinton appointed Warren to that sole position, which she held from August 1, 1989 until her term ended on December 31, 1990. In November 1989, the Legislature created a second juvenile judgeship in the Sixth Judicial District. Warren was elected, without opposition, to that judgeship in November 1990—again making history by becoming the first Black person ever elected to a state-level trial court judgeship in Arkansas. After that election, she was elected five more times—with no opponents—and continued hearing juvenile cases on the juvenile division bench until she retired on December 31, 2020, after serving the public for over 31 years on the state bench, and 6 years on the county bench.\n\nOver her lengthy career as a public servant, Warren presided over a caseload which mostly involved juvenile cases. She heard thousands of cases and saw children and families with a myriad of problems, such as poverty, neglect, educational deficits, sexual abuse, physical abuse, trauma, mental illness, and drug abuse. Juvenile court is a problem-solving court, which can be rewarding—but more often emotionally and physically draining; however, as difficult as most days were, Warren loved her work. Her passion for justice and fairness fueled her efforts to help improve the systems that touched children and families to help solve or prevent their problems. She set a high standard of excellence for herself and others. She credits God for giving her the strength and courage to forge ahead, and James for guiding her career and being her biggest “cheerleader.”\n\nShe has served in multiple positions to gain knowledge, advocate for reform, and challenge laws to improve systems that serve children and families in need. She was Chairperson of the Arkansas Governor’s Children’s Council, which was established after 3 a lawsuit was filed over the condition of the State’s child welfare system, and charged to oversee reforms being made in the child welfare system. She served for many years as Chairperson of the Supreme Court Ad Hoc Committee on Foster Care and Adoption. She was a member of the Governor’s Working Group on Juvenile Justice, which was created in response to the tragic school shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. She helped establish 10th Division Circuit Court as a Pilot Court for a Dependency-Neglect Mediation Project in Arkansas. She was Chairperson of the Arkansas Children’s Behavioral Health Care Commission.\n\nShe helped implement and presided over the Arkansas Pilot Court Team for Safe Babies, which is based on the science of babies’ brain development. Safe Babies Court Team (SBCT) is a systems-change initiative focused on improving how courts, child welfare agencies, and related child-serving organizations work together, share information, and expedite services for young children.\n\n10th Division Circuit Court was selected as one of eight (8) courts across the Nation to be a part of a new Implementation Sites Project, which involved the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges (NCJFCJ) providing training to courts seeking to implement principles and practices to improve outcomes for abused and neglected children and their families.\n\nIn October 2000, Warren wrote A Booklet for Parents, Guardians, and Custodians in Abuse and Neglect Cases, which has been printed and updated in English and Spanish and distributed throughout Arkansas and other states.\n\nShe is humbled by and grateful for the numerous honors, awards, and recognitions she has received. In 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, Arkansas Business selected her as one of the “Top 100 Women in Arkansas.” She was named National CASA Judge of the Year in 2012. In that same year, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette online edition named her as one of the “10 Most Influential Blacks in Arkansas.” In 2018, the Pulaski County Bar Association chose her as one of its “Arkansas Legal Pioneers and Living Legends.” 4 Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families chose her as one of the “2020 Friends of Children Honorees.” The Arkansas Bar Association and the Arkansas Bar Foundation chose her to receive the 2021 ‘“Outstanding Jurist Award.” In that same year, she received the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen “Distinguished Alumni Award.” Since 2012, she has been listed in the Central Arkansas Library System Encyclopedia of Arkansas.\n\nEven in her retirement, she continues to work to improve the lives of children and families. As a Judicial Consultant for ZERO TO THREE, she serves as an advisor to the Infant Toddler Court Program (ITCP), assists in supporting the implementation of the Safe Babies Court Team (SBCT) approach in new states and sites, and provides training as needed. She is a member of the Arkansas Safe Babies Court Team (SBCT) State Advisory Committee, and serves on the boards of the Arkansas Judges and Lawyers Assistance Program (JLAP) Foundation, the Arkansas Commission for Parent Counsel, and the Interfaith Center of Arkansas. She is a member of St. Margaret’s Episcopal Church, where she serves on the Vestry.\n\nAs she always did, Warren still makes her own family her top priority. She and James (now married over 51 years) are proud of their three sons, Jonathan, Jamie, and Justin, their respective wives, Courtney, Kassie, and Heather---and even prouder of their 11 grandchildren.\n\n2023 Inductee\n\nPat Qualls was born May 13, 1940 and learned about demanding work helping out on the family cotton farm where she grew up in Northeast Arkansas. That farm work ethic helped her succeed as an all-state basketball player at Monette High School and also as a young pianist. After graduating from Arkansas State College with a bachelor’s degree in music education, Pat was hired in 1963 as the first music teacher in the Monette Public Schools. She later earned her master’s degree in music education at Arkansas State University. At Monette, she built a very successful and respected choral program. Unable to find a suitable music workbook for her 6th grade music classes, she wrote and published her own music workbook: “Learning to Read Music.” One year, she coached the Jr. and Sr. girls’ basketball programs while keeping her full music load. The Monette Lions Club honored Pat on her retirement after sixteen years of service at Monette Public Schools by dedicating to her their 14th annual Lions Club Horse Show. From 1976 – 1983, Pat also served as the part time music director at Monette First Baptist Church.\n\nPat then moved to Lake City where her late husband Bill Qualls was farming and opened a private music studio teaching piano, voice, and organ. Shortly after that Pat was elected as the mayor of Lake City, the first woman ever elected to municipal office in Craighead County. Lake City sits on the banks of the St. Francis River where flooding has always been a concern. One of Pat’s major accomplishments as mayor was to obtain Corp of Engineer’s funding for drainage improvements; she also expanded the sewer system. Pat was successful in getting a nursing home established in Lake City.\n\nIn 1983, during her second term as Lake City Mayor, Governor Bill Clinton appointed her to serve on the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC). After completing her first partial term, she was appointed to two more terms, serving a total of 14 years, longer than any other APSC Commissioner. Pat served on the National Association Regulatory Utility Commissions executive and electricity committees. She served as Vice President and President of the Mid-America Regulatory Commissions\n\nIn 1985, at the age of 45, Pat fulfilled a long-time dream of learning to play the harp. She played twice in the White House during President Clinton’s administration. She also directed the Immanuel Baptist Church Chancel Bells at a performance in the White House. The Chancel Bells also performed with the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra in three concerts.\n\nPat retired from state government and moved to Jonesboro in 2002. In that year she was inducted into the Arkansas Music Educators “Hall of Fame.” In 2003, she organized the first “Celebrity Bell Ringers” day; served on the Salvation Army Board and was named 2008 “Volunteer of the Year.” Pat felt led to teach a 16-year-old autistic girl to play the harp which led to a 2010 innovative music performance program for musicians with disabilities. It eventually grew into a unique program that included scholarships, private lessons, public performance, and concert tours. In 2019, for the 10th Annual program of “The Role of Music in the Lives of Special Needs Children and Adults”, there were over 75 performers who shared their talents with a near-capacity crowd in the ASU Fowler Center. This concert featured male & female soloists; male trio; male & female duet; pianist; violinist: harpist; native American flute player, trumpeter; the 40 voice “Overcomers Choir “organized by Pat, and a liturgical dance team traveling from Atlanta. A wide array of disabilities included: Autism, MS, Cerebral Palsy, Aspergers, Blindness, Down Syndrome and Deafness. For her work with special needs musicians, Pat was awarded the Jonesboro Exchange Club’s “Book of Golden Deeds” Award and the “Making a Difference” award by the Arkansas State University College of Nursing and Health Professions. She also received KAIT-TV/First Community Bank “Great Acts of Kindness Award.” Jonesboro Mayor Harold Perrin proclaimed “Pat Qualls Day” April 30, 2013. The Arkansas Arts Council awarded Pat with the “2021 Governor’s Arts Award for Community Service for over sixty years as an arts leader and advocate, as well as serving as an Arkansas Public Service Commissioner for 14 years and the mayor of Lake City for 4 years.\n\nOther honors received by Pat Qualls include being named among the 1965 & 1970 Outstanding Young Women of America, the 1973 Outstanding Secondary Educators of America, and the 1981 Personalities of the South. She was honored with the Monette PTA Life Membership Award. She served as Alpha Delta Kappa Treasurer and President. She received the Monette Fine Arts Council Award. She is an honorary member of the Monette 4H Club.

In cooperation with Dr. Dale Miller, ASU Choir Director, she organized three Christmas “Hallelujah” flash mob choirs at Jonesboro Turtle Creek Mall in 2012, 2013, and 2018. She has also served on three mission trips with Little Rock Immanuel Baptist Church from 1990-2001 where she helped with earthquake devastated Turkey. She taught women to sew to help them produce income. She also went on a mission trip to Russia directing a youth choir and visiting schools and orphan homes.\n\nPat recently moved to Conway to be near her only child, Bret Qualls, daughter-in-law Mary Etta, granddaughter Janna Salter; great granddaughters Maggie Erbach, Emma Fulmer, and grand dog Callie. She has already become involved in the Conway community by becoming a member of the Conway Symphony Orchestra Guild, P.E.O. and participating in the music ministry of First Presbyterian Church. She also serves as harp teacher to two adults.\n\n2020/2021/2022 Inductee\n\nAmy Rossi was born and raised in North Little Rock and attended parochial schools where one of her most meaningful leadership experiences was being elected to student body president at Mount St. Mary Academy, which set a course for a future in political involvement. Over her career, Rossi has worked closely with legislators and governors to draft laws to improve the lives of Arkansas’ children and families and is most often credited with helping the state adopt a program for uninsured children now called ARKids First.\n\nShe earned her undergraduate degree in sociology from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and her master’s in social work from the University of Tennessee. She began her career in direct services as director of a treatment facility for emotionally disturbed adolescents. During that time, she was also on the faculty of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock’s School of Social Work as an instructor for youth service workers.\n\nRossi spent 23 years at Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, a statewide nonprofit child advocacy organization, and 15 years as Executive Director, making her one of the state’s best resources on issues affecting children and families. In 2004, she joined the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement as associate director where she worked to prevent childhood obesity, improve child health services in the schools and advance a statewide system of health information exchange. Rossi spent the last five years of her career with AFMC as Vice President continuing to work to improve the quality of health care. She retired from there in 2015.\n\nFor more than 40 years, she has taken leadership roles on numerous government and private task forces, committees and commissions charged with improving services for children through public policies and programs. Her notable activities have included serving on the Governor’s Commission on Juvenile Justice, which designed a new juvenile court system for Arkansas; serving as special master in two class-action lawsuits against the state’s Department of Human Services regarding services to children in their custody; serving on the Governor’s Task Force on Youth Violence, a group of prominent leaders appointed to guide the state in the aftermath of the Jonesboro school shooting, and as a member of the Arkansas T.E.A. Program Advisory Council, which provided oversight to the state implementation of welfare reform.\n\nShe also served board terms on the Arkansas chapter of the National Conference for Community and Justice, served on the Executive Planning Committee for the Clinton School of Public Service, and was a founding board member and past president of the Arkansas Women’s Foundation. She also had a longtime involvement with the Arkansas Women’s Leadership Forum.

When first elected, she was one of only three women in the House and Senate. She has the distinction of the longest service in the Arkansas Legislature of any woman and any Republican. She also served as vice-chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party.\n\nDuring her 24 years of elected service, Rep. Pollan passed more than 250 pieces of legislation. She created The Children and Youth Committee to deal specifically with problems of children. The House speaker appointed her chairman, while the Senate appointed Sen. Max Howell as its Chairman. For eight terms she chaired the committee, which changed child welfare, child abuse, and at-risk youth laws and the court system for juveniles. She established and chaired the Arkansas Commission on Child Abuse, Rape and Domestic Abuse and moved child abuse reporting from the Department of Human Services to the State Police. From this commission came the Children’s Advocacy Centers of Arkansas and the use of multi-disciplinary teams to circle services around a child.\n\nPollan legislated major changes for teaching at-risk youth, and The Pygmalion Commission was created to help establish a nontraditional system for underachieving youth. Because of the lack of statistical information needed to make sound legislative changes, Rep. Pollan embarked on a 12-year research project of at-risk populations in Arkansas which culminated in her Ph.D. in Education from Walden University in 1993. She specialized in cognitive studies and assessment.\n\nRep. Pollan was appointed to regional and national leadership roles, serving as chairman of the Southern Regional Education Legislative Board; chairman of the Southern Legislative Council Education Committee; legislative representative to the NAEP Board for the nation’s school testing under U.S. Dept. of Education; National Literacy Survey Advisory Board with U.S. Dept. of Education; Workplace Literacy Project Advisory Board with U.S. Dept. of Labor; and Office of Technology Assessment of the Congress Advisory Board for the National Study of Computers in Education.\n\nAfter term-limiting from the legislature in 1999, Dr. Pollan became a senior staff member for three years for Gov.

Born with brown eyes, her family called her “Brownie,” and the nickname stuck. Her mother died in 1947, shortly followed by her father in 1950. Brownie and her siblings were then cared for by her relatives Grainger and Frances Williams, who moved into the Tall Timber Jersey Farm (the Williams family farm) with their children.\n\nBrownie graduated from Little Rock High School (later named Central High School). She then attended Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Ga, from 1950 to 1953 but felt she did not fit the image of Southern womanhood the school projected and did not finish her degree. On July 26, 1953, she married Calvin Reville Ledbetter, an attorney, and political science professor. Brownie and Cal moved to Germany, where he served with the U.S. Army for three years.\n\nWhile in Germany, Brownie heard about the desegregation crisis at Central High School. Her aunt signed her up for the Women's Emergency Committee to Save Our Schools (WEC), which supported the reopening of public schools. In 1963 Ledbetter began working with the Panel of American Women, a forum where women promoted religious and cultural diversity by sharing their own experiences. In 1981 the Panel became the Arkansas Public Policy Panel (APPP). Ledbetter served as Executive Director of the APPP until 1999 when she spearheaded the creation of the progressive Arkansas Citizens First Congress.\n\nIn 1983, Ledbetter founded the Arkansas Fairness Council, a coalition of 23 organizations representing labor, African Americans, teachers, environmental and church organizations, serving as president and chief lobbyist for 15 years. She also was a founding member of the Arkansas Women's Political Caucus, an organizing member of the ERA/Arkansas Coalition, founder and Executive Director of Arkansas Career Resources, Inc., State Director of the Southern Coalition for Educational Equity, legislative director of the State Federation of Business and Professional Women, and co-founder of the Women's Environment and Development Organization.\n\nLedbetter also worked behind the scenes on many state and national political campaigns. In 1967, she managed her husband's campaign for the Arkansas General Assembly and, in 1970, served as an organizer and consultant in Dale Bumpers’ run for governor. She ran the Arkansas McGovern for President Campaign and was a senior consultant to the Fulbright senatorial campaign in 1974. Ledbetter served as the first Political Action Chair of the National Women's Political Caucus in 1973 and was behind a successful statewide effort to support the appointment of the first African-American federal judge from Arkansas. She served on the State Democratic Central Committee from 1968 to 1974 and as Affirmative Action Committee Coordinator for the Arkansas Democratic Party from 1973 to 1974. Brownie helped organize the first Planned Parenthood affiliate and clinic in Arkansas in 1984 and led the effort to defeat the first statewide ballot initiative restricting access to birth control and abortion.\n\nThrough her service on the Women's Environmental and Development Organization (WEDO) and the National Congress of Neighborhood Women, she had the opportunity to work with women and minorities from across the world. Ledbetter participated as a nongovernmental delegate in several UN preparatory and commission meetings in New York, Rio, Cairo, Beijing, and Johannesburg.\n\nBrownie’s numerous awards and recognitions include the American Civil Liberties Union’s Civil Libertarian of the Year, the Mary Hatwood Futrell Award from the National Education Association, the Father Joe Biltz Award from the Just Communities for Central Arkansas, and the National Women's History Month Award. The Arkansas Public Policy Panel and the Arkansas Citizen's Congress created the “Brownie Ledbetter Dragonslayer Award” to recognize outstanding achievement in social justice. After retirement, she served on the national board of the Center for the Advancement of Women in New York City. She was also a founding member of the Women's Foundation of Arkansas.\n\nPhotos credited by CALS Butler Center\n\n2019 Inductee\n\nAs a journalist, she became the first female president of the National Newspaper Association and would eventually serve as president of seven different state and national journalism organizations. She was also the first female president of the Dumas Chamber of Commerce. She served as a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for 14 years,\n\nShe was born on Dec. 25, 1923, in Tillar, Ark., and at age 16, she enrolled in the University of Arkansas at Monticello, all while writing stories for The McGehee Times as a freelancer. She studied at Louisiana State University in 1942, majoring in sociology and journalism. Upon graduation in 1944, she became editor of The McGehee Times. She married Louisiana native Melvin Schexnayder in 1946 and they returned to graduate school at LSU. The couple worked for six years at The McGehee Times before purchasing the Dumas Clarion in 1954 and co-owned the newspaper for more than four decades.\n\nFrom her position, she took stands on larger issues such as supporting the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock and other economic and development issues in Dumas. In 1975, she was appointed by Gov. David Pryor to the Arkansas Board of Pardons and Parole and became the first woman to serve on the board.\n\nIn her journalism career, once she joined an organization, she was sure to be elected president. She became president of the Arkansas Press Women in 1955. She was the first woman elected to the Little Rock chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists and became its first female president in 1973. In 1977, she was elected president of the National Federation of Press Women. In 1981, she became the first female president of the Arkansas Press Association. In 1989, she was elected treasurer of the National Newspaper Association, and by 1991, she was its first female president.\n\nIn 1984, she ran unopposed for the state House of Representatives. In a famous anecdote about Schexnayder, a fellow legislator suggested during her first week in the house that she’d be fine if she sat and listened. She told him, “You obviously don’t know me very well. I’m not a side-line sitter, and I always have plans.” She served in the House until 1999. She was the lead sponsor of several bills enhancing the Freedom of Information Act; lead sponsor of a bill creating the Arkansas Ethics Commission and a bill creating sales tax for a research center and endowed chair at UAMS in alcohol abuse prevention.\n\nThe Schexnayders sold the Clarion in 1998 and established Dumas Community Fund which evolved into Delta Community Foundation. Melvin Schexnayder died in 2007. Though removed from journalism, she remained involved in civic life. In 2012, she published her memoir, The Salty Old Editor: An Adventure in Ink.\n\nMrs. Schexnayder’s family includes three children and spouses, John and Deanna Schexnayder of Austin, TX, Sarah and Mark Steen of Frisco, Texas, and Dr. Steve and Dr. Becky Schexnayder of Little Rock; 9 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.\n\n2017 Inductee\n\nBrinda Jackson was born in McGehee, Arkansas, a small rural town in Southeast Arkansas, and raised in an even smaller rural town, Montrose, Arkansas, population 399 (at that time). Her parents, William and Bernice Jackson, farmers in rural Arkansas, instilled unquestionable values, the importance of education, and a strong work ethic in her and her seven siblings. Because of their teachings and guidance, Brinda was destined to shape a global footprint beyond that small town. Brinda is very humble, and is unaware of the broad impact she has had on others throughout her trail-blazing career. She continues to plant the seeds of greatness in the paths of women, inspiring them to achieve their dreams.\n\nWhile in grade school, she was inspired to become an Architect from watching “The Brady Bunch” television show. She became focused on that career and that focus remained with her until her dream was realized. In 1979, Brinda graduated Valedictorian from Lakeside High School in Lake Village, Arkansas, as the first African American to do so in the history of the high school. She attended the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and graduated with a degree in Architecture, only the second African American woman to do so. From 1985 to 1989, she worked as an Architect in a small architectural firm in Little Rock. After realizing her initial dream of becoming an Architect, she decided to shift her focus to other opportunities. In January 1990, she started a career with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Little Rock District, as an Architect in the Design Branch.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy items of her career as an Architect came about when she passed her Architectural Registration Exam in 1991, becoming the first African American woman in Arkansas registered to practice Architecture. Since that time, she has maintained her status as a Registered Architect. She is also a registered Project Management Professional.\n\nShe has attained additional outstanding accomplishments throughout her career. During her tenure as an Architect and Design Team Leader in the Design Branch, she worked on various projects for military installations across the country, including Fort Sill, Oklahoma; Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Fort Bliss, Texas; Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina; and Little Rock Air Force Base. In 1999, Brinda made the transition from Architect to Project Manager. In 2003, she deployed as a civilian Project Manager with the Forward Engineering Support Team, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While in Iraq, she was presented the 555 Combat Engineer Group Commander's Award for being the “Battlefield Hero” of the day and received two Command Sergeant Major's Coins of Excellence, in addition to receiving the Superior Civilian Service Award and the Chief of Engineer's coin. During her career, she has received numerous awards, achievement medals and recognition's, to include: 2013 Civilian of the Year for Little Rock District; 1999 graduate of the Army Management Staff College, where she received the Department of the Army Certificate of Achievement for \"Best in Seminar\"; 1998 recipient of the Women of Color Technology Award for Government Leadership (non-Government award); and the 1995 Little Rock District Architect of the Year.\n\nThough an architect by profession, she is currently the Chief, Civil Works Programs Branch, Little Rock District, with the responsibility of developing, defending and executing an annual civil works program in excess of $200M. Her reputation for “getting the job done” has led to increased opportunities for various developmental assignments: Operations Project Manager for Table Rock Lake, Branson, Missouri; Regional Integration Team - Programmer, Headquarters USACE, Washington, DC; Acting Chief, Project Management Branch, Galveston District, Galveston, Texas; and most recently, the Acting Chief, Civil Works Integration Division, Southwestern Division, Dallas, Texas, where she was responsible for an annual civil works program portfolio that exceeded $1B.\n\nBrinda has been an inspiration to all that know her, particularly women, because of her phenomenal career. She is a mentor to many, both formal and informal. Understanding the struggles of growing up poor in a small rural Arkansas town, she and three of her siblings (who also graduated from Lakeside High School) established the Jackson Family Scholarship in 2000, which is awarded annually to a graduating Senior of Lakeside High School. Brinda is a member of St Mark Baptist Church in Little Rock. She and her husband, David Switzer, reside in central Arkansas.\n\n2017 Inductee\n\nThere are few Arkansans - women or men - who have spoken more eloquently on the cause of civil rights and social justice than Dorothy D. Stuck. In the turbulent era of the late 1950s through the 1960s, she was a leading and sometimes lone, voice in calling for equality for all in Arkansas.\n\nDuring this time she and her husband Howard were publishers of three east Arkansas newspapers - the Marked Tree Tribune, the Lepanto News Record, and the Truman Democrat. She received the Press woman of the Year award in 1964 and 1969. She was a charter member of the Arkansas Press Women and later served as its president.\n\nIn 1968, she was elected to represent Poinsett County in the Arkansas Constitutional Convention and was elected to chair the Suffrage and Election Committee, the only woman to chair a major committee.\n\nShe was able to put her words into action when she was named in 1970 as Regional Director, U.S. Office for Civil Rights, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Dallas Region, including Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. In this position, she was responsible for adherence to desegregation of public schools, institutions of higher learning and state health organizations. She served a temporary assignment as acting national Deputy Director of the office for Civil Rights in Washington, D.C., and was among those responsible for the implementation of Title IX, providing equal opportunities for women in education. She received HEW's Distinguished Service Award, which is the Department's highest civilian award, for her leadership in civil rights.\n\nAlso while in Dallas, she was the first woman to chair the Dallas-Fort Worth Federal Executive Board and was named one of Dallas' Top Ten Women News-Shapers.\n\nAfter nine years, she returned home to Arkansas and became a partner in Stuck and Snow Consultants, a Little Rock-based management and publications consulting firm. She also became a charter board-member of Southern Bancorp, a rural development bank serving the Delta area. As a board member, she coined the term “Building Communities, Changing Lives” to characterize the bank's work. She served on the board of the bank’s holding company and chaired the board of its non-profit partner, Southern Bancorp Community Partners.\n\nAfter 30 years, she retired from the board, at which time Southern Bancorp established the Dorothy Stuck Empowerment Award that will be given annually to the employee whose work best exemplifies her goals.\n\nA graduate of the University of Arkansas, she received the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2008. While a student at the university, she was a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority and later served for nine years as editor of \"The Arrow,\" the sorority's national magazine.\n\nUpon her retirement, she co-authored a biography, \"ROBERTA: A Most Remarkable Fulbright\" which reached the best-seller list in Arkansas and received an award of merit from the American Association of state and Local History.\n\nCurrently, she is a member of the Winthrop Rockefeller Lecture Board. She is one of those featured in the Rockefeller Museum on Petit Jean. She has also been a part of the Arkansas women's exhibit at the Old Statehouse Museum. She is listed in the book, \"100 Women of Achievement in Arkansas\" and included in the University of Arkansas' Pryor Center for Oral and Visual History which features life histories of outstanding Arkansans. She has been honored by the Archives of the Women of the Southwest at Southern Methodist University in its \"Remember the Ladies\" recognition program.\n\nDorothy's husband Howard died in 1981, and their son, Howard III, in 1990. She now resides in Little Rock. Often introduced as an \"Arkansas Legend\", it can be easily said that her courage in a time of democratic upheaval has earned her well-deserved admiration and respect.\n\n2017 Inductee\n\nElsijane Trimble Roy was Arkansas’s first woman circuit judge, the first woman on the Arkansas Supreme Court, the first woman appointed to an Arkansas federal judgeship, the first woman federal judge in the Eighth Circuit, and the first Arkansas woman to follow her father as a federal judge.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1916, in Lonoke (Lonoke County), Elsijane Trimble was one of five children of Judge Thomas Clark Trimble III and Elsie Walls. Her father and grandfather were both attorneys in a law practice with Senator Joseph T. Robinson, and her father later became a federal judge. Trimble grew up in Lonoke attending local schools and was a star basketball player her four years at Lonoke High School, graduating in 1934 as valedictorian. After high school, she entered the University of Arkansas (UA) in Fayetteville (Washington County), where she was the women’s singles and mixed doubles tennis champion for two years. She completed undergraduate studies and law school in five years and was the only woman to graduate from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1939. At the time, she was only the third woman to graduate from UA with a law degree.\n\nShe was admitted to the bar the same year as graduation and joined the law firm of W. W. McCrary Jr. in Lonoke. Between 1940 and 1942, Trimble was a state attorney for the Revenue Department, and from 1942 to 1944, she worked in the Office of Price Administration, where she was the chief price attorney.\n\nTrimble married a law school classmate, James Morrison Roy, on November 23, 1944, and moved to Houston, Texas, where he worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In December 1946, they had a son. The following year, the Roys returned to Arkansas, moving to Blytheville (Mississippi County). She and her husband returned to practice law for the firm of Reid and Evrard. By 1954, she and her husband established Blytheville’s first husband-and-wife law firm, Roy and Roy, which lasted until 1963. The firm was closed for personal reasons after both her husband and father were hospitalized in Little Rock (Pulaski County). Between 1963 and 1966, Roy was the law clerk for Justice Frank Holt of the Arkansas Supreme Court. She and her husband divorced on June 30, 1967.\n\nIn 1966, Roy became the first woman judge in Arkansas when Governor Orval Faubus appointed her as a justice for the Sixth District Court; she served from April to December. She served as an assistant attorney general for the State of Arkansas between February and May 1967. From May 1967 until 1975, with the exception of a few months in 1969–70, she served as a law clerk for Federal District Court Judges Gordon E. Young (1967–1969) and Paul X. Williams (1970–1975).\n\nGovernor David Pryor appointed her as the first woman judge on the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1975, where she served until 1977, when Pryor recommended her for a federal judgeship in the Eastern Judicial District of Arkansas upon the retirement of Judge Oren Harris. On October 21, 1977, President Jimmy Carter nominated Roy to be the first woman federal district court judge in the Eighth Circuit, as recommended by Senators Dale Bumpers and John L. McClellan, and the U.S. Senate confirmed her on November 1, 1977. Roy occupied the position for twenty-one years, taking senior status in 1989 and retiring in 1999.\n\nDuring Roy’s legal career, she garnered many honors, awards, and recognitions. In 1969 and 1976, respectively, she was named Woman of the Year, first by the Business and Professional Women’s Club and then by the Arkansas Democrat. She was awarded two honorary degrees: a Juris Doctor in 1969 from UA and a Doctor of Laws in 1978 from what is now the University of Arkansas at Little Rock William H. Bowen School of Law. She was a prominent member of Chi Omega.\n\nRoy kept her favorite Bible verse, Micah 6:8, on her bench: “What does the Lord require of you but to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly before your God.” Her Arkansas Democrat Woman of the Year plaque inscription reads that “she has become a symbol of pride and inspiration to all women.” In its memorial resolution to her, the Eighty-sixth Arkansas General Assembly reflected upon her “commitment, hard work, dedication and service.”\n\nRoy died on January 23, 2007, at the age of ninety, and is buried in Lonoke Cemetery.\n\n(Courtesy of: Encyclopedia of Arkansas, Central Arkansas Library System)\n\n2017 Inductee\n\nMaya Angelou was an internationally renowned bestselling author, poet, actor, and performer, as well as a pioneering activist for the rights of African Americans and of women. Her first published book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1970), was an autobiographical account of her childhood, including the ten years she lived in Stamps (Lafayette County) with her grandmother. The popular and critical success of the book was the foundation of her career as an author and public figure, as well as the basis of her identification as an Arkansas author. She was in the first group of inductees into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame in 1993. She held over fifty honorary university degrees, along with many other awards recognizing her accomplishments in the arts and her service to human rights.\n\nAngelou was born Marguerite Annie Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Bailey Johnson, who was a naval dietitian, and Vivian Baxter Johnson, who was a nurse. Angelou had one sibling, her older brother Bailey Jr.; he called her \"Maya,\" his version of \"my sister.\"\n\nAfter the divorce of their parents in 1931, Marguerite and Bailey Jr. were sent to Arkansas to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson, and their uncle, Willie, in Stamps. Henderson owned the only grocery store in the small town and reared the children according to the strict Christian values common in the rural South at that time. The family encountered the racial prejudice of the white customers in the store and of the community leaders generally. In her autobiography, Angelou recounted chafing at the attitudes she encountered of people who seemed to condone the limited opportunities available for black high school graduates of the time. Later, Angelou suggested that her faith and Christian beliefs—as well as her strong sense of fair play and realization of her own and others' inner beauty—stemmed from these early experiences.\n\nIn 1935, the children were returned to the care of their mother in St. Louis but were sent back to Stamps after it was discovered that Marguerite had been sexually molested by her mother’s boyfriend. The man was tried and convicted but then released; he was found dead soon after. The eight-year-old girl felt guilty and believed that her voice had caused the death of the rapist, so she became mute and remained so for several years.\n\nThe two children once again moved to be with their mother—this time to San Francisco, California. After dropping out of high school, Marguerite was briefly employed as a cable car conductor, the first black person ever to hold that position. She returned to Mission High School and earned a scholarship to study dance, drama, and music at San Francisco’s Labor School, where she also learned about the progressive ideologies that may have served as a foundation for her later social and political activism. In 1944, three weeks after graduation, she gave birth to her son, Claude (who later changed his name to Guy). She had no further formal education.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one, she married a Greek sailor, Tosh Angelos. Before they divorced in 1952, when she was singing at the Purple Onion nightclub in San Francisco, she created her professional name by combining a variation of his surname with her brother’s nickname for her, Maya. Eventually, she legally changed her name to Maya Angelou.\n\nIn 1954–55, she toured Europe and Africa in a State Department–sponsored production of the opera Porgy and Bess. In 1955, she moved with her son to New York City, where she studied modern dance with Martha Graham and Alvin Ailey. She appeared in television shows and released an album called Miss Calypso in 1957, also appearing in the film Calypso Heat Wave the same year. A composer of poems and song lyrics since her teen years, she continued to develop her writing skills.\n\nShe met prominent members of the African-American creative community and performed in Jean Genet’s The Blacks. With Godfrey Cambridge she produced Cabaret for Freedom, a fundraiser for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Martin Luther King Jr., a leader in SCLC, recruited Angelou as its northern coordinator in 1960.\n\nIn the early 1960s, she met South African freedom fighter and civil rights advocate Vusumzi Make, a leader of the Pan Africanist Congress who was then living in New York City. They moved to Cairo, Egypt, where she became editor of the weekly newspaper the Arab Observer. In 1963, she and her son left Egypt for Ghana, where she met Malcolm X. She became an assistant administrator at the University of Ghana’s School of Music and Drama and later a feature editor for the African Review, as well as a feature writer for the Ghanaian Times and the Ghanaian Broadcasting Company, where she also recorded public service announcements.\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Angelou rejoined the civil rights movement, working with Malcolm X in the Organization of Afro-American Unity. Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, and King was assassinated in 1968—on April 4, Angelou's birthday.\n\nIn reaction to these events, Angelou—encouraged by novelist James Baldwin—began writing the first installment of her life story, including an account of her years in Arkansas. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was first published in 1970 and has since been translated into more than ten languages. Her experiences in the civil rights movement were a focus of a later autobiography, The Heart of a Woman (1981). Enjoying her burgeoning career as a writer, lecturer, and public personality following the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, she wrote the screenplay for Georgia, Georgia, a Swedish-American film; it was the first screenplay by an African American to be filmed. A collection of her poems, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1972.\n\nWinning much critical acclaim and becoming a national figure who was always in demand for public appearances, she continued to maintain her political activism. The running themes in all of her works, both about herself and about the world, deal with the individual’s wish and right to survive in a non-hostile world. Believing that hatred and racism destroy that which is good and basic in humankind, she struggled to provide simple, down-to-earth solutions to the problems that threaten the world.\n\nIn 1975, President Gerald Ford appointed her to the Bicentennial Commission. In 1981, she received a lifetime appointment to the Reynolds Chair of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In 1993, she read her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. She read her poem \"A Brave and Startling Truth\" at the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and \"From a Black Woman to a Black Man\" at the Million Man March in 1995.\n\nAngelou had a distinctive and compelling speaking voice, and, at six feet tall, a powerful physical presence enhanced by her training in dance and stage performance. Angelou was nominated for a 1977 Emmy Award for her portrayal of Kunta Kinte’s grandmother in Alex Haley’s television miniseries Roots. Angelou appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, and the Tavis Smiley Show. She also started a Hallmark greeting cards line called Life Mosaic. The movie Poetic Justice (1993) featured poetry written by Angelou and performed by Janet Jackson. In 1998, she made her film directing debut with Down in the Delta (1998). In 2006, she had a starring role in Tyler Perry's Medea's Family Reunion. In 2002, she won a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album for A Song Flung Up to Heaven.\n\nAngelou was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2000. On February 15, 2011, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama. In 2013, she received the Literarian Award from the National Book Foundation and the Mailer Prize for Lifetime Achievement from the Norman Mailer Center.\n\nHer body of published works includes autobiographies, numerous poetry collections, a book of essays, several plays, a screenplay, and a cookbook. Among her many works are Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin’ and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986), A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002), Hallelujah! The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories with Recipes (2004), and Mom & Me & Mom (2013).\n\nAfter a period of ill health, Angelou was found dead by her caretaker on May 28, 2014, in North Carolina. In June 2014, the town of Stamps renamed its only park in her honor. On April 7, 2015, the U.S. Postal Service released a stamp in honor of Angelou. In March 2016, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure to rename a post office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, after Angelou.\n\n(Courtesy of: Encyclopedia of Arkansas, CALS)\n\n(Images courtesy of: Persistence of the Spirit collection, PS14_08: Maya Angelou on January 23, 1983.

When the National Guard was sent by President Eisenhower to the capital city to protect students integrating Little Rock Central High and to keep the peace in September 1957 during the crisis under Governor Faubus, a photograph of that billboard took on a powerful new meaning. After their years at Hendrix College, she and her husband John moved to Durham, North Carolina, for him to attend Duke University Law School. That question loomed large in their thinking, they realized in retrospect, as they made the decision to Arkansas in June of 1962. They have not regretted that return home.\n\nSince then, Lile has enjoyed two volunteer and professional careers of almost 30 years each, the first 28 years in Pine Bluff and since 1990, in Little Rock. She became known for her community building efforts both locally and statewide, focusing on the importance of leadership development and on philanthropy, the giving of individual and corporate financial resources. Don Munro challenged her by saying that he wanted to see the time come in Arkansas that philanthropy would be as frequent a topic of conversation as Razorback sports! She set out, through the Arkansas Community Foundation to which Munro contributed significantly, to help make that a reality. Dr. Tom Bruce, also a major contributor, was her ally in that effort which continues even today under the able Heather Larkin who succeeded Lile as president and CEO in 2008.\n\nPat Lile culminated her professional career by serving as President and CEO of the Arkansas Community Foundation, Inc. from mid 1996 through the end of 2007 when she retired. Her previous positions in Little Rock included serving as Executive Director of the Commission for Arkansas’ Future, a state planning effort from 1990-1995, and as Interim Executive Director of the Family Service Agency.\n\nPrior to moving with her family to Little Rock, she and her family lived in Pine Bluff for 28 years, where she was very active in the community as a volunteer. Among her charitable involvements was the Salvation Army Women’s Auxiliary which she served as president. She also served on the Board of the United Way of Southeast Arkansas for which she was the first woman to serve as drive co-chairman, and the first woman to serve as Chair of the Board of Directors, a position she held for two years. She was an active member of the League of Women Voters in those years. She ran two major tax initiative campaigns for the city, and led two millage campaigns for the public schools, all successful. A Brownie Scout leader, she was also an active volunteer in the public schools from which their 4 children all graduated. She was awarded a lifetime membership in the PTA and was given the Lester Silbernagel Award by the Pine Bluff School District. As a member of the Junior League of Pine Bluff, she chaired several committees and was a delegate to the League’s national child advocacy conference in the mid 1970’s. She also led a community task force which established the first SCAN child abuse chapter outside of Little Rock. A supporter of the Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas, she chaired its first benefit dinner and charitable auction. As an active member of First Presbyterian Church in Pine Bluff, she was the first woman to serve as annual stewardship campaign chair, and was honored to be one of the first women elected as an Elder to serve on the Session.\n\nShe and her husband John founded Leadership Pine Bluff in 1981, the first program of its type in the state, and she was its executive director for 9 years. She organized NALO for other leadership programs in the state and led its annual conference for several years. Concurrently, she led the nonprofit community-planning and improvement program entitled Pine Bluff 2000 and was Vice President for Community Development of the Greater Pine Bluff Chamber of Commerce. She completed the Community Development Institute at UCA in the late 80’s. She was a founding board member and officer of the Pine Bluff Affiliate of the Arkansas Community Foundation in 1987, the second local Affiliate formed in the state. In a newspaper poll naming the Top Ten Most Influential Residents of the city, she was the only woman chosen. In 1982 she was honored with the Community Service Award from Channel 4 and the Governor’s Office on Volunteerism for her efforts to build Pine Bluff. She co-founded Synergy Forum, a 50-member women’s philanthropic grantmaking organization in Pine Bluff. In 1977 she was one of the co-founders of Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families and served on its Board for 10 years, including service as Board Chair.\n\nAs a resident of Little Rock since 1990, Lile has served on the Boards of Baptist Health Foundation, the Metropolitan YMCA, JCA (Just Communities of Arkansas, formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews), City Year Little Rock/North Little Rock, and Lifequest. Lile was the first Arkansas woman to be chosen to participate in Leadership America, and served on the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce steering committee which created Leadership Arkansas. She also has served on the Garvan Woodland Gardens advisory council and is a member of the advisory board of WAND (Women’s Action for New Directions). She was a co-founder of the Arkansas Nonprofit Alliance (formerly named ACE) and served on its board for many years. She is a sustaining member of the Junior League of Little Rock, and formerly a member of the Rotary Club of Little Rock, where she was named a Paul Harris Fellow. After retirement, she served for two years as a consultant on the nonprofit sector for the Arkansas Economic Development Commission and is a volunteer speaker on various topics such as leadership, community development, stewardship, volunteerism, board governance and philanthropy.\n\nCurrently she is serving her eleventh year and second term as Chair of the Board of Trustees of Philander Smith College. She also serves on the Boards of the U. S. Marshals Museum and the Joseph Pfeifer Kiwanis Camp.\n\nLile has received a number of other honors including the Arkansas Community Foundation’s Lugean Chilcote award in the late 80’s and its “Roots and Wings” Arkansas Benefactor award on her retirement. She received the Award of Excellence from the Arkansas Community Development program. She was named by the Governor as a member of the Arkansas Sesquicentennial Commission for the 1986 celebration year. In 1989 Lile was named as co-honoree (with Dr. Joycelyn Elders) as \"Citizen of the Year\" by the Arkansas Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers. She is a 1995 graduate of Leadership America, a nationwide leadership program for outstanding women, and was the first Arkansas native chosen to participate. Entergy, Inc. awarded her its “Distinguished Leadership Award” in 1997. Appointed by then President Bill Clinton, she was the only Arkansan to attend the 1999 White House Conference on Philanthropy. Lile was honored four times as one of the \"Top 100 Women of Arkansas\" by Arkansas Business. In 2004 the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Arkansas Commission named her the recipient of a “Salute to Greatness” Community Service Award.\n\nShe is a founding member of AWLF (the Arkansas Women's Leadership Forum) and was a co-founder with Olivia Farrell of the Women’s Foundation of Arkansas, twice honored her, the first time at its “Power of the Purse” luncheon in 2002, and again by naming her “Arkansas Woman of the Year in Philanthropy” in 2007. She was honored in 2008 with the “Lifetime of Service” Award by City Year Little Rock/North Little Rock and with the Billie Ann Myers “Paragon” award by the Division of Volunteerism. In March of 2009 Lile was named by Arkansas Business, the state’s premier weekly business publication, as one of the top 25 Arkansas women leaders over the past 25 years, one of only two from the philanthropic sector. In March of 2010 Lile was presented the Father Joseph Biltz award from Just Communities of Arkansas (JCA), and was named recipient of the James E. Harris Nonprofit Leadership award in 2016 by the Arkansas Nonprofit Alliance.\n\nUnder Lile’s leadership for almost 12 years, the Arkansas Community Foundation assets grew from just under $15 million to almost $130 million, and its statewide Affiliate system grew to include 26 local community foundations offices, with a staff of 11 full-time and 26 part-time. ARCF is one of the five largest grantmaking foundations in the state. Lile retired as President and CEO effective 31 December 2007.\n\nLile is a native of Hope, Arkansas. After attending Hendrix College, in 1959 she married John Gardner Lile III, who is now a retired attorney. They have four grown children, seven grandchildren, and one great grandchild. They are active members of First United Methodist Church where she serves on several boards and committees and is the volunteer Director of Planned Giving.\n\n2016 Inductee\n\nBetty Ann Lowe, M.D., was an exemplary pediatrician, diagnostician, educator, and advocate for children, Arkansas Children’s Hospital and the state of Arkansas. She was known to be homespun, devoted, generous and tenacious beyond compare! Her parents, John W. and Winnie Lowe were public school administrators and educators. Betty was educated in the public schools of rural Texas and Arkansas, the University of Arkansas and the U of A Medical School venturing out of state only to Boston’s Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School for residency training. She attributed her 25 years of private pediatric practice in Texarkana, AR/TX as preparing her to understand the struggle of families and local physicians and the need for better access to medical care for all residents of the state. To quote her, “To practice medicine for a period of time is a major factor toward being an effective clinical teacher”. She then set out to educate over two generations of pediatric physicians in the next three decades of her career.\n\nBetty was active on boards and committees locally for such agencies as Camp Aldersgate, Easter Seals, and Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families (she was a founder of this group). She also enjoyed being part of the International Women’s Forum of Arkansas and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Women’s Foundation of Arkansas. She was named the recipient of the Father Joseph Blitz Award given by Arkansas Just Communities; the Paul Harris Fellow Award of Rotary International for community service; graduated first in her UAMS medical school class; elected to membership in the medical honor society of Alpha Omega Alpha; 1980 the Golden Apple Teaching Award from UAMS; 1982 the Arkansas Caduceus Club Distinguished Faculty Award; American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)--member, Fellow, Vice President and President (only Arkansan to serve and the second woman to be elected nationally for President); received the Milton Senn Award from AAP in 1996 for contributions to school health; 1982 the President's 75th Anniversary Award at ACH; and the UAMS Chancellor's Award for Distinguished Achievements in Science and Medicine in 2002. Dr. Lowe was named as the first recipient of the Harvey and Bernice Jones Chair in Pediatrics in 1997. President William J. Clinton appointed her as an advisor to his Task Force for Health Care Reform. Because Betty had such a passion for teaching physicians, nurses and other health care professionals her family, medical colleagues, former students and patients honored her with the establishment of the Betty Ann Lowe, M.D. Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Education in 1999. As part of her legacy to ACH she directed her estate to provide for continuing support of the Division of Pediatric Rheumatology at ACH and a Chair was established for a Board Certified Pediatric Rheumatologist in 2013.\n\nShe was known as a role model for students and physicians; not just for female students, but also for all students. She was fair and demanded the best effort from herself and others. As one student recalled, “ She did not tolerate laziness” or students who only wanted to do enough to “get by”. “Not living up to individual potential” was a lesson learned at an early age within her family and carried over into all aspects of her professional career. She not only believed that excellence could be achieved in life, but that no one should even consider not “going for it”.\n\nDr. Lowe achieved many firsts in her career starting at an early age as valedictorian of Fourche Valley High School (Briggsville, Arkansas) and graduating first in her UAMS medical school class; but she never aspired to be ‘first’ only because something would attract attention to her. Quite the contrary, as Medical Director for Arkansas Children’s Hospital and Associate Dean of Pediatrics at University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, she was known to put the patients, families and students first. She insisted that the needs of patients and physicians come before “remodeling her office to look like a real physician’s office when that money could be used for patient care”. The ‘firsts’ she celebrated were those achieved by Arkansas Children’s Hospital in patient care, pediatric education, and clinical research. Over the next twenty-five years Dr. Lowe assisted with a number of firsts for ACH: a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with 12 bassinets; a state of the art ambulatory care service; open heart surgery; bone marrow transplant; heart transplant; NICU expanded to 55 beds; and a cooperative agreement with UAMS and ACH for the establishment of a joint state of the art Research Institute.\n\nDuring her tenure as Medical Director the ACH expanded from a 45-bed, 2 patient wards to a modern teaching hospital with more than 260 beds, 70 specialty clinics and a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Although she worked with excellent boards, administrators, and physicians over those years, there were the “dis-believers” who thought some of her ideas “were off the wall” and just could not be done. Her answer to those was, “We won't know until we try, will we?”\n\nAs President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the first and only Arkansan to date to hold that title, she was an advocate for health care reforms for children and medical education by challenging policies of the day, and advising politicians as well as physicians to “step up to the plate” and get moving with improving situations like poverty, public health issues (clean water, sanitation, adequate food for good nutrition, etc.), and health insurance. Many thought these were inappropriate issues for pediatricians, but Betty was relentless in showing how getting at the “root causes of illness and disease was essential to improving treatment and keeping children well”.\n\nAunt Bett, as she was known within the family, counted the nieces, nephews, great nieces and great nephews as her children and patients when the need arose. A very special treat for her was getting to visit with her first great-great niece and to get a late night phone call from her mom (the great niece) about what she should do about a “red rash’’! Aunt Bett would have liked for one of her nieces or nephews to become a Pediatrician. When one great niece told her she wanted to pursue Nursing, she replied, “Yep, yep, I think that is great! Be you and do what you love and success and happiness are sure to follow”. She was always supportive of the “kids” as she called them.\n\nAt one point she aspired to be a professional basketball player, but gave that up when she realized she would not be taller than five feet four inches. She had tremendous common sense and was practical in assessing her limits. This did not, however, diminish her competitive spirit in high school and intra-mural basketball in college. Her “left hook shot” was un-guardable and rarely missed going through the hoop! She was an avid reader with a very diverse subject matter interest and maintained a large stamp and coin collection; always had beautiful flowers in her garden as well as good vegetables (which she tended herself).\n\nBetty prepared well for her chosen profession and never stopped studying and learning even in retirement. She exemplified what young women in Arkansas and elsewhere can become with education, study, and perseverance.\n\nIn summary, three quotes stand out: Betty was quoted on many occasions saying, “If you have any ideas about the future of our society then you know that this depends on making sure our children of today have the best health and education we can give them”. To quote President Bill Clinton at her retirement, “To me, she just took care of kids better than anybody. And she inspired a whole new generation of doctors to do the same. Betty, you have lived your life well in the most noble way possible – pouring yourself out for others”. One of her great nephews who spoke at her memorial told of an instance when Aunt Bett had said something he had done was “cool”. He followed by saying that “ When Aunt Bett said something was cool, now that was cool!”\n\n2016 Inductee\n\nKay Kelley Arnold retired from Entergy Corporation as vice president of Public Affairs three years ago and now spends her time gardening, fishing, entertaining friends at her cabin on the Little Red River, playing with her dog Scout, traveling and volunteering for political candidates and non-profit causes she believes in. She was a pioneer in understanding and acting on the belief that working cooperatively together, government and the private sector can accomplish goals that can not and do not happen alone. She has led award-winning programs that support the environment and economic growth. She developed effective grass roots campaigns to pass significant legislation and to raise funds for innovative projects that bridge the gaps that exist between economic prosperity and environmental quality.\n\nHer experience in philanthropy and political action is now focused on several state, regional and national organizations where she serves as a board member and volunteer. She currently serves on the board of Arkansas Hospice, and is a founding director of two new environmental non-profits, the Arkansas Environmental Defense Alliance and the Little Red River Foundation. She continues to serve on the national board of The Conservation Fund and is an advisory board member to the Inter-American Foundation and the Foundation of the Mid South. She is also serving as a citizen advisor to the Metroplan board, appointed by Mayor Mark Stodola and an Arkansas advisor to the Clinton Foundation. She is an active member of the Arkansas Women’s Forum and serves as an honorary member of Arkansas Women of Power.\n\nAs the first Arkansas director of the Nature Conservancy field office, she learned the importance of partnerships between government, non-profit and corporate entities. Working together these organizations can accomplish more than any one of them could do by themselves and the societal benefits of these collaborations are both enduring and tangible. As the Director of the Department of Arkansas Heritage she experienced the power people have to improve their communities when they are focused and flexible to make changes and work diligently toward common goals.\n\nPublic service is part of Kay Kelley Arnold’s DNA. Her parents, Henry and Tommie Kelley, always participated in the life of their community and taught their children that it was an honor to be asked and a duty to serve, to volunteer their time and talent to the betterment of society, in small and large ways. That foundation coupled with enlightened employers who understand the value of volunteer opportunities and who encourage employees to find meaningful ways to give back to their community gave Kay the love, spirit and ability to get involved in a wide variety of projects.\n\nFor almost 40 years, Kay has been an active volunteer, serving and leading on more than 45 Board of Directors for non-profit and governmental agency advisory boards at the local, state, national, and international levels. As her numerous board and committee positions attest, Kay utilizes her passion for the environment and her commitment to eliminating poverty and expanding economic opportunity to advocate for meaningful change, both within Arkansas and beyond.\n\nArnold’s decade of volunteer service to the Little Rock Municipal Airport Commission, the body responsible for setting policy for Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, brought momentous improvements to the airport’s passenger experience while dramatically increasing its economic impact on the state of Arkansas.\n\nArnold, who twice served as chairwoman, was influential in changing the airport’s longstanding business model with airlines, an unheard-of move at the time. This enabled the airport commission to begin retaining record earnings, which have helped to bring about $90 million in improvements during the largest construction initiative within the organization’s history. The projects have included a new ticket lobby, baggage claim renovation, an enlarged security checkpoint in addition to an upcoming concourse renovation. Much of the work, which was completed by local contractors, began at the end of the recession, and provided a much needed spur to the local economy. The first phase of the terminal redevelopment project was completed in May 2013 with President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton in attendance to celebrate the airport’s transformation, and formally dedicate the facility as Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport. The concourse renovation, the last portion of the long-term project, will start later this summer.\n\nClinton National Airport, which is now debt free, has been a trailblazer as airports across the country have since adopted the Little Rock Airport’s best practices, set forth by the airport commission, as their choice financial model for future success.\n\nThe airport is home to nearly 4,000 jobs with approximately half of those located at Dassault-Falcon Jet Corporation. Occupying more than 1-million square feet, Dassault-Falcon’s operation at Clinton National is the largest in the world. In 2013 during Arnold’s last term as chairwoman, Dassault was looking at several communities that were vying to be the site of the company’s new facility to serve as the completion center for two new jets, the Falcon 5X and the Falcon 8X. Arnold was exceedingly determined that Little Rock would be chosen, which would result in a 250-thousand square foot expansion and additional, good paying jobs. Through Arnold’s leadership, the airport provided $41 million in rent incentives, which helped Little Rock win the project that was completed in November 2015.\n\n2016 Inductee\n\nLottie H. Shackelford has made history throughout her impressive 40 plus years in local, state and national politics. In 1987, she became the first woman elected Mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas. Six years later, President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Board of Directors of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), making her the first African American woman to serve on that Board. She also has the distinction of having the longest tenure as Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), having served for 20 years and is currently Vice Chair Emeritus and Chair of the DNC Women’s Caucus.\n\nMs. Shackelford's political career began in 1978 when she was appointed to the Board of Directors for the city of Little Rock, Arkansas. She was elected and re-elected city wide three times before being elected the City’s first woman Mayor. During her tenure in local government, Ms. Shackelford directed liaison activities for minority businesses and held leadership posit"
