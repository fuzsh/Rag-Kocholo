        "text": "Through the Fairmont State Foundation, and their generous donors, and Institutional funds Fairmont State University intends to promote and cultivate the highest degree of scholarships for our students. The Office of Financial Aid Services administers scholarship aid delivery for a wide range of externally funded and managed merit- and need-based scholarships to our students with the intention of fostering the recruitment and retention of a diverse student body.\n\nGeneral Scholarship Application\n\nThe General Scholarship Application for 2025-2026 will open on October 1, 2024.\n\nScholarships for talent and academic merit are very competitive such that each applicant is judged against all others applying for the same scholarship. So, be outstanding! Scholarships vary on whether they are solely merit-based, solely needs-based, or a mixture of the two. Another distinction to keep in mind is the renewal processes for that particular scholarship. Some are renewable for four years but will need a new application every year, while others may only be renewable for your freshman and sophomore years. Be sure to pay attention to your desired scholarshipâ€™s renewal protocols.\n\nFairmont State is pleased to provide the student aid calculator to assist you in estimating your costs to attend. Results are based on 2023-2024 Estimated Cost of Attendance figures and student aid eligibility requirements which are subject to change. These results should assist you in determining an estimate of your out-of-pocket expense to attend Fairmont State.\n\nHints\n\nNumerous scholarships are available from private and corporate sources. Too numerous to list, you may research the many offerings through the use of library or computerized resources.\n\nOther sites to check out are:\n\nCollege Foundation of West Virginia\n\nRobert H. Mollohan Family Charitable Foundation\n\nFastweb\n\nCollegeScholarships.com\n\nPeterson's\n\nCollege Board\n\nFree-4U.com\n\nDepartment of Defense Smart Scholarship"
