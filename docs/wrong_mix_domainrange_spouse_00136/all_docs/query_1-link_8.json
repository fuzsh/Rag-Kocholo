        "text": "Three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep, Tony winner Mary-Louise Parker, and Broadway alum Carla Gugino have joined the upcoming spring lineup of Spotlight on Plays. As previously announced, the season begins March 25 with The Thanksgiving Play followed by Angry, Raucous and Shamelessly Gorgeous April 9.\n\nWhile dates for the additional five plays by women have yet to be announced, casting and creative team details have begun to trickle in over the past few weeks.\n\nStreep will star opposite Kevin Kline as Elizabeth and Robert, respectively, in Sarah Ruhl’s Dear Elizabeth, directed by Kate Whoriskey. Parker will play Anna in Paula Vogel’s The Baltimore Waltz, directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz. Lillian Hellman’s Watch on the Rhine, directed by Sarna Lapine, will feature Gugino as Sara Muller and Ellen Burstyn as Fanny Farrelly."
