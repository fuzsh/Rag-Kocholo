IN ''The Duellists,'' ''Alien'' and ''Blade Runner,'' Ridley Scott earned a reputation as something of a stylist, a director whose use of striking visual and aural decoration is integral to the meaning of his work.

However, ''Someone to Watch Over Me,'' his new film, reflects less a sense of style than a dependence on a few, comparatively easy-to-achieve effects that pass for style - smoky interiors often lighted from below, lots of reflecting surfaces, nighttime exteriors of startling, liquid clarity, all supplemented by a music track that contrasts cocktail-piano pop and high-toned classical tidbits.

Beneath its elegant mask, ''Someone to Watch Over Me'' is a commonplace melodrama about Mike Keegan (Tom Berenger), a happily married New York policeman, who has an affair with Claire Gregory (Mimi Rogers), the beautiful Manhattan millionaire whose body he's been assigned to guard. Claire has had the misfortune to witness a murder while attending the opening of a fashionable downtown art gallery, and the murderer (Andreas Katsulas) wants her dead before she can testify.

Claire finds all the precautions just too, too boring, but something draws her to the strong, handsome, lower-middle-class policeman, who knows nothing about modern art and thinks her friends are superficial. Mike, on his part, has never before met anyone like Claire - witty, sweetly careless about money and, when the chips are down, basically decent.
