        "text": "Primary Sources are immediate, first-hand accounts of a topic, from people who had a direct connection with it. Primary sources can include:\n\nTexts of laws and other original documents.\n\nNewspaper reports, by reporters who witnessed an event or who quote people who did.\n\nSpeeches, diaries, letters and interviews - what the people involved said or wrote.\n\nOriginal research.\n\nDatasets, survey data, such as census or economic statistics.\n\nPhotographs, video, or audio that capture an event.\n\nSecondary Sources are one step removed from primary sources, though they often quote or otherwise use primary sources. They can cover the same topic, but add a layer of interpretation and analysis. Secondary sources can include:\n\nMost books about a topic.\n\nAnalysis or interpretation of data.\n\nScholarly or other articles about a topic, especially by people not directly involved.\n\nDocumentaries (though they often include photos or video portions that can be considered primary sources).\n\nWhether something is a primary or secondary source often depends upon the topic and its use.\n\nA biology textbook would be considered a secondary source if in the field of biology, since it describes and interprets the science but makes no original contribution to it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the topic is science education and the history of textbooks, textbooks could be used a primary sources to look at how they have changed over time."
