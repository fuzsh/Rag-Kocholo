        "text": "Grab that blanket and pop that popcorn — it’s family movie time. Between eye-rolling teenagers, cartwheeling young kids and parents fighting to stay awake, it can be hard to pick a movie that the whole family will enjoy.\n\nSave the drama for the screen with TODAY.com’s selection of 85 of the best movies to watch as a family.\n\nClassics, such as “Freaky Friday” and “Home Alone,” round out newer movies, like “Barbie” and “Wonka.”\n\nWe must warn you, though — some of the movies may lead to tears. TODAY’s Jenna Bush Hager watched “Barbie” with her youngest daughter, Poppy, who was 7 at the time, and said she was “weeping.”\n\n“I cried, and I know I’m an easy crier,” Jenna said on “TODAY on Hoda and Jenna” in July 2023, adding that she, “cried multiple times.” “It’s beautiful.”\n\nAlthough it’s rated PG-13, Jenna said the movie would have been suitable for Hoda’s daughter, Haley, who was 6 at the time of its release.\n\n“There is a lot of talk about what is underneath the Barbie skirt,” she said. “I've always wondered about that, but most of that goes over her head, so it doesn’t matter.”\n\nContinue reading for more tearjerkers — and other options that are less likely to make you cry.\n\nMovies for families with teenagers\n\n'School of Rock' (2003)\n\n“School of Rock” features Jack Black as Dewey Finn, a down-on-his-luck musician who poses as a substitute teacher at an elite preparatory school after being ousted from his own rock band. Under the guise of Mr. Schneebly, Dewey forms a band with his students to compete in a Battle of the Bands, planning to use the prize money to cover his rent.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Barbie' (2023)\n\n“Barbie,” starring Margot Robbie in the title role, is a sharp-witted musical comedy that explores Barbie’s existential crisis as she ventures into the human world to discover her purpose and identity. And Ken, portrayed by Ryan Gosling, is there, too. As the saying goes, “She’s everything. He’s just Ken.”\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Mean Girls' (2004)\n\nThe Plastics — Regina George, Gretchen Wieners and Karen Smith — recruit newbie Cady Heron into their clique at school. On the surface, they're friends. But underneath, they secretly plot against each other.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Miss Juneteenth' (2020)\n\nIn this drama, a former beauty pageant winner and single mom prepares her rebellious daughter for her first pageant. “Miss Juneteenth” shows the joys and sorrows of Black motherhood and girlhood in a new and refreshing way.\n\nRating: TV-MA\n\n'Fighting With My Family' (2019)\n\nPerfect for watching with teenagers, “Fighting With My Family” is the story of an English family who lives and breathes wrestling, and what happens when two of the children are invited to try out to be part of WWE.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Thor: Love and Thunder' (2022)\n\nThor is one of the few remaining original Avengers and in the last ensemble movie, “Avengers: Endgame,” Thor struggles with maintaining his mental health and aimlessly joins the Guardians of the Galaxy due to lack of other options. “Thor: Love and Thunder” picks up here, and apparently Thor has turned things around and is working on something big.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'The Fabelmans' (2022)\n\nIt only takes one inspirational experience to completely change the direction of a kid’s life. Director Steven Spielberg had that moment in “The Fabelmans,” an award-winning film that shows how he first fell in love with movies and how, step-by-step, he became the beloved director he is today. The Oscar nominated movie may inspire the young people in your life to follow their dreams.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Good Will Hunting' (1997)\n\n“Good Will Hunting” is a classic starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Robin Williams. Will (Damon) and Chuckie (Affleck) are bootstrapping their way through life in a run down Boston neighborhood, often fighting their way through troubles. Will works as a janitor at MIT and a professor discovers Will is a young prodigy who should be in college, not on the streets. The movie follows Will as he tries to reach his potential while also figuring out what he wants to do, not what the professor is forcing on him.\n\nRating: R\n\n'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' (2023)\n\n“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” finally answers the questions that previous Marvel movies have teased regarding what’s actually in the quantum realm and how did Ant-Man’s mother-in-law survive down there for 30 years. In the movie, the superhero’s teenage daughter gets them, Hope (her dad’s wife) and her grandparents all sucked into the quantum realm, which leads to a lot of arguments. But throughout the movie, they find common ground and she ends up saving the day.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Elf' (2003)\n\n“Elf” is a classic starring Will Ferrell (Buddy), who plays a human raised by Santa’s elves before journeying to New York City to meet his biological father. Leaving the North Pole is hard, but so is bringing its culture to the big apple, so Buddy has to decide who he is in this new city.\n\nRating: PG\n\n'Jerry Maguire' (1996)\n\nThe title character in “Jerry Maguire” is a knuckle-busting sports agent who suddenly has a change of heart and wants to do things the right way. He’s fired over it, and only one person at the company, a single mother, leaves with him and they start a new company together. They somehow manage to fall in love despite losing clients, money and Jerry’s less than warm words at times.\n\nRating: R\n\n'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' (2023)\n\nMultiverses is the name of the game in Marvel's world these days. In \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,\" Miles Morales, who is Spider-Man in the comic book, is thrown to the multiverse. Shameik Moore stars as Miles; Daniel Kaluuya and Issa Rae also star.\n\nRating: PG\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' (2022)\n\n\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" is a eulogy to King T'Challa and his original actor, Chadwick Boseman, who died in 2020. It's also a celebration of Wakandans coming together and finding their new leader as they thwart off new attacks.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Flamin' Hot' (2023)\n\nIs \"Flamin' Hot\" based on a true story? The movie supposedly tells the tale of how a janitor created the Flamin' Hot Cheetos flavor, which is disputed by Frito-Lay. But the movie still has lessons to share.\n\nRating: PG-3\n\n'Draft Day' (2014)\n\nKevin Costner and the last Chadwick Boseman star in \"Draft Day,\" the story of how Costner's character, Sonny Weaver Jr., landed the No. 1 draft pick for the NFL's Cleveland Browns in a true uphill battle. Boseman plays Vontae Mack, who Sonny wants to draft, but he has no support from his team to do it since they think there are better players available.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Freaky Friday' (2003)\n\n\"Freaky Friday\" is a classic starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis as mother and daughter who just are not seeing eye-to-eye. They literally have to walk in each other's shoes to have empathy and more respect for each other.\n\nRating: PG\n\n'Coach Carter' (2005)\n\nSamuel L. Jackson plays the title character in “Coach Carter,” a classic film that shows what a high school basketball team can do when their coach believes in them and is a great teacher. Their city, Richmond, California, needs something to believe in and some good news to share. The high school’s potential boy’s basketball championship would be perfect.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\n'Honk for Jesus' (2022)\n\nSterling K. Brown and Regina Hall shine in “Honk For Jesus,” a parody that points out double standards related to the institution of the church and the pros and cons of being a part of mega churches or smaller, local churches.\n\nRating: R\n\n'Unchartered' (2020)\n\n“Uncharted” is a modern day treasure hunt. Two orphaned brothers (Tom Holland and Mark Walhberg) join forces to stop a corrupt billionaire from finding the treasure before they do. But the treasure is hidden and most people don’t think it exist at all, so the friends have their work cut out for them.\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMovies for families with middle grade kids\n\n'Wonka' (2023)\n\nDrawing from the character in Roald Dahl's 1964 children’s novel, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “Wonka” serves as the origin story for eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka, played by Timothée Chalamet. It chronicles the journey of a young Willy Wonka, who attempts to establish his first chocolate shop amidst competition from rival chocolatiers.\n\nRating: PG\n\n'Sky High' (2005)\n\nEvery student in “Sky High” has super powers. Their high school trains them to use their skills — an investment that proves useful when their school comes under attack.\n\nRating: PG\n\n'Akeelah and the Bee' (2006)\n\nKeke Palmer, Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishbourne star in this classic about students from different socioeconomic backgrounds and high schools competing in spelling bees.
