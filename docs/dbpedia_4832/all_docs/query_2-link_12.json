        "text": "A Maine banker convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover in 1947 gradually forms a friendship over a quarter century with a hardened convict, while maintaining his innocence and trying to remain hopeful through simple compassion.\n\nWho'd have thought a story by Stephen King, more over a short story, would do so well both commercially and critically? Well, this is what you get when you get Frank Darabont to direct a movie with Morgan Freeman in it.\n\nBiased here. Not everybody loves this movie, but it's on the top of my watch list purely because of the rawness and emotion of the scenes with long strips of conversation. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's screenwriting debut, which they co-won an Oscar for. If only Titanic did not completely eclipse this movie in 1997, this movie would have\n\nwon much more than the 4 academy awards than it did.\n\nThe history of the United States from the 1950s to the '70s unfolds from the perspective of an Alabama man with an IQ of 75, who yearns to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart.\n\nOk, many people would find this movie weird, because of its weird chronological sequence and generally random themes and events that don't really connect or have significance as a whole. Well that's the point here. Narrowing down on scenes and having long, conversational scenes where gangsters discuss philosophical ideas isn't what you'd usually expect of them. Not to mention Samuel Jackson's Oscar-Worthy acting. Tarantino's best.\n\nKevin Spacey's voice is probably my most favorite voice in the world. He has just the right tinge of timbre in a background of this alto voice that is exceptionally soothing. The theme of this movie is not what you'd expect it to be, and the turning point appears gradually, ending off in an ultimate climax with, again, Spacey's voice as the backdrop of the finale.\n\nI had nightmares for 3 days after watching this. Don't use that as an excuse not to watch it though. It's excellent, really.\n\nI watched this again recently and I realised what I wrote above doesn't do much justice to the movie. The scenes are beautiful; the way the memories were removed were extremely well thought out, the slow fading of the details from the backgrounds were the little facts I loved about the movie. I should probably move this up to my top 5. Yes, I should.\n\nThe second of Stephen King's works to make it big commercially and critically. Frank Durabont should really be the only one allowed to make his books into movies, with the success of The Shawshank Redemption.\n\nOfficially the most disturbing movie I've ever watched. This would not have been without the excellent cinematography and lightings. Although you'd think a movie discouraging the use of drugs by showing its terrible effects would deter the individual, it made me want to try them even more. JK, heh.\n\nJust why this movie is so unknown and underrated, I don't know. What I know is that Jonathan Nolan is equally, if not, more talented than his older brother for coming up with a plot so elaborate, perfect and thought provoking 10 years before Inception. The brothers were already *beep* people since the beginning of the 21st Century and only got found out after Inception.\n\nThis really seals the deal of me being a complete Tarantino fan I mean... I just love all his works and I can't find any redundant scene in this one, as well as his other works. Favourite scene would be the bar scene of course - \"Say auf wiedersehen to your nazi balls\" LOL I could watch that a million times over\n\nTarantino does it again with his spaghetti western style incorporated into a very realistic take on the slavery situation in the states before the civil war. Christof Waltz does an amazing job again with his meticulous (I would like to hear him say that word in character) acting and attention to every single action or word he says. And you'd love tarantino's cameo in this one\n\nAnd Vol. 2 as well (Counting the both of them as one movie for the purpose of this list)\n\nTarantino... I should just stop there. You see the trend\n\nVincent, an \"In-Valid\", assumes the identity of a member of the genetic elite to pursue his goal of traveling into space with the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. However, a week before his mission, a murder marks Vincent as a suspect.\n\nHighly underrated sci-fi movie that first explored the complex nature of identity theft and DNA manipulation. I love how detailed it got at some parts; they really didn't overlook much. I still wonder why it never got the fame it deserved.\n\nThis is the only movie in which I have seen the concept of sadomasochism and BDSM explored. It is really quite disturbing in a way but so artistic and absorbing that you just lose yourself in the movie. And the main actor looked like Thom Yorke of Radiohead, if that's a bonus.\n\nOne of Ryan Gosling's arthouse films that allowed me to conclude that this man is a real showman and deserves much more admiration and fame that he, of course, already has\n\nI'll be honest with you - this was the movie that surprised me at the most random moments; Colin firth's excellent Irish drawl fits in with his funny villain persona that he pulls off excellently. And you'd want to visit Bruges after watching this movie.\n\nRaw, refreshing and real. I can't put into words how well Gosling and Williams acted in their roles, it's one of the few moments I feel as though I'm watching characters living their lives rather than actors acting as characters. Brilliant screenplay and touching scenes. Top 5.\n\nI'm only 20 mins into this movie and I'm loving it. The delivery is flawlessly deadpan and hilarious at the same time, I don't know what to make of it. Cameras are perfect too, every best matches in with each motion and screenplay couldn't be better. Extremely relevant scenes and done in a very \"indie\" way, of course.\n\n\"my funny... Valentine...\" the eerie music always seeps into my head when I think about this movie. One of Matt Damon's best and again, underrated movie that deserves more light. Philip Seymour Hoffman's in it too, if that's a bonus."
