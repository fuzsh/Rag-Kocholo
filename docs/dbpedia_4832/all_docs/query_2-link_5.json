[More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#4\n\nThelma & Louise (1991) 86%\n\n#4\n\nAdjusted Score: 100427%\n\nCritics Consensus: Driven by ride-or-die chemistry between Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon while director Ridley Scott provides scorching visuals fit for a postcard, Thelma & Louise is a feminist adventure that's equal parts provocative and rollicking.\n\nSynopsis: Meek housewife Thelma (Geena Davis) joins her friend Louise (Susan Sarandon), an independent waitress, on a short fishing trip. However,... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#5\n\nThe Last Duel (2021) 85%\n\n#5\n\nAdjusted Score: 99935%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Last Duel's critique of systemic misogyny isn't as effective as it might have been, but it remains a well-acted and thought-provoking drama infused with epic grandeur.\n\nSynopsis: The Last Duel is a cinematic and thought-provoking drama set in the midst of the Hundred Years War that explores... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#6\n\nAmerican Gangster (2007) 81%\n\n#6\n\nAdjusted Score: 89667%\n\nCritics Consensus: American Gangster is a gritty and entertaining throwback to classic gangster films, with its lead performers firing on all cylinders.\n\nSynopsis: Frank Lucas earns his living as a chauffeur to one of Harlem's leading mobsters; after his boss dies, Frank uses... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#7\n\nGladiator (2000) 80%\n\n#7\n\nAdjusted Score: 90912%\n\nCritics Consensus: While not everyone will be entertained by Gladiator's glum revenge story, Russell Crowe thunderously wins the crowd with a star-making turn that provides Ridley Scott's opulent resurrection of Rome its bruised heart.\n\nSynopsis: Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) takes power and strips rank from Maximus (Russell Crowe), one of the favored generals of his predecessor... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#8\n\n#8\n\nAdjusted Score: 93296%\n\nCritics Consensus: All the Money in the World offers an absorbing portrayal of a true story, brought compellingly to life by a powerful performance from Christopher Plummer.\n\nSynopsis: In 1973, kidnappers demand $17 million from billionaire J. Paul Getty in exchange for his grandson's release. Getty refuses to... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#9\n\nBlack Hawk Down (2001) 77%\n\n#9\n\nAdjusted Score: 83268%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though it's light on character development and cultural empathy, Black Hawk Down is a visceral, pulse-pounding portrait of war, elevated by Ridley Scott's superb technical skill.\n\nSynopsis: The film takes place in 1993 when the U.S. sent special forces into Somalia to destabilize the government and bring... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#10\n\nPrometheus (2012) 73%\n\n#10\n\nAdjusted Score: 88271%\n\nCritics Consensus: Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to Alien may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances -- particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android.\n\nSynopsis: The discovery of a clue to mankind's origins on Earth leads a team of explorers to the darkest parts of... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#11\n\nThe Duellists (1977) 74%\n\n#11\n\nAdjusted Score: 80327%\n\nCritics Consensus: Rich, stylized visuals work with effective performances in Ridley Scott's take on Joseph Conrad's Napoleonic story, resulting in an impressive feature film debut for the director.\n\nSynopsis: Armand d'Hubert (Keith Carradine) and Gabriel Féraud (Harvey Keitel) are French soldiers under Napoleon. A trivial quarrel between d'Hubert and... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#12\n\nNapoleon (2023) 58%\n\n#12\n\nAdjusted Score: 77424%\n\nCritics Consensus: Ridley Scott is intent on proving the emperor has no clothes in Napoleon, a slyly funny epic with bravura set pieces and a divided runtime that keeps it from outright conquering.\n\nSynopsis: \"Napoleon\" is a spectacle-filled action epic that details the checkered rise and fall of the iconic French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte,... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#13\n\nAlien: Covenant (2017) 65%\n\n#13\n\nAdjusted Score: 87911%\n\nCritics Consensus: Alien: Covenant delivers another satisfying round of close-quarters deep-space terror, even if it doesn't take the saga in any new directions.\n\nSynopsis: Bound for a remote planet on the far side of the galaxy, members (Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup) of the colony... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#14\n\n#14\n\nAdjusted Score: 67232%\n\nCritics Consensus: Its plot is sometimes hard to swallow, but some fine acting and director Ridley Scott's stylish visual flair make Someone to Watch Over Me an engaging police thriller.\n\nSynopsis: After Manhattan socialite Claire Gregory (Mimi Rogers) witnesses her friend's murder at the hands of Joey Venza (Andreas Katsulas), a... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#15\n\nHouse of Gucci (2021) 62%\n\n#15\n\nAdjusted Score: 81157%\n\nCritics Consensus: House of Gucci vacillates between inspired camp and dour drama too often to pull off a confident runway strut, but Lady Gaga's note-perfect performance has a timeless style all its own.\n\nSynopsis: House of Gucci is inspired by the shocking true story of the family behind the Italian fashion empire. When Patrizia... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#16\n\nWhite Squall (1996) 57%\n\n#16\n\nAdjusted Score: 58960%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though it gets occasionally bogged down by touchy-feely sentiment, White Squall benefits greatly from Jeff Bridges' assured lead performance and Ridley Scott's visceral, exciting direction.\n\nSynopsis: In 1960, a hardy group of prep school students boards an old-fashioned sailing ship. With Capt. Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges)... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#17\n\nBody of Lies (2008) 56%\n\n#17\n\nAdjusted Score: 64707%\n\nCritics Consensus: Body of Lies relies on the performances of Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio to elevate it beyond the conventional espionage thriller.\n\nSynopsis: CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) hatches a bold but dangerous plan to capture terrorist Al-Saleem.

[More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#19\n\nG.I. Jane (1997) 53%\n\n#19\n\nAdjusted Score: 54927%\n\nCritics Consensus: Demi Moore admirably does her duty, but G.I. Jane's well-intentioned message is obscured by stylistic bombast and an overload of jingoism.\n\nSynopsis: In response to political pressure from Senator Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft), the U.S. Navy begins a program that would allow... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#20\n\nRobin Hood (2010) 44%\n\n#20\n\nAdjusted Score: 54409%\n\nCritics Consensus: Ridley Scott's revisionist take on this oft-told tale offers some fine acting and a few gripping action sequences, but it's missing the thrill of adventure that made Robin Hood a legend in the first place.\n\nSynopsis: After the death of Richard the Lion-Hearted, a skilled archer named Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) travels to Nottingham, where villagers... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#21\n\nLegend (1985) 41%\n\n#21\n\nAdjusted Score: 44870%\n\nCritics Consensus: Not even Ridley Scott's gorgeously realized set pieces can save Legend from its own tawdry tale -- though it may be serviceable for those simply looking for fantasy eye candy.\n\nSynopsis: Darkness (Tim Curry) seeks to create eternal night by destroying the last of the unicorns. Jack (Tom Cruise) and his... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#22\n\nKingdom of Heaven (2005) 40%\n\n#22\n\nAdjusted Score: 46978%\n\nCritics Consensus: Although it's an objective and handsomely presented take on the Crusades, Kingdom of Heaven lacks depth.\n\nSynopsis: Still in grief over his wife's sudden death, village blacksmith Balian (Orlando Bloom) joins his long-estranged father, Baron Godfrey (Liam... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#23\n\nHannibal (2001) 39%\n\n#23\n\nAdjusted Score: 45143%\n\nCritics Consensus: While superbly acted and stylishly filmed, Hannibal lacks the character interaction between the two leads which made the first movie so engrossing.\n\nSynopsis: Seven years have passed since Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) escaped from custody. The doctor is now at large in... [More]\n\nDirected By: Ridley Scott\n\n#24\n\nThe Counselor (2013) 34%\n\n#24\n\nAdjusted Score: 44064%\n\nCritics Consensus: The Counselor raises expectations with its talented cast and creative crew -- then subverts them with a wordy and clumsy suspense thriller that's mercilessly short on suspense or thrills.\n\nSynopsis: A Bentley-driving Texas lawyer (Michael Fassbender) appears to have it all, including a beautiful fiancee named Laura (Penélope Cruz) --...
