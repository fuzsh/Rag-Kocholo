Make sure to have the remote close by for those “gotta watch again” moments, and get ready to be sucked into one of these classic series.\n\n1. Salt Fat Acid Heat\n\nNew York Times Magazine’s food columnist and culinary expert Samin Norsat really, really loves food. In her Netflix series, she travels around the world to discover how different cultures incorporate the four main flavors (salt, fat, acid, heat) essential to great tasting dishes. From Italy to Japan to her home in Berkley California, Norsat’s lighthearted and enthusiastic personality makes following her around the world fun, and she might even convince you to try something new in your own kitchen. Warning: this show will make you hungry, so be prepared to relax with some snacks of your own.\n\n2. Derry Girls\n\nSet in Northern Ireland during the tumultuous 1990’s, Derry Girls follows a group of teenage girls (seemingly) more concerned with surviving high school than the political conflict that surrounds them. Their day to day adventures are the perfect blend of quirky, heart-warming, and irreverent, and you’ll find yourself feeling both charmed and mortified on their behalf. This is the perfect show to binge watch during a sick day when your own kids are away at school, allowing you can laugh freely at the misdeeds of fictional teenagers getting in and out of all sorts of hilarious trouble.\n\n3. The Good Place\n\nTurns out life after death can be a little awkward. And hilarious! When Eleanor Shellstrop dies in a freak grocery-cart accident, she finds herself in \"The Good Place,\" where frozen yogurt is always available, and everyone gets a perfect soulmate. Except, Eleanor didn't exactly live a life worthy of eternal bliss. Turns out she was kind of a jerk, and she's taken someone else's rightful spot. Somehow, she'll have to figure out how to navigate heaven without raising to much he**.\n\nWe promise you'll laugh your ash off, even on your worst sick day. (Fun fact: there's no forking swearing in \"The Good Place.\") Go from laughing so hard your stomach hurts to deep, methodical thoughts with The Good Place. Starring Ted Dansen and Kristen Bell, you’ll be in love with the twists and turns this comedy has to offer.\n\n4. Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?\n\nShe’s back! This animated reboot of the 1990’s cult classic is better than ever, and the perfect show to watch if you’re binge watching with a sick big kid or pre-teen. (Especially when the alternative might be watching a series of inane YouTube stars film themselves eating cereal…) Clever, full of great jokes, and chock-full of girl-power, you might find yourself watching some episodes on your own, no sick kids necessary. It really is that fun.\n\n5. One Day at a Time\n\nNetflix is killing it in the reboot department, and this revival of a beloved 1970’s sitcom is no exception. The series follows Penelope, an army veteran and single mom living with her feisty mother and two teenage kids. While the subject matter might feel complicated—the series addresses issues like divorce, parenting, and the elusive pursuit of work/life balance— the stellar cast and pitch-perfect jokes make this show a family-friendly favorite you can indulge in without guilt.\n\n6. Cobra Kai\n\nIf you are a fan of the original Karate Kid, you’re in for a real treat. Now is the time to binge Cobra Kai, a Netflix original. See all your favorite characters in a new light coupled with 80s references galore.\n\n7. Kim’s Convenience\n\nFrom being sick to having a bad day, Kim’s Convenience is one to make you laugh. Everyone can relate to the different family dynamics of the Kim family while appreciating the comical dialogue on top of it.\n\nBrighten Up Someone’s Sick Day\n\nIf you’ve got a far-away friend who’s on the mend, why not deliver a box of handcrafted chicken noodle soup, grandma’s homemade rolls, and a package of chocolate chip cookies straight to his or her front door?
