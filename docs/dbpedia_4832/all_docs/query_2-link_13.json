        "text": "Jay Althouse : Classic Jazz A Cappella\n\nHere's a collection of three song each from three of the greatest songwriters of the classic jazz song - Gershwin, Porter and Ellington. Highly-regarded arranger Jay Althouse offers some stunning, tight, and tasty harmonies for unaccompanied mixed voices that can be performed separately or as three different sets by composer.\n\nSonglist: A Cole Porter Jazz Trio, Just One Of Those Things, You Do Something To Me, An Ellington Jazz Trio, Solitude, It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), A Gershwin Jazz Trio, I Got Rhythm, Someone to Watch Over Me, Night and Day, Satin Doll, Nice Work If You Can Get It\n\nVoicing: SATB | 7683b | Sheet Music Collection | $6.95 | A Cappella\n\nVarious Arrangers : Jazz Standards\n\nThe classic Vincent Youman song \"Without a Song\" has delighted audiences for decades and has been recorded by artists of every genre. Kirby Shaw has added his superior arranging talent to provide us with a truly wonderful new arrangement. You don't even have to hear this arrangement of \"My Funny Valentine\" to know how good it is, because it already has the top two ingredients: 1) a great tune, and 2) one of the best arrangers around. Kirby has taken one of the most gorgeous ballads of our time and crafted a special arrangement that's bound to please. \"Skylark\" - A superbly crafted a cappella rendition of the all-time Hoagy Carmichael favorite standard, carefully woven to ensure logical voice leading for each vocal part. The arrangement smoothly flows from one lush harmony to another, each locked into the surrounding sounds, creating a tightly knit fabric of pure vocal pleasure. Stunning! Kirby Shaw's tradition for creating exceptional a cappella ballads continues with this wonderful arrangement of the Gershwin classic \"Embraceable You.\" Showcase your singers with this very special arrangement!\n\nSonglist: Embraceable You, Misty, My Funny Valentine, Skylark, Someone to Watch Over Me, Without a Song, Days of Wine and Roses\n\nVoicing: SATB | 4724b | Sheet Music Collection | $12.95 | A Cappella\n\nVarious Arrangers : Classic Ballads\n\nYour jazz, show, and concert choirs will all sound fantastic singing this classic Gershwin ballad \"But Not for Me\". This new a cappella arrangement offers beautiful lush harmonies with a female solo feature. Closes with one of Ira's most creative lyrics: \"But there's no knot for me.\" The expressive ballad \"When I Fall in Love\" has been expertly arranged for a cappella mixed voices. A classic song plus a classic setting equals a memorable performance experience for all. Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's Hawaiian-style \"Over the Rainbow\" has become a prevalent part of today's popular music. Performed in Glee's first season finale by Matthew Morrison and Mark Salling, the unique setting has been sung by several American Idol contestants and featured in many TV shows and movies. In this creative arrangement, a divisi choir accompanies the soloist, duet, or small group, performing a cappella or with optional piano, ukulele, or guitar. \"The More I See You\" - Originally released in 1945, this standard continues to touch hearts. Langford's advanced vocal jazz setting, dividing into multiple voice parts, really brings the melody and lyrics to life. Worth the rehearsal time! \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" - Originally written as an up-tempo number for the musical Oh Kay!, Ira convinced George that it was better as a ballad. The lush, challenging harmonies in this arrangement prove that Ira was right!\n\nSonglist: But Not for Me, When I Fall in Love, Over the Rainbow, The More I See You, Someone to Watch Over Me\n\nVoicing: SATB | 8318b | Sheet Music Collection | $9.95\n\nGeorge and Ira Gershwin : Nice Work If You Can Get It\n\nThis musical featuring the music of George and Ira Gershwin opened on Broadway in 2012 starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara.

Artistic directors Jacquelyn Norman and Wendy Gee conduct them in this rich collection of 23 lightly accompanied songs. Favorites are the title tune, whose lyrics are from the nursery rhyme, \"Ride a cock horse to Banbury cross,\" Darla Eshelman's \"A Song from the Heart,\" Z. Randall Stroope's \"The Poet Sings,\" Bob Chilcott's \"The Lily and the Rose,\" Ed Robertson's \"Sing a Song,\" Eugene Butler's \"Music is My Life,\" Ruth Morris Gray's lilting, humorous \"No Thank You, John,\" Ella Fitzgerald's \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket,\" the Gershwins' \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" Billy Joel's \"Lullabye\" and Smokey Robinson's \"My Guy.\" This is a poised, confident collection by one of the finest young women's ensembles in the world, beautiful, entertaining and moving.\n\nSonglist: She Shall Have Music, To Be Young, A Song From The Heart, Think On Me, The Poet Sings, Dirait-On, The Lily And The Rose, Come To Me O My Love, Sing A Song, One Song, Just A Single Voice, Music Is My Life, He's Gone Away, Banks Of Doon, No Thank You John, Joan Of Arc, Give Us Hope, A-Tisket A-Tasket, Someone To Watch Over Me, Lullaby, Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, My Guy, Ma (He's Making Eyes At Me)\n\n8599c | 1 CD | $15.95 | Some a cappella\n\nBR6 : Here To Stay\n\nWe raved over five-man, one woman BR6's debut recording, \"Rio A Cappella,\" and have been eagerly waiting for their second. First let us praise the marvelous, Beatles-flavored graphics and photos in the liner notes, some of the best we've ever seen, and a perfect complement to the smooth, latin sound the group applies to one of our all-time favorite tunes, George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" medleyed with Tom Jobim's \"Waters of March.\" Continuing with a cool \"Jazz 'n' Samba,\" mellow and sweet \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" jazzy \"Water to Drink,\" and sassy, sexy \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" this is all pure enjoyment. Try to imagine faux, feline-sounding horns on \"Girl from Ipanema,\" a surprising, bluenote faux trumpet solo on \"Fascinating Rhythm,\" faux muted trumpets on a meandering \"Forever Green,\" \"They All Laughed,\" \"Song of the Jet,\" \"Love is Here to Stay ...this is all mellow, fun, jazzy, salsa-flavored stuff to be savored like musical fish tacos and margaritas on a perfect beach with the one you love!\n\nSonglist: Waters Of March / Rhapsody In Blue, Jazz'n'Samba, Someone to Watch Over Me, Water To Drink, They Can't Take That Away From Me, The Girl From Impanema, Fascinating Rhythm, Forever Green, They All Laughed, Song Of The Jet, Love Is Here To Stay, Pato Preto\n\n7634c | 1 CD | $16.95 | A Cappella\n\nCabinet Shuffle : In Cambridge... Again!\n\nBritish mixed sextet (2 women, 4 men) Cabinet Shuffle has been singing top-drawer a cappella in many of the classiest venues in England, for a Who's Who of corporate and professional clients. With clean, tight harmonies and sweet leads reminiscent of the Swingles and Manhattan Transfer, and a varied repertoire from Bach to the Beatles and Josquin to Jazz, the Shuffle are crowd-pleasers extraordinaire! Their recordings (their first, the excellent \"It Don't Mean A Thing,\" \"Cambridge\" is #2) are equally crisp, elegant and entertaining. Beginning with two winners, \"New York\" and the heart-tugger \"Loch Lomond,\" we are then treated to a vocal feast: the traditional Italian tune \"Bella Calou,\" Billy Joel's \"And So It Goes\" and \"The Longest Time,\" Gershwin's \"Someone to Watch Over Me,\" Harold Arlen's \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" \"Bring Him Home,\" John Denver's \"Perhaps Love,\" and Lerner and Loewe's \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" are all delightful. It's all good, and we think that this talented group is ready for a much wider audience and some larger venues, especially over here \"across the pond!\"\n\nSonglist: New York, Loch Lomond, The Three Ravens, Malaguena, Bella Caiou, Le Baylere, And So It Goes, Pavane, A Nightinsgale Sang In Berkeley Square, Someone To Watch Over Me, Somewhere Over The Rainbow, I Won't Send Roses, I Dreamed A Dream, Bring Him Home, I Could Have Danced All Night, The Longest Time, Chansom d'Amour, Perhaps Love, If You Leave Me Now, Come FLy With Me\n\n4666c | 1 CD | $15.98 | A Cappella\n\nCity Lights : With A Wink And A Smile\n\nThe star-spangled \"City Lights,\" from the Garden State, 1992 Sweet Adelines International Champions, have returned with their third CD. Whether it's a plaintive ballad, such as \"Little Girl Blue,\" originally done by the 1957 champion Cracker Jills, and arranged by the legendary Renee Craig, or Gershwin's \"Someone To Watch Over Me,\" the sassy \"Hit That Jive, Jack,\" with it's horn fills and athletic bass line (arranged by Greg Volk), or even City Lights' version of the Aretha classic, \"Respect,\" each song is approached with the same concentration of musicality, originality and elegance.\n\nSonglist: Cornet Man, Jazzman's Serenade, The Colour of My Love, A Wink And a Smile, Little Girl Blue, Hit That Jive Jack, Dayton, Ohio - 1903, All Dressed Up With a Broken Heart, Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams, Respect, Someone to Watch Over Me, Thank You World\n\n5156c | 1 CD | $14.98 | A Cappella\n\nFour Lads : Breezin' Along / On The Sunny Side\n\nThe Four Lads transition from singing together as Canadian choir boys, to stardom at New York's Le Ruban Bleu, to being voted America's favorite vocal group, is the stuff of music industry legend, but it's their fresh, jazzy, exuberant sound that we're interested in. Blessing again the record executive who first combined two classic lps on one CD for the price of one, we have 24 tracks here, all orchestrally accompanied, but the emphasis is on the four amazing singers. On \"Breezin',\" are songs like \"That Old Feeling,\" \"Someone Like You,\" \"Long Ago (And Far Away),\" \"Someone To Watch Over Me,\" \"Come To Me\" and \"A Lovely Way To Spend An Evening.\" On \"Sunny,\" there's \"The Things We Did Last Summer,\" \"Bidin' My Time,\" \"Makin' Whoopee\" \"Dancing In The Dark,\" \"Lazy River,\" and \"Side By Side.\" A generous helping of the Lads' contagiously jazzy, 60s nightclub sound!\n\nSonglist: Breezin' Along With The Breeze, That Old Feeling, Swingin' Down The Lane, Someone Like You, You Were Meant For Me, Hit The Road to Dreamland, Long Ago (And Far Away), That's My Desire, Someone To Watch Over Me, I'll String Along With You, Come To Me, A Loverly Way To Spend An Evening, On The Sunny Side Of The Street, The Things We Did Last Summer, Taking A Chance On Love, Biden' My Time, Makin' Whoopee, Sentimental Journey, These Foolish Things, Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams, Dancing in the Dark, Lazy River, The Way You Look Tonight, Side By Side\n\n4472c | 1 CD | $14.98 | Accompanied\n\nFred Waring and his Pennsylvanians : Sentimental Journey\n\nCalled \"the man who taught America how to sing\" Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians were a fixture on radio in the '40's and '50's and these 23 songs were recorded in 1949 and 1950 when at the height of their popularity. The group, including the instrumentalists, was over 50 members strong and sing beautifully some of the classic songs from the era. The arrangements were from some of the top choral arrangers in the country such as Roy Ringwold and Harry Simeone. A great trip down memory lane.\n\nSonglist: I Hear Music, I Feel A Song Comin' On, Sentimental Journey, Here I'll Stay, Country Style, Someone to Watch Over Me, I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Japanese Sandman, Moonlight and Roses, Runnin' Wild, April Showers, The Continental, Somebody Loves Me, Ballynure Ballad, Temptation, Ain't Misbehavin, It's Only A Paper Moon, I Only Have Eyes for You, Riders in the Sky, Hit the Road to Dreamland, Roumanian Rhapsody, What Makes the Sunset, Sleep\n\n4444c | 1 CD | $14.98 | Accompanied\n\nGlad : A Cappella Gershwin\n\nGlad began as a progressive Christian rock band in the early seventies. Rich complex arrangements and lush vocal melodies have been their trademark. Each of their early albums had one a cappella tune included. As an experiment, in 1988, they recorded the A Cappella Project which was received with such enthusiasm that they have been alternating instrumental accompaniment with a cappella albums ever since. Glad singing Gershwin is a total treat. All the standards are here \"I've Got Rhythm,\" \"The Girl I Love,\" \"Someone To Watch Over Me\" etc. To this reviewer \"The Gershwin Medley\" is nothing short of fabulous!\n\nSonglist: I Got Rhythm, The Girl I Love, Our Love Is Here To Stay, Embraceable You, The Gershwin Medley, They All Laughed, A Foggy Day (In London Town), Little Jazz Bird, But Not For Me, They Can't Take That Away From Me, Someone To Watch Over Me\n\n4404c | 1 CD | $14.98 | A Cappella\n\nHigh Society : Celebrating High Society - A Musical Journey\n\nLegendary foursome High Society's (Connie Noble, Kim Hulbert, Sandy Shelver and Pat Vozza) being named Sweet Adelines International Quartet Champions in 1976 led to a long, wonderful career, with concerts all over North America, a USO Tour and four top-selling albums, \"High Society,\" \"On the Road Again,\" \"By Design\" and \"Fascinatin'.\" For all their loyal fans over the years, and for those who have never had the chance to savor the buttery harmonies, sweet leads and ringing, hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck-tingling held chords of one of Sweet Adelines' all-time great champions, we would highly recommend \"Celebrating High Society.\" A 2-CD collection of 51 tunes, \"Celebrating\" leaves none of the good stuff out, including every song on their four best-selling albums!

In 1988 they released \"Take 6\" nationally, and won Grammies for both best Jazz and best Gospel group.

Take 6's Contemporary Christian material is also included, the autobiographical \"Back to You,\" a bluenote a cappella \"Shall We Gather at the River\" and the lovely, wordless, accompanied \"Grace.\" Wow.
