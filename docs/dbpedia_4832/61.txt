Single, married, or fresh off a breakup—there's a film about relationships for you.

The best romantic movies are the ones that you can watch over and over again, even when they hit a little too close to home. That's because whether you’re single, in a new relationship, divorced, or something in between, there are so many movies about relationships that reflect every stage of your love life—past, present, and future.

While we can’t promise that watching these love stories will help you solve any current relationship problems you might have, we can tell you that you’ll be able to relate to at least one. Whether it's Rose's goodbye to Jack in Titanic or that rain-kissing scene in The Notebook, there are some film moments that are so iconic they've transcended pop culture and have become part of the way we live and think about love. I mean, tell me you watched those couple interviews in When Harry Met Sally and didn't wish that would be you someday. You can't!

So see our picks for the best romantic movies, below, and enjoy. PS: Of course, not all love movies are winners. See our list of romantic comedies that probably never should have been made.
