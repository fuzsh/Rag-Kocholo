Overview

The Devil May Cry HD Collection is a compilation of the first three Devil May Cry games, remastered in high definition, and released on the PS3 and Xbox 360 on April 3, 2012. The collection includes Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 2, and the Special Edition version of Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening. These HD remasters see little change from their PS2 originals, the only differences of note being the reworking of DMC1's control layout to be closer to later games and the restoration of a unique set of taunts for coatless Dante in DMC3 that were cut from the original game before release.
