Media: video game: “Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening”

Developer: Capcom Production Studio 1

Platform: Computer, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One

Note: The game was later re-released as Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition, with extra features.

Description:

Mission 8, A Renewed Fear, begins with an action cinematic in which Dante runs down the side of the Temen-ni-gru tower while destroying demons. At the end of the cinematic, a giant airborne while-like creature known as Leviathan appears and swallows Dante whole.

The subsequent level takes place within Leviathan’s body, in which large structures and vehicles Leviathan had previously swallowed can be seen, including ships, cars and buildings. Stepping in pools of acid will cause Dante digestion damage.

Once the Heart of Leviathan has been destroyed, Dante will cut his way out of its body in a cinematic in the following mission.

Even if Dante’s costume is changed, he will be seen wearing the default costume in cinematics, as they are not dynamically generated. If playing as Vergil in the Special Edition of the game, Vergil will still go through the same levels as Dante, but cinematics that normally involve Dante will not play at all.
