(if I'm wrong tell me!)\n\nIf you want to go beyond the game and to \"break the rules\" and get a different gaming experience which would go beyond the classical game I think the best choice would to give the PC mods a try Both dmc 3 and 4 are available for PC, so like every PC game you can modify the content as you will if you know a few tricks, and if you don't you can always use stuff made by other people. You can find a lot of them here: http://s1.zetaboards.com/InfernalWorks/index/\n\n(we also have a DMC4 modding section on our forum but since you didn't mention this game and there aren't any mods that you can use yet I thought re-directing you outside the forum was a better idea)\n\nCopied from GFAQS (note some cheats disable saving/trophies)\n\nDMC2\n\nDante and Lucia's Diesel Costume\n\nPlay the First Mission and Save. Restart your game and at the ''Press Start Button Screen'', Press L3, R3, L1, R1, L2, R2, L3, R3. If you did it right, then you should hear a sound. Now select ''Load Game'' and you should be able to pick the Diesel Costume for whichever character you did the code for by Pressing R1 or L1 on the Load Screen.\n\nInfinite DT in Bloody Palace\n\nselect BP while holding R2,L2,R1,L1\n\nDMC3\n\nUnlock Everything\n\nTo unlock everything in the game (including game play modes, character costumes, galleries, etc) enter this code at the title screen.\n\nEffectCode\n\nUnlocks Everything Hold R1 + R2 + L1 + L2 + D-pad Up/Left + Left Analog-stick Down/Right"
