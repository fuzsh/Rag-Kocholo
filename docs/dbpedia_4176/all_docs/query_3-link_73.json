        "text": "Resident Evil 4, Onimusha 3: Demon Siege and Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition Coming to PCs Beginning February 2006\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – FEBRUARY 1, 2006 – Today Ubisoft, one of the world’s largest video game publishers, announced that it has signed an agreement with Capcom to distribute Resident Evil 4, Onimusha 3 and Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition video games for the PC. Ubisoft will distribute Capcom’s games in North American and European territories beginning in February 2006 with the release of Onimusha 3: Demon Siege.\n\n“Capcom has created fantastic universes which have become blockbuster franchises,” said Jay Cohen, vice president of publishing at Ubisoft. “Ubisoft is excited to be bringing three of the industry’s most innovative titles, including Resident Evil 4, which has been recognized by many publications and organizations as the best game of the year for 2005, to PC gamers around the world.”\n\nResident Evil 4 is a shining star in the survival horror genre garnering critical acclaim and numerous “Game of the Year” awards from media outlets including Game Informer magazine, North America’s largest gaming magazine and GameSpot.com, a leading source for gaming information. Onimusha 3: Demon Siege stars French actor Jean Reno and is the latest episode in the Onimusha franchise. This action adventure series has become a phenomenon thanks to its amazing backdrop in medieval Japan mixed with heroic fantasy elements. Devil May Cry made an outstanding debut on console and quickly became a popular action game. Renowned for its gothic atmosphere, non-stop action and thrilling combat, the latest installment to the franchise adds a new character a new boss and many new levels.\n\n“Capcom is excited to be taking advantage of Ubisoft’s global distribution network to deliver our hottest titles for gamers around the world to play and enjoy,” said Toshihiro Tokumaru, executive officer at Capcom. “We look forward to working together for continued growth for both companies.''\n\ngot this from Bluesnews.com\n\nalready have RE4 for the Gamecube, might look into Devil may cry myself\n\nWell most of Capcoms previous PC ports were the best versions available (RE1,2+3) until the GC ports so lets hope they do the same quality here. DMC3 is a killer PS2 game but not sure how well it will go down on the PC as the gameplay is a little limited after a while. Hopefully the pricing will not be too much as even RE4 whilst great for the PS2 because of the limited hardware will not be as impressive on the PC as the expectations are much higher.\n\nDavey_Pitch said:\n\nWell colour me surprised, I never thought I'd see any of those games appearing on the PC. It'll be interesting to see whether they're properly ported across, or just turn out to be poor ports like so many console->pc games we've seen in the past.\n\nAye hopefully it will be more like Riddick and less like Halo in terms of ports.\n\nI will definitely get 2 of them (already have DMC3 on PS2 and haven't played it)."
