Clearly it's old, but Obscure which is also for the PS2 also has better support. I just Buy the Original For the PS2 for a lot more Money. And for that I sacrificed one of my Favorite TF2 Hats. ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ I return the Game and buy myself a fancy Hat again. Did I have more of than to have it rammed into meienr Steam library."
