        "text": "Review: Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition - GeekTyrant\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is an action adventure hack and slash game. Each mission features you running around killing enemies with the occasional puzzle thrown in for good measure. You get points at the end of the mission based on how well you killed everything and even how stylish your killing was. This is where the skill comes in. You raise your style points by using combos and changing things up. The more you just use one move, the lower your style score. This rewards creativity. Now, while the Switch port is almost identical to other ports, there is a new feature called Freestyle Mode that fans will love and that’s the ability to change fighting style on the fly. This allows you to get even more creative with your combos as you can go from Swordmaster to Trickster to Gunslinger to Royalguard with simple button pushes. Honestly, it is this feature that will get veterans to care about this port. It’s a great feature and if you don’t want to use it, you don’t have to. When you start a new game, you can choose whether or not to use it."
