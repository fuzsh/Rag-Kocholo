        "text": "by: Travis -\n\nCapcom has announced that Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 2, and Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition will be released together in the Devil May Cry HD Collection on both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Following in the tradition of other HD releases, the games will include updated visuals and added support for trophies and achievements. For someone who didn't own a PS2 during the era of Devil May Cry, I'm quite excited to finally cross these games off my ever growing list of must play titles.\n\nDevil May Cry HD Collection will be available in early 2012 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for $39.99."
