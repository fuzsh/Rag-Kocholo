        "text": "The year is 2001, we’re wrapping up the first generation dominated by 3D games and ushering in the second. Over the past five or six years, games of all genres have made the leap to 3D, some more successfully than others. One genre that certainly did not have success was the beat-em-up. Enjoying a lot of popularity in the late 80s and early 90s, the melee combat focused genre practically vanished during late 90s. There were a few attempts to make 3D beat-em-ups (Perfect Weapon, Fighting Force, Die Hard Arcade) but they did not catch on and for the most part were considered very low quality. The genre seemed destined to vanish, it didn’t even have the type of hardcore niche community that shmups had and have.\n\nThen, in Fall 2001 (at least in the West), a game was released that changed everything. A game that showed the beat-em-up wasn’t in a coffin, but a cocoon about to burst open and reveal a new genre that took the concept farther than any could have imagined a decade earlier. The “character action game” genre (or that’s what I’m going to call it anyway, there was never a truly universal consensus on the name) was born, and the super-genre of action games would never be the same. And the game that caused all this was, of course, Devil May Cry. I’ve been with the series since the beginning and love the genre that it codified, so in honor of the long-awaited Devil May Cry 5, I’m going to do my first formal retrospective on the DMC series. So grab your pizza, get interrupted while eating it, and let’s rock, baby!\n\nProfessor Icepick here, just letting you know that despite the fact that I’ve passed the baton on retrospectives to KI this time, I’ll still be chiming in with my own thoughts on the series. While I’m not as much of a long-time fan of DMC as KI, I did recently play through every game in the series to prepare for DMC5. We’ll be seeing some similar thoughts from Dari, who also managed to recently plow through the first four games in the series.\n\nDevil May Cry\n\nOriginal Platform: Sony PlayStation 2\n\nRelease Dates: August 23rd, 2001 (JPN), October 16th, 2001 (NA), December 7th, 2001 (EU)\n\nHistory\n\nLike roughly half of Capcom’s sixth generation games, Devil May Cry started out its life as Resident Evil 4. In the late 90s, Hideki Kamiya was in charge of making Resident Evil 4 for the PlayStation 2, but it spiraled beyond the scope of the series. Kamiya wanted to make the protagonist of Resident Evil 4 more “heroic” and placed a stronger emphasis on action than the previous games. Shinji Mikami eventually stepped in, saying that the game was too much of a departure from the series. After all, Resident Evil is science fiction, there are limits to what enemies and characters can do. It was also a slower-paced survival horror series (yeah, it took quite a detour for a while), not the place for a protagonist to rapid fire infinite ammo dual pistols while slashing through demons with an electric sword. Thankfully, this did not kill the project, it was merely rebranded into a new IP. Switching the theme from science fiction to demonic invasion gave Team Little Devils all the freedom it needed to make the most ambitious action game to date, and in 2001 we saw the fruits of their labor.\n\nThe Story\n\n2,000 years ago, things weren’t going great for humans. Demons were plentiful and setting their sights on Earth, with no angelic forces in sight or possibly in existence. Luckily, a powerful demon named Sparda “awoke to justice” and fought the other demons, including their king Mundus. Sparda defeated Mundus and was successful in sealing off the demon world, thus saving humanity. At some point, he fell in love with a human woman named Eva, who gave birth to twin boys. Sparda died of… natural causes, I guess, while one of the twins “lost a mother and a brother to darkness” 20 years prior to the game. That twin, of course, was Dante. As the game begins, Dante is running a store (which shares its name with the series) where he sells his service as some combination of exterminator/exorcist, killing demons for any client who knows the password and starting pizzas that he will never be allowed to finish. A mysterious woman shows up at his store and attacks him, but when Dante shows his skill at surviving impalements, she changes her tone and tells him that Mundus has been reborn and Dante must go to Mallet Island to again defeat the demon king his father once banished. The woman, Trish, looks incredibly similar to Dante’s mother, and that’s all Dante needs to trust her, apparently. Dante sets off for Mallet Island.\n\nAs Dante fights his way through the island’s castle and other ancient structures he encounters an honorable, humanoid demon warrior named Nelo Angelo. As you will likely guess, this is Dante’s brother, Vergil. After killing hundreds of demons and realizing who Nelo Angelo is right after killing him (as required by dramatic law), Dante is betrayed by Trish. In another easy-to-guess plot twist, Trish is a creation of Mundus who was luring Dante to his presumed doom all along. After revealing her true intentions but failing to kill Dante, Dante saves Trish from a falling rock because, again, she looks like his mother. Mundus decides to take advantage of Dante’s possible Oedipus complex and uses a captured Trish as a distraction when Dante finally confronts him. Trish, however, has grown a conscience and instead sacrifices herself for Dante. Dante gets mad, seemingly kills Mundus, and utters the greatest line in gaming history (it involves filling a dark soul with light) when he sees Trish’s “dead” body. While escaping the collapsing island, Dante is confronted by an injured and angry Mundus but with the help of an inexplicably alive Trish defeats the demon king for another generation. Dante and Trish escape, and Dante tells her that her tears prove she’s human because “devils never cry.” Trish becomes Dante’s partner and they rename the store Devil Never Cry, although that name is never mentioned again in the series. And thus the first mission we saw Dante go on is concluded.\n\nThe Game\n\nDevil May Cry codified the character action game, so if you’ve played any games in it you have a good idea of how DMC plays. Dante can use a variety of guns, melee weapons, and maneuvers to shoot, slash, and dodge enemies coming at him from all angles. There’s a lot of enemy variety, ranging from knife-wielding puppets to intangible grim reapers carrying giant scissors to humanoids made of lasers who can multiply themselves and turn into bats. And that’s not getting into the bosses, such as a gigantic lava spider/scorpion and a mass of goo that must be made solid before you even get a chance to try to get past its protective shell. For a time when most third person games had enemies that repeated a single function and died in one or two hits, Devil May Cry was amazing in the depth and variety of its enemies.\n\nAnother genre staple that Devil May Cry introduced is Dante’s Devil Trigger mode. Dante is a half-demon, but early in the game you find a weapon that allows him to tap into his demon blood and become fully charged for a limited amount of time. The amount of time you have is determined by an expandable energy meter that fills quite quickly as you damage enemies in normal mode. While Devil Trigger is activated you are faster, do more damage, take less damage, slowly regenerate health, and have access to some absurdly broken moves. This meter-limited super mode would become a staple of the character action genre, but Dante’s Devil Trigger remains the most iconic and useful thanks to how quickly it recharges.\n\nI’ve often described the structure of Devil May Cry as an on-rails Metroidvania. If you were to watch someone play through the game with the end level messages removed, it would look like someone was exploring a semi-open world, but the game is actually quite linear. Each of the 23 short levels has a set path you must follow to reach a new area, get an item required to progress, or find a boss. Throughout the game you find items that open up new paths, but they’re really glorified keys. That doesn’t mean Dante is static throughout the game, though. While very rarely used to make your way forward, there are new melee weapons and guns that you find throughout your journey. You also get red orbs for killing enemies, exploring, getting good ranks at the end of levels, pretty much everything. These can be spent on new moves, more health/Devil Trigger meter, or consumable items. You can also expand your health by finding secret missions, which will reward you with one fourth of a life-expanding item if you’re successful. So despite the game’s mostly linear nature, there’s actually quite a bit of variety in how you can have Dante fight.\n\nDevil May Cry is not an easy game. Enemies are aggressive and do a lot of damage, while taking many hits (don’t count on your guns doing much) to defeat. In addition, remember the consumable items I mentioned earlier? One of those has to be used every time you die if you don’t want to be sent back to the very start of a mission. And every time you buy one, the price goes up, while draining red orbs that could have been used on new moves or permanent upgrades. Thankfully, the levels are short enough that restarting them usually isn’t too painful, but the checkpoint system is still annoying. Once you beat the game, you unlock a harder setting. Beat that, and you unlock an even harder one: the signature Dante Must Die mode. Mastering the game will be a long, grueling journey. And that’s not even getting into the ranking system, every game in the series ranks you according to how “stylish” your fighting is, meaning the variety and rapidness of the attacks you unleash on enemies. While taking points away for getting hit, taking too long, or using items. Devil May Cry solidified its genre as one you must “git gud” at to truly appreciate.\n\nReception and Impact\n\nDevil May Cry was extremely well-received by both reviewers and the gaming community, getting a Metacritic average in the 90s and a dedicated fanbase that exists to this day. The steep learning curve didn’t drive people away, the awe factor of something so legitimately “next-gen” and how cool you looked when playing it competently made gamers eager to learn the new style of game. Devil May Cry sold over two million copies (which was an even more impressive number at the time) and became one of the most iconic PlayStation 2 games.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate the impact of Devil May Cry. It spawned enough imitators to make an entire sub-genre: before we fought over the name of its genre, we simply called the games “DMC clones”. Devil May Cry instantly become a top-tier Capcom franchise, putting Dante up there with other Capcom icons like Mega Man, Ryu, and (insert favorite Resident Evil protagonist). A franchise had been born and a genre entered the public consciousness, all thanks to the original Devil May Cry.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nSo putting aside all of the legacy, perception, and facts, what do I think of the original Devil May Cry? There are definitely rough edges, as is inevitable with genre codifiers. The continue system can be maddening if you get stuck on a boss, and compared to later games the combat feels somewhat clunky. The button placement is also unchangeable and incredibly bizarre (why the hell is Triangle jump?). Despite this, DMC still holds up pretty well. The combat is still very enjoyable, the setting is iconic, and the dialogue is horrible in the best possible way. Is Devil May Cry as great today as it was when it was released almost 20 years ago? No, but it’s still good today, and worth playing for more than history’s sake.\n\n“In many respects, the original Devil May Cry is a lot like the first Super Mario Bros. Both games managed to inspire their respective genres for years to come, but in retrospect, they’re so janky, you’d be better off just skipping to the third game at this point.” — Icepick\n\n“This game’s ‘story’ if you can call it that is haphazard and all over the place but that’s not why I was glued to the game. Devil Trigger and homing lightning bolts were. DMC was a solid game, even if it took me a bit to beat. ” — Dariwan\n\nDevil May Cry 2\n\nOriginal Platform: Sony PlayStation 2\n\nRelease Dates: January 25th, 2003 (NA), January 30th, 2003 (JPN), March 28th, 2003 (EU)\n\nHistory\n\nSo Capcom had just released a genre-defining hit that could easily turn into a major IP. What was the next step? Remove everyone who worked on the original game and bring in a completely new team for the sequel, of course. This was apparently standard practice for Capcom at the time, the goal was to see if a different style made a series better. In this case, it did not. Little is known about the early development of Devil May Cry 2, the original head of the project is not even known to the public (it’s hard to blame them for not wanting to be identified). For easy to guess reasons, development of the game wasn’t going well and Hideaki Itsuno was put in charge of the game less than six months before it released. While Itsuno would later prove to be perfectly capable of handling the series, there clearly wasn’t enough time to truly fix Devil May Cry 2, and in early 2003 the infamous game was released unto the world.\n\nThe Story\n\nThe story of Devil May Cry 2 has little to do with the rest of the series, featuring no characters from the original game (at least in story mode) except for Dante, and even he acts completely differently. The story revolves around Dumary Island, which Sparda once helped save from a demonic invasion, fighting alongside the now-elderly Matier. A generic evil businessman named Arius is attempting to collect a set of items known as the Arcana in order to summon a demon called Argosax that is connected to Dumary Island. Matier and her daughter Lucia want to stop him, and ask Dante for help. Dante is now Two-Face apparently, and after flipping his coin he agrees. Lucia also fights Arius directly, and when she confronts him she finds out that he is actually her creator: Lucia was designed to be a servant of Arius and he has some degree of control over her. Lucia goes through some angst about the revelation that she’s a demon, but the fact that she can cry eventually proves to herself and Dante that she is a person. Dante and Lucia defeat Arius and the partially summoned Argosax, leaving Dante in the demon dimension that Argosax came from. Dante takes this well and rides off on his motorcycle to a destination we will likely never know. Lucia has made peace with herself, and will likely never be heard from again. The story makes little sense and has no impact on the rest of the series, which is for the best.\n\nThe Game\n\nIn the most general terms, Devil May Cry 2 is the same type of game as its predecessor. You still fight demons using melee weapons and guns, working your way through levels and fighting bosses. The levels were promoted as being nine times bigger than the ones in the original game, but this just means there is much more empty space. Dumary Island is a bland and lifeless place, the medieval-style town, modern city, ruins, factories, and office buildings you travel through are all presented in dull and faded colors. This wouldn’t matter if the enemies and combat were good, but… yeah, that’s not what happened.\n\nDevil May Cry 2 has a good variety of enemies and bosses, but they are boring and have no personality. Gone are the days of conversations with bosses, now they just appear, soak up more bullets than the normal enemies, and are gone. This mainly stems from just how easy the game is. Unlike the first game, where guns were clearly a side weapon that you would never rely on to defeat enemies, the guns (or throwing knives) in Devil May Cry 2 are absurdly overpowered. Most fights in the game can be won by simply mashing the fire button over and over while the auto-aim targets each enemy in turn, killing them before they reach you. Enemies blend together because they’ll probably never get a chance to actually attack you, the only difference is how long you have to mash the fire button before they die. There are some new gun moves you can pull off and equipable abilities for Devil Trigger mode, but these are of little consequence with how mindless the combat is. The game is boring, above all else: that’s what makes it the black sheep of the series.\n\nThat’s not to say the game didn’t make any attempt at positive innovations. The most obvious of these is the inclusion of a second fully-playable character. Lucia has her own campaign and levels (even if large chunks are shared between both characters), and even her own disc in the PlayStation 2 version, one of the only multi-DVD games on the system. Lucia uses throwing knives instead of guns and has a different melee fighting style than Dante, but sadly, this ends up meaning almost nothing. Enemies fall to knives as quickly as they fall to guns. Between Dante and Lucia, there are 31 levels, the most in any DMC game (so far) by a considerable margin, but the quality of DMC2 makes the length a weakness instead of an asset.\n\nThe only new feature from Devil May Cry 2 that became a series standard is the Bloody Palace mode. Bloody Palace is basically a challenge arena, you fight wave after wave of enemies over an astounding 9,999 floors (yes, there are ways to skip some). However, unlike later games, there’s no reward or even acknowledgment for clearing the Bloody Palace, making it feel pretty pointless. Trish makes her only appearance in the mode, and is even playable, so that’s at least an acknowledgment that the first game happened. Like with every other part of the game, the low quality of DMC2’s combat sabotages Bloody Palace.\n\nReception and Impact\n\nThe reaction to Devil May Cry 2 was not pretty. The issues with the combat and lack of personality made the game one of the biggest disappointments of the sixth generation, and fans of the original game were heartbroken and furious. It didn’t do well with critics either, with a Metacritic average more than 20 points below the original DMC. The game went on to sell over 1.5 million units, which wasn’t bad, but was still a drop from the first game. And many of those sales were from gamers who would greatly regret their purchase. After the series recovered with later games, the attitude towards Devil May Cry 2 turned even more negative. It is a meme in the fanbase to deny the existence of DMC2, and to be fair the story does make it pretty easy to do that. Devil May Cry 2 is universally acknowledged as a mistake and the worst game in the series, except by fans who take the “DMC2 doesn’t exist” joke to an exasperating extent.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nYeah, I have no intention of defending this game, as you can probably tell by now. Devil May Cry 2 is one of the most boring and tedious games I’ve ever played. It is mindlessly easy and so poorly balanced, that “Hard” mode is easier than the normal difficulty, due to it only being available in New Game + mode. I would love to see what this game was like before Itsuno did what he could to salvage it. I can only imagine it actively destroyed any PlayStation 2 that tried to run it. I had mostly forgotten this game before I replayed/watched replays of it for this retrospective, and I was better off that way. If you are getting into the series for the first time, do yourself a huge favor and skip Devil May Cry 2.\n\n“Back when it came out, the nicest thing I could’ve said about DMC2 is that it fixed the first game’s control scheme. Unfortunately, I played both of them in the PC release of the HD Collection. It simply exists as a curio now, though I am fascinated with the prospect of hearing about the game’s troubled development. I’ve even heard speculation that it wasn’t even a DMC game in the first place!” — Icepick\n\n“Wow…I wasn’t expecting this to be easy town. The story here was…even worse somehow than the first? Lucia was an interesting character. It’s sad she never will be used or fleshed out. Dante… wasn’t really needed at all in this game. All we needed were Ebony and Ivory as guest stars.” — Dari\n\nDevil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening\n\nOriginal Platform: Sony PlayStation 2\n\nRelease Dates: February 17th, 2005 (JPN), March 1st, 2005 (NA), March 24th, 2005 (EU)\n\nHistory\n\nThe extremely negative reaction to Devil May Cry 2 was not lost on Capcom. When Hideaki Itsuno was given control for the full development time of the next game in the series, his team set out to fix all of the flaws that had been introduced in DMC2 and recapture the spirit of the beloved original. Devil May Cry 3 was developed with a focus on varied, stylish combat and bringing back the attitude and memorable characters of the first game. Hideki Kamiya actually granted permission to retcon part of the first game’s story so that the fan favorite Vergil could be fully present. With the development team’s efforts and a strong marketing push, Capcom put their all into redeeming the series with DMC3, and as you probably know, it worked.\n\nThe Story\n\nAs indicated by its subtitle, Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening is actually a prequel, taking place before the first Devil May Cry game. A younger, cockier, initially shirtless Dante is getting ready to open his yet-to-be-named business when he is confronted by a mysterious man named Arkham, who delivers a cryptic invitation from Dante’s brother Vergil. Dante is preemptively attacked by a horde of demons, and after killing all of them and putting on his cloak (but no shirt), he heads outside where a massive tower called Temen-ni-gru erupts from the ground. Dante climbs the tower to confront his brother, where he meets a human teenager who refuses to give her name (Dante dubs her “Lady”). She is determined to stop Arkham and kill every demon she encounters, using an expansive arsenal of weapons to make up for her being merely human. After getting his ass kicked by Vergil in their first encounter, Dante awakens his signature Devil Trigger ability and continues exploring the tower.\n\nIt is revealed that Vergil and Arkham intend to use an amulet that was split between both twins (until Dante’s half was taken) in order to unseal the demon world and the power of Sparda. Arkham is also revealed to be Lady’s father, who killed her mother in a ritual to gain demonic power. Lady is determined to kill her father and avenge her mother, although she (but probably not the player) is briefly tricked into thinking her father was manipulated and killed by Vergil. This comes to a head when all four characters meet at the top of the tower, where Sparda’s power is sealed. Arkham manipulated everyone and uses the amulet, the blood of Sparda’s line, and the blood of a descendant of a sacrificed priestess (his own daughter) to undo the seal. With everyone else exhausted from fighting each other, Arkham knocks them all off the tower and claims Sparda’s power for himself.\n\nDante yet again climbs the tower (the game basically uses him getting knocked off it to signify act breaks), making peace with Lady along the way, and confronts Arkham. Arkham can’t control Sparda’s power and turns into a standard giant monster final boss. With the help of Vergil, who shows up halfway through the fight, Dante defeats Arkham and ends the threat of Temen-ni-gru. Well, almost. Vergil still wants Dante’s half of the amulet, and the brothers fight one more time. Dante defeats Vergil, who decides to stay in the demon world as the portal is closing. Dante mourns the loss of his brother, and Lady says that despite Dante’s claim otherwise that maybe even a “Devil May Cry” when he loses a loved one. Having found a name, Dante soon opens his business. Meanwhile, Vergil challenges Mundus in the demon world, which as we know from the first game does not go well for him.\n\nThe Game\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is everything from the first game supercharged to bring the genre to a new level. Dante is faster, has a more complex combo system, and an expanded arsenal of weapons that each play completely differently. The clunkiness from the original game is gone, you have all the speed necessary to reach SSS combos and dodge enemies from every angle, all you have to provide is the skill. There are more bosses than any other game in the series, and Dante actually talks to them again, with many of the bosses talking back and having distinct personalities. The story manages to make you invested in the characters despite how intentionally over the top many of the cutscenes are. DMC3 truly was a new awakening for the franchise.\n\nOf course, the game wasn’t just Devil May Cry 1 but better. The biggest addition to the gameplay is the Style System. Between missions or at shop statues, Dante can choose from four different styles (with two more opening up after beating specific bosses) that essentially decide what the circle button does. Swordmaster will expand your melee attacks, Gunslinger gives you new projectile-based moves, Royalguard will let you block and absorb attacks if you time it perfectly, and Trickster lets you quickly dash either towards enemies or out of harm’s way. The unlockables ones are Quicksilver, which will slow time for the cost of your Devil Trigger meter, and Doppleganger, which will create a computer controlled copy of Dante that will assist in battle, also at the expense of your DT meter. Using a style will eventually level it up twice, each time expanding the abilities the style gives you. The styles add a new dimension to the gameplay and let you choose what you want to focus on in gameplay. I go for Trickster every time, you can’t beat dodging.\n\nThe way equipping weapons works was also revamped. You have far more melee weapons and guns than the first game, but you are now limited to only having two of each equipped at a time. You can only change your equipped weapons between levels and at shop statues, just like the styles. The upside is that you can now instantly switch between your equipped weapons with a button press instead of having to go into a menu. This allows for more versatility in combat: you can change weapons mid-combo!\n\nOne last change… at least in some versions… must be addressed. As mentioned in the Devil May Cry 1 section, the game had a harsh continue system where you needed to use a consumable, increasingly expensive item to continue from anywhere besides the start of a mission. Devil May Cry 2 changed this to a standard continue from the last room you entered system, with the consumable item letting you respawn exactly where you died. Devil May Cry 3 used the DMC2 system… if you lived in Japan. Capcom decided to make the Western versions significantly harder than the Japanese original, due to Japan’s less hostile response to the lowered difficulty in DMC2. The western versions used the continue system from the first game, as well as bumping up every difficulty settings (western normal=Japanese easy, and so on). Devil May Cry 3 is even harder than the first game in its core gameplay, and the levels are longer, making the harsh continue system nightmarish. My praise for DMC3 applies to versions that use the new continue system, the frustration is overwhelming with the DMC1 style. So what do you do if you don’t live in Japan? Don’t worry, that will be addressed in…\n\nThe Special Edition\n\nDevil May Cry 3 was the first game in the series to get a special edition, which would become a series tradition after it. Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition launched in early 2006, and both fixed the balancing mistakes in the Western version and added new bonus features. Special Edition gives you a choice between the DMC1 and DMC2 continue systems, and uses the Japanese difficulty settings until you reach Very Hard, which was Dante Must Die in the Japanese original. The mode labeled Dante Must Die is the Western version, meaning that players wanting the biggest challenge can still have it.\n\nBut Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition didn’t stop at fixes. There were several new features added, the most prominent being the addition of Dante’s twin Vergil as a fully playable character. While he didn’t really have a story, you could play through the entire game as Vergil. Vergil had his own sword, projectiles, and Style, although sadly the levels were not altered in any way for him. Bloody Palace made its return, giving you 9,999 enemy waves in a game with worthwhile combat. A new boss with three encounters was added, and you had the option of turning on Turbo Mode to make the game faster. Released at a budget price, DMC3:SE was well worth it and is considered the definitive edition of the game, appearing in numerous compilations.\n\nReception and Impact\n\nDevil May Cry 3 was completely successful at restoring faith in the series. The game scored nearly as well as the original game and even managed to outsell DMC1 when considering both editions. More importantly, it became the gold standard against which all games in the series are judged to this day. The combat system is so deep, that the game has made appearances at fighting game-style tournaments, with contestants trying to achieve the longest SSS combo. The “character action game” genre was evolving throughout the sixth generation, and Devil May Cry 3 can be considered the fully-evolved form of it. It is to this day considered one of the best character action games of all time. Devil May Cry 3 both brought its series back better than ever and pushed its genre to new heights, it can’t be called anything other than a complete victory.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nMy views on the game fall pretty in line with the general reception, Devil May Cry 3 remains a contender for my favorite character action game nearly 15 years after its release. While my enthusiasm was initially muted thanks to the changes made to the North American version of the initial release, once I played the Special Edition everything came together. DMC3 remains my favorite game in the series (although Devil May Cry 5 hasn’t taken its shot yet) and a shining example of why hope for a series shouldn’t be lost after a bad game. I don’t quite give it the sacred status of genre perfection that some offer it, but it is a fantastic game and required playing for any fan of character action games.\n\n“It’s actually pretty impressive that Devil May Cry managed to last long enough to receive a third game, I guess the first game’s potential was enough to warrant two sequels. Capcom’s series tend to be refined by entry number two, which makes DMC an interesting outlier. A shame they originally tied the initial North American release to the first game’s annoying lives mechanic but the Special Edition put an end to that by adopting the improved continues mechanic from DMC2 and even managed to revise it for the better.” — Icepick\n\n“If I wanted more ham, I’d buy a honey baked ham store. Dante…was at his best here. Vergil… is unlikable. The story was better, but since this is the beginning… it makes less sense …but that’s Devil May Cry for you. I feel like this game should have been the first game. It would have sufficed for a sequel.” — Dari\n\nAnd with that, we’ve covered the first three Devil May Cry games: the PlayStation 2 trilogy. This seems like a good point to split things off, stay tuned for a look at Dante’s seventh-generation exploits and the long-awaited revival of the series. Until next time, I’m SNES Master KI, and I just threw your pizza out the window."
