        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nCrystar500\n\n80%PC\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is often lauded as one of the best Character-Action games of all time, so I went in with high expectations. While I enjoyed myself thoroughly, I couldn't help feeling a tad disappointed. It was definitely more polished than 1 and 2, don't get me wrong, but the Steam port does nothing to hide that ol' PS2 jank, and at times its frustrating not because of the difficulty, but because of that jank.\n\nHowever, DMC3 surpasses that by still being a blast of a time and the most entertaining entry out of the PS2 titles by far. Despite being a bit disappointed with it at first, the game's last act really sticks the landing and has some awesome sequences that more than make up for the annoying Metroivania-ish level design you have to go through at times. The level design also feels like it gets better the more you go on.\n\nCombat is fun, and Styles are interesting, but it really is missing that Style switcher the Switch version has. Which is why it frustrates me that the Steam port is somehow the inferior way to play this game. The Steam port is so disappointing and does nothing to touch-up the game at all, to the point where you may as well do the word that rhymes with stimulate and starts with \"e\". The experience might even be better!\n\nSorry, but that really frustrated. DMC 3's really good, and I'd recommend it if you're into Character-Action games, because it's one of the more notable ones in the genre, and for good reason. Although I think all of this datedness holds it back from being truly hitting the upper echelon and it could really do for the Kingdom Hearts \"Remix\" treatment.\n\nScore: 87\n\nShareCompleted\n\nShortchimp\n\n85%PC\n\n12h 1m Played\n\n8.5/10\n\nFINALLY, after the first 2 of the DMC we get to a dmc game that kinda just... ROCKS LIKE HOLY. Especially coming from DMC 2 (which is a pile of shit), I knew I was in for something on just the very first mission. There are some stumbles in this game, especially around the third quarter of this game, but it doesn't take away from how magical DMC 3 is.\n\nStory\n\nFINALLY we get a story that feels more consistent through and through without feeling like a \"Dante stumbles to another room for 6 hours\" story that 1 and especially 2 felt like. While the story is mainly an arc for Dante learning to not be a selfish prick and realize the importance of family, we also see the arc completion for Vergil and even Lady, who have really well done arc throughout the game. I especially love how Dante's character is handled, and surprisingly loved Lady's arc as well with her accepting that her black and white view of demon and human good is outright wrong at the end. This was the game that started to finally embrace the cheesy and more outright comedic tone of the DMC series, as DMC 1 kindaaa touched on it and DMC 2 tried to do a 180 and go emo. It is a blessing, but also a curse as I do feel like the dialogue at times was a bit iffy, and it was kinda hard to take some moments serious when just a bit ago we had a physics defying and hilarious moment happen. It does understand how to balance it at the end which I am glad. The main issue I have with the story is mainly the game as a whole which I had a big gripe with, 3/4 through the game the story just kinda pauses, and the gameplay also pauses as well to the point of filler, which I will talk about more in gameplay.\n\nCharacters\n\nI kinda already talked about the characters in the story, but this game's story is mainly character focused apart from the father of Lady wanting to combine the demon world with real life. Like I said, Dante's arc is pretty good, Vergil's arc is good and Lady's arc is surprisingly good. There are some side characters like the main villain, who has some glimpses of humanity but of course is just evil mainly, and uses the humanity to trick lady mainly. The jester does seem a bit forced in at times, but was an interesting character none the less. Lady's personality is actually a pretty interesting female character compared to how bland (and poorly voiced acted trish was). Talking about voice acting, this game just improved so much of the voice acting compared to DMC 1, which had poor voice acting that shined the worst when it tried to have a sad moment. Dante's voice actor finally being reintroduced with a new va was great as I love this dante's voice actor. Vergil's voice actor especially is so well known to the point of being iconic on how unique he sounds and he really excels in this game. He FINALLY shows up in the game with his iconic design and I just couldn't believe it took this long for this design to show up even though he shows up by name in dmc 1 (although controlled which hasn't been explained still).\n\nGameplay\n\nEasily the biggest upgrade from the previous 2. While I have played 5 already and know (and believe) that 5 has the best gameplay, 3's gameplay is still amazing and compared to 1 (and my god especially 2) is so fucking good. The way the game starts and moves from chapter 1 to chapter 13 was just peak gaming. I love the addition of FINALLY, weapon switching with melee and guns. While style switching is still not to its full potential this game without switching pre fights, the addition added so much to this game with planning, but would had been fantastic addition as alongside the 2 weapon limit, makes the potential a bit of a shame that while the switch version fixes, I played the PC version and didnt' have access to those features. I just love how fluid the combo system works with how good air combos are with swordmaster. The game's difficulty is also pretty damn hard for being on normal difficulty, which I loved. There were some bosses that has a difficulty that I didn't enjoy due to the gimmick, while others I found being so hard that I loved it (especially you vergil 1, 2, and my god especially 3). There is however something that holds this game back WAYYYY too much imo, and that is after chapter 13, alllll the way up to chapter 18 and even parts of chapter 19, the game's pacing just kinda halts to a crawl. Story pacing stops a shit ton and the gameplay, which had new weapon and boss introduction every corner turns into a backtracking maze with you fighting the same enemies, bosses, and at one point in chapter 18, the same bosses AGAIN IN A BOSS RUSH LIKE WTF? The pacing really hurt imo and by chapter 18 I got really annoyed with all the back tracking and lack of cool new ideas that the previous chapters hammered each and new chapter. I can't tell if it was either due to losing ideas or time, but it didn't get better till the very last chapter, as while arkham is cool in theory, fuck those dolphins. Vergil 3 is peak.\n\n8.5/10"
