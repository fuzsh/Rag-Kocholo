        "text": "▲\n\n1\n\n▼\n\nAccording to the game's writer, Bingo Morihashi, Lady was originally envisioned as an older seasoned demon hunter. However, Hideaki Itsuno rejected the idea in favor of an idea that would resonate with Japanese audiences.\n\n\"We originally planned to have her be older than Dante; that's how I would have liked it. (laughs) But Itsuno-san said, \"No way.\" (laughs) He wanted a character that would go over well with the Japanese audience. My original proposal was a cigarette-smoking demon hunter who could act like a mentor to Dante, but Itsuno-san's response was, \"No way. The only way she'll be popular with the Japanese audience is if she looks like a high-schooler.\" I had no choice, so I agreed to make the change. Trish already felt older than Dante, and the Dante in \"DMC 3\" is much younger, so it was decided that Lady should be slightly younger than Dante. Her appearance was up in the air for much of development, so I ended up writing her without a clear visual in mind. All we knew from the start was that she'd have black hair. Trish was blonde and Lucia was a redhead, so this almost Scandinavian-looking European should definitely have black hair; that's what the team decided on. Because what the Japanese audience definitely didn't want was more blondes or swarthy girls. The whole team agreed that \"DMC 3\" was a game made for the Japanese. We were happy to worry about the rest of the world later, because first and foremost, we - the creators - would have been in a bad place if the game wasn't a hit in Japan. Sure, we could have moved millions of units overseas and only tens of thousands in Japan, but focusing on the numbers like that and aiming for foreign sales would have been abandoning the Japanese fans who had supported us this whole time. That was the thought process, so we buckled down and concentrated on making a game that would do well in Japan. Vergil's katana and sword-draw techniques were also nods to the Japanese fans; we figured that most foreigners probably wouldn't understand that sleek, simple aesthetic. Lady's black hair, too. It wasn't easy. but we appealed to the audience we were aiming for.\"\n\n▲\n\n1\n\n▼\n\nAccording to character designer, Daigo Ikeno, Lady's school girl outfit was inspired by 'the black-haired Julia Volkova' of the duo t.A.T.u.\n\n\"The inspiration for Lady's image is the black-haired Julia Volkova of the Russian girl group t.A.T.u. (laughs) This is a woman who sets off to kill demons all by herself, so we equipped her with weaponry that can get the job done. She had to look like a capable fighter, but... Japanese players just love school uniforms. (laughs) All the time, the members of t.A.T.u were known for their uniform-style fashion, so we designed Lady's outfit to look like a uniform too. The thing around her waist looks like a skirt at first glance, but it's actually made up of customized weaponry pouches. The hard pouches are wrapped around her waist and filled with gun magazines, but then they're decorated with a plaid pattern reminiscent of school uniforms. It's hard to say whether she custom-ordered them or made them herself. (laughs) Then there's her white button-up shirt, which feels very fresh and clean. I came up with a number of other battle-oriented designs, but in the end, the uniform look was very important. Itsuno had a big say in it, too. I may have chosen a look more suitable to fighting if it had been up to me. (laughs)\""
