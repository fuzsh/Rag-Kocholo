        "text": "To do:\n\nCover the Trial editions.\n\nDevil May Cry is a 2001 action-adventure game, originally developed as Resident Evil 4, but spun off as its own game, and eventually starting its own series.\n\nUnused Graphics\n\nUnused Orb Colors\n\nBlack Orb White Orb\n\nThe game features orbs of various different colors. The game files contain a black orb and a white orb, showing they were planned and unused.\n\nGrenadegun Ammo\n\nIt appears that the grenadegun was supposed to have ammo.\n\nEarly Version of the Needlegun\n\nIt appears that the needlegun had an earlier design and was left in the game.\n\nCrystal Skull\n\nThere is a crystal skull unused in the game.\n\nSign of Chastity, Humbleness, and Perseverance\n\nThe game has an item called Sign of Chastity, which is a blue brain. A red brain and green brain were also found in the game files.\n\nRed Green Blue\n\nAdditionally, an image of the names Sign of Chastity, Sign of Humbleness, and Sign of Perseverance is included, with the latter two likely being the names of the other brains. Also included is text for an item called Knight's Portrait.\n\nRegional Differences\n\nTo do:\n\nAdd screenshots\n\nNorth American version changes\n\nConfirm is moved from Circle to X and Cancel is moved from X to Triangle. To do so, the game moved all functions of the respective buttons to their new button, resulting in the infamous Triangle Jump.\n\nAttacks Dante receive from enemies is modified to do 1.2x times their base damage from the Japanese version on Normal, Hard, and Dante Must Die! difficulties.\n\nOn Normal and Hard difficulties, damage Dante does to enemies is modified to do 0.8x their base damage from the Japanese version, effectively giving enemies 25% more health. Dante Must Die! is unchanged, so enemies have lower health on this difficulty on this version than Normal and Hard.\n\nThe damage from the attack Meteor when fully charged is modified to do 1.25x the base damage from the Japanese version on all difficulties. On Normal and Hard, this effectively makes the damage the same as the Japanese version, while on Dante Must Die! difficulty, it becomes stronger than the Japanese version.\n\nYou are now able to perform a critical hit on Shadows on Hard difficulty. Shadows on Dante Must Die! difficulty remain unchanged.\n\nThe following bug is fixed. In Mission 17, you need to obtain the quicksilver item in order to enter Nelo Angelo's room. In the Japanese version, only on Dante Must Die!, defeating the enemies in the room connecting to Nelo Angelo's room will allow you to enter the room just once without the Quicksilver item.\n\nPAL version changes\n\nAll North American changes.\n\nFive language options are available.\n\nThe font, even in English, is different from the North American version.\n\nTo display in 50hz in the PAL region, the game is slowed down to play at 50fps.\n\nPOWER UP on the top of the item purchase screen is removed."
