        "text": "Capcom have been slowly releasing the Devil May Cry series onto the Switch. The first game was ported to the Switch on the 24th of June, with Devil May Cry 2 releasing on the 19th of September. The 3rd game in the series has finally been announced for Nintendo’s hybrid console. Devil May Cry 3 will be releasing for the Switch on the 20th of February 2020.\n\nDevil May Cry 3 originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. Following its commercial and critical success, the game was re-released with a ‘Special Edition’ in 2006, featuring new content and gameplay changes. The game was seen as a return to form for the series, after Devil May Cry 2 was critically panned.\n\nThe series has seen 6 entries in total, with the first three games now either announced or released on the Switch. The remaining games yet to be announced for the console are: Devil May Cry 4, DMC: Devil May Cry, and Devil May Cry V. Both Devil May Cry 4 and DMC: Devil May Cry were released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and so are more than capable of running on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhile Devil May Cry 4 is likely to be announced for Switch, based on Capcom’s current trajectory with the console, DMC: Devil May Cry is perhaps more up in the air. The game was released in 2013, and was well received by critics. Fans of the series, however, disliked the game, due in part to its changing of the main character ‘Dante’. The game did see a remaster on the PS4 and Xbox One, so a release on the Switch isn’t out of the question.\n\nDevil May Cry V only released this year, for the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, so a Switch conversion is less likely to happen. Capcom has yet to release a major current gen title onto the Switch, so it’ll be interesting to see if that ever changes.\n\nDevil May Cry 3 Special Edition will be released on the 20th of February 2020 for $19.99 USD.\n\nKitGuru says: What do you think of Devil May Cry 3? Will you be picking it up for the Switch? Do you think Capcom will eventually release the entire series onto the system? Let us know down below."
