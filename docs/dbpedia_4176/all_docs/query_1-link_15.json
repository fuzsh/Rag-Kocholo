        "text": "The Good\n\nThe most important addition in the Special Edition of Devil May Cry 3 is the Gold Orb mode borrowed from DMC 2, complete with unlimited free continues. It's a huge difference from the Yellow Orb system, especially since DMC 3 is extremely stingy with items, as opposed to DMC 1 where the Yellow Orbs come from. Even if you're not actually using the Gold Orbs, being able to instantly repeat difficult areas and bosses will most likely help with mastering the game with a more reasonable learning curve and pace of progression.\n\nSE also introduces three fights against Jester, two of them optional, which is a cute little side dish, so to speak. The fights aren't among the best in the game, but they are a nice addition that adds some variety to 3 missions. Other new elements include a playable Vergil and Bloody Palace mode brought back from DMC 2.\n\nThe Bad\n\nUnfortunately, Vergil's campaign is rather underwhelming, as he has the exact same missions as Dante, but less interesting weapons and much less of a sense of progression.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nSpecial Edition has some interesting minor additions as well as a continue system that makes the game much more accessible, which makes it worthwhile.\n\n[based on the HD Collection]\n\nThe Good\n\nGreat Game, with Great playable characters... Follow the story of Dante, how he became the Hunter he was in the previous games, and meet (and play!)with his evil twin brother, Vergil\n\nFirstly, this is the first, and only DMC game, I played, so this was the first time I met with Dante. He is stylish, cocky, and really funny... he makes me feel good while playing (not to mention, he is hot). This game still makes me sit in front of the computer, because the different difficulty levels. I would like to play on as many difficulties, I can.\n\nAn other plus point is: Vergil. I loved him even as a boss, and when I got to play with him, I started to love him even more. He is harder to play than Dante, but this can be different for anyone.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect, I can listen to it all day. Recommended for everyone, who likes rock music (well, as Dante is a hardcore rocker too...)\n\nThe different styles for Dante allows you to focus on different things - melee weapons, fire arms, avoiding or defending attacks. I also loved the fact, that during the game, you earn new weapons.\n\nFinally, the story is awesome too. The cutscenes are hilarious.\n\nThe Bad\n\nIt was quite hard, but this wasn't a real problem for me. The things, that I don't like in this game, are connected with Vergil's gameplay.\n\nFirst, we don't have a real story with Vergil. We just follow Dante's storyline, we face with the same bosses. The other thing is, that with Vergil, we have only one style, but you can get used to is. (because Vergil has Yamato which is a GREAT weapon).\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLike I said in the beginning, great game, great characters.Not only Dante and Vergil, but Lady, Arkham, they are all interesting. The bosses are pretty hard though, but not everything is easy for Dante :) And my last word is...\n\nJACKPOT!"
