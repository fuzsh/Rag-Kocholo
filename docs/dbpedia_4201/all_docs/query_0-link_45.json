        "text": "Introduction\n\nAtmospheric refraction can substantially alter the propagation path and intensity of microwave transmission from radars and communications systems. It has long been recognized that sharp vertical gradients of temperature, and particularly moisture, of the type often found at the top of a well-mixed marine boundary layer (MBL) can result in anomalous propagation. Under standard atmospheric lapses of temperature and moisture, microwaves emitted at a low elevation angle to the horizon will be bent downward by the decrease in refractivity with height; however, the radius of curvature of the rays is significantly greater than the radius of curvature of the earth. Under some circumstances the refractivity gradient can produce trapping conditions in which rays bend back toward the surface. Thus, stratified layers in the atmosphere can create radar ducts in which energy is propagated with little attenuation. Another type of anomalous propagation occurs when the refractivity decreases substantially less rapidly with height than in standard conditions. This situation can cause degraded transmission between two surface points since the propagated energy tends to bend away from the surface, opposite that of standard propagation conditions. Babin (1995) discusses these categories of refractive effects in detail and gives the quantitative range of refractivity gradient spanned by each category.\n\nMicrowave refractivity N is given, to a good approximation, by (Battan 1973) where n is the index of refraction, P pressure in millibars, e vapor pressure in millibars, and T temperature in kelvins. A quantity related to N that has some additional attractive features is the modified refractivity M given by where z is height above sea level and Re is the mean radius of the earth. Atmospheric layers in which M decreases with height can act to trap microwave energy depending on the frequency and angle of incidence of the propagation into the layer. The ability to accurately assess and forecast mesoscale refractivity structure represents a difficult and important challenge, particularly in view of its impact on radars and communications systems. Given a three-dimensional mesoscale M field, a number of numerical codes have been developed that can compute the propagation pattern and loss of electromagnetic energy from a specified transmitter as a function of azimuth and range. However, often such three-dimensional M fields are unavailable and instead several radiosondes are used to define the refractivity along a given path.\n\nMicrowave trapping layers can readily be identified from vertical profiles of M. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a profile that is rather typical for a subsidence-inversion capped MBL. The layer in which the vertical M gradient dM/dz is negative is referred to as the trapping layer. The layer in which the energy tends to be ducted is thicker than the trapping layer. It is determined by the thickness of the layer beneath the refractivity minimum aloft, Mmin, for which M > Mmin. In the present study, we examine the ability of a mesoscale model to forecast the base of the trapping layer (which generally coincides with the depth of the MBL) and the base of the duct, a quite different quantity. If Mmin is located above the surface layer and is less than all M values below, then the base of the duct is at the surface and is called a surface-based duct. This form of duct is particularly important because of its impact on transmitters located near the surface such as ship radars. Often there is a minimum in M within the surface layer over the ocean that is associated with the strong moisture lapse that is generally present there. This creates a thin ducting layer, called the evaporative duct. This study, however, will be directed more to the stronger and deeper surface-based ducts because of their greater capacity for significantly ducting a broad range of transmitted frequencies.\n\nMesoscale data assimilation systems, generally used in the context of numerical weather prediction, offer the promise of resolving and defining the 4D refractivity field in sufficient detail to permit accurate diagnoses or forecasts of propagation conditions. To date, however, only very tentative steps have been taken in this direction. Burk and Thompson (1982) tested initializing and forcing a high-resolution 1D boundary layer model with output fields from a global model. The intent was to model detailed refractivity profiles in the boundary layer at select points without incurring the expense of doing this at every grid point of a large-scale model. However, this approach proved only moderately successful. It could not adequately account for advective impacts on the boundary layer and subsequent feedback to larger scales since the advection terms supplied to the 1D model had to be interpolated from the coarse-resolution global model. Computational power now makes feasible the use of a full, 4D mesoscale data assimilation system in coastal regions, where the need of high resolution is particularly great. Levy and Craig (1992) discuss the use of secondary surveillance radar returns to test propagation predictions based on output from the U.K. Meteorological Office mesoscale model. While their results are very preliminary and qualitative in nature, they provide some encouragement for this approach. The bulk of this paper, therefore, discusses the testing of a 4D data assimilation system in the context of mesoscale refractivity forecasting. Preliminary results from this study appear in Burk and Thompson (1995).\n\nMesoscale model description\n\nThe mesoscale model we use is a version of the Navy Operational Regional Atmospheric Prediction System (NORAPS), which is described by Hodur (1987). The version of NORAPS that we use contains the physics package described in Burk and Thompson (1989). The fields used to initialize the mesoscale model for its first forecast in a sequence of forecasts (i.e., a “cold start”) come from the navy’s global model (Hogan and Rosmond 1991). Subsequently, we use a data assimilation cycle in which a previous 12-h mesoscale forecast (the so-called first- guess field) is combined with observational data in an optimum interpolation (OI) analysis in order to prepare an initial state for the next forecast. The OI procedure generally tends to smooth model first guess fields because the error covariance matrices used typically have synoptic correlation length scales. This smoothing tendency is reduced here because incremental differences between the model’s first-guess field and the observations are formed, with the analysis being performed upon these increments rather than on the full fields. The analyzed increments are then added back to the first-guess fields, and in this manner much of the model’s mesoscale structure can be preserved. Of course, preservation of mesoscale structure is not, per se, the primary function of the OI analysis, for in point of fact the first-guess field is best preserved in data sparse regions, that is, where the OI does least. As a final step prior to initiating a forecast, a nonlinear vertical mode initialization is performed.\n\nThe model uses the hydrostatic primitive equations with time-dependent boundary conditions supplied by the global model’s forecast fields. The global model horizontal grid resolution at the time of this experiment was approximately 160 km. Lateral boundary conditions are supplied by the Davies (1976) relaxation method. The mesoscale model uses a split-explicit time integration scheme and a horizontal grid spacing of 20 km was used for these forecasts. A sigma (p/ps) coordinate is used in the vertical. The model domain covers a region 2160 km east–west by 1600 km north–south and has 30 vertical levels spaced so as to provide high resolution in the MBL. Turbulence mixing is treated using the level-3 closure described by Mellor and Yamada (1974). The computation of cloud liquid water takes into account the second moments from the turbulence closure scheme to estimate subgrid departures from mean saturation within a given grid volume (Sommeria and Deardorff 1977). A two-stream approach to solving the radiative transfer equation for short- and longwave radiation is used, with the clouds being fully interactive with the radiation scheme (Oliver et al. 1978). Ground temperature and wetness are predicted using the Deardorff (1978) force–restore technique. The similarity theory approach described by Louis (1979) is used to compute surface fluxes over land, while surface fluxes over the ocean are computed by the method described by Liu et al. (1979).\n\nThe field experiment\n\nDuring the period 24 August to 3 September 1993, the intensive observing period (IOP) of the Variability of Coastal Atmospheric Refractivity (VOCAR) experiment was conducted in the coastal region of Southern California. Propagation measurements of signal strengths along several paths (predominantly over water) were made using microwave transmitters. A large number of routine and special meteorological observations were also made during this period. Eight special radiosonde launch sites were established during the IOP. These sites were either coastal or on islands with the exception of a ship site (the research vessel Pt. Sur, operated by the Naval Postgraduate School). Aircraft and ground-based remote sensor data were also collected. Figure 2, from Paulus (1995), shows the Southern California bight where the VOCAR experiment was conducted. The standard and special radiosonde sites are indicated in the figure, as well as the primary propagation paths that were employed.\n\nTransmitters located on San Clemente Island transmitted signals to a receiver at Point Mugu (a distance of 132 km) and to another receiver at San Diego (127 km). As noted by Paulus (1995), these nearly equidistant paths, separated by about 120° of azimuth, provide information on the refractive inhomogeneity present in the bight during the IOP. Radiosondes were launched every 4 h at the special sites with the exception that there were no launches at 0800 UTC (midnight local time).\n\nDuring the IOP, twice daily 24-h forecasts were initiated at 0000 and 1200 UTC. The model was run in an operational configuration in which it used only the routinely available operational database. That is, we tested the expected operational model performance, while the special radiosonde data and other special observations were withheld for use as independent validation data. In the vicinity of the Southern California bight this meant that the only upper-air soundings used by the model were at San Diego and Vandenberg. The model coding was not altered during the IOP in spite of some deficiencies, which became evident during the course of the experiment. This permits a model evaluation without the added ambiguity of model changes during the study period. Model forecast fields were retained at 4-h intervals throughout the IOP for postanalysis of refractive events, using the routine and special observations for validation.\n\nThe VOCAR experiment was conducted in a region known for a prevalence of anomalous propagation conditions, particularly during the summer. During summertime, coastal California typically is situated on the eastern, subsiding branch of the North Pacific high, which generally is centered near 40°N and about 1000 km west of the coast. Strong temperature and moisture gradients typically exist between the cool, well-mixed MBL and the warm, dry, subsiding air aloft. Such sharp temperature inversions and steep moisture lapses can create layers at the MBL top in which the modified refractivity gradient is negative. The strength, depth, spatial, and temporal homogeneity of such trapping layers was of particular interest during the VOCAR experiment.\n\nThe overall synoptic pattern during the first few days of the VOCAR IOP beginning 23 August 1993 was rather typical, with an inverted thermal surface trough of low pressure along the Colorado River between Arizona and California, and the eastern Pacific high established well to the west off the coast. The resulting pressure gradient caused predominantly northerly flow along the coast; however, near 850 mb the flow near Point Conception was somewhat more northeasterly and a substantial eddy was evident in the model’s forecast wind field at this level during the first several days of the VOCAR IOP. The eddy was less evident at the surface, although many coastal stations in the bight observed southerly wind components, indicative of the presence of an eddy. Orographically forced eddies are relatively common in this region due to the predominantly east–west Santa Ynez and San Rafael Mountains, which act as barriers to northerly flow.\n\nDuring the middle period of the VOCAR IOP (27–31 August 1993) the 850-mb flow along the California–Oregon border turned from northerly to more northeasterly. At 1200 UTC 29 August the model shows the development of a mesoscale eddy on the northern California coast in the lee of the Siskiyou and Klamath mountain ranges. This eddy couples with an upper-level trough and amplifies into a mesoscale low that drifts southwestward and by 31 August it significantly impacts the flow pattern of the Southern California bight. Figure 3 shows the model’s 24-h forecast flow valid 1200 UTC 31 August at a height of 1 km, where the model’s output has been interpolated to a constant height surface. (Wind vectors do not appear in Fig. 3 where the model’s terrain exceeds 1 km.)\n\nThis low continues to drift westward and eventually leaves the western boundary of the mesoscale model domain. The existence of this low was confirmed by the signature of a circulation pattern on clouds in satellite imagery and by southerly wind observations at several northern California locations. Eventually, at the end of the VOCAR IOP, more typical northwesterly flow was reestablished along the California coast.\n\nMesoscale forecasts during the IOP\n\nConstruction of forecast field time sequences\n\nTwenty-four-hour mesoscale model forecasts were produced every 12 h (at 0000 and 1200 UTC), with model fields being saved at 4-h time intervals during each forecast. A time sequence throughout the period of the VOCAR IOP was subsequently created from these forecast fields. At 0000 and 1200 UTC these time sequences contain the 24-h forecast fields. Ideally, we would wish to have a continuous sequence of 24-h forecast fields spaced 4 h apart. This was not possible, however, since the mesoscale model was run only at 0000 and 1200 UTC. Thus, 4-h intervals between 0000 and 1200 UTC (and between 1200 and 0000 UTC) were filled in with 16- and 20-h forecast fields.\n\nSea–land breeze impacts\n\nAlthough the horizontal resolution (Δx = 20 km) of these model forecasts is coarser than desirable for the purpose, the model does resolve the sea–land breeze and is generally in agreement with coastal station observations. The sea–land breeze not only modifies the weather experienced by coastal land stations, but also alters the MBL structure adjacent to the coast. The low-level divergence associated, through mass continuity, with an accelerating sea breeze can cause subsidence and a lowering of the inversion-capped MBL. We hypothesize that this subsidence-lowering process, more than direct solar heating (“burnoff”), is primarily responsible for the usual daytime oceanic clearing of a stratus layer in a strip away from the coast. Certainly the modeling studies of Lu and Turco (1994), Holt (1996), and Burk and Thompson (1996) indicate that marine boundary layer depths along the coast can be suppressed by sea breeze forced subsidence. These studies further indicate that coastal orography can, in some instances, enhance this process when mountains, acting as elevated heat sources, cause additional acceleration and divergence above the MBL. These diurnal changes in the coastal MBL, in turn, alter the propagation conditions within the MBL by, for example, causing an elevated trapping layer to lower into a surface-based duct.\n\nDuring the first week of the VOCAR IOP the model forecast significant diurnal variations in the MBL along the central coastal portion of the Southern California bight. Figure 4 is a time–height plot showing the model’s trapping layer and contours of potential temperature at an over water location, one grid point from land, just south of Los Angeles (note only negative values of dM/dz are contoured so as to delineate the trapping layer). From 24 to 28 August the trapping layer is very low in the afternoon and elevates and weakens at night. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the model forecast base of the duct (heavy dots). There is a diurnal switching from surface-based to elevated ducting during this period. Vogel (1995) compiled trapping-layer statistics from all of the special radiosonde launches during the VOCAR IOP. He finds a clear diurnal trend in the depth of the trapping layer, with highest values near sunrise and lowest trapping layer heights in the late afternoon (near 0000 UTC).\n\nThis diurnal behavior of the model’s trapping layer diminishes rapidly as one moves west away from the coast. Figure 5a shows the time history of the wind at the same location as Fig. 4. The westerly, or southwesterly, sea breeze clearly picks up each afternoon in a layer several hundred meters deep. At a point 2° of longitude to the west (Fig. 5b) there are some diurnal variations evident, but they do not show the same sea-breeze phase or strength. Animation of the model boundary layer wind vectors shows that the onshore sea-breeze flow begins at the coast and spreads seaward. This can be illustrated (Fig. 6) by plotting the onshore (u) component of the wind at midboundary layer as a function of time and longitude away from the coast for the fixed latitude of 33.6°N. Figure 6 shows the diurnal variation in the onshore (sea breeze) component during the period of the VOCAR IOP when the sea breeze was least masked by other synoptic influences. The sea-breeze influence apparently extends more than 2° longitude (>200 km) out to sea on the 27 and 28 August. Previous studies have generally indicated offshore influences of not much greater than 100 km (Simpson 1994). The pronounced orography surrounding the Los Angeles basin may couple mountain-valley circulations with the sea breeze to produce an amplified effect under favorable conditions; however, this must be left for separate study. In any case, the early period of the VOCAR IOP (23–28 August) over the bight was characterized by strong, low trapping layers at the top of an MBL that was generally stratus capped and that exhibited substantial diurnal variation at coastal sites.\n\nDevelopment and impact of a synoptic low\n\nDuring the middle portion of the IOP (28–31 August), refractivity conditions in the bight began to change considerably as the low moved southwestward off the coast toward the position shown in Fig. 3. The model forecast the development of a deep stratus layer extending over the entire region of cyclonic flow. The model forecast MBL on 31 August reaches its greatest depth of just over 1 km in the southeast quadrant of the low, and its cloud layer is especially thick there. These model results are in good agreement with satellite cloud-top height estimates based on infrared temperatures (Helvey et al. 1995). At this time the satellite IR cloud-top height in the low is 1.2 km. The satellite imagery also reveals the presence of a cyclonic circulation associated with the low in good agreement with the position forecast by the model. Earlier in the IOP, the satellite generally indicated cloud tops in the bight at about 350 m, in good agreement with model forecasts.\n\nDuring the period 28–31 August the MBL deepens over most of the bight. The refractive structure changes from a rather strong, shallow trapping layer to a higher and weaker (or nonexistent) trapping layer. Figure 7a shows an east–west vertical cross section of relative humidity greater than 90% and contours outlining the microwave trapping layer at 1200 UTC 28 August. The cross section is taken through the center of the bight at 33.5°N. (For purposes of discussion, we consider regions with relative humidity greater than 95% to be cloudy.) The trapping layer has an east–west slope from about 300 m near the coast to 450 m at 125°W. Clouds are forecast well off the coast at this time, with the trapping being stronger above the stratus deck than at the top of the cloud-free MBL in the bight.\n\nFigure 7b shows the situation 3 days later (1200 UTC 31 August) when the low pressure system is affecting the bight as depicted in Fig. 3. The entire bight in this cross section is forecast to be stratus covered, with the MBL deepening to near 1 km in the west. Furthermore, the trapping layer is nearly gone (the contour interval for dM/dz is the same in Figs. 7a and 7b).\n\nThe weakening of the trapping layer in Fig. 7b may initially be something of a puzzle. Generally stratiform clouds promote the development of a trapping layer at their top. Cloud-top cooling, mixing within the cloud layer that abruptly ceases in the inversion immediately above, and subsidence all favor the development of the sharp vertical gradients required for trapping. When the synoptic low influences the bight, however, the subsidence is reduced or eliminated, permitting the MBL to grow. Furthermore, the southerly flow above the MBL advects moisture into the region. These processes reduce the gradient at the top of the boundary layer and weaken or eradicate the trapping layer.\n\nTrends in model forecast trapping layers versus verifying observations\n\nRoutine and special radiosondes taken along the coast, on islands, and from a ship confirm the general model trend for MBL deepening and weakening of the trapping layer during the middle portion of the VOCAR IOP. From the model forecast fields we computed the base of the trapping layer (where dM/dz first goes negative) at all of the sites where radiosondes were launched within the VOCAR domain (the nearest model grid point to a sonde site was selected). We also found the trapping-layer base from the verifying radiosondes. Figures 8a–f show the model forecast trapping-layer height along with the radiosonde-determined values for several stations in the Southern California bight region. Each heavy dot in these figures represents a value of trapping- layer base as determined from a radiosonde, while the solid line represents the model’s forecast of this quantity.\n\nFigures 8a–c are offshore locations—San Nicolas Island, San Clemente Island, and the location of the Naval Postgraduate School’s research ship (Pt. Sur). Each of these figures show a similar trend, with a minimum in trapping layer height on 27 or 28 August 1993 and then lifting to a maximum on about 31 August. This represents the effect of synoptic forcing over the entire bight. The substantial lifting begins first with the development of cyclonic flow over the region and then is substantially enhanced when the mesolow begins to directly impact the area.\n\nThe trend in the height of the trapping layer is similar at the coastal stations shown in Figs. 8d–f. At Camp Pendleton and Point Vicente (Figs. 8d,e) the model forecasts the trend in the trapping layer quite well during the middle portion of the IOP, but significantly underforecasts the depth early and late in the IOP. While this discrepancy was present in the offshore stations (Figs. 8a–c) at the end of the period, the model tended to do a better job at those stations early in the IOP.\n\nThe model forecasts were particularly poor at Point Mugu. This was puzzling because Point Mugu and Point Vicente are both coastal stations that are only about 100 km apart. At Point Mugu we noted a model tendency to develop a strong trapping layer at the surface nearly every afternoon, its character being that of a very strong and deep surface evaporation duct. While initially we suspected the cause to be somehow related to the mountainous terrain just inland from Point Mugu, eventually we discovered the true source of difficulty was something quite different and unexpected.\n\nTo the west-southwest of Point Mugu lie the islands of Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa—at their closest point being only about 35 km from Point Mugu. These islands undergo a substantial diurnal cycle. In the afternoon, when the islands are considerably warmer than the surrounding SST, the wind generally is onshore due to the sea breeze. This daytime advection of warm, dry air from the islands causes the development of a stable surface layer with a strong moisture gradient over the water, which gives rise to strong ducting in the surface layer. Because the model grid spacing is 20 km, it cannot accurately depict such a localized process and may tend to spread this process over too broad a region away from the islands.\n\nCorrelation of mesoscale forecasts with propagation measurements\n\nAs discussed by Paulus (1995) and Rogers (1995), propagation measurements were made during VOCAR on two approximately 130-km overwater paths. Microwave transmitters were placed on the northwest tip of San Clemente Island and receivers at Point Mugu and Point Loma (Fig. 2). The propagation loss along the path can be described with the so-called propagation factor F, which is defined by Hitney (1995) as where E is the field strength received and E0 is the field strength that would occur at that point under free space conditions assuming isotropic antennas for both the transmitter and receiver. In the presence of a strong surface-based duct, the received field strength (for ground-based antennas) may be considerably larger (and, hence, F greater) than under standard atmospheric conditions. In fact, with sufficiently strong trapping E can exceed E0, making F positive. For the 130-km paths mentioned above, Paulus (1995) notes that for a standard atmosphere the value of F should be approximately −49 dB.\n\nFigure 9 shows the measured propagation factor along the San Clemente Island to Point Loma path during the VOCAR IOP (Paulus 1995). The plot (not shown) for the path from San Clemente Island to Point Mugu is quite similar. Also shown in Fig. 9 is the height of the base of the trapping layer found from the special radiosondes launched at Camp Pendleton, which is selected because it is not far north of the center of the propagation path. Note that the propagation factor is greater than −49 dB throughout this period, and even exceeds the free space value during some of the particularly strong surface-based ducting periods early in the IOP. This figure also shows the strong correlation between the trapping-layer height and the propagation factor. Of course, there are numerous other factors besides trapping-layer height, such as strength of the duct, whether it is a surface-based duct, and the extent of horizontal homogeneity, that determine the propagation loss along a path. Thus, it is not surprising that the correlation in Fig. 9 is far from perfect. The correlation is particularly poor near 30 August. In this period it appears that a somewhat better correlation would be found by plotting the San Clemente Island trapping-layer height (Fig. 8b) rather than the Camp Pendleton values. Thus, horizontal inhomogeneity may be a significant factor during this time.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe degree of correlation shown in Fig. 9 between trapping base height and propagation factor is encouraging. When coupled with the skill evidenced by the mesoscale model in forecasting trends in trapping layer (Fig. 8), we are encouraged that it may be possible to routinely produce mesoscale forecasts of the trend in propagation loss for a given mesoscale domain (particularly given that only sparse, operational upper-air data was used in model initialization). Levy and Craig (1992) also found that, qualitatively, there seems to be rather good agreement between mesoscale forecasts of general refractive conditions (e.g., whether anomalous propagation is to be expected) and the conditions implied by radar returns from targets of opportunity.\n\nOf course, rather than simply forecasting expected trends in propagation or general refractive categories, a more direct, quantitative forecast of propagation loss would be desirable. This is possible by use of the model forecast refractivity (M) field as input to a microwave propagation code. A limited set of such calculations was performed (J. Cook, 1995, personal communication) using the range-dependent radio physical optics propagation model (Hitney 1992) and the mesoscale model forecast M fields from the VOCAR IOP. Forecast propagation factor F was compared with measured F along the two overwater paths. The initial results have met with only limited success. It appears that forecasting the detailed vertical and horizontal structure of the M field (including gradients at MBL top and the existence of surface-based versus elevated trapping, etc.) with sufficient fidelity to accurately describe point-to-point propagation loss along arbitrarily selected paths will require further advances in current mesoscale data assimilation systems and range-dependent propagation codes.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe support of our sponsor, the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., Program Element 0602453N, is gratefully acknowledged.
