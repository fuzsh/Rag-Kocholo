This state-of-the-art facility nearly doubled the size of the ED and is designed for providing the best possible experience for patients and families.\n\nEmergency Department Facts:\n\nYearly census of 45,000 patients\n\n24-hour emergency care for children ages 21 years and younger\n\nRapid access to the full facilities and staff, including experts in more than 20 pediatric specialties\n\nHospital services the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho region.\n\nView a video about Building Hope.\n\nEach fellow spends an average of 24 months learning pediatric emergency medicine in our department over 3 years.\n\nAs a first year fellow, the first couple months are spent learning primary patient care responsibilities, perfecting suturing and splinting techniques, and learning the essentials of sedation. In the latter part of the year, fellows transition to a preceptor role and begin to focus on flow in addition to clinical care.\n\nSubsequently, fellows combine primary patient responsibility and supervision of residents and medical students. Residents at Children’s include pediatric, family medicine, and emergency medicine.\n\nThe final year of fellowship emphasizes resident supervision, management of critically ill patients, management of ED patient flow, and direction of ED codes with the guidance of ED faculty. Educational opportunities include weekly fellow and faculty led education sessions, bedside learning, and mock codes with and without Simbaby simulation.\n\nHarborview Medical Center Emergency Department (HMC ED)\n\nPhoto\n\nHarborview Medical Center provides trauma care to adults and children, and serves as the Washington’s only Level I adult and pediatric trauma center. As the only such facility in a four-state region (Washington, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), Harborview's Emergency Department sees more than 80,000 patients each year, many of these patients suffering serious trauma.\n\nPEM fellows work exclusively in the emergency department as part of a coordinated trauma team composed of attending trauma surgeon, trauma fellow, and surgical residents in their first and second years. Fellows act in the role of a first year surgical resident and are responsible for evaluating and treating trauma patients, as well as patients with primary surgical complaints. In their third year they may transition to a supervisor role in trauma care.\n\nThe experience allows for the development of proficiency in assessment and stabilization based on Advanced Trauma Life Support algorithms, and performing common procedures such as peripheral and central access, complex laceration repair, and thoracotomy tube placement.\n\nUniversity of Washington Emergency Department (UWMC ED)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe University of Washington Department of Emergency Medicine serves as an outstanding site for learning key concepts of adult emergency medicine in a state-of-the-art medical center. Our fellows work alongside adult emergency medicine providers, residents of the UW emergency medicine residency program, and UW medical students.\n\nFellows experience the full range of adult emergency medicine complaints in both otherwise healthy and medically-complex adult patients. Due to the University’s many specialized diagnostic and treatment centers, the emphasis is on tertiary and quaternary care, and the care of the university community.\n\nVideos\n\nMessage from Dr. Walker-Harding\n\nResident Tour of Seattle Children’s Hospital\n\nFellowship Leadership\n\nProgram Director\n\nDerya Caglar, MD\n\nProfessor Fellowship Director, Pediatric Emergency Medicine\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nVeena Devarajan, MD\n\nClinical Assistant Profesor\n\nFaculty\n\nS.
