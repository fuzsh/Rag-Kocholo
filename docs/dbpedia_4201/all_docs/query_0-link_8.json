As this interest has grown, BHA has become global in reach, and has taken an increasingly expansive definition of its subject matter and its place within wider historical contexts. To this end, the journal publishes research not only on the histories of archaeology strictly defined, but also on the subject as it intersects with related histories like those of collecting, colonialism, exploration, fieldwork, heritage, and museums. At the same time, BHA is particularly focused on building interdisciplinary collaborations, and publishes work that takes its methodological cues from fields including anthropology and historical anthropology, archaeology, art history, colonial and postcolonial studies, gender studies, global history, and the history, philosophy, and sociology of science.",

        "text": "Theodore Macridy Bey\n\nTheodore Macridy was born in Fener, Istanbul in 1872 as the son of a Greek military physician, Konstantin Macridy Pasha. Biographical information on his life is fragmentary and mainly based on obituaries. He attended the Fener Greek High School and subsequently the Francophone Lycée Impérial Ottoman de Galata-Sérai (Mekteb-i Sultani). After graduating, he worked for the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (Düyûn-ı Umûmiye) until he was appointed secretary of French correspondence at the Ottoman Imperial Museum. Shortly thereafter, Macridy was appointed as commissar, tasked with the inspection of foreign excavations conducted under the authority of the Imperial Museum. Even though he officially remained a secretary, he spent most of the year on the field until 1907, when he was promoted to Conservator.\n\nA number of things made Theodore Macridy an ideal interlocutor for European expeditions. Like many dragomans hired by Western travellers, he was a Christian, and therefore represented a familiar point of reference in contrast to Muslim ‘Orientals’. He was bilingual in Greek and Turkish, and fluent in French, a language in which he also published. As an upper-class Greek gentleman from Istanbul, Macridy was in some respects too much like the Europeans, which made him an outsider in the remote places fieldwork took him to manage workforces of rural peasants. He would have been especially out of his element in Syria and Lebanon, as he did not speak Arabic fluently. State officials sent from Istanbul would not have been particularly welcome in Arab provinces to which the prestige of the Imperial Museum did not extend. He also found the climate difficult to bear.\n\nFor his first assignment in 1897, the Museum dispatched Macridy to Ephesus to monitor the joint excavations of the British Museum and the Austrian Archaeological Institute. During this time, he was also assigned to the German mission in the neighbouring site of Miletos. From 1897 to 1907, which is the period covered by his letters, Macridy accompanied European teams in Ephesos, Miletos, Cos, Baalbek, and Boğazköy-Hattusa. From 1900, Macridy also began to lead his own fieldwork projects at numerous sites, including Langaza (Thessaloniki), Notion, Sidon, Raqqa, Akalan (Samsun), Thasos, Alacahöyük, and Daskleion (Bandırma), as well as Ankara and Istanbul where he continued active fieldwork into the late 1920s, during the Republican era.\n\nWhen he embarked on his first journeys, Macridy had no prior field experience nor any formal training in archaeology. His job description involved the organisation of fieldwork logistics, providing security for the excavation teams and their finds, facilitating their communication with local communities and administrators, and dealing with workers. Above all, he had to ensure compliance with the 1884 legislation, which meant he was tasked with monitoring the teams and regularly reporting on the excavations and discoveries, to the museum in Istanbul. Soon, however, Macridy began to actively participate in the excavations, acquainting himself with excavation methods, mapping and documentation techniques, collection strategies, and the conservation of artefacts. Over the years, he trained himself in field archaeology, mainly through observing and assisting his Western colleagues. The shortage of qualified personnel at the Museum meant Macridy had to work on several expeditions simultaneously. Between 1897 and 1907, he frequently travelled long distances between Jerusalem, Damascus, Baalbek, Beirut, Sidon, central Anatolia, and around the Aegean coast of Asia Minor.\n\nAt the end of a tiring 6-day journey from Baalbek to Palmyra on horseback, the expedition eventually arrived at the Temple of Bel, which had been converted into a mosque. Quick to think on his feet, Macridy appointed the imam as field supervisor for the workers so that he himself could dedicate his attention to archaeological work. After spending four full months in Baalbek and its surroundings, however, Macridy was suffering from illness and exhaustion:\n\nI am very ill. I have told these gentlemen that it will be very painful for me this time to accompany them in my present state of health adding that I will ask permission to be excused. They believe that this is a way of causing them misery and having to pay road fees and allowances by keeping an unknown person with them on top of it.\n\nIn the end, the Germans accept Macridy’s ‘good services’ though Macridy himself does not seem to have felt his work and efforts were appreciated: ‘I have literally worked for the King of Prussia and treated … not marvellously.’\n\nComplaints about sour relations with German teams are not uncommon in Macridy’s letters, in which he recounts episodes of meeting resistance, scorn, and ridicule from his colleagues who are extremely demanding, whilst also dismissing or undermining his contributions. During his time in Baalbek, Macridy complains that he has no time to write letters on account of ‘work[ing] like a slave.’ In another letter, he also laments that he does his very best to please some of these gentlemen but that it is not always easy nor possible. He was clearly not on the dominant side of power relations.\n\nA perennial source of resentment tension were the regulations imposed by the 1884 legislation, regarded as ‘an inconvenience for foreign teams’. One such regulation stipulated that all expenses related to excavations, including the salary and travel expenses of the commissar and security detail, were to be covered by the excavators. Consequently, the organisation of finances became a major point of conflict between the Museum, local administrators, and foreign teams. Enforcing the rules and arranging the logistics, especially appears to have been a headache for Macridy. In one of his letters from Djerash, he reports that while the Germans wanted to make extensive travels in the desert to map out new territories and explore new sites, they were not so eager to cover the expenses of the Ottoman officials accompanying them:\n\nWe left Palmyra […] and after an 80-hour walk we arrived in Karyatein exhausted from fatigue and insomnia. […] The next day, a binbachi and 20 horsemen/gendermas came by the order of the vali to accompany us on our trip to the Djebel Druze. Professor [Otto] Puchstein […] got angry and refused to travel with the escort […] I explained to the professor (who believed that all these horsemen would be fed at his expense) that this was an indispensable/irrevocable measure of the government and that he had to take care of it. He told me to telegraph the vali [to ask] for the return of the escorts, which I did politely and he himself [sent] a hundred to his consul. […] [T]he professor got very rude and said unpleasant things to me and notified me that he would return to Damascus if the escorts continued to accompany us. […] [He] did not know what he was saying to hurt me so I had to remain very patient.\n\nAs the person officially in charge of enforcing the rules, Macridy is the inevitable target of Puchstein’s ire. He serves, in quite a literal sense, as a tête de Turc.\n\nThe difficult dynamics of being a commissar appointed to monitor and report on archaeological work must have had an impact on Macridy’s professional ambitions. On the one hand, as a bureaucratic agent of the state, he represented the very authority regarded with disdain by foreign archaeologists. On the other hand, Macridy too was a scholar in his own right and strove to be recognised by his peers on archaeological merit. He did not always find this easy.\n\nIn Palmyra, he uncovered a relief-decorated sarcophagus, which is the only occasion that his name is mentioned in the final publication of the German excavations. In his own report, Macridy writes about this ‘magnificent sarcophagus’ with pride. In Kiehla, he makes a surprise discovery of an altar, which he identifies as Nabataean from the inscriptions. He describes the altar in detail in his report, photographs it and prepares it to be transported to the Museum. His actions reflect the full range of the professional practices of an archaeologist, starting with discovery, leading to identification, recording, and the necessary preparation for preservation. The day after the discovery of the altar, Macridy is jokingly offered 1,000 Marks from Puchstein for the piece, which he considers a great insult, leading Puchstein to later send his assistant Bruno Schulz to apologise.\n\nThe joke would have been especially demeaning because of the way it alludes to the common practice of rewarding workmen with baksheesh for finding good pieces, thereby reducing Macridy, an educated Istanbulite and a field archaeologist, to the level of a rural peasant hired for physical labour and kept motivated by tips. Macridy’s intellectual labour in identifying and recording an archaeological find is ignored.\n\nAnother reference which suggests that Macridy was not always accepted into the fold comes from a letter written in 1907 to D.O.G. by Heinrich Kohl, architect on the Boğazköy team:\n\nIt was a blessing for Puchstein and for me that Makridi’s company was absent during the last weeks […] The Turk was blessed with luck as he ransacked the Hittite capital with nervous restlessness and abnormal ambition.\n\nNow, Macridy was Greek, so describing him as a ‘Turk’ has the subtle effect of othering him further from the Germans. Kohl also seems to imply that in a ‘Turk,’ ambition for excavating is somehow an ‘abnormal’ trait.\n\nLudwig Curtius, another member of the German team at Boğazköy, was similarly dismissive of Macridy as a scholar, and characterised him as volatile and untrustworthy:\n\nMakridy Bey was the strangest mixture of semi-scholarly dilettante and passionate enthusiast, of civil servant loyal to his superior Halil Bey and secret merchant, of restless explorer and sudden indifferent connoisseur, of nobility and kindness today, of cynical intrigue tomorrow. Sometimes he felt like Iago in Othello.\n\nThe unflattering comparison to the scheming, treacherous Iago is too close to trope of the ‘deceitful Oriental’ to have been unintentional.\n\nAs it happens, the dislike was very much mutual. Macridy, for his part, describes Curtius very scathingly as ‘a nuisance,’ ‘the parasite of the team’ and a ‘nasty sycophant’. Among Curtius’ ‘faults’ is ‘learning Turkish,’ suggesting that Macridy felt protective of his linguistic monopoly. A German archaeologist able to speak Turkish would have been less dependent on him and his services. Perhaps Macridy was especially anxious to hold on to this one clear superior advantage he had over the Germans, as he felt that their relationship was not one of genuine collaboration.\n\nIn the same letter Macridy expresses more bitterness, describing the expedition as an ‘invasion’ and comparing his place in it to one of servitude or captivity:\n\nEmancipated at last from the invasion (because collaboration would be a bad joke). We left with Winckler on 2/12 August after shipping all the antiques […] Finally it’s over and […] and I breathe the free air of Samsoun].\n\nHe clearly did not feel he was part of an equal partnership.\n\nIt would be thoroughly unfair, however, to portray Macridy entirely as a marginalised, long-suffering stooge to thankless and cruel colleagues. Hugo Winckler, for instance, praised him for his organisational talent and social skills in dealing with locals. During the surveys at Boğazköy-Hattusa, Winckler especially sought Macridy’s services as a professional colleague, as well as describing him as a ‘friend’: ‘At my request, the Ottoman Museum had provided me with my friend Th. Macridy Bey, who had already led the excavations in Saida [Sidon], because of his diligent and prudent intervention.’ Similarly, in an obituary written by Kurt Bittel Macridy is praised for his quick-wit and humour, tireless zeal and a distinctive flair for fieldwork and public relations. Bittel describes Macridy’s meticulous attention to every detail in the planning and organisation of the excavations, from the negotiations with the landowners and peasants to the supervision of the workers. More importantly, he also acknowledges the scientific contributions of his Ottoman colleague, crediting him not only for his managerial but also archaeological skills.\n\nSome of Macridy’s achievements certainly show that he deserved to be so praised. For instance, during a visit to Jerusalem to monitor the field activities and also to select antiquities to send to Istanbul, he prearranged the collections of the Palestine Exploration Fund housed in a high school building, converting the space into a small museum:\n\nAll the antiquities from Mr. Bliss’s excavations and some of those from Mr. Macalister’s were thrown into these display cases. It is impossible to explain the disorder and dirtiness […] The premises, far from having the pretension of a museum, were far inferior to an antique shop. It is understandable that in such a state public access was not possible. It was first necessary to go along with the internal arrangement, methodical classification of objects, and especially cleaning. I started by bringing in a carpenter who arranged the display cases and then I took care of the classification of the objects by materials and origins according to the system of our Museum. […] In short, after six days of hard work, I have turned this room into a charming little museum that can now be opened to the public […] I replaced the old labels with new ones in Turkish and French and indicated their provenance.\n\nOne of Macridy’s greatest ambitions was to contribute to knowledge production on an equal footing with his European colleagues and gain international recognition as a scholar. He published his first article on his explorations in Sidon in 1902 in Revue Biblique. He was also hoping to publish a group of steles he had excavated again at Sidon under very difficult working conditions where he narrowly escaped death after a collapse of stones and earth blocked his exit! Shortly afterwards he found out that the steles were published by Louis Jalabert (), representative of Jesuit missions to the French Foreign Office, who copied the inscriptions as they lay in the garden of the (excavation) house:\n\nThe steles that remained in the garden were copied by Fr. (Father) Jalabert who made a publication of them […] He ends up telling me that it is too late to go back and that he hopes that I would not be angry for that. I write to this filzlaus (sorry for the expression but it suits him perfectly) that in my article which will appear very soon I will add a few lines on the conduct without seeking to mitigate it. He knew that the right to publish belonged to me. He went in to see and copy the steles with baksheesh and they told him that Macridy Bey would be angry but he told them that I wouldn’t know anything about it etc.\n\nFurious at having his material for publication snatched, Macridy sought restitution, and was successful at least in having the affair acknowledged in print:\n\nThe July–August Revue Archéologique […] contains an article by R. P. Louis Jalabert S. J. on new painted stelae from Sidon […] The author claims that he did not know by whom these stelae were discovered which were not found on the surface of the ground, but were obtained by means of expensive excavations […] Macridy-Bey will provide all the necessary explanations on this point. We confine ourselves to noting the incorrect process of R. P. Jalabert."
