        "text": "What got you interested in the instrument you bought? / Which characteristics convinced you to choose the Elveflow machine?\n\n“I use the ElveflowAF1 dual pressure and vacuum generator. I use it to cyclically vary the air pressure under a membrane on which cells are cultured. Earlier I was using a syringe pump to do this. I am interested in the strains generated in the membrane, which are proportional to the pressure applied to it. With the syringe pump I could only approximate the pressures from the initial and final volumes, but not measure them. Also, the syringe pump was susceptible to pressure build up or leakage as it just kept pushing air in and out without worrying about the pressure. The AF1 unit allows me to apply a known pressure profile and directly controls the pressure, thus compensating for any air build up or leakage. The good fit for my need and the ease of use convinced me to get the Elveflow AF1 system.”\n\nFor what purpose did you use the instrument? / For which applications?\n\n“I am developing a device to study the effects on cells of combinations of surface strains and fluid flow shear stresses. For exposing cells to surface strains, I let the cells attach to a thin elastic membrane and then cyclically stretch the membrane using air pressure, for which I use the AF1 dual pressure and vacuum generator.”\n\nWhat kind of experiments have you conducted using our machine?\n\n“I have applied fixed pressures using the AF1 and calibrated the corresponding strains generated in the membrane in my setup. And I have applied cyclically varying pressures to generate cyclically varying strain profiles.”\n\nWhat are its advantages?\n\n“For my work, the ability to apply varying known pressures is very important. The AF1 does it very well and it is easy to use. The ability to apply pressure and vacuum from the same port is really useful and allows me to apply various pressure profiles.”\n\nOverall, how satisfied are you with our equipment?\n\n“The AF1 does very well what it claims to do and fits my need quite perfectly. So I am very satisfied with it.”\n\nWhat got you interested in the instrument you bought? / Whichcharacteristics convinced you to choose the Elveflow machine?\n\nSimplicity (no need of external pressure source) and price\n\nFor what purpose did you use the instrument? / For which applications?\n\nTo apply a pressure gradient in nanofluidics experiments\n\nWhat kind of experiments have you conducted using our machine?\n\nMeasurement of streaming current in solid-state nanopores, and to test the resistive pulse sensing of the pressure-induced transit of colloids in a nanopore\n\nIn your opinion, does the Elveflow instrument has some inconvenience?\n\nAcoustic noise (but I guess it’s unavoidable) , some small bugs in the PC interface, and a bit of output noise in the applied pressure which masks the declared resolution\n\nWhat are its advantages?\n\nMainly the small size and the included pressure source\n\nOverall, how satisfied are you with our equipment?\n\nQuite well!"
