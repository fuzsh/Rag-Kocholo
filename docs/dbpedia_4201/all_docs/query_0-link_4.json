        "text": "#INside Schaeffler Automotive Aftermarket Focus: Andy Walters Job title: Northern Sales & Key Account Manager for Schaeffler AAM UK Ltd Years in the industry: 25+ Area of specialism: Sales and technical. What you particularly enjoy about your role: Firstly, as Northern Sales Manager I enjoy supporting the Sales Team in achieving the best possible results. I enjoy taking on projects that I can share with the sales team. Getting out and meeting customers to gain information about the industry and what is going on in terms of products/technical matters most of all, whilst also maintaining an important customer relationship. Non-work interests: I am a very keen golfer playing a number of times per year which has allowed me to visit some of the most beautiful places in the world. South Africa has to be my favourite. I have taken a keen interest in cooking whilst also finding myself enjoying DIY. My all-time favourite interest outside of work though is family - time with the children, the dog and my partner, but not necessarily in that order. What you particularly enjoy about your role: Customer-facing contact and Salesforce #aftermarket #learninganddevelopment #automotiveaftermarket #INsideSchaeffler\n\nA few days ago, an interview with Tomáš Jiřička, Sales Director, who has been working at Amit for more than 3 years, was published. I am most interested in 2 questions that I would like to mention: ➡️Tell me, how did it happen that a company from a small country in Central Europe supplies 3 continents and 58 countries in the world with products and projects in the railway business? ,,Since I have not been in this company since the beginning, I have to say that it is also thanks to what my colleagues have reached in the previous years. It's a daily grind. They participated in various missions to different countries under the auspices of ACRI, of which we are a member, and presented the company to different customers. In this way, the company has gradually made a name for itself in markets such as India, South Korea and Japan. I have to say that compared to the automotive industry, the railway industry is very conservative and before you get a new customer you have to work long and hard, quite a long time to prove to a potential customer that you are the right partner to implement projects with. And, as Amit grew and acquired new customers over time, and thanks to positive references from existing customers, we were able to acquire new customers.\" ➡️What are or will be the trends in the rail industry? ,,We can observe that in Europe in general, but we also see it in India, for example, there is a great effort to move from road transport to rail transport. There is quite a lot of investment in this mode of transport. Currently, the trends are to ensure maximum safety, to ensure autonomous operation, and to shift the use of green energy for the railway industry and trains. I think these are the main trends.\"\n\nIt was a great experience to be a part of the first 3 Air Separation plant commissioning of Praxair India and working in Operations of these ASU’s (ACS technology with Model Predictive Control (MPC), far ahead of its time!) (Involved in JPOCL – 1 commissioning too). I had always had a flair for Sales (incidentally had an offer from a company for a sales role while in college but didn’t join) but working in Projects, Commissioning and Operations gave a different high altogether! Looking back, I feel that everything happens for a reason! Subsequently my career took a different trajectory when I worked in CO2 plants as a Plant Manager and was later groomed for a potential Business Manager role with a stint in a PFS (pump fill station). I still recollect the day I moved into a Business Manager role which would be a paradigm shift from a pure technical role to a role in sales. I developed cold feet and requested for a meeting with the Head of Sales. When I expressed my apprehensions to him, he said something that set me thinking. He replied in only one sentence as a matter of fact “We are all born salesmen including you! Haven’t you sold anything to your parents or spouse?” You would have to sell a product in this role ! This really resonated with me. He was right-we are all selling something or the other almost everyday…..we do this when we want to get something done. Sales is a way of life. We first create a sales pitch and then influence others to believe that’s the best option for them as well. I didn’t realize at that point that fate would take me to an unchartered territory – I would be getting into a sales role in future as well, albeit a different kind of selling. To cut a long story short, a few weeks later, I got a call from ABC Consultants stating that the Regional Head would like to meet up with me. What was seemingly a potential opportunity with a prospective client turned out to be an offer to join ABC. Today I sell with passion – I pitch jobs and careers to prospective talent and I just love what I do… Yes…Sales is a means to live and a way of life for me…..\n\nSaddle up! Sometimes you hurt people’s feelings- that’s the risk you run by looking out for yourself and your own best interests. But when change comes (and it will come) don’t you want to be in control or at least be prepared? Let’s talk about that change and what that looks like so we can position you for the most and greatest opportunities. There is something, probably several things, that are integral to your happiness and success and you should be prepared to share the right message to the right people at all times.
