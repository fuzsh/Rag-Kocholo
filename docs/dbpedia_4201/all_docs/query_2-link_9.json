        "text": "Overview of television serials in Turkey\n\nTurkish drama (Turkish: Türk dizileri) is a type of television series in the Turkish language made in Turkey. These dramas are believed to reflect Turkish culture and considered by some to be the country's most well-known economic and cultural exports.[1][2] It has seen significant growth since the 2000s, and had surpassed Mexico and Brazil as the second-largest exporter of television series after the United States by the mid-2010s.[1][2][3] The television industry has played a crucial role in increasing Turkey's popularity in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North Africa.[4][5]\n\nTurkish series are chiefly produced in Istanbul, following the liberalization of private television in Turkey in the 1990s.[6] Turkish television channels producing dramas include TRT, Kanal D, Show TV, Star TV, ATV, Now, TV8, and Kanal 7.[7] The Turkish television series market is characterized by intense local competition; out of the 60 series produced annually in the country, almost 50% do not run for longer than 13 episodes due to the strong competition among local channels, which results in the high quality and popularity of the longer-running productions.[8] Each episode of a Turkish drama is typically between 120 and 150 minutes in length, excluding advertisements. However, this does not apply to internet platform series.[9]\n\nÇalıkuşu was the first Turkish TV series to be exported internationally in 1986 to the Soviet Union.[10][11] Turkish television shows are almost always available in multiple languages, dubbed or subtitled to accommodate the target country's language. The success of Turkish television series has also boosted tourism, as visitors are eager to visit the locations used in their favorite shows.[12] The sudden and massive international popularity of Turkish TV dramas since the 2000s has been widely analyzed as a social phenomenon.[13]\n\nLeading actresses in 2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2000s, Turkish series are more popular than Turkish cinema. New actresses usually graduated theatre department and acting teacher. Their careers continued in Turkish series. Even though there wasn't social media in the 2000s, leading TV actresses are more popular than cinema actresses. They founded in Actors Syndicate.[14][15][16][17]\n\n1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 Melek Baykal Oya Başar Zuhal Olcay Demet Akbağ 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 Hatice Aslan Aydan Şener Vahide Perçin Meltem Cumbul 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 Berna Laçin Janset Paçal Gülben Ergen Şevval Sam Pınar Altuğ Sanem Çelik Nurgül Yeşilçay Ahu Türkpençe Özgü Namal Songül Öden Sibel Can Gülse Birsel Binnur Kaya Dolunay Soysert Ebru Cündübeyoğlu Fadik Sevin Atasoy Özge Özberk Canan Ergüder Selma Ergeç Çağla Şıkel İclal Aydın İnci Türkay Hande Ataizi Şebnem Dönmez Ayça Bingöl Zuhal Topal Ceyda Düvenci Doğa Rutkay Evrim Akın Arzum Onan Ece Uslu Hasibe Eren Yeşim Büber Aslı Tandoğan Özlem Conker Başak Köklükaya Şebnem Bozoklu Tülin Özen 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 Demet Evgar Vildan Atasever Gamze Özçelik Ezgi Mola Aslı Enver Melisa Sözen Pelin Akil Damla Sönmez Ezgi Eyüboğlu Burcu Biricik Burçin Terzioğlu Deniz Çakır Melis Birkan Yıldız Asyalı Pelin Karahan Elçin Sangu Zeynep Çamcı Sinem Kobal Ecem Özkaya Selin Şekerci Nehir Erdoğan Gökçe Bahadır Özge Borak Aslıhan Gürbüz Berrak Tüzünataç Seda Bakan İrem Sak Merve Boluğur Cansu Tosun Farah Zeynep Abdullah Rojda Demirer Filiz Ahmet Büşra Pekin Selin Demiratar İpek Yaylacıoğlu Gülçin Ergül Gonca Vuslateri Ezgi Asaroğlu Hazal Filiz Küçükköse Yasemin Allen Begüm Kütük Tuba Ünsal Begüm Birgören Naz Elmas Funda Eryiğit Yasemin Özilhan Özge Özpirinçci Merve Sevi Ayşecan Tatari Nur Fettahoğlu Sezin Akbaşoğulları Yasemin Hadivent Saadet Aksoy İpek Karapınar Hande Doğandemir Özlem Yılmaz Öykü Çelik Berna Koraltürk Nergis Öztürk Azra Akın Tuğçe Kazaz Bade İşçil Müge Boz Sinem Öztürk Yıldız Çağrı Atiksoy Hande Soral Burcu Özberk Cansu Dere İpek Özkök Meryem Uzerli Ekin Türkmen Ceren Moray Gülcan Arslan Aslıhan Güner Başak Parlak Burcu Kara Çiğdem Batur Hatice Şendil İpek Erdem Açelya Topaloğlu Özge Gürel Begüm Öner Tuba Büyüküstün Belçim Bilgin Birce Akalay Fahriye Evcen Fulya Zenginer Bergüzar Korel Beren Saat Selen Seyven Ceren Hindistan Nesrin Cavadzade Selen Soyder\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, a season of Turkish TV series was 30 to 35 episodes long. One 90-minute episode took 6 days to make. When TV series are broadcast, the next 3 to 4 episodes were shot concurrently. Actors and workers were on strike. So a Turkish TV series generally has 2 crew concurrently.[18] In 2016, a season of Turkish TV series was 35 to 40 episodes long. It is between 120 and 150 minutes in length. Actors and crew members complained.[18]\n\nEach series roughly consists of 40 episodes that last about 130 minutes, which translates into 5,200 hours of domestic TV content broadcast yearly. Meric Demiray commented that as a screenwriter, \"it was wonderful until about 10 years ago. Then I had to write a 60-minute episode per week, as opposed to today's 130-plus minutes. It has become a very mechanical and uninteresting process, just a question of keeping the melodrama going.\"[18]\n\nAfter TMSF took over many channels. Media focuses polarize, increase tension in society. Former leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said \"Freedom of press, thought and expression is one of the most important obstacles in the reactionary and totalitarian regime that is intended to be established. Because it is impossible for the enemies of the Republic and democracy to succeed without taking over the independent and opposition media. For this purpose, the government has tended to take over the media and create a partisan pool media from the first day. Everyone live in a semi-open prison.\"[19][20][21]\n\nJournalist Nevşin Mengü said \"Series consist desing society of government. It isn't criticism. They also try to design for dissident.\"[22]\n\nAccording Turkish University Women Association, 8 out of 11 TV series contain oppression and violence against women. Despite the Turkic warrior women culture of Central Asian. Series has by repeatedly portraying polygamy like normal, the learned helplessness of female characters, dirty competition and intrigues between men and women, gender inequality, cultural bigotry and neighborhood pressures, patriarchal mentality and male-dominated culture, the acceptance that violence is in men's nature, and the prevalence of social violence within the plots. It normalizes the episode by supporting it with tense, intriguing scenarios that will increase its impact, and by interrupting the endings with exciting events that will connect the audience to the series. Some even legitimize it and it has been noted that it acts as a role model by instilling a violent communication style on vulnerable audience groups who do not have the chance to interpret these contents correctly.[23][24]\n\nVeteran actor Şevket Altuğ said \"The contents of the jobs offered to the Turkish society have changed. So I can't be in any TV series with the current content. Let them accept it as criticism, and give it some credit to my old age. People kill each other with guns and rifles in all the work done. All men have beards. In our time, the beard was left off if necessary. I cannot be in this environment. We tried to teach society 'love, tolerance, tolerance, living together and solidarity' in our work. If I encounter such a scenario, I can still play despite my age. But I don't think I will encounter it.[25]\n\nWatching TV by people who do not have a rating device at home does not affect the rating data. The rating results announced in Turkey are affected by approximately 4,350 households in the Audience Measurement Panel and the guests coming to these households. Viewings made in households other than these households or in public spaces have no effect on the audience measurement results. Turkey has world's largest illagel refugee population.[26][27][28]\n\nActress and screenwriter Gülse Birsel talked about the changing rating system in the country after the phenomenon sitcom series Avrupa Yakası, Birsel emphasized that the viewers who were included in the Ab group, which measured the viewing rates of TV programs years ago, were selected very carefully with the following words: \"The television audience, the measured television audience anymore, is not the audience that watches Avrupa Yakası or even Yalan Dünya. That audience is no longer measured in ratings. There is such a dramatic difference that I can't even think about it right now and believe it. In the AB group measurement on the Avrupa Yakası, both mother and father had to be university graduates. You had to go to the theater a certain number of times per week or month. You were supposed to go to the movies. It was such a difficult thing to enter the AB group, I mean there were cultural criteria, sociocultural criteria and so on. Currently, I think you can enter the AB group if you have a dishwasher at home. Then the intelligence of television, the stories it tells, your development as a storyteller and your development as an actor come to a halt. Television is moving towards things that are a little easier to understand.\"[29]\n\nIn 1997, Iconic actor and director Kartal Tibet said \"I can't understand the rating system. I definitely don't believe in the rating system.\"[30][31]\n\nFırat Albayram actor and one of the most followed YouTube channels in Turkey. He said \"Years later, people ask about the series on the street. The series which no one watched according to the rating system, was actually watched a lot. This also reveals that the rating system is extremely corrupt.\"[32][33]\n\nActor Selim Bayraktar said \"I think the ratings have lost credibility. The most accurate measurement is on the street. When I walk outside, I see and experience what the rating is on the street. I probably met 10 people in 100 meters and they asked me about the series.\"[34]\n\nDemiray added: \"With the increase of the episodes' duration and consequently the amount of working hours, the industry has lost its most experienced professionals who refuse to work in such conditions. Wages have not grown much either\".[18] To get a sense of proportion, it suffices to think about the process of developing a cinema script, which takes about two years and at least seven weeks to shoot 120 minutes of edited footage.[18]\n\nCagri Vila Lostuvali, 10 years in the business and four as a director, adds: \"To deliver one episode per week our crews work up to 18 hours a day. This job eats up our entire lives.\"[18] According to Şükrü Avşar, one of the leading Turkish TV shows producers and director of Avşar Film, some episodes need between 15 and 20 days of work to get satisfying results.[35]\n\nApproximatively 36 episodes of different series are shot each week. According to actor Yılmaz Erdoğan the length of episodes is the first weakness of the market. Another weakness is that many series do not last long due to the lack of audience. Therefore, Turkish TV series market has not yet reached maturity.\n\nThe average season length of a Turkish drama is around 35-40 episodes.[36] New episodes are filmed 6 days a week to keep up with the demanding production schedule, and crews can work up to 18 hours a day.[18]\n\nEpisodes are generally much longer than those of Western series, with 60% of series running between 120 and 180 minutes per episode including advertisements.[36] When Turkish series are run in other markets such as the Balkans and southeastern Europe, episodes are usually split into shorter segments, usually not exceedingly more than 60 minutes.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkey's first TV series was Aşk-ı Memnu, which was produced in 1974. It was adapted from the eponymous 1899 novel by Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil. The series was released on TRT, the public broadcaster of Turkey. The period of TV dramas on just TRT continued until 1986, being referred to in Turkey as the \"single channel period\" (Turkish: tek kanal dönemi) and the shows themselves being called the \"old TRT series\" (Turkish: eski TRT dizileri). TRT was known for its adaptations of Turkish classic novels into historical TV mini-series.[37]\n\nTurkish Yeşilçam films (English: green pine), were more popular at the time. Yeşilçam stars didn't play in TV series. 1970s was the golden age of Yeşilçam. Yeşilçam was the world's 4th biggest cinema.[38] A support actor played in 3 films in a day. Yeşilçam movies are known for iconic unforgetten songs. Soundtrack songs are still widely successful. It being called Turkish: Yeşilçam şarkıları or Turkish: Yeşilçam müzikleri.[39][40] Due to Korea-Turkey common history culture, Yeşilçam films were exported internationally in to Korea.[41]\n\nOther Turkish TV channels appeared in the 1990s, and TV production increased as a result.[42]\n\nTurkish TV series produced between 2000 and 2005 were between 60 and 80 minutes in length.

Authors whose works were commonly adapted included Reşat Nuri Güntekin, Orhan Kemal, Halid Ziya Uşaklıgil, Peyami Safa, Ayşe Kulin, Ahmet Ümit, Nermin Bezmen, Hande Altaylı, and Elif Şafak. However, these adaptations usually transformed the stories from their late 18th- 20th-century settings to contemporary times. Book sales increased 10-fold, but these adaptations were not popular among authors and literary critics. One critic stated, \"You imagine that Madame Bovery or Anna Karenina is in a shopping mall. It's terrible. The adaptations aren't literary. There weren't historical places, political, sociological. Characters of Turkish classic change or don't die. Classic political novel changes only love story\".[43][citation needed]\n\nIn the 2010s, series ranged from 120 to 150 minutes in length on average, meaning an episode of Turkish TV series is like a feature-length movie. The series range from a period drama, modern-absurd comedy, crime, to romantic-comedy. The most watched comedy series were Avrupa Yakası (2004–2009), Leyla ile Mecnun (2011–2013), Kardeş Payı (2014–2015), İşler Güçler (2012–2013), 1 Erkek 1 Kadın (2008–2015), Yalan Dünya (2012–2014),[44][45] Tatlı Hayat (2001–2004) and Belalı Baldız (2005–2006).\n\nPioneers of on-screen couples\n\n[edit]\n\nPioneers couples from Golden Age 1970s, played together in many films.

If RTUK detects that any channel is broadcasting obscene, illegal, disruptive or divisive content, the channel may be fined, suspended, or even closed by canceling the license of the channel. Therefore, TV channels have to pay attention to their content. Punishments are often given because the scene is against the general moral code. Generally, things that are forbidden are either not shown on television or shown by censorship. Often the boundaries of what is immoral are unclear and very personal. Therefore, what deserves punishment and what does not cause controversy. And for this reason, screenwriters have internalized self-censorship. There are complaints as to why the sensitivity to alcohol or sexuality issues is not shown on issues of abuse and violence scenes.[89]\n\nCursing is censored in TV shows. Cursing is either suppressed by the beep or the sound is muted. If the curse is long, the scene may be cut completely.\n\nMaking love and kissing scenes are a sensitive subject. It is not forbidden to show, but the boundaries are not sharp either.\n\nTV series are also shown by censoring alcohol, drugs and cigarettes, and encouraging the use of these substances is prohibited.[90]\n\nHomosexual intercourse is a sensitive subject.\n\nBlood is also censored in TV series, scenes such as bloody and body dismemberment and extreme violence are prohibited.[91]\n\nInsulting and humiliating religion, nation, national values and state administrators is prohibited in TV series.[92]\n\nValues shown in Turkish series\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the Balkan region, the reason why Turkish shows became popular was showing lives lived in a healthy balance of Islam, democracy, modernity and traditionalism. They also lack violence and obscene language, as well as having easy-to-follow plots with realistic characters.[93] Tapping into nostalgia for a system of family values that people in the Balkan region have lost.[94]\n\nAccording to Izzet Pinto, the head of Istanbul-based powerhouse distributor Global Agency; it's the “combination of family-based stories with big talents and directors, and great music” that attract audiences so widely, and Turkish culture as a whole, which he calls both “modern, but at the same time, also very traditional”.[95]\n\nFor the Arab world, showing \"modern Muslim\" life was a remarkable factor. Contrary to showing elements that are not accepted in the region in Western shows, similar social problems are told within acceptable limits in Turkish TV series.[96]\n\nFor the Latin America, the reason was similarities in culture, emphasis on family values, family viewing, good-looking people and real picturesque locales.[97]\n\nBrave women who do not keep silent and seek their rights by keeping their dignity are another remarkable element in the series.[98] Fatmagül'ün Suçu Ne? was a brave story that fought to solve similar problems faced by women all over the world and has been successful in many countries.[99]\n\nCriticism\n\n[edit]\n\nWith taboo-breaking scenes that include premarital sex, love triangles and nudity, Turkish TV series have been dubbed as ‘immoral’ by some religious authorities in the Middle East and in some cases, they have even been banned.[100]\n\nBusiness and finance\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkish shows began expanding internationally in 1999, but only started to gain popularity in the early 21st century. In order to be able to produce high-quality content and to be competitive with the non-Turkish shows that were gaining traction in Turkey, more money was needed and the financial deficit was made up for through expansion to non-domestic markets.[101] The Turkish government also played a role in motivating international expansion, creating incentive by granting awards and support to the companies that are most effective in exporting worldwide.[101]\n\nIn 2017, Turkish TV exports earned 350 million U.S. dollars, officially marking the country as the second largest drama exporter in the world behind the United States.[101][102] According to the Secretary General of the TEA, Bader Arslan, Turkey's yearly income from TV exports will exceed 1 billion U.S. dollars by 2023.[102] Turkish series \"dizi\" are exported to approximatively 140 countries around the world.\n\nToday, there are about 45 production companies and 150 active film directors in Turkey. Production cost of a series may vary between 78,000 and 520,000 U.S. dollars (for the most famous ones).[103]\n\nStreaming\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkish streaming opened in the late-2010s.

Thus, in Azerbaijan, the shows are not subtitled as the content of the show is understandable by the general public. Turkish shows are also aired in the Turkish-speaking de facto independent state of Northern Cyprus.[141]\n\nTurkic languages more distant from Turkish, such as Turkmen, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Uzbek, require subtitles as they have lesser degree of mutual intelligibility. Turkish TV series are popular in the Turkic countries of Central Asia.[142] Uzbek remake of Turkish drama Kirgin Çiçekler aired as Бир ками тўлмаган дунё in 2015.[143]\n\nArab world\n\n[edit]\n\nTurkish TV series began to rise in popularity across the Arab world in 2008, when MBC Group began to acquire the rights for the series.[144] MBC is a popular Saudi Arabian broadcasting network.[144] Instead of dubbing the shows in classical Arabic, they were rendered in Syrian Arabic, a dialectal variant readily understood by ordinary viewers across the Middle East.[145][146]\n\nIn a survey carried out in 16 Middle Eastern countries by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, three out of four of those surveyed said they had seen a Turkish television series. Turkish series are in demand in the Arab world. They are prevalent on Egyptian television, and are popular among women in particular.\n\nLed by Gümüş (known as Noor in the Arab market), a wave of Turkish melodramas made their way onto Arab televisions, wielding a kind of soft power. The show violated the local conservative cultural norms, showing some Muslim characters drinking wine with dinner and engaging in premarital sex. The Arabic-dubbed finale of the Turkish TV series Gümüş (Silver), aired on August 30, 2008, was watched by 85 million viewers. In 2008, the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia Abdulaziz al-Sheikh issued a fatwa against channels that broadcast Gümüş, saying anyone who broadcast it was \"an enemy of God and his Prophet\".[145] First Turkish dramas aired in the Arab world were Cemberimde Gul Oya, Kaybolan Yıllar, Annem, Asi, Berivan, Bıçak Sırtı, Kurtlar Vadisi, Elveda Derken, Menekşe ile Halil, Yabanci Damat and Yılan Hikayesi.[147] Another Turkish hit drama in the first period was Ihlamurlar Altında which made Tuba Büyüküstün a star in the region.[148]\n\nIn 2013, the most popular Turkish shows were Fatmagül'ün Suçu Ne?, Aşk-ı Memnu and Muhteşem Yüzyıl.\n\nFatmagül'ün Suçu Ne? has increased the popularity in Istanbul as a tourist destination among Arabs.[145] Some Turkish series are more appealing to women, while some action series attract male audiences, which helps attract different types of advertisers for different viewerships. Some series have political overtones, including Ayrılık, which depicts the daily life of Palestinians under Israeli military occupation. Despite this, Islamic conservatives in many Middle Eastern countries have condemned certain Turkish series as \"vulgar\" and \"heretical\" to Islam.\n\nIn March 2018, MBC pulled all Turkish dramas off the air. Nick Vivarelli of Variety considers this a result of the political tensions between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. The head of the Turkish Sales Company Global Agency, Izzet Pinto, made a statement to say that he believed this was a political decision against the Turkish government.[107]\n\nIn 2019, Tunisian-Algerian TV series named Mashaer was the first Arabic TV series to be broadcast with Turkish team in script and directing in order to benefit from the success of Turkish TV series in attracting followers in Arab countries.[149]\n\nAn Arab adaptation of the Turkish drama Bride from Istanbul was remaked as 'Bride from Beirut' for MBC in 2019.

The loss of popularity in Turkish shows after the early 2010s happened because in recent years satellite channels that used to air these Turkish shows have been unstable and their dubs have gone down in quality. In addition to that the Iranian government has tried to stop the popularity of these shows by producing much more content itself and lifting restrictions on entertainment production to stimulate production by local companies.

(What is Fatmagül's Fault?), which ranked top of all programmes and Aşk ve Ceza (Love and Punishment), which came in third according to data by Index Kosova. In Serbia, research from January 2013 indicates that the top two Turkish shows in TV were Muhteşem Yüzyıl, which ranked fourth, and Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman Ki (As Time Goes By), which came in seventh. Serbian sociologist Ratko Božović explains this popularity by pointing at the traditional, patriarchal values of the Turkish shows, and the many cultural and linguistic similarities between Turkey and the Balkan countries: \"The mentality depicted in those shows has to do with a traditional understanding of morality that people in Balkans remember at some level\". According to him, all Balkan countries (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Albania, Croatia etc.) have seen dramatic changes in terms of family life, and the Turkish shows help them recall value systems that now seem lost.[242]\n\nIn North Macedonia, Öyle Bir Geçer Zaman Ki (As Time Goes By) ranked in January 2013 the top in terms of viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.[242] In fact, Turkish shows are so successful in North Macedonia that the government has passed a bill to restrict broadcasts of Turkish series during the day and at prime time in order to reduce the Turkish impact on North Macedonia's society.[243]\n\nThey are also widely watched by Bulgarian viewers.[244] Nova Televizia broke the record for viewer numbers when it started broadcasting the Turkish TV series Binbir Gece.
