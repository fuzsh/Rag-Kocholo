        "meta_description": "Abstract. We present a framework that links in situ observations from the Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) array to biogeochemical models. The framework minimizes the technical effort required to construct a Lagrangian-type 1D modelling experiment along BGC-Argo tracks. We utilize the Argo data in two ways: (1)Â to drive the model physics and (2)Â to evaluate the model biogeochemistry. BGC-Argo physics data are used to nudge the model physics closer to observations to reduce the errors in the biogeochemistry stemming from physics errors. This allows us to target the model biogeochemistry and, by using the Argo biogeochemical dataset, we identify potential sources of model errors, introduce changes to the model formulation, and validate model configurations. We present experiments for the Nordic seas and showcase how we identify potential BGC-Argo buoys to model, prepare forcing, design experiments, and approach model improvement and validation. We use the ECOSMO II(CHL) model as the biogeochemical component and focus on chlorophyllÂ a. The experiments reveal that ECOSMO II(CHL) requires improvements during low-light conditions, as the comparison to BGC-Argo reveals that ECOSMO II(CHL) simulates a late spring bloom and does not represent the deep chlorophyll maximum layer formation in summer periods. We modified the productivity and chlorophyllÂ a relationship and statistically documented decreased bias and error in the revised model when using BGC-Argo data. Our results reveal that nudging the model temperature and salinity closer to BGC-Argo data reduces errors in biogeochemistry, and we suggest a relaxation time period of 1â10âd. The BGC-Argo data coverage is ever-growing and the framework is a valuable asset, as it improves biogeochemical models by performing efficient 1D model configurations and evaluation and then transferring the configurations to a 3D model with a wide range of use cases at the operational, regional/global and climate scales.",

        "text": "Marine biogeochemical models are used to understand and quantify physical, chemical and biological interactions and how they respond or feed back to climate variability. Ocean biogeochemistry is complex, with many poorly known processes, and it is therefore necessary to simplify ecosystem functions when constructing modelling frameworks that represent the environment they are dedicated to in a cost-efficient way. In addition to observational datasets, we require efficient tools that can maximize the benefits of these datasets for model construction, tuning and evaluation. In this study, we showcase how Biogeochemical Argo buoys can be used for improving the formulation, parameterization and performance of a biogeochemical model.\n\nBiogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) is a network of free-drifting, battery-powered profiling floats measuring temperature and salinity as well as six core variables (oxygen, nitrate, pH, chlorophyllÂ a, suspended particles and downwelling irradiance) down to a depth of 2000âm. In the context of the Global Ocean Observing System, the BGC-Argo network supports three main themes: climate, marine ecosystem health and operational services. It has been used to estimate and assess the net community and export production, the airâsea gas exchange, the oxygen minimum zone variability, and biophysical interactions (Claustre etÂ al.,Â 2020,Â and references therein). In the modelling community, BGC-Argo datasets have been used with data assimilation for state correction (Cossarini etÂ al.,Â 2019), model optimization and evaluation (Verdy and Mazloff,Â 2017; Damien etÂ al.,Â 2018; Salon etÂ al.,Â 2019; Wang etÂ al.,Â 2020), and model formulation improvement (TerziÄ etÂ al.,Â 2019). These recent examples demonstrate the synergy of BGC-Argo with biogeochemical models and that the use of BGC-Argo in the modelling community is gaining momentum. Furthermore, the added value of these profiling floats to modelling frameworks will likely increase with increasing BGC-Argo coverage (Voosen,Â 2020). Therefore, introducing frameworks (including the one presented in this study) that utilize these datasets will benefit the modelling community as both the regional and temporal BGC-Argo coverage increases.\n\nDuring its two decades of operation, the BGC-Argo array has challenged the historical capacity for in situ sampling, which is biased towards coastal areas, the Northern Hemisphere and seasons with easier sampling conditions, especially in the polar regions (Riser etÂ al.,Â 2016). BGC-Argo covers open-ocean regions extensively and samples equally throughout the seasons (see Sect.Â 2.1.1 for a sampling comparison for the high-latitude North Atlantic). For 1D models, which are preferably configured at the time-series sites, the overhead for in situ sampling greatly limits the temporal resolution, leading to undersampling, which limits our understanding of the ocean dynamics and model development and assessment. While satellite images provide extensive regional coverage (hindered by cloud coverage, especially at high latitudes), they are limited to surface measurements and can not constrain some of the parameters vital to model optimization and validation alone (Tjiputra etÂ al.,Â 2007; Gharamti etÂ al.,Â 2017; Wang etÂ al.,Â 2020).\n\nIn this study, we focus on using BGC-Argo as an additional observational data source to in situ sampling and remote sensing as well as on how to take advantage of two important aspects of the BGC-Argo dataset: (1)Â its regional and temporal coverage and (2)Â the availability of both physical and biogeochemical high-resolution data. Our main objective is to establish the framework and showcase its capacity as a tool for model development and assessment. The framework will allow the modeller to construct a Lagrangian-type experiment along a BGC-Argo track in order to visually and objectively assess the model performance and subsequently advance its dynamics and optimize its parameters. Even though one of the ultimate aims of using this framework for a modelling study is the assessment of the observed biogeochemistry, our primary aim is to present the details of the framework. Therefore, a full assessment of the observed biogeochemical variables is outside the scope of this study. Here, we present how BGC-Argo physical data can enhance the realism of model physics, thereby allowing the evaluation and improvement of the modelled biogeochemistry. Specifically, we show how its high-resolution vertical and temporal chlorophyllÂ a sampling can be used to advance model formulation, and we objectively assess the model parameters. The ultimate goal is to establish a 1D modelling framework for improving regional and global models.\n\n3.1âBiogeochemical Argo data evaluation in the Nordic seas\n\nBGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a data have been undergoing quality checks and adjustments (e.g.Â Xing etÂ al.,Â 2012; Roesler etÂ al.,Â 2017) and have improved significantly in recent years. A key adjustment is the division by 2 suggested by Roesler etÂ al. (2017). They suggested that this division improves the overestimation of the factory-calibrated chlorophyllÂ a seen in estimates from the WET Labs Environmental Characterization Optics (ECO) series of chlorophyll fluorometer sensors. However, this adjustment is a global average correction, whereas regional values may differ, and therefore, before progressing further with the model experiments, it is important to evaluate the BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a data for the Atlantic north of 50ââN and to evaluate whether the division by 2 is also valid for that region.\n\nEvaluating the BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a against in situ data would have been the preferred choice, as these samples cover deeper layers in the water column. However, there were too few co-locations between BGC-Argo and in situ samples (Fig.Â 1), leading to an unreliable statistical analysis. Therefore, satellite chlorophyllÂ a data were used as an independent cross-validation dataset, and the BGC-Argo and in situ sample chlorophyllÂ a were separately analysed statistically against satellite data. We note that van Oostende etÂ al. (2022) showed that there are inconsistencies in the continuity of the OC CCI v5.0 chlorophyllÂ a product that appear as sudden steps in the time series. These steps appear when a satellite is launched or removed. For this reason, we limited our statistical analysis to the period from MayÂ 2012 to MayÂ 2016, when only MODIS and VIIRS were continuously active, as this time frame fitted our study period. FigureÂ 1 in van Oostende etÂ al. (2022) depicts no sudden steps in the OC CCI V5.0 data for this period.\n\nBoth visually and statistically (Fig.Â 4), the BGC-Argo and in situ sample chlorophyllÂ a are generally similar to the satellite chlorophyllÂ a. This analysis indicates that the default quality corrections applied to BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a ensure a good representation of the in situ sample chlorophyllÂ a while noting that the satellite data are limited to the optical depth at the surface. Unfortunately, we do not have the required data at depth to compare the BGC-Argo data to, and we rely on the quality information document for the reprocessed in situ observations (Jaccard etÂ al.,Â 2018). Following this evaluation, we conclude that the BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a dataset is of sufficient quality to be used as a validation tool for biogeochemical models for the Nordic seas without any further post-processing. This evaluation ensures that we can proceed with the modelling experiments.\n\n3.2âAlong-track model physics evaluation\n\nThe model physics and variations of it stemming from different relaxation scales play a crucial role in the biogeochemistry, and we therefore evaluated the effectivenesses of the different relaxation scales at reproducing the observed temperature and salinity profiles along the tracks. By simulating temperatures and salinities as similar as possible to the observed values (within a margin that allows the model dynamics the freedom to perform properly), we establish the foundation for biogeochemical model experiments that minimize the impact of errors stemming from model physics. As a result, we can target the biogeochemistry for improvements.\n\nIn our approach, we considered a simulation where the model T and S were relaxed to WOA18 with a 1-year relaxation timescale (i.e.Â REF-WOA-1year) as the typical setup for a 1D simulation, so this can be considered a reference experiment. This is the case for both the model physics and the biology. The remaining experiments (i.e.Â REF-Argo-ârelaxation_scaleâ) are iterations that allow us to evaluate the optimal relaxation timescale for progressing with the biogeochemical experiments. The simulations REF and EXP can be used interchangeably as they both use the same physics.\n\nWe use BGC-Argo 6902547 (Fig.Â 5) to showcase the capabilities of the framework we designed; the figures from the other experiments are included in the Supplement. We use the BGC-Argo and satellite sea surface temperatures to evaluate the simulated temperature, salinity and mixed layer depth (MLD) from the experiments with different relaxation scales (Figs.Â 6, 7 and 8). For visual clarity, Fig.Â 8 focuses on a portion of the BGC-Argo track with a limited number of simulations. The full time period and set of simulations are depicted in Fig.Â A1.\n\nBoth the simulated temperature and simulated salinity (Fig.Â 6) become progressively more similar to the observed values as the relaxation timescale is shortened (i.e.Â there was a stronger influence of the BGC-Argo T and S profiles), with the simulation using WOA18 relaxation having the least short-term variability. Even in the case of 30âd of relaxation (REF-Argo-30days), temporal variability is less pronounced compared to that of 1âd of relaxation (REF-Argo-1day). An argument can be made that evaluating the model results with the dataset that it was relaxed to could raise concern, but when the simulations were compared to an independent dataset (i.e. the satellite sea surface temperature (SST; Fig.Â 7)), the differences between the experiments are evident, especially for the months of OctoberâMay, when vertical mixing is high. REF-WOA-1year presented the lowest performance for those months, and it required relaxation timescales of 30âd or less to achieve a better fit with the observed SST, while the short-term relaxations (1â5âd) performed better.\n\nWe focus in particular on the MLD, as it is important for controlling phytoplankton phenology (e.g.Â the timing, depth and duration of bloom events). All the simulations use the same atmospheric forcing, so the choices of relaxation dataset and timescales are the dominant drivers of differences in MLD. Notably, the MLDs (Figs.Â 8 and A1) for both cases with 1-year relaxation scales, REF-WOA-1year and REF-Argo-1year, are similar, and MLDs deeper than the observed ones are consistently calculated for these cases, especially for 2014 and the early spring of 2016. This is also evident in Fig.Â 7, where the SSTs for the mixing period in these two simulations are cooler compared to the SSTs in the other experiments and the observed values. Due to a better fit with the observed MLD estimate, the short-term relaxation scale experiments (30âd or less) achieve a more pronounced inter-annual variability in MLDs (e.g.Â shallower winter MLDs for 2014 and deeper ones for 2016). These results demonstrate that the use of Argo-driven model physics produces more optimal physics in the biogeochemical simulations. For this purpose, as we progress through the model results in the following sections, we will be focusing on those of the 1âd relaxation-scale experiments when showcasing the relaxation to the BGC-Argo experiments.\n\n3.3âModelled chlorophyllÂ a evaluation\n\n3.3.1âEvaluation of the reference ECOSMO II(CHL) formulation\n\nWe first evaluate the reference ECOSMO II(CHL) simulations in order to detect shortcomings, and later focus on these to improve the model results by objectively analysing them against the BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a. Investigating this approach and its outcome is the primary objective of our study.\n\nWe present the observed (Fig.Â 9a) and simulated (REF-WOA-1year and REF-Argo-1day; Figs.Â 9b and c respectively) chlorophyllÂ a along the same BGC-Argo trajectory described in Sect.Â 3.2. We used REF-Argo-1day for this comparison since the MLD, T and S were better represented with a short-term relaxation timescale (Figs.Â 6, 7 and 8). Investigating the optimal timescale for relaxation (see Sect.Â 3.4) reveals that 1âd relaxation provides the best results statistically, although differences between the short-term (1â10âd) relaxation timescales are minor and are subject to the requirements of the modelling study.\n\nThe observed chlorophyllÂ a shows relatively minor increases in concentration (<0.5âmgâChlâmâ3) in early March for the 3Â years, with the first peak bloom of the year occurring during early May. The first peak in 2014 was followed by a decrease in concentration and then a second (albeit weaker) peak in late JuneÂ 2014. Following the second peak, the data show the formation of a deep chlorophyllÂ a maximum (DCM) at around 20â50âm depth. A comparable second peak in JuneÂ 2015 was not observed, but a DCM layer formed at similar depths to the layer that formed in 2014. The formation of the DCM started earlier in 2015. For both 2014 and 2015, a late-summer (SeptemberâOctober) increase in chlorophyllÂ a concentration from the surface to deeper than 75âm was observed. During the spring bloom events, the observed chlorophyllÂ a concentrations exceeded 5âmgâChlâmâ3, and, in the case of 2015, DCM concentrations exceeded 4âmgâChlâmâ3. Such continuous and high-resolution vertical, seasonal and inter-annual variability in the observed data showcases the unique value of BGC-Argo observations for model evaluation. Especially for the vertical case, BGC-Argo buoys are often the only available source of observations made in the open ocean.\n\nIn general, the two sets of simulated chlorophyllÂ a, REF-WOA-1year (Fig.Â 9b) and REF-Argo-1day (Fig.Â 9c), have similar vertical and temporal patterns and concentrations. Their first peaks occur in MayâJune in 2014 and 2015, and those peaks are followed by lower concentrations in summer. However, there are notable differences between the two experiments (see Fig.Â 9d, which shows REF-WOA-1year subtracted from REF-Argo-1day). In addition, the differences are not consistent between the simulated years. The timing and depth of the differences vary between 2014 and 2015. For 2014, the REF-Argo-1day chlorophyllÂ a concentration is higher at the surface during the spring bloom (May), while, in response, REF-WOA-1year chlorophyllÂ a is higher below 40âm. This pattern for MayâJune is reversed for 2015. REF-WOA-1year chlorophyllÂ a is higher in the 0â25âm range and REF-Argo-1day is higher below. During July in both years, REF-Argo-1day chlorophyllÂ a is higher for the surface to 25âm depth range. After July, REF-WOA-1year simulates higher peaks in chlorophyllÂ a concentration for this depth interval during AugustâSeptemberÂ 2015. Although minor (â¼0.5âmgâChlâmâ3), REF-Argo-1day simulates higher chlorophyllÂ a concentrations below the MLD. The difference is prominent during October and is located as low as â¼100âm depth. Although the difference is not as prominent as during October, the REF-Argo-1day chlorophyllÂ a is slightly higher during early May down to â¼100âm depth.\n\nThese earlier increases in chlorophyllÂ a concentrations in May due to modified model T and S may be attributed to the earlier shoaling of the MLD in the REF-Argo-1day case (Fig.Â 8), which is in better agreement with the estimated BGC-Argo MLD. Shallower MLDs may decrease the light limitation on phytoplankton growth and thus conditions suitable for growth may occur earlier compared to the REF-WOA-1year case. At the end of the growth season, during October (especially in 2015), the deeper MLD in the REF-Argo-1day case (in better agreement with the estimated BGC-Argo MLD) allows for greater intrusion by nutrients into the nutrient-limited surface layers. This allows more productivity during these late summer periods, which is prominent in the â¼25â100âm depth range. These noted differences correspond to the changes in biology when the model T and S are altered by strongly relaxing them to the BGC-Argo T and S, and they showcase the changes in biology that occur when only the model physics is changed.\n\nAfter minimizing the model physics errors and the resulting errors in biology, we can identify and target the differences between the simulated and observed chlorophyllÂ a. To identify the differences, we compare the estimated chlorophyllÂ a of the REF-Argo-1day simulation to the observed chlorophyllÂ a from BGC-Argo. In a similar fashion to Fig.Â 9d, the observed chlorophyllÂ a is subtracted from the REF-Argo-1day chlorophyllÂ a (Fig.Â 9e). With this comparison, we detect important patterns of differences: (1)Â the model fails to reproduce a distinct deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) as the difference is always highly negative throughout JuneâSeptember in the 20â50âm depth range (and sometimes as deep as 75âm) and highly positive near the surface, and (2)Â the timing of spring bloom initiation is late, as the difference is small and negative during AprilâMay, which is consistent with the simulated shallower MLD during this period.\n\n3.3.2âPhytoplankton growth formulation and parameterization\n\nPrior to discussing the changes to the model, it is important to elaborate on the effect of the uncertainty of the BGC-Argo data, as we rely on this dataset to exert changes to the model code and parameterization. As is the nature of observations, they all are different from the true value, and there will be mismatches (Skogen etÂ al.,Â 2021), even in the case of in situ chlorophyllÂ a bottle samples. Nevertheless, while we acknowledge that there are mismatches between different datasets (Fig.Â 4), we can still retrieve enough information from the BGC-Argo dataset to detect model shortcomings and propose improvements. For example, in every case where the model was nudged towards the BGC-Argo temperature, stronger relaxations result in a better match between the model T and the SST, which is a dataset that is independent of BGC-Argo (Fig.Â 7). Similarly, in the case of the BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a uncertainty, we are not pursuing a precise one-to-one match between the model and BGC-Argo but exploring notable differences that should be improved regardless of the concentration differences. As such, there are fundamental errors in the model that need to be addressed, i.e.Â the late bloom, which disrupts the timing of energy transfer to the upper trophic levels, and the absence of the DCM, which is the production that is not accounted for in the model. These fundamental dynamics are observed in the BGC-Argo data even if they may not be represented with precise accuracy. Therefore, in the experimental phase, we focus on these two issues and investigate ways to improve the mechanics of the model in general. Noting these, fine-tuning model parameters in a follow-up study would require more research on the effect of the BGC-Argo data uncertainty.\n\nThere are various hypotheses on the effect of mixing or stratification on the initiation of the spring bloom in the north North Atlantic, ranging from the âcritical stratification thresholdâ (Sverdrup,Â 1953), where sufficiently abundant light due to shallower convective mixing allows the growth to exceed losses, to the âdilutionârecoupling hypothesisâ, where deep winter mixing dilutes prey and predators, thus decoupling phytoplankton growth and grazing loss rates by reducing encounter rates (Behrenfeld,Â 2010). Later during the spring stratification, phytoplankton and zooplankton recouple with enhanced growth rates due to increased light abundance and greater grazing rates due to increased encounter rates. For the Nordic seas, Mignot etÂ al. (2016) suggests that the photoperiod (the number of hours of light experienced by the phytoplankton daily) exceeds a critical value. Common to all of these hypotheses is the idea that stratification plays an important role in phytoplankton productivity, and errors in the model physics can thus be an important source of errors in the modelled biogeochemistry. However, we have shown the reduction in model physics errors achieved by relaxing the model T and S to the observed values in Sect.Â 3.2 and documented the changes in biogeochemistry in Sect.Â 3.3.1. This suggests that the major source of error in phytoplankton growth is related to the biogeochemical model.\n\nAlso common to all these hypotheses is the critical importance of light abundance. Even in the case of Behrenfeld (2010), which focuses more on prey/predator interactions, light has a central role. During periods where phytoplanton are decoupled from zooplankton, the phytoplankton are still dependent on light to sustain growth. However, neither REF-WOA-1day nor REF-Argo-1day simulations reproduce the winter biomass detected by BGC-Argo (Fig.Â 9a and e). Both the late bloom and the absence of a DCM suggest that the modelled phytoplankton growth is too low under low-light conditions. This evidence is supported by the model growth limitation results (Fig.Â 10), which show that the growth is light limited during low-light conditions.\n\nA prime candidate for growth limitation due to low light could be high light attenuation, but this is unlikely in the present case as the low growth occurs throughout the year; hence, in the case of a late bloom, there is not enough phytoplankton to cause excess self-shading. This suggests that the model phytoplankton are not optimally utilizing the available light (PAR). The default (REF experiments) ECOSMO II(CHL) formulation for light limitation (Eq.Â 9) defines the light limitation as a hyperbolic tangent curve with a photosynthesis efficiency multiplier. This function is later multiplied by the maximum growth rate, but it does not introduce variability in various conditions (e.g.Â light intensity, internal cellular structure). The strength of growth is moderated by the efficiency constant, which can increase/decrease the productivity as a whole rather than introducing seasonality or variations at different depths.\n\nTo achieve a certain level of variability in the EXP simulations, we have introduced a more dynamic light limitation on growth (Eq.Â 18) that takes into account the C:Chl ratio, which is defined as a function of light intensity. This formulation introduces enhanced productivity in the case of high intra-cellular chlorophyllÂ a content, which the model reproduces for low-light conditions. By introducing this functionality, we disrupted the fine balance of the model parameterization, and we therefore needed to modify some of the parameters related to phytoplankton growth and, in turn, the grazing rates. The aim with this study is not to fine-tune the model parameters but to showcase the ability to use the BGC-Argo buoys as tools for model improvements. Fine-tuning the model parameters requires a cluster of model experiments and multi-regional representations, whereas we focus on a limited number of BGC-Argo tracks here. We have performed a series of experiments on model parameters to present the value added to the model and show how the model can be objectively validated using the BGC-Argo data. TableÂ 2 summarizes the changes to the parameters which lead to a decrease in the maximum phytoplankton growth rate. We decreased the grazing pressure of the zooplankton on the phytoplankton to balance this change. Due to the lower zooplankton food intake, we also decreased their mortality rate to sustain the zooplankton biomass.\n\n3.3.3âEvaluation of the updated ECOSMO II(CHL) formulation\n\nThe results for the experiments described in Sect.Â 3.3.2 are presented in Fig.Â 11. The simulated chlorophyllÂ a (Fig.Â 11a) shows bloom initiation in April for both 2014 and 2015, with peak concentrations reached in May, followed by consecutive decreases and increases in concentration at the surface throughout the summer and prominent DCMs within the 20â50âm depth interval during JulyâSeptember. Similar to the previous simulations, after the DCM period, with the increase in MLDs, late summer peaks occur as deep as 75âm in October. At its highest, the chlorophyllÂ a concentration is â¼5â6âmgâChlâmâ3.\n\nWhile, in general, the simulated chlorophyllÂ a is similar to that described in Sect.Â 3.3.1, there are notable structural differences between EXP-Argo-1day and REF-Argo-1day (REF-Argo-1day is subtracted from EXP-Argo-1day in Fig.Â 11b): (1)Â the initiation and the peak of the spring bloom occur earlier, and (2)Â the summer subsurface chlorophyllÂ a is more prominent in the EXP-Argo-1day simulation. As the spring bloom occurs earlier, the grazing pressure and the nutrient limitation (not shown) also initiate earlier. Both increasing the grazing pressure and increasing the nutrient limitation result in a decreased chlorophyllÂ a concentration. During the chlorophyllÂ a concentration decrease in EXP-Argo-1day, REF-Argo-1day is experiencing its peak bloom. This misalignment in the chlorophyllÂ a concentration peaks indicate consecutive high positive or negative differences (Fig.Â 11b). Similar positive or negative differences appear throughout the summer at the surface, suggesting that the phytoplankton growth versus loss imbalance has shifted to occur earlier, resulting in mismatches in local peak concentration timings. During JulyâSeptember, EXP-Argo-1day simulates higher chlorophyllÂ a levels below the surface (20â50âm), along with lower values towards the surface, suggesting the presence of a DCM. The late-summer surface chlorophyllÂ a concentrations are also higher in EXP-Argo-1day.\n\nThe differences between EXP-Argo-1day and BGC-Argo chlorophyllÂ a (BGC-Argo is subtracted from EXP-Argo-1day in Fig.Â 11c) suggest that the applied changes do not perfectly fix the model. The results still depict differences at the highly positive or negative ends. However, when comparing them to the differences between REF-Argo-1day and BGC-Argo (Fig.Â 9e), we can see that the high negative bias throughout JuneâSeptember for the 20â50âm depth range (see Sect.Â 3.3.1) is reduced, as Fig.Â 11c depicts highs and lows for the 20â50âm depth interval which indicate increased phytoplankton growth at lower light conditions. For better accuracy, the timing of peak concentrations in the DCM layer should be improved when tuning the model parameters in the future.\n\nIn addition to the visual comparison, the statistical analysis provides an objective evaluation of the model results (Fig.Â 12). The high model bias and rmse during MarchâApril are significantly decreased in the EXP-Argo-1day simulation, which can be attributed to an earlier bloom (in better agreement with the observed values). Similarly, the subsurface bias and rmse are improved during JulyâOctober, especially below 50âm. These improvements suggest that the model is now able to represent effective growth during low-light conditions because the bias improvements for the highly negative ends show that the previously very low chlorophyllÂ a concentrations are increased under low-light conditions, which was our primary target for model improvement.\n\nThe simulated chlorophyllÂ a still has flaws, including occasionally being too high. For example, although the timing of the spring bloom has improved, the peak concentrations are high for AprilâMay (Fig.Â 11c). The late-summer concentrations during SeptemberâOctober are also high, which is more pronounced in 2014. Although the model occasionally produces higher DCM concentrations, those differences can be partially attributed to the dislocated depth positioning of the observed DCM. For example, during JulyâAugustÂ 2014 (Figs.Â 9a and 11a), the observed DCM location ascends from below 25âm to above it, whereas the model DCM location descends from above 25âm to below it. The model does not produce a DCM during mid-June to early JulyÂ 2015, thus leading to a negative difference. However, similar to the case in 2014, from mid-July to September there is a mismatch in the depth location of the DCM. Apart from these major differences, the model has shifted from a negative bias at the surface to a positive bias (which is more prominent within 0â40âm).\n\nTo improve the clarity of our experimental study and the reasoning behind our thought process, we have focused only on BGC-Argo 6902547 in the main text of this paper. This allowed us to present how one can approach our framework for model evaluation and improvement. However, an argument can be raised that our changes to the model formulation and parameterization are case specific, i.e. they only apply to BGC-Argo 6902547, which was located in the Norwegian Sea between 2014â2016. In response to this argument, we point out that we targeted the phytoplankton growth under low-light conditions, as we concluded this was necessary for the model based on what the experiments revealed (see Sect.Â 3.3.2). The parameter changes given in TableÂ 2 represent parameter tuning to adapt the model to its new formulation for growth. Thus, although the prescribed parameters target the specific case of BGC-Argo 6902547, the formulation change for low-light conditions should benefit the model in general, which was the case in other experiments we conducted in this study. We did not include the results of those experiments here, but the alternatives to Figs.Â 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 for each specific experiment are provided in the Supplement. All reference experiments (REF simulations) were mostly light limited, whereas every modified model experiment (EXP simulations) showed objectively improved results for light-limited conditions according to the assessment statistics (see the Supplement).\n\nThese experiments were not only located in the Norwegian Sea; they covered various regions in the northern North Atlantic (Fig.Â 1), showing that the changes can improve modelling results throughout the northern North Atlantic, which is the main region that ECOSMO II(CHL) was actively developed for (Yumruktepe etÂ al.,Â 2022b). As discussed above, fine-tuning is necessary, as the model is too productive, which is also the case for other experiments presented in this study. However, the fine-tuning of the parameters is beyond the focus of this study, as it requires detailed sensitivity analyses. Here we have focused on building a framework where BGC-Argo can be easily used for driving the model physics and, at the same time, provides a high-resolution dataset for its evaluation. This paper is an example of how one can approach this framework. A follow-up study is needed to fine-tune the model parameters using multiple BGC-Argo tracks (and to update the number of tracks with the most recent BGC-Argo deployments) in order to support model improvements in a 3D-model domain.\n\n3.4âDiscussion of the relaxation timescales\n\nAn important issue which we briefly discussed earlier (see Sect.Â 3.2) is the choice of the relaxation timescale used for T and S. Referencing the T, S and MLD comparisons (Figs.Â 6, 7 and 8), we settled on the use of the 1âd relaxation timescale, as the model physics performance was (visually) better when using a short timescale. Following up on this decision, we hypothesized that the physical correction would also lead to improved performance of the modelled biogeochemistry. It is important to objectively analyse and quantify the improvements and prove that the hypothesis is valid.\n\nThe bias and rmse across the different BGC-Argo tracks used in this study for each relaxation timescale are depicted in Figs.Â 3, 6, 7 and 8 (Fig.Â 13). Since the effects of the relaxation timescales were more prominent during the winter and spring periods (Figs.Â 7 and 8), and since the days are short at high latitudes during winter, the statistics we present in Fig.Â 13 are the averages of the data points in Fig.Â 12 for MarchâMay in the 0â200âm depth range. In general, Fig.Â 13 depicts a common pattern: as the relaxation timescale increases, the simulations become statistically less representative of the observed data, with the statistics for some BGC-Argo track experiments varying more than those for other experiments. The 6902547 case presented in detail in this study varies moderately. Since both the physics and the chlorophyllÂ a respond more positively with shorter relaxation timescales, for this kind of approach, we suggest using a timescale that is as short as possible. We note that the differences in statistics are marginal for timescales shorter than the 10âd relaxation scale. In these cases, the scale will be decided upon based on how flexible towards the BGC-Argo T and S the model physics are intended to be. The model MLD for the 10âd scale (Fig.Â 8) is comparable to that for the 1âd scale.\n\nOne can argue that the statistical differences between the timescale experiments are not strikingly different, and, as such, the choice of a different timescale would be arbitrary. We argue that even if the statistical differences are relatively low for the particular case of the Nordic seas, the relaxation to climatology (WOA18) is statistically the least capable. Using climatology data, the relaxation scheme will miss anomalous events and will thus poorly represent the inter-annual variability. Capturing such variability plays an important role in understanding the ecosystem dynamics of regions where the seasonal and annual productivity is highly dependent on the strength and duration of vertical mixing events due to nutrient limitation, such as the subtropical North Atlantic (Siegel etÂ al.,Â 1999; Neuer etÂ al.,Â 2007; Helmke etÂ al.,Â 2010; Yumruktepe etÂ al.,Â 2020). Correcting the model winter physics (e.g.Â the timing and depth extent of the MLD and the mesoscale activity) will not only improve the model biogeochemistry in general; it will also introduce inter-annual variability.\n\nThe framework we have presented in this study may yield important applications for regions with nutrient limitation. In our case, except in the summer months, the biogeochemistry is not nutrient limited (Fig.Â 10bâd), and the correction we applied using the BGC-Argo physics is therefore mainly related to the light limitation and the strength of vertical mixing. While improving the strength of convective mixing, we improved the timing of the spring bloom, but the overall effect on the total productivity could be more significant in nutrient-limited regions. This hypothesis was not tested in this study, but we suggest that this would be a valuable follow-up study.\n\nIn this study, we established a 1D ocean modelling framework that employs BGC-Argo buoys for improving and evaluating biogeochemical process representations. The code we developed for this study is written in a generic format, and any BGC-Argo (or Argo if biogeochemical validation is not required) trajectory data can be used as the physical setting for a biogeochemistry simulation. The supplied code (see the âCode and data availabilityâ section) prepares a 1D model setup by creating atmospheric forcing, climatological and Argo relaxation data along the Argo track. The framework uses the well-established GOTM physics model and The Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) biogeochemical model coupler. These allow the experiments to be set up quickly and the application of a wide range of biogeochemical models. In this study, we focused on presenting the framework, its approach and an example use case. The use case shows how the modeller can set up the experiments from scratch, so this article is also a guide to replicating similar experiments with any BGC-Argo buoy.\n\nIn addition to the presentation of technical details, we have showcased how the framework can be used to improve biogeochemical models using both the physical and biogeochemical Argo data. As our focus in this study was on presenting the technical approach, our experiments were limited to simulating the observed chlorophyllÂ a from a limited number of buoys. Thus, immediate follow-up work to this study that utilizes the framework in a scientific focused approach is essential. We suggest extending the approach using other BGC-Argo variables such as oxygen, light, nitrate and particle backscatter. The combined use of these variables in the analyses would provide a more complete picture of light vs.Â nutrient limitation and the timing and depths of biogeochemical processes as well as estimates of organic matter concentrations. Such an assessment would allow for a more in-depth tuning of the model dynamics. An interesting approach would be to construct a similar study for regions where the oceanic production is highly dependent on the vertical transfer of nutrients to the surface, as improving the model physics using the BGC-Argo buoys may benefit modelling studies of regions with high nutrient limitation. A regional (or global) assessment of the biogeochemical variables using the BGC-Argo dataset (which has matured for over a decade) together with the improved models may allow an understanding of the trends in these variables.\n\nOn the topic of tuning, a planned follow-up to this study focuses on the application of more systematic parameter tuning approaches (e.g.Â Gharamti etÂ al.,Â 2017) compared to the relatively simple exercise presented here. In the future, the number of buoys that are used in the experiments should be increased, preferably establishing a region-wide sample set, and a detailed sensitivity analysis should be performed for a wider parameter set. For instance, we note that the model chlorophyllÂ a is at the higher end with the parameter values chosen in this study (see Sect.Â 3.3.3). Dedicated parameter tuning approaches should consider uncertainties in the BGC-Argo data as well as the uncertainty ranges of the tuned parameters. Because this study focused on improving the model formulation (i.e.Â increasing growth rates under low-light conditions) rather than model parameter fine tuning, a dedicated assessment of BGC-Argo data errors was not included. To limit the effects of observation uncertainties, we only included (see Sect.Â 2.1.1) the âadjustedâ BGC-Argo variables (i.e.Â temperature, salinity, pressure and chlorophyllÂ a), which provide either a âreal-time-adjustedâ or a âdelayed-modeâ data control and correction (Bittig etÂ al.,Â 2019). Despite applying a level of correction, there are still observational errors present. For example, the measured âfluorescence chlorophyllÂ a concentrationâ to âchlorophyllÂ a pigment concentrationâ ratio can vary due to various factors, which can lead to an uncertainty as high as Â±300â% (Roesler etÂ al.,Â 2017). However, some of these errors can be reduced to a maximum of 0.12âmgâChlâmâ3, corresponding to an average reduction of Â±40â% (Johnson etÂ al.,Â 2017; Bittig etÂ al.,Â 2019). On the other hand, the BGC-Argo estimated particulate organic carbon (POC) uncertainty is lower but can be as high as 40âmgâCâmâ3, about 50â%. In the case of oxygen, the sensors show a strong drift (on the order of â5â%âyrâ1 between calibration and deployment), this can be corrected (to approx.Â 1.0â1.5âÂµmolâkgâ1) with surface measurement adjustments along the track (Bittig etÂ al.,Â 2018). Similar uncertainties that exist for all the other BGC-Argo variables should also be accounted for in model validation studies.\n\nWe envision an ensemble simulation approach for model biogeochemical parameter tuning as a follow-up study where we construct a suite of ensemble experiments with systematic perturbations of selected model parameters within a Â± uncertainty range from the respective reference parameter value. However, depending on the number of modified parameters and BGC-Argo buoys, the number of experiments can be in the thousands, which raises the question of how to select the parameter set(s) that yields the best results objectively. The statistical analyses performed in this study were done on a limited number of BGC-Argo buoys and a single biogeochemical variable (i.e.Â chlorophyllÂ a), and such an analysis may give inconclusive results in a fine-tuning parameter study, given the BGC-Argo uncertainty. Newer BGC-Argo buoys are equipped with multiple biogeochemical sensors, making the statistical analysis of a parameter fine-tuning experiment more robust as the number of experiments increases while also accounting for multiple BGC-Argo variables and their associated uncertainty ranges. The inclusion of the statistics for multiple BGC-Argo variables would enhance the ecosystem representation by the parameters, and multiple variables would provide more constraints to help achieve realistic representations. At that stage of the analyses, the uncertainty ranges of the observed variables can be included, and the search for the better-performing experiments could be narrowed down for the less uncertain variables (e.g.Â POC, oxygen) and widened for the more uncertain ones (e.g.Â chlorophyllÂ a). In addition, instead of directly incorporating the concentrations from the full experiment into the statistical analyses, valuable insights may be gained by separately assessing the timing of seasonal events driven by the mixed layer dynamics. Alternatively, comparing correlations between the model and the depth locations of key features in the BGC-Argo profiles, such as the nutricline, would give an insight to the mixing and production dynamics (e.g.Â Salon etÂ al.,Â 2019). These approaches would reduce the influence of observation errors but would rely on the consistency of the sensor along the track. Finally, a more elaborate data assimilation scheme that takes into account model variable and parameter uncertainties, such as one based on the ensemble Kalman filter, could be considered for use in this framework in an idealized setting to investigate whether or not the current model parameterization is suitable to represent the observed real-world process (e.g.Â Singh etÂ al.,Â 2022).\n\nIn parallel to fine-tuning the model parameters, it is equally important to further evaluate mechanistic approaches to phytoplankton growth, mortality, grazing pressure and organic matter export dynamics. Such mechanistic approaches allow the models to adapt to changing environmental conditions due to regional coverage, changes in climate and the state of the oceans. Our study demonstrates the possibility of designing and applying such approaches by considering (1)Â different regional coverages and (2)Â the ever-growing time period covered by BGC-Argo data, allowing us to investigate the model discrepancy at a large scale but also at the local scale when considering (3)Â high-resolution depth and time coverage. The study presented here is an example of the latter, as we detected a shortcoming of the simulated primary production in low-light environments and applied a mechanistic change to the model chlorophyllÂ a dynamics with minor parameter tuning. This application was an initial attempt to showcase the utility of the framework to the wider scientific community, and a follow-up study that focuses on further mechanistic approaches is a natural extension of this study.\n\nWith this framework, we provide modellers with an alternative/additional dataset to in situ or remote sensing data, cover wider regions, depths and time periods, and, with the least effort, make these data points available for model evaluation. We envision advancements in the understanding of the functioning of marine biogeochemistry through the use of models which will be improved with the use of this framework. The cost-effective nature of this framework should allow (1)Â the employment of multiple models of variable complexity, (2)Â the application of them to various regions and time periods to cover multiple ecosystems, (3)Â the improvement and fine-tuning of process formulations, (4)Â the comparison of results for a beyond-model-specific approach, and (5)Â ultimately, and most importantly, the application of these models in a 3D setting to a range of use cases ranging from operational oceanography (e.g.Â Yumruktepe etÂ al.,Â 2022b) to regional or global links to higher trophic levels (e.g.Â Utne etÂ al.,Â 2012) and climate (e.g.Â Tjiputra etÂ al.,Â 2020). Through these use cases, models have the potential to be an important accessory to observations in efforts to improve our understanding of nature and the future of our oceans.\n\nBagniewski, W., Fennel, K., Perry, M.
