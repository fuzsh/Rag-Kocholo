        "text": "Before you rent\n\nChoose wisely. In 2019 we introduced our multi-product system which helps you choose a car based on your needs and easily see the final price. Car rental insurance can be tricky to navigate and often isn't what you expect, by booking with us direct you'll receive the correct insurance for your rental.\n\nWhen you collect your vehicle\n\nPlan ahead. We recommend planning your route before you leave, especially when renting a car at an airport. Are you sure where you're meeting your chaperone or where the rental desk is? Your confirmation email will have the contact information for the location, so we suggest saving the number in your phone ahead of time.\n\nHave the correct documents ready. We try and keep the check in process as painless as possible but we do need to process certain information for legal reasons so having these ready ahead of time can help speed up the process. Make sure you have your booking details ready, along with your driving licence, passport and valid credit card.\n\nComplete a vehicle check. It's essential when you are taken to your car you complete a Vehicle Condition Report (VCR) and note any existing damage, paying particular attention to the five damage hotspots. If you don't report this, you may be liable for these damages when you return the vehicle. We don't want you to get caught out, so we've put together a handy vehicle inspection video to help you check everything thoroughly.\n\nWhile you rent\n\nTake care. Unfortunately you may be liable for any damage caused to a vehicle in your care, and this will vary depending on the product you choose. A large proportion of damages to any car can be dings you pick up in car parks, so be mindful when space is limited and park further away and walk a little further to your destination."
