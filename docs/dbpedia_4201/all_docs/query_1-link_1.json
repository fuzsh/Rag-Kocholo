        "text": "What sort of career are you building? How about one that allows you to spend five months every year on a boat in the Med ‚Äì not as crew ‚Äì but as an owner? I recently met Catherine Hodgson, author of a recent book called The Mentoring Roadmap and CEO of a family business that sources and provides millions of dollars a year of merchandise and beauty products into the retail sector. She spent seven years working for a global beauty products business until the early 2000s. But she realised that if she wanted a family, things would have to change, so she started her own company, which allowed her to determine her own time, travel schedule and, ultimately, destiny. She and her entrepreneurial husband travelled to China in the early days of what would become the economic miracle and set up supplier relationships with manufacturers in that country, who, in turn, became key suppliers of cheaply provided household goods. Thirty years later, she is still deeply involved in the business but has structured it in such a way that it gets easier and easier to manage it with a light touch. In addition to her day job, she is also a globally influential figure in the world of mentorship, having identified a need and later a methodology where high-performance members of the global YPO (Young Presidents Organisation) community could help each other perform better. She became chair of YPO Global Mentoring and created masterclasses and programs to further assist members worldwide. And yes, thanks to the marvels of modern communication and a greater openness to work-from-anywhere ‚Äì she is able to spend up to five months of each year travelling with her husband around the Mediterranean in the ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù boat they own. Sometimes, it requires scurrying up the mast with a cable clenched between their teeth to find a signal ‚Äì but those are minor inconveniences. #CareerBuilding #Entrepreneurship #Opportunity #Leadership #BruceWhitfield\n\nWhat would you do if you didn't have to worry about money and could do anything? That was my husband's recurring question over the last year to help me re-find the spark I was slowly losing. In 2019, my consulting company was doing well in Colombia, and I worked with fantastic clients in several Latin American countries. I was engaged in work that I enjoyed, and even when the entrepreneurship path wasn't easy, I felt pretty confident and \"believed in my ability to figure it out.\" In August of that year, my husband and I relocated to Boston. I took a break from consulting work to find a job that would provide me with a positive work environment similar to what I had in my home country, as well as an opportunity to integrate into the local community. After working for four years and gaining several work experiences, I realized I had lost my way. But let's return to the question: What would you do if you didn't have to worry about money and could do anything? I had to hit rock bottom and admit that I didn't have the answer, that more reflection and more time alone thinking were getting me nowhere. Wait. I have gone through this process of uncertainty several times. As a former corporate innovator and consultant, I have always told teammates and clients that innovation processes are all about reducing uncertainty. What if I apply the same tools, processes, and strategies that I have used to help my clients to my own professional development? That's how Workinnprogress came to life.

The most successful individuals seek to attain high-performance because they intuitively believe in its value. ‚ïî They know they have to stay ahead of the curve and the only way to do that is to get another person's perspective on their habits, behaviours, thoughts, decision making and ability to execute. 2. The people that achieve the most are also the ones that invest in themselves more. ‚ïî Not only do they understand the importance of investing in themselves, they know what to invest in. They look at their skills, and their areas of improvement, and look for support in a very empowered way. Nothing gets in the way of their self-assuredness. 3. The individuals who work on letting go of their cynicism and doubtful nature gain a large competitive advantage over their peers. If you think you're too successful to further optimise your performance or that these sessions couldn't possibly apply to you, think again. The whole premise of high-performance is that you can ALWAYS optimise how you show up in every area of life. What kind of professional are you? What kind of family member? What kind of citizen? What kind of significant other? 4. Entrepreneurs who actively look to improve every area of their lives (relationships, business, social impact, travel, finances, family, etc.), stay motivated for longer periods. ‚ïî When you're committed to being better, across the board, you understand that the journey is lifelong and that it is not a means to an end. This state of being doesn't need quick wins or adrenalin rushes. If you aren't doing great in one area of life, the other areas carry you, and this creates balance. You show up every day knowing that there's a lot to achieve and that every area of life deserves to be worked on. 5. The professionals who are willing to look themselves in the mirror and confront their darker side can develop layers of confidence, grit and resilience that give them an incredible edge. ‚ïî The key to being the best version of yourself is to cut through the BS. You'll have to look at yourself in a very vulnerable way and it's going to take immense courage, but it's worth it. #embraceyourprocess The picture is from my year of travel in 2022 (Sintra, Portugal).\n\nüåü Exciting News! üåü I'm thrilled to share that I've recently had the incredible opportunity to take part in the Young Enterprise Programme! üéâ This transformative experience has been a journey of learning, growth, and collaboration. Through the programme, I had the chance to work alongside a dynamic team of like-minded individuals, all passionate about entrepreneurship and innovation. We navigated the highs and lows of starting and managing a business, from brainstorming unique ideas to creating comprehensive business plans and pitching to potential investors. Some key takeaways from this amazing experience: üí° Teamwork and Collaboration: Working with a diverse group of talented peers taught me the true power of teamwork. Each member brought unique skills to the table, and together we achieved more than we ever could individually. üìä Business Acumen: From financial planning to marketing strategies, the programme provided a hands-on approach to understanding the intricacies of running a successful business. This practical knowledge is something I will carry forward in my career. üöÄ Resilience and Adaptability: The entrepreneurial journey is filled with challenges and setbacks. Having over 20 members, what we thought would be an advantage, proved to be a challenge in disguise. Turns out coordinating a group of over 20 members, with so many contrasting views and ideas is more difficult than it looks. This programme reinforced the importance of resilience and adaptability in overcoming obstacles and staying focused on our goals. I'm incredibly grateful to Young Enterprise for this opportunity and to my team and mentors for their support and guidance. This experience has not only enhanced my business skills but also inspired me to pursue my entrepreneurial ambitions with renewed vigour. Looking forward to applying these lessons in my future endeavours and staying connected with the amazing network I've built through this programme. Here's to new beginnings and endless possibilities! üöÄ #YoungEnterprise #Entrepreneurship #TeamWork #BusinessSkills #GrowthMindset #Innovation\n\nEmbrace Change, Ignite Success: Highly Gratifying Entrepreneurial Journey Experience Early in my career in Marketing and Sales across LATAM, I dove into a regional Commercial Excellence project led by a top consulting firm. It was a pivotal experience that sparked my passion for optimizing commercial strategies with my analytical prowess. Although offered a path to join the consultancy, I remained dedicated to advancing within my pharmaceutical company. Fast forward a couple of years, a merger opened doors to a global Commercial Excellence role, enriching my expertise. Yet, I felt a plateau in my growth trajectory after some years in that role. Undeterred, I explored a few consulting opportunities, only to encounter skepticism about age and industry tenure at that time. But I refused to let age define my aspirations. Five years ago, at the age of 48, I took a leap of faith, founding my own consulting venture from scratch. The journey wasn't without challenges, but fuelled by passion, I embraced the dual challenge of business development and client projects. At the same time, it afforded me the opportunity to connect with numerous like-minded individuals who shared not only amazing expertise but also a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit. My takeaway? Never let age or naysayers deter you from pursuing your passion. Your drive and determination can defy expectations, leading to immensely fulfilling experiences.

SOPs are the blueprint to consistent excellence. They're like the secret recipe that turns your business operations into a well-choreographed dance. üï∫üíÉ Every task, every process, and every decision gets documented, ensuring that knowledge is not locked away in the minds of a few, but shared across your entire team. üåü Benefits that will make you a believer: Efficiency Boost: SOPs eliminate guesswork and ambiguity, streamlining your workflows like a well-oiled machine. Quality Control: Consistency in processes leads to consistent high-quality outcomes, delighting your customers and clients. Onboarding Magic: New team members can hit the ground running, thanks to clear instructions and guidelines. Scaling Made Easy: As your business grows, SOPs make expansion smoother by ensuring standardized practices. Risk Reduction: Minimize errors, mishaps, and compliance issues by following tried-and-true procedures. üõ†Ô∏è Crafting Your SOPs Like a Pro: Identify Key Processes: Start by listing out your core business processes that need SOPs. It could be anything from client onboarding to inventory management. Break Down Steps: For each process, break down the steps involved. Be thorough and leave no stone unturned. Clear Language: Write in simple, jargon-free language. Remember, SOPs should be understandable even by someone new to the task. Visual Aids: Diagrams, flowcharts, and screenshots can amplify clarity and understanding. Feedback Loop: Regularly update your SOPs based on feedback and evolving best practices. üöÄ Ready to Embark? Creating SOPs might seem like a daunting task, but the rewards are truly remarkable. It's an investment that pays dividends in the form of efficiency, growth, and a well-functioning team. So, dust off that pen (or keyboard) and start crafting your business success story, one SOP at a time! üìäüíºüí™ #Nigeria #Lagos #Abuja #Nigerianstartups #Nigerianentrepreneurs #workfromhome #careers #marketing #digitalmarketing #technology #innovation #leadership #entrepreneurship #business #education #finance #HR #socialmedia #marketingstrategy #branding #contentmarketing #productivity #networking #inspiration #growthmindset\n\n‚§µÔ∏è Business Empire with Two Buses (and Zero Textbooks) üöåü§©üíØ ‚úÖTwo years ago, my friend and I made a big decision. I chose the MBA route, spending ‚Çπ20 lakhs hoping for a comfortable corporate job. My friend decided to take a risk, investing ‚Çπ15 lakhs in two old buses to start his own transport business. ‚úÖToday, we're both doing well, but in very different ways. I have a good job with a good salary, thanks to the skills and knowledge I gained from my MBA. My friend, on the other hand, has turned his two buses into eight, and he's making ‚Çπ4-5 lakhs every month! He's his own boss and loving it. ‚û°Ô∏èOur stories show that there's no one right way to succeed. The MBA gave me a strong foundation in business and helped me get my foot in the door at a great company. It's a stepping stone towards my goal of becoming a leader in a big organization. ‚û°Ô∏èMy friend's path is different. He's passionate about his business and learned everything he knows by doing. He took a risk and it paid off big time. His success shows the power of hard work, determination, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. So, which path is better? It depends on what YOU want.üíØ‚úÖ ‚û°Ô∏èIf you like structure and learning in a classroom, and you dream of working for a big company, an MBA might be right for you. ‚û°Ô∏èBut if you're independent, like taking risks, and want to be your own boss, starting your own business could be the way to go. ‚úÖBoth paths can lead to success. The most important thing is to choose the path that fits your personality, your skills, and your dreams. So, which team are you on ‚ùìAre you a structured learner who thrives in a corporate environment, or a risk-taker with an entrepreneurial spirit? Share your thoughts and experiences below. ‚úÖLet's celebrate the diverse ways we can all achieve our goals and find fulfillment in our careers.
