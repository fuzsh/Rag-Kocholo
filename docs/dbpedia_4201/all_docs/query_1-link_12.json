        "text": "How did you become involved in film?\n\nI think when I was a child, my father was in the army in Turkey and had certain privileges which included being able to see everything at their very own cinema, almost every night I ' d go and watch all sorts of films.\n\nHave you ever studied film?\n\nYes and no , I have two great loves in my life, the first is psychology and the second is film so I had to decide which Id pursue, because I didnt have the opportunity to study film I chose psychology at university in Istanbul. I ended up quitting that for various reasons and I started focusing on cinema again, I wanted to be a member of the audience for a while to simply observe. I was working as a general manager of a counselling centre but, in the middle of the day when I began to tire of people, Id just leave the place, go to the cinema for a while before come back! Id also insist on going to the Istanbul film festival every year, whatever I was doing Id drop everything for 15 days and nights. Because of that I got kicked out or left many jobs. When I came over here about 7 years ago I was in a bit of a mess so I set about watching films and building an archive, Id watch 3 or 4 a day and it was a form of recovery for me. Id watch absolutely anything, from TV or at the NFT because Im a member but very rarely at western cinemas and Ive ended up with about 500 on video. Then I did an access course at TowerHamlets College; the access was appalling but I managed to complete it. After that I was accepted to the Film Studies course at the University of North London. It has the worst management and access I have ever seen in this country. It didn't work me. So, I have just left it in the air. I might go back one day.\n\nIs your interest in independent film reflected in the films chosen for the festival?\n\nThats another thing entirely. The disability film culture is very neglected so we've got our hands on everything we could. Last years festival was a last minute decision, 3 months before it took place we decided to arrange it, there was neither a plan nor a budget so we worked with what we had. This year decisions made by the team at The London Disability Arts Forum."
