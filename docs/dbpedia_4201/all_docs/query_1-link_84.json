        "text": "Today, I would like to share some of our experiences and lessons-learned from the Series B fundraising process, in case you are interested in embarking on a similar journey in the near future. I believe most of these experiences are applicable to other fundraising stages as well. Thus, please feel free to drop me a comment if you have any questions or recommendations before your upcoming fundraising, regardless of its stage. Now let’s dive into the real stuff.\n\nLesson 1: Do not start reaching out to VCs before you prepare everything you will need\n\nI joined the SOCRadar team in February 2023 and we began the fundraising process with Huzeyfe. Instead of immediately reaching out to VCs, we first decided to prepare necessary documents like pitch deck, data room, one-pager etc. while meeting with interested inbound investors. Our plan was to meet VCs and prepare documents simultaneously. However, we found out that this approach wasn’t ideal as investors often requested immediate access to our data room, which wasn’t ready at the time. Consequently, we missed several follow-up opportunities since investors lost their interest by not seeing the data they wanted. We learned that impressing investors in the initial call and promptly providing any materials needed is crucial to maintaining their interest while they are still “hyped” about your company.\n\nLesson 2: Learn from the prominent investors\n\nLet’s be honest: not every investor you meet will invest in your company. Some will thank you after the first meeting, while others will do so after spending considerable time. Thus, you should be able to differentiate which investors are worth your time, considering your expectations. For example, we had serious discussions with prominent investors from our industry but did not secure investment from them. However, during their “soft DD” process, they asked quality questions and requested data we were not even aware of. During this process, we updated all our documentation and discovered many new ways to use the data we had. So even if it doesn’t result in an investment, having a quality discussion with prominent investors is never a waste of time but rather a rare learning opportunity.\n\nLesson 3: Do your research about the fund before you meet them\n\nAfter meeting with several investors, Huzeyfe asked me to prepare a one-pager about the VCs we were going to meet. Let’s be honest: the CEO of a Series B stage startup that operates in 80+ countries might not have the time to check every VC and investor’s background. Thus, I started to prepare a one-pager about all the VCs we are going to meet and included details like:\n\n● Quick summary of the VC: where they are based, which geographies they invest in, highlight investments, etc.\n\n● Average ticket size and fund size: Does their ticket size fit your current round, and do they have a big enough fund to back you in future rounds?\n\n● Relevant investments: Have they invested in any other company from your industry, and at which stage?\n\n● Background of the investors: Do they have technical understanding of your field? This helps adjust your technical tone during your pitch.\n\n● Recent activities: Have they published any relevant articles or blog posts recently related to your company’s operations? This allows you to highlight your ideas in that field.\n\nAfter starting to prepare these one-pagers, our conversations with the investors became much more fruitful as we already had an idea of tangible and intangible outcomes from that discussion prior to the call. For example, after meeting with an investor of a prominent MSSP, we requested an intro and they immediately facilitated it.\n\nLesson 4: What is your IPP (ideal partner profile)?\n\nAs everyone says, your investors are not only a source of capital; they are also partners who will help you in your growth journey. Thus, you should decide what your ideal partner profile is (plus, investors ask this question at the end of the first meeting). To do this, you should first be aware of your weaknesses and strengths so that you can find partners who will cover your weaknesses when they come in. For example, we were looking for a partner with deep knowledge and a strong network in the US market to support our growth there. In the end, we received investment from Peakspan. Now, we are confident that we have a strong partner who will help us through our US expansion.\n\nLesson 5: Do not try to hide your weaknesses\n\nBefore starting your fundraising process, you should accept one real truth: your company is still at an early stage and has weaknesses, just like every other company out there. Investors are also aware of this fact. Thus, instead of trying to hide your weaknesses, use your energy to detect all of them, develop a reasoning for each, and explain how you plan to tackle these challenges. If you follow these steps, it will be easier for you to find your ideal partner, as investors with deep expertise in those areas will be more excited to partner up with you.\n\nLesson 6: Prioritize what investors want to see, not what you want to show\n\nYou should keep in mind that most investors meet with hundreds of startups every month and are always listening to founders who are extremely excited about their ideas. However, what excites you might not be equally exciting for VCs. Instead, what they want to see is straightforward, and it is easy to get them hyped about your company if you can show these in the most concise way:\n\n● Management team: VCs first look at your management team (or founders in earlier stages) to understand if you have what it takes to get things done.\n\n● KPIs: I won’t list all the KPIs we are tracking since they vary by industry and stage. Look for prominent investors’ blog posts to see what they want to see.\n\n● The problem and your solution: Be as straightforward as possible when discussing the problem and your solution, and most importantly, what makes you different from your competitors. Remember, the first thing VCs do after the initial meeting is to check your competitors.\n\nIf you can clearly show these three elements, it will be much easier to convince investors.\n\nLesson 7: Use your early investors’ network and support\n\nYou should always remember that your investors are your trusted partners, helping you take a step forward. Thus, your investors are equally excited and eager to complete your next round and grow your company with new investors aboard. During our Series B round, the 212 team was always there for us, answering our questions and guiding us through the process. However, you should be proactive in asking for their support, considering you are not the only company in their portfolio. Additionally, they are well-versed in pitch decks, data rooms, and everything else that investors may want to see. Which means, they can better assess your documentation and help you to prepare the best one.\n\nLesson 8: Have your due diligence “champion” in the team\n\nStarting from the term sheet discussions, due diligence is a challenging process. There is always data exchange between two parties, and sometimes it can be so hectic and impossible to follow what is going on. In these times, having a “DD champion” in your team who will streamline the process and continuously follow up with the next steps can be your savior. In our case, Burcu — our CFO — was the main person who led all the processes during our due diligence, and I am sure that our investors are also grateful to have her on the team. During our due diligence, we have a golden rule in our team: all the data sent to investors will be routed through either me or Burcu so that we can easily track what has been sent or not. Otherwise, there would be so many points of contact for each discussion, and it would have been impossible to navigate."
