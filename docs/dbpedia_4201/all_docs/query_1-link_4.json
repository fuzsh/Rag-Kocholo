        "text": "We‚Äôre delighted to be working with Virgin Media Ireland on their digital transformation; great people at VMIE, a great programme team from Infosys, and a great example of headless BSS within a wider transformation programme. Integrating in to the BSS through the APIs allows VMIE to retain the best of their existing engagement layer whilst benefitting from all of the pre-integration at the fulfilment layer (catalogue, orchestration, charging, and billing). Made possible by the Cerillion Enterprise Catalogue (EPC) unifying the upstream feed of products to the multiple sales systems, and the service catalogue and rules to the Cerillion fulfilment. All of this benefits from the use of TM Forum Open APIs (catalogue, sales, order) to simplify the integration with the VMIE sales and CRM systems, including Pegasystems. Delivered from our EU private cloud, the convergent BSS for VMIE will support their fixed, mobile, and TV product lines, converging separate legacy platforms in to one solution. If you would like to know more about benefitting from Cerillion‚Äôs commitment to Open APIs, deploying Cerillion in a headless mode, or why we‚Äôre consistently at the top of the Real World Certifications then do come and see us at DTW - Ignite in Copenhagen next week. #VMIE #DigitalTransformation #BSSOSS #OpenAPI #TMForum\n\nDid you know that Delivery Roadmaps and Service Blurprints are two of the core services that we offer at Impact Signal?!
