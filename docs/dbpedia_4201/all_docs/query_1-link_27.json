        "text": "The Division of PEM has been heavily involved in education of fellows, residents, and medical students, as well as of faculty members and nurses, respiratory therapists, and other critical members of our healthcare teams. One of our faculty members, Cara Doughty, is the physician leader of the Texas Children's Hospital Simulation Center and the co-chair of the International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research, and Education (INSPIRE) and Bram Welch-Horan is on the board. Another faculty member, Elaine Fielder, is the program director of the pediatric residency program. The PEM Division Chief, Deborah Hsu, holds a number of leadership positions on the American Board of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine, the Subspecialty Pediatrics Investigative Network Steering Committee, and the Association of Pediatric Program Directors' Longitudinal Educational Assessment Research Network (APPD LEARN) Educational Development Committee. The division's commitment to education, and to the subsequent dissemination of educational products and rubrics, is evident from the publication list below.\n\nFaculty with a research focus on educational research and simulation medicine:\n\nKiyetta Alade, M.D., MEd: POCUS education\n\nEmail: alade@bcm.edu\n\nNichole Davis, M.D., MEd: disaster simulation\n\nEmail: nichole.davis@bcm.edu\n\nCara Doughty, M.D., MEd: simulation medicine\n\nEmail: cbdought@texaschildrens.org\n\nElaine Fielder, M.D.: graduate medical education\n\nEmail: ekfielde@texaschildrens.org\n\nDeborah Hsu, M.D., MEd: educational evaluation\n\nEmail: dhsu@bcm.edu\n\nKay Leaming-Van Zandt, M.D.: communication education\n\nEmail: kleaming@bcm.edu\n\nKim Little-Wienert, M.D., MEd: e-learning, simulation, standardization of handoffs\n\nEmail: kl135652@bcm.edu\n\nDaniel Lemke, M.D.: simulation\n\nEmail: Daniel.Lemke@bcm.edu\n\nMarideth Rus, M.D., MEd: simulation, handoffs in care\n\nEmail: rus@bcm.edu\n\nEsther Sampayo, M.D., MPH: fellowship education\n\nEmail: Esther.Sampayo@bcm.edu\n\nAndrea Vo, M.D.: trauma simulation\n\nEmail: andrea.vo@bcm.edu\n\nBram Welch-Horan, M.D.: simulation\n\nEmail: Bram.Welch-Horan@bcm.edu\n\nSharon Won, M.D.: simulation\n\nEmail: Sharon.Won@bcm.edu\n\nChumpitazi CE, Allister L, Cho C, Hoffman LA, Hsu D, Iyer M, Mangold K, Marino M, Randell KA, Ponce H, Hariharan S.
