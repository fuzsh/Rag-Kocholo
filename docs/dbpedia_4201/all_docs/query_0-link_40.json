Although these linkages are well known they are not always well understood. This is particularly true in complex hydrogeologic settings and/or with respect to new and emerging contaminants. This presentation will describe two separate studies focused on characterizing water and solute exchange between groundwater and surface water. The overall objective of the first study is to describe the spatial and temporal variability in water and iron exchange between a ferruginous, meromictic kettle lake and the underlying groundwater system in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Improving our understanding of the scale and variability of these exchanges is critical to constraining the coupled biogeochemical cycling of iron and carbon in ferruginous, meromictic lakes in previously glaciated terrains. The overall objective of the second study is to determine if and how groundwater participates in the attenuation of complex mixtures of wastewater effluent derived contaminants in Muddy Creek, a small effluent dominated stream in Coralville, Iowa. The contaminants of interest include pharmaceuticals, neonicotinoids, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Advancing our understanding of attenuation mechanisms for these complex mixtures in streams like Muddy Creek will contribute to our overall understanding of wastewater impacts on receiving streams in temperate environments, which are increasing due to urbanization and climate change. The results of both studies highlight the importance of opening up the ‘black box’ of the groundwater system with a diverse set of field measurements (e.g., geologic, hydraulic, biogeochemical) made at multiple scales to advance our understanding of water and solute exchange in these systems.\n\nPresenter: Dr. Caglar Koylu - Associate Professor, UI - GSS\n\nTitle: Analysis of U.S. internal migration using population-scale family tree data, 1789-1930\n\nAbstract: Analysis of long-term migration data is crucial for understanding the changing nature of the drivers of migration, regional disparities, demographic changes, and climate variability. Specifically, in the context of the U.S., the study of long-term migration is distinct because the European settlement was significantly influenced by land resources and economic prospects, highlighting the unique role of geographic and demographic expansion in shaping the nation's complex history, mindful of the profound effects on Indigenous populations. The increasing availability of digitized historical sources on genealogy websites have enabled numerous individuals to assemble and share their family trees. Only a handful of research teams have leveraged extensive datasets of user-contributed family trees, and cleaned, connected and deduplicated them to generate population-scale family trees to investigate social processes, particularly migration. In this presentation, Dr. Koylu will shed light on his team’s efforts to construct the largest connected family tree to date, connecting 40 million relatives spanning across several centuries and continents. He will delve into the innovative techniques that harness the power of geographic information science to analyze and visualize big family tree data. These efforts enable the assessment of how representative the tree data is of the overall population in the U.S., the exploration of migration patterns and kinship networks across geographic space and time and provide valuable insights and historical context crucial for understanding the ongoing socio-economic and demographic transformations.\n\nreminders:\n\nPlans of study - grad students due at grad college: 3/5/2024\n\nEarly registration - summer 2024: 3/4 - 3/8/24\n\nSpring break: 3/10 - 3/17/24\n\nEarly registration - fall 2024: 4/8 - 4/26/24\n\nLast day to drop a course - undergrad/grad: 4/15/24\n\nLast day to withdraw without collegiate approval - undergrad/grad: 4/15/24\n\nFinal exam reports due - grad - 4/16/24\n\nSingle thesis deposit (5pm CST) - 4/23/24\n\nClose of classes: 5/3/24\n\nFinal exam week: 5/6 - 5/10/24\n\nCommencement: 5/9 - 5/12/24\n\nFirst day of summer classes - 5/13/24\n\nStudents, Faculty, & Alumni: Distinguished Alumni Award nominations!\n\nSince 2019 your Earth and Environmental Science Alumni Board have announced a Distinguished Alumni Awardee.

These species represent some of the closest extinct relatives to all modern crocodiles. Here we sought to reassess the species Asiatosuchus grangeri Mook, 1940, a crocodile from the middle Eocene of China. Fossil specimens of this species were reexamined to create a detailed description from which to conduct a morphology based phylogenetic analysis. A. grangeri was found to be somewhat more derived than previously thought, and less closely related to other species that have previously been referred to the genus. The results of this analysis may also point towards an Asian lineage of early crocodile which persisted from the Late Cretaceous up to the Eocene. Further studies are required among basal crocodiles to both resolve the remaining degree of uncertainty in their phylogenetic relationships and incorporate these findings with molecular data of extant species.\n\n4/3, Wednesday, 1PM (CST) - Brandon Botha [Master’s Defense] - 349 Iowa Memorial Union [faculty advisor: Emily Finzel]\n\nTitle TBD\n\n4/16, Tuesday, 9:30AM (CST) - Nathanael Kilburg [Master’s Defense] - 345 Iowa Memorial Union [faculty advisor: David Peate]\n\n“Age and Petrogenesis of the Matlock ‘Keratophyre’ in Northwest Iowa”\n\nMineral exploration cores drilled in 1963 into a magnetic anomaly by the New Jersey Zinc Company in northwest Iowa found the ~2.7 Ga Otter Creek layered mafic intrusion stratigraphically overlain by the ~1.78 Ga Matlock “Keratophyre” (MK). The MK was logged in two of the drilled Matlock cores: C-5 and C-6. The MK was described as a dark gray porphyritic rhyolite unit in the subsurface Precambrian basement of Iowa that grades downward from a crystal-poor tuff (core C-6 and top of core C-5) into a volcanic flow breccia that contains mafic clasts from the underlying 2.7 Ga Otter Creek Layered Igneous Complex (core C-5). This project involved gathering new petrographic and compositional data to investigate the nature and petrogenesis of this highly altered, mixed rhyolite-basalt unit. A PXRF was used to survey compositional variations in the cores to aid sample selection for whole rock geochemistry and U-Pb zircon geochronology (high-Zr core sections). Zircon was recovered from two Matlock C-5 core sections, but the sample of crystal-poor tuff (C-6 core section) was barren. Zircons analyzed by LA-ICP-MS at the Arizona LaserChron Center yielded concordia ages of 1803 ± 4 Ma (sample C5 488-9) and 1810 ± 9 Ma (sample C5 1067), suggesting the MK is older than the previous estimate (~1.78 Ga). The ICP-MS data on 24 whole rock samples shows that the MK is not a keratophyre unit but instead a high potassium rhyolite that has been highly altered and variably leached in alkali elements, and that there are three distinct rhyolite units within the MK unit based on incompatible and immobile element ratios, such as Zr/Nb and La/Sm. The PXRF and whole rock geochemical data highlight an unusual amount of mafic clasts. These whole rock geochemical data and new in-situ zircon U-Pb ages provide additional context about the southern margin of the Superior Craton.\n\n6/6, Thursday, Time TBD (CST) - Samson Bruxvoort [Master’s Defense] - Location TBD [faculty advisor: Bill McClelland]\n\nTitle TBD\n\nJOB OPPORTUNITIES\n\nUNDERGRAD / ENTRY-LEVEL\n\nGraduate Student Research and Teaching Assistantships in Earth System Science - Umass Lowell - Lowell, Massachusetts\n\nClosing date: Mar 22, 2024\n\nThe Department of Environmental, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences (EEAS) at the University of Massachusetts Lowell offers a PhD program in Earth System Science and an MS program in Environmental Geoscience and Atmospheric Science.

The Department is interested in supporting innovative research and excellent early career geoscientists to work in collaboration with one or more faculty members.\n\nApplicants must contact potential supervisors in advance to discuss areas of common interest and proposal ideas. Applicants must obtain approval from a proposed supervisor to apply. Only applicants who have secured a potential supervisor willing to supervise will be considered. Faculty who may be eligible and available to supervise are listed here:\n\nhttps://www.es.utoronto.ca/people/faculty/\n\nNote that not all supervisors are taking on new lab personnel. Contact potential supervisors prior to applying.\n\nAbout this award: This endowed award was created thanks to a bequest from Dorothy M. Deane, widow of the late Prof Roger E Deane, an alumnus of the Department of Geology, University of Toronto (U of T). Prof Deane obtained a PhD in 1949 under the supervision of Prof Alexander Maclean, and returned to U of T as a faculty member in 1955, pursuing research in the areas of glacial geology and Pleistocene paleoenvironments. Prof Deane served as the inaugural Director of Research at the U of T Great Lakes Institute which eventually contributed to the founding of the U of T School of the Environment. Prof Deane died in a tragic boating accident near Tobermory, Ontario in 1965 while undertaking field work.\n\nSalary: CAD$61,000 per year\n\nTerm: The term is 1 year, with the possibility of renewal for 1 additional year. This is a full-time, in-person position.\n\nExpected start date: Start date is flexible between September 2024 and December 2024.\n\nApplication deadline: April 18 2024, 11:59 PM Eastern time\n\nSelection criteria: Applicants must have a PhD in Earth Sciences, Geology, Environmental Science or closely related field at the time of taking up the appointment.\n\nThe winner will be selected on the bases of academic excellence, merit of the proposal, and potential to contribute to the geosciences. Applications will also be evaluated on how the proposal merges the specialties of the applicant and the proposed supervisor, so submitted proposals should cover greater scope than a reiteration of the applicant’s doctoral work. Bringing new perspectives to the Department, and bringing experiences and meaningful plans for connecting to groups that have been historically marginalized in the geosciences, are also criteria that will be considered in our evaluation of excellence.\n\nHow to apply:\n\nA complete application includes:\n\nCover letter with the potential supervisor(s) name clearly stated (1 page maximum)\n\nResearch proposal (2 pages single spaced at most, excluding references)\n\nUpdated Curriculum Vitae\n\nThe names, addresses, email addresses and institutional affiliations of three referees.

Agua Salud maintains eight experimental watersheds established to better understand hydrology related ecosystem services provided by tropical forests in a seasonal climate and how they change with land use and climate change. Experimental watersheds include 13 instrumented weirs where stream flow measurements have been collected every 5 minutes for up to 15 years. Watershed land use treatments include 1) mature tropical forest (2 independent watersheds), 2) cattle pasture, 3) naturally regenerating secondary forest, 4) native species plantation, 5) teak plantation, 6) silvopasture, 7) invasive grass (Saccharum spontaneum), 8) land use mosaic. Additional weirs help track stream flow post clearing without cattle. The site also includes a metrological station and rain gauge network.\n\nThe Agua Salud experimental watersheds serve as a critically important tropical research facility, have contributed to past advances in fundamental hydrological theory, and are increasingly relevant to understanding watershed hydrologic response to land use and climate change. We seek a post-doctoral scholar eager to collaborate with us and expand the scientific impact of Aqua Salud. The successful candidate will work with existing long-term data sets as well as help oversee continuing stream flow data collection, curation, and management. Responsibilities will include participation in the evaluation of existing hydrology infrastructure. Existing long-term stream flow data is available for the post-doctoral scientist to work with in publications but will require modest assessment and potentially significant processing prior to publication. The scientist will also be expected to lead research on methods development and testing of methods for rapid and cost-efficient assessment of stream flow recovery with reforestation.\n\nCandidates should have strong field, analytical, and writing skills, a record of successful publication, and experience with or willingness to work on multidisciplinary teams. Training will be provided for planned analyses, with latitude for related independent research and professional development. The project provides up to three years of funding, with the third year of funding determined by performance in years 1 and 2. There are opportunities for multiple lead author publications, and ownership of future research directions. There are funds to support travel to international meetings. The location is at STRI in Panama but with potential visits to the Stroud Water Research Center outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA to work with Dr. Melinda Daniels, the co-supervisor. STRI fosters a lively, collaborative research community, with 32 Staff Scientists, a similar number of post-doctoral fellows, and over 1,200 international scientists visiting annually. Ability to communicate with a wide range of people in a multicultural environment will be considered.\n\nApplications will be evaluated as they are received. The successful applicant will begin by June 2024; however, the position will be held open for the right applicant.\n\nTo Apply: Interested candidates should submit a single PDF file including cover letter, curriculum vitae, statement of research accomplishments and interests, significant publications, and the names and contact information of three references to Jefferson Hall and Melinda Daniels at hallje@si.edu. The position is open until filled; review of applications will begin on 15 March 2024.\n\nAt STRI, we value and embrace diversity in all its forms. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment that welcomes and celebrates individuals from various backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that diversity fosters innovation, creativity, and collaboration, which are essential to our success.\n\nWe encourage individuals of all races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, ages, abilities, and backgrounds to apply for Postdoctoral Research Fellow at STRI. We provide equal opportunities and maintaining a fair and respectful recruitment process for all candidates. If you require accommodations during any phase of the application or interview process, please let us know, and we will be happy to assist.\n\nSTRI is an equal opportunity employer.
