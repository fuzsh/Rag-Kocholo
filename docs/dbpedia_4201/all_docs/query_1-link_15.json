        "text": "Freiburg defender Caglar Soyuncu insists he has no deal in place with Arsenal, but he considers the Gunners to be “one of the most important clubs in England” and is planning transfer talks.\n\nThe 22-year-old Turkey international has emerged as a top target for those in north London, with speculation regarding a move surfacing prior to Unai Emery’s arrival at Emirates Stadium.\n\nA switch continues to be mooted under new management at Arsenal, with the Premier League outfit considered to still be in need of defensive additions during the summer window.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nSoyuncu is ruling nothing out, with English football holding obvious appeal, but he will only be addressing the issue of his future once he has taken in an international outing against Russia on June 5.\n\nHe told Turkish publication Tumspor: “Arsenal are one of the most important clubs in England.\n\n“I know they’re interested in me, but there’s nothing finalised yet about my transfer.\n\n“After the national team camp we’ll have talks.”\n\nThe president of Soyuncu’s former club, Altinordu supremo Seyit Mehmet Ozkan, claimed in early May that an agreement with Arsenal had already been reached.\n\nThose comments were quickly rubbished, but the youngster’s agent did tell football.london in April that a move to the Premier League is on the cards.\n\nMustafa Dogru said: “The main objective of the player is to play in the Premier League, that I can tell you at the moment.\n\n“We are negotiating with some clubs. They [Freiburg] are open to negotiations.\n\n“He came from the second division in Turkey to Bundesliga 1 and has had a good experience the last two years.\n\n“The difference between Bundesliga 1 and the Premier League is not as big as from the Turkish second division and Bundesliga 1, so he is ready.\n\n“He is perfect for the Premier League. We are sure he is going to make a big impact in the first season.”"
