Bane NOR is a state-owned company responsible for Norway's national railway infrastructure. It plans to invest 150 billion Norwegian krone to build 270 km of new double tracks between Oslo-Lillehammer, Oslo-Halden, Oslo-Porsgrunn, and Sandvika-Hønefoss as part of the InterCity project. This will allow train speeds of up to 250 km/h and improve passenger and freight rail services while reducing pressure on the capital city of Oslo by expanding the housing and job markets across the region.",
