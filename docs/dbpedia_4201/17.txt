Beşiktaş are interested in a loan for Leicester City centre-back Çağlar Söyüncü.

It’s believed that the defender is keen to leave the Premier League in order to go back home and revive his career.

However, any deal for the 23-year-old will likely be put on hold with Maguire’s future still very much in the air.

With Filip Benkovic’s return from his Celtic loan spell, it’s hard to imagine the Turkish international will be able to crack Brendan Rodgers’ side ahead of Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans, and Wes Morgan.

After paying Freiburg £19m last summer, Söyüncü only made six Premier League appearances for the Foxes and only featured once in 2019.
