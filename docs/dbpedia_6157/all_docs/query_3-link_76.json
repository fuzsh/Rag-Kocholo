When you create a new layer out of it, it will be the first layer and I have to drag it to the right position in the layer map. When I use \"insert as new layer\", the layer will be correctly sorted in the layermap, but the insert wont be on the x/y position of the previously selected layer!\n\nI found a script that does something very similar, but it uses gimp-edit-copy & gimp-edit-paste to insert the layer, which isnt what i want. How can I change this, so it will insert the image from cache instead?"
