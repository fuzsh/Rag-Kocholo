The program's feature set and interface means that it is seen by some as a possible replacement to Adobe Photoshop.[1]\n\nFeatures[]\n\nGimp has many features such as \"color, selections and paths, align tool, move, crop, rotate, scale, shear, perspective, flip tools, layers, layer masks, channels, automation, scripts, and plug-ins\".[2]\n\nThese are popular with brickfilmers for simple 'touching up' edits to enhance the appearance of frames but also for more complex special effects such as 'masking', often used to create the illusion that minifigures can fly."
