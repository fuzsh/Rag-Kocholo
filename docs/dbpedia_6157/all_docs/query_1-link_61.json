        "text": "As Adobe's Photoshop 5.0 gears up for release later this year, another image-editing application built for the Unix platform is gaining momentum as it readies for its Net debut next week. The GNU Image Manipulation Tool - otherwise known as the GIMP - is a powerful image creation and manipulation application which is part of the growing free software movement on the Web.\n\n\"GIMP offers a real alternative to Photoshop in a free package,\" said Zach Beane, moderator of the GIMP News page and programmer at The Maine InternetWorks. \"The biggest advantage that GIMP has is that the development is open and anyone who wants a feature is free to add it.\"\n\nAnd for a homebrew application that is still in beta release, the GIMP has already built an impressive user and support base. Scott Goehring, GIMP developer and founder of WilberWorks, Inc. - a company formed to support GIMP - said that a recent version of the program was downloaded by more than 1,900 users in one week alone. Goehring estimates that there are at least 50,000 individual GIMP users.\n\n\"My desktop computer runs Linux so I don't have to kick someone off the Mac to do graphics now,\" said Beane. \"In fact, I've got people kicking me off my computer to use GIMP.\"\n\nJust about everything in the GIMP is made to work as a plug-in, including the file formats that it recognizes and the tools used to manipulate images. Plug-ins include fractal fills and \"lens flare\" filters, typical of medium-to-large image manipulation tools, and a filter to embed hidden digital signatures. The Stegano filter lets you hide text messages in an image, which are retrievable by other users who have the Stegano filter. If you know C, writing a GIMP plug-in is trivial; the GIMP Plugin Registry already holds over 150 of them.\n\nOne of the GIMP's most powerful features is its scripting extensions, which allow macros to be created to automate tasks that would normally be executed by hand. The first and most prominent extension, Script-Fu, has been extended with a Java-powered counterpart called Net-Fu, which is a Web front-end for servers running GIMP and Script-Fu. What this means is that anyone with a Java-enabled Web browser can use the GIMP over the Web to create on-the-fly, custom images without having to run a Unix-like operating system.\n\nBryan Livingston offers exactly this service, having just opened cooltext.com - a free, advertising-driven site that lets you create custom logos over the Web. You choose a typeface and an effect, enter some text, and out comes your logo.\n\nManish Singh, current head of GIMP development, said that the GIMP was originally written in 1995 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, then students at the University of California at Berkeley who began the project as an independent study for class credit. Their early releases, though unpolished beta versions, started turning heads.\n\nThe program was becoming a showcase of the free software movement, but development went in limbo last May when Kimball and Mattis both graduated - the project could not support them financially, and they were forced to abandon it upon getting day jobs. Development froze until a new core of developers took over. Now, Singh and the GIMP development team are preparing to release GIMP 1.0, which they say should happen next week.\n\nBut its multitasking capabilities, constant stream of new plug-ins and versatility aside, this free program won't be a Photoshop killer just yet.\n\nIts fatal flaw is how it handles color - the GIMP developers don't have access to the proprietary color-matching information that is a must for professional pre-press work. So unlike Photoshop, which was designed for film and print output in mind, GIMP's usefulness is mostly regulated to photo editing and Web work.\n\n\"Improving the Gimp for pre-press work is something many of the current developers are very interested in, as a goal,\" said GIMP developer Larry Ewing. \"Our ability to work on this is hampered by the fact that there are several patents covering the area, and few (if any) of us have the proper hardware to test our work. Despite the obstacles it is safe to assume that there will a continuing improvement in this area.\"\n\nHere’s What the Inside of an Airbus Factory Looks Like\n\nIn Hamburg, aviation giant Airbus is transforming aircraft production with state-of-the-art robotics technology on its planes. We go on a behind-the-scenes visit for the delivery of an A321neo.\n\nThe Green Economy Is Hungry for Copper—and People Are Stealing, Fighting, and Dying to Feed It\n\nWith the possible exception of gold, no other metal has caused as much destruction as copper. In the coming years, we’ll need more of it than ever.\n\nPromising Mpox Drug Fails in Trials as Virus Spreads\n\nIn a trial in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the drug tecovirimat, also known as TPOXX, was found to be no better than placebo at clearing mpox lesions.\n\nStruggling to Unlock Your Phone? You Might Have Lost Your Fingerprints\n\nThe absence of these identifying marks—which can be the result of excessive typing, manual work, chemotherapy, or sports—is becoming more of an issue in the age of biometrics.\n\nThe Cure for Disposable Plastic Crap Is Here—and It’s Loony\n\nStretchy seaweed, reverse vending machines, QR-coded take-out boxes: They’re how we can break society’s absurd addiction to single-use plastics.\n\nWill the ‘Car-Free’ Los Angeles Olympics Work?\n\nOrganizers of the 2028 Summer Games will attempt to re-create the city’s public transport heyday of the early 20th century, but ousting the car—even for just a few weeks—will be costly.\n\nSo You’re Underwater: Why Do You See That Circle of Light Above You?\n\nSnell’s window is one of the coolest phenomena in the natural world. You’ve seen it, but do you know what causes it?\n\nShe’s the New Face of Climate Activism—and She’s Carrying a Pickax\n\nSabotage. Property destruction. For Léna Lazare and her cohort, radicalized by years of inaction on the environmental crisis, these aren’t dirty words. They’re acts of joy."
