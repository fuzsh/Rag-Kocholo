However, looking at what a bunch of \"average users\" use their computers / imaging stuff for, I think there is a lot of room for plugins / scripts to automate tasks usually provided in a fast, convenient way by most (Windows-based) desktop imaging applications, most nostable red-eye removal, color enhancement, ... .

(sorry for hijacking the thread)\n\nIt's not really that off-topic.\n\nThere are plugins and there are scripts, plugins are like a little mini program to add functionality that does not already exist in GIMP, like Davids Batch Processor or the Focus Blur plugin.\n\nScripts are more like macros and use the functionality already built in to GIMP (or provided with another script) to do the effect you want.\n\nTo do the install all you need to do is copy it to the appropriate sub-directory and when GIMP next starts it will see the new plug-in/script and it will be available to use.\n\nThere are two locations you can put these add ons, in the user location making it available to just that user or in the global directory. For the locations to place the plugins have a look at the Focus Blur link above. To see where to put the scripts check the instructions for the Split tone tutorial.\n\nages ago\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\nManWithCamera wrote:\n\nWould like to see a script to stack a directory of images (not RAW) to make a composite equal to one long exposure (for star trails)\n\nSee this link for the PhotoShop action.\n\nI will have a look and see if I can just specify a directory and open multiple files.

If so how do you make them. I use photoshop actions all the time and lack of actions is one reason I don't use gimp much. If I could easily do actions and batch processing like in photoshop I would love to use gimp more.\n\nages ago\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\nYes scripts are like Photoshop actions in that it replays a series of steps to automate the manipulation.\n\nThe difference is that you cannot \"record\" what you are doing to play it back later. It is a programming language \"scheme\" and for new begineers, it sucks. Scheme uses a syntax that takes quite a bit of getting used to, (action first second) so 3 + 4 is written (+ 3 4)\n\nThe advantage is that it is much much more powerful and flexible. I don't have an experience with Photoshop actions but one GIMP script can call another script. You can have conditional statements, you can read image paramaters and base your calculations on that figure.\n\nages ago\n\nKansas Image Maker says:\n\nDoes anyone have prewritten scripts for common batch operations such as creating proof sheets? Can you do batch operations like in photoshop where an action or set of actions are performed on a group for files automatically?\n\nages ago\n\nmavoro says:\n\nA HDR plugin would be nice.\n\nages ago\n\npaulwb says:\n\nI'm sure this would be very easy, but I didn't look at Gimp scripting yet so I have no idea about it. What about a plugin which works like the Decor -> Add border script but does add border around the selected layer instead around the whole image?\n\nAnd, another border idea: A script which creates a border like this:\n\nFor the second idea there are two possibilities:\n\n1.) Like I did it with this photo, the main image is cropped part of the original image.\n\n2.) The main image is a resized version of the original image and embedded like the cropped version in the shown photo.\n\nages ago\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\n@paulwb If you can write out the steps you take to do that I could probably write a script for it.\n\nages ago\n\nP D S says:\n\nMavoro, there is a great tutorial at www.gimpguru.org/Tutorials/BlendingExposures/\n\nOf course there is also a script that does the job. It can be found in the gimp plug-in registry at registry.gimp.org/plugin?id=4436.\n\nages ago\n\nshadowglas says:\n\nIs there a way of making a script that uses exiv2 for visualizing/editing exif data?\n\nages ago\n\nprokoudine says:\n\nshadowglas, do you mean a GIMP script that uses exiv2? I doubt it is possible.\n\nages ago\n\nWigwam Jones says:\n\nHealing Brush clone?\n\nages ago\n\nJean-François Paris says:\n\nWigwam:\n\nbad news: it is quite out of scope for a script\n\ngood news: bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109801 it is already in gimp 2.3.14\n\nages ago\n\npaulwb says:\n\ntuxcomputers: of course. My steps:\n\n1) crop the image (or scale it down)\n\n2) a thin white border\n\n3) a thin black border\n\n(would be great to be able to adjust the colour and the thikness)\n\n3) resize canvas to original size, insert original photo as layer behind the other ones and darken it reducing brightness.\n\nBut for me it would be much more interesting to be able to create borders around layers. Steps:\n\n1) go to the layer\n\n2) layer -> layer to boundary size, make it $x pixel bigger and centered.\n\n3) select the transparent area of with the magic wand.\n\n4) fill the selection with colour $y.\n\nWell, step 3 and 4 will only work if you have a layer without transparent areas. To make it correct, I would have to get the selection by selecting all the layer and substract the centered rectangular which is $x pixel smaller.\n\nIs this difficult with to implement?\n\nages ago\n\nmavoro says:\n\nThx, P D S. Very useful\n\nages ago\n\ntowsonu2003 says:\n\nis it possible to do this one: gimparoo.blogspot.com/2007/02/basic-photo-retouching.html\n\nages ago\n\nNathan deGargoyle says:\n\n@towsonu Not according to his blog but you could always ask him yourself, he's on Flickr as ~Scott~\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nNathan deGargoyle edited this topic ages ago.\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\nWell the first part of setting each channel to 12 and 245 can be easily scripted, I will have a look at that.\n\nages ago\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\n@paulwb I missed your response and will have a look at that too. I will have a dialog box that asks for the transparent border size, colour border size and colours.\n\nI noticed that when you resized on that photo you did it as a ratio, I don't think I will do that, the transparent border will be the same size on hozrizontal as well as vertical.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\ntuxcomputers edited this topic ages ago.\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\nOk new script is available here\n\nThese are the steps it does:\n\n1.

Great. :-)\n\nages ago\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\nYou know I did this script twice, once using one method, then I realised a much easier/shorter way of doing it, deleted the first one and re-wrote it from the ground up.\n\nHave you tried the script? It allows you to set:\n\n1. The outer edge size\n\n2. The amount of brightness reduction on the outer edge\n\n3. The outer border colour and size\n\n4. The inner border colour and size\n\nOne thing I am not happy with is the last step of the script resets the foreground colour and background colour to Black and White. I plan on reading what the current colours are and resetting them to those when the script is finished.\n\nages ago\n\nJean-Pierre Bucciol says:\n\nTo save your time finding the procedures to call, you can read and restore the foreground and background colors with:\n\n(set! MyForeground (car (gimp-context-get-foreground)))\n\n(set! MyBackground (car (gimp-context-get-background)))\n\nat the beginning, and\n\n(gimp-context-set-foreground MyForeground)\n\n(gimp-context-set-background MyBackground)\n\nat the end.\n\nages ago\n\ntuxcomputers says:\n\nOh cool, thanks for the code.

The shrinking took a while to process so I have changed it to selecting a rectangle, it starts at the border corner and is as big as the image minus the border top, bottom and sides.\n\nIt speeds up the script quite considerably for the same results.\n\nAs for the problem in the 2.3 version I have heard they are changing from Script-Fu to Tiny-Fu and most scripts will need a little tweaking.

Your installation of GIMP, or\n\n2. Your settings.\n\nThat only leaves one thing in the chain and that is the brushes you downloaded. Sorry but I would try deleting them, downloading and installing them again. If it still doesn't work please let me know where I can get them. I will try them myself and let you know if it works for me.\n\nages ago\n\nchimphappyhour says:\n\nHow about this translated into a gimp script. It's the steps from an action for PS that makes images look like something made by a guy by the name of Dave Hill (he has a web page, I just don't have the address handy). Anyway, here are the steps that were provided to me from the PS action:\n\n>I got much of the technical content for this action from a posting by Omar Casasola on flickr. I added the history palette step and the fade command to replace his use of selection because I thought my approach was more elegant and suitable for a PS Action. If you open the Action in the Action Palette so you can see the various steps in it and you can tick the boxes to make it ask for a user intervention on a lot of the steps below, so you could tweak the settings more or experiment\n\nThe steps in the action are:\n\n1) Duplicate the layer on the LAYER pallette?Go to FILTER - OTHER - HIGH PASS type 4.0 for RADIUS?on the LAYERS pallette choose vivid light for the blending mode?Now flatten the image.\n\n2) Duplicate the layer on the LAYER pallette?Go to FILTER - OTHER - HIGH PASS type 6.9 for RADIUS?on the LAYERS pallette choose color for the blending mode?Set opacity to 40%?Now flatten the image.\n\n3) DUPLICATE LAYER on layer pallette?FILTER - BLUR - GAUSSIAN BLUR 9.4 pixels?FILTER - NOISE - ADD NOISE 3%\n\nThis is the point in the History palette that I select at the end of the action - its the last step before sharpening so if you want to tone down the sharpening around features like eyes etc then painting this history point with the history brush will achieve that.\n\n4) Unsharp Mask?AMOUNT 100%?RADIUS 30.0 pixels?THRESHOLD 0\n\n5) fade Unsharp Mask\n\nI tick this to make it a user defined step in the action so you can increase or lower the effect to suit.\n\n6) Select History Brush and select the history step in 3) above\n\nages ago\n\nAte My Crayons says:\n\nI like lots of layers to play with. If you have a lot of layers, it takes so long to check/uncheck each individual layer at a time. If I have a animation with 50 layers or more it can be ..., well.. just not fun.

Often I need to apply the same curve to a batch of pictures and would love to be able to automate the process.\n\nCurrently, I adjust the first one, save the curve (or levels) to a file, then open the next picture, open the curve dialog, open the saved curve, hit OK, save the file, close it and repeat.\n\nI imagine that this would be a gimp script that is run only on the command line, but if there's a way to do this to a bunch of pictures at once in the GUI, that'd be great too.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael Moore\n\nages ago\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\n@stuporglue\n\nMaybe you can use Gap.\n\nIf you open all images as layer you can use the level or curve tool with \"filter all Layer\"\n\nOr if are in the same folder you can try FilterMacro\n\n(not so sure of last, but filter all layer will work, then you can export again the images with \"split image in frames\" also in Gap)\n\nages ago\n\nfearful summer [deleted] says:\n\nThanks fotocomics, I'll try those solutions.\n\nI'm not sure how many I can open in layers (these are 8MP pictures, and I only have a gig of RAM), but it should help.\n\nThey are typically all in the same folder -- I'll look into the FilterMacro and see if that will do the job.\n\nages ago\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nstuporglue\n\nHem not so sure about Filter Macro,(i don't use often) but if you can open as layer Filter all layer should solve\n\nages ago\n\npaulwb says:\n\nHi,\n\nI updated the framing gimp script of tuxcomputers published some time ago ( www.flickr.com/groups/gimpusers/discuss/72157594521838760... ) to Gimp 2.4.

Would you like it to be installed in a specific menu location? Additionally, I've got to figure out a name for this script. If you'll notice in the above script, it's also named contrast mask (script-fu-contrast-mask). If I refer to yours by the same name AND you have both scripts installed on your system, GIMP will have problems and may not run either. So, would you like me to call it something else or leave it as 'script-fu-contrast-mask'? If I leave it as such, you'll need to take out your other script to avoid conflicts. By the way, you can't just rename the script, the script itself has to be changed.\n\nLet me know.\n\nArt\n\nages ago\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nwow that was quick\n\nActually i would like in my Filters/ Photo menu.\n\n(there is a blank space before\" Photo\", if not it get mixed with some tons of PS plugins, that blank space raise it on top of all not-default menus)\n\nabout the name.something as Photocomix-ContrastMask should avoid any conflict ....and fully satisfy my narcissism\n\nthank a lot a Fencepost!!\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nBTW could you explain better the last point?\n\nyou can't just rename the script, the script itself has to be changed.\n\nwhat you mean for name,\n\nthe name of the scm file,\n\nthe name in the gimp menu,\n\nor the name as seen from the plugin browser ?\n\nall those 3 names should be changed to avoid conflict?\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nfencepost says:\n\nNo problem. I'll do my best about that specific placement, but I can't guarantee it will work. But, we'll see! ;)\n\n(I just did a quick check and don't see a \"Photo\" menu under my Filters Menu. Is that a default? OR are you just wanting me to add a \"Photo\" menu under Filters?)\n\nAs far as the naming issue I brought up, here's what I mean. In the example here, we're discussing contrast masks. In the define section of the above script you posted, there are two references in that script that look like this: 'script-fu-contrast-mask' One is at the top under the \"define\" block, the other at the bottom under the \"register\" block. If I (or anyone for that matter) were to create a script using that same reference (script-fu-contrast-mask) in the define/register sections and I had another script in my scripts folder that jad the same information in the define/register blocks, GIMP would not act right. Not sure if GIMP would pick one over the other or if neither would work, but there would be a conflict. So, even if you changed the \"file name\" (ie.....contrast-mask.scm for one and Photocomix-ContrastMask.scm for the other), there would be a conflict because GIMP is trying to register to script-fu's with the same \"define/register\" information. So, I'll just add your name into the define/register blocks and all will be good! ;)\n\nDon't know if that makes complete sense, and since I'm still pretty new to scripting I can't explain it properly, but that, in essence, is what will happen.\n\nArt\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nfencepost edited this topic ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nthank for clearing\n\n/Filters/ Photo/.. is a menu that i created to have all the photography-related scripts in a single place...quite handy\n\nblank space before Photo is needed to raise up the menu, just under the standard \"filter\" menu but above the mess of PS filters\n\nGimp Menu are in alphabetic order but\n\nIn this kind of alphabetic order blank spaces and numbers come before letters,\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nt i don't know how write scripts,i may only rewrite the menu path but i found so cool and elegant that \"blank space\" trick..\n\nI used a lot to rearrange all my custom scripts placement\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nfencepost says:\n\nI deleted the script because flickr removed an important function from the script rendering it unusable in GIMP without further modification.

I copied and pasted my script into Notepad and I couldn't get GIMP to recognize it. It took me forever to realize that the board is removing the *Image* tag from the scripts. That's something that needs to be in the script because it tells GIMP where to place it. Not really sure why the board is doing this, but it's not there and if someone tries to copy/paste these scripts, they won't work correctly.\n\nMaybe it's not a good idea to post scripts here (or if someone knows a workaround, that would be greatly appreciated)\n\nArt\n\nages ago\n\nedward_marshall says:\n\nYou might consider setting up a SourceForge or Google Code project for this stuff, then just providing a link to that.

Here's my take: I consider the single downloads of multiple scripts to be like a grab bag. You know you're probably gonna get some goodies when you look inside the bag, but you don't really know until you get in there and start sorting things out, which can take some time. Plus, there might not be any assistance if something doesn't work quite right. Even if the scm file contains a URL/email address where the author can be reached, some folks just don't know that.\n\nBut, if I post a download to my dA site, a prospective user can go there, see a preview of the script's output, get a good description of how/what it does and can send me a message if they need help.\n\nI certainly have no problem any of my scripts being included in the big download, and I'll definitely support that effort. But, I'm very big on personalized service and assisting those who run into snags. I've had a number of tutorials posted on forums around that web that won't/don't/can't offer assistance when users have questions. I feel that's unfair to those needing help. Since I can't be in all places at all times, I like having a central location where users can talk with me directly.\n\nBut, as I said, I will gladly allow any of my scripts that are deemed worthy of inclusion into the big download pack. However, I still want folks to be able to view them in my \"backyard.\"\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nfencepost edited this topic ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nSorry Fencepost there was a complete misunderstanding also for my fault\n\nTo make more clear i edit my previous message\n\nI was explaining that if is easy grab the whole \"Fx-foundry\"\n\npack, from the that sourceforge project page is easy grab a pack but ,from there seems hard download single script\n\npersonally i prefer when possible refer to the author pages, as your on DA, but a cental repository for script updated to 2.4 was badly needed, since the condition of the official plugin registry seems hopeless,\n\n\"Difficult to download single script\" was not a reference to your pages or other author pages, that on the contrary is exactly a kind of user's friendly download of single file (with the beautiful opportunity to contact the script author) that i love\n\nthat is something that only the authors may offer, and not Sourceforge project (for that i quoted the SVN,...luckily DA offer more intutive way to download then \"browse SVN\")\n\nSorry if i was unclear,\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX says:\n\nAnyway about your last script a before after example with default setting\n\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nOOPSS\n\nimage is just a cropped piece of a cool photo\n\nthat little crop don't evidence the quality of the original, but was handy to show the ouput of the script\n\nfor the original click this thumb\n\n\"The Ancient Parish of St Nicholas, Kenilworth\" by Taylor Dundee [?]\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nPhotoComiX (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago."
