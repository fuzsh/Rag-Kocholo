        "text": "Template:Dablink Template:Infobox Software2\n\nThe GNU Image Manipulation Program or just GIMP is a Free Software bitmap graphics editor, a program for creating and processing raster graphics. It also has some support for vector graphics. The project was started in 1995 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis and is now maintained by a group of volunteers; it is licensed under the GNU General Public License.\n\nOverview[]\n\nGIMP originally stood for General Image Manipulation Program. Its creators, Spencer Kimball and Petter Mattis, initially started GIMP as a semester-long project for a class at UC Berkeley. Both were integral members of eXperimental Computing Facility, a student club at Berkeley (the GIMP's file extension, XCF, is taken from the initials of this club). In 1997, after both Kimball and Mattis had graduated from Berkeley, the name was changed to GNU Image Manipulation Program when it became an official GNU project.\n\nGIMP can be used to process digital graphics and photographs. Typical uses include creating graphics and logos, resizing and cropping photos, changing colors, combining images using a layer paradigm, removing unwanted image features, and converting between different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create simple animated images.\n\nGIMP is also notable to some as the first major free software end-user application. Previous free software projects, such as GCC and the Linux kernel, were mainly tools created by programmers for programmers. GIMP is considered by some to be proof that the free software development process can create things non-geeks can use productively, and as such psychologically paved the way for such efforts as KDE, GNOME, Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice.org, and various other applications that followed.\n\nFeatures[]\n\n[]\n\n48 standard brushes, plus facilities to create new ones\n\nBrushes can be used in hard-edged, soft-edged, or eraser modes, be applied at different opacities, or used to apply various effects\n\nPalette with RGB, HSV, colour wheel, CMYK, and mixing modes, plus tools to pick colours from the image with various averaging options. Support for hexadecimal colour codes (as used in HTML).\n\n[]\n\nSelection of rectangles, circles, similar colors, or freehand selection\n\nSmart Selection tool, known as the \"Magic Wand\", used to select contiguous regions\n\nLayers, transparency[]\n\nSupport for layers, including transparent layers, which can be shown, hidden, or made semitransparent\n\nTransparent and semitransparent images\n\nChannels available to add different types of opacity and color effects to images\n\nPaths[]\n\nSupport for paths containing line segments or bezier curves. Paths can be named, saved, and painted with brushes, patterns, or various line styles\n\nEffects, scripts, and filters[]\n\nApproximately 150 standard effects and filters\n\nScripting[]\n\nAs well as interactive use, GIMP can be automated with macro programs. The built-in Scheme can be used for this, or alternatively Perl, Python, Tcl and (experimentally) Ruby can also be used. This allows the writing of scripts and plugins for GIMP which can then be used interactively; it is also possible to produce images in completely non-interactive ways (for example generating images for a webpage on the fly using CGI scripts) and for batch color correction and conversion of images. For simple automatable tasks, a package such as ImageMagick is likely to be quicker, but GIMP has much more powerful features.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nGIMP was intended as a free software replacement for Adobe Photoshop, which is the dominant bitmap editor in the printing and graphics industries.\n\nGIMP uses GTK+ as for building its user interface. GTK+ was initially part of GIMP, intended as a replacement for the proprietary Motif toolkit, which GIMP originally depended upon. GIMP and GTK+ were originally designed for the X Window System running on Unix-like operating systems, but have since been ported to Microsoft Windows, OS/2, and SkyOS.\n\nThe current stable version of GIMP is Template:Latest stable release/GIMP. Major changes compared to version 1.2 include a more polished user interface and further separation of the user interface and back-end.\n\nAlso, an unstable 2.3.x version is being updated by GIMP developers, with new versions being available every few months.\n\nFor the future it is planned to base GIMP on a more generic graphical library called GEGL, thereby addressing some fundamental design limitations that prevent many enhancements such as native CMYK support. However, implementation of this plan has been continually put off since 2000.\n\nComparisons with other graphics editors[]\n\nMissing features, which many graphics artists require, include:\n\nSupport for the Pantone color matching system, or spot color. (This can be circumvented by importing Pantone palettes supplied by printer manufacturers, which has lower usage restrictions than Pantone Inc. has suggested.)\n\nSupport for Adobe Photoshop plugins and other add-onsTemplate:Ref.\n\nSupport for anything but 8-bit per-channel images e.g 16-bit, 32-bit, floating point.\n\nSupport for colour models other than RGB(A) and greyscale e.g CIE XYZ. (Partial CMYK support is available with the Separate plug-in.)\n\nExtensive gamma support.\n\nSupport for Color management (GIMP has limited support through LCMSTemplate:Ref)\n\nNative support for Adjustment layers, i.e. layers which act like filters. (A plugin is available which adds some support for these.)\n\nUndo history \"snapshots\" that persist between sessions.\n\nBenefits of GIMP system include:\n\nZero licensing costs, even for installations on many computers\n\nAvailable for many types of computing system\n\nNot dependent on any single company for updates or support\n\nFreely redistributable, so can be shared on an intranet or given to friends and family\n\nPlug-in development is not limited by developers (Access to Adobe Photoshop's SDK requires authorization [1])\n\nFile Types[]\n\nGIMP can open and save the following file formats:\n\nGIMP XCF, the native format (.xcf, or compressed as .xcf.gz or .xcf.bz2)\n\nAutodesk flic animations (.fli)\n\nDICOM (.dcm or .dicom)\n\nPostScript documents (.ps, .ps.gz and .eps)\n\nFITS astronomical images (.fits, or .fit)\n\nScalable vector graphics for exporting paths (.svg)\n\nMicrosoft Windows icon (.ico)\n\nMicrosoft Uncompressed AVI Video video (.avi)\n\nWindows bitmap (.bmp)\n\nPaintshop Pro image (.psp or .tub)\n\nAdobe PhotoShop Documents (.psd, .pdd)\n\nPNM image (.pnm, .ppm, .pgm, and .pbm)\n\nCompuserve Graphics Interchange Format images and animations (.gif)\n\nJoint Photographic Experts Group Images (.jpeg, .jpg, or .jpe)\n\nPortable Network Graphics (.png)\n\nTagged Image File Format (.tiff or .tif)\n\nTARGA (.tga)\n\nX bitmap image (.xbm, .icon, or .bitmap)\n\nX pixmap image (.xpm)\n\nX window dump (.xwd)\n\nZsoft PCX (.pcx)\n\nGIMP can open but not save the following formats:\n\nAdobe Portable Document Format files (.pdf)\n\nRaw image formats (many extensions)\n\nGIMP can also save to the following formats which it cannot open:\n\nHTML as a table with coloured cells (.html)\n\nC source files as an array (.c or .h)\n\nMultiple Network Graphic layered image files (.mng)\n\nASCII Art or HTML, with characters and punctuation making up images\n\nAvailability, versions, and forks[]\n\nLinux distributions[]\n\nGIMP is included as the standard image editor on most consumer Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Mandriva, and SUSE.\n\nGIMP for Windows[]\n\nGIMP (along with the GTK+ toolkit) has been ported to the Microsoft Windows platform by Finnish programmer Tor \"tml\" LillqvistTemplate:Ref who started that project in 1997.\n\nCurrently, the Windows port is practically identical to the original version in terms of features and stability. The installation has been tremendously eased with the introduction of the binary installersTemplate:Refcompiled by Jernej SimoncicTemplate:Ref\n\nThe number of windows used by GIMP's interface can cause desktop clutter, which is especially apparent on systems like Microsoft Windows which are not equipped to deal with it. This is because the GIMP uses a Single document interface (SDI, more specifically a Controlled SDI as the toolbox is the main control window), unlike many competing graphics programs, which use a Multiple document interface.\n\nPortable GIMP[]\n\nPortableGIMP is a re-packaged version of GIMP for Windows, which can be run directly from media without installation. It is intended to be carried on a USB flash drive, or similar portable storage device e.g USB hard drive or digital audio player. It does not require administrator privileges and thus can be used in restricted (e.g work) environments without troubling a network administrator.\n\nGimp.app for Mac OS X[]\n\nGimp.app provides a self contained application bundle of GIMP for OS X. Gimp.app requires Apple's X11.app. Gimp.app is packaged by Aaron Voisine.\n\nSeashore for Mac OS X[]\n\nSeashore is a program based on GIMP for Mac that uses the native Cocoa interface in OS X. The program is currently still in beta (0.1.8).\n\nGIMPshop[]\n\nGIMPshop is a modification to GIMP, rearranging its user interface to mimic that of Adobe Photoshop\n\nCinePaint[]\n\nCinePaint formerly known as Film Gimp, is a modification (forked from v. 1.0.4), adding 16-bit color depth and other improvements and is used within the film industry.\n\nSee also[]\n\nTemplate:Portalpar\n\nGIMPshop\n\nWilber\n\nColor management\n\nComparison of bitmap graphics editors\n\n[]\n\nOfficial[]\n\nGIMP website\n\nGIMP Plug-In Registry\n\nGIMP Developer Resources\n\nGIMP meets OpenUsability\n\nGimp and OpenOffice Draw.\n\nThird-parties[]\n\nGIMP for Windows\n\nalt.pg.
