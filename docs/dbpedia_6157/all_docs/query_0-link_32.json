        "text": "Like Photoshop, but without the price tag? Sign us up.\n\nGIMP, or GNU Image Manipulation Program, is a free open-source program for all your graphic editing tasks, including photo retouching, image composition, and image authoring. Transform your creative idea into reality with GIMP’s platform, formed for creators, by creators. From graphic designers to data scientists, GIMP supports all varieties of design professionals. The software also integrates with third parties like Inkscape for a fully customized experience.\n\nGIMP has a rich history, going back to the mid 90s. GIMP started as a student project by two students, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, at the University of California, Berkeley in 1995. The first public release (0.54) was in January 1996 and included drawing and channel tools, and an undo button, which was unheard of at the time (we can’t imagine life without one now.) After Kimball and Mattis graduated in 1997, the code for GIMP was taken over by the dev community. GIMP has been a community project ever since, led by a variety of developers from all over the world.\n\n“GIMP is not just free software. It’s what I call community free software,” says Jehan Pagès, one of GIMP’s maintainers. “It is made by volunteers, for everyone, and can be compared to a friendly neighbourhood association doing something useful for the community, except that instead of being very local, we are pretty much international.”\n\nThe team at GIMP embraces their open-source nature and emphasis on community, creating a platform that is not meant to mimic other software, but to be its own unique project.\n\n“We are not here for the competition, just for doing something as nice as we can, and we like interacting with other projects,” says Pagès. “People who just want GIMP to be yet another ‘clone’ of this or that other software just don't get what GIMP is trying to accomplish. We are not here to copy others, just do things how we think they should be done.”\n\nOn the technical side, GIMP has made several leaps over the course of its history.\n\n“GIMP is the source of GTK, meaning \"GIMP ToolKit\" originally, which took its independence as a GUI toolkit and is now massively used by uncountable number of software (open-source or not),” says Pagès. “In other huge free software, this is used by GNOME or XFCE desktop environments, Inkscape, and more.\"\n\n“Our pixel manipulation engine is named GEGL and is also an extraordinary piece of software to process images through effect graphs, as well as our library for pixel encoding and color space conversion: babl.”"
