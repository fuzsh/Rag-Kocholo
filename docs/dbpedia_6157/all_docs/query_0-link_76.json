GIMP is named for the character in the Tarantino movie Pulp Fiction, played by Stephen Hibbert:\n\nhttps://www.themoviedb.org/movie/680-pulp-fiction/cast\n\nI can't see how a logo that looked vaguely like this would offend disabled people:\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/53280571@N07/5654527423\n\nI'd glad the entitled knockers who insist on misinterpreting the name have finally stopped bullying the GIMP devs and created a fork. I would have called it PIMPLE (PIMPLE Image Manipulation Program for Liberal Editors), but Glimpse is a good hack, as it contains the original name within it. G-l-IMP-se\n\nAs Zygote says,people don't choose GIMP because of missing features, not eccentric UI, so I don't think changing the UI would make GIMP any more attractive. From memory, there was fork called PhotoGIMP that tried to give the GIMP back-end a more Photoshop-a-like UI. It seems to have sunk without a trace. A quick web search turned up no sign of it, but I did find this, which I found quite amusing:\n\nhttps://www.gimpshop.com/\n\nI remember there being another fork called Cinepaint, which was optimized for use in the movie industry. It also seems to be long abandoned:\n\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/cinepaint/files/\n\nPlease let me write about a bit of the usability of GIMP here.\n\n- Cannot move the icons on the toolbox easily, or can you? Why cannot drug and drop?? I have to go to the setting tab each time, besides, please try the setting, can you set that easily as your preference even in the setting tab? I cannot. I have to do kind of the caluculations where an icon will be mapped on the toolbox. I think this is the worst usability of GIMP.\n\n- The small up and down buttons of the % indicator on the scroll bar does not allow up and down by keeping a press of them. (only 50%, 100%, 200%...) Please consider the speed if someone intends to fix the usability.\n\n- Sometimes when changing the size of the brush, or the pencil, etc, the tooloption suddenly disappears once and shows again on another place. (mistery, I cannot figure out why/how it happens)\n\n- The same tooloption matter, sometimes suddenly the percentage raises to around 1000% or 2000%, mystery. I cannot figure out how it happens. (and who needs such a function)\n\n- Same tooloption issue, the up and down buttons are too close to the return default button. (I wonder who needs such return button, I'm afraid. If it can be set as my preferable number, it would be usable though. I don't want to add add-ons)\n\n- The color palette cannot be showed easily. (W>D>R... it is the function which is used most often)\n\n- The area of the corners which control the window size are too small. There should be a button on the menu bar which controls the size by click and drag. (I think it can be said to all of \"Windows\", e.g. the window of a browser. But GIMP's one is especially small)\n\n- Some settings are not saved. Have to set each time. (e.g. V>T) On the contrary, somehow some unwanted settings are saved. (In my case, it was grid)\n\n- Cannot draw on certain areas often happens. Needs to close the file once. Or dragging the file window to another place. When it happens, it seems that the area where it cannot be drawn is the same. I cannot explain in language well. Please see the illustration.\n\n- I was thinking I would be able to modify the usability of this application easily, freely. There does not seem to be much difference between of iOS.\n\n- I prefer the color number fffff when it is on blue or green rather than on red. Smells iOS's elitism (fffff should be always on there). I think it is better not to force your preference (fffff should be always on there). It is a typical acitivty to try to rob users freedom.\n\n- Pluma is very frequently freezing (for a 1-2 seconds) (chrome(?) was freezing on Icedove so maybe it was the cause...).\n\n- maybe more, because I use only very basic functions. I am not sure how they can be proud of this usability. I think it is basically good but at least there are only people who criticize bad parts and praise rarely, as if those good parts are something normal, around me.\n\nEDIT: sorry, it seems that the middle button made a copy of the writing..."
