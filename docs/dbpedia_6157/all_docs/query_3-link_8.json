I also dont want to post it randomly on a seemingly unrelated forum. I know they say its an “official forum” but there are 2 of those so its very confusing how to get in touch with them.\n\nHey @MichaelTunnell welcome to the forums. I remember you from way back when you were more involved with Jupiter Broadcasting.\n\nIt seems, at least as far as the team is concerned, its a settled matter: GIMP - Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThough we are always open to hearing new ideas. @Jehan is also here, he is one of the main maintainers.\n\nThanks for the welcome. Whoa! That was a while ago and remembering me from that is impressive since 90% of the time I was there I didnt go by my name. lol You should check out my current stuff at thisweekinlinux.com and destinationlinux.net . . . to be clear I was not here to promote but since you knew about that stuff it seems only natural I let you know about this stuff.\n\nI am aware of this answered FAQ and while I understand there is very little chance for a discussion on this topic to change the minds of the dev team. I feel it would be irresponsible for me to not attempt to have the discussion with the current team. I have been following this project since it started and I have discussed this with multiple iterations of the team but it has been a very long time and I don’t think any of the current members were involved at the time of the last discussion so I wanted to do my due diligence on the subject.\n\nlol cheeky\n\nI am curious now. ok people got problems with the gimp name. IIRC there is now even a fork to clean up that name thing. but that aside… we have krita and others as opensource alternatives as well.\n\nso i dont get why people push for the name change there is no lack of alternatives.\n\nThe best place to discuss this is the GIMP IRC chat channel.\n\nBut be aware that the team knows all the problems with the name and decided not to change it.\n\nCome on, you’ve been in the open source community long enough to know that the name GIMP can be problematic in some parts of the world.\n\nPlease do not change its name: I am far too used to it. Personally, over 20 years of keeping it in mind\n\nFor me, It is like GRASS (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) a GIS software also quite veteran [1].\n\nBack in the day, it was quite commun to adopt these names (acronyms).\n\nJoking aside, I do remember the fork. Their developers where extremely rude towards some of the GIMP folks. As a result, they caused a lot of pain. In the end, producing zero results. They even started proposing to port part of the code from C to Rust (quite an\"easy\" task indeed to start with: being ironic here, sorry…)\n\n[1] https://grass.osgeo.org/\n\nI have setup an IRC client for this.\n\nOr it clearly shows that one person working on a project is not sustainable especially when considering all of the mountains of hate comment they received and the occasional death threat didnt help.\n\nThat is a very early definition but other definitions are just as old but more importantly the app was specifically named what it was to reference something offensive. It was not an accident."
