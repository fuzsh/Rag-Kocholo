        "text": "Nowadays, graphic designers can choose from a wide range of design tools, with each offering attractive benefits like versatility and budget-friendly pricing plans. Weâve compiled a list of 20 excellent graphic design software options to help you choose the one that best suits your needs.Â\n\n20 graphic design software tools & apps to try\n\nThe following list compares the top graphic design apps and tools, considering features, compatibility, and the pros and cons of each.\n\n1. Adobe Illustrator\n\nâAdobe Illustrator wrote the book on vector-based graphics software, and it still sets the standard for professionally designed portfolio artwork, infographics, and icons. Illustrator is constantly developing new features for users. Its 2023-released Generative Recolor tool, for example, lets customers use the power of AI to explore limitless color palettes and themes.\n\nHowever, Adobe might not be the best fit for professional designers or solopreneurs on a budget. The monthly plan is $37.99, with no discount for annual prepayment.\n\nKey features:\n\nImage trace: Auto-detect a specific kind of art, remove image coloring, and reduce anchor points for simpler tracing.\n\nRetype: Identify unknown fonts from artwork and use them instantly in your design.\n\nArtwork export: Export your graphic design as a WebP image for website and app usage.\n\nHand lettering: Digitize freehand fonts.\n\nRetain PDF hyperlinks: Export your graphic design as a PDF without having to remove links.\n\nPros:\n\nIntegration with other editing tools in the Adobe family.\n\nStart from scratch or choose a template.\n\nWide range of vector design tools.\n\nVersatility in graphic design creations.\n\nSupports multiple file formats.\n\nCons:\n\nResource-heavy.\n\nExpensive subscription plans.\n\nSteep learning curve.\n\nComplex file management.\n\nLimited photo-editing capabilities.\n\nPlatforms: Windows, Mac, iPad, Android\n\n2. Affinity Designer\n\nâAffinity Designer is an excellent choice for personal projects or novice graphic designers due to its beginner-friendly UI. Itâs a worthy competitor of Adobe Illustrator, with a similar suite of design tools and user-friendly features like custom keyboard shortcuts that save time and effort.Â\n\nThis is also a good fit for designers who want a budget-friendly tool that doesnât sacrifice functionality, since it offers a 30-day free trial. After the free trial, customers must pay a single fee to continue using the platform: $69.99 for Mac OS and Windows and $18.49 for iPad.\n\nOne important note: Affinity has been acquired by Canva. While the company promises to maintain the quality of its product, itâs unclear how it will evolve under this new leadership.\n\nKey features:\n\nColor management: Supports a variety of standard formats, including CMYK (for print designs) and RGB (for digital designs).\n\nTime-saving tools: No matter your project, Affinityâs grids and guides simplify graphic design.\n\nOne-time purchase: No subscription fees.\n\nZoom: This graphic design software boasts a 1,000,000% zoom for precise designing and editing.\n\nX-ray view: Examine the skeleton of your work for more precise projects.\n\nPros:\n\nUnlimited artboards.\n\nLess resource-demanding.\n\nAffordably priced.\n\nQuick setup.\n\nRaster and vector workspaces in one program.\n\nExcellent customer service.\n\nCons:\n\nConfusing onboarding and installation documentation.\n\nNo cloud services.\n\nSteep learning curve.\n\nPlatforms: Windows, Mac, iPad\n\n3. Procreate\n\nProcreate is a graphic design software thatâs a complete art studio, made exclusively for iPad and Apple Pencil support. With a one-time purchase of $19.99, customers can dive into 3D painting, use state-of-the-art brush control, and import and export PDFs. Procreate's design tools work in 3D and preview in real-time AR.Â\n\nKey features:\n\nEditing tools: 200 customizable brushes.\n\nColor management: Intuitive selection of complementary colors and ColorDrop tool for fill.\n\nFinishing filters: Unifying image management for creating the perfect look.\n\nOne-time purchase: No in-app purchases.\n\nHover features: Brush Cursor, Gallery Previews, Selections, and Brush Size and Opacity Gestures.Â\n\nPros:\n\nExtensive tutorial library.\n\nIntuitive UI.\n\nApple Pencil support.\n\nImport Photoshop brushes.\n\nCons:\n\nNo free version.\n\nLimited layering.\n\nPlatforms: iPad\n\n4. Adobe Photoshop\n\nAdobe Photoshop has long remained the industry standard for desktop publishing.

It works with layers and filters to create stunning effects, with both vector and raster images.Â\n\nWhile you can create templates, none are included with the program. But despite the lack of templates, the software is lightweight â taking up very little storage â and offers a generous 30-day free trial.\n\nAffinity Photo has garnered many accolades in recent years because of its versatility and functionality. It packs a lot of features for the price. You can do sophisticated editing with its 360-degree image editing, panoramic stitching, and HDR merge.

It uses a drag-and-drop interface that streamlines the design process for beginners.Â\n\nThis program has a vast selection of images, templates, backgrounds, and fonts to get the ball rolling. But, while it offers some of these for free, many require in-app purchasing.\n\nCanva excels in a broad range of industries thanks to its extensive template gallery. The sampling is professional and offers excellent starting points for brainstorming.Â\n\nThere are three pricing plans, including a free one for individuals and small teams. Paid plans offer the fuller suite of features, like 1TB of cloud storage.\n\nKey features:\n\nDrag-and-drop design: A user-friendly interface helps beginners start creating right away.\n\nCollaboration tools: Built-in editing tools offer real-time collaboration.\n\nSocial media integration: Share Canva-created social media posts directly to popular platforms.\n\nPros:\n\nBeginner-friendly.\n\nFree version available.\n\nWizard for on-the-fly creation.\n\nRobust collection of resources and tutorials.\n\nCons:\n\nLimited free features, requires in-app purchases.\n\nUneditable downloads.\n\nPlatforms: Web browser, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS\n\n7.

While you can use it with other Adobe programs, it has a unique UX design that uninitiated users may find hard to use. Itâs best suited for image-heavy posters, presentations, and documents.Â\n\nHowever, InDesign is a resource-hungry program (like most Adobe software). In exchange, you gain a full-stack suite of tools, from resizing to subject-aware text wrapping to color location.

It has some of the welcome features of similar apps, including its ecosystem of complementary programs. And it supports several file formats, including SVG and PSD.Â\n\nThe price for this web-based design app is excellent: It has a free trial and free version. Unfortunately, the free version is ad-heavy. For an ad-free experience, priced packages start at $0.99/month.\n\nKey features:\n\nDrag-and-drop interface: Features a beginner-friendly UX.\n\nTemplate library: A vast library of templates includes professional-looking options for ads, flyers, and business cards.\n\nSocial media content: Choose from Facebook event covers, Pinterest pins, and LinkedIn company posts, among others.\n\nAI-powered tools: Pixlr includes AI-enhanced features, like a background remover and an image generator.\n\nAnimations: Use presets to animate any design.\n\nPros:\n\nAffordably priced.\n\nVersion options for varying skill levels and needs.\n\nBatch editing.\n\nCons:\n\nNo TIFF or BMP support.\n\nLimited templates.\n\nNo online cloud storage .\n\nPlatforms: Cloud, web-based, iPad, Android\n\n10.

And its robust collaboration features allow teammates to work alongside each other in real time.Â\n\nVista Create offers a 30-day free version â after that, customers must sign up for the starter or pro plan. Because this softwareâs pricing is based on user number, itâs most cost-effective for solopreneurs or freelancers but might quickly become pricey for larger, growing organizations.\n\nKey features:\n\nSocial media scheduler: Users can upload graphics onto social media at specific times.\n\nCreative assets: Vista offers a vast library of royalty-free vectors, photos, and videos.\n\nProfessionally designed templates: Ready-to-use templates enable users to quickly set up social media posts, web ads, and print projects.\n\nPros:\n\nAffordable for individual creation.\n\nRobust template library.Â\n\nBeginner-friendly.\n\nCons:\n\nLong lag times and bugs.\n\nPlatforms: Web browser on any OS or mobile app for iOS or Android\n\n13.

This tool provides much of the same functionality for free and has a customizable workspace with user-friendly navigation.\n\nGIMP usually works well with Photoshop files, but Photoshop updates its platform more frequently, sometimes causing compatibility issues.
