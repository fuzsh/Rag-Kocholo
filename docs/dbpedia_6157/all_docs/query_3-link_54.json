It seems to be headed down a dark path.\n\nI don’t want to be unhelpful however there seems to be some really strange decisions being made for this FOSS application. I’m on Linux BTW.\n\nI’ve been using GIMP for too long to remember at this stage 15+ years. I’ve seen it go from an awesome image editor and file converter to a frustrating-to-use piece of software.\n\nWhat was wrong with the icon table showing all of the icons in the top-left of the screen (whatever it’s called)? Now, i have to hover and click. This NEVER works, so i have to go to the docs and get the shortcut. Yes I can configure this. I have many systems though. I have to switch all of them.\n\nWhat happened to the dynamic font selector? Do this even exist anymore? Why would someone remove this key design feature?\n\nIt’s become super-frustrating to use this software for numerous reasons. Are we trying to make it more difficult? Why are we moving in the wrong direction?\n\nPS: what happened to the s**t-load of Bitcoin the community was sitting on? Did this every find it’s way back to the community?\n\nI’m just venting here guys. I appreciate the hardwork the community has put into GIMP over the years.\n\nHELP!!\n\nI think others have replied to most of this.\n\nynamic font selector - under the Wndows menu, dockable dialogues/tool options, or dockable dialogues/fonts; these have not changed.\n\nFinances - we do give a report; in the past it’s been first at GIMP Con and later at libregraphicsmeeting.org each year (was given last week), but as we move to a more formal setup we will probably be having a iull financial statement prepared, We do use donated money, although for rather complex readings (precedural, technical, legal, tax) we weren’t able to use the bitcoin money, we have (for moer than two years) been working on that one, and it looks like the situation will change in the next month or so.\n\n@barefootliam, thank you for your clarification. I can confirm that I was unable to find any written financial reports on the web. However, I believe this may change in the future if I understand you correctly.\n\nRegarding the “Dynamic Font Selector” feature, I have been thinking about it and I remember that a user can dynamically change the font in the following way:\n\nType a text into the text area on the canvas.\n\nIn the dockable Font Tool Options Dialogue, hold the mouse over the Font button to the left of the font name. Now scroll with the mouse wheel up or down to change the font on the canvas.\n\nI have successfully reproduced this with GIMP 2.8.22 as well as the current 2.10.38 (thanks to Distrosea.com and Ubuntu Studio). I don’t know about future GIMP 3’s behaviour.\n\nAnyway, the term “dynamic” can have many meanings in the given context. Here are two more:\n\na dynamic text box vs. a fixed-size text box\n\na dynamic (=variable) font vs. a static font.\n\nAs long as the original poster does not clarify, it’s not our task to do the guesswork. I’ve already spent too much time on this."
