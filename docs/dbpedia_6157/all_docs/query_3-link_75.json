        "text": "Once you selected whatever part of the picture you want to move, press ctrl-x and then ctrl-v. This will cut and paste the selection to a new layer. Now you can use the move tool to move the new layer around.\n\nNote: The move tool can move layers, selections, and paths. Make sure the layer option in the move tool is selected (in the toolbox).\n\nEdit:\n\nYou can also select an area, then hold down ctrl-alt and drag the selected area as described here. Once you start dragging, you can release the ctrl key to stop constraining the move to cardinal directions. After dropping the selection, you can still move it with the arrow keys.\n\nRotating and scaling selections seem to behave as expected (automatically creating a new layer). I'm not sure why they didn't make the move tool behave like that too.\n\nThe following is an updated and simplified answer to this older issue.\n\nThere are two tools being discussed: the Selection Tool and the Move Tool. One might intuitively think you use the selection tool to select, and then hop over to the move tool to move. That is not the case.\n\nAll the work is performed with the Selection Tool. Don't use the Move Tool.\n\nChoosing the Rectangle Selection Tool, for example, one selects an area. While remaining on the selection tool, one uses CTRL+ALT to drag the selected image to a different location. Once having done so, it seems that CTRL+ALT is no longer needed for further selection movement (as of at least 10/2014, GIMP 2.8.20).\n\nThere are also hints provided in the status bar to try combinations of SHIFT,CTRL, and ALT, and indicates what will occur as you press them.\n\nMore info here: https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-using-selections.html\n\nNone of the suggested solutions worked for me. I eventually realized that the layer I was selecting inside of, was not the same size as the image. So when I moved my copied selection, it moved outside the layer I was on, and thus displayed as an empty selection.\n\nMaking the current layer the same size as the image solved the problem. After that copy/paste/drag worked as expected.\n\nTo Resize the Layer to Image Size: Alt + L, then click on Layer to Image Size\n\nFor completeness, the question was also asking about the selection process. One way to select part of an image for editing is to use the magic selection wand. This works well if there is only one image on the selected layer (this is the way I tend to work so I can edit easily).\n\nSelect the layer the image to be moved is on, and use the fuzzy select wand to select what is outside the image (could be a single colour or a transparent background). Once the desired part of the layer has been selected, choose Select/Invert from the menu (this inverts the fuzzy selection from what is outside the part of the image to be moved to what is to be moved), then use ctrl/alt and the mouse to move the selected portion of the image.\n\nCtrl + Alt did not work for me.Neither did turning it into a floating selection for whatever reason. I may need to just fiddle with it but I was in a hurry.\n\nLayers Solution: I had to make the selection, Ctrl + X to cut, Ctrl + V to paste, then in the layers tab I turned the \"pasted floating selection\" into a layer. I could then move that new layer around. When you're done you can right click that layer and \"Merge Down\" if you need it to all be one layer again."
