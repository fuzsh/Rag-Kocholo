        "text": "GIMP 2.99.8, a development version with many new features, has been released, but 3.0 is taking its time due to system changes that break things.\n\nThe GNU Image Manipulation Program is a full-featured bitmap image editor with a long history, the first public release being January 1996. Version 1.0 came in June 1998.\n\nIt is appreciated for its extensive features (and free price) but development is slow. The current production version is 2.10, the first version of which came out in April 2010, built using Gtk 2.x. That said, GIMP 2.10 is regularly updated, most recently with 2.10.28 last month, featuring many bug fixes especially on Windows.\n\nVersion 2.99.8 uses Gtk 3 and is described as having \"a huge set of improvements.\" In summary:\n\nClone and heal tools now work across multiple layers.\n\nWindows Ink support, described as \"a huge milestone for artists using Windows.\"\n\nThe GIMP icon in the taskbar will no longer include a preview of the image. \"This complicated locating GIMP's window among windows of other running applications,\" said the team.\n\nJPEG-XL support, and improved import of Adobe Photoshop files, with support for PSD files of larger than 4GB.\n\nBug fixes including an end to \"huge memory leaks\" when using Wayland on Linux.\n\nAnother important change is that a new contributor, Lukas Oberhuber, has taken on development packaging for macOS, which was previously lacking, though the team says that more macOS contributors are still needed. A lot of work has also been done on the GIMP infrastructure for continuous integration, including testing and releasing.\n\nThe GIMP turns 25 and promises to carry on being the FOSS not-Photoshop\n\nGIMP open source image editor forked to fix 'problematic' name\n\nIt may be poor man's Photoshop, but GIMP casts a Long Shadow with latest update\n\nGIMP masks font downloads, adds horizon fix in new build\n\nDoes this mean GIMP 3.0 is nearly done? No date is set for this and the roadmap only states that it is a \"work in progress.\"\n\nAccording to the release announcement: \"Taking care of technology changes (Wayland on Linux and macOS in particular) these days is also taking quite a toll in our development efficiency as we spend a lot of time fixing things which just get broken because the underlining systems change.\""
