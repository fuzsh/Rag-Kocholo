When the image is reopened, it will have an empty Undo History.\n\nOthers apparently were too (several years ago) and filed a bug report, which is still sort-of open: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/89\n\nBe that as it may, are there any ways to effectively save the \"undo history\" in GIMP still? E.g., by creating a new layer (if so, with which settings/options?) for every single operation?"
