        "text": "We have been discussing with @aryeom about this. Since some people are starting to try and help with design (thinking of @rangelovd in particular), and because that's something we wanted to do for a long time, maybe we could/should start creating a design team. What it means could imply:\n\nCreate a repository, maybe called gimp-design where design team would discuss design topics. This is already what we do on the main tracker, but it is mixed/lost in the middle of bug reports and the like. I believe that a dedicated repository would help making design decision more visible and important. Also it could help working on work-in-progress designs, before committing to main repositories; and it could be used as well to commit non-software designs (for instance, we had a design for the MS Store some time ago; or if we want to make t-shirts for the team at some point, or other stuff).\n\nMaybe we could install penpot on design.gimp.org domain? It looks like an interesting tool (though we only saw the talk at LGM and yesterday I registered to the public instance to make quick tests, but I'm not at all knowledgeable on such design tools). Who has tested? What's your opinion? Basically we are proponent on the \"eat your own dog food\" philosophy, which here also means \"let's work only with Free Software\". I know that maybe some proprietary software may be more advanced, but I'd really prefer if we could improve design decision based on FLOSS (and if needed, we can report, or even propose patches, to the FLOSS tools we'd use, Penpot or any other).\n\nConclusion of designs should ideally lead to specs which could be published on the developer website, waiting for implementation.\n\nAbout the designer-developer interaction\n\nWe had a designer working with GIMP by the past and it didn't go all well in the end. So when I propose this, my idea is the following:\n\nDevelopers should inquire designers when they want to do something which seems not so obvious design-wise.\n\nDesigners are more than welcome to propose ideas, evolution on any topic they wish (even when not asked), of course.\n\nNevertheless don't forget that everyone is a human being with thoughts, which means that anyone can have good ideas, and sometimes not so good ones. This means that the design process should not be a one-direction process (designers giving orders to developers). The best process is usually a discussion. As a developer, the best design I ever worked on were when I could exchange ideas, and sometimes disagree with designers, convince, be convinced and find new solutions to problems.\n\nAlso sometimes when developers want a quick solution to a big problem, they may not wait for the right design, but it doesn't mean that the right design cannot be implemented afterwards (incremental development).\n\nOn other other hand, for issues which are not in a hurry (because it's not an obvious blocking bug, for instance), it may often be better to wait for designers to provide the right designs, even if the discussion takes a bit of time.\n\nWhen the designer team has nice specs written out, do not forget that GIMP is volunteer-based. Don't be too frustrated if your designs are not immediately implemented (or even after months or worse, years!). I am frustrated too, by myself not being fast enough to implement all the stuff I want to work on. But we are human too and we just can't do everything (and everyone has also their own priorities).\n\nBasically this can all be summarized by: communication matters! Also we only want nice communication. I don't care for the genius (or pretend-genius) mean designer. I want to be happy working on GIMP. :-)\n\nIn any case, we definitely believe that the project could benefit from having in-house designers working more closely with GIMP (and with the right tool).\n\nFuture evolution\n\nHaving a design team is nice, but what would be a huge step forward would be real usability testing. Many propositions by designers we have had across the years are hard to actually get through because we don't in fact know who uses GIMP and how. Gathering input from people would be a nice first step. This means real and meaningful sampling, with as less bias as possible, with known target. In particular, it's not \"sending a survey on Twitter, gathering barely a few dozens answers by followers, with hugely biased question and answers, just after a video when a youtuber clearly stated an opinion on the topic\". I have seen this so many times now, done by youtubers trying to have GIMP follow their wishes, but this is not how good design can ever be created.\n\nSo yeah, if we had a proper design team, maybe they could try and run as unbiased usability studies as possible, maybe also work with universities (which would appreciate working with GIMP team) or other orgs?\n\nDon't forget the main target of GIMP too: while catering to beginners who need to be able to use GIMP in order to go further, don't forget that GIMP is an advanced software for pro or advanced users. This needs to be taken into account in any study.\n\nIt means that the kind of study where you only select pros not using GIMP and try to have them using GIMP are very important too. Such as selecting pros using GIMP daily and checking what are their pain points.\n\nPersonally, that's basically what we have done, @aryeom and I, for the last 10+ years, and how we developed GIMP all those years, though our result is limited to what 2 people can do. Having more people and a well-written process for this would greatly help.\n\nAnyway that's the kind of stuff I've dreamed about for years for GIMP. I know we can do much better than what we are doing now, as a team and a community.\n\nI'm not saying this part has to happen now. First going slowly by officially making a design team would be a good first step.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat do everyone think? Should we go ahead with this?"
