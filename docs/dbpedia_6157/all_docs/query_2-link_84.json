GIMP runs a command to check the version of DarkTable that’s installed and adds the DarkTable plug-in accordingly. When DarkTable updated their commandline API, GIMP’s check no longer worked and thus the plug-in wasn’t added.\n\nWe updated the code to check for Darktable in the 2.99 development release (with a lot of help from the DarkTable developers!) and I’ll try to backport it to 2.10 if we have any more releases before GIMP 3.0.\n\nIn addition to the info provided by @Kofa…this script can also be used. I just confirmed that it works on Win11 and you can specify more editors so that you have a drop down list to choose from if you use additional software to GIMP.\n\nhttps://darktable-org.github.io/luadocs/lua.scripts.manual/scripts/contrib/ext_editor/\n\nI have GIMP, ON1 and Affinity Photo and I can use any of them via this method… from within DT doing a round trip with a Tiff file…\n\nRight - we didn’t merge the API update until after 2.99.18 was released: Issue #10572: Use new Darktable API (!1550) · Merge requests · GNOME / GIMP · GitLab\n\nIt’ll be available in 3.0 RC1 (the next GIMP release), and I’ll try to get it backported to 2.10.40 if we publish a last 2.10 release."
