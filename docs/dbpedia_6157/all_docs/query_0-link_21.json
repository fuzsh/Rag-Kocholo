        "text": "GIMP is Free Software, mostly licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) license, and historically part of the GNU Project.\n\nIn the free software world, there is generally no distinction between users and developers. As in a friendly neighborhood, everybody pitches in to help their neighbors. Please consider the time you give in assistance to others as payment.\n\nWays in which you can help:\n\nFix bugs or program new features\n\nOur Developer Website is where you want to start learning about being a code contributor.\n\nReport bugs (errors in the program)\n\nAs any application, GIMP is not bug-free, so reporting bugs that you encounter is very important to the development.\n\nTest existing features and provide feedback\n\nIf you think a feature can be improved somehow, you can discuss the improvements on the forums and create enhancement requests (the same way you report bugs).\n\nWrite or improve the documentation\n\nThe Documentation websites tells you all about contributing.\n\nTranslate GIMP or documentation to your own language\n\nContact the respective translation team for your language. The Translation Project page of GNOME is also of interest.\n\nWrite tutorials on this website\n\nWe have a procedure for writing tutorials too!\n\nImprove this website\n\nCreating websites that contain useful information is very important. It is just as important as doing bug reports. A website contains a lot of information that are needed for the development to move on and it also contains information that will help the public to understand what the application is all about. We explain how to help us in a dedicated tutorial.\n\nMake artwork for GIMP\n\nAfter all, GIMP is for artists, designers, photographers and other creators. So if you want to contribute your art under a Libre license, feel free to reach out.\n\nLet people know you used GIMP for your artwork\n\nOn your website, social networks or whatnot!\n\nGive away copies of GIMP\n\nThis is Free Software, it is made to be shared, just like knowledge and know-how. Give GIMP to your neighbors, your friend, your family, everyone!\n\nHelp others to learn GIMP\n\nWrite books about GIMP, teach it in university, in websites, video tutorial, local community workshops, everywhere! GIMP is free to use and will never try to tamper with your work.\n\nHelp new GIMP users in online forums\n\nSee the Discuss page for a list of official discussion venues for GIMP. Helping in non-official forums, for instance in your native language is also great!\n\netc.\n\nAs you can see, anyone can help. This is what a community is about.\n\nOnce you’ve figured out what to do, be bold and get to work!\n\nGIMP’s community is a friendly one, but it probably is still worth saying this: Try not to take critiques personally. We all just want GIMP to be the best that it can be. Once approved, your edits will be merged into the code base, making you an official GIMP contributor. And if you keep up the good work, not only will this process get easier with practice, your administrative privileges in GIMP development will also increase too.\n\nDevelopment Status¶\n\nThe team is currently busy working on v3.0. This will be a port of GIMP to GTK+3, much newer and better supported version of the user interface toolkit.\n\nA huge part of GIMP’s source code is related to the user interface, so this port is a major undertaking, especially since we shall break API and refactor numerous parts of the program.\n\nWe still need to port more plugins to become GEGL operations. If you are willing to help with that, please refer to the Porting filters to GEGL page to see what you could work on."
