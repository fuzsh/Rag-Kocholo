I extracted them and placed the new folders into the folder recommended to in GIMP ..... restarted GIMP but they didn't install .....\n\nThat article basically said the exact same thing as the one I used in the photos above ..... apparently I got the avif files to open but to change them to another format you had to do it one at a time ......\n\nI never did get the batch file to work ..... thanks\n\nYes and that is where the problem begins as there is no continuity in how these extensions are developed and by what means ..... unfortunately I'm not versed enough in Linux to know the hundreds of ways to convert these extensions to run on GIMP ...... (sigh)\n\nBUT OMG I found a program that allowed me to both batch and change the format of avif files ......\n\n____________________________________ **gThumb **_________________________________\n\nIt is so simple even a child can do it ..... I tried using gThumb back on z16 Pro and never did figure out how to do it after many hours of trying ..... not sure if the apt was upgraded or my going to Z17 did the trick but it WORKS .....\n\nFirst make gThumb your default apt for avif files here .....\n\nThen convert from avif to the new format ......\n\nFinally batch you files ......\n\nPut you newly converted files where ever you want ........"
