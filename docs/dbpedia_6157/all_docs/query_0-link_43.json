The source code can be found here. The icon, Wilber, the GIMP mascot, comes from a vector image source (SVG) made available by Jakub Steiner, available as Creative Commons by-sa 3.0. This app is not created by the main GIMP development team. Instead it is an adaptation that allows the Linux version to run on Android."
