        "text": "Anyone familiar with photo and graphic manipulation software such as Photoshop, Corel Draw, or PaintshopPro recognizes the power of GIMP for modifying graphic images. GIMP represents one of the most popular and useful applications in the open-source pantheon. Applications with the functionality of GIMP tend to cost upwards of $1,200 when you include their plug-ins and add-ons.\n\nOur treatment in this chapter does not include a GIMP tutorial. If you want to learn to use GIMP, you can find ample documentation in bookstores and on the Web. The GIMP manual, which includes approximately one thousand pages, exists at http://manual.gimp.org. Here we focus on the engineering improvements in GIMP, provided by Sun for the JDS.\n\nOne of the first things users of GIMP notice is the opening screen that pops up when you select it from the Launch menu through Launch → Applications → Graphics → Image Editor. Figure 10-7 represents a new face to GIMP, provided by the Sun development team.\n\nBefore Sun enhanced GIMP, users typically had difficulties adjusting to the project’s interface and style of navigation, which resembled PhotoShop 3.0. Sun has added features to allow for drop-down menus and increased productivity, by adding common criteria to the usability design."
