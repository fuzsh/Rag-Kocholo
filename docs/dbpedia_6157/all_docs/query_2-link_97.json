        "text": "GIMP is an image manipulation package managed by gimp.org and available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. GIMP is \"free\" in the GNU sense of the word; the user is free to use, copy, study, modify or redistribute GIMP as Free software.\n\nGIMP Homepage\n\nBooks for this lesson\n\nThe Gimp\n\nAdd notes for installing GIMP on your operating system below.\n\nGIMP is included as the standard image editor on most general purpose Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Mandriva, and SUSE, etc..\n\nVisit the GIMP for Windows Current Stable download page.\n\nYou basically download 2 packages:\n\nThe GIMP installer\n\nThe help package in your language (optional)\n\nRun the installers. If you have problems leave a message on the talk page.\n\nTo run the GIMP on the Macintosh in OSX prior to 10.5 (Leopard), you need to do two things, first install X11 then install GIMP. OSX 10.5 comes with X11 bundled.\n\nGIMP uses the X Windows System, which is a an open source way to support a graphical user interface. If you have OSX 10.4 (Tiger), X11 installs very easily from the OSX 10.4 install disk (Apple's webpage for X11). Insert your OSX 10.4 install disc #1 and scroll down to find the \"Optional Installs\". Double click on the Optional Installs package. Go through a series of dialog windows until you reach a window where you can select the type of software you want to install. X11 is in the \"applications\" folder. Click the check box next to X11 in order to install X11. Click the install button.\n\nSuggestions.\n\nBefore you install X11, take the time to backup your hard drive.\n\nBefore you install X11, take the time to repair your hard drive using disc utility.\n\nAfter you install X11 from the software install disk, run Software Update and get the latest version of X11 from Apple.\n\nInstall GIMP\n\nA simple way to install GIMP is to use Gimp.app. Download Gimp-2.2.11.dmg (Universal) and double click on the disc image to start the installation.\n\nThere is also a growing MacGIMP community project at www.wilber-loves-apple.org. Also with more recent builds for OSX 10.4/10.5 users.\n\nWarning\n\nThe GIMP organization also has instuctions for downloading the source code for GIMP. This is NOT what you want or need. Be sure to access the SourceForge version (called \"GIMP.app\") as mentioned above.\n\nDownloading \"GIMP.app\"\n\nI downloaded the file using FoxFire and dTaOneClick. This plug in for FoxFire allows you to stop and start the download which took me about 8 hours at 31K baud.\n\nGetting started\n\nGimp Introduction for Beginners (Youtube) by Chris Navarre[1]\n\nGimp Tutorials (Youtube) by TJ FREE\n\nGIF Animation\n\nImage maps\n\nMake an article on how to use every specific tool.\n\nMake a stellar wall paper using the GIMP\n\nw:Inkscape for vector graphics\n\nTools for creating internet content\n\nTools for digital audio file creation and editing.\n\nAudacity - Free sound editor for recording and editing Apple GarageBand - Macintosh software for manipulating digital audio Wiki Campus Radio - Live internet chat and podcasts Podcasting - how to make a podcast See also: Category:Audio\n\nText files\n\nICAU1129A - Operate a word processing application Word processing challenges - develop your word processing skills HTML - content development at Topic:HTML. blogs - create a web log at Wikiversity or at another website Wiki and Introduction to Wikiversity - wiki websites and Wikiversity in particular See also: Category:Writing\n\nSee also: Digital media workshop - Related discussion: Free content"
