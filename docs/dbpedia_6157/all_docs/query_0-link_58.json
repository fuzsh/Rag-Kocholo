It was named as General Image Manipulation Program. Later, Kimball and Mattis met with Richard Stallman (GNU Project) while visiting the University of California. They asked to change the General word with GNU, and the Stallman approved. From here, the software had become part of the GNU software collection.\n\nIts first release had proper computer architectures and operating systems support. The first release supported all UNIX-based systems such as Linux, HP-UX, and SGI IRIX. Since the initial release, it has been extended for other operating systems such as Windows and macOS. The Windows support in GIMP 1.1 was started by Tor M. Lillqvist (Finish Programmer) in 1997 for the Windows 32-bit platform.\n\nFollowing the first version, it was adopted by users, and several communities of contributors were formed. Communities were started by developing plug-ins, artwork, tutorials, and techniques.\n\nGTK (Gimp Tool Kit) was developed for the development of GIMP. Later, it was replaced by its successor GTK+, which was redesigned by using object-oriented programming methods.\n\nGIMP Versions\n\nThe first version of GIMP was released in January 1996 as \"GIMP 0.54\" with various colors and file format support. It got updated over the years and released many versions. The version list of GIMP is as follows:\n\nGIMP 0.54\n\nGIMP 0.60\n\nGIMP 0.99\n\nGIMP 1.0\n\nGIMP 1.1\n\nGIMP 1.2\n\nGIMP 2.0\n\nGIMP 2.2\n\nGIMP 2.4\n\nGIMP 2.6\n\nGIMP 2.8\n\nGIMP 2.10\n\nGIMP 3.0\n\nGIMP 3.2\n\nGIMP User Interface\n\nThe GIMP user interface looks like a typical image editing tool. A dedicated design team designs it. It is presented in two forms\n\nsingle-window mode\n\nmultiple window mode\n\nThe default view of GIMP is multiple window mode, which has the tools and tool settings on the left and other utility dialogues on the right. The center screen displays image being manipulated. The top navigation menu is always on in-display mode. Consider the below image:\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore learning GIMP, you should have a working knowledge of the computer and its operating system. So, Ensure how to use the basic commands and menus with primary I/O devices since it is an image manipulation tool, so you don't need to worry about the prior knowledge of any technology. Just make sure you have properly installed it on your system.\n\nAudience\n\nOur GIMP Tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals both.\n\nProblem\n\nWe assure you that you will not find any discrepancies or problems in this tutorial.
