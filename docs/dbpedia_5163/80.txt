Paul Rutherford, a leading figure on the British free and improvising jazz scenes for many years, has died, at the age of 67. Best known for his pioneering use of multiphonics (where the player sings into the mouthpiece while playing) Rutherford formed the group Iskra 1903 with guitarist Derek Bailey and bassist Barry Guy in the 1970s which lasted with a different line-up until the mid-1990s. Rutherford also played with Mike Westbrook and the free jazz leviathan Globe Unity Orchestra but also liked to perform solo and recorded albums such as The Gentle Harm of the Bourgeoisie.
