        "meta_description": "2022 restock. Corbett vs. Dempsey presents a reissue of <B>Misha Mengelberg</B>'s <U>Groupcomposing</U>, recorded in 1970 and originally released in 1978. Comprised of a one-time international free music supergroup, and originally released as the sixth production on pianist Mengelberg and drummer <B>Han Bennink</B>'s ICP label, <U>Groupcomposing</U> has been largely absent from the history books. This is the case because the record has been so unavailable, certainly not as a comment on the magnitude and magnificence of the music. With its Bennink cover (take that <B>Andy Warhol</B>!) and its two side-long tracks, it is an improvised music aficionado's treasure. Mengelberg and Bennink are joined by Bennink's brother, <B>Peter Bennink</B>, on alto saxophone and bagpipes(!), with an incredible reed section of <B>Evan Parker</B> and <B>Peter Brötzmann</B>, <B>Paul Rutherford</B> on trombone, and <B>Derek Bailey</B> on guitar. Moving from peaks of intensity to droning deescalation, totally improvised live in concert in 1970, <U>Groupcomposing</U> should be heard in the company of related records like Brötzmann's <U>Machine Gun</U> (CF 020LP, 2018) and <U>Nipples</U> (CF 013LP, 2016), early <B>London Jazz Composer's Orchestra</B> and <B>Globe Unity Orchestra</B>, and <B>Manfred Schoof</B>'s <U>European Echoes</U> (CF 008LP, 2013. The music is reissued here for the first time as a stand-alone CD, with original album art and an interior salon of never-published period photographs by <B>Gérard Rouy</B>. The first in an ongoing series of ICP reissues on Corbett vs. Dempsey, <U>Groupcomposing</U> restores a classic LP to its rightful place in the canon.",
