        "text": "Auston Matthews becomes Maple Leafs captain as John Tavares passes torch\n\n'After he let me know, I told him I was shaking, I got chills,' Matthews said.\n\nMatheson: Oilers in tough spot after Blues offer sheets for Broberg, Holloway\n\nOffer sheets are designed to put the squeeze on salary-capped teams and on Tuesday the Edmonton Oilers woke up to the St. Louis Blues putting their hands around their throat with not one but two rogue moves on Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway.\n\nDid former Edmonton Oilers GM Ken Holland drop the ball failing to sign Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway? Hmm\n\nThis in from Edmonton Oilers insider Bob Stauffer, host of Oilers Now, his description of how former Oilers GM Ken Holland failed to get Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway signed to new contracts this past hockey season.\n\nOilers' power forward Evander Kane set to undergo surgery, new report seems to confirm\n\nLots of confusion about the health status of Evander Kane , with conflicting recent reports that the Edmonton Oilers winger would be ready to go for training camp in September followed by another that he was likely to undergo surgery.\n\nFrom Randall to Matthews, all of the Maple Leafs captains\n\nThe ‘C’ carries lots of clout in this market with massive media and where almost all the franchise greats and multiple Cup winners wore it at some point.\n\n'A kick in the head': NHL reacts to Edmonton Oilers Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway offer sheets from St. Louis Blues\n\nThis in from the St. Louis Blues: “We have tendered offer sheets to Edmonton’s Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway…The offer to Broberg is for a two-year contract at $4,580,917 per year, the maximum offer that would require a second-round draft pick as compensation…The offer to Holloway is for a two-year contract at $2,290,457 per year, the maximum offer that would require a third-round draft pick as compensation.”\n\nGood vibrations for a \"reasonable\" contract between Edmonton Oilers and Leon Draisaitl, reports NHL insider\n\nThis in from NHL insider Frank Seravalli of the Daily Faceoff, some good vibrations on Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid’s new contracts with the Edmonton Oilers, with Seravalli suggesting that their cap hits might well be lower than expected.\n\nIntrigue! Edmonton Oilers star Evander Kane likely to go on Long Term Injured Reserve to start season, insider says\n\nThis in from Edmonton Oilers insider Bob Stauffer: “Hearing there is a very good chance that the Edmonton Oilers Evander Kane won’t be ready for the start of the season…that he may require surgery…and is likely to be on LTIR to start the year.”\n\nWhat to make of new Edmonton Oilers rumours about Leon Draisaitl contract and Evander Kane's health?\n\nThis in from the 2 Mutts Podcast, big news around the Edmonton Oilers contract negotiations with Leon Drasaitl and the health status of Evander Kane:\n\nYoung Edmonton Oiler transformed into elite defender by playing 'old man' hockey\n\nI never would have thought Evan Bouchard would win the Norris Trophy, not with such fantastic young players like Cale Makar, Quinn Hughes, Rasmus Dahlin, Miro Heiskanen, Noah Dobson and Adam Fox as his NHL contemporaries.\n\nJets' head coach Scott Arniel confident after team's summit wraps\n\nWhether it was his own fault, something born out of circumstance, or a combination of both, Scott Arniel knew he wanted to do things a little differently if he got another shot at a head coaching gig in the NHL.\n\nEdmonton Oilers star rises above misery: 'I hope everybody comes back. This team is f*ckin' special'\n\nVideo has come out showing the misery of defeat after Edmonton’s Game 7 loss to the Florida Panthers. There is silence in the dressing room until Edmonton Oilers team leader Zach Hyman says a few words, including: “I hope everybody comes back. This team is f*ckin’ special.”\n\nThese Edmonton Oilers \"B\" prospects have a common attribute: no fun to play against\n\n2024 Edmonton Oilers prospects Depth hopefuls #21-25 Last time around we introduced the Cult of Hockey ‘s fourteenth annual Oilers prospects series on a moderately hopeful note, pointing out that the ranks have been fleshed out significantly from last year’s paltry 27 hopefuls. In 2024 that number has risen to a much healthier 33, moreover many of the more recent additions will eventually be found near the top of the list.\n\nNever a better time for Jets to buy low on Patrik Laine, but does he fit?\n\nIf there were ever a storyline to captivate and re-invigorate a Winnipeg Jets audience, it’d be the return of Patrik Laine.\n\nEdmonton Oilers fans give failing grade to Jeff Jackson's management, survey says. Huh!?\n\nTwo teams made the Stanley Cup finals this year, but only one of those teams has the confidence of their fanbase, and it’s not the Edmonton Oilers, at least according to a survey done by The Athletic.\n\nEdmonton Oilers have replenished their prospect pool from the low ebb of 2023\n\n2024 Edmonton Oilers prospects: Preview / depth hopefuls #26-33 The August long weekend has come and gone, which can only mean the time has come for the Cult of Hockey ‘s annual prospects rankings.\n\nMarlies' Alex Nylander hopes to bring brother act to Maple Leafs\n\nAlex Nylander gushes it would be “a dream come true” to play with his brother William on the Maple Leafs — but knows he won’t simply be handed an NHL contract.\n\nMemo to Edmonton Oilers: No team has won Stanley Cup with a player earning more than $10 million\n\nThe NHL has had many great players, and in the past 15 seasons many of them made more than $10 million per year in salary.\n\nOverview of Edmonton Oilers' roster Stan Bowman just inherited from Ken Holland and Jeff Jackson\n\nTwelve days have passed since Stan Bowman was named the General Manager of the Edmonton Oilers. Twelve quiet days on the roster front, with no transactions of any type to this point. The roster remains exactly as it was on July 24, the day Bowman was hired.\n\nRandy Gregg, Craig MacTavish get the nod for Edmonton Oilers' Hall of Fame\n\nEstablished in 2022 and adding members at the rate of two per year, the Edmonton Oilers’ Hall of Fame is in no danger of running out of deserving candidates any time soon. This was proven yet a third time on Thursday with the reveal of the Class of ’24:"
