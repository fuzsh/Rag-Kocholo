        "text": "Bristol Beacon presents\n\nLondon Symphony Orchestra with Sir Antonio Pappano\n\nFri 12 April 2024, 7pm\n\nThis evening’s performance:\n\nSir Antonio Pappano Conductor\n\nAlison Balsom Trumpet\n\nTenebrae Choir\n\nLondon Symphony Orchestra\n\nWynton Marsalis Trumpet Concerto\n\nInterval\n\nMaurice Ravel Daphnis and Chloé\n\nPre-concert talk hosted by music educator Jonathan James\n\nWelcome\n\nToday is an important day in the developing relationship between the London Symphony Orchestra and Bristol Beacon as we welcome Chief Conductor Designate Sir Antonio Pappano to the Beacon Hall for the first time.\n\nWe also present virtuoso trumpeter Alison Balsom and the choral legends Tenebrae in a typically eclectic programme of Ravel and Wynton Marsalis.\n\nI’m thrilled that we are able to bring these extraordinary musicians to Bristol, the first of many delights to come.\n\nLook out for news of our 24/25 Orchestral Season which features further concerts from the LSO, to be announced later this spring.\n\nLouise Mitchell CBE\n\nChief Executive, Bristol Beacon\n\nWynton Marsalis (b. 1961): Trumpet Concerto\n\n1. March\n\n2. Ballad\n\n3. Mexican Son\n\n4. Blues\n\n5. French Pastoral (Flowing Waltz)\n\n6. Harlequin Two-Step\n\nWynton Marsalis made his name as a classical trumpet virtuoso with recordings of the Haydn, Hummel and Leopold Mozart trumpet concertos. That disc won a Grammy in 1984, along with another of Marsalis’ albums, the jazz smash Think of One. Four decades later he has written a Trumpet Concerto of his own, drawing on both classical and jazz idioms, along with just about everything in between.\n\nThis sprawling, six-movement monster is a sort-of trumpet encyclopedia. Over 35 minutes Marsalis presents various snapshots of the instrument, tracing its evolution and paying flamboyant tribute to some of its most cherished performers. This rear-view mirror approach was conceived jointly with Cleveland Orchestra Principal Trumpet Michael Sachs, for whom the Concerto was written: ‘We started talking about form and movements and ended up talking for an hour about great trumpet players we’ve admired and loved,’ Marsalis recalls. ‘We went through person after person, and I think all of that is in the Concerto.’\n\nMarsalis likes to joke that a trumpet sounded at the beginning of the world and will sound at its end too. So it does in his concerto. But, with typical Marsalian cheek, it is not the archangel Gabriel that sets things off – but a trumpeting elephant. This first-movement ‘March’ nods to the Classical concertos that brought Marsalis such renown, with its bright fanfares, lyrical counter melody and trumpet-timpani partnership. We also hear the first hints of what Marsalis calls ‘magical elements’: alternate fingerings, growls and flutters that spice up the trumpet’s palette and which are developed throughout the piece.\n\nIn the second movement, ‘Ballad’, the trumpet switches partners, leading the oboe in a doo-wop duet. Here Marsalis embraces the ‘unabashed romantic style of instrumental singing gifted to the world by Louis Armstrong’, taking the first movement countermelody and turning it up to maximum croon. But the mood shifts abruptly with ‘Mexican Son’, Marsalis’ ode to the Afro-Hispanic diaspora. Highlighting the ‘solitary, razor-sharp attack of the Spanish-inflected trumpet’, he reimagines the opening ‘March’ in a set of Spanish-inflected variations. A Spanish Bolero then sees the trumpet duel with a bassoon, before shuffling to a close in a 5/4-time Habanera.\n\nThe intellectual heart of the work, ‘Blues’, riffs on the idea of call-and-response to illustrate the tension within that genre between sacred and secular: as trombones and horns preach a po-faced sermon, the trumpet fidgets and jokes in the pews. Both grow in resolve before erupting into a lustrous brass chorale. A brief waltz, inspired by the dazzling trumpetry of Frenchmen Maurice André and Pierre Thibaud, then whisks us to the finale. Here, to the groove of an Eastern European two-step, Marsalis brings together themes from the five preceding movements in a manic jamboree; an army of orchestral percussion clatters while the soloist, wallowing in the full panoply of Marsalis’ ‘magical’ (or ‘Harlequin’) tricks, dances majestically atop the mayhem. At last, our elephant – who else? – brings the work to a close with a solitary fanfare.\n\nMarsalis is a collaborator as much as he is composer, and has clearly relished the opportunity to learn about his instrument while working on this Concerto: ‘[Sachs] has a very different body of knowledge and set of skills to the ones that I have,’ he admits, and plenty of the music therefore sits outside the composer’s usual fare. But the collaborative process goes both ways, and by tapping the limits of his own trumpet virtuosity, Marsalis wills the soloist to convey ‘the broad depth of feeling and the joy of defying technical limitations that defines our legacy as trumpeters’. And, being a jazzer, he has also left plenty of room in the score for spontaneity, thus allowing tonight’s soloist, Alison Balsom, to stomp her own mark on this emphatic, elephantic joyride.\n\n© Timmy Fisher\n\nMaurice Ravel (1875-1937): Daphnis and Chloé\n\nDance holds a treasured and central place in Ravel’s music, from La Valse and Boléro to the many pavanes, minuets, waltzes, foxtrots and tangos which pervade his instrumental and operatic music. The hour-long ballet Daphnis et Chloé makes a strong claim to be his greatest work; Ravel called it a ‘choreographic symphony’, indicating his pride at the way its kaleidoscopic moods, colours and dance-rhythms are integrated into a compelling musical and dramatic arc. Serge Diaghilev commissioned the new piece for his Ballets Russes in 1909, bringing together an impressive creative team: Nijinsky and Karsavina dancing the title roles; Mikhail Fokine as choreographer; Leon Bakst as designer; and Pierre Monteux to conduct Ravel’s new score. Things did not go smoothly, however, particularly between Ravel and Fokine. Each spoke almost nothing of the other’s language, and their artistic visions differed too. As he said, Ravel aimed “to compose a vast musical fresco in which I was less concerned with archaism than with reproducing faithfully the Greece of my dreams, very like that imagined by French artists at the turn of the eighteenth century.” It did not prove easy to reconcile this with Fokine’s vision of the “archaic dancing painted in red and black on Attic vases,” and when arguments also broke out between Fokine and Nijinsky Diaghilev came close to calling the whole thing off. The last straw was Ravel’s long-drawn out difficulty completing the final riotous danse générale, which in the end took him almost a year. Initially scheduled for the 1910 season, Daphnis was twice postponed and finally presented in May 1912.\n\nThe scenario is adapted from an erotic pastoral by the 2nd-century Greek writer Longus. From the hushed beauty of the opening bars Ravel evokes ‘the Greece of his dreams’ in shimmering perfection, conjuring an enchanted vision of the pastures of Lesbos where young men and women bring offerings for the nymphs whose statues guard the spot. Naïve Daphnis and clumsy Dorcon compete for a kiss from Chloe (beautiful, but no less naïve) which sends the victorious Daphnis into ecstacies, so that he is in no mood for an attempted seduction by Lyceion, which merely disturbs and confuses him. (In Longus’ original she is more successful, and teaches him the arts of love. In general, it is noteworthy how the stage scenario for this sumptuously sensual score avoids love-scenes; against all expectations, there is not even a pas-de-deux for Daphnis and Chloe. The music, however, more than makes up for this!) At this moment pirates attack and Chloe is kidnapped. Daphnis curses the powers who failed to protect her, and swoons. Magically the nymphs descend from their pedestals, dance around Daphnis, and lead him to a rock which transforms into a vast image of Pan. As darkness descends we hear distant voices as the curtain rises on the second tableau, a rough coast where the pirates are raucously celebrating their success. Forced to dance, Chloe tries feebly to escape, only to be carried off by the pirate leader Bryaxis. But mysterious sounds and apparitions intrude, and suddenly Pan himself appears, as the pirates run in terror.\n\nThe third and final tableau falls into three broad sequences. In the first, dawn steals over the cave where Daphnis wakes, and he is reunited with Chloe; this glorious scene is one of Ravel’s most sumptuous inspirations, both exquisite and powerful as it evokes the babbling stream, the rising sun and the lover’s rapturous emotions. In the second sequence the lovers show their gratitude to the gods by enacting Pan’s seduction of Syrinx, to a long and infinitely seductive flute solo which is another highpoint of the work. Finally, forgetting their roles, the lovers fall into each other’s arms; everyone joins them in the final dance, a wild and wine-fuelled affair of sheer pagan joy and exhilaration. Ultimately Daphnis et Chloé is, more than a tale of two lovers, the celebration of an idyllic fantasy-world: his Classical Neverland inspired Ravel to the richest and fullest expression of his art.\n\n© Jeremy Thurlow\n\nSir Antonio Pappano\n\nConductor\n\nOne of today’s most sought-after conductors, acclaimed for his charismatic leadership and inspirational performances in both symphonic and operatic repertoire, Sir Antonio Pappano is Chief Conductor Designate of the London Symphony Orchestra (assuming the full title from the 2024/2025 season) and has been Music Director of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden since 2002.
