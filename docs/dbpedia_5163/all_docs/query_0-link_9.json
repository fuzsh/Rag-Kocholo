Reissue of Emanem 4301, which was a much expanded reissue of Incus 3/4. 194 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 18 Euros\n\nISKRA 1903 \"Buzz Soundtrack\" (1970-1) Emanem 4066\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone), DEREK BAILEY (guitar) & BARRY GUY (double bass) performing a soundtrack for a film. Somewhat more restrained and gentle than their live performances (as heard on CHAPTER ONE Emanem 4301), but still very fine music. 79 minutes - previously unissued (except on film).\n\nSpecial price 9 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nISKRA 1903 \"Goldsmiths\" (1972) Emanem 5013\n\nA previously unissued concert by the original version of Iskra 1903 - PAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone), DEREK BAILEY (guitar) and BARRY GUY (double bass). Arguably their best extended concert captured on record. Plus two short extracts from another concert. 75 minutes - previously unissued.\n\nSpecial price 9 Euros\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD & ISKRA 1912 \"Sequences 72 & 73\" (1972-4) Emanem 4018\n\nTwo of the finest extended compositions for improvisers - the only published examples of Rutherford's early work in that idiom - featuring MAGGIE NICOLS & NORMA WINSTONE (voices), KENNY WHEELER (trumpet), MALCOLM GRIFFITHS, PAUL NIEMAN & GEOFF PERKINS (trombones), DICK HART (tuba), DAVE WHITE (clarinets and saxophones), EVAN PARKER (saxophones), HOWARD RILEY (piano), BARRY GUY (bass), plus TREVOR WATTS (saxophones) in 1972, and plus DEREK BAILEY (guitar) & TONY OXLEY (electronics) in 1973 - all conducted by the composer.

They find Rutherford at his most original and inventive, making wild music by enhancing his trombone with his voice, with mutes and other objects, as well as using his awesome speed and stunning range. No-one else has made the trombone sound like this, before or since. 75 minutes. 5 minutes originally on an FMP sampler - the rest is previously unissued.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD \"Neuph\" (1978/80) Emanem 4118\n\nTo make his third solo album, Rutherford went into a studio with both trombone and euphonium and used over-dubbing techniques to create unique pieces involving up to four brass instruments. The only completely solo performance features the euphonium. A couple of short tracks feature the trombone played back at double speed - one of them accompanied by a howling dog (the only other performer involved). This CD also includes two superb solo trombone improvisations recorded in Italian concerts a couple of years later. Reissue of SFA LP 092 with extra material. 70 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD \"Tetralogy\" (1978-1982) Emanem 5202 2-CD set\n\nA 2-CD set containing four very different settings all featuring PAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone & euphonium):\n\ntwo festival solos - one with electronics and the other without;\n\na festival brass quartet with GEORGE LEWIS (trombone), MARTIN MAYES (French horn) & MELVYN POORE (tuba);\n\nand a studio trio with PAUL ROGERS (double bass) & NIGEL MORRIS (drum set).\n\nThe electronically enhanced solo and the brass quartet are unlike anything else in Rutherford's discography.\n\nAll previously unissued. 141 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 9 Euros\n\n5027 STEVENS/RUTHERFORD/PARKER/GUY \"One Four and Two Twos\" (1978/79/92)\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD \"in Backward Times\" (1979-2007) Emanem 5045\n\nFour very different concert settings featuring sensational performances by trombonist PAUL RUTHERFORD:\n\ntwo festival solos - one from 1979 with electronics and the other from 2004 without;\n\na 1988 duo with PAUL ROGERS (double bass) a few months before their ROGUES CD;\n\nand from 2007 a trio with VERYAN WESTON (piano) and MARCIO MATTOS (cello & electronics)\n\n- a very promising group, except that this turned out to be Rutherford's last public appearance.\n\nAll previously unissued. 76 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 9 Euros\n\n5209 SPONTANEOUS MUSIC ORCHESTRA \"Search & Reflect\" (1973-81)\n\nISKRA 1903 \"Chapter Two\" (1981/3) Emanem 4303 3-CD set\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone, euphonium & electronics), PHILIPP WACHSMANN (violin & electronics), and BARRY GUY (double bass & electronics). The first time any early recordings of this trio have been issued. The bulk of the music in this set comes from a late 1983 tour of England - 4 concerts in 6 days - during which this trio used more electronics than before or since. The music in each concert moved in different directions, so it all had to be included. There are also two slightly earlier performances, one of which has saxophonist EVAN PARKER added to make the group Iskra 1904 for about 16 minutes. 223 minutes - previously unissued.\n\nSpecial price 12 Euros\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD TRIO \"GHEIM - live at Bracknell 1983\" Emanem 5034\n\nA short-lived improvising trio, featuring the trombonist with PAUL ROGERS (double bass) and NIGEL MORRIS (drums), that the leader put together to explore more free jazz-like areas than usual. Rutherford and Rogers play to their expected very high standards (even though it was one of the bassist's earliest recordings), while Morris shows why he is missed so much since he quit this music. The whole of their Bracknell Jazz Festival set is included along with some studio recordings. 77 minutes - Reissue of Emanem 4107 (which was a reissue of Ogun cassette OGC531 with extra material).\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\n4030 EVAN PARKER / PAUL RUTHERFORD / HANS SCHNEIDER / PAUL LYTTON \"Waterloo 1985\"\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD \"Trombolenium\" (1986-1995) Emanem 4072\n\nA collection of adventurous trombone solos recorded over nine years in four different spaces - two club rooms (one very dry), an Italian jazz festival, and a very resonant church. 76 minutes - previously unissued.\n\nCD deleted\n\n4204 LOL COXHILL \"Spectral Soprano\" (1954-1999)\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD & PAUL ROGERS \"Rogues\" (1988) Emanem 4007\n\nA sensational concert of trombone & double bass duos & solos by two of the greatest exponents of their respective instruments. Their opening 40 minute duet is a remarkable example of sustained extended improvisation. 78 minutes - previously unissued.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nISKRA 1903 \"South on the Northern\" (1988/9) Emanem 5203 2-CD set\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone), PHILIPP WACHSMANN (violin & electronics), and BARRY GUY (double bass & electronics). Two concerts in south London pubs - examples of free group improvisation at its very best, which just go to show that there was no musical reason for the hitherto gap in the documentation of this superb trio. 151 minutes - previously unissued.\n\nSpecial price 9 Euros\n\nISKRA 1903 \"Frankfurt 1991\" Emanem 4051\n\nA very fine concert by the trio of PAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone), PHILIPP WACHSMANN (violin & electronics) and BARRY GUY (amplified double bass). The first set comprises a 33 minutes piece - the second set includes one solo performance each. 74 minutes - previously unissued.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nRoTToR \"The First Full Turn\" (1998) Emanem 4026\n\nThe complete first quartet performance by PAUL RUTHERFORD (trombone), JULIE TIPPETT (voice), KEITH TIPPETT (piano) & PAUL ROGERS (double bass) - the highlight of the Le Mans festival. Plus a trombone solo from earlier in the year. 67 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\n4205 freedom of the city 2001 \"small groups\"\n\n4206 freedom of the city 2001 \"large groups\"\n\n4086 LOL COXHILL \"Out to Launch\" (2001-2)\n\nPAUL RUTHERFORD \"Chicago 2002\" Emanem 4082\n\nRutherford's appearance at the Empty Bottle Festival was his first visit to America apart from two previous tours in orchestras. His 31 minute trombone solo shows him still to be at the top of his game. The following day he was asked to organise a septet with JEB BISHOP (trombone), LOL COXHILL (soprano saxophone), MATS GUSTAFSSON (tenor saxophone), FRED LONBERG-HOLM (cello & electronics), KENT KESSLER (double bass) and KJELL NORDESON (percussion). They performed a concerto featuring Coxhill and a free improvisation. 77 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\nLOL COXHILL / TORSTEN MÜLLER / PAUL RUTHERFORD \"Milwaukee 2002\" Emanem 4097\n\nThe day after their Empty Bottle appearances (Emanem 4082 & Emanem 4086), these three travelled to Milwaukee for a concert, that featured superb unaccompanied solos by Rutherford (trombone), Müller (double bass) & Coxhill (soprano sax), as well as two short duos and a trio. 73 minutes.\n\nSpecial price 6 Euros\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\n\n4210 freedom of the city 2002 \"small groups\"\n\n4090 LONDON IMPROVISERS ORCHESTRA \"freedom of the city 2002\"\n\n4215 freedom of the city 2004 \"small groups\"\n\n4110 LONDON IMPROVISERS ORCHESTRA \"Responses, Reproduction & Reality\" (2003-4)\n\n4216 freedom of the city 2005"
