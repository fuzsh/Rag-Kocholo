It is proposed that our citizens purchase the instruments and give the band the use of them. About $150 would be required for this purposea sum which we presume might readily be raised. A good band is much needed here, and we see not why we may not have one. WC\n\n1860\n\n10 05 Watertown Brass Band at County Fair at Jefferson WR\n\n12 13 Watertown Brass Band at New Years celebration WD\n\n1866 WATERTOWNS FIRST BAND\n\nA picture of Watertowns first band organized in 1866, composed of Al Rutherford, Otto Schulerman, W. D. Sproesser, William F. Quentmeyer, Carl Nowack, William Sommerfelt, Frank Kartak, Fred Pohlmann, one unknown.\n\n1868\n\n-- --WATERTOWN CORNET BAND PICTURED\n\nVery few people today know that Watertown back in 1868 had an organization known as the Watertown Cornet Band and even fewer people know who the members of the organization were. It consisted of 9 members and a picture of the group has lately come to light through the W. D. Sproesser Co, which has in its possession one of the pictures. The picture has been framed and placed on display in the company's window. 8 of the 9 men in the group have been identified, but William Sproesser, who placed the picture on display, says he is unable to tell who the 9th man is. If any \"old timers\" see the picture and happen to know who the man is, Mr. Sproesser will appreciate it if they report it to him. The 8 whose names have been placed on the picture include A. Rutherford, A. Schuelermann, F. Pohlmann, W. F. Quentmeyer, C. Sommerfeld, Frank Kartack, W. D. Sproesser and C. J. Noack.

Picnicking will be the order of the day amid the sylvan shades in this favorite retreat and the hours will be enlivened with sweet chords of music from the Philharmonic Cornet Band. Arrangements have been made for grand balloon ascensions and other amusements during the afternoon. WR\n\n07 04 Philharmonic Band, 1883, Parade, school children to Concordia Island\n\n1800s, late\n\nGeorge Spohn, pictured with zither, late 1800s.\n\n1890\n\n07 09NEW CORNET BAND\n\nThe Fourth of July has passed in this city had a sort of free-for- all turn about it, our people mostly rendering homage to the anniversary with a true spirit of independence. Bunting was profusely displayed along the streets, and the fire cracker was ever present and of good report. The largest muster of people was at Turner park, where the new cornet band held forth from the pavilion, and Miss Pauline Voss read the declaration of independence. In the city park a number of families partook of their dinner, which was spread from numerous well-filled baskets taken to the grounds, tables and seats having been provided. Many pleasantly chatted and visited under the teepees during the afternoon, while the young people, with a few older ones mixed in for variety, engaged in frolic and amusement in the shaded recesses of the enclosure. WR\n\nHARDEGES ORCHESTRA\n\n06 04EIGHT-PIECE BAND\n\nWatertown is at last possessed of a band, one having been recently organized under the leadership of C. J. Wenck, composed of eight pieces. The band practices in rooms in the Electric Light building. It has seemed one of the strangest of strange things for a musical city like Watertown to be without a band. We trust that the new organization will meet with every encouragement and be well supported. It is due to the interest of our city that the band be well sustained. WR\n\n1895\n\n03 13\"HAYSEED\" BAND OF THE \"JOSH SPIUCEBY\n\nThe \"Hayseed\" band of the \"Josh Spiuceby\" company appeared on the streets shortly before noon yesterday, singly or in pairs, dressed in typical \"hayseed\" attire, and mingled with the crowds of country people, causing considerable merriment to those who watched them. Finally the members gathered at the post office corner and a band concert was given. WR\n\n05 22BAND CONCERTS AT CITY PARK\n\nThe open-air band concerts at the city park were inaugurated last evening by the Watertown Cornet band. A large crowd was on hand to listen to the music, and the concerts, which will be given regularly until further notice, promise to be quite popular. The common council has granted the band the use of the land for this purpose.

This image was taken inside the office of the old Fuermann brewery on S. First and Jones streets. Instruments are all made of cardboard, and also note the various music titles. The two gents on the floor are wearing uniforms of the Sinnissippi Band.\n\n1900\n\n02 13NEW ORCHESTRA FORMED\n\nIt may not be generally known that a new orchestra has been organized in this city, consisting of twenty members. The organization has for its purpose the production of the better class of orchestral music, and will prove of special value, in an instructive way, to its members. The founders have labored incessantly to interest the players of the city in the enterprise, and the result is a very creditable organization, which ought to be encouraged by our citizens in every way. The club will make its initial appearance tomorrow evening at the entertainment arranged for the visiting dairymen at Turner Opera house, for which it has offered its services. WR\n\n1902\n\n03 14JOHN PHILIP SOUSA PERFORMS IN WATERTOWN\n\nOur music-loving people have not been given such a treat for many a day as was vouchsafed to them last Monday afternoon when John Philip Sousa and the famous band visited our city, giving one concert.Turner Hall Opera House was filled with a most admiring and appreciative audience, composed of some of our best people, and quite a large contingent from neighboring towns, special trains being run to accommodate them. From the moment that Sousa, with his fine military bearing and the numerous decorations bestowed upon him during his recent visit to Europe, made his appearance on the stage, until the close of the concert, the interest manifested was intense; each number was enthusiastically applauded and the musicians were very generous in responding to encores. The trombone solo by Arthur Pryor, the soprano solo by Miss Maud Reese Davies, and violin solo by Miss Dorothy Hale, were all very much enjoyed and heartily applauded. While every number was good, we think the ones most enjoyed were the part from La Tosca and \"The Night Hall.\" Sousa went from here by special train to Fond du Lac. WG\n\n03 15SOUSA'S BAND CONCERT\n\nThe young men who have special charge of providing entertainments for our city are to be commended for their efforts to secure the highest class of talent and the best of its class. The coming of Sousas band demonstrated the fact that our people will patronize merit. Turner Opera House was seldom filled with a larger or more appreciative audience than the one that assembled Monday afternoon to welcome the great musician and his corps of trained artists.\n\nAlmost every city and village within a radius of thirty miles was represented. Oconomowoc, Fort Atkinson, Jefferson, Johnson Creek, Clyman, Juneau and towns of lesser note had fair delegations of the music loving.\n\nManager Wertheimer is to be congratulated upon his latest success. WR\n\n1903\n\n03 28PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA ORGANIZED\n\nA new orchestra to be known as the Philharmonic orchestra with William Bethke (*) leader, is being organize in this city and will make its first public appearance shortly after Easter, when it will give a benefit concert and dance. The orchestra will be composed of seven instruments, violin, piano, cornet, clarinet, viola, trombone and traps (**). A good orchestra is one of the needs of a city the size of Watertown and the organization should be helped in every way possible by liberal patronage. A musical organization like the one contemplated can be maintained but in no other way and the fact that it encourages local talent should not be lost sight of. There is plenty of musical talent in Watertown which may be encouraged and this is one way of doing so.\n\n(*) Wm. Bethke was named manager of the Turner Opera House in July of 1904.\n\n(**) A trap set is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, played by a single player.\n\n1905\n\n08 02THACKERS BAND PRIDE OF OUR CITIZENS\n\nAll Recognize Them as Musicians of Proficiency\n\nFree Open Air Concerts Given\n\nOnly Hope of Reward is Appreciation\n\nThat Should Be Most Liberal\n\nThere is no doubt but that our citizens appreciate Thackers band, but we are inclined to the belief, not to the extent the band deserves. All who have heard the band, and we presume that there is not a person in the city who has not, recognize the members as musicians of merit, entitled to consideration because of their proficiency and disposition to favor the public with concerts without other hope of reward than appreciation for their efforts to please and entertain.\n\nWednesday evenings they give free concerts upon Main Street to which all are invited to listen and be entertained.\n\nThe members are all excellent young men, among the best in the city and an honor and credit to Watertown for whom the city should not withhold encouragement and support, which should be of a substantial character. Mr. Thacker, the director, has been indefatigable in his efforts to bring the band up to a high standard of excellence and the members have been faithful in their practice as is evidenced by their playing, which shows that they have been painstaking in their work.\n\nThe members of the band are:\n\nDirector, Frank Thacker\n\nFifes, George Wenck, Chris Oreding\n\nClairinets.

Stube of the Weber-Stube orchestra is playing a violin made by Charles Witte, a young man residing on rural route No. 3. The instrument is that perfect in construction and tone that Mr. Stube has laid his $65.00 instrument aside and is using the one manufactured by the young farmer. Mr. Witte has given of ability as a mechanic. His first attempt was about two years ago, when he made a violin out of a cigar box. Later he contrived an instrument of a rather crude shape, but nearer the perfect. The third attempt was the modern instrument now being played by Mr. Stube. He (Witte) spent some time in studying the rudiments of construction and last winter applied his knowledge to a practical test and the result is that he has an instrument that will demand a good price . . . It is said that Mr. Witte had nothing but crude tools, but nevertheless he has accomplished a perfect piece of workmanship. The violin was left with Mr. Stube to place a value on the same.

Shortly after organizing, the band paraded around Richwood, headed by Peter Thauer, John Scheberle, John Carroll, H. F. Lange and F. J. McCall. H. F. Lange officiated as drum major and F. J. McCall as sergeant at-arms. WG\n\n01 08MORE ON BANDS IN RICHWOOD / OLD-TIME RICHWOOD BAND\n\nTheJuneau Telephone of last week says:\n\nAnd once upon a time, in the dim and distant past, there was another band in Richwood. It was organized in 1869 or 1870, with Prof. John Miller of Watertown as instructor. The band consisted of twelve members, as follows: John Driscol, leader; Jerry Driscol, John Kelley, John Carroll, John McCall, William Hanley, Philip Riley, John Kerr, Henry Bergen, Michael Quinn, James J. Solon and Stephen White. The rehearsals, once or twice a week, were held in the old red school house at Richwood and the meetings were a source of considerable pleasure to the members, as they greatly relieved an otherwise monotonous life. The first time the band attempted to march and play, at the same time, there was a \"parting of the ways.\" The great feat was attempted at a picnic in Adam Schneider's grove. Each player had his eyes glued to his little book and, with red face and bulging cheeks, he proceeded on his journey over sticks, stones and logs. When the \"tune was finished two of the boys were in Norton's marsh, one fell down and the other nine were scattered through the brush, several rods apart. The marked feature of the selection were explosive notes caused by high stepping. Later on, however, the boys learned how to play some and in 1872 came right to the front in the Greeley campaign [Horace Greeley, an unsuccessful candidate for President in 1872]. About the year 1874, some of the original members began to drop out and others took their places. The organization continued to exist until the instruments were sold to theSacred Heart College boys in Watertown about 1877 or 1878. Of the twelve original members, all are living except Bill Hanley, who died many years ago. John Discoll lives in Janesville, Jerry Driscoll resides at Superior . . .

It was pronounced the best and most largely attended band convention ever held in southern Wisconsin. The weather throughout the two days was ideal. Business places and many residences were decorated for the occasion and Main Street presented a beautiful spectacle in its gala attire. The first big event of the convention was the automobile floral parade Saturday afternoon. The bands participating were the T.M.E.R.&L. Cos., Milwaukee; Imperial, Northwestern College and military company, Watertown.\n\nA feature of the parade was the military aspect furnished by the Northwestern College military company in uniform and carrying arms.

The Imperial band will turn out every evening and render concerts on the show grounds.\n\nThis will be one of the biggest efforts ever attempted by the band and should have the support of every citizen.

WG\n\nc.1915\n\n-- --UNCERTAIN OCCASION\n\n1916\n\n08 08SAXOPHONE BOYS GO ON EXTENDED TRIP\n\nThey all love the ladies, except manager Bill\n\nThe Saxophone Concert and Dance orchestra left on Thursday for an extended trip through the West. As the orchestra has played most towns of Wisconsin and Iowa, they will only play a few of the larger cities in these states, thereafter they will work in Minnesota, the Dakotas, Nebraska and other western territory.\n\nThe boys have covered a big territory in the last two years and at every engagement have shown their ability as real musicians. The orchestra is under the direction and management of W. H. Ketelhut, with William Fleuter, solo; George Ryan, alto; Emil Ketelhut, tenor; Arthur Wilde, baritone; Alvin Shissler, drums; Arthur McDonald, advance agent.\n\nMr. MacDonald left several days ago and is arranging bookings through Iowa and the other territory to be covered by the orchestra.\n\nThe boys are looking ahead for a big season as they have a new up-to-date program of the latest dance music, which will surely make a hit. If the music does not, the boys surely will, as they all love the ladies, except manager Bill who plays every night his little tune, Good-bye Girls Im Through. At that he has nothing on his brother, who has played that tune so long that his horn is worn through. He has sent to the factory for a new gold-plated saxophone which he will get on the road.\n\nFleuter, known as Whistle, will lead the new duet waltz, I Can Love the Girl Who Loves a Home, and is in hopes the girls will take notice.\n\nRyan, known as Shorty, with his new baseball game hates to leave his partner Chaw Powers, but Shorty says he doesnt like to howler. That dont count.\n\nWilde, known as Cap, had a steady friend this last vacation while the boys were here. He sure will have a hard time breaking away, but they say absence makes the heart grow fonder.\n\nShisler, known as Red, liked them all but he had a hard time finding one while here, but sure makes the hit away from home. He devotes most of his time on his new xylophone.\n\nMacDonald, the advance man, who is making the path for the boys, is sending back good reports.\n\nThe boys will leave Thursday on an early train making their first stop at Ridgeway. Wis., and from there will work direct west.\n\nIt is hoped that the boys will keep up their good work in booming this city as they have done on their trips. Watertown is proud of the work and the success that the boys have met with. With the bookings that they have made of late it sure looks as if they have struck the road to success and the city is unanimous in hoping that they are never shunted into a side road.The Watertown News\n\n1917\n\n07 16ST. JOHNS INDEPENDENT BAND\n\nBAND BOYS MAKE MERRY AT THEIR ANNUAL PICNIC\n\nThe picnic given by St. Johns Independent band at the Sauerkraut club on Sunday was a success and a most enjoyable affair from every stand point.\n\nEarly in the morning the live wire delegation was on the spot, and preparations were made for the crowd which soon began to arrive. Fishing and bathing were in order, and many of the younger ones of the party pitted their strength against the current in the river which is some stream just now at that point.\n\nEarly in the afternoon, after a splendid dinner had been served in the club dining hall, the quartette led by Pat Diekoff and assisted by whoever took a notion rendered some choice vocal selections. Some of the voices were a trifle rusty but the most of them gave great promise if they had the advantage of training by a good teacher.\n\nSome records were made by expert horseshoe pitchers but it was at fishing that Fred Bittner tied them all. Bittner also led a cross country chase, the hazards including swamp ground, barbed wire fences and ditches. In this contest Pat Diekoff lost by a length by trying to pick a new route.\n\nIn the afternoon, an auto party enroute from Chicago to Madison visited the club.\n\nThe band is composed of the following members: William Bast, Walter Krueger, Ray Brier, R. Grosnick, Otto Nienow, Arthur Block, Ben Maas, Fred Maas, Edward Kohlhoff, Arthur Bast, Arthur Sprenger, Anton Lemke, August Kohlhoff, J. Schiefer, William Thietz, H. Borchordt, F. A.

The orchestra, known as Johnny's Grenadiers, was organized by John Woelffer, son of E. J. Woelffer, director of the 105th Cavalry Band, and Ray Fredrich. They signed up four other young men to complete the organization including Verne Gehler, Myron Hinzmann, Fred Wittchow and William Kehl. Together this group plays a variety of instruments. The orchestra features music of the old-time character but also plays modern music, generally combining the two for an engagement. Tonight the orchestra will play at the Coconut Grove in Madison and tomorrow night at the Modernistic Ballroom, Milwaukee. They have also played at the Schwartz Ballroom in Hartford and other places and have numerous engagements for the near future. The orchestra also plays locally and is open for engagements for dances, parties and social functions of all kinds.\n\n1938\n\n02 15JOHNNY AND HIS GRENADIERS ARE BUSY MUSICIANS\n\nJohnny's Grenadiers, an orchestra composed of local young men, has a long list of engagements which includes dates for dances up to next January 1.

Thursday and Friday nights of this week the orchestra will play for the opening of the new $60,000.00 Turner Hall in Monroe. Other places booked are Rockford, Johnson Creek, Argon Hall at Fish Lake, Doylestown, Elgin, Illinois, Aurora, Illinois, Terrance Gardens and Edwards Park, Madison. The orchestra consists of John Woelffer, violin; Ray Frederick, bass violin; Fred Wittchow, coronet and saxophone; Vern Gehler, accordion; Fritz Bergmann, accordion and piano; and William Kehl, drums.\n\n10 12BABE SHONARTH AND HIS ORCHESTRA WILL GIVE SWING CONCERT\n\nBabe Shonarth and his orchestra of this city will have a swing concert Saturday evening at the \"Swing Jamboree\" which is to be held at the Wisconsin Club, one of Milwaukee's exclusive dancing clubs. This is one of the few bands in this part of the state having a complete repertoire of special arrangements and playing the swing tempo of today. Engagements for this band in the near future include the City Club of Milwaukee, Fisher Body Corp., Parker Pen, Monterey Hotel, Janesville, the Schwartz Ballroom, also some of the large ballrooms in Elgin, Rockford and Waukegan, Illinois. The personnel of the band consists of Paul Hoppe, Wayne Weideman, Robert Kopplin, Marvin Bredow, Herbert Bredow and Babe Shonarth.\n\n1939\n\n11 03JOHNNY'S GRENADIERS\n\nLocal Orchestra Plays Engagement at Dubuque, Iowa.\n\nJohnny's Grenadiers bookings for 1940\n\nJohnny's Grenadiers, well known local orchestra, will play in the Melody Mill Ballroom at Dubuque, Iowa tonight.

The band in the past has been playing with three, four and five piece jobs, but in the future will be booking with six. The personnel of the band includes Eddie Peirick, who plays concertina. He has been playing concertina for 33 years and is considered one of the finest in this area. Very few old time bands in Wisconsin use a concertina in the band, therefore, the group feels that it will add something extra to its music. With concertina, the music can be styled in the Dutchmen swing and sway dance way as most Dutchmen bands from Minnesota use concertina.

The band, with close to 50 members, will be performing in Watertowns Fourth of July Parade this year as a part of its extensive centennial year schedule. As the band performs this summer, parade-goers from all over Wisconsin will be treated to a proud and historic group in action. The bands founders were music-loving German immigrants. In 1885, Henry F. Seeger, a German born parochial school teacher, came to Immanuel Lutheran Church in Lebanon to serve as a teacher, organist, choir director, and instructor of instrumental music for which he received 10 cents per lesson. After five years his teaching had produced enough instrumentalists to form a band in Lebanon in 1890. WDT\n\n1994\n\n07 05YANKEE DUTCHMEN SOLAR POWERED PRECISION MARCHING BAND\n\nPlaying in parades has always been a kick for Will Eske and his mismatched musicians, who are known to scatter in different directions during a drill. Although the official name of the popular band is the Yankee Dutchmen Solar Powered Precision Marching Band, the aim of the group is anything but perfection. Every musician must be in full uniform, and as mismatched as possible. If someone has a hat and coat that match, they must exchange with someone else so the colors dont match, said the genial band director, who usually takes music seriously except during parades where his motley crew is greeted with cheers and encouragement. A T-shirt proclaiming the formal name of the band can be seen through the open uniform tops. The well known 37-year-old band will again march in the citys July 4 parade, just as it has for many years. The event is an important part of the bands schedule which includes 13 parades this summer. We get stacks of requests to play, but we try to stick close to home, Eske said. The Ashippun Fire Department has sponsored the band in the Dodge County Firefighters Tournament for the past 35 years. The event will be held in Lebanon July 31.

J. Woelffer, widely known band leader, died here today at his home, 912 South Fourth street. He had been in ill health for a long time and passed away at 6 oclock this morning.\n\nMr. Woelffer was born in Waterloo on Jan 31, 1890, a son of Mrs. Robert Woelffer and the late Robert Woelffer. He came to Watertown as a boy when his parents moved here and his father engaged in the tavern business. His father was a widely known man in this community for many years.\n\nMr. Woelffer was married on Oct. 1, 1912 to Miss Mabel Riebe. She survives, as do a daughter and a son, Mrs. Donald Snyder and John H. Woelffer, both of this city. His mother also resides here as do a sister, Mrs. Robert Hills, and a brother, George Woelffer. Two other brothers preceded him in death. There are two grandchildren.\n\nMr. Woelffer was associated with the Watertown Memorial Co. He was a member of First Methodist church, Lincoln Lodge No.20, Knight of Pythias, the Plattdeutscher Verein and the Watertown Turner society.\n\nOver the period of years in which Mr.Woelffer was a band leader he had conducted the Watertown City band and the old 105th Cavalry band with which he was associated many years. He also led the band of Branch 120, Catholic Knights of Wisconsin, the K. of P. band and more recently had been the leader of the Lebanon band.\n\nAs a band leader he was a hard worker and a thorough musician, a man with whom players liked to work. He inspired his musicians to their best efforts and was looked upon as a competent leader. In his business affairs Mr. Woelffer was a man who stood for fair dealing and honesty. He had the confidence of his associates and the people with whom he dealt. He was kind and considerate of others. To his family he leaves a heritage which reflects credit upon him as a man and a citizen of the community where his friends were legion.\n\nThe funeral will take place Monday afternoon. There will be a service at First Methodist church at 2 oclock. The Rev. William B. Petherick, who has recently been assigned to Marinette, will conduct the services and burial will be in Oak Hill cemetery.\n\nThe Hafemeister funeral home is in charge of the arrangements. It was not known definitely today whether the funeral will be from the funeral home or from the residence and this will be announced tomorrow, together with the period during which friends may call to pay their respects. In any event, the casket is not to be opened at the church but friends will be given an opportunity to call at either the funeral home or the residence Sunday afternoon and evening and Monday up to the time of the funeral, as soon as it is decided from which place the last rites will be conducted.\n\n< PORTFOLIO OF PICS\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHistory of Watertown, Wisconsin"
