        "text": "Daryl Stuermer Symphony Concert\n\nNov. 17, 2018\n\n7:30pm | Capitol Civic Center | 913 S. 8th St, Manitowoc\n\nSponsored by:\n\nPeter J. Peterson\n\nNash Family Foundation, Dr. Joseph E. & Rhonda Trader, and Mark Barkley Miller\n\nVIP ticket holders are asked to arrive no later than 6:00pm and should bring a camera or phone with camera for the photo op.\n\nParking and directions for out-of-town guests\n\nAbout Daryl Stuermer Symphony\n\nWorld renowned virtuoso guitarist Daryl Stuermer creates a truly unforgettable evening with his newest project, the Daryl Stuermer of Genesis – Symphony Concert.\n\nWith his core band featuring vocalist Woody Mankowski, Daryl Stuermer joins with orchestras around the world to reinvent the Genesis concert experience with his unique renditions of Genesis hits and classics including “Throwing it All Away” – “Invisible Touch” – “I Can’t Dance” – “Turn It On Again” and “Something Happened on the Way to Heaven,” Phil Collins’ 1989 Grammy winning Billboard #4 single, co-written by Daryl.\n\nBursting onto the international music scene in 1975, Daryl toured Europe with critically acclaimed jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and went on to record three innovative albums with him. Since becoming lead guitarist and a touring member of the super-group Genesis in 1978, Daryl Stuermer has toured the world to sold-out crowds with both Genesis and as an original member of Phil Collins band. Stuermer has created the signature lead guitar sound of many Phil Collins mega hits including “In the Air Tonight” and “Easy Lover”.\n\nToday Daryl Stuermer continues to play music with his five piece group, The Daryl Stuermer Band, which truly showcases his unique blend of rock and jazz guitar and continues to expand on over 30 years of musical accomplishments. Between world tours and hit recordings, Daryl Stuermer has released eight solo albums of original music and covers his favorite Genesis tunes along the way on 2002’s “Another Side of Genesis.”\n\nAbout Daryl Stuermer\n\nGuitarist Daryl Stuermer of Genesis and Phil Collins reinvents the Genesis experience.\n\nCelebrating over 30 years of musical accomplishments, virtuoso lead guitarist Daryl Stuermer of the super-group Genesis and Phil Collins has been touring the world to sold out crowds since 1978.\n\nDiscovered while playing with his Milwaukee band, Sweetbottom, guitarist Daryl Stuermer made a fan out of Frank Zappa’s then-keyboardist, George Duke, who set up an audition for Stuermer to try out for acclaimed jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. Stuermer burst into the international music scene, joining Ponty on an European tour and then recording on his four innovative albums.\n\nIn late 1977, Stuermer was recommended as a replacement for longtime member Steve Hackett for the British progressive rock super-group Genesis, beginning his 30 year “permanent part-time stint” as lead guitarist with Genesis, touring the world to sold-out crowds and performing on seven Genesis albums.\n\nWhen Genesis drummer/singer Phil Collins launched a solo career during the early 80s, Stuermer became an integral member of the Collins’ solo band. Stuermer created the signature guitar sound of Collins’ solo mega hits “In the Air Tonight” and “Easy Lover,” and was co-writer of Collins’ 1989 GRAMMY® Award-winning and Billboard No. 4 single “Something Happened on the Way to Heaven.” Stuermer’s versatile jazz work can be heard on nearly all of Collin’s albums (all of which were major hits) including 1981’s Face Value, 1985’s No Jacket Required, 1990’s But Seriously and 1996’s Dance into the Light. In addition, he’s performed on albums by Jean Luc Ponty, Frida Lyngstad (ABBA), Philip Bailey (Earth, Wind, & Fire), George Duke (Frank Zappa), and many others.\n\nStuermer continues to expand on his accomplishments. In between the touring years, Stuermer launched his own independent record label, Urban Island Music, and continues to write music for his nine solo albums—Steppin’ Out, Live and Learn, Another Side of Genesis, Waiting in the Wings, Retrofit, The Nylon String Sampler, Rewired: the Electric Collection and Go! which showcases his acclaimed blend of rock and jazz guitar featuring original music, as well as unique Genesis renditions. Stuermer tours with the“Daryl Stuermer Band” performing in duo, quartet, five-piece and full symphonic shows throughout the world.\n\nFor more information about Daryl Stuermer, please visit www.DarylStuermer.com.\n\nProgram for November 17, 2018\n\nManitowoc Symphony Orchestra\n\nWayne Wildman, Music Director\n\nDaryl Stuermer, guitar\n\nAssisted by\n\nJoe Richter, vocalist\n\nKostia Efimov, keyboards\n\nEric Hervey, bass\n\nAl Arber, drums\n\nMichael Kamenski, conductor\n\nAudio by Steve Fry, Fryed Audio, LLC\n\nLighting by Aaron Zimmermann, Proline Entertainment, LLC\n\nDuke’s Intro\n\nWords and Music by Tony Banks, Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford\n\nArranged by Daryl Stuermer, Orchestrated by M.
