        "text": "Framed by a long, drooping moustache, Paul Rutherford’s crooked front teeth suggested he might have problems being any kind of brass player, let alone one of the most innovative trombonists in contemporary jazz and freely improvised music. A pioneer of multiphonics, in which by singing a note into the instrument as it is being played the harmonic overtones that are produced give the effect of playing chords, Rutherford worked in an extraordinary variety of settings. On one hand he was a capable and resourceful big band trombonist, playing for the likes of Neil Ardley, Mike Westbrook and Charlie Watts, and on the other he was a pioneer of free jazz playing with the Spontaneous Music Ensemble and his own bands Iskra 1903 and Iskra 1912."
