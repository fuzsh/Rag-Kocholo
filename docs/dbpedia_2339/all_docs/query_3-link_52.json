        "text": "On one end of the Madison Square Garden court Thursday night were the words “College basketball’s beginning ...”\n\nIt was an ambiguous phrase on a night that might have ended a once-prestigious phase in the history of the sport.\n\nIn possibly the last game ever played in the postseason National Invitation Tournament, Dayton held off a North Carolina comeback in the second half and defeated the Tar Heels, 79-68.\n\n“Might be a fitting way to end it, for us to win it,” Flyers Coach Brian Gregory said. Dayton also won this event in 1962 and 1968, when it had more prestige.\n\n“Our national brand, in a lot of ways, was built right here,” Gregory said.\n\nMarcus Johnson led Dayton (25-12) with 20 points. Paul Williams had 16. Chris Johnson and Chris Wright each had 14 points and 9 rebounds. Will Graves led the Tar Heels (20-17) with 25 points.\n\nWith college officials seriously discussing an expansion of the N.C.A.A. tournament from 65 teams to 96 teams as soon as next year, the 32-team N.I.T. could further devolve from a consolation event to a mere memory.\n\nNorth Carolina Coach Roy Williams, who led the Tar Heels to the N.C.A.A. championship last season, expressed ambivalence about the possibility of this tournament’s demise.\n\n“There’s a split feeling in my mind,” Williams said. “I don’t know what’s best.”\n\nChris Johnson of Dayton, the most valuable player in the tournament, took nothing away.\n\n“We have heart and character,” he said. “We are a good team and we just won a championship.”\n\nThe first half was played at a spirited pace with Dayton forcing play with speed. With the help of Heels’ turnovers, the Flyers led by 45-32 at intermission.\n\nBut North Carolina started the second half on a 12-1 run that cut the Dayton lead to 2 points, and the margin was the same with 8 minutes 39 seconds remaining.\n\n“We wanted to start cutting down the nets at the start of the second half,” Gregory said.\n\nBut the Heels could not catch up.\n\n“We just didn’t finish the job,” Williams said. “We just could never get over the hump.”\n\nThis week’s event was quite a comedown for the Heels, who beat Michigan State last year for the bigger prize. The Spartans are back at the Final Four this weekend in Indianapolis and so is Duke, North Carolina’s major rival.\n\n“It’s been an unusual year,” Williams said. “This was the hardest year I’ve ever had in coaching.”\n\nThe prestige of the N.I.T. has been crowded from all sides since the tournament began in 1938, a year before the N.C.A.A. tournament. Back then, the Garden had a different address and college basketball had a different profile both locally and nationally. Thursday’s championship was staged before an enthusiastic crowd of 9,827.\n\nAmong factors diminishing the N.I.T. are the growth of the men’s N.C.A.A. tournament, the rise of the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament and the attention for the Big East Conference tournament, also played at the Garden.\n\nThe N.I.T.’s decline also mirrors the slump of the sport in the New York metropolitan area, which once considered itself the epicenter of the college basketball universe. The two most prestigious teams — St. John’s and Seton Hall — failed to make the N.C.A.A. tournament this year and lost in the first round of the N.I.T. Both named new coaches this week: Steve Lavin at St. John’s and Kevin Willard at Seton Hall.\n\nThe official program Thursday showed an evocative black-and-white photograph of the old Garden, 16 blocks north on Eighth Avenue, with fans crowding the sidewalk.\n\nThey mingled below the marquee advertising college basketball, its lights bright. Perhaps some of those lights will now be extinguished forever as the sport moves on from the once-special tournament that helped it grow."
