        "text": "LAS VEGAS — San Diego made just two field goals in the first 39 minutes, 58.4 seconds of the second half against Pepperdine before Wayne McKinney III altered the script in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe junior guard drilled a 3-pointer over the outstretched arm of defender Ethan Anderson with 1.6 seconds left to break a 52-all tie, then retreated to the other end of the floor and intercepted a 65-foot inbounds pass to lock up a victory at the Credit Union 1 West Coast Conference Basketball Championship at Orleans Arena on Friday night.\n\nMcKinney was fouled after his defensive play and sank both free throws to complete a 57-52 triumph could not have been written in a more bizarre manner. The No. 5 seed Toreros (18-14) shot 3-for-24 from the field in the second half and played 20 minutes without making a 2-point attempt.\n\n“The guys trusted me,” said McKinney, who was 0-for-8 from 3-point range over the previous five games and was 1-for-10 from the field on Friday before his game-winner. “It definitely felt good once I let it go. I just had to flush down the past and stick with the moment and trust my training.”\n\nTeammate PJ Hayes had no doubt McKinney was going to deliver. “Just the poise Wayne has to take a shot like that and sink it. To be honest, I knew it was going in as soon as it let go of his hands,” Hayes said. “It’s a poise that we have that kind of developed.”\n\nPepperdine’s Anderson referred to his team’s “incredible” defensive performance in the second half. “We wanted to stay in front of them and make them shoot over us,” he said. \"Even at the end, that was one of two shots (McKinney) made and I’ll be able to live with that.”\n\nPicked last in the WCC by the coaches, USD will play in a quarterfinal game against No. 4 seed Santa Clara (19-12) on Saturday at 7 p.m. The Toreros and Broncos split two games during the regular season.\n\nAfter leading, 34-26, at halftime, then extending their advantage 10 points on a 3-pointer by McKinney with 6:35 left, the Toreros somehow escaped with victory despite failing to score again for more than six and a half minutes.\n\n“We definitely lost some offensive rhythm,” USD head coach Steve Lavin said. “Our defense was the key.”\n\nPepperdine (13-20) shot just 35 percent from the field and had 17 turnovers that led to 18 San Diego points.\n\nThe Toreros won despite the fact that their two top scorers — McKinney and WCC Sixth Man of the Year Deuce Turner — shot a combined 4-for-26. Hayes had 15 points in what Lavin called his best all-around game of the season and Steven Jameson II had eight points and 13 rebounds.\n\nLavin joked that he plans to implement a different second-half strategy when the Toreros face Santa Clara. “Have to get a Bill Walsh scripted first 20 plays,” he said, referring to the late 49ers coaching legend. “When you get to the postseason, it’s a different animal altogether.”\n\nMalik Moore scored 16 points to lead the Waves, Michael Ajayi had 14 points and 15 rebounds and Jevon Porter scored 12 points, but shot just 3-for-11.\n\nThe game marked the end of Lorenzo Romar’s head coaching run at Pepperdine after nine seasons split into two stints. He was given the word early this week that he was being let go whenever this season ended.\n\nHis players delivered a 102-43 victory over Pacific on Thursday but could not extend his run further. Romar, 65, said he’s not sure what’s next for him.\n\n“I’ve been a head coach for 27 years and we’ve had some really good groups but in terms of just people I don’t know if I’ve been around a better group than this group,” said Romar, whose second time around in Malibu last six seasons. “I would like to think some lives were changed as a result of all of us being together these six years. That brings me a lot of gratitude.”\n\nLavin and Romar worked together as assistants under Jim Harrick at UCLA three decades ago, helping the Bruins win the 1995 NCAA championship. They have been friends ever since.\n\nLavin worried that the Waves would be a handful, given both their talent and the emotional factor. “It’s so clear how much they respect and love their coach. That was an element that really concerned me,” he said.\n\nCalling Romar “one of the more influential people in my life,” Lavin added, “That made this game very difficult.”"
