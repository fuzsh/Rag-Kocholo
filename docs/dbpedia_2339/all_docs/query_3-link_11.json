        "text": "Meh. Romar only finished 11th or 12th twice during his entire career at UW, and the 1st time (2015) they simply weren't very good (& had 1 late 2nd round draft pick on the entire roster). The latter (2017) had 1 1st round pick that year + 1 eventual 1st round pick (2 years later in Thybulle), but was among the 5 youngest teams in the country & their best player (Fultz) missed 5 games (all losses). Still, not his best coaching job but that's 1 season out of how many?\n\nThere are 3 elements to coaching IMO - recruiting, communication/motivation & X's & O's, and IMO Romar is a master at 2 of them. With Bone he had all 3. Some of the other coaches on your list were also only good at 2 of 3, so I think you're being a little unfair to Romar by comparison. Especially if you're now adding Braun, who had a losing P10 record in half his seasons including 3 of his last 4, and he finished in the bottom 3 during all 3 of those seasons (twice in the bottom 2). How does he get a pass on those seasons, where he had some very good talent (Anderson, Christopher, Randle), and Romar doesn't?\n\nInteresting list nonetheless. I'd be curious as to how the P10/12's top 10 list over the last 30 years matches up to the other major conferences over that same period?\n\nLOL. We'll agree to disagree. Andrew Andrews was a very good college player THANKS in great part to Romar, who took a 3-star & made him a very good college talent. Picture Lacy. And just FYI, he was never their all-time leading scorer, although he was top 3.\n\n6 NCAA tournaments; 2 Sweet 16s; 4 NIT's over 15 seasons. Took over a program that won 4-5 P10 games a year the 3 seasons prior & took them to the NCAA tourney 2 years later.\n\nNot all great players are great contributors as FR. Having a guy on your team who doesn't become a really good player until years later doesn't make you a team that under performed.\n\nThose 4 years, looked at a different way:\n\n2014 - lost Suggs & Abdul-Gaddy off prior season's team (3 starters overall); added NWG as a FRESHMAN; Wilcox was a very good player, but Andrews wasn't yet. Just OK. Starting line-up included Perris Blackwell & Mike Anderson (1st year JC transfer). Serviceable players, but not top players by any means. Ended up 9-9, tied 8th place, in a P12 conference that sent 6 to the NCAA & 2 to the NIT. Given NWG was still a FR & mistake prone, Andrews still hadn't come into his own, 2 mediocre starters & little to no bench, I think they ended up about where they should have.\n\n2015 - lost Wilcox, added Dorsey who was a non-factor, but NWG & Andrews were better players. Only NWG was an NBA prospect though. Kemp was pretty good moving into the starting line-up, but Anderson & Jarreau not as much. Jarreau lost for a 10-game stretch during P12 play. Ended up 5-13 in P12 play; 16-15 overall. Not his best coaching job, but that wasn't a loaded team either. Definitely not an NCAA tourney team. 7-11 might have been a success.\n\n2016 - lost 4 starters, including NWG. Andrews & JC transfer Dime were the only upper classmen on a roster that ranked 347th nationally in experience. Added a great recruiting class, but 4 of their 5 starters were freshmen. Andrews was terrific; Murray & Chriss had a ton of talent, and played pretty well, but neither were considered 1 & done's heading into the year. Thybulle & Dickerson had their moments but were far from great players. Finished 9-9 in P12, tied for 6th in a conference that sent 8 teams to the tourney. Barely lost in the conference tourney to an Oregon team that went to the elite 8. Given 3-seed in NIT. Given their youth, finishing 9-9 in a strong conference (4th best nationally) isn't that far off. This was the year that was supposed to set up 2017 & more so 2018 when that great class matured.\n\n2017 - lost 3 starters & 4 rotation guys, including Andrews & their 2 best FR - Murray & Chriss. The latter 2 set them back, since they weren't expected to be 1 & done guys. Added Fultz & Simmons, but definitely not enough to offset the 3 key starters. Stayed too young, also ranking 347th in experience. Thybulle & Dickerson were definitely better, but far from all-conference caliber players at this point as sophomore. Crisp is better & decent as well. Fultz carried them, and played like a NBA prospect, but missed 6 of their last games. Finished 2-16, 9-22, and obvious the reason he was let go. Not an NCAA tourney caliber team by any means, but should have done better than 2-16, even with Fultz missing several games late.\n\nNot saying Romar is a brilliant X & O coach, and you can blame him for going down the path of 1 & done's, although Chriss & Murray really were't expected to be. So technically he only recruited 1 - Fultz. Had they stayed & he added Fultz, then anything less than a NCAA bid may have been warranted, but losing them hurt. At no time did he have 2 NBA caliber players playing near that level in the same year. In 2014, while Wilcox was terrific, NWG was a FR & Andrews just a RS Soph & neither were there yet. Not even close. In 2015, NWG was really the only NBA-caliber on the team & he was far from playing at that level as a Soph. In 2016, Andrews was great, but surrounded by young, raw players. Murray & Chriss were draft picks based on potential, not how they played as FR. Few teams have great success when they lose 4 starters & start 4 FR unless you're Duke or Kentucky. Even then, a NIT 3-seed isn't terrible. Finally, in 2017 he lost 2 guys he had hoped to slot in as starters, but added Fultz. Again, not his best coaching job, but 1 guy doesn't carry a team, and Thybulle wasn't a major offensive threat yet. He was the 5th option on that team, taking just 18% of their shots.\n\nTony had 2 NBA caliber players on his 2009 team plus a very good Euro player, arguably as good if not better than some of UW's top players in some of those years, yet went 8-10. And that was a VERY experienced team. Klay wasn't Klay yet - not all future pro's carry college teams as FR, but Baynes was very, very good and Taylor was the \"star\". It happens. Doesn't mean that team underachieved nor does it mean Tony did a bad coaching job.\n\nThe point being Romar had SEVERAL great years, and took a team that was in the cellar of the P10 prior to his arrival (under Bender) & raised them to prominence. \"Stevie Wonder can see that.\" And if you're going to give Braun a pass for his bad years, why not Romar? IMO he's just as viable as Braun. Their resumes aren't that different, and I'd even say Romar's is better."
