Clark came to Keystone from nearby Lackawanna College in Scranton, Pa., a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association, where he was the head coach from 2014-2016.\n\nIn his first season at Keystone, Clark helped lead the Giants to a 7-18 overall record including a 4-14 mark in Colonial States Athletic Conference play. Clark also helped mentor freshman guard Perry Belcher, who earned Honorable Mention All-CSAC accolades following the season.\n\nUnder Clark, Lackawanna reached the semifinal of the Region XIX tournament in back-to-back seasons. He coached and developed three separate Eastern Pennsylvania Athletes of the Week, two First Team All-Region XIX recipients and one Second Team All-Region XIX recipient. In his first two seasons, the Falcons improved in every statistical category, both offensively and defensively. The Falcons concluded their 2015-2016 season with 17 wins. Additionally, Clark saw four of his student-athletes sign to Division II schools in his first two seasons.\n\nClark launched his coaching career at Pace University in New York from 2012-2014, where he was an assistant basketball coach and earned a Master’s of Science degree in Educational Studies. While at Pace, he worked closely with Pat Kennedy, former Head Coach of Florida State University, DePaul University, Towson University and Iona College. Kevin completed various tasks for the Setters, which included player development, individual instruction, player evaluations and the national recruitment of student-athletes. Clark assisted with on-court instruction during practices and games; in addition to the development of scouting reports on opposing teams. He also coordinated team travel arrangements, scheduled games, completed program budgeting, and video coordination.\n\nPrior to Pace University, Clark attended St. John’s University in Queens, New York, where he earned a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Communication Arts and a minor in Business Administration. During 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 basketball season, Clark competed on the Red Storm’s basketball team as a walk-on, under Norm Roberts, and during the 2010-2011 campaign, under Steve Lavin, where earned a full scholarship. In 2010-2011, the Red Storm went 21-12, earning an NCAA Tournament invitation after defeating several different top 25 teams; such as Duke, Villanova, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame, and the eventual 2011 National Champions University of Connecticut. St. John fell to Gonzaga in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nClark was a member of the BIG EAST All-Academic Team during his senior year.\n\nLocally, Clark attended Dunmore High School from 2003-2007. At Dunmore, he was a member of many different clubs and competed on the basketball and baseball teams. In basketball, Clark was a standout athlete for the Bucks, earning First-Team Lackawanna League All-Star honors in his sophomore, junior and senior seasons. Kevin was named Division II Player of the Year in junior and senior seasons, as well as earning a spot on the All-Region team in the Lackawanna League. During that year, he averaged over 20 points and 9 rebounds per game. Clark was also a three time Lackawanna League First Team All-Star for the Bucks as a baseball player."
