        "text": "Steve Lavin (Formerly St. John’s)\n\nPros: He’s relatively young (50 years of age) and accomplished. Lavin boasts a 226–133 (.630) overall record has a head coach and led UCLA to at least the Sweet 16 five times in seven seasons. He spent the last five seasons at St. John’s where he went 81-55 and led the program to two NCAA Tournaments. In his first year there, he transformed the team from a 17-16 squad the year prior to a tournament team ranked in the top-25 at the end of the season. St. John’s made the NCAA Tournament this season as well. Just a few days ago he was negotiating an extension to stay at St. John’s – but talks fell through and the two parties agreed to part ways."
