        "text": "John Wooden was arguably one the best coaches in sports history. His winning record in basketball is one for the ages. Not only was he a leader on the court, he was a leader and deep thinker off the court. We have all had #coaches in our lives to help, guide, bring out the best in us and even #mentor us.
