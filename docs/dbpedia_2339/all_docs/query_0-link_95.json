        "text": "Former UCLA head basketball coach and current St. John’s coach Steve Lavin will receive treatment for prostate cancer in the upcoming weeks, the school announced today.\n\nLavin said doctors caught the condition at an early stage and that he was actually diagnosed in the fall but kept the matter private.\n\n“My family feels fortunate that through annual health exams, we detected my condition at an early stage,” the 46-year-old Lavin said in a statement released by the school. “This past fall I didn’t want to distract our team, but with the season behind us, we are now working with medical experts and taking the proper steps to tackle this health challenge head on.”\n\nLavin went 145-78 in seven years with the Bruins, leading the team to five Sweet 16s in six years before collapsing to 10-19 in his final season, 2002-03, before becoming an ESPN analyst. Lavin rejoined the coaching ranks last season, leading the Red Storm to the NCAA Tournament and finishing with a 21-12 record.\n\nWe invite you to use our commenting platform to engage in insightful conversations about issues in our community.
