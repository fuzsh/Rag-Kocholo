        "text": "Although John Wooden has become synonymous with UCLA's men's basketball, the storied basketball program has had 11 other coaches since the program began all the way back in 1919.\n\nInterestingly enough, Wooden himself even coached the likes of Walt Hazzard and Larry Farmer, who make appearances on UCLA's all-time coaching list.\n\nEach coach had their own specific coaching style, which they relied upon to be successful during their tenure as head coach of the Bruins.\n\nUltimately each coach made their mark by how many wins they accumulated, where they finished in the standings, how many tournament appearances they had, as well as the biggest defining factor: championships.\n\nFred W. Cozens kicks off the list as UCLA's first men's basketball coach ever. He only coached a total of 24 games, but he won 20 of them.\n\nThe reason he comes in so low on the list is because his tenure with the basketball program simply wasn't nearly long enough, in comparison with the rest of the coaches in the school's history.\n\nThe admirable thing about Cozens that needs to be mentioned, though, is that he was also UCLA's first football coach as well and served as the school's athletic director from 1919-1942, which is where he made his biggest impact on the university.\n\nDuring Wilbur Johns' time at UCLA, he was responsible for bringing UCLA to a 93-120 overall record, which comes in last as far as winning percentage goes (.437).\n\nHowever, much like the coach on the next slide, it is worth looking beyond the numbers, rather than taking his record at face value.\n\nIn the 1944-45 season, as well as 1946-47, Johns' UCLA teams both were Conference regular season champions, which certainly counts for something.\n\nHe also became the athletic director at UCLA after his nine-season stint as head coach of the men's basketball team concluded.\n\nWhen compiling this list, I essentially listed everyone based upon their overall records, winning percentages and general contributions in coaching.\n\nOnce I got to Steve Lavin, though, I had to scrap that formula and dig deeper. For those who don't know Lavin and look at his overall record (145-78, a winning percentage of .650), it looks as if he is ranked way too low on the list.\n\nThen you dig deeper and find out embarrassing facts about him, things like the team losing 10-plus games by more than 25 points during his tenure.\n\nNot satisfied yet? Okay, let's keep it going.\n\nLavin was also responsible for coaching the team to it's first losing season in 55 years. We're talking about a truly storied basketball program here.\n\nIf you'd like to continue beyond Lavin's record for a deeper look at why he falls so low on the list, take a look at this article, as it is chock full of examples supporting him being at the bottom of the pile.\n\nOne positive, aside from a winning record during Lavin's murky tenure at UCLA, was his ability to recruit. As head coach at UCLA, Lavin and his staff recruited and signed the No. 1 recruiting class in the country in 1998 and 2001.\n\nLavin signed seven McDonald's High School All-Americans. Seven of Lavin’s former Bruin recruits are currently roster members of NBA teams: Trevor Ariza (New Orleans Hornets), Matt Barnes (Los Angeles Lakers), Baron Davis (Cleveland Cavaliers), Dan Gadzuric (Milwaukee Bucks), Ryan Hollins (Minnesota Timberwolves), Jason Kapono (Philadelphia 76ers) and Earl Watson (Indiana Pacers).\n\nThe Larry Brown that UCLA fans new back then is an entirely different looking coach than the bespectacled, white-haired defensive teacher that fans of today are used to seeing.\n\nOutside of Wooden, he has easily had the biggest impact on the game of basketball as a whole. Although his time with UCLA was short, Brown finished with a 42-17 record and was able to bring them to the NCAA Finals in 1979-80, albeit empty-handed.\n\nBrown was a nomadic traveler during his coaching tenure throughout college and the NBA, coaching for a total of 13 teams including Davidson College, Carolina Cougars, Denver Nuggets, UCLA Bruins, New Jersey Nets, University of Kansas, San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers, Indiana Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers, Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks and lastly the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nHis greatest accomplishment—although not with UCLA—was that he is the only coach to ever win an NBA championship (2004 Detroit Pistons) and a college basketball championship (1988 Kansas Jayhawks).\n\nAs a player in the ABA, he was able to win one as well with the Oakland Oaks.\n\nAccording to one of \"Caddy\" Works' former players, Frank Lubin, \"He was more of an honorary coach with little basketball knowledge than anything else,\" which is one of the reasons he lands so low on the list.\n\nAnother reason being that although he may have coached the second most games in UCLA men's basketball history—second only to John Wooden—his winning percentage was a mediocre .521.\n\nWorks coached UCLA for 18 years, which is a tremendous time to last with a college team, although the above statement about him having little basketball knowledge may make us question why he lasted so long with the team.\n\nOf those 18 seasons, his main accomplishment was that his team won the Conference Regular Season championship for five of his first six seasons as coach of the Bruins.\n\nAlthough Larry Farmer (far right in the above picture) compiled an impressive 61-23 record in his three years of coaching at UCLA, his most notable accomplishments were during his time as a player.\n\nHe was a teammate of Bill Walton's during the era where the team won seven consecutive NCAA men's titles under the legendary John Wooden.\n\nFarmer was with the team from 1971-1973; the team won a championship for each of those years.\n\nAnother apprentice and player under John Wooden, Walt Hazzard amassed a 77-47 record and won his championships during his time as a player under Wooden. He also would go on to play in the NBA for 10 seasons in a reserve role.\n\nAlthough he was unable to win any national championships during his time as coach of the UCLA Bruins, he was able to win the 1986-87 NIT championship as well as the Pac-10 regular season championship that season, and also won the inaugural Pacific-10 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament.\n\nCompiling an impressive record of 52-9, good for the second best winning percentage (.852) in the history of UCLA men's basketball, Gene Bartow coached the team for a short but effective two years.\n\nFor both of his seasons as head coach, UCLA finished as the Conference regular season champions.\n\nAside from coaching for UCLA, he also coached for five other college basketball teams including UAB, Central Missouri State, Valparaiso, Memphis and Illinois.\n\nHis most successful coaching was done at UAB, where he basically built their basketball program by himself. He was recognized for those coaching efforts after the school named its arena, Bartow Arena, in his honor.\n\nBartow was inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in Kansas City on November 22, 2009, along with fellow inductees Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wayman Tisdale, Jud Heathcote, Walter Byers, Travis Grant and Bill Wall.\n\nBen Howland compiled an impressive overall record to date of 182-80 (.695 winning percentage), and is still the UCLA Bruins men's basketball coach to this day.\n\nMost notably is the fact that he has taken UCLA to the Final Four three time's in a row.\n\nIt is also important to note that during his tenure, he has coached a total of nine active NBA players, some of which are the stars of the NBA today.\n\nThe list includes Russell Westbrook, Kevin Love, Arron Afflalo, Trevor Ariza, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, Jrue Holiday, Darren Collison and Ryan Hollins.\n\n\"The Wizard of Westwood\" won 10 NCAA national championships in a 12-year period and coached at UCLA for a total of 27 seasons.\n\nWidely regarded as the greatest basketball coach of all-time at any level, Wooden's words of wisdom reverberate throughout gymnasiums across the country, as he was not just a monumental coach and mentor in the game of basketball, but in life as well.\n\nHis most well-known model proving this is his \"Pyramid of Success,\" which is used even in business as a benchmark for what it takes in order for someone to be successful in any walk of life.\n\nHe was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a player in 1961 and as a coach in 1973; he was the first person to ever be inducted in this honor. Only Lenny Wilkens and Bill Sharman have had this honor since.\n\nMany will also remember that he coached NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton.\n\nWhile doing research on the beloved Wooden, I came across this absolutely incredible video that really gives you an idea of how we will likely never see another John Wooden.\n\nThe man was not just one in a generation, but in a lifetime."
