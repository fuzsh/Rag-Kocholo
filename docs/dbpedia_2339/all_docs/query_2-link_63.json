        "text": "It is universally known that John Wooden was not only the best coach in UCLA basketball history, but is arguably one of the best in all of college basketball -- or in any sport in American history. That is a tough act to follow and though no coach since Wooden has lived up to his legacy, there have been several that have found various levels of success. But when it comes down to it, who is the best since Wooden?\n\nTo properly assess who is the best and subsequently rank them, we looked at the numbers produced from each tenure and the achievements won during that time. We started with an initial score that was the difference between the average number of wins and losses throughout the coach's time at UCLA. From there, we added points based on the number of times each coach achieved a certain goal. One point was given for each AP All-American, one point for each conference Coach fo the Year honor, three points for a Pac-12 regular-season championship (tournament championships were not included as not every coach was afforded the opportunity to play for one), four points for each Final Four, and five for a national championship.\n\nFor example, Walt Hazzard's average wins per season minus his losses came out to 7.5. Add three points for his one regular-season championship and his final score comes out to 10.5. Gene Bartow had an initial score of 21.5. Add two points for two All-Americans and six points for to Pac-12 regular season championships (three points each), and Bartow finishes with a score of 29.5.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the results."
