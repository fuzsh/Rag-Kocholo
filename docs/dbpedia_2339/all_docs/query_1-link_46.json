        "text": "The news conference lasted 13 minutes, and about 12 were spent discussing the future of UCLA basketball.\n\nThere wasn’t much for Dan Guerrero to say about the past except to make official Monday what was assumed for several months, that Steve Lavin is fired as coach after seven seasons.\n\nAlthough Lavin had a record of 145-78 and took the Bruins to five Sweet 16 appearances, he didn’t put up a fuss.\n\n“We met for breakfast and went through the exercise officially,” Guerrero said. “He talked about fresh starts for both of us, the nature of the business and why I had to make this decision.”\n\nThe obvious reason was the decline this season. There was the 10-19 record, UCLA’s worst in 61 years. A sixth-place finish in the Pacific 10 Conference for the second year in a row. A record 10 losses at Pauley Pavilion. The lowest home attendance in 10 years.\n\n“I’m disappointed we didn’t finish with an exclamation point in terms of winning this season,” Lavin said by telephone. “I’m grateful I had the opportunity to grow in the coaching profession at UCLA. It’s an incredible place.”\n\nA new coach, Guerrero believes, is necessary to restore glory to a program that has won 11 national championships but hasn’t been to the Final Four since 1995.\n\n“We’d like to see the UCLA basketball program rise to level of the nation’s elite,” he said. “We’d like to hire a coach to get us to that point. We want a program that offers a level of consistency, gives us an opportunity to get to the Final Four and competes for a national championship.\n\n“I want fundamentals, discipline and defense. I don’t even like us to lose a jump ball.”\n\nIf the coaching job can be characterized as a jump ball, the possession arrow seems to point to Ben Howland of Pittsburgh. He is widely considered the front-runner -- even by other coaches who want the position.\n\nGuerrero said the search will begin today and could last until after the NCAA championship game April 7 because several coaches expected to be under consideration -- Howland included -- have teams in the tournament.\n\nGuerrero, however, said there is no favorite and he has not contacted any candidates, even through intermediaries. Glenn Toth, an associate athletic director responsible for negotiating UCLA’s multimillion-dollar contract with Adidas, will assist in the search, although Guerrero said sportswear affiliation will not play a role in who he hires.\n\nThe qualifications, Guerrero said, “start with integrity. We want someone who has experience, that can build and develop a program, that can compete at a high level nationally, that understands the constraints from an academic standpoint.\n\n“And we want someone who can recruit student-athletes who can succeed on court and in the classroom.”\n\nGuerrero held a brief meeting with Bruin players Monday. They did not tell him who they wanted to see hired, but several said afterward they prefer a coach with an NBA background.\n\n“The guys coming back definitely want NBA experience,” said guard Ray Young, a senior. “Nobody in particular, just an NBA coach who knows what it takes to get there. That’s what most guys who come to UCLA think about -- getting to the next level.”\n\nLon Kruger, successful in several college jobs before lasting less than three seasons with the Atlanta Hawks and being fired last fall, is the only former NBA coach thought to be a leading candidate. He is in the third year of a guaranteed five-year, $12-million deal, so money wouldn’t be paramount. Also, he’s free to interview immediately.\n\nOther NBA coaches whose names have surfaced are less likely. Former UCLA coach Larry Brown of the Philadelphia 76ers, Pat Riley of the Miami Heat and former New York Knick coach Jeff Van Gundy are probably happy to see their names associated with the search, but they don’t seem like the right fit to sources at UCLA.\n\nThe focus is more likely to be on Howland, Mark Few of Gonzaga and Rick Majerus of Utah. Tom Crean of Marquette, Dana Altman of Creighton and Ernie Kent of Oregon also match the criteria established by Guerrero.\n\nThe big fish are Rick Pitino of Louisville and Roy Williams of Kansas, but sources said neither is expected to accept UCLA’s anticipated offer of $800,000 to $1 million a year.\n\nGuerrero will consult 92-year-old John Wooden, who led UCLA to 10 NCAA titles in a 27-year career that ended in 1975. In the past, Wooden has expressed admiration for Williams.\n\nDown a rung on the ladder are Southland prospects such as Brad Holland of San Diego, a former UCLA player, and Pat Douglass of UC Irvine, who worked under Guerrero.\n\nNone of the coaches whose teams are in the NCAA tournament are willing to acknowledge interest. Howland, for example, has responded to repeated questions about UCLA with the same less-than-definitive refrain.\n\n“I’m really, really happy at Pittsburgh,” he said Monday. “I’m not planning on going anywhere.”\n\nLavin, 38, is expected to pursue selected openings, including Penn State, which begins a coaching search today. But he is in no hurry to work, not with a $1.19-million buyout that includes one year at his full salary of $578,000 and four more at $153,000.\n\nIt’s a time of reflection for a coach who handled his departure with class and dignity.\n\n“It will have to be down the road a while before I can be nostalgic or feel the impact of [being fired],” he said. “At this point I am completely at peace with having done the best job possible for 12 years and I’m really looking forward to a future in coaching.”\n\nLavin believes Few or Howland would be the most natural fit to replace him. He wants the players he recruited to be in good hands.\n\n“What I’ll miss most are the relationships with the players on this team,” he said. “And what I enjoyed most was the relationships with former players.\n\n“I am also thankful for my friendships with Chancellor [Albert] Carnesale and Coach Wooden. Those are to be cherished.”\n\nCarnesale reportedly kept Lavin from being fired by former athletic director Pete Dalis two years ago. The chancellor was a key figure in the selection of football Coach Karl Dorrell in December, and he will meet with the basketball coach Guerrero targets before a hire becomes official.\n\nThis is clearly Guerrero’s program, however. In his first year on the job, he has fired football coach Bob Toledo and Lavin. His reputation will rise or fall with Dorrell and whoever becomes the new basketball coach.\n\n“It’s an important opportunity for me,” Guerrero said. “I don’t like to be in a situation where I have to remove a coach. That’s never a positive. But I’m looking forward to the process of hiring the right person for UCLA.”\n\n*\n\n(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nSteve Lavin in seven seasons as UCLA basketball coach:\n\n.650\n\nWinning percentage (145-78 record) -- fourth worst all-time among UCLA’s 11 coaches.\n\n5\n\nRound of 16 appearances\n\nin NCAA tournament, including\n\nmaking the round of eight in 1997.\n\n10-19\n\nRecord this season -- the first UCLA losing season since 1947-48.\n\n10\n\nLosses this season at Pauley Pavilion, four more than any other season.\n\n6\n\nWas coach in six of the 15 worst defeats in school history.\n\n*\n\nLavin Highs and Lows\n\n2002-03 -- 10-19 record, no NCAA\n\n* HIGHS: A 96-89 overtime victory over Arizona in the first round of the Pacific 10 tournament marked the 10th time the Bruins upset a No. 1 team, a national record.
