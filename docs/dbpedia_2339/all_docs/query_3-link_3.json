        "text": "“I’m ready to coach the kids I’ve got,” he said. “The team has played great and the kids are dealing with whatever happened in a real positive way. I just have to wait until the process plays out, and I’m confident that things are going to be OK.”\n\nWhat Jim Larranaga has done at Miami, to not only flash brilliance, but to build it into the culture, cannot be praised enough. Already this year, Miami has won three road games that would have been called “program defining” by the previous coaching staff. And yet, it almost goes unnoticed. Perhaps the greatest sign of progress is not that Miami is able to win games in Gainesville, Durham, and Syracuse, but that none of those wins came as a surprise.\n\nBut what Smart will never do, it's already clear, is leave VCU just to get a bigger job in a bigger league, and money doesn't seem to be a factor, either. He's still very young for his profession and already really wealthy. And with the way he's recruiting at VCU, and with the investment the school has made into the program, there's no reason to think Smart's place in the college basketball world, or his celebrity, will diminish any time soon.\n\nFew coaches have recruited the west coast more effectively in the past five years. Fisher hasn't always landed the top 10 players, but he has consistently found the right players for his system -- unselfish, athletic, defensively minded. Once found, Fisher and his staff must be among the most consistent in the country in delivering their message, their emphases, their style of play. And then those players develop.\n\nYou're almost forced to change. Kids are different. Whoever doesn't think kids are different don't deal with kids. When I started, there were no video games and there weren't cell phones. I thought it was awful when we got pagers. Now look at them."
