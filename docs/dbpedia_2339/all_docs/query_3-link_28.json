        "text": "ROSEMONT, Ill. — St. John’s came to suburban Chicago last January an underperforming team unable to execute down the stretch.\n\nNot much has changed one year later.\n\nThe Red Storm left dingy Allstate Arena on Sunday afternoon, after a tough-to-stomach 71-67 overtime loss to DePaul, 1-4 in the Big East and needing to string wins together to move up the conference standings. It was the case last year, too, after a two-point loss to the Blue Demons dropped the Johnnies to 0-4 in the league.\n\nAlso like last year, St. John’s (12-5, 1-4) had a chance to win late, but Rysheed Jordan’s questionable decision to feed Chris Obekpa rather than take his own shot or find another guard proved to be its downfall. Last\n\nJanuary, it was Jordan setting up Max Hooper for a 3-point attempt that rimmed out when all the Johnnies needed was a two-point basket.\n\nHere is what St. John’s coach Steve Lavin said Sunday: “Chris is playing more confident offensively, but at that stage of the game we would like Rysheed to take the shot or find one of the other players on the perimeter.”\n\nThis is what he said after last year’s loss: “We would’ve preferred to get something in the paint or at the rim in a one-point game.”\n\nOf course, there were other factors that contributed to the dismal loss.\n\nSir’Dominic Pointer, the team’s X-factor, fouled out with 21 seconds left in regulation.\n\nLeading scorer and Big East Player of the Year candidate D’Angelo Harrison was limited by a strained right calf, an injury he suffered in practice on Saturday. Harrison, unable to find a rhythm, made just 2-of-10 shots, scoring 11 points. He offered no excuses and said he would be ready for Marquette on Wednesday at the Garden.\n\n“He gave us everything he had, but it was clear the injury affected his play,” Lavin said.\n\nBut the biggest issue, according to Lavin, was the flat start to the second half, St. John’s blowing an 11-point lead in just 4:06 of game action, allowing open 3-point looks and getting beaten to loose balls. Billy\n\nGarrett Jr. (20 points) found his rhythm after a slow start and was a thorn in the Johnnies side the rest of the way.\n\n“When you go back to the turning point, it was DePaul’s ability to regain momentum at the outset of the second half,” Lavin said. “That’s what I’m most disappointed with.”\n\nIndeed, over the final 13:44 neither team could create separation. There were nine ties and 10 lead changes. With Harrison clearly not at his best — his jump shot, so consistent this year, repeatedly came up short, a sign his legs weren’t there — and fellow senior Phil Greene IV misfiring, Lavin went to Jordan. And he delivered down the stretch.\n\nJordan (17 points, four assists) forced overtime by hitting two free throws with eight seconds left, and he scored four points in a row late in the extra session to pull the Red Storm even. But after Myke Henry (19 points) made two free throws with 13.6 seconds left, Jordan was unable to get all the way to the rim. DePaul converged. So Jordan found the first teammate he saw, the offensively challenged Obekpa, and he badly misfired on a jump hook in the lane with a second to go.\n\n“I just talked to ’Sheed about that,” Harrison said. “You got to make the right play. That’s the right play, but know who you’re throwing it to.\n\n“I’d rather ’Sheed shoot a mid-range jumper, get all the way to the rim or kick out to us.”\n\nEven with Harrison far from healthy, everything was in place for a nice 2-0 road trip after Wednesday’s win at Providence. The Red Storm were up 11 early in the second half before DePaul began sinking 3-pointers from all corners and slightly out-executing Lavin’s team down the stretch.\n\n“It’s a big loss,” Greene said. “Big blow to us.”\n\nInstead of gaining much-needed momentum, the Red Storm are back in neutral. Even the usually optimistic Lavin was short on positives afterward.\n\n“We got a lot of basketball ahead of us and all those other coaching cliches that we say at press conferences after a loss,” he said. “We just got to get better.”"
