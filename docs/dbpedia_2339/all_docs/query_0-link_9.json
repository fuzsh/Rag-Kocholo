        "text": "Nov. 8, 2011\n\nQUEENS, N.Y. - Though there is still no definitive timetable for his full-time return, St. John's head men's basketball coach Steve Lavin attended practice on Tuesday, Nov. 8, his first since his successful surgery to treat prostate cancer. The surgery was performed on Oct. 6 by Peter T. Scardino, M.D., of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.\n\n\"I'm definitely feeling closer to full strength, and eager for a return to the sidelines,\" said Lavin. \"I've been pleased with the progress made by our young team. During this period of recuperating, Coach Dunlap and the staff have worked in an impressive, collaborative manner to prepare our team for the challenges ahead.\"\n\nLavin continued, \"I have been monitoring the team's progress by watching DVDs of practices and games. I have also been in contact via iPhone, text and e-mail with our coaches and student-athletes. Naturally we still have much to do in terms of implementing our system and style of play, but the effort from this team has been outstanding.\"\n\nThe first year of The Lavin Era included a 21-12 overall record in 2010-11, marking St. John's most wins since the 2002-03 season, with six Top 25 victories, four over Top 10 opponents and an appearance in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2002. The USBWA District II Coach of the Year, Lavin transformed a team that finished in 13th place in the BIG EAST Conference in 2009-10 at 6-12 to a squad that tied for third last season at 12-6 - only twice before has a jump of such magnitude occurred in BIG EAST Conference history. The Red Storm finished its season ranked 18th in the Associated Press Top 25, marking the first time it qualified for the postseason as a ranked team since 2000-01. The Red Storm, which posted a 7-1 record in eight regular season games at Madison Square Garden (capacity: 19,353) and a 5-2 record on campus at Carnesecca Arena (capacity: 5,602) saw its home attendance climb by 38.1 percent, marking the fourth-largest increase in NCAA Division I men's basketball."
