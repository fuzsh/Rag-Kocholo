        "text": "College basketball coaches and fans aren’t the only ones not getting much sleep during this NCAA Tournament. Neither is St. John’s athletic director Chris Monasch — and he might have piqued the interest of a grand-slam-caliber candidate for the Red Storm’s vacant head-coaching spot.\n\nAs reported exclusively in today’s Post, the ace up Monasch’s sleeve is former UCLA coach Steve Lavin.\n\nA source close to Monasch said that because Lavin has been working as an ESPN color commentator, St. John’s needed more time to vet him than active coaches, but that Lavin always was a candidate, “of unique interest.”\n\nAfter meeting for more than three hours yesterday with Boston College coach Al Skinner, Monasch was back at the St. John’s coaching search yesterday, interviewing Siena coach Fran McCaffery. It was unclear if Temple coach Fran Dunphy, interviewed yesterday or will interview today.\n\nIn any case, the interest in Lavin — and Lavin’s interest in St. John’s — is heating up.\n\nA confidante of Lavin’s told The Post that he loves his second career in television and only would consider a return to coaching for a special opportunity.\n\nSt. John’s is one of those few opportunities, the source said.\n\n“Steve’s had opportunities to return to coaching and he has a burning competitive side to him, but he’s a unique guy,” the confidante said. “He had a strong Catholic upbringing and has a real fondness for literature and art. His dad was an English teacher at Cal-Berkeley, so Steve’s always felt at home with a campus lifestyle. He’s a basketball junkie with some Renaissance man in him.”\n\nThe only sweeter music to the ears of St. John’s president Father Donald J. Harrington might be the ringing of the bells at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. But before anyone books the St. Thomas More Church on the Queens campus for a Lavin-St. John’s wedding, there are numerous details to be worked out.\n\nCBS erroneously reported during its NCAA Tournament coverage that a deal was done, but as of 10 p.m., there had been no official contact between St. John’s and Lavin. That contact was expected to take place within 24 hours and if both sides remain interested, then they’ll move to contract negotiations.\n\nHarrington recently has returned from Rome and is being updated by Monasch on the search’s progress. Lavin is hunkered down in the ESPN studio for the weekend’s NCAA Tournament games, and also is being wooed by DePaul, a source said.\n\nLavin is expected to return home tomorrow, although he could have an official sitdown with St. John’s, a source said.\n\nGeorgia Tech coach Paul Hewitt turned down the Red Storm and Monasch never spoke to Seth Greenberg, who received a raise and extension at Virginia Tech.\n\nIn the meantime, Monasch is moving ahead with interviews from a group of candidates that include Skinner, McCaffery and Dunphy, and also could include Cornell’s Steve Donahue, Harvard’s Tommy Amaker and Rhode Island’s Jim Baron, whose team is in town for the NIT semifinals.\n\nBut none of those candidates possess the star quality or NCAA Tournament success of Lavin. He went to six NCAA Tournaments in seven seasons at UCLA, advancing to four Sweet 16s and one Elite Eight (1997).\n\nThough he does not have an intimate knowledge of the local AAU and prep coaches, he does have great relationships with current and former coaches, such as Manhattan’s Barry Rohrssen and former Virginia coach Dave Leitao.\n\n“You can’t go wrong with a guy like Lavin,” said one prominent assistant coach who works the metropolitan area. “Just because he hasn’t been in coaching for a while doesn’t mean he’s been out of touch with the Big East or New York City. He knows what’s going on.”\n\nLavin compiled a 145-78 record (81-48 in Pac-10 play) including six 20-win seasons at UCLA. He was fired after posting his only losing record in 2002-03.\n\n“I think the chance to bring a program with the tradition of St. John’s back to national prominence is the kind of opportunity that Steve would embrace,” Lavin’s confidante said. “His dad played at San Francisco, so he appreciates a basketball program’s role at a Catholic university.”\n\nlenn.robbins@nypost.com"
