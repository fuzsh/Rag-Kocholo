Previously in the week, the Dons dominated No. 25 Arizona State from the start on Dec. 21 as USF knocked off the Sun Devils by 37, 97-60, in front of a national audience.\n\nContinuing to make an impact on both ends, Shabazz is now tied for second all-time in USF history with 236 made three-pointers across his career with the Dons. Within the WCC, Shabazz is second in the conference in steals per game (2.2), third in total assists (57), sixth in total points (220) and eighth in defensive rebounds (71).\n\nOverall, USF has tallied at least nine wins in conference play in five of the last six seasons (except for 2020-21), including finishing close behind Santa Clara in fourth place with a 10-6 overall record in WCC action last season.\n\nNotably, the Dons have won three of their last four conference openers, including notching two wins over San Diego to begin WCC play.\n\nSCOUTING THE BRONCOS:\n\nLeading the WCC with 12 wins in non-conference action, the Broncos recorded their second-most wins in program history in the non-conference portion of their schedule, which included impressive victories over Boise State, Iona and Wyoming.\n\nHosting the Dons in their eighth straight home game, Santa Clara is 23-5 at home dating back to the start of the 2021-22 season and are 9-1 at Leavey Center this year.\n\nTransferring from Illinois in the offseason, Brandin Podziemski has been a force in the backcourt for SCU so far as the versatile guard has won WCC Player of the Week twice in the first five weeks of the season. Additionally, Podziemski currently ranks second in the WCC in rebounding (8.7) and fourth in PPG (18.3) entering the matchup with USF.\n\nSCOUTING THE TOREROS:\n\nIn their last time on the hardwood, CSUN (3-8) defeated USD, 83-78, on Dec. 22 in Northridge. Notably, SiguSisho Jawara led the Toreros with 25 points (10-11 FT), including 20 in the second half while Marcellus Earlington totaled 20+ points for the second straight game with 22 points and seven rebounds.\n\nThis offseason, San Diego hired college basketball veteran Steve Lavin to become the Toreros' 14th head coach in program history and the seventh coach since USD moved to the NCAA Division I ranks in 1979-80. Born in San Francisco, Lavin has reached the NCAA Tournament eight times in eleven seasons as head coach at UCLA and St. John's, including five Sweet Sixteen appearances and one Elite Eight appearance.\n\nRetooling their roster, USD brought in twelve newcomers for the 2022-23 season, including the 2021-22 Pac-12 Most Improved Player in Jaden Delaire from Stanford.\n\nSERIES HISTORY:\n\nThursday's meeting between the Dons and the Broncos will mark the 231st matchup all-time between the two programs as SCU holds a narrow 116-114 lead in the all-time series. Notably, USF has won seven of their last eight meetings against Santa Clara, including a season sweep of the Broncos in 2021-22. Overall, the green and gold have also won three straight contests on the road at the Leavey Center.\n\nSaturday's meeting between the Dons and the Toreros will mark the 90th matchup all-time between the two programs as USF currently holds a 49-40 advantage in the all-time series. Aiming to continue their winning streak, the Dons have taken down the Toreros in their previous five matchups, including a season sweep of USD in 2020-21 and 2021-22.\n\nTRACK THE ACTION:\n\nBoth matchups this week will air live on the WCC Network and KNBR 1050 at game time. Streaming, radio, live statistics and ticket links for both contests are available above and via the team's schedule page.\n\nFOLLOW US:\n\nFor updates and more information on the USF men's basketball program, follow the Dons @USFDonsMBB on Twitter, @USFDonsMBB on Instagram and @USFDonsMBB on Facebook.\n\nMERCHANDISE:\n\nWant to dress like the Dons?
