        "text": "NEW YORK — One sign that you've made it in New York City is being recognized by the man in the street. Steve Lavin might soon need a disguise.\n\n\"The FedEx guy is always stopping me in my neighborhood, a big fan,\" the first-year St. John's coach said Tuesday, three days after the Red Storm beat No. 4 Pittsburgh, a victory that moved them into the Top 25 for the first time in more than a decade.\n\n\"He was raving about Dwight Hardy yesterday as if I didn't see the game,\" Lavin said. \"He's just excited about basketball. He'll just jump out of the truck to talk while I'm trying to get my coffee. He's been giving me some good pep talks.\"\n\nNeed another sign you've made it? Text messages.\n\n\"From the time I left the court until I got to the locker room, I had 56 text messages,\" said senior forward Justin Burrell, a former Middletown High player, referring to the last-second win over Pittsburgh. \"From then until I was done with the media it was up to 84. Then when we got ranked I got another 30. It's a good thing I have an unlimited plan.\"\n\nLavin has him beat easily.\n\n\"After the big wins I'll get 400 to 450 texts,\" he said. \"It's pretty consistent of 300 to 350 after a win. After the losses to Notre Dame and Louisville I got six or seven. My sisters text and one of my staff and that's about it.\"\n\nThere's a feeling around St. John's that hasn't been there for quite some time.\n\nSince the 2000-01 season, the Red Storm have had two 20-win seasons and those records can't be found in the media guide since the NCAA vacated 47 wins over four seasons for infractions over off-court issues that resulted in probation and a loss of scholarships.\n\nIn Norm Roberts' six seasons as coach, there were two winning records, both one game over .500.\n\nEnter Lavin, the former UCLA coach who spent the last seven seasons as a TV analyst.\n\nHe took a roster with 10 seniors and introduced an uptempo, pressing game. The 23rd-ranked Red Storm are 17-9 overall and 9-5 in the Big East, considered the best conference in the country. The five marquee wins are over Georgetown, Notre Dame, Duke, Connecticut and Pittsburgh — all ranked in the top 10 this season.\n\nWith the winning comes crowds at Madison Square Garden, the program's second home.\n\nLast season, in seven home games there, the crowd topped 10,000 once. There were four crowds that didn't reach 6,000.\n\nOn Saturday, more than 14,000 people were in the building to see Hardy's underhanded flip with 1.2 seconds left win it.\n\n\"The first time playing in the Garden, I don't know the numbers but it didn't feel like the Garden attendance-wise,\" Burrell said. \"So now we play Garden games and I can't see two empty seats next to each other. That's exciting to have fans there cheering. Before it used to be the opposing team's fans outcheering ours. So this great.\"\n\nHall of Fame coaches Joe Lapchick and Lou Carnesecca were most responsible for the school's 1,720 victories, seventh most in Division I.\n\n\"They pulled a Lazarus,\" said Carnesecca, turning theological and referencing those who rise from the dead. \"These kids have been through the wars. There's a buzz. These kids are the toast of the town and New York was begging for this. It wakes up the whole neighborhood.\"\n\nAn NCAA tournament berth — it would the school's first since 2002 — is pretty much a certainty given the Red Storm's list of wins, strength of schedule (No. 1 in the nation) and RPI ranking (12).\n\n\"When you're losing, everything is dark,\" Burrell said. \"It's terrible to lose. I didn't want to speak to my mother, everything she said sounded bad.\n\n\"Classwork is so much harder, all that stuff. Now, my mom's nice, puts a couple of extra dollars in my account. Teachers are being extra nice. Everyone is smiling a little harder. The campus life is a little bit more fun. Everything is great.\"\n\n(records through Monday's games) Team (national rank) League Overall Pittsburgh (4) 12-2 24-3 Notre Dame (9) 10-4 21-5 Georgetown (11) 10-5 21-6 Louisville (16) 9-5 20-7 St. John's (23) 9-5 17-9 Syracuse (17) 10-6 23-6 Villanova (15) 9-6 21-7 West Virginia 8-6 17-9 Cincinnati 8-6 21-6 Connecticut (14) 8-6 20-6 Marquette 7-7 16-11 Seton Hall 5-10 11-16 Rutgers 4-10 13-13 Providence 3-11 14-13 South Florida 2-13 8-20 DePaul 1-13 7-19\n\nBIG EAST STANDINGS"
