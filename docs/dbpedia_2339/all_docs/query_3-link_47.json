Creighton snapped a nine-game losing streak on Jan. 28 vs. St. John's (77-74), and won for the second time in three games when it defeated Xavier (79-72 in overtime) on Wednesday in Cincinnati.\n\nGuard Austin Chatman (10.8 ppg., 3.9 apg.) leads the team in scoring and assists, while James Milliken (8.3 ppg.) and Rick Kreklow (7.1 ppg.) have come on strong offensively in BIG EAST action.\n\nCreighton is 8-5 this year at home, including a win over then-No. 18 Oklahoma, but 2-7 in true road games.\n\nCreighton returns 11 lettermen from last year's 27-8 team that reached the third round of the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive season. Chatman is the only returning starter from that group.\n\nThe Bluejays are trying to replace the most victorious senior class in program history, as Grant Gibbs, Jahenns Manigat, Doug McDermott and Ethan Wragge combined for 107 wins as well as 5,964 points, 872 three-pointers, 1,062 assists and 2,250 rebounds at CU. All four men are now playing professionally, including McDermott in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls after he averaged 26.7 points per game and swept 14 National Player of the Year awards last winter.\n\nScouting St. John's\n\nSt. John's is 14-8 this season, including an 11-4 home record and a 3-6 mark in BIG EAST play. The Red Storm have lost three of their last four games after spending five weeks earlier this season in the Top 25.\n\nD'Angelo Harrison (18.5 ppg., 5.5 rpg.) leads the team in scoring and is one of the most prolific scorers in the league, having recently surpassed 2,000 career points. He's one of four men averaging in double-figures for the Red Storm, a group that includes Rysheed Jordan (13.6 ppg., Phil Greene IV (12.3 ppg.) and Sir'Dominic Pointer (12.5 ppg., 7.4 rpg.).\n\nShot-blocking force Chris Obekpa (6.8 ppg., 7.6 rpg., 3.4 bpg.) helps pace a St. John's defense that holds foes to 40.0 percent shooting and 65.5 points per game overall.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his fifth season as head coach at Creighton. He is 118-51 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 398-246 in his 21st season and is 267-182 in his 14th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Patrick Sellers.\n\nSteve Lavin (Chapman, 1988) owns a 74-49 mark in his fifth year at St. John's, moving his career mark to 219-127 in 12 overall years as a head coach. He was previously head coach for seven seasons at UCLA, where he led the Bruins to five Sweet 16's. He is assisted by Rico Hines, Tony Chiles and Jim Whitesell.\n\nThe Series With St. John's\n\nSt. John's leads the all-time series with Creighton by a 6-4 count, including a 5-0 mark in New York.\n\nThe Bluejays have won three-point decisions in Omaha each of the last two seasons over the Red Storm, but lost to the Red Storm at Madison Square Garden 70-65 a year ago.\n\nGreg McDermott is 2-1 against St. John's and Steve Lavin, while Lavin is 1-2 versus Creighton.\n\nLast Game\n\nCreighton earned its first BIG EAST road win of the season with a 79-72 overtime victory at Xavier on Wednesday night. Rick Kreklow led five Bluejays in double-figures with 17 points, while Devin Brooks stuffed the stat sheet with 13 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and three steals. Xavier was led by 17 points and eight rebounds from Jalen Reynolds.\n\nWorld's Most Famous Arena A Not So Secret Garden\n\nUntil making four appearances last season, Creighton had never before played at the current version of Madison Square Garden, which opened in 1967.\n\nLast year Creighton lost to St. John's in the regular-season before returning for the league tournament in March. Creighton topped DePaul and Xavier before falling in the final to Providence.\n\nAustin Chatman was one of two Bluejays named to the BIG EAST's All-Tournament Team last March.\n\nFamous Moment, Famous Coach\n\nMadison Square Garden is often referred to as the “World's Most Famous Arena”, and a former Creighton coach is involved in what a 2013 Bleacher Report poll named the greatest moment in Madison Square Garden history.\n\nAfter missing Game 6 with a severe thigh injury, NBA MVP Willis Reed limped out of the tunnel prior to Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to raucous applause. He would start and make the New York Knicks' first two baskets. Though he wouldn't score again, the tone was set and he was named Finals MVP.\n\nReed would later serve as head coach at Creighton from 1981-85, winning 52 games.\n\nWorking Overtime\n\nWednesday's overtime win at Xavier saw Greg McDermott improve to 5-1 in overtime games as Creighton head coach.\n\nThe game was also the 100th overtime game in Creighton's history, as the Jays improved to 55-45 in OT all-time.\n\nIt was Creighton's first overtime win in a true road game since topping Southern Illinois 72-66 in Carbondale, Ill., on Jan. 7, 2011.\n\nIncluding Wednesday, 12 of Creighton's last 13 overtime games have been won by the team to score first in the first overtime.\n\nCreighton has played three overtime games for the first time in the same season since 2007-08. Creighton has not played four overtime games in the same season since 2001-02.\n\nCreighton has not won three overtime games in the same season since 2001-02, something it can do with another OT victory.\n\nA complete listing of overtime games can be found on page 164 of the 2014-15 Creighton Men's Basketball Media Guide.\n\nRare Company At Cintas\n\nCreighton became the fourth visiting team ever to post multiple victories at Cintas Center (which opened in 2000) during Wednesday's win at Xavier, joining Saint Joseph's, Saint Louis and Richmond.\n\nXavier had not lost a home overtime game since December 6, 2012, when the Musketeers fell to Vanderbilt.\n\nCreighton's SWAT Team\n\nCreighton ranks last in the BIG EAST with 57 blocked shots this season, but Toby Hegner, Will Artino and Geoffrey Groselle all have 10 or more swats this season. The league's top shot blocking squad, St. John's, has just two players with 10 rejections or more.\n\nIt marks the first time that Creighton has had three players with 10 or more blocked shots in a season since 2010-11, when Gregory Echenique (55), Kenny Lawson Jr. (19) and Darryl Ashford (27) did it.\n\nSt. John's junior center Chris Obekpa owns 74 blocks this season and 301 in his career, or 103 more than Creighton's entire team (198) in the past three seasons.\n\nBetter, Together\n\nCreighton had five men score 12 points or more on Wednesday at Xavier, as Rick Kreklow (17 points), Geoffrey Groselle (15), Devin Brooks (13), Austin Chatman (12) and James Milliken (12) all reached double-figures.\n\nIt was the first time since Creighton's season-opening Nov. 14 win over Central Arkansas with five men in double-figures.\n\nCreighton is 3-0 this season when four or more players score in double-digits, and a perfect 20-0 since the start of the 20-0 season when at least four players have 10 points or more.\n\nAll-time under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 39-6 when four or more men reach double-figures.\n\nAgainst The Best\n\nThrough games of February 4th, Creighton was tied with BIG EAST foe Butler for the national lead with 12 games this season against Top 50 RPI teams.\n\nThe three teams to face 11 Top 50 teams were Kansas, Oklahoma and BIG EAST foe Marquette.\n\nCreighton is 3-9 in its games vs. Top 50 competition, with wins over St. John's, Xavier and Oklahoma this winter.\n\nSwiss Army Knife\n\nDevin Brooks continues to do a little bit of everything for Creighton this season.\n\nHe leads Creighton in rebounding and steals, and is second on the team in assists.\n\nIf it holds, Brooks could join Kyle Korver (2002-03) as the only Bluejays to lead the team in rebounding and steals in the same season.\n\nBrooks had his best game of the season on Wednesday at Xavier, finishing with 13 points, 12 rebounds, six assists, three steals and a blocked shot in an overtime victory. Besides being his first career double-double, the 12 rebounds were a career-high while his six assists tied a personal best.\n\nBrooks is one of six Creighton players with a double-double and six or more assists since 1986-87. Of those six, Brooks is the only one that had 12 rebounds or more in such a game, and also the only one that had three steals or more in his special game.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Benoit Benjamin is the only player in Creighton history to post a triple-double, and all three of those were of the points/rebounds/blocks variety.\n\n10+ Pts, 10+ Reb, 6+ Assists In A Game, Since 1986-87\n\nName, Opponent Pts.

The streak is the 24th-longest active streak, though Feb. 4th.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nThanks to help from STATS Inc., and various SID's, below is a list of the nation's longest active three-point steaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (through 2/4)\n\nRk.

It's worth noting that Lavin missed much of his second season in Queens due for health-related reasons.\n\nMcDermott leads that group with 118 victories to easily lead that group. It's five more than the man he replaced at Creighton, current Oregon coach Dana Altman, and 11 more than the coaches with the third-most wins, through games of Feb. 1.\n\nHead Coaches Hired Prior to 2010-11, Sorted By Wins\n\nSchool Coach Total W Total L\n\nCreighton Greg McDermott 118 51\n\nOregon Dana Altman 113 53\n\nIona Tim Cluess 107 51\n\nIowa State Fred Hoiberg 106 52\n\nColorado Tad Boyle 102 60\n\nConsistent Conference Excellence\n\nAccording to research by Norfolk State SID Michael Bello, Creighton's streak of 19 straight years of a .500 mark or better in conference play ranks tied for seventh-longest among active streaks nationally. To extend the streak, Creighton (2-9) must win its final seven league contests.\n\nBIG EAST rival Xavier, currently 5-6 in league action, leads that list with 32 straight such seasons.\n\nConsecutive Seasons, .500 or Better in League Play\n\nRk.

Creighton's 39 wins at home in that time are tied for second-most in the league, one behind Villanova.\n\nTeam Home W-L Since 2012-13\n\nVillanova 40-5\n\nCreighton 39-7\n\nGeorgetown 39-7\n\nProvidence 38-9\n\nXavier 37-7\n\nMarquette 36-9\n\nSt. John's 36-14\n\nButler 33-10\n\nSeton Hall 29-17\n\nDePaul 24-23\n\nWho To Defend?\n\nAvery Dingman had a club-high eight points last Saturday vs. Georgetown, becoming the 10th different leading scorer this season for the Bluejays.\n\nCreighton's top two scorers in non-conference play, Austin Chatman and Isaiah Zierden, currently rank third and ninth on the team in points per game in league action.\n\nCreighton's top two scorers in BIG EAST action, James Milliken and Rick Kreklow, were sixth and eighth, respectively, on the team in scoring in non-conference play.\n\nWhat's Your 20?\n\nCreighton has 11 men on its roster who have started five or more Division I games if you include redshirting transfers Cole Huff and Mo Watson Jr.\n\nOf those 11, nine of them own at least one career game of 20 points or more, including five men this season (James Milliken, Austin Chatman, Toby Hegner, Will Artino, Isaiah Zierden).\n\nThe last time Creighton had five different players score 20 or more points in the same season was 2010-11, when Antoine Young, Doug McDermott, Kenny Lawson Jr., Ethan Wragge and Josh Jones did it.\n\nThe only active Bluejays with five Division I starts or more who have yet to reach the 20-point plateau are Rick Kreklow (high of 18) & Zach Hanson (11).\n\nOpponents Coming In After A Loss\n\nWhen Creighton visits St. John's on Saturday, the Red Storm will be licking their wounds after a mid-week defeat at Butler.\n\nSince opening league play against Providence, 10 of Creighton's last 11 BIG EAST opponents will have lost the game prior to facing the Bluejays, with three each losing to both Xavier and Georgetown.\n\nCU Opponent Game Before\n\nGeorgetown Lost at Xavier by 17\n\nDePaul Beat Xavier by 3\n\nSeton Hall Lost at Xavier by 11\n\nMarquette Lost at Georgetown by 6\n\nProvidence Lost to St. John's by 13\n\nButler Lost at Georgetown by 2\n\nVillanova Lost at Georgetown by 20\n\nSt. John's Lost to Duke by 9\n\nGeorgetown Lost to Xavier by 13\n\nXavier Lost at Seton Hall by 8\n\nSt. John's Lost at Butler by 23\n\nMore Than 3,000,000 Served\n\nCreighton surpassed the 3 million fan mark at CenturyLink Center Omaha last Saturday when it hosted No. 21 Georgetown.\n\nTo date, Creighton has attracted 3,010,823 fans in 199 games to date at the 12-year-old facility, an average of 15,130 fans per game.\n\nCreighton's 1,000,000th fan at CenturyLink Center Omaha was honored on Jan. 19, 2008, in CU's 74th game at the facility. That fan, Jared Stickrod, was then a 10-year old from Omaha who received numerous prizes, including an autographed basketball and season tickets for the 2008-09 campaign.\n\nCreighton surpassed the 2,000,000 fan mark at CenturyLink Center Omaha in its 141st game at the facility on Dec. 4, 2011 vs. Nebraska. Sam King was the fan selected as No. 2,000,000 and received a haul of prizes that includes four season tickets for 2012-13.\n\nPapillion native Drew D'Ercole was recognized as the 3,000,000th fan on Saturday received the following prize package:\n\n-Two 2015-16 MBB season tickets\n\n-Private Championship Center tour\n\n-Honorary Guest for the 2/14 Marquette Game & locker room tour\n\n-Doug McDermott & Kyle Korver Bobbleheads\n\n-Apparel Items\n\n-Autographed Memorabilia\n\n-$300 in gift cards\n\n-Appearance on video board during game\n\nSome Loyal Fans\n\nCreighton has attracted 221,501 fans at home this season, the 10th straight season it has surpassed 200,000 fans at home.\n\nCreighton had never attracted more than 141,000 home fans in any season prior to the opening of CenturyLink Center Omaha, and now has done it in 12 straight seasons.\n\nCreighton has led its conference in home attendance in all 12 years since moving into CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\n21, By A Freshman\n\nToby Hegner's 21 points vs. St. John's on Jan. 28 were the most by a Creighton freshman since Doug McDermott had 21 vs. Oregon on March 28, 2011, and the most by a freshman reserve since Ethan Wragge had 21 points vs. Xavier on Nov. 27, 2009.\n\nThe scoring binge of 21 points came in his first game as a reserve after he had started the first 21 games of his Creighton career.\n\nMonth Of Ranked Teams\n\nNo. 21 Georgetown marked the fourth ranked team that Creighton played in January, more than any other month in program history.\n\nCombined with a Jan. 10 game vs. No. 19 Seton Hall, it also marked the first time since January of 1979 that Creighton hosted two top-25 foes in the same month.\n\nBench Matches Up\n\nCreighton scored 44 bench points in its Jan. 28 win over St. John's, its most since scoring 54 in a double-overtime non-conference win over South Dakota in December.\n\nThe 44 points were Creighton's most ever in a BIG EAST game, and most in any league game since scoring 45 points off the pine vs. Drake on Jan. 8, 2013.\n\nMaking The Best of Charity\n\nDespite its perimeter shooting woes, Creighton has done a solid job at the free throw line this season. The Bluejays lead the BIG EAST with 74.8 percent marksmanship from the charity stripe.\n\nThe figure ranks 16th-best nationally, and is on pace to be Creighton's sixth-best mark in a single-season since the category was kept in records that date to 1951-52.\n\nSlow Starts An Issue\n\nCreighton consistently has fallen behind early in games during its league play, including a 9-0 deficit to Georgetown last Saturday, a 15-0 deficit at Villanova on Jan. 25, 16-6 at Butler on Jan. 21 and 12-2 to Providence on Jan. 17.\n\nBelow is a list of how long it has taken Creighton to fall behind by double-figures for the first time in some of its recent games\n\nDouble-Digit Deficit Time Left Lost By\n\nNever fell behind by more than 7 at Xavier (Won)\n\n12-2 to Georgetown 15:34 (1st half) 27\n\nNever fell behind by more than 4 vs. St. John's (Won)\n\n11-0 at Villanova 14:50 (1st half) 21\n\n16-6 at Butler 10:23 (1st half) 3\n\n12-2 vs. Providence 16:01 (1st half) 9\n\n21-11 at Marquette 8:00 (1st half) 1\n\nNever fell behind by more than 7 vs. Seton Hall 1\n\n12-2 to DePaul 17:18 (1st half) 10\n\n54-44 at Georgetown 11:37 (2nd half) 15\n\n14-4 at Providence 14:04 (1st half) 12\n\n20-10 at North Texas 7:23 (1st half) 4\n\nMoving On Up\n\nAustin Chatman has moved into fifth in Creighton history on the career assist chart, and now owns 466 in his career.

The Blue Demons have eight such players.\n\nQuest For 15,000 Complete\n\nCreighton has scored 15,069 points all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha, surpassing 15,000 points on Jan. 28 on a second half free throw by Zach Hanson.\n\nCreighton has currently outscored the opposition 15,069 to 12,709 at the 12-year old facility.\n\nCreighton is 14-1 all-time in games where it moves over any 1,000 point milestone at CenturyLink Center Omaha, as seen below:\n\nDate Pts-Opp (CLCO Game #) Who/How vs. Opp.\n\n02/18/04 1,000-787 (14) Lindeman FG vs. Indiana State\n\n02/05/05 2,000-1,696 (28) Funk FG vs. Missouri St.\n\n01/18/06 3,000-2,504 (41) Watts FT vs. Bradley\n\n01/09/07 4,000-3,359 (56) Tolliver FG vs. Drake\n\n12/17/07 5,000-4,174 (69) Ka.

Those four losses featured eight shot attempts in the final minute that could have tied the game or put the Bluejays ahead, all but one of which were missed.\n\nBefore that bad luck stretch, Creighton's senior class had been 16-4 in games decided by four points or less amongst the 118 contests it had played since the start of the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nThis season Creighton is 3-5 in games decided by four points or less.\n\nGames Decided By 4 Points Or Less Under McDermott\n\nW-L Year\n\n2010-11 2-6\n\n2011-12 8-1\n\n2012-13 3-2\n\n2013-14 3-0\n\n2014-15 3-5\n\nTechnically Speaking\n\nGreg McDermott was issued a rare technical foul when the officials booked the Creighton head coach on Jan. 17 vs. Providence.\n\nIt was the first technical foul that McDermott had been whistled for in five years on the Bluejay sideline, and his first overall since Feb. 17, 2010 when he was head coach at Iowa State. In between, McDermott coached 153 games without one.\n\nSome other facts about the technical foul...\n\n-Greg McDermott had two technical fouls in his four seasons as Iowa State head coach and five technical fouls in five years as head coach at Northern Iowa.\n\n-It was the first technical foul on the Creighton bench in a home game since Dana Altman was given one vs. Drexel on Feb. 17, 2007, and just the second one since Jan. 13, 2000 at home on the CU bench.\n\n-It was Creighton's first technical foul since Grant Gibbs had one on Feb. 6, 2013 at Indiana State. Creighton had played 65 complete games since its last technical.\n\n-It was just the ninth technical foul Creighton has been called for in five seasons under Greg McDermott. Gregory Echenique had three, Grant Gibbs had two, and there's been one each for Avery Dingman, Will Artino, and the Bluejay bench (Steve Lutz).\n\nPink Out Auction Raises Thousands\n\nAs part of the nationwide American Cancer Society Coaches vs. Cancer event, men's basketball fans were encouraged to wear pink to promote cancer awareness and participate in the “Creighton vs. Cancer Pink Out” game when the Bluejays hosted Providence on Jan. 17.\n\nBluejay players wore pink shooting shirts and pink jerseys for the game and, like last year's event, fans had the opportunity to honor a friend or family member who has battled cancer or is currently battling cancer by purchasing the apparel via auction (the shooting shirt can be personalized – last name, nickname, etc.).\n\nThe first 16,000 fans entering the venue last Saturday received a complimentary pink t-shirt courtesy of CHI Health and Methodist Estabrook Cancer Center.\n\nThis year's Creighton vs. Cancer jersey auction raised $16,384.03, and the past four seasons have seen $109,675.14 raised. Past auctions have raised $20,600 (2012), $24,444 (2013) and $48,247.11 (2014).\n\nBelow is a list showing what each item sold for:\n\nJersey #1 $2651 Jersey #2 $650\n\nJersey #4 $455 Jersey #5 $1,527\n\nJersey #10 $585 Jersey #11 $506\n\nJersey #15 $630 Jersey #21 $955\n\nJersey #22 $960 Jersey #23 $590\n\nJersey #31 $725 Jersey #32 $826\n\nJersey #40 $730 Jersey #41 $610\n\nJersey #50 $710 D.

The mark is the program's highest figure in records dating back to 1999.\n\nTwo men's basketball players, Tyler Clement and Gabriel Connealy, have owned perfect 4.00 GPA's throughout their entire college career.\n\nOverall, Creighton's student-athletes owned a 3.37 GPA in the fall, also a record. Of CU's 279 student-athletes, 126 of them (45.2 percent) made the Dean's List (3.50 or better).\n\nHow's This, For Starters?\n\nJames Milliken scored a team-high 20 points in the Jan. 10 game vs. Seton Hall, the second time this season he's scored 20 or more.\n\nMilliken was the ninth different leading scorer that Creighton had in its first 17 games this winter.\n\nMilliken had his outburst in his first career start, as he became the first Bluejay since Booker Woodfox to score 20 or more in his first career start. Woodfox had 26 points vs. New Mexico on Nov. 16, 2008, the start of a season that saw him earn MVC Player of the Year accolades.\n\nThe only other players to do so since the 1994-95 season have been Kellen Miliner (20 vs. Alcorn State on Nov. 15, 2004), Nerijus Karlikanovas (20 at Missouri State on Jan. 10, 1999).\n\nClement Steps Up\n\nTyler Clement played 62 minutes in Creighton's first 16 games, before the redshirt freshman walk-on logged a career-high 26 minutes on Jan. 10 vs. Seton Hall.\n\nClement dished a career-high four assists and added two rebounds, one point and one steal while subbing for an injured Austin Chatman.\n\nClement checked in for the first time with 8:59 left in the first half, then played all but 2:53 of the remainder of the contest.\n\nIt's not the first time that Clement has come to the rescue for Creighton this season. He replaced a foul-prone Chatman with CU down 24 points at North Texas and 15:56 left. Creighton would eventually lose by four points, with Clement playing 12 minutes during that frantic comeback attempt.\n\nArtino Doubles His Fun\n\nSenior center Will Artino has started CU's last six games and on Jan. 10 vs. Seton Hall delivered his third career double-double with 14 points and a career-high 11 rebounds while also playing a career-best 35 minutes.\n\nIt was Artino's team-high second double-double of the winter.\n\nArtino has made 61.1 percent of his career field goal attempts. That's the second-best mark in Creighton history among players with 300 or more career attempts.\n\nPct.

The fans are very friendly and will welcome opposing fans. The band, the dance team, the cheerleaders are all good and add to the college experience. The contests held during breaks in the action add to the fun and they command the attention of most of the fans.”\n\nRk. Facility Home Hoops Tenant\n\n30. Rupp Arena Kentucky\n\n35.

Smith Center North Carolina\n\nOne Of The Best Leagues Around\n\nThe BIG EAST Conference was the second-ranked league in the RPI ratings through games of January 29 through WarrenNolan.com, confirming the developing consensus that the league is once again powerful. Noted bracketologist Joe Lunardi has six BIG EAST teams in his latest projection, with St. John's among his “next teams out”.\n\nAccording to CBS Sports, no league has had more NCAA Tournament bids in the last three seasons than the 21 earned by the BIG EAST.\n\nBelow is a list of the top 10 leagues, through games of February 4th:\n\nRk. Conference RPI\n\n1. Big 12 .5980\n\n2. BIG EAST .5848\n\n3. Atlantic Coast .5765\n\n4. Big Ten .5726\n\n5. Southeastern .5694\n\n6. Pacific 12 .5670\n\n7. Atlantic 10 .5387\n\n8. American Athletic .5311\n\n9. West Coast .5261\n\n10. Missouri Valley .5180\n\nTrey Troubles\n\nCreighton has made 23-of-54 three-pointers (42.6 percent) in its BIG EAST victories this season, but just 56-for-195 (28.7 precent) from deep in its league losses.\n\nFor the season Creighton is shooting 33.5 percent from three-point land.\n\nIn the last four years under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 36-29 (.554) when shooting 40.00 percent or worse from three-point range. While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 59-6 (.908) mark the last four years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 84-16 in the past four years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 11-19 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nLast season, Creighton led the nation with 41.4 percent shooting from deep, a figure that ranked ahead of 43 teams overall field goal percentage nationally.\n\nConsistent Challengers\n\nLast year's Creighton team finished second in the BIG EAST, the 17th straight season the Bluejays have finished in the top four of the league standings. Including last year, 12 of Creighton's last 17 teams have finished either first or second the regular-season race of league play. Two of the five that didn't won the MVC Tournament.\n\nThe Bluejays won the MVC in 2000-01 and 2012-13, tied for the title in 2001-02 and 2008-09. CU was second in the MVC in 1997-98 and 2006-07 and second last year in the BIG EAST, tied for second in the MVC in 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2005-06, and finished tied for third in 2004-05. The 1999-00 club was fourth in the MVC, but won the MVC Tournament, while the 2010-11 club tied for fourth place.\n\nCreighton's League Finishes, Previous 17 Years\n\n1st Place 2000-01, 2012-13 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for First 2001-02 (won MVC Tourn.), 2008-09\n\n2nd Place 1997-98, 2002-03 (won MVC Tourn.),\n\n2006-07 (won MVC Tourn.), 2011-12 (won MVC Tourn.), 2013-14\n\nTied for 2nd 1998-99 (won MVC Tourn.), 2003-04, 2005-06\n\nTied for 3rd Place 2004-05 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\n4th Place 1999-00 (won MVC Tourn.); 2007-08; 2009-10\n\nTied for 4th Place 2010-11\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to finish ninth in its second season as BIG EAST Conference members according to a preseason poll of league coaches. Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Georgetown (67, 1), St. John's (65), Xavier (52) and Providence (49) round out the top half. The predicted lower half was Seton Hall (43), Butler (28), Marquette (28), Creighton (25) and DePaul (12).\n\nThe ninth-place prognostication is the program's lowest mark since being tabbed 10th of 11 Missouri Valley Conference teams in 1995-96. That team tied for fifth in The Valley. It also snaps a streak of 14 straight years being picked fourth or higher in its preseason league poll.\n\nCreighton did not have any honorees on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Teams, which was led by Preseason Player of the Year D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera from Georgetown.\n\nThis marks the first time since 2009-10 that Creighton has not had the Preseason Conference Player of the Year. It's also just the sixth time in the last 20 years that Creighton did not have a first team all-conference honoree in the preseason.\n\nEarly Birds Get The Win\n\nWhen Creighton's offense gets rolling under Greg McDermott, the results have been evident. Creighton has won 50 straight games under McDermott when scoring 40 or more points in the first half.\n\nCU has also won 68 straight home games when scoring 40 or more points in the first half dating to a Feb. 3, 2002 loss to Southern Illinois, including a perfect 60-0 mark at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nGroselle Makes The Leap To MBA\n\nRedshirt junior center Geoffrey Groselle finished the requirements to earn his undergraduate degree in Financial Analysis in just 3.5 years on December 18th. One day later, he learned that he'd been accepted into Creighton's MBA program, then came out that night and grabbed a career-best six rebounds in 11 first half minutes.\n\nGroselle continued his strong play on Dec. 21 at North Texas, scoring 10 points on 4-of-5 shooting.\n\nHe led Creighton with 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting in the league opener at Providence, playing a 22 minutes. Groselle made his first career start in the Jan. 3 game at Georgetown.\n\nGroselle had a career-high seven rebounds and tied his high with 15 points on Feb. 4 at Xavier while seeing a career-best 26 minutes of clock time.\n\n3-Headed Monster\n\nCreighton has used three men who alternate playing time at the “5” position for most of this season, Will Artino, Zach Hanson and Geoffrey Groselle.\n\nWhile none of them have stats that might jump off the page individually, as a collective group they're tough to beat, combining for 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds in 37.7 minutes per game, all while shooting 57.4 percent from the floor.\n\nName MPG FG-FGA RPG PPG\n\nArtino 15.9 58-112 4.2 5.8\n\nHanson 14.1 43-73 3.0 5.0\n\nGroselle 10.3 38-57 2.0 4.2\n\nTotal 37.7 139-242 8.6 14.0\n\nToughest Thing In Sports\n\nCreighton is 26-19 in true road games the last four years, and 42-26 when you also include neutral site games.\n\nLast year's team was 7-4 in true road games and 4-4 at neutral sites. Each of Creighton's last 11 NCAA Tournament qualifiers have had 10 or more road/neutral wins.\n\nCreighton is currently 2-7 in true road games this season, and 3-8 away from home when you factor in a pair of games in Niceville, Fla., during the Emerald Coast Classic.\n\nWill The Thrill\n\nWill Artino leads Creighton in rebounds per 40 minutes (10.6 rpg.) and is third in points per 40 minutes (14.6 ppg.) this season.\n\nAmong players to play 100 or more minutes in any season during Greg McDermott's tenure, Artino has consistently put up big numbers.\n\nIn those five seasons, a player has averaged at least 10.0 rebounds per 40 minutes nine times, with Artino accounting for four of those seasons.\n\nMost Rebounds Per 40 Minutes, Since 2010-11\n\n(Minimum 100 minutes, Season)\n\nREB/40 Name Year\n\n12.4 Will Artino 2012-13\n\n12.2 Gregory Echenique 2011-12\n\n11.9 Will Artino 2011-12\n\n11.6 Gregory Echenique 2012-13\n\n11.3 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2010-11\n\n10.6 Will Artino 2014-15\n\n10.3 Doug McDermott 2011-12\n\n10.2 Gregory Echenique 2010-11\n\n10.0 Will Artino 2013-14\n\nHigher and Higher\n\nAustin Chatman entered December with a career-high of 19 points, but in seven December contests he averaged 17.3 points, including five games of 19 or more.\n\nChatman tied his career-high with 19 points in road games against both Tulsa and Nebraska, then upped the ante with 24 points in a Dec. 9 double-overtime win over South Dakota.\n\nAll 24 of his points against the Coyotes came in the final 16 minutes of regulation and the overtime sessions.\n\nOf Creighton's 26 points during the overtime, Chatman made or assisted all six field goals, and also drained five of the team's 10 free throws.\n\nHe followed that up with another 19 point effort against Saint Mary's on Dec. 14, then threw in 20 more points vs. Texas-Pan American on Dec. 19.\n\nAwesome Austin\n\nAustin Chatman had identical stat lines in two games to start the month of December. In road games at Tulsa and Nebraska, Chatman had exactly 19 points, seven rebounds and six assists in both games.\n\nBefore Chatman, the last time a Creighton player had any game with at least 19/7/6 or more in each category was Ryan Sears at Southern Illinois on Jan. 8, 2000.\n\nBefore Chatman, Creighton's last player with two games of 19/7/6 in the same season was Rodney Buford, who did it in 1998-99.\n\nChatman also became the first Creighton player to own at least a share of the team in lead in points/rebounds/assists in consecutive games since Kyle Korver on Dec. 7 & 14, 2002.\n\nChatman was also stellar in the win over South Dakota on Dec. 9, finishing with 24 points and eight rebounds. In the process, he became the first Bluejay with 24 points and eight assists in the same game since Sears in the same Jan. 8, 2000 game listed above.\n\nThrough games of February 4th, Chatman was one of 12 players nationally, and one of three seniors with at least 259 points, 90 rebounds and 94 or more assists.\n\nCareful Chatman\n\nAustin Chatman owns a 94/42 assist/turnover ratio (2.24) this season, a figure that ranks sixth in the BIG EAST and 76th nationally.\n\nLast season Chatman finished third in the BIG EAST with a 2.6 assist/turnover ratio, good for 29th nationally.\n\nFor his career, Chatman owns 466 assists compared to 219 turnovers, good for a 2.13 ratio. The man considered by many to be Creighton's best point guard in recent history, Ryan Sears, finished his career with a 2.26 assist/turnover ratio.\n\nMore Success At Home\n\nCreighton has won 85 straight home games against teams that enter with a record of .500 or worse. The last team to upset the apple cart was Feb. 25, 2002, when Drake won at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nSenior Trio Joins Elite Group\n\nSeniors Will Artino, Austin Chatman and Avery Dingman joined some elite company with Creighton's Dec. 7 win at Nebraska, as the trio became the rare Bluejay players to appear in four wins vs. Nebraska.\n\nCreighton's only previous six men to play in four career wins over the Cornhuskers were Kyle Korver, Joe Dabbert, Mike Grimes, Michael Lindeman, Tyler McKinney and Ethan Wragge.\n\nOf those six, only Korver and McKinney had never played in a loss against NU, something Dingman, Artino and Chatman can now claim.\n\nHalftime Lead A Key\n\nCreighton was 26-0 last year when leading at halftime, but just 1-8 when trailing at intermission.\n\nThis year's team is 8-2 when leading at half, 3-10 when trailing at halftime and 0-1 when tied at the break.\n\nCreighton has won all but two of its last 43 games played when leading at the half, and is 96-12 overall under Greg McDermott when up after 20 minutes.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 199 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in the 12-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own an 169-30 (.849) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (10-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 15,069-12,709 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.86 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 52 different times, including seven times last season and four times already this year.\n\nCreighton is also 25-18 all-time in the 43 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures.\n\nCreighton is 71-12 (.855) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including a 40-3 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 188-30 (.862) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nCreighton's 24-game home win streak that was snapped by Saint Mary's on Dec. 13th was also the longest in facility history by Creighton. The school-record for longest home win streak is 28, done from 1917-1920 and again from 2002-04.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's longest home win streaks in the 12-year history of CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nStreak Dates Snapped By\n\n24 Feb. 19, 2013 - Dec. 9, 2014 Saint Mary's\n\n16 Feb. 9, 2005 - Jan. 31, 2006 Southern Illinois\n\n16 Jan. 19, 2010 - Dec. 22, 2011 Missouri State\n\n14 Feb. 2, 2008 - Dec. 28, 2008 Northern Iowa\n\n11 Nov. 22, 2003 - Feb. 4, 2004 Southern Illinois\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 14 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point, including three games this year, and seven such comebacks away from home.\n\nOn Nov. 19, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), the second-largest since 2000 (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page five).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 102-5 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 90 of the last 91 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nLargest Double-Digit Comebacks Since 2000\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n19 (25-6) Wichita State 01/28/06\n\n18 (37-19) #17 Western Kentucky 11/27/01\n\n18 (42-24*) #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 (34-17) Missouri State 02/12/03\n\n17 (25-8) DePaul 11/09/07\n\n17 (52-35*) Rhode Island 03/18/08\n\n17 (31-14) at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 (53-37*) TCU 01/26/03\n\n16 (43-28*) at Drake 02/04/06\n\n16 (59-43*) New Mexico 11/16/08\n\n16 (31-15) at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n15 (54-39*) Wichita State 02/02/08\n\n*second half\n\nZierden Earns Honor\n\nSophomore guard Isaiah Zierden was named to the All-Tournament Team at the Emerald Coast Classic. He led the Bluejays in scoring during three of the four games in the event, including both contests in Florida.\n\n7-Foot Surprise\n\nRedshirt junior center Geoffrey Groselle had the best game of his Bluejay career on Nov. 25th, finishing with 15 points on 7-of-8 shooting in just 12 minutes of playing time. His play earned him a pair of standing ovations from the more than 17,400+ fans at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nGroselle had owned just 44 career points in the first 36 games of his career before his outburst.\n\nGroselle has made 52-of-77 career field goal attempts, good for 67.5 percent.\n\nQuick Starts Key To Playing in Postseason\n\nCreighton has started off 3-0 (or better) in 14 of the previous 16 seasons, and has done so once again this winter. Each of Creighton's last 15 3-0 starts have been culminated in a postseason tournament appearance at the end of the year.\n\nCreighton also started 5-0 or better for the fourth straight year. The only previous time CU has started 5-0 in four straight years had come in a five-year stretch from 1916-17 to 1920-21.\n\nBalanced Offense\n\nCreighton owns eight players who are averaging 5.0 points per game or more this season. Ten players have scored 11 or more points in a game this year, and CU has seen 10 different leading scorers.\n\nThe last time CU had 11 different men score in double-figures during the same season was 2009-10.\n\nCreighton also has 10 different players with five or more rebounds in a game this year. The Bluejays have had a different player with 10 or more rebounds in four games this season after only having three players with double-figure rebound totals (McDermott, Gibbs, Artino) all last season. Three of those men (Chatman, Milliken, Brooks) are guards.\n\nPoll Position\n\nCreighton is one of 21 teams that have been ranked in the Top 25 in each of the last four seasons.\n\nThat select group features Arizona, Baylor, Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Ohio State, San Diego State, Syracuse, UCLA, UConn, Wichita State and Wisconsin.\n\nCreighton has been ranked in 40 weeks of AP polls under Greg McDermott, and ranked between 26th-to-28th in nine other AP polls. The 40 weeks in the top-25 under McDermott is more than all other coaches in Bluejay history combined.\n\nMost Weeks in AP Top 25 at CU, By Coach\n\nGreg McDermott, 2010-Pres. 40\n\nDana Altman, 1994-2010 18\n\nTom Apke, 1974-81 5\n\nEddie Sutton, 1969-74 5\n\nGive Me Five\n\nA win over Eastern Illinois on Nov. 25 was Creighton's fifth straight victory this season. The Bluejays have now had at least one five-game win streak in 17 of the last 18 seasons.\n\nSince 1988-89, the Bluejays have made the NCAA's, NIT or CBI all 19 previous times they've had a five-game winning streak in a season, but missed the NCAA/NIT/CBI all seven times they haven't.\n\nIncluding this year, Creighton has started 5-0 or better in 10 of the last 17 years, including four straight campaigns. The only previous time CU started 5-0 in four straight seasons came during a five-year stretch from 1916-17 to 1920-21.\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nCreighton has not trailed in four of its 13 home games this season.\n\nIn 199 games at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time, Creighton has not trailed in 52 of those contests, a staggering 26.1 percent of the time, including seven wire-to-wire wins last season and four this year.\n\nDuring recently-ended Creighton's 24-game home winning streak, Creighton led wire-to-wire in 11 of those wins, and trailed for just 103:04 of 970 minutes of action. Only Oklahoma and South Dakota even led the Bluejays in the second half during that streak.\n\nWe Shall Overcome\n\nCreighton trailed by 11 points at halftime in its Nov. 19 comeback win over Oklahoma.\n\nIt was the first time Creighton trailed at halftime at home since Feb. 2, 2013 against Bradley. The Jays trailed 30-27 at the break but would go on to win, 75-58.\n\nThe 11 point halftime deficit was the largest in a home victory since trailing by 15 in the 2008 NIT against Rhode Island.\n\nCreighton is 7-6 all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha in games in which it has TRAILED by 10 points or more at halftime.\n\nBackcourt Boarders\n\nSenior guard Austin Chatman had a career-high 11 rebounds in that Nov. 19 win over Oklahoma, three more than his previous career-high of eight.\n\nChatman became the first Bluejay player with a game of at least 17 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in the same game at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nLink Notes\n\nCreighton is 84-2 all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha in games decided by 15 points or more.\n\nCreighton is 35-12 all-time at CenturyLink Center Omaha in games decided by five points or less.\n\nCreighton is also 14-3 in regular-season home games at CenturyLink Center Omaha decided by two points or less.\n\nWhat A Difference A Year Makes\n\nThe star of Creighton's team last year, Doug McDermott, scored 3,150 points as a Bluejay.\n\nThe players on the 2014-15 Creighton team have scored a total of 3,418 career points in a Bluejay uniform entering Saturday's game.\n\nLast year McDermott averaged 14.0 points in the first half of games. This year, the team's leading scorer (Austin Chatman) averages 10.8 points for an entire game.\n\nDouble-Double Opener\n\nCreighton has won either a conference regular-season title or conference Tournament each of its last seven seasons it has had a player with a double-double in the opener (2012-13, 2001-02, 1999-00, 1998-99, 1990-91, 1989-90, 1988-89).\n\nEach of Creighton's last two players to open the year with a double-double (Doug McDermott in 2012-13 and Kyle Korver in 2001-02) were named MVC Player of the Year and MVC Tournament MVP.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because Will Artino had 14 points and 10 rebounds vs. Central Arkansas in this year's opener.\n\nArtino, who played just 17 minutes vs. Central Arkansas, also became the only Bluejay in the last 25 years to have a double-double in 17 minutes or less.\n\nBig Margin Leads To Big Things\n\nThis year's Creighton team scored 104 points against Central Arkansas on Nov. 14, a good omen for things to come.\n\nNine of Creighton's 19 all-time NCAA Tournament teams have scored 90 or more points in their season-opener.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's last seven teams to score 90 or more in a season-opener.\n\nFinal Post-\n\nScore Opponent Date W-L Season\n\n104-77 Central Arkansas 11/14/14 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n107-61 Alcorn State 11/08/13 27-8 NCAA\n\n97-65 N.

He would go on to successfully complete the rare four-point play.\n\nIsaiah Zierden became the second player this season to do it when he made a four-point play vs. Middle Tennessee on Nov. 29.\n\nIn Greg McDermott's five years at Creighton, the only six men to convert a four-point play have been Milliken, Zierden, Kaleb Korver, Ethan Wragge, Doug McDermott and Avery Dingman.\n\nOf that group, Zierden is the only one to do it twice.\n\nBluejay Debuts\n\nSenior transfer Rick Kreklow and redshirt freshman Toby Hegner both started on Nov. 14 in the season-opener vs. Central Arkansas. The last player to start their first game at Creighton had been Grant Gibbs, who started the 2011-12 opener. Gibbs was on his fourth year of college at that point, after spending two years at Gonzaga and redshirting one season at Creighton.\n\nHegner's start was especially historic, as he became just the third freshman to start an opener since 1992-93, joining Bluejay legends Doug McDermott (2010-11) and Ryan Sears (1997-98). Hegner started his first 21 appearances as a Bluejay before coming off the bench on Jan. 28 vs. St. John's.\n\nHegner became the first freshman in CU history to redshirt his first season, then start the season opener the following year, since freshmen became eligible until 1972-73. McDermott remains the last true freshman to start his first game.\n\nMcDermott Sweeps Player of the Year\n\nDoug McDermott swept all 14 National Player of the Year awards handed out by the media in 2013-14.\n\nHe was honored by the USBWA (Oscar Robertson Trophy), John R. Wooden Award, Naismith Trophy, Adolph F. Rupp Trophy, Associated Press, NABC, CollegeInsider.com Lute Olson Award, Sporting News, Basketball Times, NBCSports.com, CBSSports.com, BleacherReport.com, USA Today and Dick Vitale.\n\nIn addition, he was also honored with the Senior CLASS Award that took into account his off-court contributions.\n\nIt was McDermott's second year with such lofty honor. As a sophomore, he was named CollegeInsider.com's Lute Olson Player of the Year.\n\nMcDermott finished his career last March ranking fifth in NCAA history with 3,150 career points.\n\nNCAA Division I - Most Career Points All-Time\n\nRk.

Last year he set an NBA record with 127 straight games with a three-pointer, and in 2009-10 he set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range.\n\nTolliver ranked 15th in the NBA in three-point percentage with the Charlotte Bobcats (41.3 percent) last season.\n\nMcDermott is a rookie who was the 11th pick in the 2014 NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets, then traded an hour later to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nNation's Best Offense?\n\nYou can make a case that Creighton boasted the nation's best offensive production last year.\n\nCreighton finished the 2013-14 season leading the nation with 41.4 percent marksmanship from three-point range, a 1.80 assist/turnover ratio and 356 three-point field goals.\n\nThe Bluejays were second in assists per game (17.5) and three-pointers per game (10.2), fourth in field goal percentage (.497) and total assists (614), 10th in fewest turnovers per game (9.8), 24th in both scoring average (78.7) and winning percentage and 29th in free throw percentage.\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranked nationally in the first four years of the Greg McDermott tenure (top chart), as well as through his first 4.5 years (through Jan. 14):\n\n2010-11 to 2013-14\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank\n\nFG Percentage .4897 1st\n\n3FG Percentage .4050 1st\n\nAssists 2,407 1st\n\nAssists/Game 16.60 2nd\n\n3FG Made 1,230 2nd\n\nAssist/Turnover Ratio 1.436 4th\n\n3FG Made/Game 8.483 5th\n\nFG Made 3,809 9th\n\nWins 107 15th\n\nWinning Pct. .7379 22nd\n\n2010-11 to Jan. 14, 2015\n\nCategory Stat NCAA Rank\n\nFG Percentage .4815 3rd\n\n3FG Percentage .3956 2nd\n\nAssists 2,656 3rd\n\nAssists/Game 16.29 3rd\n\n3FG Made 1,379 3rd\n\nAssist/Turnover Ratio 1.406 5th\n\nThree-Mendous Shooting\n\nCreighton owned 356 three-pointers last season, most in school history. The 2012-13 club set the previous school standard with 307 in 36 games.\n\nCreighton's 356 three-pointers ranked 11th-best in NCAA single-season history, and led the nation last year.\n\nIn addition, Creighton's 41.4 percent marksmanship from three-point range ranked tied for third-best in school history.\n\nLast year's Creighton team owned 173 three-pointers in BIG EAST play alone, breaking a conference record (in league play) of 155 first set by the 2004-05 Notre Dame team.\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 15 of the last 16 seasons, a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust five schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 16 years: Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas and Syracuse.\n\nAlong with Kentucky, Creighton is one of two schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 15 of the past 16 years.\n\nThat's better than traditional powers Arizona, Connecticut and Memphis (14 each) and also ahead of Michigan State, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin (13 each).\n\nPostseason x 17\n\nCreighton has made the postseason in 17 consecutive seasons. The only eight schools to make the postseason in each of the last 17 years are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Syracuse.\n\nPostseason Win Streak\n\nThanks to an NCAA Tournament win over Louisiana last spring, the Creighton men's basketball team has now won a postseason game in a school-record seven straight seasons. The previous mark was three in a row from 1962-64.\n\nThe following four programs are the only ones that have won a postseason game in seven straight seasons, including 2013-14: Creighton, Kansas, North Carolina and Syracuse.\n\nEight Out Of 16 Tourney Titles\n\nCreighton owns eight league tournament titles in the last 16 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Gonzaga (12), Duke (10), Winthrop (9) and Creighton (8).\n\nFull House\n\nLast year's Creighton team averaged 17,896 in 16 home dates, good for fifth-nationally, and better than 16 NBA clubs. It's the eighth straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the third straight season in the top-six nationally in attendance, as well.\n\nThis year's team is sixth nationally in attendance, through games of Feb. 4.\n\n2014-15 Attendance Leaders (through 2/4)\n\nRk.

That streak dates to a Feb. 5, 1994 win against Wichita State.\n\n50 Percent Leads To Wins\n\nCreighton ranked fourth nationally in field goal percentage last season, making 49.7 percent of its shots from the floor.\n\nThe Bluejays had won 61 straight games when shooting 50.0 percent or better from the field before its Jan. 10 loss to Seton Hall when shooting 51.1 percent.\n\nAll-time under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 59-2 when shooting 50.01 percent or better.\n\nSpecial Senior Class\n\nLast year's senior class featured four men who have graduated and moved on to the professional level; Grant Gibbs, Jahenns Manigat, Doug McDermott and Ethan Wragge.\n\nDuring the previous four years, the Jays went 107-38 while appearing in the postseason every season, claiming the 2012-13 MVC regular-season title, as well as the 2012 and 2013 MVC Tournament titles. The 29 wins in 2011-12 tied a school-record, as are the 57 wins from 2011-13 for a two-year span, the 84 wins from 2011-14 the mark for a three-year span and 107 wins are the most-ever in a four-year span at Creighton.\n\nIn those four years the team was 64-7 at home, including a 31-5 mark in league play at home, and that group was part of the first teams in school history to win NCAA Tournament games in consecutive seasons.\n\nThe quartet combined for 5,964 points, 2,250 rebounds and 1,062 assists while shooting a combined 872-2013 (43.3%) from three-point range at Creighton.\n\nMost Wins, 3-Year Stretch\n\nW-L Years\n\n84 2011-14\n\n80 2010-13\n\n76 2000-03\n\n72 2001-04\n\n72 2002-05\n\nMost Wins, 4-Year Stretch\n\nW-L Years\n\n107 2010-14\n\n99 1999-03\n\n98 2009-13\n\n97 2008-12\n\n96 2000-04\n\nClosing Strong\n\nCreighton has won 44 of its last 46 games when leading with 5:00 to play.\n\nOverall under Greg McDermott, Creighton is 107-6 when leading with 5:00 left. The Bluejays are also 3-1 under McDermott when tied with 5:00 to play.\n\nCU is 8-44 under McDermott when trailing with 5:00 left, with the last such rally coming on Feb. 4, 2015 at Xavier.\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nGreg McDermott is 118-51 on the Creighton sideline in his fifth year at the helm. The 118 wins are easily the most in Creighton history in the first five seasons.\n\nHow good are McDermott's 118 wins in his fifth season? The only coach to start his Creighton career with more than 108 wins after SIX seasons was Tom Apke (109). Apke also owned the best mark after five seasons, going 93-43 to open his career on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nMost Wins at CU, First Five Seasons\n\nCoach Years W-L After 5 Yrs\n\nGreg McDermott 2010-Pres. 118-51 so far\n\nTom Apke 1974-78 93-43\n\nEddie Sutton 1969-73 82-50\n\nTony Barone 1985-89 78-74\n\nRed McManus 1959-63 78-53\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is a perfect 85-0 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nIn other words, Creighton is a perfect 97-0 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over five years ago, Creighton is averaging 77.42 points per home game (6,503 points in 84 home games).\n\nThat's a vital number since Creighton is 108-0 at home (79-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more and 90-0 at home (63-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000.\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton attracted eight of its 20 largest home crowds in program history last season. Here's a look at Creighton's top-20 home crowds all-time.\n\nRank Att.

Creighton was ranked in the Associated Press top-25 in 11-of-20 weeks and finished 16th in the year-end poll.\n\nDoug McDermott swept all 14 National Player of the Year awards after leading the team with 26.7 points per game and 7.0 rebounds per contest. He was also named BIG EAST Player of the Year and wrapped his career as the fifth-leading scorer in NCAA history with 3,150 points.\n\nEthan Wragge (10.4 ppg.) was named Honorable-Mention All-BIG EAST after finishing in the top-10 in both three-pointers made and three-point percentage.\n\nThe Bluejays led the nation in three-pointers made (356), three-point percentage (41.4) and assist/turnover ratio (1.80).\n\nAfter earning the program's first at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament since 2001, Creighton topped Louisiana before falling to No. 24 Baylor in the third round.\n\nShuttle Service Provided Again\n\nChief Bus will provide complimentary shuttle service from the Creighton University campus to CenturyLink Center Omaha for all men's basketball home games this season. The service is available to all fans, not just Creighton students.\n\nThe shuttle will start 75 minutes before tip-off and shuttles will continue to operate the route during the game. The three designated stops for pick-up around the CU campus are: 24th & California (nearside/southbound); 20th & Cass (nearside/eastbound) and at Billy Blues Alumni Grill (outside the Mike & Josie Harper Center in the turnaround which is on the east side of the building).\n\nThe shuttle will then go eastbound on Capitol Avenue and then go north up 10th Street for drop-off at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance. The route is designed for each shuttle driver to make a roundtrip every 15 minutes.\n\nFollowing the game's conclusion, the shuttle will start at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance on 10th Street and loop the original route with the first of three stops at 24th & California Streets.\n\nTicket Information\n\nSingle-game tickets for the 2014-15 season went on sale on November 3rd at 10 am.\n\nFans can purchase single-game tickets at CenturyLink Center Omaha Box Office, Ryan Athletic Center, all Ticketmaster locations (Baker's, Younkers), Ticketmaster online at http://www.ticketmaster.com or by calling Ticketmaster and charging by phone at (800) 745-3000.
