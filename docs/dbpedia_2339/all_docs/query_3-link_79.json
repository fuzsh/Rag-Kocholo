        "text": "Thomas Welsh was relatively innocent. He played only 16 of the 40-minute abomination last year, UCLA’s 83-44 surrender to Kentucky.\n\nHe missed three of four shots, which means he dragged down the Bruins’ shooting percentage of 26.9 only slightly.\n\nCoach Steve Alford did not show these Bruins the tape of the game, which is X-rated anyway and wouldn’t have been suitable. He did tell them they played scared that day, and offered to cancel Thursday night’s rematch if they wanted.\n\nNobody took him up on it, primarily because the Bruins had heard enough about Kentucky’s lottery-bound freshmen. They wanted to show Kentucky that a secret weapon can sometimes stand 7-foot-2.\n\nWelsh came out and led UCLA’s first victory over a top-ranked opponent since Steve Lavin’s last UCLA win, an upset of Arizona in the Pac-10 tournament 13 seasons ago. He scored 21. He got 11 rebounds. He squeezed every basketball he could find and he was close to automatic when he drifted out to 12 feet and got the passes from Bryce Alford.\n\n“With Thomas and Tony Parker I think we’ve got the best two bigs in the country,” B. Alford said. Certainly Welsh was too much for freshman Skal Labissiere, considered the No. 2 pick in the 2016 NBA draft. Welsh might be joining Labissiere in that Green Room with more nights like this, which keyed an 87-77 victory that was both comprehensive and exclusionary. UCLA just refused to hear Kentucky knocking.\n\nThe strong contingent of Big Blue fans in Pauley Pavilion kept hoping for a rally, but UCLA wouldn’t let it happen. The closest Kentucky surge was 4-0, cutting the lead to 10, but then Alford hit a jumper and Parker hit two free throws.\n\nBryce, who is very much cut from the same smart-aleck cloth as his dad, was asked about the dimension of the upset.\n\n“We thought we were going to win,” Alford said. “Nobody in the world did. I heard a lot this week about trying to keep it competitive. I’m glad we did that.”\n\nWelsh began making this journey toward fortune midway through last season. The Bruins’ bench was emptier than a manager’s lineup card in the 16th inning, and yet Welsh kept honing his shot and playing bolder basketball.\n\n“We’ve been telling him all along that he’s a good player,” his coach said. “He’s a thinker, a worker. I think playing with Team USA this summer gave him some confidence, and we’ve seen it all season. These stats are what he does in practice, but he’s blocking shots and rebounding, too.”\n\n“For our sophomore center to get 21 and 11 against this team, against their big guys, that was impressive.”\n\nWelsh couldn’t put a percentage on how far he has come. There were plenty of numbers on the sheet. He was 8-for-11. Labissiere, at 7-foot-1, had one whole rebound. UCLA won the paint battle 30-28, and it compacted its man-to-man defense well enough to induce 25 three-point shots from a team that was averaging 27 percent from there.\n\n“I thought they were going to the zone but they never did,” said John Calipari, the Kentucky coach. “They never had to. It was disappointing they got most of the loose balls, and they were more physical inside than us.”\n\nThat’s right. Physical UCLA.\n\n“That kid Welsh was making all the pops,” Kentucky’s Tyler Ulis said.\n\n“These guys make me better by finding me for those shots,” Welsh said. “I think our maturity was a huge factor tonight. Earlier in the year we haven’t been that good defensively and the coaches locked in on that. If you can play defense, you can win games.”\n\nThere were some bread crumbs along the way that signalled a memorable night for the Bruins. For one thing, the world showed up: Shaquille O’Neal, Jessica Alba, Baron Davis, Jamaal Wilkes, Jim Harrick, Jaleel White, Ann Meyers. Few of them were seen at the CSUN game last Sunday.\n\nAnd then there were telltale plays. Aaron Holliday hitting a 20-footer, experiencing a heat-check, throwing up a 3-pointer and banking it in…..Isaac Hamilton making an in-bounds pass off Ulis’ leg and picking up the loose ball and scoring…Prince Ali, the 6-foot-3 freshman, descending from the Getty Museum or somewhere for a wild slam in the lane.\n\n“I looked at him and I saw Baron Davis in the background, going crazy,” B. Alford said.\n\nA student even swished a half-court shot at halftime and won a free airline ticket to anywhere. UCLA did him one better. It flew back 50 years."
