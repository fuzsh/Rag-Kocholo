        "text": "St. John’s is in discussions with head coach Steve Lavin to extend his tenure in charge of the Red Storm, Sporting News has learned.\n\nMultiple media reports have indicated Lavin’s future at St. John’s is in question, but it is possible a contract extension for Lavin could be announced early next week, according to a source close to the school.\n\nMORE: Kentucky fan gets memorable tattoo | Who's in, who's out among college basketball coaches? | UK's secret weapon\n\nIn 2015, Lavin’s team made its second NCAA Tournament appearance in his four full seasons as head coach. (He missed most of one season recovering from treatment for prostate cancer). The Red Storm finished the season 21-12, including a 10-8 mark in the Big East Conference. However, the team was eliminated from both the NCAAs and Big East Tournament in its opening game.\n\nLavin has produced three 20-win seasons and has a career record of 81-55 at St. John’s, 226-133 including his time at UCLA. He made four NCAA Sweet 16s and one Elite Eight during his time with the Bruins, then spent seven years doing television analysis for ESPN before getting back into coaching with the Red Storm in 2010. The two NCAA Tournament bids were the first for St. John’s since 2002.\n\nLavin will lose five seniors from the current team, with all on schedule to graduate. Lavin’s current contract runs through the 2015-16 season."
