        "text": "The nation came to a standstill on Tuesday night as she took to the ring and put on a clinical performance to win her second gold medal and Ireland's fourth of the week.\n\nTaoiseach Simon Harris led the tributes to the Dublin boxer, saying the country “could not be prouder of you”.\n\n“Kellie Harrington you’ve made history. On behalf of the government and people of Ireland it is my joy as Taoiseach to say we could not be prouder of you.\n\n\"We are not only proud of you for becoming a double Olympic champion, but for how you carry yourself as a person and represent our country with distinction. You have inspired us all, young and old.\n\n\"You, your family, your coaches, and your community deserve every moment of this victory and celebration.\n\n\"All of Ireland is celebrating with you. What a legend,” Mr Harris said.\n\nDiamond Park in Dublin’s inner city erupted with pride after boxing hero Kellie won the gold medal.\n\nThere was huge excitement as Dubliners watched Harrington take on China’s Wenlu Yang in the women’s 60kg final.\n\n“She did it! She did it!”.\n\nThe realisation that Kellie Harrington of Portland Row has brought home the gold for the second time in three years spread across Diamond Park like wildfire.\n\nThe park, in Harrington’s home turf of Dublin 1, erupted as the 34-year old claimed Ireland’s seventh medal of the Paris Olympics.\n\nOver 800 fans attended a live screening of the semi-final in Kellie Harrington’s Dublin neighbourhood on August 3. This time again, her beloved came out in numbers to show their support.\n\nThousands of kilometres away, the champion’s determination was palpable. She was bringing it home.\n\nWith a chorus of “Ole Ole Ole!” and “Kellie! Kellie! Kellie!”, friends, relatives and neighbours fell into each other’s arms as an emotional Kellie Harrington was announced as the winner.\n\nFans in Diamond Park told the Irish Independent that they felt “proud” and “relieved” after the fight.\n\n“Well done Kellie!\n\n“Kellie is such an inspiration”, said Noel Ghan from Portland Row.\n\n“Kids will be so inspired by her. It’s amazing. It’s great to see”.\n\nJohn Blinds from the North Inner City told the Irish Independent that she did the Inner city proud.\n\n“From start to finish she dominated that fight”, he said.\n\n“Kellie brought great pride to Dublin and she deserves her retirement”, said Deidre McFeely from Cabra.\n\nJim Lynch from Dundrum said there was never any doubt in the result, we knew she had it from the start”.\n\nSamantha Murphy from Dublin Inner city told the Irish Independent, “this is great for the community. We’re all so proud of her”.\n\n“We can't wait for her to come home. Well done Kellie!”, said Lexi O’Leary from Summerhill, Dublin 1.\n\nChildren wore Ireland football jerseys, tied their hair up with green, white and orange ribbons, and had shamrocks painted on their faces.\n\nEllie May Fetherston, 12, from Blanchardstown, took up boxing after Harrington won gold in the same weight class at the Tokyo Games in 2021.\n\nShe said she admires Harrington’s ability to switch boxing styles during bouts.\n\nChildren crowded in front of the big screen in Diamond Park and punched the air as the boxer from nearby Portland Row weaved and jabbed in the ring at the Roland-Garros tennis stadium.\n\nLocals praised Harrington’s work in the local community, putting on sports days for young people and working as a carer.\n\nGillian Collins said the fighter was bringing a positive focus on the north inner city.\n\n“When people stop her on the street she stops for a chat. She high fives all the kids, they love her,” she said.\n\n“She’s very very down to earth.”\n\nPatricia Byrne, from Portland Row, said Harrington is great for Dublin’s inner city.\n\nShe said a man who had travelled from Cavan to attend the watch party had asked where her family home was.\n\n“She’s made us all proud. It brings everybody together,” she said.\n\n“She’s real down to earth. Never changed.”\n\nAsked about whether Portland Row would put on another big homecoming for Harrington, Ms Byrne said this one would be “better and bigger”."
