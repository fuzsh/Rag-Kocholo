        "text": "Bluejays end longest drought between home games since 1987-88 season\n\nGame #15: #16 Providence Friars at Creighton Bluejays\n\nTuesday, Jan. 11, 2022 • 8:00 p.m.\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha (17,352) • Omaha, Neb.\n\nRadio: KOZN 1620 AM, 1620thezone.com; KOOO (101.9 FM); XM 386; SiriusXM app 976\n\nTelevision: FS1 (Vince Welch, Steve Lavin)\n\nSeries History: Providence leads, 17-12\n\nLast Meeting: Providence 74, #11 Creighton 70 on Jan. 20, 2021 in Omaha, Neb.\n\nLIVE VIDEO | LIVE AUDIO | LIVE STATS | CU NOTES (PDF) | PC NOTES (PDF)\n\nNOTE: Rankings in this release are based on Jan. 3 AP poll, though a new poll will be released on Jan. 10th.\n\nNext Game\n\nCreighton (10-4, 2-1 BIG EAST) returns to play its first home game of 2022 on Tuesday, Jan. 11 when it hosts No. 16 Providence (14-2, 4-1 BIG EAST).\n\nThe Bluejays and Friars will tip from First National Bank Court at CHI Health Center Omaha at 8 p.m.\n\nCOVID-19 Precautions at CU Athletic Events\n\nCreighton University is requiring face coverings to be worn in all indoor spaces on its campuses and in all athletic venues, including CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nThese requirements will continue through Jan. 31, at which time the University will reassess conditions.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKOZN (1620 AM) will broadcast all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2021-22 season.

Visit www.gocreighton.com and click on the small bar graph icon on the scoreboard at the top of the page for the event of your choosing.\n\nHome games can also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nScouting Creighton\n\nCreighton is 10-4 this season, including double-digit wins over No. 9 Villanova (79-59) and No. 24 BYU (83-71). The Bluejays have not played at home since Dec. 17.\n\nThe Bluejays return seven lettermen but no starters from last year's team that finished 22-9 overall, runner-up in the BIG EAST, and reached the program's first Sweet 16 since 1974.\n\nOf CU's scholarship returners, only Ryan Kalkbrenner (12.3 ppg, 6.9 rpg., 2.8 bpg.), Alex O'Connell (11.9 ppg., 5.2 rpg.) and Shereef Mitchell (3.5 ppg.) are back after playing last year.\n\nThe Bluejays brought in grad transfers Ryan Hawkins (13.4 ppg., 7.4 rpg.) and KeyShawn Feazell (3.9 ppg., 3.5 rpg.) to bolster the front line. Hawkins leads the squad with 32 three-pointers made and has averaged 17.3 points in four games against top-25 competition.\n\nCreighton also features the nation's No. 7 recruiting class, with Arthur Kaluma (8.1 ppg,. 4.6 rpg.) and four-time BIG EAST Freshman of the Week Ryan Nembhard (12.1 ppg., 4.4 apg.) starting every game to date.\n\nCreighton averages 70.4 points per game on 46.9 percent shooting from the field and has outrebounded foes by 4.5 caroms per contest. The Bluejays have held foes to 39.5 percent shooting and 65.9 points per contest.\n\nScouting #16 Providence\n\nRanked No. 16 in the Jan. 2 Associated Press poll, Providence owns a BIG EAST-leading 14 victories and is tied with Villanova atop the league standings with a 14-2 conference record.\n\nThe Friars own four Quad 1 wins and claim victories at Wisconsin and UConn as well as home wins vs. Texas Tech, Seton Hall, and St. John's. Both of PC losses have been lopsided, falling 58-40 vs. Virginia and 88-56 at Marquette.\n\nPreseason All-BIG EAST pick Nate Watson leads the Friars with 14.1 points per game while making 56.8 percent of his shot attempts. In addition, transfer Al Durham averages 13.3 points and 3.1 assists per game after scoring more than 1,000 points at Indiana.\n\nNoah Horchler has also played well of late, averaging 9.8 points and 8.4 rebounds per game this season. PC has played without A.J. Reeves (10.7 ppg., 30 three-pointers) the past two games.\n\nAs a team, Providence averages 69.8 points per game while allowing 63.6 per contest. The Friars shoot 43.7 percent from the floor, 72.4 percent at the line and 32.4 percent behind the arc.\n\nThe Series With Providence\n\nProvidence leads the all-time series, 17-12, but the teams have split 12 meetings in Omaha. Since Creighton joined PC in the BIG EAST in 2013, the Friars have won 11-of-19 contests, including 2-of-3 BIG EAST Tournament contests.\n\nFive of the last six match-ups in Omaha have been decided by six points or less.\n\nGreg McDermott is 8-11 in his career against Providence and Ed Cooley. Cooley is 11-9 in his career against Creighton, having also lost a CIT game when he was head coach at Fairfield.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) owns a 263-129 record in his 12th season with the Bluejays. He owns a career mark of 543-324 in his 28th season, and is 412-260 in his 21st Division I campaign.\n\nMcDermott led Creighton to its first BIG EAST regular-season title in 2019-20, taking a Bluejay team that was picked seventh in the league's preseason poll and ending the year ranked seventh nationally. The Cascade, Iowa native then coached Creighton to its first Sweet 16 since 1974 in 2020-21 and to a share of its first regular-season BIG EAST title in 2019-20.\n\nMcDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nHe is assisted by Alan Huss, Ryan Miller and Jalen Courtney-Williams.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n- Teams with Ryan Hawkins would improve to 170-12 at the college level, and 95-7 in league play. His teams would also improve to 12-0 after a loss.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 27-37 all-time vs. top-25 teams under Greg McDermott, if Providence remained ranked.\n\n- If Providence remains ranked, Creighton would improve to 3-2 this season vs. top-25 teams and match Alabama, Gonzaga, Iowa State, Ohio State, Oklahoma and Villanova for the nation's most top-25 wins this season.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 9-2 in its last 11 BIG EAST games vs. top-25 teams at any site, assuming Providence is still ranked.\n\nBouncing Back\n\nCreighton doesn't lose many games by 20 or more points, as it did on Jan. 5 at Villanova in its last game.\n\nHowever, each of the previous 14 times it has happened, Creighton has answered with a victory in its next game. The Jays are 17-1 since the Jan. 1, 2002 in those scenarios.\n\nCreighton's Losses by 20+ Points Since 2002\n\nDate Loss by 20+ Points Next Game Result\n\n02/28/04 Missouri State 70, CU 46 03/01/04 CU 75, Wichita State 61\n\n02/16/08 Bradley 87, CU 59 02/19/08 CU 88, Missouri State 67\n\n03/21/08 Florida 82, CU 54 11/1/08 CU 82, New Mexico 75\n\n01/03/09 Illinois State 86, CU 64 01/06/09 Northern Iowa 69, CU 66\n\n03/07/09 Illinois State 73, CU 49 03/18/09 CU 73, Bowling Green 71\n\n02/11/12 Wichita State 89, #17 CU 68 02/14/12 CU 88, Southern Illinois 69\n\n03/23/14 #23 Baylor 85, #16 CU 55 11/14/14 CU 104, Central Arkansas 77\n\n01/25/15 #4 Villanova 71, CU 50 01/28/15 CU 77, St. John's 74\n\n01/31/15 #21 Georgetown 67, CU 40 02/04/15 CU 79, Xavier 72 (OT)\n\n11/19/15 #14 Indiana 86, CU 65 11/23/15 CU 85, Rutgers 75\n\n02/03/16 #3 Villanova 83, CU 58 02/06/16 CU 88, DePaul 66\n\n01/25/17 Georgetown 71, #16 CU 51 01/28/17 #16 CU 83, DePaul 66\n\n01/13/18 #10 Xavier 92, #25 CU 70 01/17/18 CU 80, #19 Seton Hall 63\n\n02/01/18 #1 Villanova 98, CU 78 02/07/18 CU 76, DePaul 75\n\n02/20/18 Butler 93, CU 70 02/24/18 CU 89, #3 Villanova 83 (OT)\n\n11/28/19 San Diego State 83, CU 52 11/29/19 CU 83, #12 Texas Tech 76 (OT)\n\n03/01/20 St. John's 91, #10 CU 71 03/04/20 #11 CU 91, Georgetown 76\n\n03/13/21 Georgetown 73, CU 48 03/20/21 #19 CU 63, UC Santa Barbara 62\n\n01/05/22 #19 Villanova 75, CU 41 01/11/22 #16 Providence at CU\n\nTeaching Moments\n\nLast Wednesday was just Creighton's fourth loss in by 30 points or more in the past 25 years.\n\nEach of the previous three times it happened, success followed.\n\nCreighton's Losses by 30+ Points Since 1996\n\nDate Loss by 30+ Points Then What Finished\n\n12/19/01 Western Kentucky 95, CU 61 Won 9 of next 11 23-9 (won MVC)\n\n03/23/14 #23 Baylor 85, #16 CU 55 Won next 5 27-8 in 2013-14; 14-19 in '14-15\n\n11/28/19 San Diego State 83, CU 52 Won next 8 24-7 (Won Big East)\n\n01/05/22 #19 Villanova 75, CU 41 TBD TBD\n\nSeeking 57\n\nCreighton failed to break the 50 point barrier in its last outing, when it finished the Villanova game with just 41 points. Creighton's 41 points at Villanova were its fewest since a 67-40 loss to Georgetown on Jan. 31, 2015.\n\nIt was just the fourth time in Greg McDermott's 12 years at Creighton that the Bluejays failed to score 50 or more points.\n\nIn McDermott's Division I career spanning 672 games, his teams are 1-17 when scoring less than 50 points. The lone win came on Feb. 28, 2004, when Northern Iowa defeated Indiana State 48-47 in Terre Haute.\n\nCU is also 1-21 under McDermott when scoring 56 points or fewer, with the lone win coming earlier this season vs. Kennesaw State (51-44).\n\nIn the game after scoring 56 points or less, Creighton has won 10 straight and is 17-4 under McDermott while averaging 79.2 points.\n\nCU has not been held to 55 points or less in consecutive games since January of 2008 and hasn't been held under 50 points in consecutive contests since January of 1952.\n\nO'Connell Can\n\nSenior Alex O'Connell has scored in double-figures in each of Creighton's last five games, draining 12 three-pointers in that span.\n\nAfter scoring in double-figures just 13-of-101 games at Duke and 3-of-24 contests last season at Creighton, O'Connell has scored 10 or more points in 11-of-14 battles this season.\n\nDuring the loss at Villanova, Creighton fell to 8-1 all-time when O'Connell scores 12 points or more. The Georgia native is averaging 11.9 points per game overall this season for CU, including a team-best 14.0 points per game in BIG EAST action.\n\nChairmen Of The Boards\n\nCreighton is 7-0 this season when grabbing 10 or more offensive rebounds. The Bluejays average 11.20 offensive rebounds in its 10 wins, compared to 8.00 offensive boards in its four losses.\n\nCreighton is undefeated over the past two seasons when grabbing 10 or more offensive rebounds, going 12-0 since a loss on March 1, 2020 to St. John's.\n\nPaint By Numbers\n\nProvidence's Nate Watson and Creighton's Ryan Kalkbrenner are the BIG EAST's lone players in the top-30 in scoring (10.4 ppg. and up) who have yet to make a three-pointer this season.\n\nWatson owns 96 field goals, while Kalkbrenner owns 71 baskets.\n\nNot surprisingly, Kalkbrenner (1st) and Watson (3rd) are both among the league leaders in field goal percentage.\n\nKalkbrenner Doubles Up\n\nLess than halfway into his sophomore season, Ryan Kalkbrenner is close to surpassing his totals from all of last season already.\n\nLast season Kalkbrenner had 182 points, 108 rebounds, 38 blocks and 29 dunks in 422 minutes. This year Kalkbrenner owns 172 points, 97 rebounds, 39 blocks and 28 dunks in 364 minutes.\n\nA big part of that has been his increased stamina. Even though his minutes per game have nearly doubled from 13.6 to 26.0 minutes per game, his per-minute stats have also risen.\n\nPer 40 Minutes - Ryan Kalkbrenner\n\nYear PTS/40 REB/40 BLOCKS/40 DUNKS/40\n\n2020-21 17.3 10.2 3.6 2.7\n\n2021-22 18.9 10.7 4.3 3.1\n\nRanking News & Notes\n\n- Creighton is 26-37 under Greg McDermott against nationally-ranked teams, 19 more top-25 wins than any other coach in Creighton history. Prior to McDermott's arrival, Creighton was 18-115 all-time against top-25 foes.\n\n- Creighton's 26 top-25 wins since McDermott took over in 2010 are as many top-25 wins as UCLA (26) owns, and more than schools like Arizona (24), Maryland (21), LSU (16), Houston (14), Wichita State (14), Nebraska (14), BYU (12), USC (10), Memphis (9), Saint Mary's (6) and Loyola Chicago (5) in that time.\n\n- Creighton has beaten at least one ranked team in each of the last eight seasons (including 2021-22), and multiple ranked foes in each of the last seven seasons (including 2021-22).\n\nOn a national basis, the only 23 teams with a top-25 win each of the previous eight seasons (entering 2021-22) were Baylor, Clemson, Creighton, Duke, Florida State, Indiana, Kansas, Kansas State, Kentucky, Louisville, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Syracuse, Texas Tech, Villanova, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Xavier.\n\n- Creighton is 21-20 since the start of the 2016-17 season against ranked teams. The 21 wins over ranked teams in that time are 14th-most nationally, and trails only Villanova (27) among BIG EAST clubs.\n\n- Assuming No. 16 Providence and No. 22 Xavier stay ranked this week, Creighton will be playing three straight games against top-25 competition for the first time ever.\n\nCreighton would also be playing their fifth and sixth ranked teams in a span of eight games for the first time in program history. The only other times CU played six ranked teams in the same season have been 2017-18 (10), 2014-15 (8), 2015-16 (8), 2019-20 (8), 2016-17 (7), 1971-72 (6), 2018-19 (6) and 2020-21 (6).\n\nTop 25 Success\n\nA 79-59 win vs. No. 9 Villanova coupled with an 83-71 win vs. No. 24 BYU means Creighton owns a pair double-digit wins over top-25 competition this season, something only four other schools can also claim. Gonzaga's done it three times while Villanova, Oklahoma and Iowa State have done it twice.\n\nThe Bluejays have now beaten multiple top-25 foes each of the last seven seasons (2015-16 to 2021-22), something only Baylor, Gonzaga, Purdue, Texas Tech and Villanova can also claim. Five other schools have beaten multiple top-25 foes in each of the previous six seasons -- Florida State, Kansas, Michigan, Michigan State (1), Penn State and West Virginia (1) but are still seeking two top-25 wins this winter.\n\nCreighton's Most Top-25 Wins, Season\n\nWins Season Top-25 Victims\n\n6 2019-20 #8 Villanova, #10 Seton Hall,\n\n#12 Texas Tech, #19 Marquette,\n\n#21 Butler, #8 Seton Hall\n\n4 2016-17 #9 Wisconsin, #12 Butler,\n\n#16 Butler, #22 Xavier\n\n4 2017-18 #3 Villanova, #19 Seton Hall,\n\n#20 Northwestern, #23 UCLA\n\n3 2020-21 #5 Villanova, #22 Xavier, #23 UConn\n\n2 1973-74 #6 Marquette, #16 Louisville\n\n2 2001-02 #15 Florida, #17 Western Kentucky\n\n2 2006-07 #11 Southern Illinois, #24 Xavier\n\n2 2013-14 #4 Villanova, #6 Villanova\n\n2 2015-16 #5 Xavier, #18 Butler\n\n2 2018-19 #10 Marquette, #16 Clemson\n\n2 2021-22 #9 Villanova, #24 BYU\n\nBig Mac On The Attack\n\nGreg McDermott's teams have consistently battled some of the best teams in the country.\n\nThe chart below shows how his teams have consistently outpaced those of his predecessors against top-25 foes.\n\nCategory Pre-McDermott Under McDermott\n\nvs. Top 25 Teams 18-115 26-37\n\nvs. Top 10 Teams 5-31 11-17\n\nvs. Top 10 on Road 1-28 4-9\n\nvs. Top 25 on Road 2-63 8-17\n\nBest Win % vs. Top-25 Since 2016-17 (thru 1/8/22)\n\n(Minimum 30 games)\n\nRk.

Defensively, Creighton's 18.7 percent figure ranks fourth-best nationally.\n\nLong Road Home\n\nAfter 25 days away, Creighton will be playing its first home game since crushing Villanova on Dec. 17th.\n\nThe last time Creighton went 25 days or more between home games during a season came during the 1987-88 campaign when the Bluejays hosted Nebraska on Dec. 9th, then didn't play again at home until welcoming Southern Illinois 33 days later on Jan. 11th.\n\nHow's This, For Starters?\n\nCreighton and Villanova are the only two teams in the BIG EAST Conference to have used the same starting five for every game this season.\n\nCreighton's bench has scored 177 points in 14 games, while Nova's reserve corps has scored 170 points in 15 games.\n\nWhat makes it all the more impressive is that the five men to start for Creighton this year had combined for ZERO combined starts as Bluejays entering the season, whereas Villanova's Collin Gillespie (87), Justin Moore (41), Jermaine Samuels (76) and Brandon Slater (2) had 206 career starts as a Wildcat entering this winter.\n\nUp, Up And Away\n\nSince Feb. 19, 2019, Creighton owns a 34-12 mark in regular-season BIG EAST games. That's four more wins than anyone else in the league in that time.\n\nNot only that, but Creighton owned the most wins to close the 2018-19 season after Feb. 19th, tied for the most wins in 2019-20, and had the most wins in 2020-21 as well.\n\nConference Records Since Feb. 19, 2019\n\n(Through Jan. 9, 2022)\n\nTeam After 2/19/19 '19-20 '20-21 '21-22 Total\n\nCreighton 5-0 13-5 14-6 2-1 34-12\n\nVillanova 2-3 13-5 11-4 4-1 30-13\n\nProvidence 3-2 12-6 9-10 4-1 28-19\n\nSeton Hall 2-3 13-5 10-9 2-2 27-19\n\nUConn 2-4# 10-8# 11-6 1-2 24-20\n\nXavier 4-1 8-10 6-7 2-1 20-19\n\nButler 1-4 10-8 8-12 1-2 20-26\n\nMarquette 2-4 8-10 8-11 2-3 20-28\n\nSt. John's 1-4 5-13 10-9 1-1 17-27\n\nGeorgetown 4-2 5-13 7-9 0-1 16-25\n\nDePaul 2-3 3-15 2-13 0-4 7-35\n\n#includes 2018-19 and 2019-20 in the AAC\n\nHeavyweight Showdown\n\nVillanova has 117 league wins to lead the BIG EAST by a wide margin, but Creighton's 85 league victories are second-most.

Meanwhile, Hawkins' Northwest Missouri State team was the top-ranked squad in the Division II ranks and finished with 31-1 overall record and on a 23-game win streak.\n\nYear National Champion\n\n2015-16 Villanova\n\n2016-17 Ryan Hawkins (Northwest Missouri State)\n\n2017-18 Villanova\n\n2018-19 Ryan Hawkins (Northwest Missouri State)\n\n2019-20 COVID-19\n\n2020-21 Ryan Hawkins (Northwest Missouri State)\n\nFrosh Watch\n\nCreighton is winning at a regular rate despite playing three freshmen (Trey Alexander, Arthur Kaluma, Ryan Nembhard) more than 22 minutes per game.\n\nOn a national basis through Jan. 8, only 140 players classified as freshmen (true, redshirt or otherwise) were playing 22 minutes per game per Basketball-Reference.com.\n\nOnly seven of those freshmen are from the BIG EAST, and besides Alexander, Kaluma and Nembhard the only other true freshmen in the BIG EAST playing 22 minutes per game or more are Georgetown's Aminu Mohammed and Butler's Jayden Taylor.\n\nCU is the only team nationally to play three true freshmen more than 22 minutes per game.\n\nAnd speaking of freshman minutes, Nembhard ranks third nationally among all freshmen with 35.1 minutes per game. The next-closest freshman from a Power 5 or BIG EAST program is Nebraska's Bryce McGowens (33.4 mpg.).\n\nNembhard A Consistent Threat\n\nRyan Nembhard's 169 points through 14 games are the most by any Bluejay true freshman since Doug McDermott had 185 in 2010-11.\n\nMcDermott would finish his career with 3,150 in 145 career games to rank fifth in NCAA history.\n\nMost Points, Newcomers First 14 Games Since 1995-96\n\nPts.

Creighton has had at least one freshman on the floor for every second of every game this season, and actually had a late stretch of 1:28 vs. Colorado State when all five of its players on the floor were freshmen.\n\nCreighton has outscored teams by 90 when it has two freshmen or less on the court, but have been outscored by 26 points when it has three or more freshmen on the floor.\n\nAll told, 1323:09 of Creighton's 2,850 total minutes (46.43 percent) have been played by freshmen this season.\n\nBy comparison, last season Creighton had a freshman on the floor just 32.4 percent of the time and had multiple freshmen on the floor just 17 minutes (of 1,250) all season (1.4 percent). Only 7.5 percent (465:52 of 6250) of CU's overall minutes were played by freshmen in 2020-21.\n\nFreshmen Time Score Margin\n\n0 freshmen: Never -- --\n\n1 freshmen: 33:45 54-49 +5\n\n2 freshmen: 346:39 651-566 +85\n\n3 freshmen: 143:03 232-245 (-13)\n\n4 freshmen: 35:05 44-60 (-16)\n\n5 freshmen: 1:28 5-2 +3\n\nWe're Jamming!\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns 28 dunks this season and 57 in his career.

That's its second-best mark ever under Greg McDermott (59.0 in 2017-18) and includes a 62.2 percent mark from inside the paint.\n\nDefensively, Creighton is holding the opposition to 43.0 percent shooting from two-point range, the nation's 14th-best figure. That's CU's best mark under McDermott, far surpassing the 45.5 percent mark allowed by the 2012-13 club. Bluejay foes are shooting just 47.5 percent in the paint this season.\n\nNembhard Wins Fourth Freshman Honor\n\nRyan Nembhard was named BIG EAST Freshman of the Week for the fourth time in six weeks, the league announced on Monday, Dec. 20.\n\nNembhard averaged 10.5 points, 6.0 assists and 1.5 rebounds as Creighton went 1-1. He was previously honored on Nov. 15, Nov. 22 and Nov. 29.\n\nThe Aurora, Ontario, Canada native opened his week with seven points, eight assists and his first career blocked shot in a one-point loss against Arizona State. He bounced back with 14 points, four assists and three rebounds in his BIG EAST debut, a 79-59 win vs. No. 9 Villanova.\n\n#1 In The Record Book; #44 In Your Program\n\nRyan Hawkins leads every active player at the Division I level in career rebounds (1,051) and field goals made (820) and is second in points (2,286).\n\nHawkins also ranks in the top 10 among the nation's active Division I players in games played (8th) and double-doubles (6th).\n\nAnd while it's not among the categories the NCAA tracks among active players, it's worth noting that Hawkins owns 100 career games of 10 or more points. The NCAA Division I record in that category is 135, done by former Creighton All-American Doug McDermott.\n\nOnly In 2020-21 (Let's Hope)\n\nThough Creighton's 14 BIG EAST wins last season were three more than any other team in the BIG EAST, the Bluejays were the second seed in the conference tournament since the league decided before the season to go by winning percentage to determine a league champion and seeds.\n\nThe BIG EAST wasn't alone in this. It was one of eight leagues that saw the top team in winning percentage not be the same team that had the most conference wins.\n\nWins Leader Not League Champ, Nationally, in 2020-21\n\nLeague Conf.

No squad has won an outright title after losing the league opener since Notre Dame won the West Division in 2000-01. And no team has won a league outright title in a one-division BIG EAST after losing the league lid-lifter since Georgetown in 1988-89.\n\nYearly League Openers Under Greg McDermott\n\nYear Won (Final W-L) Lost (Final W-L)\n\n2010-11 Illinois St. (10-8)\n\n2011-12 Missouri St. (14-4)\n\n2012-13 Evansville (13-5)\n\n2013-14 Marquette (14-4)\n\n2014-15 Providence (4-14)\n\n2015-16 St. John's (9-9)\n\n2016-17 Seton Hall (10-8)\n\n2017-18 Seton Hall (10-8)\n\n2018-19 Providence (9-9)\n\n2019-20 Marquette (13-5)\n\n2020-21 Marquette (14-6)\n\n2021-22 #9 Villanova (TBD)\n\nBlock Party\n\nAfter owning seven or more blocked shots in a game just nine times in Greg McDermott's first 11 seasons on the Bluejay sideline, Creighton has five contests this winter with at least seven swats.\n\nCreighton is 10-4 all-time under McDermott when blocking seven or more shots, and the four losses have come by a combined 10 points.\n\nCreighton's 5.00 blocked shots per game as a team is its best figure since averaging 6.03 blocks per game in 1984-85.\n\nCreighton is 6-0 this season when blocking six shots or more.\n\nAll Ball\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner ranks third in the BIG EAST with 2.79 blocked shots per game, a figure that ranks as the best by a Bluejay since Benoit Benjamin averaged 5.06 blocks per game in 1984-85.\n\nThough he's got an uphill climb to catch Big Ben, Kalkbrenner is still on track to become the first Bluejay to average more than 2.00 blocks per game since Chad Gallagher (2.19) in 1990-91.\n\nMaking the 7-foot-1 sophomore's accomplishments all the more impressive is that the big man owns 39 blocks but has been called for just 18 fouls. Through games of Jan. 8, that made him one of two players nationally (with Indiana All-American Trayce Jackson-Davis) with at least 35 blocks and 18 or fewer fouls.\n\nKalkbrenner owns 77 career blocked shots. He ranks 11th in Creighton history in that category and is two swats away from a spot in the top 10.\n\nMost Career Blocked Shots (Since 1979-80)\n\nBlk.

Just how rare is that? In Greg McDermott's 12 years on the Creighton sideline, the only Bluejay with multiple games of 5+ blocks in the same season had been Gregory Echenique, who did it in 2010-11 (2x) as well as 2012-13 (4x).\n\nKalkbrenner became the first Bluejay with five swats in consecutive games since Benoit Benjamin did it in six straight games from Jan. 27-Feb. 14, 1985. Benjamin had a streak of 7, 12, 6, 5, 5 and 6 rejections during that stretch.\n\nBenjamin set MVC records that still stand with 411 career blocks and 162 rejections in 1984-85.\n\nKalkbrenner had his third game this season with five swats on Dec. 11 vs. No. 24 BYU, then did it again on Dec. 17 vs. No. 9 Villanova.\n\nStrong League Start Projects To Postseason\n\nCreighton has started 5-2 or better in league play in seven of Greg McDermott's first 11 seasons at the helm.\n\nSix of those teams to start like that reached the NCAA Tournament, while a seventh reached the quarterfinals of the NIT.\n\nEach of Creighton's 15 teams since 1988-89 to start 5-2, 6-1 or 7-0 after seven games in league play have reached the postseason, a stretch that includes 10 NCAA Tournaments and five NIT's.\n\nLast year CU started 6-1 in league play and finished in second place at 14-6 overall in BIG EAST action.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked eighth in the preseason BIG EAST Conference poll that was selected via a vote of league coaches.\n\nVillanova was a unanimous selection to win the league, with Connecticut and Xavier finishing second and third, respectively. St. John's is fourth, followed by Seton Hall, Butler, Providence and Creighton. Rounding out the poll are Marquette, Georgetown and DePaul.\n\nVillanova standout Collin Gillespie was named Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year, and was joined on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Team by Nate Watson (Providence), Julian Champagnie (St. John's), Jared Rhoden (Seton Hall), Paul Scruggs (Xavier) and Zach Freemantle (Xavier).\n\nCreighton is the only school in the league that has met or exceeded its preseason BIG EAST prognostication every year since joining the league, as seen below:\n\nCreighton's BIG EAST Preseason Poll History\n\nYear Preseason Actual Preseason All-BIG EAST\n\n2013-14 3rd 2nd Doug McDermott (1st)\n\n2014-15 9th T-9th -\n\n2015-16 9th 6th -\n\n2016-17 3rd T-3rd Maurice Watson Jr. (1st); Marcus Foster (HM)\n\n2017-18 5th T-3rd Marcus Foster (1st); Khyri Thomas (HM)\n\n2018-19 9th T-3rd Martin Krampelj (HM)\n\n2019-20 7th T-1st Ty-Shon Alexander (1st)\n\n2020-21 2nd 2nd Marcus Zegarowski (1st); Mitch Ballock (2nd)\n\nLooking At McDermott's Home Run\n\nThe Dec. 17 win vs. No. 9 Villanova marked Greg McDermott's 200th home game as head coach at Creighton.\n\nHe's currently 162-38 on the Bluejay sideline at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nWins On Wins on Wins\n\nCreighton's Nov. 21 loss vs. Colorado State was the first time in the six-year college career of Ryan Hawkins that one of his teams lost on a neutral floor. The Northwest Missouri State transfer is now 40-1 on neutral sites when you include his 3-1 mark this year.\n\nHe enters Tuesday's game vs. Providence with a team record of 169-12 (.934) at all sites, and has never lost consecutive games at the college level.\n\nCU's January 1st win at Marquette marked the 100th conference game of Hawkins' college career. He's currently 94-7 in those games.\n\nHawkins Scores 25\n\nRyan Hawkins scored 25 points vs. No. 19 Iowa State. It was the 96th time in his career that the Atlantic, Iowa native scored in double-figures, and 46th time he's scored 20 points or more in a game.\n\nHawkins' 25 points were the most by a Bluejay in any game this season, and most by any CU player against a top-25 team since Marcus Zegarowski scored 25 points in an 86-70 win vs. No. 5 Villanova on Feb. 13, 2021.\n\nHawkins then scored 25 points against No. 24 BYU in his next outing, making him the first Bluejay with back-to-back games of 25 or more points since Marcus Foster had consecutive 29 point efforts on Feb. 7 & 10, 2018.\n\nHawkins is the first Bluejay with multiple games of 25+ points vs. top-25 teams in the same season since Ty-Shon Alexander in 2018-19. Marcus Foster in 2017-18 is the last person with three such games in a season.\n\nThe Ryan Express\n\nCreighton has started three players with the first name of Ryan in each game this winter, as Ryan Nembhard, Ryan Hawkins and Ryan Kalkbrenner are all entrenched as starters. Those three men are also CU's top three scorers.\n\nIn the Dec. 11 win vs. No. 24 BYU, Nembhard, Hawkins and Kalkbrenner combined for 56 points, 21 rebounds and seven blocked shots.\n\nFor the season, the \"Ryan Express\" has contributed 70.0 percent of Creighton's blocked shots, 53.7 percent of its points, 47.7 percent of its assists, 61.2 percent of its rebounds grabbed and 43.5 percent of its steals.\n\nCreighton had not started multiple players with the same first name in the same regular-season game since Nov. 18, 2006, when both Nick Porter and Nick Bahe started against Nebraska.\n\nCreighton has not had a season in which three players with the same first name all started at least once in the regular-season since at least 1980.\n\nWith so many men named Ryan (not to mention assistant coach Ryan Miller), the Bluejay staff has gone to referring to Hawkins as \"Hawk\", the 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner as \"Big Ryan\" and Nembhard as \"R2\", in honor of his uniform number, as well as \"Coach Miller\".\n\nElite Company For Hawkins\n\nIn 1991 when Creighton was in the Missouri Valley Conference, former Bluejay Bob Harstad (along with Oscar Robertson, Larry Bird and Xavier McDaniel) was one the answers to the trivia question of \"Who are the only four players in MVC history with 2,000 career points and 1,000 career rebounds\"?\n\nYears later, Doug McDermott finished his career with 3,150 points and 1,088 rebounds, though not all those rebounds came while playing within The Valley.\n\nSo what's the point, you're asking? Creighton senior Ryan Hawkins owns 2,286 career points and 1,051 career rebounds, though the majority of his totals were accumulated at the Division II level at Northwest Missouri State.\n\nEntering this season, only 117 players in NCAA history have achieved 2,000 points and 1,000 points at the Division I level.\n\nA Good Start\n\nHere's a look at how Creighton has done statistically after 14 games under Greg McDermott. Notably, the Bluejays have been 9-5 or better each campaign.\n\nCreighton Stats Through 14 Games, Since 2010-11\n\nYear W-L FG% 3FG% FT% PPG Opp PPG\n\n2021-22 10-4 .469 .301 .692 70.4 65.9\n\n2020-21 10-4 .490 .367 .662 81.1 69.4\n\n2019-20 12-2 .474 .375 .709 79.9 68.4\n\n2018-19 10-4 .520 .448 .638 84.7 73.9\n\n2017-18 11-3 .514 .379 .742 91.1 72.4\n\n2016-17 13-1 .536 .431 .674 88.4 72.6\n\n2015-16 10-4 .503 .396 .675 86.9 74.8\n\n2014-15 9-5 .427 .342 .746 70.8 64.6\n\n2013-14 12-2 .483 .426 .766 81.5 63.9\n\n2012-13 13-1 .509 .433 .759 79.5 62.1\n\n2011-12 12-2 .506 .451 .698 82.6 68.4\n\n2010-11 10-4 .433 .319 .771 67.5 61.9\n\nSpeaking of Defense\n\nCreighton had nine blocked shots on Nov. 27 vs. SIUE, tying its most in any game in Greg McDermott's 12 seasons. CU also had nine rejections on Feb. 13, 2018 vs. Division II Bemidji State. The nine swats were CU's most against a Division I foe since also posting nine at Evansville on Jan. 3, 2010.\n\nOf Creighton's nine blocks, eight came in the second half. Seven of those came in the final 15 minutes, when SIUE went just 2-of-16 from the floor.\n\nAlso noteworthy was CU's defense beyond the arc. SIUE made just 1-of-15 three-point tries, tying the fewest trifectas made by a Bluejay opponent under McDermott. It was the fifth time it had happened, and first occasion since No. 5 Xavier shot 1-of-21 on Feb. 9, 2016.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 25 victories since the start of the 2010-11 season after trailing by double-figures at some point, including two this season. Twelve of those 25 comebacks have come away from home.\n\nCreighton's comeback from 16 points down vs. SIUE on Nov. 27 was its biggest since rallying from 16 points down at Seton Hall on Jan. 27th.\n\nIf you're curious, CU's largest comeback win since 2000 came on Jan. 28, 2006, when the Jays trailed 25-6 early before rallying to beat Wichita State on a buzzer-beater by Anthony Tolliver.\n\nCU's Double-Digit Comebacks Since 2010-11\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n16 at Seton Hall 01/27/21\n\n16 SIU Edwardsville 11/27/21\n\n15 Arkansas-Pine Bluff 11/09/21\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n13 #22 Xavier 12/23/20\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n12 at DePaul 01/17/16\n\n12 East Tennessee State 11/11/18\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n11 vs. Ole Miss 11/21/16\n\n11 vs. Connecticut 03/12/21\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\n10 St. John's 01/03/18\n\n10 at DePaul 02/07/18\n\n10 Bemidji State 02/13/18\n\nAt The Buzzer!\n\nRyan Nembhard drove the length of the court in the final 5.2 seconds to sink a floater as time expired to give Creighton a 66-64 win vs. Southern Illinois on Nov. 22 in the third-place game of the Paradise Jam.\n\nIronically enough, the game-ending play was installed several years ago by former Bluejay assistant Paul Lusk, himself a Southern Illinois grad.\n\nThe basket was Creighton's first go-ahead shot as time expired since Booker Woodfox beat Wichita State in the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament quarterfinals on March 6, 2009.\n\nPrior to Woodfox, Creighton's last previous buzzer-beater had also come against Wichita State, as Anthony Tolliver's shot from the right baseline beat Wichita State on Jan. 28, 2006.\n\nNate Funk also hit a buzzer-beater to beat Greg McDermott's Northern Iowa team on Jan. 15, 2005 in Cedar Falls.\n\nShots by those four men remain the only game-winning buzzer-beaters by Creighton since the start of the 1999-2000 season.\n\nFive Threats To Score\n\nAll five Creighton starters are averaging at least 8.1 points per game this season, a fact made all the more impressive when you consider that these men owned a total of ZERO career starts as a Bluejay entering this winter.\n\nCreighton has won 22 straight games when five or more players have 10 points or more.\n\nNembhard's Big Day\n\nPlaying his first collegiate road game, freshman point guard Ryan Nembhard thrived in a hostile environment in Lincoln. The Canadian native had 22 points, five rebounds and five assists.\n\nSince Greg McDermott was hired in 2010, the only other Bluejays with a 20/5/5 game were Mitch Ballock (1), Marcus Foster (3), Grant Gibbs (1), Doug McDermott (2), Khyri Thomas (2), Maurice Watson Jr. (2) and Marcus Zegarowski (3).\n\nNembhard is CU's first freshman with a 20/5/5 line since at least 1981-82.\n\nNembhard's 22 points were the most by a Bluejay of any year in their first game vs. Nebraska since at least 1980.\n\nNembhard Earns All-Tourney Honors\n\nRyan Nembhard earned All-Tournament Team honors at the Paradise Jam after averaging 12.3 points, 4.7 assists, 3.0 rebounds and 2.3 steals in three games.\n\nNembhard shot 55.6 percent from the field, 50 percent from three-point range and 60 percent from the line and made a shot at the buzzer vs. Southern Illinois in the third-place game.\n\nHe is CU's first true freshman to pick up All-Tournament Team honors at any event since Doug McDermott was named to the Global Sports Hy-Vee Challenge All-Tournament Team in 2010.\n\nHawk Talk\n\nRyan Hawkins finished with 15 points, 10 rebounds and five assists on Nov. 16 at Nebraska. It was just the fourth 15/10/5 game in Greg McDermott's 12 seasons at Creighton, and first since Khyri Thomas had 24 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a Nov. 15, 2017 Gavitt Tipoff Games win at Northwestern.\n\nThe only others with a 15/10/5 game under McDermott were Austin Chatman (17 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists vs. Oklahoma on Nov. 19, 2014) and Doug McDermott (30 points, 10 rebounds, 5 assists at Seton Hall on Jan. 4, 2014).\n\nHawkins' performance was CU's first 15/10/5 line without a turnover since at least 1980-81.\n\nLike A Hawk\n\nRyan Hawkins had 10 or more rebounds in each of CU's first three games. He's the first Bluejay to do that to start a season since Benoit Benjamin's streak of 27 consecutive double-figure rebounding games to open his junior campaign in 1984-85.\n\nHawkins owns 41 games with 10 or more rebounds in his college career.\n\nWinning With Defense\n\nCreighton's made its reputation on the offensive side with its \"Let It Fly\" philosophy, but the Bluejays have won thanks in large part to their defense so far this season.\n\nCreighton held each of its first four opponents under 40 percent from the field for the first time since at least 1980-81.\n\nCreighton is holding teams to 39.5 percent shooting this season, which would also be the program's best mark in more than 40 years.\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nIn 315 games at CHI Health Center Omaha all-time, Creighton has not trailed in 85 of those contests, a staggering 27.0 percent of the time.\n\nUnder Greg McDermott at home, Creighton is\n\n162-38 and hasn't trailed in 60 of those games. He owns an 91-8 record vs. non-conference teams at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nAssists 'R' Us\n\nRyan Nembhard's 10 assists in CU's season-opener were the most by a Bluejay freshman in any game since Marcus Zegarowski had 10 on March 9, 2018 vs. DePaul. He was the nation's ONLY freshman with 10+ assists on the opening night of the college basketball season.\n\nPrior to Nembhard, no Bluejay (of any year) had dished 10 or more assists in a season-opener since Edward St. Fleur on Nov. 22, 1996 at Wyoming.\n\nMaking An Entrance\n\nArthur Kaluma (15) and Ryan Nembhard (15) became CU's first true freshmen to debut with 10 points or more since Khyri Thomas had 18 points vs. Texas Southern in 2015.\n\nNembhard (15 pts., 10 ast.) and Ryan Hawkins (16 pts., 11 reb.) were the first Bluejays since at least 1980 with double-doubles in the season-opener of their debut campaign. No CU player (of any year) had started the season with a double-double since Will Artino (14 pts., 10 reb.) in 2014-15 vs. Central Arkansas.\n\nKaluma's eight rebounds were the most by a true freshman in the regular-season opener since Martin Krampelj in 2015 and the most by any Bluejay freshman since redshirt freshman Justin Patton snared eight rebounds in his 2016 debut.\n\nKaluma had four blocked shots on Nov. 9 vs. UAPB. The last previous Bluejay newcomer with multiple blocked shots in a season-opener? That'd be Artino on Nov. 11, 2011 vs. North Carolina A&T. Kaluma's four swats were the most by any Bluejay (of any year) on Opening Day since Jeffrey Day had five swats vs. Alcorn State to open the 2004-05 campaign..\n\nKaluma (15 & 8) became Creighton's second freshman since at least 1973 to debut with 15+ points and 5+ rebounds, joining Doug McDermott (16 & 7) in 2010.\n\nRyan Hawkins grabbed 11 rebounds vs. Arkansas-Pine Bluff, the most by a Bluejay since Damien Jefferson had 12 in 2018. Other than Jefferson, no one's had more than 11 rebounds in their CU debut since Cyril Baptiste snared 17 caroms in 1969. When Hawkins followed with 10 rebounds vs. Kennesaw State, he became CU's first player (of any year) with 10+ rebounds in CU's first two games since Doug Swenson in 1998-99.\n\nFreshman Starts Almost Unheard Of\n\nBetween 1992-93 and 2020-21, only four true freshmen started Creighton's regular-season opener. Then on Nov. 9 vs. Arkansas-Pine Bluff, both Ryan Nembhard and Arthur Kaluma got the nod on opening night. Nembhard had 15 points and 10 assists while Kaluma owned 15 points, eight rebounds and four blocks.\n\nThis season marked the first time Creighton started two true freshmen in a regular-season opener since 1991-92 (Eric Dantzler and Mike Amos).\n\nAbout the other true freshmen to start...\n\nRyan Sears did so in 1997-98. The point guard would go on to start all 124 games of his CU career and remains the program's all-time career assist (570) and steals (283) leader.\n\nDoug McDermott did so in 2010-11, and he went on to start all 145 games of his career. He would graduate as the fifth-leading scorer in NCAA history with 3,150 career points and is the only three-time First Team All-American since 1986. He now plays for the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nKhyri Thomas got a start in 2015-16 and remained in CU's starting five each of his first 24 games, and 96-of-102 career contests with the Jays. He has spent parts of the past three seasons in the NBA.\n\nShereef Mitchell joined this elite group in 2019-20 when he got the starting nod against Kennesaw State. Mitchell finished with eight points, six rebounds, three assists and three steals in 28 minutes of work.\n\nTop-10 Class\n\nCreighton signed four top-100 players en route to inking the No. 7 recruiting class in the country, per 247Sports. That also ranks as the best class in the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nHere's how the nation's top-10 classes shake out:\n\n1. Memphis\n\n2. Michigan\n\n3. Gonzaga\n\n4. Tennessee\n\n5. Duke\n\n6. LSU\n\n7. Creighton\n\n8. Florida State\n\n9. Connecticut\n\n10. Kentucky\n\nRelease, Rotation, Splash, Repeat\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in 927 straight games. The streak is the nation's 14th-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last game without a three-pointer came at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993, when the Jays were 0-for-5. Creighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (1/9)\n\nRk.

That streak was in serious jeopardy on Opening Day this season as CU missed its first 14 three-point tries before a man named Trey (Alexander) extended the streak.\n\nSince the start of the 2019-20 season, the Bluejays are 40-6 when making eight or more three-pointers, compared to a 14-13 mark when making seven treys or fewer.\n\nTeam 3FG Made During Creighton's 3-Point Streak\n\n1: 5 times 2: 15 times 3: 32 times\n\n4: 71 times 5: 99 times 6: 99 times\n\n7: 139 times 8: 116 times 9: 89 times\n\n10: 77 times 11: 53 times 12: 49 times\n\n13: 44 times 14: 18 times 15: 7 times\n\n16: 7 times 17: 3 times 19: 1 time\n\n20: 1 time 21: 1 time 22: 1 time\n\nMy Name Is...\n\nOnly five men who played for Creighton last season are back this winter, and none of them averaged more than 15 minutes per game.\n\nPer research by TCU, Creighton's 18.0 percent of minutes returning ranks third-lowest among all teams nationally, and is the least among all teams from the BIG EAST or a Power 5 Conference.\n\nLowest Percentage of Minutes Returning\n\nSchool Pct. of Minutes Returning\n\nTennessee-Martin 0.0\n\nPortland 8.5\n\nCreighton 18.0\n\nMissouri 19.7\n\nDuquesne 23.2\n\nIowa State 25.1\n\nRobert Morris 26.3\n\nBoston College 27.6\n\nSouth Alabama 28.6\n\nTCU 29.2\n\nWho's Back?\n\nWith Creighton returning only five of the 15 men who appeared in a game last season, it's no surprise that much of the production from 2020-21 is also gone.

Last year he with Indiana he averaged a career-high 13.6 points per game.\n\nOther famous Bluejays to play in the NBA in the past include Paul Silas, Kyle Korver, Benoit Benjamin and Anthony Tolliver.\n\nWho Are These Guys?\n\nFor the first time since at least 1980-81, Creighton will not return any of its five starters as Mitch Ballock, Christian Bishop, Damien Jefferson, Denzel Mahoney and Marcus Zegarowski are all gone after combining to make 152-of-155 possible starts last season.\n\nIn fact, there's only been four previous times in the last 40 years that just one starter has returned. Those four occurrences came in 1985-86 (went 12-16), 2007-08 (22-11), 2014-15 (14-19) and\n\n2015-16 (20-15).\n\nShereef Mitchell started two games last season when Zegarowski was injured, and no other active Bluejay had ever started a game for CU prior to CU's Nov. 9 season-opener. In the previous 40 seasons, Creighton's always returned players who combined for at least 40 starts in the previous season.\n\nReturning Returning Starts Final\n\nYear Starters From Previous Year W-L\n\n2021-22 0 2 ? ? ?\n\n2020-21 5 124 22-9\n\n2019-20 4 136 24-7\n\n2018-19 2 57 20-15\n\n2017-18 2 72 21-12\n\n2016-17 4 130 25-10\n\n2015-16 1 64 20-15\n\n2014-15 1 49 14-19\n\n2013-14 4 144 27-8\n\n2012-13 4 140 28-8\n\n2011-12 3 101 29-6\n\n2010-11 4 123 23-16\n\n2009-10 3 106 18-16\n\n2008-09 3 83 27-8\n\n2007-08 1 44 22-11\n\n2006-07 4 120 22-11\n\n2005-06 4 134 20-10\n\n2004-05 2 58 23-11\n\n2003-04 3 101 20-9\n\n2002-03 5 159 29-5\n\n2001-02 2 65 23-9\n\n2000-01 3 90 24-8\n\n1999-00 3 84 23-10\n\n1998-99 3 84 22-9\n\n1997-98 4 72 18-10\n\n1996-97 4 126 15-15\n\n1995-96 4 100 14-15\n\n1994-95 2 52 7-19\n\n1993-94 3 73 7-22\n\n1992-93 2 64 8-18\n\n1991-92 2 51 9-19\n\n1990-91 4 132 24-8\n\n1989-90 4 127 21-12\n\n1988-89 4 123 20-11\n\n1987-88 3 83 16-16\n\n1986-87 2 65 9-19\n\n1985-86 1 48 12-16\n\n1984-85 4 124 20-12\n\n1983-84 3 72 17-14\n\n1982-83 3 77 8-19\n\n1981-82 2 78 7-20\n\n1980-81 4 112 21-9\n\nIn Search Of 20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton had 22 wins last season, its sixth consecutive campaign with 20 or more victories.\n\nOnly six teams have won 20 games or more in each of the previous six seasons: Belmont, Creighton, Gonzaga, Houston, Kansas and Oregon.\n\n21 of 23 Seasons With 20 Wins\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 21 of the last 23 seasons (entering 2021-22), a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust two schools have had 20 or more wins each of the last 23 years: Gonzaga and Kansas.
