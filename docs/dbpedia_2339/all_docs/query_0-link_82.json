        "text": "Saint Mary's Athletics / Tod Fierner\n\nMen's Basketball 2/19/2024 12:00:00 PM\n\nMBB | No. 18 Gaels Push For Record 13th and 14th Consecutive Conference Victories Over San Francisco and San Diego\n\nMORAGA, Calif. — Saint Mary's Men's Basketball continues to look like top-dog in the WCC. The Gaels have not lost a conference game this season, and have won 13 in a row overall. After having Saturday off, the Gaels focus shifts to a Tuesday night matchup at home against San Francisco, followed by a home Saturday night showdown with San Diego. The Gaels program record for consecutive conference wins is 13 in a row back in 2017-18. Saint Mary's will have a chance to tie and potentially break that record this season.\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nSaint Mary's Gaels vs. San Francisco Dons\n\nTuesday, February 20 at 8 PM\n\nUCU Pavilion – Moraga, Calif.\n\nWATCH | LISTEN | LIVE STATS\n\nSaint Mary's Gaels vs. San Diego Toreros\n\nSaturday, February 24 at 7 PM\n\nUCU Pavilion – Moraga, Calif.\n\nWATCH | LISTEN | LIVE STATS\n\nOFFENSIVE EXPLOSION\n\nThe Gaels put up 103 points against the Pepperdine Waves in their last contest. For the first time all season, every player who touched the court scored. Augustas Marciulionis led the way with a career-high 28 points to go along with six assists and no turnovers en route to the 103-59 victory. For the sixth time this season, Saint Mary's tallied at least 20 assists, going 6-0 in those instances. The 103 points were the second most by the Gaels in a regulation WCC contest since 1996. It was only the third time that the Gaels reached triple digits against a WCC foe in a regulation game since 1996.\n\nABOUT THE DONS\n\nSan Francisco has joined Saint Mary's and Gonzaga to make up a \"Big Three\" in the WCC this season. The Dons share a 10-2 conference record with Gonzaga and are 21-6 overall, riding a six game winning streak. Second year Head Coach Chris Gerlufsen has now marked back-to-back 20+ win seasons at the helm of the Dons, making them an instant challenger within the conference. Jonathan Mogbo is the name to know when looking at the Dons. The Missouri State transfer has had a first season in San Francisco to remember, averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds per contest, and shooting 66.7% from the field, good for third in the nation. Back court mates Marcus Williams and Malik Thomas are both also averaging double digit scoring numbers per contest. With a team field goal percentage of 49.4%, San Francisco ranks 13th in the country in that stat. In their meeting in San Francisco earlier this year, the Gaels used a 26-12 run to get early separation in what was an eventual 77-60 victory. The Dons shot a season low 11.8% from three and had a season low 24 rebounds. The Dons lead the all-time series 101-89, but the Gaels have won their last nine meetings, and their last 19 meetings at UCU Pavilion.\n\nABOUT THE TOREROS\n\nThe Gaels first opponent in this epic 12 game conference winning streak, the Toreros have put together a solid season thus far, sitting at 16-12 overall and 6-7, good for fifth in the WCC. The Toreros fell to Santa Clara in their last contest on Saturday, and will not play again until their showdown with the Gaels this upcoming Saturday. Second year Head Coach Steve Lavin has certainly righted the ship after an 11 win campaign in his first season at USD. The trio of Wayne McKinney, Deuce Turner and PJ Hayes combine to score more than 40 points per game, with all three shooting better than 35% from three. The Gaels bested the Toreros on the road back on January 4, 81-70, despite 34 points from Deuce Turner. The Gaels forced San Diego into 19 turnovers, and held them to a season-low 24 rebounds in that matchup. The Gaels lead the all-time series 60-36, and have not lost to the Toreros since 2014.\n\nDON'T MISS OUT ON HOME MEN'S BASKETBALL ACTION.
