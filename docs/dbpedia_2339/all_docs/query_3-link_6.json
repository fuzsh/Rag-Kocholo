        "text": "You remember where Rick Barnes was a year ago?\n\nYou can bet Rick Barnes does.\n\nYou look for him now, you’ll see Barnes and his Texas Longhorns ranked among the top 10 or 15 teams by the various preseason college basketball publications, including the Sporting News College Basketball yearbook, which has the Horns No. 12.\n\nThis is because the team returns the key contributors from a group that went 24-11, tied for third in the Big 12 Conference and advanced in the NCAA Tournament. There’s also the entry of big forward Myles Turner, a top-10 prospect in the 2014 recruiting class, into the program.\n\nBut last fall Texas wasn’t ranked by anybody. The Longhorns were coming off a 16-18 season, several productive players had transferred during the offseason and there were suggestions Barnes’ successful tenure in Austin might be nearing its end.\n\nKnow how many capable college basketball coaches and successful programs are looking to have a bounce-back year like Barnes, hoping to rebound from a tough or disappointing season to excel in 2014-15?\n\nA lot, and you know their names well.\n\n1. Anthony Grant, Alabama\n\nRecord at school: 99-71\n\n'13-14 record: 13-19\n\nGrant’s recent experience with the Crimson Tide is proof you can schedule yourself into a mess. The Tide played six high-major opponents in non-league games last season, plus Wichita State. The Tide went 1-6 in those seven difficult games, and threw in a triple-overtime loss to Drexel just to make the whole thing as miserable as possible. Four of the losses were by five or fewer points.\n\nUnless you think your league is absolute garbage, or your team is unassailable, that’s far too heavy a load.\n\nAlabama buckled under a similar burden in 2012-13, finishing 21-12 in the regular season and being hustled off to the NIT, and this time the team just broke.\n\nLearning to win is a process, which is why those “buy” games most big-timers play aren’t as empty as critics like to suggest.\n\nThe schedule for this season again is overly challenging, including a trip to the CBE Hall of Fame Classic and road trips to Xavier and Wichita State. On top of that, leading scorer Trevor Releford completed his career after averaging 18.8 points. It’s not going to be easy to reverse last year’s record.\n\n2. Tom Pecora, Fordham\n\nRecord at school: 34-85\n\n'13-14 record: 10-21\n\nPecora proved beyond a reasonable doubt he is a capable head coach during his tenure at Fordham, delivering four 20-win seasons in his final six years and six times recording double-digit victories in the Colonial Athletic Association. And then Pecora made the dangerous decision to accept the single worst major coaching job in Division I.\n\nWe call it a “major” job grudgingly; most members of the Atlantic 10 operate at that level. Fordham never really has.\n\nThe Rams once were a very fine mid- to low-major program, particularly when they belonged to the Patriot League. Then Fordham and the A-10 collectively made the foolish decision that merely being stationed in the New York metropolitan area meant the school could thrive on a wider stage.\n\nSince the move, Fordham has had one winning season. The move happened 19 seasons ago. Hofstra isn’t likely to double that total this season, but it wouldn’t hurt to come close.\n\n3. Mark Fox, Georgia\n\nRecord at school: 85-77\n\n'13-14 record: 20-14\n\nA funny thing happened on the way to the hot seat: Fox reminded everyone who’d doubted him that his work at Nevada was no fluke.\n\nAt the start of last season, his fifth with the Bulldogs, Fox had endured three losing seasons in four tries. But his UGa teams never won fewer than 14 games, and never lost more than 17. This wasn’t incompetence. This was rebuilding.\n\nOne essential factor for the Bulldogs last season was at last transforming Stegeman Coliseum into a fortress. They went 15-3 in home games, even though Georgia fans weren’t all that much help; average attendance was nearly 4,000 below capacity. The team periodically struggled to score, and there’s no obvious agent toward changing that aside from experience and confidence.\n\nLike their friends across the border in Alabama, though, the Bulldogs have a schedule that is more challenging than it needs to be.\n\n4. Brian Gregory, Georgia Tech\n\nRecord at school: 43-52\n\n'13-14 record: 16-17\n\nIf you’re a follower of basketball statistician Ken Pomeroy, you know that one of the factors in his rating system is labeled: luck. I don’t even want to know how that is quantified, although I’m sure if you manage to secure the winning numbers in a Mega Millions drawing, you qualify for a positive rating.\n\nHowever, when I see that Georgia Tech is ranked 191st in luck among the 351 Division I teams, I figure KenPom might be onto something.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets have had horrible luck under Gregory, most obviously in the form of last season’s injury to sophomore big guy Robert Carter. Tech was a solid 9-4 when he was injured in a December win over Charlotte; the Jackets went 3-7 in the 10 games he missed. And then after the team closed with three victories in the final four games, including an upset of Syracuse, Carter transferred. So yeah: bad luck.\n\nTech will try to recover with only junior Marcus Georges-Hunt returning among last season’s top six scorers. Most of the rest of the rotation will be formed from transfers and hopefuls.\n\nThis week, there was the good news that Maryland transfer Charles Mitchell would be eligible immediately, even though the Jackets still got the short end of that trade. But as the ACC strengthens and deepens, bad luck will be tougher to overcome.\n\n5. Tom Crean, Indiana\n\nRecord at school: 101-97\n\n'13-14 record: 17-15\n\nCrean’s rapid rebuild of the empty locker room he inherited hit a brick wall last season for a reason that is tough for the average Hoosier to comprehend: not enough shooters.\n\nPoint guard Yogi Ferrell was terrific from long range, but that was just one more responsibility for an already overburdened player. Having lost two top-five NBA draft picks from the year before, IU fell from No. 3 in the nation in offensive efficiency to No. 127. And since then, IU lost another high NBA draft pick, one-and-done freshman Noah Vonleh.\n\nCrean has been unfairly punished by critics since the very start of his tenure for the mess that Indiana basketball was when he arrived. It would help generate momentum if this team were to overachieve a bit, to evince the competitive spirit of his early, overmatched IU teams. Because there are enough players to win, although IU — with games against SMU, Louisville, Pitt and Georgetown — has signed up for a difficult trek.\n\n6. Matt Painter, Purdue\n\nRecord at school: 191-112\n\n'13-14 record: 15-17\n\nAs things have regressed the past few seasons at Purdue, Painter has become the ideal example for those who believe every coach should accept whatever new job is offered him.\n\n“Should have taken Mizzou,” they’ll say. Well, yeah, if he knew his next batch of teams would be mediocre. Painter surely doesn’t think that way, never has.\n\nFrom his second season with the Boilermakers to the seventh, they topped the 20-win mark every time and reached the NCAA Tournament, including two trips to the Sweet 16. The past two teams have been younger, but also a lot less like Purdue.\n\nAt 26-8 in 2010-11 — yeah, that was the team that led to the Missouri offer — Purdue ranked No. 20 in defensive efficiency. Last year, it was 100.\n\nThere is hope for the Boilers in their young players. The sophomore class featuring Kendall Stephens, Bryson Scott and Basil Smotherman didn’t play a ton last year — perhaps didn’t play enough – but showed promise. It’s not clear whether Scott is a Big Ten-level point guard, but there was a point when it wasn’t clear Wisconsin’s Traveon Jackson was, either. Look how that turned out.\n\n7. Steve Lavin, St. John's\n\nRecord at school: 71-60\n\n'13-14 record: 20-13\n\nWhat St. John’s needs is what Rysheed Jordan has. All of it, or at least all of the good stuff. His freshman season was impacted by personal challenges — his aunt being murdered, his mother’s illness — that took him away from the team briefly and impacted his performance pretty much throughout.\n\nAs well, there was his own immaturity, be it on the court (his dreadful decision-making in the Big East opener against Xavier) or off (suspended for the team’s opener just two hours before tip-off). Oh, but there is something there. If you watched him play, you know there is.\n\nSt. John’s has perimeter scorers in D’Angelo Harrison and Phil Greene, and there are enough bodies to compose a passable frontcourt. Jordan could be exceptional, the sort of player who elevates a team with promise into a team with purpose.\n\nThe Red Storm had both Jakarr Sampson and Orlando Sanchez leave after last season to give the NBA a try, and neither was drafted. That is not a good look. When a program is turning its pro prospects into pros, it generally is winning big. Jordan could be that sort of player and influence.\n\n8. Kevin Willard, Seton Hall\n\nRecord at school: 66-66\n\n'13-14 record: 17-17\n\nIt is perceived that Willard is counting big on freshman guard Isaiah Whitehead, but if anyone is expecting him to turn a .500 squad into an NCAA Tournament team they’ve probably not seen him play. But Whitehead can be very, very good, and the best news is that he’ll be surrounded by talented guards. A defense aiming itself at Whitehead will be ignoring what backcourt partners Sterling Gibbs and Jaren Sina can offer.\n\nIf Willard wants to push the Pirates forward beyond adding a talented scorer, he’s got to find a way to convince them to play better at home no matter what the atmosphere might be.\n\nThey averaged a little more than 6,300 a game in an arena that holds about three times that. OK. But during the program’s early 90s glory days, the Pirates were a terror in the same circumstances.\n\nIt’s hard to be successful when you’re winning only 56 percent of your home games. Even if the crowd doesn’t scare visitors, a confident team can.\n\n9. Lorenzo Romar, Washington\n\nRecord at school: 254-144\n\n'13-14 record: 17-15\n\nFrom 2009-12, UW won a conference regular-season or tournament championship every year. Beginning in 2011, the Huskies appeared in the NCAA Tournament six times in eight years. Three times in that stretch they reached the Sweet 16. Over the past two seasons, however, the program is a combined four games over .500.\n\nHas the talent in the Seattle area, which provided so much to the Huskies for so long, dwindled a bit? Perhaps. And a few of the area’s gems have chosen to play elsewhere.\n\nFollowing a knee injury to 6-10 Jernard Jarreau that cost him nearly the entire season, last year’s team didn’t have enough to go with the backcourt of C.J. Wilcox and Nigel Williams-Goss, and now Wilcox is gone.\n\nBut UW has some serious size with 6-11 Robert Upshaw transferring in from Fresno State, and a great point guard like Williams-Goss can make a lot of guys look better, though.\n\n10. Bob Huggins, West Virginia\n\nRecord at school: 150-91\n\n'13-14 record: 17-16\n\nWhy do I get the feeling that if West Virginia still were in the Big East, and if the Big East still were the Big East, that West Virginia wouldn’t all of a sudden be finding itself in such an intimate dance with the .500 mark?\n\nThe Mountaineers are 30-35 since heading west to the Big 12, and one of the players most capable of fixing that, wing Eron Harris, took off following a sparkling sophomore season and transferred to Michigan State.\n\nHuggins is one of the great coaches of the past quarter century. If he keeps at it to age 65, he’ll become one of the few college coaches to top the 800-win mark. But last year’s team struggled to defend, and that almost never has occurred during Huggins’ three decades as a college coach.\n\nThe players who left weren’t always responsive to Huggins’ demands, which is why it is less important to cite the resumes of the players who’ll enter the WVU rotation and more a matter of whether they’ll listen to their coach.\n\nPoint guard Juwan Staten did, after a transition period. He became one of the Big 12’s best players. He’ll likely be again. He’ll need some company."
