        "text": "In S.F., Steve Kroner reported former St. John's and UCLA men's basketball coach Steve Lavin \"has joined Pac-12 Networks as a basketball game and studio analyst.\" The former ESPN analyst also will \"work for Fox and Fox Sports 1 this season, focusing on Big East coverage\" (S.F. CHRONICLE, 9/18). In Arizona, Bruce Pascoe noted the \"ever-loquacious Lavin will join a team of Pac-12 analysts\" that includes Kevin O'Neill, Mike Montgomery, Don MacLean and Bill Walton (ARIZONA DAILY STAR, 9/19).\n\nSTRONG VOICE: GOLFWEEK.com's Martin Kaufmann wrote the best of what viewers heard on Day 2 of Golf Channel's coverage of the Solheim Cup \"came from Karen Stupples.\" During Saturday’s morning foursomes, Stupples \"served as lead analyst,\" where she had \"so many sharp comments on players and the format.\" Stupples was \"particularly good on the subject of Angela Stanford’s poor Solheim Cup record.\" She \"revisited the subject not once, but twice, throughout the morning matches, and each time her observations got more pointed\" (GOLFWEEK.com, 9/20).\n\nPLAYING THROUGH AN INJURY: In Dallas, Barry Horn noted MLB Rangers radio play-by-play announcer Eric Nadel, who missed three games with a detached retina in his left eye, \"is still calling in pain.\" Nadel underwent surgery last Saturday, \"missed three games and was back at work Tuesday night.\" He is \"using an eye patch intermittently and relying more than he customarily does on a TV monitor\" (DALLAS MORNING NEWS, 9/20)."
