        "text": "OXFORD, Miss. -- Game time for Ole Miss' NIT second-round meeting at Clemson on Monday has been set for 6 p.m. CT at Littlejohn Coliseum and will be televised nationally on ESPN. Announcers will be Brad Nessler on play-by-play and Steve Lavin on color.\n\nMonday's winner will face the victor of the Syracuse-San Diego State encounter on Wednesday with the higher seed hosting.\n\nOle Miss trails the all-time series with Clemson 2-1, and the schools are matched up in the NIT for the second time. The last meeting between the two was a 53-49 Rebel victory on the Tigers' court in the first round of the 1982 tourney.\n\nThe South Region top seed, Clemson (22-10) enters Monday's game with a 15-0 mark against non-conference teams. This year's 22 wins is the most since the team finished 23-10 during the 1996-97 season. The Tigers are led in scoring by K.C. Rivers, who has a 13.3 scoring average. He had one of his top games as a Clemson player in Wednesday's win over East Tennessee State when he had 17 points and a career high 14 rebounds. Trevor Booker also had a double-double against ETSU with 11 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nWith a 73-59 first-round triumph over Appalachian State Wednesday, Ole Miss (21-12) earned its first postseason win since reaching the round of 16 in the 2001 NCAA tournament. The Rebels' 21 victories is also the most since that season.\n\nMonday's game will mark Ole Miss' second of the year on ESPN and 22nd overall TV appearance, breaking the previous school record of 21 set in 2001."
