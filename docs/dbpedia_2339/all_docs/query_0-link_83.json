        "text": "N.C. State’s search for a new basketball coach reached Day 20 on Thursday, and while a few issues became clearer, the process appears only slightly closer to a conclusion than at any time since Herb Sendek left for Arizona State.\n\nHere’s what was learned on Thursday:\n\nMiami coach Frank Haith has not been contacted officially and is no longer considered a candidate. Some of the people near the inner circle of the search expected athletic director Lee Fowler to call Haith, but Fowler has refused.\n\nA source close to the situation told the Star-News on Tuesday Haith was at the top of Fowler’s Plan B list, but convinced he would land a big name coach, Fowler never thought such a list would ever be necessary.\n\nAfter striking out on numerous attempts with established coaches from other major conferences, Fowler faced the prospect of approaching Plan B candidates. His greatest concern, however, was that going after a coach from within the ACC wouldn’t resonate well around the league, even though the ACC has no stipulation preventing such a move.\n\nAlso no longer under consideration is Winthrop’s Gregg Marshall. The 41-year-old has taken the Eagles to six NCAA Tournaments in eight years at the helm, but for reasons undisclosed, he’s not an option.\n\nFormer UCLA coach and current ESPN analyst Steve Lavin was contacted by a representative from N.C. State. They spoke on Thursday, but nothing else was known when the Star-News went to print.\n\nAt just 41, Lavin already has seven years of head coaching experience under his belt. All seven seasons came at UCLA, where he went 145-78, advancing to one Elite 8 and four other Sweet 16s.\n\nLavin has spent the last three years working for ESPN.\n\nHere’s what remained up in the air on Thursday:\n\nThere remains no stated timetable as to when Fowler plans on making a hire.\n\nGolden State Warriors coach Mike Montgomery’s name floated around the media on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nMontgomery previously expressed on several occasions no interest in returning to the college game, but the NCSU source confirmed there’s at least been some chatter regarding the former Montana and Stanford coach.\n\nTeam executive Chris Mullin told the Oakland Tribune on Wednesday that Montgomery would return to the Warriors next season. Golden State finished this season 34-48, 10 games behind the final playoff qualifier from the Western Conference.\n\nMontgomery served as Stanford’s head coach for 18 years before going to the Warriors in 2004. The Cardinal reached the NCAA Tournament 16 times, including his last 10, and advanced to the 1998 Final Four. He compiled a 393-167 record at Stanford.\n\nThe NCSU source expressed concern over Montgomery’s age (almost 60) and questioned if he could give the program enough time.\n\nFormer Wolfpack great and current Fordham coach Dereck Whittenburg has become a more serious option in the last couple of days.\n\nWhittenburg, 44, just finished his third season with the Rams, perennially one of the worst programs in the Atlantic-10. He improved the team’s victory totals from six his first season to 13, and in the just-concluded campaign Fordham finished 16-16, its most wins since 1992. Fordham also advanced to the A-10 Tournament semifinals for the first time ever.\n\nWhittenburg’s missed 35-foot shot was rebounded and dunked by Lorenzo Charles to win the 1983 national championship for the Wolfpack.\n\nAccording to Fordham sports information director Joe DiBari, no one from N.C. State has officially requested to speak with Whittenburg.\n\nAndrew Jones:\n\nandrew.jones@starnewsonline.com"
