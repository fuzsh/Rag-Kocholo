        "text": "Monday, January 31, 2011\n\n1. The top-ranked Notre Dame men’s fencing team posted an 8-0 record on Sunday at the Notre Dame Duals held in the Joyce Center Fieldhouse, improving its record to 18-1 overall. The Irish fencing team finished the weekend a perfect 16-0, as the women posted an identical mark Saturday. The highlight of Sunday’s fencing action was the return of Ted Hodges to competition after undergoing a successful heart transplant over one year ago. The Irish senior competed in a full slate of matches throughout the day, finishing with a 15-4 record and posting 3-0 marks against both Lawrence and Cleveland State.\n\n2. The fourth-ranked Notre Dame women’s tennis team dropped a hard-fought, 4-3 decision to 23rd-ranked Arkansas on Sunday at the Eck Tennis Pavilion. The loss marks the first for the team during the 2010-11 dual campaign, dropping the team to 2-1 on the early season.\n\nNotre Dame fell behind early after dropping the doubles point to theRazorbacks to get the match underway. Kristy Frilling (Sidney, Ohio) and Shannon Mathews (Birmingham, Mich.) were unable to get it going in their doubles match at the No. 1 position, falling to the Arkansas pairing of Claudine Paulson and Anouk Tigu, 8-2.\n\nKristen Rafael (Grand Prairie, Texas) and Julie Sabacinski (Plantation, Fla.) fell at No. 3 doubles to the team of Jade Frampton and Valentina Starkova, 9-8 (7-4), to secure the doubles point for the Razorbacks. The Irish pushed out to a 4-1 lead in the tiebreak, before Arkansas’ duo reeled off the final six points.\n\nWith the doubles point clinched, the match between Jennifer Kellner (Smithtown, N.Y.) and Chrissie McGaffigan (Davenport, Iowa) of Notre Dame and Kate Lukomskaya and Stephanie Roy of Arkansas was abandoned with the Irish leading 6-5.\n\nSingles saw both teams go back and forth throughout the six matches. The first match to conclude saw Mathews take care of Lukomskaya at No. 2 singles, dropping only one game in a straight-sets victory, 6-1, 6-0. Rafael then fell at No. 3 singles to Emily Carbone in straight sets, 6-3, 6-0 to give the Razorbacks the lead back at 2-1. However, ninth-ranked Frilling quickly tied it up after taking care 26th-ranked Tigu at No. 1 singles, 6-3, 6-1. The Irishjunior pulled away with ease after Tigu injured her ankle with Frilling leading the first set 5-3. With the match all square, Notre Dame pulled ahead for the first time on the day when Sabacinski dispatched Starkova at No. 6 singles,6-4, 6-1, for her second-consecutive dual match victory.\n\nHowever, momentum was quickly lost as the Razorbacks closed out the final two matches at No. 4 and No. 5 singles to claim the match. McGaffiganfell to Claudine Paulson at No. 4, 6-2, 6-4, while Kellner couldn’t hold on to her early lead over Roy at No. 5, falling in three sets, 2-6, 6-1, 6-0. TheIrish return to action next weekend as they take on North Carolina at noon on Saturday (Feb. 5) at the Cone-Kenfield Center in Chapel Hill, N.C., before battling Wake Forest at 11 a.m. (ET) on Sunday (Feb. 6) at Leighton Stadium in Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\n3. The U.S. National Team withstood a second-half rally from the No. 7 Notre Dame men’s lacrosse team to capture a 12-7 victory in exhibition play on Sunday at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. Team USA scored the game’s first seven goals, yet the Fighting Irish responded with four straight tallies to slice the deficit to three by the end of the third quarter.\n\nNotre Dame’s surge began just over five minutes into the second half as sophomore attackman Ryan Foley (Glen Ridge, N.J./Delbarton) scored on an assist from junior attackman Sean Rogers (New Hyde Park, N.Y./Holy Trinity). Rogers then netted a goal of his own with 6:16 left in the third quarter. A man-up goal from senior attackman Colin Igoe (Columbus, Ohio/Worthington Kilbourne/Massachusetts) sliced theTeam USA advantage to four (7-3) with 4:23 showing on the clock in the thirdquarter. Igoe had a team-high two goals on the day. Junior midfielder Max Pfeifer (Crozet, Va./Western Albemarle) scored with six seconds remaining in the quarter to make it 7-4.\n\nSteven Brooks put a halt to the Irish uprising as he made it an 8-4 contest with 14:06 remaining. Igoe scored 30 seconds later on an assist from Rogers. A 4-0 run from Team USA made it 12-5 with 8:29 left in the game. Stephen Peyser, Peet Poillon, Chazz Woodson and Kevin Leveille scored the unanswered goals.\n\nNotre Dame’s final two scores of the game were man-up tallies. Junior attackman Nicholas Beattie (Columbus, Ohio/Worthington Kilbourne) netted the first one with 7:43 left, while senior attackman Edison Parzanese (Edgartown, Mass./Martha’s Vineyard/Holy Cross), a transfer from Holy Cross, deposited the game’s final goal with 4:32 remaining. Senior midfielder Zach Brenneman (East Hampton, N.Y./East Hampton) assisted on both goals.\n\nThe U.S. National Teamled 4-0 after the first quarter and 6-0 at halftime. Leveille netted three goals in the opening quarter. Leveille opened the game’s scoring less than two minutes into the contest and Woodson made it 2-0 on a man-up goal with 10:59 remaining in the opening quarter. Leveille scored with 8:36 left in the quarter and then again with seven seconds remaining. Doug Shanahan gave the U.S. National Team a five-goal advantage just over one minute into the second quarter. Steven Brooks upped the lead to six with 3:39 left in the half. Steven Boyle opened the second-half scoring as he put Team USA up by seven less than a minute into the stanza.\n\nNotre Dame sophomore John Kemp (Potomac, Md./Georgetown Prep) played the entire game between the pipes and made 10 saves. Former Fighting Irish goalie Scott Rodgers, a 2010 Notre Dame graduate, played the entire second half for team USA. Rodgers made nine saves. Notre Dame held a slim 40-39 edge in shots.\n\nThe Fighting Irish will open the 2011 regular season with a national title gamerematch versus No. 5 Duke at the inaugural Sunshine Classic in Jacksonville,Fla. The game will be played at Everbank Field, home to the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars. The contest is slated for a 3:00 p.m. (ET) start and will be broadcast live on ESPN.\n\nSunday, January 30, 2011\n\n1. For the second night in a row, Notre Dame’s Joyce Center was the scene of an outstanding hockey game as the Irish battled Miami to a 2-2 tie in front of a sellout crowd of 2.957 on Saturday. Notre Dame picked up the extra point in the CCHA standings with a 1-0 win in the shootout.\n\nIrish freshman center Anders Lee continued his stellar play on the weekend, scoring both goals to give him five points on the weekend after picking up three assists on Friday night. His linemate, freshman center T.J. Tynan sent the crowd home happy as he beat Miami’ Cody Reichard in the third round of the shootout to give the Irish the extra point.\n\nAlden Hirschfeld and Reilly Smith scored for the RedHawks in the game but they failed to get one shot past Irish netminder Steven Summerhays in the shootout stanza.\n\nThe back-to-back ties give the ninth-ranked Irish a 16-9-5 overall record and they are now 13-6-3-2 in the CCHA, good for 44 points. Miami is now 14-9-5 on the year and 11-7-4-2 in the league as they remain in third place, five points behind Notre Dame.\n\nWhile Friday night’s game was a free-wheeling offensive game, the two teams played closer to the vest on Saturday as the Irish limited Miami to just 15 shots in the game with a stifling defense in front of Summerhays who was making his first start since Dec. 29th. The native of Anchorage, Alaska made 13 saves in regulation and overtime but was perfect in the shootout as he stopped three of college hockey’s top players including Smith, Carter Camper and Andy Miele.\n\n2. Not only has Notre Dame been winning, but the high-scoring Irish have been blowing opponents out. It wasn’t quite as easy on Saturday night, but the result was the same as Devereaux Peters scored 20 points to lead the #9 Notre Dame women’s basketball team to a 58-43 victory over Villanova. Skylar Diggins added 13 points and Natalie Novosel had 11 for Notre Dame (18-4, 7-1 BIG EAST), which has won five straight and 13 of its past 14. The Irish won despite scoring a season low in points -nearly 25 points under their average (82.9ppg). Laura Sweeney scored 14 points to pace Villanova (8-12, 0-7), which has lost four in a row.\n\nVillanova twice sliced Notre Dame’s 12-point halftime lead in half early in the second half, but the Wildcats never could get closer than six. Villanova led by five points early, but the Irish took control midway through the first half and led 32-20 at the break. The Irish were upset by Villanova on theirlast trip to the Pavilion on Jan. 24, 2009.\n\nFor the seventh time in its 16-year membership in the BIG EAST Conference, Notre Dame is off to a 7-1 start in conference play, having also done so in 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1999-2000, 2000-01 and most recently last season.\n\nFighting Irish head coach Muffet McGraw worked her 750th game at Notre Dame, rising to 543-207 (.724) in 24 seasons under the Golden Dome.\n\n3. Senior Eric Lex celebrated his final home meet by becoming the first diver in Notre Dame history to crack the 400-point plateau in the 3-meter event Saturday at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Lex’s score of 405.15 off the high board gave him a first-place finish and the school record as Notre Dame went on to split a pair of dual meets to end the two-day Shamrock Invitational. While celebrating their Senior Day, the Irish (6-4) defeated Denver, 250-118, while falling to Iowa, 194-174, in non-conference men’s swimming and diving action.\n\nLex recorded one of six wins on the day for the Irish. Michael Sullivan (400 individual medley), Frank Dyer (200 free and 100 free), Christopher Johnson (100 breast), Petar Petrovic (100 back) and Joseph Raycroft (200 breast) also added gold-medal performances. Dyer’s 200 free (1:37.62) effort was good for an NCAA B-cut, as was Notre Dame’s 400 free relay (3:00.38) and 800 free relay (6:39.92).\n\nNext in store for Notre Dame is the BIG EAST Conference Championships held in Louisville, Ky. The diving portion spans from Feb. 11-13, while the swimming will take place from Feb. 16-19.\n\n4. Notre Dame split its four dual meets Saturday at the Rolfs Aquatic Center to end the two-day Shamrock Invitational. The women’s swimming and diving team defeated Denver (253-117) and Iowa (264-104) while falling to apair of Big Ten squads in Ohio State (197.5-166.5) and Northwestern (193.5-176.5) while celebrating its Senior Day.\n\nThe Irish (4-7) get back into the water at 1:00 p.m. (ET) next Saturday for a home meet with Ball State.\n\nTwo wins by both Kim Holden (100 back, 200 back) and Samantha Maxwell (100 breast, 200 breast) surged the Irish in its penultimate meet of the regular season. Ohio State set a pool record in the 800 free relay in 7:22.85, bettering the previous mark cemented by Michigan in 1998.\n\n5. The 36th-ranked Irish men’s tennis team came out with an early 1-0 lead over the Illini Saturday at the Atkins Center in Champaign, Ill. The Irish eventually fell 4-1 to Illinois.\n\nAt first doubles, No. 47 Tyler Davis (Nashville, Tenn./Father Ryan) and Stephen Havens (Cincinnati, Ohio/Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy) were defeated by Dennis Nevolo and Johnny Hamui, 8-1. Niall Fitzgerald (Wicklow, Ireland/Blackrock College) and Spencer Talmadge (Hillsborough, Calif./Junipero Serra) went on a 6-0 run over Abe Souza and Bruno Abdelnour before claiming an 8-3 victory at second doubles.\n\nCasey Watt (Gibsonia, Pa./Pine-Richland) and Greg Andrews (Richland, Mich./Gull Lake) won a hard-fought 9-7 match over Brian Alden and Stephen Hoh.

Kristen Rafael (Grand Prairie, Texas) and Julie Sabacinski (Plantation, Fla.) were first to finish at No. 3 doubles. The duo made quick work of the Bulldog team of Elizabeth Epstein and Kim Szokol, 8-1.\n\nThe junior pairing of Kristy Frilling (Sidney, Ohio) and Shannon Mathews (Birmingham, Mich.) clinched the point for the Irish at No. 1 doubles, taking down Vicky Brook and Lindsay Clark of Yale, 8-5. The two teams tussled to a 4-4 tie midway through the set, before Frilling and Mathews captured four of the next five games.\n\nWith the point in hand and the final doubles match between Notre Dame’s team of Chrissie McGaffigan (Davenport, Iowa) and Jennifer Kellner (Smithtown, N.Y.) and Yale’s team of Stephanie Kent and Annie Sullivan squared at sevenapiece, the team’s played a tiebreaker to determine the winner.

With Frilling up 2-1 early in the first set, the ninth-ranked junior reeled off four consecutive games to close out the first set and didn’t look back, taking the second with ease for a 6-1, 6-2 decision.\n\nMcGaffigan finished next for the Irish, closing out Sullivan at No. 4 singles in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.

ESPN The Magazine went back and found the 25 high school football players ranked as the best in the country each season dating back 25 years (as rated by SuperPrep), featuring photos and stats and quotations from each of the 25. Here are the three who ended up at Notre Dame:\n\n1987\n\nRicky Watters —RB Bishop McDevitt High School (Pa.)\n\nCollege: Notre Dame\n\nNFL Draft: No. 45 pick (San Francisco 49ers) in 1991\n\nNow: Motivational speaker\n\n“I almost lost my mind. Everyone started treating me differently. Restaurants I couldn’t afford were throwing free food at me. Chicks who were untouchable were all of a sudden very touchable. Boosters were offering me cars. As the No. 1 guy, I got treated really well on recruiting trips. When I visited Tennessee, they already had a jersey with my name and number on it. At Florida, they had these beautiful girls called Gator Getters who were assigned to help land the top recruits. Back home, the city of Harrisburg held a Ricky Watters Day, with a parade. They had me in a convertible, and the mayor was there. Lou Holtz came down too. I remember thinking, This is the life. My mom saw everything that was happening and laid down the law: I was going either to Notre Dame or West Point.”\n\n1993\n\nRon Powlus —QB, Berwick High School (Pa.)\n\nCollege: Notre Dame\n\nNFL Draft: Undrafted\n\nNow: QBs coach at Akron\n\n“At Berwick, we ended my senior season as the nation’s No. 1 team, and I was the No. 1 player. Bill Clinton invited the team to the White House and presented us with a plaque. Then Beano Cook predicted on TV that I’d win two Heisman Trophies. In the moment, it was flattering. But then you realize you have to live with a crazy statement like that.”\n\n1998\n\nDavid Givens — WR, Humble High School (Texas)\n\nCollege: Notre Dame\n\nNFL Draft: No. 253 pick (New England Patriots) in 2002\n\nNow: NFL analyst for NESN\n\n“A few days after I verbaled to Notre Dame over Texas, I went on a local sports radio show. Earl Campbell was on the show that day, and he and the hosts said they wanted me to stay in Texas. I told them that Notre Dame was my favorite team growing up. And when I got to South Bend, I knew I’d made the right decision.”\n\n2. Two of college hockey’s top offensive attacks met Friday night at the Joyce Center and put on an offensive show in front of a sellout crowd of 2,957 and Notre Dame and Miami battled to a 5-5 tie. The visiting RedHawks picked up the extra point in the CCHA standings as they won the shootout, 3-2, in four rounds. Irish freshmen standouts T.J. Tynan and Anders Lee sparked the late, third-period rally as Notre Dame wiped out a 5-3 Miami lead in the final 7:13 with goals from Riley Sheahan on the power play and Tynan’s second of the night.

Miami was led by senior center Andy Miele, the nation’s leading scorer, who had a goal and three assists for a four-point night. Reilly Smith added two goals with Pat Cannone and Justin Vaive scoring single goals. The RedHawks were three-for-four on the power play in the contest. In the shootout, Notre Dame got goals from Ben Ryan and Tynan while Miami matched those two with markers by Smith and Miele. Cannone ended the extra session in the fourth round with the shootout game winner against Irish goaltender Mike Johnson. The tie gives the ninth-ranked Irish a 16-9-4 overall record and a 13-6-2-1 mark in the CCHA, good for 42 points in conference play.

While pursuing his master’s degree at Arizona, Russ worked as headathletic trainer at Pueblo High School in Tucson, Ariz. As an undergraduate at Ball State, he served as an athletic trainer and worked with the National Football League’s Detroit Lions. He also served as an assistant athletics trainer at New Castle (Ind.)

The award is presented every year to college hockey’s finest citizen for their contributions to society in all areas. This is the 16th year for the Hockey Humanitarian Award that will bepresented in a special ceremony on Friday, April 8th at the Frozen Four in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nRyan is in his fourth season at Notre Dame and is one of three alternate captains for the Irish. He is currently fourth in scoring on the squad with five goals and 17 assists for 22 points. Two of his goals have come on the power play and one is a game winner. Ryan is +5 for the year. The veteran center has had a strong career at Notre Dame as he enters this weekend with Miami having played in 143 career games with 34 goals and 60 assists for 94 points. He owns 11 power-play goals and eight game winners since joining the Irish for the 2007-08 season.\n\nDuring his career, Ryan has been active with the team’s community service projects and as a senior this season the alternate captain has become the team’s leader in the Notre Dame and South Bend-area communities. Among his many duties, Ryan serves as the hockey team’s Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) representative that plans service work within theNotre Dame and local community for student athletes. That committee also works to initiate change within the athletic department to improve the student-athlete experience and relations in the community. During this season, Ryan has helped set up the Irish Youth Hockey Clinics where he and his teammates host a free hockey clinic at a local arena -The Ice Box -where youth hockey players in the local community can participate in skill development and team-oriented small games.\n\nHe is the coordinator of the Robinson Learning Center’s involvement with the Notre Dame hockey team.

On Dec. 29, students from the Robinson Center attended an Irish home hockey game. Later in the winter, they will have a chance to skate at the Joyce Center with the team.\n\nWednesday, January 26, 2011\n\n1. Here’s an interesting statistical analysis of Notre Dame’s Monday night men’s basketball win over #2 Pittsburgh, thanks to Eamonn Brennan of ESPN.com: “Thanks to the game plan –which Pittsburgh guard Brad Wanamaker said he recognized as early as the opening possession –Notre Dame and Pitt traded a mere 48 possessions, the lowest number in any major-conference game to date this season. Upon hearing that his team accomplished such utter lack of pace, Brey called the news ‘music to my ears,’ according to CBS’s Matt Norlander. If Brey actually heard music, I’m betting it sounded like the first time he heard the Beatles. Of course, no matter how slow you play, youstill have to hit shots when it counts and, yeah, Notre Dame did that too. In fact, the Irish were even more efficient in late-clock situations, especially in the second half. Per ESPN Stats & Information, Notre Dame was 2-of-5from the field with more than 25 seconds left on the shot clock, 4-of-6 whenthere were between 11 and 25 seconds remaining, and 13-of-27 when there were 10 seconds or less left to shoot. That last mark includes a 10-for-15 performance in the second half. In all, the Irish scored 37 of their 56 points with less than 11 seconds on the shot clock Monday night. That’s just crazy. Of course, the late heroics of Ben Hansbrough are worth a mention. Though he didn’t shoot the ball well (he was 1-of-6 from 3), Hansbrough was still efficient thanks to his 7-of-8 mark from inside the arc. More importantly, he was unstoppable in five straight pick-and-roll situations in the last five minutes of the game, a crucial stretch that allowed Notre Dame to seize its small lead and hold on for the win in the closing minutes. Carlton Scott’s 16-point, nine-rebound game –which included a 5-of-6 night from beyond the arc –was also a huge boost. On defense, it certainly didn’t hurt that Pittsburgh –the nation’s No. 1-ranked offense, according to Ken Pomeroy –was unusually inefficient. As always, the rebound-happy Panthers grabbed a large percentage of their misses, but Pitt shot just 12-of-30 from inside the arc. Usually, Pittsburgh makes you pay on second chances. Against Notre Dame, no matter how many times Pitt got those second and third looks, it just couldn’t get the ball to go down. More than anything, though, Brey, Hansbrough and the rest of the Irish deserve credit for an intelligently crafted and masterfully executed plan. As Notre Dame knows, winning on the road isn’t easy. Winning on the road in the Big East isn’t easy. Winning on the road at Pittsburgh is, you know, not easy. But if you control the pace of the game, prevent turnovers and make a few shots when it counts and hope the other team misses, you can beat just about anyone. That’s what the road-weary Irish accomplished Monday night, and they earned a serious upset for their trouble.”\n\n2. Another week, another version of Bracketology for men’s basketball. This week ESPN.com puts the Irish as a #4 seed overall in the East (Newark), playing in Chicago in the first round against #13 Oakland (the other game is #5 Florida vs. #12 UCLA/Wichita State). SI.com also has the Irish a #4 and also has them playing in Chicago against Oakland (the other game is projected as #5 Florida vs. #12 Memphis).

How tough is it to beat a highly-ranked team on its own court, as the Irish men’s basketball team did Monday at #2 Pittsburgh? Check out these numbers. Since the Associated Press began its poll in 1948-49, the Irish men have played 60 games (seven in the NCAA Championships) against teams ranked #1 or #2 (13 Irish wins). Twenty-three of those (10 vs. #1, 13 vs. #2) have been played on the opponent home court -and Irish road wins have come at #2 UCLA in ’79, at #2 Connecticut in ’00 and Monday night at #2 Pittsburgh. Of those 23 on the road, venues have included UCLA (8 games), Duke (3), Connecticut (3), Indiana (2), DePaul (2), plus St. Louis, Marquette, North Carolina, Michigan and Pittsburgh (1 each).\n\n5. Notre Dame senior guard Ben Hansbrough (Poplar Bluff, Mo.) has been named to the BIG EAST Weekly Honor Roll for helping the Fighting Irish post a 2-0 record in league play last week.

This marks the second time this season -and third time in his career -Hansbrough has been named to the league’s weekly honor roll. The other occurrence this season was on Nov. 22, while he was selected as the BIG EAST Player of the Week on Jan. 10. Hansbrough scored a career-high 28 points, in addition to grabbing five rebounds and dishing out six assists on Saturday in an 80-75 triumph of Marquette. It was his seventh 20-plus point effort of the season and it was the fourth time he notched six or more assists in a game. The senior guard registered 13 points, three rebounds and five assists on Wednesday in a 66-58 win over Cincinnati. Hansbrough went 5-6 from the free throw line in the final 1:18 to help secure the victory over the Bearcats.\n\n6.

For the second time this season, Notre Dame sophomore guard Skylar Diggins (South Bend, Ind./Washington) has been named to the BIG EAST Conference Women’s Basketball Weekly Honor Roll. Diggins, who previously earned the accolade on Dec. 6, was one of five players chosen for this week’s honor, which recognizes outstanding weekly achievements by conference players who are not chosen as the BIG EAST Player of the Week. In two games last week (both against ranked opponents), Diggins averaged 14.5 points, 6.0 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game with a 2.0 assist-to-turnover ratio (12 assists, six turnovers) as the Fighting Irish registered back-to-back wins over Top 25 opponents for the first time in nearly six years, defeating No. 16/17 Georgetown (80-58) and No. RV/23 St. John’s (69-36) at Purcell Pavilion.\n\n11. In conjunction with the final full season of hockey at the JoyceCenter, Notre Dame will select an All-Joyce Center Team to recognize the many great players who have patrolled Irish ice during the 43-year history of the building (1968-2011). Last week, with the help of several former coaches, assistant coaches and administrators who have been involved with the Notre Dame hockey program during that time period, all-decade teams were selected to cover four time periods from 1968-80, from 1980-89, from 1990-99 and the 2000-2011 seasons. Now it is the fans turn to select the All-Joyce Center Team by going to the Notre Dame website at und.com to vote for the top players in the program’s history. Voting is easy and simple to do. Go to the main page of the Notre Dame website (und.com) and at the center of the front page is a blockthat says Notre Dame Hockey All-Joyce Center Team -VOTE. Click on that block and it will take the voter to the page that includes the ballot for selecting the team and thumbnail bios of all the players selected to the four All-Decade Teams. Scroll down through the bios of the players to the ballot -All-JoyceCenter Team Ballot. There the voter just needs to click on the players theywould like to select.

At the final game, the first team as selected by thefans will be announced and all team members in attendance at the game will be honored that night.\n\n12. Interesting that Irish men’s basketball coach Mike Brey, late in his Saturday night post-game remarks following his team’s win over Marquette, said exactly what he planned to do Monday night in terms of using the “burn” offense against Pittsburgh. Then his players went out and executed it to near perfection. They did it without second-leading scorer Tim Abromaitis attempting even a single shot from the field.\n\n13. The next Blue-Gold Day at Meijer is Friday (Jan. 28) from noon-1p.m. ET at the Portage Road Meijer in South Bend. Notre Dame head men’s basketball coach Mike Brey will be making a special appearance from noon-12:30 p.m. ET for autographs and photos. Fans can also enter for a chance to win 26 pairs of tickets. From noon-1 p.m. ET free tickets will be given away through an enter-to-win contest (fans must enter and be present to win). The tickets available on Friday include:\n\n–5 pair men’s basketball vs. Rutgers 2/6\n\n–5 pair men’s basketball vs. Louisville 2/9\n\n–2 pair hockey vs. Miami 1/28\n\n–3 pair hockey vs. Miami 1/29\n\n–5 pair women’s basketball vs. Syracuse 2/1\n\n–5 pair women’s basketball vs. Seton Hall 2/8\n\n–1 pair baseball dinner 2/10\n\nThe Portage Road Meijer is located at 3600 North Portage Road, SouthBend, Ind.\n\nMonday, January 24, 2011\n\n1. Former Notre Dame basketball player Scott Paddock has been named president of Chicagoland Speedway. Paddock has spent the last 15 years in sports marketing, most of those with Gatorade as director of sports marketing. He worked with NASCAR and other professional and collegiate sports in that role. Paddock will be responsible for all operations of Chicagoland Speedway and Route 66 Speedway. Paddock, who lives in Orland Park, Ill., is a 1990 Notre Dame graduate. He played on four straight NCAA Championships-qualifying teams with the Irish from ’87 through ’90.\n\n2. You’ve seen plenty of great individual efforts by Notre Dame players in men’s basketball games at the Joyce Center/Purcell Pavilion. And you’ve seen plenty of great shooting and scoring exhibitions. But you may not have seen a better all-around show at both ends of the floor than what Ben Hansbrough displayed Saturday night in Notre Dame’s comeback win over Marquette.\n\n3. The best line from the Notre Dame Football Awards Ceremony Saturday afternoon at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center? It came from Notre Dame assistant coach Chuck Martin, who was presenting the first award for the Scout Team Player of the Year on offense: “At Grand Valley (where Martin was head coach), the MVP award was smaller and lighter than this.”\n\n4. Seen at the football awards event and at the Notre Dame-Marquettebasketball game Saturday night -former Irish football All-American Jeff Burris, now doing some coaching and media work in Indianapolis.\n\n5. Wonder why Kyle Rudolph opted for the NFL? Mike Mayock of the NFLNetwork (he saw Rudolph via his work on Notre Dame home games) rates Rudolphthe #1 tight end in the draft. Next are Lance Kendricks (Wisconsin), Luke Stocker (Tennessee), D.J. Williams (Arkansas) and Charles Clay (Tulsa).\n\n6. Biggest applause at the football awards show was for any mention of the end of the losing streak against USC.\n\n7. Dr. David Bankoff is retiring as one of the Irish football team physicians after 30 years in that role -and at the football awards event athletics director Jack Swarbrick and long-time Irish athletics trainer Jim Russ presented him with a green football jersey with his name on the back and a framed collage of photos.\n\n8. Devereaux Peters dominated inside with 14 points, 10 rebounds andfive blocks to lead #10 Notre Dame’s women’s basketball squad to a 69-36 rout of #23 St. John’s on Sunday at Purcell Pavilion. Becca Bruszewski scored 19points on 8-of-11 shooting for the Fighting Irish (17-4, 6-1 BIG EAST). The Red Storm (14-6, 3-4) shot 32 percent, with no player reaching double figures. Leading scorer Shenneika Smith was held to seven points on 3-of-8 shooting.Da’Shena Stevens had nine rebounds, but missed all seven free-throw attempts. Notre Dame outrebounded the Red Storm 42-31. On the final play of the first half,Skylar Diggins drove and dished to Natalie Achonwa, whose layup as time expired gave the Fighting Irish a 39-21 lead. Diggins had six assists. Notre Dame set a school record with its 11th win of the season by at least 30 points, topping the old mark of 10 30-point wins set in 2000-01. In two games last week, the Fighting Irish defeated a pair of ranked teams (#16/17 Georgetown and #RV/23 St. John’s) by an average of 27.5 points per game. Prior to Tuesday’s 22-point win over Georgetown, Notre Dame had not defeated a ranked team by more than 17 points since Feb. 25, 2004 (93-58 at home over #21/19 Miami), but the Fighting Irish have done just that in consecutive games this last week. Notre Dame defeats ranked opponents in back-to-back games for the first time since Jan. 30 and Feb. 2, 2005, when the Fighting Irish won at #9/10 Connecticut (65-59) and at home against #16/13 Boston College (64-57). The 36 points by St. John’s are the fewest Notre Dame has allowed to a ranked opponent since Jan. 24, 2004,when the Fighting Irish edged No. 23/25 Villanova, 38-36 at Purcell Pavilion.\n\n9. The Fighting Irish men’s tennis team earned a 6-1 victory over William & Mary to open the 2011 season Saturday in Williamsburg, Va. The Irish dominated the Tribe when they won five singles and three doubles competitions. Stephen Havens (Cincinnati, Ohio/Hill Christian) and Sam Keeton (Kansas City, Mo./Pembroke Hill) both posted 6-3, 6-1 victories when competing at No.1 and No.5 singles, respectively. Competing at No.2 singles, Casey Watt (Gibsonia, Pa./Pine-Richland) also recorded a win to open his junior campaign, posting 6-3, 5-2 (retired) in a victory over the Tribe’s Ben Guthrie. Adding another point for the Irish, Blas Moros (Boca Raton, Fla./Pine Crest School) earned a singles win as he made quick work of Adrian Vodislav at No. 6 singles 6-0, 6-1, the same opponent he faced in 2010. William and Mary got on the board when Jamie Whiteford defeated Greg Andrews (Richland, Mich./Gull Lake) 1-6, 6-3, 10-7, but it wasn’t enough to limit the Irish. Notre Dame’s doubles play mimicked that of singles action as the Irish won all three matches. At No. 1 doubles Stephen Havens and Tyler Davis downed Sebastien Vidal and Jamie Whiteford 8-4. Niall Fitzgerald (Wicklow, Ireland/Blackrock College) and Spencer Talmadge (Hillsborough, Calif./Junipero Serra) recorded an 8-5 victory over the duo of Anton Andersson and Ben Guthrie. Closing out doubles play, Greg Andrews (Richland, Mich./Gull Lake) and Watt battled and secured the doubles point against Ilja Orrie and Adrian Vodislav, winning 8-7.\n\n10. Notre Dame junior wide receiver Michael Floyd captured the 2010 Notre Dame Monogram Club Most Valuable Player Award at the 90th Notre Dame Football Awards Ceremony. Floyd was selected in a vote by the Fighting Irish football team and the MVP award was one of 11 presented Saturday afternoon at the show sponsored by the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley. Floyd (St. Paul, Minn.) led the Irish with 79 receptions for 1,025 yards and 12 touchdowns. The 79 catches ranked second in Notre Dame single-season history, while his 12 touchdowns tied for fourth most in a season and his 1,025 receiving yards ranked seventh.\n\nSenior running back Robert Hughes received the Nick Pietrosante Award. The Pietrosante Award is given to the student-athlete who best exemplified the courage, loyalty, teamwork, dedication and pride of the late Irish All-America fullback. Pietrosante, Notre Dame’s leading rusher in 1957 and ’58 (and later a number-one draft pick and two-time all-pro selection with the Detroit Lions), died of cancer on Feb. 6, 1988. The recipient is determined by a vote of the players and past winners have included Kyle McCarthy, Maurice Crum Jr., Mike Anello, John Carlson, Jeff Faine, Aaron Taylor, Tom Zbikowski and Chris Zorich. Hughes (Chicago, Ill.) finished the year with a modest 300 yards rushing and two touchdowns, but his efforts in 2010 far exceeded those numbers. He totaled 15 yards on five carries over Notre Dame’s first six games, but following the season-ending injury to fellow senior Armando Allen Jr., Hughes recorded 285 yards on 63 carries over the final six contests of the regular season, including 69 yards on 11 carries against USC and 81 yards on 27 carries in the Hyundai Sun Bowl versus Miami (Fla.). He rumbled for 36 yards alone on a seven play, 77-yard go-ahead touchdown drive against the Trojans, capping the march with a five-yard touchdown plunge to help the Irish snap USC’s eight-game winning streak in the series.\n\nSophomore offensive tackle Zack Martin (Indianapolis, Ind.) won the Guardian of the Year Award from the Guardian Life Insurance Company (a sponsor of Irish football on ISP radio broadcasts) as the top offensive lineman. One of four players on the Irish offensive line to start all 13 games this year, Martin opened 11 contests at left tackle, two at right tackle and was predominantly responsible for blocking the blindside of Notre Dame’s quarterbacks. He was a key reason the Irish allowed only 20 sacks in 2010, which averaged out to 1.54 per game. Notre Dame has not allowed fewer sacks per game since 1998. Martin also earned the Jimmy Rogers, Jr. Most Valuable Lineman Award following the Hyundai Sun Bowl victory over Miami (Fla.).\n\nSenior nose guard Ian Williams (Altamonte Springs, Fla.) claimed theLineman of the Year Award by the Moose Krause Chapter of the National Football Foundation. Williams, who missed the final four games of the regular seasonwith a knee injury, started nine games and finished the season with 38 tackles, 17 solo stops, 21 assisted tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss (18 yards), 1.5 sacks (16 yards), one interception and one pass breakup.\n\nSenior place kicker David Ruffer (Oakton, Va.) was honored with the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley Rockne Student-Athlete Award. Ruffer, who was named to the 2010 First Team ESPN Academic All-America Football Team, earned a 3.90 grade-point average while studying economics. He excelled on the field as well. Ruffer was a finalist for the 2010 Lou Groza Collegiate Place-Kicker Award presented by the Discover Orange Bowl. He converted the first 23 field goal attempts of his career to set a school record. Ruffer’sstreak was the longest in the Football Bowl Subdivision when it ended. He also established a school record for consecutive field goals made in a single season with 18. Ruffer’s 18 field goals in 2010 ranked third-best in school history. He also became the second kicker in Irish history to convert a pair of 50-yard field goals in the same season.\n\nFreshman quarterback Tommy Rees captured the inaugural Next Man In Award. Rees stepped into action following the season-ending injury of junior Dayne Crist in the Tulsa game. He proceeded to complete 33 of 54 passes for 334 yards and four touchdowns versus the Golden Hurricane. Rees was the first Irish freshman quarterback to ever throw four touchdown passes in a single game. His 334 yards passing was the most ever by a quarterback that did not start thegame. Rees’ 300-yard passing game was the 35th in school history and second-ever by a Notre Dame freshman.\n\nRees (Lake Forest, Ill.) led the Irish to four consecutive victories to end the 2010 season, including a win over No. 15 Utah, a victory over archrival USC and a rout of Miami (Fla.) in the Hyundai Sun Bowl. He completed 61.0 percent of his passes (100 of 164) for 1,106 yards and 12 touchdowns. Rees registered a passing efficiency rating of 132.0. Rees’ 12 touchdown passes set a single-season freshman school record. He also established a single-seasonfreshman record in completion percentage (.610). Rees became the first freshman quarterback in Notre Dame history to ever lead the Irish to a victory in a bowl game. He was also the first-ever, first-year starter (regardless of class) to lead Notre Dame to a bowl game victory.\n\nOther awards handed out included: Offensive Scout Team Player of theYear to freshman running back Cameron Roberson, Defensive Scout Team Player of the Year to freshman linebacker Kendall Moore, Offensive Newcomer of the Year to sophomore tight end Tyler Eifert, Defensive Newcomer of the Year to freshman linebacker Prince Shembo and Special Teams Player of the Year to freshman wide receiver Bennett Jackson.\n\n11. The Notre Dame fencing team opened its 2011 season with 11 combined wins at the New York University Invitational on Saturday at the Jerome S. Coles Sports Center in New York, as the women recorded a 6-0 ledger and the men posted a 5-1 mark. Epeeist Ewa Nelip (14-2) and foilist Ariel DeSmet (11-0) led the way for the women’s and men’s squads, respectively. The women notched victories over Yale (22-5), sixth-ranked Columbia (20-7), seventh-ranked Northwestern (16-11), fifth-ranked St. John’s (16-11), NYU (20-7) and 10th-ranked Ohio State (17-10).

The Notre Dame men’s tennis team fell to first-ranked Virginia by a 9-1 final score on Sunday at the Boyd Tinsley Courts at the Boar’s Head Sports Club in Charlottesville, Va. The loss moves Notre Dame to a 1-1 record to start the dual season. The match followed a format of eight singles matches and four doubles matches. In singles action, No. 122 Tyler Davis started the season at the No. 7 spot for the Irish. The team captain earned the lone victory for Notre Dame, defeating Julen Uriguen 7-6(3), 6-4. The Irish return to actionFriday when they square off against Illinois at the National Team Indoor Qualifier in Champaign, Ill. The match is set to begin at 2:00 (CT).\n\n13. The Notre Dame fencing team enjoyed a perfect day at the St. John’s Duals on Sunday in Taffner Field House in Jamaica, N.Y. Both the men’s and women’s squads ended the day with matching 5-0 records and beat the second-seeded team in each of their respective polls. The men got theirfive wins with victories over fifth-ranked Ohio State (17-10), fourth-rankedPenn State (20-7), second-ranked Harvard (16-11), third-ranked St. John’s (15-12) and eighth-ranked Columbia.

After the weekend’s events the men sit with a record of 10-1, while the women ended with a perfect mark of 11-0.\n\n14. The Notre Dame hockey team regrouped and remembered what it takes to win on the road Saturday night as the Irish got timely scoring, strong special teams play and stellar goaltending from sophomore Mike Johnson in knocking off Ohio State, 4-1, at Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Johnson rebounded from being pulled in Friday’s 6-1 loss to the Buckeyes by stopping 29 of 30 shots on the way to his 13th win of the season as the Irish improved to 6-5-2 on theroad this season. Anders Lee paced the Notre Dame offense with a pair of goals while Ben Ryan and David Gerths scored solo goals for the Irish. DefensemanShane Sims had the lone goal for Ohio State. Notre Dame’s special teams scored two power-play goals while holding OSU to one on five chances in the game. The win improved the eighth-ranked Irish to 16-9-3 on the season and 13-6-1-1 in the CCHA, good for 41 points in the standings. Ohio State fell to 13-10-1 on the year and 8-8-2-2 in the conference.\n\n15. When it was time to make a move, Notre Dame knew exactly where to turn. Ben Hansbrough scored a career-best 28 points and keyed a second-half spurt that rallied the 16th-ranked Fighting Irish to an 80-75 men’s basketball victory over Marquette on Saturday night at Purcell Pavilion. Hansbrough, who shot 10 of 15 from the field and 6 of 6 at the foul line, scored seven straight points during a decisive sequence midway through the second half to help the Fighting Irish (16-4, 5-3 Big East) come back from a 12-point deficit. Tyrone Nash added 13 points for Notre Dame, which improved to 13-0 at home.Atkins scored 12 and Scott Martin 10. Carleton Scott had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Darius Johnson-Odom had 25 points to pace Marquette (13-7, 4-3). Jae Crowder added 15 before fouling out and Jimmy Butler scored 12. The score was 57-all with 10:28 to go and time was running out on the shot clock when Hansbrough threw up an off-balance 3-pointer from the corner that found itsmark. The shot gave Notre Dame its first lead since early in the game and sent the crowd into a frenzy. Just 80 seconds later, Hansbrough picked an open lane and drove in for a dunk. A minute later it was his layup that gave Notre Dame a 64-60 lead. Trailing by 11, Notre Dame went on a 13-2 tear to tie it at 53 with 14:20 to go on two free throws by Hansbrough. After a strong first half, Marquette went cold in the second, shooting only 9 of 30. The Irish shot 53.5 percent for the game and outrebounded the Golden Eagles 32-25. Still, NotreDame was in trouble before Brey went to a zone defense against a team that had been shooting well from 3-point range. The Irish went 28 of 36 from the free throw line, while Marquette was 15 for 17. Marquette, which hit 12 3-pointers in its 22-point home win over Notre Dame on Jan. 10, started out quick from beyond the arc again, nailing three of its first four attempts. The Golden Eagles jumped out to an 11-4 lead before Notre Dame scored seven straight points to tie it. A 12-footer by Crowder gave Marquette a 33-23 advantage with 6:05 left in the first half. Marquette pushed the lead to 12 before ending the half with a 45-36 lead. The Golden Eagles shot 61.5 percent, led by Johnson-Odom’s 15 points.\n\n16. The Notre Dame men’s and women’s track and field teams concluded the Notre Dame Invitational Saturday inside the Loftus Sports Center in Notre Dame, Ind. Sophomore Rebecca Tracy(Barrington, Ill./Barrington) clocked the second-best mile time in the nation in 4:42.14. The men’s and women’s teams had a bountiful meet with 14 first-place finishes. In addition to Tracy, sophomore Lauren Leniart (Fort Lauderdale, Fla./Cardinal Gibbons) claimed the crown in the long jump (5.47m). Freshman Kelly Burke (Cranford, N.J./Cranford) placed first in the triple jump, leaping 11.37m, and senior Rudy Atang (Houston, Texas/St. Pius X) rounded out the women’s victories with a shot put throw of 14.94m.

Despite six individual wins on the night, the Notre Dame men’s swimming and diving squad narrowly lost to Michigan State, 155.5-144.5 Friday in East Lansing. The contest was dramatically closer than last year’s dual meet in which Michigan State rolled to a 179-121 win in South Bend. The Irish (5-3) effort was led by sophomore Bill Bass who won the 200 fly and 400 IM. Bass was joined by Frank Dyer (1,000 free), Kevin Overholt (50 free), Michael Sullivan (500 free) and Eric Lex (3-meter) as first-place finishers. The Spartans took the early lead by winning four of the first five events. However, Bass and Overholt replied with two straight first-place finishes, winning the 200 fly and 50 free, respectively. Starting with the 1-meter diving contest, Michigan State came back with four consecutive victories to distance themselves from Notre Dame. Despite an Irish rally, which included winning the last three events of the evening, Notre Dame still came up just short. The Irish will be back in action when they play host to the annual Shamrock Invitational Friday and Saturday.\n\n18. Brian Kelly Friday held a season wrap-up media event andleft behind a few tidbits:\n\n–Theo Riddick may move back to running back for 2011.\n\n–Expect it to be tough to maintain six spots for quarterbacks on the roster. Kelly indicated four is the workable number and suggested he has a plan for how to do it but had not yet spoken to the players involved.\n\n–Kicker David Ruffer has been awarded a scholarship. He still needs approval to return for a fifth season.\n\n–Recovering from surgeries since the Sun Bowl win are SeanCwynar (back and foot) and Jamoris Slaughter (ankle).\n\n19. Michael Floyd said Friday teammate Robert Blanton texted him every day after the Sun Bowl, imploring Floyd to return for his final year.\n\n20. Notre Dame’s 2010 NCAA champion women’s soccer team was honored at the men’s basketball game against Marquette Saturday at Purcell Pavilion, including presentations by South Bend mayor Steve Luecke and Ind. Rep. Joe Donnelly. Also honored at a timeout was Melissa Henderson for her Honda Award for women’s soccer.\n\n21. Former Irish fencer Mariel Zagunis was honored last week at the Notre Dame-Cincinnati men’s basketball game for her 2010 sabre world championship. She sat courtside at the basketball game next to Jimmy Clausen who is back in school this semester to finish his final 15 hours. Seen after the game -Clausen chatting with former Irish basketball coach Digger Phelps along press row.\n\n22. When Marquette coach Buzz Williams appeared in the interview room after the game Saturday night, he was already out of his coat and tie and into a #12 Green Bay Packers jersey.\n\n23. Last Wednesday was the exact anniversary of Notre Dame’s 71-70 upset of UCLA from 1974 that ended the Bruins’ all-time record 88-game win streak. John Saunders did the Notre Dame-Cincinnati game for ESPN and Digger Phelps visited with him that afternoon and showed him exactly where the coaches and teams sat that day. At halftime Wednesday, the new Purcell Pavilion video boards showed the final seconds of the Irish upset from 37 years back.\n\n24. Sitting courtside at the Notre Dame-Marquette basketballgame Saturday night was Phil Purcell, lead benefactor for Purcell Pavilion.\n\n25. Notre Dame’s men’s basketball team last night stayed at the Westin in downtown Pittsburgh -same hotel where the New York Jets stayed prior to their game last night. The Steeler win prompted fireworks that literally shook the windows in the hotel.\n\n26. Master of ceremonies Jack Nolan’s opening lines at the football awards show suggested the event’s new format would be like Brian Kelly’s offense: “fast-paced, exciting and we want to score a lot of points.”\n\n27. In conjunction with the final full season of hockey at the JoyceCenter, Notre Dame will select an All-Joyce Center Team to recognize the many great players who have patrolled Irish ice during the 43-year history of the building (1968-2011).

Notre Dame earned its first win over a ranked opponent in five outings this season. The 22-point margin of victory was the largest for the Fighting Irish against a Top 25 opponent since Feb. 25, 2004, when an unranked Notre Dame side knocked off #21/19 Miami (Fla.), 93-58 at Purcell Pavilion\n\n4.

How do you deal with the mindset of your team when you’re coming off an NCAA runner-up finish? Irish men’s lacrosse coach Kevin Corrigan brought his squad back a couple of days early prior to the start of the spring semester and held two-a-day workouts Sunday and Monday to kick off the campaign. Notre Dame’s director of campus ministry, Father Joe Carey, got the preseason started with the right perspective Saturday night. Father Carey joined the Irish in the O’Leary team room of Arlotta Stadium where he celebrated Mass and provided some reflective inspiration for the Irish as they prepare to follow up on last year’s run to the NCAA title game. Father Carey asked the team members to remember the many reasonswhy they came to Notre Dame and spoke about the school’s restless desire for excellence. He went on to challenge each individual team member “to become the best version of themselves” and to then take that individual excellence and couple it with collective sacrifice for the team. The Irish open the season Jan. 30 in Orlando against the U.S. National Team. The game will be televised nationally on ESPNU.\n\n7. Two former Irish football assistants are on the move -Bryant Young from San Jose State to Florida, Greg Mattison from the NFL Baltimore Ravens to Michigan.

University of Notre Dame head women’s soccer coach Randy Waldrum has been named the 2010 National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA)/Mondo Division I National Coach of the Year, it was announced Friday night during the NSCAA’s annual awards banquet held at the association’s annual convention in Baltimore. This marks the third consecutive season in which Waldrum has been singled out for a national coaching honor. In 2008, he wasnamed the FieldTurf Tarkett Division I National Coach of the Year and received that award at the NSCAA convention. Last season, Waldrum was tabbed as the Soccer America Division I National Coach of the Year. He also has garnered eight regional coach-of-the-year and conference coach-of-the-year citations during his career.\n\nUnder Waldrum’s steady hand, Notre Dame won its third NCAA national championship in 2010, posting a 21-2-2 record and rolling to six consecutive wins in the NCAA Championship while outscoring its opponents, 15-1. What’s more, the Fighting Irish were handed arguably the most difficult path to a championship in the tournament’s history, having to go through five ranked teams and four seeded opponents, including top-seeded North Carolina and Stanford (the latter was unbeaten prior to falling to Notre Dame, 1-0 in the NCAA final). Furthermore, the Fighting Irish had to win consecutive matches on the road (at UNC and Oklahoma State) just to reach the College Cup, markingjust the third time in tournament history that a team won back-to-back roadmatches in the third round and quarterfinal rounds of the Championship.\n\nIn his 12 seasons at Notre Dame, Waldrum has led the Fighting Irish to unprecedented success, posting a 253-36-11 (.862) mark and winning nationalchampionships in 2004 and 2010. He also is just the seventh coach at Notre Dame (in any sport) to win multiple NCAA titles –a storied list that also includes legendary football coaches Frank Leahy (4), Knute Rockne (3) and Ara Parseghian (2), as well as heralded fencing skippers Michael DeCicco (4), Yves Auriol (2) and current Fighting Irish fencing coach Janusz Bednarski (2).\n\n6. Kim Holden and Samantha Maxwell both earned a pair of individual wins for the Notre Dame women’s swimming and diving team Saturday at the Norris Aquatic Center in Evanston, Ill. But their efforts were not enough to boost the Irish to a pair of wins during the double-dual meet with Big Ten foes Northwestern and Michigan. The Irish (2-5) dropped their contest with Northwestern 189.5-110.5 while falling to Michigan 182-117.\n\nHolden held court in the 100 and 200 backstroke events, while Maxwell went with her bread and butter -the 100 and 200 breaststroke -as the All-American flexed her dominance over a solid field.\n\nNotre Dame returns to the pool Jan. 28-29 when it plays hosts to the Shamrock Invitational at the Rolfs Aquatic Center.\n\n7. The Notre Dame men’s lacrosse coaching staff will be offering a free coaches clinic Feb. 5-6. The clinic will take place inside the Loftus Sports Center, the Arlotta Stadium video room and the Isban Theatre inside the Guglielmino Athletics Complex on the Notre Dame campus. The Fighting Irish coaching staff is opening its doors to high school, travel and youth coaches across the country so they can gain valuable insight into a top-level collegiate program.\n\nOn Feb. 5, the clinic will feature a video breakdown seminar of Notre Dame’s exhibition game versus the U.S. National Team, which will be played Jan. 30 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Fla. A question-and-answer session with the Notre Dame staff will be held during and after the video session.\n\nCoaches attending the clinic will have complete access to Notre Dame’s practice that night inside the Loftus Sports Center. There will be a post-practice question-and-answer session with the Irish coaches.\n\nOn Feb. 6, the clinic coaches will have sideline access to Notre Dame’s scrimmages against Denison, a top 10 team from Division III, and Robert Morris, a top 25 Division I program. There also will be a “chalk talk” session with the coaches from Notre Dame, Denison and Robert Morris.\n\nPlease forward all questions to Kevin Dugan, Notre Dame’s Director of Lacrosse Operations, at kdugan1@nd.edu. If coaches want to be added to the NDLU mailing list, send an e-mail to Dugan or you can send him your coaching e-mail list and he will add them. The Fighting Irish coaching staff hopes to make this event the top lacrosse clinic in the Midwest. They want the clinic to be anannual event that coaches can attend with members of their respective programs. Over 50 coaches from New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Canadaalready are registered.\n\n8. The University of Alaska scored twice in the first 4:23 of the game on Saturday night and goaltender Scott Greenham made it stand up as the Nanooks snapped Notre Dame’s four-game hockey unbeaten streak (3-0-1) with a 4-1 win in front of a sellout crowd at the Joyce Center. Defenseman Scott Enders and forward Jarret Granberg staked Alaska to the quick 2-0 lead and added goals in the third period by Carlo Finucci and Nik Yaremchuk on the way to the important CCHA road win. Greenham stopped 26 of 27 shots to pick up his 10th win of the season. Freshman Mike Voran scored the lone goal for the Irish.\n\nThe loss dropped the eighth-ranked Irish to 15-8-3 overall and 12-5-1-1 in the CCHA. They remain in first in the conference with a one-point lead over Michigan and the Wolverines have one game in hand. Alaska improves to 10-8-4 overall and is back to .500 in the conference with a 7-7-4-2 record in the league.\n\nOn Friday night, Irish sophomore goaltender Mike Johnson stopped 34 of 35 Alaska shots and got goals from Anders Lee and Nick Larson as Notre Dame held off the Nanooks for a 2-1 win in front of a sell-out crowd of 2,857 at the Joyce Center. Johnson was 23 seconds away from his first shutout of the season when Alaska’s Aaron Gens was able to bang a centering pass behind him with the Nanooks playing with a sixth attacker.\n\n9.

Skylar Diggins scored 20 points and #12 Notre Dame used an early 14-2 run to build a substantial lead en route to an 82-50 women’s basketball victory over Pittsburgh on Saturday. Devereaux Peters added 15 points and 10 rebounds, and Natalie Novosel scored 15 for the Fighting Irish (15-4, 4-1 BIG EAST), who beat Pittsburgh (9-8, 1-3) for the 20th time in 23 games.

St. John’s turned things around against Notre Dame with defense, smothering perimeter defense. Eight days after a 15-point men’s basketball loss at Notre Dame, St. John’s beat the Irish 72-54 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. It’s hard to imagine that two games played between the same teams just eight days apart could be more different. St. John’s, wh"
