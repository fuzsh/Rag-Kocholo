        "text": "High school\n\nedit\n\nBeloit High School (1959–1965)\n\nWith his football playing career over, Keady returned to Kansas in 1959 where he accepted a teaching and coaching position at Beloit Junior-Senior High School in Beloit, Kansas. The only coaching position open at the school was for the basketball team. Keady coached in Beloit for six years from 1959 to 1965. Keady understood the value of education and never stopped learning, even while he was coaching. In 1964, he earned his master's degree in education from Kansas State. While coaching high school basketball, he compiled a record of 142 wins to 47 losses (.751).\n\nCollege\n\nedit\n\nHutchinson Junior College (1965–1974)\n\nKeady began his college coaching career with Hutchinson Junior College in Hutchinson, Kansas. He served as the assistant coach for the Blue Dragons starting in 1965. After only one year, Keady was promoted to take over the head coaching position. Under Keady's leadership the Blue Dragons won six Jayhawk Conference titles, and Keady earned the title of junior college coach of the year three times (1971, 1972, 1973) for his region.[5] The highlight of his early coaching career came in 1973 when Hutchinson finished second in the junior college national tournament after completing the season with 29 wins and 4 losses. His overall record at Hutchinson was 187–48 (.796).\n\nArkansas (1975–1978)\n\nFollowing the 1974 season, Keady moved into NCAA Division I college basketball as an assistant coach for Arkansas. Head coach Eddie Sutton and Keady made the Razorbacks into a perennial national contender. In 1977, Arkansas appeared in the NCAA tournament for the first time in nineteen years. In 1978, Arkansas made it to the Final Four. Although they lost a close game to Kentucky, making it to the Final Four was a huge success for Keady and Sutton. While at Arkansas, Keady gained fame for his impressive recruiting skills. Notable players recruited by Keady include Ron Brewer, Marvin Delph and Sidney Moncrief. During his time at Arkansas, the team accumulated 94 wins with 24 losses (.797).\n\nWestern Kentucky (1978–1980)\n\nFollowing the third-place finish in the 1978 NCAA tournament, Keady was ready to lead his own team to the tournament. In 1978, he accepted the position of head coach for Western Kentucky University. In his first year as a division one head coach, the team went 17–11, and finished tied for second in the conference. The team improved in his second year to go 21–8 and be named the regular season Ohio Valley Conference Co-Champions. The team won the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament and earned a berth in the NCAA tournament. In the first round the team played Virginia Tech, but lost in overtime. While at Western Kentucky, Keady and assistant coach Bruce Weber compiled an overall record of 38–19 (.667).\n\nPurdue (1980–2005)\n\nGene Keady became the Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball head coach on April 11, 1980. Keady became the winningest coach in school history with 493 victories and second winningest coach in Big Ten Conference history, only behind former rival, Bob Knight, and was the Big Ten Coach of the Year a record seven times. He guided the Boilermakers to 6 Big Ten titles, including three straight outright crowns from 1994 through 1996. Keady hired Matt Painter (1989–1993), as his associate head coach for the 2004–2005 season. He was selected to take over the head coaching position.\n\nKeady retired from coaching Purdue following the 2004–2005 season after leading Purdue to 18 NCAA tournament appearances. He took the Boilermakers to two Elite Eight appearances and five total Sweet Sixteen appearances. His total NCAA tournament postseason record is 20–19. He led Purdue to five NIT appearances with a record of 12–5 and a Runner-up and third-place finish. Mackey Arena's basketball court was named \"Keady Court\" in dedication to him. In October 2006, Keady was named the recipient of the 2007 John R. Wooden \"Legends of Coaching\" Award. Keady is the ninth recipient of this award, as it was created in 1999. While coaching at Purdue, Gene was quoted by saying, \"Recruiting is a lot like shaving, if you miss a day, you look like a bum.\"[6]\n\nHis tenure at Purdue was notable in the number of wins he achieved, despite coaching only one All-American: Glenn Robinson (1993 Consensus 2nd Team & 1994 Consensus 1st Team, Consensus National Player of the Year). Seven of his other players also earned honors from the All-American selectors: Keith Edmonson (1982 AP Honorable Mention); Troy Lewis (1987 & 1988 AP Honorable Mention), Todd Mitchell (1988 NABC 3rd Team, AP Honorable Mention); Steve Scheffler (1990 AP & UPI 3rd Team), Cuonzo Martin (1995 AP Honorable Mention); Chad Austin (1998 AP Honorable Mention), Brad Miller (1998 AP Honorable Mention).\n\nSt. John's (2010–2015)\n\nIn October 2010, newly hired St. John's coach Steve Lavin hired Keady to be his assistant coach.[7] His main roles as an assistant to Lavin were breaking down game film and serving as a bench coach on game days.\n\nInternational\n\nedit\n\nAs the head coach of various USA Basketball teams, Keady racked up a record of 22–2 (.917) in four different tournaments from 1979 to 1991. He led Team USA to two gold medals: one in 1979 at the National Sports Festival, and another in 1989 at the World University Games. Keady also grabbed the silver medal in 1985 at the R. Williams Jones Cup (the 9th edition of the tournament) losing to the San Miguel Beer Team (Philippines) 108–100 OT.[8]\n\nHe led Team USA to the bronze at the 1991 Pan-American Games.\n\nDream Team (2000)\n\nIn 2000, Keady was an assistant coach for the Dream Team;[9] while coaches are not awarded medals, the team won the gold medal in the Olympic Games in Sydney.\n\nProfessional\n\nedit\n\nToronto Raptors (2005–2006)"
