        "text": "I put Lavin as my # 2 behind Pearl. I was suprised to see that there were quite a few others that had him listed in their top 5.\n\nSo... I'm kind of posting this to bump this thread and see reasons why people wouldn't want him as our next coach.\n\nLavin, emmmmmmmmmmm............no. He is a tool working games and would not fit at Iowa. Don't need a nother guy with a nice head of hair running about IC. He might be able to recruit but his coaching skills lack, keep him where he is.\n\nDuring Lavinâ€™s tenure as head coach, the Bruins qualified for six consecutive NCAA Tournaments (1997-2002). During this period, Lavin became one of two coaches (along Dukeâ€™s Mike Krzyzewski) to have led his team to five NCAA Sweet 16s in six seasons. Lavinâ€™s record in the first and second rounds of the NCAA tournament is 10-1. Lavinâ€™s winning percentage (90.9%) in the first two rounds, is second only to Dean Smith in NCAA Tournament history.\n\nIn seven seasons as head coach Lavinâ€™s record was 12-4 in games involving overtime. Additionally Lavin's Bruins had a 10-4 record against the rival USC Trojans. In one stretch (1997-2002) Lavinâ€™s Bruins compiled nine consecutive overtime victories, including victories over Arizona, Cincinnati (2002 NCAA second round double overtime victory over No. 1 West Region seed), Kentucky, and over then #1 ranked Stanford).\n\nLavinâ€™s Bruins team had a knack for knocking off #1 teams. Lavin lead his team to victory over the No. 1 team in the country in four consecutive collegiate seasons (Arizona â€™03, Kansas â€™02, Stanford â€™01, and Stanford â€™00).\n\nWho uses more Gel... Alford or Lavin?\n\nI'm going to go with Lavin, even though he has been using less in recent years. He was in love with Payne during the Michigan game on Thursday, and said several times that Iowa is a team with the pieces in place.\n\nLavin, emmmmmmmmmmm............no. He is a tool working games and would not fit at Iowa. Don't need a nother guy with a nice head of hair running about IC. He might be able to recruit but his coaching skills lack, keep him where he is.\n\nI think that a coach that is a great recruiter may be the most important aspect for the next Iowa coach. Our current talent is the problem that we can't currently compete in the Big Ten and we don't have the in state talent to make up the deficit. We need a coach who can convince high school players across the country to come to play at CHA.\n\nI think Lavin is a guy that the high school students will recongize from his broadcasting and when he can tell them about his success at UCLA, they would really be excited to come play for him.\n\nIn 7 years as the UCLA head coach he made the tourney six times, including 4 sweet 16 and 1 elite eight. He did pretty well for a guy you claim to lack coaching skills.\n\nLive in the now, when was the last time the coached, recruited or done his own hair? I seriously can't believe the love fest for this guy. He has no ties to the program, who knows what kind of assistant coaches he would bring in, who knows how quick he would leave if he revived the program for a bigger check? The guy is a tool, there is a reason why he has been working for ESPN and not coaching. Recruiting to UCLA is one thing, tyng to recruit to Iowa is another. I would puke if I heard this guys name called as coach, just horrible, just threw up in my mouth.\n\nAssistant Coach of the 1995 National Champion UCLA Bruins.\n\n1997 Rookie Coach of the Year.\n\n6 Consecutive NCAA Tournaments.\n\n1997 Elite Eight\n\n5 Sweet Sixteens\n\n2001 Pac-10 Coach Of The Year\n\nIn March 2003, after twelve years on the UCLA staff, Lavin had his first losing season (10-19) as a head coach and was relieved of his duties.\n\nDuring Lavin's tenure as a head coach, he was one of only two coaches in the country, along with Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, to lead his team to five NCAA \"Sweet 16s\" in six years ('02, '01, '00, '98, '97). Lavin guided UCLA to six consecutive 20+ game winning seasons and to six consecutive NCAA tournaments. As head coach, his career record in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament is 10-1.\n\nSounds like someone I used to know.......hmmm? Why is Steve Lavin's coaching career ringing so many bells.......why oh why?.....\n\nPerhaps he stayed in commentary because he wasn't offered enough money to a.) give it up for something he had been 98 percent successful at, and FIRED!, or b.) it wasn't EXACTLY (financially, geographically), what he was looking for, or c.) it wasn't the situation he wanted to step into.........for the right amount of green, anybody will come to Iowa City to be the hand that returns Iowa to national prominence. I cannot believe your HATE for Lavin......the guy has done nothing but win...."
