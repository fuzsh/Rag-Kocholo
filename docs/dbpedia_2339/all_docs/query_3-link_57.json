        "text": "Friday, February 7, 1997\n\nM. HOOPS:\n\nBears crash boards, outrebound UCLA 41-31 in 71-68 victoryBy Hye\n\nKwon and Emmanuelle Ejercito\n\nDaily Bruin Staff\n\nThe Bruins received a thorough lesson in glass cleaning from the\n\nCalifornia Golden Bears on Thursday night and, unfortunately for\n\nthem, it wasn’t part of some inter-UC vocational skills exchange\n\nprogram.\n\nInstead, they were schooled in the art of rebounding on the\n\nfloor of Pauley Pavilion, and upon the game’s merciful end, the\n\nBruins had suffered a 71-68 loss and their streak of 18 consecutive\n\nhome conference victories was history.\n\nWith the loss, UCLA (12-7 overall, 7-3 Pacific 10) is now tied\n\nfor first place in conference with Cal, USC (which beat Stanford on\n\nThursday) and Arizona.\n\n\"Obviously our players knew this game was for first place and it\n\nwas big for our program,\" Cal head coach Ben Braun said. \"UCLA has\n\nbeen pretty darn near perfect at home … and it’s not easy to come\n\nin here and win. It shows that our guys have heart.\"\n\nIronically, the last Pac-10 team that was able to withstand\n\nUCLA’s home court advantage was Cal, which came away victorious in\n\nJanuary 1995. This time, the single most important key to the\n\nBears’ success was their rebounding prowess against the Bruins.\n\nUCLA was outrebounded 41-31 overall by the Bears, which sent a\n\ncontingent of big men to outmuscle the Bruins’ thin frontline.\n\nUnderneath their own basket, in particular, the Bruins allowed Cal\n\nto pull down 22 offensive rebounds while tallying just 18 defensive\n\nrebounds to their credit.\n\n\"Rebounding, I thought, was about as far as you have to look,\"\n\nUCLA head coach Steve Lavin said. \"They came in and out-competed us\n\non the glass. I’ve said before, rebounding is like the line of\n\nscrimmage in football. They dominated us down the trenches, both on\n\nthe defensive and offensive boards.\n\n\"Once again, we’re minus 10 (in rebounding margin) to a Pac-10\n\nopponent, and every time we’re minus double figures in rebounding\n\nmargin we lose.\"\n\nDespite its inability to rebound in key situations, UCLA had two\n\nchances to tie the score in the game’s waning moments. With roughly\n\n20 seconds remaining on the clock and the Bruins down 69-66, Toby\n\nBailey’s three-point attempt caromed off the rim. Fifteen seconds\n\nlater, Bailey again had a chance to tie the score from 22 feet, but\n\nhis shot was about a foot short.\n\nCal’s Ed Gray, who came into Thursday’s game as the leading\n\nscorer in the conference, did not disappoint; he led all scorers\n\nwith 29 points. Gray’s backcourt partner, Randy Duck, however, was\n\nflying much higher than expectations.\n\nWith four minutes remaining in the second half and UCLA on a 6-0\n\nrun to make the score 64-58, the senior guard scored the Bears’\n\nnext seven points. Duck’s timely contribution allowed Braun’s team\n\nto stay close and launch a decisive 6-2 run to secure the\n\nvictory.\n\nDuck finished the game with a total of 19 points, helping the\n\nBears avenge the loss they suffered against UCLA back in\n\nJanuary.\n\n\"The swing in the two games was that we outrebounded them by 10\n\nup there and they outrebounded us by 10 down here,\" Lavin said.\n\n\"This is a continuing problem. We have to rebound the ball, and\n\nagainst Stanford (on Saturday), it’s not going to get any\n\neasier.\"\n\nLast month at Maples Pavilion, UCLA could only grab 26 rebounds\n\nto the Cardinal’s 45, one of the factors that led to the 48-point\n\npummeling the Bruins received.\n\nUCLA looks for the rematch to provide a different story.\n\n\"Forty-eight points, that was a fluke,\" junior forward J.R.\n\nHenderson said. \"They shot 15 three-pointers; that’s not going to\n\nhappen again.\"\n\nBut it’s not just Bruin pride that is on the line. In the midst\n\nof a four-way tie in the Pac-10 for the top spot, UCLA faces a\n\nmust-win situation. Stanford (13-5, 6-4) lurks only one game behind\n\neven after losing to USC Thursday night, 84-81.\n\n\"Stanford presents an unbelievable challenge because they\n\nprobably have the best big-little combination in the country (and)\n\nwhen you have that kind of a dynamic and dangerous big-and-little\n\ncombo then that presents a great, great challenge.\"\n\nThe little half of the combo is the best point guard in the\n\nPac-10 and one of the best in the country. Brevin Knight set the\n\ntone for the Cardinal against the Bruins the last time they played,\n\nscoring 25 points, 18 of which came from three-pointers. The\n\n5-foot-10-inch senior leads the league in assists with 7.6 per\n\ngame. He is also the top scorer for Stanford, averaging 16.5 points\n\nper game.\n\nOn the big side of the combination is Tim Young. Young, who\n\naverages 8.5 rebounds, presented a problem for UCLA in the paint\n\nfour weeks ago by grabbing 10 rebounds. It will be essential to\n\ncontain him if the Bruins want to dominate the boards.\n\n\"We definitely can’t drop anymore (games), especially at home,\"\n\nHenderson said. \"We have to play hard against Stanford and just let\n\n(the Cal) loss go.\"\n\nWYNN RUJIRAVIRIYAPINYO"
