        "text": "NORMAL, Ill. - With all fans encouraged to wear black on Saturday evening, the Redbirds will look to Black Out the Beacons of Valparaiso, as the 'Birds host Valpo in a 6 p.m. tip-off inside CEFCU Arena.\n\nQUICK HITTERS\n\n• The Saturday game is the final home Saturday contest for the Redbirds in the 2022-23 season.\n\n• The Redbirds are fifth in NCAA Division I in free throw percentage, making 80.1 percent of their free tries during the season.\n\n• Illinois State senior forward Kendall Lewis is one of four players in NCAA Division I with at least 17 blocks, 27 assists, 32 steals and 200 points this season.\n\n• ISU junior guard Malachi Poindexter has made 30 consecutive free throws to open the 2022-23 season, which is the highest total with a perfect percentage in the country this season. Since 1992-93 there have been just three players in the NCAA to remain perfect on a season in free throw percentage with at least 30 attempts and makes.\n\n• Illinois State seventh leading scorer (Colton Sandage) averages 7.24 points per game, which is the second-highest seventh-leading scorer in the MVC this season.\n\n• This season the Redbirds have seven different players who have led the team in scoring, including a seven-game span in which ISU had seven different leading scorers.\n\n• In NCAA Division I basketball this season there are 38 men's basketball players who have attempted at least 10 free throws in conference play without a miss. Of those 38, 11 have made at least 15, including two Redbirds - Malachi Poindexter and Kendall Lewis.\n\n• Malachi Poindexter's current streak of 30 made free throws is the third-longest in Illinois State basketball history, and tied for the 26th-longest in MVC basketball history.\n\n• When Illinois State topped Missouri State by 10 in overtime on January 11, it marked the fourth-largest scoring margin in an overtime game in Redbird history.\n\n• Illinois State is 142-124 all-time against teams from the state of Indiana, and are 1-2 against teams from the state this season.\n\n• As Illinois State head coach Ryan Pedon adjusts his starting lineups to find the proper mix, the Redbirds have seen nine different starting lineup combinations in 20 games, which is the eighth-most different starting lineups in the country this season.\n\n• This season Illinois State has eight games against school with Purple as one of their school colors, the most games in a season in program history.\n\n• Illinois State closed the fall semester with a 3.04 grade point average, a new program record for a season (excluding the COVID year where the majority of classes were conducted pass/fail).\n\nSCOUTING THE BEACONS\n\nValparaiso is bringing a two-game win streak into CEFCU Arena on Saturday afternoon, including a 76-66 win at home over the UIC Flames on Tuesday evening.\n\nIn the win over the Flames, Kobe King scored a team-high 24 points, while Ben Krikke scored 16 and Nick Edwards 13. Quinton Green grabbed a team-best seven rebounds, while Edwards gave out a team-high seven assists and three steals.\n\nThis season Krikke and King lead the team in scoring, averaging 17.8 and 17.2 points per game, respectively, while Green averages 10.7 and Edwards 7.9. Krikke pulls down a team-leading 5.8 rebounds per game, while Edwards has dished out 97 assists over 20 games, while also leading the team with 29 steals.\n\nPUTTING THE FREE IN FREE THROWS\n\nThis season, having made 278 of 347 free throws, Illinois State ranks fifth in NCAA Division I in the category. There have been just 21 schools in NCAA Division I history to finish a season with a free throw percentage at .800 or better. The school record for season free throw percentage is .775 from the 2001-02 season.\n\nSTRONG OVERALL NUMBERS\n\nLater in the notes we talk about how last season ISU forward Kendall Lewis had one of just four total seasons in program history with 30+ blocks, steals, and assists. Lewis is back to his same tricks this season, as he is one of just three players in NCAA Division I with at least 17 blocks, 32 steals, and 27 assists this season, while scoring at least 200 points.\n\nSTRIVING FOR PERFECTION\n\nEvery season, all players strive for perfection on the basketball court. Through 20 games in the 2022-23 season, Illinois State junior guard Malachi Poindexter has accomplished that at the free throw line, as he is a perfect 30-for-30 at the charity stripe. No one in the country is perfect at the free throw line this season with as many makes as Poindexter, as the closest comes from Kent State's 21.\n\nHISTORICALLY ACCURATE\n\nSince 1992-93 there have been just 10 student-athletes to not miss during a season while making at least 20 free throws. This season through 19 games, Malachi Poindexter remains perfect with 27 makes, which is the third-most on the current list, which includes former Redbird Dirk Williams who went the entire 2001-02 season without a miss, going 24-of-24 at the charity stripe.\n\nSEVENTH HEAVEN\n\nThis season Illinois State has seven different student-athletes averaging at least seven points per game and is one of just two schools in the conference to have their seventh scorer at 7.0 points per game or better (of those who have played in at least half of their team's games).\n\nCONFERENCE PLAY PERFECTION\n\nAcross all of NCAA Division I, there are 33 men's basketball players who have attempted at least 10 free throws in conference play without a miss. Of those 33, eight have made 15 or more free throws, and of those eight, two are members of the Illinois State squad, as Malachi Poindexter is 20-of-20 in MVC play while Kendall Lewis is 15-of-15.\n\nWE'RE GOING STREAKING\n\nWhile it's not quite through the quad and into the gymnasium, it is to the free throw line, where Malachi Poindexter has made all 30 free throws he has attempted this season. That stands just behind the second-longest free throw streak in program history, held by Gene Jontry from the 1956-57 season (35). The school record is held by Vince Greene, who made 57 consecutive free throws between the end of the 2003-04 season and through the beginning of the 2004-05 season.\n\nHis 30 consecutive makes also ties him for the 26th-longest consecutive free throw streak in MVC history.\n\nLUCKY NUMBER SEVEN\n\nOver a seven-game stretch ending with Chicago State on December 19, Illinois State saw seven different players lead the team in scoring, starting with the Cayman Islands Classic final game against Rhode Island where Kendall Lewis led the team in scoring. Seneca Knight led the team in scoring against Murray State while Liam McChesney recorded the team scoring leader against Belmont. Against Eastern Michigan Colton Sandage paced the 'Birds while Darius Burford led the team against SIUE, Malachi Poindexter against Ball State and Luke Kasubke against Chicago State.\n\nFIRST-YEAR HEAD COACHES IN NCAA DIVISION I\n\nIllinois State head coach Ryan Pedon is one of a surprisingly-large 59 head coaches that will be in their first season at their current schools - the list does not include four head coaches this season: Steve Prohm at Murray State, Thad Matta at Butler, Ed Conroy at the Citadel, and Lorenzo Romar at Pepperdine who are in their first year in their second stints at their school (as of games played on January 18)\n\nGRABBING THE REBOUNDS\n\nAgainst Indiana State on January 4, the Redbirds saw their seven-game streak of not being out-rebounded snapped. That streak is the third longest by an Illinois State squad since the 1983-84 season.\n\nPLAYING THE LONG GAME\n\nAfter Illinois State's season-opening loss, Illinois State's 20 head coaches have a 13-7 combined record in their first game on the sidelines for ISU. Of the coaches that won the 13 games, none have led Illinois State to an NCAA Tournament berth. On the other side of the ledger, each of Illinois State's last five head coaches to lose their ISU opener have taken the Redbirds to a NCAA tournament appearance in their career.\n\nBIG SERIES TOTALS\n\nIllinois State has a long and storied basketball history and has faced off against eight different opponents over 100 times each. The Redbirds have faced Wednesday's opponent - Northern Iowa - 88 times previously in each program's history, which is the eighth-most all-time in school history.\n\nFINDING THE RIGHT MIX\n\nDue to a number of factors, Illinois State head coach Ryan Pedon has been forced to change up his lineup nine different times, which is the eighth-highest total in the country this season.\n\nNEWCOMER OF THE WEEK\n\nBehind a week in which he averaged 22 points and the Redbirds won a pair of games, Illinois State fifth-year guard Colton Sandage was named the Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Week. He averaged 22 points and 4.5 rebounds per game in a week in which the Redbirds went 2-0 – and 3-0 over a seven-day stretch with the team's win over Belmont on Sunday.\n\nALLITERATIVE ADVANTAGE\n\nThere are 37 schools whose school name starts with the same letter as its mascot. Of those 37, the Redbirds face off against five different opponents, accounting for eight total games as three schools (Belmont, Bradley, and Southern Illinois) are in the MVC alongside the Redbirds (Chicago State Cougars and Eastern Michigan Eagles are the other two schools that ISU faces this season. (credit for the idea behind the note goes to ISU MBB assistant coach Andrew Dakich)\n\nALL-TOURNAMENT TEAM\n\nWith his three-games at the Cayman Islands Classic, Illinois State fifth-year guard Seneca Knight was named to the All-Tournament Team at the event. He averaged 13.0 points, 7.3 rebounds - both leading the team - while also grabbing three steals and dishing out five assists over the three games.\n\nPURPLE REIGN\n\nThis season Illinois State has eight games scheduled against schools with purple as one of their school colors (or violet, if you're a Roy G Biv kind of person). Those eight games represent the most such games in a season in program history, topping the previous high-water mark of seven set four different times, most recently in 2014-15 when the 'Birds faced Weber State, and three games each against UNI and Evansville. There are 23 schools in NCAA Division I with purple/violet as one of their school colors including: Albany, Alcorn State, Central Arkansas, Clemson, East Carolina, Furman, High Point, Holy Cross, James Madison, Kansas State, Lipscomb, LSU, Niagara, Northwestern, Northwestern State, Portland, Stephen F. Austin, Tennessee Tech, TCU, Washington, Weber State, Western Carolina, and Western Illinois. (credit for the idea behind this note goes to men's basketball graduate assistant Jack Betz).\n\nBIG MARGIN IN THE BONUS PERIOD\n\nIn Illinois State's win over Missouri State - the second consecutive season that the two teams have gone into overtime in Normal - the Redbirds out-scored the Bears 15-5 in overtime. The 10-point overtime win margin is the fourth-highest in an overtime game in program history.\n\nILLINOIS STATE VS THE HOOSIER STATE\n\nThere are 10 NCAA Division I schools inside of the state border of Indiana, including three within the Missouri Valley Conference. The program is 143-124 all-time against teams from the Hoosier State, including a 67-62 mark against Indiana State and 46-21 against Evansville.\n\nSAME ARENA, NEW NAME\n\nIllinois State University and CEFCU (pronounced SEFF-Q) have come to terms on a naming rights and sponsorship agreement valued at approximately $3.1 million over 10 years. The agreement, which will support the funding for ongoing and ever-evolving costs associated with the student-athlete experience, was initiated by LEARFIELD's Redbird Sports Properties, the University's athletics multimedia rightsholder. The former Redbird Arena will be known as CEFCU Arena – Home of the Redbirds, with the University's Board of Trustees approving the arena name change at its October 14 meeting. The CEFCU Arena naming rights and sponsorship agreement will continue to support funding of the Redbird Student-Athlete experience. Particularly in these ever-evolving times, funding is vital to maintaining and expanding upon the current NCAA, Division I student-athlete experience.\n\nNON-STATE STATE SCHOOLS\n\nThere are 358 NCAA Division I schools (including the transitional schools) playing basketball this season. Of those schools, 67 have \"State\" in its name. Of that 67, 31 are direct state schools (ie, Illinois State), while five others have the state in their name, but with a descriptor (Central Connecticut, East Tennessee, Southeast Missouri). The remainder of the schools - 31 total - have no direct state reference in its name (Boise State, Wichita State, etc.) but use State in the name. Of that group, Illinois State will face off against four such schools in the non-conference season: Murray, Northwestern, Chicago, and Ball.\n\nBABY BIRD AND PROUD PAPA\n\nIllinois State Assistant Basketball Coach, Walter Offutt, and his wife Nicole are the proud parents of a healthy baby boy. We wish Coach Offutt and his family the best. Current Men's Basketball Chief of Staff, Mike Mastroianni, will cover the assistant basketball coach role while Coach Offutt is on parental leave.\n\nREDBIRDS SIGN THREE TO NLI's\n\nIn his first signing class as head coach of the Illinois State Redbirds, ISU head men's basketball coach Ryan Pedon has announced that three future Redbirds: Johnny Kinziger, Ty Pence, and Chase Walker; have signed their National Letters of Intent to play for ISU starting in the 2023-24 season.\n\nJohnny Kinziger, a 6-0 point guard, is a two-time All-State honoree at De Pere, Wisconsin. Last season he averaged 21 points, four points, and four assists per game, and is 150 points away from becoming his school's all-time leading scorer.\n\nTy Pence is a 6-6 guard from St. Joseph's, Illinois, and is also a two-time All-State performer. The second highest nationally-rated recruit in program history, he is ranked 188th nationally after averaging 23.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game last season.\n\nThe third and final signee is 6-9 forward Chase Walker, from Columbus, Ohio. Walker was named to the Ohio High School Athletic Association Division I Special Mention list after averaging 17.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per game, earning him Central Catholic League Player of the Year accolades.\n\nCONSECUTIVE 10+ REBOUND GAMES TO OPEN SEASON\n\nKendall Lewis had reached double-figure rebounds in each of the team's first three games, becoming one of just seven players in school history to open the season with at least two straight double-figure games, before the stretch was snapped with a seven rebound game in the team's fourth game of the season.\n\nMILESTONE REACHED\n\nOn a three-pointer with 12:35 to play in the first half against Western Kentucky, Illinois State fifth-year guard Seneca Knight scored his 1,000th career point between his time at San Jose State, BYU, and now at Illinois State.\n\nSETTING RECORDS IN THE CLASSROOM\n\nThe Illinois State men's basketball team closed its 2022 fall semester with a grade point average of 3.04, a new program record (not counting the COVID season).\n\nREBOUNDING IN THE OPENER\n\nWith his 14 rebounds in the 2022-23 season opener against Western Illinois, Redbird forward Kendall Lewis tied for the third-most total rebounds in the opening game of the season in program history.\n\nRARE 30-30-30\n\nLast season Illinois State senior forward Kendall Lewis has 38 steals, 32 blocked shots, and 33 assists. Since 1993-94, only 30 players in the MVC have put up at least 30 points, 30 steals, and 30 assists in a single season, and he is one of just two players - along with Cameron Krutwig - to do it since 2017-18. He is the first Redbird since 2007-08 to be a part of the 30-30-30 club, and one of four players in school history to be a part of the group. Additionally, including Lewis, there are just 16 players in the country this season with at least 32 in all three categories.\n\nTALL TEAM\n\nWith the team having six players standing 6-8 or taller, this Illinois State squad has the fifth-tallest average height of any team in program history with an average height of 6-6, this years' team trails the tallest two teams (1976-77 and 1987-88) by just over 1/10 of an inch per player. Below are the top-10 tallest and shortest Illinois State teams since 1962-63.\n\nBIG MAKES\n\nIncoming Illinois State transfer Joe Petrakis made 58 three-point baskets last season. While a big number of itself, it is especially rare with how big Petrakis is. Last season he was one of just seven players in NCAA Division I to be 6-10 or taller and make 50 three-pointers in a season. Of those seven, just four are playing collegiate basketball in 2022-23.\n\nLOCAL FLAIR\n\nWhen new Illinois State head coach Ryan Pedon brought in Colton Sandage on scholarship, he became the first Bloomington/Normal resident to be brought in on scholarship since his brother, Brandon, in 2005-09. Lijah Donnelly, who initially came to ISU as a walk-on was given a scholarship during his second season. Since 1962-63, there have been just 11 Redbird men's basketball players from the pair of towns.\n\nRETURN TO HORTON\n\nFor many longtime Redbird fans, some of their fondest memories of Illinois State basketball come from games that were hosted inside historic Horton Field House. Since 1989, CEFCU Arena has served as host of Redbird basketball games but for one day only, ISU men's basketball returned to Horton Field House with Redbird legend Doug Collins in attendance on December 10 when the Redbirds topped SIU Edwardsville 77-71 in front of 3,420 loud ISU fans.\n\nHorton Fieldhouse – which was the home of the Redbird basketball program from its opening on December 4, 1963, through the previously last played contest on December 2, 1988. The arena played host to numerous classic ISU victories, including: a 91-81 win over ninth-ranked Tulsa during the 1984 season; an 81-76 win over fourth-ranked Indiana State – featuring future NBA Hall of Famer Larry Bird – during the 1977-78 season; and an 88-84 win over fourth-ranked UNLV in 1977.\n\nNEW TEAM (IMPACT) TEAM MEMBER\n\nIllinois State men's basketball head coach Ryan Pedon has announced the signing of Benjamin Elementary School second grader Ty Andracke at a press conference held inside CEFCU Arena on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe Bloomington, Illinois, native signed his draft-day letter in the presence of his family and newest teammates. The group celebrated Ty's signing with a photo shoot and dinner.\n\nAndracke was connected with Redbird men's basketball through Team IMPACT, a national nonprofit organization that connects children facing serious or chronic illnesses with collegiate athletic programs, forming life-long bonds and life-changing outcomes. Children in the program are drafted to a team on a special signing day planned by their teammates.\n\nAs a member of the ISU men's basketball family, Ty will attend Redbird practices, games, team dinners, events and more.\n\nSince 2011, Team IMPACT has matched more than 1,700 children with more than 500 colleges and universities in 49 states, reaching over 50,000 participating student-athletes. The child joins the athletic team, and the student-athletes join the child's support team. Throughout the journey, the child gains strength, camaraderie, and support while the student-athletes experience lessons of courage, resiliency, and perspective they can't learn in a classroom.\n\nSTARTED FROM THE BOTTOM NOW WE'RE HERE"
