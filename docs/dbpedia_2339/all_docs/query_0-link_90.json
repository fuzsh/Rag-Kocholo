        "text": "Earlier this week, Arizona State athletic director Ray Anderson made the decision to part ways with men’s head basketball coach Herb Sendek.\n\nFriday, St. John’s came to a similar conclusion with their head coach, Steve Lavin, in what was described as a “mutual parting.”\n\nSo does that mean Lavin should be considered a candidate for the vacant job in Tempe?\n\nOur own Paul Calvisi indicated as much on Twitter Friday afternoon.\n\nArizona Sports’ morning co-host has also tweeted on the matter.\n\nLavin, 50, spent the last five seasons at St. John’s, leading the Red Storm to a 92-72 record and two NCAA Tournament appearances in that span.\n\nThis season, St. John’s went 21-12 and was eliminated by San Diego State in the second round, 76-64.\n\nPrior to his stint in New York, Lavin worked as a college basketball broadcaster. Before that, he was the head coach at UCLA from 1996 to 2003. The Bruins made five straight NCAA Tournament trips, including an advancement to the Elite 8 in the coach’s first season in L.A.\n\nCheck out all the ASU coaching candidates here."
