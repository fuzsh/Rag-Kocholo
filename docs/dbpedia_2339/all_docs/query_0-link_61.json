        "text": "Steve Lavin hears the chatter about his tenuous job status, and he has a rebuttal to his detractors.\n\nIt’s a good sign the fans want to “fire the coach” when St. John’s loses.\n\nLavin used the on-the-bubble Johnnies’ 85-72 victory over Seton Hall in front of a sold-out Carnesecca Arena crowd to prop himself up, mentioning the players he has sent to the NBA — Maurice Harkless and JaKarr Sampson — and saying this season would be different if they were still around. He talked about making the Red Storm relevant by landing nationally ranked recruits and having the Johnnies on the verge of their second straight 20-win season as proof of the kind of job he’s done as he enters the home stretch of his fifth season with the team.\n\n“We’ve become relevant and we have sellout crowds like this and fans who are engaged and care and get upset when we lose [and say], ‘Get rid of the coach,’ ” Lavin said, unprompted. “That means we did our job. When you have fans that are passionate, that really care, as opposed of the apathy we’ve had for 10 or 12 years here.\n\n“I understand the racket.”\n\nWith just one year left on his initial six-year contract, Lavin’s future at St. John’s is unknown. Multiple sources said they believe his fate will be tied to how this finishes, as Lavin either will be offered a contract extension, if the Red Storm reach the NCAA Tournament, or have his final year bought out if the Johnnies fail to qualify for the field of 68.\n\nHe led the Red Storm to the NCAA Tournament in his first year, with predecessor Norm Roberts’ players, and hasn’t been back since. He coached just four games in his second season because of prostate cancer. He has a 2-6 postseason record — one Big East Tournament victory and one NIT win — and at the moment next season’s roster is uncertain, losing key seniors D’Angelo Harrison, Phil Greene IV, Jamal Branch and Sir’Dominic Pointer. Just two recruits — guards Samir Doughty of Philadelphia and top-50 Louisiana guard Brandon Sampson — have committed to Lavin at the moment.\n\nThe coach, however, feels his body of work speaks for itself.\n\n“Every season now we’re in the hunt for the tournament or we’re going to be in the tournament or we’re doing something in the postseason,” Lavin said. “That was the job I was asked to do when I came here.”\n\nAt halftime, St. John’s honored it’s Class of 2015 Hall of Fame, including all-time leading scorer Chris Mullin, pitcher C.J. Nitkowski and women’s basketball player Kia Wright, among others."
