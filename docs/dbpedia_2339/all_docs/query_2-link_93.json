        "text": "In his first six seasons as U.C.L.A.'s coach, Steve Lavin took the Bruins to the N.C.A.A. tournament's Round of 16 five times. Mike Krzyzewski of Duke was the only other coach to do the same during that time span.\n\nBut this season, Lavin's seventh, the Bruins finished 10-19, and yesterday Lavin paid the price. As he and everyone else expected, he was fired.\n\nLavin's contract had five years remaining. He will receive one year of his full salary of $578,000 and four years of his base salary of $153,000.\n\nDan Guerrero, U.C.L.A.'s first-year athletic director, also fired Bob Toledo in December after seven seasons as the football coach. Guerrero said of Lavin's firing: ''Decisions like this are always tough. However, if this program is to regain its place among the nation's elite, I felt a change was required.''\n\nThe 10-19 record was U.C.L.A.'s worst since it went 5-18 in the 1941-42 season under Wilbur Johns. This was U.C.L.A.'s first losing season since Johns's 1947-48 team. Johns was then fired and replaced by John Wooden, who made U.C.L.A. the most successful team in college basketball.\n\nUnder Wooden, the Bruins won 10 national championships between 1964 and 1975. Then Wooden retired, and U.C.L.A. basketball has been unsettled since. The first four coaches after Wooden resigned. The next three -- Walt Hazzard, Jim Harrick and Lavin -- were fired.\n\nHarrick won the national championship in 1995, when Lavin was an assistant. When Harrick was fired before the start of the 1996-97 season, Lavin took over.\n\nDespite Lavin's overall record of 145-78, his job security was often shaky. Two years ago, Peter Dalis, then the U.C.L.A. athletic director, talked to Rick Pitino about replacing Lavin. This season, when U.C.L.A. struggled to a 6-12 record in the Pac-10 Conference, the team was often booed at home, a third of the seats at Pauley Pavilion were empty for home games and some of the people who did show up wore T-shirts encouraging Lavin to leave.\n\nGuerrero said he would consult with Wooden, 92, before naming a new coach.\n\n''I take the long view,'' Lavin said in a statement. ''I am grateful for the experience of teaching at one of the world's great universities. I remain optimistic about the bright future of the program.''"
