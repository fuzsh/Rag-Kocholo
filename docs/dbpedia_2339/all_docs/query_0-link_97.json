        "text": "In his post-game interview with CBS analyst Bill Raftery on Saturday afternoon at Rupp Arena, Gonzaga head coach Mark Few wasn’t focused on his team securing a Quad 1 victory. After his Zags scored 89-85 triumph over No. 17 Kentucky, Few was relieved and thrilled to at last win a close one.\n\n“This was an unbelievable college basketball game,” Few told Raftery. “It took everything we had to just hold them off and hang on. Man, I’m proud of our guys. We fought and played with great poise down the stretch.\n\n“We finally closed out a game. We’ve had about five of these where we just haven’t closed them out.”\n\nThat had to be a source of frustration for the Zags (18-6, 8-2), who led Purdue by five points at halftime and Washington by as many as 11 points in the second half, trailed San Diego State by just three points in the final seven minutes, led by four at Santa Clara with less than a minute left and was ahead of Saint Mary’s entering the final five minutes.\n\nGonzaga couldn’t get over the top in any of those five, but the Zags got it done at one of college basketball’s most glamorous venues in front of more than 20,000 fans, who watched in disbelief as their Wildcats lost for a third straight time at Rupp for the first time since the arena was opened for the 1976-77 season.\n\nThis was, in fact, Gonzaga’s first Quad 1 victory of the season — which is defined a win over top-30 team in the NET rankings at home, top-50 in the NET rankings on a neutral court and top-75 in the NET rankings on the opponent’s home court. With the win, the Zags inched up from No. 25 to 24 in Sunday morning’s updated NET computer rankings.\n\n“The only thing that matters is we’ve got so many games in front of us, a conference tournament in front of us,” Few said. “We just need to keep doing this. We need to take care of business. When we’re in position to win, we’ve got to step up and make plays like we did today.”\n\nFew would like to bottle everything he got from his guys Saturday afternoon. Senior forward Anton Watson had 17 points, seven rebounds, five assists and completed an old-fashioned three-point play with 3:49 left.\n\nGuard Nolan Hickman scored 17 points, including two free throws to ice things with one second left against the school to which he originally committed in 2020 before flipping to Gonzaga.\n\nForward Graham Ike scored 23 points, Braden Huff had 12 points off the bench and Ben Gregg also had 12 and intercepted a pass into the post with five seconds left.\n\n“This was a full team effort, everybody staying locked in,” said point guard Ryan Nembhard, who chipped in nine assists. “Knowing they’re a good team, they’re going to go on their offensive runs, and we just have to weather that as a group. It was just great connectivity from the whole group.”\n\n“A cool and great experience,” Hickman called it. “Great atmosphere, man. I mean, that’s what college hoops is about. . . . This is right up there with The Kennel, you know what I’m saying. It was amazing. I loved it.”\n\nLAST WEEK’S BIG THING: The 19th-ranked Gonzaga women (24-2, 11-0) beat Pepperdine and LMU to extend their win streak to 18 games (third-longest in the country) and their home win streak to 32 games (second-longest). What made it all the more impressive is the Zags won both games decisively despite being without the WCC’s best player, senior forward Yvonne Ejim (20.3 points, 8.3 rebounds, 65-percent field goal), who took a brief hiatus to play with the Canadian National Team in an Olympic qualifying tournament in Hungary.\n\nTHIS WEEK’S BIG THING: The Santa Clara women (19-7, 7-4), who have climbed into a tie for third place after winning four in a row, face two challenging matchups. The Broncos play Thursday at San Francisco (11-13, 7-4), winner in three of its past four games, then are home Saturday afternoon against second-place Portland (17-8, 9-2), which beat Santa Clara by 10 points a month ago. During the Broncos’ win over San Diego on Thursday, sophomore guard Tess Heal scored 29 points to reach 1,000 for her career in 57 games, fastest in program history.\n\nREACHING 20 VICTORIES: Saint Mary’s and USF each reached the 20-victory plateau on Saturday, the first WCC men’s teams to get there this season. But their paths to No. 20 were dramatically different.\n\nThe first-place Gaels (20-6, 11-0) earned No. 20 with a drama-free, 76-51, win at Portland on Saturday, their 17th victory in their past 18 games. Excluding the 2020-21 COVID year, where teams played shortened schedules, this is the 16th consecutive season the Gaels have hit the 20-win landmark.\n\nUSF (20-6, 9-2) rallied from a 10-point halftime hole at home in its 234th all-time meeting vs. Bay Area rival Santa Clara to claim a 71-70 victory which lifted the Dons into sole possession of second place.\n\nForward Jonathan Mogbo led the Dons with 16 points, seven rebounds and five steals. He scored eight points in the final 1:14, including the game-tying and winning free throws with 1 second left.\n\nThe Dons have now won at least 20 games for the seventh straight season (again, excluding the COVID year), with three different coaches at the helm. Kyle Smith got it done three times (2017-18-19), Todd Golden twice (2020 and ’22) and Chris Gerlufsen (2023-24) in each of his first two seasons. Until this current stretch, USF had achieved 20 wins just twice since 1982.\n\nTRAILING ONLY THE WIZARD: There are 25 Division I men’s basketball programs in the state of California — seven of them in the WCC — and Randy Bennett, in his 23rd season at Saint Mary’s, has the second-most coaching victories of anyone from that collection of schools.\n\nBennett’s career record now stands are 527 victories against 214 defeats. Bennett’s WCC friend and rival, Mark Few of Gonzaga, in his 25th season, has compiled a sparkling ledger of 707-141.\n\nThanks to a heads-up provided by former Gaels assistant coaches Eran Ganot and Dan Shell, we now know Bennett has moved ahead of retired Stanford and Cal coaching great Mike Montgomery (522-241) for the second-most DI coaching wins in California history.\n\nBennett trails just one coach in the nation’s largest state — the late UCLA coaching icon John Wooden, who was 620-147 from 1948-49 through 1974-75.\n\nOf course, even if Bennett someday surpasses that win total, the Wizard of Westwood will likely forever stand above all college coaches in one significant category, having assembled a record 10 NCAA championships in a span of 12 seasons.\n\nTOREROS ON A TEAR: The San Diego men, picked by the coaches to finish last in the WCC, opened Conference play with five straight defeats. But the Toreros (15-11, 5-6) have won three in a row and five of their past six games to climb into sole possession of fifth place.\n\nHead coach Steve Lavin’s squad, which went 11-20 overall and 4-12 in Conference play in his debut season a year ago, has now moved ahead of those win totals in both categories.\n\nJunior guard Wayne McKinney III scored 55 points in two games this past week, including a career-high 31 vs. Pacific on Saturday, and leads USD with a 14.9 scoring average. Fellow junior guard Deuce McKinney, the team’s super sixth man, scored 20 vs. the Tigers (his sixth game of 20-plus points) and is providing 14.5 per game.\n\nThe team’s breakout player is junior center Steven Jamerson II, who averaged just 2.7 points a year ago in his first season with the Toreros, and was scoring at the modest clip of 6.4 points through the team’s first 20 games.\n\nOver the past six, he has contributed mightily to the five victories by averaging 15.7 points (on remarkable 81-percent shooting from the field) and 10.7 rebounds, with five consecutive double-doubles. The 6-foot-10 native of Los Angeles scored a career-high 22 points Saturday against Pacific and has boosted his season marks to 9.3 points and 8.3 rebounds."
