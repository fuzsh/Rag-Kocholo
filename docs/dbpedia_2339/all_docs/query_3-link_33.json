Until that year, the Bruins had been just another fine team, but it all changed that season. In his 16th season as UCLA’s head coach, John Wooden assembled an experience team blessed with great quickness.

In the next 2:40, the Bruins outscored Duke, 16-0, to secure a 43-30 cushion. UCLA won the game, 98-83, starting its dynasty.

FRONT ROW: Dennis Minishian (Manager), Gail Goodrich, Jack Hirsch, Rich Levin, Walt Hazzard, Kent Graham, Mike Huggins and Chuck Darrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1965 (28-2 record)\n\nAlthough the Bruins lost to Illinois, 110-83, in the season opener, they defeated Michigan, 91-80, in the NCAA championship game to win their second straight national title. Head coach John Wooden had two returning starters from 1963-64 but had the right players to fit the championship puzzle. Utilizing the devastating zone press, the Bruins compiled a perfect conference record and captured the NCAA title with a 28-2 mark. The leader of UCLA’s championship unit was senior guard Gail Goodrich, who assumed the job of playmaker and scorer. The 6-foot guard led the Bruins by averaging 24.6 points per game (UCLA school record for guards). He finished his career as the Bruins’ all-time leading scorer. Also averaging double-figures included senior co-captain Keith Erickson (12.9), junior Fred Goss (12.2) and sophomore Edgar Lacey (11.6). Doug McIntosh took over as starting center, while Kenny Washington and Mike Lynn gave the Bruins superior bench strength. UCLA reached its peak form during the NCAA Tournament, averaging 100 points in four games. Playing his best in the big games, Goodrich set a school record by scoring 42 points in the title game as the Bruins downed Michigan, 91-80, to win the school’s second straight NCAA championship.\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Head Coach John Wooden, Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake, Rich Levin, Edgar Lacey, Doug McIntosh, Vaughn Hoffman, Bill Winkelholz, Mike Lynn, Keith Erickson, Kenny Washington and Bill Ureda. FRONT ROW: Assistant Coach Jerry Norman, Gail Goodrich, John Lyons, John Galbraith, Mike Serafin, Brice Chambers, Larry McCollister and Fred Goss.\n\n1967 (30-0 record)\n\nAfter failing to reach the NCAA Tournament in 1965-66, unable to defend their back-to-back titles in 1964 and 1965, the Bruins were ready to start a new streak during the 1966-67 season. With four new sophomore starters and a junior returning to the starting lineup, the Bruins knew they could accomplish something special. Sophomore Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) embarked on his varsity career and became the most dominating force in college basketball. Junior guard Mike Warren developed into among the smoothest playmaking guards in program history. Alcindor and Warren were joined in the starting lineup by sophomores Lucius Allen, Lynn Shackelford and Kenny Heitz. Head coach John Wooden turned in another fantastic job at the helm, molding the 1966-67 unit into one of the finest teams in school history. Warren and the four sophomores, along with reserves Bill Sweek and Jim Nielsen, banded together to win 30 straight games and capture the school’s third NCAA championship in four years. In his first varsity contest, Alcindor set a school record by registering 56 points, a record he later broke that season by tallying 61 against Washington State. The only thing that slowed the Bruins down was a delayed game, and the UCLA’s smallest margin of victory was five points. In NCAA playoff competition, the Bruins outscored four opponents by 95 points, defeating Houston in the semifinals and Dayton in the finals to claim the NCAA championship. Alcindor led the way by averaging 29.0 points and setting an NCAA record by hitting 66.7 percent of his field goal attempts. Allen and Warren averaged 15.5 and 12.7 points, respectively, while Shackelford logged 11.4 points per contest.\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Head Coach John Wooden, Assistant Coach Jerry Norman, Joe Chrisman, Lynn Shackelford, Neville Saner, Lew Alcindor, Jim Nielsen, Ken Heitz, Bill Sweek, Ted Henry (Manager) and Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake. FRONT ROW: Don Saffer, Lucius Allen, Dick Lynn, Gene Sutherland and Mike Warren.\n\nLew Alcindor, Mike Warren, Lucius Allen, Lynn Shackelford and Kenny Heitz were all a year older and more experienced in 1967-68. In addition, Mike Lynn and Edgar Lacey (starters from 1965-66) returned to the varsity squad, so many figured the Bruins would cruise through every game, but that was not the case. UCLA opened defense of its national title at Purdue, escaping with a 73-71 victory. The close win shocked the Bruins, who won their next 12 games (including 11 contests by 24 or more points) to extend their winning streak to 47. The winning streak ended at the Houston Astrodome, where a then-record 52,693 fans watched Houston upset UCLA, 71-69. Alcindor, who had an injured eye, did not play at full strength, and the Cougars exploited that weakness. The Bruins ended the regular season with a No. 2 national ranking (behind Houston). One Pac-8 foe came within eight points of the Bruins, who set a school record by averaging 93.4 points per game that season. In the NCAA Regionals, UCLA defeated New Mexico State and Santa Clara to advance to the semifinals against Houston. In the rematch at the L.A. Sports Arena, Alcindor, Allen and Lynn scored 19 points each against Hosuton. Playing a diamond-and-one defense against Elvin Hayes and the Cougars (Shackelford was the one), UCLA roared to a 53-31 halftime lead and a 101-69 triumph. The next day, the Bruins earned their fourth NCAA title in five seasons with a 78-55 win against North Carolina. Despite the elimination of the dunk shot, Alcindor led UCLA’s attack with a 26.2 scoring average, followed by Allen (15.1), Warren (12.1), Shackelford (10.7) and Lynn (10.3).\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Head Coach John Wooden, Assistant Coach Jerry Norman, Ken Heitz, Lynn Shackelford, Jim Nielsen, Lew Alcindor, Mike Lynn, Neville Saner, Bill Sweek, Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake and Frank Adler (Manager). FRONT ROW: Mike Warren, Gene Sutherland and Lucius Allen.\n\n1969 (29-1 record)\n\nThe Bruins entered the 1968-69 season without any experienced guards to get the ball to Lew Alcindor, Lynn Shackelford and forwards Curtis Rowe and Sidney Wicks. Head coach John Wooden solved the problem by filling one guard spot with junior college transfer John Vallely, who became known as the “Money Man” for his play in big games. The other backcourt spot was filled by Kenny Heitz. Although the scores were closer, the Bruins still won their first 23 games without much of a scare. But the next two, an overtime victory at California and a double overtime win at USC, were omens of things to come. The night after the double-overtime victory, USC upset the Bruins, 46-44, in Pauley Pavilion. That loss marked UCLA’s first in its relatively new home arena and just the second of the Alcindor Era. The Bruins advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the third straight year, defeating New Mexico State and Santa Clara (in Pauley Pavilion) to head back to the NCAA Final Four. UCLA extended its winning streak with an 85-82 victory over Drake in the NCAA semifinals. Vallely had 29 points and Alcindor registered 25 points. The following afternoon, the Bruins became the first team in NCAA history to win three straight titles, taking down Purdue, 92-72. Playing in his final collegiate game, Alcindor netted 37 points while UCLA’s defense (led by Heitz) held high-scoring Rick Mount in check. Alcindor averaged 24.0 ppg, followed by Rowe (12.9 ppg), Vallely (11.0 ppg), Wicks (7.5 ppg) and Heitz (7.0 ppg). In three seasons at UCLA, Alcindor led the Bruins to an 88-2 record while establishing the school’s career scoring and rebounding records.\n\n1970 (28-2 record)\n\nWith Lew Alcindor playing in the NBA, the rest of the college basketball world could breathe easier. UCLA returned John Vallely and Curtis Rowe from the 1969 NCAA championship team and most figured the Bruins would not be a factor in the championship picture. UCLA set out to prove those naysayers wrong. Junior Sidney Wicks, moving in at the vacated forward position, became UCLA’s top scorer (18.6 ppg) and rebounder (11.9 rpg). Wicks was joined on the front line by Rowe (15.3 ppg, 8.7 rpg) and center Steve Patterson (12.5 ppg, 10.0 rpg). Vallely provided senior leadership in the backcourt, averaging 16.3 points per game. Sophomore guard Henry Bibby, the team’s fifth starter, had one of the best seasons for any UCLA guard, averaging 15.6 points while shooting 50.1 percent from the field. UCLA averaged 92 points per game and established a school scoring record of 133 points against LSU, led by Pete Maravich. Although the Bruins lost two regular season games, they won their fourth consecutive Pac-8 title, serving notice that they would be ready to defend their three straight NCAA championships. The Bruins advanced to the NCAA title game against Jacksonville, led by 7-foot-2 center Artis Gilmore and guard Rex Morgan, a duo dubbed “Batman and Robin” by the media. Jacksonville opened a nine-point lead in the first half, but by halftime, the Bruins secured a five-point cushion and Wicks had blocked five of Gilmore’s shots. Rowe scored 19 points, Wicks and Patterson each finished with 17, and the Bruins won their fourth straight NCAA championship with an 80-69 victory.\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Lynn Shackelford, Curtis Rowe, Steve Patterson, Lew Alcindor, Sidney Wicks, John Ecker and Bill Seibert.

MIDDLE ROW: George Morgan (manager), Assistant Coach Gary Cunningham, Head Coach John Wooden, Assistant Coach Deny Crum and Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake. BOTTOM ROW: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield and Andy Hill.\n\nCoach Wooden and the Bruins returned their frontcourt of seniors Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe and Steve Patterson. Their contributions became more important throughout the season, because UCLA did not generate the quality guard play they had received in previous championship seasons. Wicks returned as the Bruins’ leading scorer (21.3 ppg) and rebounder (12.7 rpg). When the Bruins were in trouble, they went to Wicks, and he usually found a way to pull them through. In a contest against Oregon State, Wicks dribbled the clock to its final seconds before hitting a jump shot for a two-point victory. Rowe (17.5 ppg) and Patterson (12.9 ppg) collected over 290 rebounds each. The often overlooked Patterson saved his best for last, scoring 29 points in UCLA’s 68-62 win over Villanova in the NCAA championship contest. Taking over the backcourt playmaking chores of John Vallely, Henry Bibby averaged 11.8 points, scoring 17 in the title game. Senior Kenny Booker (5.5 ppg) started opposite Bibby and senior Terry Schofield (6.2 ppg) proved to be a valuable sixth man. UCLA lost just one game all season, an 89-82 decision at Notre Dame. That game was the Bruins’ last loss for three years, there were a number of other close calls. The Bruins trailed USC by nine points with nine minutes remaining at the L.A. Sports Arena, before rallying for a 64-60 win. In the NCAA West Regionals, the Bruins rallied from an 11-point deficit to defeat Cal State Long Beach, 57-55, and earn another trip to the NCAA Final Four. In all, the Bruins won seven games by five points or fewer en route to a 29-1 record and their fifth consecutive NCAA championship.\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Larry Hollyfield, Larry Farmer, John Ecker, Curtis Rowe, Steve Patterson, Sidney Wicks, Jon Chapman, Kenny Booker, Rich Betchley and Terry Schofield. MIDDLE ROW: George Morgan (manager), Assistant Coach Denny Crum, Head Coach John Wooden, Assistant Coach Gary Cunningham and Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake. BOTTOM ROW: Andy Hill and Henry Bibby.\n\n1972 (30-0 record)\n\nSenior guard Henry Bibby was the only returning starter and junior Larry Farmer, a top reserve the previous season, took over one of the vacated forward positions and averaged 10.7 points and 5.5 rebounds in 1971-72. The big story for the five-time defending NCAA champions was the team’s three sophomores, led by 6-foot-11 center Bill Walton. On his way to establishing himself as one of the game’s premier players, Walton led UCLA in scoring (21.1 ppg) and tied Lew Alcindor’s school record by collecting 466 rebounds. UCLA’s two other key sophomores included Keith Wilkes (now Jamaal Wilkes) and Greg Lee. Wilkes averaged 13.5 points, second only to Walton and Bibby (15.7). Wilkes averaged over eight rebounds per game. Lee assumed UCLA’s point guard duties, averaging 8.7 points per game while running the team’s fast break. The starters also received help from Larry Hollyfield (7.3 ppg) and Tommy Curtis (4.1 ppg). Swen Nater, an eventual first-round NBA draft pick, was a key contributor from the bench (6.7 ppg). UCLA opened the year by scoring at least 100 points in seven straight games. Prior to the NCAA championship contest against Florida State, only one team had closed to within six points of the Bruins. Walton scored 24 points and Wilkes added 23 as the Bruins downed Florida State, 81-76, claiming their sixth consecutive NCAA title. UCLA became the first school to compile three perfect 30-0 seasons. The Bruins also established an NCAA record (which still stands) by outscoring opponents by at least 30.3 points per game.\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Tommy Curtis, Greg Lee, Larry Hollyfield, Jon Chapman, Keith Wilkes, Bill Walton, Swen Nater, Vince Carson, Larry Farmer, Gary Franklin, Andy Hill and Henry Bibby. MIDDLE ROW: Head Coach John Wooden, Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake and Assistant Coach Gary Cunningham. BOTTOM ROW: Les Friedman (manager).\n\nBACK ROW (L to R): Larry Farmer, Keith Wilkes, Dave Meyers, Bill Walton, Ralph Drollinger, Swen Nater, Vince Carson and Pete Trgovich. MIDDLE ROW: Larry Hollyfield, Les Friedman (manager), Head Coach John Wooden, Assistant Coach Gary Cunningham, Athletic Trainer Ducky Drake and Greg Lee. BOTTOM ROW: Bob Webb, Tommy Curtis, Gary Franklin and Casey Corliss.\n\n1973 (30-0 record)\n\nUCLA returned the bulk of its team from the previous season, as senior Larry Hollyfield (10.7 ppg) did a fine job filling in for the departed Henry Bibby. The rest of the cast remained the same with Bill Walton (20.4 ppg) at center. Keith Wilkes (14.8) and Larry Farmer (12.2) at forward and Greg Lee (4.6) at guard. Tommy Curtis (6.4), Dave Meyers (4.9), Swen Nater (3.2) and Pete Trgovich (3.1) gave the Bruins an outstanding reserve contingent. Together, these nine players set numerous records. UCLA registered its 60th consecutive victory on Jan. 25, 1973, posting an 87-73 victory over Loyola University (Chicago), tying San Francisco’s previous NCAA record. Two days later, UCLA established a new record with a win over Notre Dame, 82-63, on the Fighting Irish home court. By the end of the season, the streak had reached 75 straight wins. The Bruins suffered very few close calls during the regular season, winning every game by at least six points and 23 of the 26 contests by 10 points or more. In the NCAA West Regional finals, the Bruins faced a determined San Francisco team trailed UCLA at halftime, 23-22. UCLA outscored the Dons in the second half, 31-17, to secure a 54-39 win. In the NCAA semifinals, Indiana gave the Bruins a scare with a furious second-half rally. But Curtis came off the bench to score 22 points, and the Bruins reached the title game with a 70-59 victory. Walton finished the year with a school-record 506 rebounds. In the title contest, he established an NCAA record by making 21 of 22 shots, scoring 44 points as the Bruins defeated Memphis State, 87-66. UCLA won its seventh straight NCAA title and became the only school to compile consecutive undefeated seasons.\n\nSenior David Meyers was the lone returning starter from the 1973-74 team that finished third, nationally. He assumed UCLA’s leadership role and became well-known for his agreessive play and hustle. Sophomores Richard Washington (15.9 ppg) and Marques Johnson (11.6) joined Meyers (18.3) on the front line and were supported by junior Ralph Drollinger (8.8) at center. Coach Wooden’s 1974-75 team had little experience in the backcourt. Pete Trgovich (10.2), who had started early in the previous year, moved in at one guard spot while junior Andre McCarter (7.0) assumed the playmaking role, leading the team with 156 assists. The Bruins opened the season by winning their first 12 games before being upset at Stanford. Along the way, UCLA lost two more games and had numerous other close contests, at the end of the regular season the Bruins captured another Pac-8 title and looked to reclaim the NCAA championship. UCLA won its first playoff game in overtime, securing a 103-91 decision against Michigan, before knocking off Montana, 67-64. The Bruins won the West Regional title behind Johnson’s 35-point effort in an 89-75 win against Arizona State. In the NCAA Final Four, UCLA defeated Louisville in overtime, 75-74, as Washington led the Bruins’ charge by scoring 26 points. Following that game, Wooden announced that he would retire upon the conclusion of the NCAA championship contest. UCLA used just six players in a 92-85 win over Kentucky in the NCAA title game, helping Wooden secure his 10th NCAA title at the helm of the Bruins’ program. Washington finished with 28 points, Meyers added 24 and Drollinger came off the bench to grab 13 rebounds. Wooden’s final career win accounted for UCLA’s 10th NCAA championship in 12 years, a record that has yet to be matched.\n\n1995 (32-1 record)\n\nUCLA won the NCAA title in 1994-95, earning its first NCAA championship in 20 years and making its first NCAA Final Four appearance in 15 seasons. Behind the senior trio of Ed O’Bannon (20.4 ppg), Tyus Edney (14.3 ppg) and George Zidek (10.6 ppg) and led by head coach Jim Harrick, the Bruins defeated defending NCAA champion Arkansas, 89-78, to win the program’s 11th national title. O’Bannon scored a team-leading 30 points and collected a team-best 17 rebounds in the win over Arkansas, earning Most Outstanding Player honors at the Final Four. Edney was named the Most Outstanding Player in the West Regional, and his last-second full-court dash against Missouri in the Bruins’ 75-74, second-round win propelled the Bruins to the “Sweet 16.” Edney played just three minutes against Arkansas in the title contest after suffering a sprained right wrist in the team’s 74-61 win over Oklahoma State in the NCAA semifinals. Sophomore Cameron Dollar filled in admirably for the injured Edney versus Arkansas, contributing six points and eight assists. A season-long stalwart for UCLA, the 7-foot tall Zidek saved his best performances for the Final Four. He contained OSU’s Bryant Reeves in the semifinal win and held Corliss Williamson (1994 Final Four Most Outstanding Player) in check against Arkansas. Zidek (10.6 ppg, 5.4 rpg) earned first-team GTE Academic All-America honors. Dollar, sophomore Charles O’Bannon (13.6 ppg) and freshmen Toby Bailey (10.5) and J.R. Henderson (9.2) were instrumental in UCLA’s championship season. Charles O’Bannon started all 33 games, Dollar played in every contest. Bailey erupted for a career-high 26 points in the West Regional final against Connecticut, earning All-Tournament Team acclaim at the Final Four and West Regional. Henderson was consistent all season, earning Pac-10 All-Freshman first team accolades. Harrick earned Naismith and NABC National Coach of the Year honors, in addition to capturing Pac-10 Coach of the Year acclaim. He was assisted that season by Mark Gottfried, Lorenzo Romar, Steve Lavin and David Boyle.\n\nNIT Champions 1985 (21-12 record)\n\nFirst-year head coach Walt Hazzard helped lead the 1984-85 UCLA team to its only championship in the National Invitational Tournament (NIT) after the Bruins managed just three wins in their first nine games. UCLA’s 67-59 double-overtime win over Oregon (Jan. 5) helped jump start the Bruins’ season. Over a seven-game stretch that month, UCLA moved into first place in the Pac-10 standings with a 6-2 conference mark. After losing four consecutive games in February, the Bruins closed the regular season with six wins in their final seven games. The Bruins opened the NIT with wins over Montana (74-48) and Nebraska (82-63), before cruising past Fresno State, 53-43, to advance to the semifinal round. Brad Wright scored a career-high 23 points in a 75-66 win over Louisville. Tournament MVP Reggie Miller and AllTournament guard Nigel Miguel scored 18 points each, leading UCLA to a 65-62 victory over Indiana in the NIT championship contest."
