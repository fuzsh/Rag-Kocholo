        "text": "With all the rumors floating around, I'll wait til its official but I don't have a problem with Lavin. Who'd you expect Lee to go after now that RB and Cal turned us down? From what I've read he had a down year at UCLA...after his team had won 10 they basically quit on him. Not a good sign but we don't know the circumstances, however I do know they tried to hire Pitino after his failed NBA stint while Lavin was still coach...seems like a boneheaded move by the AD.\n\nAnyway, came across this old bio:\n\nSteve Lavin is one of just two coaches in the nation, joining Dukes Mike Krzyzewski, to have led his team to five NCAA Sweet 16s in the last six years (2002-01-00-98-97). In Lavins six seasons as the UCLA head coach, he is 10-1 during the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament, including an unbeaten 5-0 record in second round games. Since John Woodens retirement 27 years ago as UCLAs head coach, Lavin is the first Bruin head mentor to lead UCLA to three consecutive NCAA \"Sweet 16\" appearances (2002-01-00).\n\nIn 2002, he directed UCLA to its 14th consecutive NCAA Tournament bid, including the sixth straight under his reign, and 14th straight 20+ win season. In 2001, he earned Pacific-10 Coach of the Year honors and led UCLA to the NCAA \"Sweet 16\" for the fourth time in five years. During his first six campaigns (including 2001-02), UCLA averaged nearly 23 wins a year and advanced to the NCAA \"Elite Eight\" (1997), four times to the NCAA \"Sweet 16\" (2002-01-00-98), won a Pacific-10 title (1997) and assembled the nations No. 1 (2001, 1998) and No. 2 (1997) recruiting classes. Under Lavin, the Bruins have six consecutive NCAA Tournament bids and six straight 20+ game winning seasons. On March 30, 1999, he received a new six-year contract, which also included a rollover clause.\n\nIn 2002, the Bruins reached the NCAA \"Sweet 16\" with a 21-11 overall mark and a 7-4 record vs. teams ranked in the Top 25 at game time, including wins over No. 1 Kansas (87-77, Jan. 12 in Pauley Pavilion), No. 5 Cincinnati (105-101 in double overtime in the NCAA Second Round at Pittsburgh, PA), No. 9 Arizona (77-76, Feb. 14 in Pauley Pavilion) and No. 10 Stanford (95-92, Feb. 23 at Palo Alto, beating the Cardinal on their home floor for the third straight season). The Bruins also had wins over Alabama at the Wooden Classic in Anaheim (79-57, Dec. 8, No. 16 at game time, No. 8 entering the NCAA Tournament), Georgetown (98-91, Dec. 29 in Pauley Pavilion, No. 20 at game time) and USC (67-65, Feb. 6 in Pauley Pavilion, No. 25 at game time). During one stretch (Dec. 5-Jan. 6), UCLA had a nine-game winning streak, its longest since the 1997-98 season.\n\nIn 2001, Lavin led the Bruins to an overall record of 23-9 (71.9), including an eight-game winning streak from Jan. 25 through March 1, and a record of 19-5 in their last 24 games. UCLA compiled a record of 14-4 (77.8) in Pac-10 play, finished third (just two games out of first-place) and Lavin was named the conference Coach of the Year. UCLA defeated No. 1 Stanford (79-73, Feb. 3 in Palo Alto) on its home floor for the second straight season (it is believed Lavin is only the second coach in collegiate history to record consecutive wins on a No. 1 ranked teams home floor  USCs Bob Boyd won at No. 1 UCLA in 1969 and 70). Under Lavins guidance, the Bruins also beat Arizona 79-77 (OT) on Feb. 15 in Pauley Pavilion (the Wildcats next loss would be 12 games later, losing to Duke in the 2001 NCAA Championship game) and defeated Kentucky early in the season (97-92 OT), Coaches vs. Cancer, Nov. 10, Madison Square Garden).\n\nIn 2000, the Bruins played in the NCAA \"Sweet 16\" for the third time in four seasons and entered the Midwest Region semi-final game with an eight-game winning streak.\n\nENTERING SEVENTH SEASON AS BRUIN HEAD COACH\n\nIn his six seasons as UCLAs head coach, Lavin, 38, owns an overall record of 135-59 (69.6, 194 games) and a Pac-10 mark of 74-34 (68.5, 108 games).\n\nDucker\n\nSmitty say what you want but it would still be a breath of fresh air into a program that definitely needed it. Maybe Lee learned from his mistakes and if BY chance the new coach doesn't work out we don't keep him 10 years.\n\nAnyway, another good read:\n\nFriday, April 21, 2006\n\nJeff Gravely: Lavin Hire Would Attract Interest\n\nThe Sporting News reported Friday night that former UCLA coach Steve Lavin has been offered the job of head basketball coach at NC State. I left a message with Wolfpack AD Lee Fowler but haven't heard back. I do know that Lavin has been gathering information on players on the current Wolfpack roster and is excited about the possibility of coaching at NC State. Will that lead to an agreement, I don't know. (see Rick Barnes and John Calipari)\n\nWould Lavin be a good hire for NC State? That's a TBA, but I do know it would bring a lot of attention to the basketball program. His press conference would get national play and you can bet a big plate of barbecue that next season, ESPN would be in Raleigh for an \"inside look\" at Steve Lavin's return to coaching. You can't buy that kind of exposure.\n\nAlso, high school players know who Steve Lavin is...maybe not as a former coach at UCLA but they know him as a basketball guy on ESPN. That might open a door or two on the recruiting trail. Being a college basketball analyst, Lavin has been exposed to practices all across the country. Coaches pick up on things from one another if they are given access.\n\nHere's how Lavin built a 145-78 record in 7 seasons at UCLA.\n\n1996-97: 24-8\n\n1997-98: 24-9\n\n1998-99: 22-9\n\n1999-2000: 21-12\n\n2000-2001: 23-9\n\n2001-2002: 21-12\n\n2002-2003: 10-19\n\nLavin made 5 trips to the Sweet 16 in seven years, and if you can coach amid the expectations at UCLA, you can coach at one of the points in the Triangle. Would he be a good hire? That's for a later date, but at this point, Steve Lavin would bring a lot of attention to NC State. Winning would keep it there.\n\nLavin would probably be an upgrade from Herb, but he's not the \"big name\" that the NCSU faithful were clamoring for when they ushered Herb out the door.\n\nLavin had at least 3 McDonald's AA on every team he coached at UCLA. Other than his first year coaching players that he did not recruit (NCSU fans knock ol' Roy about winning a national championship with Doh's players...), Lavin could not finish higher in the PAC-10 (Pac-10!!!) than 3rd. If Lavin couldn't win big out there with the recruits that he was able to bring in, I don't see him taking NCSU any higher than 3rd in the ACC even during his best years. NCSU fans always have been talking about bringing in a \"name\" coach at return them to whatever glory they feel that they once enjoyed, but then they go and hire a coach who was at a school with exponentially greater tradition and who was unable to win consistently out there.\n\nNCSU can be a better basketball program than they are currently, and more than likely Lavin will be an upgrade from Herb. Lavin, however, is not the right guy to take State back to the upper echelons of the ACC and NCAA. If he is in fact hired, I give him five years at NCSU.\n\nTarHeelWtrFwlr said:\n\nLavin would probably be an upgrade from Herb, but he's not the \"big name\" that the NCSU faithful were clamoring for when they ushered Herb out the door.\n\nLavin had at least 3 McDonald's AA on every team he coached at UCLA.

If he is in fact hired, I give him five years at NCSU.\n\nI really don't know enough about him to make a determination as of yet, however from what I've read I've seen some things that lead to his demise at UCLA. For instance, HS buddies and old friends as a coaching staff, however the amount of money he had to work with for a staff was downright embarrassing. He also made some poor decisions concerning the recruiting trail. Is he the big name everyone wanted? Probably not. But the main point is what viable options are left on the table? I don't really want Beilen (sp?) with another variety of the princeton O and no personality to boot. Would love to have Wright but I don't see that happening with his strong ties to Philly. Outside of those you're looking at mid-major coaches which could lead you to the top or take you straight to the bottom. Hopefully Lavin will have learned from his mistakes. I do like the fact that he has had exposure with espn to help on the recruiting trail. Oh well, time will tell.\n\nDucker"
