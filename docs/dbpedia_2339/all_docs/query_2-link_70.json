My background living on the west coast, the rich history of WCC basketball, and the strong academic reputation of USD all made this an ideal fit from the beginning. I look forward to building relationships with the entire Toreros family as our program aspires towards excellence on and off the court.\"\n\nLavin, 57, has coached in eight NCAA Tournaments, leading UCLA to five Sweet 16s and an Elite 8.\n\nHe last coached at St. John’s during the 2014-15 season, and finished 81-53 in five seasons at the Big East school with two NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\nBefore that Lavin led UCLA for seven season to a 145-78 mark with five Sweet 16s and one Elite 8.\n\nLavin replaces Sam Scholl who was fired last month after going 50-66 in five seasons\n\n\"I'm thrilled to welcome Coach Lavin to the University of San Diego and can't wait for this exciting new era of Torero basketball to begin,\" said McGillis. \"Coach Lavin's demonstrated record of success, including having led teams to eight NCAA Tournament appearances in 11 full seasons as a head coach, his positive inspirational leadership, and his deep west coast roots provide a foundation to catapult our program to new heights. While I know the powerful impact he will make on our campus and in our community, I am especially pleased for the young men in our program. The experience, expertise, passion and ability to connect that Coach Lavin will bring to USD will serve them for a lifetime.\""
