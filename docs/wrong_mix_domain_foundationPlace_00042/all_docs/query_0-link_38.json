        "text": "Listen to this article\n\nConstruction is underway on a build-to-rent luxury townhome community on 5.5 acres in Nowell Creek Village.\n\nHolder Properties announces a partnership with East West Partners and SilverCap Partners to develop a purpose-built rental townhome community on 5.5 acres in Nowell Creek Village. The marsh-front community will feature premier amenities and three and four-bedroom units with attached garages.\n\nHolder Properties said in a news release that it has partnered with East West Partners to develop the project. SilverCap Partners provided majority equity for the project, with construction financing provided by Georgia Banking Co. Patterson Real Estate Advisory Group led the capital raise and debt placement process, the release stated.\n\nThe project is the latest phase of Holder’s broader development plans at Nowell Creek Village on Daniel Island. Holder Properties purchased the 36-acre site between Nowell Creek and Beresford Creek in 2019 and set out to create a mixed-use community surrounded by the natural environment.\n\nThe waterfront community is currently home to Marshside, a Class A office building owned and managed by Holder, as well as a 320-unit multifamily project under construction by Middle Street Partners. Boutique retail, as well as a community park and dock, are in the planning and permitting phases, the release stated.\n\n“We’ve owned this land for nearly five years and have been intentional about its purpose and our partners,” Will Menkes, president of Holder Properties, said in the release. “Limited residential inventory, coupled with high demand to live on Daniel Island, has created a strong need for purposefully built rental homes that provide access to the island’s great schools and amenities. The ability to move this project forward in today’s challenging macroeconomic environment speaks volumes about the merits of this project and the team assembled to bring it to life.”\n\nEast West Partners is a luxury developer “devoted to supporting high-quality real estate and lifestyle experiences.” On Daniel Island, they also developed The Waterfront, a luxury 22-acre community featuring residences, retail and community amenities.\n\n“This new townhome community within Nowell Creek Village represents an incredible opportunity for East West Partners to expand our portfolio into the build-to-rent market and continue addressing the demand for luxury residences on Daniel Island,” East West Partners Managing Partner Miller Harper said in the release. “With interest in the lifestyle that Daniel Island affords at an all-time high, we are excited to bring to market a project that aligns with our values of offering high-quality real estate with a focus on community.”\n\nThe first units are expected to be ready in spring 2025, the release said.\n\nDANIEL ISLAND, S.C. (WCSC) - Berkeley County Council allocated $100,000 to Daniel Island School and it’s all thanks to a group of students advocating for their classmates.\n\nWhen eighth-grader Emily Hughes was elected as student council president, she knew she wanted to make a difference at her school. She said in years past, student council members were not able to turn their ideas into a reality, but she wanted to change that.\n\n“This year I think we can actually get something and get it done,” Hughes said.\n\nWith the help of sixth-grade vice president Keegan McGivern and fifth-grade members Sara Whitley and Olive Abney, they were able to do just that. The student council got together and jotted down ideas that they wanted to implicate. Hughes said that Abney noticed a classmate who was unable to use the playground equipment at recess due to a physical disability, so he spent his recess reading inside. Hughes said it saddened her that recess was not something he enjoyed in the same way she was able to.\n\n“It was upsetting because we could all use it. I loved playgrounds, like my whole life. And whenever other students can’t enjoy it the same way, we just want them to be included too,” she said.\n\nTogether, the student council decided that they wanted to create an inclusive playground. They knew this would be an expensive endeavor, so they first teamed up with their school’s Beta Club members to host a Valentine’s Day-themed fundraiser. Through that, they were able to raise $588, but these students were ambitious. They wanted to take it a step further.\n\nThe students got together again to propose a letter to Berkeley County Council. Less than a week after the letter was submitted, the council invited the students to speak at Monday’s council meeting.\n\n“It all happened really fast,” Hughes said.\n\nHughes took to the podium to share their ideas with the council members. She told them how they didn’t want any students to be left out at recess anymore. District 2 Councilman and Finance Committee Chair Josh Whitley made a motion to allocate $100,000 to the school to get this new, accessible equipment. The motion passed unanimously, and the students received high praise from Berkeley County Supervisor Johnny Cribb for their efforts.\n\n“We were all so amazed and excited. It was really exciting and fun,” Hughes said with a grin on her face.\n\nThe students’ principals and staff could not have been prouder. The actions of these students hit home for Assistant Principal Jay Burnsworth.\n\n“The biggest thing for me is, and it makes me really emotional in a lot of ways, is that my own son has special needs. And at the end of the day, these kids are doing it for everyone, for the community - not just Daniel Island School, but everyone,” Burnsworth said. “As a father, as an administrator, friend, dad, everybody, I’m just really proud of these kids.”\n\nOnce the playground is open, it will be open to the entire community, not just the students of the school.\n\nBurnsworth was not the only one beaming with pride for these four kids. Principal Laura Blanchard shared her praises.\n\n“We just thought it was great that our students recognized that need and wanted all of their friends to be able to play alongside them to the point that they would take action in the way that they did,” she said.\n\nBlanchard and Burnsworth think that the playground will be an incredible physical reminder to the children, for many years to come, that they were able to make a difference.\n\n“It’s really neat to see them empowered in that way. And it’s such a good and positive way,” Blanchard said.\n\nShe shared that this was a wonderful learning experience for these kids.\n\n“They learned from the adults in their community that they have a voice. And that we are going to come alongside them and help put feet to their dreams,” Blanchard said.\n\nBlanchard and Burnsworth said that they are already working on initiating the process. They emphasized that they want the students to be fully involved every step of the way. While they are working on the design process, they plan to take the students to different accessible playgrounds in the area so that they can get some ideas. Blanchard said that this is the children’s space, and she wants it to be representative of them, so they should be the ones to decide what is needed.\n\nHughes expressed some ideas she already had. She said that she would love to have rubber flooring to make wheelchair access easier. She would also love to have wheelchair-accessible swings put in. They also plan to add a sensory garden to the community garden that already exists.\n\nHughes said she is excited about the next steps.\n\n“We all thought there was space to grow in this area,” she said. “This is something important that needs to happen. So, it was worth it.”\n\nCopyright 2024 WCSC.

The closure leaves only the two I-526 ramps as options for access to the island by auto. The new bridge will feature two travel lanes along with a multi-use path on one side.\n\nThe project’s aim is to lessen traffic and provide a safer crossing for commuters.\n\nAccording to the city’s January project update, significant milestones have been achieved since the last update in November.\n\nThose milestones include the completion of all piles, the formation and setting of the rebar cage pile cap known as EB4, and the ongoing process of laying decking for Spans A and B.\n\n“It was thought that a valve would need to be installed prior to driving the final piling for End Bent EB4,” Williams said. “However, the contractor was able to drive the pile without installing the valve and it all got worked out.”\n\nStay up to date with the bridge replacement project via the city of Charleston’s website at charleston-sc.gov/2637/Beresford-Creek-Bridge-Replacement."
