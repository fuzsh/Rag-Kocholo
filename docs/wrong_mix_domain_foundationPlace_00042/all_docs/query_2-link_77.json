        "text": "Advancing transformative capabilities for lunar surface exploration across NASA’s Space Technology portfolio\n\nThroughout this decade, NASA and its partners will send trailblazing technologies, cutting-edge robotics, and a new generation of crew to the surface of the Moon, ushering in a modern era of exploration through a series of increasingly complex missions.\n\nThrough the Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative (LSII), NASA is developing foundational technologies and approaches needed to fulfill Artemis missions at the Moon in preparation for expeditions farther in deep space.\n\nBy working in partnership with other government agencies in the U.S. and abroad, academia, the private sector, and with non-profit institutions, the agency can expand science-driven technology and maintenance activities designed initially for the lunar surface that will allow us to GO, LAND, LIVE, and EXPLORE more of the solar system in profound new ways.\n\nNASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate makes these bold new missions possible.\n\nLSII activities are a critical asset to NASA, spurring innovation and providing risk reduction for lunar surface system development. It was established to bring together some of the world’s greatest experts in the aerospace technology field to cultivate new ideas, drive solutions, and enhance cohesive development of capabilities for productive exploration of the extreme lunar environment.\n\nBy collaborating across the public and private sector, NASA and our partners are able to maximize efforts and leverage resources to design and test new approaches, technologies, and systems in parallel which strengthens our ability to achieve successful long-duration missions. Holistically, these partnerships and collaborations are inclusive of many and play a vital role in increasing access to space while providing immeasurable economic benefit to our global community at home on Earth while providing pathways of discovery and gateways to innovation for future generations.\n\nMoon to Mars\n\nLooking toward the future as NASA embarks on revolutionary exploration in our solar system, the Lunar Surface Innovative Initiative bridges technological capabilities needed for sustained human exploration missions on the Moon that can evolve to help us understand and explore other challenging environments in deep space including Mars. From a technology development perspective, the Moon is an ideal proving ground for complex missions on the Red Planet that also supports the needs of lunar science missions of today and those planned for the near future. As we work to enhance our understanding of the challenging lunar environment, new knowledge and opportunities from these pursuits return technology advancements that inform our plans for the exploration of Mars and other planets and celestial bodies, while transferring technology applications that can improve everyday life on our home planet.\n\nLearn more about lunar activities led by NASA’s Exploration Systems Development and Science Mission Directorates.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLunar Surface Innovation Consortium\n\nNASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate established the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium (LSIC) in 2020 to bring together government, academia, non-profit institutions, and the private sector to identify technological capabilities and hurdles that must be retired to achieve a sustained presence on the surface of the Moon, both human and robotic.\n\nLSIC centers its work on NASA’s Lunar Surface Innovation Initiative’s (LSII) key capability areas including surface power, in-situ resource utilization, excavation and construction, dust mitigation, extreme environments, and extreme access.\n\nThe Consortium provides a forum for NASA to communicate technological requirements, needs, and opportunities; and for the community to share with NASA existing capabilities and critical gaps. The LSIC aims to:\n\nIdentify lunar surface technology needs and assessments of relative system and component readiness\n\nMake recommendations for strategic development and deployment of the technologies required for successful lunar surface exploration\n\nProvide a central resource for gathering information, analytical integration of lunar surface technology demonstration interfaces, and sharing of results\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) manages the LSIC in collaboration with NASA and hosts a variety of annual workshops and meetings that are open to in-person and virtual attendees with varying levels of interest—from active members of the aerospace community to small businesses looking to enter the market to collegiate and university students emerging in the field.\n\nLSIC currently has ~3,000 participants, from nearly 1,000 organizations across 50 states, the District of Columbia (D.C.), Guam, Puerto Rico, and ~65 countries.\n\nAll are welcome to join the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium, whether that is through your company, organization, academic institution, or as an interested individual. This approach of inclusiveness creates opportunities and draws innovation crosscutting many sectors to cultivate diversity of thought to propel shared objectives.\n\nLearn more about community activities and LSIC resources.\n\nLSII projects span NASA’s Space Tech portfolio"
