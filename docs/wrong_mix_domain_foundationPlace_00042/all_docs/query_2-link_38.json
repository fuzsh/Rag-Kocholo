        "text": "At the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology we adhere to a few core values: students are encouraged to continually challenge themselves; all members of our community work collaboratively to model a growth mindset and to be accountable for fostering genuine respect, confidence, and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge; we are lifelong learners who build communities and encourage each other to be our personal best; our work is to prepare students to be curious, independent learners and critical thinkers who question and investigate so that they are equipped to address both local and global challenges; and to always be kind, be kind, be kind.\n\nThese principles guide us to work together to create a school that will help our diverse community grow into adults who care about their world. The HSTAT magic lies in our regular reflection and commitment to adjusting what we do to meet the needs of our young people by searching for new ways to become a better school. Our commitment to equity, and a culture of self-reflection has led us to strengthen and further develop our programs, curriculum, and systems for support. Our 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade Small Learning Communities (Initiatives) promote academic and social growth through global-minded coursework and high expectations. Early community building programs for our incoming 9th grade ensure that each of our students starts high school surefooted. Through the work of extraordinary staff and peer-to-peer support, we differentiate for our diverse population by meeting our students’ individual needs and focusing on college and career access for all. We support students on the road to college and beyond by addressing the needs of the whole child: an unbeatable teaching, guidance, and administrative team; dedicated support staff; committed families; three College Advisors; staff assigned to grade-level Academic Advisement; exciting academic programs; an array of extracurricular activities; senior mentors; and a community-minded ethic ensure that our many initiatives thrive. At HSTAT, we all do our part to enrich our students’ lives by prioritizing student voice, student choice, and student collaboration..\n\nOur school began its life as the Bay Ridge High School for Girls in 1915. In 1985, after 70 years as the preeminent high school for young women in Brooklyn, we became a coeducational school and our name changed to the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology. We are proud of our long history– our history, institutional knowledge, and steady foundation give us the freedom and flexibility to be creative and to build.. In this spirit, we continue to grow and change so our students will always have options, and the knowledge and confidence to make good choices."
