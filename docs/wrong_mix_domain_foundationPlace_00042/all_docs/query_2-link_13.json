        "text": "The Supporting Act Foundation is a self-governing non-profit organization established by WeTransfer in 2021 to foster diversity in the arts and create better opportunities for marginalized groups. We help emerging artists and artist-led organizations fulfill their potential, develop their practices and projects, and drive positive change in their communities and in society.\n\nOur grant programs were launched in 2022, following in-depth research with Barcelona-based creative lab IAM. These programs seek to address the challenges that face those under-represented in the arts, from lack of resources to lack of opportunities, nurturing new voices and perspectives to transform the sector, and society, for the better. Throughout our activities, we cultivate a trust-based approach, giving artists and organizations the space they need to pursue their goals.\n\nToday, The Supporting Act Foundation has completed two open calls, awarding grants to a diverse range of artists and artist-led organizations, who are already making real impacts around social, intersectional, and environmental justice. Head to the Grantees page to meet them, or to the Approach page to find out more about how we work, and why.\n\nIf you’d like to help us in delivering diversity, equity, and inclusion in the arts—and meaningful change in society—we’d love to hear from you."
