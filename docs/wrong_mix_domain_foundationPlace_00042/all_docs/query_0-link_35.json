        "text": "The CARES Act’s provision to send $1,200 to people marks a notable shift in political willingness to give people money – and it refuted long-held skepticism about whether low-income people know what’s best in how to spend their money. Does the CARES Act reflect only the extreme needs of the moment? Or are we entering a new era of increased agreement about the importance of money as a foundational support?\n\nUnder either circumstance, the government is now learning something non-profits have known for years—delivering money isn’t easy. The Aspen Institute Financial Security Program has been studying cash infusions in partnership with direct service providers, summarized in a forthcoming series of briefs around the evidence for, innovations in, and effects of cash infusions on family financial well-being. Join us for a digital conversation that will highlight the various ways policymakers, funders, nonprofits, and business leaders are proposing getting more money into the hands of people and why they believe that approach is essential to the financial security of families– both now and beyond this crisis.\n\nAttendees of the digital event will:\n\nReceive a written overview of cash transfer programs in the U.S. and around the world\n\nUnderstand the financial realities that people across the income spectrum face and why cash transfers are an effective tool to solve some of these challenges\n\nHear the design considerations which policymakers, funders, and business leaders should know as they design cash-transfer programs for their residents and employees\n\nThe Aspen Institute Financial Security Program’s research on cash infusions is made possible with support from the Mastercard Impact Fund, MetLife Foundation, The Prudential Foundation, and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.\n\nFeatured Speakers\n\nCharlie Anderson @EconCharlie\n\nSenior Advisor for Tax and Economic Policy to Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO)\n\nCharlie Anderson has been Senior Advisor for Tax and Economic Policy to Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado since March 2017, developing policies to reduce child poverty; expand economic mobility; reform our tax code; expand automatic stabilizers, including through unemployment insurance reform, SNAP expansion, and state and local fiscal relief; combat evictions and expand affordable housing; reform our budget and appropriations process; and a variety of other issues.

Her public conversations, like the New America series centering Black women as agents of change and her 2015 TED talk “The Story We Tell About Poverty Isn’t True,” draw targeted attention to the stories of people who are finding their way into leadership roles despite myriad barriers, while also highlighting the vibrant terrain of all marginalized people who are leading on the ground and solving for tomorrow.\n\nMia is a Senior Fellow of the Economic Security Project.
