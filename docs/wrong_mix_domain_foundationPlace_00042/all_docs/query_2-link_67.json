Consequently, vast numbers of people face major challenges in the areas of water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Water is a strategic core business area for NORMA Group. It is also very close to our hearts, as we realize the impact that water scarcity has on children and especially girls.\n\nNORMA Clean Water is our lighthouse social ­commitment project which seeks to show how challenges in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene can be met through cooperation between business and civil society. Training in the use of clean drinking water and hygiene is at the core of all our various projects.\n\nThe initial project was the water supply and hygiene situation in Indian schools in the greater Pune area. Construction measures for the repair and renovation of toilet facilities were implemented together with training in the use of clean drinking water and hygiene. Today, NORMA Clean Water is working in the state of Maranhão in northeastern Brazil. The aim of the project is to improve the living and health conditions of children and their families.\n\nRead more\n\nInfrastructure\n\nIndustries and the communities they serve are growing exponentially, and as they do, they are ever more critically dependent on innovative, robust infrastructure for support.
