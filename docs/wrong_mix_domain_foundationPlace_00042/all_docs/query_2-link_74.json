        "text": "In 2001, a small \"support group\" of six conservators, curators, and technical professionals grappling with the acquisition and exhibition of time-based media art began meeting to discuss the challenges of acquiring and caring for works of time-based media art (TBMA). In 2010, the group became an official Met working group and has grown to include about fifty members across sixteen departments within the museum, including a number of curatorial departments, conservation and scientific research departments, Museum Archives, the Counsel's Office, the Development Office, the Digital Department, and the Office of the Registrar.\n\nOur mission is to develop and maintain museum-wide standards for collecting, preserving, and exhibiting time-based media art. Working Group members educate The Met staff about issues related to these types of artworks and advocate for better care and preservation of our time-based media holdings. The Museum's ultimate goal is to establish a full program in TBMA conservation to include permanent TBMA conservation staff, a dedicated fellowship, and to build on collaborative partnerships with the TBMA conservation community in New York and internationally."
