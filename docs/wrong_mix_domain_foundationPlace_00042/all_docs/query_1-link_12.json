        "text": "Arts\n\nHarnessing the power of arts and culture to improve communities across the globe\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies believes in the power of arts and culture to inspire creativity and spark collaboration. The Arts program supports artists and cultural organizations and improves audience experience to strengthen the creative landscape and quality of life in cities around the world. These efforts include facilitating collaborations between artists and local governments to address civic issues, building capacity for small and mid-sized cultural institutions, and increasing and enhancing visitor engagement through the integration of digital technology.\n\nStrengthening Local Arts Organizations\n\nDiminished support for cultural institutions — from both government and private funding sources — has made it increasingly challenging for cultural organizations to focus on producing and presenting creative work. Through unique programs and partnerships, Bloomberg Philanthropies is helping arts and cultural organizations learn and implement vital strategies to better manage their operations and access new funding sources.\n\nRead more\n\nConnecting Audiences to Culture Online or Onsite\n\nDigital technology has the power to make the art and offerings of cultural organizations more accessible — not just to those visiting in person, but to people around the world. That’s why, since 1999, Bloomberg Philanthropies has helped museums stay up to date with relevant new technology — such as audio guides, mobile apps, and location-aware navigational tools — to transform the visitor experience, encouraging interaction and exploration on- and offsite.\n\nRead more\n\nSupporting Public Art\n\nArtists can be powerful drivers of civic progress, shining a light on critical issues and encouraging others to take action on them. That’s why, since 2014, Bloomberg Philanthropies has been bringing mayors and artists together to collaborate on temporary public art projects that start conversations, spur change, and strengthen communities across America.\n\nRead more\n\nAdvancing the Arts Around the World\n\nBloomberg Philanthropies believes in the unique power of art to transform how we experience the world around us — whether it’s in a museum, on the street, or in the workplace. Bloomberg Philanthropies has supported a wide range of cultural organizations and public art projects, including within and around the European headquarters of Bloomberg L.P. in London.\n\nRead more\n\nTop photo: Volunteers and community members at the opening of artist David Best’s “Temple of Time” in Parkland, FL. The Temple is one of five installations in the city’s Bloomberg Philanthropies Public Art Challenge winning project “Inspiring Community Healing After Gun Violence: The Power of Art.”"
