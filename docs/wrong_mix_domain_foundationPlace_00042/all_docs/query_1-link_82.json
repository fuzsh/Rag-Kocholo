        "text": "We champion the vital role of the arts in all their manifestations: the playful, speculative and experimental; the progressive, interrogative and radical. We are dedicated to the exploration of both traditional and contemporary modes of making and material enquiry. Our research examines the profound impact creative practices have upon our lives, our means to think and act critically, and to affect change in society.\n\nThe curiosity and ingenuity of our students enable us to embrace an innovative and interdisciplinary portfolio of education and research, spanning art, media and technology, design and fashion and textiles. We work across a full range of high-spec studios, workshops, technology suites,and research labs. We foster a learning experience and an exchange of ideas that emphasises industry partnerships, project-led enquiry and high level research and making.\n\nAmong our many notable alumni are Turner Prize-nominated artist Darren Almond, composer and musician Brian Eno, the painter Katie Pratt and fashion designer Stella Tennant.\n\nThe various equipment and making processes available range from the manual and analogue to the digital, networked, and programmable.\n\nOur facilities enable pioneering work by students and research by colleagues in areas such as:\n\ne-textiles innovation\n\nimmersive service design\n\naugmented and virtual reality explorations\n\nludic technologies, ubiquitous computing and expanded games making work\n\nWe support whole garment digital knit machines, weave technologies from the hand operated to the computer aided, and the capacity to print pretty much anything on pretty much anything. We’re one of relatively few schools at which an object can be metal cast in a foundry, scanned, 3-printed, scanned again and digitally remodelled, before being scanned and printed (or cast) again or rendered in virtual space.\n\nOur comprehensively stocked media store supports all our students with photographic, video, projection, and audio resources, and our photographic studios, and workshops in mould making, wood, metal and plastic, and painting, ensure practice is broad and exploratory."
