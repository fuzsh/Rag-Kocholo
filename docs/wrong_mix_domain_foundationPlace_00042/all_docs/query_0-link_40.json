She was on track to graduate with honors from Northwest when her life tragically ended when she was killed by a drunken driver on August 2010.\n\nHer parents, Pat and Diana Cockrill of Platte City, created the Abby Leigh Cockrill Memorial Foundation Scholarship through the Northwest Foundation in her memory. The scholarship recipients must be juniors or seniors at Northwest majoring in elementary education, with priority given to students involved in Greek life.\n\n“Abby’s spirit and enthusiasm were a joyous inspiration to everyone who knew her,” said Dr. Barbara Crossland, former associate professor of curriculum and instruction. “It’s wonderful that this scholarship will honor her memory.”\n\n“Abby was a perfect model of our enthusiastic, committed future teachers,” said Dr. Margaret Drew, former professor of curriculum and instruction.\n\nCockrill was a member of Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority where she had served as parliamentarian, was in charge of their overall Homecoming for two years and served as a Gamma Chi for two years, helping mentor and guide ladies going through recruitment. She also was selected to the Order of Omega, a Greek honor society.\n\nCockrill participated in the annual BRUSH (Beautifying Residences Using Student Help) projects on campus and in the community, contributed to the Ministry Center Food Drive Campaign, raised funds for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, assisted with residential life programming and facilitated residential spirituality nights.\n\nIn addition, she was on the President’s Honor Roll, was a member of Tower Choir her freshman year and was a member of the Cardinal Key National Honor Society, where she helped in events to raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. She volunteered and supported Special Olympics, participated in Kids Corner, where she read books to children and those in hospitals, and read to children at Northwest’s Horace Mann Laboratory School.\n\n“Abby was a true leader who had the ability to inspire others to be better people and to give back to their community,” said her mother, Diana Cockrill. “Ever since she was a young girl, she wanted to teach and make a difference in the lives of children. She had a passion for working with children and youth and the enthusiasm to be a wonderful teacher. Abby truly loved to live and lived to love.”\n\nScholarships associated with Abby Leigh Cockrill\n\nAbby Leigh Cockrill Memorial Scholarship\n\nA-C Lightning\n\nScholarships associated with A-C Lightning\n\nA-C Lightning Scholarship\n\nAccounting Faculty\n\nScholarships associated with Accounting Faculty\n\nAccounting Faculty Award\n\nAda M Royston\n\nThis award is given in honor of Mrs. Ada M.

He was also the nephew of Albert H. Cooper. He was a graduate of Sheridan High School and Northwest Missouri State Teacher’s College in Maryville, MO. In 1937, while students in college, Albert and Virginia were married. Albert graduated in 1940 with a teaching degree in Business and Agriculture. He taught 3 years in a one room school and was Superintendent of the Grandview, McFall and Dearborn, MO Schools before entering the U.S. Navy in World War II. He served in the South Pacific as a Lieutenant Jr. Grade. After the war, Albert and Virginia moved to Kansas City, Missouri and Albert worked for the Veterans Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration where he was a Division Chief 24 of his 31 years in government.\n\nVirginia Ina Needels, daughter of William and Minnie Wall Needels, was born October 21, 1915 at the family homestead near Parnell, Mo. She graduated from Ravenwood High School and Northwest Missouri State Teacher’s College. Virginia graduated in 1940 with a teaching degree in Home Economics, English and Social Studies. She taught in one room schools in McFall and Dearborn, Missouri, and in Kansas City. She was an active member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.\n\nAlbert and Virginia loved caring for family and volunteering in Scouts and Broadway Methodist Church where they were members for 58 years. They were loving caring religious hard working patriots and examples of God's very best.\n\nScholarships associated with Albert & Virginia Winemiller\n\nAlbert & Virginia Winemiller Scholarship\n\nAlbert H & Eula Cooper\n\nAlbert Henry \"Bert\" Cooper was born July 3, 1880 in Mercer County Illinois. His family moved to Taylor County, Iowa when he was two years old. They came to Nodaway County the next year to a farm four miles southwest of Sheridan, Missouri. Albert was the oldest of nine children. He attended the Lone Star Rural School northeast of Gaynor, Missouri. He also attended the Maryville Normal School where he was a member of the 1907 class, Chicago University, and Harvard University, where he received his Master's Degree in Education in 1925.\n\nAlbert taught in a Nodaway County school and was Superintendent of Schools at Barnard and Grant City. He was the Nodaway County Superintendent of Schools from 1916 to 1921. During this time the four-year high schools were established in the county. He was an expert in rural education and was brought on the Northwest staff by President Uel Lamkin as director of extension and correspondence work from 1921 to 1947. He served in the State Legislature as a representative from Nodaway County from 1935 to 1941. From 1941 until his death in 1957, he was Director of the Department of Business and Administration of the State of Missouri. In 1963 Cooper Hall was added to the residence hall complex and named to honor Albert's contribution to Northwest.\n\nOn July 18, 1920, he married another school teacher, Eula Snowberger of Graham, Missouri. The two together were always interested in the young people with whom they were associated. They encouraged and supported the education of nieces and nephews and many other young people. Of the thirteen Cooper nieces and nephews, eleven became teachers.\n\nAlbert E. Winemiller, a nephew, and his wife, Virginia, established this scholarship to honor both Albert \"Bert\" and his wife, Eula. The scholarship is designed to assist students showing promise as teachers.\n\nScholarships associated with Albert H & Eula Cooper\n\nAlbert & Eula Cooper Memorial Scholarship\n\nAldrich Family\n\nThe Aldrich Family Memorial Scholarship was established with a gift from Dr. Anita Aldrich, Northwest Foundation board director, in the fall of 1976. Dr. Anita Aldrich was a 1936 graduate of Northwest Missouri State Teachers College and a dedicated health, physical education and recreation professional, teacher, advocate, volunteer and leader.\n\nDuring a career spanning 47 years, she served as a teacher and administrator of physical education programs in King City, St. Joseph and Kansas City, Mo., and at Indiana University. She was appointed in 1961 as an advisor to President John F. Kennedy’s Fitness Council and served as president during 1962-1963 of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education and Recreation to which she was later named an honor fellow.\n\nScholarships associated with Aldrich Family\n\nAldrich Family Memorial Scholarship\n\nAleta and Dean Hubbard\n\nDecades before becoming Northwest’s ninth president, Dr. Dean Hubbard was a first-generation college student working to realize his aspirations of attaining a college degree and doing it with little financial support.\n\nAs he neared the completion of his bachelor’s degree at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Mich., Hubbard was the beneficiary of one farmer’s financial gift to the institution.\n\nAs Northwest’s president from 1984 until his retirement in 2009, Hubbard, with his wife, Aleta, helped shape the University as a leader in Missouri higher education and worked to make it affordable for people lacking the financial means to work toward a college degree.\n\nToday the Hubbards continue to fulfill that mission and recently pledged to assist deserving scholars through their namesake scholarship and the Dr. Joe Willey & Dr. Barbara J. Orr-Willey Fund. The Aleta & Dean Hubbard Scholarship was established in 2003 through a cash gift by the Willeys, who are longtime friends of the Hubbards, and multiple scholarships are awarded annually to entering Northwest freshmen.\n\nAs Northwest president, Hubbard led the University to national recognition for its “Culture of Quality” initiative, which fostered continuous improvement in all aspects of the institution’s operations. Northwest won the Missouri Quality Award four consecutive times – in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2008 – and is the only educational institution in the state to have done so.\n\nHubbard’s presidency also involved making Northwest the first comprehensive electronic campus in the United States in 1987, and he supported the expansion of Northwest’s pioneering alternative fuels program. The alternative fuels program transforms recycled cardboard, paper and agricultural wastes into energy to heat and cool the campus, and it saved the University more than $10 million dollars during Hubbard’s tenure compared to the cost of purchasing natural gas.\n\nAdditionally, Hubbard’s vision to provide unparalleled learning and research opportunities for Northwest students and faculty in a wide range of disciplines translated into the development of the Dean L. Hubbard Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which was renamed in his honor in 2014.\n\nScholarships associated with Aleta and Dean Hubbard\n\nAleta and Dean Hubbard Scholarship\n\nAlfred E Sergel III\n\nThe Alfred E Sergel III Band Alumni Scholarship was established by the Northwest Band Alumni Chapter in honor of Mr. Sergel for his 23 years as Director of Bands at Northwest.\n\nScholarships associated with Alfred E Sergel III\n\nAlfred E Sergel III Band Alumni Scholarship\n\nAlice Corley\n\nScholarships associated with Alice Corley\n\nAlice Corley Scholarship\n\nAlice M Oliver\n\nAlice was born on a farm east of Guilford, Missouri in 1911 where she lived much of her life with her husband Wesley H. Oliver. Living through the Great Depression of the early 20th century, she learned the value of practicality and saving money.\n\nAlthough she had no children of her own, she doted on nieces and nephews and followed their growth and activities and education.\n\nIn her last few years of her life, Alice lived in an assisted living facility where she grew to love and respect those who provided her with care. She heard their stories of working hard while furthering their education and very much wanted to provide this scholarship with a nursing focus at Northwest.\n\nAfter her death in 2010, portions of her estate were given to numerous charities that were near and dear to her heart, including Children’s Mercy Hospital, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Association. Another scholarship is endowed at South Nodaway R-IV Schools for high school students pursuing higher education.\n\nScholarships associated with Alice M Oliver\n\nAlice M Oliver Nursing Scholarship\n\nAllen A. & Helen Doak\n\nWhen Cheryl Clark was looking for a way to memorialize her parents after their deaths, she decided a gift to Northwest Missouri State University in support of education was a fitting tribute.\n\nClark, with her husband, Steve, is honoring her parents with the creation of the Allen A. and Helen Doak Family Scholarship for math education majors who demonstrate potential for success as a teacher.\n\nThe scholarship is a tribute to Allen’s career as a math teacher, principal, superintendent and basketball coach as well as Helen’s contributions to her husband's endeavors as a full-time homemaker and assistance with their farming operation. Allen was a 1930 Northwest graduate and passed away in 2000; Helen died in 2010.\n\n“His life was fulfilled,” Clark said of her father. “He lived his life doing what he enjoyed, which was teaching and farming.”\n\nAllen was the second of four children. After graduating high school, he joined his sister at Northwest, and his brothers followed for a period of time.\n\nHe had a passion for learning. Rather than taking advantage of summer breaks, he remained enrolled in classes and graduated with his sister, who started college a year prior to him.\n\nWhile at Northwest, Allen was the treasurer of his graduating class. He also worked his way through college as an employee in the kitchen of one of the women’s dormitories.\n\n“To this day, we still have one of the recipes used in the kitchen,” Clark said. “I call it ‘Allen A’s French Salad Dressing.”\n\nHe served in the Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as lieutenant commander. His teaching career included three years at Turney, Missouri, seven years at Lawson, Missouri, as a math teacher, basketball coach and superintendent, and 15 years at Osborn, Missouri, where he was a math teacher and principal. He finished his career as a teacher and assistant basketball coach in Cameron, Missouri.\n\n“He would also say that although grades are important, the experiences you have and the people you meet in your college years will be with you forever, and the lives you touch in your teaching career will span generations,” Clark said.\n\nScholarships associated with Allen A. & Helen Doak\n\nAllen A & Helen Doak Family Scholarship\n\nAlpha Chi\n\nAlpha Chi is a coeducational academic honor society. Since 1922 its purpose has been to promote academic excellence and exemplary character among college and university students and to honor those who achieve such distinction.\n\nScholarships associated with Alpha Chi\n\nAlpha Chi Scholarship\n\nAlpha Phi Omega\n\nAlpha Phi Omega Scholarship Fund was established in May, 1976.\n\nScholarships associated with Alpha Phi Omega\n\nAlpha Phi Omega Scholarship\n\nAlpha Tau Alpha\n\nAlpha Tau Alpha (ATA) is an honorary organization for Agriculture Education majors.

Grandson Nathan Leopard was a member of Northwest Celebration and granddaughter Hayley Leopard was a member of Tower Choir and the flag corp of the Bearcat Marching Band. Hayley is married to Tom Brockman, also a Bearcat and the current Director of Bands in the Smithville School District. The family connection to both the instrumental and vocal music programs at Northwest has been a strong one through the years. The family is pleased to be able to support the music program by providing this scholarship for a deserving student.\n\nScholarships associated with Alsbury-Leopard Family\n\nAlsbury-Leopard Family Music Scholarship\n\nAlyce L Cummins\n\nAlyce L. Cummins (the family matriarch) recognized the importance of education. As a young woman, she went to college to become an educator, but the Great Depression interrupted her path. In her 40s, as a non-traditional student, she fulfilled her dream as a second-grade school teacher. The approach of caring about the student AND child made her a favorite by many.\n\nScholarships associated with Alyce L Cummins\n\nAlyce L Cummins Future Educator Scholarship\n\nAmy Munro-Kounovsky\n\nBob and Jan FitzSimmons, of Lincoln, Nebraska, recently honored 2008 Northwest alumna Amy Munro-Kounovsky by establishing the Amy Munro-Kounovsky Scholarship. Beginning with 2017-2018, a $500 scholarship will be awarded to a Northwest junior or senior majoring in corporate recreation and wellness and enrolled in a recreation internship.\n\nMunro-Kounovsky graduated from Northwest with degrees in corporate recreation and wellness and therapeutic recreation, and she became American College of Sport Medicine certified in 2008. After graduation, she accepted a position Prairie Life Fitness in Lincoln and works as a personal trainer.\n\nThe FitzSimmons value a healthy lifestyle, and Jan is a member at Prairie Life Fitness. Six years ago, she was looking for a new personal trainer. Amy and Jan began working together, and Jan is thankful of Amy’s knowledge and experience in the fitness world.\n\n“Amy is very good to work with,” Jan said. “She developed a great approach for working with senior citizens with multiple medical issues.”\n\nWhen Munro-Kounovsky got married in 2016, Jan wanted to do something to honor her for a wedding gift. The FitzSimmons endowed a scholarship in her name not only as a tribute to her but because of their belief in education.\n\n“The scholarship that Bob and Jan put in my name is one of the most generous things anyone has ever done for me,” Munro-Kounovsky said. “I feel extremely lucky and thankful to be a part of something that will help students fulfill their dreams of helping others through health and wellness.”\n\nBob graduated from high school in 1958 and received a four-year scholarship to attend Kansas University, and Jan received a scholarship as a student at South Dakota State University. Because of the financial support they received in college, they understand the impact scholarships have on students’ lives.\n\n“Sometimes the students who don’t qualify for the large scholarships believe it is because they did not earn a 4.0 grade-point average,” Jan said. “People have to understand there are a lot of different things that come into play like the amount of time a student works after school or extra-curricular activities. This does not mean they don’t value their education. It’s just that other things were pulling them in different directions.”\n\nThe FitzSimmons view endowed scholarships as an opportunity to leave a legacy to the communities that have paved the way for their careers and lives. With the number of people applying for college, they encourage students to be timely and diligent in researching scholarship opportunities.\n\n“I think there is a lot of deserving young students who haven’t been able to attend the college they wanted to because of the cost,” Bob said. “Scholarships are out there. I encourage them to do a lot of research and apply for as many as they can.”\n\nAs a student, Munro-Kounovsky took advantage of networks and connections with Northwest faculty. She worked at a ropes course in New Hampshire for a summer, worked at the former Northwest fitness center and interned at Prairie Life Fitness, where she is currently employed.\n\n“I am very grateful for the connections and all of the hands-on experiences that aided me in choosing the right career path,” Munro-Kounovsky said.\n\nScholarships associated with Amy Munro-Kounovsky\n\nAmy Munro-Kounovsky Scholarship\n\nAmy P Elifrits\n\nIn 1989, C. Dale Elifrits and his father established the Amy P. Elifrits Scholarship in loving memory of his mother. Mrs. Elifrits was a 1960 graduate of Northwest with a degree in elementary education.

In fact, the husband and wife duo have shared many memories through the years at Northwest.\n\nBoth from different backgrounds and with different goals, somehow they ended up at Northwest and spent a combined 69 years teaching on campus. Jerry came to Northwest from Minnesota in 1964 to teach, while Ann was in Jefferson City earning her master's degree. The couple met during registration in Lamkin Gym in 1965 and were married in 1966.\n\nThe couple continued to teach in their respective departments, Jerry focusing primarily on constitutional law and Ann on modern, social, aerobic and recreational dance.\n\nScholarships associated with Ann Allen Brekke\n\nAnn Allen Brekke Scholarship\n\nAnna M Painter\n\nIn October of 1947, the Maryville Branch of the American Association of University Women started raising money for a graduate loan fund, the purpose being to encourage graduate study among women. Most of the original funds were from donations by women alumni of Northwest. Money was also left to the branch by the will of Dr. Anna M. Painter (professor of English at Northwest for many years) after the fund had been named in her honor. The first loan was made in 1951. The fund was replenished and available for addtional loans as previous loans were repaid. In 1981, because of the increase in interest rates and an additional contribution from the Branch, the loan was changed to a graduate scholarship for women.\n\nScholarships associated with Anna M Painter\n\nAnna M Painter Graduate Scholarship\n\nAnne (Morgan) Sapp\n\nDenny Sapp, a 1968 Northwest graduate who became a Naval aviator and served as a Blue Angels solo demonstration pilot for two seasons, established the Anne Morgan Sapp Dream Team Scholarship through the Northwest Foundation.\n\n“She was just always there to do something for somebody else,” Denny said. “The empathy that she had was unreal. I just never knew anybody like her. I guess that’s why I wanted to be part of her life.”\n\nThe scholarship will assist students who qualify for the Northwest Promise, previously known as the American Dream Grant. The inaugural scholarship of $1,000 was awarded for the 2023-24 academic year.\n\nDenny told Anne about the scholarship’s creation on her birthday, July 29, just weeks before she died on Aug. 14, after a three-year battle with multiple myeloma.\n\n“She was incredibly tickled about it, knowing that it was going to be a scholarship for people who were in need,” Denny said.\n\nAnne was born and raised in Elliott, Iowa, and graduated from Northwest in 1969 with a bachelor’s degree in English. She was an active member of Sigma Sigma Sigma sorority and served as its president. She also was voted Northwest’s Tower Queen.\n\nDenny was born and raised in Red Oak, Iowa, and graduated from Northwest with a bachelor’s degree in secondary education with an emphasis in industrial arts. He was active in the Phi Sigma Epsilon fraternity and met Anne while he was serving as the Phi Sig house manager.\n\nAs a member of the U.S. Navy, he made three deployments to Vietnam, recording 367 combat missions and receiving numerous decorations. He then was assigned duties as a test and evaluation pilot at the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California. From there, Denny was selected to join the Blue Angels in Pensacola, Florida, where he flew as a solo demonstration pilot in 1975 and 1976.\n\nSapp retired from the Navy after 23 years of service with the rank of captain. He then flew for Western Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines.\n\nDue to Denny’s Naval service, the couple moved frequently and Anne carried her passion for education with them. Anne’s first teaching position was in a north Florida high school with more than 4,000 students on the heels of racial integration, which sparked her advocacy for social justice.\n\nWhen the couple moved to Thousand Oaks, California, in the early 1980s, Anne started a learning assistance program at California Lutheran University. She finished her career teaching at Gig Harbor High School in Washington, where she taught for five years and was voted favorite teacher three times by the senior class.\n\n“She was an educator at the top of the board,” Denny said. “She was always concerned about students not having funds to go to college.”\n\nOnce retired, the couple traveled extensively, including multiple trips to Cambodia, where they worked with a non-government organization (NGO) to help rescue trafficked children and open a school.\n\n“I wanted people to understand what kind of a person she had been and the accolades that she had received her entire life,” Denny said. “She was always willing to step to the background and not be in the limelight. She liked to sit in the front row of class, but she never wanted to be in the limelight.”\n\nScholarships associated with Anne (Morgan) Sapp\n\nAnne (Morgan) Sapp Dream Team Scholarship\n\nAnnelle Z Weymuth\n\nScholarships associated with Annelle Z Weymuth\n\nAnnelle Z Weymuth Scholarship\n\nAnonymous\n\nEstablished to assist graduate students pursuing a degree in English.\n\nScholarships associated with Anonymous\n\nGraduate English Fellowship\n\nAnonymous PCMC\n\nScholarships associated with Anonymous PCMC\n\nAnonymous PCMC Scholarship\n\nArne & Mary Le Johnson\n\nNorthwest Missouri State University alumnus Arne Johnson and his wife, Mary Le, want students to earn an education at a campus that is inviting to all.\n\nWith that in mind, the Johnsons’established the the Arne and Mary Le Johnson Scholarship, which focus on students’ academic and financial needs.\n\nWhile Mary Le is an architect in Houston, Arne, a 1977 graduate of Northwest, is the senior vice president of general counsel and secretary for Noble Energy, an independent oil and gas company there. He heads the corporate affairs legal department, the company’s corporate compliance department, and global security and government relations.\n\n“To us, philanthropy in general is a way to make a real difference in the world,” Arne said. “In this context, philanthropy is really about creating opportunities for others that in a lot of cases we have been fortunate to have ourselves.”\n\nArne attributes his career success to the high values and principles he developed at Northwest.\n\n“I studied political science and public administration at Northwest, and I think that was what sparked my interest to go to law school,” he said. “I believe more than anything else, just learning the importance of solid values are things that have been helpful.”\n\nGrowing up in Shenandoah, Iowa, Arne never thought he would attend college.\n\n“Looking back, I’m not sure there was a time I thought I could or would go to college, let alone graduate,” he said. “I think, in a lot of ways, I am probably the prototypical Northwest student with somewhat of a modest, rural background and the first in the family to attend and finish college. It’s a role the school has continued to play today.”\n\nNorthwest proved to be a comfortable way to bridge the gap between his small town roots and the career path he wanted to pursue.\n\n“It’s funny because it was really only later on in my life that I came to appreciate how much of a difference Northwest made in my life,” Arne said. “What I love most about Northwest is it’s a harvesting ground for diamonds in the rough. You realize, if you work hard, you can make something of it.”\n\nAfter learning more about the TRIO program at Northwest and scholarship opportunities, Arne and Mary Le wanted to assist people interested in attending the University but who may not have the financial resources to do so. Launched at Northwest in 1986, TRIO is a federally recognized educational outreach program designed for students with disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\n“We like the idea that the TRIO program kind of created a bridge of programs to help students make the transition to the college degree environment,” Arne said. “From our perspective, we have always been committed to the idea of scholarships and the opportunities that scholarships can create.”\n\nThe Johnsons believe students who face and overcome the greatest challenges are often the University’s greatest success stories.\n\n“We found that supporting scholarships helps people get the education they need,” Arne said. “Quite simply, Northwest is an excellent value proposition in providing a good education. The academic excellence the school provides is at a very reasonable price. We also feel like our support at Northwest makes a difference.”\n\nArne fosters his passion for Northwest as president of the Northwest Foundation Board of Directors. As he returns to Northwest for Board meetings, he is always impressed with the examples of successful graduates and the high-caliber faculty.\n\n“When I think back about the time I was there and look more recently at some of my work as a Board member, I really feel blessed to have the opportunity to meet with a number of the faculty,” Arne said. “What has also impressed me about the faculty at Northwest is the degree of commitment that each and every one of them seem to have enriching their students’ lives. I don’t believe this is something you can fake. The faculty at Northwest are truly genuine in their interest of student success.”\n\nArne, & Mary Le Johnson\n\nScholarships associated with Arne, & Mary Le Johnson\n\nArne & Mary Le Johnson Powering Dreams Scholarship\n\nArt & Bettie Beckner\n\nThe Art & Bettie Beckner Memorial Scholarship was established by their children, Michael Beckner and Cindy Beckner McManis, in honor and memory of their parents.

Stelter's grandfather, August, came to America from Germany with his parents in 1855. On the voyage, August's father became ill and died, leaving his mother and five younger siblings alone in a foreign country, and none of them could speak English. They settled in Burlington, Iowa, where August, at only 13 years old, got a job laying tile lines. August and his wife, Henrietta, successfully expanded their farming operation and were able to give a farm to each of their three daughters and three sons.\n\nThe August Stelter Scholarship fund was created in 2002 by Stelter's cousin, Bea Lemon Hansen. The fund provides assistance to entering freshmen majoring in agriculture. The late Robert Stelter and his wife, Ruth, provided additional funding to boost the fund for qualified Northwest students.\n\nScholarships associated with August Stelter\n\nAugust Stelter Scholarship\n\nAwalt G Steffen\n\nA family tragedy and an unexpected move brought Helen Steffen from Ohio to Missouri where she eventually met her husband, and now she has established a memorial scholarship in his name at Northwest Missouri State University. Helen was 5 years old when her parents died within hours of each other from complications of the bubonic plague, leaving her and three siblings behind. The children were split up. Her older brother stayed with family in Ohio, Helen and her 3-year-old sister moved to St. Joseph with an uncle and his family, and neighbors adopted her 6-week-old sister. Despite being hundreds of miles apart and being raised by three different families, the siblings remained in close contact throughout their lives.\n\nIf not for that move to St. Joseph with her uncle, Helen would not have met her late husband, Awalt, whom she married in 1941. Together they built a life focused on education and serving others. Awalt served 19 years as a YMCA secretary in St. Joseph, Grand Junction, Colo., and Muskogee, Okla. In 1948, they found themselves back in St. Joseph where they owned and operated Steffen's Bookstore for 13 years. It was during this time that they decided they wanted to continue their education and become teachers. Awalt commuted to Maryville and graduated in 1957, at the age of 47, with a bachelor's in elementary education, and later earned a master's in educational leadership, also from Northwest. Helen continued to run the bookstore until Awalt started his first teaching job at Spring Garden School, at which time she commuted to Maryville and graduated in 1964, at the age of 51, with a bachelor's in elementary education.\n\nThe Steffens went on to enjoy careers in education where Awalt retired in 1974 as principal in King City, and Helen retired the following year from Hawthorne Elementary, now Coleman Elementary, in St. Joseph, while always striving to serve their community through church initiatives and programs such as Sertoma International. One project in particular that Helen is proud of is one that spanned an eight-year period and took place in the basement of their home. The Steffens, along with the help of a few others, made more than 880 sleeping bags that they donated to the local food bank.\n\nAwalt died in 2008 at the age of 97. In memory of her late husband, Helen established the Awalt G. Steffen Memorial Scholarship through the Northwest Foundation.\n\nScholarships associated with Awalt G Steffen\n\nAwalt G Steffen Memorial Scholarship\n\nB D & Janet Scott\n\nCamellia Scott Barmann '85 and Maryville High School sweetheart-turned-husband Rob Barmann '84 thought it would be nice to create a scholarship to honor Camellia's parents, B.D. and Janet Scott, and their Northwest connection while her parents were still living.\n\nIn 1960, B.D. Scott accepted a teaching position at Northwest and moved his family to Maryville. Camellia enjoyed her days at Horace Mann with her brother, David Scott '79, and sister, Karen Scott Pfost (attd. '78-'79), and said she always knew she would attend Northwest.\n\nScholarships associated with B D & Janet Scott\n\nB D and Janet Scott Biology Scholarship\n\nB D & Sue Wright Owens\n\nDr. B.D. '59 and Sue Wright '57 Owens met while attending Northwest, so the phrase \"coming home\" always held a special meaning for the couple when B.C. became Northwest's eighth president from 1977 to 1984. Owens is the only Northwest alumnus claiming this honor. Thanks to Owens' tireless efforts following the devastating Administration Building fire of 1979, the University was able to obtain $13.8 million of emergency state funding to restore the University's signature building. Additionally, funds were secured to build a new performing arts center and a library, which is named for Owens. An avid environmentalist, B.D. also took the first steps toward developing an alternative fuels program, which has saved the University millions of dollars in energy costs. Sue's belief in educating tomorrow's future leaders also was demonstrated throughout her music teaching career in public schools.\n\nThe couple established the B.D. and Sue Wright Owens Scholarship at Northwest as a permanent endowment in 2003 to provide critical financial assistance for the University's incoming freshmen.\n\nScholarships associated with B D & Sue Wright Owens\n\nB D & Sue Wright Owens Scholarship\n\nBart & Emma Maxwell Utterback\n\nWhen sisters Roberta Utterback '39 and Lois Utterback Beal '37 decided to establish scholarships that would perpetuate their parents' names as well as their own, pleasant memories of their alma mater led them to establish charitable gift annuities with the Northwest Foundation.\n\nLois and Roberta's parents had always encouraged education for their six children. The sisters, whose mother was a teacher, taught in rural Missouri schools during the winter and attended Northwest during the summer months to complete their degrees in education. Lois, who retired in 1977, lived in Greenville, Mich., where she last served as principal of the Baldwin Heights Elementary School.

The fund honors Betty, a mother and educator, who began her teaching career as a first grade teacher at Nodaway-Holt and retired from the North Andrew school system as an elementary principal. Whether she was being a teacher, a parent, or just a bystander, Betty constantly looked out for children and their best interests. Betty's passion for life, learning, teaching and for being a dedicated educator was apparent to all as was her love of family, especially for her husband Martin and their children Steve, Tim, Julie and Marla and their spouses, and, of course, their grandchildren.\n\nScholarships associated with Betty Schieber\n\nBetty Schieber Scholarship\n\nBeverly J & Edward J Shelton\n\nThe Beverly J & Edward J Shelton Scholarship was established with a donation from Beverly Holt Shelton '46 in memory of her late husband, Edward Shelton '42.

'46-'48) Owens created the Bill & Betty Lou (Egger) Owens Family Scholarship to honor friends who made a special impact on their lives, and to impact Northwest students from the Hopkins region where they were raised.\n\nAfter serving in the Army and graduating from Northwest with a teaching degree, Bill began his teaching career in Graham, Mo., and Atchison, Kan. By 1958, he had earned his master's degree in school administration, retiring from the Wheaton, Ill., school system in 1984. Much of Bill's career was spent as an elementary school principal n sixth-grade teacher.\n\nBetty taught in five one-room school throughout Nodaway County, raised her daughters, Brenda and Beth, and later earned her teaching degree in 1970. She then taught fourth grade in Bensenville, Ill., and retired from teaching in 1989. The couple now lives in Beverly Hills, Fla.\n\nThe Owens's pursuit of educating others has never wavered, even after retirement. Establishing The Bill & Betty Lou (Eggers) Owens Family Scholarship in memory of Albert Owens, Vance Geiger, Larry Melvin and Paul Gates is their way of honoring mentors and making a lasting, educational impact on today's students.\n\nScholarships associated with Bill & Betty Lou (Egger) Owens Family\n\nBill & Betty Lou (Egger) Owens Family Scholarship\n\nBill & Jodie Mackintosh\n\nBill ’76 and Jodie Hamilton ’77 Mackintosh met while attending Northwest. Bill was from Gallatin, MO and Jodie was a first-generation college student from Kansas City, MO. Bill and Jodie always felt thankful for the education they received while students at Northwest. Also, they were grateful for the many lifelong friendships they made during college. Bill was a member of Phi Sigma Epsilon and Jodie was an Alpha Sigma Alpha.\n\nAfter graduation from Northwest they moved to Omaha, NE. Bill co-founded Financial Products Corporation in 1981, a computer maintenance company, and was also a partner in P&L Companies, a local leasing and technology company. One of Bill’s greatest joys in life was working alongside his children, Mike and Ashley, in their family business, American Title Inc., which they purchased in 2004. The company grew through Bill’s vision and leadership and was recognized as one of Omaha’s Best Places to Work in 2011 and 2014.\n\nJodie was a teacher for Omaha Public Schools and Millard Public Schools before having children. Most of her life she has been a homemaker and community volunteer. She has been a member of many boards for non-profits in the Omaha community which focus on children and families. Jodie and Bill were both board members of the Northwest Foundation.\n\nBill was an avid reader of the Wall Street Journal. One day there was an article that discussed the availability of scholarships for students as freshman but not many for students to help them graduate college. Before Bill passed away in 2016, he and Jodie decided to establish the Powering Dreams Scholarship to help students that are Northwest seniors. They knew what a difference a college degree made in their lives and they wanted to make sure other Northwest students could become a college graduate and have the same opportunities.\n\nScholarships associated with Bill & Jodie Mackintosh\n\nBill & Jodie Mackintosh Powering Dreams Scholarship\n\nBill Fields\n\nThe Bill Fields Memorial Scholarship was established in memory of William Victor Fields who passed away in 1974 following a brief illness.

Bill or Billy (as his family often referred to him) was the first-born son to Paul and Zelma (Rider) Winters. The family then moved several times in Bill’s life residing in Metz, Rich Hill, and then in Raytown, MO. Bill was a fantastic athlete from a very young age. As a thirteen-year-old freshman, he beat out a junior to start quarterback. As a fourteen-year-old freshman, he beat out the senior pitcher on the baseball team. Bill started and lettered all four years in Football, Baseball and Track. Bill graduated from Raytown High School in 1941. Upon graduating, Bill was awarded a Full Ride Scholarship for Football to Northwest Missouri State Teachers College located in Maryville, Missouri.\n\nThe summer before college, Bill (a seventeen-year-old) tried out and made the roster of the St. Louis Cardinals minor league baseball team. He played pitcher/1st base. After a summer of baseball, Bill packed up and headed to NW Missouri State in the fall 1941. Although Bill may have been a better baseball player, he opted to play football in college, Bill claims that it was more fun. Bill played for nearly two seasons. The positions that he played in college were Right Halfback and Left Cornerback. The team earned the title of Conference Co-Champs Bill’s freshmen year. Bill’s sophomore year the team won the conference again.\n\nBill enlisted in the Navy Jan. 14, 1943. Bill said once, “Join the Navy and see the world, thousands of dollars wouldn’t pay for all the places I’ve been.” Bill was assigned to the #48 USS Dobler, a brand-new ship whose purpose was to be a Destroyer Escort. Bill traveled across and back over the Atlantic Ocean twenty times. Bill’s job was on a deck gun, he was the 1st loader. There were four shells at a time, the job required a tall person, and Bill stood at 6ft 1 and a half. Bill finished his service with the title, Boatman’s Mate 1st Class. When the war ended with Germany, Bill still had four years left to serve.\n\nBill was then sent to US Navy Camp 815 located in Terceira, Azores, a Providence of Portugal. Bill and four others were to replace eighty sailors that had been running the docks. Bill was in charge of it all, the four other sailors and the Portuguese hired to help. It was here that Bill met his bride, Maria Gorgita through her dad who was a Port Captain. During their courtship, they would sight see and go to the beach a lot. They would often be found spending a whole day tooling a cabin boat around the island.\n\nThe base was shut down in December of 1946, but, because Bill still had two years left to serve, he was to fly to Exeter, England, to get new orders. This became a very long adventure where Bill saw a lot of Europe. During this time, word came around that the Navy would let you out on request if you served four of a six-year contract. Bill was discharged in February of 1947.\n\nBill and Maria returned to KC and had a courthouse wedding June 12, 1947. Bill and Maria had five children which they resided with in the Kansas City, Hickman Mills and Grandview areas. After returning from the service, Bill worked as a Union Commercial Carpenter at the Sugar Creek Oil Refinery. Bill also did carpentry work with his father on and off. Next, Bill worked doing light commercial construction as a superintendent. While employed there he put footings in for the Western Auto sign downtown. Bill eventually gave up commercial construction and decided to go into residential housing. Bill worked in this capacity for forty years as a superintendent building houses. Finally working for his son, Bill Jr. for two years before retiring in 1990.\n\nMaria suffered from poor health the majority of her life in the US. She lived to celebrate their 56th wedding anniversary and then died in Sept. of 2003. After Maria’s death, Bill busied himself at Bill Jr’s farm, where Bill cared for the cattle, helped with the haying and did farm maintenance. Bill loved listening/watching baseball and football. He was a sports nut and a KC fan to the core. He liked to travel, always the driver. In his later years, he spent time reconnecting with family and researching his roots. Bill loved his family, he traveled countless miles to visit with many of them.\n\nBill passed away February 21, 2022.\n\nScholarships associated with Bill Winters\n\nBill Winters Scholarship\n\nBob & Mary Bohlken\n\nDr. Bob & Mary Bohlken were married in 1958.

Born to mothers who were both teachers, Bobby and Shirley graduated in 1953 and 1952, respectively. They served in teaching and administrative capacities in the northwest Missouri communities of Gallatin, Hamilton, Stanberry, Graham, Maitland, Skidmore, Maysville, Clarksdale, Hopkins, and Pickering. As a school administrator for 34 years, Bobby took time to get to know the unique needs of the students, faculty, and community members. He was always willing to go the “extra mile” in helping people start or continue their careers, referring many of them to NWMSU, confident they would receive a quality education. His belief in the educational quality of his alma mater was demonstrated by the number of NWMSU graduates he hired to teach in school districts under his direction. Shirley touched the lives of several hundred students during six years teaching home economics and 21 years teaching various elementary grades. She served as a mentor for numerous student teachers from NWMSU and welcomed hundreds of observation students into her classroom. In honoring their parents with the scholarship, the Kelley’s children also honored Northwest Missouri State University, which during the late 1940s and early 1950s became Bobby’s and Shirley’s “home away from home” and helped them form the foundation of their professional lives.\n\nScholarships associated with Bobby & Shirley Kelley\n\nBobby & Shirley Kelley Excellence in Education Award\n\nBohlken\n\nScholarships associated with Bohlken\n\nBohlken English Education Scholarship\n\nBonnie Magill\n\nThe Bonnie Magill Scholarship honors former women’s physical education department chairman Bonnie Magill.

Now, after that passion led her on a life-changing music mission to Africa, Houts hopes her monetary gift will enable international students to receive the education they need to make a difference in their home countries.\n\nThrough the Northwest Foundation, Houts recently established The Carolyn Houts International Student Scholarship. The scholarship will be awarded to international students attending Northwest, with first preference given to students from Africa. The scholarship will be awarded to a student who exemplifies positive contributions to Northwest, through campus involvement, solid academic performance and leadership.\n\nA 1964 Northwest graduate, Houts grew up in northwest Missouri and attended Northwest to major in music education. As a student, she was involved in several music and Christian organizations, including the Baptist Student Union where she was a pianist for the choir, the student branch of the Music Educators National Conference, the Student Christian Association and Tower Choir.\n\nAfter graduating from Northwest, Houts went on to receive her master’s in music education and taught for several years before attending the Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, where she earned her master’s of religious education and master’s of church music.\n\nUpon leaving the seminary, Houts accepted an opportunity to go to Ghana in western Africa, through the Foreign Mission Board. That opportunity became a 35-year career for Houts.\n\n“I felt God calling me to overseas service, and I first had those impressions when I was in school at Northwest,” Houts said. “So I taught school, gained experiences and reached a point where I was willing to go.”\n\nHer first assignment in Ghana was to study the language of Twi, the county’s principal native language. After becoming fluent, she edited a Twi hymnal, and more recently she worked with interpreters to help church members make scripture songs in seven other African languages.\n\nIn 2006, Houts worked with a committee to develop a diploma in church music program through Ghana Baptist University. She led the choir, gave music lessons and taught classes.\n\nHouts also enlisted the help of her former band director and mentor at Northwest, Ward Rounds, who maintained an instrument repair shop at his home. During her return trips to the United States, Houts often brought donated instruments for Rounds to repair and then took the refurbished instruments back to Ghana.\n\nAlthough Houts returned to the United States from time to time to speak at churches about her experiences, she returned to Missouri as a full-time resident in July 2010 and lived in Grant City in northwest Missouri.\n\nMs. Carolyn Houts passed away in April of 2019.\n\nScholarships associated with Carolyn Houts\n\nCarolyn Houts International Student Scholarship\n\nCarrick-Lee\n\nLife experiences have helped shape Don and Stacy Carrick’s interests in education, and so has their strong connection to Northwest. Because of those experiences, the couple has established a scholarship to assist future students who are interested in furthering their education at Northwest.\n\nThe Carrick-Lee Scholarship provides assistance to Northwest students who are considered “caught in the middle.” Recipients must be enrolled full-time and will be chosen based on Northwest admissions and financial assistance policies and standards, with academic achievement and financial need as leading criteria. It is named in honor of the Carricks as well as Stacy’s mother, Joyce Lee, and in memory of her father, Wayne Lee.\n\nStacy, a 1988 Northwest graduate, earned her bachelor’s degree in accounting while minoring in computer science. Her husband, Don, was employed by Energizer Battery and transferred to its Maryville plant from Cleveland in 1974. While Don did not attend Northwest, he, too, feels a strong connection to the University, and both of his children, Don and Kim, are Northwest graduates.\n\nStacy’s parents impressed upon her the importance of education while she was in her youth. While the Lee family lived in Maryville, Stacy’s mother began pursuing her elementary education degree at Northwest. Later, the family moved to Bethany, and Stacy watched her mother commute to Northwest to finish her degree. Stacy’s father enlisted in the military and was unable to attend college but encouraged her to earn a college degree. He instilled the importance of a dedicated work ethic, which Stacy saw him model as vice president of operations for the P.M. Place Company.\n\nAs a student at Northwest, Stacy was involved in Cardinal Key and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. She also worked in the president’s office, was an Alpha Kappa Lambda “little sis” and volunteered to assist individuals with their income taxes through the University VITA program. She worked with former Northwest administrator Dr. Bob Bush, and she was the student selected to give then-Governor John Ashcroft a demonstration of Northwest’s computer network when the University switched on the Electronic Campus in 1987.\n\nAfter graduating from Northwest, Stacy accepted her first job at KPMG Peat Marwick in Florida. She later served in a variety of capacities for Heartland Health in St. Joseph before returning to Northwest in 2010 to become the University’s vice president of finance.\n\nBased on their own experiences, the Carricks established the Carrick-Lee Scholarship with “caught-in-the-middle” students in mind.\n\nScholarships associated with Carrick-Lee\n\nCarrick-Lee Scholarship\n\nCatherine Masters Soroptimist\n\nScholarships associated with Catherine Masters Soroptimist\n\nCatherine Masters Soroptimist Venture Memorial Scholarship\n\nCathran Cushman\n\nCathran Cushman Scholarship was established in December, 1975, by KXCV-KDLX.\n\nScholarships associated with Cathran Cushman\n\nCathran Cushman Scholarship\n\nCBIZ\n\nScholarships associated with CBIZ\n\nCBIZ Bearcat Builder Scholarship\n\nCelebrate Ag Day\n\nScholarships associated with Celebrate Ag Day\n\nCelebrate Ag Day Scholarship\n\nCentral Iowa Alumni Chapter\n\nScholarships associated with Central Iowa Alumni Chapter\n\nCentral Iowa Alumni Chapter Scholarship\n\nCenturyLink\n\nScholarships associated with CenturyLink\n\nCenturyLink Scholarship\n\nCharles B & Venita Jean Green\n\nNorthwest Missouri State University received a $525,000 gift from the estate of Charles and Jean Green. The couple's gift through the Northwest Foundation created the Charles B. and Venita Jean Green Scholarship.\n\nThrough their bequest, the Greens have ensured that Northwest students can follow a path similar to the one that connected each of them during their college years in northeast Missouri. Charles was born on a farm near Downing, Mo., and farmed most of his life in Scotland and Schuyler counties. In addition, he was a distinguished World War II veteran, serving in the U.S. Army from 1942 to 1945 and receiving many honors, including the Bronze Star Medal. After the couple married in 1970, the Greens lived near Downing before moving to the Memphis area. Jean, who grew up on a farm near Memphis, Mo., was an elementary school teacher in Keokuk and a farmer's wife. Jean died in 2004, and Charles died five years later.\n\nThe couple's strong ties to northeast Missouri are reflected in their scholarship, which is designed to benefit students who graduate from public schools in Scotland and Schuyler counties and choose to attend Northwest. In addition, the Charles B. and Venita Jean Green Scholarship aims to help serious students who might not otherwise be able to afford the opportunity to pursue their education at Northwest.\n\nScholarships associated with Charles B & Venita Jean Green\n\nCharles B & Venita Jean Green Scholarship\n\nCharles Hawkins\n\nDr. Charles Ernest Hawkins was born July 25, 1933, in Cochran, Ga. to Minor and Amanda (Shedd) Hawkins. A veteran, he was retired from the United States Navy.\n\nCharles married Jacqueline Margaret Barrington on Sept. 21, 1956, in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nHe received his BS in accounting and MS in business administration from Memphis State University and his PhD in business from the University of Nebraska. He was a professor of Accounting at Northwest Missouri State University and retired in 1993.

He was an astute businessman and in retirement dedicated his life to philanthropy, including serving as the former president of the Northwest Foundation.\n\nPlace, the 2003 recipient of the Northwest Alumni Association Turret Award, was president of Place’s Discount Stores until his retirement in 2000. Previously, he was a CPA with McGladrey and Pullen. In addition to his service to the Northwest Foundation Board of Directors, he served on numerous boards, including the Northwest Medical Center, Friends of the Carnegie Public Library, The Abbot’s Financial Council of Conception Abbey, Hundley-Whaley Research Farm Advisers, Printery House Advisory Group, Northwest Missouri Enterprise Facilitation and Sparks of Hope.\n\nTo preserve his legacy and to continue to give back to their alma mater, Place’s family established the Charles M. Place Memorial Scholarship through the Northwest Foundation. Place was an accounting major at Northwest, so his family thought it was fitting to establish the scholarship for Northwest students majoring in accounting, economics or finance. Preference will be given to students from Place’s hometown of Albany. Applicants must also demonstrate leadership in campus organizations as well as financial need.\n\nScholarships associated with Charles M Place\n\nCharles M Place Memorial Scholarship\n\nCharles R Derstler\n\nThe Charles R. Derstler Scholarship funds up to 30 credit hours per academic year. Eligible students must be a sophomore, junior or senior at Northwest and must have graduated from a Missouri high school in Caldwell or Ray counties, with first preference given to students pursuing an agricultural field of study.\n\nCharles began attending Northwest in 1941 on the National Youth Administration program, and in 1942 he entered the U.S. Navy. After his military service, he returned to Northwest and completed a degree in business and industrial arts in 1949.\n\nCharles began purchasing and selling farm property during the early 1950s, and farmed and raised cattle in rural Cameron; he died in 2011. LaVon earned an associate degree at Maple Woods Community College in Kansas City. Now retired, LaVon had been employed by the Amoco Oil Company for 28 years.\n\nThe Charles R. Derstler Scholarship was made possible through gift annuities the Derstlers purchased from the Northwest Foundation as well as proceeds they gifted from the sales of their properties.\n\nScholarships associated with Charles R Derstler\n\nCharles R Derstler Scholarship\n\nChauncey M Saville\n\nC M & M Saville Scholarship, named after siblings Chauncey, Mayhew and Mahala Saville, was established on March 20, 1980 by the former Normal School student, Mr. Chauncey Saville.

We were all recent grads and knew first-hand how tight finances could be in school. Our employer provided 2:1 matching funds so we started off with a better initial fund than we could have done individually. The four scholarship founders were Timothy Ely, Jana (Florea) Krottinger, Mark Huff and Kevin Carpenter.\n\nScholarships associated with Chemistry Alumni\n\nChemistry Alumni Scholarship\n\nChimbel Family\n\nThe Chimbel Family Scholarship honors Joseph and LaVonne (Long) Chimbel, who met at Northwest Missouri State University in the late 1960s, married in 1971 and both graduated in the early 1970s before embarking on careers in sales and human resources, respectively. They were both first-generation college students who studied psychology and sociology. LaVonne Chimbel died in 2010. The gift was established by their son, Aaron, and daughter-in-law, Bethanne, in 2021.\n\nScholarships associated with Chimbel Family\n\nChimbel Family Scholarship\n\nChip Strong\n\nAs a fan of Bearcat athletics, the late Frank \"Chip\" Strong, Jr. '73 loved watching and supporting the men's basketball team. But even more important to Strong than how many conference championships the Bearcats had was how many young men walked across the stage at graduation. Strong's main concern was that once student-athletes completed their eligibility, they stay in school and earn a degree.\n\nStrong's family and friends have taken action to help this vision become a reality for former student-athletes when it otherwise may not be an option. Upon Strong's death in October 2006, his daughter Allison Strong Hoffman '01, '03, and long-time friend and business partner, Dr. John Baker, established the Chip Strong Memorial Scholarship to assist men's basketball players who have not yet completed their degrees but have used all of their athletic eligibility.\n\nStrong's affiliation with Northwest ran much deeper than being an avid sports fan. His first encounter with Northwest came when he was a student at Horace Mann Laboratory School, which he attended through seventh grade. After graduating from Maryville High School in 1969, he spent a year at the University of Missouri - Columbia before transferring to Northwest, earning a bachelor's degree with honors in 1973. He became an attorney in Maryville and served Northwest in several capacities, including being president of the Bearcat Booster Club, vice president of the Northwest's Board of Regents and a member of the Northwest Foundation Board of Directors.\n\nScholarships associated with Chip Strong\n\nChip Strong Memorial Scholarship\n\nChloe Millikan\n\nMiss Chloe Millikan was a member of the faculty in Childhood Education at Northwest Missouri State for 33 years prior to her retirement in 1961.\n\nMiss Millikan came to Northwest in 1928 after several years of teaching and supervision in the public schools of Missouri and two years as director of early childhood education at the Teachers College, Kansas City, Mo. She received her BS at Central Missouri State College, Warrensburg, and her masters degree from Columbia University in New York. She also did graduate work at Columbia, the University of Chicago and Stanford University.\n\nWhile at Northwest, Miss Millikan, helped organize a professional organization for students planning to teach in the area of early childhood education. This organization, originally called the Primary Council, evolved into the Association of Childhood Education International in 1931.\n\nMiss Millikan served as a state president of the American Association of University Women and was on numerous national committees in her field. She was also a member of Kappa Delta Pi, national education fraternity, and was one of the original Missouri state members of Delta Kappa Gamma, national sorority for outstanding women.\n\nScholarships associated with Chloe Millikan\n\nChloe Millikan Memorial Scholarship\n\nCindy Wolfe\n\nCindy Wolfe, a 1988 graduate of Northwest, established this endowed scholarship, the Cindy Wolfe Education Scholarship, which is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors who are enrolled full-time at Northwest and have declared a major in education. Recipients also must be from Iowa, Kansas or Nebraska and have a GPA between 2.75 and 3.5.\n\nThis scholarship will assist students who have a passion for entering the education field and may not benefit from the financial assistance awarded to first-year students, particularly those who come from surrounding states.\n\n“I wanted to give back to Northwest because I felt like I got an excellent education there and, being from a small town in Kansas, I wanted to find something for students in states around Missouri to encourage them,” Wolfe said.\n\nA native of Hiawatha, Kansas, Wolfe was attracted to Northwest for its education programming, which prepares students to become effective teachers and leaders in pre-kindergarten through grade 12. The Northwest School of Education’s nationally-accredited programs are founded on innovative, profession-based clinical experiences in diverse school settings.\n\nIn addition to playing with the Bearcat softball team for three years, Wolfe focused on preparing herself to become a secondary education teacher with specializations in physical education and mathematics.\n\nAfter completing her bachelor’s degree at Northwest, Wolfe taught a variety of age groups during a career of nearly 20 years in Missouri and Texas. Her career spanned teaching elementary physical education to teaching senior citizens while she coordinated a college intramural program, in addition to substitute teaching.\n\n“It totally prepared me,” she said as she reflected on the education she received at Northwest. “Even before we did student teaching, we were out in the classroom quite a bit. It prepared you for what was going to go on in the classroom.”\n\nNow retired from teaching, Wolfe’s advice for students entering the field is to stick with what they enjoy doing.\n\nScholarships associated with Cindy Wolfe\n\nCindy Wolfe Education Scholarship\n\nClara B Chick\n\nScholarships associated with Clara B Chick\n\nClara B Chick Scholarship\n\nClarence & Dorothy A Bush\n\nScholarships associated with Clarence & Dorothy A Bush\n\nClarence & Dorothy A Bush Scholarship\n\nClarence Henderson\n\nClarence Henderson Scholarship was funded at the time of the death of the former history department member.

Dale’s family and friends felt that a scholarship at Northwest Missouri State University to financially help worthy students seeking a teaching degree in the area of English, Journalism or Philosophy was an appropriate way to remember Dale and his interest for acquiring and sharing knowledge through his studying and teaching in those particular areas.\n\nDale was a native Missourian who lived in Maryville and obtained most of his schooling in Maryville. He was born at St. Francis Hospital in Maryville on March 29, 1947 and continued to live in Maryville until after completing his undergraduate degree at NWMSC (now NWMSU) in May, 1969. He had a keen interest in many areas during his school years but showed special interest in the areas of English, Journalism and Philosophy while attending high school and college. Dale graduated in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in English and minoring in Philosophy. Upon completion of his undergraduate work at Northwest, Dale accepted an assistantship at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming so he could work on his master’s degree. Through his assistantship teaching experience, Dale discovered his gift and interest in being a teacher so he applied for and accepted a teaching position in the English department at Southeastern Iowa Community College in Burlington, Iowa in 1970. Since Dale did not have a teaching degree, he was required to go back to school and take some education courses so he could teach, but he decided that he really enjoyed teaching and wanted to pursue that profession so he took further classes to be certified for teaching in Iowa. He became head of the English department during his 11 ½ years at the junior college where he taught until his death from a massive heart attack in February 1982.\n\nScholarships associated with Dale Gorsuch\n\nDale Gorsuch Memorial Scholarship\n\nDallas Alumni Chapter\n\nScholarships associated with Dallas Alumni Chapter\n\nDallas Alumni Chapter Scholarship\n\nDan Smith\n\nThis scholarship was established to honor the service of Dan Smith to Northwest.

Dawson Scholarship, was funded August, 1976, by former regent W. M. C. Dawson and his wife, Inez. Close friends with Robert and Virginia Foster, the Dawsons realized the importance of helping Northwest students finance their education.\n\nDawson, owner and president of the Citizens Bank of Grant City, which was started by his father in 1881, passed away in 1987, but his legacy lives on today through the Scholarship. Because he began working in the family bank at age 16, Dawson was never able to attend college, and throughout his life he stressed the importance of higher education.\n\nToday, the University works with Jennifer Dawson-Nicholson '71, owner of Nicholson Meyer Capital Management in Kansas City, whose contributions built up the original scholarship fund in honor of her grandfather, W. M. C. Dawson, and his service to the University as a member of the Board of Regents from 1951 to 1975. The fund will be renamed the Dawson Nicholson Family Scholarship in tribute to the Dawson family’s longtime connection with the University as well as Jennifer D. Nicholson’s contributions as a member of the Northwest Foundation Board of Directors from 2011 to 2022, including her term as Board Chair from 2018-2020.\n\nRecipients of the Dawson Nicholson Family Scholarship shall have graduated from Worth County High School in Grant City, Missouri and shall maintain enrollment to be considered as full-time students by the University. Financial need and academic achievement shall be the leading criteria in awarding the scholarship.\n\nScholarships associated with Dawson Nicholson Family\n\nDawson Nicholson Family Scholarship\n\nDean E.
