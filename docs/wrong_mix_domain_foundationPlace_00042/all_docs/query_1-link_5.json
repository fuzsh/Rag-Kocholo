We believe an engaged community is one in which people are attached to the place where they live and are invested in the community’s future. Learn more through our Statement of Strategy.\n\nIn Detroit, Knight Foundation’s work is focused on the Historic North End, which is experiencing significant private and commercial investment. Leveraging the momentum around economic growth, we envision the North End as an equitable, thriving and connected residential and commercial corridor. Our investments focus on:\n\nCatalyzing commercial development centered on the fundamental needs of the North End.\n\nCreation and reimagining of innovative and sustainable public spaces that strengthen neighborhood cohesion.\n\nDevelopment and implementation of a comprehensive North End framework plan.\n\nKnight also invests in Detroit’s arts and culture as a way to connect people to place and to one another. Investing in arts and culture is central to Knight’s effort to build stronger, better informed and more engaged communities, which are critical for a more effective democracy. Learn more about Knight’s Arts program.\n\nOUR WORK\n\nWe work with various partners, including Develop Detroit, North End Woodward Community Coalition and Vanguard Community Development Corporation, in building a thriving and engaged community in the North End.\n\nIn 2014, Knight made a $30 million commitment to Detroit’s future by way of the Detroit Institute of Arts Settlement, commonly referred to as the “Grand Bargain,” which helps the city honor its commitment to hardworking retirees and preserves a key civic asset that contributes to the city’s vibrancy and supports the local economy.\n\nDetroit Program Staff\n\nDirector/Detroit\n\nDetroit Community Advisory Committee Members:\n\nDennis Archer, Ignition Media Group; Peter Cummings, Platform Group; James Feagin, Feagin Media Group; Dan Kinkead, SmithGroup; Anelia Kuzon, Ford Mobility\n\nKnight’s Detroit Office:\n\n2937 E.
