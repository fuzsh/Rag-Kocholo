His parents, who had emigrated from India, were devoted to Raj receiving a quality education, and instilled in him their belief that a good education was the way up and out of poverty. Â Raj attended Princeton University, from which he received a degree in Molecular Biology, as well as certificate of studies from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy. Â Raj's first job after college was as a management consultant with Mercer Management Consulting. However, Raj's training as a scientist continued to shape his world view. Â After a conversation with friends about the challenges of educating urban, at-risk students, Raj developed a scientific hypothesis: that underserved children, when provided with a 24-hour, supportive, academically-rigorous environment, could achieve scholastic success. Soon after, Raj met a management consultant from a competing company, Eric Adler, who also had visions of a college preparatory boarding school for urban youth. Together, they founded The SEED Foundation and opened The SEED School in Washington, D.C. in 1998, which now serves 330 students in grades 6-12.\n\nToday, there are three SEED schools in the nation â the SEED school in D.C., now seventeen years old, The SEED School of Maryland, which opened in 2008 and graduated its first cohort of high school graduates going to college, and The SEED School of Miami, which opened in August 2014. To date, over 90 percent of SEED graduates have enrolled in college, and they earn bachelor's degrees at 4.5 times the rate of our nation's lowest income students. For their work at The SEED Foundation, Raj and Eric have been named Washingtonian of the Year by Washingtonian magazine, are recipients of the Manhattan Institute's Social Entrepreneurship Award, and are recipients of Oprah Winfrey's \"Use Your Life\" Award.\n\nIn addition to his role at the Aspen Institute, Raj is a board director for a public company, Colfax Corporation (NYSE: CFX).

Ms. Walton succeeded SCOPE's founder, legendary community organizer Anthony Thigpenn.\n\nUnder Ms. Walton's leadership, SCOPE played a pivotal role in several significant recent campaigns including serving as an anchor organization in the winning statewide alliances to pass California's Prop 30 which generated $9 billion in revenue for education and social services and Prop 47 which reclassified certain nonviolent felonies to misdemeanors, reversing decades of investment in prisons and redirecting resources to treatment. These unlikely victories were won thanks to SCOPE's model of \"integrated voter engagement\" which combines sustained organizing that pushes for power from the outside and engagement of new and occasional low-income voters to build strong voting blocs.\n\nMs. Walton also led the organizing effort for SCOPE's green jobs programs. SCOPE pioneered a replicable model that couples entry level positions with job training to create career pathways into good, green jobs, targeted for workers in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nMs. Walton is a recent recipient of a James Irvine Foundation Fund for Leadership Advancement grant and was named one of Liberty Hill Foundation's Leaders to Watch in 2011.\n\nShe currently serves on the Board of Directors of California Calls, the Coordinating Committee of the Black Worker Center, and is a Founding Advisory Board member of a national collaborative known as BOLD (Black Organizing for Leadership & Dignity).
