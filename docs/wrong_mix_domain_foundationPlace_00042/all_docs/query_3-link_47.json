        "text": "Jim was a Mighty Cadet at Christian Brothers College High School before attending the University of Central Missouri. He received a Bachelor of Science degree and ventured into the audiovisual business in 1997. His introduction to computers began with his first laptop “as big as a truck.” Color Art was Jim’s client in St. Louis, and he developed a relationship with Joe Steiner, the CEO. Jim says, “I’ll never forget coming to the office on a Saturday morning and presenting the business plan. Joe didn’t hesitate. Right on the spot, he said to go for it.” In 2001, Jim and two business partners founded what is now known as Color Art Technology (formerly Innovative Technology Group), and he now serves as the President."
