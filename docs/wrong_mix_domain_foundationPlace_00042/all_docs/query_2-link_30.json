We host Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia, created, edited, and verified by volunteers around the world, as well as many other vital community projects. All of which is made possible thanks to donations from individuals like you. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in collecting and sharing knowledge that fully represents human diversity.\n\nProtect and sustain Wikipedia\n\nDonations are secure\n\n1\n\nWikimedia projects belong to everyone\n\nYou made it. It is yours to use. For free. That means you can use it, adapt it, or share what you find on Wikimedia sites. Just do not write your own bio, or copy/paste it into your homework.\n\n2\n\nWe respect your data and privacy\n\nWe do not sell your email address or any of your personal information to third parties. More information about our privacy practices are available at the Wikimedia Foundation privacy policy, donor privacy policy, and data retention guidelines.\n\n3\n\nPeople like you keep Wikipedia accurate\n\nReaders verify the facts. Articles are collaboratively created and edited by a community of volunteers using reliable sources, so no single person or company owns a Wikipedia article. The Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit, but you and everyone you know can help.\n\n4\n\nNot all wikis are Wikimedia\n\nThe word “wiki” refers to a website built using collaborative editing software. Projects with no past or existing affiliation with Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation, such as Wikileaks and wikiHow, also use the term. Although these sites also use “wiki” in their name, they have nothing to do with Wikimedia.\n\n280,000+\n\neditors contribute to Wikimedia projects every month\n\nShare on X\n\n100+ million\n\nmedia files on Wikimedia Commons and counting\n\nShare on X\n\n1.5 billion\n\nunique devices access Wikimedia projects every month\n\nShare on X\n\nResearch\n\nWe conduct our own research and partner with researchers worldwide to address change in society and technology.\n\nMore about research\n\nTechnology\n\nFrom site reliability to machine learning, our open-source technology makes Wikipedia faster, more reliable, and more accessible worldwide.\n\nMore about technology\n\nAdvocacy\n\nWe fight to protect everyone’s right to access free and open knowledge.\n\nMore about advocacy\n\nCollaborative projects are the core of the Wikimedia movement\n\nOur volunteers build tools, share photos, write articles, and are working to connect all the knowledge that exists.\n\nWikipedia\n\nFree encyclopedia written in over 300 languages by volunteers around the world.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nThe world’s largest free-to-use-library of illustrations, photos, drawings, videos and music.\n\nSee what we have been up to\n\nWikimedia Foundation’s Accreditation to World Intellectual Property Organization Blocked for a Fourth Time by China\n\nYesterday, the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts and supports Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, was again denied accreditation as a permanent observer to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\n\nRead more\n\nWikimedia Foundation statement on volunteer processes on reliable sources\n\nThere has been recent media coverage regarding a decision by Wikipedia’s volunteer community on the reliability of the Anti-Defamation League as an encyclopedic source in specific subject areas. In an effort to promote better understanding of how Wikipedia works, the Wikimedia Foundation has issued a statement.\n\nRead more\n\nWikimedians are heroes of free knowledge\n\nArminé Aghayan\n\nEditor since 2013, Wikimedia community\n\nMay Hachem\n\nEditor since 2013, Wikimedia community\n\nEmily Temple-Wood\n\nEditor since 2007, Wikimedia community\n\nThroughout history, knowledge has been controlled by a powerful few. Wikipedia needs knowledge from all languages and cultures. The internet has become the default for accessing information—women, people of color, and the global south remain underrepresented. We invite you to help correct history.\n\nHelp us unlock the world’s knowledge.\n\nAs a nonprofit, Wikipedia and our related free knowledge projects are powered primarily through donations.\n\nDonate now"
