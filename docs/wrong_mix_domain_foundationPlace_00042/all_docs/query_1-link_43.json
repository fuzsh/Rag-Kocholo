He looked forward to a time when, “knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”\n\nFrom its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to civic virtue and harmony."
