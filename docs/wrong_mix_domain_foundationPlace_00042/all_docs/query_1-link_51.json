If I am not being productive artistically, I am not leaving an imprint of my existence. I enjoy the arts process immensely and IAIA has helped further my work.”\n\n“It was the hands-on classes, supportive staff, internships, and gallery preparation experiences that were most beneficial to me. After I graduate, I plan to use my knowledge and experience within my community and career.”"
