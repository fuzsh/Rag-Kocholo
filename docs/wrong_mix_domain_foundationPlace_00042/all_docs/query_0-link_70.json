        "text": "WELCOME\n\nFrom the Partnership President\n\nIt is my pleasure to present Partnership Lake Houston’s 2023 Community Guide and Directory.

This is a thriving, vibrant community. Partnership Lake Houston is diligently working to continue building on our incredible foundation as a great place to work, live, play and flourish.\n\nWe focus the efforts of Partnership Lake Houston on developing a healthy economic climate for our businesses, whether it’s through attraction of new businesses, business retention, business expansion, small business development, advocating for the public infrastructure or addressing issues that affect our economy.

We encourage you to support the many Partnership member firms in this guide. Feel free to contact us, if you have any questions or need additional information, about the Lake Houston Area or our organization.\n\nKyle Sheldon\n\nPresident/CEO\n\nPartnership Lake Houston\n\nFrom the Board Chair\n\nOn behalf of the Partnership Lake Houston Board of Directors, staff and our 1,000 member businesses, welcome home.\n\nThe Lake Houston area is the hub for northeast Harris County, providing an unbeatable combination of location, economic opportunity, cultural diversity, accessibility to quality healthcare and education, and several of the most popular residential neighborhoods in the Houston market. Whether you are just passing through, new to the region, or have been a life-long resident, Partnership Lake Houston is here to serve you by bringing local businesses, the global economy and our community together.\n\nAs Partnership Lake Houston celebrates its 100th Anniversary as the pre-eminent business and civic organization in the area, it truly is an exciting time to be in Lake Houston. After several years of uncertainty and challenges, we as an organization and community have emerged on the other side stronger and better positioned to tackle the next 100 years. I invite you to check out any one of our numerous networking, educational or signature events and see for yourself the value in all that the Partnership has to offer including one-on-one support and engagement, promotion of local businesses of every size and advocacy for issues impacting you and your business.\n\nI am proud to call this place home. Inside these pages, you’ll see the reason why with many of the people, places and businesses that make our community great. We’ve come a long way over the past 100 years – but in all reality, we’re just getting started.\n\nJason Stuebe\n\nChairman of the Board\n\nAREA OVERVIEW\n\nThe Lake Houston Area’s proximity to the Gulf of Mexico provides mild to warm temperatures year-round, making the area the perfect place for outdoor living. Annually, the average high is 78°F and the average low is 60°F. The coldest month of the year is January, and the hottest month is August. The wettest month is June with an average of 11.3 days with at least 0.04 inches of precipitation.\n\nThe Lake Houston Area is in the northeast quadrant of the Houston Metropolitan area, just 20 miles north of Downtown Houston on Interstate 69. It includes Atascocita, Walden, Eagle Springs, The Groves, and Lake Shore; the City of Humble; Kingwood; Generation Park; Summer Creek, comprised of Summerwood and Fall Creek; and portions of East Montgomery County, including Oakhurst, Porter, New Caney, and Valley Ranch. These areas are currently experiencing robust population and economic growth.\n\nThe area encompasses approximately 100 square miles of land in northeast Harris County and is mostly forested. The region has proven to be a strong attraction to newcomers due to its natural beauty, the recreational opportunities of Lake Houston and the San Jacinto River, the proximity of Bush Intercontinental Airport and the Port of Houston and the quality of its many subdivisions. Abundant health care and exemplary schools add to the appeal, while developments such as Generation Park with HTX Surf expected opening Fall 2024 and a Biotechnology center set to launch in 2024; high-tech distribution center planned by IKEA; Life Science hub, entertainment, trails, and park projects are a few of the newest additions to Generation Park. Travel a bit further North and you will find Valley Ranch, and Grand Texas Theme Park ensuring the Lake Houston Area will continue to prosper for years to come.\n\nEleven lanes of Interstate 69 flow to and from Downtown Houston, including one HOV lane for multi-passenger vehicles. The Sam Houston Tollway allows motorists to quickly travel 13 miles from I-69 near George Bush Intercontinental Airport to just past US 90. The Grand Parkway, which spans east to west to connect I-45 and I-69. This 180-mile circumferential highway traverses seven counties in the Greater Houston area and is divided into 11 segments designated A through I-2 with segments D-I-2B already completed and open to traffic. Park and Ride lots at Townsend Boulevard in Humble and Lake Houston Parkway in Kingwood allow commuters to Downtown Houston and The Medical Center to park their cars and commute to their place of work comfortably in a Metro bus. As construction of the Grand Parkway continues as the fourth and largest loop around Houston, the Lake Houston Area will enjoy more connectivity to the city’s major thoroughfares and added mobility for our growing communities. Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston’s primary airport is just five minutes from Humble. Rail service runs through the Lake Houston Area linking the region to the Port of Houston and Galveston.\n\nDuring the past several years, the Lake Houston Area has experienced an uptick in commercial developments. The region is an ever-widening district of prosperous commerce and multi-community growth and has become the cornerstone of Northeast Houston.\n\nThe 2022 population of the Lake Houston Area was 294,414, up from a 2010 Census count of 225,357. The 2026 projection for population is 324,636, representing an increase of 1.9% annually from 2022-2026. Currently, the population is 49.6% male and 50.4% female. The median age of the LHA is 34.4 compared to the U.S. median age of 38.1. It is estimated that 11.8% of the population age 25 and over in this area had earned a Master’s, Professional or Doctorate Degree and 24% had earned a bachelor’s degree. In comparison, for the United States, it is estimated 12.3% of the population over 25 had earned a Master’s, Professional or Doctorate Degree, while 21.2% had earned a bachelor’s degree.\n\nThe household count in this area has increased from 76,382 in 2010 to 98,403 in the current year, a change of 1.7% annually. The 2026 projection of households is 108,000 a change 1.0% annually from the current year total.\n\nIn 2022, 69.9% of the 98,403 housing units in the area are owner occupied; 25.1% are renter occupied and 5% are vacant. In the United States, 54% of the housing units are owner occupied; 36% are renter occupied and 8.6% are vacant. In 2010, there were 81,971 housing units in the area; 88% were owner occupied, 25.2% renter occupied and 6.8% vacant. The annual rate of change in housing units since 2010 is 2.46%. Median home value of owner-occupied units in the area is $243,209, compared to a median home value of $203,378 for the U.S. The average worker in the Lake Houston Area earned annual wages of $54,894 as of 2022Q1. Average annual wages per worker increased 2.2% in the region over the preceding four quarters. For comparison purposes, annual average wages were $64,121 in the nation as of 2022Q2. The cost of living is 7.1% lower in the Lake Houston Area than the U.S. average.\n\nEconomic Development\n\nThe Partnership Lake Houston area is home to one of the fastest growing sections of the Houston Metro. Covering seven zip codes (77044, 77338, 77339, 77335, 77345, 77346 and 77369), what began as a small community located near the San Jacinto River has blossomed into an ever-widening area of prosperous commerce and multi-community growth. With over 300,000 residents, a talented workforce, as well as top rated education (Humble ISD, Lone Star and San Jacinto Junior Colleges), our access to major freeways and proximity to IAH, the Port of Houston and the world’s largest medical center make our area appealing to commercial developers and sites selectors.\n\nEntertainment is plentiful in the Partnership Lake Houston area. With the recreation of Lake Houston and the San Jacinto River, beautiful golf courses and various parks, outdoor enthusiasts can find plenty to keep them busy. The Partnership Lake Houston area is also a popular destination for endless hours of indoor entertainment and great dining.\n\nThe Partnership Lake Houston (PLH) works to entice industrial and commercial companies to the area, along with expanding existing businesses. That means high-quality jobs for our residents and development of a true live, work and play community.\n\nThis past year, the Lake Houston area has seen an uptick in Life Sciences projects, largely due to the development of the Life Sciences Manufacturing Campus and a Biotech Training Center at Generation Park. Generation Park is a 4,300-acre master-planned environment unlike any other with the clear and simple goal of driving business performance for their clients. McCord Development took this a step further with the development of BioHub Two, a 45-acre master-planned biomanufacturing campus with for sale and for lease built-to-suite biomanufacturing, lab and office space in Generation Park. This campus offers multiple site configurations, providing flexibility for operations of all sizes.\n\nBioHub Two is adjacent to the Nimble BioSpaces facility and NIBRT/San Jacinto College Biotech Training Center. NIBRT, the world’s premier life science manufacturing workforce training institute, is partnering with San Jacinto College to open a Biotech Training Center at Generation Park. The Global Partners Center will be the only facility of its kind for the southern and southwestern United States and will feature a state-of-the-art bioprocessing pilot plant operated in a realistic GMP simulated and operational manufacturing environment.\n\nWith world-leading research and development and access to the growing, untapped life sciences workforce, Houston is an ideal location for biomanufacturing. The combination of over 700 life science companies and the logistical benefits of being in the center of the country for easy access make Houston the strategic choice. With partners like McCord Development and San Jacinto college, the Lake Houston area has defined itself as one of five regions within the Houston footprint that have a life sciences presence and is ready to compete.\n\nTop Ten Employers in the\n\nLake Houston Area\n\nBusiness Name Type Employees Houston Airport System Aviation/Airport 20,750+ Humble Independent School District Education 8,300+ Deerbrook Mall Retail HCA Houston Healthcare Kingwood Hospital 2,300+ Technip FMC Energy Manufacturing/Headquarters 2,000+ Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital 1,800+ Sheldon Independent School District Education 1,400+ Wal Mart Retail 1,300+ Lone Star college Kingwood Education 1,200+ HEB Grocery Grocery Stores 1,100+ Total Businesses in Lake Houston Area--2021: 8,310\n\nIt is a great honor to serve as Partnership Lake Houston’s Chief Economic Development Officer. As a longtime area resident, there is no other place I would rather help cultivate. My focus is on developing a healthy economic climate for our businesses, no matter what size, whether it’s through attraction of new businesses, business retention and expansion, small business development, advocating for the public infrastructure or addressing issues that affect our community; every business deserves to have an equal opportunity to grow and thrive.\n\nFormally, I spent 31 years at CenterPoint Energy and began my career in Economic Development over 18 years ago. You might say that I sort of “fell” into Economic Development, but soon learned that this was an industry I loved and wanted to retire from. In 2017, I received my certification in Economic Development (CEcD) and went on to support many of the Economic Development organizations in the Houston region. The Houston region has some of the best Economic Developers in the business and I was able to learn from the best during my tenure at CenterPoint Energy.\n\nMy plan was to retire from CenterPoint Energy, but what’s that old saying: If you want to make God laugh, make plans? In 2022, I took a leap of faith and left CenterPoint Energy to oversee the economic development efforts of the Lake Houston area. Wow! What a year it’s been! The community has been so inviting and supportive and I really feel at home here. Logistically, we are in a prime location with access to major freeways, IAH is in our backyard, not to mention we are just a stone’s throw away from the Port of Houston and the world’s largest medical center.\n\nMy goal is to make sure our story is told properly, and we get in front of the right audiences. There is something very exciting about helping a community prosper and grow and I believe we have big things in our future. I stand forever humbled in this opportunity.\n\nStephanie Wiggins\n\nChief Economic Development Officer\n\nPartnership Lake Houston\n\nEDUCATION MATTERS\n\nHumble ISD\n\nHumble Independent School District began over 100 years ago as Harris County Common School District No. 28 with a single one-room schoolhouse. Today, with 47 campuses, more than 48,000 students and over 7,000 employees, Humble ISD is nationally recognized for the outstanding education it offers to students. Humble ISD is the sixth fastest growing school district in Texas out of 1,020 districts, and is currently the 24th largest district in the state.\n\nHumble ISD students have a long history of outperforming students in Texas and the nation. The district’s rating for 2022 is a B. In 2020, 26 students received National Merit Scholar recognition in the achievement, commended, semifinalist and finalist categories. On the 2019 SAT, our students scored 76 points above the average Texas student. On state-mandated academic assessment tests, Humble ISD students traditionally score among the highest in Texas. Also, results of college entrance exams show district students scoring well above state and national averages. Surveys indicate that approximately 85% of our students plan to continue their education following graduation.\n\nThe Humble ISD community has enjoyed a long and successful commitment to excellence in Texas education, owing in part to the support of our families and business partners. A perfect example of this close and dynamic relationship is the Humble ISD Education Foundation, created in 1999 with $46,000 in donations. Today, through the help of generous supporters, more than $16.25 million in funds has been raised to provide the innovative and enriching projects taking place in our classrooms every day.\n\nA crowning achievement, the Insperity Humble ISD Observatory, houses four telescopes, a retractable roof, a teaching classroom and Internet capability. Humble ISD is one of a very few school districts in the United States to have its own observatory.\n\nDemographic Information about Humble ISD\n\n*information from a recently published state report released in 2022 and reflects 2021-2022 figures.\n\nTOTAL NUMBER OF STUDENTS, 2022: 48,112\n\n2022 Accountability Rating: B\n\nEconomically Disadvantaged 41.7% African American 24.7% Hispanic 37.9% White 30.9% Other 6.5% 2020-21 Attendance 94.9% English Language Learners 10.7%\n\nTAPR Data from the 2021-2022 report published in 2022\n\n• STAAR % of all grades passing all tests taken 2021-22: 74%\n\n• 2021-22 Accountability Rating: B\n\n• Adopted tax rate, 2011: $1.52\n\n• Graduates, class of 2021: 3,169\n\n• Total number of schools: 45\n\n• Number of teachers: 3,200\n\n• Avg. years experience of teachers: 10.9\n\n• SAT Avg. total (2020-21): 1,000 (Reading, Writing, Mathematics)\n\n• ACT Avg. composite (2020-21) : 22\n\n• Avg. student/teacher ratio: 14.8:1\n\nA quick overview of some of the special learning opportunities offered in Humble ISD includes:\n\n• Gifted & Talented – Humble ISD’s GT programs begin in elementary school and continue into high school with Pre-AP, AP, IB, and Honors classes. The ultimate goal of the program is to provide experiences whereby students will be challenged academically, socially and emotionally to achieve their greatest potential to manage change and to have a sense of responsibility for self, school, community and society.\n\n• International Baccalaureate – Our district began offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program at Humble High School in 2008-2009 as an alternative to Advanced Placement courses. The IB Diploma Program is a highly respected, highly credible educational program that prepares students for success beyond the classroom and is recognized by the world’s leading colleges and universities. IB courses offer a college-level curriculum with international-mindedness at the high school level. The IB Diploma Program is a two-year program that starts in the 11th grade, and IB exams are taken at the end of the senior year.\n\n• Dual Credit – Humble ISD, in a longstanding partnership with Lone Star College Kingwood, continues to offer students opportunities to earn both high school and college credit for courses taken as part of our Dual Credit Program. This program offers high school students an opportunity to take challenging classes while paying a discounted fee for college credit hours that transfer to public universities in Texas.\n\n• AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) – The AVID system has been in place at many of our middle and high schools since 2010. AVID targets students in the academic middle, who in most cases, would be the first in their families to attend college; these are students who are capable of completing a rigorous curriculum but are falling short of their potential. AVID places these students on the college track, requiring them to enroll in their school’s toughest courses, such as Honors and Advanced Placement®. To support them in the rigorous coursework, AVID students learn organizational and study skills, develop critical thinking, learn to ask probing questions, receive academic help from peers and college tutors, and participate in enrichment and motivational activities to make their college dreams reality.\n\n• Guy M. Sconzo Early College High School – Imagine a school where you attend college while you are still in high school. Imagine a school where your dreams of tomorrow are started today – Sconzo Early College High School. In partnership with Lone Star College-Kingwood, Sconzo Early College High School is a small school where qualified students can earn both a high school diploma and an Associate’s degree or up to two years of credit toward a Bachelor’s degree.\n\n• Distance Learning – Distance learning is being used by students to take advantage of opportunities to interact with experts, collaborate with others and go on virtual field trips. Homebound students can communicate with their teachers and classmates, and they can take online classes. Humble ISD became the first K-12 school district to win the Outstanding Commitment to Excellence and Innovation in Distance Learning Award (2008-2009). Previously, only colleges or universities won this honor.\n\n• Mentoring – The AIM (Academic Individual Mentor) Program brings community volunteers to two Humble ISD middle schools to establish and pursue academic goals with at-risk students. The program received a 2010 Gold Award from the Texas Assn. for Partners in Education.\n\nSpring ISD\n\nThe Spring Independent School District serves more than 35,000 pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade students in a diverse district located 20 miles north of central Houston.\n\nGuided by its strategic plan, Every Child 2020, the district is preparing students for success in college, career and life. With literacy as the foundation for learning across all grade levels, the district offers academic programs that meet the needs of all learners. From high-quality early childhood programs to college preparation courses and career pathway exploration, there are programs and services designed to meet the needs of every Spring ISD student.\n\nThe district takes pride in always improving and evolving, including strengthening and expanding its special education and gifted and talented services as well as its award-winning performing and visual arts program to serve even more students. In addition to bilingual instruction and English as a Second Language programs, which have been well-established for many years, the district has added a dual language program at three elementary schools. An array of extracurricular opportunities, including UIL 16-6-A athletics and nationally recognized JROTC programs, encourage students to explore and pursue their interests.\n\nThe district currently has 38 campuses that include 26 pre-kindergarten through fifth-grade elementary schools, seven sixth- through eighth-grade middle schools and five ninth- through 12th-grade high schools. That number will change soon with the construction of several new facilities – including two middle schools, three ninth-grade centers and a state-of-the-art stadium that will serve the entire district – all funded by a bond referendum approved by voters in 2016.\n\nLone Star College- Kingwood\n\nLike many businesses and educational institutions, Lone Star College-Kingwood is finding creative ways to provide top-notch services to its customers, i.e., students, amid the ever-changing pandemic. The college’s mission is student success. To achieve this, the institution offers courses and programs in various modalities (in-person, online and hybrid) to help students meet their educational and career goals.\n\nLSC-Kingwood has two satellite facilities. The LSC-Atascocita Center, located on West Lake Houston Parkway, offers local access to academic services, general courses, workforce training and leisure learning. It is also the home for iSchool High School-Atascocita, a tuition-free public charter school. The LSC-Process Technology Center has state-of-the-art simulation equipment, a hands-on training unit, labs and classrooms for the process technology and instrumentation technology programs. It also offers general college courses.\n\nLSC-Kingwood, satellite facilities include:\n\n• Instrumentation Technology Program trains students to maintain, calibrate, troubleshoot, repair and replace process instruments.

Classes include eight-week and 16-week options in face-to-face, online and hybrid formats.\n\n“We offer a variety of class times and modalities that allow students to complete their degree in a manner and pace that are comfortable to them,” Executive Director Dr. Destry Dokes said. “Students are also supported by our outstanding faculty in all classes.”\n\nSan Jacinto College provides many resources and university partnerships to simplify the transfer process for students.\n\nFocusing on Academics, Workforce\n\nGeneration Park administrators have been working with local school districts and community stakeholders to develop a campus that offers both general academic courses and associate degrees. Dr. Dokes believes the campus’ diverse options will most attract students.\n\n“I believe students will choose us because of our academic and STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] course offerings, course relevance and transferability, and innovative technology to accommodate various learning styles and student service needs,” he said.\n\nWorkforce training solutions resources and opportunities through collaborative partnerships are also a mission of SJC. Generation Park leaders work with established and emerging industry partners to determine how the campus can assist with professional development.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe Generation Park Campus opened its first instructional building in fall 2020: A 55,000-square-foot classroom building at the heart of the 57-acre master-planned campus. The campus will continue to grow, bringing high-quality, affordable education options to the college’s northeast service area.
