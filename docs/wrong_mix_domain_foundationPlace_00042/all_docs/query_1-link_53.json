        "text": "The Visual & Performing Arts Department (V&PA) has been an integral part of Broward College since the College’s inception in 1960. If you want to study Architecture, Dance, Film Production, Graphic Design, Music, Music Technology, Theatre, or Visual Arts as a concentration — or just take a few classes for enrichment — then V&PA at Broward College is for you. We also produce a full season of performances and exhibitions in our world-class facilities. Explore our website or contact us directly to find out more about our class offerings and season calendar of events. We look forward to seeing you soon.\n\nMar. 22 - Sept 12, 2024\n\nOpening Reception: Mar. 22, 6 - 9 p.m.\n\nSequential art is frequently restricted to the spaces found in comic book stores and conventions since it is not typically seen as a valid art form. However, because this kind of art uses visual cues to convey a certain narrative, it requires highly developed design and sketching abilities, which are also used in more conventionally recognized and appreciated art forms. It also necessitates a thorough understanding of both cinematography and creative writing. Every sequential artist takes years of concentrated dedication and persistence to establish their unique voice and style.\n\nAs a part of the gallery's Curator's Co-Lab program, exhibiting artist and lecturer Eduardo Rosas has organized this group art exhibition, which showcases nine emerging South Florida artists who specialize in narrative illustration. The artwork in Borders and Gutters deviates from the popular trope of superheroes and villains. Instead, it will feature pieces that draw from the underground world of Sequential Art, where the actions of each of the nine artists' distinctively rendered characters explore actual human truths and personal experiences.\n\nViewers will gain insight into the comic book creation process, distinct stylistic approaches, and—above all—the creative possibilities of the medium and practice through this exhibition.\n\nAdditionally, some of the exhibiting artists will be doing four separate free on-campus story illustration workshops throughout the semester, which will coincide with the show. Details will be available in the Gallery's Instagram (@bcsouthcampusart).\n\nExhibiting Artists' Workshop Dates and Instagrams\n\nMarch 25, 2024: Carina Irastorza - @toomanybloops\n\nApril 1, 2024: Adrian Alvarez - @doubleaillustrations\n\nApril 8, 2024: Isaiah Torok - @fell.dragon.islayah.t\n\nApril 15, 2024: Jonathan Rowson - @jonathan_rowson\n\nApril 29, 2024: Ed Rosas - @edillustration\n\nIsrael Lee - @israelleedesign\n\nMariana Gonzalez - @marii_creates\n\nRay Reynet - @rayreynet\n\nMichael Aponte - @castofmarsstudios\n\nThe South Gallery"
