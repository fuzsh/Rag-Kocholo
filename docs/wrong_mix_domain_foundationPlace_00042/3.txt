Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) was a collective formed in 1967 in New York to promote collaboration between the arts and new technology

The collective was set up by engineers Billy Klüver and Fred Waldhauer and artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman. During the group’s existence, performances were held that incorporated pioneering technology in video projection, wireless sound transmission and Doppler sonar.

Other artists associated with the group include Deborah Hay, David Tudor, Yvonne Rainer and Steve Paxton.
