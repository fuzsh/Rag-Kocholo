The American live-action comedy film The Love Bug was coproduced by Walt Disney Productions (now the Walt Disney Company) and released in 1968. The movie centered on “Herbie,” a Volkswagen Beetle automobile that has human qualities.

Actor Dean Jones played Jim Douglas, a down-and-out race car driver who discovers that the old Volkswagen Beetle he purchased has not only a mind of its own but also impressive survival instincts. The car, nicknamed Herbie, rewards Douglas for his kindness by helping him thwart his rival, a race car driver who mistreated Herbie in the past.

The success of The Love Bug spawned numerous sequels, including Herbie Rides Again (1974), Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977), and Herbie Goes Bananas (1980). Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005) starred Lindsay Lohan, Michael Keaton, and Matt Dillon. Jones also appeared in the Love Bug television series in 1982.
