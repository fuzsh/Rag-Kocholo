        "meta_description": "Quite a lot of people came to the conclusion that watching The Love Bug was like being on drugs for about 90 minutes. It was definitely a lot of fun but also quite confusing. There was a bear in the car at one point! It also went a bit too Wacky Races at points, which was a bit of a turnoff. I know green screening wasn’t great back then, but it was slightly offputting as well. Good film but not as epic as I’d hoped.",

        "text": "1:00 What kind of crazy racing is this? Oh, demolition derby! 2:00 Some beautifully retro typeface giving us all the credits. 4:00 “I’m not a mechanic, I’m a driver.” 7:00 That car is far too yellow. I don’t approve. Never choose yellow over Herbie. 8:00 The car salesman guy seems to be playing the exact same part that he did in Mary Poppins. Bit snippy, bit shouty. 10:00 He’s a racing driver taking public transport. Ridiculous! 12:00 Yay for Herbie! Never stand near the car and shout. Noted. 13:00 Aww, Herbie was scared of the big lorries. Although… driving the wrong way down the freeway would be equally frightening. 15:00 “Ohhh, THAT Jim Douglas.” 15:00 Laguna Seca, I’ve heard of that. 20:00 Herbie the matchmaker! 21:00 You really shouldn’t wear a white coat if you’re going to start digging around in a car engine. 24:00 His best friend is kinda crazy. The stop light makes him wait six seconds longer than anyone else. 27:00 Ah, Herbie gets his name! Named after the mechanics uncle. That’s less glamorous than I would have hoped. 28:00 MARMOT! 28:00 Herbie has his colours and numbers now, too. That’s the Herbie we know and love! 31:00 Is Jim going to spend the entire film with a dirty face? 33:00 They have to stick their hand out the car to signal they’re ready to race? Madness! 34:00 I like that Herbie and the mechanic have an affinity so quickly. 37:00 I don’t want to pick holes, but there was no Herbie in that wide shot they just showed. May just be stock racing footage? 38:00 Perhaps Jim should try shutting his windows, that might save getting a dirty face. 39:00 They didn’t have tractors and cranes in the ’60s? Donkey will do to retrieve a car. 41:00 Honesty = “a quality not necessarily to be despised.” 48:00 Jim is always chewing in the car. I don’t think you’re allowed to do that in motorsport these days. 1:02:00 That’s an actual phone in a car. Twirly lead and everything. 1:06:00 The man appears to be walking around in a load of paintings - also similar to Mary Poppins! 1:07:00 Is it right that Herbie’s suicide attempt is hilarious? 1:13:00 Mr Thorndyke came up with the idea of small print? Real boos! 1:15:00 They’re going to race with all three of them in the car? There must be some kind of… eh-hem… weight disadvantage there! 1:22:00 I wish this was a real race. It’s a cross between rallying and F1, and endurance racing thrown in as well. 1:39:00 The green screen is so bad. Herbie is meant to be to the left of Herbie as we look, but the yellow car is on the left hand side. Herbie woulda been over the cliff. 1:42:00 Motorsport is dangerous enough, isn’t it? I know, let’s add some blowtorch into the mix!"
