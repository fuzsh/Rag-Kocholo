        "meta_description": "The Herbie franchise consists of American sports adventure comedy theatrical feature films, one television film, a television series, and other multimedia releases. The overall story centers around the titular Herbie, a sentient anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of his own and capable of driving himself. The vehicle is oftentimes a legitimate contender, though the underdog contestant in competitive races, but to a greater degree assists his human owners in bettering their lives.",

        "text": "The Herbie franchise consists of American sports adventure comedy theatrical feature films, one television film, a television series, and other multimedia releases.[1] The overall story centers around the titular Herbie, a sentient anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of his own and capable of driving himself. The vehicle is oftentimes a legitimate contender, though the underdog contestant in competitive races, but to a greater degree assists his human owners in bettering their lives.\n\nThe first film, notable for being the final live-action film produced under the supervision by Walt Disney prior to his death, was released in 1969. Based on a story titled \"Car, Boy, Girl\", the feature proved to be a critical and financial success for Walt Disney Productions. Upon its release, the movie was the second-highest-grossing film for the company, second only to Mary Poppins (1964). Its performance placed it fourth highest on box office returns, and spawned a franchise.[2][3] Each of the subsequent releases were successes in their own right, but none received as much universal praise as the original."
