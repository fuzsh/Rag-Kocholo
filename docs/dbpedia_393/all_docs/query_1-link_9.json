It was based on the 1961 book Car, Boy, Girl by Gordon Buford.\n\nThe movie follows the adventures of Herbie, Herbie's driver, Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), and Jim's love interest, Carole Bennett (Michele Lee). It also features Buddy Hackett as Jim's enlightened, kind-hearted friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, a character who creates \"art\" from used car parts. English actor David Tomlinson portrays the villainous Peter Thorndyke, the owner of an auto showroom and an SCCA national champion who sells Herbie to Jim and eventually becomes his racing rival.\n\nCast\n\nDean Jones as Jim Douglas, a racing driver\n\nMichele Lee as Carole Bennet, Jim's love interest\n\nDavid Tomlinson as Peter Thorndyke, the owner of the car shop\n\nBuddy Hackett as Tennessee Steinmetz, Jim's friend and roommate and partner in racing\n\nJoe Flynn as Havershaw, Thorndyke's right-hand man\n\nBenson Fong as Tang Wu, Jim's friend and team supporter\n\nJoe E.

Some parts of the racing sequences from the film were later reused for Herbie's dream sequence in Herbie Rides Again, responding to Grandma Steinmetz's telling Willoughby Whitfield that Herbie used to be a famous racecar.\n\nA five-episode television series, titled Herbie, the Love Bug, aired on CBS in the United States in 1982. Directed by Vincent McEveety, the series acted as a continuation of the films, with Dean Jones reprising his role as Jim Douglas. In 1997, there was a made-for-television sequel which included a Dean Jones cameo, tying it to the previous films. A final sequel titled Herbie: Fully Loaded, was released on June 22, 2005, by Walt Disney Pictures.\n\nAt Disney's All-Star Movies Resort at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, Herbie has been immortalized in the \"Love Bug\" buildings 6 and 7.\n\nSee also"
