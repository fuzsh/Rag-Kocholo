Based on the characters created by Gordon Buford, the film is based on a screenplay written by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, David Hoselton, Tony Gilroy and Pamela Pettler, and a story written by Pettler and Thomas Lennon. A reboot to the original Herbie series, it stars Emily Blunt, Kevin Hart, Fran Drescher, David Hyde Pierce, Hayden Christensen, Jason Schwartzman, Christina Ricci, James Van Der Beek and David Strathairn.\n\nIn the film, college graduate Kathleen Richardson discovers Herbie in a junkyard, beaten and covered in grime, and decides to rescue it and restore him to his former glory, keeping him from corrupt racing executive Dan Breusten, and his egotistical professional NASCAR racer son Bergan. In the process, Herbie receives heavy modifications to his design to qualify for the upcoming race in Los Angeles.\n\nFollowing the unsatisfactory box office performance of Herbie: Fully Loaded in 2006, Walt Disney Pictures sold the rights to the Herbie franchise to NBCUniversal for $950 million. With the acquisition complete, Universal Pictures announced a reboot to the Herbie series in 2006, effectively resetting the series altogether. Tim Hill was revealed to direct in 2008.

It received acclaim from critics, with praise for its higher production values, performances of the cast (particularly that of Blunt, Hart, Christensen, Beek and Strathairn), cinematography, plot, action sequences, screenplay, and story, though criticized the runtime. It grossed $561.4 million worldwide on its budget of $100-135 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2009.\n\nPlot[edit | edit source]\n\nTo be added.\n\nCast[edit | edit source]\n\nEmily Blunt as Kathleen Richardson, a college graduate living in San Francisco who finds Herbie while at a junkyard.\n\nKevin Hart as Bruce Brown, Kathleen's boyfriend who is a mechanic.\n\nJames Van Der Beek as Bergan Breusten, a NASCAR driver who has an inflated ego.\n\nDavid Strathairn as Dan Breusten, Bergan's father and the executive for the NASCAR event.\n\nFran Drescher as Maria Richardson, Kathleen's mother.\n\nDavid Hyde Pierce as Derek Richardson, Kathleen's father.\n\nHayden Christensen as Marcus, Kathleen's best friend.\n\nJason Schwartzman as Noah, Kathleen's friend who is a professional basketball player.\n\nChristina Ricci as Natalie, Kathleen's tomboyish friend who is a mechanic.

With the disappointment, Walt Disney Pictures was planning on putting the Herbie franchise up for potential grabs. Potential buyers included Viacom, TimeWarner, and Sony Pictures.\n\nHowever, NBCUniversal was the selected buyer, and purchased the rights to Herbie for a total cost of $950 million, becoming one of the largest acquisitions in the entertainment industry. With the acquisition finalized in March of 2006, Universal Pictures announced that a revival of the series would begin production later in the year.
