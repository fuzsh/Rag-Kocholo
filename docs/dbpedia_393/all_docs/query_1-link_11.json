It is the first of many movies about a little car determined to drive through life however the hell he wants to.\n\nProtagonist Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) is a struggling race car driver who first sees Herbie in an upscale car showroom. Unable to afford anything in the store, he leaves only to find that this stubborn little car has followed him home.\n\nShenanigans ensue when he discovers that this tiny little car can pack a punch on the race track.\n\nIt is 2023, and self-driving cars still aren’t the norm on the roads.\n\nBut if they ever become mainstream, none of them will be as fun as Herbie.\n\nTerrible Tech With a Timeless Message\n\nSince the film came out when my parents were toddlers, I expected it to have cheesy special effects and cringy dialogue."
