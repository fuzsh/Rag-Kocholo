        "text": "The Mannions watched Herbie Fully Loaded for family movie night last night, and because I think too much about these things I didn't enjoy it as much as the blonde and the boys did.\n\nFor too much of the first half of the movie I kept wanting to know why the Dean Jones character from the original Love Bug and the only halfway decent sequel, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, didn't still own Herbie.\n\nWhat was Herbie doing abandoned in some old shed? Why was he being sold for scrap? Who in their right mind would sell a car that was alive, smarter than most human beings, and capable of winning stock car races to a junk dealer? Who in their right mind would sell a 1963 WW bug in running condition to a scrap yard instead of to a collector, a museum, or a college kid with a good tool kit and the money to buy some vintage replacement parts?\n\nThe only explanation I could come up with was that Dean Jones had died unexpectedly, without heirs, and without leaving a will, probably in some terrible accident that took the lives of his mechanic and partner and the girl he married in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, Don Knotts and Julie Sommers. Herbie fell into the hands of some law firm that promptly forgot about him and then after many years sold him off with a whole bunch of other assets without ever knowing they had a super car in their possession.\n\nIt wasn't exactly cheering to think of the main character from one of my favorite movies from my childhood as dead, but once I had explained things to myself so that the premise of the movie made some sense I was able to concentrate on the second half and...\n\n...didn't enjoy it at all.\n\nFor one thing, it stopped being a comedy. As so many contemporary movie \"comedies\" do, about two thirds of the way through it turned into a sentimental drama. I figure this happens because most movie comedies are about 30 minutes too long. Their premises are worth 45 to 60 minutes worth of good jokes, but you can't sell a 45 to 60 minute movie, you need 80 minutes at least. So the writers give up being funny and go for telling a \"story.\"\n\nIf the story involves international jewel thieves, escaped zoo animals, mistaken identities, a science experiment gone awry, or anything that will require a chase and the arrival of the cops, the movie might still feel like a comedy even after the jokes are all used up.\n\nBut if the story is, oh, let's say, will the plucky young heroine with the spectacular breasts every character in the movie and the camera are doing their darnedest not to notice recognize her own self-worth and innate wonderfulness and will her irascible dad recognize her worth and innate wonderfulness and will the supporting characters who already recognize her worth and innate wonderfulness and who have talked about almost nothing else the whole time they've been on screen get to tell her one more time that she's wonderful and will all this mutual admiration of the plucky young heroine lead to her doing something that will get the whole world to recognize and celebrate her worth and innate wonderfulness---well, then, the movie isn't a comedy at all.\n\nComedy is about pushing the heroine into a giant vat of vanilla frosting at the end and having her laugh at herself not bathing her in rosy lights and letting the camera worship her as she walks in slow motion through cheering crowds with an expression of delighted self-adoration on her cute but oddly hard freckled face.\n\nThe difference between the original Love Bug and Herbie Fully Loaded is the difference between the end of the Sixties and the middle two thousand-oughts. In the intervening decades the country has embraced the cult of celebrity.\n\nAt the beginning of the Love Bug, Dean Jones' character, Jim Douglas, is a good stock car driver on a losing streak. Meeting up with Herbie saves his career (and though it's not made much of, because it's a real comedy, probably his life) and his reward for sticking with Herbie and winning the big race at the end is that he knows he will continue to get to do what he's good at, race cars.\n\nFame and fortune, of a limited sort, are probably in the offing too, but they're not the point, with him, with the girl he loves, or with the makers of the movie.\n\nAt the beginning of Herbie Fully Loaded, Lindsay Lohan's character, Maggie Peyton, is on her way to a job as at ESPN, which sounds like a good gig except that, as her best pal tells her, Maggie was made to be the story not to tell it. In other words, she's destined for stardom!\n\nWhy?\n\nSome of the dialogue tells us it's because she's such a damn fine race car driver, if only her irascible dad could admit that girls can drive cars better than boys (or if he can get over the fact that the last time she raced she totaled the car and put herself in the hospital in critical condition---the writers can't seem to make up their mind about the irascible dad's motivation) but the movie never, ever shows her being a great driver.\n\nWe get to see her being an unwilling passenger several times while Herbie shows himself to be a supercar.\n\nIn The Love Bug, Herbie has to have a driver to win races. He'll do things for Jim that no other car can do, but Jim has to know what those things are, when he needs them done, and he needs to be able to make Herbie do them. Herbie will take hairpin turns on two wheels but only if Jim is a skilled enough driver to control him while he does it.\n\nBut in Herbie Fully Loaded, Maggie never really drives Herbie. She makes only one decision in all her races but that's her contribution, telling Herbie what magic act to pull off at the proper moment.\n\nThe movie nods at the idea that Herbie is able to do the magic because of Maggie. Car and driver have a magical melding of souls, so that everything that Herbie does is somehow because he's infused with Maggie's spirit---in other words, it's her self not her skill that is wonderful. Herbie is just the first character in the movie to recognize Maggie's worth and innate wonderfulness.\n\nMaggie is a chosen one.\n\nNot the way Anakin Skywalker is the chosen one. Anakin has been given skills that make him worthy of having been chosen. But he has to then use those skills in a way that will continue to make him worthy. When he turns to the Dark Side, he rejects having been chosen. In Star Wars, to be chosen is to be given a choice.\n\nIn Herbie Fully Loaded and in the cult of celebrity being chosen is a finality. You are chosen because you are wonderful and you are wonderful because you were chosen. Nothing is required of you except that you stand still and let yourself be adored.\n\nThe movie doesn't end with the crowds cheering Maggie. The last we see of Maggie she is in the arms of the man who loves her. Hollywood is still Hollywood. Whatever other themes and plot threads have been at issue, the overriding concern of every movie is will boy get girl and girl get boy. Maggie gets her guy. It's more accurate to say her guy gets her. He's been smitten with her all movie long. Meanwhile, she's been treating him like the geeky best male friend in a John Hughes movie from the 80s. But at the end, no Andrew McCarthy shows up so she's forced to go into a clinch with Jon Cryer.\n\nThe guy, by the way, is a genius mechanic. But Maggie seems to take his skill for granted (and his putting it to use to make her a winner as her due) and in the end she rewards him not for putting Herbie back together, twice, but for his unwavering devotion to her wonderfulness.\n\nBy the way, I kept all this to myself while we were watching the movie and don't plan to say anything about it to the guys. They give it two thumbs up.\n\nAnd, on just a nuts and bolts level of appreciation, riddle me this. Where has Michael Keaton been?\n\nKeaton plays the irascible dad and he's very good. But I've only seen him in two things since he gave up being Batman. Jackie Brown and Out of Sight. Playing the same character, in the first as a supporting role and in the second as a cameo. Has he been in Europe? Has everything else he's made gone straight to video? If Kevin Costner can still be hanging around, trading on his one time status as actual movie star, it seems to me that Keaton ought to have been able to pull the same trick, having more actual talent and range.\n\nAnd Matt Dillon, playing the villain of the story, the egomaniacal star of the NASCAR circuit, Trip Murphy, chews up all the scenery, including the cars, in the grand tradition of the great character actor/heavies like Brian Donleavy, Basil Rathbone, and Lionel Barrymore. Why can't Hollywood find something to do with this guy? He's come a long, long way from Little Darlings.\n\nHe'd be a swell Humphrey Bogart to somebody's Jimmy Cagney.\n\nSpeaking of character parts, the old Disney live action comedies were full of great character parts. Herbie Fully Loaded has one bit actor in a throwaway role."
