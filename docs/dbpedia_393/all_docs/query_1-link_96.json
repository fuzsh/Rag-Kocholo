        "text": "Hear me out, I love my wife. She's from the Philippines. We've been happily married 10 years now. But often times when she's home she will watch Filipino comedy. And it's on speaker so I hear it endlessly. It's full of obnoxious sound effects, high pitched voices, jokes that don't even seem funny. She bust up laughing so much like its the funniest stuff ever. She told me I don't get it because I'm not Filipino.\n\nWhich admittedly I am American, but I love comedy. But the comedy in Philippines almost seems immature, child like and I feel like they make it dumb as if to say \"We know our audience won't get it adult humor\". Which I think is why I hate the comedy even more, its insulting to the viewers.\n\nAt least she does understand some comedy here. Though satire and parody she doesn't understand at all. She thinks Weird Al is stupid and rips peoples music off. >.> To note before people rip into me, I do LOOOOVE the Philippines. You all are super friendly, got some great food, a beautiful country and amazing singers."
