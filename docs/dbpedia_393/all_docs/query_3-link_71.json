        "text": "NEW YORK — Herbie and co-star Giselle from 1977's Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo will be offered at auction in Treasures from the Dream Factory, presented by Bonhams and Turner Classic Movies (TCM). Introduced in The Love Bug (1968), Herbie is a white 1963 Volkswagen Beetle who follows race car driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) home from the showroom. That film was such a success that Disney subsequently made five more movies and two television shows about the anthropomorphic car. In all, the Herbie films grossed more than $200 million at the box office in their initial domestic release, or $725 million in today's currency.\n\nThe Herbie for sale at Bonhams New York on Nov. 23, was discovered in a warehouse in Florida several years ago and remains in largely unrestored condition. Originally built for Herbie Rides Again (1974) and also used in Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, it is one of the ingenious \"Invisible Driver\" Herbies. Modified with an elaborate system of sprockets and pulleys connected to a second steering column under the front seat, the driver sits in the backseat to give the impression that the car is driving itself. This car also has the distinction of being the only vehicle ever to leave its tyre print in the cement at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, during promotion for Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo.\n\nHerbie is joined by his love interest from the film, a powder blue Lancia Scorpion named Giselle. In the film, Giselle is Herbie's competitor in the Trans-France Race, driven by Diane Darcy (Julie Sommars). Herbie quickly became enamoured of this shapely sports car, presenting her with a bouquet of flowers held in his back bumper. Three Scorpions were used in filming, with the other two believed to have been subsequently crashed and scrapped. This car was auctioned off in 1980, repainted and for a time used as a daily driver before being discovered by its present owner who recognised its bolt-on roll bar and several other movie modifications. The car was then entrusted to Disney movie car expert Dan Miller at Red Barn Restorations in northeast Ohio who restored to its screen-used appearance. Both cars are accompanied by their original Walt Disney Productions titles.\n\nOther automotive highlights in the auction include Steve McQueen's iconic racing suit from Le Mans ($200,000-300,000) as well as co-star Michele Scalera's racing suit ($5,000-7,000). Both lots were gifted to an Italian gentleman by Titanus, the film's distributor in that country, and have been in his collection ever since.\n\nThe sale will be previewed at Bonhams New York from Nov. 20-23. View the catalogue here.\n\nTreasures from the Dream Factory is the third in a series of movie memorabilia auctions as part of a multi-year partnership between Bonhams and TCM. Past sales have resulted in high-profile sales, such as the Maltese Falcon at $4.2 million, a record price for a movie prop; the sale of Sam's piano from Rick's Café in Casablanca for $3.4 million, a record price for a piano; and Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion costume from The Wizard of Oz at $3 million, a record price for a costume from that film.\n\nABOUT TCM\n\nTurner Classic Movies (TCM) is a Peabody Award-winning network that presents great films, uncut and commercial-free, from the largest film libraries in the world.
