        "text": "The Love Bug (sometimes referred to as Herbie the Love Bug) is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Robert Stevenson and the first in a series of films made by Walt Disney Productions and distributed by Buena Vista Distribution that starred an anthropomorphic pearl-white, fabric-sunroofed 1963 Volkswagen racing Beetle named Herbie. It was based on the 1961 book Car, Boy, Girl by Gordon Buford.\n\nThe movie follows the adventures of Herbie, Herbie's driver, Jim Douglas (Dean Jones), and Jim's love interest, Carole Bennett (Michele Lee). It also features Buddy Hackett as Jim's enlightened, kind-hearted friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, a character who creates \"art\" from used car parts. English actor David Tomlinson portrays the villainous Peter Thorndyke, (familiar from his role as Mr. George Banks in Mary Poppins) the owner of an auto showroom and an SCCA national champion who sells Herbie to Jim and eventually becomes his racing rival."
