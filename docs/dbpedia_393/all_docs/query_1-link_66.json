According to Car Collectors Club, this 30,000 square foot (and continuously expanding) museum that houses automobiles that have appeared in more than 100 movies, TV shows, and videos is the result of collaboration with Dezer, one of the world's top car collectors. And today, numerous sparkling vehicles may be found inside the Hollywood Cars Museum's recently constructed Liberace Garage! Visitors can also witness vehicles from television programs like \"The A Team,\" \"Hardcastle and McCormick,\" \"Starsky and Hutch,\" \"Munsters,\" and \"General Lee\" from \"Dukes of Hazzard.\" Additionally, SpongeBob SquarePants, the Mater tow truck from the Cars cartoon film, Bugs Bunny's Rabbit Car, and the Tasmanian Devil Car are also honored. Let’s learn more about the history of classic cars in film and television while also exploring some specific famous models in detail!\n\n1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse (The Fast And The Furious)\n\nAmerican interest in modified Japanese Domestic Hot Rod-style small supercars has undoubtedly increased as a result of the Fast and the Furious movies. The 2.0 L 4-cylinder 210 HP 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse utilized in the film was produced by Mitsubishi Motors and Diamond-Star Motors. The 1995 Eclipse that leaves the production line is not a quick vehicle. It can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 15.1 seconds, reaching a top speed of 140 mph. In the Paul Walker-starring Fast and Furious film, a Los Angeles police officer goes undercover as a street racer and falls in love with his new hobby. He isn't sure if he wants to join the police force again after discovering his new interest. To everyone's dismay, the actor Paul Walker died in a car accident after the movie was shot. But the value of these tiny Japanese Domestic Hot Rods has risen as a result of the enormous success of the Fast and Furious films. In reality, the standard 1995 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs, like Walker's initial car in the movie, have seen a 73.9 percent increase in price, to roughly $20,700, according to the official Hagerty Price Guide for collectable cars.\n\nThe Batmobile – (Batman)\n\nBob Kane and Bill Finger developed the original Batman character in 1939 for DC Comics. Since then, there have been more than 20 Batman movies, which have become cult classics. Batman travels about in a very unique vehicle known as the \"Batmobile\" in each film. This first film's \"Batmobile\" was featured in \"Batman Returns,\" starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, and the 1990 adaptation aptly titled \"Batman: The Movie.\" Batman fights crime in the city of Gotham using this neo-retro custom-built crime-fighting vehicle in these films. Numerous offensive and defensive weapons are mounted to the car. The side-mounted missile launchers, smoke generators, and Browning M1919.30 caliber machine gun are the most efficient weapons. The Batmobile is now on display at the Hollywood Car Museum in Las Vegas, Nevada, though it is still kept in Bruce Wayne's Batcave every night. The Batmobile from the first Batman movie has a Turbo Jet Turbine that enables it to go from 0 to 60 mph in under 3.7 seconds and reach a top speed of 329 mph (530 km/h) with a booster. Julian Caldow created the sketches for the Batmobile, and Keith Short created the final body sculpt. The 1950s StingRay macho automobiles, the 1930s Salt Flat Speed Racers, and the 1950s StingRay macho machines all contributed to the creation of this Batmobile, which is a genuine tank of a vehicle. Keith Short sculpted the vehicle's body. The 1989 Batman Movie and the 1990 Batman Return movie both featured the Batmobile, which was built by Anton Furst using a modified Chevrolet Impala chassis. The original 1989–1990 Batmobile was purchased by Jeff Dunham from the Tim Burton auto collection for $620,000.\n\n1965 Mercedes Benz 220SE (The Hangover)\n\nHow fitting is it that a vehicle from a movie that was shot in Las Vegas is currently on exhibit there? A 1965 Mercedes-Benz 220SE Convertible, the Mercedes featured in the motion picture The Hangover, is available for sale for around $95,000. It is currently on display in Las Vegas at the Hollywood Car Museum. Characters Stu, Doug, Phil, Black Doug, and the funny Mr. Chow virtually damaged three Mercedes-Benz in the film. Warner Bros.’ The Hangover movie was a huge success. It features four hilarious individuals who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and binge drink till they wake up the next morning with no memory of the previous night. And the Mercedes-Benz 220SE simply perishes while trying to reverse their course. The Hangover is a 2009 American comedy film that Todd Phillips and Daniel Goldberg co-produced. It was written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. The comic and heartbreaker The Hangover, starring Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, and Justin Bartha, was quickly followed by The Hangover II and The Hangover III. For those auto enthusiasts, the 1965 Mercedes 220SE Convertible features a 2306 cm3 M180 engine with twin Zenith carburetors that produces 120 HP and has a top speed of 109 mph (174 km/h). It also boasts a 13-second 0–100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time.\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang Race Car (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang)\n\nThe Universal Studios musical film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang debuted in theaters in December 1968. It was originally a children's book that Ian Fleming wrote in 1964 for his son Caspar. One of the most recognizable flying movie cars in the world today is the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang vehicle. Ken Adam came up with the idea, designed it, and the Ford Racing Team built it afterwards. The console was made from a military jet, and the car's bonnet is made of polished metal. The boat's deck is made by hand of red and white cedar. The majority of the polished brass components and fixtures came from Edwardian automobiles. The Ken Adams vehicle is propelled by a Ford three-liter V6 engine. Dick Van Dyke, who plays an eccentric inventor and car racer who takes his children for a once-in-a-lifetime journey, operated it in the motion picture. There are numerous replicas of the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang cars that were produced for the movie. \"When you see this car, it is the best of the best and will take your breath away.\" This is an exceptional exhibition car for a museum or car collector. The Chitty Chitty Bang Bang automobile is valued as a collectible at $805,000.\n\nHudson Hornet (Cars)\n\nThe Hudson Motor Car Company built the car from 1950 and 1957, and it was \"described as the best-handling car of its era.\" Doc Hudson's Hornet (as pictured above) initially appeared in the Pixar animated film Cars. Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios worked together to make the film Cars, which had its global premiere on May 26, 2006, at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. The film broke all previous box office records and made over $462 million overall. Paul Neuman provides the voiceovers for the film. Since then, the automobile has become a legend in the automotive industry. The Hudson Hornet is both a real car and an animated vehicle in the film. The Hollywood Car Museum in Las Vegas today houses the 1951 Fabulous Hudson Hornet Movie Car.\n\nHerbie The Love Bug (The Love Bug)\n\nBased on a book written by Gordon Buford in 1961, Robert Stevenson's comedy picture The Love Bug was released in 1968 by Walt Disney Productions. Dean Jones, Michele Lee, David Tomlinson, and Buddy Hackett are among the cast members of the film, which centers on a tiny Volkswagen Beetle that develops a personality of its own. On March 13, 1969, The Love Bug Movie was made available. A 1963 Volkswagen Beetle with a 40 BHP 1192 cc engine with red and blue racing stripes known as the Herbie Love Bug Car (#53) is currently on display at the Hollywood Car Museum in Las Vegas. Why does Herbie have the number 53 is a common question. Because Dodger Star Don Drysdale conspicuously sports the number 53 on his uniform, the producer of the Love Bug movie, Bill Walsh, wanted to recognize his friend and favorite baseball player.\n\nWhat’s Your Favorite Film/TV Show that Features a Classic Car?\n\nVintage cars play a pivotal role in film and television, serving as iconic symbols of nostalgia, luxury, and style.
