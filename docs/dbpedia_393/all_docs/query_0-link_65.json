OK, I'd put \"Double Indemnity\" or \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\" or \"Avanti!\" (1972) or \"Sunset Boulevard\" or \"Ace in the Hole\" or \"One, Two Three\" or maybe even \"Kiss Me, Stupid\" above Wilder's \"Some Like It Hot\" or \"The Apartment,\" but that's me. Speaking of which, here's my list (as published):\n\nThis is one of the walls (viewed from the comfort of the Man Chair) that helped me generate my list of lieblingsfilme. Note prominence of Keaton (life mask) and Buñuel.\n\nJim Emerson\n\n\"Nashville\" (Altman, 1975) \"Chinatown\" (Polanski, 1974) \"Vertigo\" (Hitchcock, 1958) \"Sherlock, Jr. (Keaton, 1924) \"Our Hospitality\" (Keaton, Blystone, 1923) \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" (Keaton, Reisner, 1928) \"Citizen Kane\" (Welles, 1941) \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (Hawks, 1939) \"North by Northwest\" (Hitchcock, 1959) \"Rio Bravo\" (Hawks, 1959) \"Double Indemnity\" (Wilder, 1944) \"La dolce vita\" (Fellini, 1960) \"Barry Lyndon\" (Kubick, 1975) \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (Kubrick, 1968) \"Trouble in Paradise\" (Lubitsch, 1932) \"Holiday\" (Cukor, 1938) \"Animal Crackers\" (Heerman, 1930) \"Sunrise\" (Murnau, 1927) \"Miller's Crossing\" (Coen, 1990) \"Letter from an Unknown Woman\" (Ophuls, 1948) \"Sansho Dayu\" / \"Sansho the Bailiff\" (Mizoguchi, 1954) \"Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie\" / \"The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\" (Buñuel, 1972) \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" (T. Jones, 1979) \"Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes\" / \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" (Herzog, 1972) \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (Spielberg, 1977) \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid\" (Peckinpah, 1973) \"Dazed and Confused\" (Linklater, 1993) \"Boogie Nights\" (Anderson, 1997) \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada\" (2005) by T.L. Jones, \"Stop Making Sense\" (J. Demme, 1984)\n\nIn choosing my favorites (mainly by using my memory and glancing around the room at shelves and posters), I emphasized the impact these movies have had on me, my joy at revisiting them, and my desire to see them again. And yet there are so many personally indispensable movies that aren't on my list, either because they got crowded out as I filled up the slots or because I neglected to think of them at that moment.\n\nLooking at the other lists, I think I found a kindred spirit in somebody I don't know, Hans-Dieter Delkus, whose (chronologically ranked) assortment made me smile (even though I haven't seen most of the shorts or even a few of the features):\n\n\"Our Hospitality\" \"Un Chien Andalou\" (Buñuel, 1929) \"Ein blonder Traum\" (Martin, 1932 -- co-written by Billy Wilder) \"Liebelei\" (Ophuls, 1933) \"Der Firmling\" (short starring Karl Valentin, 1934) \"Way Out West\" (Laurel & Hardy; Horne, 1937) \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (Capra, 1946) \"Begone Dull Care\" (animated short; Lambard and McLaren, 1949) \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" (Ford, 1949) \"In a Lonely Place\" (Ray, 1950) \"The Far Country\" (A. Mann, 1954) \"Touch of Evil\" \"Vertigo\" \"Imitation of Life\" (Sirk, 1959) \"The Ladies Man\" (Lewis, 1961) \"Pierrot le fou\" (Godard, 1965) \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\" \"Free Radicals\" (???) \"Days of Heaven\" (Malick, 1978) \"Heaven's Gate\" (Cimino, 1980) \"Sans Soleil\" (Marker, 1983) \"Peggy Sue Got Married\" (Coppola, 1986) \"Midnight Run\" (Brest, 1988) \"Batman Returns\" (Burton, 1992) \"The Kingdom I + II\" (von Trier, 1994/1997) \"Nobody's Fool\" (Benton, 1994) \"Beautiful Girls\" (T. Demme, 1996) \"Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi\" / \"Spirited Away\" (Miyazaki, 2001) \"Far From Heaven\" (Haynes, 2002)"
