        "text": "Car-racing films have provided audiences with a theatrical adrenaline rush for decades.\n\nIn the 1960s, moviegoers were dazzled by the effects in Grand Prix and charmed by lovable race cars like Herbie the Beetle in The Love Bug.\n\nLe Mans, The Cannonball Run and Days of Thunder put big stars behind the wheel in Steve McQueen, Burt Reynolds and Tom Cruise, respectively.\n\nIn the 21st century, Disney and Pixar reimagined the racetrack for its Cars franchise, complete with a determined talking automobile and many motor-themed puns; Universal's The Fast and the Furious revved up a winning series of films featuring Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker; and Sony's Adam McKay-directed Talladega Nights, starring Will Ferrell, highlighted the humor in high-speed rivalries.\n\nMore recent entrants include critically acclaimed, real-life inspired films like Universal's Ron Howard-directed Rush, starring Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl, and Fox's James Mangold-helmed Ford v. Ferrari, with Christian Bale and Matt Damon.\n\nFrom family-friendly comedies to fast-paced dramas, high-speed car-racing films have taken audiences for an exciting ride throughout the years.\n\nRead on for a trip down memory lane in 10 well-known driving movies."
