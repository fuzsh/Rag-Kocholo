        "text": "Filmmaker Judd Apatow has been very busy. He’s produced four films that are being released this year (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers, and Drillbit Taylor, which opens this Friday), and he’s also one of the writers of You Don’t Mess with the Zohan. But he was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to talk to us about which movies have really influenced him as a filmmaker.\n\nDirector Peter Segal has spent time with The Klumps, gone on 50 First Dates, and lived through Anger Management. This year, the go-to guy for summer comedies is gearing up to Get Smart, the spy spoof update starring Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, and Alan Arkin that’s out June 20. Read on to find out Segal’s five favorite movies as told to RT.\n\nSure, he’s confronted his critics — and Michael Bay — in the most unusual ways. And yes, he’s turned a some of your most beloved video game titles into big-screen clunkers (none of which have yet broken 11 percent on the Tomatometer*). Heck, the man who gave us such stinkers as Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, and Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King has even agreed to retire if an online petition asking him to simply “stop” reaches one million signatures. But we bet you never expected Uwe Boll to pick veritable classics of cinema as his favorite films of all time…\n\nRead on for Dr. Uwe Boll’s five favorite films, as told to RT.\n\n*Boll’s latest film, the political satire Postal, currently has a career-high 29 percent Tomatometer.\n\nTune in next week for our full interview with Uwe Boll, in which the Postal director shares the secret of how exactly he makes money on flicks like Alone in the Dark and Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King, and answers your submitted questions!\n\nYou may not know it, but you’ve seen Doug Jones’ work. One of the best physical actors in Hollywood, he has performed under heavy make-up and special effects as the Silver Surfer in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, the “Gentlemen” on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and gave life to both The Faun and the Pale Man in Guillermo del Toro‘s Oscar-winning horror-fairytale, Pan’s Labyrinth. This week, Jones reprises his role of amphibian psychic Abe Sapien in Hellboy II: The Golden Army, the sequel to del Toro’s 2004 comic book adaptation, in which he enjoys extended screen time as Hellboy’s crime-fighting sidekick and romances a princess — and more importantly, takes over (or takes back) Abe’s voicing duties for the first time.\n\nWe spoke with Doug Jones about his work under prosthetics, his close relationship with Guillermo del Toro, and his battle to win Abe Sapien’s voice back from David Hyde Pierce (who, as the story goes, graciously deferred vocal credit in the first Hellboy after seeing Jones’ own performance). And after playing every fantastical creature from robots to aliens to yetis, Jones told us what his dream role would be — and how he and del Toro may already be planning to bring it to the screen.\n\nBut first, Jones took time to share his favorite films of all time with Rotten Tomatoes. Read on for more!\n\nNext: Our full interview with Doug Jones!\n\nYour Five Favorite Films are interesting because they seem to speak to you as an actor’s actor, not just a creature actor. You’ve not only done great creature work in films like Pan’s Labyrinth and Hellboy, you also play regular characters. Has it been strange to become known for your work under prosthetics as opposed to the latter?\n\nDoug Jones: Thank you. It’s very kind of you to notice that. If you asked me this a few years ago, I might have said that the day would come where I’m not wearing prosthetics anymore and I’m just doing straight acting roles. But you know what I think I’ve learned in the last couple years especially, is that with a little bit more recognition, a certain respect and dignity has returned to these kinds of roles — monsters with a heart. It’s a throwback to the Golden Era, when you had Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney doing these roles that were leading men in their own little creature-y, freaky little way. Directors like Guillermo del Toro (pictured at left with Jones at the Hellboy II premiere), who like to tell that kind of story, take you to a fantastical world but deal with real human issues when they get there. That’s brought a certain, like I said, respect and dignity to this kind of story and this kind of acting, so that I’m now happy to continue it until the day I die. In fact, I’ll tell you the perfect way for me to die. You want to hear it? I think if I’m on a Guillermo del Toro film — and I want to finish it for him, I don’t want to leave him hanging — and my last day, when they yell, “It’s a wrap on Doug Jones,” that’s how I want to die. That’s the perfect way for me to go.\n\nThat’s really sweet. It speaks to the bond that you and Guillermo have obviously formed by working together.\n\nDJ: We definitely do have a sort of shorthand with each other, and a respect for each other, and an actor-director relationship that really works and doesn’t need a whole lot of dialogue. We understand each other with very few words.\n\nSpeaking of words, let’s talk about how you came to voice your character, Abe Sapien, in Hellboy II. We know that David Hyde Pierce, who voiced Abe in the first Hellboy while you did the physical acting, had such tremendous respect for your performance in that film that he had his credit removed.\n\nDJ: He’s a gentleman beyond words. And in an ego-driven business like ours it’s unheard of for an actor to do what David Hyde Pierce did. The more questionable thing is, how did it come about that someone was voiced over like that in the first place? When presented with an acting role, any actor assumes they’re taking on the character, and that would include all of it — it would include the visuals and the audio part and everything. I don’t walk down the street doing half of Doug Jones! I walk into a 7-11 and I get to order for myself. So originally it was kind of like, you’ve got this major make-up, and you’ve got A-list celebrities that probably don’t want to don that much make-up and be obliterated in the face, so the studio was thinking, we’ll get someone to physically pull it off, and we’ll get an A-list name that we can market with the film that’ll provide the voice, and there you go. We can attach a name to the part without gruesome amounts of make-up on that person. When I heard that that’s what the plan was — that was already decided by the time I was cast — I said, hey, how about we don’t do that? How about I get to do the part, as I’d play any part? So I was given the opportunity to be one of the voices being considered, but at the time Doug Jones didn’t carry a lot of weight as a name, as a marketing tool.\n\nIn the end, everyone was happy with my performance, and I was kind of directed even to sound like… Guillermo wanted me to sound a little bit like Niles Crane from Frasier, with a little bit of HAL the computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey. So I kind of affected a sound for Abe that wasn’t far from David Hyde Pierce anyway. He, being the gentleman that he is, heard my performance in his ear piece when he came in to voice-over, and he saw my performance on film, and he kind of backed away saying, “Why am I here?” It was one of those things where he, as legend goes, was very much a gentleman that backed away from taking a credit in the film and doing any press, and doing any limelight-type things, and he left that all to me. Which was very, very, very sweet and kind of him.\n\nSo that continued through to the animated features, when he was offered the voice of Abe Sapien, and he politely declined. And that’s when they just deferred to me immediately. Part of the discussion that Guillermo had with me, when he told me about the first film and what happened with the voice, was he said, “If we get the blessing and the opportunity to do a Hellboy II, I would like to have your voice back in it.” So this animated feature was a nice transitional period to do that in, and by the time Hellboy II came around, I was assured and promised that the voice would stay intact as mine. I love David Hyde Pierce, I think he’s a wonderful actor, but it really is nice to have that whole baby, in its entirety, back in my hands again. Before I was kind of holding a baby without legs [Laughs].\n\nIn Hellboy II, Abe has a considerably large storyline; was that borne of fan love of Abe from the first movie, and will that prominence carry over to the third movie?\n\nDJ: Yes, and yes. And I believe it’s also borne of Guillermo del Toro’s love for Abe Sapien. I’ll share a little moment with you from the set. We were doing the scene in the library, when Abe and the lovely Princess Nuala are getting to know each other over a book of poetry. There was this backlight that shined and hit my gills, and Guillermo said to me, before we rolled on the next take, “There’s something about the way the light shines on Abe’s gills that just makes my heart flutter.” That was one way of him expressing his absolute adoration for Abe Sapien. So, yes; I think there was a resounding cry from the fans for more Abe in the second film, and there was a desire in Guillermo all along to build on Abe as well.\n\nNext: Doug Jones’ dream role\n\nYour work as the Faun and the Pale Man in Pan’s Labyrinth was well-received. Again in Hellboy II, you play three different characters.\n\nDJ: I was Abe, and the Angel of Death, and the Chamberlain; those are my three. The Chamberlain is the doorkeeper for the king of the elven underworld — he’s a sad looking fellow, isn’t he?\n\nThese new characters even seem to have some resemblance to those you played in Pan’s Labyrinth.\n\nDJ: It was the same creature designers as the first Hellboy, Spectral Motion. They’re also the ones who made me up as the Silver Surfer [in Fantastic Four 2]. The Pan’s Labyrinth people were DDT Effectos Especiales in Barcelona. In Hellboy II they did design and apply the make-up for young Hellboy. Hellboy II had so many creatures in it, they pulled in a lot of shops, but the main characters were by Spectral Motion — Hellboy, and Abe, and the Angel of Death and such.\n\nOne last question: If you could play any creature from mythology or lore that we haven’t seen yet onscreen, what would it be?\n\nDJ: Actually, there’s been some talk recently that really intrigued me, about doing Frankenstein. That’s something I had never thought of because he’s rather large and lumbering in the imagery that you’ve seen of him before. However, there are new art concepts that Guillermo has seen, and the idea of doing Frankenstein with a thinner, more soulful kind of monster in Frankenstein could be something really delicious to chew on.\n\nGuillermo was asked about this recently, on the red carpet of the Hellboy II premiere. [ShockTilYouDrop‘s Ryan Rotten got the scoop.] A journalist got to him first and asked, “Hey Guillermo, if you did Frankenstein, who would the monster be?” And Guillermo said, a resounding “Doug Jones” — which seems like an alternative choice to what you’ve seen before, but there’s a certain type of artwork that he’s seen of Frankenstein and that’s what interested him. The journalist got to me next and said, “Hey, guess what I just heard Guillermo say?” I was like, “Oh, you’re kidding!” I went onto DelToro films, which is his website, and there’s a message board that the fans talk on, and somebody on a thread for fan art submitted a piece of art of a Frankenstein built on Doug Jones. The artist’s screen name is Riddick, so that’s how you can find it. (Click here for a full view of the art. Conception and design courtesy of the artist, Alex Tuis.) There’s a drawing in there that is based on me that is a Frankenstein that I would kill to play. Looking at that imagery, and having Guillermo as a director, and knowing Frankenstein’s sympathetic side and his scary side — I love characters like that that are sympathetic and yet scary at the same time — that could become a dream role for me. Absolutely.\n\nIt seems like if Guillermo’s in for a project, you’re in.\n\nDJ: As he said, [in his best Guillermo del Toro voice] “Listen, if I direct a hemorrhoid commercial, Doug Jones will be in it.” And I feel the same way. If he’s directing a hemorrhoid commercial, I’ll play the frickin’ hemorrhoid. He’ll find a way to make it artful; I know he will.\n\nHellboy II: The Golden Army is in theaters this Friday, July 11 and currently sits at 89 percent on the Tomatometer.\n\nIt’s been eleven years since we last saw Casper Van Dien as Federation soldier Johnny Rico in Paul Verhoeven‘s sci-fi cult film, Starship Troopers. Two sequels later, Van Dien is back with a new crew, new weapons, new dangers, and the same familiar problems with authority figures and alien bugs. Van Dien spoke with Rotten Tomatoes to share his Five Favorite (Sci-Fi) Films of all time, discuss his longtime friendship with Starship Troopers: Marauder director Ed Neumeier, and reveal how the last decade and two sequels have changed Johnny Rico and the Starship Troopers franchise.\n\nStarship Troopers: Marauder premieres on DVD Tuesday, August 5; click here to preview two exclusive behind-the-scenes clips for peeks of the new Marauder suit and weapons. Read on for Casper Van Dien’s 5 Favorite (Sci-Fi) Films of all time!\n\nNext: Our full interview with Casper Van Dien!\n\nCasper van Dien: I love Ed Neumeier; I think he’s got a wonderfully sick, perverse sense of humor. It was a lot of fun to have in the first film, and to also see it in RoboCop as well, and to see him put it into this script — I had the opportunity to read five of the scripts for Starship Troopers 3 specifically over the last four years, and I just love reading his dark sense of humor. I love seeing it, and to get the opportunity to read it so many different times was awesome. And to see him make the film, it was a natural segue for him, so it was a thrill for me to be a part of.\n\nWere you close with Ed from working on the first Starship Troopers? Was he a presence on set back then?\n\nCvD: Ed is a unique writer — Paul Verhoeven is a unique director, but he demanded that Ed be on the set [of Starship Troopers] every day. So for RoboCop and for Starship Troopers he was on the set every single frickin day. He was there from the beginning to the end. It was fun for me, because he and I became friends. But Ed and I became friends actually when he saw me when I first walked into the audition for Starship Troopers. I was sitting out there with all the other guys that were auditioning for the role, and Ed poked his head out of the office; he was not only one of the writers, but he was one of the producers at that time. He poked his head out of the office, looked at me, pointed at me, and fingered me to come over to him. So I went over to him and in front of the other kids, I was like “Ha ha hah…” I walk into his office and he had a rifle there and I picked it up, and I did some drills with it from military school and we got to talking, and he said he knew when he poked his head out of the office that I was Johnny Rico. And Paul Verhoeven said that when I came into read he knew that I was Johnny Rico. So it was always a thrill to have these men believe in me. Ed really wanted me in the second one, but the director didn’t want any characters from the first film in it. Ed said if he got to do one of his own, that he would demand that I be in it, and I guess he got his way.\n\nI was wondering why you weren’t in the second Starship Troopers film, Hero of the Federation…\n\nCvD: The director [Phil Tippett] really wanted to go a different way, from what I gather. I don’t know everything for a fact — you’ll have to ask him personally — but he also, from what I hear, wanted the humor out of Starship Troopers. It might have been the studio at the time that wanted the humor out, but they really asked Ed to put it back in for this one. So Ed was like, well, that’s the way I like to write, and that’s what he did.\n\nThis film was always meant to be a DVD release. But it’s getting a theatrical in Japan because they did such a phenomenal job with it that Japan said, we want this for a theatrical [release]. But it was always meant to be a DVD.\n\nWell, there’s definitely a collective love for the first Starship Troopers, and Marauder seems to fall much closer to the spirit of the original.\n\nCvD: Definitely. You are one hundred percent correct. Robert Heinlein created Starship Troopers, but Ed created the Starship Troopers movie world. He put in his political satire in the first film, he’s got it in this film and then some, and he’s also got this new religious twist, which some may or may not get. I think it’s hysterical, though. He’s a phenomenal writer. Different people will embrace it in different ways. And other people will hate it in other ways, but it’s always fantastic to have that kind of variation in appeal, or lack thereof.\n\nNext: Ed Neumeier vs. Paul Verhoeven, Johnny Rico vs. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and more\n\nHaving known Ed for a while and worked with him before, how would you describe him as a first-time director, especially in contrast to Paul Verhoeven?\n\nCvD: That’s a very good question. Ed Neumeier — this is a natural segue for him, to go from writer-creator to director, and this is an easier venue for him to do that as his debut. Because he is already known, and this is an established franchise that he’s affiliated with and have a lot more appreciation for and from. The advantage for him is as a director, he hired a great team around him. He did a superb job and the people really embraced it and loved him and went for it. But he also had the most incredible training and advantage over most debut directors, because he was on the set every day of RoboCop, and on the set every day of Starship Troopers, under one of the greatest directors of all time: Paul Verhoeven. So he had that instruction. Paul — even if you watch Black Book today…what a great film that is. Paul continues to grow as a director and his passion is unsurpassed by anybody. Ed was able to witness this and get these lessons and instructions. And also he’s a fan of films. Ed’s a huge fan of John Ford films, and you can talk to him about just about any film. Differences between them? Paul’s a bit more of a screamer, and he has more of an accent. [Laughs]\n\nPaul had a bigger budget, but what Ed had for this was phenomenal. Robert Skotak was the Academy Award-winning special effects guy for Aliens and T2, and he wanted to be on the first Starship Troopers because he was a big fan of the book, and he got to do this one and he did something like 420 more special effects than he was scheduled to do because he loved it so much. The bug that Ed wrote about, he created. The old bugs, he put his little flavors into. For the budget that he had, he did the most phenomenal job. What I also appreciate is Sony, they got Klaus Badelt, who did the music for Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, who saw this and loved it and did the music for it. So they really got some remarkable people behind it. And Sony’s putting the most incredible campaign I have ever seen together for a DVD release. The Japanese website is incredible, and the posters that you see throughout the world, from Australia to America to Japan, are awesome! And I’m not just saying that because I’m on the cover…\n\nWhere would you place Johnny Rico in the pantheon of great sci-fi heroes?\n\nCvD: Well, being the self-absorbed me…I remember seeing this article that rated different superheroes, and it had me beating Jesse Ventura from Predator, and it had me beating Demi Moore from G. I. Jane — it had Johnny Rico beating these guys — and it had Sylvester Stallone beating John Wayne…whatever! And Arnold Schwarzenegger beat me, but then Arnold Schwarzenegger beat Stallone. So I came in third. But right now, I could kick either of their asses, ’cause they’re old. I’m sorry! Put ’em down like the b****es they are! Just kidding, I don’t know. Arnold Schwarzenegger can still take me out, he’s the Governator; Sylvester Stallone, I just saw him in Rambo and he was huge. Huuuuge.\n\nYeah, but how many of them still do nude scenes like the one you have in Starship Troopers: Marauder?\n\nCvD: [Laughs] I don’t think we’d want to see them in a nude scene right now! I hardly want to see myself in a nude scene, but I worked out really hard for that one.\n\nSo tell us how Johnny Rico has changed in the near-decade since we last saw him in Starship Troopers.\n\nCvD: Well it’s eleven years later, and it’s eleven years later for him as well. He’s survived — one of the few in the Starship Troopers world to do so — men, women, an equal kill factor. It seems like he’s become more of a pure warrior. He might be more disillusioned with the higher ranking officers and their willingness to sacrifice good troopers, as many of us are disillusioned with the people in charge who are willing to sacrifice American soldiers who are willing to do their part, and do it well, and who have honorable intentions. I think that is what he’s become. He joined the military first for a girl, and was trying to impress her, though that of course didn’t work; we always do stupid things when we’re young to try and impress girls and it never works, but…he became a soldier, and now he’s a pure warrior, and he’s very good at what he does. Maybe not as good as everyone else because they get promoted a lot faster, but he’s good enough to survive, and that’s a definite plus in the Starship Troopers world.\n\nFor more info, photos and news, check out our Starship Troopers: Marauder page.\n\nActress Eva Mendes has made much of the last ten years in Hollywood, skyrocketing from small parts in movies like Night at the Roxbury and Exit Wounds to featured roles in — films like Training Day, Ghost Rider, and Hitch. More impressively, she’s gone for a variety of interesting roles in blockbusters and indie films alike, working closely with the likes of Will Smith, Robert Rodriguez, the Farrelly brothers, Nicolas Cage (twice), Denzel Washington (also twice), Frank Miller, and Werner Herzog, in the upcoming Bad Lieutenant.\n\nIn this week’s The Women, based on the play by Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos’ 1939 script, Mendes plays Manhattan temptress Crystal Allen, a ruthless vixen in kitten heels (and a character played by none other than Joan Crawford in George Cukor’s 1939 film of the same name). Joining an all-star cast of some of Hollywood’s biggest female names, Mendes holds her own against the combined forces of Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Bette Midler whilst notching another prominent role in her filmography. Once you read her Five Favorite Films, you’ll agree that Eva Mendes is aiming high; we personally can’t wait to see her in a Coen brothers film.\n\nNext: Read on as we talk Women with Eva Mendes.\n\nPlease tell us about your character, Crystal. Is she as much a “villain” in The Women as she is in the original? Is she meant to be even partly sympathetic, or a full-on she-devil?\n\nEva Mendes: In The Women, I play Crystal Allen and I had a blast stepping into her stilletos. On paper, she is a vicious maneater, but I tried to really understand where she was coming from. I found out that, like most women who act like she does, she’s deeply insecure. She acts out of fear and ends up hurting everyone around her, although that was never her intention. Oh yeah, she’s kind of funny too!\n\nGeorge Cukor’s 1939 film was a who’s who of Hollywood power actresses. Was there a sense when you were cast in Diane English’s 2008 version that a similar “power group” was being put together?\n\nEM: Working with these amazing women was so inspirational. Every day was a learning experience. You can’t buy that kind of experience in acting class!\n\nIn the climate of Cukor’s film, a woman stealing another woman’s husband had implications for her means of living, not only her heart — a gender imbalance that doesn’t exist today (as much). Do the stakes in a story like this change by setting it in 2008?\n\nEM: Diane English did a great job of bringing this film to 2008. I love the original, but if it were a true remake, I don’t think it would have worked. Women are at a completely different place now….thank God!\n\nYou seem to be searching for varied roles in your career so far, not only in terms of characters but in the directors you work with (Robert Rodriguez, John Singleton, the Farrelly brothers, Frank Miller, Werner Herzog). What do you hope to learn from each of these filmmakers?\n\nEM: I hope to never stop growing. I hope that with every role I play, I keep adding layers to my craft. I love acting and I study religiously with my coach Ivana Chubbuck. It’s important for me to work with a strong director because I know I can go to some really deep places, I just need direction on how to get there.\n\nYour character poster for The Spirit is arguably the best of the bunch. Years down the line, do you think Sand Saref will be one of the more iconic roles that fans remember you for? If so, why?\n\nEM: I hope not. I hope my best is yet to come!\n\n“You\n\nonly roast the ones you love,” Dane Cook explained to Rotten Tomatoes\n\nregarding\n\nhis colorful comments about\n\nMy\n\nBest Friend’s Girl‘s poster, in which he compared his Photoshopped\n\nface to a section of Britney Spears’s anatomy. “If you really, really are\n\npissed or whatever, you don’t say anything. You just tuck your tail between\n\nyour legs and you walk away.”\n\nSo Cook loves his upcoming movie (opening this Friday), in which he co-stars\n\nwith Jason Biggs, Kate Hudson, and Alec Baldwin as a jackass-for-hire who\n\ntakes women on legendarily bad dates and sends them running back to their\n\nexes. What are the other movies the comedian/actor loves, namely his five\n\nfavorite of all time? RT puts Cook under the spotlight.\n\nBestselling author Chuck Palahniuk burst onto Hollywood’s radar when his psychological novel, Fight Club, was adapted into a major motion picture directed by David Fincher; the resulting film became every American male’s aggro-fantasy (“The first rule of fight club is, you don’t talk about fight club.”) This month, the Palahniuk touch returns to cinemas via Choke, a raunchy and delightfully vulgar adaptation of his novel about a sex addict (Sam Rockwell) who cons people using the Heimlich maneuver.\n\nChuck Palahniuk took time to share his Five Favorite Films with RT. The results were morbid, to say the least. In no particular order, here are Chuck’s five favorites!\n\nBut wait, there’s more! We’ve got an exclusive clip from Choke for our RT readers, featuring Sam Rockwell as Victor and Anjelica Huston as his deranged mother, Ida.\n\nClick to check out the latest reviews, images, and trailers from Choke.\n\nSinger, actress, businesswoman…rock opera star? Paris Hilton has worn many hats during her reign as America’s most famous celebutante, but her most unexpected role is about to come. As a spoiled rich girl with a dangerous plastic surgery addiction in Darren Lynn Bousman‘s grand, Gothic rock opus Repo! The Genetic Opera, Hilton is surprising critics by taking more than a few jabs at herself — by playing a character some might call the Paris Hilton of Repo!\n\nRotten Tomatoes caught up with Hilton at the soundtrack release party for Repo! The Genetic Opera, which debuts in theaters November 7. Read on for the latest installment of Five Favorite Films with Paris Hilton!\n\nOur interview with Paris Hilton continues as we discuss her role in Repo! The Genetic Opera, how her intensive singing for the role inspired her new album, and her dream role as an actress.\n\nYou’re here because you have a role in Darren Bousman’s film, Repo! The Genetic Opera, which seems to be kind of an unusual choice for you. What kind of roles are you usually offered, and why did you choose to venture into this Goth rock opera?\n\nParis Hilton: I’m always offered basically to play myself, or another blond role, so it’s hard to really do anything with it, because it’s like, you know, whatever. So I was really honored and excited when I got the call from Darren about it because I love all the Saw movies. The fact that I was being offered such a different role was really exciting for me, and I wanted to show people that I can do a lot more than what I’ve been offered.\n\nI remember hearing Darren talk about how impressed they were at your auditions by your singing.\n\nPH: Yeah, auditions were a lot of fun. I’m so excited I got the part! I really worked hard with my voice coach; this was completely different from my last album. The music was hardcore, so I really had to train. Doing those exercises really helps, they really built up my voice. I was excited to do another album so I set up a recording studio at my house, did a whole album this summer, wrote all the songs…so that’s coming out next month.\n\nWhat kind of album will this be?\n\nPH:A lot of the songs are very tongue-in-cheek, like I’m joking around and making fun of my image a little bit. And then some songs are more serious, some are love songs, anthem kind of songs.\n\nActing-wise, what are your goals?\n\nPH:Well, people have been seeing Repo and giving great reviews, so I’ve been getting many offers and calls to do a lot. I’d like to play a total nerd, I think that would be fun.\n\nWant more 5 Favorite Films?

The Genetic Opera.\n\nComing off his most accessible comedy (Jersey Girl) and his most\n\nvulgar (Clerks 2), writer-director Kevin Smith concocts a mixture of\n\nthe two styles for his latest, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, opening\n\nthis Friday. In a film by turns thoughtful and juvenile, Seth Rogen and\n\nElizabeth Banks star as two roommates who embark on a porno shoot to pay off\n\ndebts, while slowly realizing the possibility they could be more than just\n\nfriends, roommates, and on-screen amateurs.\n\nRT spoke to Smith for his five\n\nfavorite films ever, and followed up with an interview about the process of\n\ncreating the Zack and Miri universe.\n\nOur interview with\n\nKevin Smith continues as we discuss the MPAA, the process of movie appeals, and\n\nmaking comedies during a Judd Apatow era.\n\nNow\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno is a really sweet movie.\n\nKS: Thank you.\n\nJersey Girl is also a really sweet movie, but the reaction wasn’t\n\nquite-\n\nKS: [Laughs.] No, not nearly as good.\n\nWith Judd Apatow’s productions currently the standard bearers\n\nof American comedy, do you think people are now more receptive to this mix of\n\nvulgarity and sweetness?\n\nKS: Absolutely. It felt like once 40 Year Old\n\nVirgin did over $100 million, suddenly it made the type of movie that I\n\nmake, the kind that mixes vulgar stuff with sentimental stuff, or raunchy stuff\n\nwith sweet stuff, viable. Economically viable. For years, I felt any movie that\n\nmixed raunch and sweetness couldn’t make more than $30 million. It was the best\n\nwe’ve ever done.\n\nIt was a niche thing.\n\nKS: Totally. Absolute niche. Judd blows the ceiling out,\n\ncrashes through the glass ceiling, makes over $100 million with 40 Year Old\n\nVirgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad, and suddenly it proves that\n\ngenre viable. So, that to me was a blessing. I’m like, “Right on.” Now I can\n\ntotally make Zack and Miri Make a Porno without having it on a $200,000\n\nbudget on a 50 screen release.\n\nSeth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nHas Zack and Miri‘s MPAA process given you a new\n\nenthusiasm to do [upcoming horror project] Red State?\n\nKS: [Laughs.] I don’t take as much umbrage with the\n\nMPAA fiasco, if you will, as everyone else. Like everyone else wants to scream\n\n“censorship” the minute it happens. I don’t feel that way because they’re not\n\nsaying, “Cut it or it don’t go out.” They’re saying, “If you want your rating,\n\nthe rating you want, you’re gonna have to make some changes.” So I would\n\nmuch rather deal with one governing body than deal with it on a state-by-state\n\nbasis, which is what it was before the creation of the MPAA. A movie that\n\nplayed in New York might not play in Texas, because that state’s censors could\n\nshoot it down. And I assure you, if we were going state by state, I don’t think\n\nany of my movies would have played in Texas at this point.\n\nSo I’m glad there’s only one body you have to deal with\n\nthat governs the entire country and how we view movies, as opposed to 50.\n\nThey’re also fairly generous, and as much as it’s a pain in the ass, they do\n\ngive you the option to appeal. Like, you know, they’ll tell you what your\n\nrating is, and they’ll tell you what you need to look at if you want to reach\n\nthe rating you want via cuts.\n\nOr they give you this last bite at the apple, which they\n\nreally don’t have to do. Like, if I was in charge of the MPAA, I’d be like “F–k\n\nyou, the rating is the rating. Either cut or accept that rating.” But they give\n\nyou this alternative, where you can actually go and flip it. Go above their\n\nheads to a third party altogether, and I think that’s kinda generous, man. The\n\nfact that they do that at all.\n\nI mean, to me, it is what it is. At the end of the day,\n\nit’s part of the business. If you want to be in this business, you have to be\n\nwilling to play that game. And you know, the key is finding a way to play the\n\ngame where it works in your favor. And so far we’ve gotten lucky. Three times\n\nI’ve gone to the appeals process; three times we’ve flipped it without having to\n\nmake any cuts.\n\nClerks for one.\n\nKS: Clerks. Jersey Girl they gave an\n\nR rating initially. I had to flip it to a PG-13. Clerks 2, first time we\n\nsubmitted it: R. That’s why I never thought we’d have problems on Zack and\n\nMiri because I’m like, “Nothing in this movie is nearly as outrageous as the\n\ndonkey show in Clerks 2. If they let that pass, this should be fine.” I\n\nwas wrong.\n\nHow does the appeals process work?\n\nKS: There’s a bunch of people that work on the\n\nratings board. I don’t know if they all watch every single movie or if they\n\njust use this many people and they rotate it or something.\n\nFirst, you go before the ratings board. They watch the\n\nmovie, they give you your rating. Then you could either choose to work with the\n\nratings board, try to cut it to get to your rating, or you go to the appeals\n\nprocess. The appeals process is made up of an audience that has no ratings\n\nboard members on it. There are MPAA members in the audience, people who work in\n\nthe studio system or whatnot, members of the Motion Picture Association, but\n\nthey’re not ratings board members. The other half of the audience is made up of\n\nmembers of NATO, the National Association of Theater Owners. I’ve always felt\n\nthat those members of NATO should be what the ratings board is made up of.\n\nCraig Robinson and Seth Rogen.\n\nBecause they’re the ones who exhibit the movie.\n\nKS: They are the last line of defense. They’re the\n\nones that deal with the public on a regular basis. So a guy who owns a movie\n\ntheater, an exhibitor, can tell you precisely what will get a person on their\n\nfeet, out of the theater, asking for a refund. And that’s an opinion I trust\n\nmore than some nebulous body with people who may or may not be parents of\n\nchildren who are of a young age.\n\nAnyways, the appeals screening is made up of those members\n\nof the audience. What you do is you screen the movie for them, and then you as\n\nthe filmmaker get up and you get 15 minutes to make an argument for why you feel\n\nthe movie should be rated R as opposed to NC-17. Then Joan Graves, who is the\n\nhead of the ratings board, gets up and she does 15 minutes as to why she feels\n\nthe movie is NC-17. Then you get 10 minutes to rebut her, and she gets\n\n10 minutes to rebut you. Then you two leave the room, and people take a secret\n\nballot. That’s how it all works. And you have to win by 2/3 majority. You\n\ncan’t win by one vote. So we had 14 people in our screening. If eight of them\n\nhad voted for us, we would have lost. We had to have 2/3, so we wound up\n\nwinning 10-4.\n\nZack and Miri’s film crew.\n\nNow after getting the R rating, people are taking\n\nissue with the posters.\n\nKS: It’s weird. After we won the appeal, it felt\n\nlike the MPAA got a little more stringent with our marketing materials. Like,\n\nthey started kicking back our posters and potential trailers. We had done a\n\nbunch of behind-the-scenes shorts on Clerks 2 and put them up on the\n\nInternet and ran them for almost 6 months in advance of the movie. Never once\n\nhad to approve them through anybody. We do what we want, because it’s the\n\nInternet, and who governs the Internet?\n\nWe were gonna do [the shorts] again [for Zack and Miri,\n\nand] this time around, the MPAA told us that we couldn’t run without getting\n\nthem approved by the MPAA first. The MPAA’s manifest is they have approval over\n\nall movies and of signatory members of the MPAA. A studio has to be a signatory\n\nMPAA member [and] most studios are. All of them are, as a matter of fact. But\n\n[the MPAA] also governs the marketing material. So in the same way that they’re\n\nlike, “We can tell you what can go in a trailer that plays on TV, we can also\n\ntell you these can or cannot be played on the Internet.” And that’s the first\n\ntime I’ve ever encountered that.\n\nSuddenly, after years of ignoring the Internet, they’re now\n\npaying attention. So all those [shorts] had to get rated through them as well,\n\nand that was kind of weird. They were insisting that we install an age gate on\n\nthe site. An age gate is ridiculous. Anybody can beat an age gate. You don’t\n\neven have to be Einstein to beat an age gate. You’re just f–king picking a\n\ndate that makes you 18 or older. And in a world where you can jump to a porno\n\nsite and watch a 15-second mpeg of people f–king without clicking an age gate,\n\nhow are you protecting people from anything, you know? It’s like, this movie is\n\na comedy. It’s not true porn, you know. All the f–king is fake, and silly at\n\nthat. What about the real porn over here? But they’re like, “We’re not in\n\ncharge of that. We’re only in charge of movies.” Because no parent calls up the MPAA to say, like, “My kid saw something weird on largelabia.com.”\n\nI’ll be honest with you, I’m shocked they’ve let it go as\n\nlong as they have. The one thing I’m really terrified about is when they start\n\nrating the extras on a DVD. So far, people have left that alone. Jersey Girl\n\nwas a PG-13 movie. Those two commentary tracks are R, if not worse. And some of\n\nthe features we had on it were definitely not PG-13-friendly. So for years\n\nyou’ve been able to do that. I’m scared that one day those cats are gonna start\n\nturning on home video as well and being like, “We have to rate all the extras on\n\nthe disc.” So you could conceivably have a PG movie with R-rated extras. So as\n\nlong as they leave that alone, I’m fine.\n\nLargely, I don’t make PG-13 movies, so it doesn’t matter.\n\nIf most of my [DVD extra] content was rated R, the movies are usually rated R,\n\nso I’m okay with it. But, you know, [a potential MPAA crackdown] will prevent\n\nthings like that Jersey Girl commentary track from happening. Which, you\n\nknow, let’s be honest, wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world. It wouldn’t be\n\nthe collapse of the American infrastructure. But it is kinda vexing.\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno opens in theaters this Friday.\n\nWant more 5 Favorite Films? Check out previous installments with Chuck Palahniuk, Dane Cook, Eva Mendes, and Judd Apatow.\n\nAfter a steady ascension to leading man status through cult TV work\n\n(Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared) and supporting roles (Anchorman, The 40 Year\n\nOld Virgin), Seth Rogen fulfils another Hollywood dream this week:\n\nheadlining a Kevin Smith movie, reported to have been Rogen’s goal when\n\nstarting out in L.A. He stars in Smith’s\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno along\n\nwith Elizabeth Banks as one of two roommates who embark on a porno shoot to\n\npay off debts, while slowly realizing the possibility they could be more\n\nthan just friends, roommates, and on-screen amateurs.\n\nRT spoke to Rogen for his five favorite films ever (click\n\nhere for Monday’s\n\nFive Favorites article with Kevin Smith), and followed up with an interview\n\nabout Zack and Miri, opening this Friday.\n\nOur interview with\n\nSeth Rogen continues as we discuss his upcoming projects, including The Green\n\nHornet and Judd Apatow’s Funny People.\n\nFreaks and Geeks is now a show that means a lot to people. When fans\n\ntalk to you, do you feel like you’re required to be knowledgeable about the\n\nshow, Star Trek-style?\n\nSR: I’m not that familiar with some of the episodes\n\nbecause I’m not in all of them. [Laughs.] I actually have not seen the ones I’m\n\nnot in as many times as the [ones I am in]. But, no, [the fans] are nice, and I\n\nknow it pretty well. I feel that I don’t disappoint those people too much.\n\nSo among your upcoming projects is writing a Simpsons episode.\n\nSR:\n\nYeah, we did it.\n\nWhen is it airing?\n\nSR: I don’t know. It takes a while to\n\nanimate them. It was the greatest thing we ever did. It was the smartest idea we\n\never had, trying to do that. The greatest day of my life.\n\nAnd you also voiced a character?\n\nSR: Yeah. You do it all together, which is amazing. The\n\nwhole cast is in one room. So it’s me and Homer…you’re talking to Dan\n\nCastellaneta!\n\nSeth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nConsidering animated films now record everything\n\nseparately, it surprises me The Simpsons still records in a single room.\n\nSR: Surprised me too. I can’t believe they\n\ndo it like that. I haven’t even met half the people [I co-star with] in\n\n[animated] films.\n\nAnd [the episode] is really funny. I think. I hope. I hope it’s a good one. The\n\nfact that we came up with an idea at all that they hadn’t done before was\n\nshocking. And I just got the script in the mail signed by the whole cast and I’m\n\nall, “This is the f–king best thing we ever did.”\n\nBefore you came on board for The Green Hornet, Kevin Smith was attached\n\nto the project. Did you discuss your versions during the Zack and Miri shoot?\n\nSR: Yeah, I asked him what his version was. I told him what we were\n\ndoing. It seems that we have totally different takes. They’re totally different\n\nmovies. I had no idea that he was ever involved with it when we first came on.\n\nIt’s funny. Funny how things work out. But it’s happened before. I’ve been fired\n\nfrom movies that my friends are later hired on. Everyone knows each other. It’s\n\nbound to happen. [Laughs.]\n\nRight now you’re filming Funny People, rumored to\n\nbe more dramatic than comedic?\n\nSR: I don’t know if I’d say it’s more\n\ndrama than comedy. I’d say [there’s] more drama than our movies generally have.\n\nBut it’s still played pretty funny. I feel just the nature of having Adam\n\nSandler in every scene is [making] it funny. But it definitely is about\n\nsomething more serious, in that it deals with death in a lot of ways. It’s a\n\nreally interesting tone. Normally, our movies balance sweet storyline with the\n\ndirty jokes, but this one seems to balance more dark, depressing storyline with\n\nthe dirty jokes.\n\nCraig Robinson and Seth Rogen.\n\nWith the dramatic elements in Freaks and Geeks and\n\nKnocked Up, is Funny People not actually that big of a leap anyways?\n\nSR: I do feel like I’ve done quite a bit\n\nof drama. [The upcoming film] Observe and Report also has a lot of very dramatic stuff in it, so\n\nthat was good preparation. I think it’s actually easier to do drama to be\n\nhonest. Like, because, you just…you just don’t have to try to be funny.\n\n[Laughs.] For me to act natural and real but also try to be funny while doing\n\nthat [is hard].\n\nWhy was The Green Hornet the project that convinced\n\nyou to work out? Had it ever come up before with any other roles that you should\n\nget into shape?\n\nSR: No, it never had. [Laughs.] No, it\n\njust never came up really. [Laughs.] I honestly think it serves the movie more.\n\nI don’t need to be in incredible shape for it. But it’s definitely served by [a\n\nhero] who’s into his image, a guy who’s a little more physical attentive than\n\nsome of my other characters. A guy who physically who just has to do a lot of\n\nstuff.\n\nWhen was it known that Stephen Chow was going to\n\ndirect in addition to co-starring?\n\nSR: It was simultaneous. We sent him the\n\nscript. We said, “The world is yours. Tell us what you want your involvement to\n\nbe, and that’s what it’ll be.” He wrote back that he wanted to direct it and be\n\nKato. And that was it.\n\nWas Chow familiar with your work when you sent him\n\nthe script?\n\nSR: I think maybe he was familiar with\n\nThe Green Hornet. And then he heard that a comedian was involved in it. I think\n\nhe had heard of our movies but I don’t know if he had seen them. He has seen\n\nthem all now, and he’s liked them. Enough to read the script, I guess. And we\n\ngot along really well.\n\nAnd vice-versa: how familiar were you with Chow’s\n\nwork?\n\nSR: I remember when Shaolin Soccer came\n\nout. I saw Kung Fu Hustle and that was the first I really saw of him. And it\n\njust blew my mind. And then I went back and watched all the other stuff, God of\n\nCookery and all that.\n\nSeth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nHow did you originally get involved with The Green\n\nHornet?\n\nSR: You know, you tell your agent, “We\n\nwant to work on our next movie. Is there anything out there that’s interesting?”\n\nShe’ll tell you one ten things and one of them’s The Green Hornet. “Oh,\n\n[producer] Neal\n\nMoritz has the rights to The Green Hornet. Maybe you can pitch an idea to the\n\nwriters. Maybe you can pitch an idea if you have one.” Me and [writing\n\npartner] Evan [Goldberg] knew of The\n\nGreen Hornet, we liked it. I wasn’t, like, f–king crazy about it or anything.\n\nBut we’ve always wanted to write a movie about a hero and his sidekick. And we\n\nalways thought that was an interesting story. And one that’s never been told\n\nwell. It’s a funny relationship. And we thought that’d be the perfect one to do\n\nthat with. Get the one thing where the sidekick’s more famous than the hero.\n\nLike, everyone knows Bruce Lee. We just pitched our idea. And I could be him in\n\nthis version because it’s about not really being your traditional hero. He needs\n\n[Kato]. He can’t do it on his own.\n\nIn the new wave of superhero movies, you can’t have\n\na sidekick anymore.\n\nSR: Exactly!\n\nDo you think a superhero/sidekick movie is\n\ninherently funny or campy?\n\nSR: Yes. It’s impossible for that\n\nrelationship to not be slightly comedic. It just by nature is. That is why we\n\nalways wanted to make a movie about that. And our movies are all about\n\nrelationships. That’s where we always start. From Pineapple Express to Superbad,\n\nas dumb and weird as those movies are, we always start with the relationship.\n\nAgain, yeah, we were huge comic book fans, but with this, it seemed like our way\n\nin. It seemed like, “Ah, we get to make a comic book superhero movie, but it’s\n\nalso based on a relationship.” And that’s something we know how to make movies\n\nabout.\n\nAnd not that many people are fans of it. Which is also good. There’s very few\n\npeople to piss off. No one knows s–t about The Green Hornet.\n\nThere’s four guys on a message board who are out for blood.\n\nSR: [Laughs.] There’s four guys who are\n\nreal pissed off about it, and f–k those guys. Who cares, you know? The fact\n\nthat anyone right now is excited about a Green Hornet movie is a miracle. Like,\n\nit is unbelievable that we somehow got people talking about The Green Hornet.\n\nZack and Miri Make a Porno opens in theaters this Friday.\n\nWant more 5 Favorite Films?

After co-writing two direct-to-DVD animated Hellboy films (one of which was nominated for a Primetime Emmy), Mignola reunited with comrade-in-arms del Toro to pen an original sequel to their successful first Hellboy film, infusing the familiar world of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense with a distinctly folkloric twist. The result, Hellboy II: The Golden Army, opened this summer to a Certified Fresh 88 percent Tomatometer score and comes to DVD this week.\n\nRT spoke with Mike Mignola to learn his Five Favorite Films of all time, which appropriately span the cinematic landscape where art meets horror. (Stay tuned for Guillermo del Toro’s Five Favorite Films to see which beloved movie both Hellboy artists share in common!)\n\nClick for behind-the-scenes images from Hellboy II.For more on Hellboy II: The Golden Army, click here.\n\nWith a reputation for excellence in the realms of fantasy and horror, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro brought a visionary touch to such critically-acclaimed films as Pan’s Labyrinth, The Devil’s Backbone, Cronos, and last year’s The Orphanage, which he produced. When del Toro turned his attentions to Dark Horse Comics’ Hellboy franchise in 2004 — infusing the big, horned anti-hero with a distinct sense of style and wit — fans and critics were summarily delighted, and the reins came loose for a bigger and more fantastical sequel. Hellboy II: The Golden Army surpassed the critical and box office performances of its predecessor and is Certified Fresh at 88 percent on the Tomatometer.\n\nRotten Tomatoes caught up with del Toro at the Hellboy II: The Golden Army DVD/Blu-ray Launch Party, where, in signature self-deprecating fashion, he guided those in attendance through the immersive Hellboy II Blu-ray experience. More importantly, del Toro announced plans to join fans in a ground-breaking BD-Live chat event (November 23rd at 6pm PST), where Blu-ray owners can log in and ask him their most burning questions. Except for, say, his favorite movies of all time; we’ve got that covered below.\n\nRead on for Guillermo del Toro‘s Five Favorite Films (click for the Five Favorite Films of Hellboy II star Doug Jones and Hellboy comics creator Mike Mignola, who shared at least one top movie with del Toro himself)…\n\nClick for images from Guillermo del Toro’s Hellboy II production diary!For more on Hellboy II: The Golden Army, click here.\n\nThanks to a teen phenomenon called Twilight, Robert Pattinson has gone from being a little-known Brit actor (best known as the handsome, ill-fated Cedric Diggory in two Harry Potter films) to having his face plastered across every major magazine, television show, and website known to man. Or at least, every one of them known to teenage girls. This Friday, thousands of Pattinson’s admiring fans will have the pleasure of finally watching the teen vampire romance that has launched their favorite new teen idol into the stratosphere, as he stars opposite Kristen Stewart as Edward Cullen, the dreamiest undead boyfriend of the year in Catherine Hardwicke‘s (Thirteen, Lords of Dogtown) adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s best-selling novel.\n\nBut there’s more than Tiger Beat fodder to the 22-year-old actor; after the Twilight frenzy peaks this week (with fans and Summit Entertainment suits crossing their fingers for a breakout box office to justify a multi-sequel franchise) Pattinson will appear next March as a young Salvador Dali in Little Ashes (click for images)– a period piece that might test the ardor of Pattinson’s Twilight fan base — and the indie outsider pic How to Be, which will likely pick up distribution in the wake of Twilight. Pattinson’s artful leanings came out in a conversation with Rotten Tomatoes about his favorite films of all time, which span such cinematic luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Jean-Luc Godard, and…Chris Kattan?\n\nRead on for Five Favorite Films with Twilight‘s Robert Pattinson.\n\nCheck out more info on Robert Pattinson here, and view pictures and trailers from Twilight.

This week Statham returns to one of his best-known characters in Transporter 3: Frank Martin, the black market driver with a “no questions asked” policy and a knack for kicking ass without leaving so much as a wrinkle on his tailored designer suits.\n\nWhile the first Transporter film (2002) was directed by acclaimed martial arts choreographer Corey Yuen, French director Louis Letterier took the helm for its follow-up, Transporter 2 (2005). This week newcomer Olivier Megaton takes the wheel for a bigger, faster Transporter 3, with Yuen returning to choreograph a leaner (and often shirtless) Statham in the film’s impressive action sequences.\n\nRotten Tomatoes spoke to Statham about his favorite films of all time, which surprisingly include a few Paul Newman classics and unsurprisingly include a Bruce Lee film. As our conversation continued, we also discussed the different feel of Transporter 3, Corey Yuen’s diminished role in the film’s action scenes, and his recently announced film, The Expendables, in which he’ll star with action legends Sylvester Stallone (who will also write and direct) and Jet Li.\n\nNext: Jason Statham on Transporter 3, Corey Yuen’s diminished involvement, and his plans to team up with Sly Stallone and Jet Li.\n\nI hear you visit Rotten Tomatoes…\n\nJason Statham: Sometimes, yeah! You’re making all these films, and sometimes – hey, listen, it can be quite depressing or it can give you a big head for all the wrong reasons. So I don’t know whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, but sometimes you spend so many hours making these films…people are going to give an opinion on them, and everyone’s entitled to an opinion. There’s always good and there’s always bad. So it’s best not to take it too seriously, but at the same time it’s nice to know people support what you’re doing, and at the same time you also get the ol’ custard pie. “That was a piece of crap!” But at the end of the day, no one tries to make a bad movie. And people really do work hard. And there are a lot of people involved. And sometimes it doesn’t end up the way it was supposed to end up. So to think that some people just say, “Well that was a piece of shit…” It’s quite harsh when you read that. But at the end of the day, it’s just us trying to do good.\n\nAnd you’re just a part of the whole picture…\n\nJS: Yeah, you’re not solely responsible for the finished product. But it is what it is; people like feedback.\n\nThe Bank Job got great reviews.\n\nJS: I know! I was like, hey, somebody likes a movie of mine!\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1197818&MapTypeID=2&photo=12&legacy=1[/rtimage]You mentioned how influential Bruce Lee was to you; in many of the scenes in your movies, but especially in Transporter 3, you seem to be going for such a precise physicality that is reminiscent of Bruce Lee’s lightning-quick moves and poses.\n\nJS: Oh, God. Bruce Lee was just so lightning-fast. People try to emulate him in whatever way they can, but to try and do what he was doing…you’re just inspired by it; you’re not trying to say, look, I can do that. No one can do what he did.\n\nAnd Corey Yuen, by the way, is the one that creates all these sequences. [Yuen directed the first Transporter film, served as second unit director on Transporter 2, and choreographed the action in Transporter 3.] He’s ultimately responsible for those choreographed pieces.\n\nNow, Corey directed the first Transporter; the second film was by Louis Leterrier (Incredible Hulk). In the third Transporter, you’ve got a new director, Olivier Megaton. How different has it been working from movie to movie with these different directors?\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1197818&MapTypeID=2&photo=11&legacy=1[/rtimage]JS: think it’s difficult, because this time the action sequences took on a bit of a different twist. Normally Corey Yuen gets to edit the sequences; because he creates them, he’s responsible for the snip, snip, snip, and puts them together in his own musical way. But this time, Olivier – who’s obviously the director – he wanted to give it a new twist, a fresh twist, and basically put them together in what he saw as the best way. It’s only down to individual taste, really. I don’t know whether it was better…I hope it was.\n\nBut Corey still choreographed the sequences?\n\nJS: Yes, but usually if you choreograph it, you usually edit it, too. But you know, Olivier has a very certain style of filmmaking, and it’s very stylistic and cool; I think he’s done a great job. But it is very different to the previous two. A lot faster; doesn’t have the silky-smooth feel. A little bit of timing was lost. But at the same time, some people like that; it’s a little more contemporary. It’s all about flavor, it’s all about what you like.\n\nCan you talk a bit about The Expendables, which was just announced?\n\nJS: Yeah, we’re gonna team up with Sly, who’s going to write, direct and star in The Expendables movie and I’m going along for the ride. With Jet Li as well! It’ll be a powerhouse combo – get out of the way, motherf***ers! (laughs) That’s what it should be called.\n\nWill you be fighting each other?\n\nJS: No, we’ll be on the same squad. There’ll be some ass to be kicked. I’m looking forward to it.\n\nWant more Five Favorite Films?

And who better to portray the conflicting identities of American spy and fundamentalist defector than the Oscar-nominated Cheadle, one of a handful of actors capable of sympathetically depicting such hot-button polarities?\n\nRotten Tomatoes spoke via email with Cheadle about his favorite films, his interest in Traitor, his thoughts on Darfur and more. Traitor is released on DVD December 19.\n\n“I don’t have five favorite films. My affinity for them changes as I change over the course of my life from child to student to professional to husband and father, etc. All the films that follow are not in any order nor etched in stone, but here goes.“\n\n— Don Cheadle\n\nNext: Don Cheadle explains why he was drawn to Traitor, his thoughts on the future of Darfur, and one of his favorite performances.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1192419&MapTypeID=2&photo=6&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nWhy was Traitor an important film to make in today’s political (and filmmaking) climate?\n\nDon Cheadle: I don’t know that I would use the word “important.” I leave that up to the viewer. It caught my interest because it dealt with a complex issue in a way that wasn’t as black and white as other offerings in the genre.\n\nThe world is a much more complicated place than it used to be, and film audiences have grown more interested in morally ambiguous heroes. Is that a good thing?\n\nDC: I think it’s good that people are more open to characters that are complicated, in a certain kind of film experience that is. I think people still want clear good guys and bad guys in the tent pole blockbusters but are more amenable to the grey areas. Most of us live there anyway.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1192419&MapTypeID=2&photo=1&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nYou’ve helped to raise the issue of genocide in Darfur. Although there’s been an increase in attention on the region, the violence continues. What needs to be done there?\n\nDC: A lot needs to be done and hopefully with this new administration, more will be. We need to engage in a very robust and committed negotiation process that brings everybody to the table while also protecting the innocent as well as seeking justice. We need to be in support of the ICC [International Criminal Court] and get behind the indictments that the court has requested.\n\nWe fondly remember your guest starring role on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” as Will’s friend, Ice Tray. What role would you name as your funniest performance? What is your favorite early role?\n\nDC: My funniest performance…? That is a question for you. I don’t really like watching my own films too much. I had a very good time working on Rebound [The Legend of Earl ‘The Goat’ Manigault].\n\nWant more Five Favorite Films? Check out previous installments with Robert Pattinson, Kevin Smith, Guillermo del Toro, and Judd Apatow.\n\nNothing But the Truth director Rod Lurie (The Contender)\n\ntook a circuitous route to Hollywood — he was an army officer and an\n\nentertainment reporter before perching himself in the director’s chair. He’s\n\nalso an engaging conversationalist, full of insight on the key issues of the\n\nday, especially where the worlds of film, politics, and journalism collide.\n\nIn Lurie’s latest film, Nothing But the Truth, Rachel Armstrong (Kate\n\nBeckinsale), a reporter for a fictional Washington newspaper, is jailed after\n\nrevealing the identity of Erica Van Doren (Vera Farmiga), a CIA agent who’s\n\nmarried to a government official critical of a U.S. attack on Venezuela.\n\nArmstrong’s imprisonment takes a toll on her family life, while Van Doren and\n\nspecial prosecutor Patton Dubois (Matt Dillon) try to find the source of the\n\nleak. The film has a number of parallels to the real-life cases of Judith Miller\n\nand Valerie Plame, although Lurie says he was not trying to make a fictionalized\n\naccount of their stories. Rather, he wanted to make a thriller that examined the\n\npersonal toll on these two women.\n\nIn an interview with RT, Lurie not only waxed poetic on his favorite movies, he\n\nalso discussed his approach to melding fact and fiction, and bemoaned the\n\ncurrent state of the mass media.\n\nNext: Rod Lurie talks about mass media, film distribution, and the politics\n\nof awards season.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202524&MapTypeID=2&photo=5&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nIt’s really interesting that you started off this whole thing with a\n\ndiscussion of All the President’s Men, because that harkens back to a\n\ntime when the general public thought of journalists as heroes, after Watergate.\n\nIn the current climate in which Nothing But the Truth finds itself, not\n\nonly are newspapers folding left and right, but there’s a general distrust of\n\nthe mainstream media?\n\nRod Lurie: I think there is a good reason for that. As\n\ncorporations started buying up newspapers and magazines and television stations,\n\nthe need for profit overwhelmed every other aspect of that business, which was\n\nnot the case years ago. The networks looked at news divisions as loss leaders,\n\nand they felt, “Really, no problem, as long as we got it right and we did well.”\n\nBut the need for profit has forced all of these organizations to get the widest\n\npossible audience that they can, and one of the ways to do it is to become\n\npartisan, to know that you’re gonna get all the Republicans to watch Fox, and\n\nthe vast majority of liberals are gonna watch MSNBC. As a result, this\n\npartisanship has created a bias in the news. That bias, then angers a gigantic\n\nsection of the population. It never was that Walter Cronkite had people who\n\nhated what he stood for. At the same time he was on, people didn’t hate John\n\nChancellor, or Harry Reasoner, or Howard K. Smith. But now, people really have\n\nanimus toward Sean Hannity on the right, or Chris Matthews, say, on the left.\n\nThey’re calling themselves journalists, and that’s not really what they are.\n\nThey’re just more politically–oriented Andy Rooneys. The bias has found its way\n\ninto the reporting of news.\n\nI’ll tell you what: I’m a lefty, so let me take away my own bias and attack\n\nthe New York Times for a second. If you look like something like that\n\nstory about McCain having a mistress, or maybe she wasn’t a mistress, or they\n\nweren’t sure what she was but they had to report somethingâ€¦In the old days, this\n\narticle never would have been published, because there wasn’t enough information\n\nto report what they said were the facts. In today’s world, in order to feed\n\ntheir liberal readership, they plastered it on the front page.\n\nIn Nothing But the Truth, there are a lot of parallels to\n\nthe cases of Judith Miller and Valerie Plame, but you twisted it a bit. When you\n\nheard those stories, what did you want to leave in, and what did you want to\n\ntake out when making this film?\n\nRL: Whenever you make a movie, when it’s done, as a\n\nfilmmaker, you never sit there and say, “Boy, I really got that right.” It’s, “Where did I screw up?” I’ve not confessed to anyone yet, but I really feel,\n\nafter having read a lot of reviews of the film — which have been overwhelmingly\n\npositive — but those negative ones, every one of them make objection to the\n\nfact that we have quote-unquote “gotten wrong” the Judith Miller sorry, or that\n\nwe have romanticized Judith Miller in some way, who by most people’s accounts is\n\nnot a glamorous figure. I never intended for this to be a roman a clef\n\nof Judy Miller versus Valerie Plame. What I wanted to do was to take their\n\nsituation and put completely different characters in it, and see how different\n\nhuman beings would behave in their situation. Of course, the story goes wildly\n\noff the Plame story. But I dug myself a bit of a hole having enough parallels\n\nthat some of the lazier critics or some of the critics who have a political bias\n\ncould use that against the film. It probably would have been wise of me not to\n\nmake it a CIA agent. I could have made it some other sort of national security\n\n[employee]. Maybe I shouldn’t have made her the wife of an ambassador. Most\n\npeople seem to seem to think it’s a high quality film, particularly for its\n\nperformances, [but] they’ve been sidetracked by [the facts versus the fictions].\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202524&MapTypeID=2&photo=2&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nWith this film and The Contender, are you attempting to\n\nprovide a civics lesson — for lack of a better term — within the framework of\n\na thriller?\n\nRL: The answer to that is not just no, but unequivocally no.\n\nI don’t think I’m equipped enough to be giving anyone a civics lesson, or any\n\nkind of message. What I’m trying to do with both The Contender and Nothing\n\nBut the Truth is to try to find entertaining stories that could come out of\n\n“what-if” situations with regard to things that really happen in the world. For\n\nexample, in The Contender, a lot of people thought it was influenced by\n\nthe Monica Lewinsky scandal. In fact, it was influenced by me watching the\n\nClarence Thomas hearings and thinking, “Could you imagine if this person was a\n\nwoman, and this woman had to answer all these sexual questions, and how un f—-ing\n\ncomfortable that would be?” It would be outrageous. And I thought, “That’s a\n\ngood movie!”\n\nIn the case of Nothing But the Truth, its real genesis was I was\n\ngonna do an episode on a smaller lever of this for Commander in Chief.\n\nBut I was fired, and Steven Bochco came in and killed it. So I really wanted to\n\ndo a story of a journalist in jail for protecting their source. When Miller and\n\nPlame happened, I didn’t really follow their case, but I really wondered what\n\nwould happen if these were both moms, and their kids went to school together and\n\nthey had some sort of connective tissue between them. Once I started thinking\n\nabout that, the dominoes started falling into place. In fact, I wrote the ending\n\nfirst. I felt it was a very a very cool and interesting idea to put the lead\n\ncharacter into an impossible situation.\n\nAs someone who came out of the world of journalism, what do you think\n\nthe future holds for newspapers?\n\nRL: I think with the print newspaper business, it is\n\nempirically obvious that it’s going the way of a disaster. I’ve noticed Rolling\n\nStone has literally shrunk from its classic large size. The New York\n\nTimes has also physically shrunk, and there are layoffs left and right.\n\nIt’s really a shame to me, because in 30 years my grandchildren probably won’t\n\nknow what a newspaper is. It’s rather stunning, and not good for the\n\ndissemination of news, because there seems to be a less thoughtful and\n\ncalculated amount of research and investigation done by purely internet-run\n\npublications.\n\nNow, I love the internet. I’m on it all f—ing day long. I do read my print\n\nnewspaper in the morning, but all day long, I’m on the Internet. I love the\n\naccess to information, I like to be able to find anything I want, but there are\n\na couple things you don’t find that you’d be able to find in a print newspaper.\n\nA newspaper will run a lead story that will go 2,500 to 3,000 words filled with\n\ninformation. Being able to physically hold the newspaper and read it over a cup\n\nof coffee at a diner lends itself to that. Stories of that length just don’t\n\nappear on the internet almost ever. It’s kind of a shame; I wish both worlds\n\ncould coincide, but the internet has put a dagger in the heart of newspapers in\n\nmany ways.\n\nThe Contender came out at the tail end of the Clinton\n\nadministration, and Nothing But the Truth is being released at the end\n\nof the Bush administration. Are you optimistic about the current state of\n\naffairs?\n\nRL: It seems to me that even the people on the\n\nright seem to be watching Obama perform in the transition, and they’re putting\n\ntheir fingers on their chin and they’re saying, “You know, let’s give this guy a\n\nchance. Maybe there is something here after all.” I think there is a tremendous\n\namount of hopefulness. Now, I say this at the exact moment when the company\n\nthat’s releasing Nothing But the Truth, [Yari Film Group], last Friday\n\nwent into chapter 11 bankruptcy. And I’m seeing my own film, as far as the\n\nimmediate distribution beyond this qualifying run get obliterated. And I’m\n\nseeing almost everyone at the Yari Film Group being fired, and these are people\n\nI really like. And it’s all part of the economy that George Bush sank us into.\n\nI’m hoping the confidence that the economy that the world seems to have for Obama is going to help our economy. Too late for my film, but people are having\n\nfar worse problems.\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nRL: Well, if I tell you, it’s gonna open up a line of\n\nquestioning that’s gonna take foreverâ€¦. I’m remaking Straw Dogs.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202524&MapTypeID=2&photo=4&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nWhat’s the new take, given that a lot of what Sam Peckinpah was doing\n\nin that film is very much of its time?\n\nRL: It was very much of its time, because it was about a\n\nliberal anti-Vietnam guy who goes into an Irish town where he discovers he’s\n\ncapable of as much brutality and violence as those who he’d had objection to. I\n\ncertainly admire Peckinpah’s movie, but anyone who watches it objectively — and\n\ncertainly if they take the mythology about Peckinpah out of it — would find it\n\nto be a film that’s more notorious than it is great.\n\nWhen you’re making a film, do you ever think of awards recognition?\n\nRL: I’ll be honest with you: the answer is yes, for Kate Beckinsale, and Vera Farmiga and Alan Alda in particular. I think the movie’s\n\nimpeccably acted. And in fact, both of them {Beckinsale and Farmiga] are both in\n\nthe mix; the both got nominated for the Critic’s Choice Awards. Here’s the\n\nthing: the awards at the end of the year are absolutely driven by the ability to\n\nfinance a very aggressive marketing campaign. In today’s New York Times,\n\nthe ad for Revolutionary Road runs six full pages. That must be\n\n$500,000 to $750,000 ad in just the New York Times. The truth is the\n\nYari Film Group couldn’t get anyone to see the film. What can you do when you’re\n\na tiny distributor with a high level film, and you’re sending out screeners, and\n\n[a critic] gets a screener for Nothing But the Truth, but at the same\n\ntime you’re getting Benjamin Button and Doubt and Revolutionary\n\nRoad and Slumdog Millionaire. These movies just have major\n\nfinancial clout behind them. I contacted about a third of the Broadcast film\n\ncritics just to make sure they were looking at the film, and almost everyone I\n\nspoke to said they had the screener but they hadn’t gotten around to it, which\n\nmeant they weren’t gonna see it before they voted. And I asked them just to look\n\nat the film, and they looked at the film and voted for the women.

It’s a story not lost on critics and pundits, who place Rourke’s washed-up ex-ring champ Randy “The Ram” Robinson among the year’s best performances; the tragic portrait of a proud man living in the shadow of his former glory has proven a much-needed career redemption for Rourke, for whom success had been elusive in the decades since Diner and Rumble Fish.\n\nMickey Rourke spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about his favorite films of all time, and also reflected on the great reception that The Wrestler (and his own performance, for which he’s received a Golden Globe nomination) has enjoyed. “It’s a movie I’m very proud of,” Rourke said. “It’s the best movie I’ve ever made, the hardest movie I’ve ever made. I think Darren Aronofsky is one of the best directors I’ve ever worked with. I’d put him right up there with [Michael] Cimino, [Francis Ford] Coppola and Adrian Lyne.”\n\nThe Wrestler is currently in limited release and is Certified Fresh at 98 percent on the Tomatometer.\n\nFor the latest reviews, trailers, and news on The Wrestler, click here.\n\nWant more Five Favorite Films?

Goyer (Batman Begins, the Blade trilogy) has held close associations to the comic book genre — he’s currently awaiting the green light on his script for X-Men Origins: Magneto — but took a break from adapting superhero tales to write and direct an original horror story. The result is this week’s The Unborn, a PG-13 supernatural thriller about a doe eyed co-ed named Casey (Cloverfield‘s Odette Yustman) haunted by an ancient Jewish dybbuk, or demon.\n\nUnlike many contemporary horror films, The Unborn opts for old-fashioned suspense over gore and treads ground rare for its genre; twin studies, Nazi experimentation, Jewish mysticism and even the abortion debate pop up thematically throughout Goyer’s tale, which also stars Meagan Good, Gary Oldman, and Cam Gigandet.\n\nRotten Tomatoes spoke with Goyer about his other extra-cinematic influences, how he developed The Unborn through his own personal fascinations, and whether or not the film is meant to spark the pro-life vs. pro-choice debate. He also shared his Five Favorite Films, noting that his choices are ever-changing and perhaps surprising. “Those aren’t necessarily the kinds of films I might make,” Goyer explained. “But that’s okay — I think people are more complex. We’re not just little sound bites.”\n\nNext: Goyer discusses his influences outside of film and how his creative process took him from twins to Nazi science to demons and beyond…\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202166&MapTypeID=2&photo=8&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nRotten Tomatoes: You’re known for your love of comic books, and how it’s influenced your filmmaking, but I’m sure that’s not the only medium you love.\n\nDavid Goyer: Oh, no. I still read comic books, but they aren’t the only things. I’m a voracious reader.\n\nRT: What other kinds of art influence you?\n\nDG: Well, I like documentary filmmaking very much — I’m a big fan of that. Photography, modern art, things like that — I love to travel, so I like historical and cultural art. Just last year, I went to Vietnam and Cambodia for about five weeks and immersed myself in that world. In college, I minored in poetry, so I pull from all over the place.\n\nRT: One of the most striking aspects of The Unborn is how detailed it is, and how it delves into areas like Jewish mysticism, religion, and other layered themes that are developed.\n\nDG: Well, I like even my genre movies to have a lot of historical underpinnings and research. There’s probably a lot more in there than you might realize. I hope it catches that air of authenticity — at least it helps me when I’m writing. So even if the imagery isn’t explicitly stated, a lot of the imagery comes from [historical research] — like the dream where she’s on the ceiling and looking down on herself, that comes from the idea that in olden days, Jewish people believed that their souls would go wandering while they were sleeping, so when they woke up, they’d say a prayer like Jane Alexander does in the movie for being thankful that nothing sort of unwelcome inhabited their body while their souls were out wandering. So the imagery of that dream comes from that, and obviously there’s the subtext of this thing crawling into [Casey’s] womb…\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202166&MapTypeID=2&photo=2&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nRT: It seems that a lot of what you explore in this movie comes from your own deep personal interests, such as the fascination with twins.\n\nDG: Sure.\n\nRT: Was it the same with Jewish folklore?\n\nDG: You know, it’s not like I was steeped in Jewish folklore. It started with the idea of the twins first, and that led me to researching heterochromia — the changing of the color of the iris — which is the condition that the lead character suffers from in the film, and that led me to the experiments that Dr. Mengele was doing in Auschwitz, which coincidentally also had to do with twins. That led me to the legend of the dybbuk, which in turn led me to all the imagery of the mirrors. So it wasn’t like I started off thinking I was going to make a movie about Jewish mysticism. I just kind of started with an idea, and started doing research, and let myself wander. One by one, the elements just sort of fell into place with one another. I was trying to see if I could kind of craft a new legend, at least filmically, because I don’t know that anyone had done a dybbuk story before, and it’s a different take on possession and exorcism. Ironically, most people’s perceptions of exorcism come from the Friedkin film, of course, but the tradition dates back five or six thousand years and actually originated in the Jewish faith, long before it started in the Christian or Catholic faith.\n\nNext: On dybbuks, Holocaust guilt, and whether or not The Unborn overtly addresses the abortion debate….\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202166&MapTypeID=2&photo=3&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nRT: Your characters talk about how the idea of demons —\n\nDG: Predates organized religion. Well, they would. I always thought it was funny that you’d hold up a cross and Dracula would shy away from it, because it seems to me that evil isn’t Jewish or Muslim or Christian. In fact, I had a character say that in the film.\n\nRT: There’s also the idea in the movie that younger generations are detached from their heritage, that Casey not only doesn’t practice the Jewish faith but also is unaware of the dybbuk that has cursed her family for generations.\n\nDG: Well, it’s a subtext. They’re detached from their lineage, they’re detached from their heritage, they’re detached from their families, and that makes them more vulnerable, because there’s not as much of a sense of community. It’s all subtext, but it’s in there, yeah. Absolutely.\n\nRT: What about Holocaust survivor’s guilt, and the idea that Casey now becomes responsible for setting right things that began so long ago?\n\nDG: Well, I could make a joke about Jewish guilt, but yeah, that’s in there a little bit too. The grandmother has survivor’s guilt, and she unintentionally passes it along to her daughter, who does the same to her granddaughter. I think there’s this sense that in reality, whether it’s genetics or learned behavior, that generations tend to pass these things on to successive generations, and whether we know it or not, we’re often dealing with things that happened three or four generations prior to us. Hopefully, people will watch the movie and it’ll make them think about these things in different ways.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202166&MapTypeID=2&photo=6&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nRT: Another underlying theme that persisted for me was the question of whether this is a pro-life or pro-choice film.\n\nDG: It isn’t meant to be either. I mean, you know, it’s funny that a very small percentage of the audience when we were testing it — we’re talking three or four people out of 500 — would say either “this is a pro-choice film” or “this is a pro-life film.” It’s not really either, and I don’t mean to make an overt political statement there. Obviously, people are going to imbue it with whatever their specific belief is, but in the same way, some people were saying that The Dark Knight was a Republican apology, and some were saying it was an anti-Bush film. Both sides were sort of claiming it for their own.\n\nRT: Well, I think you’re in the clear, because at different times I thought it could possibly be either a pro-life or a pro-choice film.\n\nDG: I try to walk that very thin line, so good.\n\nFor the latest reviews, trailers, and news for The Unborn, click here.\n\nWant more Five Favorite Films? Check out previous installments with Mickey Rourke, Don Cheadle, and Robert Pattinson.\n\nThough his first film, Shallow Grave, brought Danny Boyle to the attention of the film savvy, it was his 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh‘s Trainspotting that made his name as an internationally renowned directing talent. From a budget of $3.5m the film grossed $72m worldwide, and won critical praise the world over, currently sitting at 88% on the Tomatometer.\n\nMany trailers and posters for his subsequent work tout it as being “from the director of Trainspotting,” but Boyle’s drive to deliver fresh and eclectic cinema will be a surprise for anyone expecting a redux of that film. His follow-ups have run the full gamut; from bleak sci-fi to zombie horror, through spiritual romantic comedy and traveller thriller. If there’s one thing Boyle’s not, it’s predictable.\n\nIndeed, his most recent previous outing was 2007’s Sunshine, about a crew of astronauts in the not-too-distant future who are on a mission to reignite our dying sun. But it’s a far cry from his new film, Slumdog Millionaire, a fantastical romance set on the streets and in the television studios of India. The story of a young boy’s tragic upbringing in the slums and his appearance on India’s version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, it’s already attracting awards by the bucketload.\n\nAs you’d expect from his body of work, his five favourite films are diverse and disparate. “I’ve got an odd list,” he told RT. “Things like your ‘top films’ or your ‘top end playlist songs’ — these are the things that keep me awake at night. I watch all of these films through the director’s eyes, and I’ve watched them multiple times — well, except for The Bicycle Thief — to try and bow down and learn.”\n\nSlumdog Millionaire opens today in the UK and is out now in the US and Australia. And come back, because RT will have more from Danny Boyle later.\n\nAfter a successful run of studio comedies (most recently, 2006’s Beerfest), the Broken Lizard gang is returning to their indie roots with the self-produced Slammin’ Salmon, a restaurant-set comedy co-written by and starring all five members (and directed by Lizard and first-time helmer Kevin Heffernan). Rotten Tomatoes caught up with the Lizards en route to Park City, Utah, where they’ll premiere Slammin’ Salmon at the Slamdance Film Festival, to find out their 25 Favorite Films of all time!\n\n[rtimage]MapID=10009558&MapTypeID=2&photo=1&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nThe members of Broken Lizard (Super Troopers, Club Dread, Beerfest) — also known as Steve Lemme, Erik Stolhanske, Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, and Paul Soter — have been friends since their college days, and it shows; when RT sat down to chat with the Lizards about their favorite films, they chimed in over one another with their favorite movie quotes, recollections of man dates past, and of course, plenty of good natured jabs. Slammin’ Salmon, in which a heavyweight champ-turned-restaurateur (Michael Clarke Duncan, letting loose) pits his wait staff against each other in a Glengarry Glen Ross-style contest, marks the Lizards’ return to independent film; they hope to land distribution after their premiere at Slamdance. (And in case you’re wondering, having come face to face with Super Troopers fandom at a live, Rocky Horror-style version of the flick, they are indeed in the scripting phase of Super Troopers 2.)\n\nBelow, get to know your favorite Broken Lizards as we hear each member’s five favorite films — making this a very special installment of RT’s 25 Favorite Films with Broken Lizard.\n\nSteve Lemme\n\nNext: Erik Stolhanske takes it back to the seventies…\n\nErik Stolhanske [The other Broken Lizards chime in with Stolhanske’s “favorite films”: “Steel Magnolias, Terms of Endearment, Fried Green Tomatoes, Rachel Getting Married, Tea with Mussolini…”]\n\nNext: Broken Lizard vet, first-time director and erstwhile Farva, Kevin Heffernan\n\nKevin Heffernan\n\nNext: Jay Chandrasekhar double dips with a few shared favorites\n\nJay Chandrasekhar\n\nNext: Last but not least, Paul Soter wraps up with his favorite flicks\n\nPaul Soter\n\nFor news and updates on Broken Lizard’s Slamdance adventure, follow the daily updates on their official site.

He was in three films in 2008, notable for their vastly different styles. His extended cameo as Richard Gere‘s son in the weepy Nights in Rodanthe, based on the Nicholas Sparks novel, was followed by two far less forgettable roles; opposite Seth Rogen in Pineapple Express (for which he received a Golden Globe nomination) and as Sean Penn‘s boyfriend in Milk (for which he has been nominated with the cast for the SAG ensemble award).\n\nHe says he signed on for Pineapple because it was a chance to work with Judd Apatow and company, whom he knew from his days on the TV series Freaks and Geeks. “We did a lot of goofing around in a kind of constructed way,” he says of the film. “It’s a lot of improvisation, just letting the camera roll and doing the scene over and over again and seeing what happens. And I loved that!”\n\nWhen asked to contrast the experiences on the two sets, he stops and thinks. “Milk had its own kind of looseness,” he says. “Gus Van Sant has his own approach, and there was the freedom to try different kinds of things. And Sean really encouraged that too. So it was somewhat improvisational, but what it did was to make the performances more natural. And it may be funny to say, but it was the same with Pineapple. I think that’s one of the things that Judd Apatow brings to comedies: there are wacky situations but it feels more emotionally grounded.”\n\nClearly this on-screen naturalism is important to him. He’s been studying film at New York University, and chooses five favourites that are all firmly rooted in authenticity…\n\nMilk opens in UK on Friday and in Australia on 29th January. It’s out now in the US.\n\nErnest Borgnine is one of Hollywood’s most venerable character actors, with a career that spans more than five decades. To celebrate Borgnine’s 92nd birthday this week, Turner Classic Movies will air the interview special Private Screenings: Ernest Borgnine on Jan. 26, which will be followed by screenings of several of the actor’s greatest films, including Marty and From Here to Eternity. In an interview with RT, Borgnine shared thoughts on some of his favorite movies (and a few of his own performances that mean a lot to him).\n\nAfter a 10-year stint in the Navy, which included service in World War II, Borgnine turned to acting. He caught his first big break as a supporting player in the Best Picture-winning From Here to Eternity, and after a series of sharp secondary roles, he rose to prominence in Marty, the story of a lonely butcher who makes a connection with a shy schoolteacher. Borgnine won a Best Actor Oscar for the role (and he remains the oldest-living Best Actor winner). After Marty, Borgnine co-starred in a number of memorable films, including The Dirty Dozen and The Wild Bunch. At 92, he shows few signs of slowing down; Borgnine has a recurring voice role on SpongeBob SquarePants, and he picked up a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 2007 TV film A Grandpa for Christmas.\n\nIn addition to his favorite films, Borgnine discussed why directors were easier to work with in the old days, a hairy situation on location, and why there was no one quite like Gary Cooper.\n\nNext: Borgnine talks about his favorite actors, and recounts a scary moment south of the border.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: You’ve worked with so many of the greats, actors like Kirk Douglas, Spencer Tracy, and Burt Lancaster. Who was the best actor you worked with?\n\nErnest Borgnine: It’s a tossup. One was Spencer Tracy, and the other was Gary Cooper. Now, people say to me, “Oh c’mon, he got it for saying ‘yup.'” (Editor’s note: Cooper was known for saying “yup” instead of “yes,” and it became a signature line for the actor.) Yeah? Watch him! He was so honest and true unto himself. This is what an actor is all about. And it’s true of Spencer Tracy, don’t get me wrong. But Gary Cooper was the kind of a fellow that, with a look, with a glance, with a touch of his finger — with just a little, tiny move, you could see what kind of an actor he was, because you felt it. You knew what he was going through. When he did [Meet John Doe], where he was gonna throw himself off that building, you knew he was gonna throw himself off! There was no doubt about it. He was that honest. He said to me one time when we were riding along in a car, he said, “You know, I sure wish I could act like you.” I said, “But sir, you’ve got two Academy Awards that show that you’re a good actor!” He said, “I got ’em for saying ‘yup.'” That was his excuse. But for me, every time he’s on the television, I watch him like a hawk, because he was so pure and honest it wasn’t funny.\n\nRT: Speaking of Gary Cooper, you were in Vera Cruz together, and I heard an anecdote about something that happened when you went to buy cigarettes on location in Mexico, dressed as bandits and wearing fake guns. Is that true?\n\nEB: Yeah! Charlie Bronson and I started off to get some cigarettes, and we were dressed up in costume, naturally. A whole truckload of soldiers went by, and we said, “Hola! Como le va?” Y’know? “Hello! How are you?” And we kept on, and all of a sudden we heard, “Alto!” Which means “Halt!” We turned around and all these guys had pointed pistols at us! We said, “We’re actors! We’re actors!” Oh, God, we were frightened! It wasn’t easy, I tell ya. We were going to get some cigarettes, that’s all!\n\nBorgnine (far right) in The Wild Bunch.\n\nRT: As someone who spent 10 years in the Navy, how many war films come close to depicting the experience in any real way?\n\nEB: I think The Longest Day was just about the best of ’em. Tora! Tora! Tora! was pretty good, but The Longest Day is just about the best of them, because it showed the guys trying to get up that cliff and everything else. It must have been hell. I wasn’t in any part of that, and I’m so glad I wasn’t, but I could just feel what those fellows were doing that day, and believe me, it wasn’t easy. And there’s Gary Cooper’s Sergeant York. He won the Academy Award for that one. Boy, what a piece of work that is.\n\nRT: Are there any younger actors whose work you admire?\n\nEB: The closest one that comes to mind — a wonderful actor — is Gary Sinise. What a great guy. What a wonderful person. Not only that, but I watched him where he took his band and performed for the troops overseas. I met him in person one time, and he said, “You mind if I come over and talk with you?” And I said, “No! C’mon!” It was the most wonderful hour you’ve ever seen in your life, and it passed like a minute. He can do no wrong, as far as I’m concerned. What a performance he did in Forrest Gump.\n\nBorgnine (center) in TV’s McHale’s Navy.\n\nRT: You’ve also worked with some prominent directors, like Sam Peckinpah, Nicholas Ray, Fred Zinnemann, and Robert Aldrich. Who was your favorite to work with?\n\nDG: Bob Aldrich. The Dirty Dozen, Emperor of the North, Flight of the Phoenix — he did it all. Believe me, working with him was like a dream. Delbert Mann was another one. When you worked with Delbert Mann, you got an acting lesson. He was wonderful. He didn’t direct you, he just kind of suggested things as you go along, and first thing you know, it’s the easiest thing in the world. I’ve worked with people who drum you over the head and then [they say], “Try it again. Try it again.” When I was working making pictures — real pictures — directors came on the set. They actually watched you on the set. They watched your expression. They watched everything. Today, they watch actors who insist on wearing dark glasses. You can’t see anybody’s eyes! And they watch all this not by being on the set, but by watching a little television set. And as long as it all fits within the allotted section of time, it’s like, “Hey, that’s it. Print it!” There’s no honesty. There’s no real feeling that goes beyond it, with the head and the heart and everything else. To me, my directors are always the man who leads the band, and I say, “Yes sir,” and “No sir,” and that’s it. I’m the only one who does it. Everybody calls him by his name, but I call him sir, because to me, he’s the director of the band, and when we’re off the stage, that’s when I call him by his first name, and that’s fine.\n\nFor Borgnine’s complete filmography, click here.\n\nWant more Five Favorite Films? Check out previous installments with Mickey Rourke, Danny Boyle, and James Franco.\n\nGiven his filmography of stylized thrillers, Scottish director Paul McGuigan (Gangster No. 1, Wicker Park, Lucky Number Slevin) seemed a fitting choice to helm this month’s supernatural actioner Push, a Hong Kong-set sci-fi adventure about normal people endowed with super powers starring Chris Evans, Dakota Fanning, and Djimon Hounsou. Accordingly, one may be taken aback to hear that McGuigan names romantic auteur Wong Kar-Wai among his favorite directorial influences, but as he demonstrates in Push — which captures the vibrant streets of Hong Kong in lush detail, appropriately — McGuigan possesses a strong visual finesse that belies his history of making brutal crime movies and Hollywood suspense flicks.\n\nMcGuigan shared his Five Favorite Films with Rotten Tomatoes, which range from the above mentioned work of Wong Kar-Wai to UK family classics to the edgy work of Darren Aronofsky and beyond.

Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Hounsou about his Five Favorite Films of all time and discussed the two-time Oscar nominee’s philosophies on the nature of acting, the perils of creating a signature style, and more.\n\nIn this week’s Push, Djimon Hounsou strikes a menacing pose as Carver, the ominous head of a secret government agency working to cultivate an army of telekinetics, psychics, shape-shifters, and others endowed with unique powers. It’s a bit of a departure for Hounsou, who came to attention as the leader of a slave rebellion in the Oscar-nominated Amistad only a little over a decade ago, but achieving variety, it would seem, is Hounsou’s intent. Read on as Djimon Hounsou takes us through his favorite films — classics of their respective generations — and shares his thoughts on filmmaking, acting and creative versatility.\n\n“I’d like to think that when a story changes, your vision changes.” — Djimon Hounsou\n\nNext: Hounsou talks about Push, as well as formenting a personal style in the movies.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: In Push, the government secretly trains people with a number of special powers, but the most dangerous ones are “pushers” — people who can make you believe lies are real. Are all the best actors really pushers of some sort?\n\nDjimon Hounsou: I guess you could look at it that way. But at the end of the day, actors are “pushing” themselves, not you; that belief makes you [the audience] believe. They don’t alter your thinking; they alter their own beliefs, embodying the life condition that they’re playing. They are convincing themselves, not yo"
