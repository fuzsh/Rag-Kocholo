        "text": "Disney media franchise about a sentient 1963 Volkswagen Beetle\n\nHerbieCreated byBill Walsh\n\nDon DaGradiOriginal workThe Love Bug (1968)OwnerThe Walt Disney CompanyYears1968–2005Based on\"Car, Boy, Girl\" by Gordon Buford\n\nThe Herbie franchise consists of American sports adventure comedy theatrical feature films, one television film, a television series, and other multimedia releases.[1] The overall story centers around the titular Herbie, a sentient anthropomorphic 1963 Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of his own and capable of driving himself. The vehicle is oftentimes a legitimate contender, though the underdog contestant in competitive races, but to a greater degree assists his human owners in bettering their lives.\n\nThe first film, notable for being the final live-action film produced under the supervision by Walt Disney prior to his death, was released in 1969. Based on a story titled \"Car, Boy, Girl\", the feature proved to be a critical and financial success for Walt Disney Productions. Upon its release, the movie was the second-highest-grossing film for the company, second only to Mary Poppins (1964). Its performance placed it fourth highest on box office returns, and spawned a franchise.[2][3] Each of the subsequent releases were successes in their own right, but none received as much universal praise as the original.\n\nThe second film was met with generally positive reception from critics.[4][5][6] The third film was met with mixed reception,[7] while the fourth film was poorly received and is often classified as the weakest Herbie film.[8][9] The television series was panned by critics, resulting in a cancellation following five episodes, with reviews calling it \"domesticated\", \"mild\", and \"boring\".[10] The fifth film was met with negative reviews, citing its inferiority to the original.[citation needed] The sixth film was met with mixed reception, and garnered the highest box-office returns out of all of the installments. Though the film was criticized for various aspects including the plot, it was seen as a return to form for the franchise.[11][12]\n\nOrigin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1961, a short story titled \"Car, Boy, Girl\" was written by Gordon Buford. In an interview with a United States publication for Volkswagen owners titled Small World Magazine, Buford stated that the idea for his story came from growing up on a Colorado farm, where he witnessed how his parents treated their vehicles with a similar manner as they did their horses. As the story was not published, it is believed that it was presented directly to Walt Disney and had its film rights purchased by Walt Disney Productions shortly thereafter. The Love Bug was the last live-action film produced by Disney before Walt Disney's death.[2]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S.\n\nrelease date Director Screenwriter(s) Story by Producer(s) The Love Bug December 24, 1968 Robert Stevenson Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi Bill Walsh Herbie Rides Again June 6, 1974 ( ) Bill Walsh Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo June 24, 1977 ( ) Vincent McEveety Arthur Alsberg & Don Nelson Ron Miller Herbie Goes Bananas June 25, 1980 ( ) Don Tait Disney's The Love Bug November 30, 1997 ( ) Peyton Reed Ryan Rowe Joan Van Horn and Irwin Marcus Herbie: Fully Loaded June 22, 2005 ( ) Angela Robinson Thomas Lennon & Robert Ben Garant\n\nand Alfred Gough & Miles Millar Thomas Lennon & Robert Ben Garant\n\nand Mark Perez Robert Simonds\n\nThe Love Bug (1969)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Love Bug\n\nHas-been professional race car driver Jim Douglas and his philosophical mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz find themselves in possession of a white Volkswagen Beetle that seems to have a mind and spirit of its own. Naming the car Herbie, Jim and Tennessee become the talk of the California racing circuit. Sports-car dealer and circuit contestant Peter Thorndyke tries to use his assistant to come between the friends and their car.[13][14]\n\nHerbie Rides Again (1974)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Herbie Rides Again\n\nAlonzo P. Hawk is a mean-spirited property developer who has bought several blocks of land in the downtown district in order to build a gigantic shopping mall. There is one problem however; an elderly widow named Mrs. Steinmetz who won't sell the one remaining lot that Hawk needs to proceed with his scheme. So he resorts to all manner of chicanery, legal or otherwise, to get it. After they discover Alonzo's plans, it's up to Herbie to save the day and save Mrs. Steinmetz's home.[15]\n\nHerbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977)\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Douglas, reunited with Herbie, finds himself once again hitting the roads in a race car event. This time, Jim and Herbie, along with goofy mechanic Wheely Applegate compete in a French competition. Also involved in the automotive adventure are Quincey and Max, a pair of jewel thieves, and Diane Darcy, the beautiful woman who drives Giselle, a sporty female car and Herbie's love interest.[16]\n\nHerbie Goes Bananas (1980)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Herbie Goes Bananas\n\nJim's nephew, Pete and his friend D.J., board a cruise ship called the Sun Princess to Panama to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Primero. Unknown to them, a young pickpocket named Paco has stowed away in Herbie's trunk, as a trio of gold counterfeiters pursue the youngster in an attempt to retrieve the location of a source of ancient Inca gold.[17]\n\nDisney's The Love Bug (1997)\n\n[edit]\n\nHerbie, the inimitable VW Beetle is destined for the scrap heap, until down-on-his-luck mechanic Hank Cooper takes him over and gives him a new lease of life, much to the fury of his previous owner, who builds a menacing, evil, black Beetle to challenge Herbie and Hank to a one-on-one race.[18]\n\nReleased as a made-for-television movie, as a part of The Magical World of Walt Disney, this installment was marketed as a remake. Events of the film reveal it is in fact a sequel to the previous films.[19]\n\nHerbie: Fully Loaded (2005)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Herbie: Fully Loaded\n\nMaggie Peyton wants to become a NASCAR driver but her overprotective father, Ray Peyton Sr. won't hear of it. A former racer himself, Ray wants Maggie to take a lucrative television sportscasting job and leave the dangers of driving to her crash-prone brother. When Ray Sr. takes Maggie to a junkyard to pick out a car, she has no idea that the little Volkswagen Beetle, named Herbie, she takes home will change her life.[20]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nLive action\n\n[edit]\n\nHerbie, the Love Bug (1982)\n\n[edit]\n\nA television series based on, and a continuation of, the film series was developed and released from March 17 – April 14, 1982.[21] The series was released as a mid-season replacement to a cancelled show, and was given the 8:00 P.M. time slot.

Robert had served as President of National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and CEO of Radio Corporation of America (RCA), the prior of which was the network which had aired The Wonderful World of Disney.[59] In developing the stage show, Walt Disney Productions worked with NBC to create a partnership subsidiary company called Nawal Productions. Four seasons of the show traveled, as separate editions. After the financial success of a trial run in Long Beach in 1969, the show evolved and thrived with the addition of producer/director Michel \"Mr. G\" Grilikhes. The first edition's run at Madison Square Garden made a record in advanced ticket sales with $400,000.00 total; while a run in Salt Lake City booked a total of 77,255 people in nine days (equivalent of 38% of the city's population). It later toured Europe, Australia, Asia and Latin America, earning $64 million worldwide.[60][61] Herbie featured during the last three years, in the comedy acts:\n\n\"Goofy and the Love Bug\" (1970–'71): The comedy comedic short, centered around Goofy working in an autobody shop, who comes into contact and contends with Herbie.\n\n\"Three's a Family\" (1972–'73): Goofy once again meets Herbie. The plot featured the latter falling in love with a pink VW, and the pair have their own little Bug of their own.\n\n\"The Used Car Lot\" (1973–'74). During the comedic skit, Goofy visits a used car lot and can't decide if he prefers a Ford Model T or Herbie.\n\nWalt Disney's World on Ice: In 1979, Mattel approached The Walt Disney Company to collaborate on an ice show centered around the latter's properties. The traveling show was developed by Irvin & Kenneth Feld Productions. The first series of shows debuted in 1981, while Herbie featured throughout the performances.[62][63] The show eventually evolved into Disney on Ice, with Herbie featuring in various shows.[64]\n\nHerbie and Friends Tour: In joint-commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the franchise and Volkswagen Group of America, Walt Disney Pictures in collaboration with VW America sponsored a roadtrip tour, featuring Herbie and various classic VWs. The trek included 25 VW dealership stops, impromptu mini-car shows, as well as promotional stays for the Herbie Fully Loaded film. Starting in San Francisco, California and ended New York City, the event lasted from May 13–31, 2005.[65]\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nHerbie appears in Disneyland's 50th Anniversary television commercial, where he is driven by Mickey Mouse and Goofy as they take a roadtrip get to Disneyland.[66]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nDisney's Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005): A racing game developed by Climax Handheld Games, published by Disney Interactive Studios and Buena Vista Games as a Game Boy Advance exclusive release. The game is based loosely based on the 2005 film Herbie: Fully Loaded and features stills from the movie as in-game cut scenes.[67] The player takes the role of Herbie throughout a series of races, though should they fail to place first in any race, they are shown a Game Over screen and booted to the menu to start over.[67] The game was met with mixed reception, while its 3D graphics were widely praised.[67][68][69]\n\nDisney's Herbie: Rescue Rally (2007): A racing game developed by Climax Handheld games, and published by Disney Interactive Studios as a Nintendo DS exclusive release. The game is based on the Herbie film series. It earned a positive critical reception with IGN stating: \"...Herbie Rescue Rally is a good game. For a system that is seriously lacking in solid racing titles, it's refreshing to find one that is at least worth playing.\"[70]"
