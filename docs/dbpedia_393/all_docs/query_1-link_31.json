        "text": "LOS ANGELES : American actor Matt Dillon has signed on to help relaunch Walt Disney Co.'s popular 1970s \"Love Bug\" film franchise starring a Volkswagen \"beetle\" with a mind of its own, Daily Variety said on Thursday.\n\nDillon, 40, will star opposite Michael Keaton and Lindsay Lohan in \"Herbie: Fully Loaded,\" the resuscitated adventures of the lovable bug Herbie, which will begin production in Los Angeles next week, the entertainment daily said.\n\nDisney hopes the movie will cash in on the three-decade-old success of the original Herbie films: \"Herbie Rides Again\" (1974), \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\" (1977) and \"Herbie Goes Bananas\" (1980).\n\nThe new film, to be directed by Angela Robinson, tells of the adventures of the world-famous VW in the realm of NASCAR racing, with Dillon as a dashing NASCAR bad boy.\n\nDillon has previously starred in such hits as the comedy \"There's Something About Mary\" (1998), opposite Cameron Diaz and Ben Stiller, \"Wild Things\" (1998) and 1995's \"To Die For.\" - AFP\n\ncherrynegra said:\n\nThe new film, to be directed by Angela Robinson, tells of the adventures of the world-famous VW in the realm of NASCAR racing, with Dillon as a dashing NASCAR bad boy.\n\n...I mean, c'mon. Who thinks of this stuff?\n\nISTCrew20 said:\n\n...I mean, c'mon. Who thinks of this stuff?\n\nAnd yet the storyline is kind of in keeping with some of the older ones. Wasn't there a storyline where Herbie was in a car race of some kind? How much you want to bet this new Love Bug is going to be tripped out in the latest street racing gear???\n\n:lol:"
