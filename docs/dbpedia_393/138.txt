Parents need to know that The Love Bug is a 1968 comedy about a Volkswagen Bug that seems to come to life when a struggling race car driver takes the wheel. There are some moments of dated humor rooted in stereotyping. For instance, Asian American characters speak in broken English, keep dried squid in the passenger seat, use an abacus for math, and their appearance is greeted with "Chopsticks"-like background music. In one scene, Herbie, in an imitation of suicide, is shown hanging precariously off the edge of the Golden Gate Bridge and must be talked down. The villain gets Herbie "drunk" on the "Irish Coffee" he had been drinking with Herbie's mechanic; the mechanic later makes reference to Herbie being hungover. Some jokes involving hippies who act like they might be high on something; one cop tells another cop who is behaving strangely that he has been "on that Haight-Ashbury beat too long." Cigarette smoking. Reckless driving, although exaggerated and comical. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails.
