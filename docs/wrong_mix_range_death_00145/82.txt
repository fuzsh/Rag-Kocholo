George Carlin — whose routines including a lengthy riff on death and dying — will still be making fans laugh from the great beyond, as his estate is planning a significant relaunch of the comedian’s website, complete with the promise of previously unreleased or rare audio recordings.

The revamped site will kick off on March 27, coinciding with the hanging of a Carlin portrait in the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery.

The first of the recordings featured will be from the 1972 Milwaukee Summerfest concert at which Carlin – who died in 2008, at the age of 71 – was arrested for performing his “Seven Dirty Words” routine.

Carlin’s daughter, Kelly, is currently working on a memoir about her life growing up with him, “A Carlin Home Companion,” which will be released by St. Martin’s Press. She recently performed a one-woman show predicated on the material at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, and oversees the estate along with Carlin’s longtime manager, Jerry Hamza.

The hoped-for Carlin renaissance will also include an influx of additional material for SiriusXM, which will offer the first of the comic’s 14 HBO specials, “On Location: George Carlin at USC,” in its entirety on April 1.

Below are clips culled from the Summerfest concert, in which Carlin — hardly at his best — is stoned, distracted and dealing with a restless audience. The “Filthy Words” routine, as it was actually titled, and the debate over whether it qualified as obscenity, ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978.
