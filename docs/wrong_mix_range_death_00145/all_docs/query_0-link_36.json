        "text": "Edwin S. Schaller Jr., BHS 1947?\n\nEdwin S. Schaller Jr. MBA ’66 was born on Jan. 16, 1929 and died Sept. 16, 2012. A former resident of Los Gatos, Ed was born in Chicago, Ill., and raised in Burbank, Calif. He attended Burbank High School, where he excelled in sports and served as senior class president. He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA and was extremely proud of his membership in the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He later attended Santa Clara University, where he earned his MBA. Shortly before graduating from UCLA, Ed was offered a job at Lockheed (following in his father's footsteps); this would become his home for the next 39 years. In 1954, a newly assigned secretary in his division, Diane Topp, caught his eye. They were married a year later in the Santa Barbara Mission chapel on Valentine's Day \"so I wouldn't forget our anniversary!\" In 1957, Ed was transferred to Sunnyvale and assigned to work on the Polaris Missile Program. He traveled extensively and never would, or maybe never could, talk about the nature of his work. Diane and Ed raised their 3 boys in Los Gatos and for 10 years Ed coached each as they rose through the ranks of the Quito Little League. Ed was also active in YMCA Indian Guides Gray-Y, in which he coached basketball flag football. He loved the outdoors, especially skiing fishing. The Family skied at Dodge Ridge, thawed out at the Mi-Wuk Motor Lodge, then headed off to Kelly's for dinner and a little pinball. Ed and his boys fished together at Yosemite's Saddlebag Lake and, in turn, they taught their own kids how to fish there. In April 2000, Ed and Diane moved to Rocklin, Calif. Diane was diagnosed with cancer in June of that year and passed away in August. Diane was the perfect housewife, but Ed surprised us all by making a home for himself and surviving 12 years without her support. He was active in the Springfield Senior community, especially at the fitness center, until a circulatory condition hampered his mobility. He kept much to himself, living quietly, enjoying daily crosswords puzzles, watching news on CNN and rooting for his beloved San Francisco Giants, UCLA Bruins, and adopted Sacramento Kings. Ed was lovingly cared for by his entire family during his final days, and he passed away peacefully with his son, Todd, by his side. Not surprisingly, his final words were, \"Did the Giants win?\" They sure did, Dad! Ed is predeceased by his parents, Edwin Spencer Schaller Sr and Ruth Eppinger Schaller, and is survived by his children- Mark (Amy) Schaller, Adam (Tricia) Schaller, Todd (Cherie) Schaller, and grandchildren- Trace, Alexandria, and Spencer, and Nik Robbins; and a sister, Jan Borchers Adams.\n\nJack Warren Morris, BHS 1954\n\nJack Warren Morris, BHS 1954\n\n(February 28, 1935 to May 04, 2014 )\n\nResident of Ukiah, California Jackie Warren Morris, 79, died May 4th, 2014 after a short illness, surrounded by his children at the home of his daughter in Austin, Texas. Jack was born in Red Mound, OK, on February 28th, 1935.\n\nLike millions of other people fleeing from the Dust Bowl, his parents moved their family to the West Coast and settled in Burbank, CA. Jack grew up running between Orange trees in the beautiful valley and watched as the city grew and expanded before his eyes. Jack showed a talent for cutting hair from an early age, and began cutting his father’s hair at the age of 13. Jack graduated from Burbank High School in 1954. After graduating, Jack became ill with Rheumatic Fever and had to stay in the hospital for a month. When he recovered he went on to Barber Collage.\n\nMany members of his extended family also migrated to the Southern California area. He would travel up and down highway 99, visiting them and drag racing any one he could. He met the love of his life, Colette Roell, and married her in 1958. Jack and Colette had three children while living in Burbank, CA. When the Los Angeles area smog became too oppressive, they moved their family to the Ukiah Valley, as it met all their criteria: a small town that had a Catholic School, a barber shop, was smog free, and surrounded by nature’s beauty. They had their fourth child after arriving in Ukiah.\n\nIn time, Jack took over the Barber Shop at Jenson’s Truck Stop. His clients became his friends, and for over 45 years Jack enjoyed seeing people come through his doors. Stories, jokes, and straight talk filled his shop. Many a child was instructed to “sit still” on his first haircut, and many a haircut was given for free. Some of his clients were out of state truckers, waiting until their next trip to Ukiah for a haircut and a visit to “The Flat-Top King”, as Jack was affectionately known. His long career served both the young and the elderly, including house calls to friends who were unable to leave their homes. Many of his clients had children, and later those children had children, who in turn became his clients. Generations of Ukiah residents told him that they “grew up” in his barber shop.\n\nJack had a big heart, and several life-long friends called him “The most honest man I’ve ever known“. He was very moved that his retirement was noted on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal to commemorate the occasion. In his younger years, Jack embraced his inner racer, either drag racing on the “strip” in Los Angeles, on “the 99”, and later on the ¼ mile oval race track in Ukiah. In 1956 he won a drag racing trophy for having the Fastest Stock Car in Los Angeles County, his treasured 1956 Chevrolet 210 Sport Coupe. He always had one foot on the brake and the other on the gas. After recuperating from knee surgery complications that kept him away from driving for several years, he took a driving test to regain his license in December, 2013. The instructor said that he was the best driver she had ridden with in years.\n\nAs his family grew, Jack took them on day and camping trips to see all the splendors of Mendocino County, from the Coast to Lake Pillsbury, from the swimming holes of the Russian River below Hopland to an Uncle’s ranch north of Laytonville. He taught his children how to water-ski, with summer days and nights too numerous to count being spent on the waters of Lake Mendocino. The location of his shop at the truck stop gave easy access to large inner tubes, and Jack would load his pickup full of tubes and kids for excursions floating down the Russian river. Jack and Colette were active in the community, and raised their family in the arms of St. Mary’s Catholic Church and School. Jack was a member of both the Elks Lodge and Masonic Lodge, in which he took great pride. Jack enjoyed playing in the Ukiah pool and bowling leagues.\n\nAfter he retired, Jack and Colette loved playing golf, and traveled in their RV around the Western United States. Their trips included visiting friends and family in TX, OK, OR, WA and Canada. He enjoyed travels with the Elks Wapitis. Jack was planning to return to Ukiah after his granddaughter, Siena, graduated in May. He was looking forward to seeing all his old friends. Jack was preceded in death by his parents, Plomer Harold Morris and Ota Mae Miller, his beloved sister, Evelyn M. Nelson, and his cherished wife of 55 years, Colette T. Morris. He is survived by his four children, their spouses and grandchildren: David and Elaine Morris (Amanda and Heather), Dale and Kim Morris (Greg and Sara). Merrie Morris-Mazzetti and Rob Mazzetti (Siena and Cordell), and Charles and Janet Morris (Christopher and Jonathan). He leaves behind many friends and family he dearly loved.\n\nA viewing will be at Eversole Mortuary, May 29th , from 2 to 8 P.M. The funeral will be held at St. Mary’s Catholic Church, May 30th, 11:00 AM. The burial will follow at Russian River Cemetery in Ukiah. A reception and celebration of Jack’s life will be held at The Elks Lodge following burial. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Elks Lodge Major Projects Fund, a charity that provides free physical therapy to disabled children.\n\nOsar Carlos Pokorny, BHS 1965\n\nOscar Carlos Pokorny was surrounded by family and friends when he went home to be with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, on Saturday, July 26, 2014. Oscar was born in Marfa, Texas, on May 25, 1946. He was the son of Anton Ludwig Pokorny and Fay Pokorny, and younger brother of Tony Pokorny. Oscar's family moved from Texas to Burbank, California in 1951. Oscar graduated Burbank High school in 1965 and worked at Senior Aerospace SSP from 1965 to 1980. He was drafted into the US Army in 1965. Private Pokorny was trained in the construction and repair of roads, railroads, and bridges. He also received instruction in demolitions and mine warfare. He attended LA Trade Tech where he received his welding certification. Oscar married his high school sweetheart, Angela Ann Franchino, on May 9, 1970. They had two children, his favorite daughter, Victoria Lynn Pokorny, and his favorite son, Eric Joseph Pokorny. From 1982 to 1984, he was a development bench mechanic at Litton Data Systems. He then transferred employment to become part of the Skunk Works department at Lockheed Martin in Burbank and also in Palmdale. He was so proud to have made parts and scaffolding for the Space Shuttle. After a large layoff, Oscar did contract work on animated projects such as the dragon at the Excalibur in Las Vegas, the Water World set at Universal Studios, and Wizard of Oz at the MGM Grand. In 1995, Oscar went back to Senior Aerospace SSP and just recently retired on July 11, 2014. For many years Oscar was an active member of Calvary Bible Church in Burbank. He would either be in the kitchen cooking, or clean-up crew — usually both! Oscar loved the outdoors. Fishing, Bar-B-Qing and camping brought him much joy. He was a very creative man who enjoyed drawing, whittling, and making miniatures. Oscar leaves behind a loving family including: Wife, Angela Pokorny Daughter, Vicki Pokorny Son and daughter-in-law: Eric and Jessica Pokorny Father: Anton Pokorny and Lucille Trcka Brother and sister-in-law: Tony and Ginny Pokorny Brother-in-law and Sister-in-law: Peter and Barbara Franchino Nephews and Nieces: Weston and Christine Pokorny, Jason Pokorny, Mark and Julie Gordon Baretto, Devin and Michelle Franchino Great Nephews and Nieces: Kyle Gordon, Mitchell Gordon, Simone Franchino, Tony Pokorny, and Kimberly Pokorny And countless uncles, aunts and cousins. Oscar was a loving son, faithful husband, and hands-on father. He was also a kind-hearted in-law, fun loving cousin, crazy uncle, and true friend. Oscar was sixty-eight years old when he died of a weak heart, but he was the strongest man we knew. Sleep with the angels, Oscar. In Lieu of flowers the family is asking for donations to either of the following organizations. http://main.nationalmssociety.org/goto/ericpokorny 2014 - In loving memory of Oscar C. Pokorny Although Oscar did not live with MS, he was very supportive and proud of Eric's efforts to help fight and find a cure. In lieu of flowers, the family is asking for donations to causes that Oscar believed in and a cure for MS is one of those causes.
