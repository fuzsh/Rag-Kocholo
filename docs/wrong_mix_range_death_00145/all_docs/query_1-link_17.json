        "text": "The last time Kelly Carlin saw her father, George, was in May 2008, a month before his death.\n\nShe and her husband joined George Carlin and his girlfriend at Ford’s Filling Station in Culver City for a lunch to celebrate the legendary comic’s birthday.\n\nOn Thursday night Kelly will again celebrate her father’s birthday – he would have turned 75 on Saturday – with a night of memories and laughs at the Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach.\n\nThe Westchester resident will be joined by Garry Shandling, Rick Overton and about a half-dozen other comics for the evening, which will benefit the nonprofit Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression.\n\n“Dad would hate that we’re celebrating a dead man’s birthday,” said Kelly Carlin. “But (expletive) it. It gives me an excuse to raise money for this fantastic organization – for the First Amendment – and that’s something he obviously was a proponent of.”\n\nGeorge Carlin’s presence at the Comedy & Magic Club is not new. He performed at the venue a few times right after it opened in 1978 and returned more frequently later in his career.\n\n“The last couple of years, when he started playing here again, the amount of huge names – (comics) everybody knows – they would call me and say, `Is there any way that I can open for George? Is there any way I can be on the stage with him? And if not that, is there any way I can just sit in the room and soak it in?”‘ recalled club owner Mike Lacey.\n\nCarlin was one of the few comics, Lacey said, who could come into the club and say, “`Hey, I’m going to knock you off-balance with this being funny, but I’m going to open your mind – and maybe what you think is right, isn’t.”‘\n\nFrom his take on the seven words you can never say on TV, to his riff on “A Place for Your Stuff” to his more recent “Modern Man” routine, Carlin’s takes on society were memorable and prolific.\n\nAnd he had a great impact on comedians who would follow.\n\n“I had two major stand-up heroes as a kid – it was George Carlin and Richard Pryor,” said Overton, who won an Emmy Award for writing for “Dennis Miller Live.” “It was as if both held a 10-(kilowatt) lamp on a swivel. Richard Pryor would take the 10-k and aim it directly into his own face and into his eyes, to highlight the heights and depths of his experiences and his soul. George Carlin took that same lamp, spun it around and aimed it at all the corners in life where we hide our stupid (expletive). And he also lit all the shadows where crooks hid.\n\n“I truly, truly am in debt to him for paving a road I can walk down with my act, rather than having to chop my way through with a machete like he did. He paved the way, he was Lewis and Clark all in one. He made it possible to do more bold and daring things and to go into a world of smart esoteric word play at the same time. He was an IQ test and you passed if you laughed.”\n\nCarlin’s impact on the comedy industry was vast, Lacey said.\n\n“Every comic that walks through the doors of this club has been influenced by George Carlin,” he said. “I don’t think they’re trying to copy him. I think they’re all in awe of him. They have tremendous respect.”\n\nKelly Carlin learned of that respect immediately after her father passed away.\n\n“I didn’t know any comedians before my dad died, but literally the first day after he died they started calling me,” she said. “They were crying on the phone with me. They would tell me stories of how he reached out to them, encouraged them, what a gigantic loss this is.”\n\nKelly, an onstage storyteller, shares her own stories and videos of her father in “A Carlin Home Companion: Growing Up with George.”\n\nA version of the show was first presented in November 2010 during a comedy-theme cruise, was refined in front of audiences at the Comedy & Magic Club’s lounge annex, and now is staged regularly at the Santa Monica Playhouse.\n\nThe next scheduled presentation is May 24, with return dates planned monthly July through December.\n\n“I play videos of my dad. I tell stories of my life with him,” Carlin said. “The first half is the effect of him, my mom, his career and his personal life on me told through the eyes of a child. The second half is me becoming an adult … his opinion of my life.\n\n“Ultimately, it’s a beautiful story of a family that went through hard times, but we always loved, had a really fun reconciliation – not that we were ever estranged. It’s really touching.”\n\nLeo Smith\n\n310-543-6617\n\nleo.smith@dailybreeze.com"
