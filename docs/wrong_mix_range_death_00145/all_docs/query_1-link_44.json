        "text": "I know my esteemed colleague John Sinkevics has already covered some of this ground, but I felt the need to express my sadness about the passing of George Carlin.\n\nAs an intern in the summer of 1997, I had the chance to interview the influential comedian before a Grand Rapids tour stop. I found this quote particularly revelatory:\n\n\"I challenge myself to do things that test the line. I don't know if I think of it as a challenge to the audience. I guess that's a fair definition of it. I like to threaten their beliefs.\n\n\"I don't (challenge people) for the good of society; I don't care about society. I do it for the entertainment value. I'm certainly not a social messenger. I really don't care what happens in this country. What I'm concerned with is the artistic and entertainment value of what I do.\"\n\nMore George Carlin\n\n•\n\nGeorge Carlin mourned as counterculture hero\n\n•\n\nSound Check: Even conservative West Michigan loved Carlin\n\n•\n\nThe Ann Arbor News remembers George Carlin interview\n\n•\n\nProject Mayhem: A skeptic, not a cynic\n\n•\n\nHeller: who's gonna tell me what to do with all my stuff?\n\n•\n\nAP Video: Carlin dies at 71\n\n•\n\nGeorge Carlin: In his own words\n\n•\n\nGeorgeCarlin.com\n\n•\n\nCarlin's standup on YouTube\n\nI'm guessing Carlin changed his tune a bit in the years since. His most recent (of many) HBO stand-up specials found him treading political territory -- his trademark goofy observations on life and language merged with angry, spirited rants about the Bush administration and the meaning of freedom. He might bristle at the descriptive, but his material was inspirational fuel for the disenfranchised, which seem to have increased in number in these times of social upheaval.\n\nMore than a decade ago, I remember asking Carlin whether he was cynical, which prompted another revelatory response:\n\n\"Cynicism has a secondary meaning that can be applied to the kind of attitude I hold, but I don't subscribe to that. I call it skepticism. I think the real cynics are the people that decide how many people can die in a gas tank explosion and have the company absorb the lawsuits without changing the gas tank.\"\n\nCarlin's skepticism is what I admired the most. Skepticism about conventional wisdom, from how we speak to what we believe. No one questioned authority with such wit or insight; guys like Bill Maher and Bill Hicks carried the torch that Carlin lit. And appropriately, he broadened the definition of what funnymen do."
