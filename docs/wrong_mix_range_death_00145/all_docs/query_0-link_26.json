        "text": "Listen to this episode on Earwolf.\n\nThe Cheat Sheet\n\nWe love to build up our heroes (such as George Carlin). We also like to tear ’em down. But what about humanizing them? (29:05)\n\nBeing the daughter of a famous comedian is a constant dance of trying to find your own identity. (32:58)\n\nA love of learning, combined with competitiveness, ambition, and perfectionism, runs in the Carlin family. (40:57)\n\nAnd so much more…\n\nMore About this Episode\n\nKevin opens the show with giving his love to the families and victims of the Paris terrorist attacks.\n\nKelly Carlin’s memoir, A Carlin Home Companion: Growing Up with George, is out. It’s been a book of the month in Playboy, written about in Vanity Fair, and featured on NPR’s All Things Considered. But this book isn’t a biography about George Carlin, though Kelly says that that’s what a lot people assume. Nor is this just about George Carlin’s comedic genius, cocaine addiction, and alcoholism. More so, this is a book about Kelly finding her own voice as she steps out from under the shadow of her father’s brilliance.\n\nKelly has been on a whirlwind tour promoting her book. In today’s show, she reveals to Kevin that she’s fed up with how interviewers sometimes over focus on her father. She says that they often just “want to talk about their experiences with my Dad” (14:12). She adds, “I’m grateful to receive [their] stories about my father — but twenty minutes of them? Can we move on? Maybe we could talk about what it was like to write the book or something” (14:35).\n\nBefore she wrote her memoir, she wrote a one-woman show, “Driven to Distraction,” in the 1990s. It was partly about the spiritual awakening she experienced concerning her mother’s death. Prior to performing it, she sent the script to her dad. Kelly tells the story: “He said, ‘We have to talk … At your therapist’s office.’ And I knew, ‘Oh, this is going to be one of those life changing conversations. There will be boxes of Kleenex involved’” (20:32).\n\nWhen Kelly first told her dad that she was thinking about writing a memoir, she tells Kevin (23:15): “He said to me these strange words. ‘Real artists start with their autobiographical work, but then they move on. Like me. I did Class Clown. I did Occupation: Foole. And then I moved on to other stuff.’ And I’m sitting there going, ‘Yeah, that makes perfect sense’ — in the moment. Of course, I got home and went, ‘Wait a minute! That makes no sense! What about Richard Pryor? That’s a man who never moved on.”\n\nThis relates to an insight into her dad that she’s only fully grasped now that she’s been talking about him so much recently — that he rarely talked about his personal life (23:49). On stage, he talked about the world at large, things like the “seven dirty words”, things like consumerism and materialism (see: A Place for My Stuff). Rarely did he, for instance, talk about his only child or his wife.\n\nKelly isn’t so much an extrovert that she’d want to be on stage — as either a stand-up comic or an actor — five nights a week. Her most recent show, which shares the title with her memoir, came about quite serendipitously. As she tells Kevin, Lewis Black mentioned to her that he was pulling together a bunch of funny friends to do a comedy cruise- — and there was a spot open for her. She took it. On the cruise, in her performance, she would show a clip of her dad, then tell the story behind it. She did this repeatedly, ending with Kelly talking about her dad’s death. By then, she says, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house. After the cruise, Paul Provenza encouraged her to work her performance into a show, which she later performed for five weeks at the Falcon Theatre, in Burbank, California. It was that show that forms the backbone of her memoir.\n\nThanks Kelly Carlin!\n\nIf you enjoyed this show, send Kelly a quick shout out on her Twitter or Facebook.\n\nAlso say hi to Kevin on Twitter and to our KPCS producers, Jaime Fox’s Twitter and Samm Levine’s Twitter.\n\nOther People Mentioned in this Episode\n\nComedians Tom Shillue, Dennis Miller, Flip Wilson, Shecky Greene, Lily Tomlin, and Marty Feldman.\n\nComedian Dana Carvey and his two sons Dex and Tom.\n\nActors Christopher Walken and Jeff Bridges.\n\nCary Grant and Dyan Cannon’s daughter, Jennifer Grant.\n\nThe Dalai Lama.\n\nCool Stuff and Selected Links from this Episode\n\nKelly Carlin’s official website: TheKellyCarlinSite.com\n\nGet Kelly’s memoir, A Carlin Home Companion: Growing Up with George, from Amazon, IndieBound, or Google Play.\n\nAdd the book to your Goodreads or like it on Facebook.\n\n“Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks”: a short cartoon; a clip of “I hate meeces to pieces.”\n\nKelly’s podcast, “Waking from the American Dream,” on iTunes and SoundCloud.\n\nThe NPR/All Things Considered interview, “Life With A Comedian Isn’t Always Funny: Growing Up In George Carlin’s Shadow.”\n\nVanity Fair’s article, “How George Carlin’s Daughter Kelly Lost a Father but Gained a Family of Comedians — and Her Voice.”\n\nCheck out Kelly in Kevin’s documentary, Misery Loves Comedy.
