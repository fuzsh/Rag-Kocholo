Patricia Baxter, 42, a neighbor, Harold L. Culler, 60, also of Burbank, and Mrs. Baxter's five Children were killed instantly in the crash about 13 miles north of here, the CHP said. The seven were reportedly traveling to Carson City, NV, to visit relatives. The five children were identified as John, 16, Tina, 14, Michel, 12, Patricia, 10, and Tanya, 7. The driver of the semi-truck, Francisco G. Flores, 25, of Lake View Terrace, was treated for minor injuries officials said.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BURBANK MOTHER, 5 CHILDREN DIE IN FIERY HIGHWAY CRASH, Burbank Daily Review, June 29, 1974.

Baxter, 42, of North Frederic Street, and her children, John, 17, Tina, 15, Michelle, 12, Patricia, 10 and Tanya, 8. Burbank police investigator Jeff Pratt, who was asked by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department to notify the children's father of the accident, said a logging truck apparently went out of control and hit the camper the vacationing family was riding in. The camper burst into flames. All the victims, Pratt said, were apparently burned beyond recognition. But investigators were able to identify them through other information. The father, Bill Baxter, also of Burbank has been divorced from the children's mother. No arrangements have been made yet for services. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Los Angeles Times, July 2, 1974, Patricia Lee Baxter, services for Patricia Lee Baxter and her 5 children, John William, Tina Lee, Michelle Jean, Patricia Kathleen and Tanya Lee.

He was a warm and sincere person whose good nature and unselfishness made him an outstanding complement to our teams and to the school community.\n\nGenevieve Cowden Sultenfuss, BHS 1928\n\nLongtime Glendale resident Genevieve Sultenfuss, who achieved several firsts for women in realty and community leadership, died on Sunday. She was 104. Her legacy included serving as the first female president of both the Glendale Assn. of Realtors and later the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. \"Genevieve was a kind soul, she was a wonderful role model, and a beautiful spirit,\" said Councilwoman Paula Devine during Tuesday's City Council meeting. \"She touched a lot of lives in her 104 years. She will not be forgotten.\" Sultenfuss was born on Aug. 12, 1910, in Colorado. She moved with her family to Burbank in 1923 and graduated from Burbank High School. She worked as a legal secretary for 10 years before moving onto a career selling homes in Glendale. In 1955, she opened her own realty firm, Glendale Properties Inc., and worked in real estate for 30 years before retiring. She was president of the Realtor association in 1968 and recalled in a 2005 interview with the News-Press what it was like to be in that kind of role while she was surrounded predominantly by men. \"I just worked and worked and when people asked me to do something, I didn't know how to say 'no,'\" Sultenfuss said. \"I took it very slowly at first and didn't want to try and dictate to all these men what to do.\" She was also named Realtor of the Year by the association in 1972. Rick Barnes, the association's current president, said he first met Sultenfuss in 1976 and referred to her as a \"stateswoman\" for her decades of community involvement. \"For me, she was the standard of excellence as a leader,\" he said in a phone interview. \"She had a code of excellence and she lived it.\" Sultenfuss also won the Woman of Achievement award in 1977, bestowed by the News-Press. She was named president of the chamber of commerce that year and was a past president of Soroptomist International of Glendale, a volunteer organization for business and professional women, which she joined in 1961 and was a member of for 50 years. Sultenfuss was also the first woman to earn the Glendale Bar Assn.'s Liberty Bell Award. A big party in 2010 honoring Sultenfuss' 100th birthday was held at the local Elk's Lodge with more than 250 close friends and family in attendance. The City Council adjourned in her memory on Tuesday. As a past chair of the city's Commission on the Status of Women, Devine said she once named Sultenfuss as the chair's Jewel in honor of her life's work. During the council meeting, Devine fondly recalled another milestone for women Sultenfuss accomplished — being the first female member of the all-male Verdugo Club. \"She felt that there would be some concern if she let people know, so every time she went to a meeting, she would take a male guest so that everyone would think he was the member and she was the guest,\" Devine said. \"That was her sense of humor.\" Funeral arrangements are still pending and Sultenfuss' family members are encouraging donations be made in her honor to Soroptomist International of Glendale.\n\nLeslie Charles Bruckner, Former BHS Teacher/Coach\n\nLeslie C. Bruckner 1918 - 2014 Leslie Charles Bruckner was born in April 16, 1918 in Monroe, Michigan, youngest son of Austin and Matilda Bruckner, and died in September, 2014 in Pasadena, California. Football and family were the cornerstones of his life. From his small southeastern Michigan hometown of Milan in the 1930s tales of Les' athletic skill reached recruiters from mighty Michigan State University. Bruckner joined the Spartans backfield and made an immediate impact on the football field. He was also a shot putter on the track team. Les was in the starting lineup when Michigan State played Auburn in the first Orange Bowl game in Miami in 1938. A member of the greatest generation, Les Bruckner was a lieutenant in the United States Navy serving in the Pacific during World War II. Postwar, Les made a brief run at the National Football League, playing a part of one season with the Chicago Cardinals in 1945. In 2014 he became the oldest surviving player from the Chicago-St. Louis-Arizona Cardinals NFL franchise. Les married Joan Olds of Ypsilanti, Michigan, daughter of Dr. L.W. Olds, a track coach and later director of athletics at Eastern Michigan University. Les fathered two sons- Doug and Scott-and in 1949 the family moved to Burbank where Les was a successful football coach at Burbank High School. On weekends in the 1950s Les enjoyed taking his older boy to the Coliseum where the new NFL team, the Rams, were the toast of the football world. It was just one of many outings fondly remembered by the sons of a devoted father. When the boys were older they joined their Dad on camping trips to national parks and monuments in the American West and were encouraged-never pushed-when they pursued their own football dreams at Burbank High School. An academic as well as an athlete, with a Masters Degree from the University of Michigan, Les was a respected history teacher at Burbank High School. In 1962 he broadened his background in his chosen field, taking Joan and their son Scott to Europe on a six-month sabbatical trip traveling the North Atlantic on an Italian line steamship. Summers in the 1950s and 60s Les Bruckner, with the able assistance of his wife Joan, launched two successful small businesses in Burbank. He created the Bulldog Club day camps and later the Les Bruckner Swim School. After leaving coaching, and still teaching, Les began a highly successful \"third act\" in his football life-- an official. Les worked his way up from high school games to major college sports and in the 1970s was a regular on officiating crews in the Pacific Eight Conference. Les worked as an umpire on the fabled gridirons of Notre Dame Stadium, the Los Angeles Coliseum, and the old Stanford Stadium. In 1972 Les was again in a major bowl game when he was assigned as umpire on the officiating crew for the Rose Bowl game between the University of Washington and Michigan Wolverines. Inspired by his father and his own love of the game, Scott also became involved in football officiating at the high school level. Scott was thrilled to actually take the field with his Dad as a fellow \"striped shirt,\" and remembers the professionalism of his father and the respect Les received from players, coaches and other members of the officiating team. Les was honored with an invitation to tour Asian U.S. military bases to conduct football officials clinics and traveled with his wife Joan to Japan, the Philippines and South Korea. The move of NFL's Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982 provided Les with one more opportunity to be involved in pro football. The Raiders hired Les as a member of the \"chain gang\" and he manned the down boxes at the LA Coliseum until the Raiders returned to Oakland in 1995. In 1993 Les was a member of the down box in the Rose Bowl at Super Bowl XXVII between the Cowboys and Bills. In 2012 the Pac 12 Officials Association inducted Les Bruckner into their Field of Honor in a ceremony in Palo Alto. Les' amazing longevity and versatility in the football world was truly remarkable, but even more noteworthy was Les Bruckner's dedication to his family. Despite all the honors, Les was proudest of being a family man and celebrated not his own considerable achievements, but the accomplishments of his loving wife and his two sons. Les Bruckner was laid to rest at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California. Les is survived by his wife Joan, his son Doug, his son Scott and daughter-in-law Dona, his grandchildren Andrew, Aleece, Anya and Amanda and great grandchildren, Jack, Jake and Jia. . Published in the Los Angeles Times from Sept. 27 to Sept. 28, 2014\n\nEdwin S. Schaller Jr., BHS 1947?\n\nEdwin S. Schaller Jr. MBA ’66 was born on Jan. 16, 1929 and died Sept. 16, 2012. A former resident of Los Gatos, Ed was born in Chicago, Ill., and raised in Burbank, Calif. He attended Burbank High School, where he excelled in sports and served as senior class president. He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA and was extremely proud of his membership in the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He later attended Santa Clara University, where he earned his MBA. Shortly before graduating from UCLA, Ed was offered a job at Lockheed (following in his father's footsteps); this would become his home for the next 39 years. In 1954, a newly assigned secretary in his division, Diane Topp, caught his eye. They were married a year later in the Santa Barbara Mission chapel on Valentine's Day \"so I wouldn't forget our anniversary!\" In 1957, Ed was transferred to Sunnyvale and assigned to work on the Polaris Missile Program. He traveled extensively and never would, or maybe never could, talk about the nature of his work. Diane and Ed raised their 3 boys in Los Gatos and for 10 years Ed coached each as they rose through the ranks of the Quito Little League. Ed was also active in YMCA Indian Guides Gray-Y, in which he coached basketball flag football. He loved the outdoors, especially skiing fishing. The Family skied at Dodge Ridge, thawed out at the Mi-Wuk Motor Lodge, then headed off to Kelly's for dinner and a little pinball. Ed and his boys fished together at Yosemite's Saddlebag Lake and, in turn, they taught their own kids how to fish there. In April 2000, Ed and Diane moved to Rocklin, Calif. Diane was diagnosed with cancer in June of that year and passed away in August. Diane was the perfect housewife, but Ed surprised us all by making a home for himself and surviving 12 years without her support. He was active in the Springfield Senior community, especially at the fitness center, until a circulatory condition hampered his mobility. He kept much to himself, living quietly, enjoying daily crosswords puzzles, watching news on CNN and rooting for his beloved San Francisco Giants, UCLA Bruins, and adopted Sacramento Kings. Ed was lovingly cared for by his entire family during his final days, and he passed away peacefully with his son, Todd, by his side. Not surprisingly, his final words were, \"Did the Giants win?\" They sure did, Dad! Ed is predeceased by his parents, Edwin Spencer Schaller Sr and Ruth Eppinger Schaller, and is survived by his children- Mark (Amy) Schaller, Adam (Tricia) Schaller, Todd (Cherie) Schaller, and grandchildren- Trace, Alexandria, and Spencer, and Nik Robbins; and a sister, Jan Borchers Adams.\n\nJack Warren Morris, BHS 1954\n\nJack Warren Morris, BHS 1954\n\n(February 28, 1935 to May 04, 2014 )\n\nResident of Ukiah, California Jackie Warren Morris, 79, died May 4th, 2014 after a short illness, surrounded by his children at the home of his daughter in Austin, Texas. Jack was born in Red Mound, OK, on February 28th, 1935.\n\nLike millions of other people fleeing from the Dust Bowl, his parents moved their family to the West Coast and settled in Burbank, CA. Jack grew up running between Orange trees in the beautiful valley and watched as the city grew and expanded before his eyes. Jack showed a talent for cutting hair from an early age, and began cutting his father’s hair at the age of 13. Jack graduated from Burbank High School in 1954. After graduating, Jack became ill with Rheumatic Fever and had to stay in the hospital for a month. When he recovered he went on to Barber Collage.\n\nMany members of his extended family also migrated to the Southern California area. He would travel up and down highway 99, visiting them and drag racing any one he could. He met the love of his life, Colette Roell, and married her in 1958. Jack and Colette had three children while living in Burbank, CA. When the Los Angeles area smog became too oppressive, they moved their family to the Ukiah Valley, as it met all their criteria: a small town that had a Catholic School, a barber shop, was smog free, and surrounded by nature’s beauty. They had their fourth child after arriving in Ukiah.\n\nIn time, Jack took over the Barber Shop at Jenson’s Truck Stop. His clients became his friends, and for over 45 years Jack enjoyed seeing people come through his doors. Stories, jokes, and straight talk filled his shop. Many a child was instructed to “sit still” on his first haircut, and many a haircut was given for free. Some of his clients were out of state truckers, waiting until their next trip to Ukiah for a haircut and a visit to “The Flat-Top King”, as Jack was affectionately known. His long career served both the young and the elderly, including house calls to friends who were unable to leave their homes. Many of his clients had children, and later those children had children, who in turn became his clients. Generations of Ukiah residents told him that they “grew up” in his barber shop.\n\nJack had a big heart, and several life-long friends called him “The most honest man I’ve ever known“. He was very moved that his retirement was noted on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal to commemorate the occasion. In his younger years, Jack embraced his inner racer, either drag racing on the “strip” in Los Angeles, on “the 99”, and later on the ¼ mile oval race track in Ukiah. In 1956 he won a drag racing trophy for having the Fastest Stock Car in Los Angeles County, his treasured 1956 Chevrolet 210 Sport Coupe. He always had one foot on the brake and the other on the gas. After recuperating from knee surgery complications that kept him away from driving for several years, he took a driving test to regain his license in December, 2013. The instructor said that he was the best driver she had ridden with in years.\n\nAs his family grew, Jack took them on day and camping trips to see all the splendors of Mendocino County, from the Coast to Lake Pillsbury, from the swimming holes of the Russian River below Hopland to an Uncle’s ranch north of Laytonville. He taught his children how to water-ski, with summer days and nights too numerous to count being spent on the waters of Lake Mendocino. The location of his shop at the truck stop gave easy access to large inner tubes, and Jack would load his pickup full of tubes and kids for excursions floating down the Russian river. Jack and Colette were active in the community, and raised their family in the arms of St. Mary’s Catholic Church and School. Jack was a member of both the Elks Lodge and Masonic Lodge, in which he took great pride. Jack enjoyed playing in the Ukiah pool and bowling leagues.\n\nAfter he retired, Jack and Colette loved playing golf, and traveled in their RV around the Western United States. Their trips included visiting friends and family in TX, OK, OR, WA and Canada. He enjoyed travels with the Elks Wapitis. Jack was planning to return to Ukiah after his granddaughter, Siena, graduated in May. He was looking forward to seeing all his old friends. Jack was preceded in death by his parents, Plomer Harold Morris and Ota Mae Miller, his beloved sister, Evelyn M. Nelson, and his cherished wife of 55 years, Colette T. Morris. He is survived by his four children, their spouses and grandchildren: David and Elaine Morris (Amanda and Heather), Dale and Kim Morris (Greg and Sara). Merrie Morris-Mazzetti and Rob Mazzetti (Siena and Cordell), and Charles and Janet Morris (Christopher and Jonathan). He leaves behind many friends and family he dearly loved.\n\nA viewing will be at Eversole Mortuary, May 29th , from 2 to 8 P.M. The funeral will be held at St. Mary’s Catholic Church, May 30th, 11:00 AM. The burial will follow at Russian River Cemetery in Ukiah. A reception and celebration of Jack’s life will be held at The Elks Lodge following burial. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Elks Lodge Major Projects Fund, a charity that provides free physical therapy to disabled children.\n\nOsar Carlos Pokorny, BHS 1965\n\nOscar Carlos Pokorny was surrounded by family and friends when he went home to be with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, on Saturday, July 26, 2014. Oscar was born in Marfa, Texas, on May 25, 1946. He was the son of Anton Ludwig Pokorny and Fay Pokorny, and younger brother of Tony Pokorny. Oscar's family moved from Texas to Burbank, California in 1951. Oscar graduated Burbank High school in 1965 and worked at Senior Aerospace SSP from 1965 to 1980. He was drafted into the US Army in 1965. Private Pokorny was trained in the construction and repair of roads, railroads, and bridges. He also received instruction in demolitions and mine warfare. He attended LA Trade Tech where he received his welding certification. Oscar married his high school sweetheart, Angela Ann Franchino, on May 9, 1970. They had two children, his favorite daughter, Victoria Lynn Pokorny, and his favorite son, Eric Joseph Pokorny. From 1982 to 1984, he was a development bench mechanic at Litton Data Systems. He then transferred employment to become part of the Skunk Works department at Lockheed Martin in Burbank and also in Palmdale. He was so proud to have made parts and scaffolding for the Space Shuttle. After a large layoff, Oscar did contract work on animated projects such as the dragon at the Excalibur in Las Vegas, the Water World set at Universal Studios, and Wizard of Oz at the MGM Grand. In 1995, Oscar went back to Senior Aerospace SSP and just recently retired on July 11, 2014. For many years Oscar was an active member of Calvary Bible Church in Burbank. He would either be in the kitchen cooking, or clean-up crew — usually both! Oscar loved the outdoors. Fishing, Bar-B-Qing and camping brought him much joy. He was a very creative man who enjoyed drawing, whittling, and making miniatures. Oscar leaves behind a loving family including: Wife, Angela Pokorny Daughter, Vicki Pokorny Son and daughter-in-law: Eric and Jessica Pokorny Father: Anton Pokorny and Lucille Trcka Brother and sister-in-law: Tony and Ginny Pokorny Brother-in-law and Sister-in-law: Peter and Barbara Franchino Nephews and Nieces: Weston and Christine Pokorny, Jason Pokorny, Mark and Julie Gordon Baretto, Devin and Michelle Franchino Great Nephews and Nieces: Kyle Gordon, Mitchell Gordon, Simone Franchino, Tony Pokorny, and Kimberly Pokorny And countless uncles, aunts and cousins. Oscar was a loving son, faithful husband, and hands-on father. He was also a kind-hearted in-law, fun loving cousin, crazy uncle, and true friend. Oscar was sixty-eight years old when he died of a weak heart, but he was the strongest man we knew. Sleep with the angels, Oscar. In Lieu of flowers the family is asking for donations to either of the following organizations. http://main.nationalmssociety.org/goto/ericpokorny 2014 - In loving memory of Oscar C.

Carole began life near the Minnesota/Iowa border on the family farm. After her father's death in 1961 she moved to California with her mother and younger brother in 1963, and settled in Burbank in 1964 on Jamestown Rd. She began 7th grade at John Muir with most of us that Fall, now almost 50 years ago. In 9th grade she and Randy Ivey became a lifelong couple. Carole was a Trojan, graduating from the University of Southern California in 1974, where she began after graduatuon from BHS in 1970. That summer after USC graduation she and Randy were married at Salem Lutheran Church in Glendale on August 10, 1974. Carole's passing comes less than three weeks before their 40th wedding anniversary. Besides Randy, Carole leaves their daughter, Megan, age 30; their son, Travis, age 34, his wife, Tina, and their children - Carole's granddaughter, Makenna, and grandson, Gavin, ages 10 and 7; her brother, Roger Starkey (BHS '72), his wife and their family; her aunt, Karen of Arizona; her brother-in-law, Mike Ivey (BHS '72), his wife and their family; her brother-in-law, Jim Dyer (BHS '69), and his family; and three step-brothers and their families. Carole's mother passed away less than a year ago, on August 8, 2013. Her step-father passed away five years before that, also on August 8, in 2008. Sister-in-law, Debi Ivey Dyer, passed away in 2009. In early March of this year Carole received the confirmation after testing that she had an aortic aneurysm. It was determined that she would undergo two surgeries, sort of a phase 1 and a phase 2, to repair/correct the aneurysm. Last Wednesday, July 16, she had the first surgery at Kaiser-Sunset Hospital in the Hollywood area. That surgery went well, and accomplished what was desired. On Friday the 18th Carole's close friend, Donna Snyder Moore (BHS '71) took Carole home from the hospital. The second surgery was scheduled for September 4. Two days ago, on Monday afternoon, I spoke to Carole on the phone, and we talked for about 45 minutes. She was in good spirits, although sore all over from her surgery. Little did I know that would be the last time I would talk to her. Carole's daughter, Megan, had been staying overnight with her since she got home from the hospital on Friday. Yesterday morning before Megan left for work she saw Carole. Later on when Megan tried to reach Carole by phone several times, without success, she called nearby friends and asked them to check on Carole. The friend went in Carole's home and found her on the sofa, already gone. The fire department arrived and confirmed her passing. It was determined that the aneurysm had ruptured, taking her so suddenly. Of course a total shock to all of Carole's family. About the beginning of June Randy began feeling poorly. They saw his doctor, blood tests were taken, but no problem was pinned down. He kept getting worse at home. On Father's Day, June 15, he was taken to the ER at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia. He was admitted into ICU by that evening. Randy is a severe diabetic, and it was soon determined that he had Strep B infection probably caused from a \"wound\" on his leg that had already gone into Sepsis (blood infection) by the time he entered the hospital. The next morning he was placed on a ventilator. He remained in ICU at Henry Mayo Newhall for a week, and then was moved by an ICU ambulance down to Kaiser Hospital in Panorama City to their ICU. I happened to be there when that took place. Randy remained there for over four more weeks, almost the entire time in the ICU on the ventilator, with a couple of brief times in a \"step-down\" unit and off the vent. I last saw him a week ago Friday when Janet Di Sarro and I saw him in the ICU again. He has been sedated, and also is not fully coherent yet after being so ill for so long. Two days ago he was finally moved to a rehab facility, but faces a long recovery after being this sick. He is still not fully aware or fully coherent. Randy hasn't been told yet about Carole's death. Those of you who pray, please do so for Randy, for Megan and Travis as they face the loss of their mother who was very close to both of them, and for them as they face having to tell Randy at some point what has happened to Carole.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Henry Stollmeyer, BHS 1946\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Henry Stollmeyer, BHS 1946 Sept. 29, 1928 — March 16, 2014 Mountain Democrat (Placerville, CA) - Monday, April 7, 2014 William \"Bill\" Henry Stollmeyer, 85, passed away at home peacefully of natural causes on March 16, 2014, in Apple Valley, Calif. Bill was born to Henry \"Hank\" and Doris E. Melvin Stollmeyer on Sept. 29, 1928, in Burbank, Calif. He was the brother to two younger sisters, Betty Jane and Lauretta Lee. As a teenager, he enjoyed taking classes in architecture, riding horses, taking violin lessons and working on his car. When not in school, he worked at a grocery store, which may have inspired his entrepreneurial spirit. In 1946, Bill graduated from Burbank High and joined the U.S. Navy. He served four years during the Korean War. After being stationed in San Diego, he was transferred to Pensacola, Fla. Before transferring, former high school friends Jim and Eleanor introduced him to Betty Alice St. Clair. Soon after, Bill and Betty were married on Nov. 6, 1949, in Pensacola. Two years later they welcomed their first daughter, Christine. For three years, Bill was stationed at Pensacola at the U.S. Naval Air Station, Saufley Field. He was an Aviation Machinist's Mate and in charge of having the planes ready each morning for takeoff. He was assigned to the USS Valley Forge. He was honorably discharged in July 1952. Happily, Bill, Betty and Christine returned to their native state of California and settled in Granada Hills, where their second daughter, Pamela, was born. Here, Bill enjoyed working for his uncle Neil at his lighting fixture business in Van Nuys, Calif. Eventually, the family moved to Pleasant Valley, where Bill and Betty established a grocery store, Bill's Ranch Market, which they ran for eight years working seven days a week. He was also interested in building homes and built seven houses around the Pleasant Valley/Placerville area. When building, he was known to hand select each board for his projects. When friends or family members needed house plans, ideas for remodeling, or help with the building of their home or vacation home, he was always happy to share his ideas, expertise or elbow grease. Bill and Betty resided in the Placerville area until 1970, when they sold the grocery store and moved to Oak Harbor, Wash., where they reconnected with a former Navy buddy/family (Ed and Jeanne), but returned to California the following year. In the mid '90s, they again moved from California to Apache Junction, Ariz. In Arizona, they enjoyed forming numerous new friendships while maintaining the old. Through the years they enjoyed traveling to California and Utah visiting their daughters, four grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren, trips to Hawaii and a memorable Panama Canal cruise with long time friends Eva and Campbell. Bill was a member of the Apple Valley American Legion and the American Legion in Placerville. His achievements were many but perhaps his biggest disappointment was when Betty, his wife of nearly 50 years, suddenly passed away from an aneurism in 1999. Five years later, Bill remarried Roberta Eaton, a California native, on July 10, 2003, in Laughlin, Nev. Subsequently, the couple returned to California and settled in Apple Valley, where Bill passed away. Bill is survived by his wife, Roberta; his daughters, Christine (Ed) Stetler and Pamela Denicke; stepchildren, Eugene (Pam) Eaton and Ginny (Dan) Campa; three grandchildren, Heather Stetler, Christa Denicke Lindhardt and Brandon Denicke; three California great-grandchildren, Joe, Josie and Talon; four Utah great-grandchildren, Ethan, Avery, Kimberlee and Krew; sisters, Betty Jane (Jim) St. Clair and Lauretta (Perry) DeWeese; nephews, Brad and Carey St. Clair and Scott DeWeese; niece, Jerilyn DeWeese; a favorite Uncle, Dick (Leora) Melvin; and many beloved cousins. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Betty Alice; his parents; eldest grandchild, Shannon Stetler; great-granddaughter, Hope Stetler; and a brother-in-law, Perry DeWeese, who Bill loved like a brother. Ever proud of being a U.S. Navy veteran and honoring Bill's wishes, a memorial is scheduled on Monday, April 7, at Riverside National Cemetery, at 12:45 p.m. The Apple Valley American Legion will officiate. Arrangements are being handled by High Desert Funeral Chapel. Interment is at Riverside National Cemetery. Bill will be remembered for many reasons, but primarily for possessing a strong work ethic."
