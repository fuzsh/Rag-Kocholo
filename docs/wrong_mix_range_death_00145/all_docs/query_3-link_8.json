Carlin may not have been in a band, but he was metal as fuck! He was most famously know for his Seven Dirty Words routine, but the above routine may be my all time favorite.\n\nUpdate: The New York Times wrote a great obituary to Carlin definitely worth checking out.\n\nLONG LIVE GEORGE FUCKING CARLIN!"
