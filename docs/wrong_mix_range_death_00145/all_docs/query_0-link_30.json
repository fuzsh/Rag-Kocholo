        "text": "John Muir Jr High School (now John Muir Middle School)\n\nToday is the 45th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination and I was thinking about where I was on that day. It was 1963 and we, the BHS class of '67, were in 9th grade - some at Luther and the rest of us at Muir. (The other Luther students and all those from Jordan Junior High went to John Burroughs High School.)\n\nI remember standing in the hall between classes when someone said, \"The President's been shot!\" Stunned by those words, I didn't know what to think. Years later after the movie, \"JFK\" came out in 1991, more questions arose. Today, I doubt the 'official' story the world was told.\n\nIn any case, it is interesting that I just received the following email from Cathy Nicholls Coyle regarding John Muir. I'm not sure who did the graphic, but I remember watching them make it in my art class - a linoleum or wood carving - pretty cool! Thanks Cathy.\n\nLook what I found...\n\nHi CP:\n\nI was looking through some old paperwork and came across this old John Muir Junior High School Promotion Program from 1964. Thought it would be good to share with our classmates who attended John Muir. Maybe those who went to Luther and Jordan can scan and post theirs too.\n\nCathy\n\n(Click on program to enlarge)\n\n--- end ---\n\nA LITTLE MUIR HISTORY...\n\nThe Burbank John Muir school building still looks the same from when we went there 1962-1964!\n\nKnown as John Muir Middle School today, the school first came into being in 1922 when a separate school for the 7th and 8th grades was organized and called John Muir Intermediate School. John Muir started out with less than two hundred students and six teachers. The John Muir Parent Teachers Association was formed in 1923 and has been an active, integral part of the school ever since. The 9th grade was added to John Muir Intermediate School in 1925 and the name of the school was changed to Burbank Junior High School.\n\nAt this time there were 670 students and about 25 teachers. In 1929 the name of the school was changed once again, to John Muir Junior High. The school's original location was at 220 East Grinnell Drive. In 1952, its current buildings were completed and the school was moved to 1111 Kenneth Road.\n\nFrom 1922 up until the present time, John Muir has had 11 principals. The first principal was Elliot B. Thomas who served for 8 years. Allan H. Burnside served the longest amount of time, 19 years, from 1962 to 1981. Under the tenure of William Kuzma, John Muir once again experienced change, sending the 9th grade to the high school and receiving the 6th grade from the elementary schools, becoming John Muir Middle School.\n\nEmergency Loop\n\nJust received this email from Pam Kirkwood and if you can help, thanks so much.\n\nHi there Loopers...\n\nWe would imagine you are all making ready for next week's Thanksgiving Holidays...We would ask you to remember all of those who have lost so much in last weekend's devistating fires here in Southern California.\n\nSpecifically, we have 2 classmates who lost their entire home in a matter of minutes last Saturday night. Cheryl Dibble BHS '64 and her sister Pam Dibble '65 lived at the Mobile Home Park in Sylmar that was almost totally destroyed...Pam and Cheryl got out with only the clothes on their backs, their pets and a couple of important items. Everything is GONE!\n\nI just talked to Cher this morning. They are temporarily staying with an old friend from High School, Phill Hayes '65...Cher related to me the horrors of Saturday night...What a nightmare for all...They will probably be going back tomorrow to sift through the rubble and ashes...\n\nI told her that in these times, we all have to help each other. She said that \"prayers\" were what they needed most and I told her that went without question. I told her that I would alert the \"Loop\" and we would see what happens.\n\nCher was able to buy some clothes and the insurance company told her to keep all of her receipts...We are thinking that probably the most useful things to help them get back on their feet would either be cash donations or gift cards...If any of you feel you can help, please send your donations to:\n\nCheryl and Pam Dibble\n\nc/o Phill Hays\n\n26588 Shakespeare Lane\n\nStevenson Ranch, CA 91381\n\nCher can be reached on her cell phone:\n\n(818) 205-5876\n\nThey managed to get their laptop out when they evacuated and can receive email at cwolf11@ca.rr.com\n\nNot sure how often they check it, as they are still pretty much in shock and are busy contacting insurance companies and figuring out what to do next.\n\nThank you for your prayers and any help you might be able to give, Loopers...\n\nTake care and a Blessed Thanksgiving to you and yours...\n\nLove, Pam and Jon\n\nLinda Muruz, class of '66, sent out an email tonight to her class which included a link to the following article on high school reunions which I hope you enjoy as much as I did!\n\nForty years after high school, a famed writer finds...\n\nYou Can Go Home Again\n\nBy James Grady\n\nParade Magazine\n\nPublication Date: 09/28/2008\n\nsource\n\nThis year, 8 million Americans are expected to attend their high school reunions—even though a national survey says 65% of reunion attendees don’t want to go through those years again.\n\nPersonally, I couldn’t wait to escape adolescence, to be somebody besides that gawky kid in my graduation photo. Yet, strangely enough, I’m one of those eager faces who showed up at my high school reunion. So why did I—and the 7,999,999 other people—go back?\n\nThis July, I finally found out, when I flew to my hometown of Shelby, Mont., to attend a reunion for everyone who went to its lone high school during the 1960s.\n\nMy rental car cruised into town along Main Street, where people called me Jimmy, not the James on my business cards today. The Roxy movie theater now has a brick façade, not there when my father was its manager. Old stores are gone, and vacant windows reflect little traffic.\n\nI saw the white box house where I grew up. How could it have been so small? I drove past the home of my unrequited adolescent crush, Linda, wondering if she and her husband would come to the reunion. Sprinklers hissed on the football field where I learned how to get knocked down, get up, and get knocked down again. And looming at the edge of town was the sprawling two-story pink cement building—my high school.\n\nOn Friday night, each of the graduating classes met at designated taverns. My 1967 class had 87 boys and girls. A third of my classmates and some spouses (not mine, who declined with a smile) gathered at the Tap Room, a wood-paneled bar decorated with a class banner.\n\nAmid squeals and laughter, I met friends wearing name tags that we sometimes needed. We swapped data about work, children, grandchildren, and what happened to our parents. Heartaches were related in stoic sentences, and nobody—nobody—whined.\n\nWe snapped pictures. We marveled at who went to prison and whose environmental entrepreneurship might help save the world. We were proud that Sandy, the woman voted “Most Likely To Succeed,” is now a counselor helping veterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder. We spoke gently about our own strung-out alums who were not there but whom we hoped still might recover. Nobody dwelled on politics or religion. E-mail addresses got jotted on the back of motel receipts. We kept scanning the crowd to see who came. (Linda and her husband didn’t make it.)\n\nWhat struck everyone I talked with is how little we actually knew back then. Lorna, a university staffer who was voted “Most Representative” of our class, told me: “We didn’t know who we were.” Nutritionist Mary Jeanne, who’d been voted “Best All Around,” said that she secretly thought she was the only one who was “scared and didn’t have a clue.”\n\nNone of us knew that one of the seemingly happiest guys in our class spent his nights using his fists to save his younger sister and mother from his stepfather’s beatings. Now a successful local businessman, he told me: “I thought that’s how it was for everybody.”\n\nReunions change reality. As one celebrant remarked, “The 10-year reunion is about impressing your former peers—showing them, and perhaps yourself, that you made it. By the 20th reunion, you get to just be yourself.”\n\nEleven years ago, at our 30th reunion, Wally sought out Randy. He had always felt a special connection, though they’d never dated. He walked up to her and said, “I came to see you.” Then he walked away. “I was so scared,” Randy told me. Two years later, she and Wally married, and they’re still going strong.\n\nGary, one of the reunion organizers who never left Shelby, whistled for the crowd in the Tap Room to quiet down. His voice trembled as he read the list of those forever gone: “Mike Jodrey, Rick Mauritson, Sue Turner…” We cheered for each name, but we didn’t cry. Instead, our emotions came out in the classic high school reunion hugs—hugs from someone you treasure more now than before. The hug from the woman you can’t remember who says she’d know you anywhere. The hug from an old girlfriend who was so right to dump you, the hugs of those who once shared hairbrushes in the girls’ room. Gene the airline tycoon hugged Kirby the family farmer. Sid the professor hugged Jesse the truck driver.\n\nThe hug meant we’re still here.\n\nDriving to the airport, I felt valued and validated, glad I had gone, gladder to be returning home. I clicked on my left blinker. Like any experienced motorist, I checked my mirrors—and saw my old pink high school.\n\nJust one last glance, and then it was gone.\n\nJames Grady is the author of “Six Days of the Condor.” His latest novel is “Mad Dogs.”\n\nNew England Cruise Report from Donna Luce Neitman\n\nThanks Donna for the update and so sorry to hear of your injury!! I hope you heal quickly and totally.\n\nHi Cathy,\n\nJust thought I'd drop you a line and share a few words and pic of the New England cruise I took with Cathy and John Coyle, Cathy's sisters Joan and twin Carol, their mom Katie, Joan's husband Don, my mom and brother Don (class of '70). Does that make sense?\n\nAnyway there were 9 of us. We had a wonderful time sharing lots of laughs, food and drink. We left from New York and ended in Quebec.\n\nOn the third day into the cruise however I was in Bar Harbor, Maine shopping with my brother when I stepped off the curb to take a picture and did not see the man-hole cover set a couple of inches lower than the street and down I went fracturing my discal fibula (the little bone on the outside of the foot). The peramedics came and scooped me up off the street and took me to emergency. They put me in a splint cast and the rest of the cruise I was pushed around in a wheel chair. John was a real trouper!! I managed as best I could to keep my \"spirits \" up with a little help from a \"Petite Sirah\".\n\nThe picture was taken at the welcome aboard dinner. Standing in the back row is me Donna (Luce) Neitman, John Coyle, Cathy (Nicholls) Coyle, Don Dempsey (Joan's husband), my mom Joan Luce and my brother Don Luce. Seated is Carol (Nicholls) Lebrecht, Katie Nickolls and Joan (Nicholls) Dempsey.\n\nLove reading all the stuff on the blog and would love for you to share this with our classmates.\n\nLove from Spokane, burrrr, but I love it,\n\nDonna\n\nNovember 7, 2008 UPDATE\n\nI asked for a photo showing the fall colors and Cathy Nicholls Coyle sent this beautiful one that was taken by her sister, Carol - thanks Twins!\n\nHere is the photo I was telling you about in the park in Quebec City. Joan is sitting on the bench and I am standing in the park. Can you see us?\n\nNovember 8, 2008 UPDATE\n\nCarol Nicholls Lebrecht sent a few more photos of the trip - thanks Carol - looks like ya'll had a blast!\n\nHi Cathy,\n\nMy family went on a New England/Canada Cruise in October. Here we are leaving New York City for our 10 day journey.\n\nWe had a wonderful time with the Luce Family. Donna had tried to coax Cathy to go on this cruise for a year. We were so glad we did. They were wonderful company.\n\nWe went on the cruise to see the fall colors. We were told it was a hit and miss thing. They had been having a lot of rain so the colors were just coming out. Here is a picture of a street in Newport, Rhode Island with St Mary's Church in the background. This is where John F Kennedy and Jackie Bouvier were married in 1953.\n\nThis is the Paul Revere statue in Boston. You can barely see the old North Church peaking thru the trees in the background.\n\nWe went on a Victorian Walking tour and learned of the \"Rusticators\" or the famous and wealthy people who came to Bar Harbor to live the Rustic life and built cottages along the waterfront.\n\nHere is some fall color in Bar Harbor, Maine. Donna didn't get to see much of Bar Harbor as she was at the emergency room getting her foot x-rayed.\n\nWe visited several ports in Canada. The most colorful was Quebec.\n\nThis is the beautiful Montmorency Park in Quebec.\n\nIt was a wonderful trip with family and friends. It wasn't long after we got home that my Mom was asking when we were going on the next cruise.\n\nCarol\n\nPhotos from Lindsay, Corby Grueter's Daughter\n\nReceived a couple of great photos from Lindsay Grueter, daughter of Corby Grueter ('65) today.\n\nThanks Lindsay and be sure to click here to see a few more pics of your dad!\n\nme and pops\n\nme and uncle chris and my dad\n\nEmail from Lindsay:\n\nJust saw a blog that you had posted desiring more information concerning my uncles Bob's death. Didn't know if I could be of any help.\n\nI'm attaching a photo of my father and I!!!

Ya'll look so happy!! http://bhsclass67.blogspot.com/\n\nAnd yes, can you share a bit more about how your Uncle Bob died? We have that it was July 3, 1990 - is this correct and where was he living at the time? (Pls see our memorial page)\n\nI was sad to learn of his death only a few months ago! In high school, your uncle was a great friend and we laughed a lot together. His father, your grandpa, was my geometry teacher - he too is a wonderful man. And your dad was the heart throb of all us younger girls in high school - hahaa!!\n\nblessings,\n\nCathy Palmer (BHS class of '67)\n\nSonoma, CA\n\nLindsay's reply:\n\nMy Dad says hello! I created a mini profile so we can keep in touch. I would love for you to post those pictures...I have soooo many more!!! Corby's not only my dad but my best friend on the face of the planet. My uncle robert died in 1988 not 90 from what my dad tells me! Don't know much more than that... don't remember ever meeting him but I know he was great. My grandma and grandpa passed a few years back as well...actually it's been closer to 6-7 years now.\n\n11/5/2008 UPDATE:\n\nWhen I asked Lindsay if Chris was another brother, here's what she wrote:\n\nHe's Chris DALE...Jennifer Dale's brother. I call him my uncle because he and my dad have been so close all of their lives and there just like brothers. I'm not sure what years they graduated to be honest, i'll have to ask my dad when he gets back from the beach. I know he and chris were gettin up early this morning to go surfing down in daytona where they live. (so jealous)\n\nMay 5, 2009 UPDATE\n\nFound Lindsay's blog: http://corbygrueter.blogspot.com/"
