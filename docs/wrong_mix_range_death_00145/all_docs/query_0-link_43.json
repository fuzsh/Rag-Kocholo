It wasn’t perfect, but we made friends quickly, had a great church congregation, and come on: we wore flip-flops on New Year’s Day! \nThings were really looking up! \n2 1/2 months later a global pandemic completely shut the film industry down, I lost my job, and had no prospects. \nWe came back to Utah and lived in my in-laws basement collecting unemployment checks for several months, before I was able to start doing remote editing work. \n\nIt was one of the worst times of my life. So I started making YouTube videos with a friend of mine. \n\nLife is unpredictable and hard and messy and beautiful. \n\nI love it here in Utah, but I still want to move back to LA. Who knows what’s going to happen? Certainly not me.\".",
