        "text": "George Carlin was the last person you’d expect to have anything to say about white papers.\n\nThe trail-blazing American comic was better known for his profane and cutting social criticism.\n\nBut I’ve discovered a strong link between one of the comic’s lifelong preoccupations and B2B content writing.\n\nWho was George Carlin?\n\nAny Baby Boomer likely remembers George Carlin as the original counterculture comedian.\n\nHe was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where one of his classic characters was The Hippy Dippy Weatherman.\n\nHe created more than 20 comedy albums, did 14 HBO TV specials, and gave many stand-up shows, especially on college campuses.\n\nHe hosted the first-ever episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975.\n\nProbably Carlin’s best-known piece is his “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television” which he used to skewer the TV network censors of the day.\n\nCarlin continued to create new material and give shows until a week before he died in 2008 from heart failure. His website and Twitter feed are still going strong.\n\nCarlin’s fellow comics idolized him\n\nFor example, here’s some of what comedian Jerry Seinfeld wrote in The New York Times on June 24, 2008 a few days after Carlin died:\n\n“George downright invented modern American stand-up comedy… He worked over an idea like a diamond cutter with facets and angles and refractions of light… Everything he did just had this gleaming wonderful precision and originality.”\n\nHere’s what author/satirist Tony Hendra said about Carlin in The Huffington Post:\n\n“His mature pieces were essays, broadsides, jazz-like solos, based on omnivorous reading and a steely logic… He had a genius for distilling a lot of information and complex issues into a few succinct and hilarious sentences.”\n\nHis ongoing influence\n\nMany see Carlin, especially in his golden years, as a philosopher/poet who was unflinchingly honest in his critiques of late 20th-century American culture.\n\nCarlin’s brilliance was sometimes clouded by his profanity. But more often than not, I find myself agreeing with his sentiments.\n\nFor example: “Don’t just teach your children to read. Also teach your children to question what they read. Teach them to question everything.”\n\n(There’s some debate about his exact phrasing, but he did put forth this idea.)\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I discovered that Carlin also wrote four books that together sold close to a million copies.\n\nHis final book, although he started it first, is a quasi-autobiography called Last Words.\n\nYou can listen to a multi-part audio extract starting here.\n\nCarlin on language\n\nHere’s the point: Carlin cared passionately about words.\n\nAnd he cared about the way language is abused for political or commercial purposes.\n\nMost of all, he hated political correctness and euphemistic language.\n\n“Not all euphemisms are alike, but they have one thing in common; they obscure meaning rather than enhance it; they shade the truth,” he wrote in his hilarious book When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops? (page 6)\n\nBy the way, he noted that this title managed to offend three of the world’s major religions, plus vegetarians!\n\n“There is no part of American life that hasn’t been soiled by the new, softer, artificial language. It’s everywhere,” Carlin complained. (page 102)\n\nAnd he correctly analyzed, I think, why this trend has grown until we hear a constant stream of euphemisms in most B2B marketing today.\n\nThe following table shows the six rationales for using euphemisms that Carlin listed, along with a modern example from me.\n\nCarlin's reasonMy modern-day example To avoid unpleasant realitiesNot a problem, but an issue To make things sound more importantNot a product, but a solution To meet the demands of marketersYour client insists you insert a phrase like “seamless integration with legacy IT infrastructure“ PretentiousnessNot processing a return, but reverse fulfilment To boost employee\n\nself-esteemMost employees are managers,\n\neven if no one reports to them To be politically correctNot disabled, but differently-abled\n\nWhat writers can learn from Carlin\n\nThe job of any writer is to avoid using flabby, generic, inoffensive, cuddly terms.\n\nOur job—as Strunk & White surely agree—is to use crisp, clear and direct language to illuminate the truth, rather than obscure it.\n\nThis applies directly to B2B content and copywriting, and above all to white papers.\n\nNo one downloads a white paper hoping to find pretentious euphemisms and marketing-speak.\n\nSurvey after survey shows that’s what business readers hate the most: getting a sales pitch instead of solid, helpful information.\n\n[Tweet \"What copywriters can learn from George Carlin.\"]\n\nSo here’s what copywriters can learn from George Carlin:\n\nTell the truth\n\nUse clear, direct language, not marketing-speak\n\nDon’t throw in tired buzzwords just because everyone else does\n\nWrite the way normal business people talk at lunch\n\nAs much as possible, avoid political correctness\n\nNo one should ever criticize you for writing too clearly, too simply, or too directly.\n\nIf they do, sic George on them!\n\nOriginally published January 12, 2016\n\nLast updated: May 15, 2022\n\nWhat do you think? Does George Carlin have anything to say to white paper writers? Or is this just a crazy idea? Leave your comments below."
