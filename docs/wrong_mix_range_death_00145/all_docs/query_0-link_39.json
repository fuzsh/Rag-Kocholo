        "text": "Putting on shows seven days a week and not charging any drink minimums means that the Westside Comedy Theater on the Santa Monica Promenade always has a good crowd of patrons ready to chuckle and guffaw. Open since 2011, this lively venue draws all kinds of Hollywood types who live near the beach —\" think A listers like Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, Tig Notaro and Damon Wayans, for example —\" who turn up for what the club calls their \"Celebrity Drop Ins.\" Open every evening and serving lots of craft beers and other libations, this place is definitely a convivial choice for a fun night. Aspiring comics can take a variety of classes here, including improv workshops on Saturdays.\n\nRecommended for Comedy Clubs because: A favorite for locals who live far from Hollywood, this Santa Monica outpost of live comedy is a terrific place to take out of towners who want to see the beach and have some fun, too.\n\nJenny's expert tip: It's so close to the ocean that we advise checking out the sunset over the water before heading in for some laughs.\n\nRead more about Westside Comedy Theater →\n\nOpened in 1971, The Comedy Store has owned the corner of Sunset and Olive on the Strip ever since. Owner Mitzi Shore (the mother of comedian Pauly Shore) made it a force to be reckoned with, back in the day when very few women were involved in comedy. Everyone from David Letterman, Jay Leno, Robin Williams and Richard Pryor performed at the club back then; these days, children run the Store and book cutting-edge performers including Louis C.K., Whitney Cummings, Russell Peters and more. Mitzi's story is so interesting that Tom Hanks is making a movie about her life, with a special emphasis on her groundbreaking encouragement of female comedians in the club's Belly Room, designated for women performers only. She died in 2018, but Pauly and company still keep the laughs going, \"nightly 365 days a year.\"\n\nRecommended for Comedy Clubs because: A classic comedy spot on the Sunset Strip, this place is a must-visit stop for anyone who loves to laugh.\n\nJenny's expert tip: The club's two-drink minimum includes not only alcohol but soft drinks and coffee.\n\nRead more about The Comedy Store →\n\nIn 1975, impresario Budd Friedman brought his hugely successful New York City club with the signature brick wall to the West, opening a branch on Melrose Avenue. That's the same spot where you will find it today. And if those walls could talk, what stories they would tell. Famed comedy director Judd Apatow managed the door, actress Debra Winger was a waitress and CBS-TV head honcho Les Moonves made cocktails at the bar. On stage, everyone from Robin Williams and Andy Kaufman to Sarah Silverman, David Spade and Dane Cook hit the stage. Today, there are 21 outposts of The Improv, all over the U.S. But it is the L.A. Improv that is the place that draws the best of the best; you cannot help but laugh when you visit this famed place for funny.\n\nRecommended for Comedy Clubs because: One of the top comedy clubs in America, if the brick wall at The Improv could speak, oh, the stories it could tell!\n\nJenny's expert tip: Plan to arrive 1.5 hours before the show and have dinner; that way, you won't wait in line and receive priority seating for the show.\n\nRead more about The Improv →\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBurbank\n\nBurbank\n\nFlappers Comedy Club is right in the heart of the comedy beast, located in Burbank near NBC Studios and many of the biggest movie studios in the world.

Try the \"Dinner and a Show\" deal, which includes appetizer, main course, dessert and performance ticket (alcoholic drinks are extra) and make a night of it. Flappers even offers shows just for the younger set; the \"Two Milk Minimum\" on Saturday afternoon is designed just for kids 13 and younger. At night shows, the club suggests that everyone be 18 or older, as you never know what the performers might say.\n\nRecommended for Comedy Clubs because: There is comedy everywhere in Los Angeles, as Flappers in Burbank proves, drawing some of the top performers in the business\n\nLisa's expert tip: Making a reservation for one of the Flappers shows does not guarantee a seat, but a pre-purchased ticket does.\n\nRead more about Flappers Comedy Club →\n\nThe Second City Hollywood is the West Coast outpost of that famed Chicago comedy club and school.

Think Tim Allen, Chris Rock, Roseanne Barr, Ray Romano, Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, Damon Wayans and just about every other famous comedian you can think of. It's the place where anything can happen â\" Michael Richards (Kramer of \"Seinfeld\" fame) went into a racist rant on stage in 2006 that was captured on video here and imploded his career, for example. The club has been so successful that founder Jamie Masada now has six other branches, from Long Beach to Las Vegas and beyond.\n\nRecommended for Comedy Clubs because: Another of L.A.'s venerable comedy clubs, The Laugh Factory opened in 1979 and is still making people guffaw all these years later.\n\nJenny's expert tip: Get your late-night laughs at the Midnight Madness comedy show here every Saturday which starts at . . . wait for it . . . midnight.\n\nRead more about The Laugh Factory →\n\nHermosa Beach\n\nHermosa Beach\n\nWhat could be better than a trip to the beach AND a comedy club?

Other elements that make visiting it a great night out are the excellent layout of the seating, the good, reasonably priced food (which, when you order something, is included as part of your \"two-item\" minimum during a show) and the fact that Jay Leno uses this place as his personal practice ground. He performs all the time here (and even more since he retired from \"The Tonight Show\"), so if you're a fan, make sure to make a reservation for the nights he is on the calendar. Leno is still a big draw, but the club also specializes in showcasing up-and-coming comedy talent.\n\nRecommended for Comedy Clubs because: One of Southern California's most revered comedy clubs, and the place that Jay Leno considers his second home.\n\nJenny's expert tip: Park on the street but remember to feed the meters, as Hermosa Beach loves to give pricey parking tickets.\n\nRead more about Comedy & Magic Club →\n\nThe Groundlings Theatre has been serving up improvisational comedy since 1974, keeping audiences in stitches every night as well as launching the careers of top film and television comedians including Melissa McCarthy, Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig, Jennifer Coolidge, Will Forte and Kathy Griffin.
