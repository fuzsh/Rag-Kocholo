        "text": "So say “Hey Willie, tell Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio.”\n\nDon’t say it ain’t so, you know the time is now\n\nOh, put me in coach\n\nI’m ready to play today\n\n— John Fogerty from Center Field\n\n•\n\nRegarding my column last week, while politics is definitely my jam, it’s a topic I don’t enjoy writing about. I would prefer to spend our time discussing the finer points of fly fishing, wilderness canoeing or motorcycle maintenance.\n\nSo just a quick follow up to last week, then we will move on. I want to extend a warning to my reactionary colleagues— what’s good for the goose is good for the gander. Did you really want to gift Joe Biden with the same sweeping immunities that you were in such a hurry to bestow on Donald Trump? This rogue Supreme Court has given us a king. We shall see where this will lead. As Dr. Hunter S. Thompson used to say, “The fat is in the fire.”\n\n—\n\nSay, how about those Tigers?\n\nBaseball. The show. America’s past time. Maybe not so much anymore. George Carlin said It best, “Baseball is what we were, football is what we’ve become.”\n\nBut not for me. I will go to my grave declaring that baseball is the greatest game ever invented, a game for little boys played by big men.\n\nThere’s no other game like it. For one thing, it’s the only game without a clock. Each game could conceivably last forever.\n\nHell, each inning could conceivably last forever. Each at bat.\n\nYou hear a lot of loose talk about ways to speed up the game. Why? What else were you planning to do that’s more important than sitting in a beautiful ballpark on a sunny day, knocking back a cold beer, devouring a hot dog, eying the impossibly green grass and watching millionaires make circus plays in the outfield? What’s the rush?\n\nOne of the things that appeals to me about the game is it’s egalitarian nature. Football requires you to be big and fast, basketball, big and tall. In baseball you can be tall, short, lanky, chunky, it matters not. All that matters is your ability to play the game.\n\nAlong those lines, I believe baseball requires the broadest skill set of any sport. First and foremost, you need to hit a round ball traveling upwards of 90 mph with a round bat. This requires great bat speed and visual acuity.\n\nNext, you need to be able to throw the ball accurately, either from the pitcher’s mound, from third base to first or from the outfield home.\n\nYou need to sprint fast to clear the 90 feet between the bases.\n\nYou need to be able to catch the ball. Either crazy hot grounders in the infield or sky high pop flies that may require you to lay your body out.\n\nFirst and foremost, baseball is about failure. That’s right. The superstars of the game fail at the plate 7 out of 10 times. No other game would succeed with that level of failure. This is because hitting at the Major League level Is hard— very hard.\n\nWell people, I think I have one more column in me about America’s greatest pastime. Let this be our seventh inning stretch. I’m going to go pour a wee dram of Jameson. See you back here next week.\n\nAnd so it went.\n\nDon Negus is a Morning Sun columnist."
