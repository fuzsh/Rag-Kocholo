Patrick Carlin, a veteran writer who authored books, penned material for comedy shows and frequently collaborated with his brother, comedian George Carlin, has died at age 90.

His niece told Variety that Carlin died on Saturday in Hollywood, just over two weeks after he suffered a fall.

“He was my dad’s hero,” said Kelly Carlin, the daughter of George Carlin. “A lot of his thinking in the last 25 years of (George’s) career were fed by and connected to Pat.”

Patrick Carlin wrote for the “The George Carlin Show,” a sitcom that aired for two seasons during the mid-1990s, after working years earlier for the late-night talk program “Thicke of the Night,” which starred Alan Thicke.

He also hosted multiple radio shows for KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, released novels in 2007 and 2012, and hosted the podcast “Patrick’s Hollywood-Stock Connection,” according to Variety.

Kelly Carlin described her uncle as being “much less ambitious” than George Carlin, but said the brothers “had this simpatico way of seeing the world.”

“Pat was the street fighter and my dad was the jester,” she told Variety.

George and Patrick Carlin grew up in Manhattan, and Patrick spent much of his later life in Woodstock, New York. Patrick moved to Southern California last year following the death of his wife.

Patrick was reportedly placed on a ventilator after suffering the fall on April 1. His death comes more than a decade after George Carlin’s death in 2008. The longtime stand-up star was 71 when he died.
