Riches are the rewards that await those who walk with him on this path (Proverbs 8:19-21). What is justice and how does he intend us to carry it out? “The word (justice) comes from the Latin jus, meaning right or law. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the “just” person as one who typically “does what is morally right” and is disposed to “giving everyone his or her due,” offering the word “fair” as a synonym”[i]. Walking in justice and righteousness means walking in equality with every other member of humankind. It means walking in fairness and moral righteousness. Paths of patriarchy and racism are neither fair nor morally right when women and people of color receive less pay and less opportunities. These paths do not intersect with the wisdom of God, though travelers may call themselves Christ followers. Making a conscious choice to practice justice among humankind, takes courage. It takes courage to walk in fairness with those who are of a different gender and ethnicity. I challenge you today to take the path with me of justice and righteousness—a path that follows the Wisdom of God. This is a path of courage in caring for others as God modelled for us so precisely and beautifully. It takes courage to care!
