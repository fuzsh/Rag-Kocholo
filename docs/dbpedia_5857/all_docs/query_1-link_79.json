The school is focused on its mission “to create a safe and nurturing community of learners where students earn the Seal of Biliteracy (English and Spanish), learn to advocate for social justice and are prepared to enjoy and access what the world has to offer..” The teachers address the different learning styles in their daily instruction and help students make connections between the classroom and the real world through project-based learning experiences. The faculty, staff, and students view themselves as self-reflective, continuous learners and the parents see themselves as partners in their children’s education. Students are taught that to succeed; you need to believe in your ability to learn. Then you need to work hard to gain skills and knowledge. Therefore the school’s motto is “Believe, Achieve, Succeed.”\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://emhcharter.org\n\nExternal link for Eugenio Maria de Hostos Charter School\n\nIndustry\n\nEducation Administration Programs\n\nCompany size\n\n51-200 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nRochester, New York\n\nType\n\nEducational\n\nFounded\n\n1998\n\nSpecialties\n\nElementary School, High School, Charter School, Seal of Biliteracy, Children’s Education, Middle School, Dual Language, Bilingual, Spanish, and Public School"
