        "text": "In this theatrical monologue, Puerto Ricoâs illustrious Eugenio MarÃ­a de Hostos takes us on a journey through his life and the experiences which lead to his greatest and visionary ideals: Antillean unity, Womenâs participation in all aspects of society, and Education as the force for liberation. Through visually stunning staging, actor EfraÃ­n Rosa personifies a Hostos who ages through time until he reaches that iconic image that most people know. By using boxes, suitcases, fire, fabrics and paper boats, our hero embarks in search of his ideals and looks to a hopeful future.\n\nEugenio MarÃ­a de Hostos is remembered as a Great Citizen of the Americas, distinguished as a Puerto Rican intellectual, educator, philosopher, and writer. He devoted his life to the struggles for the independence of Puerto Rico, to the unity of the Antilles, to the empowerment of women and to providing education for all. Learn about Eugenio MarÃ­a de Hostos HERE.\n\nEnfocarte is a Puerto Rico-based non-profit dedicated to the production of cultural, artistic and educational events locally and internationally. Founded by the Puerto Rican journalist and producer Viviana Torres Mestey, the group is comprised of artists from a variety of artistic disciplines. Visit Enfocarte HERE."
