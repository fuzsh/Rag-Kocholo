        "text": "The United States occupations of Cuba and Puerto Rico following the War of 1898 instituted immediate reforms to the educational systems of the islands. The imposition of public school systems modeled on those of the United States and a concurrent wave of Protestant schools established by American missionaries are well-known features of the imperialist project. Yet American reforms were shaped by what was known in the nineteenth century as “the school question,” or the controversy over the appropriate relationship between schooling, religion, and the government that had pitted the Protestant majority against Catholics and resulted in a consensus that religious-affiliated education should be permitted but relegated to the private sphere. The implementation of this consensus as the basis of occupation policy in Cuba and Puerto Rico, majority Catholic societies, contributed to the significant growth of a system of private Catholic schools and sparked debate about the relationship between religion, education, and nationalism. In an imperial context, “the school question” led to political polarization in the face of persistent US hegemony.\n\n1 I use the term “War of 1898” here following Louis Pérez in his book with that title to denote the armed conflict in which the United States went to war against Spain and fought with but failed to recognize the Cuban Army of Liberation or Filipino forces who rose up against the US occupation. “Spanish-Cuban-American War” and “Philippine-American War” describe longer conflicts, of which the American intervention was but a part.

In the Downes v. Bidwell decision (1901), one of the so-called Insular Cases through which the US Supreme Court worked out the legal status of Puerto Rico in relation to the United States, one of the justices explicitly linked the question of race and culture by describing Puerto Ricansas “inhabited by alien races, differing from us in religion, customs, laws . . .” See Román, Ediberto, Citizenship and Its Exclusions (New York: New York University Press, 2010), 102Google Scholar.\n\n17 Translation (by author): “mentally dominated and enslaved by an intellectual regime that cares for nothing but at any cost to sicken and satiate the youthful understanding [of the colonized].

Private school students were largely White, especially at the most prestigious schools, and it was widely recognized that one reason wealthy families chose private education was to avoid the racial integration of the public school system. However, while Afro-Cubans had better access to public schools, they sometimes faced informal exclusion or had little access to schools due to the largely White neighborhoods where they were built. For a case study, see Lucero, Bonnie A., “The Great Equalizer?
