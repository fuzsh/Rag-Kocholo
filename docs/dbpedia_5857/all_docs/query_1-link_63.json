        "text": "The Eugenio Maria de Hostos Microsociety School appears to have a strong and consistent positive impact on students’ mathematics\n\nachievement as measured by New York tests. This can be clearly seen using percent of students rated proficient/advanced on\n\nstate-administered tests as the criteria by which to judge achievement. Hostos English-proficient students out-scored English-proficient students\n\nin every one of the five Comparison schools and students in the statewide comparison group every year from 2006 through 2014. This superior\n\nperformance remained consistent through a change in principal and through two major changes in New York’s testing system. See Graph 1.\n\nWhile the new Common Core tests have proven to be extremely difficult for Limited English Proficient (LEP) students, in both years since the test was implemented LEP students at Hostos outscored LEP students at every one of the five Comparison schools and students in the statewide comparison group. In five of the seven preceding years, LEP students at Hostos had outscored the statewide LEP comparison group and outscored LEP students in either four or five of the five comparison schools. See Graph 2.\n\nThe Eugenio Maria de Hostos Microsociety School did not appears to have a consistent impact on students’ ELA achievement as measured by New York tests. For both English Proficient students and Limited English Proficient students Hostos sometimes scored at or near the top of the group of comparison schools, sometimes at or near the bottom, and sometimes in the middle. Hostos students did better than students in the satewide comparison group in some years and worse in other years. See Graphs 3 and 4."
