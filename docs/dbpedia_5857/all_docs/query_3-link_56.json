        "text": "Eugenio María de Hostos Charter School has been serving the Rochester community for over 20 years as a free, public educational institution of excellence.\n\nThe school’s success is attributed to the belief that if a child cannot learn the way we teach, then we will learn to teach the way the child can learn. The school is focused on its mission to create a safe and nurturing community of learners where students earn the Seal of Biliteracy (English and Spanish), learn to advocate for social justice, and are prepared to enjoy and access what the world has to offer.\n\nThe teachers address the different learning styles in their daily instruction and help students make connections between the classroom and the real world through project-based learning experiences. EMHCS students participate in the annual EL Education event, Better World Day and community advocacy activities including Equity and Equality for Students and the Charter School Rally.\n\nPRIDE (Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Dedication and Excellence) is the focus of our Habits of Character which come to life at each campus. At EMHCS the faculty, staff, and students view themselves as self-reflective, continuous learners. Students are taught that in order to succeed, you need to believe in your ability to learn. Then you need to work hard to gain skills and knowledge. Therefore, the school’s motto is “Believe, Achieve, Succeed.”\n\nParents see themselves as partners in their children’s education. They are active members of the school community and participate in our PTO and advisory committee. EMHCS has two parent representatives on the Board of Trustees with full voting rights.\n\nUniforms\n\nEMHCS has a uniform policy that helps create a safe and orderly environment, instill pride in the school community, and eliminate the competition and distractions caused by varied dress styles.\n\nThe uniform consists of bottoms in solid black or navy blue, jumpers at knee length, skirts at knee length with shorts or solid navy blue or black colored tights underneath, pants or shorts at knee length, and sweatpants with the school logo.\n\nTops include a polo shirt with a school embroidered logo and sweaters (no school logo needed) in school colors: black, royal blue, navy blue, or charcoal grey.\n\nShoes: dress shoes, sneakers, tied sandals, or Crocs are allowed, but straps MUST BE worn on the back.\n\nNo hoodies, jeans, jogging suits, leggings, pants with stripes, flip flops, or high heels.\n\nCurriculum and Instruction\n\nEugenio María de Hostos (EMHCS) is an EL Education School . EL Education is a school reform model emphasizing high achievement through active learning, character growth, and teamwork. Students engage in their learning through expeditions, case studies, and projects. Students demonstrate ownership of their learning when they engage in student-led conferences annually.\n\nIn EL Education schools, each student is known well by at least one adult within the school. One structure for developing this relationship—and supporting students socially, emotionally, and academically—is the crew. Crew allows students to build positive connections with their peers and with their crew leader. At EMHCS, we are CREW!\n\nEugenio María de Hostos Charter School provides a bilingual educational program that teaches literacy and numeracy while learning two languages! The bilingual program promotes bilingualism and biliteracy, grade-level academic achievement, and cross-cultural competence in all students. Students maintain their native language while adding another language and cultivate pride in their own culture while developing an understanding and respect for others. The bilingual program offers a K-2 Dual Language Program pathway and the 3-12 Spanish Language Program pathway to prepare students to earn the NYS Seal of Biliteracy, a designation on their high school diploma.\n\nThe K-2 Dual Language program pathway is for all students. Students participating in this program become proficient in their native language while learning a second language. Students learn content (math, science, and social studies) in Spanish and English on alternating days. Students take literacy (reading and writing) in their dominant language and receive additional instruction in their second language.\n\nAt EMHCS, we value language! For students in grades 3-12, we offer a Spanish Language Program. Students are separated into two tracks depending on the student’s proficiency in the Spanish language. Students who have been in our school since kindergarten, performing at grade level in Spanish and native speakers, are placed in the Spanish Language Arts track. Students who are new to the school or lack the foundational skills in Spanish are placed in the World Language Spanish track.\n\nAt EMHCS, our mission is for students to earn the New York State Seal of Biliteracy (NYSSB) in English and Spanish. The NYSSB recognizes high school graduates who have attained a high level of proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in one or more languages in addition to English. Benefits to obtaining the Seal of Biliteracy include:\n\nPromotes the study of languages\n\nIdentify high school graduates with language and biliteracy skills for employers\n\nProvide universities with additional information about applicants seeking admission\n\nPrepare students with twenty-first-century skills\n\nRecognize the value of foreign and native language instruction in schools\n\nAffirm the value of diversity in a multilingual society.\n\nAt EMHCS, students can earn the NYS Seal of Civic Readiness (NYSSCR). The NYSSCR is a formal recognition that a student attained a high level of proficiency in their social studies coursework and demonstrated civic engagement."
