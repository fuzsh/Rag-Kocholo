        "text": "BARD COLLEGE\n\nFALL 2017 COURSE LIST ADDENDUM\n\nADDITIONAL COURSES:\n\nA class designed for students who have completed a Level 1 and II class in Painting, Sculpture or Drawing/Mixed Media with the expectation that it will provide Juniors with an opportunity to begin to craft a work ethic and ongoing studio practice. The class will be demanding, with students vigorously pursuing and developing their respective bodies of work and, be prepared to present it in ongoing class critiques. As well, to do research and participate in all class activities. There will be readings, films, class presentations and field trips. Seniors will be admitted with approval of instructor.Class Size: 12\n\nCross-listed: Economics and Finance; Human Rights2 credits Corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria have grown in recent decades both as important parts of a company's operations but also in investment criteria for profiteers and human rights advocates alike. In this class, students will learn about socially responsible investing, the interaction of institutions with corporate finance, and leveraging change through investing and stakeholder engagement. Such ESG criteria are often the basis for investment screens and rubric to assess company performance with respect to Human Rights, Environmental stewardship and Ethical corporate behavior. Student learn about all facets of ESG through case studies and reading on impact investing and design their own company engagement plan. This course does not have prerequisites, but pairs nicely with both Foundations of Finance and/or the work of the Socially Responsible Investment Committee.\n\nThis course introduces students with prior programming experience to the applications of object-oriented programming to physical and biological systems. The students will develop the necessary tools for modeling biological and physical objects that can move, interact, divide, and evolve, with a specific application of simulating biological cells. The students will learn how to pose a question about a natural system, develop a set of rules, and implement simulations to formulate predictions about the dynamics of that system. Prerequisite: CMSC 143 or permission by the instructor. Class size: 18\n\nThe main focus of this course is to introduce core ideas in statistics that are needed to make sense of what is found in media outlets, online surveys, and scientific journals. Most concepts are introduced in a case-study fashion; statistical software will be used to analyze data and facilitate classroom discussions. The goal of this course is to foster statistical reasoning, and to assist in making informed conclusions about topics involving data. Intended for non-math majors. Prerequisites: passing score on Part I of the Mathematics Diagnostic. Class size: 18\n\nSee above.\n\nSection B.\n\n1 credit This course exposes students to the broad range of ideas in modern mathematics through a series of weekly seminar talks given by visiting speakers and Bard faculty. Seminar talks may include subjects of current research interest as well as expository talks on topics not typically covered in Bard mathematics courses. The course is graded Pass/Fail and students are responsible for short follow-up assignments based on the talks. Prerequisite: At least one 200-level mathematics course. Class size: 20\n\nThis class acts as an introduction to jazz composition, covering first practical aspects of notation, instrumentation, Sibelius/Finale and score/parts preparation that will be necessary for the remainder of the two year sequence. The focus of the first semester is on the less structured realm of modal harmony. Students compose and have their piece performed in class on a weekly basis allowing them to begin to find their own voice and to master the practical techniques necessary for a successful performance of their work. Class size: 15\n\nThis workshop is designed to improve basic music reading skills. Drawing from a varied selection of material such as lead sheets, jazz fake book charts and simple to intermediate classical etudes, students learn to read melody and rhythm more confidently. This course works well for C (concert) instruments and may be adapted for other instruments as well.Class size: 14\n\nBeginning level course: The Jazz Vocal Workshop is a performance workshop designed to familiarize the beginning singer with the components of a successful jazz performance. How to begin a song (intros) and how to end a song (outros and turnarounds), how to pick a key, a song and a tempo. How to utilize simple (and not so simple) arrangements. Particular attention is paid to phrasing. The language of scat singing, with emphasis on practice in every class. The forms of the blues, rhythm changes and 32 bar song form, and practical applications taken from The Great American Songbook. There is one (or more) concert(s) scheduled during the semester and students are encouraged to seek out and perform in many local venues. There is a final exam in this class. Class size: no limit.\n\nCross-listed: History; Science, Technology & Society (STS core course)In this course, we will study the history of evolutionary theory from the eighteenth to the twentieth century. Topics will include the earth sciences, the classification of life, pre-Darwinian concepts of biological evolution, Darwin and Wallaces theory of evolution by natural selection, the problem of inheritance, and the Modern Synthesis. We will also consider philosophical debates surrounding evolution about questions such as adaptationism, genetic determinism, evolutionary ethics, and evolutionary progress. A recurring theme in the course will be the reception of Darwinian evolution, both among scientists and the broader public, up to and including twentieth-century debates over the teaching of evolution.Class size: 22\n\nOur topic for Fall 2017 is: foundations of set theory and formal semantics. We'll approach these topics both historically and systematically, with Georg Cantor and Alfred Tarksi on the historical side. Prerequisite: Symbolic Logic (PHIL 237), Proofs and Fundamentals (MATH 261), or the equivalent. Class size: 15\n\nThis course will introduce students to the rich tradition of philosophical ideas in the Caribbean. The course will aim at doing philosophy and not only knowing philosophers. This distinction is important as areas with a legacy of epistemological colonialism, like the Caribbean, have many works that contain a substratum of philosophical ideas but have not necessarily been welcomed as canonical works of philosophy. Thus we will seek to engage in philosophy as a questioning activity that attempts to answer epistemic, aesthetic, normative and metaphysical questions. Some threads of analysis unique to this geography that this course will cover, include: the idea that philosophy is a contextual project rooted in a specific place rather than an abstract, ideal theory; the effect of colonialism on culture and education; the exploration of creolization; and the critical analysis of modernity as a European project. Course texts include works by Edouard Glissant, Wilson Harris, Eugenio Maria Hostos, Julia de Burgos and Franz Fanon. Class size: 15\n\nCross-listed: Classical StudiesIn ancient Greece, going to the theater was understood as a political activity and part of democratic, civic education. This seminar critically examines how the classical tragedy of ancient Greece provides ways of thinking through fundamental political questions, and considers tragic thought within political theory. We will examine ancient and modern works by (among others) Sophocles, Thucydides, Aristotle, Nietzsche, and Arendt. Through these we will consider how these plays and text pose fundamental political dilemmas: how can we uphold justice in uncontrollable, unpredictable circumstances? Is obeying the law more important than doing the right thing? Can a democratic order be founded without an initial act of violence? If popular entertainment truly shapes our political culture, should we therefore approve government censorship? Through these texts we will how classical tragedy gives us a form of political, ethical, and historical thinking that has been taken up by many political theorists. Our task in this class is to see how thinking tragically has been used to illuminate, and navigate, ethical and political conflicts; and to ask how such thinking might remain important today. Class size: 20\n\nCross-listed: Global & International Studies; Russian & Eurasian Studies In the 1980-90s, Soviet and Russian society underwent catastrophic turmoil, simultaneously experiencing a democratic revolution, the dissolution of an empire, and societal collapse. The end of the communist project in Russia did not lead to a standard normalizing transition to a liberal democracy, but produced instead a dramatic chain of events. An attempt at neoliberal economic reform coincided with a deep economic crisis, a reclamation of power by former communist officials, and a tendency toward a social anomie. The result, politically, was a gradual construction of an authoritarian regime and the formation of a political culture that is obsessed with a geo-political competition with West and sharply polarized between the conservative and liberal sensibilities. Why did the Soviet Union collapse? Why did the democratic revolution fail? Why has the most left-wing country in the world become one of the most right-wing countries in the world? Why have nationalism and imperialism reemerged in a time of globalization? Why does contemporary authoritarianism use elections, courts, and sociological surveys as its indispensable instruments of governance? The course will explore these and other questions in relying on the readings in political science, history, sociology, and cultural studies, as well as film and literary fiction. Class size: 22\n\nCross-listed: Latin American and Iberian Studies In this course, we will study the different mechanisms that representative Latin American fiction writers and poets of the 20th century use to create a particular way of perceiving reality. By altering perceptions of space and time, rethinking the limits of language, and exploring the inner world of the subject and the unconscious, authors such as Vicente Huidobro (Chile), César Vallejo, César Moro (Peru), Adolfo Bioy Casares, Jorge Luis Borges, Alejandra Pizarnik (Argentina), Carlos Fuentes (México), Gabriel García Márquez (Colombia), and Cristina Peri Rossi (Uruguay) experiment with new forms of representation that garner universal appeal. We will consider the influence of important Latin American literary avant-garde movements, such as creacionismo, ultraism, and surrealism, and will cover topics such as magical realism, lo fantástico, and lo absurdo to understand these new and original ways of redefining the real. In order to offer greater exposure to important Latin American literary works, the course will also provide a selection of poems, essays and short stories from authors such as Carlos Oquendo de Amat, Blanca Varela, Oliverio Girondo, Julio Cortázar, and Octavio Paz. Conducted in Spanish.

How do anthropogenic actions such as antibiotic pollution affect key microbial populations found in soil, waterways, and hosts? This research intensive course uses metagenomics, a set of methodologies combining next-generation sequencing and computational biology, to study microbial communities as a whole. More specifically, students will learn how to use advanced bioinformatics tools to analyze and vizualize large data sets generated by DNA sequencing. Students will also use multivariate statistics to characterize changes in microbial diverstiy resulting from differences in selective environments. As a final project, students will be responsible to design and conduct their own metagenomics study using a system of their own choice. For example, students will be able to study the effect of antibiotic pollution on the microbiome of an animal hosts or to study the effect of salt concentration on food fermentation. The course format aim to create an immersive research experience where students will study the applications of bioinformatic tools to important public health issues, while taking an active role in an ongoing research program.Prerequisite: Upper College standing in biology, or permission of instructor.
