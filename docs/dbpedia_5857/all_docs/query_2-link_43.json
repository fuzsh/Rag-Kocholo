A| B| C| D| E| F| G| H| I| J| K| L| M| N| O| P| Q| R| S| T| U| V| W| X| Y| Z\n\nL\n\nLachelier, J.: (1831-1918) A French philosopher who, though he wrote little, exerted a considerable direct personal influence on his students at the Ecole Normale Superieure; he was the teacher of both E. Boutroux and H. Bergson. His philosophical position was a Kantian idealism modified by the French \"spiritualism\" of Maine de Biran and Ravaisson.\n\nMain works:\n\nLe fondemcnt de l'induction, 187; Psychologie et metaphysique, 1885; Etudes sur le syllogisme, 1907; Note sur le pari de Pascal. -- L.W.\n\nLamaism: (from Tibetan b La-ma, honorable title of a monk) The religious beliefs and institutions of Tibet, derived from Mahayana Buddhism (q.v.) which was first introduced in the 7th century by the chieftain Sron-tsan-gampo, superimposed on the native Shamaistic Bon religion, resuscitated and mixed with Tantric (q.v.) elements by the mythic Hindu Padmasambhava, and reformed by the Bengalese Atisa in the 11th and Tsong-kha-pa at the turn of the 14th century. The strong admixture of elements of the exorcismal, highly magically charged and priest-ridden original Bon, has given Buddhism a turn away from its philosophic orientation and produced in Lamaism a form that places great emphasis on mantras (q.v.) -- the most famous one being om mani padme hum) -- elaborate ritual, and the worship of subsidiary tutelary deities, high dignitaries, and living incarnations of the Buddha. This worship is institutionalized, with a semblance of the papacy, in the double incarnation of the Bodhisattva (q.v.) in the Dalai-Lama who resides with political powers at the capital Lhasa, and the more spiritual head Tashi-Lama who rules at Tashi-Ihum-po. Contacts with Indian and Chinese traditions have been maintained for centuries and the two canons of Lamaism, the Kan-jur of 108 books and the Tan-jur of 225 books represent many translations as well as original works, some of great philosophical value. -- K.F.L. Lambert, J. H.: (1728-1777) Was one of Kant's correspondents. He was of the Leibniz-Wolffisn school which attempted an eclectic reconciliation between rationalism and empiricism and thus laid a foundation for the later Kantian critical philosophy. As such, he is viewed as an important forerunner of Kant. -- L.E.D. L\n\nLmbert is known also for important contributions to mathematics, and astronomy; also for his work in logic, in particular his (unsuccessful, but historically significant) attempts at construction of a mathematical or symbolic logic. Cf. C. I. Lewis, Survey of Symbolic Logic. -- A.C.\n\nLamennais, R.: (1782-1854) Leader of a Platonic-Christian movement in the Catholic clergy of France. He advanced the idea of \"inspired mankind.\" He attacked the eighteenth century for its principles and its method. In finding dissolution and destruction as its aftermath, he advocated a return to the Catholic Church as the solution.\n\nMain works:\n\nParoles d'un croyant, 1834;\n\nsquisse d'une philosophic, 1841-46. -- L.E.D.\n\nLamettrie, Julien Offroy de: (1709-1751) A French materialist and author of L'homme machine, in which he expresses his belief that the soul is a product of bodily growth; he maintains that the brain has its \"thought muscles\" just as the leg has its \"walk muscles.\"\n\nMain works:\n\nHistoire naturelle de l'ame, 1745; L'homme-machine, 1747; L'homme-plante, 1748; Discours sur le bonheur, 1748; Le systeme d' Epicure, 1750. -- R.B.W.\n\nLange, Friedrich Albert: (1828-1875) Celebrated for his History of Materialism, based upon a qualified Kantian point of view, he demonstrated the philosophical limitations of metaphysical materialism, and his appreciation of the value of materialism as a stimulus to critical thinking. He worked for a greater understanding of Kant's work and anticipated fictionalism. -- H.H. Language, Functions of: Some utterances (a) are produced by a speaker, (b) induce effects in an interpreter, (c) are related to a certain subject-matter (which may, but in general will not, include either the speaker or interpreter). According as one or other of the relations in which the utterance stands to the several factors of such speech-situations is selected for attention, the (token) utterance may be said to have expressive, evocative and referential functions. The utterance expresses thoughts, desires, attitudes of the speaker; evokes reactions (thoughts, evaluations, tendencies to action) in the hearer; designates or refers to its reference.\n\nWhile all three functions are normally distinguishable in any given utterance, type-sentences (and, derivatively, words) may be classified according as one or the other of the functions normally predominates in the occurrence of the corresponding tokens. (Thus exclamations are predominantly expressive, commands evocative, scientific generalizations referential.) Such distinctions may, in turn, be made the basis for distinguishing different types of linguistic systems.\n\nWhile most writers on language agree us to the value of making some such distinctions, there is little agreement as to the number and kinds of functions which may usefully be recognised. There is even less agreement about nomenclature. The account given follows that of Kretschmer (Sprache, 61 ff. in Gercke and Norden, Einleitung in die Altertumszvissenschaft, I) and Bühlcr (Sprachtheorie, passim). Ogden and Richards distinguish five functions (Meaning of Meaning, 357 fF.). The broad distinction between \"referential\" and \"emotive\" uses of language, due to the same authors, has been widely accepted. -- M.B.\n\nLanguage, Philosophy of: Any philosophical investigation arising from study of concrete, actualized, languages, whether \"living\" or \"dead\". By \"language\" is here to be understood a system of signs (whether words or ideograms) used in regular modes of combination, in accordance with conventionally established rules, for the purpose of communication.\n\nPhilosophers have in the past been concerned with two questions covered by our definition, though attempts to organize the subject as an autonomous department of philosophy are of recent date.\n\nEnquiries into the origin of language (e.g. in Plato's Kratylos) once a favorite subject for speculation, are now out of fashion, both with philosophers and linguists.\n\nEnquiries as to the nature of language (as in Descartes, Leibniz, and many others) are, however, still central to all philosophical interest in language. Such questions as \"What are the most general characters of symbolism?\", \"How is 'Language' to be defined?\", \"What is the essence of language?\", \"How is communication possible?\", \"What would be the nature of a perfect language?\", are indicative of the varying modulations which this theme receives in the works of contemporaries.\n\nCurrent studies in the philosophy of language can be classified under five hends:\n\nQuestions of method, relation to other disciplines, etc. Much discussion turns here upon the proposal to establish a science and art of symbolism, variously styled semiotic, semantics or logical syntax,\n\nThe analysis of meaning. Problems arising here involve attention to those under the next heading.\n\nThe formulation of general descriptive schemata. Topics of importance here include the identification and analysis of different ways in which language is used, and the definition of men crucial notions as \"symbol'', \"grammar\", \"form\", \"convention\", \"metaphor\", etc.\n\nThe study of fully formalized language systems or \"calculi\". An increasingly important and highly technical division which seeks to extend and adapt to all languages the methods first developed in \"metamathematics\" for the study of mathematical symbolism.\n\nApplications to problems in general philosophy. Notably the attempt made to show that necessary propositions are really verbal; or again, the study of the nature of the religious symbol. Advance here awaits more generally acceptable doctrine in the other divisions.\n\nReferences:\n\nK. Bühler,\n\nSprachtheorie.\n\nR. Car-nap,\n\nLogical Syntax of Language.\n\nE.

Lao Tzu: Whether the founder of Taoism (tao chia) was the same as Li Erh and Li An, whether he lived before or after Confucius, and whether the Tao Te Ching (Eng. trans.: The Canon of Reason and Virtue by P. Carus, The Way and Its Power by A. Waley, etc.) contains his teachings are controversial. According to the Shih Chi (Historical Records), he was a native of Chu (in present Honan), land of romanticism in the south, and a custodian of documents whom Confucius went to consult on rituals. Thus he might have been a priest-teacher who, by advocating the doctrine of \"inaction\", attempted to preserve the declining culture of his people, the suppressed people of Yin, while Confucius worked hard to promote the culture of the ruling people of Chou. -- W.T.C. Lassalle, Ferdinand: (1825-1864) Was influenced in his thought by Fichte and Hegel but soon assumed a distinctly materialist position. His main interest and activity lay in the field of political and economic philosophy; he advocated, and worked for, the formation of trade unions in Germany and adhered to socialism.\n\nMain works: Die Philosophie Herakleitos d. Dunklen, 1858; System d. Eruorbenen Rechte, 1861; and political speeches and pamphlets in Collected Works (Leipzig, 1899-1901). -- R.B.W.\n\nLatency: (Lat. latere, to be hidden) (a) In metaphysics, the term latency is equivalent to potency or potentiality. See Potentiality.\n\n(b) In epistemology and psychology, the term is applied to knowledge, e.g. memory, which lies dormant in the mind but is capable of becoming actual and explicit (see W. Hamilton, Lectures on Metaphysics, xviii, cited by J. M. Baldwin, Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, Vol. I, p. 628). Latency in this restricted sense, designates phenomena now embraced by the term subconscious. See Subconscious. -- L.W.\n\nLatin-American Philosophy: Philosophy in Latin America may be divided into three periods.\n\n(1) The scholastic period begins with the Recognitio summularum of Alonso de la Veracruz (1554) and continues to the dawn of the nineteenth century. According to Ueberweg, the influence of Duns Scotus during this period was greater than that of Thomas Aquinas.\n\n(2) The predominantly naturalistic and positivistic period coincides roughly with the nineteenth century. The wars of independence were accompanied by revolt from scholasticism. In the early part of the century, liberal eclectics like Cousin and P. Janet were popular in South America, but French eighteenth century materialism exerted an increasing influence. Later, the thought of Auguste Comte and of Herbert Spencer came to be dominant especially in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Even an idealistically inclined social and educational philosopher like Eugenio Maria de Hostos (1839-1903), although rejecting naturalistic ethics, maintains a positivistic attitude toward metaphysics.\n\n(3) The predominantly idealistic period of the twentieth century was initiated by the work of the Argentine Alejandro Korn (1860-1936), who introduced modern German philosophy to his fellow-countrymen. Francisco Romero, also an Argentine, has brought about the translation of many European philosophical classics into Spanish. Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, and the more recent neo-Kantians and phenomcnologists have exerted wide influence in Latin America. North American personalism has also attracted attention. In Mexico, Jose Vasconcelos and Pedro Gringoire reflect in their own syntheses the main streams of idealistic metaphysics, ethics, esthetics. Puerto Rico, with its recent publication of the writings of Hostes, is also a center of philosophic activity. There are signs of growing philosophical independence throughout Latin America. -- J.F., E.S.B.\n\nLatitudinarianism: (1) A party in the Church of England (middle of the 17th century) aiming to reconcile contending parties by seeking a broad basis in common doctrines. (2) A term applied to a liberal opinion which allows diversity in unity. (3) A term used derisively as meaning indifference to religious doctrines. -- V.F. Law: (in Kant) \"Every formula which expresses the necessity of an action is called a law\" (Kant). -- P. A.S. Law, Chinese School of: See Fa chia and Chinese philosophy. Law of Population: In economics, the tendency of population to encroach upon the means of subsistence. First announced by Malthus (1766-1834), the Law asserts that the increase of unchecked population is in geometric ratio while the increase of the means of subsistence is in arithmetic ratio, so that population must always press upon the limits of the means of subsistence. -- J.K.F. Laws of thought: See Logic, traditional. Leading principle: The general statement of the validity of some particular form of valid inference (see Logic, formal) may be called its leading principle.\n\nOr the name may be applied to a proposition or sentence of logic corresponding to a certain form of valid inference. E.g., the law of exportation (q. v.) may be called the leading principle of the form of valid inference known as exportation. -- A.C.\n\nLegal Philosophy: Deals with the philosophic principles of law and justice. The origin is to be found in ancient philosophy. The Greek Sophists criticized existing laws and customs by questioning their validity: All human rules are artificial, created by enactment or convention, as opposed to natural law, based on nature. The theory of a law of nature was further developed by Aristotle and the Stoics. According to the Stoics the natural law is based upon the eternal law of the universe; this itself is an outgrowth of universal reason, as man's mind is an offshoot of the latter. The idea of a law of nature as being innate in man was particularly stressed and popularized by Cicero who identified it with \"right reason\" and already contrasted it with written law that might be unjust or even tyrannical. Through Saint Augustine these ideas were transmitted to medieval philosophy and by Thomas Aquinas built into his philosophical system. Thomas considers the eternal law the reason existing in the divine mind and controlling the universe. Natural law, innate in man participates in that eternal law. A new impetus was given to Legal Philosophy by the Renaissance. Natural Jurisprudence, properly so-called, originated in the XVII. century. Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes, Benedictus Spinoza, John Locke, Samuel Pufendorf were the most important representatives of that line of thought. Grotius, continuing the Scholastic tradition, particularly stressed the absoluteness of natural hw (it would exist even if God did not exist) and, following Jean Bodin, the sovereignty of the people. The idea of the social contract traced all political bodies back to a voluntary compact by which every individual gave up his right to self-government, or rather transferred it to the government, abandoning a state of nature which according to Hobbes must have been a state of perpetual war. The theory of the social compact more and more accepts the character of a \"fiction\" or of a regulative idea (Kant). In this sense the theory means that we ought to judge acts of government by their correspondence to the general will (Rousseau) and to the interests of the individuals who by transferring their rights to the commonwealth intended to establish their real liberty. Natural law by putting the emphasis on natural rights, takes on a revolutionary character. It played a part in shaping the bills of rights, the constitutions of the American colonies and of the Union, as well as of the French declaration of the rights of men and of citizens. Natural jurisprudence in the teachings of Christian Wolff and Thomasius undergoes a kind of petrification in the vain attempt to outline an elaborate system of natural law not only in the field of international or public law, but also in the detailed regulations of the law of property, of contract, etc. This sort of dogmatic approach towards the problems of law evoked the opposition of the Historic School (Gustav Hugo and Savigny) which stressed the natural growth of laws ind customs, originating from the mysterious \"spirit of the people\". On the other hand Immanuel Kant tried to overcome the old natural law by the idea of a \"law of reason\", meaning an a priori element in all existing or positive law. In his definition of law (\"the ensemble of conditions according to which everyone's will may coexist with the will of every other in accordance with a general rule of liberty\"), however, as in his legal philosophy in general, he still shares the attitude of the natural law doctrine, confusing positive law with the idea of just law. This is also true of Hegel whose panlogism seemed to lead in this very direction. Under the influence of epistemological positivism (Comte, Mill) in the later half of the nineteenth century, legal philosophy, especially in Germany, confined itself to a \"general theory of law\". Similarily John Austin in England considered philosophy of law concerned only with positive law, \"as it necessarily is\", not as it ought to be. Its main task was to analyze certain notions which pervade the science of law (Analytical Jurisprudence). In recent times the same tendency to reduce legal philosophy to logical or at least methodological tasks was further developed in attempting a pure science of law (Kelsen, Roguin). Owing to the influence of Darwinism and natural science in general the evolutionist and biological viewpoint was accepted in legal philosophy: comparative jurisprudence, sociology of law, the Freirecht movement in Germany, the study of the living law, \"Realism\" in American legal philosophy, all represent a tendency against rationalism. On the other hand there is a revival of older tendencies: Hegelianism, natural law -- especially in Catholic philosophy -- and Kantianism (beginning with Rudolf Stammler). From here other trends arose: the critical attitude leads to relativism (f.i. Gustav Radbruch); the antimetaphysical tendency towards positivism -- though different from epistemological positivism -- and to a pure theory of law. Different schools of recent philosophy have found their applications or repercussions in legal philosophy: Phenomenology, for example, tried to intuit the essences of legal institutions, thus coming back to a formalist position, not too far from the real meaning of analytical jurisprudence. Neo-positivism, though so far not yet explicitly applied to legal philosophy, seems to lead in the same direction. -- W.E. Legalism, ethical: The insistence on a strict literal or overt observance of certain rules of conduct, or the belief that there are rules which must be so obeyed. Opposed on the one hand by the view which emphasizes the spirit over the letter of the law, and on the other by the view which emphasizes a consideration of the value of the consequences of actions and rules of action. Deontological ethics is often said to be legalistic. Cf. F. Cohen, Legal Ideals and Ethical Systems. -- W.K.F. Lei: (a) Generic name. \"All similar substances necessarily bear the same name.\" (Neo-Mohism)\n\n(b) Generic relationship or partial relationship. See Mo che. -- W.T.C.\n\nLeibniz, Gottfried Withelm: (1646-1716) Born in Leipzig, where his father was a professor in the university, he was educated at Leipzig, Jena, and Altdorf University, where he obtained his doctorate. Jurist, mathematician, diplomat, historian, theologian of no mean proportions, he was Germany's greatest 17th century philosopher and one of the most universal minds of all times. In Paris, then the centre of intellectual civilization (Moliere was still alive, Racine at the height of his glory), where he had been sent on an official mission of state, he met Arnauld, a disciple of Descartes who acquainted him with his master's ideas, and Huygens who taught him as to the higher forms of mathematics and their application to physical phenomena. He visited London, where he met Newton, Boyle, and others. At the Hague he came face to face with the other great philosopher of the time, Spinoza. One of Leibniz's cherished ideas was the creation of a society of scholars for the investigation of all branches of scientific truth to combine them into one great system of truth. His philosophy, the work \"of odd moments\", bears, in content and form, the impress of its haphazard origin and its author's cosmopolitan mode of large number of letters, essays, memoranda, etc., published in various scientific journals. Universality and individuality characterize him both as a man and philosopher.\n\nLeibniz's philosophy was the dawning consciousness of the modern world (Dewey). So gradual and continuous, like the development of a monad, so all-inclusive was the growth of his mind, that his philosophy, as he himself says, \"connects Plato with Democritus, Aristotle with Descartes, the Scholastics with the moderns, theology and morals with reason.\" The reform (if all science was to be effected by the use of two instruments, a universal scientific language and a calculus of reasoning. He advocated a universal language of ideographic symbols in which complex concepts would be expressed by combinations of symbols representing simple concepts or by new symbols defined as equivalent to such a complex. He believed that analysis would enable us to limit the number of undefined concepts to a few simple primitives in terms of which all other concepts could be defined. This is the essential notion back of modern logistic treatments.\n\nIn contributing some elements of a \"universal calculus\" he may be said to have been the first serious student of symbolic logic. He devised a symbolism for such concepts and relations as \"and\", \"or\", implication between concepts, class inclusion, class and conceptual equivalence, etc. One of his sets of symbolic representations for the four standard propositions of traditional logic coincides with the usage of modern logic He anticipated in the principles of his calculus many of the important rules of modern symbolic systems. His treatment, since it was primarily intensional, neglected important extensional features of recent developments, but, on the other hand, called attention to certain intensional distinctions now commonly neglected.\n\nLeibniz is best known in the history of philosophy as the author of the Monadology and the theory of the Pre-established Harmony both of which see.\n\nMain works:\n\nDe arte combinatoria, 1666 ; Theoria motus concreti et abstracti, 1671 ; Discours de la metaphysique, 1686; Systeme nouveau de la nature, 1695; Nouveaux Essais sur l'entendement humain, 1701 (publ. 1765, criticism of Locke's Essay); Theodicee, 1710; Monadologie, 1714 (letter to Prince Eugene of Savoy).\n\nNo complete edition of L. exists, but the Prussian Academy of Sciences began one and issued 4 vols. to date. Cf. Gerhardt's edition of L's philosophical works (7 vols., 1875-90) and mathematical works (1849-63), Foucher de Careil's edition, 7 vols. (1859-75), O. Klopp's edition of L.'s historico-political works, 10 vols. (1864-77), L. Couturat's Opuscules et fragments inedits de L., 1903. -- K.F.L. Lemma: (Gr. lemma) In Aristotle's logic a premiss of a syllogism. -- G.R.M.\n\nIn mathematics, a theorem proved for the sake of its use in proving another theorem. The name is applied especially in cases where the lemma ceases to be of interest in itself after proof of the theorem for the sake of which it was introduced. -- A.C.\n\nLenin, V. I.: (Ulianov, Vladimir Ilyich) Lenin is generally regarded as the chief exponent of dialectical materialism (q.v.) after Marx and Engels. He was born April 22, 1870, in Simbirsk, Russia, and received the professional training of a lawyer. A Marxist from his student days onward, he lived many years outside of Russia as a political refugee, and read widely in the social sciences and philosophy. In the latter field his \"Philosophical Note Books\" (as yet untranslated into English) containing detailed critical comments on the works of many leading philosophers, ancient and modern, and in particular on Hegel, indicate his close study of texts. In 1909, Lenin published his best known philosophic work \"Materialism and Empirio-Cnticism\" which was directed against \"a number of writers, would-be Marxists\" including Bazarov, Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Berman, Helfond, Yushkevich, Suvorov and Valentinov, and especially against a symposium of this group published under the title, \"Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism\" which in general adopted the \"positivistic\" position of Mach and Avenanus.\n\nIn his economic and political writings, Lenin extended and developed the doctrines of Marx and Engels especially in their application to a phase of capitalism which emerged fully only after their death -- imperialism. In the same fashion Lenin built upon and further extended the Marxist doctrine of the state in his \"State and Revolution\", written just before the revolution of 1917. In this work Lenin develops a concept like the dictatorship of the proletariat which Marx treated only briefly and generally, elaborates a distinction like that between socialism and communism, only implicit in Marx's work, and asserts a thesis like the possibility of socialism in one country, towards which Marx was negative in the light of conditions as he knew them. After the Bolsheviks came to power, Lenin headed the government until his death on January 21, 1924. In Russian, Lenin's \"Collected Works\" comprise thirty volumes, with about thirty additional volumes of miscellaneous writings (\"Leninskie Sborniki\"). The principal English translations are the \"Collected Works\", to comprise thirty volumes (of which five in eight books have been published to date), the \"Selected Works\" comprising twelve volumes (for philosophical materials, see especially Volume XI, \"Theoretical Principles of Marxism\"), and the Little Lenin Library, made up mostly of shorter works, comprising 27 volumes to date. -- J.M.S.\n\nLessing, Gotthold Ephraim: (1729-1781) German dramatist and critic. He is best known in the philosophic field for his treatise on the limitations of poetry and the plastic arts in the famous \"Laokoon.\" In the drama, \"Nathan the Wise,\" he has added to the world's literature a profound plea for religious toleration. -- L.E.D. Leucippus: (a. 450 B.C.) A contemporary of Empedocles and Anaxagoras and founder of the School of Abdera, developed the fruitful principle that all qualitative differences in nature may be reduced to quantitative ones. Thus Leucippus breaks up the homogeneous \"Being\" of Parmenides into an infinity of equally homogeneous parts or atoms and he distributes these, in an infinite variety of forms, through infinite space. These small particles of \"Being\" are separated from one another by that which is not-Being, i.e. by empty space. \"Becoming\", or the coming into being of things, is essentially the result of the motion of these atoms in space and their accidental coming together. -- M.F. Level: A grade or type of existence or being which entails a special type of relatedness or of organization, with distinctive laws. The term has been used primarily in connection with theories of emergent evolution where certain so-called higher levels, e.g. life, or mind, are supposed to have emerged from the lower levels, e.g. matter, and are considered to exhibit features of novelty not predictable from the lower levels. -- A.C.B. Levy-Bruhl, Lucien: (1857-1939) Professor of Philosophy at the Sorbonne 1899-1939, represents a sociological and anthropological approach to philosophy; his chief contribution is an anthropological study of primitive religion which emphasizes the \"prelogical\" or mystical character of the thinking of primitive peoples. La Mentalite primitive (1922), Eng. trans., 1923; L'Ame Primitive (1927). His other writings include: History of Modern Philosophy in France (Eng. trans., 1899); The Philosophy of Auguste Comte (1900, Eng. trans., 1903). -- L.W. Lewis, Clarence Irving: (1883-) Professor of Philosophy at Harvard. In Logic, Lewis has originated and defended strict implication (q.v.) in contrast to material implication, urging that formal inference should be based on a relation which can be known to hold without knowing what is true or false of this particular universe. See his Survey of Symbolic Logic, and his and C. H. Langford's Symbolic Logic, esp. Ch. VIII. Lewis has argued also for \"queer logics\", that is, abstract systems somewhat different from the abstract system usually interpreted as logic. Lewis raises the question how \"queer\" a system can be and still be interpretable properly as a system of logic.\n\nIn Epistemology (See his Mind and the World-Order) Lewis has presented a \"conceptualistic pragmatism\" based on these theses:\n\n\"A priori truth is definitive in nature and rises exclusively from the analysis of concepts.\"\n\n\"The choice of conceptual systems for . . . application [to particular given experiences] is . . . pragmatic.\"\n\n\"That experience in general is such as to be capable of conceptual interpretation . . . could not conceivably be otherwise.\" -- C.A.B.\n\nLi: Reason; Law; the Rational Principle. This is the basic concept of modern Chinese philosophy. To the Neo-Confucians, especially Ch'eng I-ch'uan (1033-1107), Ch'eng Ming-tao (1032-1086) and Chu Hsi (1130-1200), Reason is the rational principle of existence whereas the vital force (ch'i) is the material principle. All things have the same Reason in them, making them one reality. By virtue of their Reason, Heaven and Earth and all things are not isolated. The Reason of a thing is one with the Reason of all things. A thing can function easily if it follows its own Reason. Everything can be understood by its Reason. This Reason of a thing is the same as its nature (hsingj. Subjectively it is the nature, objectively it is Reason. Lu Hsiang-shan (1139-1193) said that there is only one mind and there is only one Reason, which are identical. It fills the universe, manifesting itself everywhere. To Wang Yang-ming (1473-1529), the mind itself is the embodiment of Reason. To say that there is nothing existing independent of Reason is to say that there is nothing apart from the mind. See Li hsueh, Chinese philosophy, and ch'i. -- W.T.C. Li: Propriety; code of proper conduct; rules of social contact; good manners; etiquett; mores; rituals; rites; ceremonials. In Confucius, it aims at true manhood (jen) through self-mastery, and central harmony (ho). \"Propriety regulates and refines human feelings, giving them due allowance, so as to keep the people within bounds.\" It is \"to determine human relationships, to settle suspicions and doubts, to distinguish similarity and difference, and to ascertain right and wrong.\" \"The rules of propriety are rooted in Heaven, have their correspondences in Earth, and are applicable to spiritual beings.\" \"Music unites, while rituals differentiate. . . . Music comes from the inside, while rituals come from the outside. Because music comes from the inside, it is characterized by quiet and calm. And because rituals come from the outside, they are characterized by formalism. . . . Truly great music shares the principles of harmony with the universe, and truly great ritualism shares the principles of distinction with the universe. Through the principles of harmony, order is restored in the physical world, and through the principles of distinction, we are enabled to offer sacrifices to Heaven and Earth. . . . Music expresses the harmony of the universe, while rituals express the order of the universe. Through harmony all things are influenced, and through order all things have a proper place.

The book Lieh Tzu (partial Eng. tr. by L. Giles: Taoist Teachings from the Book of Lieh Tzu) which bears his name is a work of the third century A.D. -- W.T.C. Li hsueh: The Rational Philosophy or the Reason School of the Sung dynasty (960-1279) which insisted on Reason or Law (li) as the basis of reality, including such philosophers as Chou Lien-hsi (1017-1073), Shao K'ang-chieh (1011-1077), Chang Heng-ch'u (1020-1077), Ch'eng I-ch'uan (1033-1107), Ch'eng Ming-tao (1032-1086), Chu Hsi (1130-1200), and Lu Hsiang-shan (1139-1193). It is also called Hsing-li Hsueh (Philosophy of the Nature and Reason) and Sung Hsueh (Philosophy of the Sung Dynasty). Often the term includes the idealistic philosophy of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), including Wang Yang-ming (1473-1529), sometimes called Hsin Hsueh (Philosophy of Mind). Often it also includes the philosophy of the Ch'ing dynasty (1644-1911), called Tao Hsueh, including such philosophers as Yen Hsi-chai (1635-1704) and Tai Tung-yuan (1723-1777). For a summary of the Rational Philosophy, see Chinese philosophy. For its philosophy of Reason (li), vital force (ch'i), the Great Ultimate (T'ai Chi), the passive and active principles (yin yang), the nature of man and things (hsing), the investigation of things to the utmost (ch'iung li), the extension of knowledge (chih chih), and its ethics of true manhood or love (jen), seriousness (ching) and sincerity (ch'eng), see articles on these topics. -- W.T.C. Limit: We give here only some of the most elementary mathematical senses of this word, in connection with real numbers. (Refer to the articles Number and Continuity.)\n\nThe limit of an infinite sequence of real numbers a1, a2, a3, . . . is said to be (the real number) b if for every positive real number ε there is a positive integer N such that the difference between b and an is less than ε whenever n is greater than N. (By the difference between b and an is here meant the non-negative difference, i.e., b−an if b is greater than an, an−b if b is less than an, and 0 if b is equal to an.)\n\nLet f be a monadic function for which the range of the independent variable and the range of the dependent variable both consist of real numbers; let b and c be real numbers; and let g be the monadic function so determined that g(c)=b, and g(x)=f(x) if x is different from c. (The range of the independent variable for g is thus the same as that for f, with the addition of the real number c if not already included.) The limit of f(x) as x approaches c is said to be b if g is continuous at c. -- More briefly but less accurately, the limit of f(x) as x approaches c is the value which rrust be assigned to f for the argument c in order to make it continuous at c.\n\nThe limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is said to be b, if the limit of h(x) as x approaches 0 is b, where h is the function so determined that h(x)=f( 1/x).\n\nIn connection with the infinite sequence of real numbers a1, a2, a3 . . ., a monadic function a may be introduced for which the range of the independent variable consists of the positive integers 1, 2, 3, . . . and a(1)=a1, a(2)=a2, a(3)=a3, . . . . It can then be shown that the limit of the infinite sequence as above defined is the same as the limit of a(x) as x approaches infinity.\n\n(Of course it is not meant to be implied in the preceding that the limit of an infinite sequence or of a function always exists. In particular cases it may happen that there is no limit of an infinite sequence, or no limit of f(x) as x approaches c, etc.) -- A.C.\n\nLimitative: Tending to restrict; pertaining to the limit-value. In logic, an affirmative infinitated judgment, often employed as a third quality added to affirmative and negative. More specifically used by Kant to denote judgments of the type, \"Every A is a not-B\", and since Kant, applied to the judgments known to the older logicians as indefinite. -- J.K.F. Limiting Notion: The notion of the extreme applicability of an universal principle considered as a limit. Employed by Kant (1724-1804) in his Kritik der Reinen Vernunft, A 255, to indicate the theory that experience cannot attain to the noumenon. -- J.K.F. Limits of Sensation: The two limiting sensations in the sensory continuum of any given sense: (a) the lower limit is the just noticeable sensation which if the stimulus producing it were diminished, would vanish altogether or -- in the view of some psychologists -- would pass into the unconscious. See Threshold of Consciousness, (b) The upper limit is the maximum sensation such that if the producing stimulus were increased the resultant sensation would again vanish. -- L.W. Line of Beauty: Title given by Wm. Hogarth to an undulating line supposedly containing the essence of the graphically beautiful, and so regarded as both the cause and the criterion of beauty; particular lines and paintings become beautiful as and because they exhibit this line. According to Hogarth, such lines must express \"symmetry, variety, uniformity, simplicity, intricacy, and quantity\". (Analysis of Beauty, London, 1753, p. 47.) -- I.J. Lipps, Theodor: (1851-1914) Eminent German philosopher and psychologist. The study of optical illusions led him to his theory of empathy. Starts with the presupposition that every aesthetic object represents a living being, and calls the psychic state which we experience when we project ourselves into the life of such an object, an empathy (Einfühlung) or \"fellow-feeling\". He applied this principle consistently to all the arts. The empathic act is not simply kinaesthetic inference but has exclusively objective reference. Being a peculiar source of knowledge about other egos, it is a blend of inference and intuition. Main works: Psychol. Studien, 1885; Grundzüge d. Logik, 1893; Die ethische Grundfragen, 1899; Aesthetik, 2 vols., 1903-06; Philos. u. Wirklichkeit, 1908; Psychol. Untersuch., 2 vols., 1907-12. -- H.H. Localization, Cerebral: (Lat. locus, place) The supposed correlation of mental processes, sensory and motor, with definite areas of the brain. The theory of definite and exact brain localization has been largely disproven by recent physiological investigations of Franz, Lashley and others. -- L.W. Locke, John: (1632-1714) The first great British empiricist, denied the existence of innate ideas, categories, and moral principles. The mind at birth is a tabula rasa. Its whole content is derived from sense-experience, and constructed by reflection upon sensible data. Reflection is effected through memory and its attendant activities of contemplation, distinction, comparison in point of likeness and difference, and imaginative recompositon. Even the most abstract notions and ideas, like infinity, power, cause and effect, substance and identity, which seemingly are not given by experience, are no exceptions to the rule. Thus \"infinity\" confesses our inability to limit in fact or imagination the spatial and temporal extension of sense-experience; \"substance,\" to perceive or understand why qualities congregate in separate clumps; \"power\" and \"cause and effect,\" to perceive or understand why and how these clumps follow, and seemingly produce one another as they do, or for that matter, how our volitions \"produce\" the movements that put them into effect. Incidentally, Locke defines freedom as liberty, not of choice, which is always sufficiently motivated, but of action in accordance with choice. \"Identity\" of things, Locke derives from spatial and temporal continuity of the content of clumps of sensations; of structure, from continuity of arrangement in changing content; of person, from continuity of consciousness through memory, which, incidentally, permits of alternating personalities in the same body or of the transference of the same personality from one body to another.\n\nIn these circumstances real knowledge is very limited. \"Universals\" register superficial resemblances, not the real essences of things. Experience directly \"intuits\" identity and diversity, relations, coexistences and necessary connections in its content, and, aided by memory, \"knows\" the agreements and disagreements of ideas in these respects. We also feel directly (sensitive knowledge) that our experience comes from without. Moreover, though taste, smell, colour, sound, etc. are internal to ourselves (secondary qualities) extension, shape, rest, motion, unity and plurality (primary qualities) seem to inhere in the external world independently of our perception of it. Finally, we have \"demonstrative knowledge\" of the existence of God. But of anything other than God, we have no knowledge except such as is derived from and limited by the senses.\n\nLocke also was a political, economic and religious thinker of note. A \"latitudinarian\" and broad churchman in theology and a liberal in politics, he argued against the divine right of kings and the authority of the Bible and the Church, and maintained that political sovereignty rests upon the consent of the governed, and ecclesiastical authority upon the consent of reason. He was also an ardent defender of freedom of thought and speech.

The distinction between form and content can be made definite with the aid of a particular language or symbolism in which propositions are expressed, and the formal method can then be characterized by the fact that it deals with the objective form of sentences which express propositions and provides in these concrete terms criteria of meaningfulness and validity of inference. This formulation of the matter presupposes the selection of a particular language which is to be regarded as logically exact and free from the ambiguities and irregularities of structure which appear in English (or other languages of everyday use) -- i.e., it makes the distinction between form and content relative to the choice of a language. Many logicians prefer to postulate an abstract form for propositions themselves, and to characterize the logical exactness of a language by the uniformity with which the concrete form of its sentences reproduces or parallels the form of the propositions which they express. At all events it is practically necessary to introduce a special logical language, or symbolic notation, more exact than ordinary English usage, if topics beyond the most elementary are to be dealt with (see logistic system, and semiotic).\n\nConcerning the distinction between form and content see further the articles formal, and syntax, logical.\n\n1. THE PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS formalizes the use of the sentential connectives and, or, not, if . . . then. Various systems of notation are current, of which we here adopt a particular one for purposes of exposition. We use juxtaposition to denote conjunction (\"pq\" to mean \"p and q\"), the sign ∨ to denote inclusive disjunction (\"p ∨ q\" to mean (\"p or q or both\"), the sign + to denote exclusive disiunction (\"p + q\" to mean \"p or q but not both\"), the sign ∼ to denote negation (\"∼p\" to mean \"not p\"), the sign ⊃ to denote the conditional (\"p ⊃ q\" to mean \"if p then q,\" or \"not both p and not-q\"), the sign ≡ to denote the biconditional (\"p ≡ q\" to mean \"p if and only if q,\" or \"either p and q or not-p and not-q\"), and the sign | to denote alternative denial (\"p | q\" to mean \"not both p and q\"). -- The word or is ambiguous in ordinary English usage between inclusive disjunction and exclusive disjunction, and distinct notations are accordingly provided for the two meanings of the word, The notations \"p ⊃ q\" and \"p ≡ q\" are sometimes read as \"p implies q\" and \"p is equivalent to q\" respectively. These readings must, however, be used with caution, since the terms implication and equivalence are often used in a sense which involves some relationship between the logical forms of the propositions (or the sentences) which they connect, whereas the validity of p ⊃ q and of p ≡ q requires no such relationship. The connective ⊃ is also said to stand for \"material implication,\" distinguished from formal implication (§ 3 below) and strict implication (q. v.). Similarly the connective ≡ is said to stand for \"material equivalence.\"\n\nIt is possible in various ways to define some of the sentential connectives named above in terms of others. In particular, if the sign of alternative denial is taken as primitive, all the other connectives can be defined in terms of this one. Also, if the signs of negation and inclusive disjunction are taken as primitive, all the others can be defined in terms of these; likewise if the signs of negation and conjunction are taken as primitive. Here, however, for reasons of naturalness and symmetry, we prefer to take as primitive the three connectives, denoting negation, conjunction, and inclusive disjunction. The remaining ones are then defined as follows:\n\nA | B → ∼A ∨ ∼B.\n\nA ⊃ B → ∼A ∨ B.\n\nA ≡ B → [B ⊃ A][A ⊃ B].\n\nA + B → [∼B]A ∨ [∼A]B.\n\nThe capital roman letters here denote arbitrary formulas of the propositional calculus (in the technical sense defined below) and the arrow is to be read \"stands for\" or \"is an abbreviation for.\" Suppose that we have given some specific list of propositional symbols, which may be infinite in number, and to which we shall refer as the fundamental propositional symbols. These are not necessarily single letters or characters, but may be expressions taken from any language or system of notation; they may denote particular propositions, or they may contain variables and denote ambiguously any proposition of a certain form or class. Certain restrictions are also necessary upon the way in which the fundamental propositional symbols can contain square brackets [ ]; for the present purpose it will suffice to suppose that they do not contain square brackets at all, although they may contain parentheses or other kinds of brackets. We call formulas of the propositional calculus (relative to the given list of fundamental propositional symbols) all the expressions determined by the four following rules:\n\nall the fundamental propositional symbols are formulas\n\nif A is a formula, ∼[A] is a formula;\n\nif A and B are formulas [A][B] is a formula;\n\nif A and B are formulas [A] ∨ [B] is a formula.\n\nThe formulas of the propositional calculus as thus defined will in general contain more brackets than are necessary for clarity or freedom from ambiguity; in practice we omit superfluous brackets and regard the shortened expressions as abbreviations for the full formulas. It will be noted also that, if A and B are formulas, we regard [A] | [B], [A] ⊃ [B], [A] ≡ [B], and [A] + [B], not as formulas, but as abbreviations for certain formulas in accordance with the above given definitions.\n\nIn order to complete the setting up of the propositional calculus as a logistic system (q. v.) it is necessary to state primitive formulas and primitive rules of inference. Of the many possible ways of doing this we select the following.\n\nIf A, B, C are any formulas, each of the seven following formulas is a primitive formula:\n\n[A ∨ A] ⊃ A.\n\nA ⊃ [B ⊃ AB].\n\nA ⊃ [A ∨ B].\n\nAB ⊃ A.\n\n[A ∨ B] ⊃ [B ∨ A].\n\nAB ⊃ B.\n\n[A ⊃ B] ⊃ [[C ∨ A] ⊃ [C ∨ B]].\n\n(The complete list of primitive formulas is thus infinite, but there are just seven possible forms of primitive formulas as above.) There is one primitive rule of inference, as follows: Given A and A ⊃ B to infer B. This is the inference known as modus ponens (see below, §2).\n\nThe theorems of the propositional calculus are the formulas which can be derived from the primitive formulas by a succession of applications of the primitive rule of inference. In other words,\n\nthe primitive formulas are theorems, and\n\nif A and A ⊃ B are theorems then B is a theorem.\n\nAn inference from premisses A1, A2, . . . , An to a conclusion B is a valid inference of the propositional calculus if B becomes a theorem upon adding A1, A2, . . . , An to the list of primitive formulas. In other words,\n\nthe inference from A1, A2, . . . , An to B is a valid inference if B is either a primitive formula or one of the formulas A1, A2, . . . , An, and\n\nif the inference from A1, A2, . . . , An to C and the inference from A1, A2, . . . , An to C ⊃ B are both valid inferences then the inference from A1, A2, . . . , An to B is a valid inference.\n\nIt can be proved that the inference from A1, A2, . . . , An to B is a valid inference of the propositional calculus if (obviously), and only if (the deduction theorem), [A1 ⊃ [A2 ⊃ . . . [An ⊃ B] . . . ]] is a theorem of the propositional calculus.\n\nThe reader should distinguish between theorems about the propositional calculus -- the deduction theorem, the principles of duality (below), etc. -- and theorems of the propositional calculus in the sense just defined. It is convenient to use such words as theorem, premiss, conclusion both for propositions (in whatever language expressed) and for formulas representing propositions in some fixed system or calculus.\n\nIn the foregoing the list of fundamental propositional symbols has been left unspecified. A case of special importance is the case that the fundamental propositional symbols are an infinite list of variables, p, q, r, . . ., which may be taken as representing ambiguously any proposition whatever -- or any proposition of a certain class fixed in advance (the class should be closed under the operations of negation, conjunction, and inclusive disjunction). In this case we speak of the pure propositional calculus, and refer to the other cases as applied propositional calculus (although the application may be to something as abstract in character as the pure propositional calculus itself, as, e.g., in the case of the pure functional calculus of first order (§3), which contains an applied propositional calculus).\n\nIn formulating the pure propositional calculus the primitive formulas may (if desired) be reduced to a finite number, e.g., to the seven listed above with A, B, C taken to be the particular variables p, q, r. A second primitive rule of inference, the rule of substitution is then required, allowing the inference from a formula A to the formula obtained from A by substituting a formula B for a particular variable in A (the same formula B must be substituted for all occurrences of that variable in A). The definition of a theorem is then given in the same way as before, allowing for the additional primitive rule, the definition of a valid inference must, however, be modified.\n\nIn what follows (to the end of §1) we shall, for convenience of statement, confine attention to the case of the pure propositional calculus. Similar statements hold, with minor modifications, for the general case.\n\nThe formulation which we have given provides a means of proving theorems of the propositional calculus, the proof consisting of an explicit finite sequence of formulas, the last of which is the theorem proved, and each of which is either a primitive formula or inferable from preceding formulas by a single application of the rule of inference (or one of the rules of inference, if the alternative formulation of the pure propositional calculus employing the rule of substitution is adopted). The test whether a given finite sequence of formulas is a proof of the last formula of the sequence is effective -- we have the means of always determining of a given formula whether it is a primitive formula, and the means of always determining of a given formula whether it is inferable from a given finite list of formulas by a single application of modus ponens (or substitution). Indeed our formulation would not be satisfactory otherwise. For in the contrary case a proof would not necessarily carry conviction, the proposer of a proof could fairly be asked to give a proof that it was a proof -- in short the formal analysis of what constitutes a proof (in the sense of a cogent demonstration) would be incomplete.\n\nHowever, the test whether a given formula is a theorem, by the criterion that it is a theorem if a proof of it exists, is not effective -- since failure to find a proof upon search might mean lack of ingenuity rather than non-existence of a proof. The problem to give an effective test by means of which it can always be determined whether a given formula is a theorem is the decision problem, of the propositional calculus. This problem can be solved either by the process of reduction of a formula to disjunctive normal form, or by the truth-table decision procedure. We state the latter in detail.\n\nThe three primitive connectives (and consequently all connectives definable from them) denote truth-functions -- i.e., the truth-value (truth or falsehood) of each of the propositions &min;p, pq, and p ∨ q is uniquely determined by the truth-values of p and q. In fact,\n\n&min;p is true if p is false and false if p is true;\n\npq is true if p and q are both true, false otherwise;\n\np ∨ q is false if p and q are both false, true otherwise.\n\nThus, given a formula of the (pure) propositional calculus and an assignment of a truth-value to each of the variables appearing, we can reckon out by a mechanical process the truth-value to be assigned to the entire formula. If, for all possible assignments of truth-values to the variables appearing, the calculated truth-value corresponding to the entire formula is truth, the formula is said to be a tautology.The test whether a formula is a tautology is effective, since in any particular case the total number of different assignments of truth-values to the variables is finite, and the calculation of the truth-value corresponding to the entire formula can be carried out separately for each possible assignment of truth-values to the variables.\n\nNow it is readily verified that all the primitive formulas are tautologies, and that for the rule of modus ponens (and the rule of substitution) the property holds that if the premisses of the inference are tautologies the conclusion must be a tautology. It follows that every theorem of the propositional calculus is a tautology. By a more difficult argument it can be shown also that every tautology is a theorem. Hence the test whether a formula is a tautology provides a solution of the decision problem of the propositional calculus.\n\nAs corollaries of this we have proofs of the consistency of the propositional calculus (if A is any formula, A and ∼A cannot both be tautologies and hence cannot both be theorems) and of the completeness of the propositional calculus (it can be shown that if any formula not already a theorem, and hence not a tautology, is added to the list of primitive formulas, the calculus becomes inconsistent on the basis of the two rules, substitution and modus ponens).\n\nAs another corollary of this, or otherwise, we obtain also the following theorem about the propositional calculus:\n\nIf A ≡ B is a theorem, and D is the result of replacing a particular occurrence of A by B in the formula C, then the inference from C to D is a valid inference.\n\nThe dual of a formula C of the propositional calculus is obtained by interchanging conjunction and disjunction throughout the formula, i.e., by replacing AB everywhere by A ∨ B, and A ∨ B by AB. Thus, e.g., the dual of the formula ∼[pq ∨ ∼r] is the formula ∼[[p ∨ q] ∼r]. In forming the dual of a formula which is expressed with the aid of the defined connectives, |, ⊃, ≡, +, it is convenient to remember that the effect of interchanging conjunction and (inclusive) disjunction is to replace A|B by ∼A∼B, to replace A ⊃ B by ∼A B; and to interchange ≡ and +.\n\nIt can be shown that the following principles of duality hold in the propositional calculus (where A* and B* denote the duals of the formulas A and B respectively):\n\nif A is a theorem, then ∼A* is a theorem;\n\nif A ⊃ B is a theorem, then B* ⊃ A* is a theorem;\n\nif A ≡ B is a theorem, then A* ≡ B* is a theorem.\n\nSpecial names have been given to certain particular theorems and forms of valid inference of the propositional calculus. Besides § 2 following, see:\n\nabsorption;\n\naffirmation of the consequent;\n\nassertion;\n\nassociative law;\n\ncommutative law;\n\ncomposition;\n\ncontradiction, law of;\n\nDe Morgan's laws;\n\ndenial of the antecedent;\n\ndistributive law;\n\ndouble negation, law of;\n\nexcluded middle, law of;\n\nexportation;\n\nHauber's law;\n\nidentity, law of;\n\nimportation;\n\nPeirce's law;\n\nproof by cases;\n\nreductio ad absurdum;\n\nreflexivity;\n\ntautology;\n\ntransitivity;\n\ntransposition.\n\nNames given to particular theorems of the propositional calculus are usually thought of as applying to laws embodied in the theorems rather than to the theorems as formulas; hence, in particular, the same name is applied to theorems differing only by alphabetical changes of the variables appearing; and frequently the name used for a theorem is used also for one or more forms of valid inference associated with the theorem. Similar remarks apply to names given to particular theorems of the functional calculus of first order, etc.\n\nWhitehead and Russell,\n\nPrincibia Mathematica. 2nd edn., vol. 1. Cambridge.

HYPOTHETICAL SYLLOGISM, DISJUNCTIVE SYLLOGISM, DILEMMA are names traditionally given to certain, forms of inference, which may be identified as follows with certain particular forms of valid inference of the propositional calculus (see § 1).\n\nThe hypothetical syllogism has two kinds or moods. Modus ponens is the inference from a major premiss A ⊃ B and a minor premiss A to the conclusion B. Modus tollens is the inference from a major premiss A ⊃ B and a minor premiss ∼B to the conclusion ∼A.\n\nThe disjunctive syllogism has also two moods. Modus tollendo ponens is any one of the four following forms of inference:\n\nfrom A ∨ B and ∼B to A;\n\nfrom A ∨ B and ∼A to B*\n\nfrom A + B and ∼B to A;\n\nfrom A + B and ∼A to B.\n\nModus ponendo tollens is either of the following forms of inference:\n\nfrom A + B and A to ∼B;\n\nfrom A + B and B to ∼A.\n\nIn each case the first premiss named is the major premiss and the second one the minor premiss.\n\nOf the dilemma four kinds are distinguished. The simple constructive dilemma has two major premisses A ⊃ C and B ⊃ C, minor premiss A ∨ B, conclusion C. The simple destructive dilemma has two major premisses A ⊃ B and A ⊃ C, minor premiss ∼B ∨ ∼C, conclusion ∼A. The complex constructive dilemma has two major premisses A ⊃ B and C ⊃ D, minor premiss A ∨ C, conclusion B ∨ D. The complex destructive dilemma has two major premisses A ⊃ B and C ⊃ D, minor premiss ∼B ∨ ∼D, conclusion ∼A ∨ ∼C. (Since the conclusion of a complex dilemma must involve inclusive disjunction, it seems that the traditional account is best rendered by employing inclusive disjunction throughout.)\n\nThe inferences from A ⊃ B and C ⊃ A to C &sup B, and from A ⊃ B and C ⊃ ∼B to C ⊃ ∼A are called pure hypothetical syllogisms, and the above simpler forms of the hypothetical syllogism are then distinguished as mixed hypothetical. Some recent writers apply the names, modus ponens and modus tollens respectively, also to these two forms of the pure hypothetical syllogism. Other variations of usage or additional forms arc also found. Some writers include under these heads forms of inference which belong to the functional calculus of first order rather than to the propositional calculus.\n\nF.

THE FUNCTIONAL CALCULUS OF FIRST ORDER is the next discipline beyond the propositional calculus, according to the usual treatment. It is the first step towards the hierarchy of types (§ 6) and deals, in addition to unanalyzed propositions, with propositional functions (q. v.) of the lowest order. It employs the sentential connectives of § 1, and in addition the universal quantifier (q. v.), written (X) where X is any individual variable, and the existential quantifier, written (EX) where X is any individual variable. (The E denoting existential quantification is more often written inverted, as by Peano and Whitehead-Russell, but we here adopt the typographically more convenient usage, which also has sanction.)\n\nFor the interpretation of the calculus we must presuppose a certain domain of individuals. This may be any well-defined non-empty domain, within very wide limits. Different posslhle choices of the domain of individuals lead to different interpretations of the calculus.\n\nIn order to set the calculus up formally as a logistic system, we suppose that we have given four lists of symbols, as follows:\n\nan infinite list of individual variables x, y, z, t, x', y', z', t', x'', . . . , which denote ambiguously any individual;\n\na list of propositional variables p, q, r, s, p', . . . , representing ambiguously any proposition of a certain appropriate class;\n\na list of functional variables F1, G1, H1, . . . , F2, G2, H2, . . . , F3, G3, H3, . . . , a variable with subscript n representing ambiguously any n-adic propositional function of individuals;\n\na list of functional constants, which denote particular propositional functions of individuals. There shall be an effective notational criterion associating with each functional constant a positive integer n, the functional constant denoting an n-adic propositional function of individuals.\n\nOne or more of the lists (2), (3), (4) may be empty, but not both (3) and (4) shall be empty. The list (1) is required to be infinite, and the remaining lists may, some or all of them, be infinite. Finally, no symbol shall be duplicated either by appearing twice in the same list or by appearing in two different lists; and no functional constant shall contain braces [ ] (or either a left brace or a right brace) as a constituent part of the symbol.\n\nWhen (2) and (3) are complete -- i.e., contain all the variables indicated above (an infinite number of propositional variables and for each positive integer n an infinite number of functional variables with subscript n) -- and (4) is empty, we shall speak of the pure functional calculus of first order. When (2) and (3) are empty and (4) is not empty, we shall speak of a simple applied functional calculus of first order.\n\nFunctional variables and functional constants are together called functional symbols (the adjective functional being here understood to refer to propositional functions). Functional symbols are called n-adic if they are either functional variables with subscript n or functional constants denoting n-adic propositional functions of individuals. The formulas of the functional calculus of first order (relative to the given lists of symbols (1), (2), (3), (4)) are all the expressions determined by the eight following rules:\n\nall the propositional variables are formulas;\n\nif F is a monadic functional symbol and X is an individual variable, [F](X) is a formula;\n\nif F is an n-adic functional symbol and X1, X2, . . . , Xn are individual variables (which may or may not be all different), [F](X1, X2, . . . , Xn) is a formula;\n\nif A is a formula, ∼[A] is a formula;\n\nif A nnd B are formulas, [A][B] is a formula;\n\nif A and B are formulas, [A] ∨ [B] is a formula;\n\nif A is a formula and X is an individual variable, (X)[A] is a formula;\n\nif A is a formula and X is an individual variable, (EX)[A] is a formula.\n\nIn practice, we omit superfluous brackets and braces (but not parentheses) in writing formulas, nnd we omit subscripts on functional variables in cases where the subscript is sufficiently indicated by the form of the formula in which the functional variable appears. The sentential connectives |, ⊃, ≡, +, are introduced as abbreviations in the same way as in § 1 for the propositional calculus. We make further the following definitions, which are also to be construed as abbreviations, the arrow being read \"stands for\":\n\n[A] ⊃x [B] → (X)[[A] ⊃ [B]].\n\n[A] ≡x [B] → (X)[[A] ≡ [B]].\n\n[A] ∧x [B] → (EX)[[A][B]].\n\n(Here A and B are any formulas, and X is any individual variable. Brackets may be omitted when superfluous.) If F and G denote monadic propositional functions, we say that F(X) ⊃x G(X) expresses formal implication of the function G by the function F, and F(X) ≡x G(X) expresses formal equivalence of the two functions (the adjective formal is perhaps not well chosen here but has become established in use).\n\nA sub-formula of a given formula is a consecutive constituent part of the given formula which is itself a formula. An occurrence of an individual variable X in a formula is a bound occurrence of X if it is an occurrence in a sub-formula of either of the forms (X) [A] or (EX)[A]. Any other occurrence of a variable in a formula is a free occurrence. We may thus speak of the bound variables and the free variables of a formula. (Whitehead and Russell, following Peano, use the terms apparent variables and real variables, respectively, instead of bound variables and free variables.)\n\nIf A, B, C are any formulas, each of the seven following formulas is a primitive formula:\n\n[A ∨ A] ⊃ A.\n\nA ⊃ [B ⊃ AB].\n\nA ⊃ [A ∨ B].\n\nAB ⊃ A.\n\n[A ∨ B] ⊃ [B ∨ A].\n\nAB ⊃ B.\n\n[A ⊃ B] ⊃ [[C ∨ A] ⊃ [C ∨ B]].\n\nIf X is any individual variable, and A is any formula not containing a free occurrence of X, and B is any formula, each of the two following formulas is a primitive formula;\n\n[A ⊃x B] ⊃ [A⊃ (X)B].\n\n[B ⊃x A] ⊃ [(EX)B ⊃ A].\n\nIf X and Y are any individual variables (the same or different), and A is any formula such that no free occurrence of X in A is in a sub-formula of the form (Y) [C], and B is the formula resulting from the substitution of Y for all the free occurrences of X in A, each of the two following formulas is a primitive formula:\n\n(X)A ⊃ B.\n\nB ⊃ (EX)A.\n\nThere are two primitive rules of inference:\n\nGiven A and A ⊃ B to infer B (the rule of modus ponens).\n\nGiven A to infer (X)A, where X is any individual variable (the rule of generalization). In applying the rule of generalization, we say that the variable X is generalized upon.\n\nThe theorems of the functional calculus of first order are the formulas which can he derived from the primitive formulas by a succession of applications of the primitive rules of inference. An inference from premisses A1, A2, . . . , An to a conclusion B is a valid inference of the functional calculus of first order if B becomes a theorem upon adding A1, A2, . . . , An to the list of primitive formulas and at the same time restricting the rule of generalization by requiring that the variable generalized upon shall not be any one of the free individual variables of A1, A2, . . . . , An. It can be proved that the inference from A1, A2, . . . , An to B is a valid inference of the functional calculus of first order if (obviously), and only if (the deduction threorem), [A2 ⊃ [A2⊃ . . . [An ⊃ B] . . . ]] is a theorem of the functional calculus of first order.\n\nIt can be proved that if A ≡ B is a theorem, and D is the result of replacing a particular occurrence of A by B in the formula C, then the inference from C to D is a valid inference.\n\nThe consistency of the functional calculus of first order can also be proved without great difficulty.\n\nThe dual of a formula is obtained by interchanging conjunction and (inclusive) disjunction throughout and at the same time interchanging universal quantification and existential quantification throughout. (In doing this the different symbols, e.g., functional constants, although they may consist of several characters in succession rather than a single character, shall be treated as units, and no change shall be made inside a symbol. A similar remark, applies at all places where we speak of occurrences of a particular symbol or sequence of symbols in a formula, and the like.) It can be shown that the following principles of duality hold (where A* and B* denote the duals of. the formulas A and B respectively):\n\nif A is a theorem, then ∼A* is a theorem;\n\nif A ⊃ B is a theorem, then B* ⊃ A* is a theorem;\n\nif A ≡ B is a theorem, then A* ≡ B* is a theorem.\n\nA formula is said to be in prenex normal form if all the quantifiers which it contains stand together at the beginning, unseparated by negations (or other sentential connectives), and the scope of each quantifier (i.e., the extent of the bracket [ ] following the quantifier) is to the end of the entire formula. In the case of a formula in prenex normal form, the succession of quantifiers at the beginning is called the prefix; the remaining portion contains no quantifiers and is the matrix of the formula. It can be proved that for every formula A there is a formula B in prenex normal form such that A ≡ B is a theorem; and B is then called a prenex normal form of A.\n\nA formula of the pure functional calculus of first order which contains no free individual variables is said to be satisfiable if it is possible to determine the underlying non-empty domain of individuals and to give meanings to the propositional and functional variables contained -- namely to each propositional variable a meaning as a particular proposition and to each n-adic functional variable a meaning as an n-adic propositional function of individuals (of the domain in question) -- in such a way that (under the accepted meanings of the sentential connectives, the quantifiers, and application of function to argument) the formula becomes true. The meaning of the last word, even for abstract, not excluding infinite, domains, must be presupposed -- a respect in which this definition differs sharply from most others made in this article.\n\nIt is not difficult to find examples of formulas A, containing no free individual variables, such that both A and ∼A are satisfiaMe. A simple example is the formula (x)F(x). More instructive is the following example,\n\n[(x)(y)(z)[[∼F{x,x)][F(x, y)F(y,z) ⊃ F(x,z)]]][(x)(Ey)F(x,y)],\n\nwhich is satisfiable in an infinite domain of individuals but not in any finite domain -- the negation is satisfiable in any non-empty domain.\n\nIt can be shown that all theorems A of the pure functional calculus of first order which contain no free individual variables have the property that ∼A is not satisfiable. Hence the pure functional calculus of first order is not complete in the strong sense in which the pure propositional calculus is complete. Gödel has shown that the pure functional calculus of first order is complete in the weaker sense that if a formula A contains no free individual variables and ∼A is not satisfiable then A is a theorem.\n\nThe decision problem, of the pure functional calculus of first order has two forms\n\nthe so-called proof-theoretic decision problem, to find an effective test (decision procedure) by means of which it can always be determined whether a given formula is a theorem;\n\nthe so-called set-theoretic decision problem, to find an effective test by means of which it can always be determined whether a given formula containing no free individual variables is satisfiable.\n\nIt follows from Gödel's completeness theorem that these two forms of the decision problem are equivalent: a solution of either would lead immediately to a solution of the other.\n\nChurch has proved that the decision problem of the pure functional calculus of first order is unsolvable. Solutions exist, however, for several important special cases. In particular a decision procedure is known for the case of formulas containing only monadic function variables (this would seem to cover substantially everything considered in traditional formal logic prior to the introduction of the modern logic of relations).\n\nFinally we mention a variant form of the functional calculus of first order, the functional calculus of first order with equality, in which the list of functional constants includes the dyadic functional constant =, denoting equality or identity of individuals. The notation [X] = [Y] is introduced as an abbreviation for [=] (X, Y), and primitive formulas are added as follows to the list already given:\n\nif X is any individual variable, X = X is a primitive formula;\n\nif X and Y are any individual variables, and B results from the substitution of Y for a particular free occurrence of X in A, which is not in a sub-formula of A of the form (Y)[C], then [X = Y] ⊃ [A ⊃ B] is a primitive formula.\n\nWe speak of the pure functional calculus of first order with equality when the lists of propositional variables and functional variables are complete and the only functional constant is =; we speak of a simple applied functional calculus of first order with equality when the lists of propositional variables and functional variables are empty.\n\nThe addition to the functional calculus of first order of individual constants (denoting particular individuals) is not often made -- unless symbols for functions from individuals to individuals (so-called \"mathematical\" or \"descriptive\" functions) are to be added at the same time. Such an addition is, however, employed in the two following sections as a means of representing certain forms of inference of traditional logic. The addition is really non-essential, and requires only minor changes in the definition of a formula and the list of primitive formulas (allowing the alternative of individual constants at certain places where the above given formulation calls for free individual variables).\n\nWhitehead and Russell,\n\nPrincipia Matbematica, 2nd edn., vol. 1, Cambridge, England, 1925.\n\nJ.

OPPOSITION, IMMEDIATE INFERENCE. The four traditional kinds of categorical propositions --\n\nall S is P,\n\nno S is P,\n\nsome S is P,\n\nsome S is not P\n\n-- customarily designated by the letters A, E, I, O respectively -- may conveniently be represented in the functional calculus of first order (§ 3) by the four forms\n\nS(x) ⊃x P(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x ∼P(x),\n\nS(xr) ∧x P(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x),\n\nS and P being taken as functional constants. (For brevity, we shall use the notations S, P, S(x) ⊃x P(x), etc., alike for certain formulas and for the propositional functions or propositions expressed by these formulas.)\n\nThis representation does not reproduce faithfully all particulars of the traditional account. The fact is that the traditional doctrine, having grown up from various sources and under an inadequate formal analysis, is not altogether what seems to be the best representation, and simply note the four following points of divergence:\n\nWe have defined the connectives ⊃x and ∧x in terms of universal and existential quantification, whereas the traditional account might be thought to be more closely reproduced if they were taken as primitive notations. (It would, however, not be difficult to reformulate the functional calculus of first order so that these connectives would be primitive and the usual quantifiers defined in terms of them.)\n\nThe traditional account associates the negation in E and O with the copula (q. v.), whereas the negation symbol is here prefixed to the sub-formula P(x). (Notice that this sub-formula represents ambiguously a proposition and that, in fact, the notation of the functional calculus of first order provides for applying negation only to propositions.)\n\nThe traditional account includes under A and E respectively, also (propositions denoted by) P(A) and ∼P(A), where A is an individual constant. These singular propositions are ignored in our account of opposition and immediate inference, but will appear in § 5 as giving variant forms of certain syllogisms.\n\nSome aspects of the traditional account require that A and E be represented as we have here, others that they be represented by\n\n[(Ex)S(x)][S(x) ⊃x P(x)]\n\nand\n\n[(Ex)S(x)][S(x) ⊃x ∼P(x)]\n\nrespectively. The question concerning the choice between these two interpretations is known as the problem of existential import of propositions. We prefer to introduce (Ex)S(x) as a separate premiss at those places where it is required.\n\nGiven a fixed subject S and a fixed predicate P, we have, according to the square of opposition, that A and O are contradictory, E and I are contradictory, A and E are contrary, I and O are subcontrary, A and I are subaltern, E and O are subaltern. The two propositions in a contradictory pair cannot be both true and cannot be both false (one is the exact negation of the other). The two propositions in a subaltern pair are so related that the first one, together with the premiss (Ex)S(x), implies the second (subalternation). Under the premiss (Ex)S(x), the contrary pair, A, E, cannot be both true, and the subcontrary pair, I, O, cannot be both false.\n\nSimple conversion of a proposition, A, E, I, or O, consists in interchanging S and P without other change. Thus the converse of S(x) ⊃x P(x) is P(x) ⊃x S(x), and the converse of S(x) ⊃x ∼P(x) is P(x) ⊃x ∼S(x). In mathematics the term converse is used primarily for the simple converse of a proposition A; loosely also for any one of a number of transformations similar to this (e.g., F(x)G(x) ⊃x H (x) may be said to have the converse F(x)H(x) ⊃x G(x)). Simple conversion of a proposition is a valid inference, in general, only in the case of E and I.\n\nConversion per accidens of a proposition A. i.e., of S(x) ⊃x P(x), yields P(x) ∧x S(x).\n\nObversion of a proposition A, E, I, or O consists in replacing P by a functional constant p which denotes the negation of the propositional function (property) denoted by P, and at the same time inserting ∼ if not already present or deleting it if present. Thus the obverse of S(x) ⊃x P(x) is S(x) ⊃x ∼p(x) (the obverse of \"all men are mortal\" is \"no men are immortal\"). The obverse of S(x) ⊃x ∼P(x) is S(x) ⊃x p(x); the obverse of S(x) ∧x P(x) is S(x) ∧x ∼p(x); the obverse of S(x) ∧x ∼P(x) is S(x) ∧x p(x).\n\nThe name immediate inference is given to certain inferences involving propositions A, E, I, O. These include obversion of A, E, I, or O, simple conversion of E or I, conversion per accidens of A, subalternation of A, E. The three last require the additional premiss (Ex)S(x). Other immediate inferences (for which the terminology is not wholly uniform among different writers) may be obtained by means of sequences of these: e.g., given that all men are mortal we may take the obverse of the converse of the obverse and so infer that all immortals are non-men (called by some the contrapositive, by others the obverted contrapositive).\n\nThe immediate inferences not involving obversion can be represented as valid inferences in the functional calculus of first order, but obversion can be to represented only in an extended calculus embracing functional abstraction (q. v.). For the p used above in describing obversion is, in terms of abstraction,\n\nλx[∼P(x)].\n\nF. Ueberweg,\n\nSystem der Logik, 4th edn., Bonn, 1874.\n\nH. W. B.

CATEGORICAL SYLLOGISM is the name given to certain forms of valid inference (of the functional calculus of first order) which involve as premisses two (formulas representing) categorical propositions, having a term in common -- the middle term. Using S, M, P as minor term, middle term, and major term, respectively, we give the traditional classification into figures and moods. In each case we give the major premiss first, the minor premiss immediately after it, and the conclusion last; in some cases we give a third (existential) premiss which is suppressed in the traditional account. Because of the admission of singular propositions under the heads A, E, two different forms of valid inference appear in some cases under the same figure and mood -- these singular forms are separately listed.\n\nFirst Figure\n\nBarbara:\n\nM(x) ⊃x P(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x P(x).\n\nCelarent:\n\nM(x) ⊃x ∼P(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x P(x).\n\nDarii:\n\nM(x) ⊃x P(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x M(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x P(x).\n\nFerio:\n\nM(x) ⊃x ∼P(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x M(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nSecond Figure\n\nCesare:\n\nP(x) ⊃x ∼M(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x ∼P(x).\n\nCamestres:\n\nP(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x ∼M(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x ∼P(x).\n\nFestino:\n\nP(x) ⊃x ∼M(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x M(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nBaroco:\n\nP(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼M(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nThird Figure\n\nDarapti:\n\nM(x) ⊃x P(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\n(Ex)M(x),S(x) ∧x P(x).\n\nDisamis:\n\nM(x) ∧x p(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x p(x).\n\nDatisi:\n\nM(x) ⊃x P(x),\n\nM(x) ∧x S(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x P(x).\n\nFelapton:\n\nM(x) ⊃x ∼P(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\n(Ex)M(x), S(x) ∧x ∼p(x).\n\nBocardo:\n\nM(x) ∧x ∼P(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nFcriso or Ferison:\n\nM(x) ⊃x ∼P(x),\n\nM(x) ∧x S(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nFourth Figure\n\nBamalip or Bramantip:\n\nP(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\n(Ex)P(x), S(x) ∧x p(x).\n\nCalemes or Camenes:\n\nP(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x ∼S(x),\n\nS(x) ⊃x ∼P(x).\n\nDimatis or Dimaris:\n\nP(x) ∧x M(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x P(x).\n\nFesapo:\n\nP(x) ⊃x ∼M(x),\n\nM(x) ⊃x S(x),\n\n(Ex)M(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nFresison:\n\nP(x) ⊃x ∼M(x),\n\nM(x) ∧x S(x),\n\nS(x) ∧x ∼P(x).\n\nSingular Forms in the First and Second Figures\n\nBarbara:\n\nM(x) ⊃x P(x),\n\nM(A),\n\nP(A).\n\nCelarent:\n\nM(x) ⊃x ∼P(x),\n\nM(A),\n\n∼P(A).\n\nCesare:\n\nP(x) ⊃x ∼M(x),\n\nM(A),\n\n∼P(A).\n\nCamestres:\n\nP(x) ⊃x M(x),\n\n∼M(A),\n\n∼P(A).\n\nThe five moods of the fourth figure are sometimes characterized instead as indirect moods of the first figure, the two premisses (major and minor) being interchanged, and the names being then given respectively as Baralipton, Celantes, Dabitis, Fapesmo, Frisesomorum.

THEORY OF TYPES. In the functional calculus of first order, variables which appear as arguments of propositional functions or which are bound by quantifiers must be variables which are restricted to a certain limited range, the kinds of propositions about propositional functions which cannot be expressed in the calculus. The uncritical attempt to remove this restriction, by introducing variables of unlimited range (the range covering both non-functions and functions of whatever kind) and modifying accordingly the definition of a formula and the lists of primitive formulas and primitive rules of inference, leads to a system which is formally inconsistent through the possibility of deriving in it certain of the logical paradoxes (q. v.). The functional calculus of first order may, however, be extended in another way, which involves separating propositional functions into a certain array of categories (the hierarchy of types), excluding. propositional functions which do not fall into one of these categories, and -- besides propositional and individual variables -- admitting only variables having a particular one of these categories as range.\n\nFor convenience of statement, we confine attention to the pure functional calculus of first order. The first step in the extension consists in introducing quantifiers such as (F1), (EF1), (F2), (EF3), etc., binding n-adic functional variables. Corresponding changes are made in the definition of a formula and in the lists of primitive formulas and primitive rules of inference, allowing for these new kinds of bound variables. The resulting system is the functional calculus of second order. Then the next step consists in introducing new kinds of functional variables; namely for every finite ordered set k, l, m, . . . , p of i non-negative integers (i = 1, 2, 3, . . .) an infinite list of functional variables Fklm . . .p, Gklm . . .p, . . . , each of which denotes ambiguously any i-adic propositional function for which the first argument may be any (k-1)-adic propositional function of individuals, the second argument any (l-1)-adic propositional function of individuals, etc. (if one of the integers k, l, m, . . . , p is 1 the corresponding argument is a proposition -- if 0, an individual). Then quantifiers are introduced binding these new kinds of functional variables; and so on. The process of alternately introducing new kinds of functional variables (denoting propositional functions which take as arguments propositional functions of kinds for which variables have already been introduced) and quantifiers binding the new kinds of functional variables, with appropriate extension at each stage of the definition of a formula and the lists of primitive formulas and primitive rules of inference, may be continued to infinity. This leads to what we may call the functional calculus of order omega, embodying the (so-called simple) theory of types.\n\nIn the functional calculi of second and higher orders, we may introduce the definitions:\n\nX = Y → (F)[F(X) ⊃ F(Y)],\n\nwhere X and Y are any two variables of the same type and F is a monadic functional variable of appropriate type. The notation X = Y may then be interpreted as denoting equality or identity.\n\nThe functional calculus of order omega (as just described) can be proved to be consistent by a straightforward generalization of the method employed by Hilbert and Ackermann to prove the consistency of the functional calculus of first order.\n\nFor many purposes, however, it is necessary to add to the functional calculus of order omega the axiom of infinity, requiring the domain of individuals to be infinite. -- This is most conveniently done by adding a single additional primitive formula, which may be described by referring to § 3 above, taking the formula, which is there given as an example of a formula satisfiable in an infinite domain of individuals but not in any finite domain, and prefixing the quantifier (EF) with scope extending to the end of the formula. This form of the axiom of infinity, however, is considerably stronger (in the absence of the axiom of choice) than the \"Infin ax\" of Whitehead and Russell.\n\nOther primitive formulas (possibly involving new primitive notations) which may be added correspond to the axiom of choice (q. v.) or are designed to introduce classes (q. v.) or descriptions (q. v.). Functional abstraction (q. v.) may also be Introduced by means of additional primitive formulas or primitive rules of inference, or it may be defined with the aid of descriptions. Whitehead and Russell employ the axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice but avoid the necessity of special primitive formulas in connection with classes and descriptions by introducing classes and descriptions as incomplete symbols.\n\nWith the aid of the axiom of infinity and a method of dealing with classes and descriptions, the non-negative integers may be introduced in any one of various ways (e.g., following Frege and Russell, as finite cardinal numbers), and arithmetic (elementary number theory) derived formally within the system. With the further addition of the axiom of choice, analysis (real number theory) may be likewise derived.\n\nNo proof of consistency of the functional calculus of order omega (or even of lower order) wiih the axiom of infinity added is known, except by methods involving assumptions so strong as to destroy any major significance.\n\nAccording to an important theorem of Gödel, the functional calculus of order omega with the axiom of infinity added, if consistent, is incomplete in the sense that there are formulas A containing no free variables, such that neither A nor ∼A is a theorem. The same thing holds of any logistic system obtained by adding new primitive formulas and primitive rules of inference, provided only that the effective (recursive) character of the formal construction of the system is retained. Thus the system is not only incomplete but, in the indicated sense, incompletable. The same thing holds also of a large variety of logistic systems which could be considered as acceptable substitutes for the functional calculus of order omega with axiom of infinity; in particular the Zermelo set theory (§ 9 below) is in the same sense incomplete and incompletable.\n\nThe formalization as a logistic system of the functional calculus of order omega with axiom of infinity leads, by a method which cannot be given here, to a (definite but quite complicated) proposition of arithmetic which is equivalent to -- in a certain sense, expresses -- the consistency of the system. This proposition of arithmetic can be represented within the system by a formula A containing no free variables, and the following second form of gödel's incompleteness theorem can then be proved: If the system is consistent, then the formula A, although its meaning is a true proposition of arithmetic, is not a theorem of the system. We might, of course, add A to the system as a new primitive formula -- we would then have a new system, whose consistency would correspond to a new proposition of arithmetic, represented by a new formula B (containing no free variables), and we would still have in the new system, if consistent, that B was not a theorem.\n\nWhitehead and Russell,\n\nPrincipia Mathematica, 3 vols., Cambridge England, 1st edn. 1910-13, 2nd edn. 1925-27.\n\nR.

ALGEBRA OF CLASSES deals with classes (q. v.) whose members are from a fixed non-empty class called the universe of discourse, and with the operations of complementation, logical sum, and logical product upon such classes. (The classes are to be thought of as determined by propositional functions having the universe of discourse as the range of the independent variable.) The universal class ∨ comprises the entire universe of discourse. The null (or empty) class ∧ has no members. The complement −a of a class a has as members all those elements of the universe of discourse which are not members of a (and those only). In particular the null class and the universal class are each the complement of the other. The logical sum a ∪ b of two classes a and b has as members all those elements which are members either of a or of b, not excluding elements which are members of both a and b (and those only). The logical product a ∩ b of two classes a and b has as members all those elements which are members of both a and b (and those only) -- in other words the logical product of two classes is their common part. The expressions of the algebra of classes are built up out of class variables a, b, c, . . . and the symbols for the universal class and the null class by means of the notations for complementation, logical sum, and logical product (with parentheses). A formula of the algebra of classes consists of two expressions with one of the symbols = or ≠ between. (a = b means that a and b are the same class, a ≠ b that a and b are not the same class.)\n\nWhile the algebra of classes can be set up as an independent logistic system, we shall here describe it instead by reference to the functional calculus of first order (§ 3), using two monadic functional constants, ∨ and ∧ and an infinite list of monadic functional variables F1, G1, H1, . . . corresponding in order to the class variables a, b, c, . . . respectively. Given any expression A of the algebra of classes, the corresponding formula A‡ of the functional calculus is obtained by replacing complementation, logical sum, and logical product respectively by negation, inclusive disjunction, and conjunction, and at the same time replacing ∨, ∧, a, b, c, . . . respectively by ∨(x), ∧(x), F1(x), G1(x), H1(x), . . . . Given any formula A = B of the algebra of classes the corresponding formula of the functional calculus is A‡ ≡x B‡. Given any formula A ≠ B of the algebra of classes, the corresponding formula of the functional calculus is ∼[A‡ ≡x B‡]. A formula C is a theorem of the algebra of classes if and only if the inference from (x)∨(x) and (x)∼∧(x) to C‡ (where C‡ corresponds to C) is a valid inference of the functional calculus. The inference from premisses D1, D2, . . ., Dn to a conclusion C is a valid inference of the algebra of classes if and only if the inference from (x)∨(x), (x)∼∧(x), D1‡, D2‡, . . . , Dn‡ to C‡ is a valid inference of the functional calculus.\n\nThis isomorphism between the algebra of classes and the indicated part of the functional calculus of first order can be taken as representing a parallelism of meaning. In fact, the meanings become identical if we wish to construe the functional calculus in extension, (see the article propositional function); or, inversely, if we wish to construe the algebra of classes in intension, instead of the usual construction.\n\nIf we deal only with formulas of the algebra of classes which are equations (i.e., which have the form A = B), the above description by reference to the functional calculus may be replaced by a simpler description using the applied propositional calculus (§ 1) whose fundamental proposittonal symbols are xε∨, xε∧, xεa, xεb, xεc, . . . . Given an equation, C of the algebra of classes, the corresponding formula C† of the propositional calculus is obtained by replacing equality ( = ) by the biconditional ( ≡ ), replacing complementation, logical sum, and logical product respectively by negation, inclusive disjunction, and conjunction, and at the same time replacing ∨, ∧, a, b, c, . . . respectively by xε∨, xε∧, xεa, xεb, xεc, . . . . An equation C is a theorem of the algbera of classes if and only if the inference from xε∨, ∼xε∧ to C† is a valid inference of the propositional calculus; analogously for valid inferences of the algebra of classes in which the formulas involved are equations.\n\nAs a corollary of this, every theorem of the pure propositional calculus (§ 1) of the form A ≡ B has a corresponding theorem of the algebra of classes obtained by replacing the principal occurrence of ≡ by =, elsewhere replacing negation, inclusive disjunction, and conjunction respectively by complementation, logical sum, and logical product, and at the same time replacing propositional variables by class variables. Likewise, every theorem A of the pure propositional calculus has a corresponding theorem B = ∨ of the algebra of classes, where B is obtained from A by replacing negation, inclusive disjunction, and conjunction respectively by complementation, logical sum, and logical product, and replacing propositional variables by class variables.\n\nThe dual of a formula or an expression of the algebra of classes is obtained by interchanging logical sum and logical product, and at the same time interchanging ∨ and ∧. The principle of duality holds, that the dual of every theorem is also a theorem.\n\nThe relation of class inclusion, ⊂, may be introduced by the definition:\n\nA ⊂ B → A ? −B = A.\n\nInstead of algebra of classes, the term Boolean algebra is used primarily when it is intended that the formal system shall remain uninterpreted or that interpretations other than that described above shall be admitted.
