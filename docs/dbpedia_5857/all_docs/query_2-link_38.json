        "text": "Pre-Teaching Magnet\n\nProgram Overview\n\nThe Pre-Teaching Magnet provides students with the opportunity to prepare for a career in urban education and earn college credits. Additionally, upon successful completion of the program, students will earn a Career and Technical Education seal from New York State on their diploma.\n\nStudents in the program will learn about and practice the unique skills required to be a successful educator in a diverse urban environment. They will develop an understanding of teaching and learning through hands-on lessons, work-based experiences, and specialized coursework. Completion of these requirements fulfills initial Early Childhood coursework towards an A.A.S. degree at Westchester Community College. The Early Childhood program at W.C.C. is designed to prepare competent and thoughtful professionals for a career in a variety of school settings. Opportunities include positions at childcare centers, Pre-Kindergarten, public schools K-2nd grade, Head Start, infant and toddler programs, nursery schools, and in family child day care. If students choose to pursue a New York State Teacher Certification, they can utilize the transfer program pathways that W.C.C. has with either Lehman College or Mercy College.\n\nWelcome to Foundations of Early Childhood Education.\n\nCourse Description\n\nThis course examines the historical, philosophical, and cultural roots of the Early Childhood Education movement and its influences on contemporary practices. The course is designed to help students develop a set of beliefs that will enable them to create environments that nurture democracy and foster a sense of community. Opportunities for investigation are at the center of environments that are responsive to childrenâ€™s experiences. Consideration is given to the important role of families in education and the teacher/family relationship. Emphasis is placed on responding to the call for culturally and ethnically sensitive teaching practices within the full range of human differences. Students will engage in fieldwork experience in a Montessori classroom. Students will continue to develop the components of a working portfolio to be ready for publication upon the completion of the program.\n\nWelcome to Introduction to Education.\n\nThis is a college preparatory course in which we will study Montessori philosophy and ideology and pedagogy and practicum. We will work on developing skills for college readiness as well as engaging in developing leadership, organization, and communication skills. We will work on community building skills and engage in community service. We will engage in a study of diversity and equity in education and in society.\n\nAssignments will be posted in Schoology and will be submitted in Schoology. Students may send me messages in Schoology or e-mail me at sgovernali@yonkerspublicschools.org with any questions or concerns.\n\nParents should ask their children for their Schoology log in information, log in and read posted assignments, announcements, and messages. Parents are encouraged to communicate with me by sending me e-mail at sgovernali@yonkerspublicschools.org. Additionally, I encourage parents to download the Schoology App and the Power School App on their cell phone if they have one. This will give you access to communicate with me and to check assignments and submissions from any location.\n\nI am very excited about the year ahead. I look forward to meeting you and this great learning experience that lies before us. I am so glad we are on this journey together. At YMA we are \"Better Together\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nMs. Governali"
