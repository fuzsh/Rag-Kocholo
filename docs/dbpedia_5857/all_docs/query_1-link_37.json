Hostos, Eugenia Maria de [1839-1903]. Hunt, A[lbert]. F[rancis]., Jr. [1872-1947], Translator.

Hostos was an educator, writer, activist and one of Latin America's first sociologists. After studying law and philosophy at the Complutense University of Madrid, he became a vigorous advocate for Puerto Rican and Cuban independence and an anti-slavery and anti-colonial activist. He also made immense contributions to educational philosophy and pedagogy throughout his career. Lecciones de Derecho Constitucional is a collection of lectures given by Hostos on constitutional theory. The lectures discuss the development and implementation of constitutional law around the world. In his discussion of the United States, he references The Federalist, Story's Commentaries on the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Hunt graduated from New York University Law School in 1898 and opened a law practice, Hunt & Ingle, in the city after graduation. By 1906, he was living in Puerto Rico, but had returned to Massachusetts by 1935. He was an avowed admirer of Hostos, whom he described as \"a political philosopher who lived before his time, but whose timeless ideas are sadly needad [sic] by the world today\" in an article commemorating the centenary of Hostos's birth. He is described in the article's byline as a jurist and the translator of two other works by Hostos (Moral Social and Sociologia). As far as we can tell, none of Hunt's translations were pu.\n\nPrice: $3,000.00\n\nBook number 79438"
