        "text": "Chinese Poets: English Translations\n\nThese are modern English translations of poems by some of the greatest Chinese poets of all time, including Du Fu, Huang E, Huang O, Li Bai, Li Ching-jau, Li Qingzhao, Po Chu-I, Tzu Yeh, Yau Ywe-Hwa and Xu Zhimo.\n\nLines from Laolao Ting Pavilion\n\nby Li Bai aka Li Po (701-762)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe spring breeze knows partings are bitter;\n\nThe willow twig knows it will never be green again.\n\nA Toast to Uncle Yun\n\nby Li Bai aka Li Po (701-762)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWater reforms, though we slice it with our swords;\n\nSorrow returns, though we drown it with our wine.\n\nQuiet Night Thoughts\n\nby Li Bai aka Li Po (701-762)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nMoonlight illuminates my bed\n\nas frost brightens the ground.\n\nLifting my eyes, the moon allures.\n\nLowering my eyes, I long for home.\n\nZazen on Ching-t'ing Mountain\n\nby Li Bai\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nNow the birds have deserted the sky\n\nand the last cloud slips down the drains.\n\nWe sit together, the mountain and I,\n\nuntil only the mountain remains.\n\nFarewell to a Friend\n\nby Li Bai\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nRolling hills rim the northern border;\n\nwhite waves lap the eastern riverbank...\n\nHere you set out like a windblown wisp of grass,\n\nfloating across fields, growing smaller and smaller.\n\nYou've longed to travel like the rootless clouds,\n\nyet our friendship declines to wane with the sun.\n\nThus let it remain, our insoluble bond,\n\neven as we wave goodbye till you vanish.\n\nMy horse neighs, as if unconvinced.\n\nLi Bai (701-762) was a romantic figure called the Lord Byron of Chinese poetry. He and his friend Du Fu (712-770) were the leading poets of the Tang Dynasty era, the Golden Age of Chinese poetry. Li Bai is also known as Li Po, Li Pai, Li T'ai-po, and Li T'ai-pai.

Burch\n\nAlone in your bedchamber\n\nyou gaze out at the Fu-Chou moon.\n\nHere, so distant, I think of our children,\n\ntoo young to understand what keeps me away\n\nor to remember Ch'ang-an...\n\nA perfumed mist, your hair's damp ringlets!\n\nIn the moonlight, your arms' exquisite jade!\n\nOh, when can we meet again within your bed's drawn curtains,\n\nand let the heat dry our tears?\n\nMoonlit Night\n\nby Du Fu (712-770)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nTonight the Fu-Chou moon\n\nwatches your lonely bedroom.\n\nHere, so distant, I think of our children,\n\ntoo young to understand what keeps me away\n\nor to remember Ch'ang-an...\n\nBy now your hair will be damp from your bath\n\nand fall in perfumed ringlets;\n\nyour jade-white arms so exquisite in the moonlight!\n\nOh, when can we meet again within those drawn curtains,\n\nand let the heat dry our tears?\n\nLone Wild Goose\n\nby Du Fu (712-770)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe abandoned goose refuses food and drink;\n\nhe cries querulously for his companions.\n\nWho feels kinship for that strange wraith\n\nas he vanishes eerily into the heavens?\n\nYou watch it as it disappears;\n\nits plaintive calls cut through you.\n\nThe indignant crows ignore you both:\n\nthe bickering, bantering multitudes.\n\nDu Fu (712-770) is also known as Tu Fu. The first poem is addressed to the poet's wife, who had fled war with their children. Ch'ang-an is an ironic pun because it means 'Long-peace.'\n\nThe Red Cockatoo\n\nby Po Chu-I (772-846)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nA marvelous gift from Annam—\n\na red cockatoo,\n\nbright as peach blossom,\n\nfluent in men's language.\n\nSo they did what they always do\n\nto the erudite and eloquent:\n\nthey created a thick-barred cage\n\nand shut it up.\n\nPo Chu-I (772-846) is best known today for his ballads and satirical poems. Po Chu-I believed poetry should be accessible to commoners and is noted for his simple diction and natural style. His name has been rendered various ways in English: Po Chu-I, Po Chü-i, Bo Juyi and Bai Juyi.\n\n'Lu Zhai' ('Deer Park')\n\nby Wang Wei (699-759)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nUninhabited hills...\n\nexcept that now and again the silence is broken\n\nby something like the sound of distant voices\n\nas the sun's sinking rays illuminate lichens...\n\nThe Migrant Songbird\n\nLi Qingzhao aka Li Ching-chao (c.1084-1155)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe migrant songbird on the nearby yew\n\nbrings tears to my eyes with her melodious trills;\n\nthis fresh downpour reminds me of similar spills:\n\nanother spring gone, and still no word from you...\n\nThe Plum Blossoms\n\nLi Qingzhao aka Li Ching-chao (c.1084-1155)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThis year with the end of autumn\n\nI find my reflection graying at the edges.\n\nNow evening gales hammer these ledges...\n\nwhat shall become of the plum blossoms?\n\nLi Qingzhao was a poet and essayist during the Song dynasty. She is generally considered to be one of the greatest Chinese poets. In English she is known as Li Qingzhao, Li Ching-chao and The Householder of Yi'an.\n\nStar Gauge\n\nSui Hui (c.351-394 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nSo much lost so far away\n\non that distant rutted road.\n\nThat distant rutted road\n\nwounds me to the heart.\n\nGrief coupled with longing,\n\nso much lost so far away.\n\nGrief coupled with longing\n\nwounds me to the heart.\n\nThis house without its master;\n\nthe bed curtains shimmer, gossamer veils.\n\nThe bed curtains shimmer, gossamer veils,\n\nand you are not here.\n\nSuch loneliness! My adorned face\n\nlacks the mirror's clarity.\n\nI see by the mirror's clarity\n\nmy Lord is not here. Such loneliness!\n\nSui Hui, also known as Su Hui and Lady Su, appears to be the first female Chinese poet of note. And her 'Star Gauge' or 'Sphere Map' may be the most impressive poem written in any language to this day, in terms of complexity. 'Star Gauge' has been described as a palindrome or 'reversible' poem, but it goes far beyond that. According to contemporary sources, the original poem was shuttle-woven on brocade, in a circle, so that it could be read in multiple directions. Due to its shape the poem is also called Xuanji Tu ('Picture of the Turning Sphere') . The poem is now generally placed in a grid or matrix so that the Chinese characters can be read horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The story behind the poem is that Sui Hui's husband, Dou Tao, the governor of Qinzhou, was exiled to the desert. When leaving his wife, Dou swore to remain faithful. However, after arriving at his new post, he took a concubine. Lady Su then composed a circular poem, wove it into a piece of silk embroidery, and sent it to him. Upon receiving the masterwork, he repented. It has been claimed that there are up to 7,940 ways to read the poem. My translation above is just one of many possible readings of a portion of the poem.\n\nReflection\n\nXu Hui (627-650)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nConfronting the morning she faces her mirror;\n\nHer makeup done at last, she paces back and forth awhile.\n\nIt would take vast mountains of gold to earn one contemptuous smile,\n\nSo why would she answer a man's summons?\n\nDue to the similarities in names, it seems possible that Sui Hui and Xu Hui were the same poet, with some of her poems being discovered later, or that poems written later by other poets were attributed to her.\n\nWaves\n\nZhai Yongming (1955-)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe waves manhandle me like a midwife pounding my back relentlessly,\n\nand so the world abuses my body—\n\naccosting me, bewildering me, according me a certain ecstasy...\n\nMonologue\n\nZhai Yongming (1955-)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI am a wild thought, born of the abyss\n\nand—only incidentally—of you. The earth and sky\n\ncombine in me—their concubine—they consolidate in my body.\n\nI am an ordinary embryo, encased in pale, watery flesh,\n\nand yet in the sunlight I dazzle and amaze you.\n\nI am the gentlest, the most understanding of women.\n\nYet I long for winter, the interminable black night, drawn out to my heart's bleakest limit.\n\nWhen you leave, my pain makes me want to vomit my heart up through my mouth—\n\nto destroy you through love—where's the taboo in that?\n\nThe sun rises for the rest of the world, but only for you do I focus the hostile tenderness of my body.\n\nI have my ways.\n\nA chorus of cries rises. The sea screams in my blood but who remembers me?\n\nWhat is life?\n\nZhai Yongming is a contemporary Chinese poet, born in Chengdu in 1955. She was one of the instigators and prime movers of the 'Black Tornado' of women's poetry that swept China in 1986-1989. Since then Zhai has been regarded as one of China's most prominent poets.\n\nPyre\n\nGuan Daosheng (1262-1319)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nYou and I share so much desire:\n\nthis love―like a fire—\n\nthat ends in a pyre's\n\ncharred coffin.\n\n'Married Love' or 'You and I' or 'The Song of You and Me'\n\nGuan Daosheng (1262-1319)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nYou and I shared a love that burned like fire:\n\ntwo lumps of clay in the shape of Desire\n\nmolded into twin figures. We two.\n\nMe and you.\n\nIn life we slept beneath a single quilt,\n\nso in death, why any guilt?\n\nLet the skeptics keep scoffing:\n\nit's best to share a single coffin.\n\nGuan Daosheng (1262-1319) is also known as Kuan Tao-Sheng, Guan Zhongji and Lady Zhongji. A famous poet of the early Yuan dynasty, she has also been called 'the most famous female painter and calligrapher in the Chinese history... remembered not only as a talented woman, but also as a prominent figure in the history of bamboo painting.' She is best known today for her images of nature and her tendency to inscribe short poems on her paintings.\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI heard my love was going to Yang-chou\n\nSo I accompanied him as far as Ch'u-shan.\n\nFor just a moment as he held me in his arms\n\nI thought the swirling river ceased flowing and time stood still.\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWill I ever hike up my dress for you again?\n\nWill my pillow ever caress your arresting face?\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nNight descends...\n\nI let my silken hair spill down my shoulders as I part my thighs over my lover.\n\nTell me, is there any part of me not worthy of being loved?\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI will wear my robe loose, not bothering with a belt;\n\nI will stand with my unpainted face at the reckless window;\n\nIf my petticoat insists on fluttering about, shamelessly,\n\nI'll blame it on the unruly wind!\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen he returns to my embrace,\n\nI'll make him feel what no one has ever felt before:\n\nMe absorbing him like water\n\nPoured into a wet clay jar.\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nBare branches tremble in a sudden breeze.\n\nNight deepens.\n\nMy lover loves me,\n\nAnd I am pleased that my body's beauty pleases him.\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nDo you not see\n\nthat we\n\nhave become like branches of a single tree?\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI could not sleep with the full moon haunting my bed!\n\nI thought I heard―here, there, everywhere―\n\ndisembodied voices calling my name!\n\nHelplessly I cried 'Yes! ' to the phantom air!\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI have brought my pillow to the windowsill\n\nso come play with me, tease me, as in the past...\n\nOr, with so much resentment and so few kisses,\n\nhow much longer can love last?\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nWhen she approached you on the bustling street, how could you say no?\n\nBut your disdain for me is nothing new.\n\nSqueaking hinges grow silent on an unused door\n\nwhere no one enters anymore.\n\nTzu Yeh (circa 400 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI remain constant as the Northern Star\n\nwhile you rush about like the fickle sun:\n\nrising in the East, drooping in the West.\n\nTzŭ-Yeh (or Tzu Yeh) was a courtesan of the Jin dynasty era (c.400 BC) also known as Lady Night or Lady Midnight. Her poems were pinyin ('midnight songs') . Tzŭ-Yeh was apparently a 'sing-song' girl, perhaps similar to a geisha trained to entertain men with music and poetry. She has also been called a 'wine shop girl' and even a professional concubine! Whoever she was, it seems likely that Rihaku (Li-Po) was influenced by the lovely, touching (and often very sexy) poems of the 'sing-song' girl. Centuries later, Arthur Waley was one of her translators and admirers. Waley and Ezra Pound knew each other, and it seems likely that they got together to compare notes at Pound's soirees, since Pound was also an admirer and translator of Chinese poetry. Pound's most famous translation is his take on Li-Po's 'The River Merchant's Wife: A Letter.' If the ancient 'sing-song' girl influenced Li-Po and Pound, she was thus an influence―perhaps an important influence―on English Modernism. The first Tzŭ-Yeh poem makes me think that she was, indeed, a direct influence on Li-Po and Ezra Pound.―Michael R. Burch\n\nThe Day after the Rain\n\nLin Huiyin (1904-1955)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nI love the day after the rain\n\nand the meadow's green expanses!\n\nMy heart endlessly rises with wind,\n\ngusts with wind...\n\naway the new-mown grasses and the fallen leaves...\n\naway the clouds like smoke...\n\nvanishing like smoke...\n\nMusic Heard Late at Night\n\nLin Huiyin (1904-1955)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nfor Xu Zhimo\n\nI blushed,\n\nhearing the lovely nocturnal tune.\n\nThe music touched my heart;\n\nI embraced its sadness, but how to respond?\n\nThe pattern of life was established eons ago:\n\nso pale are the people's imaginations!\n\nPerhaps one day You and I\n\ncan play the chords of hope together.\n\nIt must be your fingers gently playing\n\nlate at night, matching my sorrow.\n\nLin Huiyin (1904-1955) , also known as Phyllis Lin and Lin Whei-yin, was a Chinese architect, historian, novelist and poet. Xu Zhimo died in a plane crash in 1931, allegedly flying to meet Lin Huiyin.\n\nSaying Goodbye to Cambridge Again\n\nXu Zhimo (1897-1931)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nQuietly I take my leave,\n\nas quietly as I came;\n\nquietly I wave good-bye\n\nto the sky's dying flame.\n\nThe riverside's willows\n\nlike lithe, sunlit brides\n\nreflected in the waves\n\nmove my heart's tides.\n\nWeeds moored in dark sludge\n\nsway here, free of need,\n\nin the Cam's gentle wake...\n\nO, to be a waterweed!\n\nBeneath shady elms\n\na nebulous rainbow\n\ncrumples and reforms\n\nin the soft ebb and flow.\n\nSeek a dream? Pole upstream\n\nto where grass is greener;\n\nrig the boat with starlight;\n\nsing aloud of love's splendor!\n\nBut how can I sing\n\nwhen my song is farewell?\n\nEven the crickets are silent.\n\nAnd who should I tell?\n\nSo quietly I take my leave,\n\nas quietly as I came;\n\ngently I flick my sleeves...\n\nnot a wisp will remain.\n\n(6 November 1928)\n\nXu Zhimo's most famous poem is this one about leaving Cambridge. English titles for the poem include 'On Leaving Cambridge, ' 'Second Farewell to Cambridge, ' 'Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again, ' and 'Taking Leave of Cambridge Again.'\n\nThese are my modern English translations of poems by the Chinese poet Huang E (1498-1569) , also known as Huang Xiumei. She has been called the most outstanding female poet of the Ming Dynasty, and her husband its most outstanding male poet. Were they poetry's first power couple? Her father Huang Ke was a high-ranking official of the Ming court and she married Yang Shen, the prominent son of Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe. Unfortunately for the young power couple, Yang Shen was exiled by the emperor early in their marriage and they lived largely apart for 30 years. During their long separations they would send each other poems which may belong to a genre of Chinese poetry I have dubbed 'sorrows of the wild geese' …\n\nSent to My Husband\n\nby Huang E\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe wild geese never fly beyond Hengyang...\n\nhow then can my brocaded words reach Yongchang?\n\nLike wilted willow flowers I am ill-fated indeed;\n\nin that far-off foreign land you feel similar despair.\n\n'Oh, to go home, to go home! ' you implore the calendar.\n\n'Oh, if only it would rain, if only it would rain! ' I complain to the heavens.\n\nOne hears hopeful rumors that you might soon be freed...\n\nbut when will the Golden Cock rise in Yelang?\n\nA star called the Golden Cock was a symbol of amnesty to the ancient Chinese. Yongchang was a hot, humid region of Yunnan to the south of Hengyang, and was presumably too hot and too far to the south for geese to fly there.\n\nLuo Jiang's Second Complaint\n\nby Huang E\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe green hills vanished,\n\npedestrians passed by\n\ndisappearing beyond curves.\n\nThe geese grew silent, the horseshoes timid.\n\nWinter is the most annoying season!\n\nA lone goose vanished into the heavens,\n\nthe trees whispered conspiracies in Pingwu,\n\nand people huddling behind buildings shivered.\n\nBitter Rain, an Aria of the Yellow Oriole\n\nby Huang E\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThese ceaseless rains make the spring shiver:\n\neven the flowers and trees look cold!\n\nThe roads turn to mud;\n\nthe river's eyes are tired and weep into in a few bays;\n\nthe mountain clouds accumulate like dirty dishes,\n\nand the end of the world seems imminent, if jejune.\n\nI find it impossible to send books:\n\nthe geese are ruthless and refuse to fly south to Yunnan!\n\nBroken-Hearted Poem\n\nby Huang E\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nMy tears cascade into the inkwell;\n\nmy broken heart remains at a loss for words;\n\never since we held hands and said farewell,\n\nI have been too listless to paint my eyebrows;\n\nno medicine can cure my night-sweats,\n\nno wealth repurchase our lost youth;\n\nand how can I persuade that damned bird singing in the far hills\n\nto tell a traveler south of the Yangtze to return home?\n\nThe Shijing or Shi Jing ('Book of Songs' or 'Book of Odes') is the oldest Chinese poetry collection, with the poems included believed to date from around 1200 BC to 600 BC. According to tradition the poems were selected and edited by Confucius himself. Since most ancient poetry did not rhyme, these may be the world's oldest extant rhyming poems. While the identities and sexes of the poets are not known, the title of this ancient poem may mean 'Aunt' and thus suggest that it was possibly written by an aunt for a relative.\n\nShijing Ode #4: 'JIU MU'\n\nancient Chinese rhyming poem (c.1200-600 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIn the South, beneath trees with drooping branches\n\nthick with vines that make them shady,\n\nwe find a lovely princely lady:\n\nMay she repose in happiness!\n\nIn the South, beneath trees with drooping branches\n\nwhose clinging vines make hot days shady,\n\nwe wish warm embraces for a lovely lady:\n\nMay she repose in happiness!\n\nIn the South, beneath trees with drooping branches\n\nwhose vines entwining make them shady,\n\nwe wish true love for a lovely lady:\n\nMay she repose in happiness!\n\nShijing Ode #6: 'TAO YAO'\n\nancient Chinese rhyming poem circa (1200 BC - 600 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nThe peach tree is elegant and tender;\n\nits flowers are fragrant, and bright.\n\nA young lady now enters her future home\n\nand will manage it well, day and night.\n\nThe peach tree is elegant and tender;\n\nits fruits are abundant, and sweet.\n\nA young lady now enters her future home\n\nand will make it welcome to everyone she greets.\n\nThe peach tree is elegant and tender;\n\nit shelters with bough, leaf and flower.\n\nA young lady now enters her future home\n\nand will make it her family's bower.\n\nShijing Ode #9: 'HAN GUANG'\n\nancient Chinese rhyming poem circa (1200 BC - 600 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nIn the South tall trees without branches\n\noffer men no shelter.\n\nBy the Han the girls loiter,\n\nbut it's vain to entice them.\n\nFor the breadth of the Han\n\ncannot be swum\n\nand the length of the Jiang\n\nrequires more than a raft.\n\nWhen cords of firewood are needed,\n\nI would cut down tall thorns to bring them more.\n\nThose girls on their way to their future homes?\n\nI would feed their horses.\n\nBut the breadth of the Han\n\ncannot be swum\n\nand the length of the Jiang\n\nrequires more than a raft.\n\nWhen cords of firewood are needed,\n\nI would cut down tall trees to bring them more.\n\nThose girls on their way to their future homes?\n\nI would feed their colts.\n\nBut the breadth of the Han\n\ncannot be swum\n\nand the length of the Jiang\n\nrequires more than a raft.\n\nThe nest is the magpie's\n\nbut the dove occupies it.\n\nA young lady's soon heading to her future home;\n\na hundred carriages will attend her.\n\nThe nest is the magpie's\n\nbut the dove takes it over.\n\nA young lady's soon heading to her future home;\n\na hundred carriages will escort her.\n\nThe nest is the magpie's\n\nbut the dove possesses it.\n\nA young lady's soon heading to her future home;\n\na hundred carriages complete her procession.\n\nBy raised banks of the Ru,\n\nI cut down branches in the brake.\n\nNot seeing my lord\n\ncaused me heartache.\n\nBy raised banks of the Ru,\n\nI cut down branches by the tide.\n\nWhen I saw my lord at last,\n\nhe did not cast me aside.\n\nThe bream flashes its red tail;\n\nthe royal court's a blazing fire.\n\nThough it be set aflame,\n\nstill his loved ones are near...\n\nIt was apparently believed that the bream's tail turned red when it was in danger. Here the term 'lord' does not necessarily mean the man in question was a royal himself. Chinese women of that era often called their husbands 'lord.' Take, for instance, Ezra Pound's famous loose translation 'The River Merchant's Wife.' Speaking of Pound, I borrowed the word 'brake' from his translation of this poem, although I worked primarily from more accurate translations. In the final line, it may be that the wife or lover is suggesting that no matter what happens, the man in question will have a place to go, or perhaps she is urging him to return regardless. The original poem had 'mother and father' rather than 'family' or 'loved ones, ' but in those days young married couples often lived with the husband's parents. So a suggestion to return to his parents could be a suggestion to return to his wife as well.\n\nChixiao ('The Owl')\n\nby Duke Zhou (c.1100-1000 BC)\n\nloose translation/interpretation by Michael R. Burch\n\nOwl!\n\nYou've stolen my offspring,\n\nDon't shatter my nest!\n\nWhen with labors of love\n\nI nurtured my fledglings.\n\nBefore the skies darkened\n\nAnd the dark rains fell,\n\nI gathered mulberry twigs\n\nTo thatch my nest,\n\nYet scoundrels now dare\n\nImpugn my enterprise.\n\nWith fingers chafed rough\n\nBy the reeds I plucked\n\nAnd the straw I threshed,\n\nI now write these words,\n\nToo hoarse to speak:\n\nI am homeless!\n\nMy wings are withered,\n\nMy tail torn away,\n\nMy home toppled\n\nAnd tossed into the rain,\n\nMy cry a distressed peep.\n\nThe Duke of Zhou (circa 1100-1000 BC) , a member of the Zhou Dynasty also known as Ji Dan, played a major role in Chinese history and culture. He has been called 'probably the first real person to step over the threshold of myth into Chinese history' and he may be the first Chinese poet we know by name today, and the spiritual ancestor of Confucius as well. The Duke was a capable and loyal regent for his young nephew King Cheng and successfully suppressed a number of rebellions. He has also been credited with writing the I Ching and the Book of Songs, also called the Book of Odes, and with creating yayue ('elegant music') which became Chinese classical music. His poem 'The Owl' was apparently written while he was away fighting on his nephew's behalf, after court dissenters accused him of plotting to usurp the throne. Apparently the poem worked, as King Cheng welcomed his uncle back, and the Duke remained faithful till the end.
