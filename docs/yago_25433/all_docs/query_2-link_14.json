        "text": "During Weitzman’s 2024 Commencement Ceremony, the School plans to confer a long-overdue posthumous Bachelor of Architecture degree upon Lin Huiyin, widely regarded as the first and most renowned female architect in modern China.\n\nMuch like her contemporaries, including Liang Sicheng, a gifted Chinese student who later became her husband and longstanding collaborator, Lin arrived at Penn in 1924 to study under Paul Philippe Cret, the esteemed professor of design leading the school’s Beaux Arts-based architecture program.\n\nTo mark this significant milestone in Penn's history, a panel discussion will take place in the Kleinman Energy Forum. This event will feature a conversation with distinguished experts in Chinese architecture, combining academic insights with a celebratory reception.\n\nThis event will be open to the broader Penn community during Alumni Weekend. While attending the event is free of charge, attendees must register at the Alumni Weekend registration link.\n\nHors d’oeuvres and refreshments will be served."
