        "text": "My client Cengage Learning has just published three English language titles authored by the “Father of Modern Chinese Architecture” Liang Sicheng.\n\nWith covers designed by yours truly.\n\nThe books are part of a series of books on Chinese architecture. The three are Art and Artefacts, The Temple of Buddha’s Light and Chinese Sculpture: A Historical Journey.\n\nAbout the author: Liang Sicheng (梁思成, 1901-1972) is a pioneer in the study of Chinese architecture using Western methodology. He studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and taught architecture at Northwestern University and Tsinghua University. He is the son of Liang Qichou (梁啟超, 1873-1929) , a prominent Chinese scholar, writer and political reformist whose call for change in Chinese society during the twilight years of Qing dynasty was highly influential.\n\nBoth father and son lived fascinating lives and represent the league of high-achieving intellectuals who shaped modern China.\n\nLiang Sicheng and his first wife Lin Huiyin (1904-1955), an accomplished and steadfast collaborator, led ambitious, Indiana Jones-type efforts to catalogue ancient China’s architectural legacies during late 1920s and 30s.\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, both suffered severe persecution and were forced to admit their “mistakes”. Their stories do not have a happy ending. See the politically-correct CCTV documetary on the couple on YouTube.\n\nBut the value of their work was never in doubt. Through the decades, Liang’s books were standard reference among Chinese architecture students and historians.\n\nToday, Liang Sicheng is as relevant as ever. The three new titles by Cengage will aquaint a new generation of students and historians with the man and his ideas.\n\nAbout the cover design: I wanted to update the packaging, with a new look that signals a fresh reincarnation. What should the design reflect?\n\nHere are some early visuals.\n\nAnd the final covers chosen by publisher.\n\nAsk me if you are looking for a publication designer!\n\n•••"
