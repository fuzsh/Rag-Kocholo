        "text": "A new exhibition opened at the Changjiang Art Museum in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, on Saturday, marking the 120th anniversary of the birth of Lin Huiyin, a revered 20th-century Chinese architect and writer.\n\nTitled the Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin Academic Literature Exhibition, it features nearly 400 items including manuscripts, drawings, sketches, survey drafts, archives and certificates, showcasing the remarkable academic careers of the two noted architects and scholars.\n\nLiang Sicheng (1901-72) and Lin Huiyin (1904-55) are legendary figures in Chinese architecture. They made outstanding and pioneering contributions to various fields, such as cultural heritage preservation, urban planning, architectural design and architectural education.\n\nAnother theme of the exhibition is the couple's architectural survey journeys in Shanxi, a crucial base for their studies of ancient Chinese architecture. They made several trips to Shanxi, investigating numerous classical masterpieces in Chinese architectural history, such as the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, the Wooden Pagoda in Yingxian county and the Foguang Temple in Wutai Mountain.\n\nThe exhibition will run through Oct 7."
