By month’s end, Amtrak plans to begin rehabilitating the Pelham Bay Bridge, which is located along the Northeast Corridor in the Bronx, N.Y.

Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), the $10 million project calls for strengthening and repairing the more than 100-year-old bridge’s piers, piles, abutments and foundations that support the tracks, transmission lines and catenary wires.

To be completed by October 2010, the project will make the bridge more reliable and reduce maintenance on the structure, Amtrak officials said in a prepared statement. The bridge accommodates 43 passenger trains and two freight trains each weekday, and opens about 10 times daily for marine traffic.

Amtrak is undertaking other projects to maintain and improve its New York-area infrastructure, including repairs to six additional bridges on the Empire Line, and painting and maintenance work on the Bronx Kill Bridge along the Northeast Corridor.

Meanwhile, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is launching its own ARRA-funded project. The agency plans to expand parking facilities at the Elwyn station.

To be completed in summer 2010, the $900,000 project calls for expanding the current parking lot’s capacity from 233 to more than 300 parking spaces. The project involves concrete, grading, signage, electrical and paving work.
