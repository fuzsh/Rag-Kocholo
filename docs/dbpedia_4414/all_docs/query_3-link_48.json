        "text": "The Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) will conduct a virtual public information meeting concerning the replacement of the bridge carrying Groton Long Point Road over Amtrak Railroad in Groton on Monday, May 13, 2024, at 7:00 p.m.\n\nThe virtual public information meeting is being held to provide the public and local community the opportunity to offer comments or ask questions regarding the proposed project. The meeting will take place on Zoom, and registration is required. A question and answer (Q&A) session will immediately follow the presentation, which will be recorded. For instructions on accessing the meeting and ways to provide comments and ask questions, please visit https://portal.ct.gov/DOTGroton58-342\n\n“This project will address the existing structural deficiencies and the substandard minimum vertical clearance of the bridge traveling over Amtrak Railroad” said Connecticut Department of Transportation Project Manager Francisco T. Fadul. “We encourage the public to attend this meeting to share their feedback with the CTDOT project team to incorporate into the design.”\n\nRight-of-way impacts associated with the proposed project to the Amtrak Railroad Right-of-Way are anticipated.\n\nConstruction is anticipated to begin in fall 2026 based on the availability of funding, acquisition of rights of way, and approval of permit(s). The estimated construction cost for this project is approximately $13.8 million.\n\nIndividuals with limited internet access can listen to the meeting by calling (877) 853-5257 and enter Meeting ID 816 3839 4637.
