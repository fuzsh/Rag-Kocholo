The viaduct, which is commonly known as the Stone Arch Bridge, was built in 1846 for the Connecticut River Railroad.\n\nThe majority of the work was performed during a scheduled five-day service outage that commenced on September 7, 2018.\n\nFurther information\n\n“Crews Finish Bridge Rehabilitation in Massachusetts”\n\nBy Cindy Riley | Construction Equipment Guide | November 7, 2018\n\nStone Arch Bridge Bernardston, MA\n\nNHRHTA New Haven RR Forum | September 17, 2018\n\nThis post includes additional images from the project\n\nHolyoke | Repairs to Pioneer Valley Railroad Bridge (2018)\n\nThe Pioneer Valley Railroad and its contractors have rehabilitated a curved open deck bridge in Holyoke near South Canal and Cabot street. The bridge, which is shown in the images above, carries a section of the PVRR over a canal in Holyoke. Steel and masonry work performed on the structure.\n\nThe re-opening of this bridge, which was last used in 2013, will allow the Pioneer Valley Railroad to interchange freight rail cars with the Pan Am Southern railroad which operates the north-south rail line through Holyoke.\n\nThis work was partially funded by a grant of $495,000 that was made by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The grant was one of eight grant awards made in 2017 under MassDOT’s Industrial Rail Access Program.\n\nTree and Brush clearing along the Conn River Main Line (2018)\n\nMassDOT’s contractors clearing brush and trees along the right of way on the Connecticut River Main Line.\n\nNorthampton | Repair of Bridges at Mileposts 16.67 and 19.90 (2019)\n\nThis project involved the repair and rehabilitation of two railroad bridges in Northampton, MA.\n\nGreenfield & Northampton | Extension of the station platforms (2018 – 2019)\n\nThis project extended the existing high-level station platforms in Greenfield and Northampton to a length of 146 feet.\n\nAn expanded station platform will allow for two pairs of passenger car doors to be opened on the platform, which would basically double the speed of boarding (and deboarding) passengers at these station.\n\nFurther reading\n\nGreenfield platform extension project\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nNorthampton platform extension project\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nKnowledge Corridor Tie Replacement Project (2019)\n\nThis project called for tie replacements, track refurbishment and related work along 32 miles of the Connecticut River Main Line (CRML).\n\nThe project included the follow elements:\n\nInstallation up to 30,000 new wood railroad ties\n\nInstallation of 3.5 track miles of new continuous welded rail on the controlled sidings in Northampton and Springfield and on the southbound track in Deerfield\n\nConstruction of 0.4 miles of new southbound track in Deerfield\n\nDistribution of 28,500 tons of track ballast\n\nSurface, align and regulate the ballast along 32 miles of CRML track, including all turnouts that branch off the mainline track\n\nRemove and reconstruct five farm crossings along the line\n\nRemove & dispose of all scrap crossties, timbers, and wood debris\n\nProgress images\n\nTie Replacement on Bridges at Milepost 34.82 & 34.95 (2019)\n\nThe project involved the replacement of ties on two Connecticut River Main Line (CRML) bridges;\n\nBridge at MP 34.82 [visible in the background in the image above] which carries the CRML over the Deerfield River\n\nBridge at MP 34.95 [visible in the foreground in the image] which carries the CRML over the Pan Am Southern Fitchburg Main line.\n\nPart of this project included the re-installation of the 2nd mainline track on both bridges.\n\nFurther reading\n\n“Deerfield, Greenfield railroad bridges slated for repairs”\n\nBy Dan Desrochers | The Recorder | April 30, 2018\n\nCheapside Railroad Bridge (PDF)\n\nInventory No. DEE.905\n\nMassachusetts Cultural Resource Information System\n\nSpringfield | Union Station, Platform C (2016-2020)\n\nThe project added a 362-foot high-level platform at Springfield Union Station.\n\nFurther reading\n\nSpringfield Union Station | Platform C Project\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nSpringfield | Bike/pedestrian underpass (2019–2021)\n\nThe project provided for a pedestrian route (an underpass) under the railroad tracks to provide a safe pedestrian connection between the Brightwood and North End neighborhoods in Springfield — more specifically between the Chestnut Middle School area in Brightwood and the Birnie Avenue/Main Street area in the North End.\n\nFurther reading\n\nSpringfield underpass project\n\nTrains In The Valley\n\nCWR Installation and Maintenance (2022–2024)\n\nThis project includes the installation of up to two track miles of continuously welded rail (CWR) on the controlled passing siding in Northampton, Mass. on the MassDOT-owned Connecticut River Main Line.\n\nThe project also includes thermite field welding at various locations along the rail corridor.\n\nThis siding, which is the track on the right in the image above, runs from a point just south of the bike underpass to the crossing at Highway Auto Salvage.\n\nConn River Main Line Bridge Work | MP 3.60 & MP 7.97\n\nThis project was for the repair and rehabilitation of two existing steel railroad bridges on the Connecticut River Main Line, in the cities of Chicopee and Holyoke.\n\nThe bridge at milepost (MP) 3.60, which carriers the railroad line over Depot Street in Chicopee, is a 25-foot long single span open deck bridge.\n\nThe bridge at MP 7.97 — which carries the railroad line over the Second Level Canal and Lyman street in Holyoke — is a 336-foot long 3-span open deck bridge.\n\nThis bridge was built in 1928 by the Boston Bridge Works. The inventory record, which can be found on the link below, indicates that the bridge replaced an iron lattice truss bridge that was built on the site in 1887.\n\nFurther reading\n\nB & M Railroad Bridge over Lyman Street\n\nMassachusetts Cultural Resource Informati\n\nFreight projects\n\nNECR Freight Corridor Upgrade (2021–2023)\n\nIn February 2021 the MassDOT Board of Directors approved funding to support a project to upgrade the 55-mile New England Central Railroad (NECR) corridor in Massachusetts that runs between Monson, Palmer and Northfield.\n\nThe project, which is managed by NECR, is funded roughly 1/3rd by NECR, 1/3rd by MassDOT, and 1/3 by the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\nThe project includes the replacement of 22.7 miles of jointed rail with continuously welded rail, the installation of 30,000 wood ties, the replacement of 30 turnouts, the installation of 25,000 tons of new stone ballast, the alignment and surfacing of 54.7 miles of track, and bridge deck repairs on 16 structures.\n\nThe project will increase the maximum allowable gross weight for freight cars moved on this NECR line from from 263,000 lbs to current national standard which is 286,000 lbs.\n\nFurther reading\n\nClosing the Gap in New England Western Massachusetts Freight Railroad Upgrade Project (PDF)\n\nMassDOT Board Presentation\n\nVermont Projects of Note\n\nSee also\n\nEast-West Rail in Massachusetts\n\nInfrastructure | Current Projects\n\nMassDOT Capital Investment Plan"
