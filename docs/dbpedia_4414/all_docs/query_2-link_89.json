        "text": "The Bx23 and Q50 bus routes constitute a public transit corridor in New York City, running from the Flushing neighborhood in Queens to the Pelham Bay and Co-op Cityneighborhoods in the Bronx. The Bx23 provides local service in Pelham Bay and Co-op City, while the Q50 provides limited-stop service between Co-op City and subway hubs in Pelham Bay and Flushing. Both routes are city-operated under the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations, and are the only two local routes in the Bronx to operate under the MTA Bus brand, rather than under the MaBSOTA brand that all other Bronx bus routes operate under.\n\nThe two routes are the successor to the QBx1/ route, privately operated by the Queens Surface Corporation until 2005, when the route was taken over by the MTA. This route ran several confusing service patterns between Co-op City and Pelham Bay, with only select runs continuing to Flushing. In September 2010, the QBx1 was split into the Bx23 and Q50 to simplify service in the Bronx, and provide full-time service between Queens and the Bronx.\n\nRoute description and service[]\n\nFormer QBx1[]\n\nBx23 buses running in 5-4-3-2-1 (top) and 1-2-3-4-5 (bottom) service patterns at adjacent stops near the Pelham Bay Park station\n\nThe original QBx1 service began at the Flushing–Main Street subway station in Downtown Flushing, Queens (within a section of Flushing also known as Flushing Chinatown). It ran north on Main Street to Northern Boulevard, then east to Linden Place. It then ran north on Linden Place to the Whitestone Expressway, sharing the street with the Q25 and Q34. The QBx1 proceeded north on the Whitestone Expressway service road and then onto the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge crossing into the Bronx, and then onto the Hutchinson River Parkway service road to Lafayette Avenue. This portion of the route across the bridge to Bruckner Boulevard was shared with the Q44, the only other local bus between the Bronx and Queens. At the Bruckner Interchange, the QBx1 turned onto Bruckner Boulevard (the Bruckner Expressway service road), traveling east then north to the Pelham Bay Park station. This section is shared with the Bx5. Only selected buses ran between Flushing and Pelham Bay; most QBx1 runs remained in the Bronx.\n\nNorth of Pelham Bay Park, the QBx1 ran several different services to different parts of Co-op City. The full route circumscribed the entire development, running (clockwise) north along the New England Thruway service road to Bartow Avenue (near the current Bay Plaza Shopping Center), through Section 1, via the Dreiser Loop, through Sections 2 and 3, via the Asch Loop in Section 4, and through Section 5 before returning to Pelham Bay. This pattern operated clockwise (sections 1-2-3-4-5) or counterclockwise (sections 5-4-3-2-1). The full Flushing−Co-op City service either ran clockwise from Flushing or counterclockwise to Flushing.\n\nThe QBx1 operated a total of ten service patterns, varying on the time of day. During weekday off-peak hours and weekends, the route operated either between Flushing and all five sections of Co-op City, or as a circulatory shuttle service between Pelham Bay and the five sections. During the AM peak a total of five service patterns were used. The three primary AM patterns were Pelham Bay to Bellamy Loop, serving Section 3 via sections 1-2-3; Pelham Bay to Asch Loop, serving Section 4 only; and Pelham Bay running clockwise via Bartow Avenue, serving Sections 4 and 5 before returning to Pelham Bay. The intermittent service to and from Flushing ran via the Bellamy Loop route. The three PM peak hour services were Flushing to Pelham Bay and Bellamy Loop; Pelham Bay to Bellamy Loop; and Pelham Bay running counterclockwise to Sections 5 and 4, Asch Loop, and back to Pelham Bay. While this structure provided direct service to individual sections of Co-op City, the structure was considered confusing and inconvenient due to the many different service patterns under one route designation, and the lack of service between Queens and the Bronx.\n\nThe following table shows the variants of the QBx1:\n\nVariant Flushing Pelham Bay Park (Template:Abbr) Section 1 Section 2 Section 3 Section 4 Section 5 Pelham Bay Park (Template:Abbr) Off-peak Off-peak AM peak AM peak colspan=3 Template:N/A AM peak → colspan=4 Template:N/A → AM peak colspan=2 Template:N/A AM peak PM peak colspan=2 Template:N/A PM peak PM peak ← colspan=3 Skipped ←\n\nCurrent bus service[]\n\nThe Bx23 constitutes a simplified version of the former QBx1 route between Pelham Bay Park and Co-op City, running either clockwise (1-2-3-4-5) or counterclockwise (5-4-3-2-1) before returning to Pelham Bay. The Q50, meanwhile, runs between Co-op City and Flushing via Pelham Bay, with its northern terminal at Erskine Place and Earhart Lane in Section 5. Q50 buses travel clockwise in Co-op City northbound, and counterclockwise southbound. The Q50 also employs limited-stop service, making fewer stops in Queens and bypassing the individual loops of Co-op City served by the Bx23. The routes run at all times except late nights; at these times, Co-op City service is replaced by the Bx28, while there is no direct Co-op City-to-Queens service.\n\nAt Pelham Bay Park, both directions of Bx23 and Q50 service share three adjacent bus stops on the southbound Bruckner Boulevard to the south of the subway station. The southernmost stop at the intersection of Bruckner and Amendola Place is used by Flushing-bound Q50 service. The middle stop is used by all clockwise Co-Op City service (Q50s to Section 5 and Bx23s via 1-2-3-4-5). The northernmost stop is used by Bx23s operating the counterclockwise loop. Because of this setup, Bronx-bound Q50 buses must U-turn at Westchester Avenue to stop at Pelham Bay, then U-turn again towards Co-op City.\n\nPrior to 2014, the Bx23 employed additional service patterns during rush hours, similar to its predecessor route. Buses would travel via 1-2-3-4 (AM rush) or 4-3-2-1 (PM rush) and return to Pelham Bay, or directly to Section 5 via Bartow Avenue/Bay Plaza/Section 4 (clockwise AM; counterclockwise PM) and return to Pelham Bay. This was eliminated to maintain one consistent service pattern at all times, and allow service between all sections of Co-op City at all times.\n\nThe Bx23 and Q50 are two of the several local bus routes to serve Co-op City, which is heavily dependent on bus service. They are among five routes (along with the Bx5 on weekends, Bx12 SBS, and Bx29) to feed into Pelham Bay Park station from the neighborhood, and the only two to serve all five sections of the development (except for the late night Bx28 service).\n\nHistory[]\n\nTwo former Queens Surface buses on the QBx1 under MTA operations before (left) and after (right) repainting into MTA colors. Both buses have since been retired.\n\nThe QBx1 was in operation since at least the mid-1960s under the Queens Transit Corporation, labeled the \"Bx1\" on Queens bus maps. The route originally operated between Flushing and Pelham Bay Park. By 1968, the QBx1 was extended to Co-op City. The bus company would become Queens-Steinway Transit Corporation in 1986, and Queens Surface Corporation in 1988.\n\nOn February 27, 2005, the MTA Bus Company took over the operations of the Queens Surface routes as part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes.\n\nIn 2009, ten buses from the Eastchester Depot near Co-op City (the former New York Bus Service depot) began to operate on QBx1 service. Two additional stops in the Bronx were added to the route in June 2010, at Baisley Avenue (southbound) and Kearny Avenue (northbound) both at Bruckner Boulevard, to connect with a pedestrian overpass to the Country Club neighborhood.\n\nQBx1 split[]\n\nOn September 12, 2010, the QBx1 was split into the Q50 Limited and Bx23 routes, simplifying the many service patterns of the former QBx1 route, but eliminating direct service between Pelham Bay and the individual sections of Co-op City. In addition, the changes were made in conjunction with controversial cuts in service to other Co-op City routes during the MTA's 2010 budget crisis, and received negative input from the community.\n\nOn June 29, 2014, the rush hour service pattern of the Bx23 was eliminated, with the off-peak pattern going into effect at all times. In addition, a stop on the Bx23 was added at Adler Place in the Asch Loop. A stop for the Q50 was also added outside the Dreiser Loop. These changes were the result of a study of bus routes in Co-op City.\n\nBus redesigns[]\n\nAs part of the MTA's 2017 Fast Forward Plan to speed up mass transit service, a draft plan for a reorganization of Bronx bus routes was proposed in draft format in June 2019, with a final version published in October 2019. The draft plan called for the Bx23 to be the sole route serving Co-op City; many of the draft proposals were not included in the final version. These changes were set to take effect in mid-2020.The final Bronx bus plan did not modify the Bx23's routing or stop locations, though the frequency of the route was to be increased.Additionally, in December 2019, the MTA released a draft redesign of the Queens bus network. As part of the redesign, the Q50 would have become the QT50, extended to LaGuardia Airport; the northern section in Co-op City would have been truncated.\n\nBoth redesigns were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020. The original Queens draft plan was dropped due to negative feedback, while the implementation of the Bronx redesign was postponed to mid-2022. A revised Queens draft plan was released in March 2022. The plan for the Q50 is similar to that in the 2019 redesign and would still serve LaGuardia Airport.\n\nBike racks[]\n\nIn April 1994, bike racks were installed onto QBx1 buses to carry bicycles over the Whitestone Bridge. This was the first bike-on-bus program in the city. The service was offered on a seasonal basis (April to September), with pick-up/drop-off points at 20th Avenue in Whitestone, Queens and Lafayette Avenue near Ferry Point Park in the Bronx. However, the bike-on-bus program was eliminated on February 27, 2005, the same day as the MTA takeover.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that bike racks would be installed on the fronts of Bx23 and Q50 buses by spring 2018. Each rack, mounted on the front of each bus, would be able to carry two bicycles. This was part of the MTA's ongoing pilot program to mount bike racks on several bus routes. In September 2015, the S53 and S93 routes in Staten Islandhad been the first routes to receive the racks. The expanded program restored bike racks on the Flushing to Co-op City bus corridor for the first time since 2005. On July 1, 2018, bike rack service was inaugurated on the Bx23 and Q50 routes."
