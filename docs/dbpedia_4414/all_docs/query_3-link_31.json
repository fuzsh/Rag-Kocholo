        "text": "Overview\n\nMetra is replacing the bridge that carries the Milwaukee District North Line over Milwaukee Avenue near Kilbourne Avenue with a new bridge with new abutments. Grayland Station, just south of the bridge, is being rebuilt with longer platforms, new public address equipment, visual information signs, shelters with on-demand heat on each side, new lighting and new stairs and ramps, making it fully ADA-compliant.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe new bridge will improve operations and reliability by reducing delays associated with slow zones, track closures or trains canceled for maintenance and repair work on the existing bridge. Replacing the aging bridge is critical because it provides a vital link in the regional and national rail network. If it were to be taken out of service, there would be no viable alternate route. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the bridge was used by 61 Metra trains, 17 Amtrak trains and several Canadian Pacific and Wisconsin Southern freight trains each weekday.\n\nThe improvements to the Grayland Station include longer platforms, new public address equipment, visual information signs, shelters with on-demand heat on each side, new lighting and new stairs and ramps, making it fully ADA-compliant. A temporary Grayland Station, south of the current station, is being used to continue service to the area during the project.\n\nProgress\n\nAs of late June 2024, the project is 80% complete. The new bridge and precast retaining walls are complete and the ramps, stairs, and foundations for the new inbound station are complete.\n\nThe railroad tracks have been shifted to their final location on the new bridge and removal of the temporary bridge is complete. The street, bike lanes, and sidewalk are currently being restored in order to reopen Milwaukee Avenue. Additional work to be performed after restoration of Milwaukee Avenue includes removal of temporary retaining walls, restoration of the slopes along Kilbourn, and construction of the inbound warming shelter and new outbound station.\n\nMilwaukee Avenue will remain closed at Kilbourn Avenue until late July 2024. The road was expected to be open by the end of December 2023 but permitting delays and unforeseen ground obstructions that were encountered will push back the reopening until late July.\n\nSigns for the vehicular and bicycle detours will remain in place until the road reopens. Southeast-bound vehicular traffic on Milwaukee Avenue is rerouted south on Cicero Avenue and east on Addison Street back to Milwaukee Avenue. Northwest-bound traffic is diverted west on Addison and north on Cicero to Milwaukee.\n\nBicycle and pedestrian traffic are rerouted along Addison Street and Kilbourn Avenue, and protected bike lanes are in place on Addison during the closure.\n\nFunding\n\nThe project is being funded with $15 million from the Federal Transit Administration, $17.8 million from the Federal Railroad Administration, $2.3 million from Canadian Pacific, and $2.9 million in other Metra funding.\n\nTimeline\n\nConstruction, which is being done by IHC Construction Companies of Elgin, began in 2021 and is expected to be complete at the end of 2024. Work on the Grayland Station will continue to Spring 2025."
