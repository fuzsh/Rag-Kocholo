        "text": "What destination in Hartford is more compelling than the destinations in New Haven to someone in Providence? What compelling destination is there in Providence for someone in Hartford? One that makes them want to drive versus taking an HSR train to Worcester and changing trains. Unless they have access to a helicopter flying isn’t an option. People in Boston won’t care because they’ll be able to get on a train that goes through Worcester and Springfield to get to Hartford.\n\nSeveral hundred years of history, the seat of government power in each respective state, Hartford has Bushnell Park, the Mark Twain House, the Wadsworth Atheneum, is being artificially depressed by how cut off it is from the east and west and has far greater growth potential than New Haven does; Providence has already grown to be the third-largest city in the region and is only going to keep growing no matter what happens.\n\nMontreal is going to be the least popular destination for New England. Crossing the border depresses demand. There are more people within HSR range going west to Cleveland. Going west to Cleveland makes it possible to get to the 9 million people in the urban sprawl between Niagara Falls and Toronto. Compared to the 3.8 million in metro Montreal.\n\n9 million people who we’re picking up anyway because NYC – Toronto is the New York State HSR routing and they really don’t need New England’s help to get it done. The only part of this that affects New England is making sure that an HSR connection is built between Boston and Albany and that doesn’t need to instruct the creation of the HSR route between Boston and NYC.\n\nNew England to Cleveland is going to be popular,. According to Expedia there are two non-stops a day from Hartford and three from Boston. None from Providence. All of the other options take almost as long as “twice as fast as driving” because they involve a hub airport along the way.\n\nIf we’re using non-stop flights as the metric by which we determine whether or not HSR trips to anywhere are going to be successful, then HSR to Montreal (with five daily nonstops from BOS and three more from BDL) will be a little bit under twice as successful as HSR to Cleveland.\n\nAdd in an hour to get from the curb to the time the door on the plane closes and HSR looks very very good for someone in New England who wants to go to Cleveland. Just like it looks very very good for someone in New England who wants to go to Scranton, Harrisburg, Lynchburg or Richmond. And all the points in between.\n\nThe few people who want to go between Hartford and Providence need something that’s faster than driving. They get that with Providence-Worcester-Springfield-Hartford.\n\nNo they don’t, they need something that’s better than driving. Cars aren’t going to be banned any time soon, and so people need to be attracted to rail travel because it’s providing them something better than taking their cars.\n\nProvidence to Worcester is probably 40 minutes (maybe 35), Worcester – Springfield – Hartford is probably another 35 minutes (maybe 30), milling around in Worcester waiting for the HSR train is best-case-scenario a five minute connection but potentially as much as another 15 minutes. The best case scenario is 20 minutes faster than the 90 minute drive, and the worst case scenario is a wash – but once the last mile* enters the picture, “even more transferring around on the local network” versus “the same amount of time (or slightly less) spent driving and I don’t have to worry about the last mile* between rail and where I’m going, and I don’t have to deal with a transfer in Worcester…”\n\nWell, suddenly, the train looks a lot less attractive. People will keep driving.\n\nBy the way, eliminate the transfer and they’ll probably take the train even if it ends up being slower than driving. Of course… it makes far more sense to start this project as HSR even if it doesn’t end up as an HSR corridor.\n\n1. We can disagree about my argument without resorting to juvenile name-calling, thanks.\n\n2. That you mostly built upon an argument that was made eighteen months ago doesn’t make it any less wrong, and that you’re falling back on “but someone else proposed it first” isn’t doing a whole hell of a lot with regards to inspiring confidence in it. (Also, the argument you’re building upon is one that I’ve come to disagree vehemently with in the eighteen months between then and now. I am, in fact, capable of changing my position when exposed to new information.)\n\nMy original complaint about road and rail sharing easements remains valid because my original complaint was that roads in this country (I don’t know about Germany or Europe or Japan) typically aren’t and weren’t engineered with future additions in mind because the earliest interstates got built in an era where we could roll over anyone and anything in our way and the government was too strong to be scared of some uppity activists who didn’t like what they were doing – and the interstates built in later times were built in the context of the revolts that resulted, built where the most expedient routing often had to be forgone because of little things like neighborhood activism or environmental protection and it was no longer easy or cheap to just grab what we needed and worry about expansion later. As a result, there are a lot of places where development runs right up against the boundaries of the freeway (and only in precious few places is there any kind of reserved buffer space) and a lot of places where the road is engineered to the minimum possible compliance with highway safety standards – which, as you may or may not know, happen to be lower then international best standards for rail.\n\nDoes that mean that you can never, ever, ever add an easement onto any part of what’s there today? No, of course it doesn’t. This can work in plenty of places – there’s no technical obstacle to expanding I-95 in the wilds of eastern Connecticut whether that’s for more lanes or HSR tracks; there’s plenty of freeway mileage in the region and in the nation built to a standard that can technically support both road and rail and where there’s little to no development “in the way” of such expansions.\n\nBut, again, there’s also lots of places where this can’t work. Some of those places, it can’t work because the terrain or activists or surrounding communities or any number of mitigating circumstances ended up interfering with our ability to alter the landscape and pave wide flat straightaways – leaving us with roads like I-84 between Hartford and Danbury. Other places, it can’t work because we either didn’t depress property values around the freeway enough or living/building near a freeway became attractive enough that active development sprung up around the freeway – creating roads like I-95 in Stamford and Greenwich, where there’s no technical barrier to adding to the existing ROW but there are plenty of political and legal barriers to simply ignoring the reality that there’s not enough empty space in the shadows of the roadway to build a whole lot of anything and therefore you must start destroying before you can create. You didn’t address that at all, not even to say “I don’t think the surrounding landowners are going to pose a problem.”\n\nFor the record, I do. And having read some of your other postings on your blog, I think you’re heavily underestimating the ability and motivation of “the neighbors” to mobilize against you in a lot of places, not just here.\n\n3. You followed the route I “recommended” as the shortest route-mileage for a non-stop train between Boston and New York, which is a terrible idea on the merits of bypassing everyone between Boston and New York and represents the logical conclusion of treating HSR like surface-running airplanes. I haven’t actually outlined a route for Providence – Hartford in this comment chain yet.\n\n4. Providence – Hartford can be done incrementally, actually. Most of the legacy ROW for a medium-speed regional rail is intact as various trails or greenways. Phases 1 and 2 are building medium-speed (could conceivably support average speeds of 90 MPH) regional rail in Rhode Island to Coventry and in Connecticut between Hartford and Willimantic via Storrs (UConn), and these can happen in either order or at the same time, Phase 3 is connecting Willimantic to Coventry via Danielson with a high-speed ROW and forming a complete medium-speed ROW between Providence and Hartford (and you know what? This is all I really want. If we get this far on an incremental build-out and then the whole thing gets shitcanned in favor of starting over along I-95, I’ll still be happy), Phase 4 is building a high-speed bypass of the regional Hartford-Manchester-Storrs-Willimantic ROW by using I-384 (if extended to Willimantic) or a combination of I-384 and a greenfield alignment (if it isn’t extended), and Phase 5 is either straightening and retrofitting the Providence-Warwick-Coventry ROW as needed for 185+ MPH operation or building a bypass via the existing US-6 ROW east of 295 and a greenfield ROW west of it to connect Providence to the existing high-speed ROW from Phase 3 in Danielson.\n\nEvery single one of those five phases can stand on its own merits and leaves us with something of inherent value even if the subsequent phases are canceled. Unlike your plan, it also provides us with something we wouldn’t have otherwise – a brand new direct routing through central RI and central CT, which doesn’t parallel anything already in existence. It’s brand new. “New” is sexy. “New” captures the hearts and minds of the public that we need to support these kinds of projects in a way that “incremental improvements” does not.\n\nAnd here’s where I think the argument that you and others are making falls apart, because it relies on two assumptions that I believe are bullshit:\n\n#1) That the attitudes expressed by the majority of people within the echo chamber universe of transit advocacy blogs are instructive of the attitudes held by the majority of average people in this country. They’re not, really. Average people don’t spend nearly as much time on the small details as we do. They don’t decide to drive or fly instead because their HSR train follows a route that’s six or nine or even twelve minutes slower than it could have been (if only for…) The average person, at least in this country, cares far more about sweeping reforms and grand plans and big ideas. Those are exciting, and get talked about, and drum up far more support and opposition from the general public than small steps or incremental improvements do. That’s why the Amtrak Vision generates massive buzz every time they release some new iteration or version of it and why the release of their infrastructure master plan goes unnoticed by everyone except for people like us.\n\nUnfortunately, this leads into the other big assumption that I think is false…\n\n#2) That the project we’re most feasibly going to get funded is the lowest-cost-possible project. My opinion, at least, is that this mentality is informed strongly by the current political climate, which prides “fiscal prudence” even when that turns out to be an oxymoron and cost-shaving attempts end up creating unmitigated disasters like East Side Access and is all to eager to “stop waste” even when the amount of money being “wasted” is trivial in comparison to the cost of the waste-fighting measures. Fortunately, this political climate is not likely to exist forever – which is a good thing, because this is also a political climate in which infrastructure projects either don’t get approved at all, or get run through the wringer of fictional “cost saving” and compromising and other means of value reduction and then get approved in a state where we truly would have been better off doing nothing (see: the billion dollar Hartford busway, the MBTA’s “Silver Line” bus routes). Realistically, neither of our plans, none of Alon’s suggestions, nothing anyone has proposed in our own little corner of the universe stands a chance of getting done in this political environment and nothing is likely going to be done until the political climate changes. We can help with that by fighting for Big Projects, Big Ideas, coming out with things that are exciting for the average person and drumming up a great deal of support for forward progress. “Incremental improvements” don’t do that – all they really do is get shot down and shut down by other groups that don’t represent the attitudes or best interests of most people (i.e., the anti-spending crowd, the anti-transit crowd.)\n\nYou’re welcome to think I’m wrong. We clearly have very different opinions."
