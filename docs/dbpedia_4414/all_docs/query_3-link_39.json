        "text": "Key Takeaway: America’s freight rail infrastructure is safe and is recognized as the best infrastructure in America by the ASCE. Adhering to the mantra “a well-run railroad is a safe railroad,” the industry’s commitment to robust investment and technological modernization make tracks, bridges, tunnels, rail cars and locomotives safer and operations more efficient.\n\nEvery four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers — the nation’s oldest engineering society — provides a comprehensive infrastructure assessment of America’s infrastructure using a simple A to F school report card format. The highly-respected ASCE Infrastructure Report Card examines the condition, needs and recommendations for 17 major categories of infrastructure, including rail. For the last two report cards, rail has received the highest grade thanks in part to freight rail’s massive annual investments.\n\nData show a direct correlation between increased investment in the rail network and enhanced safety performance; since 2000, America’s Class I railroads have spent $439 billion on network maintenance and capital expenditures, while the track-caused and equipment-caused accident rates have dropped by 50% and 31%.\n\nPart of these safety gains is due to investments in the development and deployment of new inspection technologies — from track-side detectors to ultrasound, machine imaging, big data and drones — designed to monitor infrastructure and equipment health. Railroads use these tools to increase both the frequency and accuracy of inspections — often above and beyond federal regulatory requirements — while the resulting data informs proactive maintenance plans. Thanks to these and other efforts, America’s freight rail network is largely regarded as the safest, most efficient rail network in the world."
