        "text": "There's a new report out from the Northeast Corridor advisory commission, established by Congress to help improve the most critical stretch of rail in the United States, and it isn't pretty.

It's effectively a construction wish list for 2016-2020:\n\nThat bit about \"adequate funding\" is the sticking point. Over the plan's five-year period, the amount of money available to realize these infrastructure projects declines, even as the total needs grow:"
