        "text": "By Julie Sneider, Senior Editor\n\nPresident Joe Biden last week announced the award of $16.4 billion for 25 passenger-rail projects along the Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Boston and Washington, D.C. The funding was issued through the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program to advance many long-planned Amtrak-related projects that fall under the Gateway Program, which Biden and the U.S. Department of Transportation believe is necessary step toward creating “world-class passenger rail” in the United States.\n\nWhile all 25 projects are designed to improve infrastructure for passenger rail, several projects that will receive those federal dollars will also benefit freight-rail operations through the NEC.\n\nListed by state are the projects that received federal dollars last week — and those that will benefit freight-rail service. The information comes from the Federal Railroad Administration’s fact sheets for each project.\n\nConnecticut\n\n• Connecticut River Bridge Replacement, $826.6 million. The project calls for replacing the Amtrak-owned 116-year-old bridge between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme with a movable bridge just south of the existing structure. The oldest movable bridge between New Haven, Connecticut and Boston “poses a risk of long-term, major disruption on [the NEC] due to its age and condition,” according to the FRA. The structure serves the NEC main line and is used by Amtrak’s intercity services, the Connecticut Shore Line East commuter service and freight operators. The new bridge would maintain the two-track configuration and existing channel location, provide a bascule movable span with additional vertical clearance for maritime traffic, improve safety and reliability, and increase operating speed (from 45 mph to 70 mph) for all operators. Amtrak will provide $148.4 million in matching funds, and the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CTDOT) will provide $58.3 million. Construction is expected to be completed by September 2029.\n\nAmtrak\n\n• Walk Bridge Replacement, $465 million. The project calls for constructing a replacement for the 127-year-old, four-track, four-span, movable bridge over the Norwalk River in Norwalk. The bridge is used by Amtrak, Metro-North and freight trains. The new multi-span structure will include 240-foot dual lift spans over the waterway and fixed east and west approach. In addition, the project scope covers embankment work and retaining walls, high tower removal, transmission line rerouting, a new fender system, and track and rail systems work. Replacing the bridge will reduce the risk of bridge malfunction; improve traffic flow during track outages thanks to new multiple movable spans; improve marine traffic navigation on the river; and enable higher speeds (from 30 mph to 45 mph) on the new bridge and adjacent track segments. Construction is expected to be completed in January 2030. CTDOT will provide $87.2 million in matching funds, and Amtrak, $29.1 million.\n\n• Devon Bridge Replacement, $245.9 million. The award will fund the project development and final design for replacing the 118-year-old, four-track Devon River Bridge connecting Stratford and Milford. Amtrak, MTA Metro-North Railroad and freight trains use that bridge. The new structure will eliminate the existing “risk of long-term disruption and daily reliability challenges”; enable higher operating speed for Amtrak and Metro-North trains (from 40 mph to 70 mph); and reduce bridge failures that occur during the opening and closing of the structure, according to the FRA. Construction is anticipated to begin in October 2030 and wrap up in August 2036. CTDOT will provide $45.5 million in matching funds and Amtrak will provide $16 million.\n\n• Devon Bridge Interim Repairs, $119.3 million. The project includes project development, final design and construction for interim repairs to keep the 118-year-old bridge connecting Stratford and Milford operating safely and reliably. Repairs will focus on structural components weakened by fatigue and age and mechanical and electrical parts used to open and close the bridge. The scope of repairs is intended to extend the bridge’s useful life until the full replacement of the structure. CTDOT will provide $22.1 million in matching funds and Amtrak will provide $7.8 million.\n\n• Hartford Line Rail Program Double Track, Phase 3B, $104.9 million. The project involves track, signals and grade crossing improvements in three segments totaling 6.2 miles of the Hartford Line between New Haven, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts. Work will focus on segments in West Hartford-Hartford, Windsor-Windsor Locks and Enfield to add double-track and expand rail capacity, allowing for more frequent future service. Amtrak’s intercity services use the route along with CTrail’s Hartford Line service and freight operators. CTDOT will provide $41.9 million in matching funds.\n\n• Saugatuck River Bridge Replacement, $23.2 million. The federal dollars will go toward developing a project to replace the 118-year-old, 485-foot, four-track, movable bascule bridge over the Saugatuck River Bridge. This part of the project calls for preparing environmental review documents and preliminary engineering stages. Ultimately, the new bridge will benefit Amtrak’s intercity services, Metro-North commuter services and freight railroads. The project also will result in higher operating speeds (from 45 mph to 90 mph) on the replacement bridge and adjacent track segments. Construction is expected to begin in January 2030 and conclude in October 2033. Matching funds for this grant will be provided by CTDOT ($4.2 million) and Amtrak ($1.6 million).\n\n• New Haven Line Network Infrastructure, $15.4 million. The federal funding will cover project development, final design and construction to replace and upgrade fiber optic communication cables and network infrastructure at 60 locations along the New Haven Line. The project will benefit Amtrak intercity, Metro-North commuter and freight-rail services. The project funds the completion of the fourth and final phase of upgrades to network infrastructure along the New Haven Line. CTDOT will provide $2.7 million in matching funds, and Amtrak, $1.1 million.\n\nMaryland\n\n• Bush River Bridge Replacement, $18.8 million. This funding will cover planning and project development to replace the 110-year-old, two-track, movable Bush River Bridge in Harford County with high-level fixed structures with four tracks. The project will include signal, interlocking and electric traction upgrades. Benefitting from the project are Amtrak, MARC Penn Line service and freight trains. A new elevated bridge will enable marine traffic to pass without the need to open the structure; expand bridge capacity; improve resilience; and enable higher operating speeds (over 125 mph) over the structure and on adjacent track segments. Construction is expected to last from October 2028 to September 2034. Matching funds will be provided by Amtrak at $3.7 million, and the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)/Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) at $980,000.\n\n• Gunpowder River Bridge Replacement Program, $30 million. This funding will go toward development activities to replace the 110-year-old, two-track Gunpowder River Bridge near Chase with a four-track structure. The project also will replace or upgrade associated signals, interlockings and electric traction power infrastructure. Replacing the structure will reduce train delays by minimizing unscheduled bridge maintenance and enable train speeds of over 125 mph on the new bridge. The project will benefit Amtrak, MARC Penn Line service and freight trains. Construction is expected to begin in October 2028 and conclude in September 2036. Providing matching funds are Amtrak, $5.9 million; and MDOT/MTA, $1.6 million.\n\n• Susquehanna River Bridge Replacement Program, $2 million. This project includes final design and construction for two fixed, two-track bridges over the Susquehanna River between Havre De Grace and Perryville. They will replace the existing 117-year-old, two-track bridge now used by Amtrak, MARC commuter and freight trains. The new spans will enable trains to travel faster than the current 90-mph speed limit, with one span designed for 125-mph and the other for up to 160-mph. As elevated structures, they also will improve marine traffic by eliminating the need to open and close the bridge. Construction is expected to start in October 2025 and conclude in October 2036. Amtrak and MDOT/MTA will provide $520.3 million in matching funds.\n\nNew York"
