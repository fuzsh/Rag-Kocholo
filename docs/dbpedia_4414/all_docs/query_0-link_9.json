The bridge accommodates 43 passenger trains and two freight trains each weekday, and opens about 10 times daily for marine traffic.\n\nAmtrak is undertaking other projects to maintain and improve its New York-area infrastructure, including repairs to six additional bridges on the Empire Line, and painting and maintenance work on the Bronx Kill Bridge along the Northeast Corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is launching its own ARRA-funded project. The agency plans to expand parking facilities at the Elwyn station.\n\nTo be completed in summer 2010, the $900,000 project calls for expanding the current parking lot’s capacity from 233 to more than 300 parking spaces. The project involves concrete, grading, signage, electrical and paving work.\n\nContact Progressive Railroading editorial staff.\n\nMore News from 11/20/2009"
