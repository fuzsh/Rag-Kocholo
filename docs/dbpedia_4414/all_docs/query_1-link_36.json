        "text": "The USA's Biden-Harris administration has awarded publicly-owned US rail operator Amtrak nearly ten billion dollars in Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) funding.\n\nAmtrak will use the money to modernise its infrastructure, improve stations and support increases in passenger numbers on the Northeast Corridor (NEC). Numbers are now consistently exceeding pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe grant awards form part of delivering the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's (IIJA) vision for bigger and better passenger rail. In September, the FRA awarded Amtrak nearly $200 million for improvements to the North East Corrider and Gulf Coast through its CRISI grant program.\n\nAmtrak has also applied for additional federal grant applications to improve Long Distance and State Supported services through the FRA's Corridor ID Program, and has separately applied for Fed-State Partnership Program funding for projects outside the NEC. It expects to hear decisions on those grant applications before the end of the year.\n\nThe North East Corridor is one of the busiest and most economically vital transportation systems in the world. It serves the Northeast's five major metropolitan regions – Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington.\n\nAround 2,200 Amtrak, commuter and freight trains operate over some portion of the route each day, carrying hundreds of thousands of people. Amtrak runs Acela, Northeast Regional, State Supported and Long Distance trains on the NEC, provides dispatching services and electric propulsion power , and maintains and improves the infrastructure and facilities used by Amtrak and others.\n\nThe new grants will support twelve Amtrak-led projects through the FRA's Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program (Fed-State NEC):\n\nFrederick Douglass Tunnel Program (up to $4.7b)\n\nSusquehanna River Rail Bridge Project (up to $2.08b)\n\nEast River Tunnel Rehabilitation Project (up to $1.26b)\n\nConnecticut River Bridge Replacement Project (up to $826.64m)\n\nDock Bridge Rehabilitation Project (up to $300.18m)\n\nSawtooth Bridges Replacement Project (up to $133.32m)\n\nBaltimore Penn Station Redevelopment (up to $108.32m)\n\nPelham Bay Bridge Replacement Project (up to $58.27m)\n\nGunpowder River Bridge Replacement Program (up to $30m)\n\nNEC South End Infrastructure Renewal and Speed Improvement Planning Study (up to $21.6m)\n\nBush River Bridge Replacement Program (up to $18.8m)\n\nNew Haven to Providence Capacity Planning Study (up to $4m)\n\nAnother thirteen NEC projects led by Amtrak's partners also received funding, including:\n\nHudson Tunnel Project – Gateway Development Commission (up to $3.79b)\n\nPenn Station Access – MTA (up to $1.64b)\n\nWalk Bridge Replacement Project – CTDOT (up to $465m)\n\nDevon Bridge Replacement Project – CTDOT (up to $245.92m)\n\nDelco Lead – NJ TRANSIT (up to $180.9m)\n\nNew Haven Line Power Improvement Program – CTDOT (up to $122.8m)\n\nDevon Bridge Interim Repairs – CTDOT (up to $119.32m)\n\nHartford Line Rail Program Double Track (Phase 3B) Project – CTDOT (up to $104.86m)\n\nNew Haven Line Track Improvement and Mobility Enhancement Part 1 and 3 – CTDOT (up to $71.64m)\n\nNewark Penn Station Vertical Circulation Improvements – NJ TRANSIT (up to $59.2m)\n\nReconstruction of Cornwells Heights Station – SEPTA (up to $30.5m)\n\nSaugatuck River Bridge Replacement – CTDOT (up to $23.2m)\n\nNew Haven Line Network Infrastructure Upgrade Project – CTDOT (up to $15.4m)\n\nAmtrak CEO Stephen Gardner said, “These grants will help advance Amtrak's plans to modernize the Northeast Corridor and unlock major bottlenecks on the busiest passenger rail corridor in America. I want to thank President Biden, USDOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FRA Administrator Amit Bose for their continued support as Amtrak and our partners rebuild this critical infrastructure asset.”\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said, “Under President Biden, we are finally delivering the generational investments in passenger rail that Americans have wanted for years, including modernizing the busiest rail corridor in the country. These investments will make our busiest passenger railroad safer, faster, and more reliable, which means fewer delays and shorter commutes for the 800,000 passengers who rely on the Northeast Corridor every day.”\n\n“President Biden's Investing in America agenda includes unprecedented investments in rail—investments that are already creating jobs, impacting communities, and laying the foundation for world-class passenger rail in America,” said FRA Administrator Amit Bose. “Today's $16.4 billion investment in projects of national significance is a massive step forward to do even more. Federal funding made possible by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will replace or repair vital Northeast Corridor infrastructure that has been in need of major upgrades for decades. Twenty-five projects in total will receive funding, and that means at least 800,000 daily riders will, in the future, experience fewer delays, faster service, and greater convenience on America's busiest rail corridor.”\n\nTrade union leaders welcomed the funding award. Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO President Greg Regan said, “We applaud the Biden-Harris Administration for continuing to usher in a new era of Amtrak passenger rail service. This historic $16.4 billion investment across 25 projects will employ high-skilled union laborers to replace aging tunnels and bridges, upgrade train stations, improve railroad tracks, and more. Together, we are modernizing Amtrak while improving safety and service for 800,000 daily riders who rely on the nation's busiest passenger rail corridor.”\n\nNorth America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) President Sean McGarvey added, “NABTU applauds Amtrak's continued support of building trades members through their work to rebuild vital rail projects up and down the Northeast Corridor, including the Hudson Tunnel Project.\n\n“When President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law, spurring a historic amount of public and private investment in America's crumbling infrastructure, that investment included $66 billion toward rail infrastructure. Thanks to great partners like Amtrak, we are maximizing this massive investment to strengthen America's rail infrastructure with local projects that uplift diverse middle class, family-sustaining career opportunities for building trades members across the Northeast.”\n\nRail Passengers Association President and CEO Jim Mathews added his support, saying that, “The Northeast Corridor is our nation's aorta, and these investments are long overdue. We were proud to be part of the process that brought the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to life, and we're grateful to see meaningful awards finally get made for the benefit of all passengers.”\n\nA large number of political figures also welcomed the announcement of the funding, many claiming a share of the credit for their efforts in campaigning for it.\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, “I fought to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Law with robust funding so that Amtrak could complete essential transportation projects that help move more passengers more efficiently, including for vital projects in New York like repairing the LIRR East River Tunnels and Pelham Bay Bridge in the Bronx. With the $1.3 billion for the East River Tunnels and the $56 million for the Pelham Bay Bridge, the future of New York mass transit is bright. The Sandy-damaged East River Tunnels will be repaired, and the Pelham Bay Bridge Replacement will become a vital part of the Penn Access project, which will also receive $1.6B in grants. Penn Access will give Westchester residents shorter commutes and build new stations to transit deserts in the Bronx. With this federal funding for Amtrak, the future of New York transit is brighter than ever.”\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said, “This massive, history-making rail money means faster train trips and more good-paying construction jobs for Connecticut. It will be strikingly visible and impactful in our everyday lives— replacing aged bridges, vastly enhancing safety and reliability, and promoting more on-time, affordable travel. It will empower a transportation transformation, bringing our rail system into the 21st century. Federal investment in our crumbling infrastructure is long overdue, and I'm thrilled that our delegation has fought hard and successfully for dollars Amtrak needs and deserves.”\n\nSenator Ben Cardin (D-MD) said, “Passenger rail is critical to Maryland's economic strengths, its quality of life and its role as a gateway on the East Coast. These historic investments in the capacity, efficiency and safety of our rail infrastructure will ensure that this infrastructure can serve the needs of generations to come. Thanks to the Biden administration's commitment to reinvigorating rail in America and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, this funding will advance projects that are clear priorities for Maryland, Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor. Team Maryland fought for these strategic investments and will continue to work together to ensure needed resources are delivered to our state.”\n\nSenator Tom Carper (D-DE) commented, “As an almost-daily traveler on Amtrak and a long-time supporter of passenger rail, I was proud to help secure an unprecedented investment for our nation's railways as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Passenger rail creates jobs, improves our air quality, eases congestion on our roadways, and keeps our nation competitive in the global economy. Thanks to President Biden's leadership, we are modernizing service along the Northeast Corridor, which is a win-win for Delaware and the millions of Americans who commute on Amtrak trains each year.”\n\nSenator Bob Casey (D-PA) said, “The infrastructure law continues to deliver results for Pennsylvanians. Thanks to the law, SEPTA will be able to keep commuters safe, help them reach their destinations more quickly, and ensure more riders, including those with disabilities, can access public transit. I led the effort to include accessible transit funding in the infrastructure law and I'll keep working to make transportation more accessible for all Pennsylvanians.”\n\nSenator Chris Coons (D-DE) commented, “As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and frequent Amtrak rider, I'm thrilled to see the Biden administration continuing to make substantive investments in Amtrak's infrastructure needs that that will improve the reliability, safety, and speed of Amtrak service on the Northeast Corridor. This investment will support good-paying jobs for Delawareans during construction and far into the future.”\n\nSenator John Fetterman (D-PA) added, “I applaud these awards that will modernize the rail lines across the region and expand economic opportunities for people throughout Pennsylvania. This federal funding is a significant investment in Pennsylvania's transit infrastructure that will help deliver the high-quality transit system that Pennsylvanians deserve.”\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said, “These critical modernization projects will greatly improve Amtrak service along the Northeast Corridor for countless passengers. I have long supported these efforts in New York, and I am thrilled to see these projects come to life, which will create billions of dollars in economic activity for the region. These funding awards will allow for a range of work to be done, including on the East River Tunnel project, the Penn Station Access project, the Hudson Tunnel project, and the Pelham Bay Bridge Replacement project. I am proud to have helped secure these awards, and I will continue to support Amtrak to upgrade the Northeast Corridor and ensure better service for passengers.”\n\nSenator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) commented, “The billions in federal funding announced today for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor is a major step forward in improving one of our nation's most important intercity and commuter passageways. This funding will help facilitate critical projects across the state, including billions of dollars for the new Hudson River tunnels and other projects under the Gateway program. I've stood at the forefront of the charge to modernize and expand public transit throughout the state, and these infrastructure projects are a necessary investment New Jerseyans across the state need to facilitate their daily commutes. Reducing delays, upgrading rail lines and improving general operations will create a public transportation system that residents can rely on. I look forward to continuing to work with all of our state, federal, and local partners to ensure these projects and others continue to receive the necessary federal funding to reach the finish line.”\n\nRepresentative Donald Payne, Jr. (D-NJ-10), Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials for the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, “I am thrilled to see Amtrak obtain the federal funding it needs to improve critical intercity rail programs along the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak is vital for commuters in communities throughout the Northeast Corridor and Amtrak has needed to invest in railcars, tracks and services for years. Today's announcement by the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak will make sure this important region will have more reliable and more environmentally-friendly rail systems in the future.”\n\nRepresentative Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ-12) commented, “The structural health, revitalization, and expansion of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor capacity is fundamental to the region's and the country's economic future. Millions of travelers and commuters rely on rail travel every year. The infrastructure investment commitment by the Biden Administration along with Amtrak's mission to insure safe and efficient travel will mean we'll continue to benefit from these investments for generations to come. Specifically, my home state of New Jersey has long been a commuter and transportation hub, and all who live and work in our great state should have access to reliable transportation and updated facilities that meet their needs. This investment is a necessary step towards a more equitable and efficient system that serves more of the hard working people of New Jersey.”\n\nRepresentative Joe Courtney (D-CT-02) said, “This long overdue transformational grant for the Connecticut River Bridge comes after a determination in 2006 that the bridge was ‘structurally deficient' and repair work was no longer capable of keeping it functional. Despite chronic underfunding of Amtrak's capital accounts, I have worked with my colleagues in the Connecticut delegation since 2007 to secure initial funding of $130.4 million for design and planning of this project.\n\nToday's announcement of an additional $826 million federal grant ensures that the entire construction phase will be fully funded, and not delayed any more by incremental piecemeal grants. This development will provide a stable horizon for contractors to acquire materials and workforce and is a testament to the importance of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed in 2021 that provided a historic level of resources to Amtrak. Make no mistake – this monumental investment was only possible because of this law. When this new bridge is finished, rail traffic will be safer and faster for passengers on the Northeast Corridor-Acela Express, Northeast Regional, and Shoreline East, as well as freight traffic. It is a generational investment for the most heavily traveled rail system in America that will pay dividends for decades to come.”\n\nRepresentative Adriano Espaillat (D-NY-13) said, “I commend the Biden Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation on today's announcement of new federal funding to the Northeast Corridor to repair and replace bridges and tunnels across the region,” said Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “Further strengthening our Federal-State collaboration will benefit our railway system for generations to come through a series of upgrades that will help reduce delays and increase train speeds for passengers along the Northeast Corridor. Thanks to the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, today marks the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak at $66 billion and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring the Northeast Corridor is finally on track to be rebuilt to meet the needs of 21st century travelers.”\n\nRepresentative Dwight Evans (D-PA-03), added “Thanks to the leadership of President Biden, more infrastructure investments are coming to PA! Amtrak has agreed to match $5.4 million worth of funds to not only improve intercity services but also increase speeds and reduce travel times.\n\nRepresentative Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA-01) said, “Intercity passenger rail and regional public transportation connect Bucks and Montgomery Counties to one another, the Commonwealth, and the entire Northeast region. Today's grant announcement awarding funding to Amtrak and SEPTA means more jobs, faster service, and sturdier infrastructure are on their way to our communities. These major investments include millions in project planning throughout Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and $30.5 million alone for substantial platform and accessibility upgrades at the Cornwells Heights SEPTA station in Bensalem. While key programs through Amtrak and like the Fed-State Partnership were bolstered by the funding made available by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, robust annual appropriations for these grants remain essential to keeping America's infrastructure, workforce, and economy strong. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that our nation's infrastructure is efficient, competitive, and safe.”\n\nRepresentative Glenn Ivey (D-MD-04) commented, “Encouraging the further development of high speed rail networks will bring efficiency of travel along the Northeast corridor and positive environmental impacts for the communities affected by decreased road congestion. I support transit and commute alternatives which make intercity travel more attractive to the public. Rail options deserve funding and support to enhance our economic opportunities while being a net gain for the environment.”\n\nRepresentative John B. Larson (D-CT-01) said, “The Hartford Line unites the cities of Springfield, Hartford, and New Haven via passenger rail, expanding transit connections and economic opportunity for residents and businesses across our ‘Knowledge Corridor. I am thrilled to announce record infrastructure funding the Connecticut delegation secured for track repairs and expansions across the Northeast Corridor, including more than $100 million dedicated to Hartford Line improvements. These investments will support more frequent and reliable passenger rail service to better connect residents across the region.”\n\nRepresentative Rob Menendez (D-NJ-08) commented, “Today, I am proud to announce over $4 billion in Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding that will transform the passenger experience along the Northeast Corridor. These funds will make the nation's busiest rail line more resilient and reliable for the millions of passengers that use it every year. Thanks to the partnership of the Biden Administration, Governor Murphy, and our Congressional Delegation, this is the start of a new era of infrastructure investment.”\n\nRepresentative Grace Meng (D-NY-06) said, “As New York's representative on the Regional Leadership Council, I'm excited to see money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law going toward passenger rail improvements impacting our area, especially for the important Northeast Corridor. Upgrading and investing in these types of rail infrastructure is crucial to helping our region grow and thrive, and enhancing the transportation needs of New Yorkers. I'm thrilled that our city and state continue to benefit from landmark legislation that I helped pass in Congress.”\n\nRepresentative Jerry Nadler (D-NY-12) added, “Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we now have a once in a generation opportunity to transform travel throughout the Northeast Corridor—and I applaud the Biden Administration for awarding $6.76 billion which will renew and expand transit services from Penn Station. I'm proud of my work with my colleagues in the New York State Delegation to secure this funding and look forward to continued progress on these critical projects for our region.”\n\nRepresentative Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA-05) commented, “Modernizing our passenger rail infrastructure is a key part of delivering the reliable, safe, and affordable transportation options we need in southeastern Pennsylvania. I'm glad to see yet another historic investment made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law flow into our region and expand economic opportunity.”\n\nMaryland Governor Wes Moore (D-MD) added, “In order to realize Maryland's potential to produce jobs, spark economic growth and be a place where people want to live, work and play, it's vital to provide fast, efficient passenger rail service. The Biden Administration knows Maryland is a pivotal rail connector for the entire Northeast Corridor. These transformative investments will help us deliver a world-class transportation network for our residents, our business community and the entire region.”\n\nConnecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto commented, “This grant funding helps address a backlog of major projects and improvements that will help enhance the safety and reliability of rail service, offer operational flexibility, and provide for increased capacity, speed, and efficiencies of rail transportation along the entire Northeast Corridor. Thank you to the FRA for supporting these projects, our Congressional delegation for passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and thank you to the Governor and state legislature for ensuring we had the matching funds ready to go with our grant applications.”\n\nMaryland Transportation Secretary Paul J. Wiedefeld said, “We're building a comprehensive transportation network that provides safe and accessible mobility for every Marylander across every mode, and that means modernized, efficient passenger rail service. Our partners at the federal level and at Amtrak know the importance of fast, reliable passenger rail service to provide residents with transportation mobility and economic mobility. This package reflects a tremendous investment in that vision.”\n\nMaryland Transit Administrator Holly Arnold added, “By themselves, each of these projects would bring significant improvements to transit on the Northeast Rail Corridor. Together, they represent a major upgrade in the passenger experience for our MARC riders on the Penn Line.”\n\nMassDOT Acting Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt commented, “We're grateful to the Biden-Harris Administration for this record-setting investment in Northeast Corridor infrastructure that will benefit intercity passenger and commuter rail services between Boston and Washington. The NEC transportation network is a vital component of the region and nation's economy, and these projects will advance our collective goals around climate, economic growth, and mobility.”\n\nNew York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said,“A strong infrastructure is the backbone of our nation and thanks to President Biden's leadership, this investment will benefit millions of passengers who rely on the Northeast Corridor as a reliable mode of transportation. This funding is critical for modernization projects like the Pelham Bay Bridge Replacement Project and the Hudson Tunnel Project, which are aging structures in need of renewal. Prioritizing this work will foster greater connectivity while enhancing economic growth and environmental sustainability, which will have a tremendous impact on future generations of travelers.”\n\nNew York MTA Construction and Development President Jamie Torres-Springer said, “We're so pleased that the Biden Administration came through and supported transformative projects such as the Metro-North Penn Station Access Project, which will expand rail service to over 500,000 Bronx residents in transit-starved neighborhoods even as it improves service reliability for Amtrak customers.”\n\nNJ TRANSIT President & CEO and Northeast Corridor Commission Co-Chair Kevin S. Corbett said, “Today marks a significant moment, not just for the transformational investments the Biden Administration is making in NJ TRANSIT infrastructure, but for the entire Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington, DC. We are grateful for the federal government's historic commitment to the region's transit infrastructure, and thank our New Jersey Congressional delegation for their continued advocacy that helped secure these critical funds.”\n\nPennsylvania Department of Transportation Secretary Mike Carroll added, “This investment is another example of the Biden Administration's transformative approach to infrastructure in Pennsylvania and beyond. This funding will further support our economic growth and mobility in the region and throughout the Northeast Corridor. We appreciate our elected leaders' support for this project. The Shapiro Administration is steadfast in its commitment to improve our transportation system through state investments and maximizing every dollar from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.”"
