On the Virginia Scenic Railway, sit back and enjoy the modernized ambiance of beautifully renovated passenger cars and enjoy a delicious meal as you comfortably glide through some of Virginia’s scenery, including the legendary Shenandoah Valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nThe Virginia Scenic Railway is currently offering two excursions, the Alleghany Special and the Blue Ridge Flyer; these round-trip trains depart from the historic Amtrak Staunton station in Staunton, Virginia. Each of these excursion tickets includes a meal and dessert selection, plus a beverage served in a complimentary souvenir glass. Schedule your trip today. Advance reservations are required.\n\nOnline Ticket Sales\n\nTickets are only available through this website. Due to high demand, our excursion tickets are released quarterly. Tickets are currently available through Nov 3rd. Booking early gives you the best selection of dates and times. Last-minute reservations are unfortunately not possible as this is a “Ride & Dine” train; all catering orders must be received by 4:00 pm on Wednesday to ensure availability for that weekend’s excursions (twice daily, Thursday-Sunday.) Tickets for Santa’s Scenic Railway are released in October."
