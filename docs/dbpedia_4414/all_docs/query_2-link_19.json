        "text": "There are three major trails in the Park, as well as numerous other foot paths. Hunter Island is the location of the Kazimiroff Nature Trail, a popular hiking destination that traverses a variety of rich habitats. The trail begins off the Orchard Beach boardwalk near section 2. It was named in 1987 after Dr. Theodore Kazimiroff. A dentist by trade, Kazimiroff was also a dedicated naturalist and local historian who was among the leaders in the effort to stop garbage dumping in the Park in the 1960s.\n\nThe Siwanoy Trail runs for nearly 3.5 miles and is named for the Native Americans who once lived on this land. The trail begins at the intersection of Shore Road and City Island Road, winds through the Central Woodlands, with offshoots around the Bartow-Pell Mansion and past the Orchard Beach Meadow. It is maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club in partnership with NYC Parks.\n\nThe Split Rock Trail is the shortest and most direct of the named Park trails. It begins near the Bartow Circle and meanders alongside Goose Creek Marsh and its associated woodlands to the northwestern corner of the park, where the great Split Rock sits in a small area at the intersection of the Hutchinson River Parkway and the New England Thruway.\n\nImage: Kazimiroff Nature Trail on Hunter Island taken by Alexander Belisle\n\nThe most well-known islands of the Park are Hunter Island, which was joined to The Bronx mainland in the 1930s when Orchard Beach was constructed, and Twin Island, added when the beach was expanded in the 1940s. Hiking trails, boulder sites, and an abundance of plants and wildlife make these islands popular destinations. In addition, Pelham Bay Park contains many smaller islands such as Hog Island, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the Chimney Sweeps in Long Island Sound, and Goose Island on the park’s west side in the Hutchinson River. These islands are important, protected places for waterbirds to breed and nest.\n\nThe designated Hunter Island Marine Zoology and Geology Sanctuary includes all of Twin Island, Cat Briar Island, Two Trees Island, and the northern and eastern shoreline of Hunter Island. Sanctuary designation means that plant and wildlife here will be preserved for both study and recreation.\n\nImage: Two Trees Island, Off the Coast of Twin Island taken by John Grayley, NYC Parks & Recreation"
