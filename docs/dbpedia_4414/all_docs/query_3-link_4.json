        "text": "Thanks for sending this, I had glossed over that doc in the past but never saw the actual maps here. It looks fantastic as the improvements are massive.\n\nBut how does this work in light of that Amtrak 2035 document that was released pretty recently? Does this still supersede that document because 2035 seemed much less extensive and more getting everything into a state of good repair.\n\nThe purpose of a Tier I EIS is to provide the overall framework within which all projects SOGR, improvements and drastic new features must fall. Funding is usually tied to proposal showing how it furthers the achievement of the Tier I EIS objectives, and that is done on a per project Tier II EIS among other project documents. For that reason, the EIS is essentially two things, one is what needs to be done to the existing infrastructure as covered by the necessary work to support the Regional service. The other is the new High Speed infrastructure to support the new High Speed service. None of the latter is currently funded. All of the current funding and Amtrak's 2035 plan are consistent with the former and more or less in line with the Tier I EIS. Most of the proposed new ROW is part of the second aspect mentioned above. The Tier I EIS also represents a level of consensus among the vast number of stake holders regarding an overall direction to take.\n\nAnd was any of this actual funded or is this all a beautifully funded pipe dream that will break ground in the year 2250? Is there a way to see what from the project was funded/rejected or if this entire thing was rejected? Nervous because if it wasn't funded with that giant check from the infra bill I don't know if it ever will be\n\nMany small steps consistent with the EIS are funded and progressing. There were even more ambitious proposals in other alternatives that were rejected for various reasons. Funded projects include the Hudson Tubes, Portal Bridge, B&P Tunnel replacement, the bridge replacements in Connecticut, Pawtuckett Station, improvements at Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark. Almost funded are quadruple tracking Secaucus Jct to Newark, Penn South, Boston South Station improvements etc. etc.\n\nIn so far as this EIS also serves as a consensus building document there is certain amount of local support to most things in it, and there is certain amount of NIMBY opposition to some parts, but that always has to be balanced with support in a consensus building process, which is another purpose served by this document. An example of what was tossed out due to overwhelming opposition was the various inland alignments which involved lot of tunneling under properties owned by very rich people and such. The Long Island route was also rejected partly because of that and partly because of the expense of tunneling under Long Island Sound. The process was quite exhaustive and exhausting and took about 5 years to complete.\n\nWilmington is probably a more important station than the size of the city might suggest. Because of Delaware's attractive corporate laws, many companies that have nothing to do with Delaware are incorporated there, and I believe they have to maintain at least one office with and officer of the corporation resident in the state. Thus, I suspect that there's a good bit of business travel between these corporate offices and both the political capital (Washington, DC) and the financial capital (New York) of the country. Because all of the trains stop at Wilmington, that sharp curve coming into the station probably doesn't make much of a difference in total travel time, as the train is slowing down to make the stop, anyway.\n\nAt the end of the day, its not a top 10 Amtrak station in terms of ridership, and is barely a top 10 NEC station. Regionals should stop there and continue to do so, but Acela's should have flexibility to skip that stops and cut travel time should the demand and ticket sales be high enough"
