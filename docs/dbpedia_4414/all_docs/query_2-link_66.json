        "text": "BY C.J. CARNACCHI0\n\nOxford Leader Editor\n\nA stone bridge that’s linked Oxford and Orion townships for 114 years will be considered for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places by the Michigan Historic Preservation Review Board in Lansing.\n\nThe single-span arch bridge that extends over Indian Lake Road along the east side of M-24 once carried the 109-mile long Detroit & Bay City Railroad line over the road.\n\nToday, the crossing is unused except for some pedestrians while the arch below serves as sort of an unofficial gateway to Indian Lake Road.\n\nIn a unique twist, the north half of the bridge is located in Oxford whereas the south half is part of Orion.\n\nConstructed of yellowish-brown sandstone in 1891 by the Detroit & Bay City Railroad, the 15.75-foot high bridge is now co-owned by the Farmington Hills-based CRS Acquisition, which controls the northern half in Oxford, and Orion resident Rick Chevrier, who owns the southern half in Orion.\n\nLeslie Pielack, an Addison resident who lives on Indian Lake Road and member of the Orion Historical Society, said she and other society members are working toward getting the bridge listed on the National Register of Historic Places to increase public awareness about it and hopefully preserve it for future generations.\n\n‘It’s a very rare bridge from that era,? she said. ‘It’s a fixture in our community.?\n\nAccording to the State Historic Preservation Office, ‘the Indian Lake Road Bridge is one of only a small number of stone arch railroad bridges known to exist in Michigan.?\n\nOnly eight other such railroad bridges (built between the 1860s and 1890s) are known to exist in the state.\n\n‘Stone arch bridges are a rarity in Michigan,? according to the State Historic Preservation Office.\n\nThe bridge may also hold historic significance as the possible work of Fred B. Pelham, an African American who graduated at the head of his class in engineering from the University of Michigan in 1887 and worked as an assistant civil engineer for the Michigan Central Railroad (which operated the Detroit & Bay City line) from 1887 to 1895. It’s reported he designed and built some 20 bridges for the railroad.\n\nAlthough there’s no documentation that Pelham was responsible for the Indian Lake Road bridge, it’s construction falls within the period he worked for the Michigan Central.\n\nPlacement on the National Register would offer benefits for the bridge and its owners, but no legal protection or restrictions on it.\n\nAdministered by the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places is the nation’s official list of cultural resources worthy of preservation. It’s part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate and protect the country’s historic and archeological resources.\n\nListing in the National Register provides benefits such as recognition that a property is significant to the nation, state or community; consideration in planning for federal or federally assisted projects; and eligibility for federal tax incentives and other preservation assistance.\n\nListing in the Register does not interfere with a private property owner’s rights to alter, manage or dispose of property. Listing does not mean that limitations will be placed on the properties by the federal or state government.\n\nPielack is aware that attempting to list the bridge on the National Register will offer it no legal protection, however, she’s hoping the publicity will create a desire and interest among residents to see it preserved for future generations.\n\nShe believes placing the bridge on the National Register will make it ‘more visible to the public? and ‘raise awareness about how unusual it is,? thereby giving the ‘perception of being protected.?\n\n‘If it becomes more noticeable, it’s more likely to be protected,? she said.\n\nKeith Rodgers, a partner in the Farmington Hills-based CRS Acquisition, which owns the north half of the bridge in Oxford, said his company is in favor of it being placed on the National Register and in favor of its preservation in general.\n\n‘We like it. We’d like it to stay,? he said.\n\nRodgers said his company would be willing to join the southern property owner in granting the Orion Historical Society an easement that would allow regular maintenance of the structure.\n\n‘We want to keep it in good condition,? he said. ‘We don’t want it to fall down.?\n\nRichard Chevrier, who’s owned the bridge’s southern portion in Orion since the early 1990s, said he too is in favor of preserving the structure and placing it on the National Register.\n\nPielack said she would like to see ownership of the bridge transferred to a non-profit, third party such as the Orion Historical Society or other conservation or preservation group. She would also like to see the foot path that runs across the top of the bridge and surrounding properties eventually used as a link between the Polly Ann and Paint Creek trails.\n\nIf the board recommends the bridge’s nomination be approved, it must then go to State Historic Preservation Officer Brian Conway for his approval. If he too approves, it’s then fowarded to National Park Service for review and a final determination."
