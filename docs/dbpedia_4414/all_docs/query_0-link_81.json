        "text": "Amtrak was awarded $4.3 billion this fall by the U.S. Department of Transportation, which the agency described as “unprecedented funding.”\n\nThe funds are being used to modernize Amtrak rolling stock and stations. The latter largely involves bringing Amtrak stations into compliance with access standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nUSDOT said much of the funding is coming from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act., which the agency said will allocate to Amtrak $22 billion over a five-year period. That legislation was approved in November 2021.\n\nThat money, USDOT said, will be used to bring 280 stations into compliance with the ADA and replace a fleet of 1,000 rail cars and locomotives.\n\nSome of the new equipment is entering service this year and more than 525 new rail cars and locomotives will begin service by the end of the decade.\n\nThe USDOT news release said some funding will be used to work down an infrastructure maintenance backlog and to invest in modern technology systems.\n\nFederal Railroad Administrator head Amit Bose said this week that intercity passenger rail corridor development funding will most likely be awarded to entities that are committed to supporting the service.\n\nThe FRA will be disbursing $44 billion for corridor development that was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act adopted last year.\n\nBose spoke in Indianapolis this week to a meeting of the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission.\n\nHe told meeting attendees that “the corridor development programs must be presented by committed state and local stakeholders as well as regional bodies like this one [MIPRC], so your role as a coordinating entity is as important as ever.”\n\nBy that Bose meant an entity wanting to see the development of a rail corridor must be willing to provide financial and political support.\n\nAlso speaking at the meeting, Wynne Davis, FRA deputy director of the agency’s Outreach office, who said the initial level of federal funding may be modest initially but will grow as corridors advance through the corridor development program.\n\nA first step in that process is an expression of interest in developing one or more passenger rail corridors.\n\nThat expression of interest is non-binding but must be followed up with financial and political commitments. That will mean state and local funding to match federal grants.\n\nIdaho officials are renewing their efforts to bring additional intercity passenger trains to their state.\n\nCurrently, Idaho’s sole train is the Chicago-Seattle/Portland Empire Builder.\n\nThe capital of Boise has been without Amtrak service since the discontinuance of the Pioneer in 1997.\n\nOfficials in Boise have been meeting with Amtrak to discuss reinstatement of some service on the former Pioneer route, which at one time operated between Seattle and Salt Lake City with through cars to and from Chicago.\n\nAlso meeting with Amtrak were officials in Pocatello. They are seeking at a minimum service between Boise and Salt Lake City.\n\nThe Idaho Statesman reported that Boise City Council President Elaine Clegg “has for years been advocating for the return of rail service through the historic Boise Depot.”\n\nPast train discontinuances have left what Clegg described as “huge swaths” of the Mountain West without intercity rail passenger service.\n\n“They are recognizing that this is maybe a once in a lifetime opportunity to reestablish rail in ways in the U.S. that we haven’t seen since the 1960s,” Clegg said, in reference to funding being made available for new rail services as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\n\nThat legislation contains $66 billion for rail projects, including $36 billion for expansion and upgrades of passenger service.\n\nA spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration told the Idaho Statesman that the Pioneer route will be evaluated for potential new service.\n\nReviving service on the route of the former Pioneer was studied in 2009, but nothing came of it.\n\nThat study projected that capital costs to revive the route between Seattle and Salt Lake City would be $382 million. Annual operations costs were estimated at $36.6 million to $46.2 million.\n\nRidership was estimated at 102,000 passengers per year, which would have generated $11.6 million in revenue but posted a loss of a $25 million.\n\n“That was 1997, and if you look at the population growth in Salt Lake City and Boise, and maybe Pocatello, it’s a different world today,” Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari told the Idaho Statesman. “It is the best time for starting new service in more than 50 years.”\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration announced last week that it has awarded more than $233 million in grants for infrastructure improvements to Amtrak routes.\n\nThe funding came from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal-State Partnership for State of Good Repair Program.\n\nMost of the projects are located along the Northeast Corridor, but funding also will pay for projects in Michigan and California.\n\nIn the Northeast Corridor, a grant will provide $65.2 million for replacement of a bridge over the Connecticut River, and up to $20 million for replacement of two power substations on the state-owned New Haven Line.\n\nThe new bridge will provide additional clearance for marine traffic, allow train speeds to increase from 45 mph to 70 mph, and reduce the number of delays for bridge openings.\n\nThe new substations on the New Haven Line, used by more than 350 commuter trains and 60 Amtrak trains, will be more reliable and energy efficient, less costly to maintain, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn New Jersey, up to $45 million was awarded for replacement of the Sawtooth Bridges, two 110-year-old structures in Kearny used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. The two existing bridges will be replaced with three new ones, with four tracks providing redundancy for operations during maintenance work or service disruptions.\n\nThey will also allow an increase in operating speed above the current 60 mph.\n\nIn Maryland up to $20 million was awarded to fund final design for replacement of the 116-year-old, Amtrak-owned Susequehanna River Bridge between Perryville and Havre de Grace.\n\nThe new bridge will allow train operation at up to 125 mph, with greater clearance above the river and a movable span that can open and close more efficiently.\n\nIn New York, up to $10.7 million was awarded for work necessary in advance of the East River Tunnel Rehabilitation Project, and up to $4.5 million for preliminary stages of the Pelham Bay Bridge Replacment Project.\n\nBefore tunnel work can begin, a connection to Sunnyside Yard must be reinstalled and improved, and an electric traction power cable must be relocated.\n\nThe Pelham Bay Bridge over the Hutchinson River in the Bronx opened in 1907 and often fails to close properly.\n\nThe new bridge will increase clearance for marine traffic and raise operating speeds to 60 to 100 mph.\n\nAlso in New York, up to $28.2 million was awarded to replace a 520-foot-long, low-level platform with a high-level platform at Rhinecliff Station on the Empire Corridor.\n\nThe project will also include new access to the platform including stairs, elevators, and a pedestrian bridges, as well as track and signal work needed to allow an increase in Empire Service operations.\n\nIn California, up to $27.3 million was awarded for improvements in Oceanside on the Surf Line. The project will replace a 100-year-old, single-track bridge over the San Luis Rey River with a two-track structure, as well as improving a grade-crossing, bike path, pedestrian underpass, grading, drainage, and signals.\n\nIn Massachusetts, up to $7.6 million was awarded for replacement of the more than century-old South Elm Street Bridge on the MBTA’s Haverhill Line, which is also used by Amtrak.\n\nIn Michigan up to $1.6 million was awarded for reconstruction of five deficient bridges on the state-owned rail line between Kalamazoo and Dearborn, used by Amtrak’s Wolverine and Blue Water trains. The work will improve reliability, increase load ratings, and avoid future bridge closures.\n\nThe Federal Railroad Administration last week issued a Request of Information on the new Interstate Rail Compacts Grant Program that it will administer.\n\nThe program was established by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to provide funding to states for intercity rail passenger service.\n\nIn a notice published in the Federal Register, the FRA said its role in the program is to pay for “the technical and administrative functions of IRCs and support coordination and promotion activities for rail services within a region.”\n\nThe FRA said interstate rail compacts have traditionally promoted development of intercity passenger rail projects and fostered the efficient development of those projects sponsored by state departments of transportation.\n\n“Furthermore, as investment in intercity passenger rail from state and federal governments over the past decade has created increasingly robust rail networks, a greater need has emerged for increased cooperation across state lines to coordinate intercity passenger rail services and project delivery,” the FRA notice said.\n\nCertain regions have also expressed a desire for strong leadership to represent regional needs. The FRA notice said it is seeking public comment on how the Interstate Rail Compacts Grant Program can best support existing compacts “so they are able to take a more central role in advancing the development of intercity passenger rail service.”\n\nBy law only established compacts are eligible for financial assistance under the program, but the FRA said it is considering whether offering other types of assistance outside of the program, such as technical support, to states interested in developing compacts would be beneficial.\n\nComments are due by Sept. 19."
