Amtrak staff has baggage tags available if you need them.\n\nAmtrak Cascades checked baggage service is available at: Albany, Bellingham, Centralia, Edmonds, Eugene, Everett, Portland, Salem, Seattle, Tacoma, Vancouver, B.C.*, and Vancouver, WA. If you are checking baggage, please arrive at the station 45 minutes early.\n\n*If you are checking baggage in Vancouver, B.C., please arrive one hour in advance of departure.\n\nChecked baggage service is available during hours of operation at staffed stations. Visit the specific stations webpage for specific station hours. Free \"Red Cap\" service is available to help with your bags in Seattle and Portland.\n\nChecked baggage is not available at Olympia, Tukwila, Kelso, Oregon City, or Stanwood stations.\n\nExcess/Oversize Baggage Fees\n\nA $20 excess baggage fee will be charged for each carry-on and personal item above the quantity and size limits. A maximum of two excess bags are permitted per passenger. The fee will be collected at the station or if unstaffed, onboard the train. If checked baggage is available, passengers can check two bags free of charge to their final destination. Checked baggage is not offered on all trains and stations, so please check with Amtrak to see if checked baggage is available throughout your journey. Amtrak reserves the right to deny transport for items exceeding policy limitations.\n\nAll baggage, both carry-on and checked, must be visibly tagged with your name and address. Amtrak staff has baggage tags available if you need them. Carry-on purses, briefcases, laptop cases, diaper bags, strollers, car seats, cosmetic cases, or equipment required for a medical condition do not need name/address tags.\n\nOnce on board the train, carry-on bags may be stowed in overhead bins or baggage rack. Safety rules require that all bags be stowed in designated baggage areas and kept out of aisles, walkways, and vestibules. Please bring only luggage you can lift overhead without assistance. Baggage is not allowed in the Bistro and Lounge cars.\n\nThe complete baggage policy is available at Amtrak.com.\n\nBICYCLES\n\nMake a reservation for both you and your bike aboard Amtrak Cascades. There are two options for bringing your bike – you can use one of our onboard bike racks, or box your bicycle and check it as baggage.\n\nTen bike racks are available on each Amtrak Cascades train. Bike racks are very popular and reservations are required. The cost for reserving space in the bike rack is $5. Bicycle racks will not accommodate tandem, recumbent or other unusual bikes. Such bikes must be transported as checked baggage in a box.\n\nBoxed bicycles do not require a reservation and can be checked as baggage. There is a $10 handling fee for checking a boxed bike. (This is subject to change without notice.) Not all stations have checked baggage service, and baggage service may not be available every day. Don't have a bicycle box? Bicycle boxes are available for purchase for $15 at staffed Amtrak stations with checked baggage service. Bicycles usually must be partially disassembled. For details regarding boxing your bicycle, on general information bringing bicycles onboard, please visit Amtrak.com\n\nSPECIAL ITEMS\n\nSpecial items such as sports equipment, strollers, etc. are allowed on the train. Amtrak accepts a number of special items such as baby strollers, golf bags, musical instruments, snowboards, and skis (one board or set per bag/container).\n\nSpecial items (such as skis, golf bags and surfboards) must be properly packed and visibly tagged.\n\nIn most cases there is a handling charge of $10 to $20 per special item. Contact 1-800-USA-RAIL (1-800-872-7245) for more information.\n\nFIREARMS AND AMMUNITIONS\n\nAmtrak allows firearms and ammunition to be checked as luggage between staffed stations.

(Laptop computers and handheld devices may be carried onboard; however, Amtrak accepts no liability for damage.)\n\nAnimals (except service animals and small pets allowed per the Pet Policy).\n\nOversized or overweight items.\n\nConsumption of personal alcohol is strictly forbidden.\n\nPlease note: This is not an exhaustive list. Any item similar to those listed, even if not specifically mentioned here, is prohibited from being carried onboard or checked as baggage.\n\nLOST AND FOUND\n\nReports for lost or misplaced items left on trains or in stations must be submitted within 30 days of travel. For best results, submit your report at your arrival station; otherwise, call Amtrak at 1-800-USA-RAIL (1-800-872-7245).\n\nWhen reporting a lost item, please have the following information ready:\n\nA thorough description of the lost item, including a description of the size, color, brand, condition and any other distinguishing features.\n\nYour date or dates of travel.\n\nYour departure and arrival stations.\n\nYour trains names and numbers.\n\nWatch a fun interactive video with more tips for being safe around trains.\n\nGeneral Rail Safety Principles\n\nRail is a safe and efficient way to move both people and goods. Moving goods via freight trains reduces the number of large trucks on our congested highways. Riding a train is more than 23 times safer than traveling by car.\n\nRail has a solid safety track record. Rail safety is a priority for Washington state, railroads, Amtrak, local communities and non-profit organizations. These and other groups continue to invest in rail improvements to enhance safety.\n\nRules to Remember\n\nTrains have the right of way. Legally, trains have the right of way. Trains are very heavy and can't stop quickly—even if they're traveling at low speeds. By the time a locomotive engineer can see you or your car, it's nearly always too late for them to stop to avoid hitting you. Trains also can't swerve to avoid you or your car because they travel on tracks. As a result of these facts, trains have the right of way.\n\nNever trespass or cross tracks illegally. Railroad tracks are private property, not public trails. It's illegal and dangerous to walk on or near tracks unless you're using a designated crossing. It's also illegal and extremely dangerous ( and DUMB ) to drive around closed crossing gates or to ignore flashing warning lights. Trains travel in both directions on all tracks—so it's impossible to predict which direction a train will approach from.\n\nAlways expect a train. While you may think you know the schedules of trains that run through your neighborhood, a train can travel on the tracks at any time. Passenger and regularly scheduled freight trains run early or late. Freight trains are needed to carry goods day and night on sporadic runs. Track maintenance work miles away can require dispatchers to adjust usually steady schedules.\n\nTrain Speeds\n\nWho sets train speeds?\n\nUnder the authority of law (RCW 81.48.030), the Utilities and Transportation Commission (UTC) in Washington state generally has the authority to set speed limits at all grade crossings in unincorporated areas and in all cities, except those where populations are greater than 100,000 (such as Seattle, Tacoma, or Vancouver, WA). However, federal regulations preempt the state and cities from setting speed limits except where unique local safety conditions exist. As a result, the UTC can set speed limits only where such conditions warrant a deviation from Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards.\n\nAre train speeds going to increase in the future?\n\nYes. In many communities train speeds will increase, but only in locations where safety standards allow. Faster train speeds:\n\nReduce wait times at crossings for truck and car traffic on local streets.\n\nHelp businesses that ship by rail.\n\nBenefit Amtrak Cascades and commuter rail passengers.\n\nTrain speeds usually increase only after track and signal improvements are constructed to ensure trains can run safely. Railroads, Amtrak and WSDOT are working with local jurisdictions and the UTC to improve train safety while increasing freight and passenger train speeds.\n\nCan you tell how fast a train is traveling by looking at it?\n\nNo. Because of the size of a train, it appears to be traveling much slower than you think, making the train appear to be farther away than it is. It is impossible to judge the speed of a train under these conditions.\n\nBecause of this, vehicle drivers at grade crossings think they can \"beat the train.\" Sadly, this is often not the case. Crossing in front of an oncoming train is always dangerous and many people have lost their lives or been injured as a result. Almost 95 percent of railroad fatalities are motorists at grade crossings, or people who have trespassed on railroad property.\n\nWhy do trains have to run so fast? Why can't we just slow them down?\n\nRailroad companies and their customers like to operate trains as fast as good engineering and safety practices allow. Ultimately, time is money in the competitive world of transportation and freight mobility. Requiring slower train speeds would likely have a number of negative impacts, including:\n\nMore traffic congestion in communities as slower trains block grade crossings for longer periods.\n\nHigher transportation costs for the economy as a whole, which translates into higher prices at stores.\n\nMore trucks on our already-congested roadways as shippers shift their business away from railroads.\n\nPassengers clogging highways and airports as train travel becomes less convenient.\n\nMore incidents as people try to \"beat the train\" and trespass on railroad tracks.\n\nWho can I contact if I have concerns about train speeds?\n\nThe federal government controls most regulations of freight train traffic. For further information contact the federal Surface Transportation Board or the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\nThe UTC has limited regulatory authority over railroads and can be contacted at 360-664-1160 or800-562-6150 (in Washington state). For more information on their authority, please visit UTC website.\n\nGrade Crossings and Grade Separations\n\nWhat are grade crossings and grade separations?\n\nA railroad grade crossing is an intersection where a rail line and a roadway (or pathway) cross one another at the same level. To avoid collisions, control devices are required at grade crossings just like intersecting roads need stop signs or traffic signals. Control devices include warning signs, crossbucks (the familiar x-shaped signs), pavement markings, and, in some locations, gates and flashing lights.\n\nA grade separation is created when a bridge or tunnel is built to allow the roadway to pass over or under the rail line, completely separating automobiles and other traffic from train traffic.\n\nWho should I call if I'm worried about a grade crossing?\n\nConcerns about traffic backups and delays on the roadway should be directed to the local public works department in the community where the crossing exists, listed in the government pages of the phone book. If a crossing needs additional warning devices or is in need of an upgrade, contact the Utilities and Transportation Commission in Olympia at 360-664-1262.\n\nIf crossing warning signals or gates are broken, malfunctioning or need maintenance , contact:\n\nIn Washington: BNSF Railway Company at 800-832-5452.\n\nIn Oregon: Union Pacific Railroad at 800-848-8715.\n\nDepending on which railroad owns the tracks, one or the other will be able to respond to your concerns.\n\nWho is responsible for crossing signals and safety devices?\n\nRailroads are usually privately owned. Local public works departments coordinate the installation of crossing signals and safety devices with the railroad company. The public works department requests signals and safety/warning devices and lines up money to pay for them. The railroad installs and maintains them. The public works department can request federal money to pay for the cost of signal installation.\n\nWhen is grade separation required?\n\nGrade separation is required for new road construction and recommended for existing grade crossings when \"design thresholds\" are exceeded. Design thresholds look at the number of cars and trains traveling through the crossing, train speeds, the number and type of tracks, and how many road lanes there are.\n\nHow much does grade separation cost?\n\nGrade separation is expensive and can be disruptive to neighborhoods, if businesses or homes adjacent to the intersection must be condemned or relocated. Creating grade separation at a single crossing can easily cost $15 to $20 million. There are often less expensive alternatives to grade separation, such as:\n\nUpgrading crossing gates and lights.\n\nRerouting local road traffic.\n\nUpgrading one crossing while closing adjacent crossings.\n\nWho is responsible for grade separation?\n\nResponsibility for grade separation varies among local, state and federal governments.\n\nWill the state's Amtrak program build grade separations?\n\nIn locations where passenger train speeds exceed 110 mph, Federal Railroad Administration regulations would require grade separation. However, passenger train speeds are not expected to exceed 110 mph within the next 20 years. When this occurs it will be limited and mostly in rural locations.\n\nWhere can I learn more about grade crossing safety?\n\nOperation Lifesaver is an international safety program designed to prevent rail-related collisions through educational outreach. To schedule a free presentation about what causes collisions and how to avoid them, call 360-664-1264 . To learn more, write Washington Operations Lifesaver, PO Box 47250, Olympia, WA 98504-7250.\n\nOperation Lifesaver is a non-profit education and awareness program dedicated to ending tragic collisions, fatalities and injuries at highway-rail grade crossings and on railroad rights of way. To accomplish its mission, Operation Lifesaver promotes the 3 E's:\n\nEducation: Operation Lifesaver seeks to educate drivers and pedestrians to make safer decisions at crossings and around railroad tracks.\n\nEnforcement: Operation Lifesaver works with law enforcement officials to reduce grade crossing and trespassing incidents.\n\nEngineering: Operation Lifesaver encourages engineering projects to improve public safety.\n\nWashington state is a very active participant in the Operation Lifesaver program with volunteers educating the public at schools, county and safety fairs, malls, clubs, and professional organizations.\n\nWashington Operation Lifesaver members include the Utilities and Transportation Commission, Washington State Department of Transportation, Washington Traffic Safety Commission, Washington State Patrol, Amtrak, Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway, short-line railroads, All Aboard Washington, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Federal Railroad Administration, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, United Transportation Union, and Sound Transit.\n\nGeneral Rail Safety Principles\n\nRail is a safe and efficient way to move both people and goods.
