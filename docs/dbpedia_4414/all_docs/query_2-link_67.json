        "text": "Interstate 95 is a major north-south highway across the east coast but within New York if functions as a local highway for the Bronx and Westchester County and a through route for traffic between New England and the south. It is composed of the Trans-Manhatten Expressway, most of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, some of the Bruckner Experessway, and New England Thruway (that latter of which is maintained by NYSTA). The exits are mileage-based on the portions maintained by NYSDOT, although an aborted plan would have converted the numbers to sequential.\n\nActual Mile\n\nPosted Mile Northbound Southbound Notes 0.0 New York\n\nNew York County\n\nBorough of Manhattan New Jersey\n\nBergen County Speed Limit 45 0.5 Exit 1A\n\nHenry Hudson Parkway\n\nWest 178th Street Exit 1A\n\nHenry Hudson Parkway\n\nWest 181st Street\n\nPartially signed exit 1 northbound 1.2 Exit 1B\n\nHarlem River Drive\n\nTo FDR Drive\n\nManhattan Signed exit 2 Bronx County\n\nBorough of The Bronx New York County\n\nBorough of Manhattan 1.4 Exits 1C-D\n\nMajor Deegan Expressway\n\nQueens\n\nAlbany Exits 1D-C-B\n\nMajor Deegan Expressway\n\nQueens\n\nAlbany Amsterdam Avenue\n\nPartially signed exit 3 northbound Speed Limit 50 Speed Limit 45 2.1 Exit 2A\n\nJerome Avenue 2.7 Exit 2B\n\nNorth\n\nWebster Avenue 2.9 Exit 3\n\nTo North\n\nThird Avenue\n\nWebster Avenue 4.0 Exit 4A\n\nSouth\n\nSheridan Boulevard\n\nRobert F.
