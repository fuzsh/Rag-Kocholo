        "text": "From a top-right front-page 'SPECIAL REPORT' article in the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper of Sunday, Sept. 20, 2009:\n\nAmtrak bridges in region troubled\n\nOfficials say the region's spans are safe, but they need hundreds of millions in repairs. An Inquirer lawsuit threat uncovered the data.\n\nA summary excerpt:\n\n''Nearly half of Amtrak's 302 bridges in the Philadelphia region have some elements rated \"poor\" or worse, according to Amtrak's bridge-inspection reports, prepared over the last two years. The Inquirer obtained them under the Freedom of Information Act.''\n\nThe full article is at:\n\nhttp://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/20090920_Amtrak_bridges_troubled.html?viewAll=y\n\nThere are a couple of photos and some graphics, but nothing outstanding. The continuation of the article covers all of page A-15, plus the lead-in half-column on page A-1, so it rated some significant space. I don't think there's really any 'news' here - it's no secret that a lot of those bridges are old and need major work or replacement.\n\nOne point the article missed was the parallel with the condition of the ex-Reading Railroad bridges on that side of the SEPTA Regional Rail system - they were so bad that within a few months of the opening of the Center City Commuter Connection Tunnel in 1985 (?), the ex-RDG main had to be closed for about a month while 1 bridge was replaced on an emergency basis. Then, a couple years later there was a huge rush project with a catchy name - something like 'SEPTA WORKS' Edit: It was 'RAIL WORKS', as I recall - under which 8 or 10 or so bridges were replaced during a single's summer shutdown of the main line. It does not seem as if these Amtrak bridges are anywhere near as bad. (For what it's worth, I know Ben Yen, P.E., the Lehigh University professor emeritus who is quoted in the article, but I don't think his quoted comments are especially noteworthy - just an independent 'expert's view being provided is how I see that, as he has no significant railroad bridge expertise of which I'm aware.)\n\nWhat's equally interesting in that Amtrak 'stone-walled' the Inquirer in releasing the bridge inspection reports so badly that the Inquirer had to go right to the edge of filing a suit under the 'Freedom of Information Act' - 'FOIA' to get the information released. One of Amtrak's stated reasons for withholding the data was apparently 'homeland security' - so that the terrorists wouldn't get any help in knowing where the vulnerabilities are. There was a lengthy 'side-bar' article on this in the print edition, but I haven't found the 'on-line' version yet. If I do, I'll post the link here as well.\n\n- Paul North.\n\nEdit: Here's the link to the 'sidebar' article, \"Lawsuit threat got Amtrak to disclose\":\n\nhttp://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/20090920_Lawsuit_threat_got_Amtrak_to_disclose.html\n\n- PDN.\n\nSome further thoughts regarding this, mostly aspects that the article didn't say or address in any way, so we can't tell if the reporter even thought to ask about them or not:\n\nA couple of notices - if issued, or not - would tell us how seriously Amtrak views these bridge condition problems, in a very eloquent manner:\n\n- Are there any speed restrictions / 'slow orders' for trains across any of these bridges ?\n\n- Are there any weight restrictions for cars or trains across them ?\n\nThe article did mention the 'reserve capacity' of the bridges, since they were designed by the PRR for steam locomotives, and the present trains are lighter and of course don't have those impact forces - many of those bridges probably don't even see freight traffic any more. Even with the passenger trains, most of the tracks are clear most of the time - it happens that 2 trains are on the same bridge at the same time, though more than that is extremely rare. But a numerical comparison of those respective loadings would have been useful and informative - are they 3 % less ? 30 % less ? [Actually, the passenger loading might be down as low as 1/4 to 1/3 of the freight loading: An 85 ft. passenger car at 2,500 lbs. per ft. would 'weigh-in' at 106 tons - a true heavy-weight, and probably considerably over-stated - but even that's only 35 % of the typical Cooper E-72 loading used for bridge design.] Of course, the passenger locomotives are closer in weight to freight locomotives, but the point remains - there's potentially still a huge reserve capacity = 'margin of safety' - even allowing for rusting and 'section loss', etc. - in what looks like a bridge that's in poor condition.\n\nHow big and busy and well-funded is Amtrak's Bridge & Building gang for this region ?\n\nDoes Amtrak have a program or 'priority list' for repairing - not replacing, just repairing - these bridges ?\n\nDoes Amtrak have engineering plans commissioned and approvals and permits in hand so that any of these bridge repair/ replacement projects are 'shovel-ready' to go for funding under the ARRA 'stimulus' program ? If so, which ones ? If not, why not ?\n\nWith 300+ bridges under its purview, Amtrak ought to be physically replacing/ rehabilitating a number of them each year just to keep current. For example, if a typical bridge lifetime is 50 years, then about 6 'typical' bridges ought to be getting done each year, on average [300 bridges / 50 years = 6 bridges per year]. So how many is Amtrak doing this year ? Previous years ? [I used to work with a rural township that was generally unexceptional - except that about 20 years ago the Board of Supervisors decided to start an annual program of replacing 1 bridge each year, of their multitude of bridges over the numerous little creeks in that area. Progress was slow to be seen at first - but now, most of the bridges are done, there are no more crises of that sort, and the money can soon be used for other things.]\n\nSimilarly, as a budgetary matter - what have been Amtrak's requests and budgets for bridgework ? Is Amtrak requesting an appropriate adn sufficient amount to overhaul a reasonable proportion of its bridges each year, only to get shot down by the White House and/ or Congress, which causes the deferred maintenance to accumulate ? [You just know they are, right ?] Why wasn't this explored further in the article ?\n\nThen we get to Pennsylvania's weird system for allocating responsibility for the maintenance and replacement of bridges like these by the Commonwealth's Public Utilities Commission. Unfortunately for Amtrak, most of these bridges were probably built by the PRR for its own convenience in eliminating grade crossings, have never been the subject of a PUC allocation determination, and so may even be 'orphan bridges' - bridges without a clearly known owner or responsible entity. So, Amtrak faces an uphill fight to get any other entity - such as the City of Philadelphia or other local municipality, the County, and/ or PennDOT,etc. - to share the costs of replacement or rehabilitation, especially since most of them are chronically short of money as well, even though they do benefit from the lack of grade crossings. But aside from being a possible avenue for Amtrak to explore for shared funding, the PUC process just adds to its administrative burden in owning and maintaining these bridges. That too should have been pointed out.\n\nWell, enough for now. This is a complex subject, with lots of nuances and ramifications that don't transfer well to the journalistic mind-set and presentation style.\n\n- Paul North.\n\nAnnual inspection reports are only that, reports. They only report on what can be seen. Comments are all relative. The key is to be consistent from report to report so the picture created is accurate over time. Another person, seldom the same person doing the on site inspection, must look at the report and determine if additional information is needed. For serious conditons, the inspector must take action immediately, but that presumes they understand what they are seeing, which they better if they are trusted to do the inspection.\n\nThe new FRA proposed rule published 8-17-09 in the Federal Register addresses these and many more issues in great detail. For any bridge inspection report there will often be something in it that is less than favorable. Just citing a total number of poor ratings tells you nothing about what it applied to. The hand rail or the main girder? There is a difference.\n\nThe article makes many statements in order to create the image of how terrible things are. They also mention the 1400+ bridges Amtrak is responsible for. The burden of that number of bridges, most of which are not new, is tremendous. Amtrak's bridge people have their hands full with everything but money.\n\nAs a side note, RAILROAD bridges are built to last a lot longer than 50 years.\n\nAnother shameless plug: Anyone interested in learning about railroad bridge inspection should visit the AREMA.org website and look at the new Bridge Inspection Seminars being offered. This is a 3 day class prepared by some of the best railroad bridge engineers in North America to follow AREMA's recently published handbook on the subject. The website shows one coming in Spring, TX in October and Roseville, CA in November but there will be one in the Chicago area in December and several more around the country next spring.\n\nThe class will not make anyone into a bridge inspector but will teach you when to ask for help."
