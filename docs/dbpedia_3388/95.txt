John Marvin Scott is a multi-instrumentalist, improviser, musician, and educator. Obtaining his Bachelor's Degree in Jazz Performance/Composition from Capilano University in North Vancouver in 2022, John has established himself as one of Western Canada’s essential musicians and music educators.

John is an active composer, creating musical compositions and improvisations under multiple aliases, as well as performing with local musicians and groups from across Western Canada. John is one of Canada’s most active musicians in the metaverse, performing monthly at The Inn in Decentraland and continues to perform in other metaverse venues.

John's debut double LP titled 'The Capstone' is a reflection on the dichotomy of the freedoms in music. Alternating with two ensembles, one performing compositions by John, and the other performing spontaneous improvisations, John is pushing the boundaries of what music can convey as an art form.

John is educated by some of the top musicians in Canada, such as the Canadian jazz guitar legend Bill Coon, and Canada-born trumpeter and Yamaha artist Karen Gustafson.

John has studied with a variety of other musicians and educators, such as Jeremy Doody in Red Deer, Jim Head in Edmonton, Brad Turner, Jared Burrows, Kofi J.S. Gbolonyo, Grace McNab, Bradshaw Pack, Ron Samworth, and more from Capilano University in North Vancouver.
