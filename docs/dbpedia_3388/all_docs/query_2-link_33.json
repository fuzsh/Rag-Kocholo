        "text": "John Scott, who has died aged 59 of a heart attack, was a world-class organist and gifted choir trainer. Since 2004 he had been organist and director of music of Saint Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue, New York, and before that of St Paul’s Cathedral, London.\n\nHis association with St Paul’s began in 1978, as assistant organist both there and at Southwark Cathedral, south of the River Thames, and he also accompanied the Bach Choir, conducted by David Willcocks (1979-91). As organist and director of music at St Paul’s from 1990, John made many recordings with the choir for the Hyperion label, and directed it in services for the 100th birthday of the Queen Mother, the victims of 9/11, and Queen Elizabeth’s Golden Jubilee in 2002, which he marked with his own anthem, Behold, O God, Our Defender.\n\nA man of deep faith and quiet integrity, John cared about the liturgy, set exacting standards and achieved a rare quality of performance: every service was important. Many of the singers he guided went on to become professionals, while Alastair Cook went on to captain England at cricket. John’s organ concert cycles at St Paul’s included music by César Franck, Dietrich Buxtehude and JS Bach.\n\nHe often found the hierarchical nature of St Paul’s frustrating, feeling that musicians should be left alone to do what they do best. On his departure, he was appointed LVO (Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order).\n\nOnce in New York, John built on the reputation of the Saint Thomas Choir of Men and Boys as the leading Anglican choral ensemble in the US, established through their recordings, tours and live webcasts. He made every member of the choir feel part of the whole, raising the standard to a level not previously thought possible.\n\nHis appearances as a soloist at the BBC Proms included Julius Reubke’s Sonata on the 94th Psalm (1977) and Alun Hoddinott’s Organ Concerto (1979). Last year, he played in the concert marking the return to service of the refurbished organ at the Royal Festival Hall in London. A fortnight before his death, he gave the premiere of Anthony Powers’ O Gott, Du Frommer Gott at the Three Choirs festival in Hereford Cathedral, and then undertook a recital tour of mainland Europe before returning to New York. His organ recordings include the two organ sonatas of Edward Elgar and the complete organ works of Mendelssohn and Maurice Duruflé.\n\nJohn was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, to Gavin, a general physician, and Hetty (nee Murphy). As a boy he was a chorister at Wakefield Cathedral and while still at Queen Elizabeth grammar school gained the diplomas of the Royal College of Organists and won prizes. As a teenager, he would regularly accompany Wakefield Cathedral Choir: before one concert in a local church, the organist there described the instrument as “rubbish”, but John made it sound so good that the campaign to have it replaced was put back by years.\n\nAs organ scholar at St John’s College, Cambridge (1974-78), he worked with the outstanding choir trainer George Guest. His organ teachers were Jonathan Bielby, Ralph Downes and Gillian Weir, and he won the Manchester International Organ Competition (1978) and the Leipzig International Bach Competition (1984).\n\nJohn co-edited two volumes of choral music for Oxford University Press: Ash Wednesday to Easter for Choirs and Epiphany to All Saints for Choirs. These and his edition of The St Paul’s Psalter are used in churches throughout the world.\n\nIn 1979 John married Jane Lumsden, and they divorced in 2010. In 2013 he married Lily Ardalan, who is expecting a baby. He is survived by Lily, and by Alex and Emma, the children of his first marriage."
