        "text": "This guide is designed to provide anything from condensed biographies of well known ragtime composers to fairly comprehensive ones with as much known data as possible on lesser known composers, some of who have never had much of anything written on them in the past. Each biography here was written from scratch by myself, Bill Edwards, based on original research, and each includes that composer's known repertoire of both published and unpublished tunes. Some of the larger biographies are not always complete, as there are many outstanding detailed books on some composers collectively and individually. They are meant to provide more insight for the ragtime novice, or perhaps a quick reference or new point of view for those well versed in the genre. In the case of songs or collaborations, other people are noted in brackets [ ] or through numbers with a key listed at the end. The dates listed are either known dates of composition, copyright or publication, except where noted. Some of these represent the only current resource available on certain composers. For further information I may suggest certain reference sources, and for an overall view of good references currently available or tucked away in your local library, please check out my Bibliography and Sources page. I am not trying to duplicate the efforts of anybody else, just enhance some of what is already available in a concise and easy to access format. Comments are always welcome. More complete reference sources for any particular point are available by request. Please inform me if you intend to quote any of these articles in part or in full, and make sure there is proper attribution out of respect for my time and financial investment in the research on these individuals."
