Now, additionally, he along with all live musicians, now have the challenge of trying to maneuver through an unfamiliar world to safely entertain and bring smiles to audiences, including the elderly, once again!\n\no o o o o o\n\nJOHN IS DOING A REMARKABLY GREAT JOB - The comments we have heard are: \"If we didn't know what happened to him, we wouldn't be able to tell!\" and \"His voice is better than ever!\n\n....................THANK YOU!\n\nIN THE MEANTIME - HE IS BOOKING AND PERFORMING NOW WHENEVER YOU WANT GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, AND IS CURRENTLY ONLY UP TO ABOUT HALF OF THE SHOWS HE NORMALLY HAS BOOKED BY THIS TIME OF YEAR...\n\nSO IF YOU HAVE A HEART TO HELP SUPPORT THE FAMILY THROUGH THIS SO FAR 4-YEAR TRAUMA - IT IS HIGHLY APPRECIATED!\n\nTHANK YOU!!!"
