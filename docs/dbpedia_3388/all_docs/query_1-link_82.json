        "text": "A historic lineup including Jimi Hendrix’s bass player, a co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, a Rolling Stone, and a member of an iconic soul group will perform at the Maui Music & Food Experience concert at the MACC on Sept., 7, in a benefit for survivors of the Maui fires.\n\nThe impressive array of artists features legendary Jimi Hendrix Experience/Band of Gypsys’ bassist Billy Cox, who played at Woodstock and on Maui with Hendrix in 1970, Maui resident Mick Fleetwood, Ernie Isley of The Isley Brothers, and bassist Daryl Jones, who has recorded and toured with the Rolling Stones since 1993.\n\n“This event is another example that is pivotal as we go into the first anniversary of the devastating fire to remind those near and far from the island of Maui, of the loss of life, homes, businesses and the ability to earn a living for so many survivors,” says Fleetwood Mac’s legendary drummer Mick Fleetwood.\n\n“Speaking from the personal loss of two businesses, my restaurant Fleetwood’s on Front St., that also sustained a loss of two employees and their family in the fire, and my retail store House of Fleetwood on Front Street below the restaurant, I like many others from the musicians dedicating their time, along with so many organizers and donors are passionate on one result – raising funds and awareness for the survivors of the Lahaina fire.”\n\nAlso on board for the MACC show are Bernard Fowler, who has sung backing vocals with the Rolling Stones since 1989, blues/soul artist Ronnie Baker Brooks, blues guitarist Wayne Baker Brooks, longtime Bob Dylan band guitarist Charlie Sexton, harmonica player Howard Levy (Paul Simon, Bela Fleck), Ivan Julian of Richard Hell and the Voidoids, guitarist Isaiah Sharkey (Paul Simon, John Mayer), keyboardist Ivan Neville (Rolling Stones, Bonnie Raitt), and The Nicholas Tremulis 4 from Chicago.\n\nHawaii-based artists taking part include Marty Dread, Jason Arcilla, Gretchen Rhodes, Gail Swanson, Sheryl Renee, Brian Santana. Keni Blue, Ron Artis II, Naiwi Teruya, Keali’i Lum, Paul West, Vene Chun, and Roger McKinley.\n\n“I’m very aware of some of the greats that are here to play and support,” says Fleetwood about the huge ensemble of musicians involved. “Sitting in with any of these artists will be a pleasure.”\n\nPresented by the Hua Momona Foundation, besides the MACC show, the Maui Music & Food Experience will also include a “Night at the Farm” intimate dinner at Hua Momona Farms on Sept. 5, and the “Celebration at the Ritz-Carlton” gala at the Ritz-Carlton Maui, Kapalua on Sept. 6.\n\nThe MACC event will feature music outside in the courtyard and in the Castle Theater, which will include a celebration of Jimi Hendrix’s legendary concert in Olinda.\n\n“How cool is it that Billy Cox is coming back to Maui to play this show having played here with Jimi in 1970,” said Fleetwood, who saw the guitar virtuoso the first time he performed in London.\n\n“I remember the first show Jimi Hendrix played at a private club where many of the guitar greats such as Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck attended. Everyone had heard there was a new gunslinger in town. Many of us were stunned by what we heard and saw.”\n\nHendrix later jammed with Fleetwood Mac and even attended a rehearsal with the band. “Memories to hold dear,” says Fleetwood.\n\nA great new Fleetwood Mac compilation “Best of 1969-1974,” has just been released covering the early days of the band before it was transformed with addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. “The compilation consists of many songs from albums\n\nthat came before the ‘Rumours’ era,” he explains. “I’m happy and proud to see this available.”\n\nMick has been dealing with the loss of two dear friends, British blues legend John Mayall and long time Maui resident, drummer Paul Marchetti, who worked with him for many years and was loved in our musical community.\n\n“I am still absorbing the loss of two musicians and friends very recently,” he says. “Our fellow drummer at the restaurant, local band musician, and dear friend Paul Marchetti. Paul was one of the premier players on this island, well known and respected near and far. As a fellow drummer, my hat was always tipped at his amazing talent that he shared with so many great players from all over the world.\n\n“John Mayall from my home country, England, passed away as well. John was a guiding light to so many of us young English players. His Blues Breakers band led the three of us, Peter Green, John McVie and myself, to form Fleetwood Mac in 1967. He is owed much gratitude from so many in the musical world. I’m still absorbing the loss of both of these friends.”\n\nNew music featuring Fleetwood drumming with ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro on a new album called “Blues Experience,” will be out in October. An amazing video was released on YouTube featuring the musicians rocking out on the classic “Rollin’ and Tumblin’,” made popular by Muddy Waters and later Cream. The album also includes covers of “Cause We Ended as Lovers” by Jeff Beck and Stevie Wonder, Procul Harems’ “Whiter Shade of Pale,” and Neil Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World.”\n\n“It was a thrill to put out a blues based selection of instrumental versions of some famous old classics played as only he can do,” says Fleetwood. “Creating fresh magic in every title. As we all know, one brilliant player.”\n\nExcited to be taking part in the historic benefit for Lahaina, he says, “I have only one hope that after these events, memories and renewed awareness are long lasting into the future of this island’s healing process.”\n\nMore information about the three-day September benefit is available at: www.mauimusicandfoodexperience.org."
