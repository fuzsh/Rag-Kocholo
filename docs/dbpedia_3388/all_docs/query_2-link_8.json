        "text": "John Scott is an incredibly talented showman who performs at events and on cruise ships with hits from the 30's to modern day. From the sounds of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Cash to Michael Buble' and modern favorites. He also entertains by playing the saxophone and guitar. John enjoys putting smiles on the faces of audience members at weddings, birthday parties, wineries, restaurants, retirement centers, cruise ships, and your next event. You'll have trouble sitting still as he'll transport you back in time with the sounds of your favorite era, have you up on your feet dancing, or clapping along. His experience goes back to when he was 12 years old and picked up his first guitar to owning his own DJ business and up-to-the present day solo musicianship. John Scott is a true entertainer who typically shows up in a tux and makes several fast wardrobe changes throughout the show with the use of hats, jackets and other props. John is located in the St. Louis, Missouri area but loves to tour the country and performs a 4-week tour each year to Wisconsin and Michigan as well as days out on a cruise ship entertaining."
