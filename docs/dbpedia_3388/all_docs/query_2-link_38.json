        "text": "This is such sad news. John Scott was one of the very top organists in the world without a doubt. I heard him play two recitals at the RAH a few years back. I remember saying to my father who was with me that this was the best recital I had ever heard and that I doubted even then that it would ever be bettered. It still hasn't and I doubt it ever will. it was one of those rare moments you wish you could have captured.\n\nCondolences to all his family but the wonderful memories will remain.\n\nI echo, sadly, the sentiments expressed here.\n\nHow I wish now that I had gone to John's recital at Hereford Cathedral during this year's 3 Choirs Festival. It was a date which was mildly inconvenient for me and to my regret I gave in to laziness.\n\nWe are fortunate to have many recordings and his Dupré and Duruflé discs from St. Paul's Cathedral for me represent the pinnacle of the organist's art, especially the former which is accompanying this keyboard as I type.\n\nHow I wish now that I had gone to John's recital at Hereford Cathedral during this year's 3 Choirs Festival. It was a date which was mildly inconvenient for me and to my regret I gave in to laziness.\n\nI went to this recital, having heard some of the St John's choral scholars speak of him in glowing terms when I studied there - quite a number had been choristers at St Paul's under his direction. It did not disappoint. The playing was superlative, though I wasn't all that keen on the Lemare that he played - a bit cheesy for my taste!\n\nWhat impressed me particularly was his kindness and patience in talking to the very long line of people (including me!) waiting to speak to him after the recital. To me, this spoke volumes about his character. I feel honoured to have met him.\n\nVery sad to hear this. John Scott was one of the organists I had always wanted to hear play live: sadly I will never get that chance. Although there are a few clips of him on YouTube there is nothing quite like hearing an organist play live.\n\nI would echo the sentiments written at the end of pcnd5584's post which, for those of us unfamiliar with Latin, translate as:\n\nMay the angels lead you into paradise;\n\nthe martyrs receive you in your coming,\n\nand may they guide you into the holy city Jerusalem.\n\nA choir of angels welcome you,\n\nand with Lazarus once poor\n\nyou have eternal rest.\n\nWhether that is taken from an anthem or not I have no idea. But how I wish I had been aware of the concert at Hereford: the trip from Bristol would doubtless have been worth it and I would certainly have made it.\n\nThere is a very good and quite entertaining obituary in today's edition of \"The Times\" which, for those who haven't heard of it, is a newspaper here in the UK: sadly you can't view said obituary unless you have a subscription. No doubt Choir & Organ will come up with something lengthy in its next edition. Meanwhile, in addition to the websites of St. Thomas (New York) and St. Pauls Cathedral (London) the websites of Hereford Cathedral, Wakefield Cathedral and the 2015 Three Choirs Festival also carry tributes. Nothing on the website of St. John's, Cambridge: looks like they haven't got round to posting anything yet - or haven't heard.\n\nThe one from St. Pauls can be found at https://www.stpauls.co.uk/news-press/latest-news/john-scott-st-pauls-organist-and-musical-genius-dies-aged-59 and includes a YouTube clip at the end of JS conducting choir, orchestra and congregation doing \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\".\n\nRIP John.\n\nDave\n\nI am surprised that there are apparently few obituaries to John Scott, given his status as one of the world's leading organists. There is a piece on Choir & Organ's website but it looks to have been cobbled together. Is it too much to expect that the BBC will perhaps do a tribute to John? I listened earlier today to one of his Hyperion recordings I have in my collection of works by Dupre. Made in 1998 at St Paul's, It was magic listening to it again.\n\nIn an earlier post John Mander mentioned John Scott's recital at Christ Church, Spitalfields only a few weeks ago, and coincidentally I have just finished reading Andrew Benson-Wilson's review of it in the latest Organists' Review which arrived only yesterday. He describes more of the instrument than the pieces played, but he includes a link to his website where he amplifies the latter aspect:\n\nhttp://andrewbensonwilson.org/2015/07/01/john-scott-gala-opening-recital/\n\nThis might provide some leads, especially in the direction of the Georgian organ music in which John Scott was interested.\n\nBridge's Adagio in E might also be appropriate for the occasion, which he himself plays on youtube.\n\nCEP"
