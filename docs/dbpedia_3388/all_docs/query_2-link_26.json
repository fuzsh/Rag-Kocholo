        "text": "His music weaves between realism and spirituality with a sound that draws from his southern roots. Having grown up in a small town in Georgia indelibly shapes his musical approach. His influences range from rock and roll names that you would know, some punk and metal bands that you might not know, chamber music, folk, indie, and jazz... essentially from Tom Waits to Taylor Swift. It's pretty much all over the place. He has a philosophy that every genre has good to offer, and he strives to deliver the good from a Folk/Americana perspective.\n\nJohn Scott is not touring right now, but he is working on releasing a catalog of both old and new songs that represent the range of his writing styles. Seeing him live will be most accessible if you follow him on social media and/or his youtube channel. If this changes click on the \"tour\" link to find info on shows.\n\nCheck out Jordan's channel and subscribe. Here's some of his reflections as a content creator as well as footage of the beginnings and process of my new EP."
