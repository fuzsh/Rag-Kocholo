Also featured will be Scott's newly written score for French director Georges Méliès' amusing 1914 space fantasy short, A Trip to the Moon, conducted to picture.\n\nThe second concert will include the first movement of Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia Antarctica (adapted from his score for the 1948 film, Scott of the Antarctic); \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" by Richard Strauss from 2001, A Space Odyssey (1968); excerpts from Elvira Madigan (1967); \"Adaghietto\" from Symphony No. 5 by Gustav Mahler as featured in the 1971 film version of Death in Venice; and symphonic suites by Scott from his scores for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1997, for TV), Rocket to the Moon (1967), The Final Countdown (1980) and Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984).\n\nThe finale will be a new symphonic suite for orchestra and chorus adapted from Scott's score for Charlton Heston's Antony and Cleopatra (1972), complete with special guest appearances by actors Samantha Eggar, Robert Foxworth and Alan Mandel.\n\n\"We've planned this event specifically to share the magic of film music with the public,\" said Scott. \"Music has a fascinating way of truly making a movie come to life and we hope the audience will walk away with a greater understanding and love of the medium.\"\n\nAs principal sponsor of the HSO, the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra Society – a non-profit public benefit corporation founded by Scott along with development/marketing veteran Hilary Mackendrick – is dedicated to the symphonic presentation of film and television music by contemporary composers. The HSO boasts more than 50 of L.A.'s finest concert and recording musicians. Belinda Broughton serves as Concertmaster.\n\nScott is well-known as a composer for motion pictures and television, and has an incomparable career as jazz and pop music arranger/conductor/player for the likes of Henry Mancini, The Beatles, Cleo Lane, Ravi Shankar and many others. He has composed for symphony, quartet and ballet, and has conducted recordings for many of London's leading orchestras, including the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. He has also conducted several prestigious European orchestras including the Munich Symphony Orchestra and the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestras.\n\nThe HSO concerts begin at 8 p.m. Proceeds will benefit the HSO Society's community educational programs. Tickets are now available through Ticketmaster on-line or by phone (213) 480-3232.\n\nThe International Cultural Center, Scottish Rite Auditorium is located at 4357 Wilshire Boulevard in the Hancock Park community of Los Angeles.\n\nFor more information about the concert series and the HSO, visit http://www.hollywoodsymphonyorchestrasociety.org.\n\n©2005 Marilee Bradford"
