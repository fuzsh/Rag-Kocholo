It’s marked by both great traditions and great changes. Classical music is listened to, played, and loved on every continent, in almost every country. Just as the symphonies and musicians who give us their performances have been supported by their audiences, the stations that are devoted to classical music are also supported by listeners, by people like you. Your support is unique!\n\nPlease do your part today and donate to The Classical Station. You can give securely online, on our app, via the United States Postal Service at The Classical Station, PO Box 828, Wake Forest, NC 27588, or by calling 800-556-5178 anytime. Thank you for your support.\n\nOn June 19, we observe the birthday of Czech composer Johann Stamitz (1717-1757). Jan Václav Antonín Stamitz was a composer who straddled the Baroque and Classical eras.\n\nPhoto: Unknown Author, Fair Use, Public Domain, Wikimedia Commons\n\nTuesday, June 18, 2024\n\nEvery Sunday evening on Preview! at 7 p.m. Eastern, we air a short interview with musicians about their new recordings.

Dr. Thalben-Ball was a brilliant concert organist and held the post of Organist of London’s Temple Church for over sixty years. John Scott was Organist of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London for twenty-six years. In 2004 he became the Organist and Director of Music of St. Thomas Church, New York, which post he held until his untimely death on August 12, 2015.\n\nPhoto of John Scott by Joseph A. Vitacco"
