        "text": "John Scott, an esteemed organist and choirmaster who held prestigious posts in London and New York, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 59.\n\nThe cause was cardiac arrest, according to an announcement on the website of St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue, where he was organist and director of music.\n\nA day before he died at Mount Sinai Roosevelt Hospital, Mr. Scott had returned from what was to be the first leg of a European tour that included recitals in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. He was to have performed again in Germany on Aug. 28 and then in Denmark and Switzerland.\n\nMr. Scott played at the Boston Early Music Festival in June. His last American appearance was a Bach recital at St. Thomas on June 20.\n\nHe was perhaps best known to New York audiences for his performances with the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys, which he trained meticulously and directed passionately in concert. His annual performances of Handel’s “Messiah” with the choir and the period-instrument band Concert Royal were invariably regarded as among the finest in the city.\n\nHis last major performances with the choir and Concert Royal were of Bach’s “St. Matthew Passion” in March and Handel’s “Israel in Egypt” in May.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
