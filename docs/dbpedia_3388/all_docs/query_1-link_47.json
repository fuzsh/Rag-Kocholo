        "text": "The 1960s were a pretty good decade for Gregory Peck, at least the first part. As he entered his fifties, Peck was the rare youthful Adonis who aged gradually rather than dramatically into a mix of paternal roles and sophisticated action films. Other hunks of his period – Kirk Douglas and William Holden, for instance – withered into stately raisins, while Burt Lancaster and Robert Mitchum began to look grey and grandfatherly. But, sort of like Tom Cruise, Peck was playing the kinds of roles in his 50s that he could have played in his 20s and 30s. Atticus Finch, for instance, is not very old in Harper Lee’s novel as a widower with young kids. But Peck looks so absurdly young in his breakthrough movies like Spellbound, The Keys to the Kingdom, and Duel in the Sun, that he always maintained a boyish figure, even in his autumn years.\n\nAfter 1966’s Arabesque (a winning, breezy, globehopping Stanley Donen thriller a la Charade), Peck’s next films were fairly uninteresting. During this time, he became President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Lyndon Johnson and was an elder statesman for movies as an industry: he had even been offered, by Johnson, an ambassadorship to Ireland. Peck was an eloquent liberal voice and always had been, standing up to McCarthism from day one, and making Richard Nixon’s famous enemies list. So by 1970, it was to be expected that the 54-year-old Peck would either recede from acting or move into politics, or at least relax into roles that didn’t require much of him.\n\nWhy, then, was the supreme good guy Peck playing a bombastic Josef Mengele in The Boys in Brazil in 1978? What made Peck sign on to The Omen, a seemingly schlocky but highly successful horror movie about Damien the little boy antichrist? A Scottish outlaw in Billy Two Hats? Peck worked sparingly in the 1970s before pretty much retiring in the 80s, and never once with the emerging figures of the New Hollywood. But he stretched himself in ways that let his graceful persona to come undone in movies that didn’t exactly show his range (that was never really his thing), at least recognized the way that his icon formed in the 40s and 50s could clash against the more cynical and dark backdrop of the Watergate era.\n\nJohn Frankenheimer’s 1970 I Walk the Line is a rich example of what Peck was willing to do. As the movie opens, Peck is a small-town Southern sheriff and family man who is soft-spoken, noble, and respected. He’s a greatest generation-type, possessing an easy confidence yet not much of an inner life. He even resembles the relaxed and uncomplicated lawman Andy Griffith played on his show: not so much a warrior as a capable custodian who mostly deals with neighbors’ trees and hillbilly stills. Given the title and the theme of the stern Johnny Cash song that gives it that name, we would assume that this would be a modern western about the lawman/sentinel who has to defend his sleepy town: High Noon or any Wyatt Earp story. A few years later, Walking Tall would become a box-office smash by exploiting this same small-town milieu transplanting the Wild West lawman mythos. And Peck is, I have always argued, one of the most underrated of the Western stars with credits like Yellow Sky, The Gunfighter, and The Bravados. But that’s not I Walk the Line: it’s about Peck’s failure, and perhaps the waning status of his generation.\n\nThe shift in tone happens almost immediately when he pulls Tuesday Weld and her kid brother over for reckless driving. He’s got an obvious attraction to Weld, the oldest daughter of a family of bootleggers who has taken over matriarchal duties. It’s never quite clear how old Weld is, but in really life she was 27, half as old as Peck. And Peck falls hard for her, baffled by a desire that he thought he’d never feel again. While he certainly was successful in more prominent and upstanding roles, Peck has never been better in these scenes where he finds himself wandering into trouble.\n\nAfter her breakthrough as the unattainable Thalia Menninger in Dobie Gillis, Weld had spent the 60s playing sex kittens (literally; she was in a movie called Sex Kittens Go to College). She riffed on that image brilliantly in late period pitch-black comedies like Lord Love a Duck and Pretty Poison. That respect carried over to her being cast in a pretty high-profile adaptation of Joan Didion’s Play It As It Lays in 1971.In I Walk the Line, she seems like a naïve and bubbly femme fatale who is sort of surprised at herself for making this quiet, tough family man feel so much. After he begins his fling with Weld’s Alma McCain, he’s given over to dark moods and angry outbursts and this leads to a lot of confusion by everyone he encounters, most of all his put-upon wife Estelle Parsons (three years off of Bonnie and Clyde). But as beautiful as Weld is, she never really gives Peck a clear reason to love her. She’s more devoted to the maternal role she plays for her misfit family than to him. Weld is remarkable in this role, playing a rustically lovely, unsophisticated young woman who wins over Peck mostly by being herself. If this seems like a Weld lovefest, it’s because she was also in maybe my favorite movie of all time, Michael Mann’s Thief.\n\nIt’s to Frankenheimer’s credit that Alma’s uncultured family of bootleggers aren’t brutes. At one point, Peck makes an argument to a zealous “federal” that they might be breaking the law, but enforcing that law causes more problems than it solves. They’re not not exactly good people, but their criminal ways don’t really hurt anyone except perhaps those who buy their booze, and this career keeps them from worse things. This gives the movie an unsuspected moral and emotional complexity. Peck clearly wants to feel something meaningful, and Weld’s often vacant but decent bootlegger’s daughter becomes the shape his desires take. We assume, because we’ve seen this kind of movie before, that Weld will leadeth Peck unto evil, but Peck is clearly facilitating his own self-destruction.\n\nThe film ends on a stark note, with no clear path of redemption for the sheriff who has been involved with the coverup of the death of his own deputy and is madly in love with a woman who seemed to be using him to ensure the protection of her family. Cash’s song “I Walk the Line” is most obviously about marital fidelity (“I keep a close watch on this heart of mine” / “because you’re mine, I walk the line”), and the film that shares the title is about a man who gives up that “close watch” almost immediately.\n\nAt the beginning of the 42nd Academy Awards, Peck – then the President of the Academy – opens the ceremony with typical scripted remarks about the power of cinema and the integrity of the voting process. He then turns to a short bit about the “freedom of the screen” and the pertinent questions it provokes, a fitting one considering that the X-rated Midnight Cowboy would win the Oscar that night (though John Wayne won Best Actor, sort of balancing things out). What audiences might not have known is that this regal figure would be part of a movie later that year that has a dark sexual energy and seems prompted by the melancholy and loathing of the post-Nixon late 1960s. A month after Peck’s speech, the National Guard would kill four unarmed protesters at Kent State university.\n\nThe two most significant pieces of pop culture about Southern sheriffs in the 1960s were The Andy Griffith Show and In the Heat of the Night. The former is one of the most enduring and beloved family sitcoms ever made, the latter won Best Picture and is generally seen as a watershed movie about racial representation. In the Heat of the Night depicts a sheriff coming to terms with his racial prejudice in the pursuit of justice; The Andy Griffith Show only had one black actor in one episode with a speaking part. While southern sheriffs like Bull Connor were using uncommon brutality against people of color, these documents were humanizing them. As much as I’ve always loved the show, it’s always struck me as a discordant note that the antics of Andy Griffith’s kindly cornpone sheriff might appear on the same night that you found out about police beatings in Selma or Philadelphia, Mississippi or even Newark. I Walk the Line also doesn’t take up race as a topic, though the general liberalism of Peck’s character toward bootleggers suggests he might have handled it differently. Nonetheless, it’s a searing portrayal of the sheriff’s emptiness, haunted sensitivity, and capability for swift, unwarranted violence that takes the form of “justice.”\n\nGregory Peck is not usually discussed as an actor who took many chances, often starring in safe box office hits where his name above the title signaled an enjoyable evening. But I Walk the Line shows him at his best, taking off the armor of his regal bearing and playing a man whose boredom leads him to one bad decision after another, never redeeming him with a heroic end or a return to values. For a man who you never hear anything bad about, who combined stately grace and obvious gifts with a sense of moral responsibility, it’s a brave turn."
