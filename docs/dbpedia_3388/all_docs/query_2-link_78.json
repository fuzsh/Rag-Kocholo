        "text": "John Scott, who received his earliest musical training as a chorister at Wakefield Cathedral, gained the diplomas of the Royal College of Organists while still at school, winning major prizes. As an Organ Scholar of St John’s College, Cambridge he was Assistant to Dr George Guest and studied with Dame Gillian Weir. On leaving Cambridge he became Assistant Organist at St Paul’s and Southwark cathedrals, becoming Sub-Organist of St?Paul’s in 1985, and Organist and Director of Music in 1990. After a twenty-six-year association with St Paul’s he took up the post of Organist and Director of Music at St Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue, New York in the summer of 2004, there directing the renowned men and boys choir. A first-prize winner at the Manchester International Organ Competition (1978) and the Leipzig J.S. Bach Competition (1984), he has performed in five continents, premiered many new works written for him, and worked with various specialist ensembles. Lately he has given concerts in Disney Hall, Los Angeles, Birmingham Symphony Hall, Gloucester Cathedral, Cologne Cathedral, St Bavo in Haarlem and Notre Dame in Paris, and in 2007, the composer’s anniversary year, performed the complete organ works of Dieterich Buxtehude in a series of ten recitals at St Thomas, Fifth Avenue. John Scott is a Past President of the Incorporated Association of Organists."
