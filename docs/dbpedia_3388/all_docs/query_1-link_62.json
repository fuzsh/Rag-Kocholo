        "text": "From To Kill A Mockingbird to The Boys From Brazil, Gregory Peck seems to have run the gamut of great film to the B-movies that dreams are made of.\n\nLet's discuss all of Gregory's film moments: best, worst and intriguing.\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing what you all have to say. I've only seen about 5 of his films so I'd love to learn more.\n\nI discovered the 1956 film \"Man In The Gray Flannel Suit\" a couple of weeks ago, thanks to a double showing on Talking Pictures TV. First time, I missed the opening hour or so, and found it curious yet intruiging. So I made sure to catch the repeat and see it from the beginning (which of course is quite vital!).\n\nVery handsome fellow. Jennifer Jones was appealing too. I enjoyed the opening scenes in their home, which played out like a quirky comedy before the real heart of the story begins.\n\nAnd those trains. Whew. Gorgeous.\n\nEG.\n\nI bought On the Beach not too long ago. I like his speaking voice and like Eric said, above, very handsome fellow.\n\nI don't know if I've ever seen Boys From Brazil (the phrase is so well known, Bolsanaro brings it to mind) but it reminds me of The Chairman. I think I once had that soundtrack album. Never seen the movie.\n\nMaybe TCM does a package on him?\n\nThe Gunfighter is my favourite Peck film. Always thought Fonda would've made a better Atticus, but I love him in Mockingbird too - and Spellbound, The Omen, Twelve O'Clock High, Gentlemen's Agreement, Grey Flannel Suit, Yellow Sky, Roman Holiday, Cape Fear, Arabesque, Paradine Case. Some, I haven't seen. Night People looks interesting. I liked him in The Old Gringo, but didn't like the film - same with several other films, like The Bravados. Saw Behold a Pale Horse the other day and quite liked that... and I like Moby Dick too!\n\nRegarding Moby Dick, I always believed the Orson Wells and Peck roles should have been reversed -That Orson Wells would have made a better Ahab and Gregory Peck would have made a better preacher. But of course, the preacher role was too small for a star like Peck.\n\nMirage. My all-time favorite Peck film. Edward Dmytryk's homage to Hitchcock with a Quincy Jones score and an excellent Peter Stone script. Coincidentally, I happened to be thinking about this film today as I walked past the building that was used as the Peck character's apartment building. (Great location shooting in the city. After I retire I just might take the film around on an iPad and check out the locations and see how they've changed since the mid-1960s.) I have a DVD version and a DVD copy sourced from laserdisc. I have been wanting to see which one is better. I should do that soon. I don't think there is a quality blu-ray release of the film.\n\nNot sure if the whole film is here, but check out the first 15 minutes or so and you'll be hooked.\n\nSugar. Missed that one!\n\nOne of my favorites but I can't think any specific film to single out for praise or as a favorite. He was surprisingly good maybe as a Nazi in The Boys From Brazil, but of course I always liked him as a heroic character best!"
