        "text": "One of the best times to be a sports blogger is when you have to proverbially tear up the story you had mentally written. That is, when it is in this direction. All too many times this year, I’ve had a triumphant story prepared and had to throw it away and write about a frustrating loss.\n\nThere is no scale or meter on these things. These comeback wins aren’t destined to balance out over time. But it sure does feel good to finally have won one of these. It doesn’t hurt to do it against the Cardinals either. Is this the first one of these since the pair of comebacks against the White Sox? Certainly fun to crush the dreams of your rivals.\n\nThere’s a little bit of a tradition in this space to walk you through the WPA on these comebacks. When Seiya Suzuki popped out to start the bottom of the ninth with the Cubs down two, the Cubs’ chances of winning were down to 4.5 percent. This is always the important time to remind you that those numbers aren’t weighted to account for facing a good team or an All-Star closer like Ryan Helsley. 33 of 35 saves coming in and a 2.15 ERA is imposing, as is stuff that dials up to 100. April 25, 2023 was the last time Helsley allowed three runs in an appearance.\n\nCody Bellinger homered for the second time in his last three. That cut the deficit to one. At that, the Cubs were up to an 11.2 percent chance of winning. Isaac Paredes grounded out. The Cubs’ chances of winning with two outs in the ninth, the bases empty and down one were down to 4,7 percent.\n\nNico Hoerner singled and stole second, the Cubs were up to a 14.3 percent chance of winning. A suddenly hot Dansby Swanson doubled and tied the game. The Cubs were now up to a 60.8 percent chance of winning. And then Mike Tauchman pinch hit and drove in the winning run. Three two-out hits and two runs to steal a win.\n\nTwo straight wins. One a blowout and the other a walk-off, one-run win. That’s a fair bit of a spectrum. So much of being a Cubs fan has me wanting to fall into this and get excited. But this team does not allow me to get too far into that. So let’s just enjoy the win and not try to find the bigger story or read too much into this.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I will hat tip to yesterday’s recap. In that one, I pointed out how consistently this team has come up empty and failed to capitalize on momentum. The Cubs had five hits in the first eight innings. They drew one walk and so it wasn’t super surprising with that kind of output that they only had two runs over eight innings.\n\nWith that, I definitely tip the hat to the team on this one. They definitely failed to carry forward any offensive momentum from Wednesday’s win. But then they came off of the mat in the ninth and stole a win. I’ve been thinking lately how vaguely disappointing Craig Counsell’s first season with the Cubs has been. It’s not even the five games under .500 that the team is. But it is the general lack of games like this. So many times, the Brewers did this sort of thing to the Cubs. I’m hopeful that a combination of lack of familiarity with the team and lack of depth on the bench and in the bullpen has made this difficult.\n\nI’ll finish this portion of this recap with throwing the gauntlet again. It sure would be great if this team could carry any kind of momentum forward to another game. With 51 games left in the season, I’d love to get swept up in the team one or two more times at least.\n\nLet’s find three positives.\n\nCody Bellinger gets my top spot. Two hits, including the big homer in the ninth. He scored twice. A comeback like this takes a number of players, but Cody is definitely a big part of that.\n\nDansby Swanson had a pair of hits, one a double and drew a walk. He had the big RBI to tie the game, his second of the day. He also scored the winning run.\n\nNate Pearson gets a big hat tip as one of unsung heroes of this one. Initially, it looked like his two scoreless innings was just saving the bullpen. But it turns out that keeping the deficit at two ended up being huge and made the comeback possible.\n\nGame 121, August 1: Cubs 5, Cards 4 (53-58)\n\nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\n\nTHREE HEROES:\n\nSuperhero: Dansby Swanson (.573). 2-3, 2B, BB, 2 RBI, R\n\nHero: Mike Tauchman (.392). 1-1, RBI\n\nSidekick: Seiya Suzuki (.135). 2-4, HR, RBI, R\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\nBilly Goat: Pete Crow-Armstrong (-.164). 0-3, DP\n\nGoat: Isaac Paredes (-.151). 0-4\n\nKid: Shōta Imanaga (-.125). 6⅔ IP, 30 batters, 10 H, 4 R, 7 K\n\nWPA Play of the Game: Swanson’s game-tying double (.465)\n\n*Cardinals Play of the Game: Masyn Winn batted with a runner on first with one out in the seventh. He homered, turning a 2-1 lead into a 3-2 deficit. (.360)\n\nCubs Player of the Game:\n\nYesterday’s Winner: Ian Happ received 118 out of 177 votes\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\n\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nSeiya Suzuki +17.5\n\nShōta Imanaga +15.5\n\nBen Brown/Mark Leiter Jr. +11\n\nJameson Taillon/Michael Busch +9\n\nPete Crow-Armstrong -9.5\n\nAdbert Alzolay/Miguel Amaya -10\n\nKyle Hendricks -14\n\nChristopher Morel -20.5\n\n*Swanson up to -1, Tauchman up to +4.5, Suzuki into the solo lead for the second time this year. PCA drops into the bottom five, Paredes down to -4, Imanaga falls to second."
