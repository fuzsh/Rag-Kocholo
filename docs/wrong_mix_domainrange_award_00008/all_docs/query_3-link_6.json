        "text": "On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes, the Nobel Prizes. As described in Nobel’s will one part was dedicated to “the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”. Learn more about the Nobel Prize in Literature from 1901 to 2023.\n\nNumber of Nobel Prizes in Literature\n\n116 Nobel Prizes in Literature have been awarded since 1901. It was not awarded on seven occasions: in 1914, 1918, 1935, 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943.\n\nWhy were the literature prizes not awarded in those years? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.” During World War I and II, fewer Nobel Prizes were awarded.\n\nShared Nobel Prizes in Literature\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has been shared between two individuals on four occasions only. Sharing the Nobel Prize is a more common phenomenon within the other Nobel Prize categories.\n\n1904 – Frédéric Mistral, José Echegaray\n\n1917 – Karl Gjellerup, Henrik Pontoppidan\n\n1966 – Shmuel Agnon, Nelly Sachs\n\n1974 – Eyvind Johnson, Harry Martinson\n\nWhy is the literature prize so seldom divided? The last time was in 1974.\n\nIt probably belongs to the nature of literature. The science prizes are often awarded jointly, as the achievement is jointly, or for doing things that are very close to each other.\n\n(Answer from Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, June 2009-May 2015)\n\nRead more on the subject shared literature prizes:\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature: Nominations and Reports 1901–1950\n\nNumber of Nobel Prize laureates in literature\n\n120 individuals have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature 1901-2023.\n\nList of all literature laureates\n\nYoungest literature laureate\n\nTo date, the youngest literature laureate is Rudyard Kipling, best known for The Jungle Book, who was 41 years old when he was awarded the literature prize in 1907.\n\nOldest literature laureate\n\nThe oldest Nobel Prize laureate in literature to date is Doris Lessing, who was 88 years old when she was awarded the Prize in 2007.\n\nFemale Nobel Prize laureates in literature\n\n17 women have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Swedish author Selma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) was the first woman to be awarded in 1909. Selma Lagerlöf was awarded five years before she was elected to the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize awarding institution responsible for selecting Nobel Prize laureates in literature.\n\n1909 – Selma Lagerlöf\n\n1926 – Grazia Deledda\n\n1928 – Sigrid Undset\n\n1938 – Pearl Buck\n\n1945 – Gabriela Mistral\n\n1966 – Nelly Sachs\n\n1991 – Nadine Gordimer\n\n1993 – Toni Morrison\n\n1996 – Wislawa Szymborska\n\n2004 – Elfriede Jelinek\n\n2007 – Doris Lessing\n\n2009 – Herta Müller\n\n2013 – Alice Munro\n\n2015 – Svetlana Alexievich\n\n2018 – Olga Tokarczuk\n\n2020 – Louise Glück\n\n2022 – Annie Ernaux\n\nList of all female Nobel Prize laureates\n\nTwo people have declined the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nBoris Pasternak, the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature, “Accepted first, later caused by the authorities of his country (Soviet Union) to decline the Prize”.\n\nJean Paul Sartre, the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, declined the prize because he had consistently declined all official honours.\n\nMultiple Nobel Prize laureates in literature\n\nNo one has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature more than once.\n\nMultiple Nobel Prize laureates in other Nobel Prize categories\n\nPosthumous Nobel Prizes in Literature\n\nIn 1931, the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded posthumously to Erik Axel Karlfeldt. From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. Dag Hammarskjöld was also awarded a posthumous prize, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961.\n\nAwarded members of the Swedish Academy\n\nOne particular problem faced during the nomination and selection process for the Nobel Prize in Literature is how to deal with candidates who are members of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize awarding institution responsible for selecting Nobel Prize laureates in literature. All Swedish Nobel Prize laureates in literature before 2011, when Tomas Tranströmer was awarded, were members of the Swedish Academy. In virtually every case it appears that they have declined nomination and a routine has been established, were they are not subjected to the appraisal of either an expert or the Nobel Committee for Literature.\n\nRead more about the process of nomination and selection of literature laureates\n\nSelma Lagerlöf became a member of the Swedish Academy in 1914 after she was awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nVerner von Heidenstam (1916 Nobel Prize in Literature), was a member of the Swedish Academy 1912-1940.\n\nErik Axel Karlfeldt (1931 Nobel Prize in Literature), was a member of the Swedish Academy 1904-1931. Karlfeldt was awarded posthumously.\n\nPär Lagerkvist (1951 Nobel Prize in Literature), was a member of the Swedish Academy 1940-1974.\n\nHarry Martinson and Eyvind Johnson (1974 Nobel Prize in Literature), were members of the Swedish Academy – Martinson 1949-1978 and Johnson 1957-1976.\n\nLiterature laureates with pen-names\n\nSully Prudhomme (pen-name of René François Armand Prudhomme), Anatole France (pen-name of Jacques Anatole Thibault), Wladyslaw Reymont (pen-name of Rejment), Grazia Deledda (pen-name of Grazia Madesani, née Deledda), Pearl Buck (pen-name of Pearl Walsh, née Sydenstricker), Gabriela Mistral (pen-name of Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga), Saint-John Perse (pen-name of Alexis Léger), Giorgos Seferis (pen-name of Giorgos Seferiadis), Pablo Neruda (pen-name of Neftalí Ricardo Reyes Basoalto), Odysseus Elytis (pen-name of Odysseus Alepoudhelis), Mo Yan (pen-name of Guan Moye)\n\nSurprise literature laureate?\n\nMany believe that Winston Churchill was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, but he was actually awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize in Literature. Between 1945 and 1953, Winston Churchill got 21 nominations for the literature prize and two for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nExplore the nomination database for the Nobel Prizes\n\nAwarded for a particular literary work\n\nWhile the Nobel Prize in Literature is for a writer’s life work, there are nine literature laureates for whom the Swedish Academy singled out a specific work for particular recognition.\n\nMikhail Sholokhov in 1965\n\n“for the artistic power and integrity with which, in his epic of the Don, he has given expression to a historic phase in the life of the Russian people” Ernest Hemingway in 1954\n\n“for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style” Roger Martin Du Gard in 1937\n\n“for the artistic power and truth with which he has depicted human conflict as well as some fundamental aspects of contemporary life in his novel-cycle Les Thibault” John Galsworthy in 1932\n\n“for his distinguished art of narration which takes its highest form in The Forsyte Saga” Thomas Mann in 1929\n\n“principally for his great novel, Buddenbrooks, which has won steadily increased recognition as one of the classic works of contemporary literature” Wladyslaw Reymont in 1924\n\n“for his great national epic, The Peasants” Knut Hamsun in 1920\n\n“for his monumental work, Growth of the Soil” Carl Spitteler in 1919\n\n“in special appreciation of his epic, Olympian Spring” Theodor Mommsen in 1902\n\n“the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, A history of Rome”\n\nNominations – a well kept secret\n\nThe nominations and the opinions written by the members of the Nobel Committee in Literature each year are kept secret for 50 years.\n\nSully Prudhomme, Rudolf Eucken, Paul Heyse, Rabindranath Tagore, Sinclair Lewis, Theodor Mommsen, Luigi Pirandello, Pearl Buck, Bertrand Russell and William Faulkner are some of the authors who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature after being nominated in one year only.\n\nNumber of nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature each year (1901-1950)\n\nSearchable nomination database (1901-1965)\n\nWho did the Nobel Prize laureates in literature nominate?\n\nThe Swedish author August Strindberg (1849-1912) was nominated once in 1911 by Nathan Söderblom (but the nomination arrived too late and was retrieved).\n\nThe Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was nominated for 12 years for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1929, the Nobel Committee for Medicine engaged an expert who came to the conclusion that a further investigation in Freud was not necessary, since Freud’s work was of no proven scientific value. What is less known, perhaps, is that Romain Rolland, Nobel Prize laureate in literature 1915, and an acquaintance of Freud, nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1936.\n\nList of nominations made by Nobel Prize laureates in literature\n\nThe Nobel Prize medal in literature\n\nThe Nobel medal in literature was designed by Swedish sculptor and engraver Erik Lindberg and represents a young man sitting under a laurel tree who, enchanted, listens to and writes down the song of the Muse.\n\nRead more about the Nobel Prize medal in literature\n\nThe Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nEach Nobel Prize diploma is a unique work of art, created by foremost Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount\n\nAlfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 1,702 million) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount for 2023 was set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11.0 million per full Nobel Prize.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize amount\n\n*Why are the individuals and organisations awarded a Nobel Prize called Nobel Prize laureates?\n\nThe word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel (in Latin: Laurus nobilis). In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour – both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.\n\nLinks to more facts on the Nobel Prizes:\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nFacts on the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nFacts on the Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nFacts on all Nobel Prizes\n\nFirst published 5 October 2009."
