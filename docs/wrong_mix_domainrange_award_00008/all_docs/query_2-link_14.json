        "text": "(1891–1974). The most internationally known Swedish writer in the first half of the 20th century was Pär Lagerkvist. He was born in Växjö, Sweden, on May 23, 1891. He attended the University of Uppsala, and lived for a time in Paris, where he became acquainted with avant-garde ideas on literature, politics, and art.\n\nHis first works, Ångest (Anguish, published in 1916), and Kaos (Chaos, 1919) were filled with pessimism that owed much to the tragedy of World War I. There was less pessimism in his writing of the 1920s: Det eviga leendet (The Eternal Smile, 1920), Den lyckliges väg (The Happy Man’s Way, 1921), and Gäst hos verkligheten (The Guest of Reality, 1925), an autobiographical novel. During the next two decades he became preoccupied with the rise of fascist movements in Europe. His novels from this period, Bödeln (The Hangman, 1933), Dvärgen (The Dwarf, 1944), and his most famous work, Barabbas (1950), focused on evil and the abuse of power. His contempt for fascism was also evident in the play Mannen utan själ (The Man Without a Soul, performed in 1936). In the same vein he wrote his most unusual play, Låt människan leva (Let Man Live, 1949), about man’s willingness to judge and destroy his fellows. Lagerkvist was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1951. He died on July 11, 1974."
