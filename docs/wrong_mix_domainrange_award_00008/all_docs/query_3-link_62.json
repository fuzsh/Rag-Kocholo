        "text": "P�r Lagerkvist (May 23, 1891 - July 11, 1974) is a Swedish author who won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1951.\n\nLagerkvist produced poems, plays, novels, stories, and essays of considerable expressive power and influence from his early 20s to his late 70s.\n\nIn this age of cyberspace Lagerkvist is one of those authors that almost exlusively gets five star reveiws at amazon.com.\n\nAmong his central themes was the fundamental question of good and evil, which he examined through such figures as the medieval red-hooded hangman, Barabbas, and the wandering Jew Ahasuerus. As a moralist, he used religious motifs and figures from the Christian tradition without following the doctrines of the Church.\n\nLagerkvist's most famous novel Barabbas (1950) was immediately hailed as a masterwork (by among others fellow Nobel Prize in literature winner Andr� Gide). The novel is based on the story from the Bible; When thief and murderer Barabbas is freed by the people of Judea rather than Jesus of Nazareth, the criminal struggles to understand why he was chosen to live.\n\nFrom the back cover:\n\n\"Its power is the power of a parable, with the same timeless echo.\" -- The New York Times\n\n\"As a parable, Barabbas is open to many interpretations. As a picture of a human soul, with or without parable, it is moving and convincing.\" -- Time\n\n\"Swift, sparing, limpid, and hauntingly intense.\" -- Atlantic Monthly\n\nThe novel was turned into a major motion picture in 1962, starring Anthony Quinn.\n\nNotes on some other works by the author (far from a complete list!):\n\nOne of the author's earliest works is �ngest (Anguish, 1916), a violent and disillusioned collection of poems. His anguish was derived from his fear of death, the World War, and personal crisis. He tried to explore how a person can find a meaningful life in a world where a war can kill millions for very little reason. \"Anguish, anguish is my heritage / the wound of my throat / the cry of my heart in the world.\" (Anguish, 1916.) \"Love is nothing. Anguish is everything / the anguish of living.\" (Love is nothing, 1916.)\n\nTen years later Hj�rtats s�nger (Songs of the Heart) (1926) appeared. This collection of poem is slightly less desperate in its tone and expresses the strive to come to peace with life itself that was to become so prominent in his later works. In Hj�rtats s�nger he wrote: \"Only you, my bosom, is left, / you who can suffer, / you who can feel the deoth of pain / but not compain.\"\n\nHis novella, later adapted for the stage, B�deln (The Hangman, 1933; play, 1934) shows his growing concern with the totalitarianism that began to sweep across Europe in the years prior to World War II.\n\nHis 1944 novel Dv�rgen (The Dwarf), a cautionary tale about evil, was the first to bring him international attention."
