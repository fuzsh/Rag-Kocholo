        "text": "_The Dwarf_ by Pär Lagerkvist\n\nA Review\n\nThe first Nobel Prize for literature was awarded in 1901. Since\n\nthere have been seven years (mostly during wartime) when no prize\n\nwas awarded, that makes a total of 94 awards, one or two of them\n\nshared [1]. Of these 90-plus writers, I have so far read only 21,\n\nplus 6 questionable ones that I’m not sure of reading. Perhaps one\n\nreason I have not read more of them, is that I estimate that about\n\n64 of them wrote in a language other than English … and I tend to\n\navoid translations, and am not well-versed enough in any other\n\nlanguage to read it fluently. In this respect, I am unfortunately\n\nlike many other Americans, who, knowing that they can easily get by\n\nwith English alone, just stay with their own language. And, even\n\nthough the Nobel Laurates include some dubious choices (John\n\nSteinbeck, Toni Morrison) that may be governed more by their liberal\n\nviews than their literary merit, I am sure that I have been turning\n\nmy back on many worthwhile works of literature.\n\nThese musings are prompted by my just having read _The Dwarf_, a\n\nnovel published in 1944 and written by the Swedish writer Pär\n\nLagerkvist (1891-1974), who won the Literature Nobel in 1951. (PL\n\nwas a poet and dramatist, as well as a novelist.) The strong\n\ntranslation (by Alexandra Dick) should encourage me to be less\n\nprejudiced about reading translations in the future! This book was\n\nlent to me by my friend Peter, who may be surprised to see it\n\nreturned to him, after a lapse of a number of years. It came very\n\nhighly praised … perhaps a dangerous situation, since it can lead\n\none to expect so much. As you will see, my enthusiasm is perhaps a\n\nbit more qualified than Peter’s; nevertheless, my reactions are on\n\nthe whole very positive.\n\nThe edition I read was a paperback published by Hill and Wang.\n\nUnlike Forster’s _A Room with a View_, which I read recently and\n\nwhich was sewn in signatures, my copy of _The Dwarf_ was, like most\n\npaperbacks, made with a “perfect” binding, i.e. having the pages\n\nglued in separately. Unfortunately the glue had apparently become\n\nbrittle, so the binding cracked and one page is totally loose.\n\nWell, at least this is a small-format book that can be slid into a\n\npants pocket if necessary … a good attribute for reading while\n\ncommuting on the subway!\n\nSweden … I think of the filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. And regarding\n\nScandinavia more generally, the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius comes\n\nto mind. Both these creators convey, I would say, a dark brooding\n\nquality. (I am embarrassedly not yet much acquainted with the\n\nScandinavians Strindberg or Ibsen, so can’t comment on them.)\n\nLagerkvist definitely fits in to this somber mood, at least with the\n\npresent book. It may also be relevant that _The Dwarf_ was\n\nevidently written during wartime, a period (as is our present time)\n\nwhen a massive struggle was being waged against forces widely felt\n\nto be of great evil.\n\nI can often tell a lot about how I will react to a novel, just by\n\nreading the opening paragraph or two. _The Dwarf_ is no exception.\n\nHere is the first paragraph:\n\nI am twenty-six inches tall, shapely and well\n\nproportioned, my head perhaps a trifle too large. My\n\nhair is not black like the others’, but reddish, very\n\nstiff and thick, drawn back from the temples and the\n\nbroad but not especially lofty brow. My face is\n\nbeardless, but otherwise just like that of other men.\n\nMy eyebrows meet. My bodily strength is considerable,\n\nparticularly if I am annoyed. When the wrestling match\n\nwas arranged between Jehoshaphat and myself I forced him\n\nonto his back after twenty minutes and strangled him.\n\nSince then I have been the only dwarf at this court.\n\nIf you are like me, you were probably rather shocked by the\n\nculmination of this little excerpt! I would also guess, that like\n\nmyself, you might want to read more …\n\nIn the course of reading this book, I became curious enough about\n\ndwarfs (for the plural, “dwarfs” is apparently preferred to\n\n“dwarves”, which surprised me) to seek out more information [2],\n\nwhich I am paraphrasing in this and the following two paragraphs.\n\nIn physiological terms, a “dwarf” is distinguished from a “midget”\n\nby the fact that dwarfs have disproportionate bodies — e.g. a\n\ntoo-large head — whereas midgets are normally proportioned.\n\n(However, the politically correct term to be used for both of these\n\ngroups nowadays, is — ready for this? — “little people”.) Dwarfs\n\noften have normal intelligence and sexual function. In a condition\n\ncalled “progeria”, an individual will remain the size of a normal\n\n5-year-old, but will look like a 60-year-old adult by the time he or\n\nshe is 10!\n\nThe dwarf in folklore: perhaps not surprisingly, this comes mainly\n\nfrom the Scandinavian countries. Dwarfs live inside mountains and\n\nthe lower levels of mines. They are often pictured as grave old\n\nmen, and are generally kindly beings (just think of the seven\n\nexamples in Disney’s _Snow White_).\n\nThe dwarf in history: Back to the early Egyptian Pharaohs, dwarfs\n\nserved as favorites, jesters, and entertainers. The practice of\n\nhaving dwarfs at the royal court was widespread in the Renaissance,\n\nand even persisted into 19th-century Russia. Perhaps the most\n\nfamiliar depictions of these court dwarfs are those by Velazquez,\n\nshowing the dwarfs kept by Philip IV of Spain (ruled 1621-65) [3].\n\nThe Dwarf in PL’s book (let us use a capital “D” for the character)\n\npartakes of some of the above characteristics. His face, like the\n\nprogeria victim’s, has from childhood been full of wrinkles, which\n\nmakes him look very old despite his younger years, and leads him to\n\nthink he may be “descended from a race older than that which now\n\npopulates the world”. He is in the service of a “great and powerful\n\nprince”.\n\nBut in other ways, the Dwarf differs sharply from the physiology,\n\nlegend, or history cited above. He has no body hair, and is\n\nsterile! He cannot smile, and finds laughter “unlovely and\n\ndisfiguring”. Although he can “see in the dark like a mole” (which\n\nfits the folklore), he cannot see the stars, which is strange until\n\nyou think about the symbolic implications of this.\n\nDespite the Dwarf’s social position (which necessitates subservient\n\nstatus), his nature prohibits him from being anything like a jester\n\nor a buffoon, And he is definitely *not* kindly, as you have\n\ndoubtlessly surmised already from the novel’s opening, quoted above.\n\nLike Mr. Spock, of _Star Trek_ fame, he cannot fathom human emotion,\n\nand the resulting complexities of human nature (his view of the love\n\naffair of two of the younger characters is particularly memorable in\n\nits total incomprehension of what is going on). But, unfortunately,\n\nhe is not quite the force for ultimate good that Mr. Spock is! In\n\nfact, he longs for war …\n\nThere is a monolithic aspect to the Dwarf’s nature. Unfortunately\n\nfrom a novelistic point of view, this means lack of character\n\ndevelopment, and a general want of variety as the book progresses.\n\n(Poe’s characters could be unabashedly bent on evil purposes, but of\n\ncourse he wrote short stories, where monotony is not a real\n\nconcern.) PL does however, I think, introduce enough interest of\n\nother kinds, so that this relentlessness of character, and the\n\nresulting uniformity of events, is not a major issue. Here are some\n\nways he keeps the reader from being bored:\n\n== The book is not long! … just 228 pages.\n\n== The novel is told in the first person, and in “diary” form, as if\n\nit were being narrated by the Dwarf as it is happening. This allows\n\nwide swings in mood, compared to, say, if he had been shown as\n\nlooking back after everything had occurred, and writing his\n\nreminiscences.\n\n== Despite the Dwarf’s general alienation from humanity with its\n\nwide spectrum of emotion, there is one character — the Princess —\n\nfor whom his feelings are more complex. He carries notes, for her,\n\nto her lovers, and he vows that he would never betray her, even were\n\nhe to be tortured … though he does not know why.\n\n== As the story progresses, we get more and more of a sense of time\n\nand place. Some figures seem to be identifiable, at least to some\n\nextent, with actual personages in history … though I won’t spoil\n\nyour fun by giving them away here!\n\n== One never (I believe) learns the Dwarf’s name. This, along with\n\nthe extreme nature of his feelings, suggests that (like Heathcliff\n\nin _Wuthering Heights_) he could perhaps be regarded as a force — a\n\npart of human nature — along with being seen as the individual that\n\nhe ostensibly is.\n\n== There is some humor, which provides much needed relief from the\n\nwoeful proceedings. Perhaps there could even have been more.\n\nSpeaking of the Prince, the Dwarf says: “I will not deny that he is\n\na great man; but nobody is great to his dwarf.” This of course\n\nrecalls the familiar saying: “No man is a hero to his valet”.\n\nLater on, when the Dwarf is to be tortured in order to extract a\n\nconfession about something, they try and put him on the rack but …\n\nit will not accommodate a body of the Dwarf’s diminutive size!\n\n(Unfortunately for the Dwarf, they do find a workaround, however.)\n\nIn summary: Though perhaps not totally satisfying as a novel, _The\n\nDwarf_ is a powerful study of evil, conceived in one time of war and\n\nmaybe especially meaningful for our time as well. And at least I\n\nhave made one small step toward rectifying my shameful ignorance of\n\nimportant literature in languages other than English!\n\nNOTES\n\n[1]\n\nhttp://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/index.html\n\n[2]\n\nhttp://search.eb.com/ This is the online Encyclopedia\n\nBritannica, which unfortunately is no longer free.
