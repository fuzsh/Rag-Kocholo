        "text": "Pär Fabian Lagerkvist (May 23, 1891 – July 11, 1974) was a Swedish author who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1951.\n\nLagerkvist wrote poems, plays, novels, stories, and essays of considerable expressive power and influence from his early 20s to his late 70s. One of his central themes was the fundamental question of good and evil, which he examined through such figures as Barabbas, the man who was freed instead of Jesus, and Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew. As a moralist, he used religious motifs and figures from the Christian tradition without following the doctrines of the church.\n\nTHE BOAT OF LIFE\n\nPar Lagerkvist\n\nSoon you’ll be dead and not know you are gliding\n\nupon life’s boat away towards the other lands\n\nwhere morning waits for you on hidden shores.\n\nDon’t be afraid. Fear not the hour of parting.\n\nA friendly hand calmly trims\n\nthe boat’s sail\n\nthat takes you from the\n\nevening land to that of day.\n\nWalk without apprehension\n\nin the shore’s silence\n\ndown the soft path through the\n\ntwilight grass.\n\n==========\n\nPOEMS 139\n\nPar Lagerkvist\n\nThe god who does not exist,\n\nhe it is who enkindles my soul,\n\nwho makes my soul into a wilderness,\n\na reeking ground, a scorched land,\n\nreeking after a fire,\n\nBecause he does not exist.\n\nHe it is who saved my soul\n\nby making it a desert and scorched,\n\nThe god who does not exist, the awesome god.\n\nIt is not god who loves us, it is we who love him,\n\nwho reach out for him in longing\n\nafter something else,\n\nsomeone greater than ourselves,\n\nas love does.\n\nAnd our longing becomes\n\nthe more intense the less it is returned,\n\nour despair the deeper\n\nthe more we realize that we are deserted,\n\nthat we are loved by no one.\n\nWhat is deeper than absences,\n\nthan unreturned love?\n\nIf you believe in god\n\nand no god exists\n\nthen your belief\n\nis an even greater wonder.\n\nThen it is really something\n\ninconceivably great.\n\nWhy should a being lie down\n\nthere in the darkness\n\ncrying to someone who does not exist?"
