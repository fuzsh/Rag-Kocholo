Some of the Nobel Laureates arrive at the Stockholm Concert Hall on 10 December 1955: Pär Lagerkvist (Nobel Laureate in Literature 1951), Polykarp Kusch (Physics 1955), Hugo Theorell (Physiology or Medicine 1955), Halldór Laxness (Literature 1955), and also some members of Swedish royalty. Inside the festively decorated hall the public awaits the arrival of the Royal family: King Gustaf VI Adolf and Queen Louise, Princesses Sibylla, Margaretha and Birgitta, and Princes Wilhelm and Bertil. The ceremony begins and the Laureates are awarded their Nobel Prize.
