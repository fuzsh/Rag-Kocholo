        "text": "In Which My Ego Goes on a Rampage\n\n.\n\nThe good folks at Readercon have, as is their wont from time to time, gone completely mad. Specifically, they've expanded their request for information to go into the bio paragraphs in the program book to include:\n\n. . . every book you’ve published, with the novels in chronological order followed by any short story collections. Include for each:\n\n-- Title\n\n-- Year and publisher of first publication (if the paperback publisher was different, you can indicate that as well)\n\n-- If significantly different, year and publisher of the most recent edition\n\n-- Any awards or nominations (collections should list the titles of stories that were nominated for or won awards, together with their year and category)\n\n-- Genre if you write in more than one\n\n-- Relation to other of your books if part of a series (which may be grouped together)\n\nPlease include forthcoming books (with their publisher and scheduled date) and works in progress, and significant forthcoming editions of existing books.\n\n-- The titles of stories which were award nominees or winners, or which appeared in Best-of-Year anthologies, together with the relevant information\n\n-- The title and editor of every anthology which contains uncollected short fiction\n\n-- The names of magazines where uncollected short fiction has appeared\n\n-- The title and location of a story recently appearing or about to appear\n\nWhat kind of monster does this create? I'm glad you asked. Here's my extremely cut-down bio paragraph, cut together from the bio they already had and a quick run through my bibliography. I didn't include anything about uncollected fiction, because that's just plain bugfuck.\n\nMichael Swanwick, a Guest of Honor at Readercon 13, is one of the most prolific and inventive writers in science fiction today.
