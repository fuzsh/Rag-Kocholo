Cramer, Kathryn

Entry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author, Critic, Editor.

(1962- ) US critic and editor; daughter of John Cramer, married to David G Hartwell from 1997 until his death in 2016, who began publishing fiction of genre interest with "Forbidden Knowledge" in Mathenauts (anth 1987) edited by Rudy Rucker; she has been involved in various capacities with the New York Review of Science Fiction since it began in 1988, and has published some spiky, erudite criticism in this journal. She has become deeply involved in arguing the aesthetic case for – and writing – fiction designed for Hypertext, including "In Small & Large Pieces" (1994 The Eastgate Quarterly Review of Hypertext #3); given rapid advances in the necessary technologies, her advocacy – which seemed premature in the 1990s – may yet seem to have been predictive.

Cramer's anthologies include two volumes in the Christmas series, both with David Hartwell: Christmas Ghosts (anth 1987) and Spirits of Christmas (anth 1989); The Architecture of Fear (anth 1987) with Peter D Pautz (1952- ), which won a World Fantasy Award; The Ascent of Wonder: The Evolution of Hard Science Fiction (anth 1994) with Hartwell, a huge and ambitious attempt to delineate, and to represent by examples, the scope of Hard SF, which was followed by The Hard SF Renaissance (anth 2002) with Hartwell, and the associated The Space Opera Renaissance (anth 2006) with Hartwell. For comment on the arguments propounded in these last three titles, see David G Hartwell. Also with Hartwell, Cramer has edited from its inception the annual Year's Best Fantasy sequence, beginning with Year's Best Fantasy (anth 2001), as well as editing with Hartwell the later volumes of the Year's Best SF sequence from Year's Best SF 7 (anth 2002) onward. The two series compete adequately with other similar series. [JC]
