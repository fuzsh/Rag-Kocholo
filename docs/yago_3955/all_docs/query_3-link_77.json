        "text": "I’ve loved her forever.\n\nA whole new generation is discovering her through “The Owl House.”\n\nWhat do we know?\n\nShe's the female tv equivalent of Eve Arden and Thelma Ritter -- you see her in a program and you know you're going to enjoy her whenever she's on screen. Fred Willard used to be the male equivalent until he died.\n\nGod she was freaking funny in Just Shoot Me. I remember some episode where she flashes her chest to a window washer outside her building and he falls from the shock or whatever. When she visits him in the hospital she reveals her chest again, only to send him into a coma; her reaction and facial expressions were out-of-this-world hilarious. Now that I think of it, I think she is probably one of my favorite comedic actresses ever.\n\nI've met her and she's quite delightful and cheeky in person.\n\nHowever, I really didn't like her \"Ronnie\" character in FRASIER. I never bought that someone so saucy would be interested in crusty ancient gimp Martin Frasier, and it also felt like a retread of the Marsha Mason character from years earlier.\n\nShe and Christine Baransky age well and are always working. Work seems minimal, although being a former model helps.\n\nI remember her as Camille Barbone in that TV movie of Madonna’s rise to fame.\n\nHuge animal lover, good friends with Ray Abruzzo who also has a ranch with horses.\n\nAnd a very funny lady. One of the few that might have been able to pull off an American Patsy Stone.\n\nI first noticed her in Kate & Allie and then HBO's Dream On. Been a fan for years. I agree with you, r20, that her character on Frasier wasn't great but the show was way past its prime by the time she joined the cast. She did the best she could with what they gave her.\n\nI also have her version of Santa Baby on some Christmas compilation CD. As a singer she's a great actress but I've never really liked that song and her version is probably the one I'd choose to listen to if I have to hear it.\n\nTAKE MY ADVICE is on Amazon. I really should watch it again, 23 years later.\n\nI was pretty drunk (and stoned) when I saw it the first time. I remember being impressed by Wendie's wig game, and her ability to differentiate Ann from Abby in their numerous scenes together. Patti Duke would have been envious.\n\nThe nineties were a magic time in network TV!\n\nArguably, actors and writers were much better off back then financially. There weren't as many different projects as there are nowadays with streaming, but once you landed a job, you were paid better.\n\n[quote]Ray Abruzzo is a hot piece. Were he and Wendie an item?\n\nI suspect Ray may be a hiding-in-plain-sight gay. He's tight with Wendie and Emma Samms, but seems to have no public relationship history of his own. He's also a fierce liberal on his Twitter account and loathes Trump. Good guy whatever the situation is.\n\n[quote]Just Shoot Me and Newsradio were the best!\n\nI was just going to post the same thing.\n\nLoved both series, and always thought a crossover episode would have been TV perfection.\n\nShe's funny and foxy and harms nobody. I dig her.\n\nShe always stands out. One is drawn to her in whatever role she plays.\n\nTall dark and lean thing she is with good movement. Was she a dancer? Or, maybe she's one for yoga? I dunno but she carries herself sexily.\n\nWendie's voice over work is pretty epic (BoJack Horseman and The Owl House make her a geek / queer icon).\n\nI remember a TV film (Lifetime?) where she plays a bored, little housewife thrust into a murder mystery which was fairly lame, but made fantastic because of her falling over a dead guy in her, I believe, kitchen. Best scene ever.\n\nI might have to try and find to see if I can watch Just Shoot Me anywhere. It is kind of like Wings in where it had a long run and could be pretty funny, but always overshadowed in the media by other shows. Generally, I am not a huge David Spade fan, but he was used well on that show.\n\nI always enjoyed her rivalry with \"Susan Lucci\" on Hot in Cleveland and Lucci herself seemed pretty game to make fun of herself and they played off of each other well.\n\n[quote]For some reason, my post at [R41] didn’t include my comment, so I’ll try again — the clip at 5:34 with news reporter Victoria Chase never fails to make me smile!\n\nDon't worry, you didn't post at R41; I did. We posted at approximately the same time ( great minds, you know), so there was nothing wrong with your post.\n\nR37, I agree. I didn't realize that he's not actually a good actor until watching \"Veronica Mars\" a few years ago. He seems like he's never fully in character but always a little awkward and self-conscious. It worked for him in \"Galaxy Quest,\" but that's about it.\n\nR44 I like to think in an alternate universe Nina and Bill dated. Bill loved name dropping and being pretentious so I bet he would have been in the Nina Van Horn THS. Catherine on NR was also gorgeous and could have been a former model. Maybe she and Nina hung out and did blow at Studio 54 one night and hooked up with a Rolling Stone.\n\nWhile my first experience of her was also as Judith, the main character’s ex wife and obsession, on Dream On, I’ve enjoyed her more in other roles. Just Shoot Me, Seinfeld, Frazier, Young Sheldon. Very beautiful and very funny. Her last name is Egyptian, like Rami’s.\n\nYes JSM is on Hulu, it came on right at the tail end of the lockdown so I watched it right away but I think I may again.\n\nRegardless I think being 1/8 Copt Arab isn't enough for someone to claim that identity. At that point they'd just be culturally American and nobody looks at Wendie and thinks Middle Eastern.\n\nR78, I like his name, Brian Benben.\n\nR76, his last acting credit was Imposters. I agree with your sentiments about Benben and would add that he has a sexy voice.\n\nI worked with her on a pilot a good while back, had dinner with her since. One of the nicest, most down to earth people I've ever met within show business or out (but certainly within.)\n\n[quote] She and Christine Baransky age well and are always working.\n\nBoth hard-working Buffalo gals. Never doubt the work ethic of those of us who grew up in rust belt cities.\n\nWendie Malick and Jami Gertz both kind of got shit on professionally in the sense that they should have been much bigger.\n\nI would like to see a show starring them.\n\nR82 there were no Arabs in Egypt until the Muslim conquest. How can Copts be Arabs when they predate their presence, speak a different language and have different customs? Do you think the pharaohs were Arab, too?\n\nNina Van Horn : Greta, if you had something on the side of your mouth, would you want me to tell you? Greta Larson : Of course. Nina Van Horn : Okay. You're hugely fat.\n\nR91 Yes. True Arabs are from the Gulf peninsula. They are from countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman and Bahrain.\n\nBut indigenous Egyptians are Semitic people closely related to Arabs, Assyrians, Jews and Phoenicians who make up the Arab peninsula and Levant region. Egyptians aren't related to Maghrebis of North Africa like Moroccans, Algerians, Libyans and Tunisians."
