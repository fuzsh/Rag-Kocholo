        "text": "Q: Could you tell me who Madeleine Stowe of \"Revenge\" is married to? I read it in a magazine but forgot. It is eating away at me.\n\nA: Stowe, who plays Victoria Grayson on the ABC serial, has been married to actor Brian Benben for more than 25 years. You may know him from ABC's \"Private Practice,\" where he plays Dr. Sheldon Wallace; the comedy series \"Dream On\" and other productions.\n\nQ: I haven't seen Pat Buchanan, a regular on MSNBC, for some time. What has become of him?\n\nA: MSNBC President Phil Griffin told reporters in early January that Buchanan had been taken off the network because of comments Buchanan made in his latest book, \"Suicide of a Superpower.\" The New York Times quoted the book's declaration that the \"European and Christian core of our country is shrinking,\" damaging the nation \"ethnically, culturally, morally, politically.\" It also noted that one chapter is called \"The End of White America.\" Griffin said, \"The ideas he put forth aren't really appropriate for national dialogue, much less the dialogue on MSNBC.\" It was not clear then, nor is it yet, whether Buchanan will be back on the network. As recently as last week, his website still referred to him as an analyst for MSNBC, and a network representative has not answered an email asking for an update.\n\nQ: The girl who plays Nora in \"Being Human\" looks an awful lot like the girl who played Nina Cortlandt in \"All My Children\" but seems too young to be the same actress. Are they the same? Are they related?\n\nA: Kristin Hager plays Nora in the Americanized adaptation of the British \"Being Human\" series. Born in Canada in 1984, she was not even born when Taylor Miller began playing Nina, a role she held for more than 30 years. I have not found any indication that they are related.\n\nQ: A movie shot in Toronto two years ago was called \"Score: A Hockey Musical.\" Was it ever released, and if not, why? Where can it be found?\n\nA: The movie, about a hockey phenom (with Olivia Newton-John as his mother), was very Canada-centric, according to several reports from up north. So it was shown in theaters in Canada, where it reportedly did not do well -- although its Facebook page has comments from some fervent fans. And it has been released on DVD; you can find it for sale at Amazon.com's Canadian branch, www.amazon.ca .\n\nQ: There was a television series in the 1970s starring James Franciscus as either an attorney or policeman who became blind and continued in his profession, with the assistance of a white seeing-eye dog. Can you tell me the name of this series and if it is available in any format for purchase?\n\nA: The series was called \"Longstreet\" and aired for a single season in 1971-72. Franciscus played an insurance investigator blinded on a case. He kept working, aided in part by a self-defense instructor played by Bruce Lee. I do not know of an authorized video release of the series. I did see a couple of DVD packages for sale on Amazon.com billed as \"Bruce Lee: Longstreet #1 and #2,\" but I can't vouch for their original source or quality.\n\nQ: I saw a movie on TV back in the late '80s, could have been early '90s, that had no big-name actors that I can recall. The movie is about a guy that buys a computer and connects all his home systems to it. He inadvertently types his name in as Moles instead of Miles and the computer calls him Moles for the rest of the movie as it takes over his life. It's a cute comedy that I would like to rent and see again if I could only find its title.\n\nA: That would be \"Electric Dreams,\" a 1984 film starring Lenny Van Dohlen and Virginia Madsen. It was released on VHS but I do not know of an authorized DVD.\n\n___\n\n©2012 the Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio)"
