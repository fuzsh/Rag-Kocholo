        "text": "Madeleine Stowe, 53, (Revenge airs on ABC Wednesdays at 10 p.m.) shares the 25 things you don't know about her with Us Weekly.\n\n1. My toes are all the same length.\n\n2. I have a lovely daughter [May, 15, with her husband, Private Practice star Brian Benben], not two children, which has been misreported again and again.\n\n3. I love to make homemade pasta.\n\n4. I prefer the company of men to women.\n\n5. I hate girlie talk. If I hear someone whine about men, it'll drive me out into the open.\n\n6. I have a large head â€” physically, I mean.\n\n7. I get quiet out of shyness.\n\n8. I will talk in rapid-fire bursts once I'm no longer feeling shy.\n\n9. I love corsets.\n\n10. I can have three conversations at once and not remember any of them.\n\n11. I'm half Costa Rican.\n\n12. I sleepwalk.\n\n13. I have long conversations in my sleep.\n\n14. My dreams are often violent and, for better or worse, they run all night.\n\n15. I've had many a dream where an event happens, then the event occurs in real life a day or two later.\n\n16. I can rope cattle.\n\n17. My favorite horse from my ranch is Sherman.\n\n18. I used to chew Copenhagen tobacco.\n\n19. I don't have tattoos. I prefer pristine skin.\n\n20. I spend a part of each day in an alternate universe.\n\n21. I replace a lot of things I lose, then I lose them again!\n\n22. I have a boot fetish.\n\n23. Daniel Day-Lewis once stole my beloved cowboy boots.\n\n24. I got them back, but I've worn holes in them that I won't resole."
