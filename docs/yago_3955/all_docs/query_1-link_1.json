        "text": "American actor (born 1956)\n\nBrian Edward Benben (born June 18, 1956) is an American actor, best known for his role as Martin Tupper in the HBO comedy television series Dream On (1990–1996), and also known as Sheldon Wallace on ABC medical drama Private Practice (2008–2013), and as Larry in I Come in Peace (1990).\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nBenben was born in Winchester, Virginia, the son of Gloria Patricia (née Coffman) and Peter Michael Benben Sr., a produce buyer.[1][2]\n\nHe later lived and attended high school in Marlboro, New York, followed by two years at Ulster County Community College in Stone Ridge, New York, after which he moved to New York City, where he had various jobs while auditioning and acting. In 1983 he appeared in the Broadway production of John Byrne's play Slab Boys with Kevin Bacon, Sean Penn, Val Kilmer and Jackie Earle Haley. The play ran on Broadway for 48 performances.[3]\n\nAlthough his first national exposure was in the 1981 NBC miniseries-then-series The Gangster Chronicles,[4] He appeared in Matlock 'The Heiress' in 1988. Benben is perhaps best known for his leading role in the 1990–96 HBO television series, Dream On. He played a \"by the book\" FBI agent in the 1990 film Dark Angel (known in the U.S. as I Come in Peace).\n\nHe had a starring role in the 1994, film Radioland Murders playing Mary Stuart Masterson's estranged husband. In September 1998, he starred in an eponymous primetime CBS sitcom, The Brian Benben Show, which lasted only one month on the air. In the 2000s, he played Sheldon Wallace on Shonda Rhimes' Private Practice. His character was first introduced in December 2008,[5] later became a recurring character, and finally a series regular.[6] In 2014, he appeared in the television series Scandal, also produced by Rhimes.[7]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1982, Benben married actress Madeleine Stowe,[1] whom he met filming The Gangster Chronicles. Together they have one daughter, born in 1996. Benben and Stowe live in Pacific Palisades now and prior to that lived in west of Austin, near Johnson City, Texas.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Other notes 1981 The Gangster Chronicles Michael Lasker Main role 1986 Kay O'Brien Mark Doyle Main role 1990–1996 Dream On Martin Tupper Main role\n\nCableACE Awards for Actor in a Comedy Series (1993) 1998 The Brian Benben Show Brian Benben Lead role; also co-executive producer 2003 Kingpin Heywood Klein Main role 2005 Masters of Horror Dwight Faraday Episode: \"Deer Woman\" 2008–2013 Private Practice Sheldon Wallace Recurring role (Seasons 2–3)\n\nMain role (Seasons 4–6) 2014 Scandal Leonard Carnahan Episode: \"An Innocent Man\" 2015 Grace and Frankie Charlie Episode: \"The Earthquake\" 2016 Roadies Preston Recurring role 2017–2018 Imposters Max Main role\n\nFilm Year Title Role Other notes 1981 Gangster Wars Michael Lasker Based on The Gangster Chronicles 1988 Clean and Sober Martin Laux 1989 Mortal Sins Nathan Weinschank 1990 I Come in Peace Special Agent Arwood 'Larry' Smith was released as Dark Angel outside the US 1994 Radioland Murders Roger Henderson 2001 The Flamingo Rising (Made for TV movie) Hubert T.
