        "text": "She had called my mobile to apologise profusely though, in her very mannered, very Texan, very polite way. She appears to begin every interview, or perhaps it's just those involving food, by asking the journalist if he/she minds if she unbuttons her jeans. (Oh, to see some of the men's faces when this gorgeous woman not averse to showing all on screen asked such a thing.)\n\nFamously, Madeleine Stowe used to buy her jeans three sizes too big so she could pig out without them getting tight. But today, she doesn't ask about the unbuttoning. Not even after she's eaten her Californian avocado sandwich. But then she doesn't look like she needs to. Disappointingly, I discover that Stowe - the most un-Hollywood of Hollywood actresses - appears to be on a health kick.\n\n'I just came back from running four-and-a-half miles in the hills,' she says. 'I have to now. Although exercise is sort of sporadic with me because I'm lazy.' She means she has to now because she's at an age where she needs to work a little harder to look good - where she's competing with other actresses the wrong side of 40 who do three billion sit-ups a day.\n\nIn any case, whatever Stowe is doing is working. Having taken a couple of years' break to raise her daughter May, now five, Stowe is on to a winning cinematic streak once more. But she refuses to pander to celebrity. And yet, she realises that Noughties Hollywood is very different from the one she encountered when she began working in her late twenties.\n\nThese days, she knows, it is the media-friendly celebs who wheedle pay cheques with multitudinous zeros from Hollywood suits. So Stowe is trying to work the system, relieved on this occasion that We Were Soldiers is based on a book - We Were Soldiers Once... And Young - written by Joe Galloway and Colonel Hal Moore, a Vietnam war hero who lost a huge number of his platoon during a little-known battle waged during that conflict.\n\nThe film is a production of Gibson's company Icon, which leads one to deduce he had casting approval and personally selected Stowe to play his wife, Julie. Though her role is not a big one, Stowe cares about the film, describing it as a 'wonderful, cautionary, anti-war tale'. It's a heart-breaking one, though, particularly in scenes where she intercepts telegrams announcing the deaths of her friends' husbands. 'They sent them in taxis! It was a horror show.'\n\nBut initially, Stowe retained some detachment from the film. She found the battle sequences 'interesting pieces of film-making', the film's dying soldiers uttering 'Tell my wife I love her' 'like a Hollywood moment'. She thinks differently now. 'Julie Moore [Hal Moore's wife] told me it's truly the most common thing American soldiers say. And then when you sit next to Hal Moore, the man the film is all about, and have him say he can't watch it...' Her voice tails off and her eyes brim with tears. 'I'm sorry. I'm not normally like this. I think my husband has only ever seen me cry about three times. But it's been a pretty intense week.'\n\nStowe and her husband of 20 years, Dream On's hilariously wry actor Brian Benben, had just returned from a screening of We Were Soldiers on a US military base. 'They were great people. And you know, they don't want to fight. People think they do because of the rhetoric from Donald Rumsfeld and President Bush. A general said to me, \"I worry about the words they've chosen.\" It was all very illuminating.'\n\nStowe fights hard to maintain normalcy in her life and, because of that, has learned 'not to expect anything one way or another' when she meets someone such as Mel Gibson for the first time. 'I have worked with actors who have very large lives because of their level of stardom. They have a lot going on around them all the time.' She calls Gibson a 'good man, good to the core, and keenly intelligent. I think he has kept that kind of undercover with his audiences.'\n\nThough she has worked with a string of male Hollywood heavy-hitters - Bruce Willis, John Travolta, Daniel Day Lewis, Ray Liotta and next, Sylvester Stallone in her first comedy, Avenging Angelo - Stowe says, besides her own, she attends the premieres of only one actor's films. She pauses for ages when I ask who, finally admitting it is Brad Pitt, with whom she shares both a manager and publicist. The pair even made a film together - 12 Monkeys - yet Stowe says she doesn't know him well enough to say much more than 'Hi, how are you?'\n\nShe describes herself as 'socially inept' but seems not remotely so in person. What she seems is absolutely besotted with her husband and daughter. Is the latter the best thing to happen to her? 'Oh hell yeah!' She 'can only do one thing at a time - acting, motherhood. I can't multi-task. I don't open mail. I don't know how much money I have. I'm very flaky.'\n\nEven the prospect of arriving on a film set is enough to send her sweat glands into hyper-drive. And she says she will 'never, ever' be able to perform on stage. 'I've never told anyone this,' she whispers conspiratorially, 'but I'll find any excuse not to get on that plane when I'm starting a film. I always delay my trip by a day or two or three. Panic just sets in. I'm fine once I'm there but the dread of going through it...'\n\nWhich makes it all the more perplexing that Stowe appears to have no hang-ups whatsoever about sex. In her earlier films, she was all for getting her kit off and rolling around stark naked. 'Yeah, people always say I'm associated with that and there was a time when I turned down a number of films, because I was tired of being defined that way.' She says, tellingly, that 'it's not a lot of fun unless they're really nice guys.'\n\n'I remember Brian and I were watching some dailies from Revenge with director Tony Scott. There was me and Kevin Costner going at it, and my husband was just loving it. He was saying to Tony, \"This is really good.\" But what was most hilarious was that there was no sound so all you could hear was Tony on the megaphone telling Kevin, \"F***ing nail the bitch!\"'\n\nTalk about taking away the romance. 'Well, that's completely Tony. I love him so. He's one of three or four people I have really adored. I believe Tony's then-girlfriend punched him out later that night.'"
