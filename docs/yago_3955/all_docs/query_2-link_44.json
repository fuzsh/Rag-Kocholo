        "text": "I thought she dropped out of the industry to raise a family or something?\n\nAnyway, when Ray Liotta died I mentioned my love for Unlawful Entry. Great movie and the film that comes to mind when I think of Madeleine Stowe.\n\nI loved Stowe at her early to mid '90s peak. In Blink (the thriller in which she's a blind musician whose sight is restored, and she starts having visions of murders) she even demonstrated she could carry a film. She's complex and interesting in that part. But it seemed she never really broke through with the public, and a window closed. Sometimes that happens.\n\nShe was originally offered the role of Matthew Modine's wife in Robert Altman's Short Cuts, but she was uncomfortable with the full frontal nudity. Not in and of itself but because she thought she would be too self-conscious playing that long marital argument while \"bottomless.\" Altman told her not to worry about it, and he got Julianne Moore for the part. (Moore told him, \"I have a bonus for you, Bob. I'm a real redhead.\") But he kept Stowe on the project, giving her the role of Tim Robbins's wife. It turned out to be one of her best and most enduring films. The scene in which Robbins, a Los Angeles cop, makes up an overly complicated lie to hide his cheating, and Stowe bursts out laughing, is a high point of the film.\n\nShe did a lot of \"The Girl\" roles in her day, ev E Ryan zctress who does that fizzles out at a comparatively young age.\n\nShe was good in those roles because she was good at looking lovely and vulnerable, but IMHO she lacked the spark needed to carry films. No spark, no star quality, no sense of fun, and what might have been a lack of sex appeal. Obviously I'm no expert there, who among us is.\n\nShe was great in\"Octane\" (aka \"Pulse\"), where she played an ex-addict whose teen daughter (played by Mischa Barton) gets abducted by a band of hippie vampire freaks on a nighttime road trip. Jonathan Rhys Meyers played the cult leader, and Norman Reedus a trucker trying to hunt them down. I don't think anyone (aside from myself and maybe ten other people) ever saw it, but I thought it was a weird, memorable, and creepy flick, and Stowe was really good in it. Her aloofness worked well for the damaged character she was playing. I think it was the last film she's been in to date.\n\nShe was a limited actress at best and probably wouldn't to the couching coach shit.\n\nShe wrote a script in the early 00's that the studios were all very interesting in but they wouldn't yield to her demand to start in it and direct it.\n\nIt was a Western and apparently very very good. She was attached to direct it at one time starring Hugh Jackman but nothing has come with it. We may have missed out on an interesting film.\n\nNow of course she would be too old to star in her script but it is a shame that nobody is giving her the chance to direct it given its supposed quality.\n\n[quote]I do remember thinking they should have cast a much “earthier” actor as the cop’s wife in “Short Cuts.”\n\nMy read was that Stowe's character had married down. She and Julianne Moore play sisters, and Moore is an artist married to a doctor; she goes to chamber music recitals and wears fashionable-for-1993 clothes. When we see Stowe at Moore/Modine's house posing for the painting, it seems she's more in an environment where she fits. But now she's married to this motorcycle cop and has a couple of brats running around their little tract house.\n\nThe Robbins character probably got her to believe he was going to make detective and rise high in the ranks or some shit. His talent seems to be getting women to believe his bullshit for a while.\n\nI kind of admire her for just saying no to the studio's wishes and walking. I wish we could have seen that movie, because I remember reading about it years ago in Premiere or something, but I wonder if most women would have given in just to get the movie made.\n\nI always found her voice quite grating. I think that's a reason why the straight male audience never really went for her.\n\nr21 Do you think she and McDormand (who plays the mistress) should've switched roles? I think Robbins in that role is why I've never really liked him.\n\nr25 Then she ultimately just puts up with his cheating in the end. Really a very cynical, nihilistic movie overall."
