That is a combined net worth with his wife since 1982, fellow actor Madeleine Stowe.\n\nBrian Benben is probably best known for his role as Martin Tupper in the HBO comedy television series \"Dream On\" in the early to mid-1990s. He also has appeared in the medical drama \"Private Practice\" and had roles in \"Roadies,\" \"Imposters,\" and \"I Come in Peace,\" among other films and television series.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBrian Edward Benben was born on June 18, 1956 in Winchester, Virginia to parents Gloria Patricia and Peter Benben Sr. His father worked as a produce buyer to support the family. The family later moved to New York where Benben attended high school in the city of Marlboro. Following his high school graduation, he spent two years at Ulster County Community College in Stone Ridge, New York.

For his work on the show, Benben received the CableACE Awards for Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993.\n\nWhile on \"Dream On,\" Benben appeared in some other projects as well. He appeared in the film \"I Come in Peace\" in 1990 as Special Agent Arwood 'Larry' Smith. The film was released by the name \"Dark Angel\" outside the United States. In 1994, he appeared in the film \"Radioland Murders\" as character Roger Henderson. In 1998, he briefly had his own show called \"The Brian Benben Show\" that he starred in and also co-executive produced.\n\nIn 2001, Benben appeared in the television film \"The Flamingo Rising\" as character Hubert T. Lee. In 2003, he played the lead role of Heywood Klein in the in the series \"Kingpin.\" In 2005, he appeared in an episode of \"Masters of Horror.\"\n\nBenben's next major role came when he was cast as character Sheldon Wallace in the series \"Private Practice\" in 2008. The show is a spin-off of the very popular series \"Grey's Anatomy.\" He had a recurring role on the show for the second and third seasons and then was promoted to a main role in seasons four, five, and six. He remained on the show until 2013.\n\nWhile working on \"Private Practice,\" Benben continued working on other projects as well. In 2014, he appeared in an episode of the popular show \"Scandal.\" In 2015, he had a guest-starring role in an episode of \"Grace and Frankie.\" In 2016, he landed a recurring role on the series \"Roadie\" as the character of Preston. His next main role came in 2017 when he was cast in a main role in the series \"Imposters.\" In the show, he played the character of Max. He remained on the show from 2017 to 2018.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 1982, Benben married actress Madeleine Stowe.
