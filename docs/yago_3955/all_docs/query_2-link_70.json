Madeleine, who was nude at the time, says she went to check it out — and was confronted by a Latino man, the intruder, who pointed a handgun to her neck.\n\nThe former Revenge star told police the man spoke in broken English and demanded, “I want all the valuable, I want something.” She says she gave him a bag filled with $75k worth of antique jewelry, and then he made a clean getaway.\n\nRelated: Lamar Odom Courted Back to Nevada Brothel: ‘No Drugs This Time’\n\nA few months later cops busted the suspect, Walter Canizalez, as he was allegedly attempting another heist. Police believe he’s pulled 3 other armed home robberies, and he’s been charged with more than 15 counts … including robbery and sexual battery.\n\nWhen Canizalez was caught, cops say he was wearing a Spiderman mask — just as he was during some of the alleged robberies."
