For performance in show she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress- Television Series Drama in 2012.

Early Life[]

Stowe, the first of three children, was born at the Queen of Angels Hospital, in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California and raised in Eagle Rock, a suburb of Los Angeles. Her mother, Mireya , had come from a prominent family in Costa Rica. Her father, Robert Stowe, was a civil engineer from a "poor Oregon family". One of Stowe's maternal great-great-grandfathers, politician Jose Joaquin Mora Porras, was younger brother of President Juan Rafael Mora Porras, who governed Costa Rica from 1849 to 1859. Another one of Stowe's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Bruno Carranza, President of Costa Rica in 1870, albeit briefly, as he resigned three months after taking power. His wife, Stowe's great-great-grandmother, Geronima Montealegre, was the sister of President Jose Maria Montealegre Fernandez, who governed Costa Rica from 1959 to 1863. One of Stowe's maternal great-grandfathers was a German immigrant to Costa Rica.

Stowe's father suffered from multiple sclerosis, and she accompanied him to medical treatments.

She originally aspired to become a conert pianist, taking piano lessons between the ages of ten and eighteen. Stowe would later explain that playing the piano was a means of escape from having to socialise with other children her age. Her Russian-born music teacher, Sergei Tarnowsky, had faith in Stowe, even teaching her from his deathbed. Following his death at the age of 92, she quit, later commenting: "I just felt it was time to not be by myself anymore." Stowe went on her first date at the age of eighteen.
