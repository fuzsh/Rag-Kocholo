        "text": "My youngest daughter recently enjoyed two weeks of holiday, called the May Holiday. The first day of her holiday was Good Friday, April 19. It is Dutch logic to call that a May Holiday. Dutch Public holidays are not fixed days, so they change every year. This year it is an employer-friendly year as, for example, King’s Day and Liberation day both fell in the weekend. Unfortunately, other than for instance in the UK, such days are not moved to the next Monday in the Netherlands.\n\nKing’s Day is now April 27 as that is the birthday of our King. Before King Willem-Alexander ascended the throne, we enjoyed Queens Day which fell on April 30 and was always the start of that holiday in May. On Queen’s Day, April 30, 2013, Queen Beatrix abdicated in favor of her eldest son and resumed the title of princess. But April 30 was not the birthday of Beatrix as that is January 31. It was the birthday of her mother and Willem Alexanders’ Grandma Juliana instead. Since the Dutch are used to celebrate the day outside all dressed up in orange, she thought January would be too cold for the people and decided not to move the day of celebration to her own birthday.\n\nIn my memory, Queen’s Day has always been a warm and shiny day indeed. But since it moved to King’s Day on April 27, it has always been a colder day than January that same year. Dutch logic again. Our future Queen, if all stays well, will be Amalia who is born on December 7. We will have to see what happens with her birthday celebrations. By the way, this is one of the reasons the Netherlands is a Triple-A country. Amalia is the first A, her sisters are called Alexia and Ariane.\n\nMy oldest daughter is taking exams this year; hence she is studying each day to pass her exams to start the next phase in her and our life as parents: going to a university and leaving the house. She is looking forward to it, we as parents only partly. We found it inappropriate to go on holiday somewhere without her while she was studying and us making fun. So, we decided to stay at home these weeks and take a day off here and there and do something fun with our youngest daughter. My son is too old for that, he claims.\n\nAccordingly, we visited the MuZIEum last week, which maybe best translates to MuSEEum. Where in most museums you can see beautiful things, this one lets you experience what is it like to be blind or partially sighted. You are entering a world in which your other senses – hearing, smell, touch and taste – suddenly play a far more important role than you are used to.\n\nSo, it is not a museum where you admire objects on displays or walls. We were an essential part of the experience by doing a tour through a living room, a garden, a supermarket, and drinking a soda in a bar in absolute darkness. You literally see not a thing. Our tour guide called Joop is 100% blind and told more about living with sight loss. He made us see the world through different eyes. They say that in the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king. I can tell you that in the MuZIEum, Joop was king and not me or Willem-Alexander.\n\nWalking around in the world of Microsoft, it sometimes feels like walking around in the MuZIEum. In the Microsoft country, the one-eyed man is king. Being a Microsoft partner, there are so many opportunities, but it is hard to choose which ones to follow. You cannot pursue them all. On April 17, Microsoft announced a new program for Business Application Independent Software Vendors (ISV’s), following many initiatives like Certified for Microsoft Dynamics, AppSource, One Commercial Partner and more. This time the program is designed by Microsoft veteran Steven ‘Guggs’ Guggenheimer. In his blog, Steve writes that by 2022, the business applications market will reach USD 125 billion – a 43% increase from 2018! – with ISV’s projected to drive 57% of the business applications business (based on internal research commissioned by Microsoft).\n\nWith this new ISV program, Microsoft says they are ensuring customers are offered only the highest-quality and most secure apps. This is the same text as used with the Certified for Microsoft Dynamics program. A big difference with CfMD is that business applications are now cloud-based: offering Microsoft more tools, insights and enforcement to make this happen. The program is built around a revenue-sharing model that offers reinvestment in ISVs through new technology, marketing, and sales enablement benefits. Looking at the projected revenue growth, I know which eyed man is becoming king. Following the reduction of margins of their reselling partners, Microsoft is now eating a part of the ISV side of the Business Application pie. Despite this behavior, which might seem a bit greedy, partners who survived the reduced reselling margins have only grown, both in revenue and profits. Fortunately, HSO is one of them.\n\nContinuity is most important for customers who invest in business applications, and Microsoft and HSO Innovation are in for the long term.\n\nStaying at home also means having time to clean the house and finally get rid of stuff you never use. One of the traditions at Kings day in the Netherlands is it is free to sell anything you like during that day. It is called vrijmarkt or kleedjesmarkt, which translates as a free marketplace or carpet market as most sellers sit on a kind of carpet. My youngest daughter thought she could make some money offering her second-hand clothes for resale on King’s Day.\n\nWith the money earned she would be able to pay us back for the new nice dress she bought for herself for the coming summer but did not yet have the money to buy (I will get back to this at the end of this blog). Optimistically, she went to the free market and assumed the new owners would be very happy with her clothes. Some potential buyers looked and showed interest in her beautiful green dress and let all the other stuff untouched. Someone offered $30 for the green dress, but she had given the dress a price tag of $59.99. My daughter’s response was that it is worth much more, as she had barely worn it. The buyer responded with: “Look around. Would you spend so much on a similar second-hand dress?”. Disappointed my daughter put everything, including her green dress, in her bag and came home. When thinking it over before going to sleep, she said the potential buyer was probably right. Why expect to get $60 for something you would not pay more for than $40? People tend to overestimate the value of their belongings as it hurts to say goodbye to them. This is called the endowment effect: the finding that people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it. The pain of losing things with a perceived loss is larger than the happiness of acquiring them. Or even worse, the possession of things for some is the end of the entertainment. The repugnance of loss makes people not wanting to sell at all. It not only applies to small things like a dress but also with more substantial investments like a house, stocks, and probably business applications.\n\nOne of my favorite Professors, Daniel Kahneman and his colleagues Jack Knetsch & Richard Thaler conducted a study to see how the endowment effect influences our decision making. The scientists randomly divided participants into buyers and sellers and gave the sellers HSO coffee mugs as a gift. They then asked the sellers for how much they would sell the mug and asked the buyers for how much they would buy it.\n\nResults showed that the sellers (who owned the mugs) placed a significantly higher value on the mugs than the buyers did. They were willing to sell a mug for $7.12 while buyers were only willing to pay $2.87 (median reservation prices).\n\nPeople appreciate things that they already own more than things they might own. The fear of losing the mug (loss aversion) becomes the cause of the contradiction in the evaluation of the cost of the coffee mug.\n\nResults showed that the sellers (who owned the mugs) placed a significantly higher value on the mugs than the buyers did. They were willing to sell a mug for $7.12 while buyers were willing to pay $2.87 (median reservation prices). People appreciate things that they already own more than those which they might own. The fear of losing the mug (loss aversion) becomes the cause of the contradiction in the evaluation of the cost of the coffee mug.\n\nWith Microsoft taking a part of our revenue, this either means lower revenue for us and/or for the reselling partner. Alternatively, we can increase subscription fees, but that would probably increase the endowment effect. When in sales it is important to understand this effect. Changing the price should be avoided but is always a possibility. It is easier to bridge a price gap than a functional gap in software.\n\nThe idea of ownership and endowment effect is starting early in our life and is further explained in these videos:\n\nHSO Innovation offers business apps on Microsoft AppSource. Our most successful apps are the apps where users can perform a free trial. Microsoft will introduce the transact option to AppSource later this year. The neoclassical preference theory predicts that notions of value are independent of initial endowments or commitments. In fact, the ubiquity of the endowment effect is so high, it’s been used to explain why bidders end up paying more in frenzied eBay auctions or why investors hold onto loss-making stocks But how does the effect help us when it comes to designing apps, attracting users and keeping them? Only Apps that are sufficiently addictive and encourage regular engagement thrive. Given 35% of mobile app engagements last less than a minute, being able to harness behavioral phenomena – like the endowment effect – can be key to boosting user loyalty in a severely attention-deficient world. Applying what we know about the endowment effect, apps can incorporate certain design elements to gain long-term traction. The reason why ‘freemium’, like Spotify and Pokémon Go, is popular is that it minimizes people’s perceived cost of being locked into something they may not want to pay for, but is giving them the feeling of ownership, making it less likely the user will abandon the product when the free period ends. Thanks to the endowment effect, people think twice before hitting the uninstall button. And as people place more value on something they own than if they don’t own it, they might be willing to pay more for a product after experiencing a free trial than they would if they had to pay for the product without it. With consumer apps, the most successful apps make use of conditional rewards and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) effect (level-ups, points, badges and prizes) with the risk of being lost if you don’t return frequently. The endowment effect tells us this capitalizes on people’s tendency towards loss aversion, the tendency for us to feel the pain of loss more strongly than pleasure at an equal gain. But all the neurological insights in the world couldn’t save an app that is perceived to lack fundamental user value. However, design that taps into the powerful nuances of the endowment effect can augment a good one in terms of greater product adoption, user retention and app loyalty.\n\nI promised to end with the money my daughter borrowed from us to buy that nice dress. She lends $50 from her mother and $50 from me. The dress was $97, so she had $3 left. She returns $1 to each of us and decided to keep that $1. This means she will have to return $49 to both of us later. But wait a minute: $49 + $49 = $98 + that $1 she kept, makes it $99. Where did that $1 go???\n\n$1 per month per user is making Microsoft the big King.\n\nKind regards,\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nOn behalf of HSO Innovation\n\nLast week my daughter and I attended a theater lecture by the famous Dutch physician and neurobiologist Dick Swaab. Dick Swaab is best known for his research and discoveries in the field of brain anatomy and physiology and the impact that various hormonal and biochemical factors in the womb have on brain development. His book ‘We are our brains – a travel through brains’, describes Dick’s conclusion that brains are not things we have, but rather brains are what we are: the physical and chemical processes in our brains determine how we react and who we are.\n\nThe lecture was organized around his new book ‘Our creative brain’. For me, the lecture was especially interesting because of the topic and content, not so much based on Dick’s presentation skills. It departed from the big five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN or CANOE Model. The five factors have been defined as openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.\n\nBeneath each proposed global factor, there are several correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions.\n\nDuring the lecture, Dick presented several exceptional examples of human brains and people who see the world differently than average humans do. Not only with visual illusions people register and see different things while looking at the same thing. What you see is not always what you get. What you see is not always what is actually there and what you see is not always what someone else sees. Please have a look at a Kanizsa triangle illusion below that make us realize the way our visual systems work.\n\nHow many triangles do you see? It is an illusory contour, a symmetrical figure consisting of 3 discs each missing a triangular section, and 3 pairs of lines. Looking at the figure, most people will have the visual experience of an apparent brightness contour defining an upright triangle which is occluding three black discs and a second, inverted triangle outlined in black. In fact, these triangles do not exist! If you then consider that memories fade, and people have difficulties in gathering and presenting info from their long-term memory, you can imagine for instance in court cases it is hard to use eye witness stories.\n\nAnyway, I’d like to share some more examples presented by Dick with you as well. Two years ago, in my blog on Argument from Ignorance I wrote about PI Day, March 14 (Yes, it is coming soon again!). Dick talked about the man who memorized PI (a circles circumference divided by its diameter), Daniel Tammet, memorizing 22,514 digits in just over 5 hours! This is an example of synesthesia, a puzzling phenomenon in which a certain type of stimulus triggers a hallucinatory perception. Daniel is an autistic savant and wrote and TED talks about his life with Asperger syndrome and Savant Syndrome.\n\nSavants became known with the filming of Rain Man, a 1988 movie telling the story of an abrasive, selfish young wheeler-dealer Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise), who discovers that his estranged father has died and bequeathed all of his multimillion-dollar estate to his other son, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), of whose existence Charlie was unaware. Raymond is an autistic savant. Savants like Rain Man have very low mental performance in most areas. However, they also have unusually high performance at a very small number of things.\n\nBack to Daniel. Daniel is also able to do seemingly impossible calculations in his head with incredible speed, as well as learn to speak and write new languages, like Icelandic in about a week. Tammet doesn’t need a calculator to solve exponential math problems such as 27 to the 7th power – that’s 27 multiplied by itself seven times – he’ll come up with the answer 10,460,353,203 in a few seconds. Like a powerful computer! One word that he uses quite frequently is “landscape”. When Tammet recites a number with numerable digits (Pi, for example), he sees a landscape that consists of the shapes that are representative of each integer. By making his way through the landscape in his mind, he can see (and recite) each digit in eerily perfect sequential order. If you are interested to learn more about Daniel, I encourage you to watch the documentary: Daniel Tammet – The Boy With The Incredible Brain”.\n\nAnother exceptional savant example is Stephen Wiltshire, also known as The Human Camera. Stephen drew the cities of London, Rome and more just from memory by flying around in a helicopter. Stephens verbal IQ has been measured at 52 but learning about Stephen is enough to make you wonder if ‘normal’ intelligence is all it’s cracked up to be. According to the voiceover, after just 45 minutes of surveying Rome from a helicopter, Wiltshire was able to faithfully recreate virtually everything he saw. His completed panorama stretched across 5 and a half yards of paper. Even more impressive, Steven’s masterpiece required no preliminary sketching, or ‘roughing out of space.’ “It was as if the panorama already existed in his head, with all the proportions, all the roads, all the details.” You should have a look at this video on drawing Rome, as mentioned a city he never visited before:\n\nStephen has shown us that while most of us seem intent to be bound by the shackles of what we determine to be ‘real’ or ‘possible’, others like Stephen are out there actually pushing the limits and showing us all how narrow-minded and naive we all are. In Stephens own words on what we can learn from him: “I would say that I have overcome many hurdles in life, even when it seemed that I would never get there or people would assume so, I have grown confident and challenge myself every day. I keep working on my skills to become even better than I am now. I believe in myself and my work, and I do the best I can and never stop.” If you want to learn more on Steven, check this documentary:\n\nSo, we talked about computer and intelligence and from Steven, the Human Camera, it is easy to switch to the recent release of Microsoft HoloLens 2 which also contains a camera to realize virtual and augmented reality. At the end of February, Microsoft used the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona to announce the next version of its HoloLens mixed reality visor. Check these reviews on the websites of techcrunch.com and cnet.com.\n\nDick Swaab and many others say that in order to keep your brains in shape (and postpone dementia) you should continuously challenge and stimulate them. This can be done by expressing creativity, for instance in art or with music. It can promote social coherence, improve the mood and reduce pain when used in therapy. Using the HoloLens can open a new world of brain stimulation.\n\nAccording to Dick Swaab, it is not a big jump from one autistic disorder to other disorders, like psychopathy. If you think psychopaths are far away from you, you should look around you. When talking about psychopaths, people automatically think of serial killers or other strange characters, like Ted Bundy, Charles Manson or Jack the Ripper. I don’t want to make you scared, but do you know which professions have the most psychopaths and which have the fewest? You will be surprised to find out that CEO is the profession with the most psychopaths. Here is the overview:\n\nTo calm you down, psychopath doesn’t just mean someone who cuts you up with a chainsaw 😊. I am more on the left side than the right side. If you want to learn more about this, check this website. On which side are you?\n\nBack to brain stimulation and the HoloLens. Does it stimulate the brain when combined with Artificial Intelligence? I wrote about Artificial intelligence as being the end of Homo Sapiens in my November 2017 blog. Yuval Noah Harari is convinced that within 20 years Google algorithms will know us better than we know ourselves and I mentioned I am not convinced Yuval is right. We talked about AI during the Dick Swaab lecture and he confirmed that AI can indeed do some things better than humans (like playing chess or make a specific forecast) but doing different things at the same time by connecting various zones like the human brain can, will take long before that gets in motion with AI. Despite the worrying rhetoric about AI coming to take your jobs, lives, freedom and general sense of purpose, it’s been most successful when applied to narrow problems and, even then, constrained by the smartness of humans around it. In that blog, I already mentioned intelligent algorithms are idiot savants.\n\nIt is easy to forgive people for thinking that deep learning is incredibly intelligent. However, once you dig into deep learning, you’ll find that as opposed to being a generally brilliant algorithm it compares more with a Savant than with Albert Einstein, considering Albert Einstein was a very intelligent human being. AI is a Savant. In other words, a deep learning process is really smart at a specific task or two, but not smart at all for anything else.\n\nTo prove that some algorithms are not even doing that one task very well, I give you the example of Facebook banning a user from posting a photo of a 30,000-year-old statue of a naked woman. The Venus of Willendorf, which dates back 29,500 years, is considered one of the world’s earliest depictions of female fertility and Facebook algorithm censored it as being pornographic. The Natural History Museum of Vienna, which houses the figurine, has attacked Facebook and they apologized for censoring that prehistoric figurine and said it being an incident.\n\nSo, what AI enabled machines still are is an idiot savant. When we saw Rain Man we saw Raymond still needs his brother to focus that attention to a specific problem, define it for him, help prune the hypotheses and help him learn. After that, he became a useful idiot savant, but still nowhere close to an entity that will take your job in any given moment. An interesting book on AI is a book by Prof. Marvin Minsky. In his book, Society of Mind, Dr. Minsky approaches AI from a high and practical level, describing the mind as an aggregation of specialized units that evolve to perform specific tasks. (This part is inspired by an article written by Paolo Pignatelli). It is based on the assumptions that the statistical manipulations that we use today under the name of Artificial Intelligence are, ‘intelligent’. They are intelligent in that they do what we tell them to do.\n\nA pigeon will return to its home, but is a pigeon intelligent? It is certainly more intelligent than most AI devices of the same size. Intelligent? There is some scare talk now about how dangerous AI face recognition is, but cats and dogs do it all the time. We properly distinguish between a genius’ intelligence and that of a savant even when they perform similar tasks. Intelligence may well be some optimal collaboration of smaller units. Without a critical level of collaboration, we do not call a person’s mind ‘intelligent’. Take a vow of Microsoft Azure AI, a pinch of AWS terabyte storage, a dash of NVIDIA, a spoonful of Alphabet TensorFlow, and voilà, the evil genius that we need legislate against. Naturally, this is poppycock! A society of artificial idiot savants, which is where we are right now in the development of machine intelligence, poses no more danger to society than a society of human ones. We are grateful for the idiot savants amongst us now, for their gifts illuminate our understanding of intelligence and of society.\n\nEven with all the amazing examples of progress in artificial intelligence, such as self-driving cars and the victories of AlphaGo, the technology is still very narrow in its accomplishments and far from autonomous. Ergo, today’s machine-learning systems are AI savants. Self-driving cars and speech recognition are based on machine learning. If you want to learn how machines learn you should watch this video:\n\nAnd even today, 99 percent of machine learning is based on human work. Machine learning still needs large amounts of data, all of which needs to be labeled (Metadata): this is a dog; this is a cat, that is a pigeon and then people need to supply the appropriate algorithms. All this relies on manual labor. The key to recognizing the limitations of today’s AI is understanding the difference between autonomy and intelligence. People have both. AI systems, even if they have very high intelligence for a specific task, tend to be low in autonomy. And that lack of autonomy limits the technology’s ability to take on many broad problems. Despite the limitations, there are many potential applications in science, healthcare and other sectors. AI is a tool, the choice of how it gets deployed is a human choice. Model building, instead of pattern recognition, can help AI systems develop new skills, like playing an unfamiliar game or recognizing new handwritten characters. The study of the human mind will play a key role in developing this technology in the future.\n\nIn our spotlight article ‘Trends impacting the Rental Industry’, we give some examples of how AI can add value to the rental industry in help making decisions. Rental items, similar to pigeons, typically return home. Very ‘intelligent’ items and even worse than pigeons as the items rented sometimes return home in a different shape or size (think of scaffolding), actually being another item. See also our spotlight item ‘Differences between Bulk, Serialized and Project Driven rental types’.\n\nAverage ERP systems cannot handle that very well. They try to use the RMA process for returned rental items. Our Dynamics Rental Management solution for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations supports this process very well. A very intelligent solution, but only when used by intelligent users that feed the system with proper data.\n\nKind regards,\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nOn behalf of HSO Innovation\n\nFor many, the end of the year is full of traditions. Some say it is the most wonderful time of the year. The whole world takes on a magic glow, people seem merrier and in the Northern hemisphere, the winter including artificial lights somehow feels as if it is cozier. Whether you are celebrating a religious festival, like Hanukkah or Christmas, or a more secular occasion, you are sure to have your own selection of traditions, rituals or customs that make the holiday season and life in general so special. Christmas is only one of the traditions and there are several remarkable events happening around the world.\n\nFor instance, Ligligan Parul Sampernandu (Giant Lantern Festival) is held each year on the Saturday before Christmas Eve in the city of San Fernando. The festival attracts spectators from all over the country and across the globe. Eleven barangays or villages take part in the festival and competition is fierce as everyone pitches in trying to build the most elaborate lantern. Originally, the lanterns were simple creations around half a meter in diameter, made from papel de hapon (Japanese origami paper) and lit by a candle. Today, the lanterns are made from a variety of materials and have grown to around six meters in size. They are illuminated by electric bulbs that sparkle in a kaleidoscope of patterns.\n\nOr what to think of Gävle Goat in Sweden. Since 1966, a 13-meter-tall Yule Goat has been built in the center of Gävle’s Castle Square for the Advent, but this Swedish Christmas tradition has unwittingly led to another tradition of sorts: people trying to burn it down. Since 1966 the Goat has been successfully burned down 29 times and the most recent destruction was in 2016.\n\nAustria shows the evil Santa Claus with Krampus. Japan is not doing so much with Christmas but has a Kentucky Fried Christmas Dinner. The Icelandic have the Yule Lads. Perhaps one of the most unorthodox Christmas Eve traditions can be found in Norway, where people hide their brooms. It is a tradition that dates back centuries when people believed that witches and evil spirits came out on Christmas Eve looking for brooms to ride on. To this day, many people still hide their brooms in the safest place in the house to stop them from being stolen.\n\nThe US has, amongst other things, the Lighting of National Hanukkah Menorah, Washington D.C. If you want to have a rolling Christmas, you better go to Caracas, Venezuela. Every Christmas Eve, the city’s residents head to church in the early morning – nothing special – but, for some reason, they do so on roller skates. This unique tradition is so popular that roads across the city are closed to cars so that people can skate to church in safety, before heading home for the less-than-traditional Christmas dinner of tamales, a wrap made from cornmeal dough and stuffed with meat and then steamed. Colombia has the Day of the Little Candles, where Toronto Canada is celebrating Cavalcade of Lights.\n\nBesides the end of the year traditions, each country has its own, sometimes very strange customs. They may appear a little odd to some, but to others, they are part of their history and heritage. The US recently celebrated Thanksgiving Day followed by Black Friday, Ciber Monday and #Giving Tuesday.\n\nHave you ever heard of the popular Swedish drinking game pen-in-bottle? Do you know what Jarping is? Or the reason why a bunch of people choose to hurl themselves down a steep hill in pursuit of a large wheel of cheese each year? There are various flavors of celebrating carnival, but the one in Ivrea Italy is based on a locally famous Battle of the Oranges.\n\nAnd what to think of 5 parties for 1 celebration? Wedding celebrations can involve five parties in some parts of the Middle East, beginning with the engagement party and ending with the wedding shower, seven days after the marriage.\n\nYou better take along your umbrella if you’re in Poland on Śmigus Dyngus, also known as Wet Monday. Śmigus Dyngus is an opportunity to stage the ultimate water fight. Held each year on Easter Monday in Poland and Ukraine, participants blast each other with water to celebrate Easter.\n\nFinger-pulling is no laughing matter in the Alps. Finger wrestling was once used to settle disputes but is now a competition that is taken quite seriously by the contenders. The winner is the person who manages to pull the other contestant across the table, using only his or her finger! Contenders pick their digit carefully and subject it to rigorous training regimes involving crushing tennis balls and doing one finger pull-ups!\n\nIn the UK every Spring Bank Holiday near Gloucester sees the annual Cooper’s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake take place. Participants line up in groups of about twenty to chase after a substantial wheel of cheese as it descends perilously down a steep incline. This “world-famous event” often results in injuries to onlookers, a great lump of cheese is quite a hazard when rolled down a hill at speed. Also, in the UK, jarping is a game where you try crack someone else’s boiled egg without cracking your own. This is very popular in North-East England and there’s even a World Jarping Championships in Peterlee, Durham, each Easter.\n\nThe ridiculous but fun pen-in-bottle drinking game in Sweden involves securing a pen on a length of string tied around one’s waist and then competing to be the first person to lower one’s pen into an empty bottle using one’s waist. Last but not least I’d like to mention Tomato craze in Spain: La Tomatina. It is a strange culture among the Valencians in Bunol where the biggest tomato fight that exists is held.\n\nIf you are interested to learn more on traditions by country you should check this page at Wikipedia. I don’t think the overview is complete, so you are invited to enrich the list with your own country’s traditions.\n\nExactly 4 years ago I wrote about Black Friday as well as a particular tradition we have in the Netherlands called Sinterklaas. This tradition is under significant pressure since it became controversial and you see a change in the way it celebrated. Is that a problem? Not really, at least that is what I think (and so does Olaf Tempelman, a Volkskrant journalist in an article on December 1, 2018). Spanish bullfighting, Australian dwarf tossing, Sinterklaas, each controversial tradition is subject to change or will eventually stop. As Woody Allen said in Deconstructing Harry: “Tradition is the illusion of permanence.” Some people may think that traditions exist for centuries in the same form. But if we look at Sinterklaas only a couple of decennia ago, Black Pete changed from somebody who scared the children to a children’s friend and catalyst of retail purchases. Even without being disputed for racism the metamorphose would have happened, but at a slower pace. And the fact that it now happens under full attention has the same effect as waking the sleeping dogs. A judge already concluded that Black Pete is unnecessary hurting black compatriots, but you cannot put a tradition in jail.\n\nTraditions are hard to ban and result in recalcitrance. The British fox hunt was abandoned in 2004 in the Hunting Act. Even this year almost every Sunday costumed horsemen chase foxes and so are the little people still flying through the air in Australian pubs and even babies in Maharashtra India. Since traditions touch people’s emotions, it is hard to change them fast or forced, like that oil tanker turning. Traditions link to memories and the identity of a country or region. Cutting a tradition is different than stopping death penalties or compulsory military service.\n\nEach tradition is unique, but the behavior of supporters is most often the same. Each tradition under fire results in dividing the community where the tradition exists. In that sense, Sinterklaas can be compared with the bullfighting in Castile and Catalonia Spain, where the entry of Sinterklaas is like the San Fermin festivities in Pamplona. People who are against bullfighting fight with fans which leads to injuries without any bull involved! The activism is having an effect though, since bullfighting became controversial. And so is Black Pete at Sinterklaas. Black Pete is slowly changing into various colored versions, like Rainbow Pete, Stroopwafel Pete or Soot Sweeper Pete as a non-controversial Pete, and that is fine. Francis Fukuyama described tradition as the cement of society. A non-controversial tradition is evolving with the community. A controversial tradition only survives in cleared or unruly versions. Instead of dwarf’s, ordinary people wearing helmets fly through the Australian pubs. Controversial traditions are doomed to evolve from mainstream to marginal, and once marginal they tend to be unrulier, hence the hooligans interfering the entry of Sinterklaas recently: the protectors surrounding the tradition.\n\nInformation technology has been around for a long, long time. As long as people have been around, information technology has been around because there were always ways of communicating through technology available at that point in time. The electronic information technology as we know it can be defined as the time since 1940. The term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review. Certainly not a long tradition, but it has undergone some metamorphoses since then. The most recent metamorphose is the shift to cloud computing. Similar like company lifecycles, the lifecycle of traditions in Information technology are getting shorter. As you might have seen, we have changed the name of our company with the purpose of a longer lifecycle of the company.\n\nThe traditional brand of Dynamics Software has disappeared after 13 years! We have taken steps to further unite our brand into the HSO Group by becoming part of and changing the name to HSO Innovation. We have been an integral part of the HSO Group since the foundation of Dynamics Software in 2005. I received mixed responses to the announcement we have published on November 26, 2018. They varied from many congratulations to considering it might be the end of a business relation. I want to thank all that took the effort to respond and look forward in continuing the business with everyone.\n\nWithin Information Technology the use of business applications is a hard to compare tradition to the ones mentioned earlier on since they are only a couple of decennia old. But the tradition in business applications until recently has always been that they were installed at customers premises, leading to significant efforts to install and manage the applications. Microsoft betted their company on going 3 clouds since February 1, 2010, when Azure was first released. Azure was announced in October 2008, started with codename “Project Red Dog.” It is a different way of consuming business applications, not as a product, but as a service. This service includes more than just running the systems on somebody else’s computer. Microsoft has calculated in that they might lose some of the customers who want to continue to work on premise. We also calculated in that we run the risk that some partners don’t like our name change. But as I wrote in the press release: “The name will change, but the essence of the way we work will stay the same. Our customers, partners and our employees should benefit from the strategic positioning of HSO Innovation as part of the HSO Group. HSO Innovation today is present on all continents with the support of its Dynamics Apps channel. With this strategic update, we aim to grow market share and extend our footprint on these continents by adding value with new innovation services.”\n\nDuring the coming holiday season, our thoughts turn gratefully to those who have made our success possible. We have always deeply valued our relationship. We are looking forward to continuing our relationship with you. Enjoy your traditions.\n\nKind regards,\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\non behalf of HSO Innovation\n\nThe era of BIG numbers is continuing. In my June 2018 blog, I already wrote about big numbers and big data, mentioned Microsoft’s market capitalization and predicted that the Azure Cloud financial figures probably would look great.\n\nIt was not so difficult to predict that, and it was even an understatement as headlines proved after Microsoft announced their financial results. Here is just one example:\n\nOn 12 July, Microsoft market capitalization exceeded $800bn for the first time. But there is always big, bigger and biggest. 1.000.000.000.000 is the number we saw passing by in August and September, the market cap of both Apple and Amazon reaching those highs. Clearly, Apple won the race to reach $1 trillion in market capitalization. Mad Money according to CNBC’s Jim Cramer. Well, give me a piece of that mad money and I would be more than happy with it.\n\nThese market cap figures are larger than the national income of the majority of countries in the world and the respective CEO’s are potentially more powerful than most political leaders of these countries. These companies have become so big that raises questions. Do they cause antitrust issues? Is there enough regulation in place to make sure they don’t hold too much economic and political power? For this money, you can buy 15 of the most expensive companies in Germany, including SAP. BTW, is it a coincidence that the 6 most expensive companies are all cloud companies? Oracle, IBM, and SAP are following as software vendors and service providers. There is a nice clickable visual on this website.\n\nThe Dynamics growth figures were even higher than I expected, and Microsoft’s revenue is more diversified than any other cloud company.\n\n“The law of large numbers is kicking in,” Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne told CNBC in an interview, referring to Azure’s growth. “The base is getting bigger. It is growing faster than Amazon Web Services did when it was at a similar size. This is probably a $9 billion business growing at more than 80 percent.”\n\nAll Microsoft partners gathered mid-July to attend Microsoft Inspire in Las Vegas, the traditional kickoff of Microsoft’s new fiscal year. If you have been following the Microsoft news, then most of the Inspire 2018 news has already been highlighted, but there is 1 sentence of Satya Nadella worth mentioning again. This is the 1 short sentence with which he summed up what the difference is between Microsoft and Apple or Amazon. On stage, and earlier in a recent interview with Cnet, Nadella shared some insights into the inner workings of Microsoft, including what he has tried to change about the company. On the quest of hiring the best employees, Satya’s said, “You join here, not to be cool, but to make others cool.”. Please read the full analysis here.\n\nThe shift to subscription-based services will further increase. I already noticed the same concepts for the fashion, airline and many more industries. But I also see a risk of a subscription disease. In my personal life, I am getting fed up with all these subscriptions like Spotify, Netflix and more, leading to a high level of continuous returning variable base costs. Also, with the power and market dominance of the software companies mentioned above the risk of price increases is not far away. Microsoft already announced changed pricing for Office 2019 and Windows Server Version 2019.\n\nOn another note, the cloud promise and constant evergreen upgrades without disruption are nearly there. Microsoft has announced the way they modernize updating Microsoft Dynamics 365. Please read the message and think of this for a while. It at least means that the pace of our newsletters updates is slower than the updates Microsoft will implement! Compared to doing an update once per 3, 4 or 5 years this is going to happen each month. There is no other business application vendor in combination with a platform that can deliver that. What does this mean for add-ons and customizations? It makes more sense to take the ISV business serious, not only from the ISV perspective but also from a Customer and Partner perspective. Microsoft is exactly doing that. Only dedicated and focused ISV’s can keep hold of Microsoft’s speed of updating. Similar to constant updates I talked about constant acquisitions earlier. The market of enterprise software and service provides is following the automotive market, where there are only a few large players with multiple brands left, trying to distinguish themselves more on emotion and image than on product. How can software vendors do that? “We are here to make others cool.”.\n\nSo, the number of players in the world of software vendors is getting smaller and smaller and the same is true for the number of partners in the Microsoft Dynamics 365 world. The number is smaller, but the size of each partner is getting larger. So, if you as a company are looking for a new solution it is getting easier and more difficult at the same time. The same is true with elections and chances of winning. As we have seen above magic is in the numbers and as you may know, numbers always attract me. Politicians and companies can learn from mathematical challenges.\n\nHere is the story of Pete and Mary playing a game which I read in a column of Ionica Smeets. There are 4 vases filled with 5 marbles. Each vase has 4 white and 1 red marble. They both may pick 4 marbles from 1 or more vases blindfolded. The person with the largest number of red marbles wins the game. Pete may start and decides to pick a marble from each vase. Mary decides to pick the remaining 4 marbles from 1 vase. Who do you think has the biggest chance of winning? Pete seems very smart as Mary can only pick 1 red marble at max and he has a chance of picking 4 red marbles!\n\nLet’s calculate their chances and start with Mary’s point of view. Her chance of picking a red marble is zero (0) or one (1). The chance of her picking zero red marbles is one-fifth (1/5), because that is the chance of Pete picking that 1 red marble from her vase. If that is the case, then Pete always has a higher chance of picking the most red marbles. This way his chance of winning is 1/5.\n\nBut now let’s look at it from a different perspective. Mary has a chance of 4/5 to pick a red marble. Then there are 3 more potential results:\n\nIf Pete did not pick a red marble at all, Mary wins\n\nIf Pete exactly picked 1 red marble, they end equally\n\nand if Pete has more than 1 red marble he wins\n\nIn case 1) the chance of Pete not picking a red marble out of the first vase is 4/5. The vases are independent and the chance of Mary winning is 4/5 x 4/5 x 4/5 x 4/5 = 256/625 or around 41 %.\n\nIn case 2) Mary has 1 red marble and the chance of Pete picking one red marble from the other 3 vases is 3 x 1/5 x 4/5 x 4/5 = 48/125 (need to multiply by 3 since the red marble may come from any of the 3 vases). And then further multiplied by the chance of Mary picking 1 red marble makes it a chance of 192/625 or ± 31% to equal.\n\nIn case 3) the chance of Pete beating Mary with a larger number of red marbles is 52/625 (feel free to make the calculation 😊 and if you enjoy doing this, then do this again with vases filled with n white marbles and 1 red marble). Adding the 1/5 chance of Mary picking zero red marbles makes Pete’s chance of winning 177/625 or ± 28%.\n\nDouble check: 41% + 31% + 28% = 100 % (Yes!). So: Mary by far has the best chance to win with the strategy she followed. Having 1 red marble is often enough to win. The lesson for politicians and companies: it is better to win by forming a coalition and win with a narrow majority than with trying to gather a huge majority for only a few of your proposals, topics or products.\n\nTo bouncer off in sports, we see it is hard to reach the top and it is even more difficult to stay there. Last week I attended the HSO UK Advance 2018 customer day in the beautiful Williams F1 Conference Centre and the theme was about driving high performance into your digital future.\n\nRichard West was one of the presenters and talked about the need to focus on continuous performance improvement and gave some nice insights in the F1 industry. Richard is the co-author of ‘Performance at the Limit – Business Lessons from Formula 1 Motor Racing’ (Written by Jenkins, Pasternak, and West and Published by Cambridge University Press).\n\nI have often made the comparison between sports and business. Richard made very clear to me that it makes sense by quoting the owner of the Williams F1 team Sir Frank Williams: ‘For two on a Sunday afternoon it’s a sport, the rest of the time it’s business!’…\n\nRichard talked about things that form the basis or prerequisites of becoming a successful team. It’s about people, winning team culture, focus, behavior and continuous performance improvement with a plan-do-review cycle. The original book may be a bit older, but the lessons are so true. Yesterday I attended the introduction evening for parents of my youngest daughter who is now going to middle school and the director said: “You cannot not learn”. Focus is related to constant learning and to a winning culture described in The Performance Pyramid which is nicely explained in this video of professor Mark Jenkins:\n\nTo repeat the lesson mentioned earlier: it is better to win by forming a coalition and win with a narrow majority, than with trying to gather a huge majority for only a few of your products. I enjoy being a Microsoft partner.\n\nKind regards,\n\nOn behalf of Dynamics Software\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nThank you for reading our June 2018 newsletter.\n\nAnother June, another fiscal year-end for Microsoft. I look forward to seeing Microsoft’s financial results. Not because I am a shareholder (I’m not), which I regret given the fact that Microsoft surpassed Alphabet’s market capitalization on May 29th this year.\n\nI trust that the financial figures related to Azure cloud services will look great, although Microsoft will probably not reach their internal targets for Dynamics 365. I do believe the increase will be significant and probably above market average which will result in a larger market share of implemented business applications. If you set your targets unrealistically high it may look bad (internal) but look good (external), at the same time as you beat your competitor’s growth. Read this interesting article on Forbes.com to find out more why Microsoft will hit the $1T market cap 3 years before Alphabet will.\n\nCoincidence or not I came across the quote of the day on Forbes.com when reading the article. The quote read: “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short, but in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark”. I doubt whether POTUS would subscribe to that quote from the great Michelangelo.\n\nIt was funny to see the size of the envelope Trump received from Kim Jung Un by the way. Sometimes I do get complaints that my blogs are too long, but apparently Kim writes extremely long letters that they require this size of envelopes. Social media immediately busted on the size of the envelop but I’m sure it contains very interesting information which was transferred in an old-fashioned secure way: the letter.\n\nOn May 25th the General Data Protection Regulation (European Regulation 2016/679) came into effect. I’m not sure what your personal thoughts are about the regulation but instead of expecting to receive less emails, I only received more! I wonder how Trump was informed about these privacy updates. Could it be that he also received them in old-fashioned and oversized envelopes?\n\nAs you may know, the IT sector is often filed with buzzwords such as Internet of Things, Digital Transformation, Blockchain, to name a few. Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked and secured using cryptography. I will save you any further technical details on blockchain, but there’s a certain paradox between blockchain and GDPR. The immutable nature of blockchain networks could break Europe’s new GDPR rules. In some ways GDPR has an opposite effect when it comes to making blockchain architecture GDPR compliant. But when implemented properly, a distributed ledger technology could be part of a solution for compliance. If you want to find our more, I encourage you to read this article on Computerworld.\n\nDynamics Software sponsored the 2018 European Rental Association Convention, held in May in Vienna. This is one of the few events C-level management attends. During the event there was a special interest workshop on Digital Transformation. The workshop discussed the future of rental and the effects of Digital Transformation such as payment models, the viability of physical stores, Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. One of the conclusions on going digital in rental is that it can only work if there is availability and accessibility of equipment, and trust.\n\nThe closing keynote was given by Austrian born Oxford professor Viktor-Mayer Schönberger . He is the co-author of “Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think” (2013) and “Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age” (2009!). Those subjects are an important part of the GDPR. His most recent book is called “The Data Economy”. In his very interesting presentation he talked about data and decision making, and as you may recall from my previous blogs, these are one of my favorite topics.\n\nA nice example about insights in data in his presentation was that for years marketers would fret over the question: Which is America’s favorite pie? Everybody knows the most popular pie in the US is apple pie. Right? Why? It was because supermarkets stated that the 12-inch apple pie had the highest sales. But a couple of years ago somebody did research and when asking people what their favorite pie was, it appeared that nobody really liked apple pie. Most Americans would name cherry pie, apricot pie or any other kind of pie as their favorite. Hardly anybody would answer apple pie.\n\nIt so happens that when families discuss which kind of pie to buy, apple pie is often chosen as some sort of compromise. When negotiating, apple pie turns out to give the least problems because nobody really dislikes apple pie. For want of any other option, Americans were forced to buy large apple pies.\n\nAs a matter of fact, a 12-inch apple pie is really big. Big enough to feed an entire family. The researcher noted that perhaps we were asking the wrong question. Instead of asking what your favorite pie is, we should ask what the right size of apple pie is for supermarkets to store. Analytics revealed that the ideal size of a pie should be about 5 inches, so that people who liked apple pie could buy it per requirement, and not be compelled to buy in excess. Once this issue was addressed and pies were baked accordingly, apple pie sales shot up. Prices came down too, as economies of scale kicked in. A great example of big data helping us to ask the right questions.\n\nYou can watch a 2015 presentation of Viktor here:\n\nIn his presentation Victor also gave the example of Duolingo, a phone app used to learn new languages. Data patterns revealed that the Spanish were not able to learn English in the way it was offered through this app. They got down to fixing the problem, and today Duolingo has a special app for the Spanish to learn English. A customized solution to a unique problem.\n\nWalmart stores in America always see a spike in the sale of strawberry pop tarts, whenever there is a hurricane warning. Why does this happen? Is it because the sugary content is comforting at times of extreme stress? The data does not tell us why. And it is not very interesting for Walmart as well. All they need to do is make sure that pop tarts are available and easy to pick up when a hurricane is arriving. We don’t always need to know why and establish a causal effect relationship.\n\nTo avert impending death on premature babies a certain experiment was carried out in Canada. Besides providing emergency medical support, the aim was to see if Big Data could be used to save lives. Digital sensors were primed into action, which showed up to 1200 data points per baby per second. In the process an interesting pattern emerged. 24 hours before the onset of a major infection, the vital signs of the babies would stabilize. Almost like a lull before the storm. The doctors did not know why, but it was enough for them to tease out the value from this data to save lives. It acted as warning 24 hours in advance.\n\nDatabases and data can be hard to see trough. On what do you focus, and what do you see, or do you hear? This is being nicely illustrated in the recent Laurel or Yanny viral that is scientifically explained in this video:\n\nA similar challenge occurs visually with the color of these tennis balls, You may also remember the color of the dress viral from 2015. Or the number of circles you see in the next picture?\n\nCreated by Anthony Norcia, the illusion won the ‘Illusion of the Year’ contest in 2006. The image called the ‘Coffer Illusion’ shows a pattern of rectangles, but something is hidden is plain sight. The Coffer Illusion may initially appear as a series of sunken rectangular pattern, but after a few seconds, your brain’s representation of the image may ‘flip’ to give you the experience of 16 circles in the background. Some people are unable to see it.\n\nThe normal way of looking at data is: question -> data -> answer. But are we asking the right questions? Viktor is convinced that the more data is available, the more questions you can ask. This will in the end lead to innovation and he gave the self-driving car and Amazon (revenue growing 30% after introduction of recommendations) as examples.\n\nBecause google collected 1000000000 data per second compared to traditional car producers, they are better capable in driving the self-driving car innovation. Less is more and more is better, but relative to what you are looking for.\n\nIn Germany Lufthansa flight data are now used to do better weather forecasts and Inrix used to better predict traffic jams. Inrix is a leading traffic intelligence provider. Its services are widely used by commuters to avail the best routes and avoid traffic jams. Obviously Inrix has a repository of gargantuan sized data sets. Some part of that data was used to draw out a correlation between traffic movement around shopping malls, and the revenue that was generated from these malls. Predictive Analytics came into play to predict future sales as well. A classic case of how data is being reused to generate value for an altogether different business line. Car sharing could be a solution to reduce traffic jams, but the problem is that 70% of the drivers think they drive better than other drivers. It is why people also are afraid of flying. They like to be in control which flying, and carpooling do not allow. Similarly, with Big Data, privacy and decision making, in the end, comes to trust and therefore trust is the currency of Big Data sustainability. How will your customers get value out of data?\n\nBut why should we hand over our data to others when we receive nothing in return? Car manufacturers, banks and software providers should consider this when attempting to collect data. The recent Facebook consumer privacy scandal with Cambridge Analytica has focused attention on the importance of trust. Why should we trust Facebook or other technology providers to follow through on privacy promises when they have demonstrated that they are willing to flaunt their internal policies and government oversight when the need suits them? Trust is about humility and humanity.\n\nAs Rep. Michael Doyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania asked Mark Zuckerberg; “Today, we are at a reflection point in the debate over (consumer) data privacy and regulation which has impact on brands and technology companies that provide the tools”. It is about the terms of trust and consumers are prepared to share information about themselves in return for something which make it better for them (products and/or services). But like with the planes and the carpool they will only do that if they can control and understand what’s happening with their data. Trust is everything. The next leading brands will be the most trusted brands.\n\nThis summer I will be attending Microsoft’s Inspire in Las Vegas followed by a holiday in the Western part of US with my family. I am looking forward to apple pie, not strawberry pop tarts. And if too hot, like most of the data centers, you can always go take a swim with the Microsoft’s deep sea data center.\n\nWhat will happen when this data center leaks? In all cases you should always clean your own leaks, like the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte did when dropping his coffee cup.\n\nWishing you a hot and Big Data summer with lots of coffee!\n\nKind regards,\n\nOn behalf of Dynamics Software\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nThank you for reading our April 2018 newsletter.\n\neXtreme is the theme. Why? Doing normal is not the norm anymore. It seems everything has to go faster, further, better, higher, cheaper, eXtremer than before. I am in the Microsoft business for 15 years now and heard at the most recent conference that there has never been a better time to partner with Microsoft. This is what I have heard for 15 years and it is probably true. I look forward to the next 15 years. I have attended many Microsoft and related events and that is why I am often there as a veteran, I even won the most expensive medal being such a veteran.\n\nIn the past Microsoft Dynamics was quite synoptic since it was siloed in classic Microsoft (Windows, Office, etc.) and the business applications division (Microsoft Dynamics) with products for CRM, ERP (in multiple flavors: AX, GP, NAV and SL) and BI. Since the introduction of Gartner on the Pace-Layered Application Strategy and IT Organizational Design with systems of record, systems of differentiation and systems of innovation, Microsoft introduced Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is core to Microsoft and customers and is creating opportunities in areas where Dynamics Software has not been in or after before, like D365 for Sales, D365 for Field Service, PowerBI, PowerApps and so on and so forth. The digital feedback loop Microsoft introduced recently during the Business Forward Event and the Spring 2018 release proves why there has never been a better time than to partner and use Microsoft Business applications. The story is getting better every 6 months.\n\nI am not going to explain these loops, you can find a lot online on this by following the session links above or read James Philips’ blog. Given Dynamics being core to Microsoft, accordingly and especially since Microsoft stopped organizing their Convergence (Dynamics only) event, all the relevant event organizers, like the User Groups and eXtreme started changing their event names from CRM and AX to “Something 365”. I expect Directions with focus on NAV, now Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central will follow soon. So, 2 weeks ago I was a rookie attending eXtreme 365 for the first time and everything was eXtreme indeed. The location, the event, the people, the presentations, the food, the drinks and more. The event was in the beautiful Croatian city of Dubrovnik, a city full of eXtremes, tourist visitors, history, food and (normally) beautiful weather.\n\nI was surprised the event was not named Croatia 365 since the Croatian tourism offices are already operating under that name with a nice logo:\n\nIs Microsoft sponsoring Croatia? The event was a perfect mix of great content and nice people of Microsoft, partners and customers. The presentations were good, especially if you consider it took Cecilia Flombaum and Mike Ehrenberg 3, 4 or 5 flights and up to 40 hours to get to Dubrovnik (and to get out of Dubrovnik). I was invited by Microsoft to present in 2 of their presentations. Unfortunately one session only had 2 attendees and one of them was not even coming for the content of the presentation, but to speak to me right after the session. The other session had a full room with interesting discussions on adding field service to the partner practice. For that session I was introduced by Lutz Jannausch as Mr. Service and I am proud getting that label. Thank you Lutz for that introduction, but now my wife is expecting me to do deliver full service in the house!\n\nMy sister in law is Croatian, so I knew that food, drinks and hospitality are of top priority. And yes, there is a logo for Croatia and good food as well.\n\nWe had very nice dinners and I think I grew 5 kilograms only that week! But the weather……. My sister in law says the sun is always shining in Croatia. Well, not the week of eXtreme: eXtreme winds were holding the planes to land in Dubrovnik Airport. On the way to Dubrovnik many flights were rerouted via Split or Zagreb, but fortunately not ours, we were lucky. The return flight was a different story though. Arriving at a brand new empty airport already made me a bit suspicious. And yes, the flight got cancelled and we were booked on a 5 hour bus drive to Split and then on a flight to Zagreb, where we enjoyed an extra hotel overnight in the lovely Sheraton hotel to catch the next day flight to Amsterdam. What a joy! My colleague decided to opt for the Frankfurt flight and we contested on who would be at home first. The Sheraton hotel in Zagreb was nice, but we had to leave early to catch the flight to Amsterdam. So, we received a breakfast bag on our way to airport. And since Croatia Airlines provided business class tickets we had another breakfast in the lounge, followed by the 3rd breakfast in the business class on the plane. And given the fact that breakfast is always one of my daily highlights, I grew another 2 kilos…… By the way: we won the contest arriving at 1.30 PM (36 hours of travel) and my colleague at 5.30 PM.\n\nThis dubious travel achievement followed another recent travel disaster from England where we were caught by severe snow storms resulting in cancelled flights, terrible bus and train rides arriving 36 hours later than originally planned. And there was another one recently where the weather had a lot of influence causing significant delays. Has the climate changed and do we have more severe weather conditions or is just a coincidence as I travel a lot? This, as well as the suspected link between Microsoft 365 and Croatia 365 and the fact that many houses are for sale in my neighbourhood, reminded me on a story I recently read about the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy or clustering illusion. Friends visiting us concluded something must be wrong with our neighbourhood given the number of houses for sale. This is known as the Texas sharpshooter fallacy, an informal fallacy ignoring the difference while focusing on the similarities, thus coming to an inaccurate conclusion. The fallacy’s name comes from a parable in which a Texan fires his gun at the side of a barn, paints a bullseye around the bullet hole, and claims to be a sharpshooter. Though the shot may have been totally random, he makes it appear as though he has performed a highly non-random act. In normal target practice, the bullseye defines a region of significance, and there’s a low probability of hitting it by firing in a random direction. However, when the region of significance is determined after the event has occurred, any outcome at all can be made to appear spectacularly improbable. It is explained in this video:\n\nThe clustering of the houses for sale can be a coincidence or have another cause than the reputation of the neighborhood. The clustering illusion is something seen in epidemiology where people link concentrations of a certain disease (like cancer) to something in the area (water- or air pollution, power cables, factories), but exceptional outcomes on small numbers don’t prove significant causal interrelations. Another example, it strikes most people as unexpected if heads comes up four times in a row during a series of coin flips. However, in a series of 20 flips, there is a 50% chance of getting four heads in a row. Don’t believe the Law of Small Numbers.\n\nWilliam Feller discovered that people easily see a pattern in random situations. During the second World War bombings in London, it appeared that some areas were bombed much more than others, letting people to believe that German spies must live in the untouched areas. William’s statistics analysis in 1950 showed that the impacts of V-2 rockets on London were a close fit to a random distribution.\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/WigglyPoliticalBellfrog\n\nAnd William is born in Croatia! Is this a coincidence or do I see a pattern here? This illusion is born in the prehistory. Our forefathers were always cautious to ensure they would survive. They tried to mastermind the cause of changes in their environments to anticipate on these changes. When asking the broker why so many houses are for sale he smiled: “It is just an area with long streets and lots of houses”.\n\nThe best 2 eXtremes I came across recently are the performance of Chris Vos at the Paralympic games in PyeongChang. At the age of 5 Vos got into an accident which resulted in his right leg being paralyzed. Chris and many others showed you can do the impossible during the Paralympic games. Chris won a silver medal in PyeongChang.\n\nLearn more on Chris in this video:\n\nAnd last Thursday, I attended a so called Winners tournament which was the best football match I have ever played. It is an indoor soccer event with and for disabled people. We played with 2 Down syndrome boys and only the goals they scored counted, just winners! Besides their enthusiasm there was 1 other thing that gave me a good feeling and that was the first time I played with someone having more grey hair than I have!\n\nTo end this blog I would love to share some funny videos on dubious travel achievements.\n\nUnnecessary words used by airlines:\n\nAnd 4 bored guys at the airport:\n\nWishing you a lot of eXtremes and sharpshooting.\n\nKind regards,\n\nOn behalf of Dynamics Software\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nThank you for reading our February 2018 newsletter.\n\nThis blog is not about phishing emails, DDos attacks or other popular hack methods. My first sentence is always the same, except the month and the year vary. Does that matter? Probably not, you might judge this as a lack of creativity or you like the consistency, something I often hear people like. By continuing reading everything you just read happened in the past. Since people spent less time on reading you see more and more the average reading time being mentioned at the top of an article. You can then decide quickly if you want to read it, have time to read it now, later, when and how. I know my audience is busy and has hardly any time to read, so I will try to keep it short and do more with less, hopefully interesting enough and hopefully you have decided to still read this. Maybe I should switch from blogging to vlogging to keep it more attractive and make some money with it on YouTube.\n\nWriting in essence is an expression of creativity and creativity is what differentiates humans from computers or robots. My creative colleague Gideon Neijs made me aware of an older TED talk from Elizbeth Gilbert, (the author of Eat, Pray, Love) about Your elusive creative genius and he thought I could use this somehow for my blogs. That is very true, I very much like Elizabeth’s insights in her life being doomed after her successful book, talking about fear of failure, anxieties and rational and the link between creation and suffering. Especially the radical idea that, instead of the rare person “being” a genius, all of us “have” a genius (as the Roman called it, where the Greek called it a demon). It’s a funny, personal and surprisingly moving talk. So, let’s drink gin at 9 am, dance the whole day and say Olé, Olé as the Spanish dancers do. Have a look:\n\nCreativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed, like an idea, a theory, art, a musical composition, a physical object, a computer program, a book or a blog. During the creativity process creators are confronted with anxiety and fear of failure. Fear of failure is also a big business model and is the reason why there is a business we supply to, which is why companies are spending money on preventive maintenance processes and systems to support that.\n\nTo overcome the anxiety and fear of failure the creator has to have a strong belief in him or herself and making the decision to persist with the work. I recently also read an article from Adam Grant, (organizational psychologist and Wharton professor and bestselling author of GIVE AND TAKE, ORIGINALS, and OPTION B) that every human has brilliant ideas and everybody could be a creator, but only few do something with it. Very interesting, but to avoid being too creative (or distracted if you like) maybe more on this in a future blog, I have decided now to continue with something else and stay persistent.\n\nLife is continuously making decisions from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed again to get some sleep. My most brilliant ideas, by the way, rise when sleeping and I have a very bad memory. As I wrote in my previous blog, decision making is mostly done on emotions (or reptile brain or system 1) instead of rational (System 2). Our marketing team recently attended a very interesting Digital Engagement Marketing Workshop offered by Microsoft. This statement on decision making was reconfirmed during that workshop and happens everywhere. The workshop was facilitated by Sharka Chobot, Chief Transformation Officer at Neural Impact and adjunct professor of marketing and behavioral science at the University of British Columbia and Joanne Charley, NI’s Chief Marketing Officer and Professor Marketing & Behavioral Science. I enjoyed working with these impactful women. And an impact it had, so much that the whole country went through a big storm in the Netherlands on January 18, 2018, the first day of the workshop.\n\nIn a previous workshop Neural Impact’s Mark Stuyt suggested to have sales and marketing think like a fish and he told a story about his brother. I am not sure if it was really his brother though. If you search online, you will find the story about Captain John Rade who has been a fisherman ever since he was a boy. He is legendary in the commercial fishing world as he’ll catch big and very valuable fish everyday he goes out to fish. It wouldn’t matter how bad the weather is or if conditions weren’t ideal. When others come home with empty nets, he always gets a fish. When interviewed about the secret of his success, John said: “It’s not really a secret. It’s pretty simple really. I just do the opposite to what most other fishermen do. You see, when most fishermen go out to fish, they think like fishermen. When I go out, I think like a fish”.\n\nYou might have heard this story before, so I won’t reproduce it to the full extent (not very creative), so if you are interested to read the full story visit this URL, but after you have finished reading this blog. The moral of the story is to think as your (prospective) customers do, be part of the tribe as you then know what they need. John has been doing that every day for 33 years now and that’s the other part of his secret. You must be consistent and focused, it’s simple, but far from easy.\n\nMaking decisions based on emotions is done everywhere illustrated by a very recent example in the European Union, which voted to ban Pulse Fishing. Pulse fishing is claimed by many conservationists to be cruel and destructive, as well as unnecessary, method of fishing. However, others see it as a more humane alternative to the destructive practices of beam trawling, in which a heavy metal bar is dragged across the sea floor ruining it. Pulse fishing sends a current of electricity through sections of the seabed, disturbing the fish and propelling some of them into the net, but beam trawling can rip up the seabed along with fish habitats. I am not an expert in fishing (I try to be a fish and get away from fishermen), but my point of view based on media reports (inspired by an article of NOS reporter Thomas Spekschoor) is that the Dutch lost as they did not anticipate on the emotions of people. Pulse fishing is a Dutch innovation and the promise is that it saves fuel significantly and is creating less damage to the ocean floor.\n\nThe Dutch approach was to convince the voters based on rational science reports with proof that pulse fishing is good. The French approach was very different. There was a dancing group visualizing the electrocution of fish, a cook explaining he could not create nice meals of pulse catch fish. Imagine the congressmen enjoying their fish meals in a picturesque restaurant in the port of a nice old Atlantic ocean town on a summer day in France. But the biggest trump were the local fishermen doing their daily jobs like they have done them for many years without innovation. I am not going to judge which party was right (I am not an expert), but clearly this is a proof that emotion is the most important thing in decision making. In the end members of European Parliament voted 402 to 232 for the prohibition, according to NGO Our Fish. Only 2 months earlier it looked like the Dutch would win this battle as the fishing committee discussed this file. 20 out of the 30 MEP fishing experts did not see any danger in pulse fishing and voted for a plan that would not harm the Dutch fishermen, only 5 voted against the plan. And normally this is where it ends, but the fishing committee decided it would be better to vote for it in the 751 member parliament of which many live in a country without a sea, let alone the north sea.\n\nThis was the chance for Bloom Association who played an important role in influencing the emotions of those members of parliament. From an office the size of a toilet they managed to speak to 100+ members. Bloom convinced them without scientific proven statements, but how would a layman know? The Dutch lobby tried to even ban Bloom for spreading lies (or is fake news a better word?). European Parliament started an investigation, but that was still running during voting. By the way, Bloom is against both fishing methods, for them it is choice between the pest or cholera, which is not the choice most of our customers have. Ours and our competitor’s solutions are so good these days, it is more a choice between paradise or heaven. You may guess which one is paradise and which one is heaven.\n\nWe recently won a huge (1500+ users) project for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service enhanced with our Advanced Field Service. Doing a software and partner selection is serious decision making which companies (and the people within those companies) try to do as rationally as possible. You can compare it with the creative process of writing a book where the customer is only writing 1 book in 5-10 years and we are writing such books multiple times per year. The big difference is that these books are written by many authors. It is true that some books are more successful than others as we have learned from Elizabeth Gilbert. But teamwork can result in multiple successful books as Nikki French have proven. And I am an optimist, so I believe there are more successes to come than there are successes behind us.\n\nAnyway, as we know emotions play that important role in software and partner selection as well. After being awarded this project we learned over dinner that thanks to the power, the trust and persistence of a few people we won the project. The only reason to contact us was their memory. They joined us for a visit to a Microsoft Executive Briefing Center based on which they remembered our experience in field service. The decision to choose Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service was against the company policy to select primarily SAP for business applications. And if, by exception, Microsoft Business Applications are selected above SAP, the implementation would normally be done through their contracted partners for the Microsoft solutions and not us. It appeared like we were very lucky as we did not really know how the hare run in that company. It made us emotional afterwards and we danced until 9 AM the next day. Without any gin. We will continue dancing, Olé, Olé.\n\nWishing you a lot of emotional decisions in creative processes.\n\nKind regards,\n\nOn behalf of Dynamics Software\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nThank you for reading our November 2017 newsletter.\n\nIt is an honor for me to write something you read. The past weeks I have been traveling a lot and attended interesting events with interesting speakers. I had the pleasure to attend Microsoft Envision in Orlando with numerous interesting speakers and attendees, like Beth Comstock, Satya Nadella and Michelle Obama. Michelle sat relaxed in an interview setting with Brad Smith, who I also mentioned in my last blog. It was a very nice interview, but there was hardly any connection to what brought us together: to learn and talk about connected devices, digital transformation, artificial intelligence and what that means to business.\n\nIn his keynote Satya updated us on Microsoft’s initiatives on Quantum Computing. As a non-technical person, I got lost on the topic after a few minutes, but from what I understood it is a very interesting and promising technology. Very intelligent people were saying very intelligent things on stage on Quantum Computing. Curious? Have a look at this video from minute 53:45. Wikipedia explains Quantum Computing in this article. I guess you all understand it now, don’t you? If not, in the below video it is explained in 2 minutes:\n\nAnd for Dummies like me:\n\nInterested in what Microsoft is doing on quantum computing? Check this and more here.\n\nThe 2017 European Utility Week, (in which we exhibited together with our partner Ferranti from Belgium) talked about connected devices, digital transformation, artificial intelligence and SMART utilities and metering. I also attended a couple of partner events and the main topic was about connected devices, artificial intelligence and digital transformation. The 2017 SMART Service and Maintenance congress also had some interesting speakers and talked about connected devices, artificial intelligence and digital transformation 😊.It looks like there is nothing else to talk about! I think Satya was right when he many years ago said that “every company is becoming a software company”. And based on my 20 years of software experience, I know software unfortunately comes with bugs for free and you have to pay to get it fixed.\n\nIt is good to see so many nice examples of smart connected devices. This is making us more and more dependent on internet and reliable electricity and connections. Power companies invest a lot in avoiding breakdowns, get inspired by the smart cable guard monitoring cables and predicting failures:\n\nDuring the same event the organizers also invited a professional hacker from the GDI Foundation on stage to update us on security leaks and vulnerabilities on the internet. Of course he talked about connected devices and the risk they bring when they are not securely connected. Actually, I learned there is even a dedicated search engine to find connected devices, Shodan. Shodan is the world’s first search engine for Internet-connected devices where you can explore the Internet of Things, monitor network security and see the bigger picture. It was amazing to hear that even today not all networks are protected against the heartbleed bug. The bug got so famous that it got a name and a logo.\n\nThis bug was introduced for free into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. 3.5 years later, despite all warnings and messaging, there are still connected and unprotected devices, even in hospitals around the corner having PC’s running Windows XP. It is costing a lot of money to repair the damage. Please, for more information see the report, after a search it returned 237,539 results on March 26, 2016. Click on the interactive map for your region. I phrase Brad Smith questioning the Envision audience (check video from 17:30) how many people are still using an iPod today? Nobody was raising the hand. The iPod was introduced 2 months after Windows XP was launched in 2001, so why are organizations still working on PC’s running Windows XP?\n\nMore recently, we were confronted with the major ransomware Petya cyber-attack infecting airlines, banks, shipping and utility organizations across Europe following just a few weeks after WannaCry attack. This is probably fresh in your memory, so I won’t dive into that. Brad is also mentioning this attack in his presentation. It is costing a lot of money to solve the collateral damage.\n\nWhat is the role of humans in this connected, digital, artificial world? The role will change, like the industrial revolution changed the role of humans. Recently, I saw a documentary on humans, gods and technology (VPRO, Tegenlicht October 29, 2017). Futurist and digital visionary Kevin Kelly talked about how Artificial intelligence can bring on a second industrial revolution. You can review his TED Talks here. In this documentary also historicist Yuval Noah Harari talked about the impact of these new technologies to the Homo Sapiens. It is funny to see a futurist and a historicist talk about the same topic. Yuval is making interesting links to sources of authorization for decision making, like religion and algorithms from Google, Bing or Facebook. Yuval is convinced that within 20 years Google algorithms will know us better than we know ourselves. If you are interested check out some of his videos or read his books. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and President Barack Obama have recommended it as a must-read. One of his quotes is that Homo Sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so. Are humans losing their autonomy? When I shared the link to the documentary to my friends via WhatsApp, one responded quite depressed on these future insights and the increased chasm between the rich and the poor, the increased silliness and disinterest of the majority.\n\nThe Chinese government already knows the Chinese population better than the Chinese people know themselves. Chinese government is storing who is tweeting what, how long people sleep, which books are read, what is eaten and how long people take a shower. This is to make people have a better and happier life, of course. Data crunchers (as part of the construction internet culture) gather much more data than required, including private data allowing them to predict negative behavior. Chinese government is also working on the mother of all data projects: building a Social Credit System. This system is not only analyzing financial reliability, but also social morale. Parents who think their children do not visit them enough can go to court. If the judge confirms the children are failing, it will costs them points to their credit score of this social system. The first debtors are exposed as the system unfolds. Using Baidu, buying at Alibaba, navigating your car or chatting on your mobile in China is adding data to the database, allowing the data crunchers to improve their algorithms. Everybody is transparent and potentially people may get punished for something they have done or said long ago. It is good that the General Data Protection Regulation has become effective in Europe.\n\nI am not convinced Yuval is right. I think he is making some wrong assumptions. Algorithms work according to the design of the system and decisions are based on rules. These rules try to enforce a very rational way of decision making. This is why the chess computer Deep Blue could win playing against world chess champion Gary Gasparov. And that is why the computer AlphaGo could even beat the best human player (Lee Sedol) in the most complex board game GO Professional. The algorithm is self-learning and we think it works like the human brain and that is why Yuval is making his point. These algorithms are already steps ahead of the famous cat recognizing algorithm Google is using in Google Photo. Artificial Intelligence is not new, the first neural network was built by Marvin Minsky, the father of Artificial Intelligence. He died on January 24, 2016 at the age of 88.\n\nAlgorithms are not working like human brains. The human brain is making decisions in a different way according to Daniel Kahneman in his book on thinking fast & slow. We have a system 1 and a system 2, where system 1 is our intuition and system 2 is our rational thinking. System 1 sends suggestions to system 2 continuously. And here is the point: System 1 is responsible for 95% of our decisions and System 2 for 5%! So, 95% of our thinking is subconscious. “Life is too complicated to carefully evaluate every element of every situation, so we learn to take shortcuts to help us make what are usually reasonable and reliable decisions.”\n\nReality is that Artificial Intelligence is still quite obtuse. I can bake my eggs and at the same time make a call and try to raise my kids. Most intelligent algorithms are idiot savants: they can do 1 thing very well, play chess or play GO. (this piece is inspired by article of Bard van de Weijer on Artificial Intelligence in Sir Edmund). We don’t know yet how to create algorithms that do 2 things at the same time or have different algorithms share knowledge. It is like you need to look into the cook book every time your loved one is asking you to bake an egg for her or him.\n\nAlgorithms today can only work based on big data. That is easy with photos of cats, but more difficult when data are more complex to access, like in healthcare. The biggest challenge for Artificial Intelligence is to become less thirsty for data, like humans do by using their intuition. We can calm down by Google’s Mustafa Suleyman’s conclusion that it will take decennia before Artificial Intelligence will think like humans do. Accordingly, it will take a while before Artificial Intelligence is making the decision to buy Microsoft Dynamics 365 business application software. Fortunately there is still work to do for the salesmen. And it will take a while before we all know the question which belongs to the answer: 42.\n\n42 is the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. In the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a group of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings demand to learn the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything from the supercomputer, Deep Thought, specially built for this purpose. It takes Deep Thought 7½ million years to compute and check the answer, which turns out to be 42. Deep Thought points out that the answer seems meaningless because the beings who instructed it never actually knew what the Question was. Sometimes Siri and Cortana sound like Deep Thought. Why the number 42? The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and Douglas Adams chose that one. “Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought ’42 will do’ I typed it out. End of story.”\n\nWell, Artificial Intelligence is not a joke and not the end of the story. If developments are going faster than we now think, there is still an interesting thing to do to boost some morals as a human being: we can always play a role in creating new versions of the living photographs of Arthur Mole and John Thomas.\n\nIn search of some eye-catching imagery to boost morale surrounding US involvement in WWI, the US military commissioned the English-born photographer Arthur Mole and his assistant John Thomas to make a series of extraordinary group portraits. Between 1915 and 1921, with the dutiful help of thousands of servicemen and staff from various US military camps, the duo produced around thirty of the highly patriotic images, which Mole labelled “living photographs”\n\nI am 47 now, passed 42, and I hope to have a long and healthy life to live to become at least 88. My grandfather said just before he passed away: “Don’t worry about me, they never have forgotten someone to takeaway.” If my kids would hear him say this now, I am sure they would ask him: “Do you know if there is Wi-Fi in heaven?” 42.\n\nWishing you a lot of artificial intelligence,\n\nKind regards,\n\nOn behalf of Dynamics Software\n\nEric Veldkamp\n\nThank you for reading our September 2017 newsletter.\n\nWelcome back! It feels like our last newsletter was published ages ago. In reality it was only 3 (very exciting) months back. July kicked off with the renewed and renamed edition of Microsoft Inspire in Washington D.C., previously known as the Worldwide Partner Conference. This rebranding reflects how Microsoft and its partner community is inspiring each other to “innovate and deliver powerful new solutions to customers.” Making and selling good software (on subscription basis) is considered being Microsoft’s primary business model, I wrote about Microsoft’s second core business in my November 2013 blog which is organizing events and making money with that. It’s third core business is rebranding everything.\n\nMicrosoft Inspire was very exciting for me, although for neutral folks it was a bit boring.\n\nFor me the highlights of this year’s Inspire were:\n\nThe announcement of the One Commercial Partner organization and the Co-sell investments (with the accompanying reorganization affecting not only the Microsoft Dynamics organization).\n\nThe ISV Cloud Embed Programme\n\nThe announcement of Microsoft 365, the new offering drawing the best across Office 365, Windows 10 and Enterprise Mobility and Security and Azure stack improvements.\n\nMicrosoft being the first global cloud services provider to offer contractual commitments to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\nThe message on stage as well as behind and between the lines of placing partners back at the center of the estimated $4.5 trillion digital transformation opportunity.\n\nThe 1 day fly. Huh?\n\nIn my April 2017 blog, I talked about interesting numbers like PI, e, n a, 1.62, γ, g and c. Inspire also gave some insight in Microsoft by the numbers:\n\nEvery $1 of Microsoft revenue brings a return of $9.01 for Microsoft partners. Looking at our current revenue, there is still room for growth\n\n95% of Microsoft’s commercial revenue comes from partners\n\n17 million people around the globe are employed by Microsoft’s partners ecosystem\n\nMicrosoft employees make up less than 1% of this number\n\n64,000 Microsoft partners leading cloud solutions: that is more cloud partners than Amazon Web Services, Google, and Salesforce combined.\n\nMicrosoft partners earn 19% higher margins than the partners of the next closest competitor.\n\n140 Countries represented at the conference\n\n6 Priority verticals that will continue to be focused on (Financial Services, Manufacturing, Retail, Education, Health, Government)\n\n4 Application areas to support this (The Modern workplace, Business Applications, Applications and Infrastructure, Data and AI)\n\n1 Commercial Partner\n\n1 day fly. Huh?\n\nIf you want more Microsoft by the numbers go look here:\n\nhttp://www.thewindowsclub.com/facts-figures-about-microsoft or:\n\nhttps://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-numbers-look-how-many-people-are-using-microsofts-products-and-services\n\nSatya Nadella’s keynote on Day 1 confirmed the direction to inspire and innovate and urged the partner community to take advantage of the opportunities that the new world presents. See his keynote where he talked about the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge:\n\nhttps://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-inspire-2017-opening-keynote-watch-it-here\n\nhttps://www.onmsft.com/news/check-out-this-video-highlighting-day-two-of-microsoft-inspire\n\nWhat was my favorite presentation?\n\nOf course I could not join them all and, besides some very interesting parallel sessions, I still prefer Brad Smith’s (Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer) keynote on Microsoft’s commitment to security and sustainability followed by an interview with Ian Bremmer, President and Founder of Eurasia Group, where Brad and Ian discuss recent geopolitical events and the role the technology sector can play in advancing solutions to some of the world’s biggest issues. Will Mark Zuckerberg become president of the United States? These events led to more and more organizations leading the way for driving change around the globe above countries. My colleague Kevin Davis felt these insights were insulting to some countries, but I really enjoyed his view very much. It is definitely worthwhile reviewing this interview:\n\nhttps://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/assets/2017/08/04/16/26/754561\n\nAnd did you notice it? Please have a look a couple of seconds starting at 18:44.\n\nDid you see the 1 day fly flying around? You probably thought it was flying around your personal device screen and you tried to wave it away, but the fly was flying in Washington D.C., It is funny to see that in this era of risk avoidance, such a very well organized event as Inspire with all the numbers as mentioned above, is little disturbed by a 1 day fly. A 1 day fly who decided to fly into the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and travel around the most important persons at that point in time in that building. What would the fly think?\n\nHaving a fly disturb an interesting interview is probably a risk the event organization did not think of and certainly did not anticipate on. And that is acceptable as it is a very small risk with visible, but limited consequences.\n\n1 day flies are also named mayflies. Mayflies (also known as Canadian soldiers, shadflies, fish flies or up-winged flies) are aquatic insects belonging to the order Ephemeroptera. This order is part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera. Over 3,000 species of mayflies are known worldwide, grouped into over 400 genera in 42 families (Yes, numbers again!). Mayflies “hatch” (emerge as adults) from spring to autumn, not necessarily in May, in enormous numbers. This one hatched on July 12, 2017, that exciting day in July.\n\nAugust was exciting for my family life enjoying the holidays. The news was headlined by the consequences of severe weather conditions in many, many countries, the fipronil food crisis and terror attacks in Europe as well as the nuclear tension with North Korea. Huge risk with potentially huge consequences.\n\nImplementing business applications like ERP or CRM have big impact on organizations and therefore good project management is trying to minimize and mitigate risks. Still in every project things occur which was not anticipated on, the 1 day fly visiting projects.\n\nWhy do we want to exclude risks? He or she, who is aware of taking all the risks, would never leave the door, ever do sports again, dare to eat, go online and best do nothing at all watching the plants grow at home. People are prepared to take the risks where they (think they) can control themselves, like driving without seat-belts secured, smoking or drinking alcohol. Smokers know it is bad for their health and traffic is causing casualties, but they think: “That won’t happen to me!”. People also try to protect their kids, animals and pets for the risks they run. Putting tennis balls on a goat’s horn for instance is a worldwide phenomena to avoid risks.\n\nIf you want to see more of these, please have a look at the images from around the world of image chaser Idan Hayosh. Very funny. Similar like the fly above: we could only guess what would the goat think? Who was the first person to put a tennis ball on the goats horns? This must have been a farmer or parents protecting the goat and/or the kid to get bumped by its horns. From my own experience I remember this bump can be very painful and my parents were not tennis players. To avoid the goat bump into kids as they walk around, it is now allowed to remove the horns of goats at children’s zoo’s and farms in the Netherlands. But I have been told that this is bringing other risks, like the goat losing its integrity or getting bone sarcoma and infections. What choices do we make?\n\nFor things we cannot control like radiation, chemicals and cyber-attacks we only accept zero risks. That is why we protest against power pylons in our back yard and why governments are placing road blocks at events and popular touristic places where there is much crowd. The tendency to prefer the complete elimination of a risk, even when alternative options produce a greater reduction in risk (overall), is called the zero risk bias.\n\nIn research by Jonathan Baron, Rajeev Gowda and Howard Kunreuther in 1993, they asked their audience to decide on managing hazardous waste: “What should be cleaned up and who should pay for it?”\n\nIn their experiment they presented 2 major cities (1 with 2 million residents and the other with 1 million residents) having garbage belts polluting the ground water. The bigger city waste mountain caused 8 cancer cases per year, the other 4. Both cities had limited budgets to clean the garbage belts and the people had 3 options to choose from:\n\nBoth garbage belts are cleaned partially reducing the number of cancer cases from 8 to 4 and from 4 to 2\n\nFull cleaning of the smaller city garbage belt and the larger one only partially reducing the cancer cases in the smaller town to zero and the larger from 8 to 7\n\nFull cleaning of the larger city garbage belt and the smaller one only partially reducing the cancer cases in the big city from 8 to 3 and in the smaller town from 4 to 3\n\nWhat option do you think most people choose?\n\nAlthough option 2 is reducing the number of cancer cases with 5 and option 1 and 3 with 6, 42% of the respondents chose option 2! Why did they chose for the zero risk? If risk is eliminated, you don’t have to worry and that is worth the costs. We often get muddled about the differences between quantities and proportionality – a rise of 100% in knife crime sounds terrible until you realize that this means it’s gone from one attack per year to two attacks. It also seems we prefer large decreases i"
