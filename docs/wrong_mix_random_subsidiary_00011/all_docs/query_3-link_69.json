        "text": "â€”Software testing is an essential phase of software development life cycle. Today many software applications are written as web based application that runs in an Internet Browser. The economic relevance of web based application increases the importance of controlling and improving its quality. The quality assurance of a system depends upon automation testing that decreases the test cost and increases work efficiency. In this paper we have discussed various web automation testing tools which will help us to understand the automation testing as well as the tools available for automation testing. A variety of web based systems and applications are tested by automation testing tools. The automation testing script is used in test automation. To choose the best tool for a task, various issues like ease of integration should be considered and weighed against the cost and performance. Also the tool needs to be compatible with the design and implementation of an application."
