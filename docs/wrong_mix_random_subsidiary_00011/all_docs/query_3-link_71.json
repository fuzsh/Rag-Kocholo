        "text": "^you for real?putting cartoon?? I think frustration kills?\n\n--\n\nPS:I read you are a \"image thief\" first .now you edited it?\n\nDo read this :why Linux users usually hate Windows?well put:\n\nThe Linux View\n\nMost linux users were windows users at one point, however they were driven into linux for many reasons. One was the challence, other was the mouth to mouth recomendation. Another was that it was require for a lesson in college, other was that they find out that linux doesnt cost any money and all the software on top is also without any cost.\n\nMore mature linux users learn that there were difference in this aspect and even thought it is true most people start having an understanding that this is something completly different. They start seeing this is more like a social computing experiment where there is a community and that usually you have to communicate with people in order to improve yourself, this is when they learn the community.\n\nWhen this Linux users look back into the windows world they found a cold, frivolous and intolerant world. They also see a lot of people with very limited view of what technology really is, they look more like droids that are guided by 1 company. That is when they start looking at this giant monolitic company and usually making smoke screen, cheats, and bullying to hold back from people realizing there is technology outside of their world.\n\nThis is when the hate really start, when they see people being unable to figure out the world outside of windows. When they see the constant issues that this OS present yet the users don't really seem to realize. They just think this is the way that the machine works.\n\nFrom then on is a constant frustration from the manufacturers not supporting anything else than windows, government making rulings based that there is only one OS. This sentiment is usually shared and start growing as more and more people get organized around the world and launch campaing against a monocultural digital world.\n\nThis is only an abstract of what I have seen as an ex-Windows power user running into Linux several years ago and completely moving to Linux and getting good every day now.\n\nWhy linux users hate windows - By Free Software Club\n\nI would also like to add about the intolerant nature of window$ users expecting all window$ world.\n\nthen ,micro$oft - steve ballmer is the enemy no.1 for Linux and Open Source.\n\n:\n\nMicro$oft FUDing about Linux, sueing companies shifting to Linux by claiming IP Patent FUD!Destroying every chance to Keep a balance in software world.people especially who swears by window$ technology -who ARE INTOLERANT to any changes in software eco-system where by current so called microsoft ecosystem(monopoly) will be destroyed..too much to share.but what is the point expecting from kiddos who plays cartoon and yawn fulltime on how window$ blow$.\n\nThose who want to educate themselves rather than sticking on micro$haft monopoly must search and read why Linux users HATE micro$oft and window$.there are REASONS for that.kiddos playing with games and proffessionals addicted to the garbage obsolete locked software development platform(.net) whines and HATES on Linux and FOSS.they are shocked to think about a world where programmers are not paid!well ,such dimwits must think about future rather than present.most of the so called window$ supporting softwares that you use and buy can be called as a \"racket\" which exploits the problems of this weak window$ operating system!\n\nget GNU/Linux!\n\nTHERE IS A REASON FOR THE HATE FOR WINDOW$ AND MICRO$HAFT!THINK ABOUT IT!\n\nWhy Do You fall for the FUD Spread by hardcore Window$ fanboy$ who spreads that Linux is just a command line shell!Eh?\n\nLook Here:\n\nprakashan said:\n\nthe thread has it's OP and the M$tards looks out for me!How rational!\n\nOh Yeah, then what are you, Linsuxian, Lintard, or maybe a Luxturd.\n\nprakashan said:\n\nand Who said I am on Linux marketing?estimating too much!Neither I google for news.you can have @ slashdot dude!\n\nLOL... Linux marketing...:rofl:\n\nprakashan said:\n\nIf you target me - first understand this to your tiny brains - You are frustrated and can't accept about Winblow$ the m$haft shit!Isn't that true?You can't stop justifying a shitty operating system so weak that it needs anti-virus,registry cleaners and hell other software \"rackets\" hovering around it to protect that shit which is put forward by Bill Gate$ ,the Demon.\n\nLOL... Its you who are too either too frustrated or naive enough to not understand that Linsux (oops Linux :tongue: ) is a 1000 years too early to compete with a Commercial OS like Windows. With all its flaws Windows still gets sold as well as pirated capturing 90% of the market while Linux with all the crap about its greatness does not have enough software nor is compatible with a 10th of the hardware that windows supports either inherently or through manufacturer supplied drivers and in overall got less than 1% of of the market. The only reason MS is reacting is to ensure that the market share stays that way.\n\nprakashan said:\n\nI really posted this ,because few of the guys like *Nikhil* does this Job great-see personal attacks on me-dude ,you can't understand that WE CAN LIVE WITHOUT DAMN SHITTY OPERATING SYSTEM CALLED WINDOW$_can't take this?eh?Why the heck should you target me?DO you think your justification of M$haft will help me anyway?NO ,first understand this kiddo-I am a ex-winblow$ user ,and YOU think- why I left that monopoly before targetting me !!,also Party Monger,Nemesis etc.Why don't you guys Try this anti-linux Officer job instead of warming up in this period of recession?\n\nOh Yeah. We really enjoy wasting away our Sunday's targeting Linsuxain's. I mean come on, every one has been really patient with you even when you have been calling every Window's user a M$tard or what not in not one but so many threads.\n\nprakashan said:\n\nthe problem ,I see is ,most of the window$ fellows can't grow upto that level to appreciate other operating systems.I am not turning ON or OFF to Linux.they are brought up in the window$ world ,where their bigoted mind cannot accept the change.World survives on Changes.Tomorrow when M$haft winblow$ was considered as a weak system and the millions of dumba33es who justified it making M$ the monopoly rule them will be written in the pages of history the same way unfortunate germans who followed nazi cult.\n\nOh Yeah !!!, I have used or tried out various flavors of Linux and probably from an earlier time than you did and I have used Unix before I ever started using windows and so let me tell you, even in its latest non-commercial iterations Linux is still little more than an experiment for software hobbyists. Only the commercial versions of Linux are worthy enough to be compared with any other commercial OS like Windows.\n\nprakashan said:\n\nagain ,Why Should I want to educate someone who wants to whine about Linux and underestimate it's power ?Let them rot with window$.who cares?\n\nshame on you mind locked M$ fanatics.\n\nPlease spare us the education for god's sake. When you yourself do not know or acknowledge the limitations or capabilities of either of the Operating Systems, you are not qualified enough to educate anyone else.\n\nIf you dislike windows for some reason, then post you own experience and let people know rather than posting random sh!t from the Internet and stating MS sucks or that Gates is the devil.\n\nEven I dis-like certain aspects of Mac OS X which I use on a daily basis, but those opinion's were formed through personal experience and its on that basis that I ever argue with a OS X supporter. At the same time, I still admire Apple for its brilliant marketing which no other company in the world can match. Even with iPhone, I wouldn't agree with anyone if they say its the perfect phone, but at the same time, I wouldn't agree with anyone who says its utter crap. For the record, I don't even hate Linux, my point is just that its utterly impractical in its non-commercial form, most of its current deficiencies are due to its non-commercial nature. So learn to give credit where its due even if its for windows.\n\nWhat you have been doing is like those poor souls who rally for politicians (for money or Liquor) without knowing or understanding the agenda of either the opposition or their own parties.\n\nNemesis said:\n\nOh Yeah !!!, I have used or tried out various flavors of Linux and probably from an earlier time than you did and I have used Unix before I ever started using windows and so let me tell you, even in its latest non-commercial iterations Linux is still little more than an experiment for software hobbyists. Only the commercial versions of Linux are worthy enough to be compared with any other commercial OS like Windows.\n\nFUDing!This post is ridiculous ,again I read twice to understand that you are playing a early bird claim here?eh?Oh come on Nemesis!I know you don't know much about GNU/Linux rather than \"posing \" as it is.\n\nThis Post can come Only from a Fellow Who hasn't Tried GNU/Linux Practically in as a Base System for Mission-critical APplications.I think you are rotting inside a window$ server room.isn't that true?\n\nBigots are Bigots - Look at most of you people's posts -Isn't all of them personal comments against me?Did you ever wondered why I am against micro$oft -there is a reason.Linux users ,most of them are ex-window$ users.They know better both.Especially the Ones who have shifted completely to Linux.\n\n--\n\n1) Micro$oft is against GNU/Linux and FOSS :\n\nMicro$oft and Steve Ballmer are Anti-Linux -in the sense that they uses software patent FUD which claims Linux infringes their so called patents.\n\nrecently ,frustrated m$haft sued Tomtom with regard to such a FUD plan:\n\nMicrosoft Sues TomTom Over Linux Patents, No Biggie | Epicenter from Wired.com\n\n2) Micro$oft is promoting Monopolistic practices and restricts users rights by implementing DRM in their Operating System -oh! EULA -care to read it wanna be window$ fanatics?This restricts user rights,privacy to a staggering lower limit.\n\n3)M$ feels GNU/Linux is a Big threat totheir window$ in coming years.they want to silence FOSS and Linux by many a methods for quiet a few years now.even ,their recent moves shows mac is not the target as per their R&D on market research.\n\n4)Bigot Window$ Lusers never ever care for the freedom matter by accepting every restrictions and locks m$ imposed over them.they are supporting a monopoly corporation by buying or pirating window$ OS.the so called window$ software eco-system is a \"racket\"(like in sex-racket ) who patches,fixes,again cracks their weak window$ OS and asks money for fixing this shitty OS.\n\n--\n\nMicrosoft's patent FUD | Open Source Initiative\n\nBehind the scenes in Microsoft's war against Linux | The Open Road - CNET News\n\nDateline of FUD on Linux by M$haft :\n\nLXer: A Brief History of Microsoft FUD\n\nIf GNU/Linux is such a small competitor ,why M$ wants to appoint a anti-linux chief?eh?\n\nThe Apparent Hate for GNU/Linux from windows users are a common phenomenon.the \"lack of education\" on Freedom ,Privacy,Human Rights all tend to make a windows user the jack ass.yeah ,by saying that atleast 90% of the computer population can be targetted.\n\nHeck , Linux is NOT idiot-friendly -until distros like Ubuntu came."
