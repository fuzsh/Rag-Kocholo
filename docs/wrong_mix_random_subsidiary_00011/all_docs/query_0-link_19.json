        "text": "It's interesting what you can find in leaked arbcom-l correspondence. I read here that, from what I understood, Risker said that all attemps to log into admin accounts are logged and that that information is accessible to developers. Is this accurate? Is it documented anywhere? — Waterfox ~talk~\n\nI'm not sure that making such information documented is a good idea, per WP:BEANS. Every single edit and action on Wikipedia is logged somewhere, though much of it is obscured for public view. That is, every single time anyone attempts to log in to any account, it is recorded. It's a simple thing to take such records and cull out the admin accounts. --Jayron32\n\nYes, failed logins for admin accounts are logged and these logs are (like all logs) available to the developers. This might not be documented, but it isn't a secret. MrBlueSky (talk)\n\nThat should be \"available to the system administrators\". Developers write software, the system administrators run/maintain the software and servers. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nJust like they don't tell us exactly what information checkusers have access to. (At least not anywhere I have ever seen) Monty845\n\nThe MediaWiki software is open source, so there is nothing stopping you from figuring that out (well, except maybe lack of technical skills). MrBlueSky (talk)\n\nAnd, do not misunderstand, the WP:OFFICE can do & see everything. This includes Jimbo. -DePiep (talk)\n\nTechnically all attempts to access all accounts are probably logged, as with all attempts to do anything on Wikipedia. Prodego talk\n\nIs there any way of looking through all the previous villlage pumps' archives pre 2007 without looking at the hundred of archived versions once at a time? What I am curious about is the start of the MOTD project which was proposed here and then the project started up 30 March 2005 by a now blocked user. Simply south...... digging mountains for 5 years\n\nI don't think there is. It would be possible to set it up back to August 2004, but it would take A LOT of manual work. עוד מישהו Od Mishehu\n\nI feel a script coming on. I shall add it to my to-do list (alas a fairly long one). - Jarry1250 [Weasel? Discuss.]\n\nUnless I am missing the point... can you not just search (i.e. run a search query) them for relevant keywords till it finds what you need? --Errant (chat!)\n\nAfraid not. The project should appear somewhere here but these list archived versions of the page histories only, not physical archives so-to-speak. Simply south...... digging mountains for 5 years\n\nLooks like Special:Export can't export that many revisions for a local search. I'm with Jarry1250...it's trivial (if you've got a command-line and some scripting-fu) to pull all of them and grep for certain strings. Give me some strings (the user's name, for example). However, there are only what, 20ish VPT archives from prior to your given date, by this time one probably could have right-clicked along the list to open a pile of tabs, then browsersearch for a key term? DMacks (talk)\n\nEven better, it's trivial to recompile the \"history\" style archives into the more modern style. The only problem is deciding on a numbering system. I suppose we should recompile into the new style but with an /old/ in the name. The entire history of News, for example, I have extracted and put at http://toolserver.org/~jarry/news.txt (.txt, 1.3MB). - Jarry1250 [Weasel? Discuss.]\n\nJust dropping by to check I'm not Doing Things Wrong(TM) before going to Bugzilla:\n\nThe prefix:X operator does not appear to work in API search. Compare:\n\nGUI - lots of results\n\nAPI - 0 results\n\nThe API documentation claims \"sectiontitle - Adds a parsed snippet of the matching section title\". In this search, shouldn't sectiontitle be \"Zola Enterprises spam on Wikipedia\" as opposed to the page title? Strangely, if I change srprop to sectionsnippet, which the API promises \"a parsed snippet of the matching section\", I get what I want (here I'd expect the actual contents of the section). The corresponding GUI search is [1].\n\nThanks in advance. MER-C\n\nDefinitely right on that last one. Reported and fixed in bugzilla:29746. Ill get back to you on that first issue. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nI thought I'd float this here first: the citation system could be improved on Wikipedia in one simple way - using the page numbering system from BibTeX.\n\nFrom the BibTeX article, here is an example citation:\n\n@Book{hicks2001, author=\"von Hicks, III, Michael\", title=\"Design of a Carbon Fiber Composite Grid Structure for the GLAST Spacecraft Using a Novel Manufacturing Technique\", publisher=\"Stanford Press\", year=2001, address=\"Palo Alto\", edition=\"1st,\", isbn=\"0-69-697269-4\" }\n\nNote: the first argument on the first line is the equivalent of the name attribute in the ref element in MediaWiki's citation system.\n\nNow, when you cite this book (hicks2001) in BibTeX, you can do it two ways:\n\n\\cite{hicks2001}\n\n\\cite[5]{hicks2001}\n\nThe latter cites page 5 of hicks2001. The footnote and bibliography (etc.) is updated to note this. So if you are citing in Harvard style, it says \"(Hicks, 2001, p.5)\" while if you are using footnote style, it'd have a footnote that said \"Hicks, 2001, p.5\".\n\nWe could have something like this for MediaWiki.\n\nOn first use.<ref name=\"hicks2001\">{{Cite book ... }}</ref> Then on second use.<ref name=\"hicks2001\" page=\"5\" />\n\nThe first footnote would be the citation as it now is, then the second footnote would simply be a transclusion of the first footnote with \", p. 5\" on the end. This could dramatically simplify citation of books and other offline sources. Obviously, there would have to be changes to the Cite module in MediaWiki and it'd have to be tested to ensure backwards compatibility, and the community would have to determine whether or not such an approach would be acceptable under the WP:REF guideline. Currently, one either ends up with repetition or one has to use the shortened footnotes style. Basically all this is doing is creating a technical way to have an improved version of the shortened footnotes style.\n\nAlternatively, one could bundle the 'short version' into an attribute, like this:\n\nOn first use.<ref name=\"hicks2001\" short=\"Hicks, 2001,\">{{Cite book ... }}</ref> Then on second use.<ref name=\"hicks2001\" page=\"5\" />\n\nObviously existing tools like ProveIt would need to be updated to support the new style. Any thoughts? —Tom Morris (talk)\n\nThe BibTeX citation is very similar to the current use of citation templates. What you are adding is the ability to include the page number per <ref> tag. See T15127 - Page number attribute for <ref> tags (2008-02-23). ---— Gadget850 (Ed)talk\n\nThe syntax is good, but I don't know about the proposed layout. The way it's usually done, all the page number citations go in one section and the expanded citations go in a General Sources section (e.g. Battle of Osan#References). That's a more appealing layout than putting all the footnotes into one section, I would think. —Designate (talk)\n\nAh, I didn't know about that bug. That's pretty much exactly what I'm proposing! —Tom Morris (talk)\n\nAs you can see, that request has been open for three years without a concrete example of where to put the page numbers. ---— Gadget850 (Ed)talk\n\nI had a suggestion for this .. let me dig. Rich Farmbrough, .\n\nChaco Culture National Historical Park is an example of pure shortened footnotes. Battle of Osan mixes long footnotes, shortened footnotes and explanatory notes. ---— Gadget850 (Ed)talk\n\nAnswer is an example of the use of Template:Harvnb (Harvard-style citations, no brackets) in conjunction with Template:Citation, which is in active use right now. harvnb does what you are also proposing. For example {{harvnb|Smith|2005|p=25}} renders as Smith 2005 p.25 There is a link under Smith 2005 to the full citation. --Ancheta Wis (talk)\n\nChaco Culture National Historical Park, like Answer, uses <ref>{{harvnb}}</ref>. There is an easier way: the {{sfn}} template produces output which is identical to {{harvnb}} in behaviour and appearance, but dispenses with the need for <ref>...</ref>; differing page numbers are given different ref numbers, but where a given author/year/page combination occurs more than once, they are automatically merged. See Reading Southern railway station which uses {{sfn}} to such an extent that although there are 59 inline references, the <ref>...</ref> tag doesn't occur at all. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nAt least on the secure server today, I've been continually getting 503 errors \"Service Temporarily Unavailable\", saying:\n\nThe server is temporarily unable to service your request due to maintenance downtime or capacity problems.

They told me to ask here. I'm here to report a possible bug.

I've tried all possible options such as purging the cache, clearing my browser etc. If I rename the image, it updates to the newer version but that's the only way. It'd be ridiculous if I had to rename every image I upload. Any help would be appreciated.

It is Wiener Library in G K Chesterton. I thought I ought to tell someone, but don't know`who. I've had a look through recent history, assuming it was just a time delay in correcting vandalism, but have not spotted any change to the link. The link in the mobile version was to the article Joseph Pearce, but later, when I rebooted the iPhone, all was well.\n\nI did get a reply to this from John of Reading, who ‘cancelled” the HelpMe, and suggested ‘we’ ‘move on’ – puzzling really, as ‘we’ have not paused. Maybe he thinks I imagined the misdirection. I did not, and am concerned that a link can be tampered with without leaving a trace. Please, John O'R, do not ‘cancel’ again, but leave it for someone to see who understands and shares my concern.John Wheater (talk)\n\nAnother user suggested I had clicked on a footnote and then another link, thinking I had just clicked on the Wiener link. Not so!John Wheater (talk)\n\nJust for the record, here's my reply. -- John of Reading (talk)\n\n(outdent) It would probably help if I tried to summarised the technical issue. The article G K Chesterton has a link to Wiener Library; five sections further down it has a link to Joseph Pearce. John Wheater reports that he clicked on the \"Library\" link and ended up at the \"Pearce\" article. The problem went away after a reboot. So:\n\nCan anyone think how the HTML code for the page could have been scrambled as it was transmitted or loaded, so that the link went to the wrong URL?\n\nOr, can anyone think how the iPhone software could have misjudged the position of the click on the \"Library\" link, so that it acted as if the \"Pearce\" link had been clicked?\n\n(John W, is this a fair summary?) -- John of Reading (talk)\n\nSomeone posted this at Talk:Barack Obama but I'm moving it here for a quicker response.

I have attempted to create categories for a new template, Template:WikiProject_South_Sudan, but I am lost. For example, Category:High-importance South Sudan articles is one of the many I had to set up to make the new template work. Obviously we add the category to the page we want in that category, but is there anything else I need to do to make it work? Is anyone willing to check my work (see my contribs) and ensure I didn't screw up somewhere? Mostly, I need help getting the template set up to allow quality rating and importance rating, which may take care of a lot of needed categories over time. CycloneGU (talk)\n\nI'm in the process of setting up some of the categories right now, and I've adjusted the template to allow quality and importance ratings. elektrikSHOOS (talk)\n\nI noticed the latter, that was an important thing to fix in there.

CycloneGU (talk)\n\nIn some articles the images are important enough to retain detail and exceed the thumbnail size, which can be quite ridiculously small. However, these absolute settings work against the user when their monitor resolution is high enough that they actually need fairly huge thumbnails, that are bigger than the absolute setting.\n\nIs there some way to specify that certain images should always be a certain percentage larger than the thumbnail default?\n\nOr that an image should at least be a certain size, unless the user's thumbnail setting is set to a higher size?\n\nDMahalko (talk)\n\nSee WP:PICTURE, MOS:IMAGES and examples at right. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nIs there some way to make images appear in a zoomed browser window with higher detail than what is seen by simply zooming the window and the browser stretching the images from the \"normal / 100%\" zoom size?\n\nNormally I use Firefox with the zoom being +5 over the normal setting (Ctrl-Plus 5 times, it doesn't show what percentage that is). It would be nice if I actually got higher detail images from Wikipedia, rather than FF just stretching the 100% size image.\n\nDMahalko (talk)\n\nThe zooming is done on your computer, Wikipedia has no knowledge of it, so there is no way to do it directly. Apparently, there is no reasonable way to do it using JavaScript either. The only way I can think of doing this would be a script in which you set the zoom level and it would download bigger images based on that. User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nThe only way to have more detailed images is to increase your thumb size in your preferences.

Appreciate someone's technical expertise here!! --Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nThe problem lies within {{non-free logo}} or one of its subtemplates, and isn't on the WP:TMFN page. There's something about the combination of a table, the {{imbox}} template and the numeric list (\"This tag is not sufficient on its own ...\") that is causing the table to be closed prematurely. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nOK, thanks, I'll put a request on the non-free logo template talk page. --Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nHow to convert a Wikipedia page into a facebook community page?117.195.65.163 (talk)\n\nI believe you need to include the title in your profile interests section.

Gary King (talk · scripts)\n\nFacebook has a topic on Community pages and profile connections on their Help Center. ---— Gadget850 (Ed)talk\n\n(od)The above page is of no help. Facebook has all of wikipedia, uploaded. It is amazing how deceptive these organisations have become, they beat around the bush. Well I think I have found the answer by trial and error. Spent many many hours. Correction I have only part of the answer. For example you want to put Vinoba Bhave, as a person whom you have been inspired by in your profile here is how one goes about...\n\nyou first type Vinoba Bhave in Facebook's search window\n\nAs you type you may get suggestions, select page that links to Wikipedia, ... see for Vinoba Bhave it was simple, as there was only one page, don't know what to do if there are numerous pages\n\nClick on the like tab of the Vinoba Bhave Wikipedia-Facebook page\n\nCheck your profile, Bhave Wikipedia-Facebook may already be there as an info box, perhaps not where you want it, delete the infobox where you don't want it and add it where you do.\n\nIf you think this is confusing, you are right, but if you follow instructions step by step it could work, which cannot be said for the instructions on the Facebook page linked above created by nerds who are deep fried in moolah. 117.195.89.45 (talk)\n\nDoesn't work with C.I.D. (TV series).Yogesh Khandke (talk)\n\nThis is an important technical issue, hope it is addressed by someone who knows how FAcebook works.Yogesh Khandke (talk)\n\nFor starters, Facebook federates Bing search results, that would explain step 1 and two in the instructions above, note that \"Facebook has all of wikipedia, uploaded\" - though they certainly could mirror most of wikipedia, if they chose - there's no evidence that is in place.Cander0000 (talk)\n\nSometime in the last day or so, it looks like something happened to the internal storage of some sort keys. I'll explain:\n\nWhen I look, for example, at this page of the Living People category, I currently see 4 articles. All 4 have DEFAULTSORT statements with sort keys that should place the articles on a different page in the category. The page should be blank, and it was yesterday (I'm a sorting gnome, and I check it most every day). None of the 4 articles show recent edits.\n\nWhatever happened doesn't appear to be affecting current edits. When I first looked at the category page, there were 6 articles listed; I edited 2, fixing the sort key on one article (Bruno César, a typical Iberian naming foulup) and on the other article (Bonnie Zacherle) leaving the sort key unchanged but making MOS edits. In both cases, the article subsequently was to be found on the right page of the category.\n\nThis problem is not unique to \"from=Zzz\", it's easily visible on some other pages in the category:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Living_people&from=Nzz\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Living_people&from=Pzz\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Living_people&from=Tzz\n\n(etc.)\n\nAt the moment, it looks like (extrapolated guess) about 1/10th of a percent of the articles in the Living people category are not showing up on the right page; affected articles are not just mis-sorted in that one category, but in all categories in which they appear. For example, Steven W. Taylor is in the wrong spot in this category page - http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:United_States_Marine_Corps_officers&pagefrom=T Studerby (talk)\n\nProbably left overs from the changed collation in the sort algorithm for categories that was deployed a month or so ago. A purge or null edit should resort them. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nWhile a null edit appears to fix them, and it's possibly related somehow to the category fix from a while ago, they weren't there yesterday. Really... I look at \"from=Zzz\" every day, and most of the \"Living People\" category pages with \"from\" for [A-Y]zz every week or two, looking for mis-sorted biographical articles (articles where the first or second letter has a diacritic, resulting in a mis-sort - after the 2nd letter, they're going to be close enough to where they should be in almost all categories that they'll be findable by the average user). In other words, something in the last 24 hours triggered the shift of the placement of these articles; if it's also related to the change, then it's a 2-factor issue. And it doesn't seem to be just biographical articles (though I don't know if these are older or of recent vintage):\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:American_films&pagefrom=Szz\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:American_films&pagefrom=Tzz\n\nI don't see this as a crisis if the back-end folk know what's going on and are reasonably sure it's not going to happen again; any edits will fix them, and frankly it's mostly gnomes of various stripes that care deeply about sorting anyway. While a mis-sorted list doesn't look good and I'm personally a bit frustrated, categories are just not looked at that much by the general public (IMHO), so 1/10th of 1% and declining isn't a crisis, if it's understood. So far, I don't think it is; I'll certainly speak up if it happens again, and I hope the back-end folk at list think about what might have triggered this change.Studerby (talk)\n\nI have investigates this issue and reported my findings at T31799, let's see what the developers have to say. User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nAs a user of the “Underline links: Always” setting, I noticed how when people get cute about link colors they usually do something like this:\n\n[[Foo|<span style=\"color:orange;\">Bar</span>]]\n\nBar\n\nand that this causes the underline color to remain blue (#002BB8) instead of matching the span color (see [4]). One solution for this would be to use the following in concert with the “Underline links: Always” setting:\n\na, a * { text-decoration:underline; }\n\nThis will allow elements inside the <a> tag to underline in the current text color. Ideally we would have some way to specify the properties of the <a> tag itself, but this will have to suffice. ―cobaltcigs\n\nCuriously, if the <span>...</span> specifies the background colour, it's browser dependent whether or not the underline is shown. Try hovering your mouse over the first 9 characters of my signature: Google Chrome, IE7 and Opera underline all, but Firefox and Safari don't underline the first 3, only the next 6. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThat has to do with line-height issues more than anything, whether the underline is inside or outside the area affected by the background. In my browser the light-gray rectangle does in fact cover up the blue underline. If I rewrite your sig as Redrose64 I see a red underline on top of a light-gray rectangle, on top of a blue underline (see difference). ―cobaltcigs\n\nThe \", a *\" is an uncommon construction, incidentally. If you have a specificity problem, you should use !important. - Jarry1250 [Weasel? Discuss.]\n\nMerely using a { text-decoration:underline !important; } makes no difference. It simply makes the blue underlining of the <a> tag more important. It does not underline the colored interior span (using the text-color of said span) which is the goal here. ―cobaltcigs\n\n.colorlink a {color:inherit;} + <span class=\"colorlink\">[[foo]]</span> should do the trick for both prefs. It won't work with external/extiw/new unless the specificity is increased (with !important for example), but IMHO that is probably the desired operation. --Splarka (rant)\n\nDerp. Actually, on further retrospection, you should just be able to do it inline: [[Foo|<span style=\"color:orange;text-decoration:inherit;\">Bar</span>]] -> Bar. --Splarka (rant)\n\nYay! --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI don't think people should be getting cute about link colours. It breaks look and feel, HCI and accessibility. Rich Farmbrough, .\n\nI know that. But if we are going to have them, they might as well not look like ass. I believe Splarka is implying that:\n\na * { text-decoration:inherit; }\n\napplied globally, would do the trick. It would be inherited as “underline” or “none” depending on one’s user-prefs setting for the outer <a> element. ―cobaltcigs\n\nIf I load up Category:All free media, the first 130 images are images that have a CSD notice on them, then I get 70 images as expected. If I then select \"next 200\" - I get a page with the same 130 images and the next lot of 70 images. Should there bee 200 images witha CSD, I doubt if I can see anything else. I've used 2 browsers, on 3 PCs and logged in and logged out - all do the same. Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nI was able to duplicate the issue with Fx 4.0 on Win 7x64 just by taking a look. That's just bizarre. --Izno (talk)\n\nOff to Bugzilla then? User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nWell that will be a first, but I'll give it a whirl. Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nhttps://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29787 Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nUpdate - time the CSD was added must have been a database problem, files were not saved properly - all needed a null edit to fix. Now OK. Ronhjones (Talk)\n\nI'm doing some research into collaborative software repositories. I have already processed the entire log from the MediaWiki SVN (~91,000 revisions), which has indicated to me there are about 500,000 unique file versions. I would like to obtain all these versions for analysis, and I have the script needed to do so. I doubt the network bandwidth required to run 'svn co -r [#] [url] > [file]' half-a-million times is, (a) something I want to wait on, and (b) is something developers want taxing their server. I was curious if someone might be able to run it on the server directly for me, and provide a pointer to the very large file that results? Thanks, West.andrew.g (talk)\n\nBest ask on the wiktech-l mailinglist or on the #wikmedia-tech or #mediawiki IRC freenode channels. There should be backups, so I guess it would be simplest to make a copy of one of those. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nYou could checkout the git mirror of the repository. That way, you get all the revisions in one go. User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nI am trying to find out if it is possible, though any automated mechanism, to have a template display with different or extra wording if it is placed on a page of a certain age. In particular, at this discussion one of the proposed ideas seems to be having language added to the CSD template to encourage greater caution if it is placed on a page that has existed for more than 6 months. I am trying to figure out if that could be done without having editors manually use a different template. Thanks for any help. ‡ MAHEWA ‡ • talk\n\nI don't think doing that using just templates would be possible. What is possible though, is to create a bot that checks the age of the page and modifies the page accordingly. User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nThat would only work if the CSD tag stayed a while. The ones that are a problem usually don't.--Doug.(talk • contribs)\n\nWhy do you think so? Bots are able to react quickly. User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nI recently became quite fond of the update to reflist, which allows full (named) references to be moved to the reflist template, with only the tiny ref notes remaining in the article; this vastly improves the readability of the editing mode (see this). But it takes time to move those refs, something that could be done manually. Is anybody aware of such a script/tool? --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| talk\n\nDelta has one that I know of, but it had some kinks last time I used it. --Izno (talk)\n\nThis is referring to list-defined references. See User:PleaseStand/References segregator for a conversion tool. ---— Gadget850 (Ed)talk\n\nHi, I'm trying to use the search feature to return a list of all articles that have a section with a particular title. (For example \"Give me any articles that have a section titled 'In popular culture'\"). Is there any way to do this currently? I asked at WP:Help desk, and was referred here. Thank you. ~ Mesoderm (talk)\n\nIts possible but it would be one heck of a query. Are you looking in a certain category or article list or are you talking the whole 3 million plus articles. --Kumioko (talk)\n\nI am talking about searching every article on Wikipedia. When I type \"Dogs\" into the search bar, I get all of the articles that have the word \"dog\" in them. When I type \"intitle:dog\" I get all articles with the word \"dog\" in the title. What I'm asking is if there is something akin to \"insectiontitle:dog\" that will return all articles that contain the word \"dog\" in a section title. An example of where this would be useful is dealing with the horrid \"In popular culture\" sections that are slopped all over the encyclopedia. The large majority, probably 98+% of the \"In popular culture\" sections on Wikipedia contain nothing but unreferenced trivia that doesn't belong in an encyclopedia article anyway. Even those articles that do warrant such a section generally do it very poorly (including irrelevant junk like \"In SOME_ANIME_SERIES episode 3, John mentions TOPIC_OF_ARTICLE while eating a cheeseburger with Jane\"). I'd like to be able to do \"insectiontitle:popular culture\" and go through these articles and clean this type of garbage up. Other people have expressed interest in this as well when I asked this at the help desk. Even if it doesn't already exist, it doesn't seem like it would be much more difficult to implement than the title search and I think it would be very useful.(Other examples that comes to mind is searching for sections called \"Criticism\" or \"Controversy\", which also almost always suck.) ~ Mesoderm (talk)\n\nWell, unfortunately appears that this functionality is not available at the moment. There is currently a feature request bug outstanding on Bugzilla that has been stagnant since September 2010. I have posted a link to this thread on the bug report, as well as providing an example of how it could be useful here on Wikipedia. I'm personally unable to implement this myself, so I'll have to wait until I hear back from the developers. If I hear anything within the next few days, I'll post updates here. ~ Mesoderm (talk)\n\nIn the meantime, you could do a database scan and get a match for ==+.*Foobar.*==+ or something like it. Headbomb {talk / contribs / physics / books}\n\nWikipedia (& other Wikimedia sites) have no CAPTCHA for anon edits that don't contain a url. It also does not use the Bad Behavior extension for MediaWiki, is a much greater spam target than other wikis, and yet isn't overwhelmed by nonsense bots. How does it manage this? Is it just that those edits are reverted and the IP blocked so quickly that we don't see them? That's the only explanation that I can think of, but don't the bots just change IP address for every edit? Seeing other wikis get hammered by nonsense bots, I'm really curious how the Wikimedia wikis escape.\n\nThis would be useful to know for other wikis I work with - thanks. --Chriswaterguy talk\n\nIt's very difficult for a bot to \"just change IP address for every edit\". Wikipedia is pretty aggressive about blocking TOR exit nodes and other proxies, which greatly limits attackers' capacity to change IP with an effective frequency. Anti-vandal bots like Cluebot catch much of the dumb stuff, and edit filters do more. But the real reason is one of population - en.wikipedia has a very large number of active users, and lots of people with anti-vandal tooks like Twinkle. The vandals and spammers, even those with bots, are outnumbered and outgunned. This isn't an innate property of all wikis (nor of all Wikimedia wikis); en.wikipedia's editor base grew organically as its size and readership grew; there's no reason to suppose that if someone sets up a wiki in general that it won't be overwhelmed. I regularly see someone who has set up MediaWiki on their host somewhere and breathily hopes that \"if you build it they will come\", that a Wikipedia-like community will magically condense there and make wonderful things - in practice they get pasted by spambots because they don't have an adequate userbase to police their wiki. -- Finlay McWalter ☻ Talk\n\nIf they desired, of course, they could use WP's IP blocking as a blacklist. They do have the features Chris mentions avaialbe though. (And note that we do require captchas for certain critical actions like account creation.) Rich Farmbrough, .\n\nIs there a MediaWiki plugin that makes doing that (mirroring another wiki's block list), for a minor wiki, practical? -- Finlay McWalter ☻ Talk\n\nI'd also like a way to mirror Wikimedia projects' blocking of proxies. Thanks for the answers. --Chriswaterguy talk\n\nOh, and to support Finlay's point, part of the reason some of the MediaWiki prokjects have been mothballed is inability to keep up with vandalism. Rich Farmbrough, .\n\nI agree with the point about making a wiki not being just a matter of setting up and waiting for people to come. I actually wrote Appropedia:How to make a successful new wiki - the main point being that it's hard, and that too many people have set up green wikis or whatever without properly looking at what others are doing.\n\nBut for those of us who are doing a serious job, including keeping spam under control, learning from how Wikimedia projects do things is extremely valuable. --Chriswaterguy talk\n\nBTW, all Wikimedia sites do use a CAPTCHA for anonymous edits that contain a URL; I just tested it myself. Graham87\n\nOn Appropedia we just changed from the simple MathCaptcha to reCAPTCHA, and I'm surprised to see it hasn't made a noticeable difference. Not sure if it's worth trying Fancycaptcha, but I'll suggest it.\n\nYou also want to install the spam blacklist extension, which imports Meta's spam blacklist and others if you want. MER-C\n\nWe've installed the Spam blacklist and it's fantastic - we've added some common patterns we see in the spam (e.g. .*\\.com\\/forum\\/index\\.php\\?topic=[a-z0-9]{50,} . It stops most but not all the spam - but doesn't stop registrations by spambots, so our UserList is getting filled up with spammers.\n\nBottom line - we're using CAPTCHA and the spam blacklist, and those are great but not enough. I'll look into the \"blocking TOR exit nodes and other proxies\" and WP:edit filters - if anyone has other specific suggestions, please share. --Chriswaterguy talk\n\nI don't think there's much you can do about subcontinent+China spam sweatshops. MER-C\n\nAgreed there's a certain amount of spam & vandalism we'll just have to roll back. But we want to follow best practice in reducing it.\n\nIn terms of the TOR nodes, we're trying mw:Extension:TorBlock, as used on Wikimedia sites. Is there something else that will help us with the \"other proxies\"? --Chriswaterguy talk\n\nYou can also fetch ProcseeBot's block log. It can be accessed in an easy-to-parse format using the mediawiki api. The code for the bot, however, is not available to the public, so you'll need to make your own implementation to regularly fetch new blocks and cache them locally. --slakr\\ talk /\n\nHow is this possible? See WP:ANI#Spam from Wikialpha. Thanks. Dougweller (talk)\n\nI'll take a stab at this. I think when not logged in, any user can still see the e-mail user function for users who accept e-mail. Thus, it's possible for an IP user to send an e-mail to someone. I do wonder why you can't be required to register first, but there's surely a reason IPs are allowed to do that. CycloneGU (talk)\n\nGood stab, but the e-mail user function is only available to accounts who can receive email in return. --jpgordon::==( o )\n\nSo they see the option but, when clicking it, are told they cannot use it? Hmm.\n\nIn that case, I'd be curious myself. It sounds like Dougweller was the recipient of the e-mail. We might need an e-mail header or something (not the actual address it came from or the e-mail itself, just the templating and such), but I'll let the technical experts address this. CycloneGU (talk)\n\nIndeed you need to have an account to have the minimum requirement (which means being in the \"User\" group) to be authorised/ability to use the EmailUser function. Bidgee (talk)\n\nAny registered user can access the email function if they have a valid email address. AFAIK email addresses can also be shared between accounts. I was previously sent email from WikiAlphaBot (talk · contribs), which has no edits and existed primarily to access the email function. It's likely here that the email is coming from a registered account but they aren't saying the account here. elektrikSHOOS (talk)\n\nI'm getting the emails after WikiAlphaRobot was blocked. I'm also getting more of the emails. User is VallorVir. Great, do a AfD and get spammed every time. Bgwhite (talk)\n\nWhile I was typing, Dougweller put a block on the account. So, spammer is now blocked. Bgwhite (talk)\n\nMy suspicion is that the user got confused between (1) a user without a user/talk page (i.e., redlinks) and (2) a user that does not exist. T. Canens (talk)\n\nI applied for SUL two years ago under my then-current WP name, TrackerTV. (I still have the rights to that username on en Wikipedia). However, when I renamed my enWP account to Raymie, the others were never able to follow suit.\n\nI'd like someone to help me rename my SUL to Raymie and check for conflicts so I can at least have the same name on, say, Commons. Raymie (t • c)\n\nI think what you need to do is ask for accounts to be renamed elsewhere (e.g., Commons) separately and then merge them into your SUL on Raymie. If the wiki does not have a local bureaucrat, you need to ask at meta. T. Canens (talk)\n\nI second asking for help on meta or on Commons. This is definitely not the place. Asking for help on every project can sometimes be a problem due to language but for the conflict check just go to: your global contributions and see if it shows the account as unified, accounts that exist but aren't unified generally belong to someone else and you'll have to see if they're willing to voluntarily give up their name or if it's possible to usurp. If the account belongs to you but isn't unified you just need to go to your preferences. If the account doesn't show up then you simply need to log in under this account on that project. You can post further questions on my user talk page or look me up on IRC if you have trouble.--Doug.(talk • contribs)\n\nActually since your Commons account has like 7 edits, if you don't mind losing them you can just go to Special:MergeAccount to create a new SUL account. T. Canens (talk)\n\nPlease, ask here for you old account on Commons to be renamed to the new name. And here the same for Wikiversity. Your accounts on other projects do not have edits, and you can forget about them. Ruslik_Zero\n\nHi- I recently requested changes to Template:Orphan, to put the \"subst\" line and the includeonly category within the Ambox template (as it shows to do at Template:Ambox.) The changes were made, however, now the /doc page for that template is transcluding twice, even though the code for it is only in there once. Is there a problem somewhere within the template, or is it within the Ambox template? Thanks, --Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nThat's really odd. When I copied the same code to my sandbox (incl. the doc), it showed only once. User<Svick>.Talk();\n\nYes, I'm wondering if the problems described at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (article message boxes)#Template loops are related? --Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nYes - \"name=Orphan\" was added, {{{name}}} is required by the check used for adding the documentation, so it's added in the {{Ambox}} template as well as in the {{Documentation}} template. Peter E. James (talk)\n\nOh, so the directions at Category:Pages with incorrectly substituted templates are incorrect, because they say to add the \"name\" parameter? --Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nThe code can be added directly or via the ambox template - the name parameter in ambox also adds the documentation. Other templates I've looked at have the code above the ambox, so I don't know if it's correct to say that the ambox option is preferred. Peter E. James (talk)\n\nYes, I've noticed that when the \"subst\" code is above the ambox, then there don't seem to be problems with the duplicate /doc pg. Maybe there should be a note about the problem in the usage instructions at the Ambox /doc page? --Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nThe duplicate documentation can be fixed by removing the {{Documentation}} at the end if \"name\" is in the ambox. The only problem I can see (which should be mentioned on the category page) is that the \"name\" can cause a template loop if the template is used in its documentation. Peter E. James (talk)\n\nPeter's got it. This is not an error but a feature that I added to {{ambox}} a while ago. I wanted a name parameter so that it could give an error message when incorrectly substituted. So I thought this would be another use for this parameter and simplify the template code a bit more. I must admit, the wisdom of this new feature was questionned by another editor at the discussion linked by Funandtrvl, and now I see that this has caused confusion, I would not be averse to removing the feature if people feel this is best. — Martin (MSGJ · talk)\n\nI don't see a problem with leaving the name parameter in the Ambox template, because it does serve a purpose; however, I think that the usage instructions on both Template:Ambox and Category:Pages with incorrectly subst. templates (and anywhere else that it's mentioned that I'm not aware of) need to be updated to let people know (like myself) not to use the name/subst fields within the template, along with the documentation template, or else there will be duplicate /doc pages. I seem to have found out the hard way, and it would serve a purpose to notify other editors ahead of time of the problem. If having the name parameter removed would really not cause any problems for tracking bad template substitutions, then it probably would be better to remove it. Since I'm definitely not a programmer, those out there who know what they're doing need to let us know whether the parameter should stay or not. Thanks, --Funandtrvl (talk) 20:40, 12 July 2011 (UTC)--Funandtrvl (talk)\n\nGreetings. I'm trying to customize my Wikilove extension, and I was wondering if there's something obvious I'm missing. I read mw:WikiLove and examined MediaWiki:WikiLove.js. Then I edited User:Quadell/common.js and purged my cache, but I'm not seeing any changes. What am I doing wrong? Is User:Quadell/common.js the wrong place for me to make these changes? Thanks for any help you might have. – Quadell (talk)\n\nPretty sure, contrary to the documentation, that the first line should have an equals sign rather than a colon. (Also, you may want to wrap it in some kind of conditional, otherwise you get JS errors on every special page.) Sorry for not getting back to you earlier, I was busy playing at being editor-in-chief. - Jarry1250 [Weasel? Discuss.]\n\nUnderstandable, that's a rather important job! Yes, changing the : to = worked, thanks! I'll let mw know. It's odd that the first two lines, which were functionally correct, were ignored; I guess if any part of common.js has a syntax error then the whole thing is thrown out without comment. Also, the icon doesn't show up on special pages, so that doesn't seem to be a problem. Thanks for your help! – Quadell (talk)\n\nYes, syntax errors in one script cause other scripts to fail. Yes, that's the problem: you'll get \"WikiLove.xxx not defined\" JS errors on special pages (minor, but niggly). - Jarry1250 [Weasel? Discuss.]\n\nIs there some problem with e-mail notification of changes to your talk page? It appears to have stopped sometime yesterday. Keith D (talk)\n\nI'd like to second this. I just got 18 emails notifying me of two changes to my talk page that happened days ago. And this is the second time in the last 24 hours that it's gone haywire. Magog the Ogre (talk)\n\nFrom the IRC channel: \"< Ryan_Lane> job queue had died. Tim restarted it yesterday\". So mails are not sent immediately, they are rather low priority compared to edits. So they are put on a job queue. This jobqueue is processed separately (I believe even on separate servers), sometimes it crashes and stuff piles up. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nThanks. Mails are starting to appear. Keith D (talk)\n\nA move was done at Joseph Smith, Jr. (moved to Joseph Smith) but something happened and the move was done twice, wiping out the article contents and making most of the history inaccessible.

Gwen Gale (talk)\n\nDidn't someone have a userscript to do this with the API ? —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nOccasionally, an article gets deleted before it is marked as patrolled. With the new system where a token is required to patrol something, it makes it impossible to mark these articles as patrolled, and as a result they litter the Special:NewPages list. Is there some modification that can be made to the patrolling mechanism which either allows us to mark deleted articles as patrolled or automatically marks deleted articles as patrolled? —SW— babble\n\nA page that was moved without creating a redirect can be patrolled by using the URL from Special:Newpages and changing the page name to the name of an existing page - it doesn't have to be the page's new name, changing it to \"Main Page\" opens the main page with \"Mark this page as patrolled\" in the corner (but the patrol log shows the original title as a red link). I don't know about deleted articles - I've never seen one in NewPages but maybe this would still work. Peter E. James (talk)\n\nThat's such a kludge I recommend someone file a bugzilla report on it LOL. --Elen of the Roads (talk)\n\nHere's one that'll still be on the Special:Newpages list for a few hours: Amanchi Venkata Subrahmanyam (AVS).

The SOA record in the AAAA response in unrelated to the query causing the response to be rejected. This causes problems for any dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) clients looking up en.wikipedia.org.\n\nWhat should have happened is that the CNAME record chain, visible in the A response, should be in the answer section of the AAAA response. This is basic RFC 1034 processing and should have been caught at the QA stage by the nameserver vendor and/or with acceptance testing by WikiMedia.\n\nRFC 1034, Section 4.3.2. Algorithm, Step 3a, paragraph 2.\n\nIf the data at the node is a CNAME, and QTYPE doesn't match CNAME, copy the CNAME RR into the answer section of the response, change QNAME to the canonical name in the CNAME RR, and go back to step 1.\n\nThe nameservers need to be replaced with ones that correctly implement the base DNS protocol. Failing that replace the \"en.wikipedia.org. 3600 IN CNAME text.wikimedia.org.\" record with a A record so that bug in the nameserver does not impact on the responses generated.\n\nBeing able to tell clients that a AAAA records do not exist is just as important as telling them that A records does exist.\n\nMark\n\n% dig +norec en.wikipedia.org aaaa @ns1.wikimedia.org ; <<>> DiG 9.6.0-APPLE-P2 <<>> +norec en.wikipedia.org aaaa @ns1.wikimedia.org ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 22781 ;; flags: qr aa; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;en.wikipedia.org.

This script lets you toggle between the Vector dropdown menu and tabs, eliminating the need to check/uncheck a setting or gadget each time. Simply clicking the arrow will switch between the menu and tabs. It works on all dropdown menu, even Twinkle, and remebers its setting per menu. Add the following to your vector.js:\n\nimportScript('User:Edokter/MenuTabsToggle.js');\n\nMake sure to disable the MenuToTabs gadget before using this script.

Revert me if I'm wrong, of course! —DoRD (talk)\n\nYou're absolutely right! — Edokter (talk) —\n\nIt does not work for the \"page and user\" menu gadget (User:Haza-w/Drop-down menus) which doesn't use a standard menu setup (and probably needs a rewrite to be more compatible with Vector).\n\nThe easy-block script (User:Animum/easyblock.js) I use also appears to be incompatible with your script. Its entire menu drops down at once and covers some other tabs.\n\nOtherwise, I like the idea and it seems to work well. —DoRD (talk)\n\nThe Toggle does not interfere with the \"page and user\" menu, which is good.\n\nEasyblock should use mw.util.addPortletLink for it's main menu item, then it should work. — Edokter (talk) —\n\nI need some help from a jQuery animation expert.

The total number of biographies in statistics may be also handy. Thoughts? --Brandmeister t\n\nThanks for asking. I have wanted: number of redirects (if possible), and number of redlinks (even if an estimate) as statistics to estimate the \"missing articles\". The number of biographies is a great idea, but the number of lists seems too nebulous, and perhaps the count of outlines (as \"Outline of France\"?) should just be a category count. In general, I like the idea of adding more statistics; the page is already so large that such additions will not \"overpower\" the page. Meanwhile, as an off-topic issue, I wish we had a parser variable for \"{{USERIMAGESIZE}}\" to get the current user's default image thumbnail size number (such as \"250\" for 250px), because we cannot autosize unframed images without \"thumb\" forcing the outer frame to appear. Anyway, using category counts:\n\n{{PAGESINCATEGORY:Living people}} → 1,094,917\n\n{{PAGESINCATEGORY:Outlines of countries}} → 263\n\nSo, it might be good to just link to a broader essay page titled \"WP:Counts of major categories\", which will show the major categories with counts of current articles, such as the total count of pages (above) in the BLP \"Category:Living people\". -Wikid77 (talk) 20:23, revised\n\nwe cannot autosize unframed images without \"thumb\" forcing the outer frame to appear - this is already available, just use \"frameless\" instead of \"thumb\".

Dendodge T\\C\n\nI'm too getting the \"Error reading from remote server\" message. From my experience, this happens because you're trying to open a big article at the secure servers, which I believe may be slower. I don't think there's anything you can do about it. If you change to the normal servers, it may work better. HeyMid (contribs)\n\nYes, that's what I usually do. It just struck me as unusual. However, I'm not sure the size of the page is anything to do with it (or at least not the only factor), since ‎List of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition monsters (which Special:LongPages states is the longest article on the wiki) loads just fine. Dendodge T\\C\n\nexplains the issue: pages with a lot of templates take longer to load because the templates need to be parsed. My belief is that there is a limit regarding the rendering time (at least on the secure servers), maybe to avoid server overload, and because the secure servers probably are slower, this causes a server timeout. If you go to the edit page of Great Britain, you'll see that this article has a lot of templates to load, whereas the longest article you link to doesn't have that many templates. HeyMid (contribs)\n\nIn the article Swietlan Kraczyna the interwiki links are for the category in which the article falls, not for the actual article itself. How were they generated?

Per discussion at User_talk:Dcoetzee#Image_size, I want to enable this bar for images on the English Wikipedia, including En pages showing images that are actually on Commons such as File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg. My primary motivation for this is that I upload some very large images, up to 100 MB, and it is not useful for most users to download the full-size image (and for some, prohibitively costly), so I wish to provide Download links for reduced-resolution thumbnails. Some of these images are uploaded locally for copyright reasons, such as File:František Kupka - Katedrála - Google Art Project.jpg. I would also like to figure out what it would take to get this working in Internet Explorer (I'm a coder and can help but have no idea what this feature is called or where it's implemented).

I wasn't able to find the setting to enable/disable it either. --Kateshortforbob talk\n\nYou are correct: the \"File/File history/File links/etc.\" bar appears to be the equivalent of a TOC for file pages. Curiously, I need to be both viewing the file on commons and using Vector skin for the \"Download/Use this file/Use this file/etc.\" bar to appear instead. Compare these four views of the same file: (i) en.wp, Monobook; (ii) en.wp, Vector; (iii) Commons, Monobook; (iv) Commons, Vector - the \"Download/Use this file\" thing only appears on the last one. I use Firefox under Windows XP, but these four links should allow comparison from any platform/browser combination. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nCorrect, it is only enabled on the default skin of MediaWiki Commons. Not on english wikipedia, and not on monobook. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nHave just noticed: when you go to a commons image under Vector skin, the page initially displays with the Monobook-style \"File/File history/etc.\" bar, and inside a second it changes to the \"Download/Use this file/etc.\" bar. I suspect that is related to one of the other things that annoyed me so much about Vector and made me go back to Monobook: clicking \"Edit\" shows the Monobook-style edit window with toolbar, and a split second later both change their format and position, as per #Turning off the \"helpful\" editing bar? below. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI've already ticked the \"Gadget: Appearances\" to get \"+\" instead of \"New Section\". But with the addition of the Wikilove heart (yes, I know I could choose to suppress it), at my preferred page width the \"View History\" is hidden on a dropdown menu. Is there an existing Gadget, or could someone write one, to reduce the width of various tabs: I'd prefer \"History\" or \"Hist\" for \"View History\", \"Talk\" for \"Discussion\" (I think that used to be the case?). Or lose the \"Read\" tab which seems redundant (yes, I know it's been discussed elsewhere, but to me it serves no useful purpose). Can anyone help, please? PamD (talk)\n\nI've just found a partial solution by ticking another gadget: \"Display the drop-down menus for page actions, such as 'Move', as tabs (Vector skin)\". That moves both \"Move\" and \"View History\" back into sight, at the cost of losing... \"Read\", which I don't need anyway. But if there's one more tab introduced (like Wikilove), this solution won't work at this page width unless I can get narrower tabs. PamD (talk)\n\nI'm currently working (99% finished actually) which lets you collapse each tab section seperately. It may not be exactly what you need, but in the future it may contain an option to shorten the tabs. See the MenuTabsToggle script on my user page. — Edokter (talk) —\n\nMight I suggest that you switch back to Monobook? The tabs are smaller, and there's more room for them too, because they don't get squeezed over by the search box (that being in the left margin). --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nIn preparation of a gadget (or other solution), here's a script to put in your vector.cssjs:\n\n/* Compact Vector tabs */ $(document).ready(function(){ $('a','#ca-addsection').text('Add'); $('a','#ca-history').text('History'); $('a','#ca-viewsource').text('Source'); });\n\n— Edokter (talk) —\n\nThanks for the various replies.\n\nEdokter's work-in-progress sounds useful - I await developments.\n\nRedrose64: helpful suggestion, but I think I'd rather stay with Vector as the default as it makes it easier to explain things to most other WP readers if we're using the same skin. (And I've got used to the search box in its new place, after some time!)\n\nI tried creating my vector.css with the code here, but it doesn't seem to have had any effect.

I think a small way to help is to change the \"View history\" tab to simply read \"History\"; this is just as clear and would IMO not hurt usability in any way. — Edokter (talk) —\n\nPeople who 'want to maximize real estate' are 0.2% of the users that do a lot of administrative work. They can use a Gadget to change this very easily. We shouldn't compromise on usability here. 'History' is a rather confusing term for most common reader, the original usability study showed. Reading and Editing are concepts they know, but 'history' is totally unfamiliar to many users as a concept, and people were afraid to 'change history' of the article for instance. 'view' invites people to click, because it is a 'readonly' action. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nI don't buy that. \"Article History\" might convey more meaning than \"History\", but the word \"View\" adds little if anything to the understanding. I'm with Edokter. -- — Preceding unsigned comment added by Tagishsimon (talk • contribs)\n\nAs I said above, I wasn't seeing \"View History\" displayed at all when using my preferred window width (desktop-proportioned window rather than the full width of my laptop). I think a short visible name is probably much more usable than a long name hidden in a dropdown menu. PamD (talk)\n\nI concur with Tagishsimon. A friend of mine asked me to “go to the view history”. He thought it was a noun: the history of the view. Clearly the term is very confusing. It should read “article history” or “previous versions” or “previous edits” or something similarly unambiguous. — Timwi (talk)\n\nI made a template for another media wiki project, which I have placed here to look at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MattGagnon/template\n\nBasically, all I really need is help with making this template hide the rows that do not have any information provided in them.

Help? — Preceding unsigned comment added by MattGagnon (talk • contribs)\n\nI suggest you use {{Infobox}}. –droll [chat]\n\nYou misunderstand, I'm basically asking for technical help on MAKING an infobox, and as I said this is for another media wiki project... however I have had this same need a number of times when making new templates on Wikipedia, so if anyone can help me, it will be a significant help to me in making infobox templates here, as well as there.\n\nI'm assuming this isn't a difficult solution. I'm willing to do the grunt work of editing my template, if I could at least get some more straight forward instructions on how to create conditional rows. What I found was slightly over my head, as I said. MattGagnon (talk)\n\nYou need to test if the parameter (office 2) has a value and only perform the output if it is set using -\n\n{{#if: {{{office 2|}}} | Action if set | Action if not set }}\n\nKeith D (talk)\n\nI'm pretty sure this is not because of the Job Queue, which does not seem overloaded. Yesterday at 17:24, I reassessed John Karlen to upgrade it from a Stub class to a Start class. It still says Start class on the Talk page. However, the main page is still showing as Stub class. I'm wondering why the upgraded rating does not show on the main page. In the past, it was a job queue issue, but can't be that now. Maile66 (talk)\n\nThe stub tag on the article page and the stub ratings on the talk page are independent of eachother. Someone removed the stub tag, though (after your post here). –xenotalk —Preceding undated comment added .\n\n(edit conflict) It's not the job queue, which is behaving at the moment. Article quality assessments in talk page banners are independent of stub templates on the article page. That said, a bot might set a talk-page class to stub because of the presence of a stub templates on the article page, but there is no reverse process.\n\nYou need to locate the stub template (it should be between the categories and the inter-language links), and remove it manually, . --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nGot it. Thanks. Maile66 (talk)\n\nSearching the English Wikipedia with google for \"foo\" <http://www.google.com/#q=site:en.wikipedia.org+foo> gives 15 200 results, but doing the same search on the secure site <http://www.google.com/#q=site:secure.wikimedia.org+foo> gives only 1 hit. I expected the latter to give many more since it would be for all the languages, and that I'd have to include a \"inurl:/en/\" like: <http://www.google.com/#q=site%3Asecure.wikimedia.org%20inurl%3A%2Fen%2F%20foo>.\n\nTurns out that <https://secure.wikimedia.org/robots.txt> requests no crawling. Anyone know why, and why there is still 1 hit (searching for anything seems to show only 1 hit). -- Jeandré, 2011-07-21t14:22z\n\nIs it to prevent articles coming up twice: once for en.wikip and once for secure.wikim? -- Jeandré, 2011-07-21t14:22z\n\nI for one appreciate that Google is not loading down the secure server. --Ancheta Wis (talk)\n\nThe pages visible through the secure server should mirror those seen through the normal servers. I don't see why you would need to search them separately. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nI only log into secure, but do searches using Google \"site:en.wikipedia.org %s\" because it's better than WP's own search engine (except for pages like deletion discussions not crawled, for which I have to use WP search). If I then want to edit the page found, I have to copy the page title and go to its secure version. -- Jeandré, 2011-07-21t15:13z, -- Jeandré, 2011-07-21t15:14z\n\nI see no reason we should ask search engines to index duplicate content. The secure server can handle less traffic and we shouldn't let search engines crawl it and direct their searchers there. Google respects https://secure.wikimedia.org/robots.txt and doesn't crawl it. The reason it appears at all in Google results must be that Google is indexing pages on other domains with links to secure.wikimedia.org. This is the situation where you would see \"These terms only appear in links pointing to this page\" on Google's cache of a page, but Google obviously doesn't cache pages they don't crawl. Another way to see Google didn't index the actual page is adding a search term which has always been on the page. For example, http://www.google.com/#q=site:secure.wikimedia.org+foo+origins gives no result although https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Foo_was_here has always contained \"Origins\". PrimeHunter (talk)\n\ni want to know what wikipedia is currently using for text search. I know it is based on mediawiki which has search built in, however ive read as well that wikipedia uses a lucene based search engine for English wikipedia.\n\nCan someone tell me exactly what wikipedia is currently (July 2011) using for search?\n\nthank you for your time. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 131.137.245.206 (talk)\n\nmw:Extension:MWSearch —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nHelp:Searching also provides some info on the features available. Killiondude (talk)\n\nI ran into a typosquatting website [6] (which I would not recommend necessarily going to) which seems to misrepresent itself as being affiliated with Wikipedia while directing them to click on a box which says they have won a prize. The cancel button does not work; you basically end up having to kill the browser. I would not be surprised if it installs malware too. I read the typosquatting article and looked around but could not find any way to let the wikimedia foundation know that yet another mole has popped up to whack. I did read the archived discussion here about similar sites, which didn't sound like anything actually happened then, but as noted here Wikimedia foundation has previously been successful in going after malicious typosquatters, so I would imagine if they knew about it they might actually do something. So how does one report these kinds of things to the right place? Rifter0x0000 (talk)\n\nI would suspect this is something for the legal people at Wikimedia Foundation, but don't know how to notify them. Have you tried asking at WP:AN? They're the next layer up from common or garden editors like you or me. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThe delete log (2006) for m:Squatted Wikimedia domains says its been moved to an internal wiki. Does anyone have more current information? — Dispenser\n\nYou could send an email or talk page note for Philippe or Mdennis, probably. At the very least they'd know who to forward it to. Killiondude (talk)\n\nAn editor asked a question at the help desk that no one has been able to answer - effectively how does one place images where they belong; it looks to me like the first image after an infobox is forced to start below the lower edge of the infobox. Can that be fixed? The question is here, the article is Economy of Canada--SPhilbrickT\n\nAnswered there. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nWhile attempting to create a new article I was blocked from linking to my only source for the information because its domain is blacklisted. The message that informs the user about the blacklisting should also list the reason(s) for the blacklisting. Otherwise it is like saying “No, you can’t add that, because we say so. Go away.” Not very nice. Please remove the domain from the blacklist or explain why it’s on the blacklist and why this link should not be added. Thanks! — Timwi (talk)\n\nSee WP:BLACKLIST for general information. The actual blacklist is at MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist and as you can see, it's quite lengthy and has no provision for explanations. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThat's not entirely true. The notice at the top of the page states all changes must be logged at MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist/log. One time I forgot to log a change I had made and someone else was kind enough to log it. I think people try to keep on top of the log. Killiondude (talk)\n\nBlacklisted four years ago after a report at Wikiproject Spam: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam&oldid=170439306#Long_term_Spamming_of_vbs.tv --Carnildo (talk)\n\n\"No provision for explanations\".

They look awful and are seriously stopping me from contributing at the moment; for the last week or so I've been over at Wiktionary instead. It was alright when they were only on a few pages, but putting them on all new articles is too far. I am using Firefox 5 if it helps. BigDom\n\nPreferences - Appearances - \"Don't show the Article feedback widget on pages\" looks as if it's what you want. PamD (talk)\n\nAh, that was simple! I looked at the preferences but didn't see that there, so thanks. They're still ghastly though. BigDom\n\nFYI: They are not shown in all new articles. See this section of the FAQ which explains the criteria used to determine which pages can be rated. Helder\n\nFair enough, they just seemed to be on every page I looked at or created so I assumed every article must have them. BigDom\n\nCould somebody well familiar with templates please create a BLP-prodded counterpart for Template:Prodded? Currently Template:Prodded is actively used by various deletion sorting lists to record both regular and BLP-prodded articles. However, a WP:BLPPROD tag has a 10 days expiration period, whereas a regular WP:PROD tag has a seven day expiration period, so it would be useful to have a separate template for listing BLP-prodded articles in deletion sorting lists. Thanks, Nsk92 (talk)\n\nI started the template for you at {{BLP prodded}}.\n\n— V = IR (Talk • Contribs)\n\nGreat, thanks! Nsk92 (talk)\n\nI've just noticed that there seems to be something wrong with the semi-protection. The Amy Winehouse article is semi-protected, but still some unregistered users are able to do edits. Check the history for 2011-07-23 and 2011-07-24.Thomas Blomberg (talk)\n\nLooks like there was some confusion about setting the protection in place, but it appears to be sorted now. I see no indication that protection isn't working, since the time that it was actually enacted.\n\n— V = IR (Talk • Contribs)\n\nThere have been no edits by unregistered users since it was semi-protected 16:39, 23 July 2011 (UTC): [7]. If you see unregistered edits on 2011-07-24 then you must have a different time zone (or you might be confusing redlinked user pages with unregistered users). PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nI have spent more than 10 minutes many times today waiting for a page (Watchlist, Ref Desk, this one) to download. Is there a problem bigger than just my ISP and/or computer?

Drewno (talk)\n\nI was wondering if anyone could help me get my head around\n\npreformatted text\n\nIt does what it's supposed to do, but the HTML tag doesn't normally change the text like that (from my understanding); this is something that occurs on MediaWiki software. Correct? So why does the font change and why is it boxed? Is it possible to modify the way it's displayed in any way? Swarm\n\nSome info on the PRE tag. The font is supposed to change, but the box is indeed added by MediaWiki. You can modify it however you like for yourself by modifying Special:MyPage/skin.css and adding CSS rules for the PRE tag. Gary King (talk · scripts)\n\nI use the {{pre}} template as it wraps text making it more readable. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Gadget850 (talk • contribs)\n\nFirebug tells me that the reason the box is added is the following piece of CSS:\n\npre{ background-color:#F9F9F9; border:1pxdashed#2F6FAB; color:black; line-height:1.1em; padding:1em; } pre,code,tt,kbd,samp{ font-family:monospace,\"Courier New\"; }\n\nAs Gary said, you can modify the appearance of the box by adding to your personal CSS. For example, pre { border: none; } will remove the border. Ucucha\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI just wanted to give people the heads-up that we'll be rolling out an experimental feature aimed at collecting feedback on the editing experience of new editors. Currently called MoodBar (it's not a great name -- if anyone has anything better, please let us know), the feature will appear as a small link in the upper left hand corner for new editors that have tried to make an edit. Technically, this means users that have registered for an account after the launch date of the feature who have also clicked on an edit link (regardless of whether they've successfully completed the edit). We hope to get quick feedback from users on their early editing experience, ranging from reactions to the editor/wikitext, interactions with the community, feelings of success/frustration, etc. This feature is part of the set of New Editor Engagement projects.\n\nWe don't know whether this feature is going to provide meaningful feedback. We certainly hope it does, but I'm expecting a fair amount of noise as well (I'm sure there will be plenty of \"Wikipedia Rocks!\", which is nice, but not that helpful). For starters, we'll be publishing anonymized CSVs containing the data. If the feedback proves meaningful, we'll develop a dashboard to make viewing feedback easier.\n\nWe're going to be pushing to prototype soon, so please feel free to test the feature. To test the feature, create a new account, click on any edit link, and the invitation should appear. I'll put date this post once the feature is up on prototype.\n\nIf all goes well with prototype testing, we'll be rolling out this feature early next week.\n\nDisambiguation note: Article Feedback Tool = feedback from readers on article content. MoodBar = feedback from new editors on their early editing experience.\n\nFeedback on the feedback tool? Please post on the feature discussion page. Howief (talk)\n\nHowief, thanks for notifying us about this. I have posted a pointer to this discussion on WP:AN. Seeing this extension made me sad because:\n\nWikipedia is not Twitter.\n\nIf the feedback given has a very low signal to noise ratio, will the extension be pulled?\n\nOtherwise, what are the means for dealing with abusive comments, excessive personal information and other unwarranted crap? Will this result in an increase in administrative workload?\n\nWill there be a new prompt every time the edit button is clicked, even if the extension is dismissed? Is the extension hard disablable via preferences or turns off when the editor (say) becomes autoconfirmed?\n\nI appreciate the motivation behind this but I prefer something that is obviously separate from the encyclopedia. MER-C\n\nAs a bit more background, this extension was inspired by the Firefox Feedback Program. Mozilla has learned that by asking users to provide small, quick bits of categorized feedback, they can use data mining to surface trends in the data, in spite of the noise. See e.g. Aakash Desai's original presentation and update for more info about it.\n\nThe current implementation is a quick & dirty hack to just see what the s/n ratio is like and what kinds of feedback we can expect. If it's useless, we'll ditch it pretty quickly, which is why we're not making a fuss about this early deployment. As for crap, FF has implemented a few crap filters (as well as e.g. phone number pattern detection), which we'll also need to do if we get more serious about it. But having a certain level of noise in the data would be acceptable for the purpose this serves, and the data would never be encountered by anyone not looking for it, just like you've probably never heard of the FF feedback data.\n\nThe current implementation is dismissable with a single click, after which it disappears, but the hide code just uses a cookie, so it's imperfect. If all goes to plan, it'll only show up for new users.--Eloquence*\n\nI think this is an excellent idea that, better than the article feedback tool, actually focuses on a point where significant difficulty is likely to arise, asks the right question and aims to give us meaningful feedback on that aspect of the editing process. I'll be interesting to see how it works out. Wikipedia is not Twitter; I can't help feeling this misses the point of the tool entirely :S --Errant (chat!)\n\n\"new editors that have tried to make an edit.\" - hit edit and escaped without saving? On first edit? After first edit? Bulwersator (talk)\n\nJust to clarify, at least for our first experiments, feedback is not currently going to be immediately viewable by anybody outside the Foundation. This means that there won't be any need for administrative work, and it's definitely not \"Wikipedia twitter\" (do we seriously have a \"Wikipedia is not Twitter\" page?) — it's just about letting us at the Foundation know how new users experience Wikipedia. If we find that the feedback is actually useful and has a good S/N ratio, then (according to my understanding of the plan) we MIGHT start thinking about surfacing this information to the community. — Andrew Garrett • talk\n\nYes, we seriously have a \"Wikipedia is not Twitter\" page/shortcut - it links to a content policy page and is part of Wikipedia's Five Pillars. Jezebel'sPonyobons mots\n\nActually, we do intend to surface the feedback to the community. It will just be done via CSV file instead of a dashboard. We didn't want to over-build this feature since we don't know whether the feedback will be useful. We wanted to get a feel for the quality of the data first before building out the feature.\n\nTo answer Bulwersator's question -- the invitation is activated upon clicking edit. A user who clicks on the edit but doesn't successfully submit the edit will still get the invitation. We'd like to collect feedback from anyone who's attempted to make a contribution, successful or not.\n\nThere's still an issue with the feature on prototype, so I'll let everyone know when there's something up that people can check out. Howief (talk)\n\nThe feature is up on prototype now. There are still a few kinks we're ironing out, but feel free to play around with the feature:\n\nGo to http://prototype.wikimedia.org/release-en/Main_Page\n\nCreate an account. Check \"Remember me (up to 30 days)\". There is a bug on prototype that requires checking this box to stay logged in. Note: Existing accounts on prototype will not work since the feature is only enabled for new users (i.e., users who create an account after deployment of feature.\n\nGo to a random article.\n\nClick Edit.\n\nYou should see the Moodbar invitation in"
