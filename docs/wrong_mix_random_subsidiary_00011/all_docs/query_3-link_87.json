        "text": "I love the change of the seasons. This morning when I went out for a walk along the paths in the wood at the back of my house it smelt of Autumn. I’ve tried to think of ways of describing what I mean by that but the only way I can do it is to describe the pictures that are created in my head. I’m sure that Sue would be able to give it a description that would be suitable for any perfume, but I’m a man and we can’t even get our heads around the different types of colour (what is mauve anyway) so smells are a little out of my league.\n\nSo here are my pictures.\n\nThe smell of autumn makes me think of walking around Tarn Howes, taking in the infinite multitude of brown and gold. It makes me think of walking through small mountains of paper crisp leaves, kicking them into the air and watching them float their individual paths to the ground. I can see those same leaves swirling around, like thousands of tiny kites abandoned to the wind. I can hear the first crunch of frost under my feet. I can sense my face tightening in the glare of a cold crisp autumn sun, making me feel alive in a way that the warm sun never does. I can feel the smooth dark chocolate brown of a conker fresh out of its skin. I can see those deep red berries. I can taste those brambles and those apples warm, tangy and sugary hiding beneath a wonderful nutty crumble and covered in custard. I can see that deer revealed now that his cloak of vegetation has been removed. I can see the thousands of starlings swarming in a mass of black ready for departure to a warmer environment.\n\nI don’t think I have a favourite season, I love the transitions between them.\n\nThere is a time for everything, a season for every activity under heaven.\n\nA time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest.\n\nA time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to rebuild.\n\nA time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance.\n\nA time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to turn away.\n\nA time to search and a time to lose. A time to keep and a time to throw away.\n\nA time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak up.\n\nA time to love and a time to hate. A time for war and a time for peace.\n\nEcclesiastes 3\n\nThis is purely a personal perception which I have not had chance to investigate too much but it’s a view that may resonate with others.\n\nI work for an organisation that has not yet embraced blogs internally, but does do quite a lot with newsletters. I rarely read these newsletters, and I know that others are similar. I take in far more information through blogs that I ever do through newsletters. So why is that?\n\nSome of it, I am sure, is related to to a lack of concentration of my behalf. I have become the ultimate skim reader. If the title or the context don’t make we want to read – I won’t. Skim reading newsletters is not easy. They are normally created in a form that assumes that they will be printed off, this doesn’t facilitate skim reading. I tend to skim read because most of the time I don’t need to know a piece of information, it’s more important for me to know it exists and that I can get hold of it quickly. That’s where blogs have a huge advantage. In my reader I can see that thousands of bits of information exist, when I need them I can go and get them. I know that the information exists because I have skim read through. If something new and pertinent comes up I’ll read it there and then but normally I’m in skimming mode. Why should I waste my time reading something in detail?\n\nAnother reason is similar to this one, but subtly different. An individual blogs tend to deal (if they are done right) with a single subject. Newsletters tend to deal with a multitude of things. Finding the quality in all of the words is very difficult (and boring).\n\nThe final reason (for me) is that there is a sense of control with blogs which corporate newsletters don’t have. I have configured my reader to go and get information from this particular source, I am in control. Compare that to my normal attitude to newsletters – “oh no, what have communications set me now”. The ownership is completely different. Yes I know these communications people are trying to do me a favour, but it doesn’t feel like it.\n\nSo give me a feed any day, don’t bother sending me a newsletter, and definitely don’t give me another repository to look in.\n\nA while back (probably years now) Steve introduced me to the concept of ‘service entropy’. By this he was referring to this definition of entropy: ‘The tendency for all matter and energy in the universe to evolve toward a state of inert uniformity’. Both Steve and I are from an engineering background where entropy is evident in real things. Steve’s theory was that IT services operate the same way and drive down towards the ‘lowest common denominator’. If you heat something up, it doesn’t matter how hot, it will always cool down to the level of everything around it, unless you keep heating it. If we view an IT project as a heating process and the resulting service or application as the thing being heated up, what happens after the project has finished is the entropy process.\n\nAs I have pondered this and how it impacts IT infrastructures I have seen it at work all over the place. As with the heating process, it starts before the project has even finished. As soon as the project is exposed to the outside world it is already giving off heat. As soon as a project starts to be exposed to the cold light of day the ‘heat’ is leaving it. I’m using ‘heat’ here as a metaphor for the changes that the project is seeking to make in the environment in which it is being delivered.\n\nAs an architect who has a vision for a certain amount of ‘heat’ (change) to be produced by a project it is a huge challenge to consider how you can insulate the results of the project from entropy. Because entropy dissipates the energy within the ‘closed system’ the larger the ‘closed system’ the more energy you have to put in. In the context of an IT ‘closed system’ the extent of the change (heat) may be the whole organisation or may be a smaller group. In a ‘heat’ system it’s the insulation that makes it ‘closed’, for an IT system it’s probably the organisational construct that replaces the insulation and is the thing that keeps the ‘heat’ in (you have to remember though, that there is no perfect insulation)\n\nEntropy explains why it is easier to impact a small organisation in a big way and to make a permanent change. Entropy explains why it is very difficult to make a small change in a large organisation and to make it stick. Entropy also explains why a large change in a large organisation is practically impossible without massive amounts of ‘heat’. I tend to be involved in making medium sized changes in large companies where organisations presume that because the change is ‘not huge’ that it should be easy. Most of the time these projects result in deploying technology and some process change, but never make the productivity increases that were expected. At this point it is generally the technology that is blamed rather than the lack of ‘heat’. It’s not normally the technology itself that generates the ‘heat’ though, it’s more to do with the way that the technology generates change and community.\n\nThe other thing with large systems is that it is impossible to apply the ‘heat’ uniformly. Some people will get direct ‘heat’ from the project, others will get it transmitted to them from another. Some people are conductors and some people are insulators. In some ways this lack of uniformity is worse than having a small amount of ‘heat’ everywhere. The reason for this is that when ‘hot’ meets ‘cold’ you generally get a reaction that cools down the ‘hot’ as much as it warms the ‘cold’. Take the example of calendaring and scheduling functions. These functions have been available for years (decades even) in corporate email services. Some organisation have managed to make a transition to making them uniform, but many organisations have not. As soon as there is any doubt (cold) about whether someone uses their calendar the value of all calendars is reduced.\n\nThere is a great danger in taking this metaphor to far, but I just want to take it one step further. You can undertake the heating process in one of two ways. You can either heat a small area to a very high temperature and hope that it will reach the edges of the system; or you can heat everything in a uniform way to the same temperature. The Internet has shown us that for large systems heating up a small area to a very high temperature works better than trying to heat up the whole. Take the example of Google Earth, this is a very ‘hot’ piece of technology and has generated a huge community. A few connected with that ‘heat’ and bit by bit the ‘heat’ is distributed. The trick is to keep the ‘heat’ going at the centre, which is what they have just done with the integration of National Geographic data. As a system becomes older it is more difficult to keep the heat going at the centre, and that is the challenge for Microsoft with Office 12 and Vista.\n\nSo how as architects do we resolve the entropy problem. For starters we spend as much time and attention on the insulation surrounding our heat source as we do on the heat source itself. In other words we try to understand where the heat will be taken out of the project and insulate the project from it. The other thing we do it to try and generate as much heat as possible knowing that some it will be dissipated.\n\nWhat is it that creates a drive in people to always be looking out for what’s new.\n\nI recently let on to Jonathan (my son) that I had access to the Windows Vista Beta code. This was followed by a couple of requests from his friends to get them access. I declined, but it did get me thinking. What is it about people that keeps them pushing for the new. Is it something that you grow out of? Do you go into reverse at some point and start pushing for something old?\n\nMy drive to see something new is certainly less than it is for these teenagers. Perhaps I’m just getting to the point where I feel that there is nothing really new. A new version of Windows and a new version of Office; both of these things will make a difference to the way that millions of people will work (even if they don’t use it). But will it make a real significant change to the way people live their lives. We’ll still be typing for the most part, even though voice recognition software has been available for years. We’ll still be using devices on a desk, whether they are laptops or desktop. Other device types won’t really make a significant difference to us, they’ll still be on the periphery of most of our lives. Let’s face it, the iPod and other MP3 players haven’t really changed the way we live our lives, all they have done is made it more convenient, it’s still personal music coming through those headphones.\n\nBoy, I sound like an old man – “there’s nothing new under the sun”.\n\nPerhaps I’m suffering from a bit of a mid-life crisis – perhaps IT is suffering from a bit of a mid-life crisis. IT has certainly moved out of the pioneering phase into more of the mainstream, but you certainly can’t regard it as a utility or even ubiquitous.\n\n(I hope no-one thinks I am writing these items in order of their priority in my life because it would give you a really false view of the things that I regard as import. I write them when I feel the muse coming to write about a particular topic.)\n\n“What is the purpose of my life?” It’s a really important question. It doesn’t always manifest itself in those exact words, but the root issue is the same. It’s a question that people ask at different times of their life. I was 17 when I first asked the question but for most people they seem to reach the question when they are in their 30’s. It creep up on people and no-one tells them that they are going to face it sooner or later. Even if someone did tell you that it was coming, I am not sure that anyone would face the question before it arrived.\n\nWhen we are young we can barely see beyond the next big event in our lives. Even if that big event is only the next weekend, or the activity we are going to do that evening.\n\nAs we move into teenage life our time-frame broadens a bit, but not that far. We might be able to think as far as passing a qualification, but the thought of anything as grand as marriage and children is well beyond most teenagers. Most teenagers I know are looking as far as passing their driving test.\n\nMost people go through radical changes in their twenties; they may get married; they may get a qualification; they may have children; they may get a job; they may buy a house. All of this activity leaves little time to think about the purpose of life, that’s for old people.\n\nThrough all of this a few realise that there is more to life; they seek a purpose and some even find it.\n\nIt is not until people reach their thirties that many of them start asking the question ‘why?’. Why did I bother? Why did that happen? Why didn’t that happen? Many people don’t even reach the question in their thirties but certainly many of the people I know do.\n\nIn the Bible there was someone who decided that they would try every part of life in order to find it’s meaning. He came to this conclusion:\n\n“I was a wise teacher with much understanding, and I collected a number of proverbs that I had carefully studied. Then I tried to explain these things in the best and most accurate way. Words of wisdom are like the stick a farmer uses to make animals move. These sayings come from God, our only shepherd, and they are like nails that fasten things together. My child, I warn you to stay away from any teachings except these. There is no end to books, and too much study will wear you out.\n\nEverything you were taught can be put into a few words:\n\nRespect and obey God! This is what life is all about.\n\nGod will judge everything we do, even what is done in secret, whether good or bad. “\n\nI regarded it as a blessing is that I found the purpose of my life when I was 17. I did quite a bit of living before that point and I came to a place where I knew that none of the living was worth anything. It was at that time that I had a personal encounter with God. I don’t have the words to explain how that felt or even the mechanics of what happened; I just know that I met with God. From that point on I have known that the purpose of my life is to be an apprentice of God; to ‘respect and obey’ Him. The rest of my life has been framed within that single purpose.\n\nThe reason I write this blog is framed within that purpose.\n\nThe way that I am a father and husband is framed within that purpose.\n\nThe type of employee that I am is framed within that purpose.\n\nMy leisure time is framed within that purpose.\n\nThis purpose is the ultimate purpose upon which all other worthwhile purposes are built. I’m not talking here about a cause to champion or an aim to fulfill, I’m talking about a relationship between me and God.\n\nOrganisations and governments spend millions and millions of pounds every year on advertising and marketing. Trying to communicate to people their message. Over the last few days here in the UK we have seen an example of the futility of all of this compared to the power of word-of-mouth.\n\nA bunch of activists threaten fuel protests. The government and industry says – “you will not have any problems getting fuel during the fuel protests that are going to occur over the next few days”. That’s alight then, we can all sit comfortably and just get on with our lives – apparently not.\n\nI’ve sat back and watched it all happen, but apparently we have filled our cars with a weeks worth of fuel on just 24 hours. The herding instinct has well and truly kicked in. I’m not sure quite what the mechanics were but I imagine it was something like this:\n\nSome people didn’t believe the government so went to full up there car.\n\nThey then told others what they had done and why.\n\nAll of the others they told thought “well there can’t be any smoke without fire, there must be something in this” and joined the queue.\n\nOther see the queue and think the same.\n\nBefore you know it everyone is sat on a garage fore-court filling up.\n\nThe government and industry experts give endless interviews on radio and television to say that it will all be OK but to no avail.\n\nA short-term fuel shortage is created.\n\nI am absolutely convinced that most of these people won’t use up all of the fuel they have bought for another week at least. I’m also convinced that most of these people will also be very embarrassed that they bothered. Of course I could be embarrassed when I’m shown to be wrong; but I don’t think so.\n\nIt would probably do our environment some good if we all stopped using our vehicles for a few days anyway. It would do some waistline a lot of good to actually do some walking.\n\nI work in customer environments when one of our most difficult issues is communicating with people. This story just goes to show that people will listen to whatever they choose to listen to; it doesn’t matter how much money you spend.\n\nEngland & Wales win the Ashes and the country goes wild; but in a very British way.\n\nI go out to play tennis and win a game on my very flaky serve and I am ecstatic.\n\nI am so privileged to be able to participate in sports as a leisure activity. There are so many people in this world of ours who have got far more basic things to think about, like where to find clean water. Being in the very privileged position of having enough I can choose how I use my leisure time, and one of the things that I love to do is to play sport.\n\nI’m not one of these sport junkies who has to get their fix of whatever sport is on. I enjoy my sport, but it’s not really a huge part of my life. One of the main reasons it’s not that dominant is because I’m not actually very good at it. There are four of us who try to play tennis every week, and have done for years. I am easily the weakest of the players, but that doesn’t stop me enjoying it. On a purely rational level I’m not sure why.\n\nPlaying sport is part of exploring the fullness of life. As well helping me physically it also exercises the mind and the spirit.\n\nWhy does a ball travel like that when I hit it like this; and why when I try it like this does it not do that?\n\nWhy does my serve go so much better when I’m not thinking about it. I sometimes sing a song in my head to stop me thinking too much?\n\nWhy do I feel refreshed from an our on a tennis court when 30 mins in a gym tires me out?\n\nI suppose it’s about self-discovery."
