In this paper, I will analyze and discuss at the work of an American artist called Frank Lloyd Wright. Lloyd was an architect and was born in the year 1867 and made his great contribution in developing the organic and distinctly American architectural style (Wright, 2010). Frank Lloyd designed many iconic and commercial buildings. This paper will thus discuss two specific artworks of Frank Lloyd Wright which made great impressions during his time. These artworks are Falling water House and Guggenheim of New York. The Guggenheim was to be a museum in New York that embodied Lloyd’s attempt to solidify the natural plasticity of the organic bodies in architecture (Frank, 2013). The corridors were interdependent sections but divided like the way the membranes in citrus fruits. Its spiral design looked like nautilus shell that had continuous spaces curving freely on each another (Levine, 1997). The medium is a print of B&W photograph, design, and drawing which was made in the year 1945. Next will be his artwork called the Falling water artwork of which chosen the subject was used to show a high level of innovation that put harmony in environment and humanity (Hess, 2005). The medium is also print photograph, design, and drawing and the period was the years of 1936 to 1938. These two artworks developed American architecture through innovative and environmentally friendly ways (Fowler & Wright, 2002). Annotated Bibliography Fowler, P., & Wright, F. L. (2002). Frank Lloyd Wright: Graphic Artist. New York: Pomegranate. This publication offers an informative details in the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright. It explains many of Wright's artworks and buildings that were characterized by glass windows. I have found this book as very useful as it will help in explaining why the artist designed the Falling Water and the Guggenheim Museum through organic architecture. Thus, it will help to make informed critic off the work of this artist. Frank, L. W. (2013). Frank Lloyd Wright Designs. New York: Pomegranate Communications. This book by Frank Lloyd Wright is a useful digital print that gives the readers a good chance to explore the organic artworks as the great American development in the commercial artworks. This book has complete prints of Frank’s work which will enable me to discuss and critic the two selected artworks. I find it very useful as it flows chronologically with ideas or Wright’s work which will provide valuable contextual information for the subject. Harris, J. (2007).

(Links to an external site.) As well, please take a look at the website of the exhibition's curator, artist Justin Randolph Thompson: (Links to an external site.) I would like each of you to start an original thread on ONE of the artworks in the online exhibition. As we examine the history of race relations in the United States - a history which very much affects current events - let's take a look at the picturing of race in periods of time and contexts such as the European Renaissance, Baroque and beyond. Let's think about how these images inform understanding of and advance ideas about race and identity. I invite you to take your original thread in whatever direction you wish. Let us remember that Art History is not outside current events which affect us all, but has much to say about the mentalities and social phenomena of our time. I look forward to a productive discussion! 2) ESSAY One aspect of art historical writing that combines iconography and iconology is the biographical approach. Often, art historians like to analyze works in the context of the identity and biography of their makers. With this approach, scholars believe that the life of an artist informs the way they make art and that our understanding of the work of art is deepened by our knowledge of the artist's life and personal identity. For your weekly written response, please review our biography readings on Leyster and Van Dyck to get a sense of the aspects of an artist's life that are considered significant in the context of art history. Then, select one Baroque artist from any part of this module (excluding Leyster and Van Dyck!). Research this artist's biography (starting with the National Gallery, Metropolitan, Rijksmuseum or other museum's online website is a good idea!) Next, select ONE work by your chosen artist that you think REFLECTS SOME ASPECT OF THE ARTIST'S LIFE/IDENTITY . For an example of how art historians connect an artist with her work, review this reading on Leyster (Links to an external site.) by Dr. Saskia Beranek or this reading on Van Dyck (Links to an external site.) by Michael John Partington. In a two page response, please analyze your work of art (formal analysis, iconography, iconology) in terms of HOW it reflects your artist's biography . Your thesis sentence for this project will propose a connection between the work and the artist herself. .\n\nOverviewIn this assignment, you have an opportunity to employ ar.docx\n\nOverviewIn this assignment, you have an opportunity to employ ar.docxhoney690131\n\nOverview In this assignment, you have an opportunity to employ art history knowledge and comparative essay writing skills covered in this Module. You will choose a landscape artwork from Eastern culture—either Japanese or Chinese—and one Western landscape by a European or American artist. Both artworks should have been made around the same time, between the 11th and 17th centuries. You will then compare and contrast these two paintings created during the same time period but from different cultures, drawing on course vocabulary, contextual analysis, and formal analysis. Instructions Mountain with River and Trees School of/style of Wang Yuanqi. Mountain with River and Trees. ca. 1642-1715. Ink on Paper. Used with permission of the British Museum. The Eastern (Asian) landscape tradition is markedly different from that of the Western (European). Traditional Asian artists intended to evoke meditative contemplation through visual imagery using atmospheric perspective, placement, and asymmetry. Eastern works also stress a reverence for nature and often include calligraphy or poetry as part of the primary subject. What ideas do European landscapes of the same time period convey? For this assignment, you will choose one example each of paintings that represent the Eastern and Western landscape tradition from the same time period. In your essay, compare and contrast each work's individual similarities and differences and identify major contrasts in these two cultural approaches. For basic information on how to approach this comparative essay, visit the Module 5 Writing Skills page. Step 1: Research First, conduct basic research on Eastern and Western landscape paintings and create a list that includes the major ways in which they are similar and different. Then, using the Art Research Guide sources or comparable sites, browse examples of both Eastern and Western landscape art and choose two examples that allow you to write a fully-developed essay based on three or more major points of comparison. Consider the following questions as you brainstorm your comparisons: What did each artist hope to accomplish with his or her work? What aspect of the landscape did each artist most value? Did the artists demonstrate personal connections with their landscapes, or were they conveying broader cultural messages? Do the artworks represent attitudes towards nature that continue on today? Explain each consideration in detail and refer directly to how they are demonstrated in the art itself. Next, summarize the primary points you will address in one \"thesis statement,\" which will appear as a sentence in your essay's introduction. Note that not all Eastern and Western landscapes will make strong enough statements to support a fully-developed essay. For example, if Eastern landscapes stress a reverence for nature, look for Western examples that either clearly do or do not represent the same idea. Your choices should provide you with at le.\n\nIntro to Art.Spring 2015Object AnalysisResearch PaperTh.docx\n\nIntro to Art.Spring 2015Object AnalysisResearch PaperTh.docxdoylymaura\n\nIntro to Art. Spring 2015 Object Analysis/Research Paper The assignment is to write a 2-3 page paper on an art work in a New York City museum. The idea is that you will go to the museum and have a chance to see the work in person, and that what you see will help to inform your paper. On the next page, you will find a list of recommended artworks and where they are located. However, you can also choose another work from any period, region of the world, and medium – subject to my approval. If this is from a period we have not discussed yet, just make sure you’ll know how to discuss the object correctly. Conduct a visual analysis of the object. Describe what you see, and address the art historical significance of the object. Topics you could address include: · Period, Movement or Style · Medium, Materials and Techniques · Form (eg., color, composition, line) · Subject Matter · Historical Context · Function · Reception · Artistic influences · Patron Conduct research to inform your discussion. You must use TWO SOURCES. Only one may be a generic textbook like the Gombrich or the Janson. For the other, I recommend a general book on the artist, the period/movement, or the specific artwork. The source must be scholarly - e.g. a book or an article for the journal. You can obtain these from the Queens Library, or use online databases like JSTOR or GoogleScholar. Required Format: · 2-3 pages, Double spaced, 1’’ margins all around, size 12 font (Times New Roman or Arial) · At the top of the paper, please provide me the Artist, Title, Date and location of the work. · Include 2 images – 1 of the artwork, and 1 of the wall label · Include proof you went to the museum – either your receipt or ticket · Proper bibliography and citation of your sources · Andy Warhol: Campbell’s Soup Cans 1962, Gold Marilyn, or Orange Car Crash 13 times (Pop Art) .\n\nTop five predictions today, .\n\nTop five predictions today, .Rupasingh82\n\nAs the world spins on its axis, the constant ebb and flow of current events, technological advancements, and social trends shape our daily lives.
