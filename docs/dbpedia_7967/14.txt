Directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the highly anticipated Formula 1 film has officially set its release dates: June 25, 2025, internationally, and June 27, 2025, in North America, with Warner Bros. Pictures handling the distribution.

This feature film, which features seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton as an executive producer, emerges from a groundbreaking partnership with Formula 1, integrating all 10 teams, drivers, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and race promoters.

Production of the Apple Original Film movie kicked off in 2023 and spans several Grand Prix locations around the globe, capturing the palpable tension and exhilaration of real races. Fans have already caught a glimpse of behind-the-scenes as filming took place during the 2023 British Grand Prix.

Brad Pitt stars as a former F1 driver making a gripping comeback, with Damson Idris playing a rookie challenging the racing norms. They represent APXGP, a fictional team crafted for the narrative, exploring the intricacies of mentorship, rivalry, and resilience in the fast-paced world of F1 racing.

The ensemble cast doesn't stop there. It boasts notable talents like Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia, and Samson Kayo.

This announcement has come after significant delays in filming of the currently unnamed film, which has been dubbed Apex. Hamilton explained some of the delays to the media during the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix race weekend. He commented, as quoted by Autosport:

"If there wasn't a strike we would be filming one of the really cool scenes here this weekend.

"But we'll continue on filming next year so you'll see them around more. We've already got great footage with the demo drivers, who have done a great job, as all the [F1] drivers got to see in Austin [2023].

"We'll keep pushing along. It's still going to be great, might cost a little bit more but I'm really confident in what Jerry is going to produce."

The British driver also opened up on the film during his recent appearance on popular YouTube series 'Hot Ones'. He explained:

"Racing movies, I feel like it's very, very hard to capture them.

"You know, each year you have to do filming [where] you're following a truck that has a camera on the back, so it's hard to catch that capture the speed.

"You know, you can't have a truck following filming us at 200 miles an hour, so it's all kind of faked at a slower speed and they speed it up. But this is all real-time, real speed.

"I think if you go back to like Steve McQueen, for example, back then they would have men laying on the front of the car with the camera, you know, like, or have a big camera on top of the helmet, where now we've got all this amazing new technology.

"So I feel like Joe [Kosinski] honestly, I think he's going to blow people away."
