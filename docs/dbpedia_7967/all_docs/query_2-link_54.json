        "text": "London — Brad Pitt's movie about Formula 1 coming to cinemas next year will simply be called “F1,” the racing series said Friday.\n\nSeven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton is a co-producer of the project, which collected footage at F1 circuits around the world this year and last.\n\nFootage was taken at Silverstone — home of the British Grand Prix — and at the Hungaroring near Budapest; as well as the historic Spa Francorchamps in Belgium; Japan’s popular Suzuka track; and Abu Dhabi’s Yas Marina circuit.\n\nPitt was at Silverstone on Friday and walked through the paddock area.\n\nIn the film, the 60-year-old American plays a former driver who returns to F1 alongside a rookie teammate, who is played by London-born actor Damson Idris. Their fictional team is called APXGP.\n\nThe film is directed by Joseph Kosinski of “Top Gun: Maverick” fame.\n\nThe film will be released next June, F1 said in a statement."
