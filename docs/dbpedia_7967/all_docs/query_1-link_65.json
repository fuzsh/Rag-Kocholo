The film starring the actor will be called “F1″ and will be released sometime in the summer of 2025.\n\nAlthough there is still a year left before moviegoers can see it, Formula 1 has confirmed that on Sunday, July 7, we will see the first teaser as part of the Silverstone Grand Prix.\n\nREAD ALSO: Actor Danny Trejo embroiled in Fourth of July fisticuffs\n\nREAD ALSO: LEGO Star Wars reveals more on Skeleton Crew\n\nWhat do we know about ‘F1′, the official movie of the race which stars Brad Pitt?\n\nThat Silverstone is the GP chosen to tease the film for the first time is no coincidence.

British world champion Lewis Hamilton is one of the co-producers of the Apple film.\n\nIt’s directed by cinematography veteran Joseph Kosinski. The director has had successes in his career such as ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ (2022), ‘Tron Legacy’ (2010) and ‘Oblivion’ (2013).\n\nREAD ALSO: Why is Brad Pitt’s F1 movie so expensive?\n\nWhat is Brad Pitt’s newest movie about?\n\nThe sports drama focuses on the life of a fictional retired Formula 1 driver named Sonny Hayes.
