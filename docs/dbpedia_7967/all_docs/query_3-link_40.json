        "text": "In writer/director Jon Watts’s upcoming original film Wolfs, which will make its world premiere at the 81st Venice Film Festival, Brad Pitt and George Clooney are finally sharing the screen together again for the first time in 16 years. Now, Apple Original Films has made a fresh deal with Watts to write, direct, and produce a sequel for Pitt and Clooney.\n\nWolfs is also slated to have a limited theatrical run, beginning on September 20, before bowing globally on Apple TV+ on Friday, September 27. This strategy is a bit of a pivot from the original plan of giving the film a wide theatrical release, the hybrid strategy Apple used for Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and Ridley Scott’s Napoleon. Apple will continue that method for another Brad Pitt film, his upcoming Formula One drama F1 from Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski.\n\nWolfs stars Pitt and Clooney as a pair of fixers called in on the same job where a dead body (presumably) needs to be taken care of. Usually operating as lone wolves, Pitt’s Nick and Clooney’s Jack are thrust into an increasingly stressful, unasked-for, single-night working relationship. This becomes especially true when the dead body turns out to be not so dead after all.\n\nThe Pitt and Clooney reunion has been a long time coming, arriving 24 years after they first appeared in Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean’s Eleven franchise, playing Rusty Ryan and Danny Ocean, respectively. We haven’t seen them on screen together since the Coen Brothers’ 2008 dark comedy Burn After Reading, so it was big news when it was announced that they were co-starring and co-producing Wolfs. Pitt’s Plan B and Clooney’s Smokehouse Pictures both produced Watts’s original film, and as Deadline reports, Wolfs has tested strongly with audiences.\n\nThe cast includes Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, Poorna Jagannathan, Rob Riddell, Irina Dubova, and Hassani Rizzo. Wolfs is Watts’ first original film since his breakout Cop Car—he has lately been the helmer behind Sony’s mega-popular and critically acclaimed Spider-Man franchise, starring Tom Holland and Zendaya.\n\n“Wolfs is the kind of big event movie that makes Apple TV+ such an exceptional home for the best in entertainment,” Apple Original Films head of features Matt Dentler said in a statement. “With George and Brad’s remarkable and engaging chemistry under Jon Watts’ extraordinary direction, Wolfs blends all the great elements of comedy, action, and drama into a hugely entertaining movie that will leave audiences ready for what’s next. Releasing the movie to theaters before making it widely available to Apple TV+ customers brings the best of both worlds to audiences, and we’re excited to see fans embrace the movie as we start working with Jon on the sequel.”\n\nCheck out the trailer below. Wolfs will be released in theaters on September 20 and will stream exclusively on Apple TV+ on September 27."
