        "text": "Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt reportedly will be in the mix at next weekend’s Rolex Roar Before 24, the three-day test runs that are the final dress rehearsal for the Rolex 24 At Daytona International Speedway.\n\nPitt is in Daytona to be filmed in a yet-unnamed movie that revolves around the world of Formula 1 racing, according to media reports.\n\nRacing news website racer.com reported that the production will be filming during IMSA’s Roar Before The 24 test runs from Jan. 19-21 as well as the following week as the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship launches its season with the Jan. 25-28 Rolex 24 At Daytona.\n\nThe presence of the film crews, though not necessarily the film’s star, also was acknowledged at an advance meeting of photographers to outline parameters for covering the event, according to those in attendance.\n\nBrad Pitt in Daytona: Where should the star and his entourage eat while filming in Daytona Beach?\n\nBrad Pitt Formula 1 movie also will film in Daytona Beach Shores, New Smyrna Beach\n\nThere also has been talk that the production will be filming at other area locations, including a yet-to-be-confirmed surf shop in Daytona Beach Shores and Pappas Drive-In & Family Restaurant in New Smyrna Beach.\n\nAt Pappas, owner Vic Ganoe confirmed that the restaurant will be closed Jan. 23-29 while the movie is being filmed on the property.\n\nRacing schedules: Rolex 24 at Daytona and Roar Before weekends are fast approaching\n\nIt’s “very cool” for New Smyrna Beach to be a location for the film, Ganoe said, adding that some of the restaurant’s employees will be featured in scenes shot at the eatery.\n\nBrad Pitt movie includes 'Top Gun: Maverick' director, Lewis Hamilton as producer\n\nThe Formula 1-based movie is directed by Joseph Kosinski (“Top Gun: Maverick”) and includes seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton as a producer, according to racer.com. It previous filmed on location at multiple F1 race weekends in 2023, including November’s Las Vegas Grand Prix.\n\nPlot details are scarce, but the story reportedly revolves around an aging driver who is brought back to help a struggling newcomer.\n\nIn July, Pitt offered the following plot summary to industry trade magazine Variety:\n\nHe said that he plays “a guy who raced in the 1990s… who has a horrible crash, craps out and disappears, then he’s racing in other disciplines. His friend, played by Javier Bardem, he’s a team owner, contacts him. They’re a last place team, they’re 21-22 on the grid, they’ve never scored a point. But they have a young phenom, played by Damson Idris, and they bring me in as kind of a Hail Mary and hijinks ensue. Tell you what’s amazing about it — there are cameras mounted all over the car — you’ve never seen speed, you’ve never seen just the G-forces like this. It’s really, really exciting.”\n\nDaytona's movie history\n\nThe rumored Daytona filming would mark the second time in recent years that IMSA and its GT category have been featured in a major studio film.\n\nThe 2019 movie “The Art Of Racing In The Rain” focused on a driver who held ambitions of reaching F1 and raced at the Rolex 24 At Daytona, among other races.\n\nNews-Journal restaurant writer Helena Perray contributed to this report."
