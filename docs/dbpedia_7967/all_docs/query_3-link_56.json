        "text": "Twenty years ago, a film synonymous with the concept of “so bad it’s good” changed the cinematic arts forever. Tommy Wiseau’s 2003 directorial debut, The Room, received overwhelmingly negative reviews upon release. Despite that, it was able to garner love from audiences and, to this day, there is undeniable enjoyment to be had while watching Johnny’s life fall apart.\n\nI have always adored “bad” films. I use the term loosely since film is subjective, and every film has merit. That subjectivity also attracts healthy discussion and opens the space for articles like this, in which we look at the films that the Letterboxd community have given the highest ratio of a single star and a heart. On the surface, a single star rating on a film should make it easy to identify as a terrible movie, a failed concept, a problematic idea. But one star with a heart? That’s more complicated. And more fun.\n\nTo that end, in the recent 2022 Year in Review, Letterboxd changed the name of the “Most Loved to Hate” category to “Low Rated, Most Loved” to reflect the more complex feelings we film lovers have for movies with low ratings.\n\nAnd what are these feelings? Perhaps reality television is a helpful comparison: Why watch The Bachelorette on a Monday night if not to be entertained; to experience the euphoric, joyous feeling of watching an admittedly goofy concept? It’s the heady combination of guilt, irony and a great time. A not-good movie made with passion, care, and an idea can invoke those same emotions.\n\nFiguring it’s always best to go to the source—Letterboxd reviews, of course—I asked Letterboxd’s numbers department for help to identify the films we might be talking about. I had my suspicions, and the data confirms them. The stats team came through with two Low Rated, Most Loved lists for me: the 50 films with the highest total of low-likes and hearts on Letterboxd (a popularity measure), and the 50 films with the highest ratio of low-likes to hearts (the true measure, in my opinion).\n\nSome math nerdery: To establish a reliable data search, the team set the “low-likes” rating range at 0.5-to-1.5 stars out of five, and the minimum number of likes at 1,000. (By comparison, LouFerrigno’s Anti-Letterboxd Top 250—a delightful “exercise in misery” on which many of these films also appear—has a 500-view minimum.)\n\nThe Room, David Ayer’s Suicide Squad and Tom Hooper’s Cats make up the top three on the first list. (The Room is far and away the biggest “winner” here, with around 10,000 more low-likes than the other two.) I would happily argue that these are some of the best “bad movies” of all time. I have seen all three films at the cinema, and I was always entertained. Wiseau, Ayer, and Hooper are also deeply passionate about each of their respective projects and other films on the list strike a similar chord: middling efforts, committed directors, fun times.\n\nLawrence Kasanoff’s 2012 animated comedy Foodfight! tops the list. Cats is still there (let’s face it, Cats will always be there). But here’s a fun fact: John Travolta and Neil Breen dominate the list, each with three films in the top fifteen.\n\nFor those who don’t know or have tried to avoid learning about him, Neil Breen is a real estate agent, architect and self-financing filmmaker who has gained quite the cult following with his low-budget films—to the point that we must always, according to Letterboxd reviews, write Neil Breen’s name out in full every time we mention Neil Breen.\n\nI greatly admire anyone who works hard to make a movie, even when people don’t like it. Neil Breen clearly has a blast making his fantasy thrillers and even though they aren’t outstanding, they have much charm. As Thomas Callahan writes on Letterboxd in a recent review of Neil Breen’s most popular title, Fateful Findings, “Neil Breen committed so hard to the political thriller/mystery/Lynchian fantasy that he put a twist IN THE CREDITS. Astounding. I wish every weirdo with a passing interest in filmmaking could have the money, time, and willpower that Neil Breen has.”\n\nAnd Kednanze, who recently watched Twisted Pair, a sci-fi thriller in which Neil Breen stars as identical twins, gets to the nub of the writer-director-star’s appeal in a rare five-star review of the film: “I have more respect for Neil Breen than I do for any other filmmaker alive, and I say that in total seriousness. The man may be completely devoid of any talent whatsoever (both in front of and behind the camera), but goddamn is he pure. He’s never once let public opinion affect his work… Who cares if he’s under the delusion that he’s making legitimate movies and people unironically like them? This man has the innocence of a child, and we need to protect and cultivate that.”\n\nAt the other end of the celebrity spectrum, John Travolta is one of the biggest stars of all time. His handful of iconic roles (from Grease to Pulp Fiction to Face/Off) play a big part in why I enjoy watching any film where he is involved. There is something reassuring to us ordinary folk about someone with such cachet landing in such laughable stinkers as Gotti, Fred Durst’s The Fanatic and Battlefield Earth. The latter, directed by Academy Award-winning Star Wars art director Roger Christian, has a 1.1 out of five star-average, making it one of the lowest-rated films on the ratio list.\n\nWhile John brings his full commitment as an actor, Letterboxd reviews make it apparent why these films fail to rate highly, while still being fun. “[The] movie is allergic to the camera being flat,” writes Garfriends in a five-star (!) review of the Dutch angle-saturated Battlefield Earth. “There are worse movies out there, some of them much worse,” argues Tim Brayton after a half-star rewatch of the same, “but dollar-for-dollar, I truly and with all my heart don’t believe that I can name something that wasted more resources on something more astonishingly inept. Essential viewing for every serious fan of the cinema.”\n\nWhile many of the Low Rated, Most Loved films with high heart-to-like ratios are movies I would associate with “ironic” favorites—Ratatoing and Cool Cat Saves the Kids, for example—I think Travolta’s trio of low-rated titles embody the heart of this essay: entertainment. Relaxed enjoyment, uncomplicated pleasure, happy diversion: these are the best signifiers of what makes a film worthy of one-star-with-a-heart.\n\nThe Magical Mr. Mistoffelees is another. It’s impossible not to discuss films that embody the one-star-heart ideal without mentioning Cats and its impact. From an infamous trailer to its streaming availability as the world went into lockdown, the Tom Hooper adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical of T.S. Eliot’s poems has become a cult classic.\n\nOne of the first films to be associated with ‘so bad it’s good’ cult cinema, as Hannah Strong writes in an earlier Journal story about the camp-bad films that got us through the early months of the pandemic, was Ed Wood’s Plan 9 From Outer Space. The 1957 sci-fi horror is on both the highest low-likes and the highest ratio of low-likes lists, and I watched it for the first time while writing this piece. I was enamored by Plan 9—how could I not have been, with those gleefully basic flying saucer effects? (A must-watch: Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, Mark Patrick Carducci’s 1992 documentary, which is both longer and more highly rated than the original film.)\n\nPaul Benis is one such Crystal Skull cheerleader, and he’s gone to town in a review of a recent rewatch in preparation for this year’s Dial of Destiny, praising director Steven Spielberg’s roasting of capitalism and ’50s white America, and his command of CGI: “What happens when you embrace the technological advancement of CGI and one of cinemas greatest talents with an adventure story? A goofy movie. A goofy movie in a franchise where the last goofy movie was Temple of Doom.\n\n“The shots are overexposed and glamorized to the max. The series has never looked so visually stylish. Maybe people wanted to see the same practical effects shot on film Spielberg magic of old, but times have changed. The movie also moves at such a brisk pace that I honestly didn’t fully see its brilliance on first watch. Granted my balls had barely dropped by that point.”\n\nLet us hope James Mangold can deliver a five-star experience with Dial of Destiny, so that we get the Daniels on board to write installment six with their “Indiana Jones and the Daughters of the Confederacy” idea (as heard on The Letterboxd Show), hopefully with some Ke Huy Quan action as a grown-up Short Round.\n\nI asked around Letterboxd community members in my activity feed about films they would rate one star with a heart. One of the most interesting answers was from one of my mutuals, Libby Caldwell. They told me, “No, because that’s not how I rate movies. Based on merit, F9 and The Room would be one-star films, but since I consider enjoyment and quality, I end up giving films that would be rated one-star with a heart, 3.5 or four stars.” This was a common answer amongst those I asked. Many mutuals were not open to the idea of giving a like to any film under 2.5.\n\nBabe: Pig in the City has a devoted fanbase, largely for the way it diverts thematically and geographically from the first film. I was thoroughly impressed with it and wouldn’t consider it a one-star film; indeed the overall Letterboxd rating has risen from below three stars to its current, perfectly good 3.0 out of five average.\n\nThe truth is, this piece hasn’t been the easiest to write. Few movies are purposefully made to be bad. When I get stressed sometimes about what ratings I gave films, it helps to remember that ratings aren’t the only measure of a movie and that films affect everyone in different ways. We each have paths to recognizing the passion and creativity in a project, and connecting with other cinephiles on Letterboxd to learn more about their takes is a core part of embracing the idea of one star with a heart.\n\nThe cinema is my second home and I am a wide enjoyer of movies, but since this essay is about the low-rated films we love in spite of themselves (and ourselves), I want to finish by mentioning a few movies that I have gladly given the low-like to. Jack and Jill, in which Adam Sandler plays the titular twins, may have been the first movie I saw in the theater that I considered to be a “one star with a heart” experience. I can still remember the joy I felt watching that admittedly bad film.\n\nSince I am a basic boy, The Room and Cats are also films that resonate with me. My local arthouse theater, The Enzian, recently held a screening of The Room, with co-star Greg Sestero in residence for a Q&A before the showing. I would have gone regardless, but felt it my duty to be there given the topic of this piece.\n\nWhile in line, I had the opportunity to talk to many fans of The Room, and the energy in those discussions was electric. Rarely do I feel right at home, but everyone there was so excited—from the memories of each person’s first watch of The Room to discussions of the film’s legacy. At the film’s start, there was thunderous applause. People clapped to the music in each sex scene and yelled, “Who are you?!!” whenever a new character appeared without an introduction. We quoted every notable line and threw spoons at the screen, as is tradition.\n\nAs the credits rolled, I was smiling ear to ear. Outside in the lobby of the Enzian, there was a line forming to meet Sestero, who clearly loves engaging with fans. When I reached him, I explained that I was writing this article on one-star films that Letterboxd members love. He was more than happy to oblige with a quote, telling me: “If you have an idea you believe in, go for it! Even if people laugh at you and think it is not something that is interesting... People may still end up caring about it twenty years later. Technically, [The Room] is not Back to the Future or Jurassic Park, but at the end of the day, it is still a movie that stuck with people.”\n\nI thanked Sestero for coming out to the screening and chatted with him a bit longer about his new cult horror, Miracle Valley, which is now streaming on Tubi with a 2.7 out of five star average. I admire that Sestero is somebody who has taken a lot of shit for his previous work (albeit a lot of praise as well) but still manages to be so passionate about his newer indie films. No doubt as The Room’s 20th anniversary approaches this June, he’ll be in ever more demand, and deservedly so.\n\nThis is what the movies are all about: the chance to see something new, the shared experience, enjoying different viewpoints. Most of all, engaging with the filmmaker’s vision. You may like a film, you may not, but ideally you should feel something—enough to pump the blood into that Letterboxd heart."
