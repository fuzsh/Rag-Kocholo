A film that wins critical acclaim is likely to be an R-rated drama, adapted from a prize-winning play or book and based on a true story. It is unlikely to be a sequel or remake, a comedy or musical, a summer release, a big-budget project, have a PG-13 rating, open on numerous screens or do a big box office on the first weekend.",

        "text": "But box-office hits may have entirely different profiles.\n\nDean Simonton, a professor of psychology at UC Davis, has subjected thousands of feature-length, English-language, narrative films to a battery of statistical tests – including Pearson product-moment coefficients and hierarchical regression analyses – to get at the formula for cinematic creative triumph and box-office success.\n\nSimonton, an expert on human creativity, is the author of \"Origins of Genius: Darwinian Perspectives on Creativity.\" He is at work on a new book, \"Great Flicks: Scientific Studies of Cinematic Creativity and Aesthetics.\"\n\n\"Exceptional creativity is frequently viewed as a highly individualistic phenomenon,\" Simonton said. \"But there is at least one type of artistic expression that is extremely prominent, often highly profitable and inherently collective in nature: the feature film. Motion pictures provide a valuable research site for investigating group artistic creativity under real-world conditions.\"\n\nDean Simonton will summarize his research at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association on Friday, Aug. 17."
