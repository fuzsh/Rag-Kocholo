        "text": "It’s been a long road, but Brad Pitt’s Formula 1-themed movie is almost ready to roll out to cinemas.\n\nThe yet-to-be-titled flick, directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, will be released globally on June 25, 2025 and arrive in North American theaters on June 27, 2025, according to a statement shared by Apple Original Films and Formula 1 on Tuesday.\n\nCreated in collaboration with F1, the film will give moviegoers insight into the exhilarating world of professional racing. Pitt will star as a former F1 driver returning to the sport, while British actor Damson Idris (pictured top) will play his teammate at APXGP. The fictional team is 11th on the grid in the movie and pilots machines with a distinctive black-and-gold livery. Other notable actors in the star-studded cast include Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia, and Samson Kayo.\n\nTo ensure both accuracy and authenticity, the production team worked closely with the F1 community, including all 10 teams, the drivers, the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), and race promoters. Seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton is serving as a consultant for the movie, with help from his production company Dawn Apollo Films. The British driver has reportedly been in regular contact with Pitt to help him prepare for the lead role. Bruckheimer has also said Pitt trained for four or five months behind the wheel, adding he is “an amazing driver.”\n\nIn order to realistically emulate the high-stakes trackside environment, the film has been shot in real-time during various international Grand Prixs. Filming began in July 2023, with Pitt putting the pedal to the metal at Silverstone during last year’s British Grand Prix. “I don’t know if you could call mine a hot lap, I’d call it kind of a warm lap,” the actor said after his drive around the race course. “I’ve taken a few tours, unintentionally, through the grass.”\n\nThe team will film at the upcoming British Grand Prix in the summer and then shoot during several other races before wrapping up at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in December. The film will then hit the big screen the following June. The global rollout will include IMAX theaters, too, meaning that guests can be fully immersed in the world of motorsport with crystal-clear images and powerful sound. Who needs to go to an actual GP?"
