        "text": "Part of this story\n\nWith fierce rivalries, high-octane, unpredictable action and unprecedented skill on show, it’s no wonder that Formula One has been so thoroughly embraced by Hollywood, becoming the subject of some iconic films and TV shows. But with so many choices out there, which are the best Formula One stories to hit the big and small screens? We’ve got you covered – check out our list of six ace F1 films and TV shows you can watch now.\n\n01\n\nIn the Wings\n\nNew Zealand driver Liam Lawson was thrust into the Formula One spotlight during a chaotic Dutch GP, where he stepped in for the injured Daniel Ricciardo at Scuderia AlphaTauri for the Dutch Grand Prix and finished an impressive 13th. In the Wings chronicles Lawson's fight to prove himself while simultaneously contending for the Super Formula Japan titles.\n\n31 min\n\nIn the Wings\n\nFormula One driver Liam Lawson builds his F1 resume in his busiest season yet – 2023.\n\n02\n\nThe History of the Pit Stop\n\nIn a sport built upon eye-popping skill and speed, the pit stop is arguably one of the most impressive aspects of Formula One. In the time it takes to blink, pit stops see teams demonstrate incredible levels of focus and coordination to deliver a choreographed performance of such clockwork-efficiency that what should take minutes, instead takes moments. The History of the Pit Stop gives viewers the chance to see just how these incredible feats of teamwork come together, and what the pit stop means for both drivers and crew. For a thrilling peek behind the curtain, The History of the Pit Stop is a must-watch.\n\n45 min\n\nThe History of the Pit Stop\n\nThe mavericks who pioneered the modern pit stop made it a raceday staple that takes less than two seconds.\n\n03\n\nRed Bull Racing Road Trips\n\n8 min\n\nPérez's Nevada night out\n\nWhat happens in Vegas doesn’t always stay in Vegas. Relive an epic night with Formula One driver Sergio Pérez.\n\nHop on board and explore Grand Prix host cities with F1 drivers Max Verstappen, David Coulthard and more in Red Bull Racing Road Trips.\n\nOver the years, the Red Bull Racing Formula One Team have taken F1 cars and drivers on the road to explore (and impress!) Grand Prix host cities around the world.\n\nSee Sergio Pérez hit Las Vegas, Daniel Ricciardo brave the Outback of his home nation of Australia, and Max Verstappen racing ice speedway star Franky Zorn, among many other epic trips. Hop on board and enjoy the ride!\n\n04\n\nOpen the Doors\n\nOpen the Doors is a behind-the-scenes documentary that follows the newest name in Formula One and reveals the pressure involved in starting – and restarting – a season put on hold by a global pandemic.\n\n20 min\n\nOpen the Doors\n\nThe 2021 F1 season is upon us, so now's a good time to see Scuderia AlphaTauri prepare to make their 2020 debut at the Red Bull Ring.\n\n05\n\nABC of F1\n\nSo, what if you want to go back to basics? Formula One, as with any sport, can seem overwhelming thanks to its deep well of history, jargon, and decade upon decade of changing rules, disciplines and personalities. Thankfully, the ABC of… series gives you the answers you need, in brilliant episodes that are both comprehensive and compulsive.\n\nFrom kayaking to mountain biking, the series offers incredible insight to give you a crash course in what makes your new favourite hobby tick. The Formula One instalment (Season 1, Episode 8) is no different and can give you a cracking primer into everything from the terminology to the heroes and drama of F1.\n\n27 min\n\nABC of… Formula One\n\nGet a crash course in F1 racing, with lessons in the terminology, history, heroes and drama of the sport.\n\n06\n\nTwo 2 Four Wheels\n\nThere have been few successful instances of professional athletes transferring from one sport to another. Who could forget Michael Jordan’s ill-fated baseball career, for example? Yet in the short film Two 2 Four Wheels, two MotoGP™ champions (Marc Márquez and Dani Pedrosa) and motocross champion Tony Cairoli see just how well their considerable skills on two wheels translate to Formula One, first in an F1 simulator at Red Bull Racing HQ in the UK, before actually hitting the real-life track the Red Bull Ring in Austria. Spoiler alert: It turns out they’re pretty handy, regardless of the number of wheels.\n\nOh no! This video is currently not available.\n\nExplore more motorsports movies\n\n07\n\nGround Effect\n\nFor over 20 years, one of Formula One’s most iconic tracks – the Mexican Grand Prix – lay dormant, with the doors slamming shut after the driver-favourite circuit failed to live up to safety standards. In 2015, however, the event was revived, with the track undergoing serious surgery to fulfil today’s FIA requirements. Ground Effect, a short film documenting the race against time to bring this track back to life, shows the thrilling efforts behind the rebuild as millions of fans worldwide waited with bated breath for F1 Mexico to find its way back.\n\n26 min\n\nGround Effect\n\nAfter 23 years away, Formula One returns to Mexico City’s legendary Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez track.\n\n08\n\nMechanics of Creativity\n\nDocumentary Mechanics of Creativity sees former Formula One superstar David Coulthard visit Havana, Cuba, to meet with the mechanics hailed as the most creative in the world, experiencing first-hand a brotherhood able of keeping their cars running for decades through a mix of ingenuity, passion and creativity.\n\nBeyond the eye-candy of seeing some of the 60,000 classic cars on Havana’s streets (a result of the country’s revolution: cars can only be bought and sold if they ran on the streets of Cuba before 1959), viewers also get to see Coulthard race through some of Havana’s historic neighbourhoods in a 1955 Pontiac for the Cuban Classic Car Rally. For anyone looking for a fascinating glimpse into a different racing culture, Mechanics of Creativity is a must-watch.\n\n23 min\n\nMechanics of Creativity\n\nFormula One driver David Coulthard travels to Cuba, to drive in a race unlike any he's run before.\n\n09\n\nBehind the Visor\n\nThe life of a Formula One driver is one that many envy – driving the fastest cars and visiting some of the best cities the world has to offer.

The drivers from the respective teams race each other in local vehicles on local tracks of the cities they travel to on the Formula One calendar.\n\n8 min\n\nF1 drivers vs hovercraft\n\nWatch F1 drivers go head-to-head in sci-fi hovercraft racing, deep in the desert outside Las Vegas."
