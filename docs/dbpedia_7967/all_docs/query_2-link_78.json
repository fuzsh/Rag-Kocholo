Pictures to distribute the film worldwide, will reveal the first material of 'F1' in an upcoming teaser on Sunday 7 July.\n\nThe film stars Brad Pitt as a former F1 star who returns to the championship to race for the fictional APXGP team, alongside a rookie portrayed by Damson Idris.\n\nOther cast members include Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo.\n\nSeven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton is a producer for the project, with the Mercedes driver also providing his input in the movie's script.\n\nThe film is put together by Top Gun Maverick director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and following delays caused by Hollywood's SAG-AFTRA strikes last year, it will be released on 25 July 2025 in international markets and on 27 July 2025 in the United States.\n\ncars being filmed for new F1 film APEX starring Brad Pitt\n\nPhoto by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images\n\nWork on the project has been continuing at pace in recent weeks, including at this weekend's British Grand Prix at Silverstone, using the Formula 2 car Mercedes has modified to run in fictional APXGP colours.\n\nAs has been the case at other events, AXGP has received its own branded pitlane garages where its cast and crew are operating from.\n\nOther filming locations for this year include the Hungaroring, Spa-Francorchamps, Mexico City, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi.\n\nReports have surfaced that the Hollywood strikes have made the film's budget balloon to over $300 million, although that figure has been contested by the producers."
