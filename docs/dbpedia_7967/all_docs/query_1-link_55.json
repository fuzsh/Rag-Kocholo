        "text": "Hollywood star Brad Pitt is set to lead a high-octane Formula One movie slated for a summer 2025 release.\n\nThe film, which reunites the creative force behind the blockbuster 'Top Gun: Maverick', is a collaboration between Apple and Warner Bros., featuring a wide theatrical release with IMAX screenings.\n\nNorth American audiences can catch the action on June 27, 2025, following its international rollout starting June 25.\n\nDirected by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the yet-to-be-titled movie landed at Apple following a deal guaranteeing a significant theatrical run, with a commitment to a release window of at least 30 days.\n\nThis partnership strategy follows Apple's previous collaborations with major studios like Paramount and Sony for the releases of 'Killers of the Flower Moon' and 'Napoleon'.\n\nJoining Pitt on screen is an ensemble cast including Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia, and Samson Kayo.\n\nPitt portrays a former driver making a comeback to Formula 1, alongside Idris as his teammate in the fictional APXGP team.\n\nAuthenticity is at the heart of the production, which involved collaboration with ten Formula 1 teams and included scenes shot during actual F1 races.\n\nProduced by Kosinski, Bruckheimer, and Chad Oman of Jerry Bruckheimer Films; Pitt, Dede Gardner, and Jeremy Kleiner for Plan B Entertainment; and Lewis Hamilton under his Dawn Apollo Films banner, the film promises to deliver thrilling race sequences and an insider's look into the world of Formula One racing."
