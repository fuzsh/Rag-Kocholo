        "text": "For movie lovers, the beauty of Netflix Netflix is that you can expect a healthy array of intriguing Originals and engrossing outside content in any given month—and that was certainly the case in April. The fourth month of the year might have been the best so far for Netflix subscribers in 2024, as the streaming platform gave us all kinds of wonderful cinematic options, from epic sci-fi operas to box-office-shattering rom-coms to sadly forgotten spy thrillers. There were dozens of great new movies to choose from this past month on Netflix, but ten stood out above the rest.\n\nWhich ten were those? Let’s take a look. Below in the first section, you’ll find my picks for the ten best movies to hit Netflix in April 2024. Then at the bottom of this article, I’ve posted a comprehensive list of every single new film that became available this past month. Whether it’s within the ten I recommend or on that larger list, I guarantee a great new movie is just waiting for you on Netflix. Hopefully we can find it today.\n\nThe 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In April 2024\n\nAnyone But You (2023)\n\nFor the first time in recent memory, a rom-com took the box office by storm in 2023. In Anyone But You, Bea and Ben (played by Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, respectively) seem destined for romantic bliss after their first date. However, a bizarre twist sends their burgeoning passion into a tailspin, only to find themselves posing as a couple at an Australian wedding. Directed by Will Gluck, who mastered the easy breezy rom-com formula with hits like Easy A and Friends with Benefits, this film cleverly weaves Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing into a modern tale of feigned love and genuine laughter. Despite mixed reviews, its December 2023 release captivated audiences worldwide, amassing $216 million and proving that charm can triumph over cliché. If you’re a fan of the classic romantic comedy formula, then you have to put Anyone But You on your watchlist, because this sort of competence in the genre doesn’t come very often.\n\nRebel Moon: Part Two: The Scargiver (2024)\n\nWhenever Zack Snyder releases a movie, whether it’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Army of the Dead or Watchmen, it’s followed by controversy—mostly because people think his movies are so bad. But you can count me as one of his fans, and, personally, Rebel Moon: Part Two: The Scargiver represents a high point for anyone who appreciates his captivating aesthetic. The Rebel Moon sequel escalates the battle for Veldt’s freedom as Kora (played by the most underrated actress in the industry, Sofia Boutella) leads her group against the maniacal Admiral Atticus Noble (played with cartoonish delight by Ed Skrein). Set against a sprawling cosmic backdrop, this chapter deepens the rebels' fight to protect their newfound home from the clutches of the tyrannical Imperium. Released just months after the first movie (with a director’s cut coming later this year), Part Two enhances the story with compelling explorations of the characters’ pasts, setting the stage for a monumental clash that seeks to forge a future free from oppression.\n\nSuzume (2023)\n\nIn Suzume, a young girl's ordinary life is swept into an extraordinary adventure when she encounters a mysterious young man who is on a quest to close portals that dangerously link the Earth to the sky. Directed by Makoto Shinkai, who brought us recent anime classics like Your Name. and Weathering with You, this visually stunning animated film weaves elements of fantasy, romance and drama into a gripping, heartrending narrative about loss, about resilience, about the ultimate journey towards closure we all must trek. As Suzume, voiced by Nanoka Hara, travels across Japan with her multi-dimension-traveling companion, the scenery transforms into a breathtaking backdrop for their unfolding story, filled with lovable characters and whimsical charm, all the while captivating us with its beauty and gentle exploration of the connections that define us.\n\nFor a great explanation of Suzume’s deeper meaning, check out this thorough breakdown.\n\nAnna (2019)\n\nEvery once in a while, a movie that was released to little fanfare can find a second life on Netflix—and that’s exactly what happened with Anna. In this highly stylized frilm from Luc Besson, who has entertained us for decades with compelling stories like Léon: The Professional, The Fifth Element and Lucy, a strikingly beautiful fashion model harbors a secret life as a deadly government assassin. This 2019 film that didn’t make much of an impact upon release (largely due to poor marketing) takes viewers on a gripping journey through the dual lives of its protagonist, Anna—played with alluring grace by Russian model Sasha Luss. As she navigates the dark corridors of international espionage, the layers of her complex identity unfold in a series of high-stakes missions. Supporting performances by Helen Mirren, Luke Evans and Cillian Murphy add depth to this stylish, action-packed thriller that keeps audiences guessing until the last reveal.\n\nCity Hunter (2024)\n\nIt’s always an ambitious (and dangerous) plight to adapt a classic manga series for the big screen—especially if it’s a live-action adaptation. From Ghost in the Shell to One Piece to Cowboy Bebop, these sorts of ventures are usually released to mixed results. The latest highly anticipated Japanese live-action adaptation from Netflix is pulling its story from City Hunter, in which Ryo Saeba (played by Ryohei Suzuki in the film) navigates the perilous underbelly of modern-day Shinjuku. As a top-tier \"sweeper,\" he, alongside Hideyuki Makimura (Masanobu Ando) and Fumino Kimura (Saeko Nogami), tackle high-stakes criminal puzzles with a blend of charisma and danger. The film promises a thrilling blend of action and humor, appealing to longtime fans and newcomers alike, and expands on the legacy of the beloved manga series, which has captivated audiences for decades.\n\nFreud’s Last Session (2023)\n\nEvery once in a while we receive a captivating performance from a cherished actor and Oscar winner...and we never even hear about it. That seems to be the case with Freud’s Last Session, which stars recent Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins as Sigmund Freud, who, alongside Matthew Goode’s C.S. Lewis, delves into profound debates on faith, humanity and personal history amidst the looming shadow of World War II. Directed by Matthew Brown, who brought us other biographical dramas like The Man Who Knew Infinity and London Town, this intellectually stimulating drama captures a historic collision of minds in 1939 England, offering insights into the complexities of belief and the human condition through a series of intense, dialogue-heavy exchanges. The film weaves global events into personal struggles, creating a compelling backdrop for this clash of titans.\n\nKing Richard (2021)\n\nIt’s crazy to think that the famous slap heard around the world from Will Smith happened...three years ago. That moment has overshadowed by the fact that, on that same evening, Smith won a much-deserved Oscar for his role in King Richard. This biographical drama tells the inspiring story of Richard Williams, an unwavering father who shaped two of the greatest tennis players ever” Venus and Serena Williams. Will Smith delivers a compelling performance as Richard, whose visionary methods and fierce determination defy the odds stacked against his daughters in a sport historically dominated by athletes from vastly different backgrounds. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green, who directed films like Bob Marley: One Love and Joe Bell, this gripping story highlights the power of family, perseverance and believing in the impossible, making it a heartfelt tribute to the man behind the champions.\n\nStrange Way of Life (2023)\n\nPedro Almodóvar is the kind of director who releases films to what can seem like relatively little fanfare—especially given how fantastic they usually are. The director of great gems like Volver, All About My Mother and The Skin I Love In now brings us Strange Way of Life, which casts Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal as two former hired guns whose paths cross again in the remote town of Bitter Creek. What starts as a nostalgic reunion soon unveils deeper (and by deeper, I mean romantic) motives, as the duo confronts unresolved issues amidst the desolate desert backdrop. This Almodóvar film adds a poignant chapter to the director’s diverse filmography, exploring themes of friendship, betrayal and the inexorable passage of time through its arresting story and powerful performances.\n\nScoop (2024)\n\nGreat journalism movies feel few and far between these days. Classics like Network and All the President’s Men were much more common in the 1970s than these days, when winning projects like Spotlight or The Post hit like a breath of fresh air. Netlfix has given us another great story for the genre, however, with Scoop, which dives into the tense preparations behind Prince Andrew's explosive 2019 Newsnight interview. Directed by Philip Martin and featuring Gillian Anderson as journalist Emily Maitlis, the film reveals how interview booker Sam McAlister, portrayed by Billie Piper, navigated palace politics to secure a near-impossible interview. Rufus Sewell plays the embattled prince, whose televised missteps lead to a public retreat. Adapted by Peter Moffat and Geoff Bussetil from true events, the film celebrates the relentless women behind the scenes who shaped one of the decade's biggest news stories, illustrating the power struggle between the media and monarchy.\n\nThe Little Things (2021)\n\nIt’s not often that you get three Oscar winners playing the three lead parts in a murder-mystery thriller—but that’s exactly what happened when The Little Things hit screens back in 2021. Directed by John Lee Hancock, who gave us intimate character studies like The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks and The Founder, this deeply suspenseful detective story plunges viewers into a murky world of crime and redemption. Denzel Washington stars as Deputy Sheriff Joe \"Deke\" Deacon, whose hunt for a serial killer, played with by maniacal intensity by Jared Leto, leads him into a dark labyrinth of past sins and shaky alliances. Joined by Rami Malek's Detective Jim Baxter, the duo's quest not only challenges their moral compasses but also blurs the lines between right and wrong. This neo-noir crime flick slowly builds tension, culminating in a haunting exploration of obsession and the heavy burdens carried by those who seek justice.\n\nEvery New Movie on Netflix in April 2024"
