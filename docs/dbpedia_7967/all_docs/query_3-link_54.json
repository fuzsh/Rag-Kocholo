        "text": "Superhero films have taken over the cinema industry in recent years. As of recently, there is at least one superhero film every year that everyone talks about. This year, that film is The Batman. The movie has been critically acclaimed by numerous companies and moviegoers alike.\n\nThe Batman is unlike most other superhero films in that it has an aspect of mystery tied to it. This allows a fresh take on the formula for this type of movie, since most don’t really have a sense of mystery for the entirety of the film like The Batman does. What makes it an exceptional film is that we the viewers are solving the mystery along with Batman; we don’t know what the answers are until Batman does. The mystery behind the film is the identity of the Riddler, a villain that is killing people in a similar fashion to the Zodiac Killer. He even creates coded messages like the infamous killer from the 1960’s. Batman spends the movie attempting to crack the codes created by the Riddler before he executes his final destructive plan.\n\nThe movie also has phenomenal cinematography, music and acting. Without giving away too much, there is a beautiful car chase scene with popping colors contrasting with the dark night (No, not the Dark Knight, although he is there too). There are numerous other scenes whose camera shots are unique and original. Batman’s theme is top-notch—I am so glad I got to hear it again and again throughout the movie. Although the sound of it may sound redundant, they kept the theme fresh by using different instruments every time it was played. Might I add that it is an epic theme that they saved for the most extravagant moments of the film. Beyond this, the acting is far better than I anticipated. Robert Pattinson does a wonderful job revealing to us viewers the emotionally vulnerable side of Batman that is rarely shown off. However, despite the character’s vulnerability, Pattinson flaunts Batman’s power by intimidating other characters as well. Sometimes, all it took was Batman’s signal in the sky to send criminals home! Jeffrey Wright excellently plays Commissioner James Gordon. Zoë Kravits and Paul Dano play their respective roles very well, too."
