        "text": "A perfect complement to Oppenheimer, this engrossing period thriller fuses Cold War politics with medical history as the Yugoslav team trying to create nuclear fission are accidentally irradiated and smuggled to France for treatment. It’s 1958, and star Serbian physicist Dragoslav Popovic (Radivoje ’Rasa’ Bukvic) is supposedly working on a program to find new energy sources for Yugoslavia. But in truth, the secret parallel goal is to develop nuclear-weapons capability for the socialist state. Meanwhile, in France, brilliant Professor Georges Mathé, an oncologist and immunologist at the Curie Institute hopes to find a cure for childhood leukemia through his experiment with transplants in mice. Mathé is the man the French government deems most likely to save the lives of Popovic and the three young physicists working with him. We also witness the heroism of the French locals willing to participate in a risky medical procedure: the first human bone marrow transplant. –Alissa Simon"
