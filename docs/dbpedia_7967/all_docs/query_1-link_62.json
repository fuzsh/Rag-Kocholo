        "text": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – “Who said anything about safe?”\n\nBrad Pitt gets into a Formula One racecar in the first teaser trailer for “F1,” which dropped this week.\n\nPitt stars as a veteran driver pulled out of retirement to work with a Formula 1 team and its young driver. Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem and Damson Idris also star.\n\nAlso getting a starring role is the world center of racing, the Daytona International Speedway. Pitt shot racing scenes at Daytona during the Rolex 24 back in January.\n\nOther Volusia County businesses can also be spotted in the movie. Pappas Drive-In and Family Restaurant in New Smyrna Beach was used for some scenes. In March, a fire destroyed the historic building. The owner, Vic Ganoe, told News 6 in May that he hoped to be back open by the time “F1″ premieres.\n\nJerry Bruckheimer, who also produced “Days of Thunder,” another racing movie shot in Daytona Beach, is making the film.\n\n“F1″ was produced by Apple Studios and Warner Bros. Pictures International, and is expected to open on movie screens on June 27, 2025."
