        "text": "You’d be hard-pressed to find a film with more hype right now than the Formula 1 film from director Joseph Kosinski titled “F1.” Not only does the film boast star power like Brad Pitt leading the way, but it’s also the first film from Kosinski since he directed “Top Gun: Maverick,” and we all know how well that worked out for him. But after months of hype, we finally got our first look at the film.\n\nFrom Apple Original Films and distributed by Warner Bros, “F1” stars Academy Award winner Brad Pitt as a former driver who returns to Formula 1, alongside Damson Idris as his teammate at APXGP, a fictional team on the grid.\n\nREAD MORE: 12 Films To See In July: ‘Twisters,’ ‘Longlegs’ ‘MaXXXine’ & More\n\nAs seen in the trailer, “F1” is a movie all about speed. It follows the sport of Formula 1 racing, which has seen an enormous surge in popularity over the past couple of years. Thanks to docuseries like Netflix’s “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” and the “F1” videogame series, the sport has gained a number of new fans. This is seemingly the perfect time for a big-budget F1 movie to be released.\n\nAnd a big budget is right. The film is rumored to have ballooned in cost to upwards of $300 million. Let’s not forget that Apple paid between $130 million and $140 million to have the pleasure of producing the film. Needless to say, this one will have to have a big run theatrically if Apple hopes to recoup some of those costs.\n\nThe star-studded cast also includes Academy Award nominee Kerry Condon, Academy Award winner Javier Bardem, Emmy Award winner Tobias Menzies, Emmy Award nominee Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo.\n\n“F1” will be released on June 27, 2025. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nJoseph Kosinski (“Top Gun: Maverick”) directs and produces the feature alongside Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman of Jerry Bruckheimer Films; Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner for Plan B Entertainment; and Lewis Hamilton under his Dawn Apollo Films banner. The film is made in collaboration with Formula 1® and the F1 community, including the 10 F1 teams and their drivers, the FIA, and race promoters. Copper CEO Penni Thow serves as executive producer.\n\n“F1” will be distributed in theaters around the world and in IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures, opening only in theaters in North America on June 27, 2025, and internationally beginning on 25 June 2025. Made in collaboration with Formula 1, the new film is immersed in the exhilarating and cinematic world of F1, as filming takes place at races on the sport’s calendar."
