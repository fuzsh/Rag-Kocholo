        "text": "As we near the end of 2023 and I finalize this list, I’ll admit that I had trouble extrapolating sweeping narratives about the year in film. Maybe it’s all the time I’ve spent in French courtrooms, where defendants have convincingly argued against any notion of rational truth. Or maybe 2023 has simply been a year full of contradictory narratives. For instance, though it’s felt like Hollywood finally returned to its pre-pandemic form this year, it looks as though we’ll end 2023 with just over half the total releases of 2019 (and 70 percent of that year’s total box office).\n\nMeanwhile, all the chatter about superhero fatigue didn’t preclude several big superhero successes. And where the Barbenheimer phenomenon made it seem as though movies reached peak pervasiveness this year, in other ways 2023 was clearly defined by absence—with theaters shuttering, tentpoles being punted, and writers and actors manning the picket lines rather than promoting films. There was a palpable sense of enthusiasm around movies, but also a justified sense of dread, and as many pleasant surprises as hyped disappointments. You know, best of times, worst of times.\n\nIn terms of what was actually on the screen, a few themes and trends leapt out. This year, evil was banal, wives were foregrounded, and penises were all over the damn place. There were a lot of ambitious biopics that bucked the usual formula; there were too many thinly veiled brand advertisements; and while there was only one May December, there were several films with May-December romances at their center.\n\nOn the whole, it was a great year for established auteurs leaning into their strengths: David Fincher made a taut thriller, Sofia Coppola crafted a lush drama about “privilege without power,” Martin Scorsese reunited with his two favorite actors for a three-hour epic about crime and betrayal, and so on and so forth. But there were plenty of thrilling debuts, too. I am officially in the bag for A.V. Rockwell, Alice Diop, and Ellie Foumbi. I was taken with what a rising crop of indie filmmakers did with miniscule budgets, and encouraged to see several established phenoms use their blank checks for wild, audacious swings."
