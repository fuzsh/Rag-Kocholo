Films I cut premiered at Sundance, SXSW, Cannes, and played theatrically across the nation. I worked as Supervising Editor on several TV shows on networks like Bravo, E!, and Fox. I was the Go-To Editor for companies like Fremantle Media (American Idol) and cut pilots for them for more than five years. My YouTube Channel 'This Guy Edits' has over 475k subscribers and focuses on creative storytelling and editing. I taught Film Editing at Columbia College Hollywood, and I am a regular guest lecturer at the UCLA Film Extension. I now designed this course where I teach you everything I know about becoming a Go-To Editor."
