        "text": "On Tuesday, Apple Original Films announced that its highly anticipated Formula 1 feature film starring Brad Pitt and hailing from director Joseph Kosinski, Jerry Bruckheimer Films, Plan B Entertainment, and seven-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton’s Dawn Apollo Films banner, will be distributed in theaters around the world and in IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America on June 27, 2025, and internationally beginning June 25, 2025. Made in collaboration with Formula 1, the new film is immersed in the exhilarating and cinematic world of F1®, as filming takes place at races on the sport’s calendar.\n\nStarring Brad Pitt as a former driver who returns to Formula 1, alongside Damson Idris as his teammate at APXGP, a fictional team on the grid, the feature has been shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competes against the titans of the sport. The star-studded cast also includes Academy Award nominee Kerry Condon, Academy Award winner Javier Bardem, Emmy Award winner and Golden Globe Award nominee Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo.\n\nKosinski (“Top Gun: Maverick”) directs and produces the feature alongside Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman of Jerry Bruckheimer Films; Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner for Plan B Entertainment; and Hamilton under his Dawn Apollo Films banner. The film is made in collaboration with Formula 1® and the F1 community, including the 10 F1 teams and their drivers, the FIA and race promoters. Academy Award nominee Ehren Kruger (“Top Gun: Maverick”) writes the screenplay. Copper CEO Penni Thow serves as executive producer.\n\nThe wide theatrical release will also include IMAX theaters. The crystal-clear images, coupled with IMAX’s customized theater geometry and powerful digital audio, create a unique environment that will make audiences feel as if they are in the movie.\n\nAbout Apple Original Films\n\nMomentum around the Apple Original Films slate continues to grow since the debut of Apple TV+ four years ago.
