        "text": "All of that squabbling over H.264 may be rendered moot in the near future. The Motion Picture Experts Group (better known as MPEG) has just let us know that it was quietly drafting a new video standard while everyone was onsummer vacation last month: H.265, also called High Efficiency Video Coding, promises to squeeze video sizes with double the efficiency of H.264. As you might imagine, this could lead either to a much smaller video footprint for bandwidth-starved mobile users or a hike to image quality with the same size as before. Imagine fast-loading HD streaming on 4G, or cable TV without all the excess compression, and you’ve got the idea. Ericsson Research visual technology lead Per Fröjdh anticipates H.265 coming as soon as 2013, when our smartphones and tablets are most likely to play it first. TV and other areas might have to wait, although Fröjdh is offering a consolation prize — he’s teasing a separate MPEG project that could give us glasses-free, compressed 3D video as a standard by 2014.\n\nOrigin: http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/15/mpeg-drafts-twice-as-efficient-h-265-video-standard/\n\nToday I happened to see my very first post on hydrogenaudio.org telling people that I have made a audio transcoder software. My little piece of software, which I named MediaCoder later, turned out to be popular on the forum for a while. It was that good beginning kept me working continuously on the same software for nearly 7 years!\n\nI also found a really long web page which archieved all my changelogs through the years which I myself didn’t do.\n\nJust want to say thank you to all the people supporting me!"
