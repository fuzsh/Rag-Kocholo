        "text": "2009-06-11 02:00:14\n\nHi all,\n\nI'm transcoding my MP3 files to .aac files to play on my Nokia 5320 XpressMusic\n\nYes, I am aware that transcoding will reduce quality. I'm just aiming for a smaller file size to fit more songs into my phone.\n\nNow, I use MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399 for the Transcoding. I choose CT AAC+ encoder. Next, I choose 96 kbps. Then, I'm stumped:\n\nWhich version to use? AAC+ Ver 1 or AAC+ Ver 2 ?\n\nWhich standard to use, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4?\n\nPlease help me... I've been searching high and low for the recommended settings to no avail.\n\n(And, perhaps also consider the quirkiness -- if any -- of Nokia 5320 XpressMusic's Music Player app)\n\nThanks beforehand.\n\nNobody is Perfect.\n\nI am Nobody.\n\nhttp://pandu.poluan.info\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #1 – 2009-06-11 02:01:48\n\nJust in case anyone wondered... I've tried all four combinations (MPEG-2 v1, MPEG-2 v2, MPEG-4 v1, MPEG-4 v2), and though I may be imagining it (has no way to perform ABX on my phone), MPEG-4 v2 variant seems more \"springy\" (better treble)...\n\nBut then again, I may be imagining it... so...\n\nNobody is Perfect.\n\nI am Nobody.\n\nhttp://pandu.poluan.info\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #2 – 2009-06-11 03:24:52\n\nWell, at that bitrate, I would go with LC-AAC instead of AAC+/HE-AAC. I believe that HE-AAC really excels at the 32-64kbps range and that LC-AAC should be used for bitrates of 96kbps and above. I am curious as to why you are using MediaCoder when there are plenty of free applications out there that use the Nero AAC encoder (it is more heavily tested here). You wouldn't have to worry about which version (v1 or v2) when using Nero and instead focus on a quality setting (around -q0.30) for VBR encoding.\n\nI may be wrong on this part but, from what I remember, HE-AACv1 should be used for 32-40kbps encoding and HE-AACv2 should be used for 48-64kbps encoding (those might be switched though). Additionally, I would go with mpeg-4 AAC files instead of mpeg-2 AAC files. Again, you wouldn't have to worry about this when using the Nero AAC encoder. foobar2000 is a free application that can transcode your lossy files using Nero's AAC encoder.\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #3 – 2009-06-11 14:23:21\n\nI am curious as to why you are using MediaCoder when there are plenty of free applications out there that use the Nero AAC encoder (it is more heavily tested here).\n\nTo clarify: MediaCoder is free, and does use the Nero encoder. See here.\n\n\"Lifting Shadows Off a Dream\"\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #4 – 2009-06-11 15:46:38\n\nIIRC, 5320XM has very similar hardware spec as 6120 classic, except the OS is newer (S60v3 FP2), and has a Nseries-like interface for the music player. As far as I know, AAC support in Nokia S60v3/FP1/FP2 has no major known issues. I tried a few Nero-encoded AAC ringtones in MP4 format in the past and they all played fine.\n\nI would recommend you to use Nero AAC with foobar2000. At least for me, this combination is far easier to use, and use far less system resources than MediaCoder. MediaCoder is bloated, slow, non-unicode compliant, needs Firefox or XULrunner for full functionality, and I somehow don't really like the interface.\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #5 – 2009-06-11 17:49:35\n\nGuys, thanks for the replies. I know I can always count on Hydrogenaudio for nitty-gritty answers re: digital audio\n\nIt's been quite some while since I last posted here, and I can see HA's quality for technical stuffs is still second to none\n\nIIRC, 5320XM has very similar hardware spec as 6120 classic, except the OS is newer (S60v3 FP2), and has a Nseries-like interface for the music player.

Thanks, William!\n\nA bit spelunking on fb2k's AAC encoding interface indeed shows that with \"Target Quality\" mode set to -q0.30 -- as suggested by kornchild2002 -- I can get approximately 82 kbps, even lower than what I got with MediaCoder, yay!\n\nAs to your comment on MediaCoder: I agree...

See here.\n\nInteresting, thanks for further clarifying that. The use of 96kbps CBR, instead of -q values, made it appear that it wasn't using Nero's AAC encoder.\n\npepoluan, you can even go lower if you want. foobar2000 has the ability to conduct a blind ABX test, you don't have to use your headphones. Simply use the headphones that you would normally hookup to your cellphone. I suggest trying various low -q values and then conduct a few ABX tests. You may find out that a lower -q value produces the same audible results as a -q0.3. I don't know how strapped you are for space on your cellphone but a difference of 0.25MB per song could mean a lot with 1-4GB of storage.\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #7 – 2009-06-11 18:31:32\n\nTo clarify: MediaCoder is free, and does use the Nero encoder.

Plus they include the Nero encoder without a license from Nero (i.e. they steal it), same for RealMedia codecs and some others.\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #8 – 2009-06-11 18:36:00\n\nMediaCoder illegally redistributes the Nero AAC encoder.

I mean you could ask download sites and SourceForge to take it down under the DMCA. Or ask magazines like Chip or c't to not promote it in their articles.\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #10 – 2009-06-11 18:43:19\n\nComplaint to SF has been sent.

By clicking on the \"Next\" or \"Install\" button below, you agree that OpenCandy may collect and use certain information obtained in connection with this software installation in accordance with the policies and practices set forth in OpenCandy's Privacy Policy, which can be read at http://www.opencandy.com/privacy-policy/.\n\nThis is presented at the very end of the EULA which most people won't read anyways. There is no option to install MediaCoder without OpenCandy.\n\nThe OpenCandy privacy policy mentioned in the license is quite vague about what they will do. It definitely says that they will scan your system for installed software and collect various other information about your location and your PC, however.\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #13 – 2009-06-12 07:30:02\n\nThat is definitely the performance of spyware.

It is a really nice little phone that doubles as a DAP. It's small, light and works well as an audio player.\n\nIndeed I enjoyed it very much\n\nNot to mention the respectable Internet performance at 3.6 Mbps HSDPA -- provided I got a satisfactory 3.5G signal, of course. But even without HSDPA, I can still drop down to EDGE and even GPRS speeds, and browse the Internet quite satisfactorily.\n\nOnly one thing still wanting: The battery life sucks I ended up bringing 2 spare batteries and a charger everywhere I go.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nUh, sorry for the OOT posting...\n\nBack to something relevant to the topic:\n\nI uninstalled MediaCoder. Will that also remove the OpenCandy spyware? NOD32 is not complaining though.\n\nNobody is Perfect.\n\nI am Nobody.\n\nhttp://pandu.poluan.info\n\nConfused with all AAC settings in MediaCoder 0.7.0.4399\n\nReply #16 – 2009-06-13 21:25:04\n\nI uninstalled MediaCoder.

However, OpenCandy is called one last time during the uninstallation process so it would have been better to manually delete the OpenCandy DLL before uninstalling MediaCoder."
