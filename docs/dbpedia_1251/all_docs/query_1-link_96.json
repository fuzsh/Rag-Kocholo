        "text": "Mediacoder is a GUI for a variety of back-end source encoders including MEncoder, (sibling of MPlayer) not just FFMPEG. See screen grab which lists them all. I had both the \"source\" selection and \"encoder\" set to \"auto-select\" when I did the .mts re-wrap to mp4. So, it is possible that it did not use FFMPEG to do the re-wrap.\n\nNote in the above screen grab that I have chosen \"manual select\" for the source--this is only to show the drop down menu that reveals the whole range used by Mediacoder. However, when doing MTS re-wrap, both \"encoder\" and \"source\" were set to \"auto-select\". See the pdf file in my earlier post.\n\nAn advantage of Mediacoder is that it installs all the back-end audio and video encoders it needs itself. There is no need to install them separately.\n\nSo this may be the Swiss army knife we have been looking for. Did you manage to get the sound sorted out for AVCHD or are you still using Audacity?\n\nalso I have been wondering what is a good HD codec that LW can play to standardize on. Uncompressed HD is one way to go but I imagine it uses massive amounts of diskspace. Is there another format that provides a good space/quality compromise. I notice that Standard Prores seems to use around 4 times that of HDV so something using this amount of storage may be worth aiming for.\n\nIt would also be good if it played on a dual core box.\n\nBen\n\nOK, I think I have found the right audio settings in Mediacoder to convert from .mts to .mp4 with 5.1 surround AC-3 audio transcoded to 5.1 surround sound AAC. The video is re-wrapped (not transcoded). The resulting file plays in VLC with both picture and sound OK. LW imports both video and all 6 surround sound audio tracks at the same time from the mp4 file thus eliminating the need to use Audacity.\n\nI have done another pdf file showing the settings for all the relevant Mediacoder tabs.\n\nThe only weird thing is that the video frame rate is mysteriously changed from 25 fps to 50 fps even though \"copy video\" is selected on the video tab and \"original\" frame rate is selected on the picture tab. I don't understand why this happens.\n\nThese are the steps.\n\n1. import the mts file into Medicoder.\n\n2. on the video tab select \"copy video\" and \"auto select\" for both encoder and source.\n\n3. On the picture tab select \"original\" for frame rate and \"keep display AR\" in the aspect ratio drop down menu.\n\n4. On the audio tab:\n\na) select \"LC-AAC\" in format drop down menu\n\nb) select \"FAAC\" in encoder drop down menu.\n\nc) In the source drop down menu, select \"MEncoder\".\n\nd) Make sure \"copy audio\" is deselected.\n\ne) On the right hand side click the FAAC tab and select \"mp4\" for both the MPEG version radio button and the container drop down menu.\n\n5. On the container tab select MP4.\n\n6. On the sound tab in the channels drop down menu select \"original\"\n\n7. Hit the start button.\n\nAn mp4 file is created very quickly that plays in VLC with both and sound OK.\n\nPlayback in LW\n\nThe imported footage does not play smoothly in LW but as drkuli pointed out in another thread this is very possibly down to LW's current problems with long GOP. Greg_E's winter road file played back in much the same way. Improved handling of long GOP is on the Lightworks roadmap\n\nIn the meantime, if you want the footage to play smoothly in LW, import the mp4 with Lightworks' transcode function using MPEG I-frame HD/AVI. There is a bitrate choice of 50 MB-250 MB. If you are importing from an external USB drive best use 50 MB bitrate as Greg_E suggests in an earlier post.\n\nKeep the mp4 file for future use when LW's handling of long GOP is improved.\n\nView attachment mts2mp4_2011-04-14.pdf\n\nSomething else that is strange. Mediainfo reveals that the original MTS file is 1920 x 1080 interlaced. It also shows that the mp4 created by Mediacoder is also 1920 x 1080 interlaced. See below. However, the import tool in LW displays the mp4 file as \"HD 1080p\" (see screen grab below).\n\nOriginal MTS file Mediainfo analysis\n\nGeneral\n\nID : 0 (0x0)\n\nComplete name : C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\Tom drinking milk_00001.MTS\n\nFormat : BDAV\n\nFormat/Info : Blu-ray Video\n\nFile size : 326 MiB\n\nDuration : 2mn 37s\n\nOverall bit rate : 17.3 Mbps\n\nMaximum Overall bit rate : 18.0 Mbps\n\nVideo\n\nID : 4113 (0x1011)\n\nMenu ID : 1 (0x1)\n\nFormat : AVC\n\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n\nFormat profile : High@L4.0\n\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\n\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 2 frames\n\nFormat settings, GOP : M=1, N=26\n\nCodec ID : 27\n\nDuration : 2mn 38s\n\nBit rate mode : Variable\n\nBit rate : 16.2 Mbps\n\nMaximum bit rate : 16.0 Mbps\n\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\n\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\n\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\n\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nColor space : YUV\n\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\n\nBit depth : 8 bits\n\nScan type : Interlaced\n\nScan order : Top Field First\n\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.312\n\nStream size : 305 MiB (93%)\n\nAudio\n\nID : 4352 (0x1100)\n\nMenu ID : 1 (0x1)\n\nFormat : AC-3\n\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\n\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\n\nCodec ID : 129\n\nDuration : 2mn 38s\n\nBit rate mode : Constant\n\nBit rate : 448 Kbps\n\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\n\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nBit depth : 16 bits\n\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\nDelay relative to video : -80ms\n\nStream size : 8.44 MiB (3%)\n\nText\n\nID : 4608 (0x1200)\n\nMenu ID : 1 (0x1)\n\nFormat : PGS\n\nCodec ID : 144\n\nDuration : 2mn 37s\n\nDelay relative to video : -80ms\n\nMP4 created by Mediacoder Mediainfo analysis\n\nGeneral\n\nComplete name : C:\\Users\\username\\Desktop\\Tom drinking milk_00001.mp4\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\n\nFormat profile : Base Media\n\nCodec ID : isom\n\nFile size : 308 MiB\n\nDuration : 2mn 38s\n\nOverall bit rate : 16.3 Mbps\n\nWriting application : Lavf52.61.0\n\nVideo\n\nID : 1\n\nFormat : AVC\n\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\n\nFormat profile : High@L4.0\n\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\n\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 2 frames\n\nFormat settings, GOP : M=1, N=26\n\nCodec ID : avc1\n\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\n\nDuration : 2mn 38s\n\nBit rate mode : Variable\n\nBit rate : 15.9 Mbps\n\nMaximum bit rate : 16.0 Mbps\n\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\n\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\n\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\n\nFrame rate mode : Constant\n\nFrame rate : 50.000 fps\n\nOriginal frame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nColor space : YUV\n\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\n\nBit depth : 8 bits\n\nScan type : Interlaced\n\nScan order : Top Field First\n\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.154\n\nStream size : 300 MiB (98%)\n\nAudio\n\nID : 2\n\nFormat : AAC\n\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\n\nFormat profile : LC\n\nCodec ID : 40\n\nDuration : 2mn 38s\n\nBit rate mode : Variable\n\nBit rate : 372 Kbps\n\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\n\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\nStream size : 7.01 MiB (2%)\n\nLanguage : English\n\nMediacoder seems to play XDCam EX files but I can't seem to get a file exported for testing in Lightworks, have to do more digging. Also Mediacoder seems to support the VFW codecs that we need to install to make Lightworks operate, it might be worth while to export directly into one of those codecs to allow Lightworks to handle the files. Again I am using words like \"seems to\" because I have not been able to prove these points.\n\nDo you mean use Mediacoder to transcode directly to MPEG I-frame HD/AVI rather than AVC/MP4? It would be good to be able to do both. One day in the near future LW will be able to handle long GOP better--it is on the roadmap. But in the meantime, it might be more pragmatic to transcode to MPEG I-frame HD. I see that Mediacoder has an option to use system codecs which presumably will include the Matrox VfW.\n\nThe Mpeg at 100mbps should be a pretty decent codec to use, just keep in mind that on many USB connected disks this is about all the speed you are going to get from them (12.x MBps) so that would be single stream of playback. Mpeg at 50mbps might be a better choice for some people.\n\nOK, I guess 100mbps is fairly similar to ProRes but I thought 50mbps was acceptable to BBC so is it not a bit OTT. I guess my thing is I am talking about TV and corporate not high end (i.e. Film). BTW is Mpeg 100mbps 10bit colour depth (is it mpeg 1,2,3,4? Ime not exactly a hard core techie when it comes to codecs).\n\nOK, I think I have found the right audio settings in Mediacoder to convert from .mts to .mp4 with 5.1 surround AC-3 audio transcoded to 5.1 surround sound AAC. The video re-wrapped. The resulting file plays in VLC with both picture and sound OK. LW imports both video and all 6 surround sound audio tracks into LW at the same time from the mp4 file thus eliminating the need to use Audacity.\n\nWow is it always 5.1? I generally don't use the internal microphone. I generally plug in a mono microphone for most things. Does LW even handle 5.1?\n\nOK, I think I have found the right audio settings in Mediacoder to convert from .mts to .mp4 with 5.1 surround AC-3 audio transcoded to 5.1 surround sound AAC.

Does LW even handle 5.1?\n\nWell, LW appears to be able to import and extract 6 tracks of audio from a single mp4 file and so I am guessing it does support 5.1. LW was originally designed for film editing and feature films, for example, do sometimes use surround sound."
