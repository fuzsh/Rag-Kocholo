With many extra features and a expandable architecture, MediaCoder is more than a GUI of a bunch of command line tools.\n\nHome Page-\n\n<!-- m -->http://mediacoder.so...e.net/index.htm<!-- m -->\n\nCommand-Line Interface-\n\n<!-- m -->http://mediacoder.so... ... ne_options<!-- m -->\n\nBack to top"
