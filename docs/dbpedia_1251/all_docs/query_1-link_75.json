I get no sound when I play a video, I've tried a lot of stuff, nothing yields a working file.\n\nCodec packs, KLite Mega, CCCP\n\nTried players, GOM, VLC, WMP 10, 11, WMP classic\n\nTried converters, MMConvert, Mediacoder\n\nOther videos are fine, and I've tried it on multiple computers, so it's definitely the file. I have many files like this and all were collected the same, suggesting an encoding issue/quirk. The kicker is, I had it working at some point in VLC, then the other day it up and stopped working. I don't know what changed, nor how to get it working again. I'd like to get to the bottom of it with some help from the helpful people here, to improve my understanding of such issues.\n\nIt says WMA v2 codec, which is common I would imagine. My only guess is that something happened during the encoding process that led to this issue, but knowing that I had it working, I'd like to determine how. Is there anything strange about the info below?\n\nHere is the information from mediacoder."
