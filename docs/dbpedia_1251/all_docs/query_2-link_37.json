        "text": "Video encoding is the process of converting a video file from one format to another, usually to make the file smaller in size or to make it compatible with different devices or platforms. It's like compressing a large file into a smaller package so that it can be easily stored, transmitted, or played back on various devices.\n\nOur Support Team may ask you to re-encode your video content in the following circumstances:\n\nSome additional benefits that come with re-encoding your video content include:\n\nPlayback issues such as flickering, stuttering, freezing, black screen, skipped assets, or poor transitions between assets can often result from poorly encoded video content. In such a situation, it is highly recommended that you re-encode your video content to align more closely with the performance capabilities of the Signagelive Player type you are running.\n\nMore often than not, file encoding is one of the earliest troubleshooting steps taken by our Support Team when attempting to address playback issues for our Customers.\n\nTo re-encode your video content, you'll first need to acquire media transcoding software; we recommend using MediaCoder (which you can download by clicking here). You'll also need a copy of the original video content you wish to re-encode. Once you have this, please follow our detailed steps provided here to begin encoding your content within Media Coder.\n\nTo encode your media assets within MediaCoder, please carry out the following steps:\n\nYou will need to run through the following tabs in the Mediacoder Software to configure your settings:\n\nOn the Video Tab to configure video quality performance:\n\nOn the Audio Tab to configure audio performance:\n\nOn the Container Tab to configure the video codec\n\nOn the Picture Tab to configure the video size and frame rate\n\nTo begin the encode, please click 'Startâ€™ at the top of MediaCoder. This will begin the encoding process based on the settings set above and the files will begin encoding. Once complete a notification will appear to confirm the overall encoding size difference regarding your chosen files.\n\nCongratulations! You have just successfully encoded your file. You can now upload the encoded video file(s) to your Signagelive Network.\n\nYes you can! If your display does not support the Native Portrait feature (see supported features and media types article here for further information), you must rotate your content before using it in a Playlist or on your Player.\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nWhen working through your encoding settings, if you wish to rotate the video, then just apply the settings above in accordance with the other settings you have made.\n\nThere are no specific encoding settings for Samsung devices. However, please note that Tizen models will not support videos with Frames per Second (FPS) over 30. If your videos are using even 30.01 frames per second, then this video will fail to play. We recommend always keeping your frames per second below 30 and using a rounded number with no decimal places. This is recommended as a good encoding practice directly from Samsung.\n\nThis is the official support table for 4K video on Tizen from Samsung:\n\nWe have seen playback issues with certain content files for 4K playback with Samsung Tizen, so our encoding recommendation is as follows:\n\nWhen publishing content to the LG webOS Media Players, LG recommends that all of your video encoding is exactly the same across all video files for best performance.\n\nPlease check the official recommended settings for Brightsign players on the Brightsign Support page.\n\nIf you are encoding for an IAdea 4K Player then we have found the following encoding settings to work best when deploying full screen landscape content, if you are encoding for a portrait or different resolution screen, you can amend the resolution accordingly:\n\nIf you are encoding for any of those IAdea models listed above, then we have found the following encoding settings to work best when deploying full screen landscape content, if you are encoding for a portrait or different resolution screen, you can amend the resolution accordingly:\n\nTo save you time, we've created a series of preset files for some players. Loading them into MediaCoder will automatically set the relevant settings. You can use these by downloading them from the bottom of this article, loading MediaCoder, and using the File Menu to select Load Preset.\n\nHere are the presets we've added to this article for you:"
