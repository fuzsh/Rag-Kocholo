You'll often find your answer more quickly than it will take somebody to respond.\n\nwe need portable SUPER v 2010. Please add it.\n\nSUPER is an easy-to-use Multimedia Encoder and Player, requiring only one simple click.\n\nIf you need a simple, yet very efficient tool to convert or play any Multimedia file, without reading manuals or spending long hours training, then SUPER is all you need.\n\nSUPER supports any Multimedia file format. SUPER plays files that cannot be played with WMP or even other libavcodec-based players like MPC and VLC. SUPER also plays and saves Internet Media Streams of different protocols (mms://, rtsp://, and http://).\n\nSUPER is the fastest and simplest tool to encode full-length movies to any other format without any time or function limitation. It does NOT require any additional external codecs. They're all built in!"
