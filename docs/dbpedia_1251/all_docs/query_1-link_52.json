The CPU usage can never exceeds 50%. Currently audio transcoding is done with 2 threads, 1 for decoding and 1 for encoding, though this can still not achieve 100% CPU usage, as decoding and encoding is 1:5 in CPU power consumption. The video transcoding is done with single thread (by MEncoder). If the new Xvid library can support dual thread mode, then encoding xvid videos with MediaCoder will be simply faster on dual-core CPUs, but the rest video codecs will still not. As I'm not developing codecs, an approach I can think of is to divide video decodng and encoding into 2 threads. To achieve this without modifying too much on MEncoder, I may use MPlayer to do decoding in one thread/process and get frames from it and send to MEncoder who is working in another thread/process.\n\nMediaCoder the transcoder\n\nhttp://mediacoder.sourceforge.net\n\nBatch transcoding to HE-AAC-PS with this tool\n\nReply #582 – 2006-03-18 02:48:14\n\nQuote\n\nstill no success:\n\nCode: [Select]\n\n------ Build started: Project: FloatFRlib, Configuration: CT Release Win32 ------\n\nCompiling...\n\ntranscendent.c\n\nc1 : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: '.\\src\\transcendent.c': No such file or directory\n\ncfftn.c\n\nc1 : fatal error C1083: Cannot open source file: '.\\src\\cfftn.c': No such file or directory\n\nBuild log was saved at \"file://e:\\Programming\\C\\MEnc\\mediacoder\\aacPlusenc\\FloatFRlib\\Win32_O\\CT\\obj\\BuildLog.htm\"\n\nFloatFRlib - 2 error(s), 0 warning(s)\n\n[a href=\"index.php?act=findpost&pid=372111\"][{POST_SNAPBACK}][/a]\n\nI'm sorry I just forgot add these 2 files into CVS.\n\nUpdate your code from CVS and you will get them.\n\nMediaCoder the transcoder\n\nhttp://mediacoder.sourceforge.net\n\nBatch transcoding to HE-AAC-PS with this tool\n\nReply #583 – 2006-03-18 10:50:02\n\nWhat are the correct settings for optimizing QuickTime compatible MPEG-4 output using MediaCoder?\n\nI am interested in utilizing the H.264 codec.

I have two open source programs myself, and I love to see others who help the open source cause. At the same time, I know what a hassle it can be to constantly support them, so I tried as hard as I could to figure this out without involving you. I just don't understand the lingo- so if you help me with this I'd be glad to donate a few bucks. All I am trying to do is convert an MOV file into an mpeg or avi, or anything that is smaller and will still keep the audio and video quality reasonable. I have the file added into the program, but I have no idea what to do from there. Can you help me?\n\nBatch transcoding to HE-AAC-PS with this tool\n\nReply #591 – 2006-03-23 15:22:14\n\nHi Optimus!\n\nFirst of all, respect (one of many other, i know:) to you for your amazing soft!\n\nCould i suggest to add some new options/to improve existing ones?\n\n1. When I open a window names “show file details” by F8 key, I cannot close it by pressing Enter or Esc. Also i cannot… how can I say… to switch a focus between those two buttons by arrow keys. So I have to use mouse which is not convenient in all cases. And there is still not clear if it is a IDv1 or IDv2 tag. I know about difficult with that but can you just indicate, what information (IDv1 or IDv2) displays when F8 pressed.\n\n2. As mr. dimzon says, at the “file’s names table” I can see columns with file’s names, types, full path etc. but NOT their bitrate. It may be convenient – to see bitrate at a separate column for all files simultaneously AND to sort files by bitrate by clicking to the header of such a column. So, you can add to the table all your music collection, sort it by bitrate, delete for example all files lower than 128 kbps, and after it – to transcode others which are left in the table.\n\n3. Don’t you intend to integrate any help INTO the program?\n\n4. At the “video filters” – “scalling”, can you add a 320x240 mode? You know, a lot of pocket PC, such as iPAQs use this resolution. And also, can you copy this selection (a selection of output resolution) from the “deep dive settings” as somebody says in this topic, to the front panel (the “video” tab)? Also for viewing movies on a pocket PC while you’re traveling by a noisy plane usually it’s enough to have a sound bitrate about 20-24 kbps in mp3 but your soft has 32 kbps min, well, it’s not so important.\n\n5. I have such a task: I have a short wav-file with high sample frequency and need to transcode it to wav-file with 11025 Hz rate because some Siemens cellphones can play only this type of files. What should I do? I have found TWO places in your soft where I can set up the output sample frequency (both in a “audio filter” tab): “Shibatch Sample Rate Converter” and “Resampling”. Which one should be toggled? I tried to toggle the first one and the second one and both but program says that “is nothing to do”. And it does nothing.\n\nAnd among this. Sometimes I need to transcode mp3-files to wav-files with high frequency (to make an audio-CD from mp3s). Can you also copy that frequency switch to the front panel from the “deep” settings?\n\n6. I can see the estimated size of the output file DURING the transcoding. I know that it’s just an estimating but can I see it anyway BEFORE the process? In that case I can control if my current settings will make a file greater then the source file was. Otherwise I will know this fact after the process was started already.\n\n7. Actually I usually use the program POCKETDIVXENCODER v0.3.50 (http://divx.ppccool.com/) to transcode movies for viewing at pocket PC. And I advise you to think about including into you soft some options which are very convenient for users:\n\nWhen I intend to transcode a movie, I think a lot about what bitrate should I set to get a suitable quality and a minimal size. And POCKETDIVXENCODER allow to preview what a result will be with the bitrate I have set. It selects a short piece of file, 10-20 seconds long, transcode it within 1-2 minutes and displays a result. So, I can see it after 2 minutes instead of 2 hours transcoding time of the whole file. In your soft I have found a “preview transcoded file” option but it does nothing.\n\nAlso, in that program when I want to crop a frame, program shows me a frame and four sliders. I can move every slider and see in realtime what left/right/upper/downer part of frame will be cropped. It’s convenient. But if it is hard to do in your soft, can you add to the window where mplayer plays a file, two scales – at the right and upper side of a frame? Than I can at least approximately estimate what is the width in picsels of upper and downer black stripes on the frame.\n\nSorry for my English. I try to explain all I mean.\n\nBut. I just came to the forum but have read this entire topic before posting! To be sure that no one discussed the same things. Does many of participants do the same?\n\nRegards\n\nBatch transcoding to HE-AAC-PS with this tool\n\nReply #592 – 2006-03-23 18:41:17\n\nHi,\n\nI've tried using Medacoder to convert my collection of 2000 .ogg music I want to convert to MP4 for ipod use.\n\nWhen I added my music folder, the began listing the files went up to ~99 music files the GUI froze up (Not responding), Tag.exe was stopping and starting in the background.\n\nI tried moving half and then 3/4 of my music out of the directory.

Don't have too much free time these days...\n\nBut when I want to use it, I find bugs. I just want to convert some MP3s to AAC (using CT) and Mediacoder crashes when it encounters VBR MP3s (well, it seems that the common element was that these files are VBR ones). It crashes when using even MPlayer or Winamp plugins to decode.\n\nAnyway, still a wonderful tool!

I will, when having more free time (I'm cosidering to do SOHO in the future), try implementing them. The items I didn't quote is in such case.\n\nQuote\n\n3. Don’t you intend to integrate any help INTO the program?\n\nI really hope somebody else can help to write a help or how-to document. The developer of a software is never the best person to write user's document and I'm really not fond of and not good at writing user's document I'm afraid.\n\nQuote\n\n4. At the “video filters” – “scalling”, can you add a 320x240 mode? You know, a lot of pocket PC, such as iPAQs use this resolution. And also, can you copy this selection (a selection of output resolution) from the “deep dive settings” as somebody says in this topic, to the front panel (the “video” tab)? Also for viewing movies on a pocket PC while you’re traveling by a noisy plane usually it’s enough to have a sound bitrate about 20-24 kbps in mp3 but your soft has 32 kbps min, well, it’s not so important.\n\nI will surely do this.\n\nQuote\n\n5. I have such a task: I have a short wav-file with high sample frequency and need to transcode it to wav-file with 11025 Hz rate because some Siemens cellphones can play only this type of files. What should I do? I have found TWO places in your soft where I can set up the output sample frequency (both in a “audio filter” tab): “Shibatch Sample Rate Converter” and “Resampling”. Which one should be toggled? I tried to toggle the first one and the second one and both but program says that “is nothing to do”. And it does nothing.\n\nAnd among this. Sometimes I need to transcode mp3-files to wav-files with high frequency (to make an audio-CD from mp3s). Can you also copy that frequency switch to the front panel from the “deep” settings?\n\nI wll add some common audio settings to the front panel.\n\nTo do resample, I suggest you use MPlayer's resampling filter, instead of Shibatch's, though the latter has better quality, the integration of it is not very good. I'm trying to improve this.\n\nQuote\n\n6. I can see the estimated size of the output file DURING the transcoding. I know that it’s just an estimating but can I see it anyway BEFORE the process?

As this is really difficult to debug, as it happens after a quite long time. I guess there is a bug somewhere in the program.\n\nI think currently the best AAC encoder is CT's aacPlus encoder from Winamp 5.20, which MediaCoder supports, but not includes.\n\nEDIT: spell\n\nMediaCoder the transcoder\n\nhttp://mediacoder.sourceforge.net\n\nBatch transcoding to HE-AAC-PS with this tool\n\nReply #598 – 2006-03-24 05:16:42\n\nQuote\n\nHey Optimus,\n\nFirst off, let me say thanks for such an awesome open source program. I have two open source programs myself, and I love to see others who help the open source cause. At the same time, I know what a hassle it can be to constantly support them, so I tried as hard as I could to figure this out without involving you. I just don't understand the lingo- so if you help me with this I'd be glad to donate a few bucks. All I am trying to do is convert an MOV file into an mpeg or avi, or anything that is smaller and will still keep the audio and video quality reasonable. I have the file added into the program, but I have no idea what to do from there. Can you help me?\n\n[a href=\"index.php?act=findpost&pid=374126\"][{POST_SNAPBACK}][/a]\n\nFirst, please try selecting the file in the list and clicking Play button to see if your file can be played. If it does, Just leave all the settings default and it should do the work. You can adjust the video bit rate and audio quality to make your file smaller.\n\nMediaCoder the transcoder\n\nhttp://mediacoder.sourceforge.net"
