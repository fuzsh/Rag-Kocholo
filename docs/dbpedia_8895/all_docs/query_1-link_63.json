        "text": "Country music's popularity is at an all-time high.\n\nArtists including Shaboozey and Post Malone are offering catchy, ultra-modern takes on the genre, while Taylor Swift, Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen prove country darlings can become bona fide pop superstars.\n\nFrom Zach Bryan to Lainey Wilson to Chris Stapleton and beyond, the charts are increasingly populated with artists wearing press-stud shirts and singing twangy tales of woe.\n\nThis renaissance has allowed a bevy of exciting new artists to break through to the mainstream, the most recent being Alabama's The Red Clay Strays, who have just released their second album Made by These Moments.\n\nThe album comes at a key time for the band. They feature on the chart-dominating soundtrack to blockbuster disaster movie Twisters, they're about to head out on their first international tour, and earlier this year they even opened for The Rolling Stones.\n\nIt's a long way from their early shows as a cover band at The Hot Spot in Orange Beach on the American Gulf Coast.\n\n\"We weren't trying to be a cover band,\" dapper frontman Brandon Coleman recalls of those early shows.\n\n\"We'd book shows and I would turn around and be like, 'Hey, we're gonna play this song. Here are the chords, follow me for the changes. Keep up.' So, we never even played the covers the right way anyway. But that's just how we would play gigs.\n\n\"It'd be four-hour shows in a bar somewhere and we'd be trying our best to play covers while at the same time injecting our original music into the show.\"\n\nSoon enough the band focused entirely on original material and released their debut album, Moment of Truth, in 2022. It didn't have much impact initially, but over time the band were added to revered festivals including Lollapalooza and picked up by online tastemakers.\n\nSoon, their song 'Wondering Why' was everywhere, amassing hundreds of millions of streams across TikTok, Spotify, YouTube and more.\n\nIt's a swoon-worthy love song that treads the well-worn territory of love from different sides of the tracks:\n\nShe comes from silver spoon, golden rule, private school\n\nNever missed Sunday church\n\nAnd I come from blue collar, low dollar\n\nOut here where concrete meets old red dirt\n\nRed dirt is a common trope of modern country music and has recently become almost a genre unto itself.\n\n\"Red dirt is like country music made in Texas and Oklahoma,\" bassist Andrew Bishop explains.\n\n\"Our name is Red Clay… because we have red clay where we're from. We're not really red dirt country per se: We kind of consider ourselves more rock 'n' roll than anything.\"\n\nA more popular categorisation of country music in recent times is Americana, used to describe artists whose take on the country style leans more into roughshod rock than pop. The kind of music built for the warm crackle of vinyl as much as for mainstream radio.\n\n\"I'd say we are Americana. People say we're country, but I don't think we're country. I think we are rock 'n' roll or Americana, just because we are all these different versions of American music coming together to form whatever we are,\" Bishop says.\n\nSoul is another genre that describes the sound of The Red Clay Strays, thanks to both Coleman's vocal prowess and the influence of their hometown.\n\n\"In Alabama specifically, there's a lot of soulful singers that come out of the state, like Brandon. You've got people like Anderson East and Brittany Howard… a lot of these bands have that old Motown kind of in the music. Somehow it just keeps coming out of the state,\" Bishop says.\n\nWhile you'll still hear plenty of songs about trucks, drinking and living large in country music's biggest songs today, you'll get nothing like this from Made by These Moments.\n\n\"For me personally, and I think us as a band, there has to be some type of motivation behind the art that we make. It's definitely not trying to make a hit song that's commercially successful. We are 100 per cent just trying to express ourselves and just share our lives through our art as best as we can,\" Coleman says.\n\n\"We try to give our energy away as best as we can and help people relate if they need that in their lives. We wouldn't get that if we were just out there singing about something that has no connection to us whatsoever.\"\n\nThat sense of connection is something the band have been thinking about at this juncture of their careers. Now they've had a taste of success, their next step will help them capitalise on the what they've already built. A light-hearted song about getting loose might have guaranteed them some summer chart success in the US, but the band is chasing more than numbers.\n\n\"I think people are just craving something authentic in music in general,\" Coleman says.\n\n\"Maybe not even just in music, but just in art, whether it be movies or whatever it is, I think people are just craving realness, and authenticity. That kind of gets pushed away a lot of the time in order to achieve some type of commercial success.\n\n\"That may be successful for a while, but eventually people are going to get hungry for it and they're going to need real stuff to help with whatever they're going through. Help them feel seen or loved or hopeful or whatever it may be.\n\n\"When you can relate to a song, you feel seen. So, I think us singing about our personal lives and what we go through or whatever we're dealing with, when we put that in our music and it helps people relate.\"\n\nAustralia is not exempt from country music's mammoth moment, as ticket sales from the genre's megastars including Combs and Stapleton have proven. The Red Clay Band haven't been to Australia before – for the most part they've barely left their home state – but fans won't need to wait long to see them.\n\n\"Nothing's in concrete yet, but let's just say there's definitely a calendar for next year and there is a nice chunk of Australia somewhere in there,\" Bishop reveals, before confirming that the band had just picked up freshly minted passports for their first overseas trip this month.\n\n\"We're from Alabama. We'd be lucky to leave the state if we're not playing music. This UK trip coming up is going to be our first time out of the country.\"\n\nMade by These Moments is out now."
