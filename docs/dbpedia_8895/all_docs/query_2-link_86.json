On May 10, guest conductor Sarah Hicks returns for this boundary-breaking collaboration, Thunderpussy with the Seattle Symphony, in a performance set to shake the walls of Benaroya Hall. On this night, Thunderpussy will celebrate 10 remarkable years together by releasing their latest album, West, and performing it live in a special one-night-only show with the Symphony.\n\nThe powerhouse ‘70s-inspired rock band originally formed in Seattle and features vocalist Molly Sides, guitarist Whitney Petty, bassist Leah Julius and drummers Michelle Nuño and Lindsey Elias. Their 2018 debut album, Thunderpussy, captured the attention of rock fans everywhere, including Pearl Jam’s Mike McCready, who helped produce the band’s self-titled debut album.\n\nThis once-in-a-lifetime concert experience includes guest artists Brittany Davis, a blind musician, producer and engineer from Seattle, as well as featured dance performances choreographed by Alice Gosti (who works under the name MALACARNE), Amy J Lambert (who works under the name RicketySticks Dance-Theater) and Molly Sides, and costumes designed by Pakio Galore.\n\nA group of dancers will perform alongside the band and in the lobby throughout the evening: Aja Green, Anna Joswiak, Maggie Huang, Prasti Purdum, Ieva Braciulyte, Hannah Cavallaro, Maia Veague, Bridget Kirk, Gia Falzone and Symone Sanz. Additionally, guests can enjoy a DJ set in the lobby before, during intermission and after the concert by DJ SID3S, aka Joey Sides.\n\nThe evening's festivities will also include a Thunderpussy merch pop-up store featuring a Symphony-exclusive gold vinyl version of West, along with a photo gallery documenting 10 years of Thunderpussy's journey. This gallery, curated by Christine Mitchell and Sarah Craig, will be available for viewing and purchase. Additionally, two custom beverages crafted in collaboration with Future Primitive Brewing and Yonder Cider will be served, complete with labels designed by Seattle artists Shogo Ota and Rodrigo Valenzuela. To top it off, there will be a band meet-and-greet session with a record signing following the concert.\n\nTicket Information\n\nFor more information on tickets, visit or contact the Seattle Symphony Ticket Office.

We play music, ride motorcycles, date girls and lift heavy shit for a living. We also want to change the world, one concert at a time. Our mission is to gather, uplift and empower those around us by creating a space where people can connect and express themselves freely. Thunderpussy is where you belong. Through music, performance and community engagement, we hope to embody the change we want to see in the world, encourage others to question the status quo and break down walls of separation. Thunderpussy is a state of mind. Tune in, turn up and let TP take you to a better place and time. This is rock 'n' roll's new diamond in the muff.\n\nSEATTLE SYMPHONY\n\nThe Seattle Symphony unleashes the power of music, brings people together and lifts the human spirit.
