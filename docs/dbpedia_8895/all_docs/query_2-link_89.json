        "text": "(photo by Barry Toranto)\n\nWe’re looking for people to host Will Johnson Undertow Shows in March + April 2023\n\nWe’ll make this as easy as possible for the hosts. All you have to do is let us borrow your living room (for approx 3 hours) and check-in guests at the door upon arrival. In return you’ll get 5 free tickets for your friends and our eternal gratitude.\n\nDo you live in or near one of the cities listed below? Do you have large living room, loft space, community space, art gallery, yoga studio, coffee shop, or other space that can comfortably and safely host up to 50 people? If so, please read everything on this page and fill in the form below to submit your space.\n\nWill would love to play a show at your place!\n\nMarch\n\nMarch 22: St. Louis MO\n\nMarch 23: Chicago IL\n\nMarch 24: Detroit MI\n\nMarch 25: Cleveland OH / Pittsburgh PA\n\nMarch 26: Buffalo NY\n\nMarch 28: Boston MA\n\nMarch 29: NYC / Brooklyn March 31 : Philadelphia PA\n\nApril\n\nApril 01: Baltimore MD\n\nApril 02: Washington DC\n\nApril 03: Richmond VA\n\nApril 04: Asheville NC / Brevard NC\n\nApril 05: Athens GA\n\nApril 06: Atlanta GA\n\nApril 07: Waverly AL\n\nApril 08: Mississippi / Louisiana\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\n1. Please read everything so you know how it works.\n\n2. PLEASE VISIT THIS LINK TO FILL IN THE FORM TO SUBMIT YOUR PLACE\n\n3. Sit tight and we’ll get back to as soon as possible if we can confirm a show at your place.\n\nA few things we want you to know about hosting a show. . .\n\n1. LOCATION\n\nYou have a large living room, loft space, community space, art gallery, yoga studio, recording studio, coffee shop or other space where we can do a private show that can comfortably and safely host up to 40 people.\n\nThere needs to be street parking, parking garage or public transportation nearby so guests can get to your place easily. Please check with your neighbors and make sure they’re ok with a bunch of extra people coming over before you offer to host a show. It would be a huge bummer if someone called the cops because of all the extra cars and people coming to your place.\n\n2. CAPACITY\n\nWe’re currently limiting capacity for indoor shows to 35 tickets. Please keep in mind when determining your capacity, you get five free tickets for friends that won’t be included in the ticketed capacity. The capacity you tell us will be the number of tickets we put on sale. EXAMPLE: If we sell 35 tickets and you invite 5 guests, there will be 40 people at the show.\n\n3. TICKET PRICE\n\nTicket price will be $20. Everyone must buy tickets in advance. No tickets will be sold at the door. There will be no reselling or third-party tickets sales. All tickets sales are direct to fans from Undertow. Limit 4 tickets per person. These shows usually sell out quickly and we want everyone to have a fair opportunity to buy tickets.\n\n4. GUEST LIST\n\nWe’ll provide the host with a list of everyone coming to the show. The host won’t have to deal with any money and will only need to check people off the list as they arrive. We ask guests to arrive between 7:15-7:45pm. The shows start at 8pm and we ask everyone to be out of your space within 30 minutes after the show has ended. That’s usually no later than 10pm.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT! We are requiring all guests bring a completed COVID-19 vaccine card and show it at the door to enter. The artist will be at the door with the host to help check-in guests as they arrive. There will be no exceptions. If someone doesn’t have their vaccine card, they will not be allowed to enter.\n\n5. FREE TICKETS FOR HOSTS\n\nThe host gets 5 additional free tickets for the show. If you have other friends beyond your 5 guests who want to come to the show you should direct them buy tickets on-line. These guests will also need to bring a completed vaccine card to attend the show.\n\n6. PROMOTING THE SHOW\n\nThe shows will promoted on our websites, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and word-of-mouth. Your home address will not be published on the web and will only be given to people who purchase tickets.\n\nWe’ll need your help to spread the word on your Facebook and Twitter too. We’ll create a Facebook event for each show and make you a host of the event so you can easily invite your friends (Thank you!). Remember, please don’t post your address. The address only goes to people after they buy tickets. We need to keep the location private so random people don’t try to show up and pay at the door.\n\n7. SOUND SYSTEM & LIGHTING\n\nYou don’t need a sound system. Most of the shows are totally acoustic. But some artists bring a small sound system if they’re playing electric instruments, so they will need access to a nearby electrical outlet. We’ll let you know.\n\nYou don’t need any special lighting. But it would be great if you had some kind of ambient lighting like a lamp on coffee table, floor lamp, or overhead lights with a dimmer to help create a cozy mood.\n\n8. SEATING\n\nYou don’t need seating for everyone. If you have a bunch of chairs, great! But most shows are floor seating and we let guests know they should bring folding chair, cushion or pillow to sit on during the show.\n\n9. OPENING ARTISTS\n\nWe don’t have openers on the living room shows. We’re trying to make this as easy as possible and minimize the amount of time guests are in your space. It’s much easier for us to keep things simple and stay on schedule if it’s just one artist playing.\n\n10. FRIENDLY PETS\n\nWe love dogs and cats… we really do! But an excitable pet running around during the show can be distracting for the guests and performers. If you have curious and friendly 4-legged family members, would you be ok with putting them in another part of the house or sending them to a friend’s house during the show?\n\nPLEASE VISIT THIS LINK TO FILL IN THE FORM TO SUBMIT YOUR PLACE\n\n# Thanks! #\n\nRelated Images:"
