        "text": "The social determinants of health (SDH) are the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. They are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems.\n\nThe SDH have an important influence on health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. In countries at all levels of income, health and illness follow a social gradient: the lower the socioeconomic position, the worse the health.\n\nThe following list provides examples of the social determinants of health, which can influence health equity in positive and negative ways:\n\nIncome and social protection\n\nEducation\n\nUnemployment and job insecurity\n\nWorking life conditions\n\nFood insecurity\n\nHousing, basic amenities and the environment\n\nEarly childhood development\n\nSocial inclusion and non-discrimination\n\nStructural conflict\n\nAccess to affordable health services of decent quality.\n\nResearch shows that the social determinants can be more important than health care or lifestyle choices in influencing health. For example, numerous studies suggest that SDH account for between 30-55% of health outcomes. In addition, estimates show that the contribution of sectors outside health to population health outcomes exceeds the contribution from the health sector.\n\nAddressing SDH appropriately is fundamental for improving health and reducing longstanding inequities in health, which requires action by all sectors and civil society.\n\nThere are challenges to overcome in implementing action to address health inequities through the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health equity is a complex and multifaceted field. It involves a wide range of stakeholders within and beyond the health sector and all levels of government. In addition, social determinants of health data can be difficult to collect and share.\n\nWhile the evidence base on the social determinants of health has strengthened during the past decade, the evidence base on what works needs to be strengthened and good practices disseminated effectively.\n\nThree areas for critical action identified in the report of the Global Commission on Social Determinants of Health reflect their importance in tackling inequities in health. These include:\n\nImprove daily living conditions:\n\nThe circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work and age;\n\nTackle the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources:\n\nThe structural drivers of those conditions of daily life (for example, macroeconomic and urbanization policies and governance);\n\nMeasure and understand the problem and assess the impact of action:\n\nExpand the knowledge base, develop a workforce that is trained in the social determinants of health, and raise public awareness about the social determinants of health.\n\nScaled up and systematic action is required that is universal but proportionate to the disadvantage across the social gradient. This is necessary for effective delivery to addressing inequities in health and promoting healthier populations.\n\nLife expectancy and healthy life expectancy have increased, but unequally. There remain persistent and widening gaps between those with the best and worst health and well-being.\n\nPoorer populations systematically experience worse health than richer populations. For example:\n\nThere is a difference of 18 years of life expectancy between high- and low- income countries;\n\nIn 2016, the majority of the 15 million premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occurred in low- and middle-income countries;\n\nRelative gaps within countries between poorer and richer subgroups for diseases like cancer have increased in all regions across the world;\n\nThe under-5 mortality rate is more than eight times higher in Africa than the European region. Within countries, improvements in child health between poorest and richest subgroups have been impaired by slower improvements for poorer subgroups.\n\nSuch trends within and between countries are unfair, unjust and avoidable. Many of these health differences are caused by the decision-making processes, policies, social norms and structures which exist at all levels in society.\n\nInequities in health are socially determined, preventing poorer populations from moving up in society and making the most of their potential.\n\nPursuing health equity means striving for the highest possible standard of health for all people and giving special attention to the needs of those at greatest risk of poor health, based on social conditions.\n\nAction requires not only equitable access to healthcare but also means working outside the healthcare system to address broader social well-being and development.\n\n“Health equity is defined as the absence of unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically”."
