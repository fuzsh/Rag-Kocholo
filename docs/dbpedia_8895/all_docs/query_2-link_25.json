Watch it below now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrummer Greg Gilmore told Consequence Of Sound: “What I can say right now is that I just watched the video and was struck by how unbelievably fucking great that song is. Ronald Reagan bad. Punk rock good!”\n\nGilmore is the one who found the recordings that make up ‘The Living: 1982’, which was released on Loosegroove Records, the label run by Pearl Jam’s Stone Gossard.\n\nRecommended\n\nSpeaking previously about The Living, McKagan said: “Would this even ever get out of our basement? We had something magical then, and it was ours, so who gives a fuck!”\n\nGilmore added: “The Living was the beginning of all things Seattle for me — a turning point in my life. I joined a band and a community. These guys are still my brothers. I’ve cherished these recordings since the days we made them. This record is a fantastic document of a loaded moment. I love it.”"
