        "text": "Why do we write songs?\n\nThere are infinite answers to this question. Personally, I’ve come to know songwriting as an act of liberation. On rare occasions, it shows up unannounced and my only job is to capture it – I don’t always capture it. More often though, I think of songwriting like entering a cave. The cave I know is often dark, awkward, foreign yet familiar. At first, your eyes are not adjusted to all that surround you. You're restless, a bit uncomfortable and you ask yourself “What’s the point?” Yet you know you’re surrounded by so much that you can’t see. If only you could see it... if only it could make sense. Part of you knows the darkness holds something beautiful that belongs to you… something that might help you if you could just touch it, bottle it and get out of there. You stumble into a memory... maybe it's a part of your story that hurts. You question how these protruding parts of yourself could ever become something beautiful. Slowly, gradually, you become more skilled. Your breathing slows. Because you gave yourself time, your eyes begin to adjust to the dark. An image of truth is taking shape. In the quiet, the truth whispers to you a song that you’ve never heard, but you have felt. You sketch it onto a piece of paper and turn around to leave. As you move back toward the light, the song prepares to enter the world for the first time. She might come out kicking and screaming, or meek and mild. Either way, she is perfect because she is truth and she is yours. You feel lighter and freer... still vulnerable. Now you have this little thing with you, nobody notices because she's invisible. Still you raise her with compassion... you play with her. You introduce her to others, and they teach her things you couldn't and she grows. And one day she goes off into the world on her own. When she does, she will carry a piece of you, a little bit of truth that will come to belong to others, so that when you die, it is only your body that disappears.\n\n~ George"
