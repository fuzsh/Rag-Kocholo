        "text": "The members of Toronto punk band PUP have spent the past five years making a living off writing songs about how miserable and pissed off they are. But on a rainy Thursday night in early May at the Mohawk in Austin, Texas, the foursome—singer/guitarist Stefan Babcock, guitarist Steve Sladkowski, drummer Zack Mykula and bassist Nestor Chumak—is feeling a different sort of negative emotion: an almost paternal disappointment in the hordes of stage divers hurling themselves onto smaller, unsuspecting audience members. Babcock and Sladkowski implore fans to exit the side of the stage—and when that doesn’t work, they literally chase them off mid-song, ducking and weaving to avoid slicing anybody with their guitar necks. Who knew babysitting a crowd of spatially unaware adult men was a requirement of punk rock?\n\nThese problems are not new to PUP, who have exponentially increased their fan base—and, subsequently, the size of the venues they play—over the past five years. They’re currently touring in support of their third album, Morbid Stuff, a caustic, ridiculously catchy set of songs about the persistent agonies of making music and touring for a living, even when everything looks great from the outside. They’re playing large clubs and theaters on this leg, most of which have sold out, and they’ll be on the road approximately forever (or at least until the end of November).\n\nPUP’s world has expanded dramatically since they released their 2013 eponymous debut, which addressed the struggles of a young band trying to break out of their hometown and into the music industry. 2016’s The Dream Is Over dealt with the physical, emotional and financial burden of touring nonstop for two years, as well as Babcock’s vocal cord troubles that threatened to derail his career. (The album title comes from the diagnosis Babcock received from his doctor.) On Morbid Stuff, PUP face a new challenge. They’re selling out large venues, releasing universally acclaimed records and making a comfortable living, all while maintaining their punk rock integrity. So why do they still feel kind of terrible?\n\nBabcock admits the band still grapples with this paradox. “It's important to be self-aware. We're not victims of our circumstances. That isn't the problem here. That doesn't mean we're happy, and it doesn't mean we feel good, but I just f***ing hate music that is just people whining about how bad their life is—especially when they get to a level like this, where their life really isn't that bad,” he says. “So I want to do everything in my power to stay away from that, while also remaining true to the fact that I'm not going to just write a bunch of happy lyrics about feeling great when I feel like s**t. It’s still got to be real and truthful.”\n\nBabcock and Sladkowski discussed these conflicting sentiments and recent triumphs while sitting on their tour bus—a major step up from the vans and trailers of tours’ past, and a source of discontent for Babcock in particular, who wishes to cling to punk’s DIY ethics as much as possible.\n\nYou guys are selling out shows left and right on this tour. You recently performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, and you played at Lollapalooza in 2017. Did those experiences feel validating?\n\nSladkowski: The more I kind of reflect on it, it just sort of feels like it makes me want to just keep doing what we're doing. It kind of reinforces that spending the time to try and make the songs and records sound as good as we can make them, and going on tour and trying to have a good live show—it’s cool that that stands out to some of those bigger things.\n\nBabcock: We're not a band that should be on television or that should be on the radio or any of those things. I think most bands shoot for those things, but they have to kind of tailor their art to that a little bit. It’s just the same mentality as starting out, where if we work hard enough and just keep going, hopefully people will take notice and stop ignoring that kind of music in those worlds. So it's been good. It's no expectations, but when good things happen, it feels great that we were lucky to get those opportunities, and we accomplished them without sacrificing anything on our end.\n\nYou guys are touring in a bus now, which is a big step up from how you toured in the past. It seemed like that was a source of uneasiness for you at the beginning.\n\nBabcock: I’m still a little uneasy about it… There’s a part of me that, the more we're grinding, the more I feel like things are deserved and earned, if that makes sense. Whereas we've grinded—ground?—we've ground and done the work for years. And we worked really hard writing this record, and now I guess it feels like this is a bit of a payoff for that. Where in the past it's been like, you grind and you write a record, and then you grind it out on tour. So I guess it's just a different mentality. I'm just slowly getting used to it.\n\nIt sounds like you get so comfortable with being uncomfortable, your brain doesn’t know how to handle a little bit of comfort.\n\nBabcock: I think there's a guilt factor that comes with comfort, especially doing what we do, because what we do is supposed to be really visceral.\n\nYour throat diagnosis kind of became the defining conflict of making The Dream Is Over. Were there any main roadblocks or hurdles that inspired the material on this album?\n\nBabcock: A lot of it was us being our own worst enemies, our own impediments to success and trying to overcome that. I mean, on The Dream Is Over, it felt like something was stopping me. Something out of my control was stopping me from continuing the band. And on this record, it seemed like it was something that was in my control but truly is not—I mean, fighting against apathy and fighting against these feelings of like, “Things are going well, why do I feel this way?”\n\nI think musically, the impediment was, we know what kind of band we are. We know what kind of band we want to be. We are exactly the kind of band that we want to be. So when you keep making records, for us, we just want to make the same records, but better and different. So on record three, how do you do that without repeating yourself? I'm not talking about lyrically but musically. So there were a lot of discussions we had about how to maintain that spirit and energy and not reuse the same old tricks.\n\nYou sing candidly on this album about your own experiences with anxiety, depression, anger, and the fact that being in a successful band doesn’t make these things go away. But on “Full Blown Meltdown,” you kind of get out in front of that and accuse yourself of fetishizing your own problems. How do you reconcile those two attitudes?\n\nBabcock: There’s so much to unpack there. It’s a thing that I’ve really, really grappled with, and I think I did the best job expressing it that I could on “Full Blown Meltdown.” I don't write songs for other people. I write songs for myself. It's therapeutic and cathartic for me, and that's why I do it. And of course, I hope that people will relate and find something good in these songs, but that's not why I do it. And so, you know, I say all this negative s**t, and I do it for myself. And then there's this other side where, well, we've kind of made a career out of being f**k-ups. And there's some weird dynamic at play where we're literally making money by screaming about how pissed off we are. It’s just so weird, and it's a difficult experience for me. And I think for “Full Blown Meltdown,” you know, that song was almost called “The Realest Song on This Record.”\n\nSladkowski: You were pushing for it.\n\nBabcock: But I think it was really important to have that, because I want everyone to know that we realize what we're doing, and I hope that these songs are doing more good than bad. And so, you know, that's why I have to call out myself and the music industry at large for fetishizing that kind of s**t. It sucks. But that was a really important song for me on this record to kind of make it abundantly clear. And for other bands that are doing something similar or adjacent to what we're doing—don't f***ing fetishize this s**t. It's not good. Normalize it, that's great. But it is a weird struggle that I find difficult to sort of articulate.\n\nDo you ever worry you’ll reach a limit where you can’t possibly get any more pissed off or heavy within this genre of music?\n\nBabcock: Yeah. I mean, that's part of the fun and part of the excitement about making music and making records in the way that we do, where we don't want to repeat ourselves. I have no clue what our next record's going to sound like. And you know, after The Dream Is Over, there were things that we knew, mistakes that we made on that record that we wanted to rectify, but we didn't know what Morbid Stuff was going to sound like or be like.\n\nSladkowski: It’s not an experiment, but it’s very open-ended.\n\nSo it’s not formulaic.\n\nBabcock: Well, we’re trying out best to make it not that. One of the things that I'm really happy with in this band is that we're all self-aware people, and we're all really hard on ourselves and each other. So if we start falling into that complacent formula, we'll know it and we'll call each other out for it. That doesn't mean that I think that we’ll always only improve, but I think it does mean that we're not fooling ourselves into thinking that, “Oh, we made a record that we all like, let’s just keep doing it again and again.”\n\nSladkowski: Or that like, it was successful in some way; ergo, to have that success, we need to repeat it."
