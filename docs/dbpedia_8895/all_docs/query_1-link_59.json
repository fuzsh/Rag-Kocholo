Other General Schedule employees covered by this table whose pay rate at their grade and step on this table is below the rate for the same grade and step on an applicable special rate table under 5 U.S.C. 5305 (or similar special rate under other legal authority) are entitled to the higher special rate. For example, in the case of special rate table 001M covering employees at grades GS-1 through GS-4 stationed in the United States, a table 001M special rate applies in place of any corresponding locality rate or other applicable special rate that is lower than the table 001M special rate."
