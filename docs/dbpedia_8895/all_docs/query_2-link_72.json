We developed the Living Wage Calculator to help individuals, communities, employers, and others estimate the local wage rate that a full-time worker requires to cover the costs of their familyâ€™s basic needs where they live. Explore the living wage in your county, metro area, or state for 12 different family types below. The data was last updated on February 14, 2024."
