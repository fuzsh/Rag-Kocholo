        "text": "Ayn Rand\n\nAmerican author\n\nTop Questions\n\nWho was Ayn Rand?\n\nAyn Rand was a Russian-born American author and philosopher. Rand authored two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957). Her novels were especially influential among conservatives and libertarians from the mid-20th century.\n\nWhere is Ayn Rand from?\n\nAyn Rand was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 2, 1905. When the tsarist regime was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, her family moved to Crimea, where she finished high school. She returned to Russia in 1921 and then moved to the United States in 1926.\n\nWhat is Ayn Rand’s real name?\n\nAyn Rand is the pen name of Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum. She adopted it when she moved to the United States in 1926. The first name, which rhymes with “pine,” was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer (whom she declined to identify), and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum.\n\nWhen did Ayn Rand begin writing?\n\nAyn Rand arrived in Chicago in 1926 and then moved to Hollywood, where she met American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille. Her chance encounter with DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. Rand sold her first screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios in 1932.\n\nWhat are Ayn Rand’s most famous works?\n\nRand’s first major work, The Fountainhead, was published in 1943. It details the struggle of a genius architect against mediocrity. Her second major work, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957. It follows a railroad executive and a steel magnate as they grapple with a collectivist government. Both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged explicate Rand’s personal philosophy of objectivism.\n\nHow did Ayn Rand die?\n\nRand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, in New York City. At the time, she had been working on a television adaptation of her novel Atlas Shrugged.\n\nAyn Rand (born February 2, 1905, St. Petersburg, Russia—died March 6, 1982, New York, New York, U.S.) was a Russian-born American writer whose commercially successful novels promoting individualism and laissez-faire capitalism were influential among conservatives and libertarians and popular among generations of young people in the United States from the mid-20th century.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nHer father, Zinovy Rosenbaum, was a prosperous pharmacist. After being tutored at home, Alissa Rosenbaum, the eldest of three children, was enrolled in a progressive school, where she excelled academically but was socially isolated. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, her father’s shop was confiscated by communist authorities, an event she deeply resented. As a student at Leningrad State University, she studied history and became acquainted with the works of Plato and Aristotle. After graduating in 1924, she enrolled in the State Institute for Cinematography, hoping to become a screenwriter.\n\nThe arrival of a letter from cousins in Chicago gave her an opportunity to leave the country on the pretext of gaining expertise that she could apply in the Soviet film industry. Upon her arrival in the United States in 1926, she changed her name to Ayn Rand. (The first name, which rhymes with “pine,” was inspired by the name of a Finnish writer, whom she never identified, and the surname she described as an abbreviation of Rosenbaum.) After six months in Chicago she moved to Hollywood, where a fortuitous encounter with the producer Cecil B. DeMille led to work as a movie extra and eventually to a job as a screenwriter. In 1929 she married the actor Frank O’Connor. Soon hired as a filing clerk in the wardrobe department of RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., she rose to head of the department within a year, meanwhile writing stories, plays, and film scenarios in her spare time. She became an American citizen in 1931.\n\nThe Fountainhead\n\nRand’s first successful play, Night of January 16th (1933; originally titled Penthouse Legend), was a paean to individualism in the form of a courtroom drama. In 1934 she and O’Connor moved to New York City so that she could oversee the play’s production on Broadway. That year she also wrote Ideal, about a self-centred film star on the run from the law, first as a novel and then as a play. However, she shelved both versions. The play was not produced until 1989, and the novel was not published until 2015. Her first published novel, We the Living (1936), was a romantic tragedy in which Soviet totalitarianism epitomized the inherent evils of collectivism, which she understood as the subordination of individual interests to those of the state. A subsequent novella, Anthem (1938), portrayed a future collectivist dystopia in which the concept of the self and even the word “I” have been lost.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWomen in Art and Literature: Who Said It?\n\nRand spent more than seven years working on her first major work, The Fountainhead (1943), the story of a handsome architectural genius whose individualism and integrity are evinced in his principled dedication to his own happiness. The hero, Howard Roark, blows up a public housing project he had designed after it is altered against his wishes by government bureaucrats. On trial for his crime, he delivers a lengthy speech in his own defense in which he argues for individualism over collectivism and egoism over altruism (“the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self”). The jury votes unanimously to acquit him. Despite generally bad reviews, the book attracted readers through word of mouth and eventually became a best seller. Rand sold it to Warner Brothers studio and wrote the screenplay for the film, which was released in 1949.\n\nAtlas Shrugged\n\nHaving returned to Los Angeles with O’Connor to work on the script for The Fountainhead, Rand signed a contract to work six months a year as a screenwriter for the independent producer Hal Wallis. In 1945 she began sketches for her next novel, Atlas Shrugged (1957; film part 1, 2011, part 2, 2012, part 3, 2014), which is generally considered her masterpiece. The book depicts a future United States on the verge of economic collapse after years of collectivist misrule, under which productive and creative citizens (primarily industrialists, scientists, and artists) have been exploited to benefit an undeserving population of moochers and incompetents. The hero, John Galt, a handsome and supremely self-interested physicist and inventor, leads a band of elite producers and creators in a “strike” designed to deprive the economy of their leadership and thereby force the government to respect their economic freedom. From their redoubt in Colorado, “Galt’s Gulch,” they watch as the national economy and the collectivist social system are destroyed. As the elite emerge from the Gulch in the novel’s final scene, Galt raises his hand “over the desolate earth and…trace[s] in space the sign of the dollar.”\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In an appendix to Atlas Shrugged, Rand described her systematic philosophy, which she called objectivism, as “in essence…the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.”\n\nAlthough the book was attacked by critics from across the political spectrum for its perceived immorality and misanthropy and its overt hostility to religion (Rand was an atheist), it was an instant best seller. It was especially well received by business leaders, many of whom were impressed by its moral justification of capitalism and delighted to think of their occupations as noble and virtuous. Like The Fountainhead, Atlas Shrugged also appealed widely to young people through its extreme romanticism, its accessible and comprehensive philosophy, its rejection of traditional authority and convention, and its implicit invitation to the reader to join the ranks of the elite by modeling himself on the story’s hero."
