        "text": "Tell us about your tour vehicle. Any notable breakdown stories?\n\nI’ve got a 2017 Ford Transit 150 van that has been a pain in my ass since I bought it. Either the AC is on the fritz (during the summer) or the heat is blowing the coldest air (deep into winter) you’ve ever felt. There’s about a three-month window every year when I don’t need either of them to get by, when the weather is mild.\n\nHow do you eat cheaply and/or healthy while on tour?\n\nI usually don’t eat healthy but I seem to eat a lot less on the road. If we’ve got a handful of days off and we’re not near home we’ll get an Airbnb and do some cooking. Curry or steaks.\n\nHow many strings do you break in a typical year? How much does it cost to replace them?\n\nI’d say I break about 5-7 strings a year. Probably always the G string. Last year on our way to DC the air died in my van (no surprise there) on one of the hottest days of the summer, and about 4 hours from our destination. It was like driving a boat with the windows down. I was frazzled and sweat-soaked upon arrival. I broke two strings that night and my guitarist broke one.\n\nWhere do you rehearse?\n\nWe rehearse in Atlanta where my band lives. Our spot is directly across the street from the U.S. Federal penitentiary where I’m told Joe Exotic is housed. It’s a rather large prison, with a sprawling campus scattered with defunct living quarters where guards and their families stayed. Almost like a mini military base. When we join Bob (my bass player) on one of his smoke-breaks outside we gaze upon its grandeur and speculate on its next identity: will it be a shopping mall\n\nWhat was the title and a sample lyric from the first song that you wrote?\n\nI can’t recall the first song I wrote but one of the first ones that I thought was good was “Bad Teeth”. We recorded it back in 2016 initially but that record really never saw the light of day. It was re-recorded and released on my first official record in 2019.\n\nDescribe your first gig.\n\nI truly don’t remember my first gig. I never did the 3-hour cover band shows though. I was adamant about that from the get-go. My interest in performing is not as enthusiastic as you’d imagine. Maybe because performing doesn’t come easy to me. It’s a mental game and I’ve got to be deeply connected to what I’m doing. It’s a necessary part of the job and for the most part it’s relatively satisfying.\n\nWhat was your last day job? What was your favorite day job?\n\nMy last and favorite day job was as a sportswriter for our local newspaper here in Murray County.\n\nHow has your music-related income changed over the past 5-10 years? What do you expect it to look like 5-10 years from now?\n\nThis job/vocation isn’t for the faint of heart, or for someone looking for immediate financial stability. My short term goal is simply to be able to sustain my efforts, to continue making records and touring. I’ve been lucky and I’m grateful. At my age, it’s hard to get off the ground, to create a natural stir and draw attention to your work. It’s a slow build so you need to be committed and trust your voice.\n\nWhat one thing do you know now that you had wished you knew when you started your career in music?\n\nThat you can actually make a living under the radar. You might not be buying a Cadillac anytime soon, but you can control your work and take risks creatively if you don’t join up with a big industry outfit. A lot of factors go into our decisions though. It’s not a one-size-fits-all career.\n\nOn his new album North Georgia Rounder, Pony Bradshaw leads the listener on an exploration of the woods, rivers, and mountains of Appalachia, more specifically, the area for which the album is named and he’s called home for the past 15 years. “It’s got its hooks in me,” Bradshaw says of North Georgia, and it shows, with songs that quickly establish a setting, much like the one he initiated with the album’s predecessor, Calico Jim. The sonic excursion includes stops along the Conasauga River, visits to the holler, and a few diversions—nearby Knoxville plays a supporting role, as do Louisiana and Arkansas. It’s an impressionistic journey of introspection and connection all at once.\n\nConnect with Bradshaw online and on the road."
