They put their heart and soul into their music and it absolutely shows.”\n\n“Our guests danced the ENTIRE time and are still asking us ‘where did you find that amazing band??'”\n\n“I can’t even count how many people came up to us throughout the night to gush about how amazing the band was.”\n\nEveryone was on the dance floor all night. The presence of the band was exactly what we were hoping for!\n\n“Even couples who “don’t dance” were up dancing together for the first time in ages.”\n\n“We wanted a soulful, rootsy, heartfelt vibe at our wedding and that’s exactly what the Loyales delivered.”\n\n“They were a crucial part of the day and they didn’t disappoint – totally recommend!”\n\n“…my sister (a music snob) even ended up going to one of their performances without realizing that they were our wedding band”\n\n“Every guest, from my 90 year great aunt, to my young nieces and nephews, to our 30 year old friends tell us that we had the best band ever!”\n\n“I cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed having the Loyales play our wedding and would absolutely book them again in the future.”\n\n“The dance floor was never empty, the music was perfectly curated, all our requested songs were played seamlessly (including the first dance) and the band performed at a level that I have never personally experienced at a wedding.”\n\n“Their repertoire is an impeccably curated mix of Motown hits, classic rock, classic country, rocksteady reggae, and jazz standards. You can’t go wrong with this band. The perfect band.”\n\n“Expert players, beautiful vocals with great harmonies, plus all-around really nice people. Book them. You’ll be glad you did.”\n\n“They’ve got a huge repertoire of music, and played to the mood of each part of the night beautifully… ”\n\n“…made us feel like we were selecting songs from a personal juke box of rock, R&B and funk!”\n\n“The Loyales were a huge hit…we wanted all classic rock and up-beat funk and they definitely delivered!”\n\n“…everyone was up out of their seats having a great time.”\n\n“…They had people dancing all night and really read the room well!”\n\n“…We got married in a heatwave and nobody left the dance floor till we kicked people out…It was just the best dance party!”"
