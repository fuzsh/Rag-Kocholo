When I was in my early 20s I discovered and became an admirer of the writings of Ayn Rand - the author of the philosophically provoking best selling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. A few years later, I was amused to learn that Rand enjoyed a type of turn of the century popular music that she called \"Tiddlywink Music.\"\n\nOf course, there is no such formally recognized musical genre. \"Tiddlywink\" seems to have been the name that Ayn Rand gave to music that she responded to in a certain way. The music does not seem to come from from any one particular genre: Canadian Capers is an example of ragtime; El Choclo is a tango.\n\nWhen I discovered that Rand enjoyed music from the same era that I do, I became very curious as to what specific tunes she liked and classified as Tiddlywink music. Unfortunately, only a few examples have been cited in books and lectures about her. Because I find it fascinating when different interests of mine meet, I always try to keep an eye open for recordings with an Ayn Rand connection. There are two obstacles that I face in doing so. One is the previously mentioned limited information. The other is the fact that locating specific vintage recordings can sometimes take a lot of time. As I find them, however, I will transcribe them to Real Audio and place them on this site.\n\nImportant Information About The Recordings\n\nThe recordings presented here are of songs that I am told that Ayn Rand either liked or had some connection with - such as through one of her movies. As someone with extremely strong musical opinions, I think it is important for me to mention that, just because someone likes a particular song, it does not mean that they will like every rendition of it. For example, every so often I will be hear one of my favorite songs resurrected and played in a dreadful \"easy listening\" style. Whenever this happens, my usual reaction is revulsion over what I consider to be aesthetic vandalism. When I listen to music, how something is played is often more important than what is being played. I think it is reasonable to assume the same was true for Ayn Rand as well. Please keep this in mind when listening.\n\nUnlike today where most popular music stars use material written exclusively for them, in the early decades of the 20th century the music industry was dominated by \"Tin Pan Alley\" publishers. When a new song showed signs of becoming popular, record companies tried to get as much mileage as they could out of it by having several artists record it in a variety of styles. In the 1920s, an especially popular tune could have been recorded by a \"hot\" jazz band, a \"sweet\" society band, a Hawaiian guitar duet, a novelty vocalist, an organ soloist, a \"popular concert\" orchestra, a \"salon\" orchestra and, for the rural markets, a \"hillbilly\" group. A fan of a particular hot jazz rendition would probably not care much for the hillbilly or Hawaiian versions - and perhaps may not even like versions by other hot jazz bands.\n\nThe majority of the selections presented here come from my personal 78 rpm record collection. A few come from subsequent reissues or from the generosity of other music collectors who have been credited. The music on this page does not necessarily present a representative view of the popular music of the era or of my own personal musical tastes.\n\nIf you enjoy the music presented here, you might want to visit my musical website, Dismuke's Virtual Talking Machine, which features a variety of music from my collection recorded between 1900 and 1940. I also publish Dismuke's Hit of the Week which is updated every Thursday. Also check out my Internet radio station Radio Dismuke which is devoted to popular music from the decade 1925 - 1935\n\nAbout The Images On This Site\n\nAnyone familiar with Ayn Rand's writings already knows how she much she loved New York City and its skyline. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to decorate the site with New York City skyscraper pictures from roughly the same era as the recordings. Included are all of the New York buildings that were, at some point in the 20th century, the tallest in the world. The images come from either my personal collection or from the United States Library of Congress.\n\n\"Canadian Capers\"\n\nThis was one of Ayn Rand's favorites. In an October 5, 1944 letter to her brother-in-law, Nick Carter, Rand asked him to ship her records from New York to her new home in California. \"Just put an extra pad of cotton, if you can get it, around Canadian Capers,\" she added.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nVictor Arden - Phil Ohman 1930\n\nMy understanding is that this is the version that Rand had in her collection. Arden and Ohman were an extremely popular piano team throughout the 1920s both on records and piano rolls. The record label characterizes this selection as a \"tap dance.\" If you listen carefully, about 2 minutes and 17 seconds into the recording, you can hear what sounds like a tap dancer in the background. Of course, it may have simply been a sound effect from the percussion section. It took me many months - as well as a nice chunk of change - to locate this recording.\n\nHere are some additional versions of Canadian Capers performed in a variety of styles.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nHarry Snodgrass, piano 1926\n\nBurnswick Records billed Snodgrass as \"King of the Ivories.\" I think the Arden -Ohman version is better. Unfortunately, this poor record has been subjected to quite a bit of abuse over the decades and is not in the best of shape - though it is still listenable.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nHarry Roy & His Orchestra from The Cafe Anglais 1933\n\nThis is a jazzy British dance band recording that comes courtesy of Michael Herklotz, a German record collector I occasionally correspond with. I really like this arrangement; it is guaranteed to put you in a good mood! Herklotz, by the way, has an excellent website, Die Shellack-Seite , that regularly features British and German dance band recordings from the 1920s & 1930s.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nAl Donahue and His Orchestra 1939\n\nFor most of his career Donahue had a society band. However, in the late '30s and early '40s, he adopted a swing format - of which this recording is an example.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nLawrence Welk and His Orchestra 1941\n\nWelk was just as schmaltzy in the 1940s as he was in that ghastly television show you may remember. This is the first Lawrence Welk record I have ever intentionally bought. What little I do have by him was obtained in bulk purchases and was quickly relegated to its proper place: my \"junk record\" pile in the garage! Back in the '30s and '40s, jazz and swing enthusiasts had a derogatory term for bands such as Welk's: Mickey Mouse bands.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nPaul Whiteman and His Orchestra 1921\n\nPaul Whitman led the 1920's most successful dance band. He helped make the newly emerging jazz music \"respectable\" and introduced Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue in a now famous 1924 Aeolian Hall concert. In the late 1920s, his band featured many of the era's top white jazz musicians and provided the start for the singing careers of Bing Crosby and Mildred Bailey. One of the most influential names in the 20th Century music industry, he is mostly forgotten today.\n\nCanadian Capers\n\nTommy Dorsey and His Orchestra 1937\n\nHere is an interesting bit of trivia: Ayn Rand was buried one grave over from Tommy Dorsey. Dorsey was one of the top white jazz sidemen of the late 1920s. After an ill-fated attempt to run a band jointly with brother Jimmy in the early 1930s, he took over the Joe Haymes band and became one of the biggest stars of the swing and big band eras.\n\nTap Dancing\n\nIn her article \"Art and Cognition\" (reprinted in The Romantic Manifesto) Ayn Rand wrote:\n\nTap dancing is completely synchronized with, responsive and obedient to the music - by means of a common element crucial to music and to man's body: rhythm...[Tap dancing] looks, at times, as if it is a contest between the man and the music, as if the music is daring him to follow - and he is following lightly, effortlessly, almost casually. Complete obedience to the music? The impression one gets is: complete control - man's mind in effortless control of his expertly functioning body. The keynote is: precision. It conveys a sense of purpose, discipline, clarity - a mathematical kind of clarity - combined with an unlimited freedom of movement and an inexhaustible inventiveness that dares the sudden, the unexpected, yet never loses the central integrating line: the music's rhythm.\n\nAyn Rand considered tap dancing to be her favorite form of dance saying that \"it cannot express tragedy or pain or fear or guilt; all it can express is gaiety and every shade of emotion pertaining to the joy of living.\" She cited Bill Robinson and Fred Astaire as its best exponents.\n\nSadly, tap dancing has for decades been a dying art. Ayn Rand was right: it is a form of art that celebrates the joy of living. And since it is synchronized with and obedient to the music, this implies the necessity for music that is equally joyous. But unrestrained joyousness in popular music was dealt a severe blow when jazz turned \"modern\" in the mid 1940s and lost its popular following. Some elements of joyousness tried to resurface during the early rock and roll era - but they were destroyed by the nihilism of the late 1960s. The result is that the popular music of today that is not outrighly nihilistic has been, to a large degree, emotionally sanitized. Turn on your radio and listen to some of the popular stations. You will be hard pressed to find a song that is appropriate for a tap dancer.\n\nBill \"Bojangles\" Robinson\n\nBorn in 1878, Robinson started his dance career at the age of 6 performing \"pikaninny\" roles in restaurants and in minstrel shows. During the first quarter of the 20th century, Robinson's reputation as a dancer grew as he traveled the nightclub and Vaudeville circuits. His Broadway debut came at age 50 when he introduced the song featured here in the review Blackbirds of 1928, which had an all-black cast. He went on to appear in over a dozen motion pictures and in other Broadway productions. To celebrate his 61st birthday, Robinson danced 60 blocks down Broadway from above Columbus Circle to the theater in which he was performing. He died in 1949.\n\nIf you enjoy the sound of the orchestra on this selection, Don Redman's recordings from the early 1930s are highly recommended as are recordings by McKinney's Cotton Pickers, which Redman presided over as musical director from 1927 -1931. Happily, recordings by Redman and other Harlem Renaissance artists are increasingly available on CD reissues.\n\nDoin' The New Low Down\n\nFrom Blackbirds of 1928\n\nBill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, vocal & tap dance\n\nwith Don Redman and His Orchestra 1932\n\nFred Astaire\n\nAstaire, along with his older sister Adele, entered show business when he was 5 years old. Their childhood was spent taking singing and dancing lessons and struggling their way up from small time to big time Vaudeville circuits. By the 1920s, their brother-sister act had paid off and they were highly successful stars on Broadway and in the London theaters. In 1929, however, Adele married a British nobleman and decided to retire from show business. Forced to look for a new routine, Astaire decided to give Hollywood a try. The response to his first screen test was less than encouraging: \"Can't act. Can't sing. Balding. Can dance a little.\" He did, however, manage to land a cameo appearance in the Joan Crawford/Clark Gable picture Dancing Lady. His second film appearance, Flying Down To Rio, paired him with Ginger Rogers and was so successful that on subsequent films he was able to ask for and receive complete artistic control over all musical sequences. This control gave him the artistic latitude to revolutionize both dance and the movie musical.\n\nPick Yourself Up\n\nFrom Swing Time\n\nFred Astaire, vocal & tap dance\n\nwith Johnnie Green and His Orchestra 1936\n\nI Can't Be Bothered Now\n\nFrom Damsel In Distress\n\nFred Astaire, vocal & tap dance\n\nwith Ray Noble and His Orchestra 1937\n\nNice Work If You Can Get It\n\nFrom Damsel In Distress\n\nFred Astaire, vocal & tap dance\n\nwith Ray Noble and His Orchestra 1937\n\nComposer Emerich Kalman\n\nAyn Rand was also fond of Kalman's operettas. In a letter, she specifically asked radio host Ev Suffens to play selections from Countess Maritza and Czardes Fursten.\n\nFor whatever reason, until recently, recordings of Kalman's works have been difficult to find. For example, my 1948 edition of The Gramophone Shop Enclycopedia of Recorded Music, which cataloged all currently available classical music recordings worldwide, had an entry for Kalman but was unable to list any available recordings. It advised readers to check with individual record companies' most recent catalogues.\n\nIn the 1920s, American librettist Harry B. Smith adapted two of Kalman's operettas for the Broadway stage: Countess Maritza in 1926 and The Circus Princess (Die Zirkusprinzessin) in 1927. As a result, selections from these productions were recorded in America - but they seem to have been mostly performed as fox trots by dance bands.\n\nSelections from Countess Maritza\n\nGems From 'Countess Maritza'\n\nVictor Light Opera Company 1927\n\nThis recording was part of the Victor Talking Machine Company's \"Gems From\" series featuring selections from various operettas and musicals. This version is from the adaptation in English by Harry B. Smith\n\nPlay Gypsies - Dance Gypsies\n\nCarl Fenton's Orchestra 1926\n\nThis is the most famous tune from Countess Maritza. Another tune from the operetta, \"The One I 'm Looking For,\" can also be heard on this recording. Carl Fenton's dance band had a large output of recordings on the Brunswick label in the 1920s. In reality, there was no Carl Fenton - the name was fictional and used as a pseudonym for the Brunswick studio band.\n\nSelections from The Circus Princess\n\n(Die Zirkusprinzessin)\n\nDear Eyes That Haunt Me\n\nNat Shilkret and the Victor Orchestra 1927\n\nThis is an instrumental version done up in dance tempo. Nat Shilkret's name appears on several recordings on this site. In the late 1920s Shilkret was the music director for the Victor Talking Machine Company and led many recording sessions ranging from classical to jazz with the company's excellent in-house studio orchestra.\n\nLike You\n\nPaul Whiteman and His Orchestra 1927\n\nThis too is an instrumental version. When this recording was made, Paul Whiteman had the most successful and highest paid dance band in the country with around 30 musicians on its roster - large even for the time. Later that year, after the breakup of the rival Jean Goldkette Orchestra, several of the top white jazz musicians of the 1920s joined the Whiteman band. The result was a combination of the lush orchestral sound heard on this recording with lively \"hot\" jazz solos by the likes of Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer. Whiteman appropriately referred to the style as \"symphonic jazz.\" Modern music critics tend to look down on it as being \"too commercial\" and insufficiently improvisational. But the result was incredibly beautiful and it is sadly long gone from the landscape of popular music.\n\nFilm Version of We The Living\n\nMade in Fascist Italy in the early 1940s without Rand's knowledge or approval, this film was able to get past the initial censors because Italy was then at war with Soviet Russia. But, once the movie was released and had become a big hit, Mussolini's government ordered it withdrawn and destroyed - it finally occurred to them that the story was not merely anti-communist, it was anti-totalitarian. Years later, a surviving copy was discovered and purchased by Ayn Rand's attorney. The restored version, with some changes suggested by Rand herself, was released in the late 1980s.\n\nChansons Paroles (Songs Without Words)\n\nTchaikovsky - Op. 2 No. 3\n\nThis selection is a violin solo from an old Edison Diamond Disc and comes courtesy of R.A. Friedman. This song is featured in the scene where, after hearing Lydia play this tune, Andrea asks her to continue. Instead, Lydia refuses and walks away.\n\nWhen the We The Living movie was reissued, I thought this tune was incredibly beautiful and attempted to learn its name for years. Fortunately, Mr. Friedman, who remembered hearing it on a tape he had made of some of his records, told me about it and sent me a copy - but he could not recall the name of the composer. Finally, after after posting it here on the site, a number of visitors kindly informed me that it was written by Tchaikovsky.\n\nOne of the things that had for so long frustrated my search for the song's name was the fact that the novel describes the tune Lydia played as being by Chopin. My guess is that the producers of the movie substituted one by Tchaikovsky on the premise that it was more appropriate for the story's Russian setting.\n\nI am keeping my eye out for a piano version on 78 rpm for future inclusion.\n\nTitina\n\nInternational Novelty Orchestra 1925\n\nThis selection also comes from R.A. Friedman, who informs me that this is the song that was played in the bawdy bar scene.\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff\n\nRand's love of Rachmaninoff's music is well known. Rachmaninoff was also a talented pianist and his solo recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company sold well. I have read that before he went to Victor, Rachmaninoff briefly recorded for the Edison label. Edison may have been a brilliant inventor, but sometimes he lacked business sense when it came to running a record company. Despite being almost deaf, for years Edison insisted on personally listening to and approving every record that was produced under his label. To hear the music, he had a special machine that he bit into and thereby used the bones in his skull to amplify the sound. To make matters worse, Edison had rather narrow and old fashioned tastes when it came to music. Much to Victor's gain, Rachmaninoff's piano playing did not meet with Edison's approval.\n\nAnother bit of interesting trivia: Ayn Rand and Rachmaninoff are buried in the same cemetery.\n\nPrelude In G Major ( Op. 32, No. 5)\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff, composer, pianist 1920\n\nBecause this recording is low in volume, you will hear quite a bit of surface noise. It sounds much better when it is played as it was intended on a wind up phonograph. If you are interested in hearing more recordings by Rachmaninoff, most of his output has been reissued on CD using state of the ar technology to remove most of the surface noise.\n\nRachmaninoff Player Piano Rolls\n\nIn the early decades of the 20th Century, the player piano was serious competition to the wind-up phonograph for space in the parlors of middle and upper class households. The pianos - \"programmed\" by a series of holes punched in a roll of paper - offered one major advantage over acoustical recording: more accurate sound reproduction. Indeed, thanks to the player piano, we can today hear the piano greats from the past exactly as they sounded live. Like the record industry, the player piano industry was nearly wiped out by the Great Depression. But, unlike records, piano rolls never made a substantial comeback - largely due to the advent of improved recording technology as well as radio and, later on, television. All player piano selections come courtesy of Gabe of Gabe's Piano Player Page - a site that is definitely worth a visit. All selections here are played on Gabe's restored 1925 Lexington Simplex Straightline Player Piano.\n\nRachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto Number 2\n\nRudlolph Martin, Piano\n\nThis selection is seven and a half minutes long - something that, with the exception of a short-lived attempt by Edison, was not possible on the commercially available records of the time.\n\nSchubert Impromtu Op 90 Number 4, A Flat\n\nSergei Rachmaninoff, piano\n\nThis was composed by Schubert - but it does provide an opportunity to hear Rachmaninoff play."
