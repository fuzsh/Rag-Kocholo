The band released seven studio albums starting in 1998. The last one was in 2016 and still going. All of us fans are waiting passionately for new material.

The Living End breathe and eat live music, they just seem never to get enough of it. They are now touring the world to support their latest album “Shift” and going to their Facebook page, the string of dates is simply endless.

The Living End´s filmography is quite long and has been one of the band´s strongest points through the years. They have more than 3,500 subscribers to their YouTube channel and a massive amount of views on some of them at their official account.

Chris Cheney and Scott Owen met as far back as Primary School while both were attending to Jells Park. Both favored 1950s rockabilly and everything from The Stray Cats, Brian Setzer Orchestra to some newer acts like Green Day and the whole punk rock revolution launched in California in the early nineties. The core of the band maintained its unity even when drummers came and went.

The only reason I created this blog, is to let the people in the world know that there´s a band in Australia called The Living End and it is awesome. Of course, I am a fan, and my objectivity is compromised, but my challenge is to prove everyone that these guys are great.
