The Assisted Living Band is a high energy cover dance band playing a mix of hits from the 80's, 90's and 2000's. We are always tweaking our eclectic set list. During the past decades we have built a loyal base of fans that come to see us play in venues and private parties throughout the South Shore. We challenge ourselves on getting people out on the dance floor and keeping them there. We often hear from audience members how much fun they've had at our shows and love the songs on our set list.
