The Assisted Living Band, is a six piece band from the South Shore area of Boston. We are a high energy dance band with an eclectic set list of favorites from the 80's, 90's, 00's and contemporary tunes mixed in. We aim to make our shows fun and we pride ourselves on getting people on the dance floor and keeping them there. Check our "shows" page to see where we are playing next.
