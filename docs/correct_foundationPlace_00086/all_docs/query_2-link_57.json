Your generous, tax-deductible donation will give an abused child a voice in court, help a young person correct a mistake, and keep Portsmouth families together. Every dollar counts. Go ahead and donate now.\n\nChoose FOPJC\n\nKroger\n\nKroger’s Community Rewards Program is the company’s way of supporting the communities where they are located. If you have a Kroger Plus Card, you can register with the Community Rewards Program to have a contribution made to us from Kroger. It costs you nothing. Log on here and follow the prompts. Our Non-Profit Organization (NPO) is 81348. Thank you!\n\nUnited Way of South Hampton Roads\n\nWe are proud to be a United Way of South Hampton Roads Community Partner. This means during their annual workplace fund drive you can specify that your donation be sent to us. Simply write in our name. What could be simpler? Thank you!\n\nPick Up an Extra…\n\n\n\nGift Card\n\nIf you want to see a teen’s face light up, just hand them gift card to any fast-food establishment! It might be a small thing but when used to reinforce positive decisions, it’s more than a burger and fries.\n\n\n\nTidewater Regional Transit (TRT) Pass\n\nMany of the young people and families we work with lack dependable transportation. They rely on public transportation to get to appointments, school, and jobs.\n\nPurchase a Pass Here\n\nThink Outside the Box\n\n\n\nHost a special event (fundraiser)\n\nYou’ve been talking about de-cluttering. Organize a neighborhood yard sale. Everyone loves your chili with your grandfather’s secret ingredient. How about a chili cook-off?\n\n\n\nLaunch a school supply drive\n\nWherever you gather with friends, sororities, fraternities, business associations, churches, etc. is the perfect place to start a school supply drive. Put out a big box with a list of what you want and talk it up.\n\n\n\nCelebrate your birthday\n\nInstead of gifts, ask your friends and family to make a donation to FOPJC in your honor. You don’t really need another tie or pair of slippers anyway.\n\n\n\nFocus on the future\n\nSpeak to your financial advisor about options like setting up a charitable trust with FOPJC as the beneficiary or setting up a donor advised fund at a local community foundation."
