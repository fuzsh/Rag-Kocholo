        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSalt lake and its vicinity has turned out to be the hotspot for all kind of food ventures and investors are looking at this area for starting their business.\n\nKOLKATA: Bengalis are born foodies. Be it street food or high-end restaurants or fast food joints, they take gastronomic interest in every deli. Their gourmet experience is set to become even more delicious with numerous restaurants cropping up on the eastern side of the city. Salt lake and its vicinity has turned out to be the hotspot for all kind of food ventures and investors are looking at this area for starting their business.\n\n“Today, maximum clients who are entering the food business in Kolkata are opting for Salt Lake as their preferred location,” said Sinchan Chatterjee, president of Associated Hospitality Consultants India, an operating and consulting services organisation. In the last few years the area has seen tremendous growth when it comes to opening of food outlets.\n\n“Unlike earlier when finding a decent eating joint in Salt Lake was tiresome today there are more than 350 different kinds of restaurants in and around Salt Lake. Out of these almost 40 percent have come up in the last two to three years,” said Chatterjee. Bengalis have always been upfront in exploring different cuisines and tantalising their taste buds, which has played a major role in the success of the restaurants operating in the area.\n\n“There is a predominance of people from other industries venturing into the food business and are usually opting for any three of the investment categories: low investment fast and good return, moderate investment but quick return or good investment and ready to bear for sustainability period,” Chatterjee added.\n\nCORPORATE PLATTER\n\nThe Sector V of Salt Lake has not only boosted the IT sector of the city but created business opportunities for other industries, restaurants being one of them. Today every building of Sector V has restaurants, food courts or cafes that are fulfilling the gastronomic need of more than one lakh residents of the sector.\n\nBe it a cafés like Café Coffee Day or a fine dining restaurant like Red Xpress or fast food chains like KFC, Sector V has a healthy mix of eating options. Returning to their hometown from Australia, when Meera and Gaurav decided of opening a restaurant in the city their first choice was Sector V of Salt Lake. Still running three restaurants in Australia, the couple has opened their multi-cuisine restaurant a year back in Sector V and as they had expected it is the corporate crowd of the area that brings the maximum business for the restaurant.\n\n“Considering the high traffic of IT crowd it is at weekdays that we see the maximum footfall, of over 70 people in a day, out of which almost 80 percent comes from the neighbouring companies,” informed Meera Mohanty, owner of OMG Restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has also designed a 30 items lunch buffet at just Rs 450 plus tax which attracts many office goers. The Rs 3 crore investment is currently witnessing threefold increase in their business since its inception and are positive of this upward graph in their venture. Red Xpress opened its gates in 2004 and since then has been catering to the demand of the area.\n\n“When we started, Sector V was just growing and there were hardly any proper dining options in the area. Since then we have seen almost twofold growth both in the demand and in the opening of new outlets,” said Ashim Mewar, director, Red Hot Chilli Peppers. The 3,800 sq ft restaurant has also experimented and changed with the needs of the area. Mewar said, “We started with Indian and Chinese but now we have introduced salads and other cuisines also. Our buffet is a crowd puller which serves 40 items at Rs 350 plus taxes.”\n\nNot only the restaurants located in Sector V but even the ones situated in other sectors of Salt Lake are also catering to the corporate crowd. Aninda Palit, Director of 6 Ballygunge Place started his flagship Bengali cuisine restaurant at Salt Lake Sector I in 2009. The 1,500 sq ft restaurant has an average footfall of over 150 customers daily out of which almost 50 percent come from Sector V, so the corporates are pulling forward much of the food business in the area.\n\n“The main reason for taking up this location is to cater to the growing IT population of Sector V along with giving the residents of Salt Lake more culinary options,” said Palit. The restaurant has been registering a Year-on-Year growth of 28 percent.\n\nPARTY PACK\n\nNot only normal lunch but corporate bookings are also something these restaurants are making most of their profits out of. The companies usually book a section or sometimes the entire area of the restaurant and their obvious choice would be any restaurant located near their office.\n\n“Almost 90 percent of our bookings in a week are corporate bookings,” said Mohanty, who also accepted that these bookings bring in more revenue than individual dining. “Companies like IBM or TCS have the concept of corporate rewards where they take out a small group of people like 15 to 20 for a lunch treat, and we give discounts for such occasions. We also have corporate tie-ups,” informed Palit. In the last two years almost 15 new restaurants have opened up in Sector V alone thus registering more than 40 percent rise in opening of new outlets.\n\nBut if you are thinking that just opening a food outlet in the area will bring you money then you are mistaken. There also have been closing down of a few. To operate in an area like Sector V having the right strategy and model is very essential. “There have been few restaurants which have shut down, due to the inability to attract crowd. But in the same place many new have cropped up and doing well,” said Palit. Unlike other restaurants weekdays are the busiest time for the ones in Sector V while weekends register slow growth.\n\nCASUAL DINING\n\nIn search of variety not only corporates but even residents of the area are exploring eating joints. “For the restaurants in the residential sectors of Salt Lake, it is the local populace who at the end of a hectic day are reluctant to cook. They opt for a casual dining option that gives them a break from cooking at home but also doesn’t burn a hole in their pocket. It is the rise of this trend that the restaurants and eatery joints in Salt Lake are cashing on,” said Chatterjee Palit.\n\n“The instances of going out for dinner or lunch have increased in the last few years given the change in working culture and rise of nuclear families.”\n\nNEXT FOOD HUB\n\nAlong with Salt Lake, Rajarhat is also gearing up for restaurants businesses opening in the area. “The Unitech building itself has more than 10,000 people working there but not a single restaurant in the vicinity,” said Palit.\n\nAnd if we take into account the numerous residential and commercial projects that would become operational in the coming years, demand in Rajarhat will grow 5 times in the next three years. “In the next 5 years the total number of restaurants in Salt Lake and Rajarhjat will be more than 1000,” said Chatterjee.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Union Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nLearning and unlearning of Unacademy and Gaurav Munjal\n\nWhat Tata Motors looks to Curvv out with its new coupe SUV\n\nDon’t just look overseas; Indian deep-tech should mine the domestic market: Lip-Bu Tan\n\nWhy the Jammu area is becoming an epicentre of terror\n\nWhat connects Donald Trump, Nvidia share slide and Taiwan?\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
