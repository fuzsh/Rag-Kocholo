        "text": "Light Station Historical Facts…\n\nThe first lighthouse established at Portsmouth Harbor Light Station was completed in July 1771. The structure was described as a shingled wooden lighthouse with a cooper-roofed lantern. The American Revolution had a major impact on the light, especially given the fact that the beacon was built adjacent to Fort William and Mary, later named Fort Constitution after the war. During the period between 1774-1784, the tower was darkened.\n\nBy the turn of the century, a new lighthouse was deemed necessary at the station, prompting the federal government to erect an 80-foot octagonal wooden sentinel in 1804. The new site for the lighthouse was situated 100 yards east of the original beacon. The height of the second structure was an object of discussion by engineer I.W.P. Lewis in 1842 when he suggested that the lighthouse could be shortened 30 feet due to the establishment of the nearby Whaleback Light Station. Eventually, the Lighthouse Service heeded Lewis’s recommendation and shortened the tower to 55 feet in height."
