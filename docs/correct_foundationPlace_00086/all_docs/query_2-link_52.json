        "text": "A sponsorship e-mail is sent to Security requesting vendor authorization. The e-mail must include the following:\n\nSponsor contact information, Company Name, Full name, date of birth, drivers license/ID (state and number), last four social security numbers, gender, citizenship, home city, and state. Sponsorship must specify any access for work before 0700, after 1700, weekends, or holidays. This requirement aids in managing vendors challenged by Security/OOD as well as persons who may attempt to access the Base during hours they are not authorized for. Requests should be submitted at least 3 working days ahead of the visit to allow time for pre-approval using the Vendor Access Roster (below).\n\nSponsors must be onboard while vendors are present.\n\nIt is the sponsor’s responsibility to ensure all access requirements are met prior to the visitor/vendor arrival.\n\nWorkers who are not approved for this base will “scan red” and be sent to Security for vetting.\n\nVehicle Access Requirements\n\nUpon attempting to access the Base and while on board the following items are required to operate a motor vehicle:\n\nMay be issued to properly sponsored or escorted visitors who require Base access for one day and comply with section 7.d. of this instruction. All contractors and vendors must stop at Security to receive a vehicle pass. If driving a marked company vehicle the vehicle pass is not required. Vehicle passes may also be issued for temporary exceptions to documents required in section 7.d. of this instruction. This provides the member with a 24-hour grace period to produce documentation that the error is being corrected. Vehicle passes are only valid for a 24 hour period and are void when the vehicle departs the Base.\n\nExample: A vendor in a marked company vehicle who possesses a valid Rapidgate card (scanned green) may proceed directly to the front gate. If they were pre-approved (via e-mail), they may proceed directly onboard.\n\nVendors in an unmarked vehicle (i.e. POV).\n\nExample: A vendor in an unmarked vehicle who possesses a valid Rapidgate card will still have to come into the Security building to acquire a pass. If they were pre-approved (via e-mail), they may proceed directly onboard after receiving the pass.\n\nVisitors participating in special event (i.e. retirements, etc)."
