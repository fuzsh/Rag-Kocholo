        "text": "Amethyst Foundation is OPEN for business.\n\nPlease see our COVID-19 Response page for updated information on operations during this time.\n\nAmethyst Foundation, Inc. is a private, non-profit organization that has offered professional substance abuse education, intervention and evaluation to individuals, courts, probation officers and other organizations since 1981. The administrative offices and residential facility are located in Epping, New Hampshire, which is readily accessible to residents of New Hampshire and other New England states.\n\nAmethyst Foundation has satellite locations for screening/intake interviews, class sessions, Addiction Severity Index (ASI) administration, and substance evaluations and service plan development in several other New Hampshire towns. Its WIDEP (Weekend Program) is certified by the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services and is accepted by almost all other states as an approved alternative for DWI/DUI education/intervention.\n\nImportant Note: Attendance at self-help groups (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) is NEVER mandated by Amethyst Foundation. Self-Help may be recommended to clients as a support system but attendance is NEVER mandatory. No client is ever required to attend self-help meetings.\n\nEffective January 1, 2013, New Hampshire has dramatically changed the process for DWI/DUI offenses. This only applies to:\n\nNew Hampshire DWI convictions\n\nConvictions from other states that are recorded on an individualâ€™s New Hampshire record as a DWI/DUI.\n\nOut-of-State Convictions: If your conviction occurred in another state, most of this process does not apply to you. You would only have the same three components as before:\n\nIntake (typically done on the Friday that you arrive)\n\nEducational sessions (now called IDEP rather than IDIP)\n\nSummary Report/Evaluation (sent to you following attendance)\n\nPlease carefully review the changes on this website. The current applicable New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rule is He-A 500.\n\nYou can find He-A 500 in its entirety in our Forms section."
