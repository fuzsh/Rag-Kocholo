        "text": "Matthew Walter\n\nHead of School\n\n\"Our mission of helping young men and women grow in knowledge and grace challenges us to be our best. For me, that means being the best Catholic boarding school in North America with a global reach that attracts the best and brightest from around the world. At Portsmouth Abbey, we continue to build on the School’s already stellar reputation for academic excellence in the Catholic intellectual tradition, innovative electives, competitive athletics, and inspirational arts. Bolstered by our traditions of the past and reassured by the accomplishments of today, we look boldly to Portsmouth Abbey’s bright future and are poised for a second century of excellence.\"\n\nBo '24 and Becca '24\n\nClass of 2024, Head Boy and Head Girl\n\n\"We are thrilled to be the Head Boy and Head Girl for the 2023-2024 school year! The Abbey is an incredibly special place for both of us, and we have each grown into the people we are today because of it. We hope to lead the student body to share our experience, and we look forward to working alongside the students and faculty to bring the school to new heights. We look forward to growing in knowledge and grace together this year.\"\n\nMichael St. Thomas\n\nChair, English Department\n\nAbbey students approach their studies with a combination of enthusiasm and maturity that I’ve not seen elsewhere. In my English classes, I witness this in their ability to sustain serious conversations in class and develop original insights in their writing. They never fail to impress me with their ability to take what we read to heart. As a teacher of the liberal arts, I couldn’t ask for more from my students or my school. In my subject, being a Raven means being part of a community that actively engages with the great literature of the past and present.\n\nMrs. Susan McCarthy\n\nScience Department\n\n\"I love being a Raven! Our students are full of wonder and curiosity and love to learn and make scientific discoveries. In Green Chemistry, my students have embarked on their independent research endeavors and have accomplished things that I never would have imagined in a high school setting. \"\n\nChidozie Onyiuke\n\nClass of 2010, Loyola University of Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine\n\n\"The Abbey’s faculty are terrific. I’m so grateful to my teachers and my basketball coach, Mr. Chenoweth. They helped me establish a strong academic foundation and taught me solid time-management skills. To be honest, after the full schedule of coursework and sports I juggled at the Abbey, I felt like I had more free time in college than in high school... Physicians seek to find the truth with respect to their patients’ mental and physical wellbeing, so if you want to be a great physician, you need to treat body and soul. I spent a week in Lourdes, providing care for pilgrims and assisting them in visiting the holy sites. As a physician, you’re primarily focused on your patient’s physical concerns, but when I witnessed the expressions on the faces of pilgrims who travelled to Lourdes seeking healing from the waters, I realized that there’s also a large spiritual component to consider. Attending to a patient’s emotions is as important to the healing process as treating his physical ailments.\"\n\nKaitlyn Soares\n\nClass of 2007, Communications & Outreach at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n\n\"When reflecting on my four years at the Abbey, I find that exposure to a well-rounded curriculum and genuine care from faculty helped me discover where my talents thrive. Father Ambrose’s English class specifically comes to mind. He was truly invested in my development as a writer, taking extended time to explain his edits and advice. He taught me that failure is an opportunity to realize what isn’t working and to open new avenues of approach – a lesson that helped me clear a new path to Jet Propulsion Laboratory after my first application was unsuccessful.\"\n\nPart of our mission is to live in a community that values each of its members. This enables students to better understand themselves and the world around them. We celebrate our achievements and we offer help to those in need in an effort to make this a more gracious community."
