        "text": "Rivers Casino and Rush Street Gaming have a longstanding history of supporting the communities in which we operate. We have branded this ongoing initiative as âRivers Gives.â\n\nThe key pillars of Rivers Gives are volunteerism, board service, donation drives, in-kind contributions and corporate giving.Â\n\nThrough Rivers Gives, each Rivers Casino annually contributes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours per property to local nonprofit partners. Across their operating markets, Rivers Casino and Rush Street Gaming annually contribute approximately $14 million to local nonprofit partners and various community groups.\n\nSafety Town is a partnership between Portsmouth's education, law enforcement, and legislative bodies designed to teach school-aged children how to be safe in our community. Safety Town provides a safe and interesting learning environment that is set up to simulate an actual neighborhood. Rivers Casino Portsmouth funded and helped build Safety Town's newest exhibit - a miniature police station. This exhibit is a nod to the strong partnership between Rivers Casino Portsmouth and the Portsmouth Police Department.\n\nRoc Solid Foundation builds hope for kids fighting cancer nationwide through the power of play. The organization distributes Ready Bags to families just after they hear the devastating news that their child has cancer, and also provides backyard playsets to kids during treatment. Rivers Casino Portsmouth Team Members regularly volunteer with Roc Solid to help them assemble Ready Bags, and Rivers helps fund Roc Solids critical mission.\n\nRivers Casino Portsmouth has partnered with the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore since pre-opening. Our Team Members have collectively volunteered over 200 hours with the Foodbank. Rivers has also donated food and funds to help those in our community who need it most. Rivers Casino Portsmouth is proud of our support of the Foodbank's mission to eliminate hunger in our community."
