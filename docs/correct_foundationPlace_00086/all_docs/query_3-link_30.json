        "text": "Transport bosses have drawn up a list of Greater Manchester bus services that could be boosted or saved thanks to a new £1.6m pot of cash.\n\nIn a rousing speech about a public transport revolution, Boris Johnson last month announced a £220m national pot for bus services.\n\nOf that, £30m has been earmarked for authorities outside London to restore lost bus routes where most needed, extend existing ones or launch new services.\n\nAccording to a letter sent to MPs by Transport for Greater Manchester, the region has been allocated up to £1.59m from the fund.\n\nIt may be the biggest such share in the country, but transport bosses here have warned it is a 'relatively small amount of one-off funding' which will limit the 'scope and scale' of plans.\n\nBut to secure the funding, authorities now have to complete 'statements of intent' outlining how Greater Manchester Combined Authority will use the funding for the community.\n\nFor each area, transport bosses have drawn up a recommended list of potential services to save or boost.\n\nThe list could prove controversial. For example, some services, such as the 375 Stockport to Mellor route - the only route to the most remote village in Greater Manchester which was axed last month - does not feature.\n\nAlison Chew, TfGM’s interim Head of Bus Services, said: \"We have been working with bus operators, local authorities and the Greater Manchester Transport Committee to identify services that might be suitable for this funding, under the government’s Better Deal for Bus Users programme.\n\n\"As part of the process, and to ensure that our submission delivers the best outcome for the region’s bus users, we are also consulting with all Greater Manchester MPs.\"\n\nShe stressed that this list was 'long and subject to change', adding \"not all may be able to benefit from additional funding of up to circa £1.6m.\"\n\nHere are the services that could change, broken down by area:\n\nBolton\n\nService 8, Bolton-Manchester: Introduction of night journeys\n\nService 471, Bolton-Bury-Rochdale: Introduction of early morning journeys\n\nService 524, Bolton-Little Lever-Radcliffe-Bury: Increased evening frequency to every 30 minutes\n\nService 38, Manchester-Logistics North: Extension of some daytime journeys from Logistics North to Bolton, providing regular link including RBH\n\nService 273, Rawtenstall-Ramsbottom-Bolton: Introduction of hourly off-peak service, restoring previous links\n\nBury\n\nService 95, Bury-Salford: Extension to Salford Quays\n\nService 135, Bury-Manchester: Extension to 24 hours\n\nService 273, Rawtenstall-Ramsbottom-Bolton: Introduction of hourly off-peak service, restoring previous links\n\nServices 472/474, Bury-Ramsbottom circulars: Increased evening frequency to every 30 minutes\n\nService 524, Bolton-Little Lever-Radcliffe-Bury: Increased frequency to every 30 minutes\n\nService X41, Accrington-Prestwich-Manchester: Retention of service\n\nService 97/98, Bury-Manchester: Introduction of early morning journeys\n\nService 471, Bolton-Bury-Rochdale: Introduction of early morning journeys\n\nManchester\n\nServices 216 and 219, Manchester-Ashton: Additional late night trips on Fridays and Saturdays to bridge gap between current evening and night services\n\nService 34, Leigh-Manchester: Additional early Monday-Friday journeys\n\nService 33, Manchester-Worsley: Extension of route beyond Worsley to RHS Bridgewater, Boothstown and Tyldesley\n\nService 59, Manchester-Middleton-Oldham: Introduction of later evening trips\n\nService 84, Manchester-Uppermill: Introduction of later evening trips\n\nService 17, Rochdale-Manchester: Additional am/pm journeys to operate to Stakehill\n\nService 8, Bolton-Manchester: Introduction of night journeys\n\nService 17, Rochdale-Manchester: Introduction of night journeys\n\nService 97/98, Bury-Manchester: Introduction of early morning journeys\n\nService 19, Altrincham-Sale-Wythenshawe: Earlier Saturday morning journeys\n\nService 25, Stockport-intu Trafford Centre: Earlier Saturday/Sunday journeys\n\nService 201, Manchester-Gorton-Denton-Hyde-Hattersley: Extend hours to operate 24 hours\n\nService 103, World Freight Terminal to Manchester Piccadilly: Extend hours to operate 24-hour service\n\nServices 56 and 156, Manchester-Middleton: Extension of short journeys to serve Middleton and provide through service on all journeys via NMGH\n\nService 83, Oldham-Manchester: Additional Monday to Saturday evening journeys, restoring previous frequency of every 20 minutes (combined 10 minute with other services)\n\nService 135, Bury-Manchester: Extension of service up to 24 hours\n\nService 38, Manchester-Logistics North: Extension of some daytime journeys from Logistics North to Bolton, providing regular link including RBH\n\nService 83, Oldham-Manchester: Introduction of daily 24 hour service every 30 minutes, plugging gap between existing\n\nevening and early morning trips (currently 0500-000)\n\nX41 -

It's unclear if the money made available for this last month will be deducted from the new pot.\n\nThe list has been finalised according to a set of 'assessment criteria'. This includes whether the service can pay for itself long term, social inclusion and how it fits in with the rest of the network.\n\nMPS have been invited to make their own suggestions on routes they would like to see saved or boosted.\n\nJames Daly, Bury North MP said he is now encouraging his constituents to tell him which routes they would like to see reinstated or boosted.\n\nHe added: \"I'm happy that the money is being invested in Bury North bus services, happy about extra connectivity, but not happy at the proposals for changes in the constituencies.\"\n\nMr Daly said he would like to see more links between villages in Bury North - rather than just services connecting Bury with other towns and Manchester.\n\nHe added: \"In particular, a route between Ramsbottom and Bury, a route between Bury and Pilsworth. I want more regular and better services within Bury North.\n\n\"I don't think the current proposal goes far enough but I'm very pleased that positive steps are being taken for bus service provision and better connectivity.\"\n\nMr Daly, who said he would also like clarity on how much money will be spent in his seat, added he would feed his constituents' views back to TfGM."
