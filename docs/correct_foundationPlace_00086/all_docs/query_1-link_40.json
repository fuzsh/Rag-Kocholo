        "text": "Fit: Cover your natural nail with each press-on to find your perfect size, ensuring you align the number with your natural nail tip.\n\nShape: Do you with custom shapes and lengths using the Shape Up side of your file.\n\nPrep: Clip or file nails as needed and lightly buff your nail surface. Remove dust and debris from nails with the Prep to xPRESS pad, the gently push back cuticles.\n\nxPRESS: Remove glue cap and gently squeeze the bottle. For longer wear, apply glue to the back of your press-on nail and your natural nail. For short term wear, only apply glue to your press-on nail.\n\nPRO TIP: To ensure durability, press and hold for 30 seconds applying pressure on all sides of the nail. If glue seeps out from under your press-ons, quickly clean it up using your Cuticle Stick. No sweat removal: Soak your nails in warm water for 10 minutes and apply a small amount of acetone to nail base using a cotton swab. Then gently lift press-ons with your Cuticle Stick."
