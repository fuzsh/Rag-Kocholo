        "text": "Article by Jinx Prowse (CEO of Music Fusion)\n\nMusic Fusion were delighted when the University of Portsmouth Creative Industries Faculty agreed to supply us with a group of film students and equipment to document one of our projects. The project was based around Youth Justice and gave 50 young people the chance to research, write and record an album called ‘Mavericks’. Our young people had all experienced ‘challenging life circumstances’ which ranged from feeling anxious, depressed, self-harming and suicidal. A large proportion of the young people involved were either criminally active or within the youth judicial system. The point of the album was to demonstrate that you don’t have to follow what everyone else is doing, choose your own path…. be a maverick.\n\nThe project was run by experienced staff and partners who understand our young people’s circumstances. Often the young people’s stories are to be honest… heart breaking. At Music Fusion we take nothing for granted. We do not try and guess at a young person’s background just from their looks. Sometimes confident, well dressed young people can still be at high risk.\n\nOne of the unexpected outcomes from this project was the relationship between the student film crew and our young people. The film crew were not much older than our young people. They came from an international background and were well educated. Music Fusion gave them some autonomy over the production which included what questions to ask.\n\nImagine my surprise when footage started to come in from the first days shooting including interviews with young people like Jay. Jay was on day release from a young people’s secure unit. The interview was her first time out of a secure unit in 7 months. To my horror the students asked the seemingly innocuous question, “What has been your biggest achievement in life?”\n\nJay was 16 years old, had no family, missed out on the chance to get any qualifications and was in a secure unit. Jay’s response was no surprise to Music Fusion, however her answer left the student film crew speechless. After a very long pause Jay replied, “Just being me. I don’t have qualifications or people telling me what their proud of me about, so I’m kinda proud of myself for being true to myself. I think that’s a good thing.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VCEolJ3dUB0?t=45s\n\nJays response threw the film students. I think out of panic they just carried on with their questions. The second question was, “What are you looking forward to in the future?” Jay replied, “For me just getting from A-B. And having a bit of fun in between. It’s a lot easier said than done at the moment. If I can get to B, I should be alright.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/VCEolJ3dUB0?t=2m25s\n\nThis demonstrated the huge disconnect between young people in mainstream education and the young people Music Fusion work with.\n\nThe project ran for 9 months. In this time the film crew became an integral part of the team. I would turn up to the studio in the morning to see the film crew asleep in the corner after a busy nights filming. When the building was locked up at the end of the day, the film crew were the last ones out. The students became utterly invested in what the project was trying to achieve. In the end they became indistinguishable from the young people.\n\nWhen the project had finished and all the footage had been delivered and cut I thanked the students for their time and hard work. They had literally delivered 1000% more than the brief had asked. To my surprise their reply was also “thank you”. The whole student team thanked me individually and gave me a hug.\n\nIt turns out that the students had genuinely invested their time, hearts and minds to the social action of the project. They felt that, not only were they accessing their own education, but they were achieving something of greater value. They had made a connection with the project ideals and the young people. They had, in partnership with our young people, generated real, evidencable social capital.\n\nThe students and our young people come from very different worlds. This live brief with the University of Portsmouth enabled us to build a bridge between those two worlds. We all walked away from the project better people, having learned something about human nature, respect and most importantly when not to ask questions…. but to just listen instead.\n\nThis is what happens if we just listen - https://youtu.be/5v-qeBqgibo?t=3m43s\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMusic Fusion rely more and more on the good will of the public to fund our work.
