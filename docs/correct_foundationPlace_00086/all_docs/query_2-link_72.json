        "text": "Single Family Home Permit Guidelines\n\nThis list is a guide to the requirements for a building permit for a single-family house in Portsmouth, RI. Many properties and projects have unique restrictions and may require additional documentation not on this list.\n\nSITE PLAN - The Site Plan should show the location of the house with dimensions to the property lines, Soil Erosion Control Plan and Septic design layout. Some sites will require coastal information or flood zone information. If in a flood zone, we require an Elevation Certificate prior to issuance of a permit.\n\nBUILDING PLANS - Building plans should include: foundation plan, floor plans, elevations, cross sections and construction details. These plans shall be drawn to scale and have sufficient information to relay the scope of work and that it will meet code. Additionally if there are any engineered beams (LVL) or trusses, we require a layout plan and related calculations.\n\nADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION - If your property has any special restrictions, such as an approved variance(s) or coastal ascents, they shall be submitted. Coastal properties may also require shear wall bracing, engineered foundations with breakaway walls and Elevation Certificates.\n\nLOT RESTRICTIONS - Small lots or tight lots may require as-built to verify the proper location on the property prior to the framing stage. Likewise, houses that are pushing the height restriction may require a height as-built when the ridge is framed.\n\nIMPACT FEES - Lots that have been created (subdivided) after 2003 are subjected to an impact fee prior to issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy."
