        "text": "Portsmouth Rotary News Briefs\n\nKrempels Center Barbecue Volunteers Needed\n\nBria Day is working with Ashley Healy, Director of Development at the David Krempels Brain Injury Center, to put on a BBQ there Wednesday, August 14th. Volunteers are needed. Here are the specifics:\n\nLocation: Community Campus, 100 Campus Drive, Portsmouth, NH (front lawn)\n\nDate: Wednesday, August 14, 2024 (rain or shine)\n\nTime: 11am-3pm\n\n# of volunteers needed: 10\n\nResponsibilities: Set up of tables, food, work the grill (bring a grill and/or we will rent one), monitor lawn games, clean up\n\nKBIC Staff must help members with staying hydrated, lawn games, food, etc. so volunteers to help cook and set up/cleanup would be appreciated. If you are interested, please contact Bria at b.day@easternbank.com\n\nSalvation Army Food Service\n\nThe nightly Salvation Army soup kitchen sets up in this Emergency Disaster Services truck and parks under the lights at the back of the Middle Street Baptist Church at 18 Court St, Portsmouth. Two volunteers arrive at 4:50 pm and work inside the truck (with heaters) to put the hot food into containers to give out to diners through the window. Dinner starts at 5:00 pm and is over at 6:00 pm. We clean up and are finished by 6:15 pm. Our Club has signed up to serve every third Wednesday of the month for the next 11 months. Please text me, Sara Treacy, at 603-661-8588 if you can sign up.\n\nJuly 17 - Chad and Darlene Chadwick\n\nAugust 21 - Kristen Petersen and Dianne Brindisi\n\nSeptember 18 - Ramona Dow and Jerry Dionne\n\nOctober 16 - Ben Wheeler and Doug MacDonald\n\nPlease contact Sara Treacy if interested in participating for future dates & Thanks!\n\nAs we knew it would, the first meeting of new President Midge Nelsonâs year went off without a hitch. After guiding us through the Pledge, Peter Muccia directed the Four Way Test.\n\nBarb Millerâs invocation called for dedication to trust, ethics and fellowship.\n\nInstead of a song we were entertained by PMAC Jazz Camp students performing with just three daysâ practice. The 11-member ensemble played enthusiastically. At least one band person, PHS Sophomore Valere Logan-Barre, owns a full PMAC scholarship. A Jeremy Alex Music Scholarship that is.\n\nThere were numerous guests and visiting Rotarians, here in part for the Vocational Awards program.\n\nDon Chick noted that volunteers are needed at the Community Campus for the Krempelâs Center cookout on August 14 from 11-3 p.m. Bria is organizing this event.\n\nMidge very kindly thanked me and the Rotations for our rendition of âLike A Rainbowâ at Yvonneâs Changing of the Guard. Here Iâd inject that outgoing Dover Rotary President Kathy Finkâs musical direction helped the group sing in harmony for the first time. Yay!\n\nNext Midge introduced the new Board of Directors. In brief, Ian OâNeail is our president-elect and Peter Muccia is Vice President. We are blessed with a strong compliment of good leaders. You can find the entire roster on the clubâs web page.\n\nCaitlyn Hassett was MC for todayâs program, the Annual Vocational Awards, celebrating one of Rotaryâs Five Avenues of Service. For the record, those avenues are Club Service, Community Service, Youth Service, International Service and Vocational Service.\n\nThe nominating committee of Lexi Leddy, Mark Lorusso, Norm Olsen, and Ted Alex sifted through a robust field of nominations. Ultimately, they selected honorees in each of the four vocational service categories: Public Service, Education, Health and Human Services and a General category.\n\nThese folks, who truly walk the walk and talk the talk, received a plaque and $500 dollars to donate to their favorite charity.\n\nDon Chick presented the General Category Award to Elaine Menard, president of the Rochester Fellowship Kitchen. Sheâs been involved with this group for about 12 years. The RFK has teams of volunteers who serve as many as 100 meals four nights a week.\n\nThe organization often provides more than 20,000 meals a year. Elaine dedicates herself to the cause while being a full-time educator and mom to three children.\n\nâI am honored to accept this award,â she said, âon behalf of all the volunteers who work so hard.â\n\nElaineâs cash award will go to, obviously, the RFK.\n\nGabe Weinrieb, Ericâs son and former PHS student, introduced the Education category winner, Heather Wheeler. Ms. Wheeler is an environmental science teacher at PHS. She was nominated by Eric and Ben Wheeler, who is no relation to Heather.\n\nâSheâs kind, friendly and a great listener,â Gabe said. âI never wanted to miss her class. Her passion for teaching inspires others.â\n\nâThatâs one of the kindest things anyone has ever said about me,â Heather said. âItâs the students working effort that makes everything bloom. I couldnât feel more honored.â\n\nHeather revived the PHS school garden and greenhouse prompting students of all ages to get involved with environmental science. Her holistic style of teaching engaged students, capturing their imaginations with a challenging curriculum.\n\nHeatherâs classroom is always filled with little chicks chirping and bees buzzing, as they help revive the PHS garden. Her check will be donated to Footprints.\n\nPortsmouth Public Works Director Peter Rice (no relation to the Log Writer) presented the Public Service Award to Mike Sullivan.\n\nThe nominee of James Petersen and Karen Conard, Mike has been with public works since 1986. He began his career on the back of a sanitation truck and now drives one as well as most of the cityâs equipment. City residents have acknowledged his hard work and friendliness.\n\nMike is also a huge fan of the cityâs dogs and greets them with a milk bone. If for some reason a canine misses his stop, Mike leaves a bone on the cover of the can.\n\nâMike will do pretty much anything you ask him to do,â Peter Rice said. âHe has a positive attitude towards everyone, and dogs love him. Itâs nice to acknowledge someone who works as hard as he does.â\n\nMikeâs check goes to Gather.\n\nFinally, Caitlyn herself presented the Health and Human Services Award to Bill and Diana DaGiau of Annieâs Angels. They were nominated by the late Marie Brownell, who was passionate about this organization. Its mission is to help New Hampshire families struggling with life threatening disease, illness, or disability.\n\nSince 2007, Annieâs Angels has been connecting neighbor to neighbor, friend to friend and business to business, raising more than $5.5 million dollars. They have filled some 8,848 requests as of this writing with folks already contributing more than 4,000 volunteer hours annually.\n\nâItâs a good thing I did know I was going to talk,â said Bill DaGiau, brushing away tears. âMarie loved being a âlight in the darkness.â Sheâs helped us for 17 years. Itâs an honor to keep Marieâs passion alive.â\n\nThe organization has never said no to a family who meets their mission and needs help. Not surprisingly, Bill and Diana are giving their check to Annieâs Angels.\n\nAnd thus ended an excellent program. Norm Olsen will assume Caitlynâs leadership spot next year.\n\nNo Log would be complete without naming our 50-50 raffle winner, who was Conrad. The incurable Buckeye fan donated his $20-dollar prize back to the club as happy dollars. And there being no match, the $250 bonus rolls over.\n\nEXTRA POINTâSay, do you need to spice up your creative life? Consider joining our merry band of Log writers or the Blessings Corps. Itâs as easy as sending me, Juan Arroz, an email at jwrice460@gmail.com and weâll do the rest!\n\nRespectfully submitted, Juan Arroz\n\nPhotos by Don Chic"
