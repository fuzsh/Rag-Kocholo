Phishing

Certain individuals may attempt to obtain your personal financial information by suggesting you will experience an unfortunate event, or miss an opportunity such as a prize or an award, if you don’t supply them with your personal information immediately. Do not provide financial information to anyone calling or emailing you. Unless you initiated the contact, never provide personal information, including your Social Security Number, bank account details, credit card number or passwords over the phone, email, or internet.

Red Star Plc does not contact individuals to request their personal information. And we will never send you an email or call you claiming we’ve lost your records or are updating them or you should make payment of any form. If you are unsure whether a Red Star communication is legitimate, go to the company’s website by directly typing in the website address www.redstarplc.com instead of using any link provided in the email. If in doubt, a safe alternative is to contact Red Star Plc directly on our phone number 01-2715670-6 or email address enquiries@redstarplc.com
