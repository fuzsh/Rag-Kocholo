PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Portsmouth-based financial advisor Andrew C. Lord, CLU, ChFC, has succeeded Adrian P. Baker, Dip PFS, as the 58th President of the MDRT Foundation.

Lord takes the reins after many years of dedicated volunteering to support the MDRT Foundation’s various initiatives. He will help oversee the expansion of the Foundation’s efforts globally as MDRT membership continues to expand and diversify, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. These efforts will include greater linguistic and cultural inclusivity across grant programs and volunteer opportunities, and a shift toward social-media-driven fundraising.

Lord has deep roots in charitable work, starting with the legacy of his parents’ support of hospice patients and people with Parkinson’s disease. He has continually donated to and volunteered with MDRT Foundation efforts since attending his first MDRT Annual Meeting in 1988. Lord also successfully sponsored the charity Seeds of Peace, which brings together Israeli and Palestinian children for summer camps in the U.S., for an MDRT Foundation grant. The grant led to Seeds of Peace becoming the official charity partner for the 2004 MDRT Annual Meeting.

A 35-year MDRT member, Lord has served in leadership roles on the MDRT Foundation’s Grants, Finance and Corporate Giving committees. He joined the MDRT Foundation Board of Trustees in 2018.

“After many years of intentionally working to increase the time I spend volunteering, I’m honored to be trusted with the leadership of such an effective organization,” Lord said. “I’m consistently in awe of the charitable nature of MDRT members year after year, and I’m excited to continue contributing to the MDRT Foundation’s work in 2024 and beyond.”
