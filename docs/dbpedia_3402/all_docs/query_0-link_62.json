        "text": "§ (4.29.) MR. J. ROWLANDS (Finsbury, E.)\n\nrose to call attention to the Livery Franchise of the City of London; and to move— That, in the opinion of this House, the time has arrived when the Government should, in accordance with the recommendation of the Report of the City Livery Charities Commission, take action to abolish the anomalous franchise now possessed by the Liverymen of the City of London, which gives a vote to persons who have no direct residential or business connection with the city, and thus increases the evils arising from the defective state of the Registration laws, whereby many 159 persons are prevented from becoming qualified electors, while others become entitled to a plurality of votes. The hon. Member said: This is a question which has not been brought before the House for some considerable time. On the last occasion it was brought forward by the hon. Member for Gateshead (Mr. James) in the year 1879. I shall have to trouble the House with a short history of this franchise, but I can promise that I will not go into any lengthened detail. At one time the 74 Companies that existed in the City had an actual life and being in connection with the crafts they represented. At the present time there are 12 great or wealthy Companies, owning a large amount of property, possessing most of them magnificent halls, and having a close livery. It is not to any great extent with them that we have to deal this evening. Besides these, however, there are 62 companies, which are known as the minor companies. Most of them are not at all wealthy, many of them have no permanent residences of their own; the fee for entering their liveries is a moderate one, and the liveries with their privileges are used as sources of revenue to the companies. I hope to be able to demonstrate to the House that this granting of the privileges of the livery for sums of money is not only detrimental to the life of the companies themselves, but leads to the manufacture of faggot-votes for the city of London. The origin of the Guilds is known, I believe, to all Members of the House. In early days they were representative of and had control of their particular crafts. They filled much the same position in connection with the commerce of the City of London as the chambers of commerce and trades' unions fill to-day. They dealt with all questions in connection with their crafts. How far they have fallen away from that position is well-known, and I think if you were to take the list of liverymen to-day you would find that many of the companies have no connection whatever with the crafts they are supposed to represent. It is most amusing to me on St. Thomas's Day to Bee a watchmaker putting in a plea for election as member of, say, the Spectacle Makers' Company on the ground that he is a watchmaker. There are few freemen 160 who are members of the craft with which the company is nominally connected, and still fewer who have obtained admission to the livery by that which ought to be the only legitimate means, namely, that of having served an apprenticeship to the craft. The companies had many privileges down to a certain period of their history, but it is a good many years ago since they virtually lost all power over their trade. There are one or two of them which have some connection with the industries they are supposed to represent, and I am pleased to say there are one or two others which, whilst they have no legal control over their trades, still take some interest in the technical development of those trades. There are four means by which a person can become a member of one of these companies. The first is apprenticeship, the second patrimony, the third redemption or purchase, and the fourth election out of compliment in the case of a man of distinction. I think the Grocers' Company is only one to which admission cannot be obtained by purchase. Entrance by means of apprenticeship has largely ceased to be employed on account of the corruption of the apprenticeship system. There are, however, still many of the companies that keep up the system of apprenticeship, although they do not necessarily have what are technically known as City apprentices. But I am sorry to say that in connection with this honourable means of getting into companies very great abuses have sprung up. Persons are nominally apprenticed and, without having served in the trade, are at the end of seven years admitted to the livery upon the testimony of their nominal masters that they have served their time. This I look upon as a very dishonest means of admission to a company. The person who thus enters a company does not, however, at once become a liveryman. In the larger companies it is difficult to get into the livery, but some of the smaller companies go about touting for liverymen with the object of getting the 25 or 30 guineas that are paid as an admission fee. The governing body of a City Company is called the Court of Assistants or the Court of Wardens, and is appointed from the livery. I am not going to trouble the 161 House by referring to the many Charters by which various privileges were given to City Companies. I will simply say that about the year 1435, the liverymen were given the right of voting for Members of Parliament for the City of London. At that time the City of London was really London, and within the city walls throbbed the life of the Metropolis. The banker lived over his counting-house, the artisan over his workshop, and the merchant over his warehouse. The franchise was then absolutely a popular franchise and one which could only be illustrated to-day by referring to our own system of household suffrage. It meant that all engaged in the various occupations and trades had a right to vote because they belong to a Guild and wore its livery. Of such a franchise as that no one could possibly complain, but what is the state of things now? These Guilds have lost their hold upon particular industries. Within the square mile of the City the life of London does not exist to-day. It has gone far beyond, and those who carry on the various avocations to-day do not think it necessary to belong to the Guilds. We have an entirely altered state of things in the City. Those who lived in the City of London in byegone times simply carry on business there now, and those who carry on business there have a qualification which gives them a dual suffrage, and I do not know why, whilst they are liverymen, they should have any other vote than that of liverymen. Yet this franchise is enjoyed, not only by these persons, but by persons who have no connection whatever with the City of London, directly or indirectly, and who do not live within its walls. The charters of these Companies in many cases limited the number of liverymen, and the Court of Common Council has done the same. But I want to call attention to this peculiar anomaly: As a rule it is considered that it is this House which increases the number of electors under any qualification, but in the case of these Companies it is not the House that extends the number of liverymen. It actually rests with the Court of Aldermen to say whether the number of liverymen in a particular company shall be increased. I would trouble the House with an illustration 162 of this taken from the proceedings of the Court of Aldermen itself. In the year 1880 a Report was brought up from the General Purposes Committee of the Court of Aldermen upon a Petition from the Needle Makers' Company for an increase in the number of their livery. At the formation of the Company the number was fixed at 50. The Report suggested that the number should be increased to 100, and that the fee for admission should be increased from £5 10s. to 25 guineas. In the discussion that took place some of the City fathers protested strongly against the proposed increase. The Report of the General Purposes Committee of the Court of Aldermen having recommended an increase of 100, an Amendment was moved that the number should be 200. Sir Thomas Gabriel protested against the proposal, which amounted to a sale of votes for the City at 25 guineas apiece in the interest of a Company that might be in want of money; and another gentleman not unknown to this House—Alderman Sir Andrew Lusk—described the proceeding as the \"creation of new faggot-votes at a cost of 25 guineas each.\" But, in spite of the wise advice of these and other gentlemen, the Court of Aldermen passed the Amendment, and created 200 new liverymen of one Company, and, be it observed, this is by no means one of the 12 large City Companies. Does any hon. or right hon. Gentleman here think that is a state of things which can be depended on? Does the House think that the right of voting for Members of this honourable House ought to be bartered away in that manner? Does it not think that there should be a substantial reason for a qualification—a much stronger one than the mere poverty of one of these Companies who want something to put into their coffers, and get that something for a sum which, to the wealthy nonentities who seek the livery, is a miserable pittance. The average gross annual increase in the number of persons on the livery is 500, but this figure is reduced to about 133 owing to deaths and objections sustained in the Revising Barrister's Court. A most extraordinary feature of the increase of the livery was that it took place mainly since the election of 1868. Was the motive of those responsible for the 163 increase a desire to influence the representation of the City? I shall probably be told, as Mr. Alderman Cotton said when the question was brought forward on a former occasion by the hon. Member for Gateshead:— That two-thirds or three-fourths of the liverymen had votes independent of their freemanship in respect of premises which they occupied in the City. I have no doubt that point will be raised again, and that we shall be told \"Well, it is quits true that a number of persons are on the franchise of the City for the livery, but if they were not in it in that way, they ought to be in some other way.\" Let us consider whether this statement is well founded. An analysis has been made of the present register of the City of London. It contains 32,728 electors. If the 629 county electors are deducted there is a register of 32,099 electors. The total number of livery votes included in that figure is 7,756, and deducting 1,950 voters who appear on the occupier's list, there are left on the register a total of 5,806 voters who have no qualification as owners of business premises or as residents. That is a little circumstance that requires to be got over. We are told \"Oh! it is true that an anomaly exists, it is a survival of the fittest, and does not do much damage\" As I have said, there has been an extraordinary development of the Livery Vote since the election of 1868. I will not trouble the House with many figures, but I should just like to mention what the increase has been since that date. I will give one or two examples of the way in which the voting power has gone up in connection with some of the minor companies—for I am not bringing a charge of a large increase against the larger companies, who are too Conservative to add to their numbers. The Basket Makers' in 1868 had one registered liveryman; in 1885, 27; and in 1891, 29. The Fan Makers' had 13 in 1868, 102 in 1885, 103 in 1891. The Framework Knitters' in the same years 21, 65, and 77; the Glovers', 34, 12, and 91; the Horners' 8, 11, and 41; the Needle Makers' 47, 104, and 83; the Pattern Makers', 20, 40, and 40; the Shipwrights' 26, 188, and 185; and the Tinplate Workers', 9, 65, and 56. In 1868 there were 6,131 persons on the 164 Register for the City with a livery qualification; the number rose in 1885, and now it stands at 7,756. These figures speak for themselves. They are very interesting, and show the way in which the franchise is still increasing. I maintain that it is indefensible, and ought to have been abolished years ago. The livery franchise ought really to have been swept away in 1832, when the Reform Act was passed, and when a great number of these franchises were discontinued. Unfortunately, instead of being put an end to, the privileges of registered liverymen were enlarged under that Act, and also subsequently under the Representation of the People Act of 1867, the residential qualification being extended from a seven mile radius to a 25 mile radius of the City. In all parts of the country, except the City of London, a person to have a vote under a non-residential qualification must reside within seven miles of his business premises, but in the City of London, instead of seven miles, you have a radius of 25 miles, which takes in a large part of the country, and enables the register of the City to be swelled enormously. The City is already over-represented, and if it were treated like suburban constituencies the non-residential electors would have to go, and it would be impossible to make the register up to 32,000. Then it would be impossible for the City to claim two representatives, as compared with other parts of the country. Put London in the same position as other constituencies, and how does it stand? The unfortunate lodger who has to move into the next street is disqualified. The lodger qualification is a delusion, a snare, and a fraud to those unfortunate people who cannot take the whole of a house, and where they come under the absurd definition of lodgers, and by which they are robbed continually of the right to elect Members of this House. The City is the spoiled child of this House, and I await with a great deal of interest the defence which the representatives of the City may make against this fancy franchise of theirs. A man may have premises outside the City, and he has his vote as a City Liveryman, and he has his residential vote. And this is the way in which they create a legitimate representation 165 of the people on great Imperial questions which are decided at the General Election. One defence of this is that it is ancient. It is ancient. Good in its origin, I will admit; now entirely superseded. We do not defend everything ancient. We do not believe a system of taxation good because it may have existed since the time of Elizabeth, though there are some illustrious people in this country who hold that opinion. It is said that liverymen are freeholders, and if that is so, every freeman of one of the large and wealthy companies is also a freeholder, because he is interested in the property of his company just as much as a liveryman. If that defence is put forward, you must be prepared to go a little further and ask for the qualification of the freemen of the City Companies as well as the City Liverymen. I do not know what defence can be put forward. I admit there is something sentimental in the defence of the representation of the Universities, by which learning is represented in this House—though in practice, the theory has not always been carried out, because when Oxford had the chance of turning out two of her best sons—Sir Robert Peel and the right hon. Gentleman, the Member for Mid Lothian—Oxford took very good care to do it. I say there is only one course for the City, and it would be wise to accept it. The only remedy is that the evil should cease to exist. It is a blunder to resist reform, and the City should learn to march with the times. I am not going to ask the House to endorse the Report of the Royal Commission, namely— We think no further admission to the Livery Company should confer the Parliamentary franchise, and that such Act should contain a provision to this effect. That is signed: Lord Derby, the Duke of Bedford, Lord Sherbrooke, Lord Coleridge, Sydney W. Waterlow, Albert Pell, the late Mr. J. F. B. Firth, and my hon. Friend, the Member for Morpeth. Those were the Commissioners who reported that the time had come when this ridiculous and anomalous franchise should cease to exist. I shall be told that there was a Minority Report. There was, and it was to the effect that the recommendation did not come within the 166 scope of the reference to the Royal Commission. That Report was signed by Sir Richard Assheton Cross, Baron de Rothschild, and Mr. Alderman W. J. R. Cotton. The first two have gone to another place, where Radicals cease from troubling and Tories are at rest; and Mr. Alderman Cotton has disappeared from the political arena, owing to the activity of the hon. Baronet opposite, and to the gratitude of the City of London for the way in which he fought all these questions when he was here. I am, therefore, asking the House to support my Motion because it has been recommended by the vast majority of a strong Royal Commission. Out of the three who signed the minority, two of them were Representatives of the City of London.\n\n§ (5.13.) MR. BEAUFOY (Lambeth, Kennington)\n\nI think Representatives of Metropolitan constituencies may be excused for bringing before this House a question affecting London, for London matters do not receive that attention in this House to which they are justly entitled. I ask the House to carefully consider its vote on this occasion, because if it be adverse it will be considered out of doors that the time of the Royal Commission was wasted, and that the sooner some other method of inquiry is adopted, and some other way of bringing this question into publicity, the better it will be for the pockets of the people and the 168 advancement of public business. It seems to me that if the Report of the Royal Commission was justified in 1884, it is more justified in 1891, because the Redistribution Bill of 1885 swept away a great many anomalies, leaving this one standing alone like an island surrounded by the sea. The representatives of the City would act wisely if they did something to carry this Resolution into effect. Of the many arguments used for the retention of this livery qualification, none appears of any worth whatever. Of course, we shall be told that this livery franchise represents the wealth and intelligence of the City of London. It seems to me that wealth is only too well represented in this House already, for in the majority of cases the qualification for a seat in this House is that its possessor should be a man of wealth, or, at all events, of a competence; and it also seems to me that we can only hope to deal with social questions in a safe and reasonable way, not by electing a large number of wealthy representatives, but by the introduction of more Members belonging to the working class, who would represent the wants and wishes of the masses of the people. But it is also said that these livery votes represent trade; undoubtedly, as my hon. Friend has shown, they did at one period represent the trade and commerce of this country, and to a certain extent we are under obligations to the City of London for the manly way in which the liveries stood up for liberty in days gone by; but if hon. Members will refer to the Report of the Royal Commission, they will, on reading page 19, come to the conclusion that the claim of the liverymen of London to represent trade is a fraud and a hollow sham, and rests on no solid foundation. Doubtless they do perform certain duties, but these are few and trivial, and there are none of them that could not be much better discharged by properly constituted and competent public authorities than is the case at the present moment. Let me take, as an example, the Fishmongers' Company. That Company does, I believe, exercise a certain amount of control over Billingsgate Market, and for that we are greatly obliged to them; but there is no other city in the world that would be content to leave the control of the purification 169 and regulation of a large and important supply of the food of its inhabitants in the hands of an irresponsible private body. Surely, if such a market is to be controlled at all, it should be by some body which is itself amenable to public control and not by an irresponsible company who may or who may not discharge their duties. It is, moreover, a matter of fact that even in the discharge of this duty it has no statutory warrant, but its action is simply referable to a memorial custom which has existed in the City, and which renders it exceedingly difficult for any alteration to be made. It seems to me that even if it were desirable that trade should have a special representation in this House, and that we should here admit the representatives of special class interests, the City Companies are by no means the best representatives that could be found. Take, for instance, the Apothecaries' Company. They perform a certain public duty, and may in some degree be said to represent medicine, but if medicine is to be represented, it ought not to be by the Apothecaries' Company. Why should we not go to the College of Physicians or the College of Surgeons, and ask them to send representatives to this House—men who should represent not the very base and bottom of the profession, but the higher degrees of that profession, who might be expected to speak with weight and authority in this assembly. Again, there is the Scriveners' Company, who may be said in some sense to represent the public interest, because they institute examinations for notaries. I must confess that I am not very clear in my own mind as to what a notary is, but, at any rate, a notary cannot act in the City of London unless he has passed the examination instituted by the Scriveners' Company. Although in some degree that Company represents the lower branches of the legal profession, if we were to allow them to send representatives here we should be doing a gross injustice to the rest of the profession, because we should be ignoring the Incorporated Law Society, which in every sense is more fitted to represent the law. Therefore it appears to me that the claim made in support of the livery franchise on the ground of the representation of trade must, under 170 these circumstances, fall to the ground. In point of fact these gentlemen are not the representatives of trade, they represent no one but themselves. Hon. Members may remember the very interesting speech which was made by the hon. Member for Dundee some time ago on the question of the University franchise. Everyone who heard that speech must have felt that the hon. Gentleman had an exceedingly good case. He urged that all these fancy franchises were bad, but if the University franchise is bad it is not nearly so bad or so mischievous as the livery franchise, because the University is an independent constituency in itself. The members of the University return a representative of their own, and do not interfere with any other constituency, but in the case of the Livery Companies the liverymen swamp and overturn the votes of people much better qualified for the exercise of the franchise. To this extent the livery franchise is wrong. We have had already heard something about the minority Report signed by three eminent gentlemen, members of the Commission, who came to the conclusion that this subject of the livery franchise did not come within the scope of that inquiry, but however eminent these gentlemen might be, it appears that their colleagues did not agree with them, as they were in a minority. But there was one representative of the City who was really true to his colours, and who in a Report drawn up by himself defended the livery franchise up to the hilt, a procedure more creditable to the zeal than to the understanding of the hon. Gentleman. He seemed to think we ought not to disfranchise anybody. I may say that personally I have no such desire, but I think we ought to see that before we give superfluous votes everybody who is entitled to a vote should have that vote. Therefore we are anxious to remove this stumbling block to the proper exercise of the franchise, in order that we may be enabled to do justice to those thousands of the working classes who have difficulty in getting upon the register, not because they are not substantially qualified, but because they are excluded by the conditions of residence. Having adopted one general form of franchise, it 171 seems to me that these exceptions in favor of a particular class are most invidious and unsatisfactory, and I think the House would do well to show by its vote to-night that it will no longer allow such a state of things to continue. We may be told that this Motion is an attack upon the City. For my own part, I may say that if I am engaged in an attack on the City I am only doing one of those things for which I was sent to this House. The City is not in particularly good odour just now outside its own particular boundaries. The people outside the City are conscious they are suffering grievous injustice on account of the exceptional position occupied by the City itself, and they desire to get this injustice remedied. We may be told that this is not an opportune time for bringing this subject forward. We are told the minority have no right to stir in these matters. But, although we are now in a minority, I have no doubt that that state of things will undergo a change before very long. We have already had more than one bye-election, in which, the principles we profess have predominated, and we have had a County Council election which was indicative of a state of feeling very different from, that which made the Parliamentary representation of the Metropolis what it is. I appeal to hon. Members opposite, and especially to those members of the County Council who have seats in this House, although, as a rule, they arc supporters of the Government, to give us their assistance in carrying this Resolution; it is quite time we should take this matter into serious consideration. There have been many difficulties in obtaining the opportunity we have now secured. Only last year my hon. Friend secured a day for his Motion, but at the last moment the Government swooped down upon us and appropriated it themselves. Only the other day the Motion was in imminent jeopardy of suffering a similar fate on this occasion: but, having at last obtained the opportunity of thoroughly ventilating the question, I hope that we shall show that if we may not be in a majority, nevertheless a very large number of Members of this House regard the livery vote as an injurious monopoly, which is wrong 172 in principle, as introducing a fancy franchise into the Constitution, and a monstrous injustice to that greater London whose claims for recollection have been so long ignored.\n\n§ (6.7.) SIR G. TREVELYAN (Glasgow, Bridgeton)\n\nWhen the noble Lord the Member for South Molton rose, all who had heard previous speeches of his knew that we should hear most that is to be said against this Amendment. The noble Lord's remarks have been supplemented by those of the hon. Member for Wandsworth, yet I must own I do not think any case has been made out against the Amendment. The noble Lord and the hon. Member for Wandsworth resorted to an argument which can be used against any change or reform, namely, that in the case of a previous Bill this change was not introduced by the Party that is now recommending it. If this is to be regarded as a valid argument the Liberal Party may as well shut up their business at once, because the argument applies against every possible reform. The noble Lord put it in the most favourable form when he said the Liberal Party at the zenith of its power brought in a great Reform Bill that was meant to be comprehensive and yet did not welcome this change. It 180 was during the passage of that Bill through Parliament that the Liberal Government was turned out of Office by a hostile vote in the House of Commons. [Mr. MATTHEWS: The noble Lord referred to the Bill of 1884.] That being the case, it can scarcely be said the Liberal Party was in the zenith of its power. And that Bill was, as is well known on both sides of the House, of the nature of a compromise, and it could not have been passed through the House of Commons and the House of Lords at that time unless it had been of such a nature. It was well known that many very important points of which the Liberal Party was then and is now in favour were only kept back because of the nature of the Bill; indeed, the Redistribution Bill was actually turned into an Act by the Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman (Mr. Kimber) asked us to bring in a comprehensive measure:—\"Why,\" he said, \"do you come down on Tuesdays and Fridays and propose abstract Resolutions about the livery vote.\" No change in the Parliamentary representation of this country has ever been made without having been introduced on a Tuesday or Friday year after year. The use of these Resolutions was that in a cool atmosphere the whole case can be put by its advocates before the House of Commons, and through the House of Commons to the country. The country can then see how much political backing a political question has. Unless Sir E. Baines had year after year introduced his Resolution for the reduction of the borough franchise, and unless other Members had done the same thing in respect of the county franchise, I do not hesitate to say those measures would never have been passed. The noble Lord gave a perfectly fair account of the Report of the Commission, but we are not acting only on the Report of the Commission. We want to go into the merits of the question, and on the merits there can be no doubt whatever. This Resolution refers to one constituency only, but it establishes a great principle. That constituency has only a population of 50,000, and has two Members allotted to it. That made the question very important, because, in the first place, that means an excess of political power in this particular constituency; and, in 181 the next place, it may be said to be a sort of ideal constituency, with regard to which we ought to establish an ideal representation. What is the real condition of the constituency? There are in the constituency 21,000 occupiers and 7,500 livery voters. I was reading the other day a most interesting book, The History of the Boroughs, published in 1794, at the moment when in the old Whig Party the ideas of popular representation were at a higher level than they have reached ever since, and in it I read that— The election ought to lie with the inhabitant occupiers of the City agreeably to our ancient and free Constitution, and there probably would be about 22,000. It is quite true that those 22,000, as described by the Member for Finsbury, were real, genuine residents living on the spot. But that is all altered now, and of those 22,000 occupiers I suppose that not more than one-third, or some 7,000, are real residents, and these are in a worse position than any other voters in the Kingdom. Elsewhere the resident voters are, so to say, diluted by non-resident voters, but in the City of London they are swamped. The constituency of Central Glasgow most nearly resembles the City of London. Of the 11,000 occupying voters 3,000 live outside the Division. In the case of the City of London, not 3,000 but 10,000 live outside the City. That grievance would be enough, but it is not all. Besides these out-voters, the 7,000 resident voters have to contend likewise with 7,500 livery voters; of whom not more than one quarter have any premises in the City, and probably not more than l-10th or l-20th reside in the City. They have bought the franchise with money down, just as they would buy a horse or a piece of furniture. Some of the prices given are very large. In the Cloth workers' Company it cost 100 guineas. In the Fishmongers' and the Goldsmiths' about 30 guineas. In the Fishmongers' there are 432 liverymen, and in the Cloth workers' 150 liverymen. Who are these bodies that they should be so represented even according to the theory that property 182 ought to be represented? The Fishmongers, have, I believe, an income of £55,000, and the Cloth workers' an income of £50,000. Now, supposing a country gentleman, or a man of business, has £50,000 a year, he will probably have three or four votes; if he is a brewer he may perhaps have 11 or 12. But these companies, with the same incomes as rich landed proprietors or men of business, have not 3 or 4, or 11 or 12, but 300 or 400 votes. They are, therefore, even on the theory that property should have a special representation, monstrously over-represented. I would just ask the House to look at the question of privilege as it exists in the City. The resident householders have 7,000 votes out of 29,000; that is to say, that each resident householder in the City has one-fourth of a vote. Now, let as see what the privileged classes have. First of all a member of these classes votes for the villa in which he lives at a distance from the City, or for his house in one of the fashionable parts of London. Secondly, he votes for his freehold property in the City as a county voter for the Hornsey Division. And not only does he vote for the Hornsey Division, where he does not reside and where he has not a shred of property, but he is so tenderly treated that two booths, and in one case three booths, are actually set up in the Guildhall in order that he may give his vote for Hornsey without having to leave his business for more than five minutes. This has been disputed once in the House, but I have documents which prove it beyond all doubt. In the third place he has a vote for the City itself—a vote which can be bought with money—and in the fourth place if he belongs to the class of University men and has taken out his M.A. degree, he can vote for his University. The noble Lord near me was, I believe, somewhat inaccurate in his statement as to the price of these livery votes. I think he was misinformed when he said it cost £25 to procure a vote. There are some Companies which are practically kept up for the purpose of making these votes. [Cries of \"No!\"] Well, it looks very like it. The Playing Card Makers' Company possess no property and charge a fee of 23 guineas for admission. The Loriners 183 have no land; there are 438 liverymen and the fine is £12. The Basket Makers' Company, with 29 liverymen, has an income of £35 from fees, and that is all spent on one entertainment. Now, if there is any sense about this system, if votes should be bought for money, the price should be the same, instead of varying from £120 or so to £12. But who would seriously propose to reform the livery franchise in such a way? There is only one possible reform, and that is to sweep it away altogether. Since the change in the franchise that my hon. Friend referred to, a man can by paying £12 or £20 live anywhere in Middlesex, or in the heart of Kent or Essex, almost any where in Surrey or in parts of Bucks and Herts, and tye assist in voting down the real residents of the City of London. This great injustice is accompanied by smaller injustices. The liveryman may change his residence as often as he likes, but when once he has paid his money he retains his vote for life. The ordinary householder, whenever he changes his residence and goes outside the precincts of the City, loses his one-fourth of a vote, sometimes for 18 months, and sometimes for much longer periods. The liveryman is not subject to the personal payment of rates and to all the chances of losing his vote that such a condition involves, but the ordinary householder has to pay his rates up to the day or he loses his vote. This country is pretty tolerant of anomalies if any public reason can be given for them, but for these anomalies no public reason can be given. There are, it is true, some 20,000 freemen still remaining in our large towns, but they are for the most part freemen of the whole town. They may have some local patriotism, some feeling that they owe something to the community—something of that feeling which in old days the liverymen of London displayed when they insisted that their Member should represent them on the floor of this House, even though he was rejected by the great majority of Members of the House. But in this case the liverymen are not attached to a great city. They are attached to certain isolated bodies, and I ask what reason is there that those bodies should have a special representation? Of all bodies they probably need 184 reform the most. I will read to the House the mere headings of the reforms which the Commission recommended, and which has not been carried out. They recommended that measures should be taken to prevent the alienation of the property of the Companies, and that means should be taken to secure the permanent application of a considerable portion of the corporate income to useful purposes. I am not throwing reflections on the Companies in this respect. They further recommended that a new trust should be declared where a better application of the trust moneys of the Companies had become desirable. Then came the recommendation about the franchise, which the House has already heard, and then there were recommendations that colourable apprenticeships should cease, and that excessive sums should no longer be spent on entertainments and on the maintenance and relief of poor members. Who were they who made these recommendations? Were they violent Radicals? They were Lord Derby, Lord Sherbrooke, the late Duke of Bedford, and Lord Coleridge. I object to these bodies having special representation in order that when these questions come before the House of Commons they should have an undue number of Members in this House to stand in the way of reform. The principle upon which we bring forward this Motion and support it is very simple. It is a principle which, during the last two generations, has constantly inspired all the changes which Parliament has made in reforming our representation, and that principle is, that to secure good Government, the Government should be in the hands of the greatest possible number of intelligent and independent men, and that each of these men who is sufficiently intelligent and independent to be a citizen shall have an exactly equal voice in the Government of the country. That has not been secured yet; but that has been the tendency of our legislation, and we ask that this system shall be abolished, that the residents—the real residents, the householders of the City of London—may have fair play in this question of the franchise, and not be absolutely swamped, as no other constituency in the country is, by people who have votes 185 elsewhere. Those bankers, merchants, and others of high character, of whom the noble Lord spoke as having votes in the City of London, surely they live somewhere—they are not houseless when they leave the City—and they have votes elsewhere? When we bring forward this Motion we want real argument, and until we get that argument we cannot but believe that the only opposition to this change is because the change may be of advantage to one political Party and a disadvantage to the other. That argument has been freely brought forward outside this House, but I am sure it will not be used in the House. In discussing these subjects we discuss them not from the point of view whether these men hold our opinions or the opinions of our political opponents, but apart from such considerations. It is our business to see that every citizen shall have fair play, and neither more nor less than fair play, in getting his share of political power; and in order that this principle may be established in the central constituency of the kingdom, where at the present moment it is extravagantly violated, my hon. Friend has brought forward this Motion, and I trust that every Member who looks at these questions not from the point of view of Party, but of principle, will vote with him."
