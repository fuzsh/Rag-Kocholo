        "text": "Background\n\nIn 1876, Joseph F B Firth published his book \"Municipal London\". He put the case against livery companies in moderate language. However, his conclusions were drastic: suppress the companies and confiscate their assets.\n\nHe argued that the companies had outlived their usefulness. They were originally set up almost as \"departments of government\" to regulate trade and contribute to the governance of the city. In his view, these activities were now taken over by governmental bodies. Much of the property was given in trust to the companies to pay for stipulated sums to charities, but although the values of this property had risen, the companies still only paid the stipulated sums to charity and spent the rest of the income on themselves. Firth further argued that the companies did not show their accounts even to their own members, and there was no public scrutiny.\n\nFirth was critical of the relationship with the original trades and the role of the courts of assistants. Many livery men had little contact with the trades and the companies appeared to exist to give dinners to livery men and greater benefits to members of the court.\n\n\"The responsibility of a seat on a court carries with it a salary; the meetings of court are duly paid for; some courts have dinners of some kind as often as once a week and lucky are the committeemen of such companies, for in addition to their salaries they sometimes find a banknote delicately secreted under their plates and sometimes find a huge box of bonbons upon them. It is indeed a good thing to be on the court of a company.\"\n\nThe Bowyers Company was no exception. A recent analysis of the Wardens Accounts over the period of 164 years from 1764 to 1928 revealed that the bills for entertaining in various City Taverns, and latterly at the Savoy and the Café Royal, accounted for 33% of all expenditure. A further 14% was spent on Court attendance fees. In contrast 14% was spent on exhibitions at Oxford and Cambridge and only 1.66% on charitable giving. This included the annual sums given to the Master to be distributed as he thought fit, doles to the poor of Isley Walton and to the Parish Poor of St Nicholas Cole Abbey and the purchase of Yards of Cloth for the Parish Poor as stipulated by James Wood in his will of 1625. To give an idea of the sums involved, excluding exceptional items relating to the estate in Leicestershire, the total expenditure of the Company was £223 in 1764 rising steadily to a peak of £1,407 in 1898 which slipped back to £971 by 1928.\n\nWhy had the livery companies been able to long resist demands for their abolition? Firth asked. It was because they invited members of government and judges to their dinners. \"No one who has partaken of those gorgeous banquets could find it in their hearts to treat his hosts hardly.\"\n\nA number of MPs agreed with Firth: in May 1876 Walter H James (a Liberal MP for Gateshead) moved that a commission be set up to obtain a full return of the livery companies' income and property. The prime minister, Disraeli, and his Conservative majority in the House were not in favour of this idea, but James was given cautious support by the former prime minister, Gladstone.\n\nSupporters of the livery movement rejected the basis of the arguments of Firth and James. They maintained that livery companies had not originally been \"departments of state\" and that they had not been formed to regulate their trades or to play any part in the government of the city. The companies were incorporations of private individuals who had come together. They formed a livery company and had provided it with funds from their admission fees in order to help each other in hard times. These points must have been difficult to sustain, one imagines.\n\nIn 1880 the Liberals won the general election with Gladstone becoming prime minister again. A month after they came to power a Royal Commission was established. Its chairman was the Earl of Derby who later became a minister in Gladstone's cabinet. Other eminent public figures were members including the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge. Both James and Firth, who had just been elected as Liberal MP for Chelsea, were members. Another member was the great champion of the City, Alderman Cotton, who had been Lord Mayor in 1875. Liberals and critics of the livery movement had a clear majority on the Commission.\n\nThe Commission reported in 1884. In view of the composition of membership the report was not unanimous but was supported by nine of the twelve members. The main conclusion was that \"it appears to us obvious that the state had a right at any time to disestablish and dis-endow the Companies of London, provided that the just claims of existing members to compensation be allowed.\" But the majority report did not recommend this course. They proposed only that legislation be introduced to ensure that a considerable part of the companies' income was applied to useful purposes. Three members issued a minority dissenting report saying that the livery companies were private bodies which were entitled to use their funds in any way they pleased.\n\nAlthough Firth signed the majority report, he also issued his own dissenting report recommending that the companies be suppressed and their property confiscated to be applied to educational, health, artistic and literary purposes in London. He thought that members of the companies should be paid compensation.\n\nThe Liberal government fell before any legislation could be passed to implement the Commission's recommendations. When Lord Salisbury's Conservative government returned to power, the City was safe. It was this government, however, that in 1888 introduced legislation to grant the reformers' long-standing demand to have a central body for the government of London in succession to the Metropolitan Boards of Works. The Act of 1888 established the London County Council, but the City of London was excluded from its jurisdiction.\n\nThe Report of the Royal Commissioners of 1884\n\nThe City Livery Companies were required to provide details of their foundation, charters, membership, constitution, property, income and charitable activities. Many of the companies felt that this was an intrusion and that the Commissioners were acting ultra vires. The Bowyers' Company shared this view for their return begins with the statement - These returns were given under protest. A full set of returns for all of the City Companies is held in bound volumes at the Guildhall Library. The full text of the Bowyers' return has been reproduced below with its original layout and punctuation.\n\nThe following points are of interest\n\nThe summary refers to a subsequent charter of 1685. It is known that the charter was granted in 1621, re-granted in 1666 and surrendered in 1684 with a petition for a further re-grant. This is the only reference that the writer has found referring to the re-grant following the surrender of 1684. The reference to the charter of 17th November 1688 should read 17th November 1666.\n\nThere is reference to the Report of the Municipal Commissioners of 1834. This was a previous Royal Commission which investigated all City and Borough Corporations as well the Livery Companies.\n\nIslay Walton,Staffordshire should read Isley Walton, Leicestershire.\n\nThere is reference to a Licence in Mortmain which was granted in relation to the purchase in 1824 of a parcel of land adjoining the Isley Walton estate. At that time, a corporation was not permitted to hold land except by statutory authority or by licence of the Crown. Any land which was transferred to a corporation without such authorisation was liable to forfeiture by the Crown.\n\nThe return contains recitals of the Charter of 1621 and of the will of James Wood of 1625.\n\nThe return states that, except as appears by its charter, the company is unable to furnish its history and that it does not exercise superintendence over any art, trade or business. There is a reference to Maitland's History of 1739. A copy of this book is still owned by the Company.\n\nThe return includes a question on the admission of women. The company replied \"Woman have been admitted to membership, but it is many years since a lady has been admitted. The last was Miss Sainsbury in 1813\".\n\nThere were only 36 liverymen and 1 freeman at the time of the return.\n\nThe income of the company was under £600 per annum. The clerk was paid £80 per annum.\n\nOn the subject of membership privileges the return states: On the subject of membership privileges the return states: Except the fees paid to the members of the court for their attendance to the business of the company and the privilege of occasionally dining together, there are no profits or privileges incident to the position of a member of the company.Except the fees paid to the members of the court for their attendance to the business of the company and the privilege of occasionally dining together, there are no profits or privileges incident to the position of a member of the company.\n\nThe company provided 14 exhibitions of £10, 7 at Oxford and 7 at Cambridge and, having built the village school at Isley Walton, contributed to its maintenance.\n\nSinclair Rogers and Simon Leach\n\nAugust 2012\n\nREPORTS FROM COMMISSIONERS, INSPECTORS, AND OTHERS:\n\nTHIRTY VOLUMES.\n\n-(23.

The style of this company is the Master, Wardens, and Society of the Mystery of Bowyers of the city of London.\n\n2. James I by his charter reciting that the bowyers of the city of London using the art or mystery of making of long bows, were an ancient fraternity in the city, but who had fallen into decay, and that the king being willing as much as in him did lie to restore the ancient and laudable exercise of archery with the long bow unto the end that the said fraternity might with better encouragement practise their trade grants, that the bowyers of London, and all and every person and persons then using or who shall thereafter use the mystery of making long bows in the city of London and liberties thereof, and being freemen of the said city, and then free of the said fraternity, or hereafter to be made free, should be a body politic and corporate by the before-mentioned name or style.\n\nThe charter grants that they shall be governed by one master, two wardens, and 13 assistants, and the first master, wardens, and 10 of the first assistants are thereby named and appointed the first master and wardens, to continue in office until the Thursday next after the feast of St James the Apostle, 1622, and from thence until others should be elected pursuant to the charter; and the assistants, during their natural lives, or until removed, and for the future election of these officers is granted that the master, wardens, and assistants, or the greater part of them from time to time thereafter, upon Thursday next after the feast of Saint James the Apostle, 1622, may nominate and choose one fit person of the assistants to be master and two to be wardens, who are to execute their offices for two whole years thence next ensuing, and in case of death or removal otherwise to be chosen within 14 days.\n\nAnd it is further declared that in case of the death or removal of any of the assistants (a power of removal being thereby given to the master and wardens, and the rest of the assistants) then and so often the master, wardens and the rest of the assistants then living or continuing in office, or the greater part of them within three months after such death or removal, shall and may nominate and choose one or more fit and proper persons, freemen of the society, in the place or room of the person or persons so deceased or removed, and that the person or persons so elected shall be assistant and assistants for the term of his or their life or lives unless removed in manner before mentioned.\n\nThe charter gives to the wardens and assistants power to elect a clerk and beadle to hold office during pleasure.\n\nThe charter further declares that all freemen of the company, and all persons of the mystery within three miles of the city of London and the suburbs thereof, shall be contributory to the company, and shall also pay a quarterage of 8d. per quarter or 2s. 8d. per year. This charter, or the enrolment thereof, was exemplified and confirmed by Charles II.\n\nThe charter gives the power of making byelaws to the master, wardens, and assistants, or the greater part of them.\n\nThey give the following directions for the election of the members of the court:-\n\nIt is ordered that upon Thursday next after the feast of St. James the Apostle in every second year, or within 20 days before or after the same, at the pleasure of the master, wardens, and assistants of the company or the more part of them for the time being, the master, wardens , and assistants shall assemble and meet together and elect and make choice of a new master and two wardens out of the assistants of the company, who shall next follow in course to be chosen, who shall hold the same place of master and wardens for the two years then next following until a new master and wardens shall be chosen in their stead (if they or any of them shall so long live), and if it shall happen that the master and wardens, or any of them, shall die or depart this life before the expiration of their two years that then it shall be lawful at a court of assistants to elect and make choice of new master or wardens in the room and instead of him or them.\n\nC. - The only trust instrument affecting the company is the will of James Wood, dated the 1st of August 1625, an abstract of the purport of which is as follows:-\n\nThe only charity under the management of this company, arises under the will of James Wood, who by will dated 1st August 1625 devised his manor or lordship of Isley Walton, in the county of Leicester, with certain messages, lands, and tenements, lying within the territories of Isley Walton aforesaid, Kegworth, and Osgathorp in the said county of Leicester, to the master, wardens, and commonalty of the Company of Bowyers and their successors for ever, in trust, that the master and wardens should yearly out of the rents of the said manor and other premises, pay and bestow upon three scholars within the University of Oxford, and upon two more scholars within the University of Cambridge, freeman's sons of the Company of Bowyers if there should be any such, but if not, then upon five other poor scholars, which have come from Christchurch School, in London, or such others as the said master and wardens should think most fit towards their maintenance at the university the yearly sum of £6 each. Each scholar to receive the same for seven year if he should so long continue at the university.
