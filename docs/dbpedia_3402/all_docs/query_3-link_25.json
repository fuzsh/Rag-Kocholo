Any opinions in the examples do not represent the opinion of the Cambridge Dictionary editors or of Cambridge University Press or its licensors.\n\n{{#randomImageQuizHook.filename}} {{#randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}}\n\nTest your vocabulary with our fun image quizzes\n\nTry a quiz now\n\n{{/randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{^randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{/randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{/randomImageQuizHook.filename}}\n\nWord of the Day\n\nleft-handed\n\nUK\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio\n\n/ˌleftˈhæn.dɪd/\n\nUS\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio\n\n/ˌleftˈhæn.dɪd/\n\n(of a person) using their left hand to write and do most things\n\nAbout this\n\nBlog\n\nRobbing, looting, and embezzling: talking about stealing\n\nAugust 07, 2024\n\nNew Words\n\nquishing\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nMore new words"
