        "text": "The Worshipful Company of Constructors is a modern City of London Livery Company for professionals working in the construction industry. The Company was granted Livery by The Court of Aldermen in 1990, followed by a Royal Charter of Incorporation by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II in 2010.\n\nMany of our Liverymen are Chartered members of their respective professional institutions – some in leading positions. They come from all sectors of the construction trade, including architects, surveyors, engineers, builders, lawyers and accountants. This rich diversity gives huge social and professional benefits to our members.\n\nFellowship is an important part of company life, and each year there are three formal dinners. These are held in the city’s splendid halls and are an excellent opportunity to entertain clients, colleagues, friends and family.\n\nThe ancient watchwords of the city are fellowship, relief and truth. The purpose of all ancient City livery companies was to support the Church, dispense alms to the needy and supervise and regulate the practice of their skill. You will be required to prove your zeal by a regular attendance at our functions and services of worship, together with regular support to our charities."
