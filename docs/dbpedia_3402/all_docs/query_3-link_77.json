        "text": "There are 111 City of London Livery Companies, each representing a different profession, trade or craft, both ancient and modern. All the Companies play an active role in promoting their crafts and professions within the City, and collectively give more than £70 million to charity every year.\n\nLivery companies date back to before 1066 and are similar to the ancient guilds that controlled the provision of services and the manufacture/sale of goods within the City of London, protecting members and customers against substandard work.\n\nThe original 12 Livery Companies in order of precedence are known as the ‘Great Twelve’, and date back hundreds of years. After World War II, however, there was a realisation by the City that the Livery movement needed new life breathing into it, and the foundation of new Livery Companies was encouraged. The Builders’ Merchants Company is known as one of the ‘Modern Livery Companies’ and ranks number 88 out of the 111. Modern livery companies are generally accepted as starting with Master Mariners, number 78.\n\nAll Companies have a trade title but, unlike ourselves, many of them have only a limited connection with the trade they represent, or originally represented. Indeed, some of the trades, such as that of the Fletchers, have more or less disappeared. At the time our Liverymen join the Company, however, they join come either from the builders’ merchants’ industry or their suppliers, and so we are known as a ‘closed’ Company.\n\nAll Livery Companies participate in the ceremonial events of the City, but a key function for all Companies is to raise money for charity, much of which comes from members’ own donations.\n\nMore information about the City Livery Movement can be found at the Livery Committee website including a comprehensive database of all Companies and Guilds, booking facilities for courses and a calendar for City events."
