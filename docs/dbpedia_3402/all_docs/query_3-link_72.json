        "text": "The City Livery Companies go back to the middle ages, and were founded to promote and protect the crafts which their members practised. All Hallows has long-standing and active connections with many of the livery companies and our Vicar, The Rev'd Katherine Hedderly, is Chaplain to the following:\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Bakers (www.bakers.co.uk)\n\nThe Bakers' Company is one of the oldest City of London Liveries with a history dating back over 800 years. The bakers were an organised body of workers by the twelfth century and received a royal charter in 1486. They were entrusted with the control of the weight and price of bread as well as the normal activities of a guild. The Bakers' Company continues to be closely involved with the baking trade, and a high proportion of its members are Master Bakers and Allied Traders. The Bakers' Company holds its annual Thanksgiving Service and Christmas Carol Service at All Hallows.\n\nThe Company of Watermen and Lightermen (www.watermenscompany.com/)\n\nThe Company of Watermen was established by Act of Parliament in 1555 to regulate watermen and wherrymen carrying passengers by boat under oars on the River Thames, and it remains the only ancient City Guild to be formed and controlled by Parliament. The Company organises the annual Doggetts' Race from London Bridge to Chelsea, is the Trustee of several notable charities and provides historical information for people trying to trace ancestors who worked on the Thames. The Company enjoys a close relationship with All Hallows, starting way back in history when the Company’s Hall at St Mary-at-Hill is alleged to have had a footing within the parish boundary. The Company donated to the rebuilding of the war-damaged church and there is a window on the south side that contains the Coat of Arms of the Company. The Company holds both its Annual Installation Service and its Carol Service at All Hallows.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of World Traders (www.world-traders.org)\n\nThe World Traders' Company is one of the modern City of London's Livery Comapnies, having been granted livery status in January 2000, and a stained glass window was installed in the church to celebrate the Company's 10th anniversary. The Company seeks to raise the awareness, understanding, and the standard of practice in world trade. It combines fellowship, welfare and education with working in the best interests of the trading community of London and overseas. The members retain strong interests in world trade and pursue charitable and educational initiatives through its Charitable Trust. The Company’s relationship with All Hallows goes back to its foundation in 1985 when the original members were based at the then World Trade Centre in St Katharine’s Dock. Many members have spent most of their careers in the City and recognise the important role of All Hallows over the centuries in the lives of those living and working in London, and especially in Tower Ward. The Company's annual Thanksgiving Service is held at the church, as is their Christmas Carol service."
