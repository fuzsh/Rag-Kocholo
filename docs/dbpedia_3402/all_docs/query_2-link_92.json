Complaints are handled from the following agencies:\n\nBay Constables\n\nBuilding and Zoning\n\nEnvironmental Conservation\n\nFire Marshall\n\nNew York State Police\n\nPark Rangers\n\nSouthampton Town Police\n\nSuffolk County Police\n\nSuffolk County Sheriff\n\nEach court case involves many procedures. For the cases, the initial information must be keyed in and the defendant's plea must be entered. Bail, if set and paid, must be entered, deposited in the bank and a record kept for auditing purposes. The cases must be scheduled for arraignment, for conferences, and maybe for trial. The judge's decision must be noted, if any payment, it is posted to the computer, deposited in the bank, the processing of paperwork; and then the final procedure is to close the case manually and electronically both in CDR and TSLED, so that it can appear on the monthly report."
