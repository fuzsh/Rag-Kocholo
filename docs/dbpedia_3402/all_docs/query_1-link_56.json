        "text": "All Livery Companies (along with Companies without Livery and Guilds) are invited to send one or more representatives to PLPB meetings. At our meetings to date, we have had attendees from over 40 Livery Companies, with some Companies sending two or more members. Most attendees are already involved in philanthropic activity within their Company; for example, playing a role in volunteer or pro bono activity, or as a trustee with their charitable fund. However, we are happy for those new to this area to join us and learn about what others are doing.\n\nCompanies who have had representatives at one or more meetings are shown below.\n\nAccountantsEntrepeneursMercers ActuariesEnvironmental CleanersNeedlemakers ArbitratorsFirefightersNurses ArchitectsFramework KnittersPattenmakers Builders MerchantsFuellersPlumbers CarpentersGardenersSaddlers Chartered SecretariesGirdlersScientific Instrument Makers ClockmakersGlass SellersSkinners ClothworkersGlaziersSolicitors CoachmakersGrocersStationers CommunicatorsHornersTax Advisers ConstructorsHR ProfessionalsWater Conservators CutlersInformation TechnologistsWheelwrights DistillersLeathersellersWoolmen EducatorsManagement ConsultantsWorld Traders EngineersMarketors\n\nIf you are interested in joining the PLPB group and would like to attend meetings, then please contact Bob Harris.\n\nIt is intended to cover all situations where our time is donated free of charge to help achieve a social or public benefit. This can range from informal support by a volunteer to an individual through to an assignment utilising professional expertise to support a charitable organisation, school or public body.\n\nA more detailed list of examples of the nature and scope of volunteering and pro bono support is is shown here.\n\nThe 2022 survey of philanthropic giving reported estimates of the time donated by the livery movement in several categories:\n\nActivityHours As School Governors and Charity Trustees45,000 As Trustees of Livery Charitable Funds35,000 General volunteer support to front-line charities37,000 Professional pro bono support to charities26,000\n\nThe survey also estimated the value of the pro bono support (based on the valuation principles set out by the Charity Commission) as Â£6.8m in the previous year.\n\nThere is little doubt that the above figures are significant underestimates as many Livery Companies find it challenging to identify and record the full extent of their volunteer and pro bono support."
