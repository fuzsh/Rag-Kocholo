        "text": "The 7th June 2024 saw the Plumbers’ Company field our first team at the 10th Inter Livery Rifle Shooting event at the National Shooting Centre, Bisley. It’s held in aid of SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity, and the RAF Benevolent Fund, and proved to be really well attended and a great day on the ranges for all involved.\n\nOn 20th June 2024, whilst the main Livery focus was on the Master’s Break on the Isle of Wight, a trusty band of PGS golfers were playing in the Tallow Chandlers’ Golf Day at The Drift Golf Club in Surrey competing to retain The Newson-Smith Cup we won last year.\n\nWe’re delighted to launch this short documentary film that describes the design and manufacture of the two large planters to commemorate the coronation of Their Majesties the King and Queen, and installed at Sandringham House. Watch it on our Videos About Us page.\n\nThe Master has announced that Sharon Sibthorpe is leaving her position as Clerk’s Assistant. All of us who know Sharon will miss her hugely for her warmth, enthusiasm, and professionalism, as a welcoming and friendly presence in the office and at events.\n\nWe at the Plumbers’ Company pay tribute to all those who took part in the D-Day landings and the subsequent conflict: those who died, those who were injured, and those who survived to live with the memories.\n\nOn 13th May 2024, the Company experienced an insightful and impactful Annual Lecture from speaker Gareth Owen OBE, Humanitarian Director at Save the Children UK, who talked about his career and the places he has worked, starting as a 24 year-old in Somalia, to the current devastasting humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the sell-out show of the highly acclaimed ‘Dial Medicine for Murder’ Criminal Medical Consultation, last November, the Sheriffs’ & Recorder’s Fund is pleased to present three more dates at the Old Bailey in the iconic Court No. 1, scene of many famous criminal case trials that shaped modern Britain.\n\nAn interest has been expressed by several Livery Companies for the running of a sailing regatta for those involved in the Livery movement. The purpose of this announcement is to establish whether there is enough interest to take this further.\n\nDaisy Turner from Barking and Dagenham College is the 2024 Winner of the HIP Female Skills Competition, following an intense grand final at Stephenson College, in Coalville, on the 18th of April, co-sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Plumbers. Ciah Hooch Llewellyn Davies from Gower College Swansea secured the runner-up spot.\n\nAs previously reported, Daisy also clinched the title of HIP Learner of the Year, making this a remarkable double win!\n\nBarking and Dagenham College student, Daisy Turner has won HIP Learner of the Year 2024, following an intense two-day final on 11th and 12th of April at the JTL Birmingham Training Centre, co-sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Plumbers. Zak Rowan from Grimsby Institute earned the runner-up spot.\n\nWith unprecedented levels of rain over the winter, our Plumbers’ Golf Society (PGS) Spring Meeting at Wildernesse GC was in doubt with 48 hours to go! However, the fantastic greens team at Wildernesse (near Seal in Kent) delivered, and 14 Plumbers and guests were able to play our Spring Meeting on 11th April 2024.\n\nThe course was in amazingly good condition, and the greens were true and speedy.\n\nOur Annual Banquet on 8th April 2024 was a splendid occasion, with hundreds of Liverymen, Freemen, and guests assembling at Mansion House in the presence of our special guest The Lord Mayor Locum Tenens Alderman Vincent Keaveny CBE.\n\nPhotos taken at the event by Marcus Jamieson-Pond, may be downloaded from Snapfish. Low-res versions are free, or open a Snapfish account for high-res versions (and the first few downloads are free).\n\nOn 19th March 2024, a flush of Plumbers ventured into East London to visit the Museum of the Home in Hoxton. It was a breezy spring day, and thankfully the merest splatter of rain did not dampen our event at this beautiful museum."
