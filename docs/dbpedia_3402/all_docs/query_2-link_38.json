        "text": "Six judges serve on the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Court. The judges resolve disputes about injuries that are claimed to have been caused by workplace accidents or diseases. Judges of the court determine whether injuries or occupational diseases were caused by accidents or exposures at work, and if so, the types and amounts of benefits injured workers should receive.\n\nThe court maintains offices in Lincoln and Omaha, although all court filings must be made electronically or physically in the Lincoln office. Cases are heard throughout Nebraska in the county where the injury is reported to have occurred.\n\nAfter each hearing, the judge enters a written decision stating their factual and legal conclusions. Decisions may be appealed to the Nebraska Court of Appeals. A limited number of appeals may also be heard by the Nebraska Supreme Court, either directly or upon further review of a decision by the Nebraska Court of Appeals.\n\nThe judges are initially appointed by the governor. Judges are then subject to a retention vote by the electorate three years after appointment and every six years thereafter. Every two years, one of the judges is elected by the judges of the court to serve as presiding judge, subject to approval of the Nebraska Supreme Court.\n\nOfficial Website of the Nebraska Workers’ Compensation Court\n\nQuestions?
