        "text": "The livery business is making a comeback. As the pandemic continues to wane and life returns to mostly normal, people are once again using livery companies for group events, weddings, and parties. Livery companies are a great way to add a touch of class to any event. They provide transportation for guests and can even help with event planning. In addition, livery companies are a wonderful way to support local businesses. When you use a livery company, you are often supporting a small business owner and helping to keep the local economy strong.\n\nLivery businesses offer a variety of services\n\nThere are many diverse types of livery businesses, each offering a unique set of services that cater to unique needs and budgets. For a business traveler, a livery service can provide a limousine to pick you up from the airport and take you to your meeting in style. If you’re attending a wedding or event, livery services often have shuttle buses that can transport you and your guests safely and on time. And if you’re planning a night out with friends, livery services also offer vans and party busses that can accommodate larger groups. No matter what your transportation needs may be, there’s sure to be a livery service that can accommodate you.\n\nWhat is driving the surge in livery business?\n\nIt’s no secret that the U.S. travel industry has been on a roll this year despite inflation and increasing costs, flight cancellations and growing recession concerns. After two years of COVID lockdowns, protocols and restrictions, people are eager to “get out there” again.\n\nTwenty-seven percent more people are traveling this summer compared to 2021. Of those traveling, 63 percent are booking international flights, and nearly 60 percent are planning to visit a destination they haven’t visited before. Over 50 percent are booking two to six months in advance and 11 percent are booking with lead times of six months or more. Many of these travelers will turn to livery companies for their transportation needs.\n\nWeddings are back on track\n\n2022 is shaping up to be a banner year for nuptials. Most couples who had canceled their nuptials due to the coronavirus pandemic have already set a new date. With weddings and other events beginning to fill up the calendar again, and the bride and groom wanting to arrive in style, limousine services and luxury car rentals are poised for success.\n\nVacation and business travel has skyrocketed\n\nAs the world starts to reopen, many of us are eager to get out and explore again. And it looks like we’ll have plenty of opportunities to do just that in 2022. According to a recent report from travel industry research firm Phocuswright, global travel is expected to pick up significantly in 2022.\n\nIn fact, Phocuswright predicts that global travel will reach nearly pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. This is good news for the travel industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. And it’s also good news for travelers, who can look forward to exploring new destinations and reconnecting with loved ones again.\n\nWhat are some of the most popular travel destinations in the U.S.?\n\nEvery year, millions of us pack our bags and head off to explore new places, both near and far. But where are we most likely to go in 2022? According to recent data, the most popular destination for American travelers is Florida. Orlando, is a top choice, thanks to its many theme parks and attractions. California is also a popular destination, with visitors flocking to places like Los Angeles and San Diego. And of course, no list of popular travel destinations would be complete without New York City. From the Statue of Liberty to Central Park, the Big Apple has something for everyone.\n\nHow can livery businesses prepare for future growth?\n\nMany livery businesses downsized their fleets significantly during COVID. Now that the pandemic is largely over and travel has taken off there are tremendous opportunities to capture demand for those firms in a position to do so.\n\nThere are a few steps that livery businesses can take to be ready. First, it is important to make sure that vehicles are well-maintained and safe for operation. This includes not only regularly scheduled maintenance, but also a thorough inspection of exteriors and interiors. Second, livery businesses should consider expanding their fleet to accommodate increased demand. This may mean purchasing new vehicles or leasing additional ones. Although the supply chain is getting better Finally, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of local regulations and guidelines. By taking these steps, livery businesses can be better prepared for future growth that lies ahead.\n\nWhat are some of the benefits to leasing livery vehicles?\n\n• Improve cash flow\n\n• Tax benefits\n\n• Advantageous pricing and payment structure\n\n• Vehicle leases or fleet financing can take advantage of incentives and rebates\n\n• Lessor expertise in buying, selling and specification recommendations\n\n• Reduced administrative time and costs\n\n• Consolidated billing\n\n• Minimum cash outlay\n\nHow long will you have to wait for a new vehicle?\n\nDepending on the make and model of the car you order, you may have to wait weeks or even months for delivery. In some cases, it can take up to a year. So, how long will you have to wait for your new vehicle?\n\nThe answer to that question depends on a number of factors, including the type of vehicle you order and the time of year you order it. For example, if you order a popular vehicle during peak demand periods, such as the summer or winter, you may have to wait longer for delivery than if you ordered the same vehicle during other times of the year. Similarly, if you order a less popular vehicle, you may find that your wait time is shorter.\n\nOf course, there are other factors that can affect delivery times as well. For example, if the factory where your car is being built is experiencing delays, that can impact your delivery time. And sometimes, vehicles are simply delayed in transit.\n\nExciting times ahead for the livery business\n\nThe revival of the livery business is good news for everyone involved. It means more jobs and a revived industry that is poised to grow in the years ahead. Livery businesses are coming up with new ways to serve their customers, and they are adapting to changing technologies and trends. This is an exciting time for the livery business, and we can’t wait to see what comes next."
