        "text": "You must attend one of the schools or colleges in the Mercers’ cluster and apply via your school/college.\n\nSpeak with your School Liaison Officer (SLO) for the Guild, who will be a member of the school/college staff; if you do not know who this is, ask your Head of Year, Head of Careers Guidance, or a senior member of school staff. Your SLO will be able to explain the application and admission process. The Guild’s School Court Assistant (SCA) will also be involved with the application, selection, and admission process. Pupils/students nominated by their school for the apprenticeship scheme need to be supported by the SLO and SCA, as well as having their application supported by a parent/guardian.\n\nThe Guild application form needs to be accompanied by a copy of your FULL birth certificate, a copy of your CV and a personal statement setting out why you want to join the apprenticeship scheme, what you hope to get out of it, and what you might contribute to the Guild once you have converted to become a full Guildman.\n\nThe Guild enrolment fee is £50, payable when your application is submitted. Thereafter, the annual subscription for an apprentice is £25 payable on 1 July each year.\n\nAfter four years, you will be invited to convert to a full Guildman. You need to submit an essay on any aspect of the City of London, between 1,000 and 2,000 words and must include a list of sources. You should discuss the subject of your essay with your Apprentice Master about six months beforehand. You are then eligible to gain the Freedom of the City of London by servitude.\n\nIf you have attended one of the schools or colleges in the Mercers’ cluster and are over 18 years of age, you can join the Guild by direct entry as a Guildman at any time. There is no upper age limit. This involves becoming a Freeman of the City of London by redemption first, then admittance to the Guild. You need to be proposed and seconded by current Guildmen. You can speak to the relevant School Court Assistant and/or contact the Membership Clerk for further information. This can be a lengthy process, as the application for the Freedom of the City needs to be endorsed by two Guildmen who are also Liverymen and be vetted and approved through the Court of Common Council.\n\nAs an apprentice, you are bound in the Chamberlain’s Court at Guildhall in the City of London and sign your Indenture certificate, along with a parent/guardian and your Apprentice Master. Afterwards, on the same afternoon, you make your Guild Declaration at the Guild’s Membership Court, also held at Guildhall.\n\nAs a Guildman or Honorary Guildman, you are granted the Freedom of the City of London in the Chamberlain’s Court at Guildhall. Afterwards, on the same afternoon, you make your Guild Declaration at the Guild’s Membership Court, also held at Guildhall."
