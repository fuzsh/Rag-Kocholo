        "text": "The Master - Mike Lakin\n\nMike joined the Fan Makers in 1995 from its affiliated TA Army Unit, 217 Field Squadron Royal Engineers (EOD) Explosive Ordnance Disposal with which he servedfor 10 years until 1999 from Sapper to Captain. He trained as Geologist which led to a 40 year career in the energy sector. He advises international energy companies and governments on managing their international energy asset portfolios. He is married to Charlie and they have 2 boys. They have a 13th Century Gate house in the Dordogne, which Mike has spent the last 10 years renovating from basement to roof.\n\nMike also enjoys golf, rifle shooting and walking. Mike prefers watching rugby to football having been involved intraining the Ealing Trailfinders and loves watching most forms of cricket. Cooking and good food is another regular hobby which Mike is looking forward to enjoying more of during the weekday events that forms a key part of a Masterâs year.\n\nFree Warden - Antony Robson\n\nAntony joined the Fan Makers in 1990. In 1966 age 16, he was in the first public school football team to visit and play in Czechoslovakia. This experience of life âbehind the curtainâ left a lasting impression and held him in good stead for all the challenges that arose to marry his wife Albena in 1973.\n\nQualifying as a Chartered Surveyor in 1974 he became a Fellow in 1983. Was a Partner in White Druce & Brown Chartered Surveyors in the West End Est 1890, through mid 70âs to mid-80âs then, for 8 years, with US Partners and commuting to the USA monthly, developing Golf and Tennis Resorts, managed by Four Seasons Hotels in Scottsdale Arizona, Hawaii, Mexico, and Puerto Rico.\n\nHe is a Member of the Berkshire and Royal Cinque Ports Golf Clubs and had the honour to be Captain of the Fan Makers Golfing Society in 2010, which he still avidly supports. Â He currently owns and runs Milestone & Collis, Chartered Surveyors in Twickenham Established in 1890.\n\nForeign Warden - Dinesh Naidu\n\nDinesh commenced his career as project engineer in the automotive industry and then went on to establish an energy conservation business in the 1970s.\n\nDinesh was introduced to Fan Makers by Past Master Peter Lush in 2009. Dinesh said âI had known Peter for about twenty years, mainly through shooting, when he invited me to a dinner at Skinners Hall. As someone who was oblivious to the existence of Livery Companies, I was awestruck by the entire eventâ.\n\nHe is married to Valerie and has four children and five grandchildren and is now retired and living in the Cotswolds.\n\nSince joining the Fan Makers, Dinesh has been actively involved with the Livery Committee, the Recruitment Committee and Fan Makers Shooting Society.\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nThe earliest known version of the Fan Makersâ Company arms is seen in Maitlandâs History of London of 1739 and show a large fan below a shaving iron, a bundle of fan sticks and a frame saw, all tools of the fan stick makerâs trade. The crest of a hand holding an open fan is first recorded in 1780. The shield and crest had been used for many years before they were formally granted by the College of Arms in 1991. The heraldic supporters in the arms symbolise different aspects of modern mechanical fan making and were granted in 2015. The Company began its association with the mechanical fan industry early in the 20th century and has since had many Liverymen and Masters from this field.\n\nThe Court\n\nThe Fan Makers are regulated by a governing body which is today referred to as the Court (the Board of Directors) composed of the Master elected for one year, two Wardens from whom the Master would normally be elected, and 13 Assistants. Â In addition there are two elected officers- the Clerk, who provides the administrative support for the Company, and the Beadle, our Master of Ceremonies.\n\nOur Home\n\nSaddlers' Hall is a livery hall located in the City of London, near St. Paul's Cathedral. The hall was originally built in 1395, but has undergone several renovations over the years. The current building was designed by Robert Hooke and completed in 1689. The interior of the hall is adorned with impressive artwork and furnishings, including a 17th-century staircase and a portrait of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nLearn more\n\nThe Shooting Society\n\nThe Shooting Society welcomes all members who enjoy shooting to join them at the annual inter-livery clay shoot. Other shooting events, both clay and game, are held each year on an ad hoc basis. There is no membership fee and each event is attended on a pay as you shoot basis. Itâs all about enjoying the day and whatever your standard of shooting youâll fit in.\n\nEmail the shooting society\n\nThe Golf Society\n\nThe Society was established in 1932 and the following year became a member of The Livery Companies Golfing Society which organises the Prince Arthur Cup, the most prestigious golf competition in Livery circles.\n\nThe ethos behind the Society is for friendly social occasions with the standard of play being of less importance.\n\nemail the golf society"
