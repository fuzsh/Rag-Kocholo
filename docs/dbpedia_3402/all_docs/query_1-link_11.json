        "text": "Education\n\nThe Company’s principal aims start with the development of transport education for public benefit. Our Education Committee, has put together a programme of extremely interesting events for teaching, learning and sharing. To provide a place where everyone feels comfortable, the lectures will be hybrid events, taking place so that you may attend a live lecture or attend on Zoom. The choice is yours but your participation is needed to make these events a success. If you would like to know more then please contact the Chairman of the Education Panel by email – education@thecarmen.co.uk\n\nOur Hall is administered by The Worshipful Company of Carmen St Dunstan Heritage Trust (Registered Charity No. 1174950), which provides resources to advance education, knowledge and research into transport and logistics; and especially about the development of the occupation of a carman. It does this in two ways – by the establishment of a museum and gallery at the Hall; and by providing state of the art facilities and equipment, for use by The Worshipful Company of Carmen and others, to offer in-depth transport education for schools and other educational institutions as well as their students.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Carmen Benevolent Trust CIO (Registered Charity No. 1164687) is an important partner in this work, having helped to establish facilities at the Hall and by being involved in identifying educational institutions where knowledge about the industry can be circulated. Our Benevolent Trust also provides grants to schools in London where the needs of students might not otherwise be met and it works with schools supported by the City of London to place students from disadvantaged backgrounds, so they may achieve their potential.\n\nEach Court meeting reviews the educational work undertaken by the Trusts as well as initiatives in hand, along with reports from our own Education Panel, which helps to identify and advance educational work through the Trusts.\n\nWhy is the name “The Worshipful Company of Carmen”?\n\nA Worshipful Company refers to its origins as a religious order or fraternity that first met in worship. A City of London livery company is one of the various craft or trade associations of the City, most of which are descended from medieval guilds. Hand carts were the first mode of transport used for distributing goods. They were moved by Cartmen and it is easy to see that this name has been changed over time to Carmen."
