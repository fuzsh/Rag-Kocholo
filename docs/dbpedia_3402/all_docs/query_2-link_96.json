PROOF OF PUBLICATION.\n\nWhere by law or by order of court, the publication in a newspaper of any process, notice or order, shall be required, evidence of such publication shall be given by affidavit of the editor, publisher, manager, foreman, clerk or printer of such newspaper, not interested in the application for registration to which such publication relates, to which affidavit shall be attached a copy of such process, notice or order, and which affidavit shall also specify the dates and times when and the newspaper in which the publication was made. And it will also be the duty of the publisher of such process, notice or order, to duly file with the registrar said affidavit before the time fixed for hearing the matter to which the affidavit relates.\n\nRule 12. NOTICES.\n\nThe citation shall be filed and the filing attorney or party shall thereupon examine the application, the examiner's report, the map and all papers filed with the record to see that all persons interested in any way in the title have been properly included in the citation. After thus checking it, the filing attorney or party shall file the original with the record which shall be entitled \"Original Citation\" and the filing attorney or party shall send a copy to the newspaper designated to publish the same. A copy of the citation as printed shall be filed in the record and be marked \"Printed Citation.\" Any corrections made by the filing attorney or party on the copy sent to the publisher shall also be noted on the original filed with the record. The description of the property sought to be registered contained in the citation shall be the correct description as found by the surveyor as given in his final report.\n\nAll citations and other notices ordered to be published by the court shall be published once in each of 3 consecutive weeks (3 insertions). The date of the hearing shall be determined by the registrar and inserted in the citation before sending it to the newspaper.\n\nNotices by mail shall be by registered letter as provided for by statute and a return receipt shall be required in all cases; but in mailing such notices, the registrar may require that the return receipt be signed by the addressee only.\n\nNotices generated electronically shall have the same effect and power as notices by registered letter as provided for by statute and the Hawaiʻi Electronic Filing and Service Rules.\n\nWhenever, in any case, a notice given in accordance with the land registration act or the general forms of procedure or otherwise is held by the court to be insufficient, it may order such further notice as the case requires.\n\n(Amended November 6, 2019, effective November 17, 2019.)\n\nRule 13. PETITIONS AND ORDERS OF AMENDMENT.\n\nPetitions to amend maps and orders thereon, and petitions to amend applications where a corresponding change on the map is necessary and orders thereon shall be filed electronically or conventionally, if the petitioner is not required or qualified to file electronically.\n\n(Amended November 6, 2019, effective November 17, 2019.)\n\nRule 14. NOTATION OF ENCUMBRANCES.\n\nAll encumbrances shall be set forth in detail in the final decree and not by reference to other documents.\n\nEncumbrances may be noted on transfer certificates of title by reference, only when the document referred to is on file in the office of the assistant registrar of the land court.\n\nRule 15. SUBDIVISIONS.\n\n(1) A petition for the subdivision of land or for the consolidation of lots of a previous subdivision or for the designation of an easement or matters of a like nature shall be filed in duplicate and shall be signed and sworn to by the person in whose name the certificate of title has issued or by his attorney or by an agent duly authorized by him. In the latter case, the power of attorney of the agent must be filed with the petition. A map shall be filed with each petition. Leases, mortgages and similar encumbrances need not be noted or referred to if all lots in the subdivision are affected. When any of the encumbrances affects one or more but not all of the lots created by such subdivision and it is desired to confine such encumbrance or encumbrances to the lot or lots affected, the petition shall clearly set forth the lot or lots affected.\n\n(2) Where land is held in undivided interests by co-owners, no single co-owner shall subdivide the land, except with the written consent of the other owners.\n\n(3) The words \"subdivision\" and \"re-subdivision\" shall not be used interchangeably, one for the other, but shall be employed only in their strict grammatical sense. Two or more contiguous lots or parcels of land in the same application may be consolidated and re-subdivided into lots having other dimensions and areas, in the same petition; provided that the total area of the first set of lots and the total area of the newly created lots shall be the same.\n\n(4) A petition for subdivision, or the map accompanying it, shall evidence any necessary approval by county agencies. (See Rule 104 of these rules.)\n\n(5) A copy of the petition, the map, and the certificate of title shall by order of court be transmitted to the state land surveyor for check and report. Upon receipt of the return and report of the state land surveyor and completion by the petitioner of the additional things to be done, if any, an \"Order of Subdivision\" shall issue under the seal of the court, which order shall reflect all changes caused by the subdivision, in encumbrances, reservations, restrictions or otherwise. The map of the subdivision shall also be endorsed as follows: \"Authorized and approved by order of the Judge of the Land Court dated ______________. By Order of the Court\" and be signed by the registrar of the land court.\n\n(6) After approval by the judge of the land court, a subdivision map may not be altered either by adding other matters thereto or deleting therefrom any writings recorded thereon. Any change relating to land delineated on a map previously approved may only be registered by the filing of a new petition and map.\n\n(7) Exceptions to the foregoing Rule 15 [sic] may be made at any time by order of the court upon good cause being shown therefor.\n\nRule 16. NOTICE TO ATTORNEYS.\n\n(a) Changing attorney. If a party shall change the party’s attorney, pending any proceeding, the name of the new attorney shall be substituted on the docket for that of the former attorney, and notice thereof given to any adverse party; and until such notice of the change of an attorney, all notices given to or by the former attorney shall be considered in all respects as notice to or from the attorney’s client, except in cases in which by law the notice is required to be given to the party personally; provided, however, that nothing in these Rules shall be construed to prevent any party who is a natural person from appearing without attorney representation in the manner provided by law.\n\n(b) Parties appearing without attorney representation. In cases where a natural person party appears in a case without attorney representation, the natural person party so appearing shall be subject to the same rules and requirements that are or may be provided for attorneys in like cases, so far as the same are applicable.\n\n(Amended November 6, 2019, effective November 17, 2019.)\n\nRule 17. DEPOSITIONS AND DISCOVERY.\n\nDepositions and discovery in land court shall be governed by the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaiʻi and the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure except that in any proceeding: (1) the land court may, by order, direct that Chapter V of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure shall not be applicable to the proceeding if the court for good cause finds that the application thereof would not be feasible or would work an injustice; and (2) if the proceeding be ex parte any deposition therein upon oral examination or upon written interrogatories shall be pursuant to motion and order of court, rather than pursuant to notice as set forth in subdivision (a) of Rule 30 or subdivision (a) of Rule 31 of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure, and in any such case the order of court shall, for all purposes relating to said Chapter V, take the place of said notice.\n\nAny subpoenas for use in land court shall be governed by Rule 45 of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n(Amended November 6, 2019, effective November 17, 2019.)\n\nRule 18. RESERVED.\n\nRule 19. DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS,\n\nHOW FILED AND DISPOSED OF.\n\nAll deposition transcripts submitted electronically will be subject to the Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure and Hawaiʻi Electronic Filing and Service Rules. All parties required or qualified to file documents electronically, who wish to have deposition testimony entered into the record when the transcript is actually used as testimony (other than as an exhibit in another document) shall electronically file with the land court such deposition transcript or portions of the transcript. All conventionally submitted deposition transcripts may be electronically scanned and filed to the case docket by the registrar when appropriately received. The registrar may require any deposition transcript conventionally submitted to be submitted in electronic form. The deposition transcript shall afterwards be in the registrar’s custody, subject to the order of the court and the Hawaiʻi Court Records Rules, as other documents in the case.\n\n(a) A deposition transcript will generally not be filed with the court, except if any portion of the transcript is used as testimony during an evidentiary hearing. The deposition transcript cannot be filed before the evidentiary hearing. The entire testimony from a deposition transcript shall be electronically filed with the court by the attorney using deposition testimony no later than 48 hours after its actual use; provided that a party who is a natural person party and is not required or qualified to file documents electronically may conventionally submit to the registrar such deposition testimony within the same time period.\n\n(b) If the deposition testimony is not read into the record at the evidentiary hearing by the party taking it, it may be used by any other party, if the other party see fit, to the same extent that it could be used by the other party if the other party had taken it and paid the cost of taking the same. If the non-noticing party uses the deposition transcript, the deposition transcript shall be electronically filed with the court in accordance with section (a), above.\n\n(Amended November 6, 2019, effective November 17, 2019.)\n\nRule 20. MASTERS.\n\n(a) Appointment and Compensation. The land court may appoint special masters. As used in these Rules, the word “master” includes a referee, an auditor, an examiner, or an assessor. The compensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties or paid out of any fund or subject matter of the action, which is in the custody and control of the court, as the court may direct.
