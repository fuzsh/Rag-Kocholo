        "text": "Diversity Charter\n\nMusic, with its wide range of genres and huge variety of appeal, engages the whole of society in one way or another. As one of the largest City of London Livery Companies, and the only one dedicated solely to the performing arts, The Musicians’ Company is proud of the diversity we encourage and embrace. We are fortunate that approaching 25% of our membership comprises our prize winners as Company Young Artists: young, talented professional musicians at the start of their career who come from a broad range of backgrounds and from all over the globe.\n\nWe believe that attracting a wider pool of talent to engage with all Livery Companies will not only reflect our society more closely, but also help build a City of London fit for both the present and the future.\n\nTo support this The Court of The Musicians’ Company will:\n\nConsider the evolving skill-sets and expertise required over time for the effective governance of The Company when voting on candidates for the position of Court Assistant regardless of their individual ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability.\n\nWelcome candidates who wish to make a positive contribution to The Company when proposing them for the Freedom regardless of their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability.\n\nFocus upon the ability and relevant experience of candidates when voting on appointments to Company committees regardless of their individual ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age or disability, whether they are liverymen, freemen, young artists or corporate members.\n\nContinue to enhance, wherever practicable (and including both face to face and virtual means), our Young Artists Outreach programme with schools and organisations engaging with those living with Alzheimer’s, dementia and physical or neurological injury, to encourage inclusivity regarding our performers, recipients and other volunteering participants.\n\nReflect the diversity of The Company in published material and images, including social media, relating to all our activities including public, City and Livery Company events.\n\nContinue to encourage interest from people of diverse backgrounds who may be unfamiliar with the Company, for example through invitations to our public performances and competitions, functions etc. whether they be audience members, performers, speakers or guests.\n\nEncourage people from diverse backgrounds, who share our aspirations and wish to make a positive contribution to our work and Fellowship, to consider joining or supporting The Musicians’ Company whether they be involved in various aspects of the music profession, are active amateur musicians, audience members or music lovers who cannot themselves sing or play a note."
