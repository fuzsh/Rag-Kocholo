        "text": "We are a modern City of London Livery Company of senior, leading engineers from industry and academia representing the full diversity of today’s engineering. We are a fellowship which aims to enhance the future engineering wellbeing of the nation.\n\nThrough our high-quality formal and social functions (most with partners) at prestigious venues in the City and wider afield, we share professional engineering knowledge with lectures, visits and networking events. We are in effect a learned society. We also promote engineering through our interaction with other Livery Companies, the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and others in the City of London.\n\nFounded in 1983, we are considered a ‘modern’ Company at ninety-fourth in the order of precedence. We now have over 300 members, both men and women Chartered Engineers, who live and work throughout the United Kingdom and overseas, and cover all branches of the engineering disciplines.\n\nIn 2004, we became the first Livery Company to receive a Royal Charter for 47 years.\n\nThe Company is governed by a Court consisting of the Master and Wardens and not less than 10 or more than 30 Assistants, including the five immediate Past Masters of the Company.\n\nEach year the Court elects from its ranks a Master together with a Senior, Middle and Junior Warden. The Court is responsible for policy, strategy and overall management of the Company and appoints a Clerk, as the Chief Executive Officer, to manage its day-to-day affairs.\n\nThe Court is supported by a number of standing committees including the Nominations Committee, Remuneration Committee, Finance and General Purposes Committee, Membership Committee, Programme Committee and Muniments Committee.\n\nThe Company is governed by the Court which meets four times per year under the chairmanship of the Master. The Court consists of the Master, the three Wardens and not less than ten or more than 30 voting members (including the five most immediate Past Masters) who are elected by the Livery. The Master and the three Wardens are elected by the Court to serve for a one-year term in each of the four roles. The Clerk, Chaplain and Assistants Emeritus are honorary non-voting members of Court.\n\nSix standing committees report directly to Court covering ‘Nominations’ and ‘Remuneration’ (both chaired by the Master) Finance and General Policy and Muniments (both chaired by the Senior Warden), Membership (chaired by the Middle Warden) and Programme (chaired by the Junior Warden).\n\nThe work of the Court and Committees is supported by the Office, comprising of the Clerk, Assistant Clerk, Events Co-ordinator and Beadle."
