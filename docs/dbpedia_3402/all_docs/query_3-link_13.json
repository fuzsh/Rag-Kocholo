        "text": "Livery companies probably had their origins in this country before 1066 and are similar to the guilds and fraternities that flourished throughout Europe for many centuries. Members paid to belong and the word ‘guild’ derives from the Saxon ‘gildan’ meaning ‘to pay’.\n\nThese early guilds controlled the provision of services and the manufacture and sale of goods in the City. They protected their members and customers by checking for substandard work.\n\n​\n\nTo this day, street names in the City of London such as Milk Street, Bread Street, Ironmonger Lane, Poultry, Cloth Fair and Masons' Avenue bear witness to those early times.\n\nToday's livery companies represent different professions, trades and crafts, both past and present.\n\n​\n\nThey play an active role in nurturing their crafts, trades and professions, serve the community through voluntary work and charitable giving, support the City of London and promote their professions within it. Livery companies donate millions of pounds to charity each year, either directly through financial contributions or pro bono support.\n\n​\n\nThere are 111 livery companies. The oldest include the Weavers, Mercers, Grocers, Merchant Taylors, Haberdashers, Stationers and Vintners. Newer companies include the World Traders, Tax Advisers, Security Professionals, Solicitors, Hackney Carriage Drivers, International Bankers, Management Consultants, Marketors, Educators, and Arts Scholars. There are currently four other guilds and companies on their way to achieving full livery status, including the Company of Communicators.\n\n​\n\nAncient traditions associated with livery companies include the right of liverymen and women to elect the City Sheriffs and the Lord Mayor. The livery companies also play a prominent part in occasions such as the Lord Mayor's Show in the City of London, the United Guilds' service held at St Pauls Cathedral and at the annual Sheep Drive over London Bridge. Pageantry and ceremony form the more colourful aspects of livery life.\n\nWe encourage members to take the Freedom of the City of London.\n\n​\n\nOnce we achieve full Worshipful status, those members who have gained the Freedom of the City will be entitled to become 'liverymen', with all the rights and privileges this infers including the right to stand for election and vote for the Lord Mayor and other elected officers of the City of London. Other members will remain as 'freemen'.\n\nThe very first Freedom is believed to have been presented in 1237. A 'freeman' could refer to someone who did not 'belong' to a feudal lord and bestowed a number of privileges such as the right to earn money and own land. Town dwellers who were protected by the charter of their town or city were often 'free' - hence the term 'freedom' of the City.\n\nThe Freedom enabled members of a guild or livery to carry out their trade or craft in the Square Mile. A fee or fine would be charged and in return the livery companies would train apprentices in the craft and be responsible for ensuring that the goods and services provided were of the required standard. In 1835, the Freedom was widened to incorporate not just members of livery companies but also people living or working in the City or those with a strong London connection.\n\n​\n\nThe Freedom confers other privileges, such as the right to drive sheep over London Bridge, to carry a sword, to be hanged with a silk rope and, perhaps more usefully, the right to avoid arrest for being drunk.\n\n​\n\nToday it remains as a unique part of London's history to which many people who have lived or worked in the City have been proud to be admitted. The Freedom in the City today is still closely associated with membership of the City livery companies.\n\nThere are several way to apply for the freedom but the easiest to apply via company\n\nApplicants will receive a letter from the Clerk of the Chamberlain's Court inviting them to make an appointment for their Freedom admission ceremony, following approval by the Court of Aldermen.\n\n​\n\nEach Freedom ceremony is carried out individually in the Chamberlain's Court Room, in the Guildhall."
