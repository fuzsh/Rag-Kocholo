        "text": "1. Name\n\nThe name of the Livery is ‘The Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers of London’ (known as The Coachmakers).\n\n​2. Status\n\nThe Coachmakers is a City Livery Company by Royal Charter.\n\n3. Objects\n\nThe Coachmakers seeks to promote excellence in aerospace, automotive and other transport industries by Awards to Industry and the provision of bursaries and educational trusts. It seeks to maintain close links between the City of London and Her Majesty’s Armed Services by affiliations with a unit from the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force.\n\n4. Management of the Company\n\nThe Company is managed by a Court comprising the Master, Senior Warden, Renter Warden, Junior Warden and up to 23 Assistants and six Stewards. The Master is an ex officio member of all Livery Committees. The Master’s official representative is the Immediate Past Master. The Court appoints a Clerk to the Company who is effectively the Chief Executive Officer. The Clerk is accountable to, and responsible for, advice to the Court and for the administration of the Livery, including the presentation of ideas, the development of policy, and the management of finances with the Renter Warden, Trustees and Accountant. The Clerk is an ex officio member of all Livery Committees and represents the Livery on external Clerk associated committees. He accompanies the Master on representational duties when invited. The Court appoints other subordinate Committees to assist in administering other activities covering policy making, financial investment, management of Coachmakers’ bursaries and charities. Committees also manage social and sporting activities and the Company’s communications. The Court shall meet no fewer than four times per year. A quorum shall consist of three members, one of whom shall be the Master or a Warden. The Master, Wardens and Chairmen of other committees are elected at a meeting of the Court on 1 September each year (The Election Court Meeting). If this date falls on a weekend the Court meeting takes place on the first Monday of September.\n\n5. Charter and Ordinances\n\nThe founding of the Coachmakers is based on the granting of a Charter by King Charles II on 31st May 1677. A Grant of Arms was made on 17th July 1677 and the Ordinances of the Company were confirmed on 7th December 1677. The Oaths to be taken by the Master, Wardens, Assistants, Liverymen, Freemen, Clerk and Beadle on taking office are contained in the Ordinances of the Company. A second Charter was granted to the Company by King James II on 12th May 1687. Finally, a Charter of Restitution was granted to all Companies of the City of London on 23rd October 1688. Copies of these documents are held in the Clerk’s office.\n\n6. Categories of membership\n\nThe categories of membership are:\n\n(a) Royal Liverymen.\n\n(b) Freemen – this category has restrictions on rights and privileges.\n\n(c) Liverymen – they are full members with all rights and privileges.\n\n(d) Liverymen Honoris Causa – appointed by the Court to cement links with our affiliated military units or to recognise some other special link or service to the Livery.\n\n(e) Honorary Freemen – appointed by the Court to include spouses of deceased Past Masters\n\n(f) Companions of the Livery – spouses, at the time of death of deceased Liverymen approved by the Court.\n\n(e) Craft Freemen – persons involved in the ancient craft of the Livery who have achieved pre-eminence including young persons who win awards and bursaries.\n\n7. Procedure for Election of Members\n\nTo be elected, a candidate must be proposed and seconded by two Court members and accepted by the whole Court. Court approval is achieved by circulating to all Court members a copy of the candidate’s application form supported by the candidate’s proposer and seconder. Following the circulation of papers to the Court by the Clerk and subject to there being no dissent registered to the Clerk, candidates will be deemed to have been elected. The Clerk will file on the agenda of the next Court meeting those candidates who have been so elected. The Court may review these nominations. The Clerk will write to elected members advising them of their election. Candidates will return acceptance forms required by the Clerk immediately. Candidates not returning papers by the date determined in the letter advising success in being elected, will be reviewed. Those who have returned papers will be sworn to the Freedom at the next possible Court meeting. Candidate application forms will provide data for initial entries in the database of members. Application forms and supporting documentation will be retained for posterity by the Clerk. Livery Freemen make two visits to the Chamberlain’s Court within three months of being sworn to the Freedom of the Livery to gain admittance to the Freedom of the City of London. Once granted the Freedom of The City of London, Livery Freemen are clothed in the Livery at the next Court meeting and become entitled to all rights and privileges of the Company.\n\n8. Accountant\n\nAt the Audit Court meeting each year a Company Accountant shall be appointed. The duties include keeping proper books of account as are necessary to give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the Company and its charitable funds. Responsibilities include the submission of all returns as may be required by law in relation to the accounts to be rendered at the due time. Financial statements made up to 31st August each year shall be prepared for submission to the Audit Court.\n\n9.
