This document discusses the role of London livery companies and their apprenticeship system in the Elizabethan theater. It argues that, contrary to previous assumptions, many professional players were members of livery companies like the Goldsmiths and Drapers. The apprenticeship system used by the theater resembled the one employed by the livery companies. Apprentice players were often bound to masters who were freemen of livery companies and sometimes achieved freeman status themselves despite training for the stage. Records of the livery companies provide new biographical details about both players and apprentices.",
