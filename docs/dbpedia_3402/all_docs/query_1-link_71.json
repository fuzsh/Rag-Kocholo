        "text": "The Objectives of the Charity\n\nThe Trust was established to “The relief or education of any person of any gender, who is or has been at any time in the manufacture of playing cards or their dependents in poor and necessitous circumstances as directed by the Master, Wardens and Court of Assistants of the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards…”\n\nMore recently, the Trust’s objectives were widened.\n\nThe MPCC aims to support charities that conform to the following criteria:\n\n1 Benefits the under 25 year old groups, not individuals.\n\n2 Educational/training based activities.\n\n3 A revenue of <£1m p.a. so our donation will have a reasonable influence.\n\n4 Geographically located in London or the Home Counties or close to the allocated liaison partner.\n\n5 In all cases, charities should be able to supply us with up to date financial accounts and annual updates on the use of the donation.\n\nThe MPCC will not normally support\n\n1 Start-up charities\n\n2 Housing Associations\n\n3 Places of Worship\n\n4 One-off events such as festivals\n\n5 General appeals or circulars sent to the Company\n\n6 Large projects towards which we would have limited impact\n\n7 Course fees for professionals\n\n8 Schools and PTAs\n\n9 Citizens Advice\n\nGrants to Beneficiary Charities\n\nThe Trust supports a variety of Charities associated with the welfare and support of Children, the education of Children, and for the relief of need and hardship among young people under 25 years.\n\nHow to Apply for a Grant\n\nThe Makers of Playing Cards Charity is a small grant-maker and grants are generally of £1,000 in the first instance.\n\nThe Trustees meet to consider grant applications in May and October each year. Applications should arrive no later than the end of March for consideration in May, or the end of August for consideration in October.\n\nThe application should:\n\n• be no longer than one side of A4.\n\n• set out how you would spend a grant of £1,000.\n\n• explain briefly how the work for which you seek funds meets the Makers of Playing Cards Charity’s charitable objectives.\n\n• include a copy of your most recent annual report and accounts\n\n• be sent via email only to the Prime Almoner of the Makers of Playing Cards Charity at: charityalmoners@makersofplayingcards.co.uk\n\nYour application will be acknowledged and in due course considered by the Trustees. You will then receive either an email to inform you that your application is unsuccessful or an offer letter setting out the terms of the grant and enclosing a cheque for the sum granted. By banking the cheque, you are deemed to have accepted the conditions of the grant.\n\nCharity Liaison\n\nWe keep in touch with all our beneficiaries by appointing a Charity Liaison Partner who may well visit the charity and will be pleased to be invited to special events of that charity. They may also report back to the Prime Almoner on the impact of the grant.\n\nBeneficiaries who continue to have the support of their Charity Liaison Partner will be eligible for consideration for a further grant on the anniversary of the previous grant. Charities may be considered for grants for periods of up to six consecutive years providing the terms of the grant have been met for each year. Charities will not normally be considered for funding covering more than six years in any 10."
