        "text": "The Livery Companies of the City of London are various historic trade associations almost all of which are known as the “Worshipful Company of…” their relevant trade, craft or profession. The medieval Companies originally developed as guilds and were responsible for the regulation of their trades, controlling, for instance, wages and labour conditions. Until the Protestant Reformation, they were closely associated with religious activities, notably in support of chantry chapels and churches and the observance of ceremonies, notably the mystery plays.\n\nSome of the Livery Companies continue to have a professional role today: for example, the Scriveners’ Company admits senior members to that profession, the Apothecaries’ Company awards post-graduate qualifications in some medical specialties, and the Hackney Carriage Drivers’ Company comprises licensed London taxicab drivers who have learnt the “knowledge of London.” Other Companies have become purely charitable foundations, such as the Longbow Makers’ Company.\n\nThe active Companies, which currently number 108, play an important part in social life and networking in the City and have a long and proud history of cultural and education patronage. They retain voting rights for the City of London Corporation, the local authority with extensive local government powers.\n\nAfter the Worshipful Company of Carmen was accepted in 1746, no new Companies were formed for over 100 years until the Master Mariners in 1926 (granted livery in 1932). Post-1926 Companies are often called modern Livery Companies.\n\nFormed in 1999, the Security Professionals’ Company became the 108th Livery Company on 19 February 2008 when the Court of Aldermen approved their petition for livery. Two bodies, the Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks and the Company of Watermen and Lightermen, are recognised as City companies but without the grant of livery for historical reasons; three further guilds (the Company of Educators; Public Relations Practitioners; and, the Company of Arts Scholars) aim to obtain a grant of livery.\n\nGovernance\n\nLivery Companies are governed by a Master (known in some Companies as the Prime Warden or Bailiff), a number of Wardens (who may be known as the Upper, Middle, Lower, or Renter Wardens), and a Court of Assistants, which elects the Master and Wardens. The chief operating officer of the Company is known as the Clerk.\n\nMembers generally fall into two categories: freemen and liverymen. One may become a freeman, or acquire the “freedom of the company,” upon fulfilling the Company’s criteria: traditionally, one may be admitted by “patrimony,” if either parent was a liveryman of the Company; by “servitude,” if one has served the requisite number of years as an apprentice to the Company; or by “redemption,” by paying a fee. The Company may also vote to admit individuals as honorary freemen. Freemen are generally entitled to advance to becoming liverymen by a vote of the court of the Company. Only liverymen can take part in the election of the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs, and the other traditional officers of the City.\n\nLivery Halls\n\nMany Companies still operate a livery hall where members and their guests can be entertained and Company business transacted. Among the earliest Companies known to have had halls are the Merchant Taylors and Goldsmiths in the 14th Century, but neither theirs nor any other Companies’ original halls remain: the few that survived the Great Fire of London were destroyed in the Blitz of the Second World War.\n\nToday, 39 out of the 108 livery companies have halls in London, in addition to that of the Watermen and Lightermen, which is not strictly a livery hall but in regular use. Most are commonly available for business and social functions, such as weddings, commercial and society meetings, luncheons and dinners. The oldest hall now extant is that of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, dating from 1672. Several companies that do not have their own hall share office premises within a hall of another company on a semi-permanent basis, and examples are the Spectacle Makers’ Company, which uses part of Apothecaries’ Hall, and the Shipwrights, which co-habit with the Ironmongers. Three Livery Companies (the Glaziers and Painters of Glass, Launderers, and Scientific Instrument Makers) share a hall in Southwark, just south of but outside of the City of London, while the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers is based at Proof House, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and the Master Mariners’ ‘hall’ is an historical ship, HQS Wellington, moored in the Thames and shared with the Scriveners Company. Companies without their own hall will customarily book use of another hall for their formal livery functions, thus giving their members the opportunity to visit and appreciate a large number of livery halls by rotation. Many Blue Plaques in the City of London indicate where a number of companies used to have halls. However, whilst several livery companies may aspire to eventually owning, or again owning, their own hall it is appreciated that any increase in the overall number of livery halls would inevitably lead to some dilution of use of the existing halls. There is also some attraction in belonging to a company which is peripatetic.\n\nPrecedence\n\nIn 1515, the Court of Aldermen of the City of London settled an order of precedence for the 48 Livery Companies then in existence, which was based on the Companies’ economic or political power. The first 12 Companies are known as the Great Twelve City Livery Companies. There are now 108 Companies, with modern Companies ranked by seniority.\n\nThe Merchant Taylors and the Skinners have always disputed their precedence, so once a year (at Easter) they exchange sixth and seventh place in the order. This alternation is one of the theories for the origin of the phrase “at sixes and sevens,” as the master of the Merchant Taylors has asserted a number of times, although the first use of the phrase may have been before the Taylors and the Skinners decided to alternate their position. The dispute is due to their both receiving their charters in 1327, but there is no proof as to which was the first.\n\nList of Companies in Order of Precedence\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Gunmakers,
