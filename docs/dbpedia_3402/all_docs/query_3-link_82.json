        "text": "City of London livery companies comprise London’s ancient and modern trade associations and guilds. The earliest guilds date back to the 12th century when people working in the same craft in London grouped together to regulate competition within their trade and maintain high standards.\n\nThe term livery company was introduced when guilds started introducing their own clothing and regalia – or livery – to distinguish their members from other guilds. Today, there are 111 liveries that support matters of trade, education, charity and fellowship within their sector. They also play an integral part in the City’s governance."
