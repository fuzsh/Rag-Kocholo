        "text": "The Arts Scholars have three Wardens: Renter, Middle and Upper in ascending levels of seniority. Each is elected at the Election Court and it is expected that the incumbents might progress each year from one level to the next to end up as Master, although each step remains at the discretion of the Court.\n\n​\n\nEach year the Wardens organise the “Anthology of Skills” evening. This involves a series of presentations by members on a wide range of subjects around a common theme, in previous years being the “Cabinet of Curiosities” at the Museum of London, the “Grand Tour” at Freemasons’ Hall, “Mad, Bad and Dangerous…” at The Old Bailey and “Holbein and the Holbeinesque” at Barber-Surgeons’ Hall. Arts Scholars are encouraged to share their own areas of expertise on these varied and lively occasions.\n\nThe Clerk is the Company’s sole employee, and provides the day to day management and administration of the Company, and liaison with Company members and with other city entities. The Clerk is appointed by the Court and reports to the Court and the Master, and fulfils a vital role in all aspects of the Company’s life and character, providing continuity from one Master to the next, often over many years.\n\nParticipation in the Company’s committees provides the most involved and “hands–on” experience of the Company’s day to day activities and projects. Each committee is chaired by a member of the Court and is made up of a broad cross-section of Liverymen and some Freemen. Committee members are appointed by each of the chairmen and appointments generally last for three to five years, so we can ensure that as many members as possible can be involved. Members are welcome (indeed encouraged!) to serve on more than one committee. Committees generally meet 4 or 5 times a year, usually in the 2 or 3 weeks before the next Court meeting. The Master and Wardens are entitled (expected) to attend all committee meetings in an ex officio capacity, to provide an overall view and to feel the pulse of the Company and its various activities.\n\nEvents are arranged by the Company’s subsidiary, Arts Scholars Events Ltd. The Events Committee assists the Events Company to provide a broad range of entertaining and attractive events through the year, involving a variety of types, topics and costs.\n\n​\n\nApart from the formal Company events such as the Annual Banquet, the Installation Dinner, Livery Dinner and Common Hall, the committee arranges smaller and less formal events such as visits to important collections and premises (recent examples being the American Museum in Bath, Knole in Kent, mudlarking on the Thames foreshore, and handling sessions at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge). Many of the visits are made possible by Arts Scholars working at the venues concerned and entail privileged access and activities not available to the general public.\n\n​\n\nThe committee is always keen to receive ideas for future events, as it helps the Events Company in its mission to provide an exciting range of unique occasions without hesitation, repetition or deviation.\n\n​\n\nThe Events Committee also organises trips further afield, including to the Catherine the Great Exhibition at Houghton Hall (2014), to her palaces in and around St. Petersburg (2015), to Rome (2016) and to Madrid and Toledo (2018). The 2021 trip is planned for Transylvania.\n\nThe Education Committee oversees the Company’s educational projects and liaises with the Charity Committee (see Charitable Trust below) in respect of requests to the Trust for financial support for educational initiatives.\n\n​\n\nThe committee organises the Eva Weininger Spring Lecture and the “Anthology of Skills” events which involve a series of presentations by members for members, including the “Cabinet of Curiosities” afternoon at the Museum of London (2015) and the “ Grand Tour ” evening at Freemasons’ Hall (2016). The 2017 event will be at Court No. 1 The Old Bailey, in February 2017, on the theme of art and crime, entitled “Mad, Bad and Dangerous…” .\n\n​\n\nThe committee is also working on the provision on our website of arts-related careers advice for schools, and advises the Master on a speaker for the Mithras Lecture, which is the Company’s pre-eminent lecture for our members and the Masters and members of other Livery Companies each year.\n\nThe Charitable Trust is an independent charity registered with the Charity Commission. It was established by the Company to pursue the Company’s charitable goals in the support of the historic and decorative arts and to pursue its wider charitable causes. These objectives are fundamental to the Company’s role and members are strongly encouraged to contribute to the Arts Scholars Charitable Trust funds on a regular basis, and (it is hoped!) to remember our Trust in their wills.\n\n​\n\nTrustees are appointed by the Court from the membership of the Company. Having been so appointed, the Trustees carry out their duties in pursuit of the Trust’s charitable goals, independently from the Company in accordance with charity law. The funds of the Charitable Trust are entirely separate from the funds of the Company.\n\n​\n\nOur charity policy is focused upon support for curation, exhibition, education, training and career development in the historic and decorative arts, particularly where we can make a real difference, have a significant impact for the beneficiary and increase diversity and opportunity in the historic and decorative arts.\n\nOn 28th January 2013 William Hunt, Windsor Herald at the College of Arms, presented to the Company Letters Patent dated 14 September 2012 granting a Coat of Arms at a ceremony at Merchant Taylors' Hall, in the City of London, in the presence of the Lord Mayor of London.\n\n​\n\nThe significance of each of the components of this Coat of Arms is as follows,\n\n​\n\nCrest: A Brock (Badger) holding a golden horn (Or), in reference to the Company’s two founders, Lord Brooke and Jonathan Horne.\n\n​\n\nShield: Gules (red), signifying magnanimity, in reference to the Company’s charitable work. Set with a depiction of the Horne Cup, donated by the Court in memory of Jonathan Horne. Crossed spears, an allusion to the Roman soldiers’ practice of planting a spear in the ground to advertise an auction. The reference to Roman practice (and the head of Mithras on the Company’s Badge) symbolises the Arts Scholars’ study, conservation and trade in items from ancient to modern times.\n\n​\n\nSupporters: Symbolising two facets of guardianship of ancient treasures: a Squirrel holding a golden acorn, signifying the careful collector, and the Dragon, the symbol of the City of London and of the fierce protector, here cradling a pot of excavated Roman gold.\n\n​\n\nMotto: Artes in Urbe Colamus – “We Cherish (or Foster) Arts in the City”, devised by Past Master and archaeologist Dr. Geoff Egan FSA."
