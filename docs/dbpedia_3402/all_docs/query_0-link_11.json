        "text": "Livery company of the City of London\n\nThe Worshipful Company of World Traders is one of the 111 Livery Companies of the City of London.\n\nThe Guild of World Traders was constructed in 1985 and it became a Company in 1993. Its petition for livery status was granted by the Court of Aldermen with effect from 2000. The Worshipful Company draws its membership from the international trade fraternity, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of, and standards of practice in, world trade. The Company ranks 101st in the order of precedence of the City Livery Companies. Its motto is Commerce and Honest Friendship with All, taken from Thomas Jefferson's inaugural Presidential speech.\n\nThe founding of the World Traders Association movement gave rise to the creation of trading complexes in over 160 cities throughout the world. London was the first in Europe, built in St Katharine Docks beside the Tower of London (though this World Trade Centre closed in 1994). Over 1,000 years earlier the same land was used by the Knighten Guilde to trade in foreign goods, and in 1979 the then Lord Mayor, Sir Peter Gadsden, suggested that this tradition be revived by the creation of the Guild of World Traders to represent members of the international trading community in the City of London.\n\nThe Company's founding Master was Mr Peter Drew OBE.[2] From the outset the World Traders were determined to be a working Guild, only accepting members from the international trade fraternity, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of, and standards of practice in, world trade.\n\nThe Company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies.[3][4]\n\nMembers of World Traders consist of people with an interest in world trade. Many are brokers, traders or linked to financial services. As well as UK-based British nationals, a significant number of the Livery are overseas nationals based in the UK, dual nationals, British nationals who live overseas and overseas nationals who live in their home country.\n\nThe Company’s hallmark annual event is the Tacitus Lecture, begun in 1988, now one of the largest intellectual events in the City of London’s calendar. The event gives a senior individual an opportunity to initiate a discussion of serious concerns about world trade in a global forum.\n\n23 November 1974 General Assembly of the World Trade Centers Association held at London Guildhall. Alderman Richard Charvet suggested the creation of the Guild of World Traders in London.\n\n26 November 1979 Lord Mayor Alderman Sir Peter Gadsden laid foundation stone of International House (part of the then London World Trade Centre complex) and reiterates the suggestion of the creation of the Guild of World Traders.\n\n24 October 1985 Foundation of the Guild of World Traders in London.[5]\n\n15 June 1993 Grant by the Court of Aldermen to become The Company of World Traders.\n\n9 November 1999 Petition to become The Worshipful Company of World Traders agreed by the Court of Aldermen, with effect from 1 January 2000.\n\n25 January 2000 Company received its letters patent in a ceremony at Mansion House, from the Lord Mayor, Alderman Clive Martin.\n\n10 July 2013 Queen Elizabeth II granted a Royal Charter to the Company. The World Traders Company has company number RC000872 (RC denoting Royal Charter).\n\nThe Arms of the Company were designed by Sir Colin Cole, Garter Principal King of Arms, and presented by him at the Installation ceremony of Alderman Sir Peter Gadsden, the Guild's new Master, in 1987. These Arms depict five purses symbolising trade between the five continents, with the sword and wheel of St Catherine together with the water and quayside of the dock, as a reminder of the company's foundation. The Arms are surmounted by an escarbuncle containing a medieval merchant's cap and the supporters are a dolphin borrowed from the Company of Watermen and Lightermen, who originally gave the company sanctuary in the City of London, and the sea dragon of the City as a mark of respect for its commands.\n\nThe Master's Badge of office displays the Company's coat of arms mounted on a piece of rock crystal, donated by the World Trade Centre of Rio de Janeiro, carved with an outline of five continents.\n\nThe motif on the Company tie derives from the Company's crest: it comprises the helm, torse and mantling surmounted by the wheel of St. Catherine upon which is a medieval merchant's cap.\n\nThe Company's motto is \"Commerce and honest friendship with all\", a quote from Thomas Jefferson's inaugural Presidential speech.\n\nMaster: Mr Michael Larsen[6]\n\nSenior Warden: Mr Lars B. Andersen\n\nJunior Warden: Mr Richard Burge\n\nClerk: Mrs Gaye Duffy\n\nThe Worshipful Company of World Traders is governed by its Master, Senior Warden, Junior Warden, and a Court of Assistants which elects the forthcoming Master and Wardens. The chief executive officer of the Company is known as the Clerk. The Master and Wardens serve the Company in their respective roles for a period of one year, after which time the Master becomes 'Immediate Past Master', the Senior Warden becomes the Master of the Company and the Junior Warden is promoted to the role of Senior Warden. A new Junior Warden is then elected by the Court of Assistants. Past Masters advise the incumbent Master and can resume as Master should the need arise. The appointment to the office of Clerk is not subject to annual election.\n\n2022-23: Mr Michael Shapiro\n\n2021-22: Mrs Mary Hardy\n\n2020-21: Ms Sue Algeo\n\n2019-20: Mr Peter Alvey\n\n2018–19: Dr Edwina Moreton\n\n2017–18: Alderman Professor Michael Mainelli\n\n2016–17: Mr Robert Woodthorpe Browne\n\n2015–16: Miss Wendy Hyde\n\n2014–15: Mr Mark Hardy\n\n2013–14: Dr Heather McLaughlin\n\n2012–13: Mr John Burbidge-King\n\n2011–12: Miss Mei Sim Lai\n\n2010–11: Mr Graham Bishop\n\n2009–10: Mr Michael Wren\n\n2008–09: The Baroness Garden of Frognal [7]\n\n2007–08: Mr Robert Alston\n\n2006–07: Mr Jack Wigglesworth\n\n2005–06: Mr William King\n\n2004–05: Mr Eric Stobart\n\n2003–04: Mr Eric Tracey\n\n2002–03: Mr John Stace\n\n2001–02: Mr Bryan Whalley\n\n2000–01: Miss Susan Hughes\n\n1999–2000: Sir Roger Cork\n\n1998–99: Mr Peter Wildblood\n\n1997–98: Porfessor David Watt\n\n1996–97: Mr Jim Davis\n\n1995–96: Mr Bryan Montgomery\n\n1994–95: The Venerable Peter Delaney\n\n1993–94: Mr George Capon\n\n1992–93: Mr Peter Drew\n\n1991–92: Patrick Pery, 6th Earl of Limerick\n\n1990–91: Mr Richard Charvet\n\n1989–90: Mr Peter Bowring\n\n1988–89: The Lord Bellwin of Leeds\n\n1987–88: Sir Peter Gadsden FREng[8]\n\n1985–87: Mr Peter Drew [9]"
