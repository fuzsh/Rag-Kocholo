        "text": "By Patrimony\n\nAn applicant born after his or her father or mother became Free of The Company may be admitted by Patrimony at the age of 25. Any applicant lawfully adopted by a Freeman of the Company, who was born after his or her adoptive father or mother was admitted to the Freedom of the Company, is also eligible for admission by Patrimony.\n\nThe cost of admission, which is not by right, is £360 (including VAT). Applicants must find two ‘Tests’ to attend the Freedom Ceremony to vouchsafe the applicant’s identity. All paperwork related to the application, which includes the production of various original certificates, must be received by four weeks prior to the date of the ceremony. A brief meeting with the Clerk will have been arranged following a candidate’s initial expression of interest.\n\nFreedom Ceremonies take place three times a year, and space is limited to six candidates per ceremony, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nBy Patrimonial Redemption\n\nAn applicant born before his or her father or mother was made Free of The Company, or whose grandparent was Free of The Company but whose parent was not, may apply to become Free by Patrimonial Redemption at the age of 25. This ultimately involves the approval of the Court. Each applicant must submit a completed application form with supporting documents for initial review by the Clerk.\n\nThe cost of admission, which is not by right, is £360 (including VAT). Applicants must find two ‘Tests’ to attend the Freedom Ceremony to vouchsafe the applicant’s identity. All paperwork related to the application, which includes the production of various original certificates, is subject to review by the Clerk and approval of the Court.

Membership by Redemption is not open to general applications from the public.\n\nThe cost of admission is £360 (including VAT).\n\nFreedom Ceremonies take place three times a year and space is limited to six candidates per ceremony, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis."
