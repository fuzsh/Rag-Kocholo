        "text": "Historical and Revision Notes\n\nBased on title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §§ 325, 332, and 333 (Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, §§ 219, 225, 226, 36 Stat. 1152, 1153; July 1, 1922, ch. 267, §§ 1, 2, 42 Stat. 816; May 29, 1926, ch. 425, § 1, 44 Stat. 677).\n\nThis section consolidates sections 332 and 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., with part of section 325 of such title.\n\nProvisions of section 325 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to appointment of clerk and marshal of the Supreme Court are incorporated in sections 671 and 672 of this title.\n\nThe provision as to tenure is new and is added to insure consistency with other revised sections relating to tenure of court officers.\n\nThe provisions of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., fixing the reporter’s salary at $8,000 per annum were omitted and the Court given authority to fix the salary in conformity with sections 671 and 672 of this title relating to the clerk and the marshal.\n\nProvisions of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for allowance of stationery, supplies, equipment, and office rent are omitted as obsolete. Offices are now provided in the Supreme Court building and supplies are furnished by the marshal.\n\nThe last sentence of section 333 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to the payment of the reporter’s expenses from appropriation for the Supreme Court, was omitted as surplusage.\n\nThe revised section makes specific the implied power to fix the compensation of the reporter’s assistants.\n\nThe provision in section 332 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., authorizing the Public Printer to do the printing referred to in such section, was omitted as unnecessary. (See section 111 of title 44, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Public Printing and Documents.)"
