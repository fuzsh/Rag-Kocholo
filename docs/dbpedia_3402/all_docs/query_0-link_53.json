        "text": "There are many good reasons why you should join the Carmen:\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Carmen is one of the largest Livery companies of the City of London.\n\nIt represents a wide range of aspects within the transport and logistics sector and continues to promote fellowship amongst those engaged in the industry, the military and to those from a wider range of disciplines and professions.\n\nAs with other livery companies, ours was founded on charity. Click on the Charity tab above to see how we help those less able than we are.\n\nThe Company’s renowned welcome and fellowship extends equally to all, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs or other factors, although Carmen retain their historic formal affiliation to the Christian faith.\n\nTo cement our relationship with the armed forces, membership of the Carmen is offered at special rates to serving military personnel from the level of Associate Freeman through to Liveryman.\n\nASSOCIATE FREEMAN\n\nThis category is aimed at individuals with a rank up to OF2/OR7 & OF3, thus specific to individuals during the early stages of their career. No Fines (i.e. Joining Fees) are payable. Associate Freeman grade is offered to both civilian and HM Forces personnel – see table in fees page for details of the applicable criteria and subscription rates.\n\nFREEMAN\n\nSuccessful applicants to become a Freeman of The Worshipful Company of Carmen will be invited to attend a capping ceremony (normally in person, or by Zoom if unable to attend in person). Here you will meet the Master to be formally accepted as a Freeman of The Worshipful Company of Carmen. Freemen may then apply to attend events open to them and enjoy the fellowship, support and networking this enables, whilst offering their own skills and talents for the benefit of others.\n\nIf desired, progression from here would be to Liveryman, subject to first obtaining the Freedom of The City of London (the Clerk will assist you with this). For more information click here.\n\nLIVERYMAN\n\nApplicants for Liveryman status, will already be Freemen of the Company, having attended a capping ceremony and having received their Freedom of the City of London. Members in this category will be invited to participate in the joining and welcoming ceremony, which takes place during a Court meeting.\n\nAt this ceremony, new members are welcomed and formally presented to the Master, the Wardens and the Court of Assistants. New members are then invited to make their pledge to The King, to The Worshipful Company of Carmen and to the City of London and then to be clothed in the Livery (a gown with a ribbon which signifies the formal joining). They will also receive their warrants of membership.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the Court will join new members and their guests for refreshments. Many new members then continue their celebrations by attending the luncheon or dinner which follows, often in a unique setting.\n\nLiverymen can apply to serve on the Company’s panels and committees where they may add expertise or which are of particular interest to them. In the first instance they should apply through the Clerk.\n\nLiverymen are eligible and encouraged to vote for the Sheriffs and the Lord Mayor as part of their civic duty.\n\nEligibility for election to the Court of Assistants comes after three years as a Liveryman; votes being cast democratically by fellow Freemen and Liverymen.\n\nLiverymen and Freemen of the Company experience lifelong fellowship, are generous in charitable giving, and participate enthusiastically in the life of the Livery, they welcome the opportunity to serve the City of London Corporation and the wider community and enjoy the privilege of association with those who serve King and country.\n\nEach grade of membership offers different entitlements. A separate page with details will open if you click here.\n\nApplication Process\n\nTo join the Company:\n\nA candidate can apply directly to the Company having completed the online application form (click here)\n\nA sponsor (i.e. current Liveryman or Freeman) can apply on behalf of the candidate.\n\nIn either case the applicant needs to complete the online application form (click here) or complete a proforma which are available at certain events.\n\nThe application form must be signed by two sponsors (or one proposer for Associate Freeman). In the event that the candidate does not know a sponsor, they should contact the Clerk to discuss the way ahead.\n\nDo not provide more information than that requested on the application form.\n\nOn submitting the application form, the candidate will be contacted by the Clerk or a member of the Membership Committee.\n\nThe application form will be acknowledged and the applicant, and possibly the sponsor, will be invited to attend an informal meeting, either in person or remotely, with the Membership Committee. The meeting is conducted in a relaxed atmosphere and will cover knowledge of the Company and the City of London, reasons for wanting to join, how the candidate views their personal involvement with the Company, any charity or voluntary work with which the candidate is involved. The Committee will be able to answer any queries that the candidate might have.\n\nFamily of existing Carmen members do not normally need to be interviewed; however, a one page CV is requested along with the application form to give the Membership Committee some information about the applicant.\n\nSubject to the satisfactory recommendation by the Membership Committee, the Clerk will write to the candidate inviting them to attend Carmen’s Hall to receive the Company Freedom at a mutually convenient date and time. This ceremony takes about 20 minutes and involves the reading of a declaration and payment of the Freedom (Joining) fee where applicable – see table on the Fees tab alongside. Successful candidates will be invited to make voluntary donations to the Carmen Benevolent Trust and the Carmen Heritage Trust.\n\nWhere it is impractical to attend in person, the ceremony can be conducted remotely – such an example would be for HM Forces personnel where military commitments dictate their availability.\n\nOn completion of the ceremony, candidates become members of the Company.\n\nAlternatively, contact the Clerk to discuss your route to membership: Call: 020 7645 1405 or email: clerk@thecarmen.co.uk\n\nMembership Fees\n\nThis section shows the costs relating to becoming a Carman. Becoming part of over 500 years of history and helping others in the transport industry doesn’t have to be that expensive; several options are available.\n\nSome old English is used – after all we are an old company!\n\n• When we say ‘Quarterage’ in the modern day this means the annual membership fee.\n\n• When we say ‘Fine’ we mean a one-off charge.\n\n• Additionally some discounts are available.\n\nAssociate Freeman Annual Quarterage (annual fee)\n\nAvailable to Quarterage Fee * Special Quarterage\n\nFee for Past Award Winners NATO Ranks OF0 – OR0 £24.00 Not appplicable NATO Ranks OF1 / OR1-6 £36.00 £27.00 NATO Ranks OF2 / OR7-9 £72.00 £54.00 NATO Rank OF3 £120.00 £90.00 NATO Ranks OF4+ Full Freeman fee\n\n* payable annually or monthly\n\nFreeman Fines and Annual Quarterage\n\nCategory Fine Special Rate for Past Award Winners Annual Quarterage Special Rate for Past Award Winners NATO Ranks OF1-3 / OR1-9 £154.00 £115.50 £143.00 £107.25 NATO Ranks OF4+ £230.00 £172.50 £165.00 £123.75\n\nLiveryman Fines and Annual Quarterage\n\nCategory Fine Special Rate for Past Award Winners Annual Quarterage Special Rate for Past Award Winners NATO Ranks OF3 / OR1-9 £248.00 £186.00 £248.00 £186.00 NATO Ranks OF4+ £372.00 £279.00 £372.00 £279.00\n\nNotes:\n\nAs with all London Livery Companies, the Fine is, in effect, the joining charge, whilst the annual charges are termed ‘Quarterage’. Please note that we do not impose a Fine (i.e. Joining Fee) for the spouse/partner of existing members. For those upgrading from Freeman to Liveryman within the first 12 months of being capped as a Freeman, the Fine paid as a Freeman is deducted – Contact the Clerk for details.\n\nThose that have previously held Honorary status by virtue of appointment held, do not pay the Fine when applying for full status.\n\nAll Fines can be payable over a 2-year period. Contact the Clerk for details on 020 7645 1405 or email: clerk@thecarmen.co.uk\n\nFees last updated on 1 January 2024."
