Recognised as a Company 'incorporated by prescription', the earliest surviving written reference to this old and Worshipful Company occurs in the records of the City of London in the reign of King Richard II in 1387. The Company is 59th in the order of precedence.\n\nOriginally formed to safeguard the quality of shipbuilding in London, today, the Shipwrights’ Company provides support to organisations, charities, educational institutions and individuals associated with the Company’s role as a City of London Livery Company and its origins and trade.\n\nThe Company is based at Ironmongers' Hall in Shaftesbury Place in the Barbican.\n\nThe original purpose of the Company 700 years ago was to safeguard the quality of shipbuilding in London. This continues today via the provision of support to marine apprenticeships, boat building courses and naval and marine engineering students at university plus the presentation of annual awards of excellence. The Shipwrights' Company has a strong philanthropic purpose and donates annually to maritime related causes, individuals, charities and companies.\n\nLiverymen vote in the annual elections of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs and all members of the Company enjoy a full programme of activities including sports, visits, formal dinners, social events and informal gatherings.\n\nWe hope that you will find the website interesting and informative and enjoying learning more about the Shipwrights' Company."
