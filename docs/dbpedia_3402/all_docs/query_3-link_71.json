        "text": "The Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is a Livery Company of the City of London, whose members are drawn from the membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW).\n\nThe Chartered Accountants’ Company is one of almost 120 Livery Companies and Guilds in the City of London. Some of the Livery Companies have medieval roots, whilst others such as the Chartered Accountants’ Company, founded in 1977, represent the modern trades and professions of the City of London.\n\nCollectively, the Livery Companies have a key role in the governance of the City of London, support the promotion of the City of London and the wider United Kingdom as a place of business, and have a significant philanthropic role.\n\nThe Chartered Accountants Company promotes the ethical and professional standards, competencies, and talents which our profession represents.\n\nMembers have developed their careers in many sectors including holding leading roles in professional firms, roles in industry, commerce and financial services, governance roles, and academia.\n\nTogether, the members share a commitment to the accountant working in the public interest and contributing to society.\n\nAs a Livery Company representing the “modern City” the Company works closely with other modern Livery Companies and is an active member of the Financial Services Group of Companies.\n\nAny member of the ICAEW is well to apply for membership of the Company. The membership is a fraternity of professionals who share their support for the City of London and their profession. Members share professional and business experiences outside of their daily roles.\n\nMembers periodically gather for formal dinners in City of London Livery Halls, City of London formal and civic events, and participate in an eclectic range of social events. Important roles of the Livery and its members are supporting Charity and affiliated organisations, including military units.\n\nOur motto is True and Fair and our Members are leading accountants and business people from industry, commerce, the financial sectors including professional firms of accountants.\n\nJoining the Company is a privilege which allows Institute members to meet and socialise with other chartered accountants outside their own business and normal contacts, enabling us all to be better informed about key professional and business issues.\n\nThe Company is a member of the Financial Services Group of Livery Companies, which enhances this benefit.\n\nSocially, the Company’s year opens with our Installation Church Service and Dinner in October, when the Master-Elect taking office.\n\nTwo more major Dinners follow shortly after Christmas and in April, either at Chartered Accountants’ Hall or at other Livery Halls around the City. In July, the Lord Mayor usually invites us to hold our Annual Banquet at Mansion House, which is always a great occasion."
