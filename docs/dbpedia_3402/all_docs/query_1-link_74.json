        "text": "About the Appeal\n\n2022 is a very special and significant milestone in the long and distinguished history of the Distillers. It marks the 350th anniversary of our Worshipful Company being granted Livery status by the Court of Aldermen in 1672. From that point onwards, we took our place alongside the other Livery Companies of the day, could vote, take part in civic ceremonies and support the work of the Corporation of London and the Lord Mayor. It also meant that we would become a focal point for the spirits industry.\n\n350 years later, this essence is more alive and well than ever, delivering our charitable goals and helping the Livery play an ever more important role in the community.\n\nThe Worshipful Company purpose is to be at the heart of the Spirits industry and through our charitable giving to improve young people’s lives. The Distillers’ Charity is providing vital support to key Livery & City charity partners, as well as funding Vocational Training & Education for the next generation of distillers and developing the new Youth Action Fund in Scotland. Our principal Livery & City charities supported include;\n\nThe Drinks Trust, who offer care and support to the people who form the industry workforce, both past and present. The Trust provides individuals with services across vocational, well-being, financial and practical support.\n\nThe Alcohol Education Trust, are a leading early intervention charity that supports young people aged 11 – 25 to keep safe around alcohol. AET work is delivered through schools and youth organisations who are supported free of charge with award-winning resources and training.\n\nThe Lord Mayor’s A Better City Appeal for Future Zone in Barking & Dagenham. Future is London’s first OnSide Youth Zone, which enables young people to raise their aspirations and confidence creating a happier and healthier next generation.\n\nOur Livery is increasingly young and dynamic, representing the vibrancy of the distilling industry in the 21st century. Every member has the opportunity to engage in the The Master’s 350th Anniversary Appeal through their donations, volunteering and fundraising. To shine a light of all these activities, and to mark the granting of our Livery status in 1672, in the next 12 months I will be visiting 12 distilleries in England and Scotland to promote the amazing work that the Livery and its teams are doing up and to help raise funds for our charities.\n\nYou too can take part in this historic moment by getting involved in our charitable work.\n\nThank you for your support to our 350th Anniversary Appeal. Together we can make a difference so more young people can thrive and have a better future.\n\nChris Porter\n\nMaster\n\n2021-2022\n\nHelp Us Reach Our Goal"
