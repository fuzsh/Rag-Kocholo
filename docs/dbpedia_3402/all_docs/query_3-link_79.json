        "text": "The Cordwainers are proud to play their part in the City livery movement.\n\nToday there are more than 47,000 livery members in 110 livery companies. The Cordwainers are number 27 in the order of precedence.\n\nOriginally founded to regulate specific trades and crafts within the City, most livery companies now have strong charitable traditions, often connected to their original trades. According to a recent survey by the Pan-Livery Committee, the livery movement is one of the top six grant givers in the UK, with annual aggregate giving of Â£72 million."
