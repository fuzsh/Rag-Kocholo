Some Livery Companies can trace their origins back to the 12th century. They were originally founded to protect the interests of various trades and their practitioners - to guarantee that a member was trustworthy and fully qualified, and that the goods they produced were of reputable quality. The aim being to protect the public and to protect members from unscrupulous activites. They were given their authority by being granted a Royal charter.\n\nEach Company had its own coat of arms which can be seen here:\n\nThe Trades-Mens Armes\n\nThe Public Book of Arms\n\nThe word 'livery' refers to the distinctive clothing and regalia worn by members to distinguish them from those in other companies. This is how they became known as livery companies. Each Livery Company has its own colours and its own coat of arms. Each company had it own hall where its members could gather for business and social meetings. Some of these halls, including records, were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Some halls are still standing today and actively in use.\n\nTo work in a particular trade in the City of London, you first had to work as an apprentice learning your trade. You would be bound by indenture to a master, usually for many years, with an accompanying fee to be paid to the master, often by the apprentice's father or another sponsor. Eventually the apprentice would become a freeman (an apprentice who has been granted freedom of the company). Becoming a freeman was important as once awarded the status it meant the individual could carry on business and prosper in trade with in the Square Mile [expand on Square Mile, when it changed and what it meant].\n\nA person who is a Freeman of both the City and a Livery Company is referred to as \"Citizen and [Livery Company name] of London\".[1]\n\nThe various stages of the guild are; apprentice, freeman, liveryman, Master, Warden, Assistant and Clerk. There was also a Company's Court (board of governors). [expand on roles].\n\nThere are over 100 Livery Companies in the City of London now and today they mainly act as charitable patrons and keepers of their history. The livery companies have always been benevolent giving help to members of the Company or their dependents who might fall on hard times.\n\nThe Great 12\n\nThe \"senior\" Companies are known as the Great 12 and they have an Order of Precedence. They were given their Order of Precedence by the Lord Mayor 1516 [check]. At the time there were many more companies but only the 12 most powerful and influential companies were identified to be ordered. To be Lord Mayor, one had to be a member of one of the Great 12, or if elected Lord Mayor, leave their Company and join one of the top 12 - such was the importance of this 12.\n\nWorshipful Company of Mercers (general merchants)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Mercers\n\nhttps://www.mercers.co.uk/our-history/700-year-timeline\n\nWorshipful Company of Grocers (spice merchants)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Grocers\n\nhttps://grocershall.co.uk/the-company/\n\nWorshipful Company of Drapers (wool and cloth merchants)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Drapers\n\nhttps://thedrapers.co.uk/heritage/ The Drapers Co\n\nWorshipful Company of Fishmongers (sellers of fish and seafood)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Fishmongers\n\nhttps://fishmongers.org.uk/our-history/\n\nWorshipful Company of Goldsmiths (bullion dealers)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Goldsmiths\n\nhttps://www.thegoldsmiths.co.uk/company/history/history-of-the-company/\n\nWorshipful Company of Skinners [The Skinners' and Merchant Taylors' Companies alternate their precedence each year.] (fur traders)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Skinners\n\nhttps://www.merchant-taylors.co.uk/about/company-history\n\nWorshipful Company of Merchant Taylors [The Skinners' and Merchant Taylors' Companies alternate their precedence each year.] (tailors)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Merchant_Taylors\n\nhttps://www.skinners.org.uk/roots-and-branches/our-history/\n\nWorshipful Company of Haberdashers (clothiers in sewn and fine materials, eg. silk and velvet)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Haberdashers\n\nhttps://haberdashers.co.uk/company-history\n\nWorshipful Company of Salters (traders of salts and chemicals)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Salters\n\nhttps://salters.co.uk/company-history/\n\nWorshipful Company of Ironmongers\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Ironmongers\n\nhttps://www.ironmongers.org/about-us\n\nWorshipful Company of Vintners (wine merchants)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Vintners\n\nhttps://www.vintnershall.co.uk/introduction-origins\n\nWorshipful Company of Clothworkers\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Clothworkers\n\nhttps://www.clothworkers.co.uk/history/history/\n\nFull List of the Companies\n\nFull lists of the Companies can be found here:\n\nThe Livery Committee, City of London Corporation\n\nLivery Companies Livery Companies (Wikipedia)\n\nGuilds and Companies outside of the Great 12\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Feltmakers\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Masons\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers alias Wire Workers\n\nFinding a member\n\nVarious online geneaology sites have apprentice records which are worth searching.\n\nFor example FamilySearch.\n\nThe Records of London's Livery Companies Online (ROLLCO) is a site which provides records of Apprentices and Freemen in the City of London Livery Companies between 1400 and 1900.\n\nhttps://www.londonroll.org (London only)\n\nMost of the Companies have an extensive archive and if you contact their archivist, they can provide valuable information about individuals who were once members.
