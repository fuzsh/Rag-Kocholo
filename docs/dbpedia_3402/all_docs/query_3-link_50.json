        "text": "The Livery Companies are 108 trade associations in the City of London, almost all of which are known as the \"Worshipful Company of\" the relevant trade, craft or profession. The medieval Companies originally developed as guilds and were responsible for the regulation of their trades, controlling, for instance, wages and labour conditions. Until the Protestant Reformation, they were closely associated with religious activities, notably in support of chantry chapels and churches and the observance of ceremonies, notably the mystery plays.\n\nSome livery companies continue to have a professional role today (for example, the Scriveners' Company admits senior members to that profession, the Apothecaries' Company awards post-graduate qualifications in some medical specialties, and the Hackney Carriage Drivers' Company is composed of those who have learned 'the knowledge' and are licensed London taxicab drivers). Other Livery Companies have become purely charitable foundations (such as the Longbow Makers' Company). Most Companies, particularly those formed in more recent times, are primarily social and charitable organisations. The active Companies play an important part in social life and networking in the City and have a long history of cultural patronage, and control of the City of London Corporation (which still functions as a local authority with extensive local government powers).\n\nMore information on the Wikipedia page [1]\n\nSee also the individual companies."
