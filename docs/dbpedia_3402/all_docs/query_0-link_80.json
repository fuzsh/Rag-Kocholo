        "text": "How did company regulation of crafts and trades work in early-modern London? This issue has long been at the heart of debates on guilds and companies across Europe. The ability of companies to regulate and discipline their members and restrict who practised their trade is central to interpretations of their economic and social impact, while their failure - or not - to do so is an important part of discussions of their 'decline'. In this chapter, I examine guild regulation in detail in the Society of Apothecaries and the Stationers Company of London. I argue that to understand the manner in which companies executed their duties we need to locate them in a wider context of contemporary approaches to law and order. In companies’ minutes of search and punishment as much as in the records of the Quarter Sessions we can discern the marks of a culture in which, as Robert Shoemaker has suggested, the punishment of misdemeanours operated in 'instrumental terms', aiming not at punitive or arbitrary justice but at regulating and defining appropriate behaviour and securing compensation. Companies' actions are best understood as attempts to reform present and future behaviour and to reintegrate offenders, all of which relied on a broad range of interventions and sanctions; final judgements and heavy punishments were pursued only when the dialogue between offender and court broke down. This allowed more flexible and diverse forms of economic behaviour (and misbehaviour) than the ordinances might suggest. In part this was a pragmatic retreat in the face of both the commercial realities of early-modern London and the political uncertainties that frequently surrounded company authority. But it also reflected the ongoing importance within corporate life of an idiom of fraternity marked by compassion, confession and forgiveness, and the importance of the longer term prospects and attitudes of freemen for companies engaged in charitable relief and dependent on fees, quarterage and gifts for their funds. Interpretations which judge company regulation as either strong or weak are therefore somewhat misleading, and ignore the subtleties of contemporary approaches to policing behaviour - be it in the marketplace, workshop or elsewhere. This is not to suggest that companies' internal efforts to control their members' behaviour could not still fail. Negotiation and accommodation were only tenable strategies as part of an ongoing process of regulation, and when this broke down the limits of companies’ powers could be exposed. How companies dealt with their weakness in the face of resistance raises the question of their relationships with other authorities in the city and country, and the implications this had for their regulatory autonomy and internal coherence.
