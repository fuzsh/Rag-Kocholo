        "text": "Livery Companies of the City of London in the 18th Century\n\nLondon Livery Companies grew out of earlier trade associations and guilds. Liveries (costumes, symbols and so forth) are granted by the Court of Aldermen of the City of London. Their history can be complicated with various associations merging and splitting at different times. For example, Barbers and Surgeons were a single entity in the early 14th century. In 1368, the Surgeons formed their own guild but merged with the Barbers to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons in 1540. In 1745, the Surgeons broke away to form their own Company which, in 1800, became the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nThe Companies acted as regulators and inspectors for their constituencies, enforced apprenticeships and training, and lobbied the Crown fo special treatment. The Fanmakers Company, for example, fought a running battle throughout the 18th century against cheap fans printed in Canton in China and shipped to England in bulk by the East India Company. Fanmakers survived the latter half of the century while the fan was a must-have fashion item but thereafter declined rapidly.\n\nThere are currently 108 Livery Companies in the City of London but, of these, only 77 existed in the 18th Century - counting the Worshipful Company of Fanmakers who were incorporated in 1709. However, as the Barber-Surgeon example above shows, there were other Companies during that period. The granting of Liveries died out as a practice and it was not until the 20th Century that new Livery companies were again being created. Company names all begin with \"The Worshipful Company of\".\n\nThe passage of the 18th century saw the majority of these Companies losing their initial purpose as technology overtook craft and products that were once made by individuals were made by machines. This had already happened to older technologies such as the Bowyers and Fletchers Companies, overtaken by the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers. Most Livery Companies are now social and charitable organisations.\n\nRecent Livery Companies\n\nPurely for my own amusement, I note the following late additions:\n\nDear to my own heart is the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists in 1992 - ranked 100.\n\nThe Worshipful Company of Hackney Carriage Drivers did not become a Livery Company until 2004 and is ranked 104. The process apparently started in 1654 with instructions from Oliver Cromwell on the regulation of drivers but, given the speed of the average London cab, it clearly took a while to arrive.\n\nMoving into the realm of the ridiculous we have the Worshipful Company of Management Consultants in 2004 - ranked 105.\n\nFinally, bringing up the tail of the procession we have the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals - ranked 108.\n\nSignificant 18th Century Dates\n\nDate Event 1700 Company of Watermen and Lightermen formed by an Act of Parliament 1709 Copyright Act of 1709 takes copyright control away from Printers and Stationers Company 1713 Livery granted to the Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters 1745 Surgeons split from the Company of Barber-Surgeons to form the Company of Surgeons 1746 Woodmongers' Company becomes defunct. 1746 Worshipful Company of Carmen receives a Royal Charter and takes over the regulation of Carmne (Carters) from the Woodmongers' Company. 1763 Livery is granted to the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights 1782 Livery is granted to the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights 1792 Livery is granted to the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards 1800 Company of Surgeons becomes the Royal College of Surgeons\n\nList of Livery Companies in the 18th Century\n\nNote that the dates below represent the date at which the Company was Incorporated (typically by Royal Charter), at which point it formally takes on its regulatory and other functions. Livery may not have been granted until much later at the whim of the Court of Aldermen. Trade associations usually existed well before incorporation - sometimes sufficiently far back that the exact origins are unknown.\n\nClick on the Company name to go to the Company's website; click on more info to go to the relevant Wikipedia entry. The latter is a useful resource but, as always, use with caution. Companies are listed in order of precedence."
