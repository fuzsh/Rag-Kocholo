American folk singer Tracy Grammer, known for her work as half of the folk duo Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer as well as her solo career, will perform on Friday, March 11, at Unity Centre For the Performing Arts in Unity. Raised in southern California, Grammer comes from a musical family. A cousin, Leo Fortin, played double trumpets in Lawrence Welk’s band; her grandmothers and mother played keyboards and accordion; and her father’s guitar playing was one of her biggest inspirations.
