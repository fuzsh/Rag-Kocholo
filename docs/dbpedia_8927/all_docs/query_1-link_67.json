        "text": "It’s been 10 years since singer-songwriter Tracy Grammer tragically lost her musical partner Dave Carter in an untimely death at the age of 42. A highly regarded folk duo praised for poetic songwriting and rich harmonies, Carter and Grammer released three critically acclaimed albums: ‘When I Go’ (1998), ‘Tanglewood Tree’ (2000) and ‘Drum Hat Buddha'(2001), in their truncated career.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to pay homage to Carter while solidifying her place as a successful solo artist, Grammer is currently on tour in support of this year’s release ‘Little Blue Eggs.’ The album features 11 Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer demos and outtakes recorded at the duo’s home studios between 1997-2002.\n\n‘I’ve had this feeling that a decade after Dave’s passing would be a threshold moment for me after which I would do something a little bit differently,’ says Grammer. ‘What has happened this year is that I find myself telling the stories of who we were as an artistic duo and some of the funny things that happened to us along the way. What it was like to meet Dave Carter and what it was like to lose Dave Carter. I’m telling those stories in the show. I’m doing these miniature monologues and interspersing them with the songs that go with the stories. People will be moved. I’m having fun giving it. It’s going to be a great big love fest. I think we’re going to have a lot of fun.’\n\nIn 2005, Carter’s sister, Elisa Fischer, handed the creative torch to Grammer. This allowed Grammer to retain creative control and secure the integrity of Carter’s, and the duo’s, music catalog. ‘It’s an interesting thing to live within the position I find myself, which is keeper of the legacy and the singer of his songs,’ says Grammer. ‘It brings me great joy, because I think the songs are brilliant and I feel so happy that I have this great quality material to sing. It messes with my heart a little bit though.’\n\nToday, Grammer continues performing while releasing a variety of solo albums, including ‘The Verdant Mile’ (2004), whose title track pays homage to the late Carter. ‘Flowers of Avalon’ (2005) predominantly features Carter compositions. Grammy Award-winning artist Mary Chapin Carpenter and Grammer’s touring partner Jim Henry provided the backing vocals for the album. ‘Book of Sparrows,’ an EP released in 2007, contains interpretations of songs by David Carter, Paul Simon, Kate Power, Tom Russell and David Francey. Grammer released ‘Seven is the Number’ (2006), the duo’s final recording, four years after Carter’s passing.\n\nIn June 2011 Grammer unexpectedly got to do a two-week tour of Japan. ‘I was invited over by some really hardcore Americana fans in the Hiroshima area,’ says Grammer. ‘They hooked me up with a wonderful mandolin player and a beautiful backing singer. We would cram ourselves into these tiny Japanese bars at the ends of alleys. People would sing along with some of the songs, which was amazing. That was one of the highlights of my life, that Japan trip. It was such a great experience. I came back feeling so rich after that. I’m still high from it.’\n\n‘It’s great to see what’s possible in the world and meet all kinds of people,’ says Grammer. ‘Music has been so great for me that way. I didn’t know I was going to love the traveling so much. I love to drive. I love to sit in silence and just watch the landscape go by. I love to show up at the show, do my thing and meet the people who love the music. What’s better than that?’\n\nTracy Grammer and Gretchen Schultz perform at Steel City Coffee House, 203 Bridge Street, Phoenixville, Dec. 14 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $12 advance and $15 day of show and can be purchased by calling 610-933-4043, or online at www.steelcitycoffeehouse.com."
