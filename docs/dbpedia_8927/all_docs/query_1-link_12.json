        "text": "Latest News\n\nJuly 2024: I am deep in rehearsals for The Mill Project , a play that remembers and embodies women's experiences of work and resistance in the textile mills of 19th-century New England. Woven into a tapestry of primary source text, original music and movement, the play stages the mill operatives' lived experiences and the rhetoric of womanhood, independence, enslavement, and abolition that surrounded them. This is the first production where I get to do it all -- act, sing a cappella, and play my violin. A dream! Directed by Brianna Sloane. Design by Elizabeth Pangburn. Cast: Tahmie Der, Emma Friend, myself, Jess Rawling, and Christine Stevens. The show runs August 1-11 and is sponsored by Historic Northampton.\n\nMarch 2024: Delighted to announce that I've been cast as Bari in WAM Theater Company's Fresh Takes reading series production of \"Be Here Now\" by Deborah Zoe Laufer, dir. Kelly Galvin. Performances at 2pm and 7pm on March 10 -- one day only! Click the graphic for info.\n\nI've also been cast as Miss Preen in Easthampton Theater Company's production of \"The Man Who Came To Dinner,\" which plays June 20-23.\n\nJanuary 2024: In the fall I was accepted to participate in a month-long acting intensive at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass. From January 2-30, I'll be hunkered down in the snowy Berkshires learning about voice and breath work, combat, clown, text analysis, actor/audience relationship, and scene work. I am thrilled to have the time and resources to immerse myself in something I love so much, and which has brought me tremendous healing and community. Learn more at shakespeare.org.\n\nAugust 2023: I am focused this month on an archival transfer of interviews, live shows, demos, and more dating back to the start of the Dave & Tracy era in 1996 or so -- and it's an absolute treasure trove of early versions, interesting back stories, and earnest performances. If you'd like to support this effort and my work generally, consider joining my Patreon subscription site where each month, I share at least one exclusive nugget from the archives, my memoir, my studio, or my tours. It's a wonderful way to keep in touch with those who are literally and figuratively most invested and supportive of my work as an artist.\n\nPRESS FOR LAST REQUEST: The Daily Hampshire Gazette published a wonderful feature about Peter Nelson's new one-woman production, \"Last Request: A Love Story\" which stars Tracy Grammer and runs three nights in three different venues around western Massachusetts. Please refer to the calendar for dates and links. All shows are free thanks to generous funding from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. Read the article here.\n\nIf it seems that things have been a bit quiet on the music front, that's because I have been busy on the boards. In October 2022 I had the great good fortune to play Bessie in Westfield Theatre Group's production of \"Marvin's Room,\" a dramatic comedy about caregiving, estrangement, mental illness, and how a fractured family bonds in the face of tremendous challenges. We had a five-show run, all well-attended, though I only saw a few folk fans there. Fellow troubadour Eric Lee says you see the same sort of delineation between folk and bluegrass, so ... to each their own, I suppose! It's fun to be trying my wings either way, and telling stories via different instruments, and meeting a whole new audience.\n\nTheater fun continues Nov 10-19 when I play Eurydice in Greenfield Community College's production of \"Antigone,\" directed by Tom Geha. Then I get to debut brand new work by Peter Nelson in December as Katie Fitzgerald in his one-woman musical monologue called \"Last Request.\" LR shows in three different venus around the Pioneer Valley. Details on the shows page.\n\nTickets are now on sale for our second all-Dave Carter show of the year. This show continues the 20th anniversary celebration of Dave's work following his death in 2002. If you can't make the livestream, the show will be available for 72 hours post-broadcast to ticketholders, or for 7 full days for members of the Patreon community. Additionally for Patrons, there will be a post-show Zoom Q&A.\n\nBACK IN THE BOOKING SADDLE\n\nThere's a host of reasons I'm one of the slower artists to begin booking in-person concerts following the pandemic pause -- crises of direction, a new cat with abandonment issues, local acting opportunities, and more -- but I'm back at it now and have begun booking for fall 2022 and beyond. I have a southern Michigan one-off in July, a Pacific Northwest weekend in the works for September, and am reaching out to venues to reschedule the national LOW TIDE tour I postponed in 2019 due to a severe knee injury. Stay tuned for updates! And if you're a venue or house concert host ... offers and leads are welcome anytime via my booking page. Thank you!\n\nSEVEN IS THE NUMBER is back in stock! Get it, and all our other music here.\n\nBACK TO THE THEATER ... AT LAST!\n\nFollowing up my theater dream debut as Barbara Apple in Richard Nelson's \"Sorry,\" I will play the role of Mrs. Kendal in Greenfield Community College Theater's production of \"The Elephant Man.\" The show will run the first two weekends in May at Hawks & Reed Performing Arts Center in Greenfield, Mass.\n\nBLUELINER PRE-RELEASES THIRD SINGLE 2/4/22\n\nMy pandemic band with Jim Henry, Paul Kochanski, and Lorne Entress is proud to offer a cover of Neil Young's \"Heart of Gold\" for pre-release via Bandcamp starting February 4. The iTunes/Spotify/digital world official release date is February 14.\n\nAs with our other two recordings, we tracked our parts separately in our home studios and sent them to Lorne for mixing and mastering at his Harmony St. studio. But this time, we did the video a little differently -- we got together, in person (!), at Jim Henry's Rubytone Studio and filmed it one November afternoon. First time we'd seen one another in almost two years -- thanks, science! Check out our new video here.\n\nOn the first Friday of the month, Bandcamp waives its 15% revenue share on all sales, so artists pocket a little more of that dollar than usual. Furthermore, Bandcamp allows fans to set their own price for a track. We set the price at a dollar, but find most folks pay $3 - $5. Every little bit helps keep the virtual bus rolling!\n\nWe are grateful for the support of fans and friends as we continue to find innovative ways to create and share music.\n\nNEW PATREON COMMUNITY - YOU'RE INVITED!\n\nOn November 24, I launched a Patreon subscription site to create sustainable monthly income around my work. Inspired by fellow Patreon artists but squeamish about actively soliciting this kind of support for myself, I hesitated for over two years before opening the community. Eventually, pandemic tour shutdown and the pileup of long-neglected projects forced me to evaluate my resources and obstacles, but there was something else, too. The prospect of bypassing social media algorithms to share my work and works-in-progress directly and reliably with my devotees thrills me. So the site is up, the doors are open, and we are building a thing! Check it out here, and join me!\n\nNEW RealWomenRealSongs Dedicated PAGE\n\nI created a new page dedicated to collecting all the videos of my new demos in one place. If you prefer, you can also watch the YouTube playlist here. Let me know which ones move you most!\n\nREMEMBERING MISS KITTY My beloved touring partner, teddy bear, little spoon, playmate, confidante, teacher, dance partner, and best friend left this earth on December 14 at 18.5 years old. I adopted her from Dakin Humane Society in 2006 when she was four years old, never suspecting what a clarifying force she would be in my life, not even realizing that the level of love and bonding we found was possible. My grief is great -- two weeks out I'm still ugly-crying whenever I talk about our adventures -- but my gratitude is greater. I look forward to the time when I can take everything she taught me and offer it to another in need. There are always others who need us.\n\nMany of you have followed our escapades on Instagram and Facebook and some have asked how they can honor her life and the lives of shelter animals in general. I suggest making a contribution to Dakin on Miss Kitty's behalf, either with a purchase from their Amazon Wish List or through a donation. And once again, thank you for loving her and for bearing witness to our incredible journey.\n\nSECOND SINGLE FROM TRACY'S 1970S SIDE PROJECT, BLUELINER\n\nJim Henry, Lorne Entress, Paul Kochanski and TG formed a little project called BLUELINER and released their first single, \"(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden\" June 19. Their follow-up recording of Carole King's \"Sweet Seasons\" was released September 24 and is nothing short of joyful -- the perfect antidote for what ails you. Check out our happy video below, and then visit the band's Bandcamp page for downloads, or to gift this track to a friend. We hope the music brings you as much joy as it brought us!\n\nNEW TOWNES VAN ZANDT COVER AVAILABLE AUG. 14\n\nTracy pays tribute to one of her all-time favorite songwriters with a lovingly-crafted cover of \"I'll Be Here in the Morning.\" \"I recorded this at the beginning of the shut-down,\" says Grammer. \"There was something about this chorus that struck me as particularly heartbreaking. All those reports of Covid-19 patients on ventilators, passing away without friends or family near. That loneliness; that impossible separation. I sang this one as if music and love and wishing could somehow bridge them.\"\n\nTracy recorded her guitar and vocals in The Blue Room (her home studio), with Jim Henry adding electric guitar in his studio across the valley. The song was mixed by Bob Stark in Oregon and mastered by David Glasser in Colorado.\n\nNEW SINGLE FROM TRACY'S 1970S SIDE PROJECT, BLUELINER\n\nJim Henry, Lorne Entress, Paul Kochanski and TG formed a little project called BLUELINER and released their first single, \"(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden\" June 19. This follows the video of the song they released in April, which has received more than 10k views on Facebook. Download \"Rose Garden\" at the band's Bandcamp page, and drop us a note to let us know what you think? More to come soon ... stay tuned.\n\nNEW SINGLE RELEASES 2.21.20 on iTunes, Spotify, Bandcamp, more"
