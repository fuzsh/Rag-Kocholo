you're keepin hey tonya the hour is overdue for the hunter's moon in you to come out and shine hey tonya i would not take you to task for the wolf behind the mask she's a friend of mine and anytime they surround you with their silver-bullet tongues and you can't find a way to face 'em and there's no place to run and the queen of hearts holed up in london tower come thunderin down and big ben chimes the midnight hour hey tonya if you called me i would come we would make the peasants run we'd light up the sky hey tonya they got nothin left to steal and if they chained you to wheel you would pine and die so would i now the winner's circle makes the rules in court we get our spin on the wheel of fortune but we always come up short so we play the game as long as we are able but heaven's for the blessed, and the rest is just a young girl's fable hey tonya i got nothin up my smile and i been a good long while up against this wall hey tonya fame is only for a day and we all have feet of clay and even angels fall after all\n\n6.\n\nTexas Underground 03:51\n\none sunday morning i was sleepin on the sofa, had me a crazy dream i met the devil in broad daylight, just outta abilene he took me down a hole where the lost souls go, looked around and what did i see but millionaires and prickly pears, this is what he said to me: welcome to texas underground we got a barbeque all year 'round smokin little band with a country sound we like to have a little fun so pull up a chair, you can chew on the fat gets a might dry, but we like it like that dance with the lady in the stetson hat welcome to texas, son he took me over to hell's rodeo hoppin in his hobnail boots 109 cow punchers in a line, widowmakers waitin in the chutes the rodeo clown had a scorpion's tail, appeared in a puff of smoke armadillo ears and horns like a steer, these are the words he spoke: welcome to texas underground we got a barbeque all year 'round red-hot band with a country sound mister, they're the real mccoy so pull up a chair, you can chew on the fat gets a might dry, but we like it like that dance with the lady in the stetson hat welcome to texas, boy in a little while they opened up the gate, and who do you think walked in it was the prettiest lady that i ever did see, wearin nothin but a grin they gave her a vest, a red satin dress, matchin boots and silver spurs she walked by, she looked me in the eye, this is what i said to her: welcome to texas underground we got a barbeque all year 'round funky little band with a country sound ready for an all-night jam so pull up a chair, you can chew on the fat gets a might dry, but we like it like that dance with the feller in the stetson hat welcome to texas, ma'am down come a shipment of used car salesmen smilin like rattlesnakes every politician in the whole blame country claimin there was some mistake lawyers and thieves and state police, gentlemen of the press cons and flunkies, slackers, junkies, agents of the irs welcome to texas underground we got a barbeque all year 'round plenty of country singers around bound to have ourselves a ball so pull up a chair, you can chew on the fat gets a might dry, but we like it like that dance with the devil in a stetson hat welcome to texas, y'all dance with the devil in a stetson hat welcome to texas, y'all\n\n7.\n\nGas Station Girl 04:00\n\nshe ain't no senator's daughter she ain't no tennessee belle and i ain't no one but a lone drifter runnin the road down to playa miguel i met her out west pumpin diesel in a town where the sand meets the sea she was leather and snaps and an old baseball cap she stole the wild heart from me so take all your debutante princesses fair splendid in diamonds and pearls i'd trade 'em all in for a kiss on the wind from the lips of a gas station girl out on the michigan freeway workin a steady job there i was pullin a car lot from detroit to charlotte i guess i just lost her somewhere midnight through kansas i'd whisper her name spun in a dust devil's whirl no one replied but the moon in my eyes cryin tears for the gas station girl somebody send me a tailwind get me as far as l.a. with some lines i could use from a honky tonk blues to keep me from slippin away lord blow me westbound down ol' 66 out past the end of the world on a highway that runs through the heart of the sun to the door of the gas station girl\n\n8.\n\ni got a world of trouble in mind, the pilgrim said need somethin to believe in, or someone to be i got a mountain of worries just pilin up inside my head it's a curse of the worst kind for a dreamer like me so he climbed up alone on the turkey mountain ridge he looked out at the people on the plain and he saw god that night in the sleepy river and the city lights but he felt like a loser just the same states of misery, states of grace trouble and joy on a young man's face swing low, sweet chariot, take me down that long, black road into tulsa town i gotta roll these tumblin dice again, he sighed leave it up to good fortune, and the draw and the deal i gotta put my life out on that table and just let it ride slip away from these hounds of love that nip at my heels but over on the back porch in the early mornin rain sits a girl with a mirror in her smile insubstantial is the summer breeze as it disappears into the trees but she holds his eye for a little while states of misery, states of grace ... one dreamer got a job someplace, they say he got his life on track one dreamer got married, they say he sleeps in the sun one dreamer got strung out young, you know he never really did bounce back one dreamer got a second chance, and others got none but this dreamer's sittin on a park bench in a city faraway and he tells you the story of his youth forcin a laugh, makin a joke out of bein lonesome and silly and broke but he still makes room for a little truth states of misery, states of grace ...\n\n9.\n\nWorkin' for Jesus 04:58\n\nshe's a little overdressed, but it never hurts to shine she invokes the turtle dove, she awaits the number nine standin alone in the grey of the morning but soon the riders come to wait, and they take their papers out they do not know the girl, but they know that she's about keepin the light and the warnin and the bus comes like thunder and the doves rise around her and she don't mind the winter 'cause she's workin for jesus and she's workin for love she's workin for love there's a clock beside the bed, there's a bible on the stand she will come home after dark, she will take the book in hand feelin the grain of the black leather bindin and so she speaks to me sometimes of flesh and mortal chains and where the ashes go, and the spirit that remains risin like mist, see it shinin and her words sound like thunder and the spirit has found her and she knows how to reach me 'cause she's workin for jesus and she's workin for love she's workin for love well, i have set my foot upon the road of black and white i have passed the gates of dawn, i am makin for the light barrin the door on the darkness and sorrow but she is somewhere up ahead, she is far beyond my reach she has walked across the sea, she is sleepin on the beach borderin time and tomorrow and her days pass in wonder and the angels surround her and she don't even miss me 'cause she's workin for jesus and she's workin for love she's workin for jesus and she's workin for love and she's workin for jesus and she's workin for love she's workin for love\n\n10.\n\nGun-metal Eyes 05:49\n\nhis mama was a cherokee princess, or so it was said and his daddy was a seminole rebel with a price on his head and the other kids teased him but i never did see him to cry man there was some kind of righteous in the steel of his gun-metal eyes run with the wolf, fly like the dove mother below, father above weep with the earth, sing to the sky in the steel of your gun-metal eyes well he grew up in the washes and the rushes and the rain and the wind and the creatures of the forest and field were his only real friends and the lily of the valley and the nettle of the plains taught him well and the new moon shone on him as he wandered through the gully and the dell run with the wolf ... now one misty morning he heard the big bulldozers groan and the chainsaws and the fellin of trees and the breakin of stone and the boss-man knew better, but he had an empire to raise and one lone man before him with a rifle and doom on his face run with the wolf ... get on home, cried the owner, cause i hold the deed to this land and i ain't got no time to be foolin with no wild injun man and he gathered his strong boys around him and he called his police but there was no lookin back for the son of a seminole chief run with the wolf ... now some say he died in the fightin and was buried that day and some say he raged like an angel and he chased 'em away but the green hills stand silent, and nobody goes there no more just the ghosts and the memories and the shadows of the dark forest floor run with the wolf ...\n\n11.\n\nSarah Turn 'Round 04:51"
