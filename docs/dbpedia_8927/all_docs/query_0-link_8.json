        "text": "Tracy Grammer\n\nFULL Biography\n\n\"Tracy is a brilliant artist… Her voice is distinctive and beautiful, as is her mastery over the instruments she plays.\"\n\n– JOAN BAEZ\n\n\"Tracy Grammer is among the finest singers and musicians anywhere in folkdom.\"\n\n– THE BOSTON GLOBE\n\nTRACY GRAMMER is one of contemporary folk music's most beloved artists. Renowned for her pure, emotive vocals, perfectly intoned violin, and guitar playing that is by turns percussive and delicate, Grammer is also a gifted storyteller whose incantations add a rare mixture of vulnerability, intimacy, and hard-won insight to her performances. As one fan puts it, \"With Tracy, it's never just about the music; it's a soul journey.\"\n\nAnd what a journey it has been. Grammer rose to acclaim as half of the \"postmodern, mythic American folk\" duo, Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer. From 1998-2001, the duo released three internationally celebrated, chart-topping albums featuring Carter's mytho-poetic Americana songcraft and in 2002, toured with Joan Baez, both as featured artists and Baez's bandmates. Called “the new voice of modern folk music,” the duo was clearly in its ascendancy when in July 2002, Carter suffered a fatal heart attack mid-tour. He was 49; Grammer, 34.\n\nDetermined to honor the duo's trajectory and bring Carter's songs and those of other favorite writers to broader audiences, Grammer kept to the road, releasing several solo and archival recordings, including 2012's LITTLE BLUE EGG (Red House Records), the #1 most-played album on Folk Radio in 2012 with that year's #1 most-played song.\n\nGrammer is currently on tour celebrating the release of LOW TIDE, her first album of original songs and the #9 most-played album on folk radio for 2018. “Even though I’ve been writing prose all my life, I didn’t see myself a songwriter until writing songs became the only way to resolve the pains and unanswered questions of my life. LOW TIDE is an album of revelations, confessions, and ultimately, healing. I am proud of the writing and utterly thrilled with the sounds.\" Co-produced with long-time musical collaborator Jim Henry, LOW TIDE was released January 19, 2018 on Grammer's own label, Tracy Grammer Music, and is available through Fish Records in the U.K.\n\nGrammer plays theaters, coffeehouses, and festivals across the United States and Canada regularly, and has traveled to Europe and Japan. She holds the record for the most consecutive appearances at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival and performs in a variety of configurations, with Jim Henry (Mary Chapin Carpenter, Burns Sisters, Susan Werner), Paul Kochanski (Lori McKenna, Threesies, Nields), Lorne Entress (Lori McKenna, Catie Curtis, Mark Erelli) and David Chalfant (Nields, Stephen Kellogg) rounding out her ensembles.\n\nIn addition to touring, Grammer has acted in several community theater productions and a short film, is currently assistant director for \"Angels in America\" at Greenfield Community College, and has studied at HB Studio, Greenfield Community College, Hartford Stage, and Shakespeare & Co. She heads the Dave Carter Legacy Project and administers the publishing for Carter’s songs, as well as her own. Tracy lives in Greenfield, Massachusetts with her beloved Pickles."
