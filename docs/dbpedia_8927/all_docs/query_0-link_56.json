        "text": "Anyone who closely follows contemporary-folk music will tell you that had a special gift with words. So maybe the best way for his fans to mark his passing — and for newcomers to get a sense of his wordsmithing skills - is to listen to what Carter had to say about death.\n\n\"If you see my wandering form out on the borderline\n\n\"Between death and resurrection and the council of the pines\n\n\"Do not worry for my comfort, do not sorrow for me so\n\n\"All your diamond tears will rise up and adorn the sky beside me, when I go.\"\n\n- from \"When I Go\"\n\nA weaver of spell-binding tales of America's lost souls, Carter, 49, died of a heart attack Friday in Northampton, shortly after finishing a morning jog. With him when he died was his performing and personal partner, violinist Tracy Grammer. The duo was to perform the next day at the Green River Festival in Greenfield and this weekend at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival in Hillsdale, N.Y.\n\nCarter's songs called to mind Steve Earle's acoustic country-folk tales of drifters and dreamers. While most contemporary-folk singers focus on the little dramas of their personal lives, Carter's characters and themes were broader and timeless.\n\nHis first disc, \"Snake-Handlin' Man\" (Red River Records 1995), earned him the Entertainer of the Year Award from the Portland (Ore.) Songwriters Association. In 1998, he won the prestigious New Folk Award at the Kerrville (Texas) Folk Festival and released another CD, \"When I Go\" (Teleport). That CD, most of which was recorded in Grammer's kitchen, was credited to \" with Tracy Grammer.\"\n\nListen to music by and Tracy Grammer.\n\nOn Carter's third and fourth CDs, Grammer would receive equal billing. \"Tanglewood Tree\" (Signature Sounds: 2000) was named best folk CD of the year by the Boston Herald and \"Drum Hat Buddha\" (Signature Sounds: 2001) landed on several critics' year-end Top 10 lists.\n\nJoan Baez recorded several of Carter's songs and used the duo as an opening on a tour last spring. In an interview last year with the Boston Globe, she praised Carter for his ability to write songs that could be interpreted by other performers.\n\n\"It's a kind of genius, you know, and Dylan had the biggest case of it,\" she said. \"But I hear it in Dave's songs, too. ... There's a real spiritual connection in there nothing direct, it's in the imagery, and that really rings bells with me.\"\n\nDarryl Purpose, who included one of Carter's songs on his most recent CD, said last weekend, \"I've been saying for years that Dave was the best songwriter I know. In some ways he was so other-worldly that nothing has changed, but of course, everything has changed and it's an incredibly sad time.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times called Carter \"a major lyrical talent,\" and the British magazine Folk Roots said his songs were \"destined to become the stuff of legend.\" The (Portland) Oregonian said, \"Carter skitters across the language like a water bug but can plunge to depths of the heart and soul without so much as a splash.\"\n\nBorn in Oxnard, Calif., Carter worked as a mathematician and computer programmer until 1994, when he began pursuing a music career full time.\n\nCarter and Grammer teamed up after they met in 1996, Carter playing guitar and banjo, Grammer the violin and mandolin, and the two sharing vocals. Grammer said that the first time they sang together, \"It was like one ribbon of song.\"\n\nCarter cited influences as diverse as Carlos Castaneda, Dylan Thomas and Townes Van Zandt, and, with a touch of humor, called his own songs \"post-modern mythic American music.\"\n\nIn an e-mail sent to friends and fans last weekend, Grammer wrote, \"He loved beauty he was hopelessly drawn to magic and the light in all things.\n\n\"It was always my mission that the world hear and know the poetr vision and wonderful mystical magic of David Carter. This path is broad and long I hope you will stay the course with me.\"\n\nA memorial service has been tentatively scheduled for Aug. 16 in Portland, Ore.\n\nMaterial from wire services was used in this report."
