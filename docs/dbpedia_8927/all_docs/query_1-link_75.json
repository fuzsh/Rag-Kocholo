        "text": "TRACY GRAMMER rose to acclaim as half of the “postmodern, mythic American folk” duo, Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer. From 1998-2001, the duo released three internationally celebrated, folk chart-topping albums and toured with Joan Baez, both as featured artists and Baez’s band members. Called “the new voice of modern folk music,” the duo was clearly in its ascendancy when in July 2002, Carter suffered a fatal heart attack while the duo was on tour in Massachusetts. He was 49; Grammer, 34.\n\nDetermined to honor the duo’s journey and bring Carter’s award-winning songs, and those of other favorite writers, to broader audiences, Grammer kept to the road and now tours internationally, releasing solo albums as well as recovered and reclaimed Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer material.\n\nGrammer is Renowned for her springwater-clear alto, perfectly intoned violin, and guitar playing that is by turns percussive and delicate, Grammer has also become a masterful storyteller with an ease and charisma on stage -accompanied by a great sense of humor. Today Tracy visits with us about how her creative process has changed over the years along with her identity, stories of frightening and delightful performances and more!\n\nOn this episode of the Live Feed, KQAL’s Juan Galarza and Robert Pack visit with the frontman of Trampleed by Turtles.
