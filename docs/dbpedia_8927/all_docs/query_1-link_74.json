        "text": "Tracy Grammer will be in concert at Lost Moth Gallery on Sept. 27 at 7 pm. Grammer is an American folksinger who the Boston Globe calls “ one of the finest pure musicians anywhere in folkdom.” Grammer is known for her work as half of the folk duo Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer and for the solo career that she has continued since Carter’s death. She released three albums with Dave Carter during his lifetime. Taking into account Carter’s expressed wish that eventually she would sing all of his songs, she continued playing Carter’s music. She has continued to tour solo and has released three solo albums.\n\nRenowned for her clear alto, perfectly intoned violin, and guitar playing that is by turns percussive and delicate, Grammer is also a masterful storyteller with an ease and charisma on stage."
