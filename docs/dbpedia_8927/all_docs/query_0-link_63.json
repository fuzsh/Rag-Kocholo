        "text": "Interview with Tracy Grammer by Chris Milsom\n\nAcclaimed contemporary folk music star Tracy Grammer brings her springwater-clear alto voice, perfectly intoned violin, and percussive and delicate guitar playing to Central Pennsylvania for a Susquehanna Folk Music Society concert on Saturday, February 2, 2019, at the Fort Hunter Centennial Barn, 5300 N. Front Street, Harrisburg. The concert begins at 7:30 p.m.\n\nGrammer rose to prominence as half of the “postmodern, mythic American folk” duo Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer. Between 1998 and 2001, they released three internationally celebrated, chart-topping albums featuring Carter’s mytho-poetic Americana songcraft. In 2002 they toured with Joan Baez both as featured artists and as her band mates. Their rise in the music world ended in July 2002 when Carter suffered a massive heart attack and died at age 49.\n\nDetermined to honor their trajectory and keep Carter’s songs alive, Grammer stayed on the road, releasing several solo and archival recordings, including Little Blue Egg, which was the number-one most played album on folk radio in 2012 and contained that year’s number-one most played song.\n\nShe is currently touring to celebrate the release of Low Tide, her first album of original songs. Co-produced with long-time touring partner and multi-instrumentalist Jim Henry, who will appear with Grammer in the concert, the album was released January 19, 2018 on Grammer’s own label.\n\nConcert tickets are $24 General Admission, $20 for SFMS members and $10 for students ages 3-22. Advance tickets are available at http://www.sfmsfolk.org/concerts/TracyGrammer.html or by telephone at (800) 838-3006.

Turning 49 was scary because I was like: this is how old he was? This is unthinkable. I feel like a spring chicken. I was only 34 when Dave died. Then when I got to 50, it was very disconcerting, strange, and sort of tragic in its own way. Then I thought, alright, it’s ok, I am still here, my heart is still beating. I hadn’t realized that I had been hanging onto this fear that I was going to share the same fate for 16 years. So, then it was like, now what? What am I going to do with the gift of my remaining years? It seems like a small miracle that I live longer than he did.\n\nI had this sense when I met him that he was either going to die young or live forever. It’s kind of both in a way. He did die young but he left all this music behind and there it is, your “little tiny” contribution that will go on without you. It’s very interesting, the whole trip.\n\nProbably the most helpful thing anyone told me was that it took them about 5 years to start feeling like themselves again. At first, I was like, the heck with that! On the other hand, I relaxed into those 5 years and let it be. When I hit the 5 year mark, I checked with myself and said,” self, do you feel better now?” I could say “yes”. I do feel like I came around. I definitely felt like, that 5 years was a window I could work with.\n\nI want to congratulation you on the success of your 2018 release Low Tide. It is ending up #9 for folk albums on the Folk DJ List for 2018. I am so impressed with the powerful songs you have written and the process you took to get to those songs. What is that you want to tell us about that?\n\nWell, what I can say is that pain is really good for creativity. It is such a deep well. There are so many levels to it, right? There is the feeling level of it, you just have to sit there and feel it. But it doesn’t have to be just pain. If you can cultivate a curiosity about anything you are going through, there are just levels and levels of art you can make from it. It can be any emotion or sense of wonder or boredom or grieving. This is what I am learning to do. This sort of seems to be what my life is teaching me, to just sit with whatever comes and see what it has to offer. Sort of turn it over in your hand like it is a little stone you are trying to see what it’s made of. You hold it up to the light and get to know it, taste it and smell it and not really be in resistance because once it’s here, you can’t have it not be here. This has been sort of my meditation.\n\nThe songs on Low Tide come from that kind of attention, to a period of time in my life when I was going through a bunch of stuff. They really have nothing to do with Dave, in spite of what some people think. They are really more specific to a particular relationship and time. Then there is the song about my Dad, a healing song. (Tracy’s father died of cancer in 2013. They sometimes had a difficult relationship and he was very sick before he told her he was dying, passing away before she could see him in person)\n\nSo, just the process of sitting with things and being curious about them and letting them move you into art. That is sort of my big revelation with Low Tide, that capacity. It is a very different relationship to my music career than singing Dave Carter songs. In that realm, I have a creative foot in it but not the same. I make it pretty and presentable and make it alive, of course, for Dave Carter fans but it’s not quite the same as pulling from your own self as a source. It was quite the trip, I will say that.\n\nI can believe that! So, you wrote these songs 4 years ago and now you are out there touring in support of this album. I wonder as you are performing them now, how have things changed for you? Do you feel differently about any of them now? Do you sing them differently? How does this move you through a place you were 4 years ago?\n\nThey do, they are starting to feel different. Partly what happens when I am writing, I am letting stuff come through that I don’t necessarily understand. I have a daily writing practice I have been doing forever. I write longhand for at least an hour every day. I am really comfortable with my voice and the flow of words. I take a playful approach to it. When I sat down to write those songs, it was sort of like conjuring. I just let them come through. It they sounded pretty, or made me cry a little or if they just felt right, I let them go but I didn’t necessarily understand them. So, the process of singing them, and performing them and seeing how audiences react has really taught me what they are about. So now, I feel like when I deliver these songs, I can go a little deeper with them. On the surface it may seem the same as a year ago, but my feeling about them is different. I understand myself a little better and understand my muse a little better.\n\nI do occasionally think to myself, if you keep singing “Hole”, which is basically: I am never ever going to get married, how are you ever going find a partner? One wonders to what extent one is casting futures one doesn’t really want by repeating the same message over and over again. Maybe in the next batch of songs I will look at things from a different perspective.\n\nIt is very like me all my life to be just a tad tragic. I have what I call the “Blue Gene”, a depressive streak that I think I inherited from my father and grandmother. Not so much anymore, since I turned 50 and got free of that fear of dying. The Big Exhale, ha, ha.\n\nWell now, since you have this daily writing practice, I’m assuming you are writing more songs? It took you 4 years to get from writing those songs to putting out Low Tide, your 11th release but the first one of your own songs. Where are you at with your next project and how are you feeling about things?\n\nThe writing I do is not songs, it’s just flat out journaling. It’s like a meditation. It’s the first thing I do in the morning. After getting my latte, I sit down to write and I don’t usually remember what I write. I am planting seeds and see it as tending my rows not knowing what may grow. I sometimes underline words as I write that I want to come back to later. I am messing around with language which I think is fun.\n\nWhat I am preparing to settle into is some memoir work which has been long neglected. I started this in 2007 after taking a memoir class, writing a chapter here and a chapter there. I was in a writer’s group for about 4 years when I lived in Pennsylvania but stopped when I moved to Greenfield, MA. Luckily, the success of my fall tour will allow me to take this winter off from performing so much so I can get working on this project. I am ready to dig into my journals from 1998 up to about 2012, the 10 year mark (of Dave’s passing) and see what I’ve got.\n\nAs far as the next album is concerned, my hope is to come out with something in 2020. Low Tide is good for another national tour. I will be taking it out again in the fall. Making Low Tide was a lot of fun and I am looking forward to doing the next album.\n\nYou tour with some pretty amazing musicians and will be coming to the Susquehanna Folk Society show with Jim Henry. What do you want us to know about him?\n\nI have known and played with Jim Henry since 2003. He was with me for my first big tour after Dave died. He has been my stand by guy. He is a fantastic multi-instrumentalist. He is also a songwriter and producer and a podcast host and just wrote a book called “50 Pro Tips for Musicians”. He can do it all, was Mary Chapin’s guitar player for a while.\n\nJim and I have spent so many miles and shows together, we have a really great balance. Jim is the perfect counter point to my dark side with his funny banter and good stories. Also, when he comes along, I get to play my violin more which my fans always enjoy hearing. People can expect a lovely multi-instrument show with funny stories and a real lovely sound. Jim is a great harmony singer. This is my preferred presentation, the duo with Jim Henry.\n\nI was wondering about that, which format you prefer, solo, duos, or touring with a larger band?\n\nActually, I really like solo shows and I like touring with Jim Henry. When you are solo, you have a slightly more intimate, more direct contact with the audience. It’s more of a conversation. When I am with Jim Henry, it is more of a show. We are involving the audience, also, but we have a thing that we are doing. It’s my impression, and I could be completely wrong that the shows with Jim Henry might have a broader appeal. Some folks like Jim’s stories, guitar players nerd out on his gear, there’s just a little more for everybody. We have been doing it for so long that it is seamless for us and super fun.\n\nYou mentioned that with the Jim Henry shows, you get to play your violin more. Is that your preferred instrument?\n\nYou know, I spent so many years touring, just me and my guitar that I am more up to speed on the guitar at this point, but I played violin all my life and I do love violin and of course, I played violin and mandolin with Dave. That’s how I got my start in folk music. That’s who I was.\n\nIt will be interesting as you continue on this journey of “who am I and what am I really doing?” which instrument you will gravitate toward. Maybe that violin will be popping up more in your future?\n\nWell, I did buy myself a looper recently because I was starting to feel self-conscious about not playing violin on the solo tours. This way, even on the one-woman tours, I can start with guitar or the violin and play the other instrument over it, without getting all excessive about it. I know that many people groan when they hear the word, looper, but I think there is a tasteful way to do it. I think it is a super creative tool. I won’t be doing it on this tour, though, because I haven’t practiced with it enough yet to feel comfortable using it in a show.\n\nI don’t like playing the violin unaccompanied and I thought this would be would be a way for me to play it more because my fans actually bought me this violin. Yes, in 2004; I think it was the first crowd funding exercise ever. Somebody from Michigan heard that my old violin was having problems with tone and started a Pay Pal donation site and in something like 3-6 week’s time they had raised $10,000! So, I thought, Ok I guess I am getting a new violin. This was before Facebook. This was email. This was really hand to hand grassroots stuff. Now, I show up for my solo tours and my fans will ask “where is that violin we bought you?” so that is another motivation to learn the looper. It seems appropriate.\n\nWow! That is amazing! What a testament to you and your fans.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to ask you was about your cat, Miss Kitty, who you described in your interview with Artie Martello as a “lifesaver” for you. Does she travel with you on your tours?\n\nShe does! Miss Kitty went on the fall tour which lasted 6 or 7 weeks. She is an old girl now, at almost 17. She is very content to sit in the back on her pillow. She is great in the hotels and rides on the luggage cart. She doesn’t come to the shows. That’s a little bit too much stimulation for her. She is a great companion and it really is quite grounding to have a little someone to take care of on the road. You can really get lost in your head out on the road traveling by yourself.\n\nThanks so much for your time, Tracy. We all look forward to seeing and hearing you in a few weeks.\n\nChris Milsom lives in Wrightsville, PA.
