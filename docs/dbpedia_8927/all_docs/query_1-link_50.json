        "text": "WATCHUNG – Tracy Grammer comes to the Watchung Arts Center for a Sunday afternoon performance at 3 p.m. Feb. 3. Grammer will be joined by singer and multi-instrumentalist Jim Henry.\n\nThe audience also will have an opportunity to meet Grammer at the special dessert reception following the performance.\n\nGrammer, a contemporary folk artist, is renowned for her springwater-clear alto, perfectly intoned violin and guitar playing that is by turns percussive and delicate, Grammer's stories, often described as \"incantations,\" add a rare mixture of vulnerability, intimacy and hard-won insight to Grammer's performances.\n\nShe rose to acclaim as half of the \"postmodern, mythic American folk\" duo, Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer. From 1998 to 2001, the duo released three internationally celebrated, folk chart-topping albums featuring Carter's mytho-poetic Americana songcraft and in 2002, toured with Joan Baez, both as featured artists and Baez's band members. Called “the new voice of modern folk music,” the duo was clearly in its ascendancy when in July 2002, Carter suffered a fatal heart attack mid-tour. He was 49; Grammer, 34.\n\nREAD: Two Ton Brewing opens brewery with outdoor biergarten, speakeasy in Kenilworth\n\nREAD: Watchung comedian performs free show for inmates\n\nDetermined to honor the duo's journey and bring Carter's songs, and those of other favorite writers, to broader audiences, Grammer kept to the road, releasing solo recordings and selections from the duo's archives.\n\n\"I've been a writer all my life, but it was never my intention to be a songwriter,\" she said. \"However, the road has curves we can't see at the outset of the journey. At some point along the path, writing songs became the most effective medicine for the pains and unresolved questions of my life. 'Low Tide' is an album of revelations, confessions, questions, and ultimately healing. I am proud of the writing and utterly thrilled with the sounds. I took risks. I tried new approaches. I told the truth, and delivered my multitudes. My eleventh album is the first one that really sounds like me.\"\n\nCo-produced with Henry, her long-time touring partner, 'Low Tide' was released Jan. 19, 2018 on Grammer's own label, Tracy Grammer Music.\n\nHenry is an American folk singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He started out as a member of the Sundogs, a New England \"swamp-boogie-swing\" band, in the late 1980s. In 1993, he released his first solo album, 'Into the Blue.' He has toured with Mark Erelli, Deb Talan and The Burns Sisters, and has added instrumental parts to hundreds of albums. Henry toured for many years with Grammer and his accompaniment has appeared on both her solo albums. The two met for the first time at their first gig, unrehearsed. He is also a music producer and sound engineer.\n\nAll tickets are $25. Tickets can be purchased securely through watchungartscenter.eventbrite.com or by mail (include email address or phone number) or in person during office hours."
