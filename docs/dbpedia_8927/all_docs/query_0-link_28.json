Raised in southern California, Grammer comes from a musical family. A cousin, Leo Fortin, played double trumpets in Lawrence Welk’s band; her grandmothers and mother played keyboards and accordion; and her father’s guitar playing was one of her biggest inspirations. Tickets to the 7:30 p.m. concert are $15 and may be purchased at www.unityme.org. For more information, call 948-SHOW or 680-5819.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors."
