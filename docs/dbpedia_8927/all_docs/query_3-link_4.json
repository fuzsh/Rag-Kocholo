        "text": "BIOGRAPHY\n\nTracy Grammer is one of the most beloved acts in contemporary folk music. Called \"one of the finest pure musicians anywhere in folkdom,\" (Boston Globe), she has performed on coffeehouse, theater, and festival stages since 1997, and has been a guest on Mountain Stage, World Cafe, River City Folk, SiriusXM Radio, and Folk Alley. With pristine fingerstyle guitar, percussive strums, dynamic vocals, and incantatory narratives, Tracy delivers a polished, personal show notable for its melodies, heart-forward content, and engaging, authentic delivery. It's often the case at the end of the show that audiences can't decide which moved them more -- the songs, or the stories behind them.\n\nTracy's journey in music has been marked by both tragedy and triumph. In 2002, her duo Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer, heralded as \"the new voice of folk music\" by the Associated Press, was riding high on the success of their third album, DRUM HAT BUDDHA, and a five-week bus tour with Joan Baez as featured artists and Baez's band mates. Then, in July of that year, Dave Carter died suddenly in the middle of a tour. Tracy's determination and grace in the wake of unfathomable loss, and her transparency as she gained her footing as a solo artist, have earned her a devoted, lifelong following, who see her concerts as nothing less than a celebration of courage, bravery, vulnerability, and love. As one fan puts it, \"With Tracy, it's not just about the music -- it's a soul journey.\"\n\nIn addition to performing internationally, Tracy has judged Kerrville New Folk, served as a Folk Alliance panelist and mentor, led songwriting workshops, hosted the Dave Carter Memorial Writer's Round-up for eight years, taught choral music at private high schools in Massachusetts, and delivered the keynote at Cape May Singer-Songwriter Weekend. She has toured as bandmate and opening act for Joan Baez, performed with Hugh Masekela and Odetta as part of New York State's Songs of the Spirit Tour, and recorded with Mary Chapin Carpenter. She is the only performer invited to play the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival 13 years in a row and promoters everywhere agree: the photos don't do her justice.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nTracy mainly tours solo, but is happy to bring other players when sufficient budget and accommodations allow. Duo shows include Jim Henry (guitars, mandolin, Dobro, vocals) in and around New England and farther afield. The band adds Paul Kochanski (bass) and Lorne Entress (drums/percussion).\n\nClick here to make an offer.\n\n© Craig Harris / Philadelphia Folk Festival 2012\n\nPromoter Endorsements\n\n\"Tracy Grammer has blossomed from half of a famous duo to an accomplished solo performer whose show includes her renditions of [Dave] Carter's repertoire, a select few covers, and tunes of her own. Her strong, smooth voice, her friendly, conversational banter, and her warm and funny stories from before, during, and after the Dave Carter years draw the audience in like a well-written autobiography turned into a quality movie with a killer soundtrack. Highly recommended.\" - Joe Mercadante, Steeple Coffeehouse\n\n“This was one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. Ever.” - Wayne Anderson, Cafe Veritas\n\n\"Any world in which Tracy Grammer needs to say more than 'It's Tracy Grammer. When do you want me to play?' is a world gone horribly wrong.\" ​- Scott Sheldon, Sanctuary Concerts\n\n\"Tracy charmed our audience with songs and stories new and old, invoking the magic of her partnership with the late Dave Carter but weaving in her own unique style and grace, keeping the material fresh and engaging.\" - Melinda Perrin, A Place for Folk\n\n\"With Tracy, it's never just about the music. It's a soul journey.\" - a fan\n\nContact\n\nUse the button below to complete an offer form.​\n\nOfferings\n\n1. Concerts/Festivals\n\nTracy offers an engaging balance of story and song tailored to her audiences. Often described as incantations, her shows transport, enlighten, and entertain, and usually end with the whole room -- or hillside -- singing along. Solo internationally; duo in New England and farther afield with the right financials. Festivals, theaters, opera house, coffeehouse, private party, house concert, library. Family shows are also possible. Opportunities to support other artists or collaborate with peers are welcome and appreciated.\n\n2 Words+Music Show\n\nPowerful readings from the memoir in progress interspersed with song. Described by one attendee as a monologue with musical interludes. Best suited to playhouses and small theaters with professional stage, living room set, and lighting. Solo or duo. Sound system required.\n\n3. Song and Writing Workshops\n\nTracy is an experienced and enthusiastic artistic enabler. She has taught stagecraft and guitar at Puget Sound Guitar Workshop, songwriting two consecutive years at Camp Ned in Colorado and at New England Songwriters Retreat in 2019, led a master class at Portland Songwriters Association, and returns annually to Noisemakers in St. Petersburg, Fla. to work with kids on songwriting. Less about craft and more about impulse, writerly voice, mindfulness, developing a practice, and authenticity, Tracy offers an inspiring spiritual and physical approach to the art of song mining, using her methods and those of the late Dave Carter as examples.\n\n4. Memoir Writing Workshops\n\nWith a keen writer's ear, 12 years of prose workshop experience, and a daily writing practice, Tracy is an effective prose and memoir writing facilitator. Prompts, writing time, sharing, suggestions for further development. Ideally offered following a performance or workshop.\n\n5. Schools\n\nTracy taught choral music for two years at a private charter junior high/high school in western Massachusetts and continues to serve as a sub at another. Encouraging, uplifting, authentic performances and Q&A discussions tailored to the school's objectives, delivered by a real-life working musician. ​\n\n6. Private Events\n\nWeddings, memorials, church services, graduations, bedside/hospice, video greetings ... Tracy is delighted to be of service. Inquire within.\n\nWorkshop Testimonials\n\nWorkshop Feedback from \"One Foot in Ice, One in Fire: The Art of Moving On\" -- 2017 FAR-West Folk Alliance conference:\n\n“Tracy Grammer was wonderful. Very sharing, warm, intelligent.”\n\n“Great strength in the presentational personal journey.”\n\n“An extraordinary talk!”\n\n“One of the most moving, honest self-journey discussions I have ever experienced. The message was great – the integrity of the whole, even better.”\n\n“Tracy is fantastic! Wonderful discussion & wonderful listener engagement! Wonderful!”\n\n“Insightful – thoughtful – heartfelt – honest – humble.”\n\n“Brave and beautiful soul. Thank you for sharing your story.”"
