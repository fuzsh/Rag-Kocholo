They were national stars, based here in Portland. They had recorded several albums before Dave's tragic death in 2002. Since then, Tracy has been promoting Dave's songs on her own albums. We also will be hearing some rare selections by Tracy and friends recorded at Winterfolk 15, in 2012, a benefit for Sisters of the Road Caf√©. Tune in, Friday, September 24, a little after 12 noon for a celebration of the music of Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer. Also, we are going to hear several selections from John McCutcheon's latest album."
