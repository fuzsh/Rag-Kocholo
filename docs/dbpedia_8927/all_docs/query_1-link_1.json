        "text": "(This is a part of an eclectic, sometime series on artists WC has known and doesn’t want forgotten. The first post in this series was on Steve Goodman. The second was on Sir Terry Pratchett. WC has also written about Laura Nyro, Bill Berry, Jo Ann Wold and Boudleaux and Felice Bryant and many others. Here’s another wonderful artist WC doesn’t want to be forgotten.)\n\nDave Carter very nearly reinvented the music we now call Americana. He brought a joy in words, the use of words, rhyming and language to the folk music of his day without in any way sacrificing the music or the message. Take one of WC’s favorites, “Tanglewood Tree” from the 2000 album of the same name:\n\nLove is a tanglewood tree in a bower of green\n\nIn a forest at dawn\n\nFair while the mockingbird sings, but she soon lifts her wings\n\nAnd the music is gone\n\nYoung lovers in the tall grass with their hearts open wide\n\nWhen the red summer poppies bloom\n\nBut love is a trackless domain and the rumor of rain in the late afternoon\n\nLove is an old root that creeps through the meadows of sleep\n\nWhen the long shadows cast\n\nThin as a vagrant young vine, it encircles and twines\n\nAnd it holds the heart fast\n\nCatches dreamers in the wildwood with the stars in their eyes\n\nAnd the moon in their tousled hair\n\nBut love is a light in the sky, and an unspoken lie\n\nAnd a half-whispered prayer\n\n“Tanglewood Tree,” David Carter and Tracy Grammar\n\nIf you love language, and the use of language, you’ll love Dave Carter’s work. Nashville rejected Carter because his tunes didn’t fit their idea of popular music. But among folk musicians he was very highly regarded. When he teamed up with violinist Tracy Grammer he started to enjoy modest success. It’s Grammer’s chanted vocals on “Crocodile Man.”\n\nUnderneath the levee in a cat-tail thicket\n\nHidden in the shadow of a shady grove\n\nThere’s a thatched roof risin’ from a poke fence picket\n\nWhite smoke billows from a kettle-black stove\n\nInside the house is the hall of mirrors\n\nInside the mirror is the temple of sin\n\nAnd inside the temple is the face of mama\n\nAnd mama she know just where I been\n\nYeah, my mama know exactly where her bad. Boy. Been.\n\n“Crocodile Man,” Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer\n\nOn July 19, 2002, Carter and Grammar were in Hadley, Massachusetts to play that weekend at the Green River Festival. Carter went our for an early morning run. He returned, and suffered a massive heart attack. He died in Grammer’s arms. He was just 49 years old.\n\nCarter was a cellist with a degree in music, a degree in psychology, a computer programmer, as well as a folk musician. He was a student of Joseph Campbell, Arthurian legend, Buddhism and Carlos Castaneda. He left us five wonderful albums and a few posthumous releases. For a long time, Tracy Grammer was a fervent promoter and supporter of his music, but she seems to have moved on.\n\nWC thinks Dave Carter should not be forgotten. To prove that point, here’s his “When I Go,” from the album of the same name.\n\nAnd should you glimpse my wandering form out on the borderline\n\nBetween death and resurrection and the council of the pines\n\nDo not worry for my comfort, do not sorrow for me so\n\nAll your diamond tears will rise up and adorn the sky beside me when I go\n\nR.I. P. Dave Carter. Gone much too soon."
