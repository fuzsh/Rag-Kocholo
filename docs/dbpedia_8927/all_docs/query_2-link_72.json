        "text": "Tracy Grammer (born April 8, 1968, in Homestead, Florida) is an American folk singer known for her work as half of the folk duo Dave Carter & Tracy Grammer and for the solo career that she has continued since Carter's death in 2002.\n\nShe released three albums with Dave Carter from 1998 to 2001, at first doing instrumental work and providing backing vocals, and then, by their last album together, singing lead vocals on half of the tracks.\n\nTwo albums by the duo have been released following Carter's death. Following Carter's death in 2002, Grammer made the decision to play solo at several of the dates that they had scheduled, most notably an engagement at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival.\n\nTaking into account Carter's expressed wish that eventually she would sing all of the songs, she continued playing Carter's music. Her first solo album, The Verdant Mile, was an EP containing her first original composition, the title track, a eulogy for Carter.\n\nHer second solo release, Flower of Avalon, consisted of ten tracks, nine of which were written by Carter before his death, and one of which is a traditional folk song arranged by William Jolliff. The album was co-produced by Grammer and John Jennings.\n\nFeatured artists include Mary Chapin Carpenter, who provided many backing vocals, and Jim Henry, Grammer's touring partner and Signature Sounds label mate.Her third album, Book of Sparrows, was released in November, 2007 and is a seven-song EP featuring covers of songs by Tom Russell, Kate Power, David Francey, Dave Carter, and Paul Simon.\n\nThe EP was co-produced by Grammer and Jim Henry."
