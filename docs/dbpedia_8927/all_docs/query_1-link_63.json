        "text": "When I heard from my friend, Darryl Purpose that he was releasing new material by one of my favourite singer-songwriters, the greatly missed Dave Carter (August 13, 1952 – July 19, 2002) my heart started thumping in anticipation of what it could be.\n\nJoan Baez, who was on tour with with Dave in 2002 (with Tracy Grammer, Carter’s other half of the the duo) said of Dave, “There is a special gift for writing songs that are available to other people, and Dave’s songs are very available to me. It’s a kind of genius, you know, and Dylan has the biggest case of it. But I hear it in Dave’s songs, too”.\n\nFor me, Carter’s body of work encapsulate the very essence of storytelling and plays out in the minds eye like a visual movie, blessing each song with a sense of spirituality that is rooted in the Southern American country tradition.\n\nThe story goes that, during the planning stages of Darryl Purpose’s “Next Time Around” album Darryl went to visit Tracy Grammer to talk about what “Dave Carter song” he might like to sing on his new album. After listening to Darryl deliberate on the possibility of this song or that song from the back catologue, Tracy said, ‘Do you want to sing an old Dave song, or would you rather have a new Dave song?’ And so, ‘Girl From Golden‘, a previously unrecorded Dave Carter song became a big part of Darryl’s new project.\n\nA word from Darryl Purpose, “I’ve known Grace X. Oliver since she was a small girl, and there was always something about her. Everyone who met her knew – even back in single digits – said that she was an old soul with a new mystique. Something special. And the fact that she was Dave Carter’s niece increased the mystique and expectations even more. Now Grace is eighteen years old and heading out this month to start film studies at Ithaca. But in the meantime she managed to write, direct, and film the video of my version of Dave Carter’s Girl From Golden”.\n\nDarryl Purpose sings this previously unrecorded song by Dave Carter. Backing vocals by Tracy Grammer. Recorded at Blue Rock Studios in Wimberley TX.\n\nDarren Beech August 2014\n\nRelated\n\nWe all give our spare time to run folking.com.
