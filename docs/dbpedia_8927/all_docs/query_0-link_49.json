        "text": "When I Go [19 July 2002]\n\nI often fancy myself a songwriter.\n\nHowever, when I’ve stepped back and considered the likes of Dave Carter or Richard Shindell (amongst others), I hardly consider that my adventures with the pen and guitar approach the level of what either of these two have no doubt left on the proverbial editing room floor.\n\nI saw Dave and Tracy for the first time in Albuquerque, New Mexico at a North American Folk Alliance conference showcase. I had heard so much about them on a couple of listservs I subscribed to and I wanted to finally find out what the big hubbub was about. It didn’t take long to understand why the raves came so often and excitedly. They played three songs: When I Go, The River, Where She Sleeps and Kate And The Ghost Of Lost Love.\n\nI sat with a wonder that people must have experienced when they witnessed “It’s All Right Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” or the like coming from the mouth of twenty-year-old Bob Dylan… the ability to crystalize such broad, deep “humanscapes” into a couple of minutes worth of song left me feeling so lucky to be living on this planet at the same time as this amazing songwriter; this wonderfully woven entity known as Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer.\n\nLast year sometime, shortly after the release of their record drum hat buddha, after listening several times to “Gentle Arms Of Eden” (which floored me when I first heard it at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival a couple of years ago, then floored me yet again three months later after hearing his story of its origin) or “Ordinary Town” or “Merlin’s Lament”, I wondered what it was that made Dave the great songwriter that he was.\n\nAll I could really come up with was that he was completely consumed with wonder, that he was constantly searching for something; he was driven to learn, to know.\n\nAt some point, as I pondered Dave Carter (while ignoring my work), words and music took form in my head and by week’s end I had written a song for Dave. I e-mailed the lyrics to him along with my somewhat lengthy dissertation about how it came to be (proclaiming him a genius in the process). and he politely responded that he’d be happy to hear it some time. I was prepared to play it for him last year at Falcon Ridge, but couldn’t make the leap. I had planned on trying to summon the courage to do it this year.\n\nAlas…\n\nI can’t claim to have been a friend of Dave Carter’s, although I think he finally came to recognize me in small crowds whilst I wore a name badge. He and Tracy played at my coffeehouse series once (I take pride in being the first presenter in Michigan to book them) and I was in the process of booking them again for March of 2003 when he died. As we all know, he was a special, gifted person, and I will mourn his passing, for I believe he was as genuine a person as I will ever meet. I will mourn for Tracy, whom Dave clearly deeply loved, honoured and respected; I will mourn for the songs that Dave had yet to write, and for those that must live on now without his voice to sing them.\n\nSERIOUS MAN (for DC)\n\nCopyright 2023 by Patrick T. Power\n\nHe’s a serious man\n\nWith the eyes of a beggar\n\nWho looks for a meal;\n\nWho does what he can;\n\nWhose only forever\n\nSpins ‘round like a wheel\n\nHe’s a serious man\n\nIn the eyes of a stranger\n\nWho passes him by;\n\nWho looks when he can\n\nIn spite of the danger\n\nOf catching his eye\n\nSometimes I trip, sometimes I fall\n\nAnd all I know is: I know nothing at all\n\nHe’s a serious man\n\nHis eyes see a glory\n\nIn the shadows of grace.\n\nHe holds in his hand\n\nA song and a story —\n\nA hobo’s embrace\n\nSometimes I run, sometimes I crawl\n\nAnd all I know is: I know nothing at all\n\nHe’s a serious man\n\nWith the eyes of a sparrow\n\nAnd the soul of a dove\n\nWho speaks when he can;\n\nAnd, like the pierce of an arrow,\n\nHe spends out his love\n\nSometimes I rush, sometimes I stall\n\nAnd all I know is: I know nothing at all\n\nHe’s a serious man."
