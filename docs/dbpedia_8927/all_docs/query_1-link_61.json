        "text": "With her natural, relaxed vocals and deep engagement with the beauty and mystery of being alive, she is one of the most compelling voices in contemporary folk. As one fan put it, \"With Tracy, it's never just about the music. It's a soul journey.\"\n\nRenowned for her springwater-clear alto voice and guitar playing that is by turns percussive and delicate, Tracy Grammer is also a masterful storyteller with an ease and charisma on stage -- not to mention a riotous sense of humor.\n\nGrammer has recorded and performed with Joan Baez and Mary Chapin Carpenter, headlined several of the nation's top folk festivals, including Philadelphia Folk Festival and Falcon Ridge, and enjoyed 12 consecutive years as one of folk radio's 50 top-played artists, both solo and with the late Dave Carter.\n\nHer highly acclaimed 11th release, Low Tide (2018), is the first of her albums to showcase her original songs. “I’ve been a writer all my life, but it was never my intention to be a songwriter,” she says. “At some point along the path, writing songs became the most effective medicine for the pains and unresolved questions of my life. Low Tide is an album of revelations, confessions, questions, and ultimately healing. I am proud of the writing and utterly thrilled with the sounds. I took risks. I tried new approaches. I told the truth and delivered my multitudes. My eleventh album is the first one that really sounds like me.”\n\nTracy will be performing with Jim Henry, a folk singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. He toured for many years with Tracy and accompanied her on her solo albums.\n\n“Her gifts as a musician are like those of a painter who is a master of chiaroscuro, offering light and shadow at every turn.” --Mary Chapin Carpenter\n\n“Tracy Grammer is a brilliant artist and unique individual. Her voice is distinctive, as is her mastery over the instruments she plays.” --Joan Baez\n\n“Tracy Grammer has that elusive quality of being able to speak directly to another person’s heart – instantly bypassing all of the usual infrastructure – the moment she starts singing. She’s great.” --Richard Shindell\n\nMember appreciation show--Free for Folkus members"
