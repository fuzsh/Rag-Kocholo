        "text": "Weather and climate in London\n\nLike all English cities such as Bath and Bristol, London has an oceanic climate. It's true, you have to enjoy the rain to travel within the English capital, because showers are present all year round, even in summer.\n\nThat being said, the rains are always of low intensity, which means that in the end, London is one of the European capitals that receives the lowest amount of precipitation, especially when compared to the capital of Italy, Rome.\n\nTraveling to London is possible throughout the year, with more or less favorable weather. Let's explore the climate in London in more detail to better prepare for your trip!\n\nClimate in London in Summer\n\nIn London, summers are temperate. It is quite rare to experience high temperatures at this time of year, which helps avoid the stifling heat of some other cities like in Spain or Greece. Indeed, on average, temperatures range between 16 and 23°C in July and August.\n\nIt cannot be said that summer is a drier season than autumn or winter, as it rains about 5 days per month throughout the year in the English capital. However, September is a slightly less rainy month, which you could bet on if you want to avoid using your umbrella as much as possible during your vacation.\n\nDespite this, summer is the most favorable period for a stay in London as the sun is largely present. In fact, it quickly reappears in the London sky after a shower.\n\nClimate of London in Winter\n\nThe climate of London in winter is rather cold, but temperatures are rarely icy. Indeed, in December, average temperatures range between 5 and 9°C and between 4 and 8°C in January and February.\n\nYou may experience snowfall, but it is a relatively rare phenomenon in London. As with the rest of the year, rain is always present in the form of light showers. However, the gray sky dominates London in winter, sometimes with fog, creating a rather gloomy atmosphere...\n\nFurthermore, the presence of the Thames tends to accentuate the sensation of cold, especially when the wind picks up... It's the ideal time to seek refuge in London's cafes and museums.\n\nClimate in London in Spring\n\nHumid, London's spring also experiences beautiful sunny days. Temperatures are mild and pleasant, ranging from around 11 to 18°C in May.\n\nHowever, evenings remain quite cool at this time of year. Additionally, temperatures rise slowly after winter, so in March and April, the climate remains cold. The good news is that spring is a relatively low rainfall period in England, with about 3 days of rain per month.\n\nClimate in London in Autumn\n\nLike the rest of the year, the weather in London in autumn remains quite humid. Nevertheless, September and October experience quite little precipitation, making it an ideal period for a stay in the capital. The weather also remains sunny throughout the month of September.\n\nHowever, even in the absence of rain, the sky is often gray from October onwards, creating a rather gloomy atmosphere for exploring the city.\n\nAdditionally, in autumn, temperatures drop rapidly with mercury around 11-15°C in October and below 10°C in November."
