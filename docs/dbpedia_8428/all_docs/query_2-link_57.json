        "text": "Summer in Edinburgh\n\nThe “hottest” months in Edinburgh are normally July and August. During summer, the average low temperatures are 52°F (11°C) and average highs are 66°F (19°C); therefore, it is never very hot. Although, occasionally it has reached 88°F (31°C) in July and August.\n\nWinter in Edinburgh\n\nThe coldest months of the year are January and February, with average lows of 33.8°F (1°C) and highs that rarely exceed 44.6°F (7°C).\n\nThere is often fog and heavy precipitations in autumn and winter. Scotland’s capital is also renowned as a windy city, and it is famously known as the “Windy City”, although it is a lot less windy than other cities in the UK.\n\nBest time to visit Edinburgh\n\nEdinburgh is appealing all year round, but if you are not a fan of the cold and rain, we recommend visiting the city in summer.\n\nIf you’ve already decided to go during the coldest months, don't worry, all you need to make the trip enjoyable is a good coat, gore-tex shoes and an umbrella.\n\nAll four seasons in one day"
