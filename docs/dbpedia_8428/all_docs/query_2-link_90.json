        "text": "Which is the best Greek island to visit in October, and which will be hottest?\n\nOctober is when the tourist season starts to unwind, but many experts regard these last few weeks as among the very best in Greece, and not just because the weather is starting to get miserable at home. In the Greek islands, the sun will almost certainly be shining all day and the sea will be deliciously warm for swimming. In the southern islands, you can expect daily highs reaching 28ºC, falling to 24ºC towards the end of October.\n\nThe surprisingly warm weather in Greece in October make it an ideal place to visit, after the very hot and crowded months of summer, but which islands are the hottest? Keep scrolling for more details, including my personal holiday recommendations.\n\nWhich Greek islands will be hottest in October?\n\nKos\n\nAverage temperature in October: 25ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nFlying time from UK: 4 hours\n\nDue to its southerly location, Kos is consistently one of the hottest Greek islands. In October, the sea will be a pleasant 23ºC, with evening temperatures rarely falling below 15ºC. Only 4-5 days are likely to be affected by rain. It’s a wonderful time of year to explore historical sites or rent a bicycle to explore remote villages.\n\nHoliday recommendation: the luxury all-inclusive IKOS Aria is excellent value – and we have negotiated an exclusive £250 discount for our readers. Nearby Rhodes has a similar climate and is home to a lovely Mark Warner beach club which stays open until the end of October.\n\nCyprus\n\nAverage temperature in October: 26ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nFlying time from UK: 5 hours\n\nThe Greek part of Cyprus is a little further from the UK than other Mediterranean islands, but the extra hour in the air gives you a few more degrees of heat. October can be seriously hot with daily highs of 26ºC, eight hours of sun, sea temperatures of 24ºC and a lower chance of rain than elsewhere in Greece.\n\nHoliday recommendation: check out these places to stay in Cyprus.\n\nCorfu\n\nAverage temperature in October: 19ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 7\n\nFlying time from UK: 3 hours 15 minutes\n\nCloser to the UK yet still warm, Corfu is a compromise for those who don’t want a long flight. It’s a popular destination for families looking for some late sun over October half-term week.\n\nHoliday recommendation: these villas in north-east Corfu are popular with families with older children. If your kids are younger, you could check out these holidays with childcare from Simpson Travel. If you crave an all-inclusive resort, head to one of the two hotels run by Mar-Bella Collection which are open throughout October.\n\nPaxos\n\nAverage temperature in October: 19ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 7\n\nFlying time from UK: 3 hours 15 minutes to Corfu, then transfer to Paxos by ferry\n\nPaxos is a glorious island to visit if you want to get off the beaten track. In October it will be calm, relaxing and free of crowds. The climate is very similar to Corfu so the sea will be warm enough for swimming, but temperatures aren’t as high as in the southern islands. It’s an ideal time for walking and exploring.\n\nHoliday recommendation: these villas and traditional houses are gorgeous. Couples will love these small, quiet adult-only hotels.\n\nSantorini\n\nAverage temperature in October: 23ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 7\n\nFlying time from UK: 4 hours 15 minutes\n\nSantorini enjoys warm weather in October and the evenings tend to be mild, not falling below 16ºC. On the volcanic sand beaches, you can happily swim with the sea temperature around 22ºC. You can expect seven hours of daily sunshine and only a very small chance of rain.\n\nHoliday recommendation: Choose from these stylish boutique hotels in Santorini.\n\nCrete\n\nAverage temperature in October: 24ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 7\n\nFlying time from UK: 4 hours\n\nCrete is the largest of the Greek islands and well worth exploring. You can drive into the beautiful mountainous interior and enjoy spectacular walks, including the famous Samaria Gorge. The sea temperature is a warm 22ºC while rain is unlikely. At night, temperatures typically stay above 15ºC. In other words, the weather in Crete in October is superb.\n\nHoliday recommendation: these boutique hotels and stylish houses for rent.\n\nHalkidiki\n\nAverage temperature in October: 21ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 6\n\nFlying time from UK: 3 hours 15 minutes to Thessaloniki\n\nHalkidiki on the Greek mainland offers unspoilt nature, pristine beaches and some outstanding hotels including IKOS Resorts. It’s one of the coolest holiday regions in Greece but you can still expect six hours of daily sunshine and warm sea temperatures.\n\nHoliday recommendation: stay at IKOS Olivia or IKOS Oceania, both good-value luxury all-inclusive resorts. If you have children and want some half-term sun, Sani Resort is one of the most sought-after family resorts in the Med. See the latest special offers.\n\nCruise holidays in Greece in October\n\nStar Clippers operates sailing cruises on traditional tall ships in the Eastern Mediterranean throughout the summer months and into October. Most itineraries depart from Athens. This is a wonderful way to explore the region, with access to smaller ports that large cruise ships cannot reach.\n\nTry another month\n\nHottest Greek islands in February\n\nHottest Greek islands in March\n\nHottest Greek islands in April\n\nHottest Greek islands in May\n\nHottest Greek islands in June\n\nHottest Greek islands in July\n\nHottest Greek islands in August\n\nHottest Greek islands in September\n\nHottest Greek islands in October\n\nHottest Greek islands in November\n\nExtreme weather in Greece in October\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Greece in October was 40.0ºC (104.0ºF) in 1994, in the town of Farsala, in the Thessaly region, north of Athens. Farsala is known for its ancient ruins and connections to Greek mythology.\n\nThe lowest recorded temperature in Greece in October was -4.2ºC (24.4ºF) in 1989, in the town of Nevrokopi in the mountainous region of Eastern Macedonia.\n\nThe driest ever October in Greece was in 1963, with virtually no precipitation reported across the country. The wettest October was in 2014, with a total rainfall of 509.1 mm (20.04 inches).\n\nSave up to 40% on your next holiday\n\n* Did you know you can save up to 40% on holiday prices?
