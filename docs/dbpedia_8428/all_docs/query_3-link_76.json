        "text": "Hi, I am considering a 6 day trip to PEI the last week of October. I was wondering what the weather is like at that time of year? Would we have missed the fall colours? We want to tour the Island. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nAnswer by:\n\nGeneral Island\n\nGood day Lynn,\n\nOctober is the most beautiful month on Prince Edward Island. The spectacular fall foliage is at its peak around the middle of the month; with luck, you’ll still be able to catch some of the colours toward the end of the month.\n\nThe weather tends to be comfortably cool in late October (the average temperature is 12C).\n\nWhile many places will be closed for the season at that time, there certainly is still lots to do… in fact, you’ll probably spend most of your time experiencing PEI as just Islanders do! Below is a list of some of my favourite things to do and places to eat during the shoulder season.\n\nGO EXPLORING\n\nTake in one (or all!) of PEI’s scenic drives.\n\nEach of the three scenic drives has its own website – these are excellent resources:\n\nPoints East Coast Drive\n\nCentral Coast Region\n\nNorth Cape Coastal Drive\n\nWhile doing these tours, if you’re feeling adventurous, turn onto one of the Island’s many red dirt roads you’ll come across along the way… they bring scenic to a whole new level (especially in the fall).\n\nStop and stroll through some of the most picturesque villages on the Island: Georgetown, Victoria-by-the-Sea, and Rustico are some of my favourites.\n\nHike or bike the Confederation Trail (abandoned railway beds)\n\nGo for a beach walk. The weather in October is usually dry, so you’ll be able to walk miles and miles of beaches to your heart’s content.\n\nCollecting sea glass has become a very popular pastime on PEI in recent years, so while you’re walking the beaches, keep an eye out for these little treasures in the sand. Click here to read a recent article about the best places to find sea glass on PEI.\n\nDiscover some of the Island’s lighthouses – below are two useful links to help you plan your lighthouse tour:\n\nCBC Article\n\nPEI Lighthouses Society\n\nCheck out Experience PEI, the Island’s leading provider of experiences. I checked the calendar, and you’re in luck: they have a wide selection of experiences available in late October – click here for details.\n\nEAT OUT\n\nEnjoy a feed of fresh seafood at Lobster on the Wharf in Charlottetown (they have non-seafood options as well). With decks right in the water, and a stunning view of the bustling harbour, this is one of the most memorable dining experiences in downtown Charlottetown.\n\nOn Saturday, visit the Charlottetown Farmers’ Market anytime between 9am and 2pm (bring your appetite!)\n\nEat at #5 Café in Murray Harbour. It’s in a former church that has been restored and converted into a restaurant. The owners are from New Zealand, and they have travelled the world. Their food is amazing, and the overall dining experience is lovely. They will be open until December, and although the fall hours have not yet been set, the owners tell me it will likely be Wednesday to Sunday, 11:30am to 7:30pm (contact them before you go, to double check).\n\nA handful of small breweries have opened on the Island over the last few years, and they are earning recognition for their high-quality craft beer.\n\nGO SIGHTSEEING\n\nBook a tour through Prince Edward Tours:\n\nCharlottetown city tour (1 hour)\n\nIsland Drive & Anne of Green Gables (4 hours)\n\nFor fans of Anne of Green Gables, no trip to PEI is complete without a visit Green Gables House. It’s open from 9am to 5pm until October 31st. Click here for more information.\n\nENJOY LIVE ENTERTAINMENT\n\nEnjoy live traditional music at the Old Triangle in downtown Charlottetown. I checked their gig schedule, and you’re in luck: there’s lots happening there in late October.\n\nDefinitely take in a ceilidh while you’re here – this is very much an Island experience. They take place at different venues around the Island.\n\nThe Buzz is a fantastic resource for everything that is happening on the Island at any given time (all the locals use this website).\n\nI hope this information is helpful as you plan your fall getaway. I’ll sign off with this quote from Lucy Maud Montgomery: “I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.”\n\nNicole\n\nShare this Answer:\n\nFacebook Twitter Email\n\nRecently Asked Questions\n\nDon't be Shy...\n\nReady to Ask an Islander?
