        "text": "Visiting Ireland in October is a great shout, once you’re aware of the pros and cons.\n\nI’ve lived in Ireland for 33 years and, in my opinion, October is one of the best times to travel to Ireland.\n\nWith average highs of 13°C/55°F and average lows of 6°C/42°F, the weather in Ireland in October is generally cool and crisp and the days still have plenty of daylight.\n\nBelow, you’ll discover everything from things to do in Ireland in October, the various festivals running this month and much more.\n\nSome quick need-to-knows before visiting Ireland in October\n\nAlthough a visiting Ireland in October is reasonably straightforward, there are a handful of need-to-knows that’ll get you up-to-speed quickly.\n\nBelow, you’ll find info on the weather in Ireland during this month along with some handy info.\n\n1. The weather in Ireland in October\n\nOctober in Ireland sees the days shorten and temperatures drop, with average highs of 13°C/55°F and average lows of 6°C/42°F.

Average temperatures\n\nThe average temperature in Ireland in October ranges from average highs of 13°C/55°F to average lows of 6°C/42°F.\n\n3. Daylight\n\nAlthough October is autumn in Ireland, the days are still relatively long. At the beginning of the month, the sun rises at 07:33 and sets at 19:09. That’s a solid 11 hours a day to plan your Ireland itinerary around.\n\n4. It’s shoulder season\n\nOctober is shoulder season in Ireland (i.e. the time between peak-season and off-season). This means flights should be cheaper and places will be quieter. Keep in mind that kids get a week of holidays in Ireland at the end of the month, so accommodation prices can rise around then.\n\n5. Festivals and events\n\nHeaps of festivals in Ireland run during October. Two of the most notable are Cork Jazz Festival and Púca Festival. However, if festivals aren’t your thing, there’s endless things to do in Ireland in October.\n\nFast facts: The pros and cons of October in Ireland\n\nSo, I lightly touched on the handful of advantages and disadvantages to visiting Ireland in October above, but I’ll list them out properly below.\n\nI’ve lived in Ireland for 33 years, so the below are based on my own experience (note: you’ll find detailed info on the weather in the next section):\n\nThe pros\n\nLongish days: At the beginning of the month, the sun rises at 07:33 and sets at 19:09\n\nIt’s quieter: As we’re outside peak season, many places will be much quieter in comparison to the months previous\n\nAttractions open: You’ll find that some tours and attractions in Ireland close during winter – most are still running in October\n\nWeather: October is generally quite mild and the cool, crisp weather is nice to saunter around in\n\nFestivals: Numerous Halloween festivals take place (see our Irish festivals calendar for more)\n\nThe cons\n\nUnpredictable weather: Yep, it’s a pro and a con. In October 2017, Storm Ophelia hit Ireland, and it was the worst to hit the island in 50 years\n\nThe weather in Ireland in October in different parts of the country\n\nThe weather in Ireland in October can vary quite a bit. Below, we’ll provide you with an insight into the weather in Kerry, Belfast, Galway and Dublin in October.\n\nNote: The rainfall figures and the average temperatures have been taken from the Irish Meteorological Service and the UK Met Office to ensure accuracy:\n\nDublin\n\nThe weather in Dublin in October tends to, on average, be pretty OK.
