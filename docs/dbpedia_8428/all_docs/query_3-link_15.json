        "text": "London Underground\n\nThe quickest way to travel around, London's Underground metro system is the oldest and most famous in the world. In total, there are 11 lines on the Tube within nine zones. On most days the London Tube is open between 5AM and 12AM, but there is extended services for Friday and Saturday. Fares vary widely for the London Underground depending on when you're using the service and how far you're going. The easiest way navigate the Tube is to invest in what's known as an Oyster Card. These re-chargeable card can be purchased at any Tube station. Put as much money as you want on your Oyster Card and scan it at the entrance of the Tube station. It’s much cheaper to use than single tube tickets.\n\nBlack Cabs - Traditional London taxis\n\nThese cabs can easily be found all over central London as well as by major train stations, bus stops, and by Heathrow Airport. Please ensure the yellow \"taxi\" light in the front of the cab is on when you're trying to hail a vehicle.\n\nAll taxicab services in London are metered and there's a £3 minimum charge. While you're not required to tip, it's always welcome, and most Londoners will round up their fare.\n\n1. Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace\n\nOne fascination that is not to be missed is the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace.
