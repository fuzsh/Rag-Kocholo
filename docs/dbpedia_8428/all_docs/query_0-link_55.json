        "text": "A persistently mild year apart from the exceptionally cold first-half to January - ironic really. If not for that, 1982 probably would have been close to being a 10+ C.E.T. year, rare for the time, though 1983 managed it anyway. This is the year where the shift into the current warmer weather began in some ways as the persistent above average months (though not extreme) carried into 1983 with the very hot summer and indeed into 1984 as well - three consecutive warmer than average years. This broke from 1985 through 1987, but then returned full time more or less in 1988. I've read quite a few times across the pond that December 1982 brought exceptional warmth to the East Coast. In general, the atmosphere was definitely changing.\n\nI think aside from the historic cold in January, the month interesting month from my perspective was June 1982 - just how thundery the month was. Usually our wettest summer months come from non-thundery weather fronts giving copious amount of cold, heavy rain - but June 1982 was extremely thundery and the wettest of the century to that point and the wettest June overall since 1879 (June 1997 would go on to beat June 1982 but we wouldn't have a wetter June than 1879 until June 2007 which was then trounced by June 2012). I also think I remember someone on here pointing out it has one of the hottest first-halves to June on record, but it did cool down considerably later on. July 1982 actually was very dry (there were a run of mostly very dry Julys from 1976 to 1984) and I recall looking at the synoptics and them being quite good. I think I recall reading of significant flooding in the SE with 2 days of constant rain in October in what was a very wet and rather cool October.\n\nHere's the pressure patterns for each month of 1982 from NOAA.\n\nJanuary 1982 Classic cold pattern with low pressure undercutting the intense northern blocking. Must have been wet across Spain & Portugal.\n\nFebruary 1982 You can see the blocking remained into February but had fell too far southeast to bring any meaningful cold. Mild on the continent I imagine.\n\nMarch 1982 Looks like your bog standard March - quite mild, stormier the further north but with occaisonal ridges bringing mild, sunny weather.\n\nApril 1982 Must have been very dry and fine across Ireland. Further east, more risks of cold northerly incursions and night frosts. Very dry looking.\n\nMay 1982 Looks like it must have been very hot across much of Europe - here, more of a battleground between northern blocking and a major Euro anticyclone. Dry for the south I imagine.\n\nJune 1982 You can see how this month featured very wet, humid southerly incursions but also ended with cold northerlies. The southerlies won out overall.\n\nJuly 1982 Not considered a classic month, but looks very dry, warm and fine, especially further north. The south would have been more inclined for thunder. Somewhat like summer 2021?\n\nAugust 1982 Looks very cool, wet and blustery, doesn't it?\n\nSeptember 1982 Quite hot on the continent I imagine, but for us just very wet and probably dull - especially further north where it looks very grim!\n\nOctober 1982 You can see why it was so wet, the large blocking to our NE would have held back fronts from passing over - sort of like a less intense October 2000.\n\nNovember 1982 Stormy and mild. Looks very unsettled to our N/NE!\n\nDecember 1982 I imagine the cold weather was kept to our NE overall with quite cold zonality here at times. Milder the further southwest you go I reckon."
