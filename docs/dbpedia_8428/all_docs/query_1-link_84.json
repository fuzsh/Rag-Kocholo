        "text": "Q. Where is hot in October?\n\nA. October is a perfect time to escape the UK for some autumn sun. The Mediterranean is hot and sunny through most of October with temperatures in the high 20s, and the sea is invariably warm enough for a leisurely swim. Temperatures only start to cool down towards the end of the month.\n\nThese are my personal recommendations based on 15 years writing about travel for The Sunday Times. Follow the links below for more details and prices. Also see our expert guides to the best family holidays in October half-term and the best singles holidays in October.\n\n* Did you know you can save up to 40% on holiday prices? See our latest travel deals and enter your email address below to get updates every fortnight.\n\nKos, Greece\n\nAverage temperature in October: 25ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 9\n\nFlying time from UK: 3 hours 45 mins\n\nOctober in the Mediterranean is a month of transition: there is usually a fairly big drop in temperatures from the beginning of the month to the end. To be sure of hot weather throughout October, I would head south. The Greek island of Kos has a long season, and this is an ideal time of year to pick up a bargain. If you want an upmarket all-inclusive hotel, the IKOS Aria is an excellent choice – see the latest special offers and check out this exclusive £250 discount for our readers.\n\nAlso consider: Crete, the most southerly of the Greek islands. For an inspired selection of small hotels and guest houses in beautiful locations, I recommend i-escape. See more holiday ideas in Greece and my guide to the hottest Greek islands in October.\n\nSeville, Spain\n\nAverage temperature in October: 27ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 45 mins\n\nThe elegant cities of Seville and Granada lie in the “frying pan” of Andalucia, with temperatures in July and August frequently topping 40ºC. October is a far better time to visit. You could spend a few days being dazzled by palaces and eating tapas al fresco, then head to the wild unspoilt beaches of the Costa de le Luz. It’s usually still hot until the end of October.\n\nAlso consider: sophisticated Palma the capital of Mallorca, and Sorrento on Italy’s Amalfi Coast. For more ideas, see the best city breaks in October and where’s hot in Spain in October and my guide to where’s hot in Italy in October.\n\nThe Azores\n\nAverage temperature in October: 23ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 5\n\nFlying time from UK: 4 hours\n\nThe volcanic islands of the Azores boast superb beaches and are among the best places in Europe for whale and dolphin watching.There are direct flights from the UK to these Portuguese islands and the weather is ideal for walking or cycling.\n\nAlso consider: the beaches of the Algarve and the beautiful unspoilt Alentejo region of Portugal both enjoy excellent weather in October. You can explore them both on a fly-drive holiday, staying in historic pousada hotels. See my guide to where’s hot in Portugal in October.\n\nCorsica, France\n\nAverage temperature in October: 22ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nFlying time from UK: 2 hours 10 mins\n\nI love the French island of Corsica for its white-sand beaches, rugged mountains and delicious food, and it’s typically hot in early October. You’ll find a range of apartments and villas with private pools and you can take advantage of special offers this late in the season.\n\nAlso consider: a luxury barging holiday in the South of France for a really indulgent treat. For more inspiration, see the hottest places in France in October, and our research on where’s hot in Europe in October.\n\nMarrakech, Morocco\n\nAverage temperature in October: 28ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 9\n\nFlying time from UK: 3 hours 30 mins\n\nIf you want a short flight, hot weather and near guaranteed sunshine, Morocco is an absolute winner. Marrakech offers dry desert sunshine, perfect for sightseeing and shopping as well as sunbathing, and you can stay at a palatial riad for a bargain price. It’s a good time of year to explore – head to the beaches of Essaouira, take a desert tour and cool off in the beautiful, tranquil Atlas Mountains.\n\nAlso consider: the riches of ancient Egypt. In Cairo where you can expect highs of 29°C, falling at night to 18°C. Flying time from the UK is five hours.\n\nThe Gambia\n\nAverage temperature in October: 32ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nFlying time from UK: 6 hours\n\nThe Gambia is only a six-hour direct flight from London or Manchester and makes for one of the best-value beach holidays in October. This small West African country has friendly English-speaking people and a good range of accommodation including my personal favourite, the Kombo Beach Hotel. See the latest special offers.\n\nAlso consider: Jordan (25°C) for sightseeing and desert adventures. If you’ve never visited the rock-carved city of Petra, this is a great month to experience it, but there’s so much more to see including Jerash, the Dead Sea and the desert scapes of Wadi Rum. Check out this Splendours of Jordan 8-day tour.\n\nDubai, UAE\n\nAverage temperature in October: 36ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 10\n\nFlying time from UK: 7 hours\n\nIn the Arabian Gulf, hot weather in October is as good as guaranteed. There are four main options: Dubai, Oman, Qatar and Abu Dhabi. Dubai is firmly established for its iconic hotels including the Burj Al Arab, exciting restaurant scene and Atlantis the Palm, home to the Aquaventure Waterpark. Abu Dhabi is catching up fast with stunning hotels, glamorous shopping malls and Yas Island, home to Waterworld, a Formula 1 track and the world’s fastest roller coaster. My personal favourite is Oman, the best choice if you want an authentic experience of old Arabia.\n\nTaormina, Sicily\n\nAverage temperature in October: 23ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 8\n\nFlying time from UK: 3 hours 10 mins\n\nSicily is a gorgeous destination in October because it’s not just about beaches (though these are lovely). With lots of sunshine and temperatures around 23°C, conditions are perfect for renting a car and visiting the medieval port of Syracuse and the charming town of Taormina, set against the backdrop of Mount Etna. Check out these lovely quirky places to stay. See my guide to the hottest places in Sicily in October.\n\nAlso consider: Puglia near the southern tip of Italy, which will be uncrowded in October, as most Italians take their holidays in August.\n\nKalkan, Turkey\n\nAverage temperature in October: 25ºC\n\nHours of daily sunshine: 9\n\nFlying time from UK: 4 hours (to Dalaman)\n\nTurkey is a good option: it’s warm in October and relatively cheap because the Turkish Lira has fallen sharply against Sterling. Temperatures on the Aegean Coast stay comfortably in the mid-20s. If you want a classy quiet resort with lovely local restaurants head to the charming resorts of Kalkan or Fethiye.\n\nAlso consider: a gulet cruise along the dazzling Turquoise Coast. See more holiday ideas in Turkey and my guide to the hottest places in Turkey in October.\n\nLong haul ideas in October\n\nOctober is a good time to visit Mauritius. The island is home to many world-class luxury hotels, and the climate is perfect: temperatures of around 27°C with eight hours of daily sun.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to see the Autumn Colours in New England, or take one of the world’s most scenic road trips on the Pacific Coast Highway in California. If you feel adventurous, how about a two-week motorhome tour visiting the spectacular National Parks of Utah, or travel from New York to Toronto by Rail.\n\nIn South America, Brazil sees the start of summer with sun and samba in Rio de Janeiro, which you can combine with the pristine castaway beaches and rainforests of Fernando de Noronha.\n\nFor a real adventure, head to Argentina where you can watch (or learn) tango amid the faded elegance of Buenos Aires, taste wines at vineyards in Mendoza and stay on a working ranch in the pampas and ride with Gauchos. For all South American adventures, we recommend on-the-ground specialists, Dehouche.\n\nOctober is generally a good time to visit Africa, particularly if you’re looking to combine safari and beach. Kenya is the classic destination where you can start with the Big Five in the Masai Mara followed by some lazy days on the Indian Ocean coast, perhaps at Hemingways Watamu. Coastal temperatures typically reach 30°C.\n\nThe dry season is starting in the Maldives, where you can expect temperatures of 29°C and seven hours of sunshine – the islands get genuinely hot in October. See more detailed weather info. If you love nature, but also crave some pampering, take a look at Madagascar which has fabulous beaches and unique nature experiences.\n\nOctober is also an excellent time of year to visit Sri Lanka. It’s just coming up to the high season but still at low season prices. Rather than choose between a beach holiday and a tour, combine the two: spend a week visiting Buddhist temples, sacred rocks, national parks and an elephant orphanage, then unwind with a few days on the coast. There are some stunning boutique hotels and eco resorts,\n\nFirst-time visitors to India should head for the Golden Triangle in the royal state of Rajasthan – Delhi, Agra and Jaipur – temperatures are high at around 33°C but low humidity makes the weather feel comfortable. For something slower-paced, try this Treasures of Southern India tour in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. See a selection of private tours in India (with chauffeur and English-speaking guide) and small group tours.\n\nFor a good value beach holiday with guaranteed hot weather, it’s hard to top Mexico, particularly if you stay in one of these all-inclusive resorts. If you want a lively, fun and action-packed resort, check out the Hard Rock Hotel Riviera Maya.\n\nOctober is the dry season in Botswana, making it a prime time for big game spotting – the lack of rain means that animals gather around watering holes, with guaranteed sightings. The Chobe and Khwai River region has the highest concentration of elephants and lions in Africa.\n\nIt’s spring time in South Africa where Cape Town is a very pleasant 22°C. In the east, Johannesburg and Durban are in the high 20s. This is a wonderful time of year to visit Kruger National Park. We recommend this classic Cape Town, Winelands and Kruger safari adventure. See the hottest places in South Africa in October.\n\nThe Caribbean in October\n\nOctober marks the tail end of the Caribbean hurricane season, but this can still be an excellent time to visit, and it’s good value. Also, many islands lie south of the hurricane belt including Barbados, St Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Dutch island of Curaçao. Find more details about the Caribbean weather in October.\n\nHottest holiday destinations in October\n\nDestination Average temperature Average hours of sun Monthly rainfall (mm) Dubai 36°C 10 hours 0 mm The Gambia 32°C 8 hours 2 mm Marrakech 28°C 8 hours 20 mm Maldives 28°C 7 hours 218 mm Cancun, Mexico 28°C 7 hours 113 mm Seville, Spain 27°C 8 hours 48 mm Kos, Greece 25°C 9 hours 57 mm Kalkan, Turkey 25°C 9 hours 120 mm Mauritius 25°C 8 hours 64 mm Nairobi, Kenya 24°C 8 hours 79 mm Taormina, Sicily 23°C 8 hours 100 mm The Azores 23°C 5 hours 147 mm Corsica, France 22°C 8 hours 89 mm Cape Town 19°C 10 hours 71 mm\n\nWhat are the hottest places in October?\n\nIn terms of holiday destinations, Dubai (36ºC) is the hottest place in October with an average 10 hours of daily sunshine and zero rainfall.
