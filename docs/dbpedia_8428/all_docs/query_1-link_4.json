        "text": "It's hard to predict the weather a couple of weeks out. It's not a given that it will rain a lot. I find London relatively dry, compared to west of Scotland where I'm originally from. Your temperature estimates sound about right. I'd expect a bit of everything within the course of a day. Remember, the British Isles is very much a marine climate. This time of year Atlantic weather systems can blast through, or linger a bit longer. It just depends.\n\nI left London for Scotland this morning. It's wet and windy here, but autumn (fall) definitely arrived in London yesterday after a spell of warm and dry weather.\n\nThe weather could do absolutely anything, right up to the Great Storm of 1987. The one most unlikely thing to have is snow.\n\nA few days ago there was awful rain in Devon and Somerset, and today I've been a drowned rat in Yorkshire- where there has been extensive flooding, one railway line under flood watch due to possible damage, and the West Coast main railway line closed today twice- very early morning before 7am due to overhead line damage in Scotland, and early evening in Lancashire due to a fallen tree.\n\nYou can never tell where such weather systems can hit- that could have been London, not Yorkshire or Devon.\n\nEqually it could be warm and sunny.\n\nBe prepared for almost anything. A reliable forecast does not usually extend out for more than 3 or 4 days.\n\nMy experience is that rain comes and goes in London and is usually not in the form of a heavy downpour, but one leaves one's hotel room without a rain jacket or rain coat and umbrella at one's peril. It is not fun to get soaked to the skin, especially not with the cool temperatures you may encounter on an overcast October day in London. The city's too large to head out unencumbered, with the plan to return to the hotel for rain gear later if it's needed.\n\nRather than basing my packing on averages, I look at 5 years' worth of actual, historical, day-by-day weather statistics on timeanddate.com:\n\nLondon weather October 2022\n\nJust looking at last year's data, you can see that it usually got up into the low to mid-60s (F), but not much before noon, and the temperature dropped rapidly after 6 PM.\n\nUse the pull-down box at the right, above the graph, to change the month and year displayed. Use the Search box at the upper right to change the location.\n\nI normally travel with just a rain jacket since a raincoat is bulky and wouldn't fit in my suitcase on warm, dry hotel-change days. On this year's Feb/Mar trip to Rome/Naples/Salerno with only 4 total hotel stays as opposed to my usual 20 to 30, I decided to take a lightweight, unlined raincoat. I figured it wouldn't be a major burden on that trip and I could shove it into my tote bag if I needed to when shifting hotels. At the last minute, I added my rain jacket to the suitcase because I didn't want to have to carry a full-length coat around with me, day after day, in case it rained.\n\nIn the end, on that particular trip, the combination was worthwhile. On days when rain was unlikely, I either wore the jacket (it was very cool before noon, and there was some rain on quite a few days) or carried it with me, tied around my waist. On days when significant rain seemed likely, I wore the raincoat--and was sometimes very glad to have it. It meant I didn't feel confined to my hotel room during really wet periods.\n\nI wouldn't recommend that type of duplication to a carry-on traveler or to someone changing hotels frequently, but I'd do it again for an off-season, mostly-stay-put trip.\n\nVAP\n\nWe wuld love to have rain here at home. We are in a massive drought although we finally had some rain last week, the first time in four months.\n\nI am retired and I do not go out when severe weather is predicted. We have torrential rains in Austin, like monsoons.\n\nWhen heavy rain is predicted, we stock up on food and some stock up on batteries etc. You stock up and hunker down.\n\nAs said, I do not go anywhere by choice but I have had doctor's appointments at times and a few months ago got soaked trying to get home.\n\nI do not drive and take the bus.\n\nThank you for the link\n\nacraven\n\nThanks for the link . I will keep checking as I get closer to my trip\n\nI am going to wear my raincoat to the airport and while getting on the plane. Once I get on the plane, I will take it off, roll it up and put it behind my back for support.\n\nI agree that it is not fun to get soaked. It happened to me a few months ago trying to get home after a doctor's appointment. I was so wet when I got home that I had to peel the wet clothes off of me.\n\nI travel very light bringing one rolling bag, a backpack and a sling bag. I believe that I will have to put my sling bag into the backpack because I do not check my rolling bag.\n\nI think my long raincoat will work well for different weather condition. I will also bring one sweater which I will also wear to the airport.\n\nisn31c\n\nI have a friend who says that the best job is the person reporting the weather because you can predict rain about 50% and or sun about 50% and always be right\n\nWe have very unpredictable weather in CentralTexas. The only thing that you can count on is that it is going to be hot for over 4 months of the year. The question always is \"just how hot\". This past summer has been brutal and we are still there. Today was in the mid to high 90's but down from 109. It is actually feeling cool to us who weathered the heat.\n\nAnd we have torrential rains at time and freezes in the winter."
