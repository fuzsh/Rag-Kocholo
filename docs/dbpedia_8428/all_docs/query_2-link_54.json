        "text": "What to expect when you visit London in November – weather, what to see and do, what to pack, and answers to frequently asked questions!\n\nThinking of heading to London in November? Weather-wise, is this a good idea? If you’re planning a late autumn visit to the UK capital, then this guide is for you.\n\nCovered in this article are events in London in November, and how they tie in with fall and the start of the festive season. We also take a look at average temperatures and rainfall levels, what to wear, hours of daylight, and more.\n\nWhether you’re wondering what’s on in London in November or are more concerned with how early it gets dark and how cold it might be, read on. Covering all you need to know as well as frequently asked questions, this is the complete guide to visiting London in November.\n\nVisiting London in November | What to Expect\n\nWeather\n\nThe climate in London in November is cold, but not normally too extreme. You can expect around 10 days of rain, and fairly long hours of darkness, as the winter solstice approaches. While it’s chilly, it’s warmer than it is during the following three months.\n\nAverage high: 12°C / 54°F\n\nAverage low: 7°C / 45°F\n\nAverage days of rain: 10\n\nAs you can see, the weather in London in November isn’t too extreme. With averages around the 9°C to 10°C mark (48°F to 50°F), it’s not warm, but it’s not too chilly, either. November is pretty much on a par with March in terms of temperature, though there are more hours of darkness, and slightly more rain.\n\nBy November, the weather will have turned, though, so it will feel more wintry than summery. This change usually occurs sometime during the preceding month of October.\n\nMild weather\n\nThough London is cold in November, sub-zero temperatures (in celsius) are unusual. It can, very occasionally, be chilly enough for snow – but that’s not the norm. Extremes and major weather events are almost unheard of, though flooding can happen after heavy rain.\n\nChangeable weather\n\nThe weather can change very quickly in London and the rest of the UK, due to the coastal, maritime climate. After sunrise, there might be a clear, sunny morning, but by the afternoon it could be wet and windy. And vice versa! Being prepared by layering, and wearing or carrying a waterproof jacket, is the key to coping with the changes.\n\nWet weather\n\nYou can expect rain on 10 days out of 30 during November – so every third day. But in reality, the weather is often wet or dry for days at a time, rather than spread out through the month. Whether you have dry, mild weather, or it’s wet and cold, depends on luck rather than anything else!\n\nDaylight hours\n\nDuring November, the sun rises between 7.05am and 7.35am in London. Sunset is between 5.30pm and 5.10pm. Therefore you’ll have around 10 daylight hours per day in November, with longer at the start and less by the end of the month.\n\nSunrise: Between about 07:05 and 07:35\n\nSunset: Between about 17:30 and 17:10\n\nSunset\n\nDuring the early days of November, sunset is at about 5.30pm. By the end, the sun sets at about 5.10pm.\n\nSunrise\n\nIn early November, sunrise is at about 7.05am, reaching 7.35am by the end of the month.\n\nWhat to pack\n\nFor late autumn in London, a warm and waterproof jacket is a top priority. You should also pack a compact umbrella, and a tough yet comfortable pair of waterproof walking shoes or boots. Also bring several sweaters to layer on top of t-shirts, plus long-legged trousers and/or jeans.\n\nBy November, it’s getting pretty chilly. It will be colder during the evenings, and especially at night. As December approaches, the weather will feel more wintry. Here’s what to wear in London during November.\n\nWhatever the November temperature in London, you’ll walk a lot during your visit. Bringing a pair of comfortable walking shoes, for all-day wear, is thus essential. Pack at least one pair of alternative footwear, too, so your feet can take a break. Waterproof boots are ideal for the November weather.\n\nOuterwear\n\nBy November, a warm, waterproof jacket shouldn’t be too much. Layering is key, so add a sweater over a t-shirt when setting out in the mornings, or bring one in your daypack. Choosing a daypack with space for extra layers is essential.\n\nLayering\n\nFast-drying active trousers are ideal during November. Jeans are best left for the evenings, as they can become uncomfortable when it’s wet – and take ages to dry out. A t-shirt with a sweater on top is perfect for late autumn in London – plus a warm, waterproof jacket.\n\nEssentials\n\nA warm and waterproof jacket, a comfortable daypack with space for extra layers and a packable umbrella are very useful when it comes to coping with London’s autumn weather.\n\nLondon in November FAQs\n\nIs November a good time to visit London?\n\nIn London, low season is during September to November, and also from January to April. This is a great time of year to avoid the late spring, summer, and festive season crowds.\n\nDuring November, average temperatures are between 7°C (45°F) and 12°C (54°F), with around 10 days of rain on average. So it’s cold and can be wet, but not extremely so.\n\nDo I need a coat in London in November?\n\nA warm, waterproof jacket is enough for November in London, rather than your heaviest winter coat. Earlier in the month in particular, it isn’t usually extremely cold.\n\nLayering with a sweater under a lighter jacket is best, as you can adjust your clothing to suit the conditions and throughout the day.\n\nWhat happens in London in November?\n\nIn November, everyone and everywhere in London starts gearing up for the festive season. Christmas lights are switched on, and Christmas markets all over the capital begin trading. This generally happens late in the month.\n\nEarlier, Guy Fawkes, or Bonfire Night, takes place on 5th November, when fireworks light up the night skies to commemorate the failed gunpowder plot, which was an attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605.\n\nIs London cheap in November?\n\nAs November is the low season in London, it’s a relatively pocket-friendly time to be in this expensive city. Flights tend to be cheaper than during the peak seasons of summer and December.\n\nHotel room rates are also often discounted during November, to attract more visitors.\n\nTop Things to Do in London in November\n\nLooking for November events in London? Here are some things to do in late autumn.\n\nJoin the Bonfire Night celebrations\n\nWhen: 5th November\n\nWhere: across the city\n\nClosest tube: varies\n\nGuy Fawkes Day or Night, Fireworks Night, or Bonfire Night takes place on 5th November every year. It means there are bonfires burning and fireworks displays all over the city. It’s a British tradition marking the date in 1605, when Guy Fawkes attempted to assassinate the King by blowing up Parliament.\n\nExperience Hogwarts in the Snow\n\nWhen: mid November onwards\n\nWhere: Harry Potter studios\n\nClosest train: Watford Junction\n\nWitness all the wintry splendour of the wizarding world from mid-November onwards by doing the Warner Bros. studio tour in Hertfordshire, north of London. It’s the most magical time of the year. Find out more in this complete guide to visiting Harry Potter world from London.\n\nSee a West End show\n\nWhen: throughout November\n\nWhere: Theatreland\n\nClosest tube: Charing Cross, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, or Tottenham Court Road (depending on theatre)\n\nBooking tickets for London shows in November, rather than December, often means better and cheaper seats. Snap up your tickets in advance, though, as popular shows do sell out. Theatreland is in the heart of London, so it’s easy to make a night of it by following your show with dinner and drinks.\n\nEnjoy Christmas in November\n\nWhen: mid to late November\n\nWhere: across the city\n\nClosest tube: varies\n\nThe festive season kicks off early in London. In November, Christmas lights all over the city are switched on, and the Christmas markets open up for business. It’s the ideal time to enjoy that festive feeling – without the December crowds.\n\nHow will you enjoy London in November?\n\nIf you want to avoid the three coldest months – and the festive crowds – then November can be a great time to visit London. At the start of the month there’s the very British tradition of celebrating Bonfire Night, and by the end the festive season is in full swing.\n\nFor London in November, be prepared for mild to cold temperatures, and, as always in the UK, rain. Then you can make the most of what this relatively peaceful time in the UK capital has to offer!\n\nPlan your trip to London whatever the month or season with our guides"
