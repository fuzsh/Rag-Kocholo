        "text": "Weather\n\nNovember straddles fall and winter in the UK. Early in the month, especially in the south, fall colors will still be on display. However, northern and mountainous areas, such as Scotland, will have some snow. And if not snow, rain and wind, particularly along the coasts. Expect average temperatures to span between 45°F (7°C) and 54°F (12°C) in London, 37°F (3°C) and 48°F (9°C) in Edinburgh, 41°F (5°C) and 52°F (11°C) in Belfast, and 43°F (6°C) and 52°F (11°C) in Cardiff.\n\nWhile temperatures won't be as cold as later in the winter, the days are increasingly short. Edinburgh as an example only receives 7.5 hours of daylight by month's end.\n\nCrowds & Costs\n\nNovember is the low season for travel to and within the UK. There are no major school vacations, so domestic travelers aren't really out and about, and the gloomy weather often puts off international visitors. That said, if you get lucky with the weather this can be a wonderfully peaceful month⁠ outside of the cities—the roads are empty and you’ll have the trails to yourself. Alternatively, if you're after a cozy city break, you might find a deal on flights and accommodation in the pre-Christmas lull to lively cities like London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, and elsewhere.\n\nIt is important to note, that some popular tourist attractions, including castles, manors, distilleries, boat tours, and even some hotels and restaurants, may close for the low season. Check the hours of operation in advance.\n\nWhere to Go\n\nGuy Fawke's Night is celebrated, particularly in England, on November 5. The day commemorates a failed plot to assassinate King James I in 1605, but the most important point for would-be visitors to know is that the holiday is celebrated with fireworks displays and bonfires. Fireworks shows are held around the country (including in backyards). Still, London is a particularly good place to be on November 5: Wimbledon Park, Chiswick Park, and Battersea Park are three of many places you can watch a great pyrotechnic show.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom's other capitals and larger cities are good places to be. Belfast has a recent history worth joining a Black Cab Tour for, great restaurants, the covered St George's Market, and attractions like the Belfast Castle and Ulster Museum. Cardiff has a number of seasonal fairs and markets, including the Cardiff Winter Wonderland and across Wales, there's the Victorian Christmas Fair held in the 13th-century staterooms and courtyard of Picton Castle. And Glasgow has its Whisky Fest where you take part in tastings, learn about Scotch whisky from local experts and enjoy live music.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nGeneral sightseeing at cultural and historic attractions is best in November. The large cities of London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and Glasgow are all great choices for November travel. You can enjoy the many indoor galleries, museums, and other historic and cultural attractions in these cities. London has St. Paul's Cathedral, Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, and Hampton Court Palace to name a few noteworthy sights. Then there's walking the Royal Mile to Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh and Kelvingrove Art Gallery And Museum in Glasgow.\n\nIn Cardiff, see fine arts and dinosaurs at the National Museum, book tickets to listen to the Welsh national orchestra or catch an opera performance at the Millennium Centre, or watch rugby at the Principality Stadium. Belfast too has its castle and the Ulster Museum, highlighting 9,000 years of history, and Titanic Belfast. As the Titanic was designed, built, and launched just outside the museum, you might like to check out the slipways before heading inside.\n\nEvents in November\n\nBelfast International Arts Festival, Northern Ireland. In early November as well as late October, a fabulous extravaganza of performing and visual arts events over two weeks in Belfast.\n\nGuy Fawke's Night, UK-wide. A centuries-old holiday celebrated with fireworks and bonfires, especially in England, on November 5.\n\nArmistice Day, UK-wide. November 11 is a day of remembrance for fallen WWI soldiers. You may see people wearing red paper poppies pinned to their clothing. A two-minute silence is held nationwide at 11 am.\n\nSt. Andrew's Day, Scotland. November 30 is Scotland's national holiday and is observed as a public holiday.\n\nCardiff Christmas Market, Cardiff, Wales. Cardiff is in full festive swing with crafts, mulled wine, and fairy lights at this Christmas market on St John Street, Working Street, Trinity Street, and the Hayes. It runs from mid-November to December 23.\n\nTraveling to the UK in November? Check out these great itineraries\n\nScenic Scotland: Edinburgh, Inverness & Skye - 7 Days.
