        "text": "Weather warnings are in place across the UK as temperatures plunged below freezing overnight.\n\nSnow hit parts of London on Friday and the icy conditions are forecast to continue throughout the weekend. It comes after temperatures plunged to their lowest since March.\n\nThe Met Office has issued yellow warnings through Saturday morning for the northern coast and southwest of Scotland, as well as southwest and the eastern coast of England.\n\nConditions could affect some roads and railways, forecasters said, and slippery surfaces would increase the risk of injury for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nThe mercury approached minus 10C in some places overnight, with Tulloch Bridge and Eskdalemuir in Scotland reaching minus 8C.\n\nTemperatures are tipped to continue to fall over the weekend, with several sporting events cancelled amid snowfall and icy conditions.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said it will be minus 3C or minus 4C for many towns and cities on Saturday.\n\nThere would be “snow showers” across southwestern Scotland mainly falling over the high ground and lower level areas in the Lake District, Ms Shuttleworth said.\n\n“Elsewhere, though we’ll see the mist and fog slowly clear, it could remain quite murky for a lot of the morning across central and eastern areas,” she said.\n\n“The best sunshine will be across northern areas of Scotland, but further south and west, you can see things starting to change a little bit (by Saturday afternoon) with a greater risk of some showers.”\n\nShe said as winds shifted to more south-westerly, temperatures would slowly rise, feeling a little less cold in the southwest.\n\n“Elsewhere, though still feeling bitterly cold, not much above freezing,” she added.\n\n“Those showers in the southwest then do push further inland throughout Saturday night, and as they bump into the colder air, they could bring some snow to parts of Wales and central areas such as the Peak District, for example.”\n\nSnowfall in London\n\nThe first sightings of snowflakes were reported at 11am Friday across the capital, from West Hampstead to the City of London.\n\nMarco Petagna, a senior meteorologist at the Met Office, said temperatures in Cumbria were the coldest on record nationwide since March.\n\n“The recorded -9.4C in Cumbria was the coldest temperature since March 15, when -9.9C was recorded in Tyndrum, Scotland,” he said on Friday.\n\n“Last time there was ‘lying snow’ in the South West was Nov 14 2019, and in Cornwall this was back in November 2010.”\n\nMr Petagna added that as low pressure arrived through Sunday and moved from west to east, showers could turn to sleet and snow in places.\n\nTom Morgan, also a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “There’s some threat of significant snow on Monday.\n\n“We could see several centimetres of snow in south Wales and parts of central and southern England. Monday is the most likely day for widespread disruption,” he added.\n\nNicola Maxey, a Met Office spokesman said: “Colder conditions are now covering all areas of the UK and we will see little change as we go into the weekend.\n\n“Daytime temperatures will be rooted in single figures and overnight temperatures falling well below freezing in many places.\n\n“We will continue to see wintry showers at times and where these showers fall as rain there is a risk of icy patches forming.”\n\nA Guide Dog charity put out guidance on keeping dogs safe in cold weather from hypothermia, frostbite, antifreeze poisoning, and dehydration in freezing temperatures.\n\nDog owners are urged to keep their pets warm and dry, provide plenty of water, stay visible by using a light-up collar on walks and avoid frozen water.\n\nThe charity said: “If your dog has short hair, low levels of body fat or is older, a dog coat can keep them toasty on chilly days. Make sure your dog’s coat fits well and doesn’t restrict their movement.”\n\nThe London Fire Brigade also issued a warning on X, formally known as Twitter, posting: “If you’re at home, be careful about how you choose to keep yourself and those around you warm.\n\n“If you’re out and about, take extra care as conditions could be icy and keep well away from water.”\n\nFire stations in the capital have been assisting with HandsOn’s WrapUp London campaign, which collects second-hand warm coats and shares them directly with frontline charities supporting people through cold conditions this winter.\n\nCollections are running from Nov 7 to Dec 3, and coats can be taken to one of more than 40 drop-off points across the city.\n\nDespite plummeting temperatures this weekend, this year has joined 2021 and 2022 as one of the warmest autumns on record in the UK, figures show.\n\nThe mean temperature for the past three months was 10.76C, according to provisional data from the Met Office.\n\nThis is high enough to rank it as the UK’s sixth warmest autumn since records began in 1884, slightly below last year (11.05C) and 2021 (10.84C).\n\nThe season has seen sharp extremes in weather, including a heatwave in early September with temperatures peaking above 30C, another hot spell in October and a cold snap at the very end of November.\n\nAll of the UK’s top six warmest autumns have occurred this century, with eight of the top 10."
