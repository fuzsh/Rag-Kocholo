        "text": "October might just be the best month for travel. Not convinced? Hear us out. The weather in the UK is starting to get dreary, making an escape to the sunshine all the more appealing. It’s outside of the school holidays, so you don’t need to worry about rocketing prices or squabbling kids dive-bombing into the hotel pool. And there are plenty of places within easy reach – or not so easy reach – of the UK where you can enjoy a welcome dose of Vitamin D.\n\nIf you’re only wanting to travel short-haul, then Europe has a handful of warm destinations in October, particularly the further south you get. The picturesque and fashionable region of Puglia, in the south-west of Italy (think of it as the heel of the boot), has an average daily temperature of 21 degrees, which is more than enough for sitting outside with an Aperol Spritz and a bowl of pasta. Meanwhile, Malta, Cyprus and the Greek Islands are also reliably hot, as well as the Canary Islands, with La Gomera a fun option if you’re bored of Tenerife and Lanzarote.\n\nWilling to up the budget and go long-haul? Then there are a plethora of glamorous white-sand options and city breaks for you. The Maldives, of course, is the dream, whether you’re honeymooning or not. If you want somewhere just as chic but a little easier to reach, then check out Mauritius, its Indian Ocean neighbour. Bali is well-known for its beautiful scenery, beach clubs and general good life vibes, or what about Cuba, with its fascinating history, and rum cocktails? See also: Jamaica.\n\nAnd then there’s always good old reliable Dubai, where you can play spot-the-ex-Love Islander bingo from your sun lounger.\n\nWhere is hot in October? GLAMOUR's top five destinations at a glance:\n\nPuglia, Italy\n\nMauritius, East Africa\n\nAlgarve, Portugal\n\nBali, Indonesia\n\nMarrakech, Morocco\n\n1. Puglia, Italy\n\nWhile the cities of Rome, Florence and Venice will still be teeming with tourists in October, all taking advantage of the slightly cooler temperatures, the southern region of Puglia has quietened down. The mild temperatures mean you can enjoy everything Puglia has to offer – whether that’s sunbathing, exploring the beautiful towns (Alberobello, with its signature dome-shaped trulli buildings, is well worth checking out) or cycling through the countryside – without perishing in the summer heat, which can reach into the mid-30s. What’s more, it’s also a great opportunity to stay at some of the luxury five-star hotels beloved by the A-list, which will be offering shoulder season rates. Bonus: the sea is still warm enough for a dip, too.\n\nWhere to stay: Borgo Egnazia is the G.O.A.T. when it comes to where to stay in Puglia. After all, if it’s good enough for the Beckhams, it’s good enough for us. Family-friendly with multiple restaurants, pools and a private beach, it’s equidistant from both of the region’s airports, Bari and Brindisi, and is an ideal base for exploring all that Puglia has to offer.\n\nSave when you search for where is hot in October with these Booking.com discount codes.\n\n2. Mauritius\n\nThe very definition of tropical paradise, Mauritius is all verdant jungles, turquoise waters and white-sand beaches. Located 1,200 miles off the coast of Madagascar, slap bang in the middle of the Indian Ocean, it’s a vibrant melting pot of influences, including African, Chinese, Indian, French and Creole. Nowhere is this better reflected than in the cuisine, which is known for its rich variety of spice and flavour. Scuba-divers love the coral reefs (the largest protected reefs in the world), while October sees great waves for surfers. Elsewhere, you’ll find ample opportunities for topping up your tan, hiking, rum-tasting and even a spot of geology – the Seven Coloured Earths is definitely one for the ‘gram.\n\nWhere to stay: The One&Only Le Saint Géran is one of the island’s most historic and iconic hotels, and for good reason. With a secluded location on the northernmost tip of the island, it’s one of those pinch-me resorts where everything is exactly as you’d dream: multiple restaurants, infinity pools, cabanas, daybeds and a private beach. A bonus is the long drive from the airport means you’ll take in lots of the scenery en route, too.\n\nSave when you search for where is hot in October with these Expedia discount codes.\n\n3. Marrakech, Morocco\n\nJust under four hours away from London, Morocco's most popular tourist destination is ideal for a long-weekend city break with the added bonus of sunshine. Long popular with the style set, in the Seventies it was a mecca for rock stars and hippies like The Rolling Stones and Talitha Getty. More recently, it was the backdrop for Poppy Delevingne’s 2014 wedding, Madonna’s 60th and Rita Ora’s birthday bash. In October, the temperatures can reach 28 degrees, which make it popular for sun-seekers, but it’s also got plenty for culture-vultures too, including Jardin Majorelle, once the home of Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nWhere to stay: You’re spoiled for choice in Marrakech. For celebrity-spotting, we recommend El Fenn, the glamorous five-star owned by Vanessa Branson (sisterof Richard), which Madonna chose as the base for her lavish birthday celebrations. With just 41 vibrantly decorated bedrooms and a gorgeous roof terrace, if you are staying at the same time as Gwyneth Paltrow or Gwen Stefani (both spotted here before) then you’ll probably end up sitting next to them at some point. Meanwhile, the stunning La Mamounia, with its lush gardens, was the scene of Poppy Delevingne's 2014 wedding.\n\n4. Dubai\n\nLook, there’s a reason why it’s a mecca for influencers with swimwear sponsorships. Dubai is hot – and we mean HOT – all year round. October is one of the warmest times of year, with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees on occasion, so pack the factor 50. An adult playground of pool bars, beach clubs, fine dining and tax-free shopping, it’s all about seeing and being seen, with the dress code very much being “glam”.\n\nWhere to stay: Why not splash out on a twin-stay at the One&Only Royal Mirage and One&Only The Palm, for the best of both worlds? While the Royal Mirage is all palatial splendour and tropical gardens, The Palm is its flashier sibling located on Dubai’s famous man-made shoreline. Both offer extra-mile flourishes – including frozen fruit as a poolside snack and even a sunglasses cleaning service.\n\nSave when you search for where is hot in October with these TUI promo codes.\n\n5. Bodrum, Turkey\n\nHot enough to sunbathe, but not so hot it’s uncomfortable, is our love language. That’s the case for the Turkish resort of Bodrum, which basks in the mid-20s in October. Dubbed the Turkish Riviera, this strip of coastline is known for being a playground for the super-rich, who dock their yachts here in the summer. Yet despite the Michelin-star restaurants and boujee bars, there’s plenty of the “authentic” Turkey to see here too, with cute family-run tavernas serving humus, stuffed vine leaves and baklava, washed down with raki – the Turkish equivalent of ouzo.\n\nWhere to stay:\n\nNamed after the Turkish word for mermaid, Susona Bodrum LXR Hotels & Resorts is just like a siren’s song. This five-star boutique hotel boasts a stunning seafront location, complete with infinity pool, spa, and vibrant beach club.\n\n6. Hvar, Croatia\n\nHvar is one of Europe’s sunniest islands, averaging 195 hours of sunshine in October and temperatures between 22°C – 28°C. Known as ‘the queen’ of the Dalmatian coast thanks to its natural beauty, it’s home to pebble beaches, lavender fields, pine-needle forests and a historic harbour, with cobblestone alleyways and a medieval castle perched on a hilltop. Aside from swimming and boat trips, there are also numerous vineyards to visit – the local grape is Malvazija, a full-bodied white.\n\nWhere to stay: Maslina Resort is an architectural buff's dream, comprising a series of low-lying, slant-roofed buildings buried in the landscape. This sense of being at one with nature continues at the spa, which is Instagram-ready, offering a whole host of detoxing and relaxing treatments perfect for recharging you ahead of the final slog towards Christmas.\n\n7. Bali, Indonesia\n\nGet your Eat, Pray, Love on with a trip to Bali. An Instagrammer’s paradise for good reason, it’s a magic mix of beautiful beaches, lush tropical rainforests, cool beach clubs, lively nightlife and amazing healthy food. October is just at the end of the dry season, so you get all the benefits of the weather with less crowds. Our dream itinerary takes in the party scene of Seminyak, the rice fields in Ubud and the monkey forest. If you can squeeze in a trip to the Gili Islands during your stay, you’ll be rewarded for the effort – this tiny trio are where those famous sunset swing pictures are taken, with no cars allowed, just horse and cart. Like we said, magic.\n\nWhere to stay: We like the Avani Seminyak Bali Resort, which is just a hop skip away from Seminyak’s bustling beach club scene. For a more wellness-focused stay, check into the Spa Village Resort in Tembok.\n\n8. Costa Smeralda, Sardinia\n\nWhy we love it: Prince Aga Khan famously fell in love with Costa Smeralda in the sixties, and today this hidden gem in the Northern coast of Sardinia is still enchanting travellers today, with its picture-perfect turquoise waters and golden sand beaches. A celebrity favourite, with regulars including Rihanna, Elton John and the Obamas, Costa Smeralda may just be the European destination to pick if you want to holiday like a celeb this October.\n\nWhere to stay: There’s no shortage of luxury hotels in this gorgeous Sardinian town, from the timeless Cala di Volpe, the beachfront Hotel Romazzino or the family-friendly Hotel Pitrizza.\n\n9. Lisbon, Portugal\n\nLisbon is enjoying a real moment. Long-overlooked as a city break destination, the Portuguese capital has rightfully become a favourite amongst discerning travellers who flock here for its gorgeous architecture, rich cultural history, amazing food and of course, the sunshine. From the Time Out food market to the historic trams (route 28 is the most famous), there’s so much to see and do. Just be aware, this is the so-called “city of seven hills” so pack your comfiest trainers.\n\nWhere to stay:\n\nWe are partial to the Flora Chiado Apartments, a stylish blend of modern and traditional local decor, with minimalist furniture and Portuguese tiles. It’s in a particularly pretty part of town, with quaint bookshops, stylish bars and Michelin stars on your doorstep.\n\n10. Malta\n\nIn Malta, you’re never more than 15 minutes away from the sea, which in October, will still be warm after basking in the heat of a long Mediterranean summer. A melting pot of cultures thanks to the various invaders who called it home over the past centuries, its capital Valletta competes with the likes of Barcelona and Rome for its foodie scene, with a sprinkling of Michelin stars, rustic family-run tavernas and ample bars. Mdina, the ancient walled city, is well worth a day-trip, as is Gozo, the island to the north.\n\nWhere to stay: The creme de la creme of Valletta hotels is the new-ish Iniala Harbour House. Think Juliet balconies overlooking the harbour, a decadent welcome platter of charcuterie, a subterranean spa and a twice Michelin-starred rooftop restaurant, ION, by Simon Rogan.\n\n11. La Gomera\n\nWe don’t know about you, but we’ve got Lanzarote/Tenerife/Fuerteventura/Gran Canaria fatigue. So did you know that there’s actually another Canary island? (There are actually three more). Completely untouched by tourism, largely due to its slight inaccessibility (there are no direct UK flights, you have to get a ferry from Tenerife), La Gomera is for the adventurous traveller with a love of the outdoors and outdoor pursuits, with ample hiking, cycling and climbing opps amidst its dramatic landscape. One of those, “in-the-know” destinations that you can endlessly boast to your friends about.\n\nWhere to stay: Unsurprisingly, there are limited hotel options, with the best being Parador de La Gomera, with its tiled walls and swimming pool views across to Tenerife.\n\n12. Cuba\n\nIt’s easy to see why Cuba is a bucket-list destination for so many people. Practically a time-capsule to the culture of the 1950s – when Fidel Castro cut it off from the outside world – it not only has a fascinating history, but also a vibrant culture, from the infamous nightlife scene to the colourful vintage convertibles. Outside of Havana, there are also gorgeous beaches and tropical rainforests, and with the weather a pleasant 23 degrees in October, you can enjoy both.\n\nWhere to stay: Malecón 663 is one of the swankiest hotels in Havana, with just four individually designed rooms, a fabulous restaurant, lively bar and even a concept store! Extra points for the colourful, Instagrammable backdrops.\n\n13. Limassol, Cyprus\n\nIf you thought Cyprus was just Ayia Napa, think again – there’s more to the island than your A-level results holiday. The capital, Limassol, is a quintessentially Mediterranean city on the island’s Southern coast. Endless beachfronts and plenty of historical attractions — like the Cyprus Medieval Museum and the Prokymea (Molos) Sculpture Park — make this a well-balanced beach holiday destination. Not to mention, Limassol also has a bustling nightlife and foodie scene.\n\nWhere to stay: The Four Seasons Limassol has become shorthand for incredible luxury for a reason, and it’s no different here. With an unbeatable location on the seafront, five restaurants, and a truly mega spa, you might never even leave the hotel.\n\n14. Melbourne, Australia\n\nIf you’re up for going REALLY far away, then Australia’s second city is well worth the (24 hour) trip. Often voted one of the best places to live in the world, its charm lies in the fact that it’s got the beach, the River Yarra, and the city, all in one easy-to-navigate place. The brunch scene here is unreal, with Melbournians known for their coffee snobbery, and there are rooftop bars aplenty. With a cooler climate than Sydney, October is a great time to visit before it's summer in earnest. Fans of Neighbours can always visit Ramsay Street, too.\n\nWhere to stay: We love the QT Hotel, especially its rooftop bar, which is a mecca for hot Gen Zers on a Friday night after work. Decorated in a super-modern style, with neon lights, cheeky artworks and bright colours, it’s also big on Insta.\n\n15. Hoi An, Vietnam\n\nOctober signals the beginning of the low season in Vietnam and is the perfect time to avoid the crowds (and oppressive heat!). Trekking and cycling holidays are all the rage in Vietnam at this time of year, which is also the best time to visit the capital of Hanoi. Travel off the beaten path and visit Hôi An, a well-preserved ancient town and UNESCO World Heritage Site, still relatively undiscovered by the tourist hordes.\n\nWhere to stay: We like the Anantara Hoi An Resort, which is a luxury hideaway on the edge of the Bon river. The rooms are a blend of Asian and French colonial architecture and have oodles of charm.\n\n16. Maroma, Mexico\n\nMaroma is Cancun’s quieter, more laid back sibling. With average temperatures hitting a sweltering 30°C in October, Maroma easily makes it as one of our top choices for shoulder season travel. Located in the beautiful Riviera Maya and with stunning Caribbean views, Maroma is a world away from the spring breakers of Cancun, yet near enough to explore Mexico’s otherworldly Mayan ruins and cenotes.\n\nWhere to stay: Chablé Maroma has enviable beachfront locations right on Punta Maroma – offering luxury accommodations, experiences, and service befitting Maroma’s magical surroundings.\n\n17. Florida, USA\n\nGet that long-awaited trip to Disney World in now! It’s still warm in October, and you actually get less rain during the autumn than you do in the summer, making it a popular month to visit, so avoid half-term if possible. Towards the tail-end of the month you’ll also start to see Halloween-themed decorations popping up, with the US famously going big on the spooky holiday. As well as the theme parks, Florida also has lots of beautiful beaches, including Sarasota, Clearwater and Palm Beach. Just be on the loop out for Trumps at the latter.\n\nWhere to stay: Make day trips to the “happiest place in the world” as easy – not to mention as chic – as possible by staying at the Waldorf Astoria Orlando. As close as you can get to the parks without staying at a Disney-themed hotel (which, if you’re going for, no judgement here), it boasts endless pools and restaurants in lush surroundings.\n\n18. The Maldives\n\nOK, so the Maldives is usually reserved as a honeymoon destination, but there’s no reason why you can’t visit at another time too. As October is the shoulder season, when it’s still hot but partial to a downpour, it’s a really affordable time to go, and there’s something particularly magical about being in an infinity pool on your overwater villa while the rain pours down. Plus, a bit of patchy weather gives you plenty of time to indulge in a spa treatment or three as well.\n\nWhere to stay: Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, Huvafen Fushi is truly spectacular. Ticking all the Insta-shot boxes: multi-roomed suite on stilts, plunge pool, outdoor shower, steps to the ocean – it’s one of those pinch-me-can’t-believe-I’m-actually-here places.\n\n19. Kefalonia\n\nOctober is the end of the tourist season in Kefalonia, with cooler temperatures, the odd shower and far less busy beaches. A mix of pristine beaches, caves, mountains and beautiful fisherman villages, there’s plenty of places to make the most of the sunshine. It’s also well worth a visit to the island’s capital, Argostoli, where you can spot endangered loggerhead turtles swimming in the bay if you’re lucky.\n\nWhere to stay: The Kefalonia Grand Hotel is handily located in Argostoli, and just 15 minutes from the airport, making it the ultimate fly and flop. For something more remote, there’s the very serene F Zeen, which offers the opportunity for a bit of yoga, meditation, mountain hikes, you name it.\n\nWant more travel and hotel content?
