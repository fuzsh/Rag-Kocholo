London’s weather can be quite unpredictable, but May is a lovely time to visit the city. Read on as our team at Tourist England answers some of your frequently asked questions. We hope to see you in London soon!\n\nIs it Rainy in London in May?\n\nLondon gets about 55mm of rainfall on average in May. Typically, there are about 15 days of rain during the month, but many of these days will be showers which means they are quick bursts of rain that happen throughout the day. The weather in London can be famously unpredictable. May 2021 was unusually cold and rainy, whilst May 2020 was very mild.\n\nWhat will the weather be like in May 2022? Nobody knows for sure … the key is to make sure to bring a raincoat, umbrella, as well as some layers of clothing!\n\nIs it Cold in London in May?\n\nOnce again, the weather in London can be very unpredictable! Statistics show that the average temperature is 14 degrees celsius (57 Fahrenheit), with an average high of 17°C (63°F) and a low of 9°C (48°F). In reality, some years it can be quite warm and some years much cooler. Make sure to pack accordingly. Our rule of thumb is to never travel to London without some layers of clothing and waterproof gear. The weather is so unpredictable that talking about it obsessively is one of the British people’s favourite pastimes!\n\nIs May a Good Time to Visit London?\n\nYes! May is a lovely time to visit London. Springtime is when the flowers start to come into bloom and temperatures start to get warmer, especially during the second half of the month. The parks will be green and colourful. Towards the end of May is when the tourist season begins, so the beginning of the month is a little bit quieter."
