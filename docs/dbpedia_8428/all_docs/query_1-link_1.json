In London, the chance of a wet day over the course of October is increasing, starting the month at 27% and ending it at 31%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 32% on December 29, and its lowest chance is 20% on April 27.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during October in London is essentially constant, remaining about 2.1 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 3.7 inches or falling below 0.5 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 2.2 inches on October 20.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of October in London, the length of the day is rapidly decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 1 hour, 54 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 3 minutes, 48 seconds, and weekly decrease of 26 minutes, 36 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is October 31, with 9 hours, 41 minutes of daylight and the longest day is October 1, with 11 hours, 35 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in London is 7:44 AM on October 26 and the earliest sunrise is 58 minutes earlier at 6:45 AM on October 27.\n\nThe latest sunset is 6:37 PM on October 1 and the earliest sunset is 2 hours, 3 minutes earlier at 4:34 PM on October 31.\n\nDaylight saving time (DST) starts at 1:00 AM on October 27, 2024, shifting sunrise and sunset to be an hour later.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:42 AM and sets 16 hours, 39 minutes later, at 9:21 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:04 AM and sets 7 hours, 50 minutes later, at 3:53 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in October in London\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in October in LondonOct112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMSepNov00102020304000010102030\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for October 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in October in London\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in October in LondonOct112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMSepNovSep 32:56 AMSep 32:56 AMSep 183:35 AMSep 183:35 AMOct 27:50 PMOct 27:50 PMOct 1712:27 PMOct 1712:27 PMNov 112:48 PMNov 112:48 PMNov 159:29 PMNov 159:29 PM6:24 AM6:24 AM7:59 PM7:59 PM7:04 PM7:04 PM6:54 AM6:54 AM6:34 AM6:34 AM6:26 PM6:26 PM5:35 PM5:35 PM7:21 AM7:21 AM6:55 AM6:55 AM4:09 PM4:09 PM3:29 PM3:29 PM8:27 AM8:27 AM\n\nOct 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 2%5:24 AME6:17 PMW-11:54 AMS252,217 mi 2 0%6:34 AME6:26 PMW-12:32 PMS252,574 mi 3 0%7:43 AMESE6:36 PMWSW-1:11 PMS252,501 mi 4 3%8:54 AMESE6:47 PMWSW-1:51 PMS251,992 mi 5 7%10:07 AMESE7:01 PMWSW-2:34 PMS251,023 mi 6 13%11:22 AMSE7:20 PMSW-3:21 PMS249,556 mi 7 20%12:37 PMSE7:46 PMSW-4:11 PMS247,557 mi 8 29%1:48 PMSE8:23 PMSW-5:06 PMS245,012 mi 9 39%2:49 PMSE9:17 PMSW-6:03 PMS241,949 mi 10 50%3:37 PMSE10:27 PMSW-7:02 PMS238,457 mi 11 61%4:11 PMSE11:48 PMSW-8:00 PMS234,702 mi 12 72%4:36 PMSE--8:56 PMS230,929 mi 13 82%-1:17 AMWSW4:54 PMESE9:49 PMS227,442 mi 14 90%-2:47 AMWSW5:09 PMESE10:41 PMS224,581 mi 15 96%-4:17 AMW5:22 PME11:32 PMS222,666 mi 16 98%-5:48 AMW5:35 PME-- 17 100%-7:21 AMWNW5:49 PMENE12:22 AMS221,939 mi 18 100%-8:56 AMWNW6:07 PMENE1:15 AMS222,517 mi 19 96%-10:32 AMNW6:31 PMNE2:10 AMS224,356 mi 20 90%-12:03 PMNW7:05 PMNE3:09 AMS227,259 mi 21 82%-1:23 PMNW7:54 PMNE4:09 AMS230,911 mi 22 72%-2:23 PMNW8:58 PMNE5:09 AMS234,938 mi 23 62%-3:05 PMNW10:13 PMNE6:07 AMS238,977 mi 24 50%-3:32 PMNW11:31 PMNE7:00 AMS242,725 mi 25 41%-3:52 PMWNW-7:49 AMS245,964 mi 26 31%12:48 AMENE4:06 PMWNW-8:33 AMS248,567 mi 27 22%1:02 AMENE3:17 PMWNW-8:15 AMS250,480 mi 28 15%2:14 AME3:27 PMW-8:54 AMS251,708 mi 29 9%3:23 AME3:36 PMW-9:32 AMS252,299 mi 30 4%4:32 AME3:45 PMWSW-10:11 AMS252,324 mi 31 1%5:43 AMESE3:56 PMWSW-10:50 AMS251,862 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in London is essentially constant during October, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 10, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in London is gradually increasing during October, increasing from 10.9 miles per hour to 11.8 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 3, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 13.3 miles per hour, while on August 2, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 9.6 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in London throughout October is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 35% on October 31.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in London typically lasts for 9.8 months (297 days), from around February 22 to around December 15, rarely starting after March 26, or ending before November 13.\n\nThe month of October in London is very likely fully within the growing season, with the chance that a given day is in the growing season gradually decreasing from 100% to 95% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in October in London\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in London are gradually increasing during October, increasing by 171Â°F, from 2,050Â°F to 2,221Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in London is decreasing during October, falling by 1.4 kWh, from 2.9 kWh to 1.6 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in October in London\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in October in LondonOct11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWh5.5 kWh5.5 kWh6.0 kWh6.0 kWhSepNovOct 12.9 kWhOct 12.9 kWhOct 311.6 kWhOct 311.6 kWhOct 112.4 kWhOct 112.4 kWhOct 212.0 kWhOct 212.0 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of London are 51.509 deg latitude, -0.126 deg longitude, and 82 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of London contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 164 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 70 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (492 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (1,027 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of London is covered by artificial surfaces (96%), within 10 miles by artificial surfaces (97%), and within 50 miles by cropland (40%) and grassland (26%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in London, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in London.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and London according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at London is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between London and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLondon Weather Centre (EGRB, 98%, 0.7 mi, southeast, 46 ft elevation change)\n\nRAF Northolt (EGWU, 2.5%, 13 mi, west, 39 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of London and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
