For the full lowdown on the London in October weather and more, this is the only guide you need.\n\nHere’s everything to expect from the weather in London in mid-fall, plus suggestions regarding London things to do in October. Read on to plan your perfect trip!\n\nVisiting London in October | What to Expect\n\nWeather\n\nThe climate in London in October is getting colder and wetter, with shortening days. It might feel summery at the start, and wintry by the end, or anything in-between. 10 days of rain is average for the London October weather.\n\nAverage high: 16°C / 61°F\n\nAverage low: 10°C / 50°F\n\nAverage days of rain: 10\n\nIn terms of temperature, the weather in London in October isn’t hot, but nor is it normally too cold. October is the sixth-warmest month, and average temperatures are similar to those of April or May.\n\nThe weather can tend to “turn” at some point October in the UK, though from summery and warm to colder, more wintry weather. As you might expect, this is more likely later in the month.\n\nMild weather\n\nIn general, London’s climate is mild, without any major weather events or extremes. Now and then there may be wind storms or flash flooding, but this doesn’t happen too often.\n\nChangeable weather\n\nDue to its coastal location, the UK has what’s called a maritime climate. As it’s an island, the weather can change very fast. The bottom line is to be prepared for rain at all times, even if the day begins with clear blue skies!\n\nWet weather\n\nLondon and the rest of the UK are famous for being rainy. In practice, you might visit in October and it will be dry throughout your stay, or it could rain day after day. In reality, wet or dry spells can last for a number of consecutive days at a time. It’s really just down to luck.\n\nDaylight hours\n\nIn October, sunrise is between 7am and 7.45am, then around 6.45am to 6.50am after the clocks go back. The sun sets between 6.40pm and 5.45pm before the clocks change, then around 4.40 to 4.45 afterwards. During October, you’ll have around 10 or 11 daylight hours per day.\n\nSunrise: Between about 07:00 and 07:45 before BST ends and around 06:45 after\n\nSunset: Between about 18:40 and 17:45 before BST ends and around 16:45 after\n\nThe clocks go back (or “fall” back) in London in October. This happens around five days before the end of the month, resulting in lighter mornings and darker afternoons.\n\nThis is because the UK uses British Summer Time (BST) daylight saving in summer, before going back to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for winter.\n\nSunset\n\nAt the beginning of October, sunset is at about 6.40 pm. By the end, after the clocks go back, sunset is at about 4.45 pm. Before this, it gets dark by about 5.45 pm.\n\nSunrise\n\nSunrise in early October is at about 7 am, reaching 7.45 am later in the month. The sun comes up at around 6.45 am by the end of October, after the clocks have changed.\n\nWhat to pack\n\nFor fall weather in London in October, pack a waterproof jacket, and a warm layer or two you can wear underneath when it’s cold. You should also bring a travel umbrella, plus a strong, comfortable pair of walking shoes or boots, preferably waterproof ones. You’ll also need sweaters for evenings and chillier days.\n\nBy October, temperatures are starting to drop. It can also get pretty cold during the evenings, and more so at night. Towards the end of the month, it might even feel quite wintry. Here’s what to wear in London during October.\n\nWhatever the October temperature, you’ll do a lot of walking while you’re there. Packing a pair of comfortable shoes you can spend the whole day in is essential. Alternative footwear for the evenings will also give your hard-working feet a break. October’s the time for trainers, sneakers, or boots. It will be too cold for sandals by October.\n\nOuterwear\n\nDuring October, you’ll need a waterproof jacket that’s also warm – but not one you’ll get too hot in during milder days. Layering is key, even with outerwear, and a garment such as a rainproof jacket with a detachable fleece inner is ideal for mid-autumn.\n\nMake sure you take a daypack with enough space for those extra layers that you might discard or want to carry in case it gets colder.\n\nLayering\n\nHiking trousers are perfect for October, with jeans for the evenings. You can wear denim by day too, of course, but bear in mind that it can get heavy and uncomfortable when it’s wet.\n\nEarly in the month, a T-shirt might be enough, but you might need sweaters for colder days or in the evenings.\n\nEssentials\n\nAn insulated waterproof jacket, a comfortable daypack with enough space for essentials and a compact umbrella are ideal accessories for the usual England in October weather.\n\nLondon in October FAQs\n\nIs October a good time to visit London?\n\nEarly October can be surprisingly warm and sunny, while late October might be a lot colder.
