        "text": "We’ve seen a record-breaking baking June, a washout late summer and a sultry September – now the UK is bracing itself for another spell of unseasonal hot weather.\n\nMet Office forecasts are expecting highs of more than 25°C this weekend, with regions such as the North and South-East England facing conditions well above average for this time of year.\n\nExperts say the spell will mark a “return to summer” for some across the country.\n\nWhy will it be so hot in October?\n\nAccording to Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, unusually warm weather in October may soon become the norm for Britain.\n\n“This particular spike is the result of a high build-up of pressure caused by well above average temperatures in mainland Europe,” she said.\n\n“We’re talking about the record-breaking conditions in countries such as France and Spain. That is unfortunately a signal of climate change.”\n\nThe last time the UK saw highs of 25°C in October was in 2018. Though no monthly records are expected to be broken this year, Professor Bentley said the country could see daily temperatures that have not been reached for more than 100 years.\n\n“For example, the last time it was 26°C on an 8 October was back in 1921,” she said. “It’s very rare to see such warm weather at this time of year. It’s almost like a return to summer.\n\n“But this is something we expect to become more frequent over the next few years.”\n\nWhich areas are likely to be the warmest?\n\nThe South-East is expected to feel the hottest temperatures, with most of the region facing the early to mid-20s.\n\nHowever, northern cities such as Newcastle and Leeds are also forecast to reach at least 20°C.\n\n“Typically, we would expect a warmer October to bring around 13°C in the north and 16°C or 17°C in the South,” said Professor Bentley. Now we could see as high as 26°C and 22°C respectively. This is very unusual.”\n\nHow long is this weather expected to last?\n\nThe UK will see a gentle return to normality as we move through to next week.\n\nTemperatures are expected to peak over Saturday and Sunday before dropping closer towards average in the following days. Professor Bentley even predicted snow in some parts of Scotland.\n\n“It won’t be around long enough to be registered as an actual heatwave,” she said. “But it will land on a weekend which, depending on your viewpoint, could be quite nice.\n\n“Of course, people should still think about sun cream if they’re out all day. Even if it is just over two or three days, the sun can still pose a risk to your health.”"
