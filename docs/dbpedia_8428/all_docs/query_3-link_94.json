        "text": "Summers from June to August and the winters in December and January are considered the peak season for London. The city is packed with people, and booking of hotels and flights in advance is an absolute necessity. One should also book tickets for sightseeing and attractions to skip the long queues. The summer temperatures average between 18-30 degrees. The main advantage of summer is the green spaces, gardens that come to life, the longer daylight hours that make sightseeing easier and the various music festivals. During December the temperatures drop to less than 3 degrees Celsius. Layered in warm coats and clothes, the holiday season enthrals the traveller with the sparkling city lights and the shopping bonanzas. The summers can get humid; however, one needs to be prepared for drizzle in the peak seasons as well. During the holiday season, one can expect the rates to increase by almost 60%, and thus bookings are recommended.\n\nThe fall season from September to November and early spring from March to May can be termed as the shoulder season for London. During autumn the temperatures are from 11-15 degrees and precipitation more than 2 inches. The fall season is immediately after the busy summer season; schools reopen after the summer break and the family vacationing crowds considerably disappear. On the other hand, early spring is beginning to see a slow influx of more tourists with temperatures at 11-15 degrees and precipitation at 1.8 inches. The Easter weekend is busiest during the spring, whereas during autumn Halloween and pre-Christmas celebrations are the highlights of the city.\n\nWeather in Spring\n\nDuring the spring season in London, temperatures rarely cross 20 degrees. There are a few showers with precipitation from 1.8 to above 2 inches, but the mild temperatures are perfect for exploring the city. During the earlier months of spring, March and early April the crowds are relatively thinner but begin to pour in during the late spring. The gardens and royal parks are starting to blossom, and the warmth after a cold spell of the winters is inviting for various outdoor activities. Various flower shows, such as the Chelsea Flower Show in May and the Kew Gardens attract tourists and the British alike. April and May have a whole range of flower shows as well as beautiful sights of gardens and open green spaces. It is also a great time to enjoy cruises on River Thames, bike along the Regent’s Canal, row through Regent’s Park or picnic at the London Fields.\n\nKey Events in Spring\n\nSpring is also the time for festivities that include Easter and St. Patrick’s Day Festival and Parade in March. On Good Friday and Easter Monday, most shops are closed, and there are chances of reduced public transports as well. On the other hand, Central London is usually busy during the weeks that lead up to the Easter weekend. Some other festivals and celebrations that occur during the spring season are the Virgin Money London Marathon and the London Coffee Festival. Explore the Museums at Night a twice-yearly festival that takes place in May, as well as in October- November.\n\nWeather in Summer\n\nSummer is the peak season of London with minimum temperatures at 18 degrees and maximum temperatures at 30 degrees. This means that it can get quite hot during the summer and shorts and suitable clothing is advisable. July is usually the hottest month and precipitation hovers between 1.9 to 2.2 inches. Rains and humidity are a part of the summer months, yet the sunshine makes outdoor activities entertaining. The summers are but very crowded with long queues at almost everything. Booking in advance is essential for enjoying the vacation. With long days where the sunsets at around 9 pm, the summers are the best time to be outdoors, enjoy the concerts, take a train ride to Cambridge or Oxford.\n\nKey Events in Summer\n\nRooftop bars, beer gardens and open green spaces are popular attractions.\n\nIt is also the best season to visit all things related to royalty. The State Rooms at Buckingham Palace are open for tours from July to August, and the Clarence House opens in August alone. The Changing of Guards happens every day from April to July. The highlight is the Queen’s birthday parade, called Trooping the Color in June.\n\nShopping is also a popular thing to do with many summer sales, such as the Harrod’s Summer sale.\n\nBesides, the summer vacations are the best time for family vacationing coupled with free transport within the city that is provided for children below 11 years.\n\nMuseums and galleries are crowded, and the tickets of some of West End’s best shows are booked in June. The Natural History Museum, London Transport Museum and Science Museum are famous amongst kids.\n\nThe London Theatre’s Kids Week begins in August which has one free child ticket against an adult’s.\n\nThe Wimbledon Tennis Championships one of the most fabulous sporting events takes place during this season.\n\nThe annual London Pride parade takes place in June, whereas the Notting Hill Carnival in August is a cultural extravaganza.\n\nWeather in Autumn\n\nTourists throng London until mid-September after which the crowds begin to lessen to an extent. The temperatures are between 11-15 degrees and the shoulder season also ensures that the rates are lower. Rains continue to come and go, and precipitation is usually above 2 inches each month. These are the wettest months, and one should be prepared at all times with a raincoat or umbrella.\n\nKey Events in Autumn\n\nOctober is the time for half term breaks at school, and there can be an increase in crowds at museums, galleries and theatres.\n\nThe city landscape gives way to the cool look, yet it is the cultural activities that occur during the fall that are the season’s highlight.\n\nThe Totally Thames Festival in September, the Frieze Art Festival in Regent’s Park and the Museums at Night are some beautiful events in October.\n\nThe London Fashion Week in September and the BFI London Film Festival in early October need to be booked in advance.\n\nThe Guy Fawkes Night in November is when the night lights up with fireworks.\n\nAnd Halloween grips the city with events, such as Haunted Medieval Banquet at St. Katharine Docks or diving in the dark with sharks at the London’s Sea Life Aquarium."
