        "text": "With nights drawing in and Storm Agnes recently bringing strong winds and rain, the early September heatwave might seem a distant memory.\n\nHowever, that heatwave and above average temperatures generally made it the joint warmest September on record in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis also ties in with global average temperatures which have been running at record warmth too.\n\nWarmer weather in the UK has extended into October.\n\nThe Met Office has released figures showing that the average temperature in the UK throughout September was 15.2C, making it tied with 2006 as the warmest September on record.\n\nBreaking that down into average maximum recorded temperature, the month was 19.4C, the warmest in 127 years and joint top with 1895.\n\nFor England and Wales, it was the warmest September on record.\n\nThe high temperatures were partly due to the extensive and record heatwave at the start of September. There were seven consecutive days when the temperature rose above 30C.\n\nThe UK's highest recorded temperature of 2023 was also recorded during that heatwave. The year's high occurring in September has only happened four times before, since records began.\n\nThe heat seen in the United Kingdom is also reflected in what we have seen elsewhere.\n\nFor France, Germany, Denmark and Austria, September was also the warmest on record. In France, the mean temperature was over a degree higher then the previous warmest set in 1949.\n\nGlobally, temperatures have spiked since the start of June with the last few months being the warmest on record - and by quite a margin.\n\nBerkeley Earth, an organisation that tracks global temperatures, said in their August temperature assessment that 2023 is \"virtually certain to be the warmest year on record\", external.\n\nScientists have previously suggested that with the presence of El NiÃ±o in the Pacific, a warming phase of a natural weather pattern, global temperatures are expected to be higher."
