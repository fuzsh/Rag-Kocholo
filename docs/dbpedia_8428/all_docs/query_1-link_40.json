        "text": "Climate of London\n\ninLondon inLandscape\n\nContinuous records of London’s weather extend back to 1659, with specific data for wind direction available since 1723 and for precipitation since 1697. The fluctuations show a cyclic pattern, with troughs of hard winters and cold springs during the 1740s, 1770s, 1809–17, 1836–45, and 1875–82 followed by a long upswing after 1919, in which London’s climate became warmer, largely because of milder weather in the autumn months.\n\nModern London has the equable climate of South East England, with mild winters and temperate summers. The average daytime air temperature is 52 °F (11 °C), with 42 °F (5.5 °C) in January and 65 °F (18 °C) in July. Statistics show that the sun shines, however briefly, on five days out of six. Londoners shed their winter overcoats in April or May and begin to dress warmly again in late October. The prevailing wind is west-southwest. Because of the sheltering effect of the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, the city has slightly less rainfall than the Home Counties. In an average year one can expect 200 dry days out of 365 and a precipitation total of about 23 inches (585 mm) evenly distributed across the 12 months.\n\nThe incidence of sleet and snow is less predictable. It varies greatly from year to year around a long-run statistical average of 20 days. The snowiest winter on record was 1695, with snow falling on 70 days. When snow does fall (generally only in the first three months of the year), it rarely accumulates. Semihardy plants can winter over in London gardens, though only in the most sheltered and sunny spot will a London vine bear grapes sweet enough for wine making.\n\nClimatic variations across the metropolis show very clearly that there is a heat island created by concentration of buildings, internal-combustion engines, and heating and air-conditioning plants. Temperatures are higher toward the center of the city, and the air is drier. Overall, the average difference in minimum temperatures between London and the surrounding country is 3.4 °F (1.9 °C), but on individual nights the difference can be as much as 16.2 °F (9 °C). The chemical, mechanical, and thermal effects of the city also affect wind speed and precipitation. Downpours of heavy rain are liable to be more intense within London because pollution particles act as condensation nuclei for water vapour.\n\nEnvironment\n\nSmog and air pollution\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nart market: London\n\nFor years London was synonymous with smog, the word coined at the turn of the 20th century to describe the city’s characteristic blend of fog and smoke. The capital’s “pea-soupers” were caused by suspended pollution of smoke and sulfur dioxide from coal fires. The most severely affected area was the 19th-century residential and industrial belt of inner London—particularly the East End, which had the highest density of factory smokestacks and domestic chimney pots and the lowest-lying land, inhibiting dispersal. As recently as the early 1960s, the smokier districts of east Inner London experienced a 30 percent reduction in winter sunshine hours. That problem was alleviated by parliamentary legislation (the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968) outlawing the burning of coal, combined with the clearance of older housing and the loss of manufacturing.\n\nThe less visible but equally toxic pollutants of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, benzines, and aldehydes continue to spoil London’s air. Traffic fumes and other exhausts are liable to become trapped between the surrounding hills and below a stagnant capping mass of warm urban air at an altitude of about 3,000 feet (900 meters), causing immediate increases in eye irritation, asthma, and bronchial complaints. But London’s weather is too fickle for the development of a full-scale photochemical smog of the kind that can build up under the more stable weather conditions of cities such as Los Angeles.\n\nWater pollution\n\nUntil the 1960s the waters of London’s rivers were as polluted as its air. Deoxygenated and black with scum, they showed the effects of sewage pollution and uncontrolled industrial effluents. Tighter environmental standards, combined with the closure of factories, produced an improvement in water quality. Salmon, sea trout, roach, and flounder returned to the tidal Thames, together with shrimps, prawns, sea horses, and (at the other end of the size range) giant conger eels. Large-scale fishing of eels, a traditional Cockney delicacy, was restarted after a hiatus of 150 years. In addition, herons, cormorants, gannets, grebes, shelducks, pochards, and terns recolonized the river environs.\n\nFlood control\n\nThe greatest concern in the management of the Thames has been the risk of flooding. Its waters have been rising at the rate of 2.8 feet (0.9 meter) per century. The record floods of 1791 reached a height of 14 feet (4.3 meters) above the fixed measuring point, Ordnance Datum at London Bridge; those of 1953 rose to 17.7 feet (5.4 meters). At high tide on a spring day, when the river is swollen with runoff, it is striking to see ships moored along the Victoria Embankment riding high above the roadway, and it is sobering to reflect on the damage that would result if the waters overtopped the walls. A serious flood would threaten 45 square miles (117 square km) of London’s low-lying land, affecting some 1,250,000 people and 250,000 buildings and paralyzing the capital’s dense infrastructure of underground railways, sewers, telephone cabling, service tunnels, and gas, water, and electricity mains.\n\nThe flood risk results from a combination of factors. All of southeastern Britain is slowly being tilted down into the sea (and the Hebrides tilted up) by tectonic movements resulting from the melting of Pleistocene (i.e., from about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) ice sheets. London is sinking faster than the remainder of the region because water is extracted from the chalk aquifer, thus gradually drying up the underlying beds of clay. In addition, the tidal rhythm of the Thames has been amplified by dredging for navigation and by the embankment of its estuary marshes for cultivation.\n\nThe traditional method of protection was to build up the river walls and embankments. Long stretches were raised after passage of the Thames Flood Act of 1879; further protective measures were taken after serious flooding in 1928, when 14 people drowned in basements in Westminster, and again after the still more serious inundations in 1953. The official inquiry into the 1953 floods recommended that “apart from erecting further walls and banks, an investigation should be made into the building of a flood barrier across the Thames.” Some 20 years of debate about the best design and location for a barrier produced an unusual form of flood protection that leaves the tidal Thames intact. At Silvertown, 8 miles (13 km) downstream of London Bridge, a line of piers was erected; from the piers were suspended 10 enormous steel gates and counterweights, the 4 main ones weighing 3,000 tons each. Normally positioned face-downward on the bed of the river, at a time of flood risk they can be swung up by electrohydraulic machinery to form a continuous barrier sealing off London from the sea. Downstream of the Thames Barrier, to protect against the backsurge caused by its closure, elaborate walls were built along the estuary marshes with guillotine-style floodgates at the mouths of tributary rivers."
