AVERAGE TEMPERATURES

Afternoon temperatures early in the month are between 17-18 C (in the low to mid-60s F) falling to 13-14 C (into the mid-50s F) by the end of the month.

And on some occasions, it can reach 32-23C (into the low 70 F).

Overnight low temperatures run mostly near 10 C (50 F) early in the month to 7-8 C (the mid-40s F) towards the end of this month.

HOW MUCH RAIN IN OCTOBER?

Yes, the weather is wet in London.

However, there are still about 13-15 days during this month that will see either sunny or partly sunny skies with the remainder of the month being mostly cloudy.

Some rain occurs on about 20 days this month with about 16 of these having moderate to sometimes heavy rains.

At least you do not have to worry about any snow this time of year.

WHAT TO WEAR

London has one of the mildest climates in the U.K.

However, as the weather is changeable, it is always best to carry an umbrella. In addition, a light to medium-weight waterproof jacket is a must.
