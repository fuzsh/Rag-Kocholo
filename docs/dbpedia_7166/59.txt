Wahlöö, Per

Entry updated 12 September 2022. Tagged: Author.

(1926-1975) Swedish author, best known for his ten-volume Martin Beck crime novel series, all written with his partner Maj Sjöwall (1935-2020). His Near-Future sf thrillers, all of which interrogate the form they use, include Mord på 31:a våningen (1964; trans Joan Tate as Murder on the 31st Floor 1966; vt The Thirty-First Floor 1967), in which intrusive detective work and the intrusions of a totalitarian state are seen as nearly indistinguishable, and which was filmed as Kamikaze 1989 (1982); Generalerna (1965; trans Joan Tate as The Generals 1974), set around the court-martial on an isolated Island of a soldier who has apparently "blasphemed" against the military Dystopia that society has become; and Stälspranget (1968; trans Joan Tate as The Steel Spring 1970), in which an exile from a despotic Sweden returns to find the land decimated by a deadly Pandemic.
