        "text": "About the Book\n\nThe final classic installment in the excellent Martin Beck detective series from the 1960s – the novels that have inspired all Scandinavian crime fiction.\n\nWidely recognised as the greatest masterpieces of crime fiction ever written, these are the original detective stories that pioneered the detective genre.\n\nWritten in the 1960s, they are the work of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo – a husband and wife team from Sweden. The ten novels follow the fortunes of the detective Martin Beck, whose enigmatic, taciturn character has inspired countless other policemen in crime fiction. The novels can be read separately, but do follow a chronological order, so the reader can become familiar with the characters and develop a loyalty to the series. Each book will have a new introduction in order to help bring these books to a new audience.\n\nCritical Praise\n\n<p>Praise for ‘Roseanna’:</p><p>‘The writing is elegant and surprisingly humorous – if you haven’t come across Beck before, you’re in for a treat.’ Guardian</p><p>‘I have never read a finer police story.’ Los Angeles Times</p><p>‘The decalogue about the Swedish Chief Inspector Martin Beck created by Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo during the 1960s and 1970s are indeed classic police fiction. They changed the genre. Whoever is writing crime fiction after these novels inspired by them in one way or another.’ Henning Mankell</p><p>‘If you haven’t read Sjowall/Wahloo, start now.’ Sunday Telegraph</p><p>‘Their mysteries don’t just read well; they reread even better. Witness, wife, petty cop or crook – they’re all real characters even if they get just a few sentences. The plots hold, because they’re ingenious but never inhuman.’ New York Times</p> -\n\nProduct Details"
