        "text": "\"I hope that's a sandwich you're reaching for because whatever it is, you're gonna have to eat it!\"\n\nThe Laughing Policeman is the fourth book in the series of ten Swedish novels featuring detective Martin Beck by husband and wife team - and originators of Nordic Noir - Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂, who just happen to figure high in my list of favourite authors. It's a novel that grips like a vice from the off, depicting a lone gunman's massacre of the passengers of a Stockholm bus, one of whom was an off-duty policeman known to Beck. Assigned the case, Beck and his team must piece together how and why their dead colleague came to be on the bus, discovering just as much about him as they do the murderer.\n\nGiven the premise, it's easy to see why Hollywood were interested. Stuart Rosenberg's film relocates the action to San Francisco but loses so much along the way.\n\nI still don't understand the decision to start the film not with the multiple shooting (or indeed the Vietnam protest that features in the novel) but with events that lead up to the incident on the bus; a peculiar narrative choice that robs some of the mystery inherent in the story by revealing information to audiences that would not figure until much later in the source novel.\n\nEqually missing is Sj√∂wall and Wahl√∂√∂'s purpose behind the Martin Beck series. These novels were not just mystery thrillers, they were a textual exploration of the so-called 'Third Way' (between Communism and Capitalism) of Sweden's welfare experiment and, as such, served as a critique of Swedish society throughout the 1960s. In their novels, the bureaucrats and town planners, the rich and the destitute, were just as important as the cops and criminals. Their starting point was that something had gone profoundly wrong in Swedish society and their central protagonist, Martin Beck, was the consummate professional policeman who not only attempted to administer cures but was also wearily sick from what he viewed and experienced.\n\nWhilst Sj√∂wall and Wahl√∂√∂ were often happy to cite their influence in crime fiction arguably stemmed from America, transplanting their story to there essentially makes it little more than an imitation of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels (novels that the husband and wife claim to have been initially unaware of) and the cliches of the traditionally American policier are all too apparent in Rosenberg's film. Walter Matthau takes the role of Beck (here renamed Jake Martin) and is admirably dour and dyspeptic but is also a good deal less empathetic than the character in the books. Here, he's not averse to slapping suspects (and women) around, and is placed in the midst of stereotypical domestic disharmony (in the novel, Beck and his wife had already become estranged by this stage, having realised they married in haste as teenagers and no longer really know one another). Matthau, famous for his comedic roles opposite Jack Lemmon, depicts the glumness of the character admirably, which is just as well as - considering the script elects to remove the very reason why the whole affair is called 'The Laughing Policeman' (Beck's daughter presents him the old music hall record on Christmas Day, and the novel ends with him laughing) - we're left to presume the title must be ironic. (Some territories - including I think the UK, briefly at least - even retitled the film as An Investigation of Murder to avoid confusion).\n\nRosenberg attempts to make much of San Francisco's colour, perhaps to compliment the integrity of the novels dissection of society, but with bearded ladies, busty strippers, Hare Krishna devotees and obese life models are wheeled out, it sometimes feels like overkill. Crucially, the appeal is lost. If you're from an English-language speaking country, Sj√∂wall and Wahl√∂√∂'s Sweden is instantly exotic, fresh and original. This is just another American crime story and the procedural elements that are so engaging on the page feel like an abundance of red herrings and dead ends on the screen.\n\nOne of the things I really liked about this adaptation however is the casting of Louis Gossett Jr. as Larrimore - he's the one responsible for that glorious bit of dialogue (spoken to a pimp he's just floored) I included at the top of the review. The casting of an Afro-American actor in the Kollberg role helps to draw out the bigotry of Bruce Dern's Larsen, and he lights up the screen whenever he appears. Unfortunately, the adaptation rather reduces his role as Beck/Martin's friend, partner and confident, preferring instead to focus much more on Larsen. The character of Gunvald Larsson remains a highlight in all of the Beck novels, a brusque yet strangely loveable viking who serves as both action man and comic relief. Dern was no stranger to portraying the ugly side of human nature and he nails the roughhousing nature and aforementioned bigotry, but the character's perpetual (comic) exasperation is somewhat underplayed.\n\nI know my review and rating may seem a little unfair but it is only because I am such an admirer of the novels that I can't help but see the missed potential and flaws in the film. I should point out however that this film was my introduction to Martin Beck, having watched this film for the first (and, until today, only time in the '90s). If you have no prior knowledge or experience of Maj Sj√∂wall and Per Wahl√∂√∂'s writing and you like a good '70s crime drama then this is still enjoyable enough, though not the best that 'New Hollywood' had to offer in this field. If you are a fan of the Martin Beck books and are looking for a good, faithful adaptation to watch then look no further than Bo Widerberg's Mannen p√• taket (aka Man on the Roof) from 1976, based on the seventh book in the series, The Abominable Man. Interestingly, the actor chosen to play Beck in that film, Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt, was also known for his comic roles, just like Matthau."
