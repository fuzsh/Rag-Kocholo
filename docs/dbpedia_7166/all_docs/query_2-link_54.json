        "text": "Very good radio drama\n\nThe reality of this drama is very good. But 11 stories are bit too long. Maybe three to five episode is good enough for my concentration.\n\nHighly Recommended. Compelling stories\n\nSuperb cast and orchestration of these compelling stories. Seeking out more of Maj Sjowall and Petr Wahloo! Wonderful works.\n\nReminiscent\n\nBe clear that these are short adaptations of short novels. I read the books many years ago as they came out in English. I loved them and was primed for dozens more from Scandinavia. These abbreviated radio adaptations do not permit full development of all characters or the interplay of culture, politics, and individual personality. However, the dramatizations offer strong flavors of these facets of the originals, and they are lovely procedurals as they stand. If you like old-fashioned radio dramas you will be pleased to experience these excellent productions, beautifully enacted.\n\nFantastic stories. I hope this whetted your appetite for the actual books!\n\nThese are great stories and a time capsule of a period of time. The authors were genius using these stories to illustrate their society. BUT, did we have to listen to people eating. Arenâ€™t Swedish folks taught not to talk with their mouths full? This is minor but is in every story .\n\nI urge you to invest in the actual books. They are marvelous.\n\nReally good\n\nLoved the books and here they are fully dramatized! Two thumbs up on this collection.\n\nthe grandparents of the swedish murder mystery\n\nvery enjoyable! flashes of humor and cynicism. my favorite character was Larsson, played by Ralph Inerson. this was my first foray into BBC radio plays, and I'm definitely going to listen to many more!\n\ngreat swedish cop series with characters you ðŸ’˜\n\nmartin beck and his Stockholm come alive and transports the listener to the place and time with intriguing characters and crimes...a great series!\n\nVery entertaining.\n\nWell presented with a full cast. All 10 of the novels included. I enjoyed this title very much."
