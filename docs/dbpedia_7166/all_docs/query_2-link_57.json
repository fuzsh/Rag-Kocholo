        "text": "”'I’ve read 'The Laughing Policeman' six or eight times. Each time I reach the final twist on the final page, I shiver afresh.” - Jonathan Franzen\n\n”'Tantalizing…the splendid story of an apparently motiveless crime.” - New York Times Book Review\n\n”'An influential police procedural with a precision-engineered plot that can grip and shock a reader…the plotting, pacing and characterisation are all exquisite: and the halting translation and the dated, just plain weird sexual politics somehow seem only to make it more compelling.” - Independent on Sunday\n\n”'For Beck, as with Maigret, each investigation is less a riddle to be answered than a human situation to be understood…it's all done with immense accomplishment. A welcome addition to the Martin Beck casebook.” - Matthew Coady, Guardian\n\n”'They changed the genre. Whoever is writing crime fiction after these novels is inspired by them in one way or another.” - Henning Mankell\n\n”'If you haven’t read Sjöwall/Wahlöö, start now.” - Sunday Telegraph\n\n”'Pick up one book…and you become unhinged. You want to block out a week of your life, lie to your boss, and stay in bed, gorging on one after another.” - Observer"
