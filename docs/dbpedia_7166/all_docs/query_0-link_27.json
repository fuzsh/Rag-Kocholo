        "text": "The Martin Beck series is a collection of ten police procedural novels written by Swedish authors Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö during the 1960s and 1970s. The series follows the protagonist, Martin Beck, a police inspector in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe series is renowned for its extensive character and setting development throughout the books. The authors plotted and researched each book together, then wrote alternate chapters simultaneously. This careful planning resulted in a series that covers ten years in the life of Martin Beck.\n\nThe series became international bestsellers and have sold over 10 million copies. The character of Martin Beck has inspired countless other characters in crime fiction. The books have been adapted into films and television series, further cementing their influence in popular culture.\n\nMartin Beck Mysteries in Order"
