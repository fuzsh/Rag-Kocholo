        "text": "I once suggested that some Nordic crime novels are Jackie Collins or Harold Robbins with enough mildly leftist musing thrown in to make readers feel intellectually respectable. One reply to that comment put it this way:\n\n“It’s why I think ‘Downton Abbey’ does so well in this country, too. It’s basically an absurdly trashy soap opera, a notch or two down from the magnificent ‘Days of Our Lives,’ but because it’s on PBS and they’re speaking with English accents, it’s somehow thought of as being intelligent or classy.”\n\nIndeed, Jo Nesbø and other Scandinavian crime writers are often praised for the morally improving qualities of their books, for casting a harsh light beneath the idyllic surface of the welfare state, but how idyllic can that surface be after so many years of harsh light-casting? (Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo published the first of their superb Martin Beck novels in 1965.)\n\nNesbø’s police and politicians are corrupt, and he portrays that corruption more entertainingly than many writers do (though he may have reached his police-corruption apex with the magnificently evil Tom Waaler in “The Redbreast,” “Nemesis” and “The Devil’s Star”). And that old standby, the right-wing nut, is the weakest part of “Phantom,” ninth of Nesbø’s novels about Oslo police inspector Harry Hole (pronounced HEU-leh). The character expounding those views is presumably intended as comic but really is a risible caricature, and perfunctory into the bargain.\n\nA socially minded critic could say Nesbø sidelines the problems of xenophobia and sexism in Norway by consigning them to a pathetic sociopath, the better to let readers of sound views feel superior. But that may be overanalysis. Perhaps this novel’s token racist sexist is just the canny Nesbø giving the readers a bit of what they demand in their Scandinavian crime novels before he gets on with his story.\n\n“Phantom”\n\nAuthor: Jo Nesbø\n\nPublisher: Knopf\n\nPages: 400\n\nCost: $26 hardback and paperback, $13 e-book, $40 audio book\n\n_____________\n\nTrilogy follows friends’ R-rated exploits\n\nThe first two installments of Maya Banks’ “Breathless” trilogy were such an enjoyable read I’m disappointed that the final book in the series won’t be out until August.\n\n“Rush,” the first title in the series, came out Feb. 5, and “Fever” follows April 2. The trilogy revolves around three men _ Gabe Hamilton, Jace Crestwell and Ash McIntyre _ friends since college who find themselves falling in love.\n\nBanks said the books are a hybrid of the highly erotic books she is known for and the stories she pens for Harlequin’s Desire line. “Rush” fits into this slot nicely. It’s the story of Gabe, who manages to fall in love with Jace’s sister, Mia. The twist here is that Mia was an “oops baby” and, when their parents were killed when she was 6, she was left in the care of her then-20-year-old brother. He raised her with the help of Gabe and Ash.\n\nAsh has always looked at Mia as a little sister, but at some point Gabe started looking at her as his next conquest. All three of the men are into BDSM. They, of course, take the dominant role. (Note: These books are for mature readers who won’t be offended by explicit descriptions of sex and numerous sex scenes.) Gabe requires a contract, while Jace and Ash like to share.\n\nIn “Rush,” Gabe gets Mia under contract, but she’s always the one in control. Rush is a lighthearted tale that has some nice twists, and there is even a scene that made me laugh aloud. Gabe is in love with Mia, but he doesn’t realize it until his treacherous ex-wife (she’s the reason he requires contracts) points it out to him.\n\nThe plot follows his stupid reaction to the news and then his efforts to make everything right. Mia is a sassy and smart character who, despite signing the contract, doesn’t hesitate to argue with Gabe when she disagrees with him.\n\nBanks loves writing secondary characters, and “Rush” is filled with interesting friends and family members. In addition to struggling with his own love life, Gabe is torn between his recently divorced parents. His mom can’t get over the fact that her husband wanted a divorce after 39 years and, once you meet her ex-husband, it’s clear Gabe’s stupidity is inherited.\n\nBanks introduces Jace and Ash in “Rush” and their proclivity for sharing. Mia’s reaction is hilarious.\n\nIn “Fever,” Banks steps way out of the romance mold with the story of Jace and Bethany Willis. The result is a compelling and gritty read that doesn’t take the normal route to the happy ending.\n\nBethany is homeless _ not mad at her family and living in a dump, but looking for a bed in a shelter. She was a foster kid who aged out of the system and hit the streets. She has been homeless for four years, and she only agrees to a hookup with Jace and Ash because they agree to buy her a meal.\n\nBut it’s clear from the start that Jace really isn’t into sharing when it comes to Bethany. His reaction to her is nothing short of obsession. He plucks her out of the shelter, takes care of her and demands she submit. She complies, but there’s always an undercurrent of unworthiness on her part and over-the-top jealousy from him.\n\nJace’s hair-trigger temper is a key part of the plot, as is Bethany’s former life on the streets of New York.\n\nAs with “Rush,” there are plenty of secondary characters to add flavor to Fever. Jace’s relationship with Ash is tested because of Jace’s insecurities. Mia and Gabe are back; Jace and Ash meet Bethany at Mia and Gabe’s engagement party.\n\nBanks said she will start on Ash’s story this month. She has laid the groundwork for another strong tale _ Ash is at loose ends now that his friends have found bliss and the rattlesnakes who raised him are trying to pull him back into the pit.\n\n“Burn” is due out Aug. 6 — I’ll mark my calendar.\n\n—By Jean Marie Brown, Fort Worth Star-Telegram\n\n“Rush”\n\nAuthor: Maya Banks\n\nPublisher: Berkley Trade\n\nPages:\n\nCost: $15 paperback and audio book, $8 e-book\n\n“Fever\n\nIn stores April 2\n\nAuthor: Maya Banks\n\nPublisher: Berkley Trade"
