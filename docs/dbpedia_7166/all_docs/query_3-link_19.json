        "text": "The dark nights. The chilling temperatures. The backdrop of stark white snow. For many reasons, Scandinavia has become one of the primary settings for dark crime fiction and thriller books. Nordic noir, also known as Scandinavian noir, is a genre that’s grown increasingly popular over the last few decades.\n\nHere’s a brief history of Scandinavian and Nordic mysteries & thrillers and their popularity.\n\nWhile the direct origins of Nordic noir are not agreed upon, the Martin Beck detective series, written by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, is considered by many to be one of the first examples of the genre. The series was published between 1965 and 1975, and it follows the stories of detectives from the special homicide commission of the Swedish national police, with detective Martin Beck as the main protagonist. Sjöwall and Wahlöö’s novels took Scandinavian thrillers into a new and exciting direction. The storylines were darker than previous crime novels, with a strong focus on social issues and critiques of Swedish society.\n\nWhile the Martin Beck series was popular, Nordic noir as a genre wouldn’t really take off until the 1990s. In 1997, Henning Mankell, who is sometimes referred to as the father of Nordic noir, wrote the first novel following detective Kurt Wallander, entitled Mördare utan ansikte, or Faceless Killers. In the ’90s, there was also Karin Fossum, often called the “Norwegian queen of crime,” who wrote the Inspector Sejer series, starting with Eva’s Eye in 1995. These novels were incredibly atmospheric, focused on brutal crimes, and also included the social commentary of their Nordic noir predecessors.\n\nThe genre increased in popularity through the 2000s, with novels like Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy becoming international bestsellers. But it wasn’t until the 2010s that Nordic Noir was officially given its name. “Nordic noir” was a term originally coined by the Scandinavian Department at the University College of London. Journalists and literature critics embraced the term, and Nordic noir soon became recognized as a significant sub-genre of thrillers and crime fiction.\n\nBut what officially classifies something as Nordic noir, aside from its setting? According to The Verge, Nordic noir is a genre defined by “emotional chilliness and overarching sense of despair, expressed via brutal murder-mystery plots, often set in cold, dark countries like Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and Finland.” In Kim Toft Hansen and Anne Marit Waade’s Locating Nordic Noir, the authors point out that the genre is also defined by its dark aesthetic, its brooding protagonists, its slow-burn pacing, and the multi-layered storylines, often exploring multiple crimes at once (not necessarily all murder mysteries). Social commentary also remains an important part of the Nordic noir story. Novels like Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deal with misogyny, and Mankell’s Faceless Killers examines Sweden’s immigrant population. So while there are some who argue the status of Nordic noir, the merits of its long-standing history and idiosyncratic style make it stand out in the crime fiction landscape. In other words, it may be commercial to some but to others, it’s poignant and classic.\n\nNordic noir has only increased in popularity throughout the 2010s and into the 2020s. Lars Kepler’s Joona Linna series, which follows Swedish detective Joona Linna, has sold 15 million copies in 40 languages.\n\nNorwegian author Jo Nesbø has written twelve best-selling novels following the tough and often unorthodox detective Harry Hole. In 2017, Nesbø’s novel The Snowman was adapted into a film starring Michael Fassbender. And in 2019, the author released his most recent Harry Hole novel, Knife."
