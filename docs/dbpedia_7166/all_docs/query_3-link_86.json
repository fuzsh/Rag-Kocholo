        "text": "I have mixed feelings about the trend of writing novels based on the lives of real people. I’ve enjoyed some of them, like The Personal Librarian, but sometimes I just can’t get that “Did any of this really happen?” tickle out of my head. In the case of The Friday Night Club, which is about the life of Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, I might not have finished it had I not been reading it for a book group. Ultimately, I did enjoy it, albeit with caveats.\n\nHilma af Klint was born in 1862. When she was in her late teens, she became fascinated by spiritualism, particularly after the death of her sister Hermina in 1880. Hilma began gathering on Friday nights with four other women, who would hold séances and channel messages from advanced spirits. Initially recognized for her figurative paintings, Hilma began producing abstract work around 1906. With the help of her friends, she developed her “Paintings for the Temple” series—works she intuited would not be appreciated in her lifetime, so her will decreed that they not be exhibited until 20 years after her death.\n\nEven people who don’t believe in spiritualism have to admit that it’s kind of amazing that the spiral “temple” Hilma conceived of as the ideal home for her paintings coincidentally looked a lot like the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim, which was completed 14 years after her death in 1944. The Guggenheim’s landmark 2018-19 exhibition of her work became the most-visited show in the museum’s history.\n\nThe Friday Night Club is a dual-timeline novel, alternating chapters set around the turn of the 20th century following Hilma and her friends with a story about a fictional curator at the Guggenheim who is working on bringing the af Klint exhibition to the museum. Now, the book’s prologue shows Hilma and her friend, collaborator and maybe-lover Anna Cassel burning all of her correspondence before her death, so it’s quite clear that everything about her process and her relationships is strictly conjecture. Inventing a curator working on a real-life exhibition that took place less than a decade ago seems like a somewhat audacious choice. A few of the fictionalized elements of the modern-day story are obviously drawn from real life (such as the protests against the Sackler family of OxyContin-peddling fame); other aspects seem realistic, but were completely made up by the authors. It’s also interesting that they chose to make the curator a man, considering the protofeminist nature of Hilma and her work.\n\nSome of the prose struck me as clunky—”You paint pictures with your words as well as your brush. How lucky I am to have you by my side,” Hilma says to one of her fellow artists. Gradually, however, the book sort of grew on me, especially as Hilma is desperately trying to finish her large-scale paintings in a borrowed warehouse, a reminder of the powerful barriers women faced simply to have the opportunity to create. One of the members of my book group wondered whether or not there were more Hilma af Klints out there whose work is waiting to be discovered; the tragedy is that there are no doubt many other women who might have created brilliant works of art, but never even had the opportunity to try.\n\nIn 2020, I started studying advanced Swedish literature when the pandemic forced in-person classes to move to Zoom. It is taught through the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis, and even though I’m currently the only non-Minnesotan in my class, enough local students prefer the virtual option to make it worthwhile for the organization to continue offering the Zoom course. We read three novels a year, but Astrid & Veronika is the first one so far which was written in English and then translated into Swedish.\n\nLinda Olsson is a Swedish author who moved to New Zealand when she was in her 40s. Despite the fact that she wrote Astrid & Veronika in her second language, she didn’t translate it herself (Lisbet Holst did). I read about half of the English-language edition out of curiosity, and I think Holst did a great job. I’d planned to read the entire novel in both English and Swedish (something I did a few years ago with Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö’s Murder at the Savoy), but to be honest, the book is such a downer that I ultimately decided to just stick with the Swedish edition.\n\nAstrid is a reclusive 80-year-old woman who is derided in her community as the town witch. She lives alone in a fairly isolated house in the Swedish province of Dalarna. One day, the much-younger Veronika arrives to rent the nearest home to Astrid’s. Veronika is a Swede who has been living in New Zealand and London during the past few years. The two strike up a friendship, and begin to tell each other about their lives. If you can imagine something tragic, it’s probably happened to one of these women. (Astrid’s first story is about how her mother committed suicide when Astrid was a child of six.)\n\nEvery chapter in the book begins with a few lines of poetry, much of it written by a pair of Swedish writers who have sad backstories: Karin Boye, who died by suicide after suffering from depression for many years; and Dan Andersson, who passed away at the age of 32 after spending the night in a hotel room that had recently been sprayed with hydrogen cyanide in order to kill bedbugs.\n\nI kind of hated everything about the book until I reached a point where I was so caught up in the characters’ plight that I began to weep, something that almost never happens (Anthony Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See and Nick Hornby’s Juliet, Naked are the only two other books I can think of that affected me in the same way). So it’s definitely a well-written, moving novel. But it’s also the literary equivalent of “Gloomy Sunday,” which is notorious for being the saddest song ever written. As for my Swedish class, by popular demand, our next title will be a feel-good novel set at a small-town waffle house.\n\nIt’s Earth Day, and what better way to celebrate than by reading a book about eels? Does anyone really want to read a book about eels? The answer is clearly yes; before Patrik Svensson’s The Book of Eels was published in the author’s native Sweden, the foreign rights had already been sold to 34 different countries. Since its initial publication in 2019, it’s collected numerous accolades and raves, including Sweden’s prestigious August Prize for the best nonfiction book of the year.\n\nI had never really given any thought to the eel before, except as a popular bit of crossword fill (along with equally vowel-heavy Japanese menu items anago and unagi). However, The Book of Eels kept me riveted as Svensson presented a veritable feast of fascinating facts. Did you know that 19-year-old Sigmund Freud spent a month dissecting hundreds of eels in a futile attempt to find a male of the species? (No one had ever seen the European eel laying eggs, giving birth or mating, leading to a massive effort in the late 19th century to discover an eel with male reproductive organs.) Did you know that it is common knowledge that European eels’ only spawning area is the Sargasso Sea, and yet to this day, nobody has ever laid eyes on a mature eel, alive or dead, in that vast oceanic region?\n\nThe creature is so enigmatic that “the eel question,” as it has become known, has bedeviled scientists for hundreds of years. It seems crazy that some of the greatest minds in history have spent their careers trying to figure out how eels reproduce and not been able to come to a definitive conclusion. Svensson grapples with the conundrums of science in his book, as well as the very human issue of the relationship between fathers and sons; he recalls childhood evenings spent fishing for eels with his own dad, apparently the only time that the two of them really connected. (His father, a blue-collar worker, couldn’t figure out why Svensson wanted to attend university.) The book alternates between Svensson’s memoir and chapters which deal more straightforwardly with the history of man’s search for answers about the elusive Anguilla anguilla.\n\nIn one chapter, Svensson writes about the Brantevik Eel, allegedly caught by an 8-year-old boy in southern Sweden in 1859 and dropped into a well. It lived there for 150 years, “kept alive by the occasional worm and insect that would fall into the water, cut off from the world and robbed not only of the sea, the sky, and the stars, but also the meaning of its existence: the journey home, back to the Sargasso Sea, the thing that would make its life complete.” Musing about its “life of endless waiting,” Svensson ponders:\n\nFrom this we can learn that time is unreliable company and that no matter how slowly the seconds tick by, life is over in the blink of an eye: we are born with a home and a heritage and we do everything we can to free ourselves from this fate, and maybe we even succeed, but soon enough, we realize we have no choice but to travel back from where we came from, and if we can’t get there, we’re never really finished, and there we are, in the light of our sudden epiphany, feeling like we’ve lived our whole lives at the bottom of a dark well, with no idea who we really are, and then suddenly, one day, it’s too late.\n\nElegantly translated by Agnes Broomé (my Swedish class read the first couple of chapters of the original text, so I can confidently state that she did a beautiful job), The Book of Eels will leave you entertained, enlightened, and pondering life’s eternal mysteries.\n\nNote: this book includes descriptions of rape and sexual assault.\n\nOne of the very few positive aspects of the violent protests at the Capitol is the number of people who have been turned in to the FBI by their friends and loved ones. Whether it be a liberal daughter ratting out her MAGA mom or an Olympic swimmer pointing a finger at a former teammate, a lot of people want to see justice done and consequences meted out, and I am here for it.\n\nWhile headlines about the would-be coup were still dominating the news, I was reading Swedish author M.T. Edvardsson’s A Nearly Normal Family, which asks the question: “How far would you go to protect the ones you love?” A teenage girl has been accused of committing a murder, and her parents are willing to go to almost any lengths to defend her—even though they don’t know whether or not she’s actually guilty.\n\nThis psychological/legal thriller has a three-part structure, in which we hear from Adam, a pastor in the Church of Sweden; Ulrika, an attorney; and Stella, their daughter. Adam’s section kicks off the book, and once he learns about his child’s predicament, he’s willing to do anything to help her, even if it means forfeiting his good name as an honest and trustworthy man of God. Lying, destroying evidence—Adam rationalizes that he needs to do it all in order to make up for his perceived failings in the past. “Far too many times I had failed in my endeavors to be the world’s best spouse and father. Suddenly I had the chance to mend my ways. I would do anything I could to protect my family.”\n\nIt takes a while to learn exactly what happened, but eventually it becomes clear that 18-year-old Stella was seeing a much older man who may or may not have had a history of abusing his past partners. Stella is something of a wild child, while her lifelong best friend, Amina, is a straight arrow who is working toward her dream of becoming a doctor. Due to the friendship between their daughters, Amina’s parents and Adam and Ulrika have become close as well. However, all of those relationships begin to fracture once the police accuse Stella of killing Christopher Olsen.\n\nStella narrates the middle section of the book, and while she’s not exactly an unreliable narrator, a lot of facts are definitely kept from the reader. Finally, Ulrika, a lawyer herself, takes over in the last part; the novel turns into a courtroom drama as Stella is tried for murder.\n\nEdvarsson’s technique of having three narrators keeps us guessing, as we’re only seeing individual parts of the story until everything comes together at the very end. This book gives you a lot to think about, asking you to ponder what lengths you would go to in order to protect your own family—and what you would be willing to forgive.\n\nA few months ago, I started taking advanced Swedish courses over Zoom. The classes are usually held in person at the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis, far from my home in California. I grew up speaking Swedish, but I only visited Sweden during the summers; I was educated in the U.S., which meant that I never had any formal instruction on Swedish grammar. So now I’m finally learning about the past participle and different types of adverbs. (I’m the only non-Minnesotan student, which seems to indicate there wasn’t a huge, pent-up demand for high-level Swedish courses in other parts of the country.)\n\nThe class is currently reading a book by Annette Haaland, whose novels have yet to be released in English translation. Her series about a Stockholm pastor trying to tend to both her flock and her family has more in common with the gentle stories of Alexander McCall Smith than with the bloody crime novels that have come to define the Nordic noir genre. If I wanted to, I could easily fill this blog with reviews of Scandinavian crime fiction from January to December, since so much of it is being published here, but most of it is just too dark for me, especially now.\n\nThe next book my class will be reading is Fredrik Backman’s Folk med ångest, recently published in the U.S. as Anxious People. I had already started reading it in English before I learned I’d have to read it again in Swedish, but it’ll be interesting to see how I react to it the second time around. My feelings about it kept changing—sometimes it struck me as too slapsticky, too sentimental. “I felt like my heartstrings were being plucked a little too aggressively, and I began to resent it,” I wrote in my review of Backman’s Britt-Marie Was Here, and that happened here as well. But then the plot would take a surprising turn, or there would be a genuine laugh-out-loud moment.\n\nAnxious People is not a crime novel, but it deals with the aftermath of a crime. A failed bank robber, on the lam after ineptly attempting to steal 6,500 Swedish kronor (the equivalent of about $735) from a cash-free bank, ends up at an open house in an apartment building in an unnamed town. Everyone inside is taken hostage. Chapters flashing back to the hostage situation are interspersed with ones in which a father-and-son police duo try to interview the often-hostile witnesses and figure out what happened to the robber, who disappeared without a trace after everyone else inside had finally been released.\n\nAt first, I found many of the characters intensely irritating—the way the witnesses sass the policemen seemed a little over-the-top (“God, could you be any more annoying?” one asks the cop who is interviewing her, while another witness refers to him as an “idiot” who is “about as sharp as a wet box of cornflakes”)—but the plot is never predictable, and frequently, I actually did find myself feeling rather moved even when it seemed a trifle too manipulative. Backman has spoken publicly about his own battles with depression and how the suicide of a close friend affected his life, and I don’t for a moment doubt his sincerity. Right now, we are a nation of anxious people, and there’s something comforting in reading about a group of people who wind up banding together in order to lift each other up.\n\nIt’s possible that I just picked an inopportune time to read the second book in the Detective Varg series; I enjoyed the first one, but hoo boy, reading The Talented Mr. Varg was about as much fun as the time I got lost in a nondescript Stockholm suburb trying to find IKEA (true story).\n\nA send-up of brutal Swedish noir, the Varg novels chronicle the Department of Sensitive Crimes, a division of the Malmö police which deals with the sort of minor mysteries Mma Ramotswe investigates at the No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency. That’s obviously not a problem for me, as I’ve read all 20 of those books, but The Talented Mr. Varg spends too little time solving puzzles in favor of meandering digressions about Swedish-Russian relations, bridge construction, dog behavior, prostate problems, tattoos, electric razors…\n\n“Those razors. I have one. It’s waterproof, you know. Well, you can’t put the whole thing in the water—you wouldn’t put the body bit—but you can certainly put the heads under the tap. They have a tap symbol on them, you see, and that’s how you tell whether your electric razor is waterproof or not.” This is said by a colleague of Varg’s known for “his strange world of rambling association,” but all too often, the whole book feels like a series of rambling associations.\n\nThe polar opposite of Varg is Cara Black’s Three Hours in Paris, which provides pulse-pounding excitement from first page to last. Here I must insert a disclaimer stating that Cara is a friend of mine, someone I would regularly meet up with for espresso in the Before Times, but I’m confident I would have enjoyed this book even if I hadn’t known her to be a supremely kind, generous and thoughtful person.\n\nIn the book’s first 25 pages, American sniper Kate Rees loses her naval officer husband and baby daughter in a Luftwaffe attack (she met her husband, a Welshman, while she was studying in Paris, and moved with him to the Orkney Islands). Vowing revenge on the Germans, Kate’s incredible skill as a markswoman, thanks to a youth spent learning to hunt on a ranch in rural Oregon, cause her to be recruited by British intelligence. She is sent to Paris to assassinate Hitler. She fails, obviously—this book doesn’t take place in an alternate timeline where Hitler is bumped off in 1940—but there are still 325 pages to go, and there are thrills, spills and close calls aplenty. Fans of spy novels, World War II history, Paris, or strong and resourceful female heroines will all find something to like in this book.\n\nOccasionally, a book comes along that I feel uniquely well-qualified to review. Such is definitely the case with The Department of Sensitive Crimes, the first novel in Alexander McCall Smith’s new series featuring Swedish detective Ulf Varg. Not only have I been reading the author’s books for many years now, but because I was born in Sweden and have spent a lot of time there, I felt I would have a good sense for how authentically Swedish the characters and settings seem to be.\n\nAnd the answer is… not very. The book is set in Malmö, which is located in southern Sweden, just across the Öresund Bridge from Copenhagen. I will admit that while I have crossed that bridge, I have never actually visited Malmö, but really, he could have chosen Karlstad or Mora or Göteborg and it wouldn’t have made much difference. There is a plot point that requires Varg to make a crucial discovery at a nude beach, and it is probably true that the province of Skåne has more beaches than other parts of the country. But otherwise, there’s no flavor of the city itself.\n\nCurious about Zimbabwe-born Scotsman McCall Smith’s connections to Sweden, I found this article, which states that the author “has visited Sweden on numerous book tours” and is a big fan of Swedish crime shows. He calls his new series “Scandi-blanc,” the opposite of the Scandinavian noir of authors like Henning Mankell, Lars Kepler and Jo Nesbø. “The basic idea for doing Scandi-blanc came from the general enthusiasm that people have for the Scandinavian noir. I loved the idea of really deflating the body count aspect of crime fiction, where everything is so ghastly that people are chopping one another to bits… there are no bodies in these, [they’re] just really ridiculous. It’s all tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at these stock images of Scandinavian crime.”\n\nReaders of McCall Smith’s Botswana-set No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency will be familiar with the kind of low-stakes crimes investigated by Varg and his colleagues in the Sensitive Crimes Department of the Malmö Criminal Investigation Authority. A man is stabbed in the back of the knee; there are mysterious goings-on at a resort hotel; a college student invents a boyfriend to get her friends to stop asking her about her love life, but when she decides to make him disappear, one of her roommates reports the matter to the police, who must then investigate the case of a missing person who doesn’t actually exist.\n\nI only found one really glaring error: the aforementioned college student was raised by a single mother, who was not able to pursue higher education herself because “she simply could not afford to pay for several years of childcare” along with her studies. Sweden has had free or heavily subsidized childcare available since 1975, so that shouldn’t have been an issue for a girl born in the 1990s.\n\nAvid readers of Scandinavian crime fiction may spot some references to other authors’ work, intentional or not: for instance, there’s already a famous Scandinavian detective named Varg, Norwegian author Gunnar Staalesen’s private eye Varg Veum. The Department of Sensitive Crimes is a bit like Copenhagen’s Department Q in Jussi Adler-Olsen’s series, and Skåne was where Henning Mankell set his Kurt Wallander mysteries.\n\nStill, despite these nitpicks, I’d happily read another one of these gentle, comically absurd mysteries, and while Ulf Varg is no Martin Beck, he does have a melancholy, reflective side: “He thought of all the ways that so many people felt about life. Life was a matter of regret—how could it be anything else? We knew that we would lose the things we loved; we knew that sooner or later we would lose everything, and beyond that was a darkness, a state of non-being that we found hard to imagine, let alone accept.”\n\nWhen I was a child, I remember driving past the local cemetery with my grandmother and she’d often make a comment along the lines of, “I have so many friends in there.” At the time, it struck me as a terribly morbid thing to say, but now that I’m older and have lost some people who meant a great deal to me, I understand. My grandmother joined her friends a few years ago, so I can never tell her that I now know how she felt.\n\nDoris, the protagonist of Sofia Lundberg’s The Red Address Book, is 96 years old, and was inspired by a real person: Lundberg’s great-aunt Doris, whose address book she discovered after her aunt had passed away. “She had crossed most of her friends’ names out and had written the word ‘dead’ next to them,” recalled Lundberg in an interview published on her book’s Amazon page. “It broke my heart to realize how lonely she must have felt. Her death was very painful for me, as we were so close. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.”\n\nThe fictional Doris is paging through the address book she received as a tenth-birthday gift. The crossed-out names inspire her to write down her recollections for her great-niece Jenny, who lives in California with her husband and three children, half a world away from Doris’ Stockholm apartment. Doris’ father died when she was a young girl, and at the age of 13, her mother sent her off to work as a servant in the home of a wealthy woman. After a year, her employer, Dominique, moves to Paris, bringing Doris along with her. But that is only the beginning of Doris’ adventures, which will eventually lead her back to Stockholm.\n\nThere was a lot in this book that hit me pretty hard—I am sure that The Red Address Book may strike many readers as too sentimental by half, but as for me, I was reading it in the waiting area of a Toyota dealership as my car was being worked on, and at one point I had to get up and go outside because I felt self-conscious about the tears in my eyes. It’s an international sensation, published in over 30 countries so far, and I can see why, as it deals with universal topics like life, love and loneliness. Doris’ life story kept me captivated from start to finish, and I suspect many American readers will embrace this book once it is published here next month.\n\nThe Red Address Book will be published on Jan. 8, 2019. Thanks to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for the advance copy (via NetGalley).\n\nWhy would a pair of Communist Party members choose to write a book with a policeman as protagonist? Maj Sjöwall has explained that she and Per Wahlöö began writing a series of crime novels because “we wanted to describe society from our left point of view. Per had written political books, but they’d only sold 300 copies. We realized that people read crime and through the stories we could show the reader that under the official image of welfare-state Sweden there was another layer of poverty, criminality and brutality.”\n\nIn The Abominable Man, Sjöwall (who now says she identifies as a Socialist) and the late Wahlöö for the first time in their series present a truly unflinching look at what happens to a society when the police are allowed to basically get away with anything. The novel, which was originally published in 1971, will seem eerily timely to anyone who’s aware of the many well-known cases here in the U.S. where police have not been held accountable for killing civilians. After a police captain is murdered in a particularly grisly fashion, Martin Beck and a colleague sift through a stack of complaints alleging police brutality that had been submitted to Stockholm’s Justice Department Ombudsman. All of them yielded the same results: “Inspector Nyman dismisses the suggestion that he or anyone else mistreated the complainant… No action.”\n\nIf one of those complainants decided to take matters into their own hands and enact some vigilante justice, there are a lot of suspects to choose from, since Nyman was known to be a violent bully. Martin Beck’s friend and fellow policeman Kollberg, who knew Nyman when they both served in the army, tells Beck that “he’s probably committed hundreds of outrages of one kind or another. Toward subordinates and toward arrestees. I’ve heard various stories over the years… A man like Nyman always sees to it that there are policemen ready to take an oath that he hasn’t done anything… the kind of men who are already so indoctrinated they figure they’re only doing what loyalty demands.”\n\nKollberg, who refuses to carry a gun, has already begun to express doubts about continuing to serve on the force, but Martin Beck finds himself confronting certain truths about his job for the first time in this book. A report on the comparative dangers of police work versus other professions revealed that “police work wasn’t a bit more dangerous than any other profession… The number of injured policeman was negligible when compared with the number of people annually mistreated by the police.” (Construction workers, lumberjacks and taxi drivers are all jobs cited by the authors, and almost 50 years later, statistics bear out that people who work in those professions are still in more danger of dying on the job than police.)\n\nLest you fear that The Abominable Man is a dull bit of leftist anti-police propaganda, be assured that it’s one of the most pulse-pounding entries in the series, climaxing with a thrilling confrontation with an armed and dangerous man intent on revenge. And the authors don’t shy away from describing the loneliness, long hours and threats from hostile members of the public that police officers confront. Sjöwall and Wahlöö always wrote with great compassion about police and civilians alike.\n\nThe Locked Room continues the authors’ critique of Swedish society and the police force, as well as presenting a pair of “impossible” mysteries that hearken back to the Golden Age: a locked-room murder and a bank robbery where the witnesses’ accounts are all completely different. Martin Beck is back on the job after taking some time off to recover from injuries sustained in The Abominable Man. He now suffers from recurring nightmares and has been told by his doctors to quit smoking (the horror!). The mysterious death of Karl Svärd—“a most interesting case,” says Kollberg—is presented to Beck as something he can mull over in his spare time. Svärd was found dead in his apartment, with the windows shut and numerous bolts and locks secured from the inside; it took overwhelming force for the police to gain access. He had been shot, so one would think it was a suicide, but no gun was found on the premises.\n\nThe other case involves a bank robbery where a customer was murdered by the gun-wielding perpetrator during the course of the crime. Witnesses say the robber was definitely a woman—unless it was a man in a wig. And she definitely escaped in a car—unless she got away on foot. The police have very little to go on, and meanwhile, Stockholm banks are under siege. “A year ago there had been a drive against people passing bad checks… The National Police Board objected to checks being accepted as legal tender,” and the resulting influx of cash led to bank robberies, muggings and assaults. (It’s true that Sweden got rid of personal checks many years ago, but now they’ve gotten rid of cash, too.)\n\nThe Locked Room is one of the longer books in the series and it’s pretty heavy on the anti-capitalist and anti-police rhetoric. Also, it seems like most of the Martin Beck books contain at least one reference to poor pensioners having to eat cat food to get by. Was this ever really a thing? I don’t doubt that there are still struggling seniors in Sweden, but my research into this (i.e. 10 minutes of Googling variations on pensionärer + kattmat) seems to indicate that it was something of a myth.\n\nAs always, things are changing in Stockholm, and not for the better; the new National Police Board building is under construction, and “from this ultramodern colossus… the police would extend their tentacles in every direction and hold the dispirited citizens of Sweden in an iron grip. At least some of them. After all, they couldn’t all emigrate or commit suicide.” But as the two investigations progress, some unexpected rays of sunshine emerge in Martin Beck’s life, providing an unexpected tinge of optimism as we head into the final two books of the series. Will Sjöwall and Wahlöö give their protagonist a few hard-won moments of joy? Considering that the title of the next book is Cop Killer, I’m not holding my breath.\n\nLet’s talk about mashed potatoes. If you are an American, you probably think of them as a delicious side dish served with steak, meatloaf or fried chicken. But in Sweden, a popular combination is korv med mos—hot dogs with mashed potatoes.\n\nKorv is an ubiquitous street food, usually sold from free-standing kiosks instead of carts, as is common in the U.S. The accompaniments on offer would most likely confuse American visitors. Shrimp salad is a thing a lot of Swedes put on their hot dogs. And so are mashed potatoes. As you can see in the illustration, you can get scoops of potatoes on a hot dog in a bun (korv med bröd, or with bread), for the true carb-a-holic; inside a rolled-up flatbread; or on a plate with a couple of bun-less wieners.\n\nWhy do I offer you this culinary/cultural lesson? Because it’s important in understanding the original title of Murder at the Savoy, the sixth book in Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö’s Martin Beck series of police procedurals. That title is Polis Polis Potatismos, which translates to “Police Police Mashed Potatoes.” (My reviews of the first five books can be found here and here.) This week, I decided to do something different and read the original Swedish novel as well as the English version. I wanted to explore how the translators dealt with something that is essentially un-translatable.\n\nThe translation is credited to Amy and Ken Knoespel. This is the only book in the series that they worked on (perhaps they were exhausted after trying to figure out how to get around having to explain the title). Ken is now a professor at Georgia Tech. According to LinkedIn, Amy spent much of her career at accounting firm KPMG. How the two of them came to translate this book is something I was unable to discover online. It appears to be the only novel either of them ever worked on.\n\nSo what in the world do mashed potatoes have to do with cops? “Polis polis potatismos” is a take-off on “Polis polis potatisgris” (“Police, police, potato pig”), which was reportedly chanted at anti-police protests in the 1960s. In the novel, the bumbling cops Kristiansson and Kvant are tasked with apprehending a suspect landing at Arlanda airport in Stockholm; however, they fail to get there on time because they felt compelled to deal with “a man riding by on a bicycle [who] shouted insults at us.” Further questioning reveals that the duo were actually taunted by the cyclist’s three-year-old son, who exclaimed “Daddy, this little pig” as Kvant was eating a hot dog.\n\nIn the Swedish novel, the child cries “Polis polis potatismos” (“he is just three years old and hasn’t learned to speak properly yet”). Naturally, Kvant was eating korv med mos.\n\nThis delightfully absurd twist is much more fun than “this little pig,” but how do you convey that in English without including several paragraphs’ worth of footnotes? It would interfere with the amusement of those just wanting to read a good crime story. But it’s a shame that English-language readers miss out on something so funny and significant to the plot.\n\nI could quibble with a few other minor things, like the way Detective Inspector Per Månsson’s favorite cocktail, the Gripenberger, is described as a mixture of gin and “grape soda”—in the original, he’s drinking gin with grapetonic, which is something very different than the sweet purple drink that the American translation brings to mind. Grapetonic is a grapefruit-flavored carbonated beverage, so the Gripenberger is actually just a variation on the normal gin and tonic.\n\nBut on the whole, the translation is fine, and Murder at the Savoy is significant as being the first book in the 10-volume series where the authors’ left-wing political leanings are well and truly on display. The murder victim is Viktor Palmgren, a businessman who is, in the words of Swedish crime writer Arne Dahl’s introduction, “given virtually no redeeming or even human qualities… The extremely predictable depiction of the capitalist circles criticized by the book is unrelenting.” However, as a police procedural, it is very enjoyable, as Martin Beck, Månsson, Lennart Kollberg, and the other by-now-familiar characters on the Malmö and Stockholm forces puzzle through sparse clues in order to discover who shot Palmgren. (Of course, if Kvant hadn’t been eating that hot dog, they would have had a much easier time of it. But as is often the case in the real world, one small human screw-up can have massive ramifications.)\n\nTo those of us familiar with today’s Scandinavia, as opposed to how things were in 1970 when this book was first published, the milieu of the book often seems unrecognizable; there’s a mention of how polluted the water is (this was certainly true back then, but strict environmental laws have made a huge difference over the past 30 years or so) and Stockholm is described as “an asphalt jungle, where drug addiction and sexual perversion ran more rampant than ever.” As someone who’s spent a lot of time there over the years, I can attest to the fact that it is a clean, safe city, albeit one that constantly seems to be under construction and, much like my current home of the San Francisco Bay Area, suffers from a perennial housing shortage and sky-high cost of living.\n\nSome things never change, though, like the national taste for hot dogs accompanied by a few scoops of mashed potatoes."
