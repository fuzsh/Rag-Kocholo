        "text": "My rating: 3 of 5 stars\n\nMaj Sjowall and Per Wahloo were a Swedish husband and wife writing team, who, between 1965 and 1975, published a series of ten books featuring the detective Martin Beck. In many ways, this was an iconic series, forerunner and progenitor of some of the most popular Scandinavian mystery/thriller series of today. Writers like Henning Mankell, Jo Nesbo, and Stieg Larson certainly owe a debt to the Sjowall/Wahloo team.\n\nOver the years, I have seen references to this series in reviews that I've read of other books. Finally, I decided it was time for me to get to know the works and to find out why others spoke of them so reverentially.\n\nThis Kindle edition of Roseanna that I read had an introduction written by Henning Mankell, in which he acknowledged his debt to the earlier writers. (Mr. Wahloo is now deceased, but Ms. Sjowall is still with us - just not writing mysteries anymore.) He also mentions the influence of American detective fiction on the Sjowall/Wahloo team, especially the books of Ed McBain.\n\nBut as I was reading this first book in the series, I had to wonder if perhaps they were influenced by that Stone Age television detective series Dragnet with Jack Webb. Jack Webb's character, Joe Friday, was always famous for wanting \"Just the facts, ma'am\" from his overly loquacious witnesses. That is the feeling that I get from this book.\n\nIt is a police procedural that follows step by excruciating step as Inspector Martin Beck and his team attempt to solve the murder of an unidentified woman who was raped, strangled, and then her naked body thrown into a lake where it was later brought up by a dredger.\n\nThe investigation proceeds at a snail's pace as the investigators attempt to identify a body that had no identification and which no one has reported missing. The first break in the case finally comes from an unexpected source - the American embassy. It seems that an American tourist traveling in Europe has not returned as expected to her home in Lincoln, Nebraska. That tourist was a librarian named Roseanna and the investigation of her death becomes an international effort.\n\nEven with her identification though, there are still no clues as to how or why she wound up in the lake. The second break comes when the investigators are able to determine that she was a passenger on a tourist boat.\n\nAnd so it goes. Bit by bit the investigators build their case, eliminating some possibilities and following up leads on others, until finally some pictures taken by some of the tourists on the boat and Beck's intuition lead them to the solution to the case and to their killer. It is six-and-a-half months after the woman's death.\n\nMartin Beck is a typically morose Scandinavian detective. (Are all of these guys depressed?) One can certainly see the prototype of Mankell's Kurt Wallander, for example, in Beck. Martin Beck always seems to be sick or worried about his health. He has a wife and family but he is too obsessed by his work to spend much time with them or even to relate to them as a normal husband and father might. He is driven to solve murders. Nothing else seems to matter to him.\n\nIt was very interesting to read this story from the '60s. Everybody used public telephones. There were no cell phones, no computers, no tiny tape recorders. And Sweden was very different from today. There were few immigrants and no constant flow of refugees as is very much the case today. It was a much more homogeneous society.\n\nI enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the nine which follow. I just have one silly quibble. Throughout the book, the writers always refer to their detective as Martin Beck. He's never just Martin or just Beck. It irritated me a bit after a while. Did they feel they had to continually remind us of his full name? Were they afraid we would forget it? What's up with that anyway?\n\nView all my reviews\n\nPoetry Sunday: Don't Hesitate by Mary Oliver\n\nHow about we share another Mary Oliver poem? After all, you can never have too many of those. In this one, the poet seems to acknowledge that it is often hard to simply live in and enjoy the moment, perhaps because we are afraid it can't last. She urges us to give in to that moment and fully experience the joy. Although \"much can never be redeemed, still, life has some possibility left.\" Don't Hesitate by Mary Oliver If you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy, donâ€™t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plenty of lives and whole towns destroyed or about to be. We are not wise, and not very often kind. And much can never be redeemed. Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps this is its way of fighting back, that sometimes something happens better than all the riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, thatâ€™s often the case. Anyway, whatever it is, donâ€™t be afraid of its plenty. Joy is no\n\nOverboard by Sara Paretsky: A review\n\nThis is the twenty-first novel in the V.I. Warshawski series that Sara Paretsky first began publishing in 1982 with Indemnity Only . I've read them all. I've been a Warshawski fan since the beginning. So for forty years, Paretsky has been writing these books and I've been reading them. And one thing that I have enjoyed about them is that V.I. has aged through them, if not exactly forty years then at least enough to simulate reality. In this latest book, V.I. may be feeling the weight of those years a bit but her passion for justice is undiminished. As often in her cases, a teenager is involved. V.I., the hardboiled detective, has a certifiable soft spot for teenagers. This time it is a teenage girl who V.I.'s dog Mitch finds when they are on a walk around Lake Michigan. The girl is injured and unconscious and has only a faint pulse when V.I. checks her. She calls an ambulance and the girl is taken to the hospital after uttering only one word which seems to make no s\n\nThe Investigator by John Sandford: A review\n\nI have read a few of John Sandford's books in the Prey series featuring Lucas Davenport. This book is a literal offspring of that series. It's the first in a series featuring Davenport's adopted daughter Letty Davenport. Letty is in her mid-20s and a graduate of Stanford. She works for a U.S. senator named Christopher Colles in a desk job but she's bored with her assignments. Then the senator offers her a chance to go into the field as a liaison between his office and the Department of Homeland Security. In her first assignment in that position, she is sent to Texas along with DHS investigator John Kaiser to try to find out what is happening in regard to thefts of crude oil. The senator is not so concerned about the lost oil but wants to know where the money from its sale is going. Who is selling the oil and what they are doing with the profits? The suspicion is that a particularly nasty militia group led by a woman is involved. Letty and Kaiser head out to Texas, de"
