        "text": "Swedish writer and journalist, who published with his wife Maj Sjöwall the widely translated books of Martin Beck and his colleagues at the Central Bureau of Investigation in Stockholm. The series was an attempt to take a critical, Marxian look at the Swedish society within the framework of a detective novel. The critic and awarded mystery writer H.R.F. Keating selected the first volume, Roseanna (1965), in 1987 for his list of the one hundred best crime and mystery novels. All of the Martin Beck books have been filmed. In addtion, a number TV films have been based on the characters the couple created.\n\n\"Elofsson was following the normal procedure. He had grabbed the boy's jacket with both hands. The next step was to pull the victim closer and drive his right knee into the man's groin. And that would take care of that. The same way he had done it so many times before. Without firearms.\" (from Cop Killer, translated from the Swedish by Thomas Teal, 1975)\n\nPer Wahlöö was born in Göteborg, the son of Waldemar and Karin (Svensson) Wahlöö. After graduating from the University of Lund in 1946, he worked as a journalist, covering criminal and social issues for a number of newspapers and magazines. In the 1950s Wahlöö was engaged in radical political causes, activities that resulted in his deportation from Franco's Spain in 1957. Before becoming a full-time writer, he wrote a number of television and radio plays, and was managing editor of several magazines.\n\nAs a novelist Wahlöö made his debut with Himmelsgeten (1959), which was followed by others dealing with abuses of power and the dark side of the society.\n\nWahlöö's science fiction thrillers include Mord på 31 (1965, The Thirty-first Floor), which was filmed as Kamikaze 1989, starring the director Rainer Werner Fassbinder in his final screen role. The story was set in a futuristic Germany. Stälspranget (1968, Steep Spring) depicted a deadly plague in an unnamed European country. The protagonist in these both novels was Chief Inspector Jensen. Generalerna (1965), a trial novel set in a military state, reflected Wahlöö's views on dictatorship. Lastbilen (1962) was published in the United States as A Necessary Action and in Britain as The Lorry. Uppdraget (1963), set in a Latin American country, gained an international success. It was translated into English under the title The Assignment.\n\nWahlöö's first work as a scriptwriter was Flygplan saknas (1965, Aircraft Missing), co-written with Arvid Rundberg, directed by Per Gunvall, and starring Olle Johansson, Birgit Nordin and Runar Martholm. With the veteran film director Arne Mattsson he made three films between 1965 and 1967, beginning from an adaptation of Jan Ekström's crime novel Morianerna. British censors cut two minutes from the original release, which contains nudity, voyerism, a psychopath, and a rape of maid.\n\nIn 1961 Wahlöö met Maj Sjöwall when they were working for magazines published by the same company. At that time Wahlöö was married, Sjöwall was a single parent of a daughter and already twice divorced. Both were members of the Communist Party. Although Wahlöö didn't want to cheat his wife, they began to meet after work, and eventually became lovers, but never officially married. Until 1969, the couple lived in Stockholm, but they kept contact with the KRW (Kronkvist-Rooke-Wahlöö) group from Malmö, where they lived and worked from 1969.\n\nTheir carefully planned crime novel series, with the undertitle \"roman om ett brott\" (the story of a crime), was created in the evenings, after the children had been put to bed. Starting from Roseanna (1965), the project ended ten years and ten books later with Terroristerna (1975). According to Wahlöö, their intention was to \"use the crime novel as a scalpel cutting open the belly of the ideological pauperized and morally debatable so-called welfare state of the bourgeois type.\" ('Wahlöö, Per (1926-75 and Maj Sjövall (1935-)' by Bo Lundin, in Twentieth-Century Crime and Mystery Writers, second edition, edited by John M. Reilly, 1985, p. 947) The narrative focused on realistic police routine and teamwork.\n\nThe first three novels, Roseanna, The Man Who Went Up in Smoke (1966), and The Man on the Balcony (1967), were straightforward police procedural novels, written in reportal, spare style, similar to that of Georges Simenon. They introduced the central characters – the solid, methodical detective Martin Beck with failing marriage, ex-paratrooper Lennart Kollberg, who hates violence and refuses to carry a gun, Gunvald Larsson, a Mike Hammer-type in police forces and a drop-out from high society – Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: \"Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat\"– Einar Rönn from the rural north of Sweden, and patrolmen Kristiansson and Kvant, the necessary comic pair.\n\nBeck considers himself \"stubborn and logical, and completely calm\". He lives in a small apartment in Stockholm with his wife, Inga, and two children. In the following books Beck's relationship with his wife deteriorates, and he begins an affair with the liberal Rhea Nilsen. Larsson's character, played by Mikael Persbrandt in TV films, made a gradual change from a misogynist into a sensitive man with a heart of gold deep down.\n\nRoseanna, a story of rape-murder of an American girl, Roseanna Mc Graw, whose body in found in a Swedish canal, was not an immediate success. Some reviewers felt that the novel was too dark and brutal, but its publication in English translation in 1967 sparked the interest of a worldwide audience. \"A fine example of the police procedural,\" said H.R.F. Keating. \"So, as one puts the book down, one is apt to think a good story, and interesting, but also, in the words of the newspaper advertisement, 'all human life is there'.\" ('Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö: Roseanna,' in Crime & Mystery: The 100 Best Books by H.R.F. Keating, 1987, p. 138)\n\nUntil The Story of a Crimeseries Swedish detective novels had been apolitical, conservative or occasionally liberal, but Sjöwall and Wahlöö managed to revive interest in a genre generally overlooked by leftist intellectuals. Readers were ready to accept their new approach, the introduction of political ideas as part of crime fiction. The theme of class conflict was not defined right from the beginning, but its weight grew step-by-step, in the context of social problems the novel exposed.In the final volume the foundations of the welfare state start to shake. The murder of the prime minister signals the end of the Social-Democratic project of Folkhemmet (the people's home).\n\nThe Laughing Policeman (1968), about the investigation of the murder of eight occupants of a Stockholm bus, was adapted to screen in 1973, directed by Stuart Rosenberg, starring Walter Matthau, Bruce Dern, and Lou Gossett. \"Police movies so often depend on sheer escapist action that it's fun to find a good one,\" said Roger Ebert in his review. ('The Laughing Policeman' by Roger Ebert, December 24, 1973, RogerEbert.com) Swedish critics were unanimous in that the film had very little to do with the novel, and there was little left of Sjöwall and Wahlöö's original point of view. The story, set in San Francisco, shared its Bay area locale with Dirty Harry (1971), but was otherwise more downbeat.\n\nBy coincidence, Bo Widerberg, who made a film adaptation of the novel The Abominable Man, entitled Mannen på taket (1976), had lived in Malmö in the same building than Wahlöö's first wife Inger Wahlöö. The large-scale action scenes were shot in everyday settings, to illuminate what it means when violence takes place in the midst of a supposedly safe community \"A little boy riding a creaking bicycle approaches two gunned-down police officers and asks why they are lying in the steet. A girl screams in terror when she catches sight of a couple of wounded policemen. Were it not for one of their blood-soaked hands gleaming scarlet red in the sunshine, one could think they were resting.\" ('The Criminal and Society in Mannen på taket' by Daniel Brodén, in Swedish Film: An Introduction and a Reader, edited by Mariah Larsson & Anders Marklund, 2005, p. 203) The killer is a former police officer, himself a victim of the conditions of the society. Politically, Widerberg was a social democrat, and his view of the society was not as acid as it was in the book.\n\nAt the end of The Locked Room (1972), Sjöwall and Wahlöö show their sympathy towards a bank robber; however, they abhor sexual violence. The novel nods to the puzzles of John Dickson Carr. In Cop Killer (1974) Lennart Kollberg writes his resignation: a socialist, he don't want to work for the system anymore. The suspected cop killer of the title, a teenager in a stolen car, is chased across Sweden.\n\nEspecially in the last novel, The Terrorists, police officers, and criminals doing their own thing, at the mercy of forces they cannot control. – Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: \"Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. . . . All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\"– The authors openly side with Rebecka Lind, \"the novel's holy fool and sacrifical lamb, cast adrift by a society that proclaims to care for her then preys upon her as soon as her isolation leads to financial need.\" ('Introduction' by Denis Lehane, The Terrorists, translated from the Swedish by Joan Tate, 2010, p. vii) Rebecka kills the book's Swedish prime minister – this is passed shortly, perhaps a statement in itself. \"No one in the novel is greatly affected by the death of the prime minister. There is no suggestion of the convulsion of grief and self-reproach that affected the country when Palme was assassinated.\" (Fishing In Utopia: Sweden And The Future That Disappeared by Andrew Brown, 2009, p. 128)\n\nBeck feels alienated from his work and doubts about staying in the police force. His unhappy marriage is over. On the other hand, Beck don't have any more stomach aches. – Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels: \"Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views, and conception, in one word, man's consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?\"– A telling sign of times: Chairman Mao poster get mentioned in the text. The novel ends with the lines:\n\n\"The trouble with you, Martin, is just that you've got the wrong job, At the wrong time. In the wrong part of the world. In the wrong system.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Roghly,\" said Kollberg. \"My turn to start? The I say X—X as in Marx.\"\n\n(The Terrorists, translated from the Swedish by Joan Tate, 2010, p. 280)\n\nThe novel was published after Wahlöö's death in Stockholm on June 23, 1975. Though a joint venture, this volume was mostly written by Wahlöö, who was already very ill and knew he was going to die. Doctors had said that his lungs were full of water, before realizing that his pancreas had burst. After returning from Màlaga, Wahlöö took very strong morphin tablets, fell into coma, and never woke up again.\n\nWahlöö's other works include translations into Swedish of some Ed McBain's 87th Precinct procedural novels and Noel Behn's political thriller The Kremlin Letter, filmed by John Huston in 1970. With Sjöwall he also edited the literature magazine Peripeo, and wrote a comparative study of police methods in Sweden, the United States, Russia, and England.\n\nThe English mystery writer Julian Symons recalled Wahlöö as an extrme Left-winger whose interest in British foorball was passionate. \"He wrote two novels which combine the moral symbolism of Dürrenmatt with a flavour of Orwellian fantasy. Murder on the Thirty-first Floor (1966) and The Steel Spring (1970) make their points about dictatorship and paternalism through the medium of crime. . . . The books that Wahlöö, as Per and not Peter, wrote in collabaration with Maj Sjöwall (1935-) were less ambitious and more successful.\" (Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel: A History by Julian Symons, 1985, p. 182)\n\nFor further reading: 'Roman om en forbrydelse' - Sjöwall/Wahlöö's verk og virkelighed by Ejgil Søholm (1976); Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection, edited by Chris Steinbrunner and Otto Penzler (1976); 'The Police in Society: The Novels of Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö' by Frank Occhiogrosso, in The Armchair Detective, no. 2 (1979); The Police Procedural by George Dove (1982); Lystmord, edited by Jørgen Holmgaard and Bo Tao Michaëlis (1984); Polemical Pulps by J.
