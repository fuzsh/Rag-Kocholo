        "text": "“For three months he hadn’t really thought of anything but this. The moment when the investigation would really begin. It had been like trying to get out of a swamp in coal-black darkness and now he was feeling the first solid piece of ground under his feet.”\n\nIf you are a reader (and you must be because you are here reading this), you know what it’s like. You read one book and you often are led to another, and this is exactly what happened to me with the Swedish mystery novel, Roseanna by Maj Siowall and Per Wahloo. A friend sent me a copy of Henning Mankell’s book Faceless Killers, the first in the Wallander detective novel series. Then one thing led to another and I bought Roseanna.\n\nMy copy, published by Vintage Crime, includes an introduction by Henning Mankell. I’m glad I read it as Mankell explains how husband and wife team, Siowall and Wahloo changed the face of the mystery novel in Sweden and he asserts that they were a tremendous influence on him. Manning argues that “their intent was never to write crime stories as a form of entertainment…. They realized that there was a huge unexplored territory in which crime novels could form the framework for stories containing social criticism.” And Manning points out that one of the authors’ methods was to recreate “meticulous and credible descriptions of various institutions and structures within Swedish society.”\n\nAfter finishing Roseanna so soon after finishing Mankell’s Faceless Killers, I can see the connections between the two books and the authors’ style.\n\nRoseanna begins with the discovery of the body of a young naked woman in the Gota canal in the city of Motala. The woman has been sexually assaulted and strangled and then tossed into the canal. Since the canal is a busy thoroughfare , there are no immediate leads, and this is where First Detective Inspector with the National Police, Martin Beck steps in. Based in Stockholm, Beck and his men are sent to Motala to help the local police solve the crime.\n\nBeck and his men circulate photos of the girl fully expecting someone to step forward and claim her, but no one does, and of course, this raises the question, how can someone disappear and no one notice their absence?\n\nOn the positive side, Martin Beck is an engaging protagonist, strong enough to support a series of novels, and it’s immediately clear that Beck is an unhappily married, troubled soul who finds compensation in his work. While his wife is an annoying character, there’s the sense that Beck and his wife have just gradually grown apart over the years. Beck buries his unhappiness in his work, chain-smoking, fighting off colds, and often too unsettled to eat. While his wife flutters and fusses around him, Beck just seems to want to be left alone.\n\nThe crime itself is solved very slowly–and this reminds me of Mankell’s style. It takes months to identify the victim, but Beck never really forgets the case or the victim, and the painful increments in which the crime is solved probably is indicative of real-life. The book recreates the methodical approaches used to dig up clues and gather witnesses. Interviews between the police and those who knew the victim are included, as well as transcripts from press conferences in Q&A fashion. The pacing, which was problematic in Manning’s novel, here complements the novel’s atmosphere. Beck’s patient, dogged quest serves to commit us to the solution of the crime.\n\nWhile the pacing of the novel complemented the tale, on the negative side, some part of the novels were trite and dated. In one spot, Beck says he feels “sorry” for the victim; in another spot, he refers to the dead girl as “poor little friend, whoever you are.” For me, these sentiments didn’t fit. After all, feeling “sorry” for a murder victim seems to be the understatement of the year.\n\nAnd then there’s the issue of the girl’s body. Apart from a couple of descriptions of her pubic hair, there’s also a few comments about her genitals: according to one of the detectives, “her sex organ was well-developed,” while yet another notes that the victim’s “downfall” was her “big crotch.” These unfortunate descriptions were distracting and were so invasive I started to think the victim was some sort of mutant, and once that image was in my mind, it was impossible to get it out."
