New licensing model

The PRTG Enterprise Monitor subscription is based on the number of sensors per year; this means you can set up unlimited PRTG servers. No initial investment, all subscription based, OpEx instead of CapEx, with flexible scaling options.

The ITOps Board

It provides the architectural flexibility to scale horizontally, ensuring maximum performance combined with a central overview including the ITOps Board. The flexible annual per-sensor subscription, OpEx-based cost model scales with you as you grow. Just like every PRTG license, PRTG Enterprise Monitor includes the entire monitoring functionality - no addons, no modules.

Integrations

PRTG integrates with analysis tools using APIs and pre-defined templates. It acts as a data collector and early warning system, helping to identify failures and indicate where deeper analysis is needed. Close partnerships with mainstream IT vendors and established players in the ITOM market make for seamless integration.

License details

If you are in one of these situations, try PRTG

Case 1: You are looking for a new tool

Many administrators are yet to own a network monitoring tool. What often happens is that networks gradually begin to expand but administrators have other things to worry about which are more pressing. The important yet rarely urgent issue of network monitoring is therefore pushed into the background. Until suddenly a problem arises - such as a massive system failure - sparking a time-consuming search for the bug. Usually, a mad dash to find freeware or free tools begins.

The advantages of PRTG: Getting started is easy and risk-free

PRTG provides for flexibility when getting started. The trial version is for free. 100 sensors stay free forever. Administrators can therefore get to know our network monitoring tool without having to pay or worrying about a contract coming to an end. If you wish to work with more sensors, it's a cinch to supplement PRTG. PRTG is installed in just two minutes and customized in a few short hours.

Case 2: You are looking for a different tool

As administrators, you already have a network monitoring tool. But many tools on the market are complex and difficult to maintain. In no time at all, the tool is no longer up-to-date, because new network elements are no longer incorporated into it. Sometimes changes in personnel occur - and there is consequently nobody on staff who knows how to get the tool working quickly.

The advantages of PRTG: A faster and easier transition

The delightful intuitive network monitoring tool PRTG features a number of preconfigurations, including nearly 200 sensors and ready-made device templates. In addition, an Auto Discovery feature automatically searches the network and installs sensors. A migration is therefore possible in a matter of a few hours. The transition is easy and can take place a lot faster than getting the hang of the previous, cumbersome tool. Alert features are included, and licenses are modifiable as the situation requires.

Case 3: You are looking for a centralized tool

As administrators, you already have tools for your network monitoring, analysis, and diagnostics. Your problem: you use a mishmash of several distinct tools. As administrators, you have to learn the ropes of many different tools, all of which have their own strengths and weaknesses. And you need to keep an eye on - and maintain - all of the tools at the same time. This costs time and energy.

The advantages of PRTG: Finally one clear overview

PRTG is a centralized tool for the entire network for which an administrator is responsible. All it takes is a quick look at its dashboard or app. Administrators who use PRTG say they finally have some peace of mind. Gone are the days of always having a guilty conscience or feeling uneasy because information is missing.
