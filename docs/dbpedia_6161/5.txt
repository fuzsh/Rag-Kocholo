On the Paessler website, you find two different installers for PRTG, a public download for the Freeware, Special, and Trial editions, and a login link to download the commercial editions (which is only available for paying customers).

Downloading the Freeware or Trial Edition

Please download the latest publicly available file from the Paessler website. You can also request a trial key there, which must be entered during installation:

Note: Every Freeware installation will start as a Trial version, giving you an unlimited number of sensors for 30 days. After the trial period has expired, your installation will automatically revert to a Freeware edition with 30 sensors.

Downloading the Commercial Edition

Downloads and updates are free to customers with an active maintenance contract. Please log into the Paessler website to get the latest download. You can also find your license key there, which must be entered during installation:
