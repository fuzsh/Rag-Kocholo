We believe monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind's consumption of resources. Monitoring data helps our customers to optimize their IT, OT and IoT infrastructures, and to reduce their energy consumption or emissions – for our future and our environment. That's why we offer monitoring solutions for businesses across all industries and all sizes, from SMB to large enterprises. We work with renowned partners, and together we tackle the monitoring challenges of an ever-changing world. Since 1997, when we first introduced PRTG Network Monitor, we have combined our in-depth monitoring knowledge with an innovative spirit. We know the challenges of complex IT, OT and IoT infrastructures and networks. Our products empower our customers to monitor everything, and thus help them optimize their resources.
