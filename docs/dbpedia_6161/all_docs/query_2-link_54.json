        "text": "PRTG Trusted Every Day\n\nMore than 150,000 administrators rely on PRTG Network Monitor every day to monitor their LANs, WANs, servers, websites, appliances, URLs, and more\n\nNetwork problems create business emergencies. When the network goes down, employees can't read emails. Customers can't purchase the product. Work stops. Network monitoring helps you keep your business healthy:\n\nAvoid expensive outages\n\nAddress bottlenecks before they cause problems\n\nReduce costs by buying only the hardware you need\n\nStop wasting time putting out fires. Start building the future foundations of your business. You'll be less stressed and your colleagues will consider you a hero.\n\nPRTG Bandwidth Monitoring\n\nPRTG Network Monitor runs on a Windows machine within your network, collecting various statistics from the machines, software, and devices which you designate. (It can also autodiscover them, helping you map out your network.) It also retains the data so you can see historical performance, helping you react to changes.\n\nPRTG comes with an easy-to-use web interface which lets you plan for network expansion, see what applications are using most of your connection, and make sure that no one is hogging the entire network just to torrent videos.\n\nPRTG can collect data for almost anything of interest on your network. It supports multiple protocols for collecting this data:\n\nSNMP and WMI\n\nPacket Sniffing\n\nNetFlow, IPFIX, jFlow, and sFlow\n\nPRTG Know When Things Break\n\nPRTG Network Monitor includes more than 200 sensor types for all common network services, including HTTP, SMTP/POP3 (email), FTP, etc. But what is a sensor? One sensor within PRTG is one aspect that you monitor on a device. For example a specific URL, the traffic of a network connection, a port of a switch or the CPU load on a machine. Please have a look at the list of supported sensor types. Every entry in this list counts as one sensor. Normally, we are calculating with between 5 and 10 sensors per device, but of course that depends on what exactly you want to monitor.\n\nWe can alert you to outages before your users even notice them, including via email, SMS, or pager. Even better, after you use PRTG to track request times and uptime for a few months, you can optimize your network such that the pager never rings again. PRTG can print reports showing how good a job you are doing. (Tell your boss that your 100% uptime last quarter deserves a raise. We'll even print you the report to do it with.)"
