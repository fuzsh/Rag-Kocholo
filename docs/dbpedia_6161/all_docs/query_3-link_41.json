        "text": "Kari E. Ness, 82, left her earthly home and entered into eternal life with our Lord and Savior on July 27, 2024. She passed away peacefully surrounded by family.\n\nKari was born August 30, 1941 to the late Francis and Eleanor (Schilling) Femal. She was baptized into the Lord’s family. In 1963, at St. Mary’s Church in Appleton, the Lord blessed Kari with her marriage to the late Robert (Bob) Ness, her husband of 54 years. Their marriage was filled with many blessings, including two loving sons, three grandchildren, and one great-grandson. Her passion for cooking, baking, knitting and shopping served as a testament to her generous spirit. Kari was a devoted and loving wife, mother and grandmother, but above all she was a child of God. Kari loved the Lord and she loved staying in his Word through attending worship services and bible studies at Appleton Alliance Church. While she will be deeply missed, the Lord continues to bless her family with the comfort of her eternal peace and happiness with him in heaven.\n\nKari is survived by her children Michael (Erin) Ness, Patrick (Christie) Ness; grandchildren Ben (Dani) Delwiche-Oelhafen, Macie and MaKenzie Ness and great-grandson, Alex Delwiche-Oelhafen. She is further survived by siblings Ann (Dick) Paessler, Maureen Baeten, Bob (Lori Parnell) Femal, and Marjean (Terry) Gable; sister-in-law Sandy Femal and many nieces, nephews, cousins, other relatives and friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband Robert Ness, her parents, brother Pat Femal, brother-in-law Michiel Baeten, nephew Christopher Femal and nephew Steve Paessler.\n\nA visitation for Kari will be held from 9:00 am until time of funeral service at 11:00 am on Tuesday, August 6, 2024 at Wichmann Funeral Home, 537 N. Superior St. in Appleton. Dr. Dennis Episcopo, Pastor Emeritus, of Alliance Church will officiate the funeral service.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, a memorial fund will be established in Kari’s name.\n\nThe family would like to give a special thank you to the nurses and staff at St. Elizabeth Hospital for their loving care and compassion for Kari."
