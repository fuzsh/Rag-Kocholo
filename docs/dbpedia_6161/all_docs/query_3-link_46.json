It contains services like SSH, (S)FTP, SMB/CIFS, DAAP media server, RSync, BitTorrent client and many more. Thanks to the modular design of the framework it can be enhanced via plugins.\n\nOpenMediaVault is primarily designed to be used in home environments or small home offices, but is not limited to those scenarios. It is a simple and easy to use out-of-the-box solution that will allow everyone to install and administrate a Network Attached Storage without deeper knowledge.\n\nSee All Activity >\n\nLicense\n\nGNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)\n\nFollow openmediavault\n\nopenmediavault Web Site\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nQrvey allows SaaS companies to create richer products and bring them to market faster\n\nOur pre-built javascript widgets make it a snap to embed charts, reports and dashboards right into your app\n\nQrvey is a low code embedded analytics platform built to help SaaS providers by simplifying the process of putting analytics tools in the hands of all users as fast as possible.\n\nRate This Project\n\nLogin To Rate This Project\n\nUser Ratings\n\n4.8 out of 5 stars\n\n★★★★★\n\n★★★★\n\n★★★\n\n★★\n\n★\n\n154\n\n8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\nease 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\nfeatures 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\ndesign 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\nsupport 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5 4 / 5\n\nUser Reviews\n\nThere have been changes in the way this software works since earlier versions (currently version 7). Once I sorted this out and got it working I was very pleased with the way it works. I used an old HP Z400 Workstation as it was originally configured - Xeon processor and 16 GB RAM - more than is needed but no need to change the set up. Over wired network, can play 1080p movies smoothly on a smart TV using the minidlna software. Need to go to wiki.omv-extras to get all the extras you need to maximize its functionality after installation of omv.\n\nI wonder why not everybody loves that project... mostly apple trolls... There is a comment in French were the guy says it uses it for more than a decade... and I agree. For a NAS, without fees, with a wide raid support, I haven't encountered anything like that... I even \"repair\" raids from branded servers such as syno ... and does a wonderful job. Wen I speak of ease of use in a world of raid servers... I do mean that I can use it w/o scratching my head using the CLI. Even link aggregation is easy to set-up to get a larger bandwidth... Now... I do not want to stigmatize people... but when you are an Apple user and cannot use this... well just use your wallet... or open your brain to learn old tricks and new stuff. And BTW... using SMB/CIFS between 2 UNIX based system is a bit nuts ... have you ever heard of NFS which is native in Linux and MacOs FreeBSD fork. NB: What OMV has some difficulties to do ... generally Webmin will do it easely\n\nIt works in theory, but in practice it’s really slow. I have it installed on a computer plugged directly into my router’s gigabit ethernet port. We have WiFi AX, but to transfer 300MB of files from my Macbook Pro A1 it says it would take 3 days! I have SSDs on both sides so i cannot imagine why it’s so slow.\n\nSuper solution NAS pouvant être installée sur un vieux PC sans problème, très fiable, zéro problème en 10 ans d'utilisation !\n\nHi; I love this project it is easy if you do your research. youtube channels like DB Tech and technodad An technodad (listed in the forums under guides ) work with 4.0 and 5.0 which work fine for most 5.0 version things etc. want to dab in 6.0 water then DBtech can help you. NFS you have to install it for your os of choice by the way and set up. (think this was mentioned in the 5.0 video from Technodad btw) Yes, the confirmation can get on some folk's nerves but is there to make sure you don't mess up. and to always check twice do once.\n\nRead more reviews >"
