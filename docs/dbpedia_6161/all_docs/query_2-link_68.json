        "text": "The Men’s 1s, Ladies 2s and Ladies 4s all secured well-earned promotions and face challenging seasons to come.\n\nCompetitive performance throughout the club is a key focus this year, but they are also looking to expand their access to other sections of the Salisbury and South Wiltshire community.\n\nTo address that the club is introducing two new forms of hockey, Flyerz and Walking, at the club.\n\nFlyerz Hockey is a friendly and inclusive opportunity welcoming disabled and non-disabled people of all ages and abilities to play together as well as with their families.\n\nThe sessions and equipment will be adapted to ensure inclusivity of any disability and long-term health conditions.\n\nWalking hockey is perfect for players who are looking for a less physically demanding version of the game but who still enjoy developing their skills and being involved in the team and social aspect of Salisbury Hockey Club.\n\nIt’s designed to help people keep an active lifestyle regardless of age, health and ability. Whether you are new to the sport, just not played for a while or had to stop due to injuries or other reasons.\n\n“We would like the club to be a barrier free club, meaning we don’t want anything standing in the way of people who want to play. Flyerz and Walking hockey are part of that plan and with weekly sessions we are excited to be offering the same training provision for all members”, said Natalie Cameron, Development officer for the club.\n\nThe club is running an introduction to hockey day on Sunday, August 4 with a Walkers session from 12-1pm and Flyerz from 2-3pm."
