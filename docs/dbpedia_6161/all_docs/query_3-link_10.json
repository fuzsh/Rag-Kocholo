Please specify which IP address this web server will run on. Note: Later, you can log into PRTG by simply pointing your browser to the specified IP address.\n\nChoose between:\n\nLocalhost, 127.0.0.1 (PRTG will not be accessible from other computers): Use 127.0.0.1 only. PRTG's web and Windows interface will only be accessible from the computer PRTG is installed on.\n\nNote: Either the selected port or at least one port in the range from 8080 to 8089 has to be available on 127.0.0.1.\n\nNote: If you run PRTG on localhost, please do not use the DNS name http://localhost to log in to the web server, as this may considerably slow down PRTG's web interface. Please use your local IP address or http://127.0.0.1 instead.\n\nAll IPs available on this computer: Use all IP addresses available on this computer and enable access to the web server for all of these addresses. Note: The TCP port selected below must be free on every available IP address.\n\nSpecify IPs: Select specific IP addresses on which the PRTG Web server will run on. A list specific to your system is shown. Add a check mark in front of every IP address you want the PRTG web server to be available at. You can also select and deselect all addresses by clicking on the check box in the table header.\n\nNote: Either the selected port or at least one port in the range from 8080 to 8089 has to be available on the specified IP address.\n\nNote: Regardless of the selected setting above, one port in the range from 8080 to 8180 has to be available on the specified IP address so PRTG can create reports. The report engine will try to connect to the core server on one of these ports.\n\nNote: If PRTG does not find a network card on startup it will switch the IP setting to Localhost. This setting will remain, even if a network card is available later on. If you disabled or removed the network card on the machine running the PRTG core server, please re-check this setting.\n\nNote: If you change this setting, PRTG needs to restart the core server. Because of this, all users of PRTG's web interface, of the Enterprise Console, or of Smartphone Apps will be disconnected. After clicking on the Save button, a dialog box will appear which asks you to confirm the required core server restart. Click OK to trigger the restart and follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nTCP Port for Web Server\n\nPRTG is running a web server in order to provide the web and Windows interface. Please specify on which port this web server will run. Choose between:\n\nSecure HTTPS server (recommended, mandatory for internet access): This is the recommended setting and needed to access the PRTG server via the internet. Use a secure HTTPS connection that is encrypted via SSL on port 443.\n\nNote: Although the connection is secure, you will see an SSL Certificate Warning in your browser when logging in to the PRTG web interface, because the default certificate is unknown to your browser. You can install another SSL certificate for PRTG later. Please see Using Your Own SSL Certificate.\n\nNote: If port 80 is free, PRTG will reserve it as well. When users try to connect on port 80 via HTTP, they will then be redirected to port 443 via HTTPS. You can change this behavior using a registry setting.\n\nInsecure HTTP server (standard port 80, not recommended): Use a standard web server without SSL encryption on port 80. This setting is not recommended for WAN connections.\n\nNote: If used on the internet, attackers could potentially spy on credentials you enter into PRTG. We strongly recommend using this option in a LAN only.\n\nExpert configuration: This setting allows you to specify a custom web server port and the security of the connection. This option is intended for systems with an existing web server on the standard port. Define port and encryption below.\n\nNote: If you change this setting, PRTG needs to restart the core server. Because of this, all users of PRTG's web interface, of the Enterprise Console, or of Smartphone Apps will be disconnected. After clicking on the Save button, a dialog box will appear which asks you to confirm the required core server restart. Click OK to trigger the restart and follow the instructions on the screen.\n\nWeb Server Security\n\nUse SSL encryption (HTTPS)Use a secure HTTPS connection that is encrypted via SSL on a custom port as defined above.\n\nNote: Although the connection is secure, you will see an SSL Certificate Warning in your browser when logging in to the PRTG web interface, because the default certificate is unknown to your browser. You can install another SSL certificate for PRTG later. Please see Using Your Own SSL Certificate.\n\nDon't use encryption (not recommended): This setting is not recommended for WAN connections. Use a standard web server without SSL encryption on a custom port as defined above.\n\nNote: If used on the internet, attackers could potentially spy on credentials you enter into PRTG. We strongly recommend using this option in a LAN only.\n\nNote: If you change this setting, PRTG needs to restart the core server. Because of this, all users of PRTG's web interface, of the Enterprise Console, or of Smartphone Apps will be disconnected.

For the live graph, no fixed time span is given, but you can define how many values will be displayed. The actual time span covered by the live graph depends on the scanning interval set for the sensor you're viewing and is calculated automatically. By default, 120 Values is set, which results in a graph covering a time span of two hours, if a scanning interval of 60 seconds is set for the sensor. Other scanning intervals will result in graphs covering different time spans. Choose between:\n\n60 Values: This corresponds to a live graph covering a time span of one hour if a 1 minute scanning interval is set. Uses least RAM memory. We recommend this setting for installations with 10,000 sensors or more.\n\n120 Values: This corresponds to a live graph covering a time span of two hours if a 1 minute scanning interval is set.\n\n240 Values: This corresponds to a live graph covering a time span of four hours if a 1 minute scanning interval is set.\n\n480 Values: This corresponds to a live graph covering a time span of eight hours if a 1 minute scanning interval is set.\n\n960 Values: This corresponds to a live graph covering a time span of 16 hours if a 1 minute scanning interval is set. Uses most RAM memory.\n\nGraph 1\n\nBy default, this is the 2 days graph in the web interface. You can change it to more or less detail by choosing a time span and a monitoring interval average associated with it. Monitoring results will be averaged regardless of the actual scanning interval set for the sensors. Choose between:\n\n1 day with 1 minute averages: Results in 1440 values.\n\n1 day with 5 minutes averages: Results in 288 values.\n\n1 day with 15 minutes averages: Results in 96 values. Uses least RAM memory. We recommend this setting for installations with 10,000 sensors or more.\n\n2 days with 1 minute averages: Results in 2880 values. Uses most RAM memory.\n\n2 days with 5 minutes averages: Results in 576 values.\n\n2 days with 15 minutes averages: Results in 192 values.\n\n4 days with 1 hour averages: Results in 96 values. Uses least RAM memory. We recommend this setting for installations with 10,000 sensors or more."
