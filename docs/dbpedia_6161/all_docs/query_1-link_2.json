You can also request a trial key there, which must be entered during installation:\n\nhttp://www.paessler.com/prtg/download\n\nNote: Every Freeware installation will start as a Trial version, giving you an unlimited number of sensors for 30 days. After the trial period has expired, your installation will automatically revert to a Freeware edition with 30 sensors.\n\nDownloading the Commercial Edition\n\nDownloads and updates are free to customers with an active maintenance contract. Please log into the Paessler website to get the latest download. You can also find your license key there, which must be entered during installation:\n\nhttp://www.paessler.com/login\n\nIf you do not have an active maintenance contract, please contact sales@paessler.com.\n\nNote: Once installed, you will usually use the Software Auto-Update function of PRTG to download and install new versions. This will further ease the process of installing updates.\n\nInstallation\n\nPlease double click the setup file on the computer that will be your PRTG server. Follow the installation wizard and install the software.\n\nAt the end of the installation, a browser window will be opened automatically, and it will connect to the PRTG web interface, showing the Configuration Guru.

If you cannot access the Configuration Guru, please open the URL of the PRTG web interface in another browser.\n\nLogin\n\nIf everything works fine, you will not see the login screen on first startup. Only when switching browsers you will have to log in.\n\nLeave the Login Name and Password fields empty.\n\nChoose the AJAX Web GUI (All features, optimized for desktop access) option.\n\nClick on the Default Login button to login.\n\nPlease make sure you use a supported web browser when logging in to PRTG.
