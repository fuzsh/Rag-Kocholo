In the background, it opens the web page in a browser instance to perform the measurement. Links are not followed.\n\nThis sensor shows the loading time of the full web page.\n\nBe careful with this sensor, because it can generate considerable internet traffic if you use it with a low scanning interval!\n\nRemarks\n\nSupports Smart URL Replacement.\n\nKnowledge Base: What to do when I see a CreateUniqueTempDir() error message for my HTTP Full Webpage Sensor?\n\nKnowledge Base: HTTP Full Web Page sensor is unable to navigate. What can I do?\n\nKnowledge Base: How can I change the size of PhantomJS full web page screenshots?\n\nKnowledge Base: Which HTTP status code leads to which HTTP sensor status?\n\nThis sensor type does not support Secure Remote Password (SRP) ciphers.\n\nThis sensor type can have a high impact on the performance of your monitoring system. Please use it with care! We recommend that you use no more than 50 sensors of this sensor type on each probe.\n\nYou cannot add this sensor type to cloud probes in PRTG in the cloud. If you want to use this sensor type, please add it to a remote probe device.\n\nAdd Sensor\n\nThe Add Sensor dialog appears when you manually add a new sensor to a device. It only shows the setting fields that are required for creating the sensor. Therefore, you will not see all setting fields in this dialog. You can change (nearly) all settings in the sensor's Settings tab later.\n\nSensor Settings\n\nOn the details page of a sensor, click the Settings tab to change its settings.\n\nUsually, a sensor connects to the IP Address or DNS Name of the parent device where you created this sensor. See the Device Settings for details. For some sensor types, you can define the monitoring target explicitly in the sensor settings. Please see below for details on available settings.\n\nInherited Settings\n\nBy default, all following settings are inherited from objects higher in the hierarchy and should be changed there, if necessary. Often, best practice is to change them centrally in the Root group's settings. To change a setting only for this object, disable inheritance by clicking the check mark in front of the corresponding setting name. You will then see the options described below.\n\nSmart URL Replacement\n\nInstead of entering a complete address in the URL field of an HTTP sensor, you can merely enter the protocol followed by colon and three slashes (that means you can enter either http:/// or https:/// or even a simple slash / as equivalent for http:///). PRTG will fill in the parent device's IP address or DNS name in front of the third slash automatically.\n\nWhether this results in a valid URL or not depends on the IP address or DNS name of the device where this HTTP sensor is created on. In combination with cloning devices, the smart URL replacement makes it easy to create many like devices.\n\nFor example, if you create a device with DNS name www.example.com and you add an HTTP sensor to it, you can provide values the following ways:\n\nProviding the value https:/// in the URL field, PRTG will automatically create the URL https://www.example.com/\n\nUsing the value /help in the URL field, PRTG will automatically create and monitor the URL http://www.example.com/help\n\nIt is also possible to provide a port number in the URL field which will be taken over by the device's DNS name and internally added, for example, http://:8080/\n\nSmart URL replacement does not work for sensors running on the Probe Device.\n\nMore\n\nKnowledge Base: Which HTTP status code leads to which HTTP sensor status?\n\nhttps://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/65731\n\nKnowledge Base: What to do when I see a CreateUniqueTempDir() error message for my HTTP Full Webpage Sensor?\n\nhttps://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/40783\n\nKnowledge Base: HTTP Full Web Page sensor is \"unable to navigate\".

For detailed information, please see the Sensor Channels Settings section.\n\nNotifications\n\nClick the Notifications tab to change notification triggers. For detailed information, please see the Sensor Notifications Settings section.\n\nOthers\n\nFor more general information about settings, please see the Object Settings section.\n\nSensor Settings Overview\n\nFor information about sensor settings, please see the following sections:"
