In your browser, load the IP address or DNS name of the computer PRTG is installed on and log in using the Default Login button.\n\nYou can look up and change PRTG's web server settings at any time using the PRTG Administrator Windows application on the system where the PRTG core server is installed on. Especially when accessing PRTG from the internet you should use an SSL encrypted connection. You can easily switch to SSL using the Yes, switch to SSL button shown on the welcome screen.\n\nLoading the Web Interface\n\nIn a web browser window, please enter the IP address or URL of the system PRTG is installed on. When using a cluster, please connect to the primary master node. You can also double click on the PRTG Network Monitor icon on the desktop of the system PRTG is installed on.\n\nNote: If you run PRTG on localhost, please do not use the DNS name http://localhost to log in to the web server, as this may considerably slow down PRTG's web interface. Please use your local IP address or http://127.0.0.1 instead.\n\nIf you see a certificate warning in your browser, you can usually just confirm it. For more information please see SSL Certificate Warning.\n\nLogin Screen\n\nAfter loading the web interface, the login screen is shown. You can either login as default administrator or as an other PRTG user. As Administrator user you can use all functionalities of the web interface. Administrators can create additional users with administrator rights or with more restricted privileges (for example, read only users).\n\nAdditionally, there are different GUI versions available.\n\nLogin as Default Administrator (First Time Login)\n\nWhen logging in for the first time, login name and password for the default administrator login are both prtgadmin. You can leave the login name and password fields empty and click on the Default Login button to log in using these default credentials.\n\nNote: After login you should change the default password. To do so, go to Setup | Account Settings | My Account and specify a new password in section User Account.\n\nNote: If you are not logged in into the web interface, you can change the credentials for this default user account any time in the PRTG Administrator Windows application.\n\nLogin as PRTG User\n\nIf you have received user credentials from your administrator, please enter them here to login. Also, when using other administrator credentials, please enter them here.\n\nChoose GUI version\n\nDepending on the used browser, different Graphical User Interface (GUI) options are shown:\n\nUse AJAX Web GUI (All features, optimized for desktop access): The standard interface. We recommend to use this option for PRTG whenever possible. It offers the full functionality of PRTG. Use Google Chrome 38 or later (recommended) or Mozilla Firefox 33 or later for best performance. In some browsers, the Ajax option is not shown, for example, in old browser versions.\n\nNote: Although you can login using Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or 11, the Ajax web interface might not be fully compatible with Internet Explorer! When using Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 or 11, please set the security level at least to Default level Medium-high and make sure you do not use the Compatibility View! For detailed information, please see More section below.\n\nUse Mobile Web GUI (Limited functionality, optimized for mobile access): The Mobile Web GUI interface is optimized for slow network connections and old browsers. It only offers read-only functionality and comes with less scripting. It is also a fallback solution when using a browser that is not supported by the Ajax interface.\n\nDownload Client Software (for Windows, iOS, Android): This option calls PRTG's download page in the Mobile Web GUI. You can optionally download the native Windows application Enterprise Console to the desktop (called Windows GUI in previous deprecated PRTG versions). It has to be installed on the client computer before use. The Enterprise Console provides full functionality; however, for some functions the Ajax Web GUI is opened. As an additional feature, the Enterprise Console can view data of several independent PRTG core installations in a single application.\n\nYou can also access pages on Paessler's website from here for information about the PRTG apps PRTG for Android and iPRTG for iOS. These pages contain also the download links for the apps for your mobile device. Note: Also when using this download option, login name and password (or a Default Login) are required!\n\nNote: Only Google Chrome 38 or later (recommended) and Mozilla Firefox 33 or later are fully compatible with the Ajax web interface. For more information about Internet Explorer support, please see More section below.\n\nClick on the Login button to proceed to the PRTG web interface.\n\nMore\n\nKnowledge Base: Why are Internet Explorer IE6 and IE7 not supported by PRTG's Ajax Interface?\n\nhttp://kb.paessler.com/en/topic/7633\n\nKnowledge Base: How can I access the AJAX web interface of PRTG with Internet Explorer 9 or IE10?"
