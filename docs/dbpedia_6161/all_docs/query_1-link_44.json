They have found an evil advantage in cryptocurrency mining, which involves complex calculations to mine virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Litecoin.\n\nBotnet Attacks:Botnet attacks often target large organizations and entities that obtain vast amounts of information. This attack allows programmers to control countless devices in exchange for cunning intent.\n\nFor more details please refer to the article: Types of Cyber Attacks\n\n2. What are the elements of cyber security?\n\nThere are various elements of cyber security as given below:\n\nApplication Security: Application security is the most important core component of cyber security, adding security highlights to applications during the improvement period to defend against cyber attacks.\n\nInformation Security: Information security is a component of cyber security that describes how information is protected against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, alteration, or deletion.\n\nNetwork Security: Network security is the security provided to a network from unauthorized access and threats. It is the network administrator’s responsibility to take precautions to protect the network from potential security threats. Network security is another element of IT security, the method of defending and preventing unauthorized access to computer networks.\n\nDisaster Recovery Planning: A plan that describes the continuity of work after a disaster quickly and efficiently is known as a disaster recovery plan or business continuity plan. A disaster recovery methodology should start at the business level and identify applications that are generally critical to carrying out the association’s activities.\n\nOperational Security: In order to protect sensitive data from a variety of threats, the process of allowing administrators to see activity from a hacker’s perspective is called operational security (OPSEC)n or procedural security.\n\nEnd User Education: End-user training is the most important component of computer security. End users are becoming the number one security threat to any organization because they can happen at any time. One of the major errors that lead to information corruption is human error. Associations must prepare their employees for cyber security.\n\nFor more details please refer to the article: Elements of Cybersecurity\n\n3. Define DNS?\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses that browsers use to load web pages. Every device connected to the Internet has its own IP address, which other devices use to identify it in simple language, we can say that DNS Defines the Service of the network.\n\nTo know more please refer to the article: Domain Name System (DNS) in Application Layer\n\n4. What is a Firewall?\n\nA firewall is a hardware or software-based network security device that monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and accepts, denies, or drops that particular traffic based on a defined set of security rules.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Introduction of Firewall to know more about this topic.\n\n5. What is a VPN?\n\nVPN stands for Virtual Private Network. A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over an insecure network like the Internet. A virtual private network is a method of extending a private network using a public network such as the Internet. The name only indicates that it is a virtual “private network”. A user may be part of a local area network at a remote location. Create a secure connection using a tunnelling protocol.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Virtual Private Network (VPN) to learn more about this topic.\n\n6. What are the different sources of malware?\n\nThe different sources of malware are given below:\n\nWorms: A worm is basically a type of malicious malware that spreads rapidly from one computer to another via email and file sharing. Worms do not require host software or code to execute.\n\nSpyware: Spyware is basically a type of malicious malware that runs in the background of your computer, steals all your sensitive data, and reports this data to remote attackers.\n\nRansomware: Ransomware is used as malware to extort money from users for ransom by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive user information and demanding payment to delete or return that information from the user.\n\nVirus: A virus is a type of malicious malware that comes as an attachment with a file or program. Viruses usually spread from one program to another program, and they will run only when the host file gets executed. The virus can only cause damage to the computer until the host file runs.\n\nTrojan:Trojans are malicious, non-replicating malware that often degrades computer performance and efficiency. Trojans have the ability to leak sensitive user information and modify and delete this data.\n\nAdware: Adware is another type of malware that tracks the usage of various types of programs and files on your computer and displays personalized ad recommendations based on your usage history.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Different Sources of Malware to learn more about this topic.\n\n7. How does email work?\n\nWhen a sender uses an e-mail program to send an e-mail, it is redirected to a simple e-mail transfer protocol. In this protocol, the recipient’s email address belongs to a different domain name or the same domain name as the sender (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). After that, the e-mail will be stored on the server, and later he will send it using the POP or IMAP protocol. Then, if the recipient has a different domain name address, the SMTP protocol communicates with the DNS (Domain Name Server) for the different addresses that the recipient uses. Then the sender’s SMTP communicates with the receiver’s SMTP, and the receiver’s SMTP performs the communication. This way the email is delivered to the recipient’s SMTP. If certain network traffic issues prevent both the sender’s SMTP and the recipient’s SMTP from communicating with each other, outgoing emails will be queued at the recipient’s SMTP and finally to be received by the recipient. Also, if a message stays in the queue for too long due to terrible circumstances, the message will be returned to the sender as undelivered.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Working of Email to learn more about this topic.\n\n8. What is the difference between active and passive cyber attacks?\n\nActive Cyber Attack: An active attack is a type of attack in which the attacker modifies or attempts to modify the content of the message. Active attacks are a threat to integrity and availability. Active attacks can constantly corrupt the system and modify system resources. Most importantly, if there is an active attack, the victim is notified of the attack.\n\nPassive Cyber Attack: A passive attack is a type of attack in which the attacker observes the message content or copies the message content. Passive attacks are a threat to confidentiality. Since it is a passive attack, there is no damage to the system. Most importantly, when attacking passively, the victim is not notified of the attack.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Difference between Active Attack and Passive Attack to know more about it.\n\n9. What is a social engineering attack?\n\nSocial engineering is the act of manipulating individuals to take actions that may or may not be in the best interests of the “target”. This may include obtaining information, obtaining access, or obtaining a goal to perform a particular action. It has the ability to manipulate and deceive people. A phone call accompanied by a survey or a quick internet search can bring up dates of birthdays and anniversaries and arm you with that information. This information is enough to create a password attack list.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Social Engineering to know more.\n\n10. Who are black hat hackers and white hat hackers?\n\nWhite Hat Hacker: A white hat hacker is a certified or certified hacker who works for governments and organizations by conducting penetration tests and identifying cybersecurity gaps. It also guarantees protection from malicious cybercrime.\n\nBlack Hat Hackers: They are often called crackers. Black hat hackers can gain unauthorized access to your system and destroy your important data. The attack method uses common hacking techniques learned earlier. They are considered criminals and are easy to identify because of their malicious behavior.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Types of Hackers to know more.\n\n11. Define encryption and decryption?\n\nEncryption is the process of transforming an ordinary message (plaintext) into a meaningless message (ciphertext). Decryption is the process of transforming a meaningless message (ciphertext) into its original form (plaintext). The main difference between covert writing and covert writing is that it converts the message into a cryptic format that cannot be deciphered unless the message is decrypted. Covert writing, on the other hand, is reconstructing the original message from the encrypted information.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Difference between Encryption and Decryption to know more.\n\n12. What is the difference between plaintext and cleartext?\n\nThe plaintext is not encrypted at all and cannot be considered encrypted and Clear text is a text sent or stored that has not been encrypted and was not intended to be encrypted. So you don’t need to decrypt to see the plaintext. In its simplest form.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Encryption and Decryption to know more.\n\n13. What is a block cipher?\n\nBlock Cipher Converts plaintext to ciphertext using one block of plaintext at a time. Use 64-bit or 64-bit or greater. The complexity of block ciphers is simple. The algorithm modes used in block ciphers are ECB (Electronic Code Book) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining).\n\nPlease refer to the article: Difference between Block Cipher and Stream Cipher to know more.\n\n14. What is the CIA triangle?\n\nWhen it comes to network security, the CIA Triad is one of the most important models developed to guide information security policy within an organization.\n\nCIA stands for:\n\nConfidentiality\n\nIntegrity\n\navailability\n\nPlease refer to the article: CIA Triad in Cryptography to know more.\n\n15. What is the Three-way handshake?\n\nTCP uses a three-way handshake to establish reliable connections. The connection is full-duplex, with synchronization (SYN) and acknowledgment (ACK) on both sides. The exchange of these four flags is done in three steps: SYN, SYN to ACK, and ACK.\n\nPlease refer to the article: TCP 3-Way Handshake to know more about it.\n\n16. How can identity theft be prevented?\n\nSteps to prevent identity theft:\n\nUse a strong password and don’t share her PIN with anyone on or off the phone.\n\nUse two-factor notifications for email. Protect all your devices with one password.\n\nDo not install software from the Internet. Do not post confidential information on social media.\n\nWhen entering a password with a payment gateway, check its authenticity.\n\nLimit the personal data you run. Get in the habit of changing your PIN and password regularly.\n\nDo not give out your information over the phone.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Cyber Crime – Identity Theft to know more about it.\n\n17. What are some common Hashing functions?\n\nThe hash function is a function that converts a specific numerical key or alphanumeric key into a small practical integer value. The mapped integer value is used as an index for hash tables. Simply put, a hash function maps any valid number or string to a small integer that can be used as an index into a hash table. The types of Hash functions are given below:\n\nDivision Method.\n\nMid Square Method.\n\nFolding Method.\n\nMultiplication Method.\n\nPlease refer to the article Hash Functions to know more about this topic.\n\n18. What do you mean by two-factor authentication?\n\nTwo-factor authentication refers to using any two independent methods from a variety of authentication methods. Two-factor authentication is used to ensure users have access to secure systems and to enhance security. Two-factor authentication was first implemented for laptops due to the basic security needs of mobile computing. Two-factor authentication makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to use mobile devices to access secure data and systems.\n\nPlease refer to the article Two-factor Authentication to learn more about this topic.\n\n19. What does XSS stand for? How can it be prevented?\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in web applications that allows third parties to execute scripts on behalf of the web application in the user’s browser. Cross-site scripting is one of the most prevalent security vulnerabilities on the Internet today. Exploiting her XSS against users can have a variety of consequences, including Account compromise, account deletion, privilege escalation, malware infection, etc. Effective prevention of XSS vulnerabilities requires a combination of the following countermeasures:\n\nFilter entrance on arrival. As user input comes in, filter expected or valid input as closely as possible. Encode the data on output. When user-controllable data is emitted in an HTTP response, encode the output so that it is not interpreted as active content.\n\nDepending on the output context, it may be necessary to apply a combination of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding. Use proper response headers.\n\nTo prevent XSS in HTTP responses that should not contain HTML or JavaScript, use the Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to force the browser to interpret the response as intended. Content Security Policy. As a last line of defence, a Content Security Policy (CSP) can be used to mitigate the severity of remaining XSS vulnerabilities.\n\nPlease refer to the article Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to learn more about this topic.\n\n20. What do you mean by Shoulder Surfing?\n\nA shoulder surfing attack describes a situation in which an attacker can physically look at a device’s screen or keyboard and enter passwords to obtain personal information. Used to – access malware. Similar things can happen from nosy people, leading to an invasion of privacy.\n\nPlease refer to the article Shoulder Surfing to learn more about this topic.\n\n21. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?\n\nHashing\n\nEncryption\n\nThis is the process of transforming information into short, fixed values ​​called keys that are used to represent the original information. This is the process of securely encoding data so that only authorized users who know the key or password can retrieve the original data. The purpose of hashing is to index and retrieve items from the database. The process is very fast. The purpose of encryption is to transform data and keep it secret from others. There is no way to convert the hash code or key back to the original information. Only mapping is possible, the hash code is checked if the hash code is the same, and the information is checked if the information is the same, otherwise, it is not checked. Original information is not available If you know the cryptographic key and algorithm used for encryption, you can easily retrieve the original information. It generally tries to generate a new key for each piece of information passed to the hash function, but in rare cases, it can generate the same key, commonly known as a collision. A new key is always generated for each piece of information. Hashed information is generally small and fixed in length. It does not increase even if the information length of the information increases. The length of encrypted information is not fixed. It increases as the information length increases.\n\nPlease refer to the article Hashing and Encryption to learn more about this topic.\n\n22. Differentiate between Information security and information assurance.\n\nInformation Assurance: It can be described as the practice of protecting and managing risks associated with sensitive information throughout the process of data transmission, processing, and storage. Information assurance primarily focuses on protecting the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality of data within a system. This includes physical technology as well as digital data protection.\n\nInformation security: on the other hand, is the practice of protecting information by reducing information risk. The purpose is usually to reduce the possibility of unauthorized access or illegal use of the data. Also, destroy, detect, alter, examine, or record any Confidential Information. This includes taking steps to prevent such incidents. The main focus of information security is to provide balanced protection against cyber-attacks and hacking while maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nPlease refer to the article Information Assurance vs. Information Security to learn more about this topic.\n\n23. Write a difference between HTTPS and SSL.\n\nHTTPS\n\nSSL\n\nIt is called Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is called Secured Socket Layer This is a more secure version of the HTTP protocol with more encryption capabilities. It is the one and only cryptographic protocol in computer networks. HTTPS is created by combining the HTTP protocol and SSL. SSL can be used for encryption. HTTPS is primarily used by websites for logging into banking details and personal accounts. SSL cannot be used alone for a particular website. Used for encryption in conjunction with the HTTP protocol. HTTPS is the most secure and latest version of the HTTP protocol available today. SSL is being phased out in favour of TLS (Transport Layer Security).\n\nPlease refer to the article SSL vs. HTTPS to learn more about this topic.\n\n24. What do you mean by System Hardening?\n\nThe attack surface includes all flaws and vulnerabilities that a hacker could use to gain access to your system, such as default passwords, improperly configured firewalls, etc. The idea of ​​system hardening is to make a system more secure by reducing the attack surface present in the design of the system. System hardening is the process of reducing a system’s attack surface, thereby making it more robust and secure. This is an integral part of system security practices.\n\nPlease refer to the article System Hardening to learn more about this topic.\n\n25. Differentiate between spear phishing and phishing.\n\nPhishing: This is a type of email attack in which an attacker fraudulently attempts to discover a user’s sensitive information through electronic communications, pretending to be from a relevant and trusted organization. The emails are carefully crafted by the attackers, targeted to specific groups, and clicking the links installs malicious code on your computer.\n\nSpear phishing: Spear phishing is a type of email attack that targets specific individuals or organizations. In Spear, a phishing attacker tricks a target into clicking a malicious link and installing malicious code, allowing the attacker to obtain sensitive information from the target’s system or network.\n\nPlease refer to the article Phishing and Spear Phishing to learn more about this topic.\n\n26. What do you mean by Perfect Forward Secrecy?\n\nPerfect Forward Secrecy is a style of encryption that creates a temporary exchange of secret keys between the server and client. It is primarily used to call apps, websites, and messaging apps where user privacy is paramount. A new session key is generated each time the user performs an action. This keeps your data uncompromised and safe from attackers. This is separate from special keys. The basic idea behind Perfect Forward Secrecy technology is to generate a new encryption key each time a user initiates a session. So, if only the encryption key is compromised, the conversation is leaked, and if the user’s unique key is compromised, the conversation will continue. Encryption keys generated by Perfect Forward Secrecy keep you safe from attackers. Essentially, it provides double protection from attackers.\n\nPlease refer to the article Perfect Forward Secrecy to learn more about this topic.\n\n27. How to prevent MITM?\n\nStrong WEP/WAP Encryption on Access Points\n\nStrong Router Login Credentials Strong Router Login Credentials\n\nUse Virtual Private Network.\n\nPlease refer to the article How to Prevent Man In the Middle Attack? to learn more about this topic.\n\n28. What is ransomware?\n\nRansomware is a type of malware that encrypts data to make it inaccessible to computer users. Cybercriminals use it to extort money from the individuals and organizations that hacked the data and hold the data hostage until a ransom is paid.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Ransomware to know more about this.\n\n29. What is Public Key Infrastructure?\n\nA Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI, is the governing authority behind the issuance of digital certificates. Protect sensitive data and give users and systems unique identities. Therefore, communication security is ensured. The public key infrastructure uses keys in public-private key pairs to provide security. Public keys are vulnerable to attacks, so maintaining public keys requires a healthy infrastructure.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Public Key Infrastructure to know more.\n\n30. What is Spoofing?\n\nSpoofing is a type of attack on computing devices in which an attacker attempts to steal the identity of a legitimate user and pretend to be someone else. This type of attack is performed to compromise system security or steal user information.\n\nTypes of Spoofing:\n\nIP Spoofing: IP is a network protocol that allows messages to be sent and received over the Internet. Her IP address of the sender is included in the message header of all emails sent to her messages (sender address).\n\nARP Spoofing:ARP spoofing is a hacking technique that redirects network traffic to hackers. Spying on LAN addresses in both wired and wireless LAN networks is called ARP spoofing.\n\nEmail Spoofing: Email spoofing is the most common form of identity theft on the Internet. Phishers use official logos and headers to send emails to many addresses impersonating bank, corporate, and law enforcement officials.\n\nPlease refer to the article: What is Spoofing? to know more.\n\nCyber Security Interview Questions for Intermediate\n\n31. What are the steps involved in hacking a server or network?\n\nThe following steps must be ensured in order to hack any server or network:\n\nAccess your web server.\n\nUse anonymous FTP to access this network to gather more information and scan ports.\n\nPay attention to file sizes, open ports, and processes running on your system.\n\nRun a few simple commands on your web server like “clear cache” or “delete all files” to highlight the data stored by the server behind these programs. This helps in obtaining more sensitive information that can be used in application-specific exploits.\n\nConnect to other sites on the same network, such as Facebook and Twitter, so that you can check the deleted data. Access the server using the conversion channel.\n\nAccess internal network resources and data to gather more information.\n\nUse Metasploit to gain remote access to these resources.\n\nTo know more about this topic please refer to the article: How to Hack a Web Server?\n\nLists of some main Networking Sniffing Tools:\n\nAuvik\n\nSolarWinds Network Packet Sniffer\n\nWireshark\n\nPaessler PRTG\n\nManageEngine NetFlow Analyzer\n\nTcpdump\n\nWinDump\n\nNetworkMiner\n\nPlease refer to the article: Sniffing Tools to learn more about sniffing tools in ethical hacking.\n\n33. What is SQL injection?\n\nSQL injection is a technique used to exploit user data through web page input by injecting SQL commands as statements. Essentially, these instructions can be used by a malicious user to manipulate her web server for your application. SQL injection is a code injection technique that can corrupt your database. Preventing SQL Injection is given below:\n\nValidation of user input by pre-defining user input length, type, input fields, and authentication.\n\nRestrict user access and determine how much data outsiders can access from your database. Basically, you shouldn’t give users permission to access everything in your database.\n\nDo not use system administrator accounts.\n\nTo know more about this topic, Please read the article: SQL Injection\n\n34. What is a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS)?\n\nA denial of service (DoS) is a cyber attack against an individual computer or website aimed at denying service to intended users. Its purpose is to interfere with the organization’s network operations by denying her access. Denial of service is usually achieved by flooding the target machine or resource with excessive requests, overloading the system, and preventing some or all legitimate requests from being satisfied.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Denial of Service and Prevention to know more.\n\n35. How to avoid ARP poisoning?\n\nFollowing are the five ways of avoiding ARP Poisoning attacks:\n\nStatic ARP Tables: If you can verify the correct mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses, half the problem is solved. This is doable but very costly to administer. ARP tables to record all associations and each network change are manually updated in these tables. Currently, it is not practical for an organization to manually update its ARP table on every host.\n\nSwitch Security: Most Ethernet switches have features that help mitigate ARP poisoning attacks. Also known as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), these features help validate ARP messages and drop packets that indicate any kind of malicious activity.\n\nPhysical Security: A very simple way to mitigate ARP poisoning attacks is to control the physical space of your organization. ARP messages are only routed within the local network. Therefore, an attacker may have physical proximity to the victim’s network.\n\nNetwork Isolation: A well-segmented network is better than a regular network because ARP messages have a range no wider than the local subnet. That way, if an attack were to occur, only parts of the network would be affected and other parts would be safe. Attacks on one subnet do not affect devices on other subnets.\n\nEncryption: Encryption does not help prevent ARP poisoning, but it does help reduce the damage that could be done if an attack were to occur. Credentials are stolen from the network, similar to the MiTM attack.\n\nPlease refer to the article: How to Avoid ARP Poisoning? to know more.\n\n36. What is a proxy firewall?\n\nThe proxy firewall monitors application-level information using a firewall proxy server. A proxy firewall server creates and runs a process on the firewall that mirrors the services as if they were running on the end host.\n\nThe application layer has several protocols such as HTTP (a protocol for sending and receiving web pages) and SMTP (a protocol for e-mail messages on the Internet). A proxy server like Web Proxy Server is like a process that mirrors the behavior of the HTTP service. Similarly, the FTP proxy server reflects how his FTP service works.\n\nPlease refer to the article: What is a Proxy Firewall? to know more.\n\n37. Explain SSL Encryption.\n\nSecure Socket Layer (SSL) provides security for data transferred between web browsers and servers.

Explain the main difference between Diffie-Hellman and RSA.\n\nDiffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm: It is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to communicate over a public channel and establish a shared secret without sending it over the Internet. DH allows two people to use their public key to encrypt and decrypt conversations or data using symmetric cryptography.\n\nRSA: It is a type of asymmetric encryption that uses two different linked keys. RSA encryption allows messages to be encrypted with both public and private keys. The opposite key used to encrypt the message is used to decrypt the message.\n\nPlease refer to the article to learn more about this topic.\n\n41. Give some examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\nAsymmetric key cryptography is based on public and private key cryptography. It uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt messages. More secure than symmetric key cryptography, but much slower.\n\nYou need two keys, a public key, and a private key. One for encryption and one for decryption.\n\nThe ciphertext size is equal to or larger than the original plaintext.\n\nSlow encryption process.\n\nUsed to transfer small amounts of data.\n\nProvides confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation.\n\nPlease refer to the article Symmetric and Asymmetric Key Encryption to learn more about this topic.\n\n42. Explain social engineering and its attacks.\n\nSocial engineering is a hacking technique based on forging someone’s identity and using socialization skills to obtain details. There are techniques that combine psychological and marketing skills to influence targeted victims and manipulate them into obtaining sensitive information. The types of social engineering attacks are given below:\n\nImpersonation: This is a smart choice for attackers. This method impersonates organizations, police, banks, and tax authorities. Then they steal money or anything they want from the victim. And the same goes for organizations that obtain information about victims legally through other means.\n\nPhishing:Phishing is like impersonating a well-known website such as Facebook and creating a fake girlfriend website to trick users into providing account credentials and personal information. Most phishing attacks are carried out through social media such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nVishing: Technically speaking, this is called “voice phishing”. In this phishing technique, attackers use their voice and speaking skills to trick users into providing personal information. In general, this is most often done by organizations to capture financial and customer data.\n\nSmithing: Smithing is a method of carrying out attacks, generally through messages. In this method, attackers use their fear and interest in a particular topic to reach out to victims through messages. These topics are linked to further the phishing process and obtaining sensitive information about the target.\n\nPlease refer to the article Social Engineering: The Attack on Human Brain and Trust to learn more about this topic.\n\n43. State the difference between a virus and worm.\n\nWorms: Worms are similar to viruses, but do not modify the program. It replicates more and more to slow down your computer system. The worm can be controlled with a remote control. The main purpose of worms is to eat up system resources. The 2000 WannaCry ransomware worm exploits the resource-sharing protocol Windows Server Message Block (SMBv1).\n\nVirus: A virus is malicious executable code attached to another executable file that can be harmless or modify or delete data. When a computer program runs with a virus, it performs actions such as B. Delete the file from your computer system. Viruses cannot be controlled remotely. The ILOVEYOU virus spreads through email attachments.\n\nPlease refer to the article Difference between Worms and Virus to know more about this topic.\n\n44. Explain the concept of session hijacking.\n\nSession hijacking is a security attack on user sessions over a protected network. The most common method of session hijacking is called IP spoofing, where an attacker uses source-routed IP packets to inject commands into the active communication between two nodes on a network, allowing an authenticated impersonation of one of the users. This type of attack is possible because authentication usually only happens at the beginning of a TCP session. The types of session hijacking are given below:\n\nPacket Sniffing\n\nCSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery)\n\nCross-site Scripting\n\nIP spoofing\n\nPlease refer to the article Session Hijacking to learn more about this topic.\n\n45.

What are Polymorphic viruses?\n\n“Poly” refers to many and “morphic” refers to the shape. Thus, polymorphic viruses, as the name suggests, are complex computer viruses that change shape as they spread in order to avoid detection by antivirus programs. This is a self-encrypting virus that combines a mutation engine with a self-propagating code. A polymorphic virus consists of:\n\nEncrypted virus body mutation engine that generates random decryption routines.\n\nA polymorphic virus has its mutation engine and virus body encrypted. When an infected program is run, a virus decryption routine takes control of the computer and decrypts the virus body and mutation engine.\n\nControl is then passed to the virus to detect new programs to infect. Since the body of the virus is encrypted and the decryption routine varies from infection to infection, virus scanners cannot look for a fixed signature or fixed decryption routine, making detection more difficult.\n\nPlease refer to the article Polymorphic Viruses to learn more about this topic.\n\n49. What is a Botnet?\n\nA botnet (short for “robot network”) is a network of malware-infected computers under the control of a single attacker known as a “bot herder”.

What is the difference between HIDS and NIDS?\n\nHIDS: This intrusion detection system sees the host itself as a whole world. It can be a computer (PC) or a server that can act as a standalone system and analyze and monitor its own internals. It works by looking at the files/data coming in and out of the host you’re working on. It works by taking existing file system snapshots from a previously taken file system and comparing them to each other. If they are the same, it means the host is safe and not under attack, but a change could indicate a potential attack.\n\nNIDS: This system is responsible for installation points across the network and can operate in mixed and hybrid environments. Alerts are triggered when something malicious or anomalous is detected in your network, cloud, or other mixed environments.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Difference between HIDs and NIDs to know more about it.\n\n54. What is the difference between VA (Vulnerability Assessment) and PT (Penetration Testing)?\n\nPenetration testing: This is performed to find vulnerabilities, malicious content, bugs, and risks. Used to set up an organization’s security system to protect its IT infrastructure. Penetration testing is also known as penetration testing. This is an official procedure that can be considered helpful, not a harmful attempt. This is part of an ethical hacking process that focuses solely on breaking into information systems.\n\nVulnerability assessment: It is the technique of finding and measuring (scanning) security vulnerabilities in a particular environment. This is a location-comprehensive evaluation (result analysis) of information security. It is used to identify potential vulnerabilities and provide appropriate mitigations to eliminate them or reduce them below the risk level.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Differences between Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessments to know more.\n\n55. What is RSA?\n\nThe RSA algorithm is an asymmetric encryption algorithm. Asymmetric means that it actually works with two different keys. H. Public and Private Keys. As the name suggests, the public key is shared with everyone and the private key remains secret.\n\nPlease refer to the article: RSA Algorithm in Cryptography to know more.\n\n56. What is the Blowfish algorithm?\n\nBlowfish is an encryption technique developed by Bruce Schneier in 1993 as an alternative to the DES encryption technique. It is considerably faster than DES and provides excellent encryption speed even though no effective cryptanalysis techniques have been discovered so far. It was one of the first secure block ciphers to be patent-free and therefore freely available to everyone.\n\nBlock size: 64 bits\n\nkeys: variable size from 32-bit to 448-bit\n\nNumber of subkeys: 18 [P array]\n\nNumber of rounds: 16\n\nNumber of replacement boxes: 4 [each with 512 entries of 32 bits]\n\nPlease refer to the article: Blowfish Algorithm to know more.\n\n57. What is the difference between a vulnerability and an exploit?\n\nVulnerability: A vulnerability is an error in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to cause unexpected or undesirable behaviour. There are many ways a computer can become vulnerable to security threats. A common vulnerability is for attackers to exploit system security vulnerabilities to gain access to systems without proper authentication.\n\nExploit: Exploits are tools that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities. They are created using vulnerabilities. Exploits are often patched by software vendors as soon as they are released. They take the form of software or code that helps control computers and steal network data.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Difference Between Vulnerability and Exploit to know more about it.\n\n58. What do you understand by Risk, Vulnerability and threat in a network?\n\nCyber threats are malicious acts aimed at stealing or corrupting data or destroying digital networks and systems. A threat can also be defined as the possibility of a successful cyberattack to gain unethical access to sensitive data on a system.\n\nVulnerabilities in cybersecurity are deficiencies in system designs, security procedures, internal controls, etc. that can be exploited by cybercriminals. In very rare cases, cyber vulnerabilities are the result of cyberattacks rather than network misconfigurations.\n\nCyber ​​risk is the potential result of loss or damage to assets or data caused by cyber threats. You can’t eliminate risk completely, but you can manage it to a level that meets your organization’s risk tolerance. Therefore, our goal is not to build a system without risk but to keep the risk as low as possible.\n\nPlease refer to the article: Difference Between Threat, Vulnerability and Risk in Computer Networks to know more.\n\n59. Explain Phishing and how to prevent it.\n\nPhishing is a type of cyber attack. The name phishing comes from the word ‘phish’, which means fish. Placing bait to catch fish is a common phenomenon. Phishing works similarly. Tricking users or victims into clicking on malicious websites is an unethical practice.\n\nHere’s how to protect your users from phishing attacks.\n\nDownload software only from authorized sources\n\nDo not share personal information on unknown links.\n\nAlways check website URLs to prevent such attacks.\n\nIf you receive an email from a known source, but the email seems suspicious, contact the sender with a new email instead of using the reply option.\n\nAvoid posting personal information such as phone numbers, addresses, etc. on social media.\n\nMonitor compromised websites with malicious content using phishing detection tools. Try to avoid free Wi-Fi.\n\nPlease refer to the article Phishing to know more about this topic.\n\n60. What do you mean by Forward Secrecy and how does it work?\n\nForward secrecy is a feature of some key agreement protocols that guarantees that the session keys will remain secure even if the server’s private key is compromised. Perfect forward secrecy, also known as PFS, is the term used to describe this. The “Diffie-Hellman key exchange” algorithm is employed to achieve this.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, today, implementing effective cybersecurity measures is especially challenging due to the increasing number of devices relative to humans and the constant innovation by attackers. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals must employ various tools and techniques, including encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, anti-phishing measures, and vulnerability assessments, to proactively safeguard against and respond to cyber threats. As a result, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is expected to remain high in the future.\n\nWondering about the salary of a cyber security analyst?
