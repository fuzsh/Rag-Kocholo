You don't have to deal with postage or selling fees, meaning you can keep all your profits for your next shopping spree.\n\nVinted does provide a paid-for service that allows users to 'bump' their items to the top of people's feeds to encourage sales. However, if you don't want to risk damaging your earnings, there is a simply hack that works just as well.\n\nREAD MORE: Vinted customers at war over £2.50 shoes - and everyone is saying the same thing\n\nMum of two Nicole swears by messaging users that have favourited her items before she does a postal run, informing them that they could get their parcel delivered ASAP if they're interested. \"I guarantee you that, if you have like five or six people who have liked the item, someone will buy it,\" she said on TikTok.\n\n\"That means you only have to do one post run with all of your stuff, you get a few extra parcels sold and sorted. It just saves time and obviously sells your items faster.\"\n\nStraight away, viewers rushed to the comments section to share their thoughts - and it's clear the hack had divided the internet. \"I've been doing this for ages and it works,\" raved one user. Another agreed, commenting: \"Completely agree! It's worked so much for me and I've managed to sell loads!\" while a third added the hack works 'every time' for her.\n\nHowever, others branded the hack 'desperate' and argued it would put them off purchasing an item. \"I have tried this a lot of people just read it and don't buy,\" one person stated. Another fumed: \"That doesn't work. [I've] tried it but people don't like the pushy approach on Vinted, even for a bargain.\""
