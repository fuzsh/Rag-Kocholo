        "text": "We believe monitoring plays a vital part in reducing humankind’s consumption of resources. Monitoring data helps our customers to optimize their IT, OT and IoT infrastructures, and to reduce their energy consumption or emissions – for our future and our environment. That’s why we offer monitoring solutions for businesses across all industries and all sizes, from SMB to large enterprises. We work with renowned partners, and together we tackle the monitoring challenges of an ever-changing world. Since 1997, when we first introduced PRTG Network Monitor, we have combined our in-depth monitoring knowledge with an innovative spirit. We know the challenges of complex IT, OT and IoT infrastructures and networks. Our products empower our customers to monitor everything, and thus help them optimize their resources.\n\nCheck out the product website\n\nRating: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nThis is an excellent product and integrates into almost everything. This has made our visibility of the 1000’s of resources we need to ensure uptime on are up and running. It allows us to centrally monitor all of locations and dispatch from HQ.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI have been using the free version on my network for quite a while now, and in conjunction with the Workstation monitoring and tracking that Spiceworks provides, a great software, 4 stars because i can’t do 100 sensors for free!\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nVery simple to set up with in-depth documentation. The setup was quite interactive and pointed you toward what you needed to configure next. Tons of available probes, great dashboards to view the health of the enterprise at glance or in high detail. Impressed with the product so far!\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI downloaded and implemented PRTG in less than 2 days for our 350-400 sensor environment.\n\nBeing able to monitor everything from UPS health and status to running applications and services on our servers has made a massive difference to the way I monitor our system health.\n\nThe maps are such a bonus, I’d like to be able to add a text box or two to help identify things a little better, but that’s no biggie. And Starburst view, that blew my mind! What a fantastic idea and received with such alacrity!\n\nHsving tried so many other monitoring products, this has been by far the most effective and I’m so pleased! Even the price is entirely reasonable!\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nGreat have been using this for a few years now and three different companies. Great simple tool that can help you establish baselines quickly. Then if you upgrade you get to dig as deep as you want.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI have been using PRTG Network Monitor for a year now and the product is fantastic. It is very easy to configure sensors. There are a multitude of notification options. You can even write your own scripts to monitor almost anything you can imagine in the rare instance that there isn’t already a sensor. PRTG has on numerous occasions notified me of outages and I was able to resolve before any users notice. After a power outage the software is invaluable because it can quickly help you determine what devices and services are not back up and running saving a ton of time. With a 100 sensor free license, it is a no brainer to install and start using today.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nA nice product to have. We’ve sweated bullets before when our network was acting up, and PRTG helped us see where the issues were originating, by showing up which sensors were constantly in an up/down flux. Definitely recommend this to anyone in need of a solid network monitor!\n\nOverall Rating\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nLet me start by saying that this software is excellent. After trying out many of the big-name network monitoring tools on the market, I found that they took too long to set up, and were too complicated to use. I became frustrated, until I discovered PRTG. PRTG was extremely simple to install, and the user interface is very fluid and easy to navigate. Adding devices is a breeze, and PRTG will automatically scan each device and add sensors that it sees fit, which of course are very customizable. We’ve been running it for close to two years now, to monitor everything from disk space and memory usage, to Cisco VPN access, to ESXi hosts and even our third-party temp/humidity monitoring devices in our server room using SNMP. PRTG is very flexible and powerful, and the licensing structure offers an excellent value. I would recommend this to any organization, small or large!\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nLooked at this a while back for some free monitoring software and the 10 sensor limit was much too small for me. Now they have changed that to 100 and I have come back for more and very pleased. There’s so much going on when you first start using it it takes a little time to find your way around but once you do the interface is very good and there is a world of functionality included. A sensor for everything! Great product\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI just discovered this awesome software, configured it for my home network and discovered how awesome it was. Browsing their website I discovered how complete was the documentation. Finally an IT company with a fabulous product and great support. I really appreciate the 100 free sensors offer. I suggest this software to anyone looking for a surveillance solution that’s easy the configure and very reliable.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nNice monitoring product, takes a little time to get used to how it works, but really powerful for the price once you do. Good SNMP and WMI probes and a cool ‘map’ designer for creating dashboards.\n\nOverall Rating\n\n5 out of 5 stars"
