This is the easiest way to monitor if a website (or a specific website element) is reachable.\n\nIt shows the loading time of a web page or element.\n\nRemarks\n\nNote: This sensor type does not support Secure Remote Password (SRP) ciphers.\n\nAdd Sensor\n\nThe Add Sensor dialog appears when adding a new sensor on a device manually. It only shows the setting fields that are imperative for creating the sensor. Therefore, you will not see all setting fields in this dialog. You can change all settings in the sensor's Settings tab later.\n\nSensor Settings\n\nOn the details page of a sensor, click on the Settings tab to change its settings.\n\nNote: Usually, a sensor connects to the IP Address or DNS Name of the parent device on which you created this sensor. See the Device Settings for details. For some sensor types, you can define the monitoring target explicitly in the sensor settings. Please see below for details on available settings.\n\nNote: This sensor type implicitly supports Server Name Identification (SNI), an extension to the TLS protocol.\n\nInherited Settings\n\nBy default, all following settings are inherited from objects higher in the hierarchy and should be changed there, if necessary. Often, best practice is to change them centrally in the Root group's settings. To change a setting only for this object, disable inheritance by clicking on the check mark before the corresponding setting name. You will then see the options described below.\n\nSmart URL Replacement\n\nInstead of entering a complete address in the URL field of an HTTP sensor, you can merely enter the protocol followed by colon and three slashes (that means you can enter either http:/// or https:/// or even a simple slash / as equivalent for http:///). PRTG will then fill in the parent device's IP address or DNS name in front of the third slash automatically. Whether this results in a valid URL or not, depends on the IP address or DNS name of the device where this HTTP sensor is created on. In combination with cloning devices, the smart URL replacement makes it easy to create many like devices.\n\nFor example, if you create a device with DNS name www.example.com and you put an HTTP sensor on it, you can provide values the following ways:\n\nProviding the value https:/// in the URL field, PRTG will automatically create the URL https://www.example.com/ from that.\n\nUsing the value /help in the URL field, PRTG will automatically create and monitor the URL http://www.example.com/help\n\nIt is also possible to provide a port number in the URL field which will be taken over by the device's DNS name and internally added, for example, http://:8080/\n\nNote: Smart URL replacement does not work for sensors running on the \"Probe Device\".\n\nEdit Sensor Channels\n\nTo change display settings, spike filter, and limits, switch to the sensor's Overview tab and click the gear icon of a specific channel. For detailed information, please see the Sensor Channels Settings section.\n\nNotifications\n\nClick the Notifications tab to change notification triggers. For detailed information, please see the Sensor Notifications Settings section.\n\nOthers\n\nFor more general information about settings, please see the Object Settings section.\n\nSensor Settings Overview\n\nFor information about sensor settings, please see the following sections:"
