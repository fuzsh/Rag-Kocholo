        "text": "Good monitoring tool\n\nWhat is great are the various ways you can configure sensors, especially custom sensors written in powershell, and to be able access rest api sites (or shelly devices) Also very good is the low cpu and memory load on the hosting system. I run it at home on a laptop. What can be approved:\n\nConnectors with grafana, more ways to access Azure monitor, better and more (custom) dynamic objects for maps, as i use it also to monitor non it systems\n\nBut -important- the free tier for 100 sensors is very good\n\nDate of experience : July 17, 2024\n\nLook Elsewhere\n\nI'm here because of a constant nag-screen within our paid instance of PRTG that constantly begs for a review, so here we are. PRTG is one of the worst monitoring software I've ever used. It is difficult to use & administer, documentation is poor if it exists at all, support cant/wont help you, and bug fixes/feature requests go ignored. Graphing, monitoring, etc is cludgy at best, sensors are difficult to create and randomly stop working. If you have a big network/many sensors you will end up needing 2+ servers & licensing just to keep the instance from failing entirely and nowhere near the limits Paessler claims. Every company I have worked for that uses PRTG ends up switching to something else, as we are now too. Maybe invest more development resources to features your customers actually want as opposed to a survey nag screen.\n\nDate of experience : July 16, 2024\n\nNot so good for my purposes\n\nUnfortunately, navigating through the webinterface is very time consuming and it doesn't seem intuitive, neither to say confusing. As I did not install the software, I can't rate this part. But from my expereience, it seems to be a very huge and ressource hungry system which is not very responsive. But this could be related to our server side. Personally, I experienced faster and more \"cleaned up\" open source monitoring tools.\n\nDate of experience : March 21, 2024\n\nFlexible NMS solution with accurate sensors\n\nPRTG Provides us a rich experience in handling Network & Server devices with quality sensors. We are able to get both Realtime as well as historic data with multiple custom attributes. Moreover MIB's are also supported for majority of our branded Devices. It is highly user friendly when compared to its competitors like Zabbix, Observium etc. Overall a great NMS solution for Enterprises.\n\nDate of experience : June 22, 2023\n\nReply from Paessler PRTG\n\nDear Sachin,\n\nThank you for leaving us a review! We are happy that you are enjoying PRTG and we love hearing about how you are using it.\n\nIf you would like to give us more feedback, why not become part of our PRTG Feedback Insiders. You can find all the information here: https://go.paessler.com/prtg-feedback-insiders\n\nYour Paessler Team\n\nGreat monitoring for home-use\n\nThank you for making 100 sensors completely free with no drawbacks for home- and private-use! Thanks to PRTG I stay on top of my servers status and can react accordingly. Error messages thrown from sensors are often descriptive so one doesn't need to manually dig up log files. The community and PRTG forums also helps a fair share when I was stuck on an SSH connection issue and I was able to fix it after all.\n\nDate of experience : December 04, 2022\n\nPRTG Does SOOOOOOO much\n\nPRTG Does SOOOOOOO much. The free version is extremely generous and gives you so much capability. Costs for upgrades is up front and easy to see. Nothing that I need to get weird quotes for or figure out different service plans.\n\nBy far the easiest product to setup for networking monitor that i've used.\n\nDate of experience : August 14, 2022\n\nVery Good\n\nAmazing software that is easy to manage to your own preference. Im using it monitor all of my devices, and it lets me know when any off them goes down. Its very pratical if it comes to keeping IP adresses.\n\nDate of experience : December 12, 2023\n\nReply from Paessler PRTG\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave us a review. We are happy to hear that you are satisfied with PRTG and that it meets all your requirements.\n\nIf you would like to provide more feedback or even participate in the development of PRTG, please consider becoming a member of our PRTG Feedback Insiders. You can find all the information here: https://go.paessler.com/prtg-feedback-insiders\n\nNetwork, Service and Performance monitoring at it's best\n\nI use both flavours. The 100 sensor \"free\"-Version to monitor various home office devices (Switch, WLAN, Wallbox, Energy, Temperature, my public webserver and Mailserver etc)\n\nWe also use a paid version to monitor our company network and services.\n\nVery easy to install, configure and can be Extended with scripts. If you look for a windows tool, then you should play with PRTG.\n\nIt's a service monitoring and performance measuresment tool. It is not as powerful like grafana with \"numbers\" or splunk with log messages. It's not a SIEM but if you know that, you will have source success. More like Nagios, Incinga, Whatsup etc but on Windows.\n\nDate of experience : November 29, 2021\n\nReply from Paessler PRTG\n\nDear Frank,\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to leave us this amazing review! The team here at Paessler is thrilled to hear such good feedback. We are happy that you are enjoying PRTG and we love hearing about how you are using it.\n\nCheers,\n\nPaessler AG\n\nbest and easiest monitoring software…\n\nbest and easiest monitoring software for \"non *nix freaks. Easy to install on Windows, easy to configure. 100 Sensors for free (totaly enough for small users). After that you pay but than you have also a budget for that which is much less than using a cloud provider... PRTG exists since i can remember to use computers (loooong time). Never changed their business modell into \"we do only cloud and 10 USD / month / sensor business modells). And its European :-)))\n\nDate of experience : October 21, 2020\n\nExcellent!\n\nSince we purchased PRTG our monitoring has been rock solid. The amount of historical data i can pull especially with network ports has been above and beyond helpful. The Ease of use and stability is by far better than any other monitoring program we have had in the past. Excellent product!\n\nDate of experience : August 10, 2022\n\nGreat software, but not for ja simple man.\n\nI am nothing more than a father trying to supply quality internet and devices for my children to learn remotely upon. I bought everything new (mesh wifi, switch, cable modem) and ordered the best cable internet I could buy. Sadly, despite new cat5e wiring and everything set up properly, our internet drops and the cable service provider claims it is not their fault. This software is so incredible it certainly has found a lot for me to read up on, but as just a normal person who is not a network professional, I am left in the dust. I will also add that the support of this PRTG company is second to none.\n\nDate of experience : March 09, 2021\n\nPRTG is the most flexible and…\n\nPRTG is the most flexible and intuative monitoring system available. I can literally monitor any device in my enterprise from Servers to UPS Units and everything in between. Easy to install and configure (Especially with the constanly querying Wizard) ... And as for pricing ... The cheapest Per/Node software that will please any size budget.\n\nDate of experience : November 23, 2020\n\nFirst impression is jaw-dropping.\n\nFirst impression is jaw-dropping.\n\nAll I did was install it, and it went out and crawled our network and found assets and then installed sensors and then built the dashboards. I got further in my sleep with this product than I have during my waking hours with similar products I have been vetting.\n\nDate of experience : October 12, 2022\n\nThe PRTG is a really complete…\n\nThe PRTG is a really complete monitoring solution. Easy to understand and also easy to start using. Once you get and master the basic monitoring, you start seeing more and detailed ways to get a complete picture of your infrastructure and pin point specific parts that need attention.\n\nYou can monitor a lot of aspects of your business, from API's, networking equipment, ISPs, etc.\n\nDate of experience : January 25, 2023\n\nEasy to use and consistent over time.\n\nI've used this at a variety of places, work and home over the years. I'm delighted that they have kept the interface simple and easy to understand through the versions. It's refreshing to come back to the same tool each time and still know how to use it.\n\nFinally, thank you for maintaining the free version at the same level. When I'm not in a systems role, I still enjoy using this tool at home and recommending it to others for basic network checks and alerts.\n\nDate of experience : May 24, 2020"
