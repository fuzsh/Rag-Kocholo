Once you’re done, share your map as a URL that is accessible either publicly or only internally on your LAN.\n\nFlexible alerting\n\nPRTG alerts you when it discovers problems or unusual metrics\n\nPRTG comes with many built-in mechanisms for notifications, such as email, push, or HTTP requests. With our free apps for Android and iOS, you can get push notifications delivered directly to your phone.\n\nAdapt the notification system to suit your needs and schedule alerts (such as ‘no low priority alerts at night’), or avoid alarm floods by using dependencies.\n\nYou can even use our PRTG API to write your own notifications."
