We currently use IPCheck, but I was wondering if SW could do this as well. So we could get down to one interface for managing everything.\n\nDrew5356 wrote:\n\nFree software called PRTG Network monitor, www.paessler.com\n\nFree version can monitor 10 sensors. It is pretty simple to install and can notify you via email/pager/etc if the website is unavailable.\n\nSpiceworks isn’t a realtime network monitoring animal.\n\nDrew\n\nThanks,\n\nWe use IPCheck now. But you answered my question best, SW is not able to do this.\n\nWe were wondering just so we could get all management down to one interface.\n\nThanks,\n\nWes"
