It is the most popular hobby among 3-18 year olds, whereas ice hockey is 9th.[5]\n\nFootball's standing is constantly increasing, especially among girls and women, where the yearly growth rate has lately been over 10 percent.[6] In season 2006–07 19.9 percent of registered players were female.[6] The Football Association of Finland (Finnish: Suomen Palloliitto) has approximately one thousand member clubs.[2] According to a Gallup poll, nearly 400,000 people include football among their hobbies.[4][5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFootball developed in Finland in the early twentieth century when Finland was still a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Russian Empire. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power in the October Revolution in November 1917, Finland declared its full independence and it was shortly recognised by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in January 1918. Football was first brought to Finland in the 1890s by English sailors, and it was first played in Turku. The first national competition in the sport was set up in 1906, and won by a school team from Turku. The Football Association of Finland was founded in 1907 and it joined FIFA the following year. Due to the sport's historically low status in Finland, the country has never really excelled in football. Only since the 1980s, due to the revival of Finnish football, has the country produced such international stars as Jari Litmanen, Antti Niemi, Sami Hyypiä, Mikael Forssell, Mixu Paatelainen, Teemu Tainio and Jussi Jääskeläinen.\n\nDomestic club competitions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe highest division in Finnish men's football is the Veikkausliiga, comprising 12 professional football teams. Below that is a league system maintained by the Finnish Football Association, with Ykkönen, or First Division, as the second highest division, with 10 teams. Beneath Ykkönen, each division is divided into 'groups' based on the location of the clubs. For instance, the Second Division, or Kakkonen, has 40 teams divided into four regional groups, each of 10 teams.\n\nThe Finnish Cup is Finland's national cup competition, open to all member clubs of the Finnish Football Association. In the 2009 season, 356 clubs signed up to take part in the competition.[7]\n\nAll Finnish domestic football competitions take place in the spring, summer and autumn, due to weather conditions. Similar systems are used in the other Nordic countries as well, except for Denmark which had that system in the past.\n\nNational team\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Finland national team played its first international match in 1911 against Sweden. Finland was still then a Grand Duchy part of the Russian Empire, and became independent in 1917. Finland have played in a few Olympic Games, finishing fourth in 1912, but have so far never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Finland qualified to UEFA European Championship for the first time in 2020.\n\nThe Football Association of Finland also organizes national under-19 and under-21 teams.\n\nThe Finland women's national football team made their competitive debut in the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football qualification.[8] To date, their most successful competition has been UEFA Women's Euro 2005, where they reached the semi-finals stage.[8]\n\nÅland Islands\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Football in Åland\n\nSince 1943 the Åland Football Association (ÅFA) has organized football in Åland. The ÅFA is a district association of the Football Association of Finland. However, the Åland Islands fields independent men's and women's national teams, principally competing in the Island Games.\n\nStadiums with a capacity of 10,000 or higher are included.\n\n# Photo Stadium Capacity City Home Team Founding year Cite 1 Helsinki Olympic Stadium 36,200 Helsinki Finland 1938 [9] 2 Tampere Stadium\n\n(Ratina Stadion)\n\n16,800 Tampere Finland,\n\nIlves 1966 [10] 3 Lahden Stadion 14,465 Lahti FC Lahti 1981 [11] 4 Paavo Nurmi Stadium 13,000 Turku 1893 [12] 5 Porin Stadion 12,300 Pori FC Jazz 1966 [13] 6 Bolt Arena 10,770 Helsinki HJK,\n\nHIFK,\n\nFinland 2000 [14]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
