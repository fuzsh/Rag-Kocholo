        "text": "This weekend saw the return of top-flight football in Finland and there was plenty of English involvement.\n\nThe top division of Finnish football is called the Veikkausliiga. It’s a 12 team league and the season usually runs from April to November.\n\nAlthough the league has just started, Finnish clubs have been playing for most of the year already with the League Cup taking place entirely during pre-season alongside friendlies. Most of these matches are played inside indoor arenas.\n\nAnyway let’s take a look at the English players who featured in Finland this weekend. The lower tiers begin next weekend.\n\nSJK 2-1 AC Oulu\n\nThree Englishmen lined up for AC Oulu but couldn’t prevent defeat away in Seinäjoki.\n\nCalum Ward in goal and Ashley Coffey up front played the full match having also played for Oulu last season. The new boy in midfield was former Stoke City youth player Jake Dunwoody who was actually lining up against his former side, having scored six goals for SJK last season. He lasted 80 minutes before being replaced.\n\nHaka 1-2 VPS\n\nTwo Englishmen featured in this match, both of who were making their senior professional debuts.\n\nLining up for the home side was Imani Lanquedoc who has joined Haka on loan from Fulham. The 20-year-old is yet to make his senior debut for the Cottagers and started this match out on the left wing. He was replaced at half time with his side 2-0 down.\n\nOn the opposing side was Alfie Cicale. Starting at left wing back, VPS’ new signing played 70 minutes in his first ever professional game. The 21-year-old has had a fascinating journey to earning his first pro deal. Having been part of the Norwich City academy as a youngster, he later went on to earn a degree at the prestigious Oxford University while also playing for their football team. After trials with EFL sides and a spell training with Swiss side Neuchâtel Xamax, he signed for VPS last month. It turned into a successful debut for Cicale with his side winning 2-1.\n\nKuPS 3-1 HJK\n\nTwo Englishmen were making their debuts for Helsinki-based side HJK at the weekend, having both joined the Finnish champions earlier this year.\n\nBrooklyn Lyons-Foster started at right back and Luke Plange was up front. Lyons-Foster, despite being 23, was making his senior league debut. The defender had captained Tottenham at youth level for many years but had not made their first team. He recently moved to Finland on a permanent deal and made his debut for the club as a substitute in a League Cup match back in February. He played the full 90 in this opening day defeat.\n\nPlange was substituted in the dying moments of the match. He’s back abroad having previously spent time on loan with Belgian side RWDM. The Crystal Palace forward began the campaign on loan at League One side Carlisle United scoring twice in 22 appearances before being sent out to HJK.\n\nIlves 0-0 Lahiti\n\nGoalkeeper Josh Oluwayemi was an unused substitute for Lahiti. He joined the club back in January from Portsmouth and kept a clean sheet on his debut in the League Cup against HJK earlier in the year.\n\nMariehamn 3-2 EIF"
