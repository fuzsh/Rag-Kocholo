        "text": "Famous Finnish People: Finnish Artists, Scientists, Leaders, Musicians, Politicians and Athletes\n\nAt first glance a traveler may think that Finland is a very cold country as it is famous for its ski resorts, not to mention the winter polar nights, the summer midnight sun and the fantastic light show from the aurora borealis. However, the country is actually an exciting place to be, where the western and eastern influences have blended through generations and resulted in a truly unique Finnish culture. Finland competes with the rest of the world when it comes to famous people and personalities that helped shape their nation and carved their own niche in the fields of science, the arts, sports and high technology. These are just some of many famous Finns who have lifted Finland’s name worldwide and made a difference in our world. Their purpose and stories inspired awe if not greatness.\n\n:: List of Famous People from Finland ::\n\nAino Aalto\n\nShe trained to be an architect but became known for her designs and her work on several glass sculpture pieces. She was born in Helsinki on January 25, 1894 as Aino Mandelin. Her family’s last name was later changed to Marsio. She married architect Alvar Aalto in whose architectural office she worked for after stints with the offices of Oiva Kallio and Gunnar A. Wahlroos. She and her husband Alvar were the first Finnish architects to adopt the functional architectural style in their works. Later Aino designed special glassware pieces for Iitalla. One of her most internationally-known piece, created in collaboration with her husband is the Aalto Vase or more popularly known as the Savoy Vase. It is a free-form glass vase with a wavy design and several sides. Aino succumbed to cancer in 1949.\n\nAlvar Aalto\n\nBorn in Helsinki on February 3, 1898, Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto was a designer and an architect, whose design concept had always been along the lines of creating a total work of art, from the exterior to the interior as well as the furniture, furnishings, glassware and lamps that will go into a building or house. Aalto’s career coincided with the economic growth of Finland during the first half of the 20th century. Most of his clients were industrialists and his building designs reflected different style influences he used throughout his career – from Nordic Classicism that have simple and clean geometric lines; to National Romanticism, a reaction to industrialization and going back to medieval style of architecture with towers and spires; to Functionalism or the modern style that subscribed to the idea that a building should be designed based on its purpose. Most of the buildings he designed are found in his home country, in Denmark, Switzerland and Estonia. He was the designer of MIT’s Baker House in Cambridge, USA. Aside from designing buildings, Aalto was also famous for his glassware and furniture pieces that are still manufactured today. Apple Stores around the globe use his Stool E60 and High Stool when there are special events and product workshops.\n\nWäinö Valdemar Aaltonen\n\nWäinö Aaltonen, a leading sculptor and artist from Marttila, Finland was born on March 8, 1894 to a tailor father. He showed interest in the arts as a child due to his being deaf. He studied painting for several years and traveled to Italy where he was exposed to futurist and cubist art forms. While he studied painting, his sculpting skills were self-taught. He became a nationalist icon in Finland during the First World War for sculpting busts and monuments of his countrymen. Most of his sculptures were cast in bronze. Some of the most notable pieces of Aaltonen are The Hero’s Grave or the Savonlinnan sankaripatsas in Finnish, started in 1919 and finished in 1921. He also created the Myrsky as a monument for the fifty-three victims that died while in the torpedo boat S2 that was caught in a violent storm on October 4, 1925 and sank near Reposaari, Pori, an island in Finland.\n\nBernhard Henrik Crusell\n\nBefore Jean Sibelius came into the music scene there was composer, translator and clarinetist Bernhard Henrik Crusell.

He continued his studies in Stockholm, performed as a solo clarinetist and was appointed as the director of the regimental band at age sixteen.

He studied literature at the University of Helsink and got interested in theater, driving him to write several plays. His first one was based on a tragedy in the Kalevala to which he gave the title Kullervo. Kivi also wrote poetry and a novel in the Finnish language entitled Seitsemän veljestä or the Seven Brothers in English. It took Kivi ten years to finish this novel. It was a portrayal of the not-so-virtuous life in rural Finland that was not immediately accepted by critics, because it was written in the Finnish dialect used in the southwest that critics considered rude and because the depiction is far from their ideal view of rural life. Nummisuutarit or the Cobblers of the Heath was a comedy he wrote that garnered the State Prize in 1865. The comedy is still being performed to this day. The lukewarm reception to his books led Kivi to drink heavily. He later developed schizophrenia, purportedly as a result of the advanced stages of Lyme disease.

Runeberg also wrote what is considered the best epic poem of Finland and the most famous of his works, Vänrikki Stoolin tarinat (Finnish), Fänrik Ståls sägner in Swedish or The Tales Ensign Stål in English. It took Runeberg about 12 years to finish the epic poem It contained several tales of what occurred during the Finnish War with Russia and showcased the heroism and bravery of the citizens of Finland. Contained in the tale is the first poem entitled Maamme or Our Land, which eventually became the national anthem of Finland. February 5 of each year is celebrated as Runeberg’s Day.\n\nArmi Helena Kuusela\n\nArmi Kuusela, born in Muhos on the 20th of August 1934 was the first ever Miss Universe title holder, officially Miss Universe 1953 due to postdating even if the event was held in Long Beach, California on June 29, 1952.

It is a variant of baseball, with a complicated set of rules, but is a faster game than regular baseball. Vertical pitching is one of the main differences of pesäpallo to American baseball. While he participated in several sports to varying degrees of success, Pihkala supported far right political activism and had been known to be a propaganda leader in the White Guard unit called the Devils of Kuhmoinen, a group that had committed several war crimes, particularly the summary execution of children living in concentration camps. He also supported the idea of creating a superior warrior race for Finland through eugenics and his creation of the pesäpallo had its origin to the racist idea of using the game in military training.\n\nKimi Räikkönen\n\nKimi-Matias Räikkönen is another successful Finnish Formula I racecar driver. He was born in Espoo on October 17, 1979. Räikkönen is known in the car racing world as the Iceman.

He eventually gained success, taking the 2007 Formula One World Drivers’ Championship when he was racing for the Ferrari team. His move to the Ferrari team in 2007 also made him the highest paid race car driver as his estimated annual salary amounted to S51 million. His nickname was derived from his cool, calculating, calm and relaxed demeanor in and out of car racing. Räikkönen is currently with the ICE 1 Racing team competing in the World Rally Championship.\n\nKaarlo Juho Ståhlberg\n\nKaarlo Juho Ståhlberg was the first president of the Republic of Finland. He was born in Suomussalmi on January 28, 1893. He was an academic as well as a jurist who had a major contribution in the drafting of Finland’s Constitution in 1919.

He then resumed his career in academics but was lured back into politics in 1914 as Speaker of Parliament. When Finland finally gained independence in 1917, Ståhlberg became involved in drafting a constitution. He supported the creation of a republic rather than the more popular constitutional monarchy during that time. Almost all his proposals made it to the constitution. He was elected as the first president of the Republic of Finland on July 25, 1919 and assumed office the following day.\n\nTapio Wirkkala\n\nSculptor and designer Tapio Wirkkala was born on June 2, 1915. He was a prolific artist and his designs ranged from plastic bottles, glassware, metalware, plywood and ceramics.
