        "text": "Some of these clubs have unique names which will leave you astounded.\n\nFootball fans all over the world are often very proud of the clubs they support and they proudly show off their club's crest with passion. That's what makes you a true fanatic in modern world.\n\nHowever, in football, there are some clubs which have some unique and funny names - which bring smiles to multiple faces.\n\nWe have made a list of football clubs with these unique names, which most people would not know existed.\n\nDeportivo Moron (Argentina)\n\nClub Deportivo Moron is a club based in Buenos Aires in Argentina and features in the Primera B Nacional, which is the second tier of the country.\n\nThe club was formed way back in 1947 under the name of Club Sportivo Moron and later it got changed to the current name. While making even more hilarious is the fact that they have 'Bingo Morons' written on their front side of the t-shirts!\n\nGo Ahead Eagles (Holland)\n\nA rather known entity in comparison to the other clubs, but their unique name helps them secure a place in this list. The Dutch club who are currently in the Eerste Divisie, which is the second division in the Netherlands, were a force to reckon with in the early 1900s and even during the 60s and 70s they have featured in Europe. They were in the Eredivisie recently and only got relegated in 2016-17 season.\n\nComing back to their unique naming, the club was found in 1902 and was first named as Be Quick and then it got changed to Go Ahead on request of the Dutch Football Association. Later in 1971 the suffix Eagles was added on then-coach Barry Hughes' suggestion as the Eagle was the coat of arms of the city of Deventer.\n\nFL Fart (Norway)\n\nAnother amusing name makes the list, FL Fart is a non-league club based in Vang, Norway. Fotballaget Fart, which is the club's full name was founded in 1917 and was dissolved within nine years and was refounded in 1934.\n\nThe club is mostly known for the accolades of their women's team as they play in their stadium named Fartbana. The club has given Norway international players like Thorstein Helstad and Kristin Bekkevold.\n\nDeportivo Wanka (Peru)\n\nAnother weird name which will have a lot of laughs and giggles in English. But the lower league Peruvian team finds their distinct name from the inhabitants of the city who were known as Huancas or Wankas coming from the central areas of Peru.\n\nThe club was found in 1996 in the city of Huancayo in Peru. The current club is merged with Deportivo Pesquero of Chimbote but their home city remains Huancayo, as they still play their home games at the Estadio Huancayo.\n\nThe club have been under the radar for quite some time now as their last First Division appearance was back in 2004, they protested against their relegation and were suspended from participating in any football tournaments.\n\nClub Always Ready (Bolivia)\n\nA club from Bolivia which is better known as Always Ready features in the Bolivian Premier Division league. Mainly owing to their jersey the club is also known as Banda Roja or The Red Band mainly due to their similarity in texture with the Argentine outfit, River Plate.\n\nThe club is based in El Alto, the second-largest city in Bolivia and adjacent to the capital city of La Paz. despite the peculiar naming, the club has a lot of legacy and tradition in Bolivia as they have also featured in the Copa Libertadores in 1968. Although the results were underwhelming their history remains intact.\n\nGrasshoppers (Switzerland)\n\nAnother comparatively little known football club in the list, Grasshoppers is a weird name for Switzerland's oldest and one of the most prestigious clubs. The club is a multisport organization based in Zurich and is one of the pillars of Swiss football even today.\n\nGrasshoppers was found in 1886 by Tom E. Griffith, an English student. The club shares an intense rivalry with cross-town rivals FC Zurich. However the origin of their name 'grasshopper' is clearly not known while some feel that it was mainly due to the energetic celebrations of the players after scoring goals and also their nimble and swift gameplay has drawn similarities with the insect Grasshopper. However, with 27 Swiss League titles and 19 Swiss Cup titles, the club makes it up for their awkward name.\n\nThe Strongest (Bolivia)\n\nClub The Strongest or simply The Strongest is the second Bolivian club in the list. The club is based in La Paz and was found in 1908, it is the oldest club in Bolivia and also the only club to remain in the top division for over a century.\n\nOriginally known as The Strong Football Club but it later got changed to The Strongest Football Club stamping their authority and also a great way to improve a club's marketing skills.\n\nSemen Padang (Indonesia)\n\nBefore the English speaking audience takes it in the wrong sense, Semen Padang is a club based in the city of Padang, West Sumatra. The club acquires its name Semen from its primary sponsor Semen Indonesia which is a cement firm. Although it is just coincidence, it is a weird name for sure.\n\nThe club is found in 1980 and features in the Liga 2, which is the second tier football league in Indonesia. Semen Padang FC also won the Indonesia Premier League as recently in 2011-12 season and were relegated in 2017 after finishing in 16th position.\n\nFC Santa Claus AC (Finland)\n\nFC Santa Claus or simply the Santa, are a club based in Rovaniemi, a city in Norway. The club was formed in 1993 after a unique amalgamation of Rovaniemen Reipas and Rovaniemen Lappi football clubs took place. The amalgamated club was known as FC Santa Claus which literally has the grand old man in their crest and their primary colour in their kit is obviously red.\n\nThe club currently features in the Kakkonen, the third tier of the Finnish football league. While their football may not bring smiles to the faces their name definitely brings the Christmas feels!\n\nBangkok Bravo (Thailand)\n\nThe name at the first glance does not look bad until and unless you see their original name- Amon Rattanakosin Krung Thep Mahanakhon Mahinthara Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Ayuthaya Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit Bravo Association Football Club.\n\nThe club is based in Thailand's capital city and has the longest name in club football history till date. However, as the club's name was renamed as Bangkok City FC in 2010, New Zealand's Taumata FC will give the Thai outfit a very tough competition."
