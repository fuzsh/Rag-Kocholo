Its national football team, the Die Mannschaft, represents Germany in the men’s international football. Germany also has many professional and amateur leagues.\n\nEngland\n\nEngland is credited with developing most football rules. They were first developed in 1863 in England before becoming the primary set of rules to be followed worldwide. England has more than 40,000 registered clubs and is home to the first oldest professional football club.\n\nMexico\n\nMexico is another country with a rich football history dating back to 1896.
