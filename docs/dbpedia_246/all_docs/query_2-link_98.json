        "text": "A year ago, the talk around the Los Angeles Kings was about how Pierre-Luc Dubois could help them better stack up against the best teams in the Western Conference and solidify the center position over the long haul when Anze Kopitar ends his distinguished career.\n\nThe rearview mirror now shows a Kings team in an uncertain direction after another first-round playoff loss, and with Dubois now in Washington, which looks more like a strange one-year experiment that failed amid a rollercoaster season that ended in unfulfilled expectations. The worry of Dubois and his eight-year contract being a potential unmovable albatross is no more.\n\nNothing has changed as to the end result for the Kings, but they’ll look a bit different to start the 2024-25 season on Oct. 10 at Buffalo. But have they changed enough to alter their three-year run of early playoff exits? Will the additions and subtractions benefit them or hurt them?\n\nThe Kings may not be any better. But the angst over Dubois is a thing of the past. That’s better. Right? Here’s a look at some potential lineup combinations.\n\nThe absence of Dubois provides a direct opening for Byfield to shift back to center, where Byfield is eager to play and where the Kings have insisted that’s where his future is. A five-year commitment to the 21-year-old Byfield, a $6 million per season, opens the door to him pushing his way toward being a successor to Kopitar as the No. 1 center.\n\nByfield is looking to working more with Fiala. The two only played 62 minutes together in five-on-five play last season but had some dominating possession numbers and promising expected goal metrics. “He’s such a dynamic player offensively,” Byfield said. “Just the way that he can control the game with his speed. His vision. The plays that he makes, not may guys can do that. If I can just be there with him – we had some chemistry going – I think we can be really effective together. Change the games quite a bit.”\n\nWhile Fiala often has played on the third line as the Kings sought to use depth to their advantage, pairing him with Byfield and giving them second-line minutes to explore their offensive potential should be considered. (The two will be power-play fixtures.) That might push Danault to 3C, but he and Moore should still play a lot. A larger question than which pair gets more ice time involves the complementary winger each group has. Foegele figures to be versatile, given that he moved up and down the Edmonton lineup and showed, in often skating alongside Leon Draisaitl, that he could play off the Oilers’ most skilled players.\n\nIf Foegele jumps into Byfield’s old wing spot on the top line, it means the Kings will have an opening for younger players that can expand their role — barring a late addition of a scoring forward. Laferriere had 12 goals as a rookie as he averaged 13 minutes of ice time. Jeannot has been a left wing throughout his time in the NHL, and his scoring touch has disappeared since his rookie season. The 27-year-old feels more like a replacement for the traded Carl Grundstrom, with the chance of being an upgrade.\n\nBut with right wing looking a little light in this lineup, it could be a path for Kaliyev to re-emerge in the team’s plans. The 23-year-old was scratched regularly last season and reportedly asked for a trade. He hasn’t been moved. However, Kaliyev didn’t accept his qualifying offer and remains unsigned. If he and the Kings do part ways, that could enhance Samuel Fagemo’s chances of making the club. Fagemo has scored 93 goals in his last three AHL seasons, but he’s seen scant duty between L.A. and Nashville in his NHL call-ups. (The Kings lost him to waivers before last season but re-claimed him in November.)\n\nWill the offseason changes mean Turcotte and Thomas get their chance to make the Kings and stick full-time? General manager Rob Blake has said it’s time to see what they really have in their young guys. It should be time for Turcotte to make the leap, and Thomas opened eyes late last season by scoring three times in his seven contests after getting his first promotion to the club.\n\nWhen Byfield played center, Laferriere often lined up next to Kopitar and Kempe as a right-handed shot playing left wing. Foegele could be the north-south equivalent on the second line, or round out a trio with Moore and Danault to fill Viktor Arvidsson’s old spot, which would help shape the team’s hard-working identity.\n\nKaliyev could be a possibility with Danault and Moore, as the two were among the forwards he played the most with when he was in the lineup. But while he’s played very little with Fiala and Byfield, Kaliyev getting another opportunity of top-six minutes as a potential finisher with two of the team’s most skilled players might rebuild his value. That’s if he is still around when October comes.\n\nWhile it feels unlikely that Byfield will be back on wing, given all the talk of playing center, this lineup accounts for him being put back in a familiar position if things don’t work as planned. It loads up the top two lines with familiar longtime faces but leaves the third and fourth lines with the combination of youngsters and newcomers.\n\nThis also factors in Kaliyev not being in the picture. The Kings re-signed the 37-year-old Lewis for a reason. It’s probably best that he doesn’t play all 82 games again, but he’s done so the last two seasons for two different teams and he’s just 26 away from 1,000 career regular-season. It would be fitting for the two-time Stanley Cup champion to do it in a Kings jersey.\n\nThe top pair doesn’t figure to change, because they have a chemistry Doughty appreciates, with Anderson also posting defensive metrics such as goals against and expected goals against per 60 minutes that were better than in 2022-23. Even his plus-22 rating at even strength was a tad better. Anderson enters the second of his eight-year contract.\n\nThings will look different once you move into the other pairings. Losing Matt Roy in free agency means a new partner for Gavrikov, who may have been playing on a bum knee after his collision with the New York Islanders’ Anders Lee. Gavrikov wasn’t as effective as in his outstanding turn late in 2022-23, which earned a two-year contract extension.\n\nYou don’t sign Edmundson for four years to not have him in the lineup. It feels as though the 31-year-old has been around longer than his nine seasons and 530 games. Andreas Englund and Kyle Burroughs give the Kings some experienced depth on both sides and can fill in when injuries arise. Overall, the Kings’ defense got bigger. Presumably, they’ll be harder to play against.\n\nClarke’s deployment will be the biggest question. In his 16 games last season, the 21-year-old was more of a power-play specialist (on the second unit) and was sparingly used in five-on-five play, when the Kings played seven defenders. How much trust will the Kings have in him playing a more regular role? It’s likely that he’ll have a strong defender as a partner, but Spence could be the one who handles top-four minutes.\n\nCaleb Jones got into 25 games with Colorado last season while also being tabbed for three of the Avalanche’s playoff contests. Jacob Moverare, over the last three seasons, has stepped in when the Kings were hit with injuries on the left side. The two should be, at minimum, top defenders for their AHL club.\n\nBetween his 19-game original turn with the Kings in 2017-18 and now, Kuemper has been a two-time top-10 Vezina Trophy vote-getter with Arizona, a Stanley Cup champion with Colorado and a No. 1 with Washington who lost his starting job to Charlie Lindgren. Kuemper is 34 now and is coming off a difficult year, but he also believes he can be a stabilizing force in net for a team that’s had several netminders carry the mail for them since Jonathan Quick.\n\n“Hockey-wise, it was really tough,” Kuemper said. “It was really frustrating at times. Obviously weren’t winning as many games as I would like. Not playing as much. That’s always tough to deal with. Just tried to keep working through it. Although I didn’t get to play a lot, I came to work every day. Continued to work on my game.\n\n“I’m looking forward to the fresh start next year and just getting back to playing how I like to play. Prove that last year was just a one-off. Getting a bunch of wins and helping the team.”\n\nRittich earned the backup job with a strong season after starting last year as the Kings’ No. 3 goalie. He could play often, perhaps getting the call twice for every three starts that Kuemper makes. In his career, Rittich has also shown the ability to grab the net for periods of time if he’s on a heater and if a team’s other option is struggling. The Kings re-signed Pheonix Copley even after he tore his ACL midway through last season. Copley should be a good support system for Erik Portillo, who had a strong first AHL campaign."
