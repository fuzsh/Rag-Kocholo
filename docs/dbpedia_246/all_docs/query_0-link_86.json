        "text": "Sofapaka midfielder Clifton Miheso has signed for Finnish club Vasa IFK.\n\nMiheso who was instrumental for Sofapaka in the Kenyan premier League last season got his breakthrough after the team who had been tracking him down decided to snap him up.\n\nHe will join the team in January as he awaits to complete paperwork on the move. Miheso who has of late been a regular in the national team had asked Sofapaka to release him though he still had a contract running until 2015.\n\n“I can confirm Miheso has joined Vasa in Finland and this is a great opportunity for him to show his potential and will act as a stepping stone to achieving his football dreams,” said our source.\n\nVasa IFK (VIFK) is a Finnish club located in Vaasa. It was founded in 1900. The club changed its name in 1988 after a merger with another club, BK-48, and was called BK-IFK during the late 1900s. The name was changed back to VIFK in year 2000.\n\nTheir representative team moved up to Ykonnen at end of season 2005 which is the second-highest level in Finland. The visit lasted three years and the team was relegated to Kakkonen after finishing 12th place in the 2008 season.\n\nVasa IFK have won the Finnish championship three times, in 1944, 1946 and 1953. They were runners-up in 1945 and 1951 and finished third in 1950 and 1955. In 1947 and 1948, Vasa IFK also won the league hosted by the FA.\n\nIn that time there were two separate leagues due to political circumstances. The other league was hosted by the organisation for the labour club."
