Players must pre-register\n\nBirmingham City Official Player Recruitment Process\n\nThe player recruitment department is tasked with the monitoring, selection and transition of players operating outside of our Academy environment. The recruitment team will work collectively with our coaches to the identification of players within the three phases of the player pathway.\n\nThe priority of the department is to recruit, develop and produce players able to reach the Academy’s core purpose. This process is player centered, focusing on the identification of players able to excel in one or more of the four corners associated to player development and, where possible predominantly recruit from a catchment area within an hour of Birmingham. The strategy will be collaborative in nature, planned and aligned to the profiles through each of the development phases where appropriate.\n\nPRE-ACADEMY\n\nThe Pre-Academy is a development programme designed to identify, assess and nurture local talented individuals between 6 - 8 years of age. The primary aim is to develop technically gifted individuals for our U9’s squads who become accustomed to the club’s culture and playing philosophy through weekly training sessions and games, allowing for an easy transition into the Academy way of life. The major emphasis of the programme is technical development. With the use of the clubs training facilities, and a structured coaching syllabus and games programme, our UEFA qualified Academy staff seek to increase player to ball contact time in a fun, inclusive and professional environment.\n\nCOMMUNITY TRUST\n\nThe Club has a very large Community Trust scheme operating a number of local coaching programmes. The Community Trust run a shadow squad programme for U12-U14 players participating on a weekly basis in a number of local grass root leagues. There is also a full time programme for the U17-U19’s.\n\nPlayers from within the Community Trust programme can be directly recommended by a member of staff for a trial period. In addition to this, each Community Trust coach working within the shadow squad and on the U17-19 programme acts as a spotter, recommending opposition players they have seen in the fixtures that their respective teams have participated in.\n\nSCHOOLS FOOTBALL PROGRAMME\n\nWithin the West Midlands area there is a thriving schools football programme. Through community links, it has been identified that there are some young players who only participate in schools’ football and may not be observed participating in local grass root fixtures. There are a number of reasons for this, the most common being a recent move to the area or little/no parental support.\n\nThe Academy continually supports West Midland District Schools at both primary and secondary level allowing the use of the training facilities for prestigious games in their calendar. School staff are also invited to Academy CPD events in order to aid their development as coaches. This relationship means there is the opportunity for talented players who are identified by school staff to be recommended directly to the Recruitment Manager/Officer. This may lead to an observation, and if suitable, an invitation to the Academy trial process.\n\nTRIAL APPLICATION\n\nThe Academy is always on the lookout for local talented young players. Should you or someone you know, wish to be considered for a trial please follow the procedure set forth below.

If you are looking for a career in football, and live in this academy catchment, then your best chance will be to join the Academy.\n\nAbout this Academy\n\nThis Academy offer an advanced football development and education programme supported by expert and dedicated staff.\n\nThis Academy is located at:\n\nThis clubs Academy use advanced technology and coaching methods to develop their players. They are actively looking for upcoming talent to join their academy, and are very selective about who gets in, as competition is tough.\n\nWith the changes that have taken place in the football academy system. Academy Category three clubs are now free (U12+) to recruit from all over the nation.\n\nPreviously, Category three clubs could only recruit talent within a 90 minute travelling time to the academy, but the FA have reconsidered this following thinking that the best talent should only fairly be allowed to play in the best academies even if they do not live nearby. This gives the very best talent the very best chances of success, thus growing our home grown talent for the international stage.\n\nThis has seen a rise in host families being recruited here, to help house young promising talent in safe family environments.\n\nUpcoming Fixtures\n\nWe have a whole programme of upcoming activities, fixtures and events. Check the times of each match or look up the match venue for any of the Academy age groups.\n\nHow to get a trial at this team\n\nIn most cases to get a trial at this team you would need be selected to have a trial at this club, so it is important that footballers are spotted in the right places at the right times. For some players, football clubs prefer a more direct approach such as sending in links to videos of themselves playing football, but it is worth bearing in mind that clubs receive thousands of these football CV videos each week and don't always have lots of time to watch them all. We have found the most effective way of getting scouted for a trial at this club is by following a few simple step.\n\nScouts regularly select young players from soccer school sessions and invite them to trial to places that are called football development center, and anyone can play in their soccer schools so it offers an open door for all players to get spotted and scouted.\n\nIt is also particularly good planning to take your child to soccer schools sometimes called football schools as soon as they are old enough, as their competition will be doing the same, so it enables players to develop their footballing talents in line with the same level as their peers.\n\nHow to get scouted by a Football Academy Scout\n\nFootball Academy Scouts offer players the chance to trial at Football Clubs. Many players are lucky enough to find themselves in the right places when scouts are watching games, but we are also very aware that good talent can slip through the net. Professional Football Clubs do offer football and soccer players the chance to directly apply for a trials by contacting them through official trial application routes, such as the clubs direct trials contact or through the Academy Development Manager.\n\nTo apply and get scouted by a scout please follow these details.\n\nUnderstandably they are not always able to respond to everybody due to the volume of applications, but this does serve as an effective way to alert football scouts about your skills and footballing talent with a view for those players and parents looking to take their football to the next level, eve professional and secure a genuine, and real football trial\n\nTo get scouted for a trial simply collect the following information:\n\nFootball Players CV\n\nCovering Trial Application Letter\n\nFootball Players Vital Statistics: Players position, Age, Date of Birth, Height, Weight, contact email/phone/address, current club, previous clubs, detail of any trials already attended, any representative success stories such as school, districts, county etc\n\nPlayers school, College or Scholarship they attend or currently attend\n\nA players Football Clubs Fixture list, mainly of your current football team, including match locations and kick off time to be passed to football scout. Please give as many dates a possible preferably for the whole season. No need to include training, just match kick of times and locations including postcode. This is basically your trials opportunity that will give the scout the opportunity to watch you.\n\nOnce you have collated all of the above information, email it to the football club.\n\nThey will assess your application and decide whether or not to send a scout to watch the game.\n\nFootball Academy Syllabus\n\nThe Football Academy Syllabus training programme at this Football Academy, and is the same to many Academies of Football is broken into technical and tactical Football training, with a special module for Goalkeepers.
