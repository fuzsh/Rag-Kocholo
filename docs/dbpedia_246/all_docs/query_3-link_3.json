These clubs do not yet appear on this page, but will once verified.\n\nWe are adding additional countries and competitions on a regular basis, and you can receive an e-mail when new countries and features launch.\n\nSee our Coverage Page for a full run-down of all leagues and years of coverage.\n\nAbout FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States. Since then we have been steadily expanding our coverage to include domestic leagues from over 40 countries as well as domestic cup, super cup and youth leagues from top European countries. We have also added coverage for major international cups such as the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores.\n\nFBref is the most complete sources for women's football data on the internet. This includes the entire history of the FIFA Women's World Cup as well as recent domestic league seasons from nine countries, including advanced stats like xG for most of those nine.\n\nIn collaboration with Opta, we are including advanced analytical data such as xG, xA, progressive passing, duels and more for over twenty competitions. For more information on the expected goals model and which competitions have advanced data, see our xG explainer.\n\nNote that player records are likely not complete for their careers. Players may come from or move to leagues we don't currently cover. This issue will go down over time, as we add new leagues and seasons. We will never in the future have less data than we do today.\n\nYou can sign up to receive an e-mail when new countries and features launch.\n\nFor more information, see our Launch Blog Post, the overall leagues/competition page with details on leagues and seasons we include, or our About Page. Let us know if you find an issue or have a suggestion.\n\nFBref is one of seven Sports-Reference.com sites."
