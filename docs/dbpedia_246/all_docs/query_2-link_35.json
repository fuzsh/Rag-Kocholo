Our experienced immigration professionals partner with businesses of all sizes to develop immigration strategies that can help you achieve your goals.\n\nFinnish law provides several options for employers of foreign nationals. Finland is a member of the European Union and the Schengen Area. Requirements, processing times, employment eligibility and benefits for accompanying family members vary by visa classification.\n\nBusiness visitors to Finland typically use a local version of the Schengen C Visa, unless they are visa exempt based on their nationality. The Schengen Area limits stay to 90 days in a 180-day period. Note that foreign nationals who will receive any monetary compensation from a Finnish entity require a residence permit, regardless of activities performed or duration of stay.\n\nThe main work authorization category is the Residence Permit for a Specialist, suitable for highly skilled experts. The permit can be issued for two years initially and can be extended.​​\n\nFragomen can also consult on citizenship matters and, as permitted within the confines of local law, may be able to offer citizenship assistance."
