        "text": "When you think of Finland, do you picture a land of snowy landscapes and Northern lights? Or innovative design, cutting-edge technology, and a world-class education system?\n\nThese are all cool things Finland is known for, and in this blog post, I plan to explore 50 things (and people) that make Finland a fascinating and distinctive country.\n\nWhether you’re planning a trip to Finland or simply curious about our Nordic nation, read on to discover what makes it so unique and remarkable. Then leave your own ideas in the comments!\n\nWhat do people know about Finland?\n\n1. Happiest people in the world\n\nYou might think that with all the darkness, Finns would be a pretty gloomy bunch. Instead, according to the World Happiness Report, Finland has taken the top spot for having the happiest people for several years in a row.\n\nIs it the saunas or having more heavy metal bands per capita than any other country? Maybe the answers can be found in the following cool things Finland is known for, read on and get in on the secret.\n\n2. The Finnish education system\n\nThe Finnish education system is widely regarded as one of the best in the world, with consistently high rankings in international assessments. The system is based on the principle of equality, which means that every child in Finland has the right to an excellent education, regardless of their background or social status. Finnish schools are publicly funded, and education is free for all students.\n\n3. Quietness and politeness\n\nNational characteristics are often exaggerated stereotypes, but when it comes to Finns being polite and quiet, you only have to board a commuter train at rush hour to realize some of it is entirely accurate. Not all Finns are introverts. There is simply a certain level of respect for the common space and other people.\n\n4. Maternity leave and the baby box\n\nNew parents receive a box full of baby clothes and necessary items for the baby for free in Finland. Employers and the state also support long maternity leaves, which means most new mothers can stay at home for much longer than their counterparts in other countries and make arrangements for part-time work afterward.\n\nNowadays, parents receive parental leave rather than just maternity leave. This means all parents can choose to take some time off when they have a newborn at home.\n\n5. Unusual competitions\n\nWhat do wife carrying, playing air guitar, and swamp football have in common? The world championships for all these exciting activities take place in Finland.\n\nThere are also less-known championships like berry picking and boot throwing, so everyone is sure to find an activity that suits them. These unusual competitions sometimes make it into the news outside Finland too.\n\n6. Finland is a safe country\n\nEspecially in big cities and developing countries, Finland is known for its stability, safety, and low levels of corruption. Reports support this and list Finland as the top country for stability, the safest destination for travel and tourism, and in the top three for the least corruption in the world.\n\n7. Finland is very cold\n\nMost people know that Finland is very cold, and some even think polar bears are walking around in Helsinki! There are no polar bears anywhere in Finland outside the zoos, and many people are surprised to hear that Finland is only very cold for part of the winter.\n\nIn the summer, temperatures can reach 30 degrees, and we have four seasons, with snowy winters offering the perfect setting for winter sports, beautiful photos, and getting into the Christmas spirit.\n\n8. Politicians like Sanna Marin\n\nWhile famous in their own countries, it is unusual for politics or politicians from small countries to make headlines elsewhere.\n\nFinnish prime minister Sanna Marin has become well known for breaking the traditions and some expectations by making sure she can do anything others her age can, including dancing at a party.\n\nMany well-known celebrities and politicians around the world have supported her. Hillary Clinton encouraged her to keep on dancing.\n\n9. Finnish social welfare system\n\nFinland is known as one of the welfare states. Most Finns are reportedly happy to pay relatively high taxes in exchange for low-cost or free healthcare, education, infrastructure, and a more comprehensive social welfare system during tough times.\n\n“The Nordic model” has become quite famous after politicians like Bernie Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought it up.\n\n10. Paying debts\n\nEspecially in the United States, people know Finland as the only country that paid its debts in full after World War I. Over 3000 news stories were published on this between 1933 and 1936.\n\nThis quote is from Times Sunday newspaper and was published on 31st May 1936 :\n\n“The Finn is a rather dour, unsmiling fellow, who makes a fine friend but who takes life with great seriousness. He has a sturdy pride and self-respect. He wants to rely on himself. He asks no favours, and accepts no advice. He has an obstinacy and dogged determination that drives him on against tremendous odds. This doggedness has made him till the poor, rocky Finnish soil and to grow corn under conditions, which an English farmer would call impossible. It has enabled him to survive triumphantly six centuries of war and famine. And it is driving him to pay Finland’s debt”.\n\n11. Women’s rights\n\nFinland became one of the first countries to grant women the right to vote and was the first country to do so in Europe. At the time of writing this, there have been three female prime ministers and one female president in Finland. Today, Finland is one of the top countries when it comes to closing the gender gap.\n\n12. Finnish Healthcare System\n\nOften someone says the Finnish healthcare system offers treatment for free, but actually, it offers affordable public healthcare that everyone residing in the country is entitled to. There are user fees for healthcare services, but there are also limits for them.\n\nFor example, visiting a healthcare center can cost around 20€, up to a maximum sum equal to three visits. A day spent in the hospital can cost around 50€.\n\nPrices are considerably higher for foreigners visiting the country, as they have to cover the actual cost of the treatment, so it is still a good idea to have travel insurance when you travel to Finland.\n\n13. Clean tap water and air\n\nSome Finnish hotels have signs celebrating the fact that you can always drink tap water in Finland, as it is some of the cleanest in the world.\n\nAccording to data released by the World Health Organisation, Finland also has the lowest level of airborne particles, making the air quality better than any other country’s.\n\nWhat Finnish traditions and symbols are recognized around the world?\n\n14. The Finnish flag and national anthem\n\nAlso known as siniristilippu, the Finnish flag features a blue cross on a white background and is a national symbol of Finland. Unofficially, the blue color symbolizes Finland’s thousands of lakes and the sky, while the white background represents the snow.\n\n15. Kalevala\n\nThe Finnish epic poem, Kalevala, tells the myths and stories of the Finnish people and was compiled and edited by Elias Lönnrot in the 19th century. It is considered one of the most significant works of Finnish literature and tells the stories of heroes, gods, and mythical creatures with themes such as creation, love, and war. Kalevala has been translated into 60 languages.\n\n16. Saunas\n\nYou can find saunas worldwide, but they are an integral part of everyday life in Finland. Many apartments have either their own sauna or one shared by the building, and summer cottages usually have one too.\n\nThere are so many saunas in Finland that all Finns could go to the sauna at the same time, and the word sauna is of Finnish origin.\n\nNo wonder the Finnish sauna was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Heritage List in 2020. I have written a whole article on Finnish sauna etiquette if you want to learn more.\n\n17. Finnish language\n\nThe Finnish language is fairly unique in Europe and is most closely related to Estonian and Hungarian. It is also cited as one of the most difficult languages to learn, but the structures are quite logical. If you want to have a go at learning some basics, I have great resources available that will easily get you started!\n\nDid you know that Finnish inspired J.R.R. Tolkien’s Elvish language in Lord of the Rings? He became familiar with Finnish through Kalevala, and many years later wrote:\n\n“It was like discovering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before. It quite intoxicated me.”\n\nWhat a perfect bridge to take us to our next topic!\n\nWhat food and drink is Finland known for?\n\n18. Finnish drinks\n\nSeveral Finnish brands of alcohol have done well in international markets, including brands like Kyrö distillery’s Napue gin, known as the world’s best gin for gin and tonic, Koskenkorva and Finlandia vodkas, and more recently, even the very Finnish grapefruit drink Lonkero. The most important drink in Finland is still coffee. We will talk more about it later.\n\nWhile not all of them are well known outside Finland, I have written a whole article on Finnish drinks, in case you are interested in finding out more.\n\n19. Finnish cuisine\n\nFinnish food is not really well known around the world. Still, you do run into people who know about the delicious rye bread, rice porridge filled Karelian pies, Sautéed reindeer, Finnish fish, and Finn crisps, one internationally available brand name for the crispbread we call näkkileipä.\n\nThere are some wonderful things, from blueberry pies to yummy comfort food for the winter days, to discover: start with these 50+ foods from weird to divine.\n\n20. Finnish berries and mushrooms\n\nEveryone in Finland has the right to pick berries and mushrooms from the forest. It’s a concept called “everyman’s rights” or jokamiehen oikeudet in Finnish. To a foreigner, this can sound surprising, but Finns often fill their freezers with blueberries, lingonberries, cloudberries, and mushrooms in the autumn.\n\nThe different seasons and nearly 80% of the country’s land area being forests (the most in Europe) mean Finland has a lot of local berries and mushrooms available for picking but also in grocery stores and markets.\n\n21. Finnish fish\n\nFinland has a long coastline and thousands of lakes, so it is no surprise fishing is a traditional and popular pastime, especially in the summer.\n\nFish is used in many local recipes, and restaurants and market food stalls also make the most of the local produce. Quality fish products from Finland are exported, too (70 million kg in 2021).\n\n22. Finnish dairy products\n\nFinns drink the most milk in the world per person, but in addition to the usual things you’ll find everywhere, Finland has a few unique dairy products.\n\nRahka (quark), piimä (buttermilk), viili (mesophilic fermented milk), and kermaviili (nordic sour cream) are some products that differ from the international equivalents you’ll find elsewhere.\n\nMany of these products feature in popular Finnish recipes, causing headaches and lengthy discussions on how to replace them for Finns living in other countries.\n\n23. Finnish coffee culture\n\nThe average Finn drinks eight or nine cups of coffee daily and consumes 9-12 kg of coffee in a year. This makes us the country that drinks the most coffee per person.\n\nNo wonder, then, that coffee makes its way into workplace culture in the form of coffee breaks, and meetings with friends and even dates often happen at the coffee house. If you visit a home in Finland, you will also be offered a cup of coffee.\n\nSo when Jennifer Anniston said Friends couldn’t have happened in the age of cellphones, she must have forgotten about Finland!\n\n24. Finnish sweets\n\nThanks to especially Fazer, one of the best-known and loved brands of sweets in Finland, Finnish sweets are exported to over 40 countries.\n\nEven the royal family in Britain might be familiar with Finnish candy: Fazer sent a box of Finlandia gummy candies to the family in 1902 for Edward VII’s coronation, as a wedding present to crown princess Elizabeth in 1947 and prince William in 2011, and in 2023 to celebrate king Charles III’s coronation.\n\nTo learn more about Finnish sweets, look at this longer blog post on the most iconic candies and creative ways to use them.\n\nWhat is Finland known for producing?\n\n25. Nokia\n\nThe Finnish multinational telecommunications company Nokia is still known globally, especially for its mobile phones and smartphones.\n\nFounded in 1865, the business was at the forefront of innovation and a leader in the mobile phone industry for many years.\n\nToday the company focuses on providing network infrastructure and services. Nokia sold its phone business to Microsoft in 2014.\n\n26. Marimekko\n\nThe Finnish fashion and design house Marimekko is known for its bold, colorful prints like the Unikko poppy print. You can spot people with their bags, jackets, shirts, and tote bags everywhere in Finland, but the brand, founded in 1951, is also very popular elsewhere in the world, including in Asia and the US.\n\nIn the 1960s, Marimekko gained an international following after being worn by Jackie Kennedy. Marimekko designs have been featured in collaborations with such global brands as UNIQLO, Ikea, and Adidas.\n\n27. Forestry and paper products\n\nAs forests cover over 70% of Finland’s land area, it is no surprise that forestry and paper products are an important part of our economy.\n\nThe main products are essential for everyday life but probably not something you think about much, including paper, packaging, and wood products.\n\nThe industry plays a vital role in Finland’s sustainable development, and forest management and conservation are hot topics.\n\n28. Mobile games\n\nAngry Birds from Rovio and games like Clash of Clans, Hay Day, and Clash Royale from Supercell are not only some of the most successful mobile games to come out of Finland but globally too.\n\nAngry birds became a huge international phenomenon when it was released in 2009 and spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs, merchandise, and a feature film.\n\nBoth companies have helped put Finland on the map as a hub for game development.\n\n29. Finnish innovations\n\nSince Finland has gained a reputation as a great place for start-ups and innovation, I’m sure the list could be very long. But some of the all-time best-known innovations from Finland include\n\nheart rate monitor\n\nAIV fodder (named after Nobel Prize laureate A.I. Virtanen)\n\nfirst internet browser with a graphical interface\n\nLinux operating system\n\ntext messaging over cellular networks (SMS)\n\ncholesterol-lowering food products (Benecol)\n\ndish drying cabinets.\n\nAccording to some sources, ice skates were an early Finnish invention too!\n\nWhich sports is Finland known for?\n\n30. Ice hockey and other winter sports\n\nFinns take fourth place when it comes to most players in the NHL based on nationality. There is a good reason for this: ice hockey culture is strong in Finland, and Finns celebrated the four world championships enthusiastically. Many recognize names like Saku Koivu, Teemu Selänne, Mikko Koivu, Aleksander Barkov, and Valtteri Filppula.\n\nAll winter sports are traditionally important to Finns and have a large following. Names like Matti Nykänen (one of the most successful ski jumpers of all time) are still very well known outside Finland.\n\n31. Finnish rally drivers and F1 drivers\n\nFinnish rally drivers and Formula 1 drivers have a reputation for being some of the best in the world. In rallying, Finland has produced legendary drivers like Juha Kankkunen, Tommi Mäkinen, and Marcus Grönholm, who have won multiple world championships and helped to establish Finland as a dominant force in the sport.\n\nSimilarly, In Formula 1, some of the most successful drivers in the sport’s history include Finns like Keke Rosberg, Mika Häkkinen, and Kimi Räikkönen. Overall, Finnish rally drivers and F1 drivers have helped establish Finland as a powerhouse in motorsports.\n\n32. Unique Finnish sports\n\nThere are a lot of Finnish athletes who are famous for their careers or doing great in all kinds of sports currently, from Lauri Markkanen in the NBA to Lukas Hradecky, the captain of Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. Finns even have the most summer Olympics medals per capita. But this doesn’t mean Finland is known for each sport.\n\nOne unique sport sets Finland apart: the national game is pesäpallo, which loosely translated could be nest ball. The game combines baseball and other ball-batting team games and was developed in the 1920s. It may not be as well-known as baseball outside Finland, but this uniquely Finnish sport is very popular and gathers crowds in the summer all around the country.\n\nNatural wonders in Finland\n\n33. The Northern Lights\n\nThe Aurora Borealis are a truly breathtaking sight on the night sky in the northern hemisphere, and Finland’s northernmost regions are among the best places in the world to see them. Finnish legends talk about the spectacular colors that light up the sky being caused by a fox’s tail sparking them as it hits the snowbanks. The name revontulet refers to a fox’s fires in Finnish.\n\nThe modern explanation is that charged particles from the sun collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. You can find my best tips for spotting northern lights here. Rarely, during solar storms, the lights can be seen in southern Finland.\n\n34. Finnish Lapland\n\nThis magical region in the northernmost part of Finland needs no introductions. Its pristine natural beauty and vast expanses of snow-covered forests and snow-capped fells are well known.\n\nLapland attracts visitors from all around the world to enjoy the northern lights, ice hotels and igloos, ski resorts, and opportunities for snowmobiling, dog sledding, and meeting Santa.\n\nIf this sounds like your thing, have a look at my guide to Lapland holidays.\n\n35. The midnight sun\n\nIn Finland, summers are marked by long days when the sun sets late or not at all. In the very northern parts of the country in Lapland, the midnight sun is a phenomenon where the sun remains visible at midnight or later. In Finnish Lapland, you can experience the midnight sun for up to 74 consecutive days at best, and the sun never sets during this time.\n\n36. Thousands of lakes\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, there are over 180,000 lakes in Finland. Most of them are small, but over 300 are larger than 10 km². Many Finns love to spend a large part of their summers by a lake in a summer cottage.\n\n37. Lapland reindeer\n\nReindeer are an iconic symbol of Finnish Lapland and integral to the way of life of the indigenous Sámi people. Reindeer are well adapted to the harsh Arctic environment and used for various purposes in Lapland, including as a source of food. The reindeer roam freely in Lapland, so be careful when driving in Lapland and keep your eyes open to spot them in the wilderness.\n\n38. Finnish archipelago\n\nThe world’s largest archipelago consists of over 80,000 islands off the southwestern coast of Finland. As well as plenty of rugged beauty, it also offers a glimpse into the laid-back island lifestyle.\n\nHome to several charming villages, the islands offer plenty of events and great food during the summer months.\n\nFamous Finnish People\n\n39. The Moomins\n\nOkay, they might not be people, but they are called the Finn family Moomintroll in the third book of Tove Jansson’s beloved series on the Moomin family.\n\nKnown across the world, the Moomins are incredibly loved in Finland. So much so, that most homes will have some Moomin mugs, which have become collectors’ items.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Moomins, I have written an entire article on the 10 life lessons Moomin characters have taught me.\n\n40. Santa Claus\n\nWhile he is famous around the world, if you ask a Finn, Santa lives in Finnish Lapland, in Korvatunturi. I have written more about things you should know about Santa Claus in Finland in a separate article. Many tourists come to meet Santa at his official residence in Rovaniemi too.\n\n41. Finnish artists like Akseli Gallen-Kallela\n\nOne of the most famous Finnish artists is Akseli Gallen-Kallela, known for his vivid and colorful depictions of Finnish landscapes and mythology.\n\nAnother notable artist you might know is Helene Schjerfbeck, who is renowned for her expressive and introspective portraits.
