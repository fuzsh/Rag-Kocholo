        "text": "Here in Canada, we're pretty tough when it comes to the cold.\n\nWe take pride in playing hockey for hours on a frozen pond, in sub-zero weather - to the point where your nose is dripping and you can't feel your toes.\n\nWe love the Grey Cup too - there's just something extra special about those games played in the cold and snow of Edmonton or Regina or Winnipeg.\n\nBut what about soccer? Who plays that in the dead of winter?\n\nWell, a team in Finland does.\n\nThey're called Rovaniemen Palloseura, they play in the Finnish premier league, and they're based in the Arctic Circle.\n\nIn other words, they play pretty much their entire season in the freezing cold - often in temperatures as low as -18 degrees Celsius.\n\nAt times, it is so cold the players can hardly breathe.\n\nHere's a short film on the club. It's part of a series from Ford's Fascinating World of Football.\n\n\"Playing football is very challenging when it's so cold,\" goalkeeper Pauli Tuisku says.\n\n\"The ball feels heavier and your feet can be painful. In goal in this weather you cannot stay still for a second - if you do, you're finished. I jump and run in the goal during the game to stay warm.\"\n\nThat said, it's not like this is new. The club has been playing in the Arctic for more than 60 years since it was founded in 1950.\n\n\"Growing up here, the cold is normal,\" says defender Tuomo Könönen. \"We still feel it of course, especially when winter first arrives, but we're used to it.\"\n\nMaybe, but what about players on the team from other countries? Palloseura has three players from Nigeria, one from Mexico and one from El Salvador.\n\n\"They are shocked when they arrive here,\" laughs Könönen, \"but after a while they're fine.\"\n\nHere's another video on the club from The Guardian.\n\nAlong with the cold, there's the issue of sunlight. In the Arctic, at this time of year, there's only a few hours of daylight - that's it.\n\nThat can make it tough to train and get motivated - getting up when it's dark and freezing. Plus, without much sunlight, the players have to take Vitamin D supplements.\n\nBy the way, Ford's Fascinating World of Football is a 3-month series of weekly stories highlighting some of the more unusual stories of European football.\n\nYou can follow the tour here.\n\nRelated stories\n\nItalian Soccer Star Walks Off The Field In Protest Against Racist Chants From Fans\n\nThis Is Why We're Taught To Never Give Up: Amazing Double Save By Soccer Goalie In Peru"
