        "text": "Sure, haven't you heard of Sami Hyypiä (Liverpool)?\n\nWe also have\n\nJussi Jääskeläinen (Bolton)\n\nJani Tanska (Charlton)\n\nAntti Niemi (Fulham)\n\nTeemu Tainio (Tottenham)\n\nPeter Enckelman (Blackburn)\n\nTo sum up the EPL players from Finland.\n\nAnd since you follow the Dutch league, maybe you have heard of Mika Väyrynen (PSV Eindhoven)?\n\nThen there are several in the Championship and other leagues in Europe.\n\nI don't know anything about the finnish league, but I know they had a team in the CL some years ago, HJK Helsinki (1998/99 season), that beat Benfica home.\n\nAlso the Finnish NT is quite good and competes with sides such as Poland and Portugal in the Euro Qualification, if you have followed it.\n\nHere is more info on the league http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veikkausliiga\n\nAnd on the NT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland_national_football_team\n\nVeikkausliiga clubs for 2007​\n\nTampere United (Tampere)\n\nHJK (Helsinki)\n\nFC Haka (Valkeakoski)\n\nFC Honka (Espoo)\n\nIFK Mariehamn (Mariehamn)\n\nMyPa (Anjalankoski)\n\nTPS (Turku)\n\nFC Lahti (Lahti)\n\nVPS (Vaasa)\n\nFC Inter (Turku)\n\nFC KooTeePee (Kotka)\n\nFF Jaro (Pietersaari)\n\nAC Oulu (Oulu)\n\nViikingit (Vuorsaari)\n\nAttendance is rising every year. On an average day, a team can draw about 3,000 fans. Of course, this changes if a rival club comes in. The Turku derby brings out 7,000 people everytime. There's a growing rivalry with HJK, IFK Mariehamn and FC Espoo.\n\nThe Finns play more of a defensive game. You'll never see outrageous scorelines. It's just tactical, Scandinavian soccer.\n\nAnything else?\n\nI dont know so much about our little brother but I can give you some information at least.\n\nIFK Mariehamn who comes from the island Åland, is a middle team in the league wich is very fun for us swedes. The island only speaks swedish and so do the players in the team. Apart from the names of the team and that a Helinki-team has the most fans i dont know more. I can post some fan-pictures if you dont mind (they are not the most attractive people in the world and their fans isnt top-class...)\n\nFC Jokerit:\n\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/3407/hml2003b6qg.jpg\n\nLahti:\n\nhttp://img504.imageshack.us/img504/560/17sy.jpg\n\nTPS Turku:\n\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/7340/tifofoto39c7ym.jpg\n\nHelsingfors IFK:\n\nhttp://img115.imageshack.us/img115/4421/1tifo1jp.jpg\n\nHJK Helsinki:\n\nhttp://img297.imageshack.us/img297/4876/13uh1.jpg\n\nhttp://img469.imageshack.us/img469/6458/tifofoto39c2st.jpg\n\nThis one is actually quite hilarious.\n\nIFK Mariehamn:\n\nhttp://img478.imageshack.us/img478/9127/dsc09692xs.jpg\n\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/8720/1atifofoto7npfh4.jpg\n\nGod, I hate Finland...\n\nFew people really know about it really, because people just refer to the whole area as Scandinavia. The only people who use Fennoscandia are geographers and Danes.\n\nFC Viikingit are from Helsinki, suburb called vuosaari.\n\nAllso its FC Honka, not FC Espoo.\n\nIn this season, there are two teams above others, Tampere and HJK. HJK was founded 100 years ago, being the oldest team in the league.\n\nhttp://www.veikkausliiga.com/inenglish/Inenglish.aspx\n\nHJK 3 7\n\nTamU 3 7\n\nFC KooTeePee 4 6\n\nFC Haka 3 6\n\nAC Oulu 4 5\n\nFF Jaro 3 4\n\nTPS 3 4\n\nFC Viikingit 3 4\n\nFC Lahti 3 4\n\nFC Inter 3 3\n\nIFK Mariehamn 3 3\n\nFC Honka 3 3\n\nVPS 3 2\n\nMyPa 3 1\n\nSorry about my english\n\nAll I know about the Finnish league is from the massive gambling scandal a year and a half ago. A shady Chinese businessman bought the team AC Allianssi, fired the coach and replaced him with an unknown belgian, who in turn replaced the squad with reserves and six new signings from France and Belgium for the next game.\n\nAllianssi lost 8-0, and there was a lot of suspicious betting surrounding the game.\n\nDon't know what happened after that but I think Allianssi was kicked out of the league and that the new team leadership disappeared out of the country. Might be wrong, though.\n\nIn a nutshell, AC Allianssi failed to obtain a liscense to play in the Veikkausliiga for the following season. The club ceased to be, the players were signed and two teams came about again: Atlantis (Academy) and Allianssi Vantaa.\n\nYes. There was a gambling scandal in finland. Ye Zheyun haved some fun with his money.\n\nif you ever see that guy, just kill him.\n\nAnd at the end of march 2006, Veikkausliiga announced that AC Allianssi does not get league lisence for the season 06.\n\nAllthought they were allowed to get a license to Ykkönen, they announced that they wont take the place and they went bankrupt.\n\nToday in finland they played FC Lahti-HJK, wich is one of the biggest games in finland for the fangroups. Ofcourse, the \"average joe's\" doesent care about finnish football. They care about icehockey and Liverpool. F*ckin manwhores.\n\nThere was a litle fight after lahtis second goal, as 5-10 lahti wankers were on the middle of HJK fans celebrating the goal.\n\nThe game it self? 3-1 to lahti. Suprising result."
