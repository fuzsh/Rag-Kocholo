        "text": "In 1973, when Wizzard released their immortal Christmas song 'I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday' - it joked about an unrealistic fantasy, with the magic of Christmas dominating day-to-day life.\n\nHowever, for the residents of Rovaniemi, Finland, it is Christmas every day: or at least for most of the year. You see, tucked away in Finland's far snowy north, Rovaniemi claims to be the official home of Santa Claus.\n\nSanta was said to have called Korvatunturi home - a fell in Lapland. However, in 1985, he upped sticks and travelled south to Rovaniemi, where he is said to have resided ever since - and he even has a football team named in his honour, FC Santa Claus.\n\nREAD MORE: Where to go for snow: Seven frosty travel destinations bursting with festive magic\n\nFC Santa Claus isn't the biggest football team from Finland's frozen city, that honour falls to their local rivals Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS) - who finished second in Finland's top tier in 2015, but they are certainly the most famous.\n\nWhen they came into existence, in the early 1990s, legend had it the founders asked Jolly ol' Saint Nick if they could use his name. Juha Eteläinen, a spokesman for FC Santa Claus, told Daily Star Sport: “So I have been told [about the legend].\n\n\"It is and it isn’t, but I think there’s a good story behind that!\"\n\nWhat do you think of FC Santa Claus? Let us know in the comments section\n\nThe city of Rovaniemi, itself, flirts with the Arctic Circle: located just south of the frozen north, the city limits almost kiss the polar border.\n\n“Basically, we are living in our little city, and yes the conditions are a little different to most of the world, but life is pretty much the same,\" Eteläinen continued. \"At the moment, we are getting to the coldest time of the year.\n\n\"In January it’s pretty normal for the weather to be -30°C or even -40°C; once in a while, like once in a decade, it can get as cold as -45°C, or even -50°C, and that’s really cold!\"\n\nBut despite these Arctic conditions - and the couple hours of daylight in the winter months - the football team persists.\n\nEteläinen said, when asked how the team keep going in the conditions: \"We are trying to do some good and be friendly and smile! And also the photoshoots that make people wonder how is that possible? They're playing football in the snow.\n\n\"And it’s that interest, from our point of view, that capture the imagination of people from England!”\n\nHowever, to write FC Santa Claus off as just a gimmick would be a disservice to the club, who, ten years ago, were flying high in the third tier of Finnish football.\n\n\"We were really going forward to be a staple in the third tier, but sometimes s*** happens.\" Financial troubles plagued the club, and FC Santa Claus were unable to even field an eleven-a-side team in the 2020 season, before finding themselves in the sixth-tier last time out.\n\nEteläinen remains positive: \"After Covid-19 we fielded an eleven-a-side team again, and now we are where we are and the future will be what it will be - but I think it will be good! There is a lot of thing happening around the club!\"\n\nWherever the club land in the future, the Christmas spirit will remain - in fact, when Eteläinen picked up the phone to speak to Daily Star Sport, Christmas songs could be heard in the background.\n\nBut it's this fun attitude the club translates into the community, and hopes others can learn from: \"I’d say our motto, you can live a happier life: ‘Don’t stop believing’!\"\n\nREAD NEXT:"
