        "text": "Yeah, spectator-wise ice-hockey is number one in Finland by a rather clear margin. Football is more popular as a hobby and it has more registered players (same as Canada as I believe). Something is seriously done wrong in the Finnish football association as we are not able to develop top footballers for some reason - also the level of Finnish football elite league is pretty low and attendance is far behind ice-hockey.\n\nHow we are somehow good at basketball - I have no idea. Here in south basketball couldn't be seen anywhere before our national team played great in Euro 2013. There is smallish basketball hype going on here but it is still very unpopular. None of my friends have watched or played it, I only know just few basketball players by name and I am an eager sports fan.\n\nHockey is definitely the number one sport ATM, but IMO football isn't that far behind. Though I can't see football surpassing hockey as the most popular sport, it's not impossible that someday we see football and hockey pretty even in terms of popularity.\n\nFinland will never have any real success in football because football is hands down the most competed sport in the world, meanwhile hockey has and always will have at most 6-7 countries where hockey is viewed as somewhat relevant sport. Personally I would consider Finnish national football team making the WC or EC a better achievement than basically anything you can accomplish in hockey in the international level. The level of competetion between these two sports is enormous.\n\nThe thing that bothers me in most Finns is that they are either too dumb or just plain ignorant to understand that football and hockey aren't comparable sports at all. You can't expect to have same type of success in football than you can in hockey. Only in Germany you have more registered football players than there is hockey players in the whole world. Swedes seem to understand this and football is clearly more popular in Sweden than hockey.\n\nAs for other sports like basketball and volleyball, they'll never come close to being the most popular sport in this country and unless Finnish football completely falls of the face of earth, they'll never challenge for the second place either.\n\nSoccer is the king of participant sports in the Helsinki region and floorball is probably the #2. There are soccer pitches absolutely everywhere and most kids play organized soccer. I have no idea how floorball isn't more popular globally, it's a great recreational sport (pretty terrible TV/spectator sport though).\n\nHelsinki is a pretty bad sports town when it comes to following and actually caring about the local teams. Most people just don't care about domestic sports and have no deeper connection to any local club and only pay attention to big sporting events or big hockey/soccer games. I'd say a casual \"TV event\" fan is a good way to describe your typical Helsinki sports fan.\n\nHIFK(hockey), Jokerit(hockey) and HJK(soccer) are the only signifcant pro teams in Helsinki. HJK wins the league basically every year and when they do well in Europe, they get attention. The two hockey clubs are flagships of mediocrity, but have pretty stable following and large casual fan bases. F1 racing and top-level European soccer are popular TV sports. Domestic basketball, floorball, volleyball etc. have their own niche, and I really mean niche, following.\n\nIn general, I'd say sports and local clubs aren't part of the fabric of the city's identity the way they are in many other, comparable European cities though the 52 Olympics remain a defining moment in Helsinki's history.\n\nHelsinki is a pretty bad sports town when it comes to following and actually caring about the local teams.

Lots of new juniors started the sport and over 7000 Finnish fans will go to see World Champs in Spain.\n\nA lot of the animosity towards hockey among football fans stems from the fact that hockey has an all-encompassing status in the Finnish society - so much that it actually hurts the other sports. For example, there are many youths who are gifted in many a team sport, and might actually show more promise in something else than hockey, like football, but in the end choose hockey anyway because it appears more glamorous to them.\n\nAnd this is not speculation - it's a fact. I'm of course a hockey connoisseur above all else so it doesn't bother me personally, but I can feel the football enthusiasts' pain. Still, this is pretty much the only way a nation of measly five million can be world class in at least some team sport. Spreading the resources more evenly would mean Finland could produce more above-average teams in a wider variety of team sports, but not really be a championship candidate in any of them.\n\n---\n\nThe current status of basketball is kinda curious. I find the game entertaining to watch, and I'm NOT one of those who tuned in the first time last fall when Finland was doing well in EuroBasket. I've followed the game casually since I happened to tune into it during the Beijing olympics, so I wasn't actually all that surprised of Finland doing well in 2013 since I had already checked 'em out in 2011.\n\nThere's certainly a small boom for basketball going on right now, but I can't say if the game's here to stay. Let's keep in mind that occasionally you have countries that break above the radar for a short while only to slink back under some time later. It's even happened in our beloved hockey - Slovakia got a good crop of talented players born in the late 70s but couldn't keep up with the production after that.\n\nYou could argue that in basketball it is even easier to break above for a while because in hockey you technically need around 30-50 good players to maintain at least some consistency, in basketball you don't really need more than 15 if all the pieces fall together. Finland currently has a highly talented top crop who play together all the time, but it remains to be seen if they can produce the necessary replacements in 5-10 years' time to stay where they are right now.\n\nI have followed basketball since the 80's and remember when I was a kid and ToPo battled in some euro game against mighty Milan (in European level) and lost only by few points. The level of Finnish basketball has been quite good in the past too and now we are at our highest point.\n\nLoimaa Bisons who played it's euro games in Helsinki got crowds of around 6000 and for them it would have been even closer to play the games in Turku.\n\nI just hope new Helsinki Seagulls team can stay alive and get some success. You can clearly see in everything that it's now \"all Helsinki's team\" and there is little buzz going. Celebrities have joined the club's operations too.\n\nLike Jussi said for many sports the problem is the small arenas they have to play in but luckily in basketball (and volleyball) they are looking to play some games in bigger arenas too.\n\n\"Wolf pack\" aka Finnish National Team will play against Lithuania next monday in JÃ¤Ã¤halli in Helsinki and already 5000 tickets are sold."
