Mexico's women's team celebrated a historic victory over the U.S., with Italy and Panama also represented among the men's and women's medalists.\n\nTeams had qualified for the World Games through the previous IFAF Flag Football World Championships, which were held in Jerusalem, Israel in December 2021.\n\nThe tournament in 2024 will serve as the climax of the biggest-ever international cycle of flag football competition, including full continental representation for the first time.\n\nIFAF made the hosting announcement on the sidelines of the 2022 IFAF Women's World Championship in tackle football, which took place in Vantaa, Finland, staged in partnership with SAJL.\n\nIFAF President Pierre Trochet was in attendance to watch the defending champions U.S. women's national team defeat surprise finalists Great Britain in the gold medal game on August 7.\n\nAll games in the 2024 World Championship will take place at Pajulahti, the only official Olympic and paralympic training facility in Finland."
