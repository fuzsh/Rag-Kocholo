        "text": "1. Getting scouted while you play football.\n\nThis is a way to join a football academy, however is the least likely one. Simply because you need a lot of luck.\n\nThis is sometimes described as climbing the ladder to the top.\n\nYou basically join any soccer team regardless of the level. When you play, you will always have the chance of showing your skills and abilities.\n\n“This is the beauty of football, everyone has the chance to play, everyone has the chance to showcase themselves and succeed.”\n\nIf you are different, with abilities that overshadow the other players, and perform correctly in the soccer field, there will always be a chance of someone seeing you and wanting to sign you.\n\nKeep in mind that these abilities have to be trained, for example, if you want to be fast and impress scouts, you need to do speed training drills and exercises! Things don’t come just because of ‘talent’.\n\nAfter being scouted you will normally be invited to attend to football academy trials in Spain, more info about this in the link.\n\nAs Arsene Wenger said one time, you never know who is watching!\n\nThese can be football scouts actively looking for players or simply someone who is watching your game by coincidence and is impressed by your abilities. Check our new guide on how to get scouted in football.\n\nNormally, the person interested will try to contact you, your parents or most commonly your football coach. From there on, there is normally a football trial or even signing straight away!\n\nAnother way this can happen is by your football coach.\n\nThe coach in your team might know people or might have had a past in football and valuable contacts, so, if you impress and clearly show you are too good for the current level, many times your coach will identify this and help you on.\n\nSurprisingly this happens very often, as coaches in smaller clubs want you to succeed and have a career in football.\n\nSometimes, coaches might send you for football clinics or soccer camps in Europe to show your talents.\n\n2. Getting a football agent.\n\nOh! The controversial world of football agents.\n\nSimilarly to football scouts, the job of agents is to actively search for football talent and find them a soccer team.\n\nHowever, differently to soccer scouts, agents also take care of other parts like contracts and salaries. Normally, this is where they will take their fee.\n\nBut going back to the point of joining a soccer club, agents are people with contacts, a lot of contacts.\n\nSo, when you manage to impress an agent, they can be a helpful person because they can arrange trials or football scouts to come and watch you play.\n\nThey normally are very eager to do this because this is the nature of their business. If you succeed and become a soccer player, they succeed, and get a profit, ah. Everyone wins.\n\nThe truth is that most of the agents are around a higher level, and there aren’t many who might be looking around low level clubs. This makes it harder for you to join a club with their help.\n\nDon’t worry! In this website you can see a huge list of football agents in Europe. However, before you start sending emails, check out our last point on how to join a football academy in Europe.. Is the best one yet!\n\nList Of Agents In Europe And Spain\n\nNormally, an agent will help you once you are already part of a soccer club. However, there are a lot of agents or even people who have been part of football clubs and academies in the past, that might not be actively looking for talents, but if they see someone with special abilities they might be interested in helping.\n\nPRO TIP: Always try to record your football games, or just yourself playing football. This way, you can contact football agents by email and send them your video. You might be surprised by the number of agents that contact back. Specially if you are already in a good level club or if you look very good in your video.\n\nHow can I attend a soccer academy in Spain if I’m not from Europe?\n\nIf you want to join a Pro Academy in Spain like Alicante Academy you simply have to fill up our form with your information. If you are from the European Union you can join straight away. If you are from outside the European Union you will have to apply for a Visa Permit, this is quite a straightforward procedure and can be completed fast. Learn about the process to play in Spain if you are from outside the EU here.\n\nWe, as an Academy, take care of this procedure so you don’t have to worry about it.\n\nWhat is like attending a full time private football academy?\n\nIn our Alicante Football Academy, players breathe, eat and sleep football. A total unique environment of football that will put you in the best position to improve as a player, and take the next step to a Pro Soccer Club in Spain.\n\nTraining football twice a day 5 times a week, once with the academy and once with a team in Spain as a trial. So you are always taken out of the comfort zone.\n\nFootball trials\n\nIn our Soccer Academy you will be attending football trials weekly, this is the reason why you join an academy like this.\n\nWe train you to make you better and showcase you to teams of your level who might want to sign you after a trial.\n\nWe are the scout who never saw you, the coach who didn’t help you, the agent who never found out about your abilities!"
