        "text": "Football scouts looking for a keeper are looking for correct positioning, great reflexes, on the ball technique and smart distribution. All these qualities can be the difference between for you to get scouted by a football team.\n\nBeing a goalkeeper is an interesting topic regarding getting scouted because many people get the wrong perfection that goalkeepers can’t be scouted or that is harder. This isn’t true at all.\n\nActually, goalkeepers have it easier to get scouted due to two main reasons:\n\nFootball clubs are always looking to sign goalkeepers because there aren’t many of them and it’s hard to find a great goalkeeper.\n\nWe all know that it’s hard to catch the scouts attention, however, if a soccer scout is looking for a goalkeeper, you know that they are straight away focused on you as there’s only you and.. The opponent keeper. All eyes on you then!\n\nIf a football scout is specifically looking to find a goalkeeper they will be looking at:\n\nCorrect positioning. Seeing if you are in a correct position to make it as hard as possible for the opponent to score is a must as a keeper.\n\nReflexes. How fast to react to actions and getting there first will avoid many goals and dangerous situations.\n\nOn the ball technique. In modern football, a keeper is just another field player and teams that have a technically gifted keeper have a huge advantage when they have possession of the ball.\n\nDistribution. How you distribute the ball with your hands and feet can actually lead to scoring opportunities and completely break the opponent’s structure when they are trying to defend you.\n\nFootball scouts looking for defenders are looking for great 1 on 1 defense, tactical awareness and correct ball distribution.\n\nBeing a defender is another of those positions that have changed completely on the scout’s eyes in modern football. What they looked for in a defender before has changed completely and, of you’re smart, you can play to your advantages and show the soccer scouts you are a modern day defender.\n\nWhen scouts look for defenders they are mainly looking at these characteristics:\n\n1 on 1 defense. Modern football is becoming more and more offensive (link), and due to this, there are more 1 on 1 situations where attackers are running at defenders. If you can come out victorious in these challenges and win the ball from the attacker you have already won a part of the scout’s interest because this is very difficult to do and requires a lot of time to learn. Liverpool defender Van Dijk has won xx% of his 1 on 1’s this season. Wow!\n\nTactical awareness. This is a must. Most of the tactical movements and situations in football start from the defense because they can see the full field. If all the defenders are in sync and can push forward and influence the game when the team is attacking and push back and keep opponents off side when defending will show a high football IQ to the scout.\n\nDistribution. Similar to goalkeepers, modern defenders have a huge influence on the attacking side of the game nowadays. Short breakthrough passes or long balls in the correct spaces can really impress anyone who is watching you.\n\nFootball scouts looking for midfielders are looking for them to see the spaces and what’s around them, create chances and score and adapt to the situation of the game.\n\nMidfielders are the heart of the game, a good and smart performance where you command the game and create dangerous situations can be a game changer in the scout’s eyes.\n\nSoccer scouts could be looking at different types of midfielders for their club, however, these qualities are a must for all of them:\n\nSee the spaces. Whether you are attacking with a killer ball through, or defending with a great cover up, a midfielder should always be aware of their surroundings and especially where the spaces are. A midfielder that can do these things can be the key to winning a game, and sometimes, this is overlooked.\n\nCreate chances. Attackers attack and score, but, what if midfielders can do it too? You will have a tremendous advantage over the opponents in a soccer game! A goal of assist from a midfielder counts more to a scout and, as more scouts are looking to do things with data, being a midfielder with great numbers can make you stand out.\n\nAdaptability. You might have been expecting another attribute, but this is massive. Games can change at any minute, and if a midfielder can adapt to this, you have shown the scout you are ready for every situation. Holding the ball when the team is tired, attacking when opponents are broken, tucking in when they are in control, are just a few examples of reading and adapting to the game.\n\nAttackers and football scouts have always had a special relationship. Is inevitable for the football scout’s eyes to turn to the players that are creating the chances and scoring goals, is the way football is.\n\nI will give you the main obvious things scouts are looking for in a striker or attacker and two things that are always overlooked:\n\nScore goals (Lots of them). The more the better, in this case, the quantity or way more important than the quality. Sometimes, football scouts will only go to see attackers that have scored a certain amount of goals that season. When a club needs goals and a scorer there isn’t a simpler job for a soccer scout, look for the attacker that scores the most goals. Facts.\n\nGive good crosses. Very overlooked indeed. Whether you’re a winger attacker or a striker that has fallen to the wing, crosses can be a killer for well structured defenses, actually xx% of goals in football came from crosses in xxx. Sometimes a cross can be so good that people give credit to the person who didn’t rather than a scorer.\n\nExplosivity. Whether you’re a big attacker looking to physically trouble defenders or a floating attacker looking to take advantage of spaces, if you can explode in the right moment and get away from the defender you basically have half of the job done. This one is very big in the scout’s eyes."
