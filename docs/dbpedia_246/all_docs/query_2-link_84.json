        "text": "Norway is a country located in western Europe which comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The country shares a long border with Sweden and is also bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east while in the south Denmark is across the Skagerrak Strait. Norway has a population of 5.03 million people and the capital is Oslo.\n\nThe Football Association of Norway (Norges Fotballforbund) is the governing body of football in Norway and is based in the Ullevål Stadium in Oslo. The NFF oversees all aspects of football in the country including the Tippeligaen and the Norwegian national football team. The organisation was founded in 1902 and became affiliated FIFA in 1908 and to UEFA in 1954.\n\nThe Eliteserien (commonly known as Tippeligaen after the league's sponsor) is the highest football league in Norway. The competition was established in 1937 as the Norgesserien with 7 clubs. From 1948 to 1962 the championship was known as Hovedserien. Between 1963 and 1990 the name of the league was 1. divisjon (1st Division), a name that the second level league of the Norwegian football system 'inherited' in 1991. The Tippeligaen has been professional since 1992\n\nThe most successful club in Norwegian football since 1938 in terms of premier league wins is Rosenborg BK, followed by Fredrikstad FK and Viking FK. At the present time 16 clubs compete in the top division.\n\nBelow the top tier, the national league structure comprises the 1. divisjon, known as Adeccoligaen (1 section of 16 clubs), 2. divisjon (4 sections serving 56 clubs) and 2. divisjon (12 sections serving 164 clubs). The 4. divisjon through to the 8. divisjon are regional divisions administered by the various regional football associations. There is a system of promotion and relegation between the tiers.\n\nThe Norwegian Football Cup (Norgesmesterskapet i fotball) is the national knockout cup competition in Norwegian football. It was first held in 1902 but was only open for county champions.\n\n​\n\nThis format continued until 1933, when the cup was opened for all clubs of a certain standing. The competition was not made nationwide until 1963. The most successful club since 1902 has been Odd Grenland (now known as Odds BK), followed by Fredrikstad FK and then Rosenborg BK.\n\nAround 275 clubs enter the competition with the first rounds played in April, around the same time as the Tippeligaen starts. At this early stage the top premier league teams are usually pitted against fairly weak amateur teams, often in rural areas, on the amateur team's home pitch.\n\n​"
