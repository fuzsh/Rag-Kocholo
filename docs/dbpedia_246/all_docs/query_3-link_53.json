        "text": "Who are the best teams in world football? A common question that’s been asked through the ages, but one that isn’t always easy to answer. We’ve now got some help from the Opta Power Rankings.\n\nThe Opta Power Rankings are a global team ranking system that assigns an ability score over 13,000 domestic football teams on a scale between zero and 100, where zero is the worst-ranked team in the world and 100 is the best team in the world.\n\nThis means that you can finally settle that debate between friends where somebody believes Liverpool are stronger than fellow Premier League sides Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, La Liga giants Barcelona, Bundesliga behemoths Bayern Munich, Italian club Inter Milan or record UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid.\n\nClick below for a full explanation on how the Opta Power Rankings are calculated.\n\nOpta Power Rankings Explained\n\nThe Opta Power Rankings don’t just look across the top European leagues in England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal. They are updated daily and rank teams from 183 different FIFA member countries and 413 unique domestic leagues, providing a truly global rating system in men’s football.\n\nThis all means that you can compare football clubs across Europe to the best in Brazil and Japan, Belgium and Argentina, Switzerland and Qatar, Hungary and Ukraine and even Uruguay and Sweden. Want to know how Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema’s competition is shaping up in Saudi Arabia? Got it. After Lionel Messi’s move to Inter Miami in MLS you want to compare those sides to Ligue 1 clubs? Go for it. The possibilities are endless.\n\nIn our interactive tool, you’re able to search by a specific team (eg: Juventus or Manchester United), country (eg: Austria or Denmark), league (eg: Serie A or Ligue 1) or confederation (eg: South America for CONMEBOL teams or Asia for AFC teams).\n\nHave you checked out our Opta football predictions hub yet? Not only can you find the pre-match Opta supercomputer predictions for every game within the top five European leagues, you’ll be able to analyse games using the Opta match centres."
