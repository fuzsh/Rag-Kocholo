        "text": "FDS-West Brom has been working in Finland since 2008, when we first took part in the Kokkola Cup. We opened our first football school in the country in 2010.\n\nSince then, we have set up English football schools with more than 20 clubs in Finland. We have taken young Finnish players to France, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Italy, Latvia and, most importantly, England.\n\nOur founders, Kristian Heames and Scott Baines, head up the operation. Between them, these UEFA-Licensed Coaches have nearly 40 years’ experience in the professional game and more than 20 years’ work with young Finnish players.\n\nKristian was also head coach of FF Jaro for a year. This helped us develop our understanding of Finland, Finnish football and how to work with players to achieve their potential.\n\nOur English football schools\n\nOur schools are organised in partnership with Finnish clubs, with each club deciding how to organise its own school. Schools can be mixed, although some are specifically for boys or girls.\n\nMany schools take players of all levels, while some concentrate on those that want to forge a career as professionals.\n\nThe focus is on having fun, but we also make sure that the more able players are challenged. All our coaches are English, which helps the players develop their English language skills as well as their football. This is a real help for even the youngest children, who might be just eight years old.\n\nAbove all, our coaches always bring enthusiasm, passion, variety and a real English football approach to the schools.\n\nSelect training camps\n\nThe most talented players can step up to the next level. This consists of training camps for selected players.\n\nCamps take place throughout the year, across Finland. The selection criteria are similar to those in England: technical ability, game understanding, athleticism and, most importantly, attitude, personality and mentality.\n\nThe camps offer more specific and serious coaching to develop players on and off the pitch. We set the players the same professional standards we expect of English boys and focus on all parts of the game.\n\nWe have run attacking camps, defending camps, mentality camps, physical testing camps and tournament camps. All help players prepare for playing at the higher level of our programme and develop them as individuals.\n\nFDS-WBA Suomi teams and elite tournaments\n\nPlayers that show the right mentality and ability in training camps are invited to join our FDS-WBA Suomi teams/squads.\n\nThese squads, which include Finnish and English boys, play in tournaments in Finland and across Europe. This gives players the chance to make friends with English boys and improve their English, as well as helping them mature off the pitch.\n\nDuring these tournaments, they compete against some or Europe’s top clubs and best players. This is a great experience, which gives them confidence of playing at such a level and introduces them to travel.\n\nAll tournaments are for coaches and players only. This is so that the boys take responsibility for themselves and work closely with the coaches, focusing only on football, the team and the challenge of playing to their maximum.\n\nTypically, players are invited to participate in tournaments in Finland (Kokkola Cup, Eremenko Cup, Ajax Cup) before they take on an elite tour. This gives them experience of how our teams play and makes the step up easier.\n\nWe also invite players to England so they can experience English football first-hand. This also gives them the chance to impress English professional clubs.\n\nTrips for coaches\n\nWe also arrange trips for Finnish coaches to come and experience the English game. While in England, they get the chance to see what goes on in English academies and how this relates to their own work in Finland.\n\nMuch like the Finnish club visits, the groups we cater for can be from 15 to 32 people. Again, we organise everything except flights."
