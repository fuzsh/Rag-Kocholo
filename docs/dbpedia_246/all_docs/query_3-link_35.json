        "text": "Inter Miami CF winger Robert Taylor has been called to represent Finlandâs national team in their upcoming 2024 UEFA Euro qualifying matches in September.\n\nTaylor will first hit the road with Finland to visit Kazakhstan at Astana Arena in Astana, Kazakhstan on Thursday, Sept. 7 at 10 a.m. ET. In the following matchup, the Finnish team will face Denmark at Helsinki Olympic Stadium in Helsinki, Finland on Sunday, Sept. 10 at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nTaylor has featured consistently for the Finnish national team, representing his country at the U-17, U-19, U-20 and U-21 categories before making his debut for the first team in January 2017. He has played 29 times for the senior side to date, including being a member of the historic squad that helped Finland qualify for the UEFA European Championship 2020 and playing in the competition as the team made the first-ever appearance for the country in the continental competition. The versatile attacker most recently featured for the team during the June international window in which the team secured two victories in the UEFA Euro qualifiers.\n\nAt the club level, Taylor has recently excelled as Inter Miami clinched the 2023 Leagues Cup title to win the Clubâs first official trophy. The winger started in all seven matches en route to winning the competition, contributing in nine goals for the team with four goals and five assists to his name. He has also made 21 MLS regular appearances thus far in 2023, tallying two goals and five assists."
