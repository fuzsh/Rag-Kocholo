There are about 16 active clubs in the Finnish Rugby Federation, a big leap from 2001 when there were only two registered teams. At that point the game was played mainly by expats, but time has seen a lot of Finnish blokes getting involved in the sport; these days about two-thirds of players are Finns. The ladies have also joined in and recently gained prominence for themselves, and Finland, by comprehensively winning the FIRA European Championship Women's 7s, Group B, which earnt them a promotion to the European A Division. Legends!\n\nIf you join a rugby team, or just go and watch a game, you're likely to meet Aussies, Kiwis, Poms and other expat rugby players and followers from around the planet - some friendly rivalries!

For those with personal ambitions, refereeing in a 'small rugby country' like Finland can also quickly mean officiating at Championship level, being sent on exchange to foreign countries, and even involvement in international matches.
