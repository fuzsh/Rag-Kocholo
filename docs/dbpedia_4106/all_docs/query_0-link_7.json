        "text": "About\n\nThis children's musical is a departure from Satyajit Ray's usual social realist films and brings out the director's delight in fantasy and song composition. Goopy and Bagha are musicians banished from their respective kingdoms due to their terrible lack of talent. They meet by chance in a forest and their music captures the attention of a ghost king who, enchanted by the pair, grants them three wishes.\n\nThe film was an instant hit in India. The characters of Goopy and Bagha first appeared in the children's magazine 'Sandesh' with illustrations by Satyajit Ray's grandfather. 'Sandesh' created by Ray's grandfather in 1913 was a much loved publication in the Ray family and came under the editorship of many of Ray's family including his grandfather, father, uncle and cousin. Satyajit Ray himself revived the magazine in 1961 writing and drawing material for the publication which later passed to his son Sandip Ray who edited from 1993-4."
