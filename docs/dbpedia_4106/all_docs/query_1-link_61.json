        "text": "What makes an anthology? Generally, anthologies tend to be woven around a common theme, however broad, or a person, or even a persona. Contributions may be drawn addressing either a shared space (but with different temporal frames) or a shared time (but with different spatial frames). By those standards of compiling an anthology, 14 is a very unusual anthology of short stories.\n\nUnusual, because they are united neither by their vintage (drawn from different ages of Bengali and Hindi literature) nor by any common theme. The only feature that they have in common is the manner in which these stories were recreated and transformed by the cinematic genius of Satyajit Ray as he made some highly acclaimed movies with the general outlines provided by the short stories.\n\nThe stories in themselves did not often have much to distinguish themselves before a larger audience, as a result of which they have never travelled very much across the linguistic barriers. Barring the two stories by Munshi Premchand (the eponymous Sadgati and Shatranj ke Khiladi), all the others are from 19th (Upendrakishor Roychowdhury’s Goopi Gyne Bagha Byne) and 20th century Bengali literature (Tagore’s Postmaster, Samapti and Manihara; Parashuram’s Birinchibaba and Parashpathar; Prabhat Mukhopadhyay’s Devi, Premendra Mitra’s Janaika Kapurusher Kahini, Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay’s Jalshaghar and Ray’s own Pikoor Diary and Atithi).\n\nIn their own original contexts though, most of the stories had made their mark (barring Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne and Atithi, Pikoor Diary) because of important social questions they addressed or the tales they told. It was Ray’s genius, though, that really made people sit up and take notice of the tales that were told. With his own powerful screenplay and direction, Ray breathed life into stories such as Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Atithi (the kernel around which his last film Agantuk was made), and Janaika Kapurusher Kahini (made into Kapurush) that in some ways even their authors could not manage. Such transformative re-creation has turned films like Jalshaghar (dealing with the decline of the traditional landed class of Bengal) and Shatranj ke Khiladi (dealing with the decadent aristocracy of Awadh on the eve of its annexation by the East India Company in 1854) into period-pieces that can double up as social documents as well as cinematic legends; Birinchibaba brings to life the struggle between blind faith and the scientific temperament that dominated a large part of mid-20th century urban Bengali society, while Sadgati speaks of the evil of untouchability and casteism that plagues rural north India.\n\nThere are, however, several problems with this anthology that need be pointed out. The anthology was motivated by a desire to introduce English language readers to the original stories that inspired Ray, which is certainly an interesting idea. However, for readers who have little or no exposure to the authors (apart from their names), small sketches about who they were, which were their major works, what kind of issues characterised their literary works, and also perhaps a brief treatment of the social questions that get reflected in the stories in the anthology (for instance for Devi, Birinchibab a, Sadgati, Jalshaghar, Shatranj ke Khiladi) could have made the stories more easily accessible —and all of these could have been woven into an editorial introduction that this anthology badly needed.\n\nSecondly, the arrangement of the stories could have been much less haphazard. It could have been in the order that they were written (i.e. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, followed by the stories of Tagore, followed by Premchand, etc with Ray at the very end) which would have very subtly conveyed some broad shifts in the flow of Indian literature. Or even the order in which Ray made them into movies.\n\nFinally, a word on the translation itself. Translation requires equal or roughly proximate command over the source as well as the target language, because there are always figures of speech and innuendos and expressions that cannot be translated faithfully. If the translation is too literal, it can never convey in the target language the impact that the author intended in the original. Good translations also tend to be new acts of creation in the target language, changing the form of an idea without disturbing the content. Despite Chattopadhyay’s gallant effort in translating stories from two different languages across a large span of time, except for the authors that are closer to him in time, his translations do not convey the same effect that the original stories had done."
