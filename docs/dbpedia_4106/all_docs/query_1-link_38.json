It is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay’s 1929 Bengali novel of the same name, and is the directorial debut of Ray. It features Subir Banerjee, Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Uma Dasgupta and Chunibala Devi in major roles. The first film in The Apu Trilogy, Pather Panchali depicts the childhood of the protagonist Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his elder sister Durga (Uma Dasgupta), and the struggle of their poor family in a village.\n\nGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne (Bengali: গুপী গাইন বাঘা বাইন Gupi Gain Bagha Bain) is a 1969 Indian Bengali fantasy adventure comedy film directed by Satyajit Ray and based on a story by his grandfather Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury. It is sometimes released in the English-speaking world as The Adventures Of Goopy And Bagha. It is one of Satyajit Ray’s few films with an abundance of musical numbers.According to Ray, the film was made as a request from his son who had encouraged him to make a film specifically for a younger audience. Adapting the story “Goopy Bagha,” which was written by his grandfather Upendra Kishore Roychowdhury, Ray wrote the screenplay and also composed the songs and music for the film. Working with source material already familiar to audiences, especially in Bengal, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne has become one of Ray’s most well-known and successful films in India, but remains one of his least-seen or known films elsewhere in the world.\n\nCharulata (Bengali: চারুলতা Cārulatā; in English also known as The Lonely Wife) is a 1964 Indian Bengali drama film director Satyajit Ray, based upon the novella Nastanirh (“The Broken Nest”) by Rabindranath Tagore. It features Soumitra Chatterjee, Madhabi Mukherjee and Sailen Mukherjee. The film tells the story of a lonely housewife, known as Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee), who lives a wealthy, secluded and idle life in 1870’s Calcutta. Her husband, Bhupati (Sailen Mukherjee), runs a newspaper, The Sentinel, and spends more time at work than with his wife. However, he notices that Charu is lonely, and asks his cousin, Amal (Soumitra Chatterjee), to keep her company. Amal is a writer and is asked to help Charu with her own writing. However, after some time, Charu and Amal’s feelings for each other move beyond those of a mentoring relationship as Charu begins a latent sexual attraction towards Amal. Amal is unwilling to betray his cousin’s trust that has already suffered at the hands of Charu’s swindling brother, Umapada. He abruptly leaves, and after Charu hysterically submits to her disappointment in the presence of Bhupati, there is nothing left but for the forsaken woman and her humiliated husband to forge a contrived reconciliation.\n\nNayak (Bengali: নায়ক Hero) (released in English as The Hero and Nayak: The Hero) is a 1966 Bengali drama film written and directed by Satyajit Ray. It was Ray’s second entirely original screenplay, after Kanchenjungha (1962). The story revolves around a matinee idol on a 24-hour train journey from Kolkata to Delhi to receive a national award. However, he ends up revealing his mistakes, insecurities and regrets to a young journalist, who realises that behind all the glitter is a deeply lonely man. Her initial contempt for people like him turns into empathy, and she decides not to publish what he has revealed. His life journey is gradually revealed through seven flashbacks and two dreams during the train ride.\n\nJoi Baba Felunath (The Elephant God) is a 1979 Indian Bengali mystery film by director Satyajit Ray, featuring Soumitra Chatterjee, Santosh Dutta, Siddartha Chatterjee, Utpal Dutt among others. The film is based on the famous Feluda novel of the same name written by Ray himself. It is the second film of Feluda as well as the sequel of Sonar Kella directed by Satyajit Ray. After the demise of Santosh Dutta (Jatayu), Ray remarked that it was impossible to ever make a Feluda film again without Dutta. A very valuable property of the Ghosals, a golden Ganesh statue, about an inch height, was the target of the thief. On the other hand, Maganlal Meghraj, a wealthy Marwari businessman, had his eyes on the Ganesh for a very long time. He comes to know about the involvement of Feluda in this case. He invites Feluda, Topshe and Jatayu to his house and offers Feluda Rs.2000 so that he leaves this case. Feluda refuses, which angers Maganlal, and he sets up a knife throwing show, using Jatayu as the bait (much to the viewer’s amusement). After the thrilling adventures in Maganlal’s house, Feluda takes a vow – either he will avenge Jatayu’s harassment, or quit being a sleuth.\n\nSonar Kella (Bengali: সোনার কেল্লা), also Shonar Kella, released in the United States as The Golden Fortress, is a 1971 mystery novel[1] and a 1974 film by Bengali writer and director Satyajit Ray.[2] The film is an adaptation of the novel with minor plot changes and features the actors Soumitra Chatterjee, Santosh Dutta, Siddartha Chatterjee and Kusal Chakravarty among others. It is one of the most enduringly popular Bengali films and is still shown very regularly on TV. It is the very first film of Feluda on the silver screen.Sonar Kella is best known for Santosh Dutta’s performance as the childishly innocent but supremely confident thriller writer Jatayu. It is one of the most popular, acclaimed and iconic performances in the history of Bengali cinema. Many of his dialogues have achieved proverbial status. His interpretation of the character in this and the other Feluda film Joi Baba Felunath were so powerful that Ray modeled the character of Jatayu in later books on him. After Santosh Dutta died, Ray remarked that it was impossible to ever make a Feluda film again without Dutta. True to his prediction, later attempts to portray Jatayu in the telefilms and films of his son Sandip Ray have met with derision.\n\nJalsaghar is a narration of the end days of a zamindar in Bengal. The landlord, Roy (Chhabi Biswas), is a just but other-worldly man who loves to spend time listening to music and putting up spectacles rather than managing his fields ravaged by floods and the abolition of zamindari system by the Indian government. He is challenged by a commoner who has attained riches through business dealings, in putting up spectacles and organising music fests. This is the tale of a zamindar who has nothing left but respect and sacrifices his family and wealth trying to retain it.\n\nJoi Baba Felunath (The Elephant God) is a 1979 Indian Bengali mystery film by director Satyajit Ray, featuring Soumitra Chatterjee, Santosh Dutta, Siddartha Chatterjee, Utpal Dutt among others.
