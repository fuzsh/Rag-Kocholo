        "text": "\"'The Alien' was supposed to have its roots in \"Bankubabur Bandhu\" ('Banku Babu's Friend'), a short story that Satyajit Ray had written for Sandesh, the Ray family magazine. The script revolved round a spaceship that landed in a pond in rural Bengal. The villagers began worshipping it as a temple risen from the depths of the earth. The alien established contact with a young village lad named Haba (Moron) through dreams and also played a number of pranks on the village community in course of its short stay on planet earth. The plot contained the ebullient presence of an Indian businessman, a journalist from Calcutta and an American engineer. What perhaps differentiated \"The Alien\" from hitherto done sci-fi films was the portrayal of an intruder from outer space as a benign and playful being invested with magical powers and best capable of interacting with children. \"The Alien\" never got made in spite of the repeated efforts of Columbia, Ismail Merchant, Sellers' ex-agent and others\" â€• Kurchi Dasgupta (KDG)[source]"
