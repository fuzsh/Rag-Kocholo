        "text": "There are conflicting views about Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (GGBB) and critics have tried to read into it a lot. Marie Seton, Satyajit Ray’s biographer, writes that GGBB is as much for adults as Alice in Wonderland is. While Sandip Ray, Satyajit Ray’s son, says, “This is a children’s film, a children’s film and a children’s film… which adults too can watch.” Should it be only regarded a film for children, like Sandip Ray suggests? Perhaps, or perhaps it is more apt to talk about it as primarily a children’s film that has multifarious levels for adults as well. Watching it as an adult, makes one think about the many unsaid, implicit messages in it. For instance, it is hard to miss the anti-war theme of the movie. Some see Goopy as a Brechtian hero, while others see the film as a mirror to the Sino-Indian tension. It has also been observed that the film is a commentary on the babu and bhadralok cultures.\n\nWhile GGBB was initially criticized extensively by Ray’s foreign audiences and critics, it was hard for them to miss the directorial genius of Ray. For the usual audiences of Ray, GGBB was a drastic change from the realistic movies that he was, usually, associated with. The decision to embark on the directorial journey of GGBB was full of challenges as well as criticism (not the constructive kind) for Ray. But, despite the initial reservations about the movie in foreign audiences, over the span of 51 years, GGBB has received love and won hearts with the camaraderie and humanity of the two protagonists.\n\nThat GGBB is about two simpletons, who are quite literally “un-musical musicians” is known to all. What most people do not know, however, is that the story was originally written by Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, Satyajit Ray‘s grandfather, and if Marie Seton is to be believed, was one of Ray’s favourite stories! The original story by Upendrakishore is hardly four-page long. To make a whole feature film out of this story, then, a lot of changes and additions (and exaggerations, ofcourse) needed to be done! The film is laden with Bengali tropes and folklores. That is probably one of the reasons why it appealed much more to the Indian, specifically Bengali, audiences. GGBB became a part of the popular culture of Bengal within months of its release. It became the new “cool”. Not only did it break records of box office by running in the cinema halls as an audience favourite, it also was critically acclaimed.\n\nRight in the beginning of the film, viewers are introduced to Goopy as the son of Kanu Kyne, who is a farmer. A few minutes into the film, when the Maharaja of Amloki asks Goopy what is the Tritya (third) sur, we see Goopy counting on his fingers and telling His Highness that it’s Ga. Similarly, for the Shashtha (sixth) sur, he has to count again before telling it’s Dha. The Maharaja, then, orders that Goopy, who is a GaDha, be banished from the village, sitting atop a GaDha! For someone who does not even know what saptak is, to have this urge to be a musician, is amusing on one level, and disturbing on another. Music, and specifically, the practice and learning of classical music in India, like all other knowledge, traditionally has been the preserve of the Dwij (mostly Brahman) elite. Instead of labouring in his father’s fields, Goopy aspires to be a musician, thereby trying to break those barriers around the practice of music. The arts are, after all, a microcosm of society, that not only reflect but also amplify the inherent inequities. There is, therefore, a definitive caste and class implication in the practice of classical music, the origin of which can be traced right back to the Vedas, from where, the Savarna populace of India believe that all knowledge, including the knowledge of music, emanated. The Brahmans of Amloki village, therefore, must come together to concoct a plan to humiliate Goopy because he has intruded into a space that is forbidden for him and sacred for them. There are various cues all through the film that are suggestive of caste and class based discriminations against Goopy and Bagha. That these two men, eventually, go on to win a music championship, beating their highly trained competitors, who by implication are also higher above Goopy-Bagha in the ladder of caste and class, can, therefore, also be seen as an attempt at demolishing these systems of discrimination, and questioning the idea of caste/class specific knowledge and skills, which is one basic tenet on which the varna system functions.\n\nThe first time that Goopy and Bagha encounter each other is in a forest, after being ousted from their respective villages. Bagha is seen sleeping under a tree with his dhol kept near him, near but hidden. Goopy hears the sound of water dripping on something, the only sound in the otherwise nishabd forest, and while trying to find its source, bumps in Bagha. The artistic visualisation of Ray is something one cannot miss here, alongwith the dialogues. The camera stops when Goopy stops, it moves when Goopy moves. Goopy can be seen carefully crossing trees on a higher ground, going slightly down a slope, crossing a few more bushes. The camera then rolls to the huge Banyan tree, under which Bagha is sleeping. Goopy, initially, only sees the dhol from the crevices in the tree trunk, just like the audience. When the mystery of the dhol and its owner is unveiled, Goopy lets out a chuckle, almost like a sigh of relief, which wakes Bagha up. In order to ignore Goopy, he starts to drum his knees, yawn and crack his knuckles. Goopy mockingly copies all his actions. This mimicry is suggestive of how similar the lives of these two men have been, and also becomes the proverbial moment that changes their desolate lives by introducing companionship. The first thing that Goopy says to Bagha is – “Tomar dhol je jol pore pore dhol hoye geychhe, go!” The subtitle of this dialogue, as seen on YouTube, reads – “The water is spoiling your drum” – which at best is an example of semantic translation with the loss of polysemic wordplay of dhol. That the water is spoiling his drum is exactly what Goopy is saying, but the beauty of the dialogue in Bengali comes from the play on the word dhol which is impossible to recreate in another language, not just because of vocabularic differences, but also due to differing cultural contexts. The dialogues all through the movie are laden with puns and implications, which gets obliterated in subtitles, translations and dubbings.\n\nTwo of the most fascinating things about GGBB, which appeal adults and children alike, are the Bhooter Raja and Bhooter Naach. The character of Bhooter Raja was voiced by Ray himself using avant-garde audio techniques. After recording the whole dialogue between the two protagonists and the Raja, the dialogues of Bhooter Raja were re-recorded while being played at different speeds and frequencies simultaneously, to give the other-worldly effect. Bhooter Raja acts almost like a Deus ex Machina, the proverbial donor or provider. Accompanying Raja Moshai are a group of his subjects, bhoots, who are seen dancing in a six and a half minutes long sequence. The whole sequence is a testimonial of Ray’s pioneering use of music and special effects which were unheard of in his contemporary Indian cinematic contexts. He uses four distinct instruments – Mridangam, Ghatam, Kanjira and Morsing – usually associated with the Carnatic tradition of Indian Classical music, for each of the groups. Darius Cooper writes: “Each of these four classes had to be musically defined in particular ways as well in order to provide inspiration for Goopy and Bagha witnessing the musical execution. Ray uses a special percussion ensemble from the south, called chalavadyakachiri (sic), for this wonderful inventive presentation. An appropriate musical instrument is chosen for each of the four classes.”\n\nThis dance sequence, or Bhooter Naach, moves this musical cocktail of comedy and fantasy into the realm of the political, historical and social. The Bhoots are divided into four groups, with very obvious symbols depicting various sections of the Indian society. Some critics and scholars, including Cooper, opine that the sequence is a representation of various groups that inhabited Bengal at various times in history. Then, the war in the end of the sequence is a suggestion to the fact that now they have all departed from Bengal. The theory that gained more prominence, however, is that it is a rebuttal of the caste and class divisions in Indian society, and not specific to Bengal. Either way, there is a clear indication of inversion of positions, be it class or caste or both. The dance unfolds gradually, almost like a raga. It starts slowly, picks up tempo, with an inverted depiction of the caste hierarchy where the priests are placed at the bottom and the commoners are at the top, and eventually climaxes with bloodshed, which could be foreshadowing the anti – war theme of the film.\n\nEven those watching GGBB just for entertainment, have inevitably been exposed to the clear – sighted, yet evocative pacifism in the film. The Rajas of Shundi and Halla are brothers, with the latter being hell-bent on a war due to the tricks and manipulations of the power – hungry, conniving prime minister of Halla, aided by a magician (or necromancer) called Borfi. “O montri moshai, shodojontri moshai, theme thak” (Oh! Mr. Prime Minister, evil conspirator, stand still), then, is a song trying to make a point about people who deliberately encourage wars and spew the venom of hatred for their gains. The song places Goopy-Bagha in the position of critics who deliver the verdict of the minister being an evil conspirator. As stated earlier, many have also tried to look at the film from the perspective of the Sino – Indian war. Then, the relationship between Shundi and Halla Rajas could also be a hint to the famous slogan “Hindi – Chini Bhai Bhai.” Some have also seen the film as a commentary on conflicts like the unequal war that raged in Vietnam. The anti-war theme, the warmth and the pacifism conjugate and culminate in a song – “O re Halla Rajar sena, tora juddho kore korbi ki ta bol?” (Oh! The army of Halla, tell me, what will you gain by fighting this war?). The song comes to a crescendo when the hungry soldiers of Halla lay down their weapons and run to grab the pots of sweets that Goopy and Bagha have conjured for them through the boon of Bhooter Raja. So, despite the fact that Ray does not underline the anti-war theme, it’s there for all to see. It is not clear whether Ray had imagined or intended such an interpretation. But, the criticism of war as a tool of oppression and exploitation is definitely there in the film, giving a universal relevance to it, thereby rendering it timeless.\n\nHowever, despite all the powerful statements on war, hunger, caste, music and exploitation of the powerless by the powerful, GGBB has no female characters. Ray may have explained this absence as being true to the time and context of the storyline. The only two females that appear in the film are the two princesses of Halla and Shundi, and their only role is to marry Goopy and Bagha. They do not speak. They do not act. They have no agency, no opinion. They do not look at anyone. Their presence is only a token. For all practical purposes, the two princesses constitute the entire female population. This brings to mind the imagery of Betty Friedan‘s ‘feminine mystique‘, wherein she talks about how a principle of femininity has been established by decree in which desirability/ marriageability alone exists as a raison d’être. There is a prominent male image of the father as the ultimate authority, under whose hegemony, Indian women have to assume just one role – that of the subservient being. The other prominent male image is that of the grooms, who stand as symbols of male gaze controlling and dissecting female bodies, thereby redefining female sexuality and (re)shaping feminine identities. Michael Foucault points out, under specific kinds of power, individuals are transformed into subjects – to be controlled and to be denied individuality. That is what happens to the two women in GGBB. They are not individuals anymore. They are just a pair of ‘docile bodies‘ shaped by power, to serve power, and to become tools of transfer of power.\n\nThe treatment of women in GGBB as rewards, as prizes, as objects to be given away is something that is difficult to comprehend when one looks at Ray’s other works. In most of his other cinematic works and writings, Ray has depicted several extremely strong, independent, emancipated and empowered female characters, who are not confined to domesticity and fiercely express their emotions, desires and conflicts. To say that Ray’s repertoire of strong female characters are representative of his feminism would not be a stretch too far. But, the brand of feminism one sees in Ray’s films is very different. Smita Singh points out that even the strongest of Ray’s women are complementary to his men, rather than equals. They are effervescent. They are complete, they do not need to depend on men to be defined, which is why dialogues like “koney ki kam podiyachhe?” (Is there a dearth of girls) from GGBB seem unsettling. In his essay Conditions of Visibility: People’s Imagination and Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, Mihir Bhattacharya writes: “This exaggerated depopulation…constitutes no mystery, for it is customary to hold that boys have more interesting lives, that the majority of the readers will be boys, and that boys constitute the more precious half of the child population.” Considering all the other aspects of the film, which are as relevant today as they were years ago, the absence of female voice is striking. That the implicit bias of what space is masculine and what avenues are feminine seep into GGBB and the Feluda series is something that Ray is criticised for. The fact that he also made a whole set of films with women at the centre of emancipation does somewhat make up for this poverty of representation.\n\nAnjan Basu writes that the creative mind, at a certain heightened level of arousal, soaks up experiences like a blotter absorbs water, and those same experiences then colour the world of their art. A similar phenomenon may have been at work in Ray’s case as well. From a film that almost got shelved, Satyajit Ray’s Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, which completed 5 decades in May 2019, has transformed into a classic whose message of hope and goodwill continues to enthrall audiences from all walks of life.\n\nOne could go on and on about the film, and its many layers, and the tapestry of allegories, intermingling with trailblazing musical compositions and background scores. But, I am leaving it here for now.\n\nA scene from the film comes to mind in the end. A spy of Halla returns with an update for the prime minister about Shundi’s war-preparedness. “They have nothing, no arms, no line of defence,” says the spy. The minister asks, “Then what do they have?” The spy answers, “Khete phashal aache, gaache phool aache, phol ache, paakhi ache, deshe shanti ache.” (The fields are heavy with crop, the trees laden with flowers and fruits, there are birds and there is peace.)\n\nWith that, I take your leave.\n\nMaharaja, tomare selam.\n\n~SC\n\nFasting, Feasting is a novel by Indian writer Anita Desai, first published in 1999 in Great Britain by Chatto and Windus. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for fiction in 1999 and was declared the runner up.\n\nAnita Desai’s novel of intricate family relations plays out in two countries, India and the United States. The core characters comprise a family living in a small town in India, where provincial customs and attitudes dictate the future of all children: girls are to be married off and boys are to become as educated as much as possible. The story contrasts the life of the unmarried main character, Uma, a spinster, the family’s older daughter, with Arun, the boy and baby of the family. Uma spends her life in subservience to her older demanding parents, while massive effort and energy is expended to ensure Arun’s education and placement in a university in Massachusetts. We can see a contrast between the Indian and the American cultures.\n\nAnita Desai’s main concern was not the socio-cultural aspects of life. She wanted to focus on the psychological complexities. She dealt with the slice of life. She wrote about the psychological oscillation of women. She projected the psyche of women as it were. Writing to her is “a process of discovering truth. The truth that is only 9/10th of the iceberg is submerged. The 1/10th visible portion is what we call reality. Writing to her is plunging into the depth and exploring the underlying truth.”\n\nAll protagonists in Desai’s novels are lonely and isolated even while living in a family. There is an individual struggle as well as a struggle of the soul. Desai’s protagonists are mostly women who are portrayed as powerful, liberated and independent. Women in her novels may be suppressed and silent but their silence is resounding. They protest and question and go against the discrimination and statusquo in the society. Women are marginalized and subjugated but their struggles and protests burst off the patriarchal system. She deals with the snap of relationships. Her novels generally end with the protagonist attaining epiphanic revelation. The revelation is transcendent and cannot be just seen with eyes. There is a spiritual enlightenment led by the struggle, silence, oscillation and protest.\n\nFasting, Feasting starts with the reference to the “Swinging Sofa” which represents the luxurious life of the parents. Uma, the protagonist of the first part, is the most neglected among all the children of the family. Yet not a day in the house can run without Uma being around. The words and phrases are so beautifully placed that n the very first paragraph we get a clear picture of the story which is to follow. The novel presents a sharp contrast in the title itself. There are people like Uma and Melanie who long for parental affection and attention. And on the other hand there are characters like Arun and Rod who get the affection but feel suffocated because of too much attention. Yet no one is contented. Everyone is hungry for more. This keeps them away from the attainment of spiritual growth.\n\nThe novel is an intense narrative. There is switch in time and perspective as and when needed. The author uses the back and forth technique in the novel. There is a shift from the present to the past and then back to the present again. The transitions are not abrupt and flashback is used to create a mesmerizing effect.\n\nThe novel also presents to the reader some of the taboos that were prevalent during Desai’s time in the novel. Women working outside their home were considered as immoral. It can be seen when Dr. Dutt talks to Papa abput employing Uma in her Institute. The very thoughts MamaPapa have about Dr. Dutt also points to this misconception.\n\nAll through the novel, there is a reference to MamaPapa. It could also have been Mama and Papa or Mama, Papa or Mama – Papa. It may have been done deliberately to show that Mama and Papa are inseparable. They are a single entity. They have the same thoughts. They can never contradict each other. It may point to the dependency of women on men. Or that woman is nothing without her male counterpart.\n\nWe can see that the end of both the parts of the end of both the parts of the novel is unexpected. On one hand, Uma is perturbed due to the death of her cousin Anamika and on the other hand Arun is distressed because he has to go back to the dormitory and is going to be allotted a new room. Uma and Arun both are distressed. Uma had a strange bond with Anamika which is broken forever now. Arun has also developed a bond with Mrs. Patton and now he has to take her leave. It is painful for both of them. It is a struggle for both Uma and Arun. This is the path of self realization which both of them need to tread on.\n\n1. IMAGERY AND SYMBOLS\n\nThe use of imagery and symbolism is very much eminent in the novel.\n\nThe Image of Dust and Dirt\n\nThe images of dust and dirt have been used recurrently in the novel. Dust and dirt are references to the limited lifestyle of Uma and her apprehensions. It is a disgusting and repelling image. Dust and dirt signify the dull, dismal, dry, disgruntled and disillusioned lives of Uma and Arun. It also signifies the novelist’s bleak vision of reality. Uma is constantly oscillating and vacillating between her reality and her dreams. Arun also experiences this oscillation in America. It shows the alienation of the characters. Dust creates a symbolism of discontented, disconnected and hazy life of Uma and Arun.\n\nThe Image of Cacophonous Sounds\n\nThere are also references to ‘cacophony’ and ‘cacophonous sounds’ in the novel. Cacophony might have been used to give a deeper insight of the inner souls of the characters. The characters are so perplexed with all sorts of feelings that they can hardly hear what their conscious directs them to do. It also signifies the dull, arid and demented life of Uma in her so called “home” and Arun in the USA.\n\nThe Image of Pilgrimage\n\nPilgrimage may be a symbolism of freedom and elevation. In context of Uma, the reference to pilgrimage maybe considered as a perennial source of independence. “Uma was perfectly happy not to be noticed. She was never more unsupervised or happier in her life.” Thus, pilgrimage is also a source of happiness for her. For the very first time she does not need to follow orders of MamaPapa. It seems as if all the shackles and chains that had bound Uma have been broken abruptly and she is in a world where she can think of herself. Pilgrimage is a path of self exploration and self realization for Uma.\n\nThe Image of Grey\n\nThe colour grey itself is a dull and lifeless colour. It is used as a symbol of the dull, morbid and dismal lives of the characters, particularly Arun and Uma. Arun’s life is confined to his books and studies. This makes his life so bleak that when he goes to America, he can hardly manage to make friends. He even hesitates to talk to people. On the other hand, Uma is bound to the household chores she has to do. She has no time to even look into her bangle collection or her Saris. Grey also symbolizes the snapping relationships, the broken marriages of Uma, the death of Anamika and the colourless and pale life of Mrs. Patton.\n\n2. THEMES OF THE NOVEL\n\nAnita Desai has touched upon various themes in the novel.\n\nSuffering\n\nHuman suffering is portrayed in both parts of the novel. Uma bears the brunt of MamaPapa and even her younger sister Aruna. She is made to do all that she hardly wishes to and is withdrawn from school. She also suffers because of the issues of her marriage. Anamika lives a terrible life and suffers brutal abuse from her mother- in-law. Arun also suffers because he is away from his home at a distant and alien land where he has no one to look up to. Suffering is also evident in Melanie. She suffers because of a severe psychological illness.\n\nLoneliness\n\nLoneliness is a recurring theme in Desai’s novels. Uma is so busy in her life, who has to take care of the household and look after her parents and their needs but she is lonely. There comes a point in the novel where she wants to write a letter to someone, someone who can be trusted, someone who can be told about all the repressed feelings she has, someone who could comfort her, but when she recalls the names there is not a single person who comes to her mind. Arun has always been lonely. Either he is busy studying for his examinations or reading comic strips of Superman and Captain Marvel. When he goes to States, he has adjustments problems. He has a deep dilemma. He misses his family and wants to run away. Melanie is also a lonely and neglected child with hardly any friends.\n\nFamilial Bonds\n\nDesai’s novels have this persistent theme of snapping relationships. According to Desai, even in case of husband and wife, the relationship is superficial. A family is like a car which runs on the wheels which are the family members. If even a single wheel falters, the vehicle will lose its efficiency. Similarly, if even a single family member lacks communication with the others, the family will not be able to sustain itself in this cruel world. In Fasting, Feasting we observe that the kind of bond that a child should have with her/his parents is not present. In the case of both Uma, Aruna and Arun and Rod and Melanie we see that the parental affection is negligibly present if not totally absent. There is also a snap in the relationship of Uma and Aruna when during Aruna’s marriage celebration Uma gets a “fit” and is accused by the to-be-bride as the spoiler of her marriage celebration. However, MamaPapa share a cordial bond all through the narrative. Mr. and Mrs. Patton however have no bond at all between them.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nDiscrimination is a major theme of Fasting, Feasting. Boys and girls have always been thought of being different with boys being superior. In this novel as well, we see when Papa gets the news that his third child is a baby boy the exhilaration with which he shouts it out loud shows that having a boy is what he always wanted. When the boy is named Arun, it is revealed that the name was already decided before Aruna’s birth but sadly had to be changed to Aruna when a girl was born. Uma is withdrawn from school because she has to look after her younger brother who is almost a generation younger to him but Arun, even when he is reluctant to go, is sent to away to America for his higher studies.\n\nThere is also discrimination between the way Aruna and Uma are treated by their parents. Aruna is prettier and knows how to dress herself for every occasion while Uma is shabby and clumsy. Aruna was permitted to go out with her friends but Uma had to stay at home all the time and look after Arun and the household. She was not allowed to go out anywhere. There was also a huge difference in the arrangements of the weddings of Uma and Aruna. Uma’s wedding was a plain and simple but Aruna’s was luxurious and modern wedding which cost Papa a lot but nevertheless he got accolades from everybody who attended the wedding. Uma was a disgrace for their family. She always brought disappointment. She could never succeed in anything she did. Aruna was the pride of the family. She was the one to make them smile after all that had befallen Uma.\n\nTrap and Imprisonment\n\nEvery single person in this novel is trapped in a way or the other. There is a kind of imprisonment in everybody’s life. Somebody is trapped by their family while somebody by their loneliness. We find that Uma is imprisoned in her own house and is not allowed to go out anywhere. Not only literally, she is also mentally trapped. She has an identity crisis and she can take no decision on her own even when she is in her 40’s. Her thoughts are controlled by MamaPapa. She has no refuge, no one to look up to, no friends. Her only escape is when MamaPapa are out for a party. That is the only time she gets for herself. Arun is trapped by his books and studies. He loses his childhood in his father’s frantic efforts to make him do what he could not. He is trapped in the gloom, dreariness and loneliness of his life. He assumes to find a refuge in Mrs. Patton but when he meets her he finds out that she is no less trapped than him. She is a prisoner in her home like Uma. But the only difference is that she has a way to escape. She has the supermarket.\n\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS OF IN CUSTODY AND FASTING, FEASTING\n\nJust like the character of Deven in In Custody attains enlightenment at the end, so does the character of Uma. The character of Uma can also be compared to that of Sarla. Sarla is frustrated and angry. She has broken dreams and aspirations about her marriage. Uma too has broken dreams of studying and getting married. This makes her frustrated. She tries to excel in the little space she has but cannot. Both Sarla and Uma are trying to discover their personal space. Both of the women characters are strong and can bear so much distress without expressing it to anyone. They have no one to share their pains, no friends, no well wishers; they are confined to their homes. Both of them have no way to escape. Mrs. Patton is a similar character to Sarla as well as Uma. Imtiaz Begum can be compared to Melanie who is rebellious. Both of them try to go against the conventional societal norms of patriarchy and try to create a world of their own with only themselves in it."
