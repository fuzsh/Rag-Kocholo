        "text": "Satyajit Ray would have been a hundred years old on May 2.\n\nTo mark the legendary film-maker's birth centenary, Rediff.com brings you a treasure trove of features from our archives.\n\n'I don't need any occasion to think of baba. His memories are my constant companion,' Sandip Ray, Satyajit Ray's only child, told Indrani Roy/Rediff.com on his 93rd birthday.\n\nHe named the following five Ray films as his personal favourites after qualifying his choice by saying he could not 'rank them on the basis of merit; they all are brilliant.'\n\nIndrani sadly passed away in Kolkata last month after a brief illness. We mourn Indrani's loss and her indomitable spirit.\n\nKanchenjunga\n\nCast: Chhabi Biswas, Karuna Bannerjee, Anil Chatterjee, Anubha Gupta, Arun Mukherjee, Alaknanda Roy, Nilima Roy Chowdhuri, Pahadi Sanyal, Subrata Sensharma, Indrani Singh\n\nIn this 1962 film, Satyajit Ray made brilliant use of fog to portray the complexities of human relationships.\n\nWith an ensemble cast, this film had his first original screenplay.\n\nIt was also his first colour film.\n\nThe film is about an upper class Bengali family on vacation in Darjeeling, a popular hill station near Kanchenjunga.\n\nEach character evolves as the film progresses.\n\nThe conclusion is unpredictable, and occurs just as the fog clears and one can see the magnificent Kanchenjunga peak in the distance.\n\nCharulata\n\nCast: Soumitra Chatterjee, Madhabi Mukherjee and Sailen Mukherjee\n\nBased on Rabindranath Tagore's novella Noshtoneer, this 1964 film set in 1870s Kolkata tells the tale of a housewife, Charu.\n\nShe is wealthy yet lonely and is bored of her idle life.\n\nHer husband Bhupati runs a newspaper. He is a workaholic and has very little time to spare for his wife.\n\nHe asks his cousin Amal to keep Charu company.\n\nA complicated love triangle ensues as a result that leads to an unpleasant denouement.\n\nGoopy Gyne Bagha Byne\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Rabi Ghosh, Santosh Dutta, Harindranath Chattopadhyay, Jahor Roy, Santi Chatterjee, Chinmoy Ray\n\nThis 1969 film, based on a short story by Satyajit Ray's grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, has Goopy and Bagha, two yokels, as its protagonists.\n\nGoopy loves to sing but can't hold a tune to save his life, and Bagha plays the drum but has no sense of rhythm.\n\nBoth are banished from their village for oppressing villagers with their atrocious music.\n\nBut they manage to please Bhuter Raja, or the king of ghosts, who grants them three boons -- they only have to clap each other's hands to eat whatever they please, travel wherever they wish and render listeners awe-struck with their music.\n\nEquipped with these wishes, Goopi and Bagha set out on a journey of adventure.\n\nAranyer Din Ratri\n\nCast: Soumitra Chatterjee, Sharmila Tagore, Aparna Sen\n\nBased on a novella by ace writer Sunil Gangopadhyay, this acclaimed 1970 film focuses on a group of friends escaping the bustle of the city by heading to a tribal outpost in Bihar.\n\nThey stumble across women -- of every imaginable kind.\n\nBeneath its sunny veneer, the film has a dark centre and gradually turns into a commentary on the squalor of urban life.\n\nJana Aranya\n\nCast: Pradip Mukherjee, Satya Banerjee, Dipankar Dey, Lily Chakravarti, Gautam Chakravarti, Aparna Sen, Sudesna Das, Utpal Dutt, Rabi Ghosh\n\nThis 1976 film is based on the novel of the same name by Mani Shankar Mukherjee aka Shankar.\n\nIt is the last among the Calcutta trilogy, the previous two being Pratidwandi and Seemabaddha.\n\nThe film portrays the hopelessness of the middle class, educated, urban youth in modern India.\n\nAfter making numerous unsuccessful attempts to find a job, Somnath finally decides to start his own business as a middle-man.\n\nHe gets involved in petty dealings that he finds unsatisfactory.\n\nOne day, in order to land a big order, he has to appease a client by supplying him with a sex worker.\n\nDespite his tremendous hesitation and after trying several brothels, Somnath finds a girl for the purpose.\n\nHowever, she turns out to be his friend Sukumar's younger sister."
