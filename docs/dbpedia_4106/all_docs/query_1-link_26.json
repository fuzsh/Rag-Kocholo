        "text": "Generations. Different generations have those specific cultural markers, those icons that get imbibed into the popular lexicon and the common cultural consciousness of a people, of a place. Such is true of Americans who grew up on Star Wars or BTTF. Such is true of those who grew up inducting the songs of 'The Sound of Music' in their everyday conversations. Such is true of an entire generation of Indians' memories of Sholay and the millionth reference to \"ye haath hamko de dey thakur\". Different Strokes for different folks. But all Bengalis have that one burrow that they grew out of - Satyajit Ray's first dive into commercial film and his biggest box office success - Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. A high-octane bizarre blend of fantasy, musical, adventure, comedy and satire.\n\nIn its essence, Goopy Gyne is an anti-war film dressed as a children's fairytale told in the fashion of Indian folktales.\n\nGoopy and Bagha are two naive, simpletons from different villages. Goopy's only desire in life is to be a great singer. Bagha's is to be a great drummer. But as luck would have it, despite their keen interest in singing and drumming, they were not given the gift of talent and their music is cacophonous at best. After they are banished from their villages following some shrewd manipulation by the privileged elders of the village, they eventually come across each other in the middle of a dense forest teetering at the edge of twilight. It is here, where they stumble upon the King of Ghosts (an unforgettable cameo by Ray himself) who, pleased by their sonorous noise and their humility, grants them three wishes - they could have any food or dress whenever they liked, they could travel anywhere they wanted in a jiffy. And finally, they were given the gift of music, so much so that they would be able to transfix anyone with their songs.\n\nArmed with these three boons, they set out for the kingdom of Shundi, only to learn that the King of Halla has declared war against his own brother, the peace-loving King of Shundi.\n\nHaving consistently cranked out mature dramas and tragedies such as the Apu Trilogy, Jalsaghar, Charulata, Devi and more he was a decidedly 'serious' filmmaker at the time. His 13-year old son finally complained that he could not watch any of his father's films as they were all serious and with sad endings. This, coupled with the approaching 100th birth anniversary of his grandfather - Upendrakishore Roy Chowdhury (the author of the original short story 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' and a key figure in the Bengal cultural renaissance) finally inspired Ray to adapt the story into his next film. Iit was by far his most expensive film at the time and Ray faced some flack for dabbling in, what many considered, a less serious film and taking the commercial route. It would eventually take the box office success of the film (it played in theatres for 7 months straight) to breakdown those pre-conceived judgements.\n\nAs Ray himself remarked later:\n\n\"One, allegedly discerning, critic remarked apropos of my previous film, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, that it gave a clear indication of the director’s striving to pander to the box office. And this was about a film that broke completely fresh ground, was based on a comparatively unknown story by an author who was certainly not Sarat Chandra Chatterjee in popularity, used no stars, cast a completely unknown artiste and another comparatively unknown in two leading roles, used songs entirely legitimately perhaps for the first time, inserted a near-abstract dance sequence, seven minutes long to the music of abstract and unfamiliar south Indian percussion and, finally, provided no romance, no sentimentality and only two women who appear for barely five minutes in the very last scene of the film. How discerning can you get?’\n\nIndeed, it's the technical heights that this film achieved that still astound with their ingenuity. Ray never had a limitless budget. The Bengali film industry was several levels down, in terms of finance, compared to its lavish Bollywood counterpart. Furthermore, this was the pre-computer era. The film, being a fantasy, had to have a lot of special effects for which Ray simply did not have half the budget. Limits always bring the best creativity out of artists. And thus Ray simply DIY'd it, relying purely on make-shift practical effects and trick photography. The effects, even today, look realistic and certainly so in comparison to similar fantasy films from its era. The film spectacularly teleports people to a desert in a moment and then to the Himalayas the next moment. A long row of camels sitting quietly, suddenly rise up in unison, as if bewitched. There are countless goblets of sweets that rain down from the skies. There's an eccentric wizard who makes the courtiers of Halla skip around him like mechanical toys, and then brings them to an abrupt halt with a swish of his cane. He can also conjure chairs out of thin air at the precise moment that he wants to sit down. And then there is the most-talked about sequence of the movie - the dance of the Ghosts. It's visual splendour and technical prowess is so modern and beautiful that one only needs to see to believe. It is a 7-minute long sequence that is, almost entirely, abstract. Ray uses shadow photography, stock-puppetry, film negatives, reflective reactions and lenses dipped in oils to conceive a tantalising, show-stopping, never-before-seen musical number populated by different categories of ghosts set to the tune of conventional and unconventional South-Indian classical music. More on the scene later, but it is nigh impossible to do it justice by merely writing about it.\n\nEqually unforgettable is the casting. I can imagine recasting any other Satyajit Ray film, but all of the major roles here - Tapan Chatterjee, Rabi Ghosh, Jahar Roy, Santosh Dutta, Harindranath Bannerjee - are irreplaceable.\n\nAny review of this is of course incomplete without mentioning its music. Ray's love for music and especially classical music is no secret, it is reflected in every film of his. In fact, he himself scored a large number of his films. But I believe that he never before or again used music as effectively to portray the soul, the sense of a story as he did in this. The music of GGBB is joyous, alluringly life-affirming, elated. Bearing a sense of hope and peace. Even in its most sombre, quiet songs, it quietly holds onto that brightness. It's absolutely beautiful.\n\n.\n\nAs much love as I have for it, I must also say that I am unsure of how non-Bengalis would react to this film. It is probably Ray's most firmly \"Bengali\" film. Even moreso than the Apu Trilogy or the Calcutta Trilogy.\n\nGGBB, at its core, is a comedy. And being a comedy the audience's enjoyment with the dialogue, the script rests a lot on witty phrases, idioms, puns, colloquialisms and slangs, all of which are lost in even the best of translated subtitles. Therefore I'm unsure how many non-Bengalis would actually be as charmed by the film, as I was. The relative obscurity and lack of access to the film further dampens any attempt at trying to certify this. Regardless of that, I do believe that the film is an essential part of Ray's filmography and an enjoyable experience for everyone.\n\nDespite clearly being a film made for kids, Ray understands that the best films for children are the ones that adults can enjoy and love too. It might be Ray's first foray into the genre, but he works like a wizard of style, technique and emotions. Much in the same wavelength as Miyazaki, he infuses his story with irony and a subtextual commentary on the endless cycles of war and suffering that humanity is plagued with its search for contentment. He finds it in the royal figures of this film, a sad brotherly rivalry that is schemed and puppeteered entirely by external forces. He finds it in the hundreds of malnourished, underfed soldiers working for a Chieftain and a Prime Minister whose belts cannot hold back their squelching bellies from falling out. He finds it in the silent anguish of a wizard who has lost his speech, resorting to angry gestures of protests towards insults uncalled for. He finds it in a flautist who cheerfully shares his fruits to strangers out of simple, good faith. He finds this in a scene where a spy, who has just returned from Shundi, reports to the scheming Prime Minister of Halla about the war preparations of Shundi. The Prime Minister is elated to hear that the people of Shundi are simple, peace-loving folk. They have no armies. No weapons. No cannons. No horses. No elephants. No camels. \"What do they have then?\" The Prime Minister cheerfully mocks. And the spy replies with a dreamy voice: \"They have fruits.. and... flowers...and little birds chirping in the trees. Crops in the fields. Peace....happiness... there's laughter in the streets...\"\n\nThis sentiment is consistently echoed in the major theme of the film - man's obsession with ego and power and attaining peace through simplicity and humility instead. Goopy and Bagha are the epitome of this. This is repeatedly underlined everytime their free-style folksongs are juxtaposed with the preening, aggressively elitist attitudes of the classical musicians surrounding them.\n\nOn meeting the King of Ghosts, for instance, Goopy and Bagha could have asked for anything in the world. Kingdoms, princesses, fiefdoms, armies. Revenge against those who drove them away. All the wealth in the world. But they merely ask for what they need to fulfill their basic needs and the singular desire to perfect their passion for music. It is only later that they are upset why they did not ask for something more ambitious but it is clearly an indication of what the world had shaped them to believe was important in life. Their subconscious instinct - when granted the wishes - was simplicity.\n\nThis dichotomy is once again perfectly explored in Santosh Dutt's double role as the King of Halla. In his pure state he is a man-child. Wide-eyed, innocent, benign and happy. It is the Minister's corruption that turns him into a vicious, unrestrained stackato war-mongrel. Deep inside, humans are capable of beauty and wonder and love. Ray seems to say. But one who gets addicted to the drug of power and ambition, loses himself completely to become something more nefarious.\n\nNear the end of the film, Goopy and Bagha save the day by calling to the King's true nature. Imprisoned, they feel powerless and await death. But how does one cage something as infinite as music? Goopy sings a soulful song, voice flying sky-high like a free bird, reaching the ears of the drug-addled King and he has only one thing to say — ‘If only once he would come down from his throne and enjoy the breeze in the fields, he would find his peace, he would find his peace, he would find his peace...’\n\nThis brings us back to the previously mentioned 'dance of the ghosts'. Besides being a powerhouse in technical and visuo-sensory achievement, the scene is evidence of how Ray deftly imbibed complex themes in a children's fable. The sequence satirizes and comments on the Indian caste-system - the root of most problems that plague Indian society today. According to the system, society was divided into a hierarchy according to the professions people worked in. Four classes - Brahmins (the well-learned priests and intellectuals) at the top, Kshatriyas (warrior class), vaishyas (working class, traders, merchants) and the shudras (untouchables, cleaners, scavengers) at the bottom. People were born into these castes and no one could cross them, across the generations. If caste was inescapable in life, it must be inescapable in death too. Ray thought. And this leads to the film, where Ray divides his ghosts into four distinct classes, all be it, With a slight difference. Further insight is gained into this from Ray's own little sketchbook where he left descriptions and sketches of each category of the ghosts. First we meet the ones that are represented by white shadowy figures. These wear turbans, have fearsome expressions and wield scimitars, swords, spears and shields. They are the warrior class. The ghosts in black that follow are lean figures, wearing shaded hats and brandishing pitchforks, hoes and spades. The working class. Then follow the rickety gait of the British-sahebs with hookahs, canes and drinks in their hands - a diversion from the traditional cast system categories but accurately representative of India at the time. And finally arrive the plump, squiggly figures of the Brahmin class. We find a priest reading and preaching, we find another one to be a teacher, and yet another one presenting himself as a 'babumoshai'.\n\nAfter the introductions to each of these, the rest of the sequence alternates between them with harmonic South Indian music (that I'm too uncultured to differentiate) playing in hyperkinetic rhythmic unison with the dance of the ghosts. Eventually we see each of the classes break into in-fighting. Warriors against warriors. Workers against workers. British against British and the Brahmins against Brahmins. A critique of capitalism and the social hierarchy as none of the classes are actually concerned with tearing down these castes, only each other. This is also a parallel to the central plot of the film itself where royals fight against royals, and the poor fight amidst themselves for a piece of the proverbial pie. The sequence ends with all the ghosts \"dying\" after the fight. But in a clever trick, right in the next frame, we see these classes *again*. Stacked one atop the other. The classes have reformed and the cycle continues.\n\nWhere are the shudras then, the untouchables? They're the lowest in the hierarchy and suffer the worst in the system. Surely Ray could not have forgotten them? They're a downtrodden people. Social outcasts. Left to live on the fringes of society. Denied the chance to coexist. The shudras here are, in a way, Goopy and Bagha themselves. Our protagonists. They are from the lowest strata of their villages, mocked by everyone, and are punished for crossing the class barriers by playing classical instruments/songs (a vocation reserved only for the \"highest\" caste) Granted, the film never comes close to depicting the full extent of the atrocities and trauma experienced by them daily. However it does an exceptional job in relaying the idea of it - the idea of \"other\"ing people and dehumanising them - to young minds. It is this, along with their honesty which encourages the King of the ghosts to grant them their three wishes. Being a spirit of the otherworld, he blessed them - the supposedly lowest of people - to change the world. And these pawns ended up making all the difference in an elaborate set-piece of Kings, wizards, princesses and ministers.\n\nGoopy and Bagha would go on to return in two more subsequent films, each of them great in their own right. But never as purely cinematically as in this. It is an absolute shame that the film doesn't seem to have any good quality print in circulation or access, further hampering it's reach to the masses - for whom it was really intended for. Though it gives me some satisfaction that it is preserved in the Academic Archive. 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' is a film brimming with wonder, music, laughter, joy, wackiness, antics, adventure, thrill. With life. It won't be the most accessible film for everyone, culturally. But one can never claim to be familiar with what Satyajit Ray is all about if one has not seen 'Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne'.\n\n✨\n\nWritten on the occasion of the master's 100th birth anniversary.\n\nJeetey raho, Manik-da!"
