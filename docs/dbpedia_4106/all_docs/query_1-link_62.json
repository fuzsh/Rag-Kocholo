        "text": "Solution\n\nVerified by Toppr\n\nThe Pain behind Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne For his new film `Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne' Satyajit Ray needed to shoot a scene with a tiger. So he approached Bharat Circus Company. The manager was a Tamilian and he agreed to provide Satyajit Ray a tiger. Ray spoke to the ringmaster Mr.Thorat. He showed Ray the tiger. The shooting was in a suitable bamboo grove in Notun gram. A lorry with two fed tigers arrived. The crew placed the tripod facing the bamboo grove and the actors were arranged in such a way that they could be shown along with the tiger. A five-foot iron rod was fixed to the ground and a long wire at one end of the collar of the tiger was tied to it. When the door opened the tiger sprang out of its cage.\n\nInstead of walking calmly it started prancing around with tremendous enthusiasm as if in a circus. After sometime when the tiger became calm, the remaining shots were taken. Later it was found that the shots didn't come alright because the camera had failed to work properly. The scenes had to be shot again. Another bamboo grove in a village called Boral was found and a lorry with a tiger arrived there. A lot of people came to watch the shooting and the crowd was not ready to move from their position. When the door of the cage was opened the tiger emerged with a loud roar and charged straight at the villagers. All disappeared from the scene. The shots were taken again when the tiger became normal."
