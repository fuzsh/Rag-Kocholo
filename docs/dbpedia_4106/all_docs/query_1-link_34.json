        "text": "The Goopy Bagha Trilogy - Satyajit Ray\n\n1 Conversation\n\nGupi Gyne O Bagha Byne (Gupi Gyne and Bagha Byne), a Bengali short story written for children by Upendrakishore Raychoudhury, was published in Sandesh, the children's magazine, in the early 1910s. It is the story of two friends, Gupi Gyne, the singer and Bagha Byne, the dholak player, and their humerous exploits.\n\nIn later years, the writer's grand-son, Satyajit Ray, the internationally famed Oscar winning director from Kolkata , India, took the characters' fame to new heights, by not only filming the story, but also adding two more stories and films of them, to make it a trilogy.\n\nThe Original Short-story - a Synopsis\n\nGupi Kyne, the son of the grocer Kanu Kyne knows only one song which he always sings, although he has no musical abilities. His singing is horrible enough to chase away his father's customers, and even the cows from grazing. One day, a frustrated Kanu chases him with a large bamboo in his hand. Scared of his father and of the village cowherds, Gupi runs away to the forest and is happy practising singing there.\n\nIn the neighbouring village, Panchu Pyne's son is very fond of playing the dholak. He makes strange faces while playing the dholak, and subsequently roars out like a bagh or tiger. This makes him known as Bagha Byne or Bagha the music player. Now, the villagers get so tired of his loud beatings of the dholak that they bribe him with ten urns of sweets and ask him to leave the village. Bagha moves from village to village with the same fate until he reaches the same forest where Gupi is and meets him. Gupi calls himself Gupi Gyne now, or Gupi, the singer.\n\nThe duo decide to go to the nearby King to present their music. On the way they have to cross a river. Since they do not have any money to pay the fare to the boatman, the latter asks them to sing and play the dholak for him. The duo agrees. However, as soon as Gupi starts singing and Bagha playing the dholak, a panic is created among the passengers, and the boat topples. The duo manage to swim to the bank clinging on to the dholak. They enter the dense forest at the banks of the river. The duo is sure that they'd ultimately form the food for the tigers, and decide to sing and play music one last time. A band of ghosts, dwelling in the forest appear to listen to their music, and they are so impressed that they take the duo to their abode to sing at their chief's son's wedding. At the end the ghosts are very pleased and confers three boons on them.\n\nThat they would be able to sing and play the dholak efficiently, and all listeners would freeze as long as the music goes on.\n\nThat they could get any clothing and also, would be able to get any food, and the garments and the delicacies would appear in a bag the ghosts gifted them.\n\nThat they would be able to reach any place in a moment with the aid of a pair of enchanted shoes for each.\n\nEndowed with magical powers, Gupi and Bagha reach the King's palace. The guards stop them, instead they reach the King's bedroom with help of their magic shoes. The King is shocked, seeing the duo appear out of nowhere. They are chased by the guards, and the duo panic. They are easily captured, and are thrown into the prison.\n\nBagha is very upset as he has lost his dholak in the commotion. Gupi tries to cheer him up, and the duo then enjoy pulao and other mouth-watering delicacies from the magic bag, and escape after two days, on the day they were to be tried.\n\nClad in royal robes, they again reach the palace. The King and his retinue do not recognise the duo, and welcome them as honoured guests.\n\nIn the meantime, the daroga comes with the news of the disappearance of the duo from the prison. The King and his retinue are sure they must have been ghosts, else they could not have disappeared despite rigid security arrangements. They decide to put Bagha's dholak on fire. Hearing this Bagha starts wailing and crying loudly. People think he is badly ill, and the royal physician treats him with painful medicines. However, this delays the burning of the dholak.\n\nThe daroga however, recognises the duo, and informs the King. The King is scared to know about it, as he still believes the duo are actually ghosts. They plan to call for an exorcist, but are too scared to confront the ghosts, and so they plan to burn them to death while they are sleeping. A beautiful out-house is constructed in the King's garden, and the duo are asked to stay there. The guards also keep Bagha's dholak in the out-house.\n\nReaching the out-house, Bagha is ecstatic to find his dholak there. At night, Gupi and Bagha decide to roam in the garden singing and playing the drum. In the meantime the daroga gets inside with his guards and sets the cottage on fire. Just at this moment, Goopy and Bagha start singing and playing the dholak. The Daroga and his guards freeze inside the burning cottage, and are burned alive.\n\nThe duo now decide to visit their villages. They reach the forest where they had first met. Being glad and nostalgic, they start singing and playing the dholak. In the meantime, a gang of bandits were escaping after looting the treasury of Halla, and also with the two princes of Halla kidnapped with them. The bandits freeze as a result of Gupi and Bagha's music. The King of Halla's guards capture them. The King is grateful, and offers them to be the royal musicians at his court. The duo ask for a few days' time in order to visit their villages and their parents.\n\nA repentant Kanu Kyne is glad to see his son back. However, Bagha do not have the same fate. His parents have passed away a few days back, and when his fellow-villagers see him coming with the dholak, they beat him up and chase him out. Bagha reaches Gupi's place and his parents welcome him with immense hospitality.\n\nAfter a few days, the duo leave for Halla. They are appointed the court musicians. One day, the King of Halla receives a news from the King of Shundi, the latter declaring a war on him. Now, the King of Shundi is the same King who had tried to burn the duo to death. When they come to know about it, they decide to try and stop the war.\n\nThe duo reach Shundi. The King's courtiers and subjects were busy with rituals in front of a temple. The duo, dressed in royal attire, perch at the top of the temple's tomb, and drop urns of never seen before sweets, which they have acquired by their magic power. The people are unable to see Gupi and Bagha clearly because of the smoke from the incense sticks and the sacred fire. In the pandemonium caused by the bells and kansar -bells ringing and the conch shells blowing, the people mistake them to be gods throwing down sacred sweets from the sky, and rush to grab them. The next evening, even the King of Shundi reaches the temple to have his share. The duo appears infront of him, the King mistakes them to be gods, and when they want to embrace him, the latter feels obliged and elated. Gupi and Bagha takes hold of him and reaches Halla.\n\nThe King of Halla is overjoyed, he forgives the King of Shundi, though takes away his kingdom. The story ends with the duo getting married to the princesses of Halla, and the King of Halla making them the Kings of half of Shundi.\n\nThe Trilogy\n\nSatyajit Ray's Goopy-Bagha trilogy of films deal with the adventures of the friends, Gopinath Gyne (Goopy), the singer and Baghanath Byne (Bagha), the dhol player. Goopy is played by Tapen Chatterjee and Bagha is played by the popular comedian Robi Ghosh. Although the films were basically made keeping the young viewers in mind, they appeal to the young and old alike, and have proved to be equally entertaining till date. The films are strewn with elements of comedy and hilarious scenes. This series of musical comedies is interspersed with wonderful songs, written and composed by Ray himself, and are sung by Anup Ghosal . The trilogy comprises of the movies:\n\nGoopy Gyne O Bagha Byne (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha)\n\nHirak Rajar Deshe (The Kingdom of Diamonds)\n\nGoopy Bagha Phire Elo (The Return of Goopy and Bagha)\n\nGoopy Gyne O Bagha Byne\n\nStory: Upendra Kishore Raychoudhury.\n\nScreen-play, Lyrics, Music, Costume and Direction: Satyajit Ray\n\nCamera: Soumendu Roy\n\nArt Director: Banshi Chandragupta\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Robi Ghosh, Santosh Dutta (King of Shundi and King of Halla), Jahar Ray (Minister of Halla), Harindranath Chatterjee (Borfi, the Magician).\n\nProducers: Nepal Dutt and Asim Dutt (Poornima Pictures)\n\nSynopsis of the Story\n\nSatyajit Ray made the first of the trilogy films based on his grandfather Upendrakishore Raychoudhury's story \"Goopy Gyne O Bagha Byne\". The only black and white film of the trilogy was released in 1968. Although the film deviates a lot from the original story, still the basic story line remains the same.\n\nGopinath Kyne, son of the grocer Kanu Kyne, lives in the village Amloki. He loves singing, but has no musical ability. The elderly villagers talk him into going to the King's court to sing for the King, under the name Gopinath Gyne. The King is horrified at his horrible music, and banishes him from the kingdom. While loitering in the bamboo forest , Gopinath meets the drummer Baganath Byne from the village Horttuki, who has the same fate. At night, the duo meet the King of the Ghosts, who confers three boons on them.\n\nThat they could get to wear any clothing by clapping each other's hands, and uttering the name of the dress type; and also, would be able to get any food by clapping each other's hands, and uttering the name of the dish.\n\nThat they would be able to reach any place in a moment with the aid of a pair of enchanted shoes for each, by clapping each other's hands, and uttering the name of the place.\n\nThat they would be able to sing and play the drum efficiently, and all listeners would freeze as long as the music goes on.\n\nEarly next morning, Goopy tests his singing skills, and to his utmost glee, he discovers he has developed a melodious voice. He's also joined by Bagha on his drum, who is now adept in playing the dhol. After that, they also make various delicacies appear by their magical power, and have a sumptuous meal.\n\nThe duo then come to know about a music competition to be held in the court of the King of Shundi, and decide to contend the same. After visiting Hundi and then Jhundi by mistake, the trio finally visits Shundi by their magical powers, take part in the contest, and emerge the winners. They are appointed as the royal musicians.\n\nThe subjects of Shundi are all speaking impaired. They are victims to an epidemic. The royal family escaped the calamity as they had been for a pilgrimage during the mishap.\n\nIn the meantime, the Minister of Halla is planning out an attack on Shundi. With the aid of Borfi, the magician, he treats the King of Halla with magic potions to convert the humble, meek, amicable King to a violent and aggressive one who loves to declare war on neighbouring kingdoms. The King of Shundi is also humble, meek and amicable, and Shundi is even void of any defense system. The minister of Halla is actually up to a sinister plan to usurp the throne once he manages to conquer Shundi. The King of Halla, under the effect of the magic potion, sends a letter to the King of Shundi declaring war. The latter is horrified. He's also upset, that the King of Halla, who's actually his own brother, has declared war on him. Goopy and Bagha decide to travel to Halla to try and stop the war. The King of Shundi promises to marry his daughter, Princess Monimala, to one of them, if they succeed.\n\nThe duo reach Halla by their magical power, and in the disguise of farmers, visit the king's palace. The King orders the farmers who had defaulted on taxes, to be beheaded, and Goopy has to sing in order to freeze the people around to escape. Goopy's singing, which was endowed with magical power, overpowers the effect of Borfi's magic potion, bringing the King of Halla back to his own self.\n\nThe duo smell a rat. They visit the minister's room while he's conspiring with Borfi, come to know about the minister's sinister plans, and petrifying them with their enchanted music, leaves with the new powerful magic potion Borfi had concocted to bring back the speaking capabilities of the citizens of Shundi.\n\nBorfi has also prepared a more powerful potion this time to convert the King's attitude. The King is again thirsty for blood, eager to go for a war with Shundi.\n\nTables turn. Halla's guards captivate Goopy and Bagha while they're asleep, and throw them into the prison. Imprisoned, with their enchanted shoes lying away from them on the field, the duo are frustrated. Goopy sings a song. Once again his music overpowers Borfi's magic and the King is out of its influence. An infuriated minister visits the gaol and threatens the duo never to sing again without his permission.\n\nWhen the minister tries to treat the King with Borfi's magic potion once again, the King at last relents. He refuses to take the potion. He recollects that he was kidnapped as a child by a bandit, and was brought to Halla. He also recalls that Shundi belongs to his brother.\n\nThe wily magician now puts a spell on the King to keep him unconscious for three days. Now, with further help from Borfi, Halla's vast, laid back and indisciplined army is also rejuvenated and brought to discipline. Borfi's days end here, and he disappears into thin air.\n\nIn the mean time, Goopy and Bagha lure the starved cell guard with a meal adorned with a variety of delicacies, and escape. They rush to the spot from where they were captured, and to their utter delight find their magic shoes and Bagha's drum lying intact.\n\nAs the army sets off for Shundi, Goopy and Bagha appears with Goopy singing out loud and Bagha playing his dhol. The army stands still including the camels. Goopy points out the dogs of war in his song, and urges the army to refrain from fighting. At the end of the song, the duo use their magic to make innumerable urns of sweets come down from the sky, and the starved army forgets everything to run after the delicacies. The King too is freed of Borfi's magic, and runs out of the palace. In the commotion, which makes the war impossible, the duo take hold of the King, and reach the King of Shundi. The two kings recognise each other as brothers, and the film ends with the happy note of the citizens of Shundi getting back their voices, and Goopy and Bagha getting married to Princess Monimala of Shundi and Princess Muktaamala of Halla respectively.\n\nAwards\n\nAward for Best Direction, New Delhi, 1968\n\nPresident's Gold and Silver Medals, New Delhi, 1970\n\nSilver Cross, Adelaide, 1969\n\nBest Director, Auckland, 1969\n\nMerit Award, Tokyo, 1970\n\nBest Film, Melbourne, 1970\n\nHirak Rajar Deshe\n\nStory, Screen-play, Costume design, Lyrics, Music and Direction: Satyajit Ray\n\nCamera: Soumendu Roy\n\nArt Director: Ashok Bose\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Robi Ghosh,\n\nSoumitra Chatterjee (Udayan, the Teacher at Hirak),\n\nUtpal Dutt (King of Hirak),\n\nSantosh Dutta (King of Shundi and Gobuchandra, the Scientist at Hirak)\n\nProducer: Department of Information and Culture, Govt. of West Bengal\n\nSynopsis of the Story\n\nHirak Rajar Deshe was released in 1980. Although a children's film at the first view, the film deals with serious political issues.\n\nQuite a few years have passed since Goopy and Bagha's adventures in Halla. They are now fathers to one baby each. However, the two adventurous souls are bored sitting constrained in the palace. Just when they decide to go out for a vacation, the King of Shundi asks them to represent him in Hirak in their anniversary celebration. The duo are overjoyed.\n\nThe King of Hirak is a tyrannical dictator. Just like Halla's minister had Borfi, The King of Hirak has a scientist, Gobuchandra, working for him. The latter has invented a brain-washing machine. It 'washes' rebels' brains of any thoughts of sedition, and implants verses in praise of the king. The kingdom thrives on a huge diamond mine, in which miners are exploited to dig out diamonds. The king also pulls down the village school, as education imparts knowledge, a sense of ethics and power of reasoning. When the kings guards put fire to Udayan's books and scriptures, Udayan, the sole teacher of the school, rebels. He manages to save a few of his books, and escapes into the nearby caves and forests. The King orders his council of ministers and guards to get hold of Udayan. The King also wants to shut the mouths of those who are critical. Charandas, a bard, comes to his court and sings a song where he speaks of farmers who grow golden crops but go without a square meal twice a day, diamond miners go without any wealth, the good resides in broken huts and the bad ascends the throne. The King is infuriated, and ties him up and throws him in a ditch. The King also wants to ensure his kingdom looks clean and beautiful, and reflects prosperity in the eyes of outsiders during the celebration. So he captures all beggars and urchins and keeps them in a fenced, guarded field, out of sight of the visitors.\n\nIn the meantime, Goopy and Bagha reach Hirak after travelling to many other places too. They come accross Udayan, and come to know from him about the real King of Hirak. Udayan is thirilled by the magical powers of the duo, and seeks their aid in his revolt against the King. The duo too decide to join hands with Udayan, and teach a lesson to the tyrannical King. Udayan, the mastermind, advises Goopy and Bagha how to carry on with the next steps.\n\nAccordingly, the duo reach the King's court, and pretend to be pleased with the King. They even sing a song in praise of the monarch. The King also unveils a statue of his own at the field. On their request the King also takes them for a visit to the diamond mine. They meet Udayan there who is in disguise of a miner. Udayan manages to hand over a letter to Bagha, asking the duo to meet him that night.\n\nThe duo meet Udayan that night at the field, and as per their plan, go to the King's treasury to loot his diamonds. On their way, they also rescue Charandas. Goopy mesmerises the treasury guard by his song, and Bagha ties him up, takes the key, and they enter the treasury. To their utter surprise, Goopy and Bagha find a tiger guarding the chest of diamonds. The duo is petrified. Once again, Goopy starts singing, and the tiger becomes immobile as long as the song goes. Bagha makes use of this opportunity to loot the treasury.\n\nThey now reach the scientist's laboratory where the brain-washing machine is kept, and buy him in with a few of the diamonds.\n\nIn the meantime, Udayan is captured by the King's guards, and along with his students is brought to the scientist's laboratory for brain-washing. They are forced into the machine, and to the King's dismay, it does not work. Udayan, along with his loyal students, come out, and Goopy starts singing, accusing the King of all his misdeeds, and revealing his actual nature. Bagha, in the meantime, buys in the guards with the diamonds. Udayan now puts in the King, along with his council of ministers, inside the machine, and has their brains washed!\n\nAll gather at the field, and the film ends with the citizens - who are later joined by the King and his ministers too, now with their brains 'washed' for good - pulling down the King's statue, shattering it into pieces.\n\nAwards\n\nBest Music, Director, New Delhi, 1980\n\nBest Lyrics, New Delhi, 1980\n\nSpecial Award, Cyprus, 1984\n\nGoopy Bagha Phire Elo\n\nStory, Lyrics and Music: Satyajit Ray\n\nScreenplay and Direction: Sandip Ray\n\nCamera: Barun Raha\n\nArt Director: Ashok Bose\n\nCast: Tapen Chatterjee, Robi Ghosh, Ajit Bannerjee (Brahmananda Acharya, the Spiritualist), Haradhan Bannerjee (King of Anandapur)\n\nProducer: Department of Information and Culture, Govt. of West Bengal\n\nSynopsis of the Story\n\nGoopy Bagha Phire Elo released in 1992, directed by Sandip Ray, Satyajit Ray's son, was the last of the trilogy. The title-song tells us that the Kings of Shundi and Halla have become 88 years old, and have retired to the forest, leaving their thrones to Goopy and Bagha. However, the two wonderlusts have become frustrated, and decide to go out for travelling once again, leaving administration responsibilities with their ministers. Goopy and Bagha have been invited by the King of Anandapur to watch a contest of magicians.\n\nThe story starts with the final conversation Brahmananda is having with his preceptor before the former leaves. Although the latter is a genuine spiritualist, Brahmananda is dishonest, and makes unfair use of his spiritual powers he has acquired from his preceptor. The preceptor reprimands his disciple for the same, and tells him that because he is yet to win over his lust for wealth, yet to dispose of the wealth he had acquired when he was a bandit in the past, has not yet got the punishments he deserves for the crimes he committed as a bandit, he'd not be able to attain immortality; and Bikram, a twelve years old boy in Anandapur, a prosperous town on the banks of the Gahana river, will be the cause of his death.\n\nGoopy and Bagha attend the court of Anandapur to watch the contest of magicians. Goopy and Bagha being Kings, do not contend, but at the end they also show a few of their tricks, by their magical powers, followed by a song. The only person at the court who did not freeze was Brahmananda , who too is now at Anandapur residing at the Anandagarh fort, along with his guards Domboru and Dunduvi and servant Chumbak, and has described himself as an Acharya . He goes on tapping his index finger to the tune of the music.\n\nAwestruck by their magical powers, Brahmananda Acharya invites the duo to the fort to know about them in detail. When they visit him, they are dumb-struck to know that their magic had no effect on the Acharya. After knowing about the duo's source of magical power, the Acharya shows them his collection of gems. He now tries to lure them to get him the three most precious gems from the royal turbans of the Kings of Shankhapur, Kanchanpur and Bishalnagar. When they refuse to be his accomplice in his heinous plans, the wily Acharya offers to reduce their age by twenty years each. The Acharya also aussures the duo that nobody will recognise them as he'll help them put on a disguise. The duo ask for time to decide, and leave for their host's palace.\n\nIn the meantime, the Acharya asks Chumbak, his servant to invite all twelve year old boys in Anandapur, called Bikram, to the fort. When they come, he hypnotises them all by his spiritual power, and makes them serve him.\n\nGoopy and Bagha are in a dilemma. They do not want to help the Acharya in his heinous plans, at the same time, they are not able to ignore the idea of becoming younger by twenty years. They are also thrilled by the idea of going for the theft in disguise. At the same time, Bagha also suspects that the Acharya will hypnotise them before they are sent for the jewels to ensure they do not run away with them. Goopy doubts if they can be hypnotised, as they are blessed with the boons from the King of the Ghosts; but they are still apprehensive. They decide to confirm from the King of the Ghosts. They visit the bamboo forest in Notungaon once again, where they had first met twenty years back. The King of Ghosts is delighted to see the duo back, and assures them that they can be hypnotised only if they want to, and can never be hypnotised against their will. The King also cautions them against many temptations all around the world, and they should not give in to them.\n\nIn the meantime, the parents of all the Bikrams in Anandapur are worried about their sons whereabouts. Their fathers, led by Pradeep, a teacher, go to the King, and the King seeks the help of Goopy and Bagha. The duo assures the villagers, urging them not to worry, and that they will resolve the situation as soon as possible.\n\nGoopy and Bagha decide to abide by the King of Ghosts, and turn down the Acharya's proposal. They visit the fortress, and to their dismay, find the children, clad in black robes, serving the Acharya in a state of trance. The duo decide not to spare the vile Acharya, and plan to find a way out. They meet a child, Kanu with his pet lamb at the banks of the Gahana river, on whose request Goopy sings a song, and the viewers are amazed to see that Goopy's song is unable to freeze Kanu, who unnoticed by the duo, goes on tapping his index-finger to the tune of the song. Kanu is an orphan brought up by his grandfather.\n\nThe duo decide to give in to the Acharya's temptations, in order to find out why the latter has imprisoned the children.\n\nWhen Pradeep visits Kanu's grandfather, Kanu says the fortress is being dwelt by a demon who has imprisoned the childen. A shocked Pradeep visit Goopy and Bagha, and the duo confirms that the children are imprisoned in the fortress. Pradeep urges them to escort him to the fort at night. However, he is shocked when his son is unable to recognise him.\n\nThe King too sends his guards to the fort the next day to rescue the children and to captivate the Acharya. The Acharya brings all the children in front of the parents, and none of the Bikrams could recognise their fathers. When the King's guards try to arrest the Acharya, the latter increases his weight by a thousands times by his spiritual powers, and the guards are not even able to remove him from his place! The Acharya tells them that he'll release the boys once they turn 12 years and 2 months of age.\n\nAs suspected, the Acharya 'hypnotises' them. However they do not get hypnotised, just pretend to be so. They go to Shankhopur in disguise, and while the King and his courtiers were enjoying the tricks of acrobats and jugglers, they freeze everybody with their music and run away with the jewel on the Kings royal turban. Pleased with possessing the jewel, the Acharya gifts them with a small jewel each and discloses to the duo why he has kept the children imprisoned in the fortress, mistaking that the duo are in a trance.\n\nWhile the Acharya was under the notion that the duo are taking rest in their room in the Anandagarh fortress, they visit the King of Anandapur, assuring him that they are planning on a way out, and will take a few days' time before they can rescue the children.\n\nThe next day, the duo go to Kanchanpur. The King of Kanchanpur was travelling at that time, and the duo freeze his camel caravan with their music. For security purposes, the King had placed his jewelled crown on his pet leopard's head. Although the duo feel jittery, they freeze the leopard too by their music, and take the jewel off the crown.\n\nWhen Goopy and Bagha return to Brahmananda Acharya with the jewel, he's overjoyed. However, he's by now come to know that they are not under his spell, as Chumbak had been to their room when they went to visit the King of Anandapur. An angry Acharya takes away their magic shoes, and keeps them locked inside their room. He tells the duo that until they get the jewel from Bishalnagar, they'd not be released and also warns them that if they dare to run away with it, his spritual power will destroy them.\n\nThe duo however buy in Chumbak with one of the jewels the Acharya had gifted them, when the latter comes to serve them with juices. They escape from the fort, however, the drinks were drugged, and they sleep off under a tree. The King of Ghosts appear to them in their dreams, and reprimands them for deviating from the path of honesty. Goopy and Bagha ask for forgiveness, and the generous King does so after Goopy asks for forgiveness through a wonderful a song.\n\nThe duo now go back to the fortress, and while the Acharya is sleeping, they get hold of their shoes and also the jewels from Shankhapur and Kanchanpur. They go to Pradeep to know if there is any other 12 year old children named Bikram in Anandapur. Pradeep answers in the negative. The duo is upset, as only a twelve year old Bikram from Anandapur can cause the end to Brahmananda. In the meantime, Kanu's grandfather arrives frantically searching for Kanu. He tells Pradeep and the duo that Kanu has been talking about a demon in the fortress, and that he was planning to put an end to it. He also tells that Kanu was actually named Bikram after he was born, and that he has turned 12 years of age just the day before. Goopy and Bagha along with Pradeep set off for Anandagarh Fort immediately.\n\nIn the meantime the Acharya has found out that the duo's shoes are missing. He checks for the jewels, and finds them missing too. To his utter surprise he now finds all his other jewels disappearing one by one. Brahmananda is completely baffled. His preceptor appears, reprimands him for his misdeeds, and tells him that the right Bikram is on his way to reach him and put an end to his reign of tyranny.\n\nBikram enters the hall in the fortress followed by Goopy and Bagha, and Goopy starts singing. Brahmananda is void of any super power now, as he is in front of Bikram, and Goopy's song freezes him. A supernatural glow from Bikram's face falls on Brahmananda and the latter, unable to stand the innocent glow of the non-violent Bikram, degenerates into particles. With the end of Brahmananda, his spell breaks on the other Bikrams. The story ends with Goopy and Bagha returning the jewels to the Kings of Shankhapur and Kanchanpur, before they return to their kingdom.\n\nAwards\n\nBFJA Awards in 1993\n\nBest Art Direction to Ashok Bose\n\nBest Cinematography to Barun Raha\n\nBest Editing to Dulal Dutta\n\nBest Lyrics to Satyajit Ray\n\nBest Music to Satyajit Ray\n\nBest Playback Singer (Male) to Anup Ghoshal\n\nMost Outstanding Work of the Year to Tapen Chatterjee\n\nBookmark on your Personal Space"
