        "text": "SATYAJIT RAY’s many faceted contributions to world culture include music. This music was mainly applied to his films. Just as his films are gems of social criticism, so his songs are socially relevant. This article dwells on Satyajit Ray’s music. We will mainly discuss how he applied music as background scores and songs in his films and the social relevance of his songs.\n\nThis essay examines Satyajit Ray’s children’s film Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (1969) to interrogate the ways it signals the utopian. Contending that its utopian desire manifests through the trope of wish-fulfillment (in particular, the granting of boons), it illuminates the trope’s centrality in the film’s imagination and articulation of freedom. Moreover, the essay suggests that the film’s utopianism is also anchored in its irrealist aesthetics. Engaging with the film’s figuration of ghosts and its violation of the narrative structure of the real, the essay illuminates how these formal features inform, and are informed by, a utopian desire. Furthermore, the essay notes that despite its inherent utopianism, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne fails to resolve some of the more obdurate social contradictions in its diegetic world, especially around questions of class, gender, and caste. Arguing that these “failures” are in keeping with its utopian spirit, I suggest they draw our attention to the imperfections of our real conditions of existence and flag the limits of textual utopianism. In so doing, they refer negatively to the social field beyond pointing to the abiding importance of class struggle as the ultimate agent of transformative social change.\n\nThe article delves into the recesses of an almost non-existent genre in Bengali cinema; that of the modern science fiction (SF). It proposes that the SF imagination in Bengali cinema is driven by the mode of fantasy and is an example of an alternative moder-nity which celebrates the technological aspirations of the community along with the indigenous cultural elements of Bengal. The template of fantasy also changes over time from magic to media-induced hallucinations to trace the contemporary techno-media culture, addressing the desires of a media savvy and image-addicted society.\n\nThe act of writing, owing to the permanence it craves, may be said to be in continuous interaction with the temporal flow of time. It continues to stimulate questions and open up avenues for discussion. Writing people, events and relationships into existence is a way of negotiating with the illusory. But writing falters. This paper attempts a reading of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne in terms of power politics through the lens of the manipulation of written codes and inscriptions in the film. Identities and cultures are constructed through inscriptions and writings. But in the wrong hands, this medium of communication which has the potential to bring people together may wreck havoc on the social and political system. Writing, or the misuse of it, in the case of the film, reveals the nature of reality as provisional. If writing gives a seal of authenticity to a message, it can also become the casualty of its own creation. Key words: Inscription, Power, Politics, Writing, Social system\n\nAbstract In this paper I intend to bring to light the cinematography of Satayjit Ray with a special reference to his movie Charulata (1964). The main focus in my paper is on dealing of human relationships and bringing to light the foulness of the so called fouled or broken nest of Bhupati and Charu. The paper also portrays Charu as a new woman who is bold enough to assert herself and capable of bringing forth the right. Key Words: Assertion, Patriarchy, Foulness, Relationships.\n\nIn my paper I intend to first explain different form of realism by discussing Ian Watt‟s definition of realism, in The Rise of The Novel comparing and contrasting it with Brecht and Luckas‟s idea of realism as explained in Bertolt Brecht: Against George Luckas. Secondly I will discuss in brief the difference between reality and realism in a work of fiction. Thirdly, I will talk about the portrayal of reality and realism in children‟s literature, using socialist realism and Brecht‟s view on it. In order to discuss third part of my paper I will analyze film maker Satyajit Ray and his socialistrealistfantasy film Hirak Rajar Deshe. The movie is adapted from Ray‟s father‟s collection of work for children name Goopy Gayen and Bagha Bayen."
