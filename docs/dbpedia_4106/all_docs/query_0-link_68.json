        "text": "09:26 pm\n\n[Link]\n\nTheen Kanya\n\nThe film Theen Kanya consists of three short films, all based on stories by Tagore, directed by Satyajit Ray. The background music for these films is done by Ray himself. Each of these stories has a woman as the main character, hence the name Theen \"Kanya\". I have read all the stories and watched the first two short films on Doordarshan sometime back. Still, watching them again was a beautiful experience.\n\n* * *\n\nThe first film Post Master has a poor orphan girl child of the village, Ratan (Chandana Banerjee) as the main character. When a new postmaster named Nandalal (Anil Chatterjee) comes to the village, Ratan is appointed as a helper to him. Nandalal is from the city and he finds the village life painful and boring. He is frustrated by the broken chair at his house, gets intimidated by the madman of the village, etc., and waits eagerly for the letters from his hometown. Ratan does the cooking, washing and cleaning at the house. Nandalal starts to teach Bengali to Ratan, as a way to get relief from boredom. Ratan proves to be a good student, and along with her thirst for learning she also develops a feeling that she has someone to call her own, like a parent. But she doesn’t know that the postmaster is trying hard to get a transfer to the city and escape from the village. The film ends with a touching climax which shows the little girl silently walking away, carrying a bucket full of water with great difficulty, as Nandalal on his way back to the city stands staring at her with a confused and troubled mind.\n\nNandalal is a bit of an insensitive man in the film. He is touched by the thoughts regarding Ratan's loneliness only when he is about to leave the village. Until then, he considers the girl just as someone to talk with and pass his time, and nothing more than that. As far as I remember, Tagore's characterization of the man was slightly different. If Ray had altered this for the film, then I think that was not necessary, as I find Tagore's story standing above Ray's film even though Post Master is indeed a moving film.\n\n* * *\n\nSampati is about the growing up of a girl from adolescence to womanhood. Amulya (Soumitra Chatterjee) comes back to his village after studies in the city and falls in love with Mrinmoyee (Aparna Sen, in her debut appearance), who spends her time roaming in the village carrying her pet squirrel. They get married, but on their \"first night\", Mrinmoyee runs away from their room and spends the night swinging and playing with her squirrel. She returns home next day, but a dejected Amulya leaves the place and goes back to the city. Even though Mrinmoyee is relieved at first, as days go on, she starts to feel lonely without her husband, dreams about him and wishes that he comes back. Even the death of her pet squirrel doesn’t affect her much.\n\nJust like Post Master, I felt that Ray's film, even after being a nice work of art itself, looks inferior when compared with Tagore's short story. Isn’t the portrayal of Mrinmoyee's transformation a bit abrupt and unconvincing? But Ray is successful in bringing the atmosphere of the village to screen. Rivers with few small boats moving here and there, vast wastelands with mist spreading in the horizon, country roads filled with mud, broken remains of an ancient temple - its all so enchanting.\n\n* * *\n\nMonihara is a unique Ray film as it is in a genre which Ray did only once - Horror. Ray has written several supernatural tales, but Monihara is the only ghost film he made (Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne also has ghosts, but it is not a horror film). The main character of the film is Monimalika, who is obsessed with jewelry. Her husband is in a crisis as a fire accident in his jute godown destroys his business. He has gone to the city, looking for funds to rebuild the business. Monimalika is worried that her husband would take away her ornaments as well, and she runs away to her parents' home with all the jewelry. On her way home, she gets killed. When her husband comes back with a new necklace for his wife, he is horrified to know of the developments. But in the night, the door of his mansion opens itself and a figure covered in black cloth walks to his room and places its hands on the new necklace.\n\nEven though Monihara has elements of Horror in it, I think the main theme of the film is Greed. Actually, one may not suspect it to be a ghost film in the beginning. The Horror element is not gelled with the entire movie and it is restricted to the last scenes. But it is amazing to see the great director building up horror in the climax scene using bare minimum technology and with almost nothing as background music: The statue of an owl and its shadow on the wall, a little flower vase with faded flowers, and the shadowy figure moving past these objects with light footsteps - and in the end, the hands of a skeleton touching the necklace with the haunting sound of a laughter in the background.\n\nTags: films"
