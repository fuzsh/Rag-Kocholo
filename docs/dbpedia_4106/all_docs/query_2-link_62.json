        "text": "If I were asked to map out the alleys of my childhood and retrace my footsteps to locate that one film which left an indelible mark on my young, impressionable mind, I’d never have to look further than the renowned Satyajit Ray movie, ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’. As one of Ray’s most memorable works, this 132 minute-long feature film masquerades as a children’s movie in plain sight, while concealing within its bosom a treasure trove of political satire, a strong anti-war notion and oodles of slapstick humour.\n\nGrowing up in a Bengali household, this film was my companion for breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day of my childhood, along with other Ray classics such as ‘Hirak Rajar Deshe’, ‘Sonar Kella’ and ‘Joy Baba Felunath’. At the outset, let me give a quick overview of the movie I’m jabbering on about for the benefit of my Non-Bengali readers (and the more modern breed of Bengali ones who find denouncing anything pertaining to their culture as the “new cool”).\n\n[Those who feel they have a basic idea of the movie, feel free to scroll through till you hit the next sub-heading.]\n\n‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ in a nutshell\n\nPoster of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne [Sandesh Patrika, April 1968] (Image via Cinemascope)\n\n‘Goopy Gyne o Bagha Byne‘ was first conceived as a short story in the year 1915 by Ray’s paternal grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury, an eminent writer and technologist of his time and the founder of the children’s magazine, Sandesh. What was an eleven page-long fable meant for children, Satyajit Ray adapted into a full-length feature film in 1969 by keeping the premise same and enhanced it into a beautifully layered visual treat.\n\nOur protagonists are two; Goopy Gyne (portrayed by Tapen Chatterjee), a terrible singer who can’t hit the right notes to save his life and being naively oblivious to the fact, can’t seem to quench his thirst for singing, and Bagha Byne (Rabi Ghosh), an equally appalling drummer. Frustrated at their unbearable manifestations in the name of music, the duo is banished from their respective villages (Amloki and Hortuki). They happen to chance upon each other on the first night of their abolishment in a dense bamboo forest inhabited in equal proportions by ferocious tigers and friendly ghosts.\n\nSoon after narrowly escaping an approaching tiger, Goopy- Bagha break out into a tuneless song to celebrate their survival. Pleased at their particular brand of cacophony in the pitch-black darkness, the emperor of the ghosts (Bhooter Raja) descends himself and grants them three wishes – the ability to summon food and clothing by hi-fiving each other, to turn into globe-trotters instantly by slipping into a pair of magical shoes each and to sing and play the drum enchantingly enough to transfix the listener, quite literally.\n\nArmed with these powers, Goopy- Bagha are appointed as the court singers of the music-loving, kind-hearted ruler of Shundi, a kingdom where the subjects are incapable of speech owing to a maleficent curse cast on them by the evil minds of the neighbouring land, Halla, but without a dearth in their happiness and prosperity.\n\nSoon enough, the happy trajectory is disturbed by the ruler of Halla, who’s the twin brother of the king of Shundi (Santosh Dutta) – a man of childish innocence gone rogue under the ministrations of his Prime Minister (Jahar Roy) and a magician from a distant land speaking an unintelligible dialect, Borfi (Harin Chattopadhyay). When Halla declares a war on Shundi, it’s Goopy-Bagha who embark on a delightful journey filled with song, dance, fantasy and magic to save the day.\n\nThe evil Prime Minister is thwarted in his attempts to usurp a peace-loving kingdom, the subdued king of Halla is liberated and reunited with his elder brother, the innocent subjects’ speech is restored and war is averted. Our lovable duo, as a reward for their bravery, are married to the princesses of the two kingdoms they rescued and they all live happily ever after.\n\nThe Dance of the Ghosts\n\nFor the time being, I’d like to draw your attention towards a particular six-and-a-half-minute long dance sequence in the movie. For a film that has been termed as a ‘musical’ from the very beginning, mellifluous songs and dances are expected to be there in plenty (ten, to be precise). But this wordless dance sequence, in particular, has always stayed with me since my early days, knitted into the mesh of my consciousness.\n\nThe setting is this: Goopy-Bagha have averted death at the paws of a mighty Royal Bengal Tiger and are prancing about gleefully, expressing their jubilation at not being eaten for dinner via their tuneless singing and drum beating. Once their coarse drum beating coupled with hoarse singing ensues, there appears a horde of stick-thin, shadowy black creatures around them, who dance their way to glory. They’re nothing but the regular residents of the jungle – ghosts!\n\nFollowing suit, appears the regal Bhooter Raja (King of the Ghosts), all decked up and glittery like a bright, shiny Christmas tree – a character that Ray voiced himself and by means of some expert ministrations with the recording, successfully lent it an eerie quality. Now, he might just be an apparition, but he’s still the king, ain’t he? Impressed at the idiosyncrasies of the two churlish young men in front of him, our friendly Bhooter Raja presents for the pleasure of their eyes, a dance drama of his own. And so commences one of my favourite cinematic experiences of all time. Here, have a look! (Do visit the video link on YouTube given below to watch since playback via embedding has been disabled by the video owner.)\n\nLoved it? Felt intrigued? Not quite sure what to make of it? Lost interest midway because it seemed too monotonous? I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel exasperated and a teeny bit bored the first time I came across this scene. But the inherent mysticism that shrouds the sequence, as prevalent as the fog that engulfs and swirls around the characters in ‘Kanchenjunga’ (another lyrical Ray movie), enamoured me from the very beginning.\n\nWhen asked to encapsulate the sequence in his own words, Satyajit Ray wrote to W. Andrew Robinson (respected British writer and author of one of the most definitive works on Ray, ‘The Inner Eye’), “a most abstract, avant-garde affair which I haven’t the faintest idea how people are going to react to… It is surely the most striking thing ever done in cinematic choreography.”\n\nMechanisms behind the Ghost Dance\n\nNot many know that Ray had dreamt of shooting ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne‘ in colour but had had to backtrack owing to lack of funds. Consequently, the technology used in filming the six-odd minute-long dance sequence isn’t particularly top-notch when compared to the Western means of filming at that time but it does not, by any means, dilute the cinematic quality of the sequence.\n\nOn the contrary, the usage of the simplest of camera tricks such as negative printing and unadulterated Indian classical music played on a variety of instruments provides an earthly charm, that is able to permeate the scene and cut through the bizarreness of the setting, just as a blueberry compote cuts through the rich creaminess of a cheesecake and cleanses our palate.\n\nAndrew Robinson, in his gem of a work ‘The Inner Eye’ voices his knowledge about the scene with refreshing lucidity. Elucidating on the usage of music, he writes, “As for the music, he [Ray] felt it should have ‘some order, form and precision’ and not be just ‘a woolly formless kind of thing.’ With the idea of four classes in mind, he now happened to remember a South Indian classical form he had once heard live at the Delhi Film Festival… He deliberately avoided melody ‘because melody suggests a kind of sophistication’; he wanted only rhythm.”\n\nNow, at the very outset, it’s very evident that the ghosts aren’t all quite the same. You’d hope to be liberated from the shackles of caste, creed, gender and religion once you’re dead, eh? Well, these gentlemen haven’t been so lucky, no. Even death doesn’t spare them of the vicious limbo of being branded with a social status.\n\nAs is very evident from the choice of apparels that distinguishes one group of ghosts from the other in the slightly shimmery scenes that we witness, in Ray’s universe, there are four basic strata amongst the ones that have transcended the mortal plateau: the kings and the warriors, the common man, the Sahibs and the intellectuals (the latter class boasts of the most variety with padres, priests, lawyers all in abundance within its ranks).\n\nA startling accuracy in the conversion of thoughts into tangible reality conveys that Ray had a crystal clear vision as to how he wanted this sequence to look and to sound, rhythmic on the surface yet brimming with the uncertainty of becoming jarring at any instant. He used four Indian percussion instruments to serve the purpose – the mridangam for the kings and warriors, the ganjira for the commoners, the ghattom for the Sahibs and the mursring for the intellectuals. Interestingly, as Robinson points out, the Sahibs were obtained by filming shadow-puppets at sixteen frames per second while the remaining three strata were portrayed by actors.\n\nMy take on the Dance of the Ghosts\n\nWatching this scene has always made me feel intrigued and a little exasperated at the same time. It’s one of those works from a genius like Satyajit Ray that conceal their secrets as deftly as Leonardo da Vinci would mask the telling pieces of his paintings with layers of paint, turning it effectively into a jigsaw puzzle whose solution keeps slipping out of your reach. Is it just another song and dance crafted to entertain kids? Or is it trying to attract your attention to a bigger picture?\n\nAuthors like Andrew Robinson, Marie Seton and Chidananda Dasgupta have penned some insightful pieces on the undertones of this scene in their books and I’ve been fortunate enough to have read them. However, try as hard as I may, I’ve been unable to find any extensive work on the internet regarding this particular sequence. Considering a major portion of the current generation finds its fix online, the absence of proper literature on the topic is vexing indeed. I know this for a fact that every time I watch this scene, I find myself viewing it under a different light. And so here, I humbly present to you, my take on the ‘Dance of the Ghosts’.\n\nA subtle commentary on pre-independence feudalism, inter-class conflict in India and its relevance in the present day\n\nThe need to compartmentalise apparitions to conform to societal classes is ridiculous and thought-provoking all at once. All the four classes seem to be indulging in their own form of dance, somehow prodding us to digest the fact that even death hasn’t allowed them to dispel with the wretched feudal hierarchy. Even without their bodily existence, they continue to gyrate to the roles of their ‘before’-lives. This makes us very painfully aware of how obnoxiously pervasive and deep-rooted the feudal construct had been in India back in the pre-independence days (depiction of Sahibs helps us establish a sketchy British colonial era timeline to refer to).\n\n“The dance begins with each class introducing itself to the sound of its characteristic instrument, while making its characteristic movement”, writes Robinson in his minute observation of the sequence. There’s a certain presentability in the nature of the motion within each class in the beginning, a harmony, a natural tandem, a binding cohesion in the way the ghosts of every strata mirror each other’s movements.\n\nThe kings, warriors and common men march past in a fluid military left-right pattern. The Sahibs stand stoically at first and then greet each other with crisp Victorian bows. The priests, padres, lawyers, in short the self-proclaimed spiritually and intellectually superior class, hop about while genially facing each other for the most part. However, as we edge into the fourth minute of the mind-boggling dance frenzy, we begin to sense that things are not as hunky-dory as they’d previously seemed. The music begins to gather tempo and the ghosts’ dance spirals into a high-octane rhythm, ominous in its increasing pace.\n\nKings, warriors and common men dance more urgently with pronounced hand and feet movements. The Sahibs resort to shooing off a hookah-bearing servant drunkenly, dancing haphazardly, brandishing guns at the drop of a hat – death hasn’t been able to mellow down their notoriety. The intellectuals move in short steps, preaching their own gospels with a remarkable sense of self-assurance, with one of them aggressively waving a holy scripture in the faces of his fellow-mates.\n\nThe frenzy keeps mounting as members of each class bump into each other, drawing swords and casting threatening gestures. War is here! The end is inevitable. Ironically, in spite of being beyond the grasp of death, the ghosts exchange blows as the music reaches its crescendo and subsequently, they drop to the floor, motionless. Even death doesn’t help them rise above the trivialities that led them to reach their afterlives in the first place; it’s almost as if they’re stuck in a never-ending cycle to kill and be killed.\n\nInterestingly, no intra-class feud is depicted in these six minutes which makes the message loud and clear – our conflict with our own brethren is the root cause of our downfall. Whenever we play the blame game of being oppressed and manipulated by a certain section of the society as an excuse for our own tiffs, we’re inadvertently arming them with the power to feel superior, thereby widening the chasm of inequality we cry foul about, ourselves.\n\nJust as the padre glares menacingly at the priest and the latter stares back in defiance, the warriors rebel against the kings and the caricaturish Sahibs fight amongst themselves (the last one being a subtle nudge towards the end of British colonialism in India), it’s the jealousy and intolerance towards our own fellow beings, the inability to accommodate opinions contrasting our own that pushes us down the lane of violence. That it’s mere foolishness to consider this construct to be circa 1947 is all the more alarming.\n\nWhile speaking recently on the critically acclaimed television series based on Margaret Atwood’s novel ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’, staff writer of the series Caroline Framke reflected on “the idea of other women acting as collaborators in their own oppression.” Ray’s sequence seems to reflect the same thought process, only in a more generalised manner.\n\nThe more you think about it, the more you find the same evils embedded in our society to this very day. From women not being allowed to have social media accounts in certain reputed engineering colleges, Panchayat elections turning bloody in order to prevent the opposition from filing nominations to young men getting lynched by mobs for their choice of meat consumption, the malady of barbaric inhumanity is festered by the toxic dynamics of class-division, inequality and intolerance.\n\nThe downfall of pseudo-intellectualism and organised religion\n\nRay’s vociferous commentary on the perils of organised religion and pseudo-intellectualism shines through the words of Manomohan Mitra (played by Utpal Dutt) in ‘Agantuk’. The same idea had found its outlet 22 years earlier in this particular sequence of the ‘Dance of the Ghosts’. The class of fat-bellied gentlemen, if you observe closely, is an amalgamation of priests with others prostrating in front of them for blessings, padres reading the Bible and spirits of lawyers with the typical white barrister’s band wound around their necks.\n\nThe pantomime put up by this particular stratum reminds me strongly of William Shakespeare’s description of the fifth stage of man in his narration of the ‘Seven Ages of Man’ in the play ‘As You Like It’.\n\n“And then the justice,\n\nIn fair round belly with good capon lin’d,\n\nWith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,\n\nFull of wise saws and modern instances;\n\nAnd so he plays his part.”\n\nPaints quite the same picture, doesn’t it? This particular class is gifted with a fat, round abdomen by the director, restricting its members to minimal movement owing to their short feet and tendency to bump into each other’s protruding bellies. While one can be mislead to take these ghosts as a zany element in the sequence owing to the comical usage of music, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nOne can view the heavy bellies to be symbolic of the over-inflated ego of the ghosts, overtly proud at their own notions of intellectualism. As a result, this class is the least proactive of all the ghosts, weighed down by their presumptuousness, waddling about with an unnecessary flourish and attempting to look important, personifying the term ‘armchair critic.’ In spite of their intellectually stimulated minds that should ideally alleviate their worldly suffering and make them receptive to new knowledge, they’re stuck in their own little bubble, busy seeking validation from their fellow-beings and if contradicted, imposing their views with wilful vengeance. Reeks strongly of the Trumpian and Modi-an models of reign, doesn’t it? (Kudos to you if you smiled wryly at the word ‘reign’).\n\nRobinson has quite correctly summed up Ray’s disdain towards pseudo-intellectuals putting up a farce of knowledge they’re not in possession of as, “Not that he [Ray] is a snob; he is willing to talk to anyone at any level… but he finds it difficult to tolerate insincerity, insensitivity or stupidity in a person or an artistic production for very long. That is why he distrusts politicians and lawyers, for instance, and why he can seem remote, aloof or even cold to some.”\n\nThe most interesting treatment that Ray subjects these ghosts to is the way he chooses to kill them off. While the rest of the classes tussle and scuffle amongst themselves, our pot-bellied, fine-minded spectres simply huff and puff and drop dead in an instant, without any major fracas. The so-called ‘learned’, who consider themselves as superior beings by virtue of their enhanced cognition, don’t need guns and knives to kill each other off. The corruption of knowledge that renders one blind to logic, makes one believe that his/her version is irrefutable and angers one if questioned is enough to spell doom for them.\n\nEaster Egg: Note how a small book-like object lies discarded on the floor as the intellectuals quarrel amongst themselves. Since the only scripture shown in the sequence is a Bible with a cross on it, we can assume it to be the object that’s kicked around in the madness. It’s almost as if the director tries to symbolise the slow death of knowledge at the hands of the so-called ‘educated’ phantoms who’re unable to imbibe the greater spirit of peace, harmony, tolerance and co-existence that every spiritual literature preaches, be it the Bhagavad Gita, the Quran, the Holy Bible or the Torah.\n\nHidden connotations in the last frame\n\nAbiding by the popular Bengali proverb, “Ostaad er maar shesh raat e” (A genius delivers his/ her best at the final stroke of the hour), Ray paints his masterstroke in the very final scene of the six-odd minute-long dance sequence. The war is over, all the apparitions have been re-captured by the clammy hands of death and yet, we see them resurrected as they dance their way to glory once again. This time, however, all the four classes are brought into the same frame, arranged atop each other as neatly as the books on a library shelf.\n\n“Music is able to restore the harmony of ghosts, even if humans will insist on fighting, killing and dying,” notes Robinson. Can this then be termed as a cinematic depiction of Nirvana, the state where our spirits are finally free of all earthly pettiness? How many deaths do we have to die to attain that state of transcendence? The answers to these questions lie in the eyes of the beholder, you may say.\n\nAn interesting visual play that Ray indulges in, in this scene is the inversion of the popularly accepted version of the social pyramid. Note that the common man resides in the highest level of the quadrilateral, followed by the kings, warriors and the Sahibs. The intellectuals, who are usually considered to be the cream of the society, are found lurking at the very bottom of the structure.\n\nWhile some may critique this scene as just another hierarchical structure brought into play, thereby defeating the purpose of the director’s message, note that there’s no peak to this structure, unlike a pyramid. So the question of being superior to one another doesn’t arise. They’re rather like the multi-coloured pieces of a Rubik’s Cube, all equally important to bring about completion.\n\nLast but not the least, we observe a minute hint of roundness near the edges of the platforms that the ghosts dance on in the end, giving the impression of them being inside a circular setting – a subtle parallel drawn with the Earth that we reside in, perhaps? This might have been Ray’s sagacious way of telling us that it’s time to dispel with the archaic notions that divide us and force us to plummet to our own ruination. Only as masterful a story-teller as Satyajit Ray could’ve conveyed such powerful ideas in the folds of what can be called a fairy-tale at heart, a movie that holds a child and an adult equally enraptured in wide-eyed amazement even after nearly five decades of first being released.
