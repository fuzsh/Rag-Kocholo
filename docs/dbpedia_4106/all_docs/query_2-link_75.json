        "text": "The Kingdom of Diamonds (Hirak Rajar Deshe) is Satyajit Ray’s 1980 follow-up to his acclaimed musical comedy The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha. The film continues the fantasy adventures of Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne as they travel to Hirak after receiving an invitation to the court of the Diamond King. They soon learn that the king is actually an evil tyrant who hoards wealth while his subjects starve. Anyone who protests becomes victim to a sinister brainwashing plot that rewrites their thoughts with mindless rhyming slogans. With their magical abilities, Goopy and Bagha join virtuous schoolteacher Udayan to put an end to the Diamond King’s tyranny. Critics and audiences have celebrated the film’s dystopian themes and political commentary alongside its lighthearted laughs and richly poetic screenplay.\n\nMoinak Biswas (Film Studies, Jadavpur University), Supriya Chaudhuri (English, Jadavpur University), and graphic illustrator-designer Pinaki De joined moderator Bhaskar Sarkar (Film and Media Studies, UCSB) for a post-screening discussion of The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha and The Kingdom of Diamonds.\n\nThe movie theater has always been a space of wonder and anxiety. Since the inception of the cinema, audiences have enjoyed the collective experience of viewing a film on the big screen, but fears of contagion and disease have undercut that pleasure since the cinema’s earliest years. In our current moment, closures of international festivals and competition with streaming platforms have significantly altered the film industry. The Carsey-Wolf Center’s “Big Screen” series at the Pollock Theater will explore this tension as we welcome cinemagoers back to the theater. The series will spotlight films made to be seen on the big screen, including works that are almost never seen in North America (Satyajit Ray), as well as classical Hollywood films (featuring Bette Davis) and early slapstick comedy (Buster Keaton and more). This series will recall those early cinemagoers who first marveled at early moving pictures or new technologies like Cinerama and CinemaScope, and invite conversations with scholars and filmmakers about their varied, personal, and unexpected experiences with the big screen."
