        "text": "\"There is no higher form of artistic expression than films\"\n\nIt is said that a mark of a great film is that you find something new everytime you watch it. One such Bengali film is Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. This 1969 Indian Bengali (fantasy adventure comedy) film was directed by Satyajit Ray ( first oscar winner for India).\n\nThe story of the film revolves around two impoverished boys Goopy and Bagha who have been thrown out of their villages for being a nuisance. While in exile, they start singing and drumming to scare off a tiger, and in the process attract a benevolent ghost who falls in love with their fantastic musical abilities. So impressed is the ghost of ghosts that he grants them three life changing boons. After a quick thought, Goopy & Bagha ask for three essential wishes that will make their lives a smooth ride, namely:\n\n1. Food and clothes shall appear whenever they ask for it.\n\n2. Travel anywhere in a second's notice by simply slipping into their magical slippers\n\n3. Supreme musical skills so that they can serve people with good music and hold them in awe to gain admiration and respect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have watched this movie many times and everytime I come up with a different learning. It also amazes me how situations prevalent then (1969), are still lurking on today (2014) in India, and most parts of the world.\n\nThis movie is a must watch for all the children of the world, regardless of nationalities and languages as it speaks on a human level. It revolves around hope, wishes, imagination, determination, admiration and good overpowering evil.\n\nMay be as educators, mentors, parents and nation states we can derive inspiration from this movie and prepare our children for only 4 things:\n\n1. Train & equip children in such a way that they can get their basic needs met.\n\n2. Inspire and fuel their imagination to such an extent that they willingly become global citizens and travel the world to feel one-ness of humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Help them identify their uniqueness/ own special talent, and how to make a living out of it, so that they never run out of passion, feel stressed, unworthy or become disinterested in life.\n\n4. Teach patience so that they never fall out of hope because it will help them to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know that it will all work out in the end. As someone, somewhere will always come to help out.\n\nThe rest I know they will manage in their own sweet time. As Swami Vivekananda states, a seed always knows its potential, it just needs nurturing in the initial years. Our duty as educators of the world is to provide this key source of energy for the seedlings of today and tomorrow."
