        "text": "Satyajit Ray isn't a name that is restricted to India or known only to Indians. This name is synonymous to path-breaking cinema that changed how the world saw Indian film-making.\n\nFamous Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa once said, “Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” Others, such as Wes Anderson and Francis Coppola are known to be inspired by the man who is often seen as the face of Indian cinema.\n\nImage A\n\nPoetry pervaded his work, and a truthfulness that was inherent in every story Ray told, turned his creations into timeless pieces. The cinematic naturalism that was idiosyncratic to Ray's oeuvre, was both enlightening and entertaining. The manner in which Ray's stories unfold is simple yet impactful.\n\nHowever, regardless of whether you consider yourself a cinephile or not, there are a few films Ray created, which are a must-watch for every man. No matter the genre or plots that interest you, these movies will leave you with a new perspective on life and a new-found love for good cinema:\n\n1. Aranyer Din Ratri\n\nA story that traces the life and times of four friends, this film was based on the novel by the same name, written by Sunil Gangopadhyay. The film narrates the adventures of contemporary Indian men very realistically. A group of friends escape the metropolitan din for the weekend, and Ray takes us on a vacation with the four of them. The film was even nominated for the Golden Bear for Best Film at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n2. Agantuk\n\nBased on one of Ray's own short stories, and his last work to make it to the big screen, this one is about the sudden appearance of a guest, no one expected to see. Featuring Utpal Dutt in the lead, he portrays a stranger-cum-guest, who visits a distant niece at her house after years of staying out of touch. With a stunning plot and meaningful dialogues, this one won three National Film awards.\n\n3. Mahanagar\n\nBased on Narendranath Mitra's short story, this one revolves around themes of fear and courage, told through a woman's point-of-view on significant matters involving money, labour and justice. Ray does a wonderful job of dealing with poignant affairs, laced with empathy. From marriage to work-life balance and living with ageing parents, and speaking up against injustice, this one has everything.\n\n4. Pratidwandi\n\nStemmed around the rise of the Naxalite movement in Bengal, the film tells the story about a young, educated man and how his life undergoes great changes amid corruption and unemployment.\n\n5. Abhijan\n\nA film rooted in the very diseases that plagued the society post India's independence, this one was packed with such impeccable showmanship, that Martin Scorsese admitted that the protagonist of the film directly inspired Robert De Niro's character in the film 'Taxi Driver'. Riveting, enlightening and a story that is relevant for all times.\n\n6. The Apu Trilogy\n\nThe trilogy comprises of 'Pather Panchali', 'Aparajito' and 'Apur Sansar' and marks the debut of the great director in Indian cinema. Through this film, Ray presented the three stages in the protagonist Apu's life. One of the best films you can possibly start off with.\n\n7. Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne\n\nProbably one of Ray's best creations, the story revolves around the adventures of Goopy and Bagha. After the duo comes in contact with a team of ghosts and is granted three wishes by the Ghost King, they set out on a very innovative journey which will get you hooked! The film won the National Award for the best film, apart from many international awards."
