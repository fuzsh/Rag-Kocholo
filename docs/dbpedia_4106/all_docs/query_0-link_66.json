        "text": "Satyajit Ray, the name itself conveys a lot to me. A personality with huge amount of talent, a rare example of creative diversity, a lifetime legend. His versatility extends as a legendary film-maker to a great writer, a music composer and a graphic designer. He is a repository of creative insight and is known to be one of the greatest movie makers of 20th century. Not only in India, his work has been recognized at International level.\n\nWhen you watch Ray’s films, its all about common human relationships, poverty, fear, struggle, joy,humanity depicted in a classic manner, a perfect blend of intellect and emotions. All the movies directed by him belong to different genre but you can have a unique experience while watching each one of them. In spite of being in 20th century, his movies are based on modern thinking and the characters emphasize a psychological conflict between tradition and modernity. To name a few of his films that belong to my favourite list are Sonar Kella(The Golden Fortress), Joy Baba Felunath(The Elephant God), Pather Panchli(Song of the Little Road), Agantuk(The Stranger), Teen Kanya(Three Daughters), Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne(The adventures of Goopy and Bagha), Heerok Rajar Deshe(The Kingdom of Diamonds).\n\nMost of his movies are made in Bengali, a very few in Hindi but the language did not restrict his periphery to India. “Pather Panchali” was one of his biggest success in Bengal in the year 1955 followed by grabbing a major award in Cannes International Film Festival in 1956. That was the beginning and afterwards he serially received a number of vital awards throughout his lifelong career. In 1978, the organizing committee of Berlin Film Festival ranked him as one of the three all time best directors, he was honoured with “Dadasaheb Phalke Award” in 1985, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Ray an honorary “Oscar” in 1992 for “Lifetime Achievement”, Government of India honoured him with prestigious “Bharat Ratna” and many more are there in his list including national as well as international.\n\nComing to his writing part, I am a big fan of his books named “Feluda” (a detective series) and “Professor Shonku” (stories based on science fiction). He wrote a number of short stories and all his screen plays are written by himself. Most of his writings have now been translated to English which is finding a wider spectrum of readers. He was also a well known cover page designer of his own books as well as the books of other authors.\n\nTo tell briefly on his background, he was the only child of Sukumar Ray(a famous writer) and Suprabha Ray. After completing his graduation from Presidence College in Calcutta, he joined Tagore’s Art University at Shantiniketan. This is the place where he learned more about the art and culture of India as well as Eastern countries. Ray was greatly influenced by Rabindranath Tagore and made few of his finest films based on his novels and other works. In a lifespan of 70 years he made remarkable impact on Indian cinema, its culture, its thoughtprocess, finetuning it in his own artistic way.\n\nThe best thing which I like in most of his films is about the bold and strong female characters portrayed very differently. One of the critics “Akira Kurosawa” said about Ray’s films ” Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.”"
