It is general in nature and can be anywhere in the paragraph. The other sentences in the paragraph support, prove, give examples and present additional information on the topic sentence. Identify the topic sentence in the first paragraph. How many examples are given to support the topic sentence? What are they?\n\nAnswer:\n\nTopic sentence: No one can beat Hollywood when it comes to making films with animals in them.\n\nTwo examples are given. One is the Alsatian called Rin-tin-tin. The other is the collie called Lassie.\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nDoes the second paragraph introduce a new topic sentence? If not, what supporting detail about the animal actors of Hollywood do you get from this paragraph?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, there is no new topic sentence. The second paragraph elaborates on the first. Here we see another large dog in Disney Studio in Hollywood.\n\na. What additional information do you get about standings?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe come to know that there are stand-ins even for animals.\n\nb. What is the puzzling incident described in the paragraph 3?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhen the cameraman shouted to everyone to take their positions, the dog, the main actor, remained where it was.\n\nc. Which incident shows that the animal-actors in Hollywood were treated with reverence?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe incident of bringing a stand-in fora dog. Usually stand-ins are used only for celebrity actors who are held in high reference.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nWhat were the difficulties Alfred Hitchcock had to face while making the film ‘Birds’?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHitchcock wanted a variety of trained birds, especially many ravens, as actors in his film. It was not easy to get trained birds.\n\nQuestion 4.\n\nHow did Hitchcock manage to get a large number of ravens for his film?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe placed advertisements all over the USA asking for people who had trained ravens with them. Then a man, with nearly a 100 trained ravens, responded.\n\nQuestion 5.\n\nWhat is described as ‘pretty impressive’?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe sight of fifty ravens perching quietly in a row on a specified spot, obeying the order of their trainer.\n\nQuestion 6.\n\nIdentify the main topic of the article from para 8.\n\nAnswer:\n\nShooting films using tigers.\n\nQuestion 7.\n\nWhat other details are given about the topic in the paragraph?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn the film ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’, Goopy and Bagha suddenly come across a tiger that is walking about in the forest without paying them any attention.\n\nQuestion 8.\n\nHow did Ray manage to get a tiger?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe managed to get one from ‘Bharat Circus’ which was performing in Calcutta at that time.\n\nQuestion 9.\n\nWhat is the role of a ringmaster in a circus?\n\nAnswer:\n\nA ringmaster is a master of ceremonies. He introduces the various acts in a circus show and guides the audience through the experience, directing their attention to the various areas of the circus arena. In some places, the name ringmaster is used to mean the person who arranges the various performances by trained animals.\n\nQuestion 10.\n\nWhat were the difficulties faced in bringing the tiger before the camera?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe main problem was how to keep the people safe from the tiger, once it is let out of the cage. In the shots for the film, the trainer should not be seen. On the first occasion, the tiger pranced about. Later, the scenes that were shot were not good enough. The second time the tiger charged towards the crowd, terrifying them.\n\nQuestion 11.\n\nWhat does the expression ‘to go down the drain’ mean?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt means the efforts were wasted. There was no gain from the work one did.\n\nQuestion 12.\n\nWhat was Mr. Thorat’s suggestion to control the tiger?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe suggested putting a ring made of thin wire around the neck of the tiger. The ring would be hooked to a length of wire so that the tiger does not go out of control.\n\nQuestion 13.\n\nWhat made Ray think of a collar made of tiger skin?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe scene to be shot was Goopy and Bagha getting terrified at the sight of a tiger. If the tiger has a ring on its neck, and it seen in the shot, the scene will have no meaning as people don’t get frightened when they see a tiger under the control of a trainer. Ray wanted to hide the wire and that is why he thought of a collar made of tiger skin. The wire will be hidden in the collar.\n\nQuestion 14.\n\nWhy did Mr. Thorat bring two tigers instead of one?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe brought two so that in case one does not behave properly, the other could be used for shooting the scene.\n\nQuestion 15.\n\nWhy was Mr. Thorat taken aback?\n\nAnswer:\n\nMr. Thorat was taken aback because of the unexpected behaviour of the tiger. Instead of walking quietly in a dignified manner, it started jumping and running about with a lot of energy.\n\nQuestion 16.\n\nWhat might be the reason for the tiger’s unexpected behaviour?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe reason was ‘the call of the wild’. When it saw itself in the open forest, he must have forgotten for a while that he is a circus animal! Probably he was showing his original instinct to be free.\n\nQuestion 17.\n\nHow does Ray describe the situation humorously?\n\nAnswer:\n\nRay describes the situation humorously by saying that they were getting to see a strange kind of circus for free.\n\nQuestion 18.\n\nWhat did Ray mean when he said, This should have been the end of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhen the tiger calmed down, they took a few shots as needed. This should have been the end f the story. But when they went back to Calcutta, they found the shots were not clear and they had to reshoot the scenes again at another time.\n\nQuestion 19.\n\nWhy was Mr Thorat asked‘to give it another go?\n\nAnswer:\n\nMr Thorat was asked ‘to give it another go’ because the first shots were not clear and they had to shoot the scenes again.\n\nQuestion 20.\n\nWhat was the ‘magic’ performed by the tiger?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThere were nearly 150 villagers who had come to see the shooting. They were told to keep a safe distance because of the tiger. But they ignored instructions and came as close to the camera as they could. When the cage was opened, the tiger jumped down with a roar and charged towards the crowd. They melted away as if my magic.\n\nQuestion 21.\n\nWhat was really required of the tiger in that scene?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe tiger was required to pace quietly about without paying any attention to the characters Goopy and Bagha who were exiled into the forest by their king.\n\nQuestion 22.\n\nWhat did Ray and his team realize two days later?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThey realized that this time the tiger and the camera had behaved well and they got the type of shots they had wanted.\n\nProject Tiger Textual Activities and Answers\n\nActivity 1\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nSatyajit Ray and his friends had to shoot scenes involving the tiger twice, M Notun Gram and Boral. Write the events that took place in both the places in a sequential order and then describe the shooting:\n\nAnswer:\n\nShooting at Notun Gram Shooting at Boral\n\nFound a suitable bamboo grove in Notun Gram.\n\nA lorry arrived with two well-fed tigers.\n\nA tripod was placed facing the bamboo grove to mount the camera.\n\nThe audience was instructed to get behind the camera.\n\nGoopy and Bagha were placed close to the bamboo grove so that they could be seen along with the tiger.\n\nA five-foot iron rod was fixed to the ground, some 30 feet from the area where the tiger was to walk\n\nA tiger-skin collar with a thin wire inside was placed in the neck of the tiger.\n\nThe door of the cage was opened and the tiger jumped out. But instead of walking calmly it started running and jumping about.\n\nWhen it became calm some shots were taken.\n\nBut the shots were dark owing to poor light.\n\nFound bamboo grove near Calcutta in Boral.\n\nThe lorry arrived with Thorat, the tiger, the steel wire, the special collar and the iron rod.\n\nThe whole village came to watch the shooting.\n\nThe villagers were told to keep at 70 feet away from the scene of the shot.\n\nWithout listening to the instructions, the entire crowd got as close to the camera as they could.\n\nThorat opened the cage. With a roar the tiger charged towards the crowd.\n\nThe crowd disappeared as if my magic.\n\nThe tiger calmed down and the shots were’ taken as required\n\nThis time the tiger and the camera behaved well.\n\nDescription of the shooting:\n\nWe found a suitable bamboo grove in Notun Gram. As arranged with Mr. Thorat of Bharat Circus, a lorry arrived with two well-fed tigers. He brought two so that if one did not do things properly the other could be used. Atripod was placed facing the bamboo grove to mount the camera. The audience was instructed to get behind the camera. Goopy and Bagha were placed close to the bamboo grove so that they could be seen along with the tiger. A five-foot iron rod was fixed to the ground, some 30 feet from the area where the tiger was to walk. A tiger-skin collar with a thin wire inside was placed in the neck of the tiger. The door of the cage was opened and the tiger jumped out. But instead of walking calmly it started running and jumping about. When it became calm some shots were taken. But the shots were later found to be dark owing to poor light.\n\nThe scenes had to be shot a second time. A bamboo grove near Calcutta in Boral was found. The lorry arrived with Thorat, the tiger, the steel wire, the special collar and the iron rod. The whole village came to watch the shooting. The villagers were told to keep at least 70 feet away from the scene of the shot. Without listening to the instructions, the entire crowd got as close to the camera as they could. Thorat opened the cage. With a roar the tiger charged towards the crowd. The crowd disappeared as if my magic. Soon the tiger calmed down and the shots were taken as required. This time the tiger and the camera behaved well.\n\nActivity 2\n\nQuestion 2.\n\nRay and his friends visited the Bharat Circus camp in Calcutta to hire a tiger to be filmed for his movie Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. He spoke to the manager of the circus company.\n\nWhat would Ray have spoken? Attempt a conversation between Ray and the Manager.\n\nAnswer:\n\nRay : Good morning, Manager! I am Ray, Satyajit Ray, a film director.\n\nManager : Good Morning Mr. Ray. I have heard a lot about you. What brings you here?\n\nRay : I am shooting a film with a tiger in it. The tiger has only a small role. It has to be seen along with two of our actors.\n\nManager : Well, our ringmaster is Mr. Thorat, a nice gentleman. I will ask him if it is possible to send our tiger out on such missions. If he agrees, I will have no problem. I will definitely help you.\n\nRay : Thank you, very, much. I should meet Mr. Thorat, or will you speak with him?\n\nManager :’I will speak with him first, and then you can meet him for making the final arrangement. By the way, for how long do you want the tiger?\n\nRay : Actually the shooting will be just for two hours. But then there is the travelling time. We intend to take the shots at Notun Gram which is a bit far from here.\n\nManager : No problem. Thorat will be the one to decide finally as he handles the animals here. But I’m sure he will agree.\n\nRay : Thank you very much.\n\nManger : It’s okay.\n\nActivity 3\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nRead the instructions on below\n\nDraft the likely notice that was published in the newspaper.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNotice\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Productions, Trinity Street, Hollywood, is planning to make a movie titled “Birds”. In the story binds from all overthe world are seen attacking humans. We need a variety of trained birds, especially a large number of ravens. If you have trained birds of any kind, especially birds of prey, you have an opportunity here to display them and their skills to the entire world. Handsome payments will be made forthe chosen binds.

It acted even better than humans. Later there were some films with a collie called Lassie. It looked as if the director could make Lassie act the way he wanted it to act. These dogs were like stars and they were paid like any other big actor. Their owners could easily get one lakh rupees from just one film.

Ray directed 36 films. He was also a fiction writer, publisher, illustrator, calligrapher, music composer and film critic. He has written many short stories and novels.\n\nProject Tiger Summary in English\n\nPage – 43\n\n1. No one can beat Hollywood when it comes to making films with animals in them. I remember many such films in which there was an Alsatian named Rin-tin- tin. It acted even better than humans. Later there were some films with a collie called Lassie. It looked as if the director could make Lassie act the way he wanted it to act. These dogs were like stars and they were paid like any other big actor. Their owners could easily get one lakh rupees from just one film.\n\n2. I saw how these animal actors were reverently treated when I went to the Disney Studio in Hollywood. The main character in this particular film was a large dog. When I went to the studio, the shooting had not started.\n\nPage – 44\n\nThe cameraman was getting the lights ready. It is usual for the actors to be present when the lights are arranged. This is to show the cameraman how they will walk, or where they will stand in a particular shot. In the case of big stars, this job is done by their stand-ins. A stand-in is usually physically similar to the star. The stars come when the lights are ready to take the shots.\n\n3. I saw some actors moving about in the set. On one side there was a large dog. The cameraman shouted to everyone to take their positions. The dog stayed where it was. This puzzled me. Was it not required in the next shot?\n\n4. Before I could ask someone, something strange happened. From nowhere, there appeared a little dwarf, followed by another man carrying a hairy dog skin. Then, to my surprise, the dwarf went down on all the fours on a chalk mark on the floor. The dog skin was draped over him. Then he crawled from one mark to another. The cameraman got busy with the lights. The dwarf was the dog’s stand-in!\n\nPage – 45\n\nEvery animal in a Hollywood film is well trained. It is easy to train horses and dogs. But in Hollywood there were even nearly a hundred trained ravens! Alfred Hitchcock, the creator of some qf the best suspense films, used them in his film ‘Birds’. Hitchcock wanted different kinds of birds. He needed many ravens. Advertisements were placed all over the USA, asking people to contact Hitchcock if they knew how to get trained ravens.\n\nHe got a response from a man soon. The man was asked to come with his birds. He came with nearly a hundred trained ravens. The ravens would not do many wonderful things. But if 50 ravens were asked to perch quietly in a row on a specified spot, they would do it immediately.\n\nIn India it is not easy to find trained animals. It is true that some films were made in Bombay and Madras using trained elephants, horses and tigers. Their performance showed that they just obeyed commands. In Bengal, it is possible to find clever dogs, particularly police dogs, that are very intelligent. If one is patient, we can use them nicely as I did with Bhulo in ‘Pather Panchali’.\n\nA dog might be difficult, not impossible, to handle. What is to be done if there is a need for a tiger in a film? When shooting the film ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’ (The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha), we had this problem. Goopy is banished by the king. Goopy wanders in the forest and meets Bagha who is also banished. They see a tiger and are terrified. But the tiger simply walks about in the forest without paying them any attention.\n\nPage – 46\n\nI decided to make this film. But the problem was how to find a tiger. The solution was to contact a circus as they have trained tigers. At that time Bharat Circus was giving shows in the Marcus Square in Calcutta. Its manager was a Tamilian. We went to meet him. He greeted us warmly and gave us South Indian coffee. When he came to know the reason for our visit, he called MrThorat, vi/ho was the ringmaster. He was also a South Indian, very strong, with features like a Nepali. He was about 40. He showed us a scar on his forearm. It was caused by a tiger.\n\nWe told him why we came. The shooting was at Shiuri in Birbhoom. We wanted to show a tiger in a thick bamboo grove. The tiger had to do only one simple thing. It had to come out of the bamboo grove into the open space, walk gently for a while, look at the camera if possible, and then go back. Could the tigerfrom Bharat Circus do it? Thorat said yes. The manager asked us how long we would need the tiger.\n\nI said only two hours forthe shooting and the additional time needed for travel. The travel would take about 2 days. The manager agreed to put the tiger in a cage and send it in a lorry. He then asked us to go and have a look at the tiger. I asked him if it would be okay to let the tiger out of the cage in the bamboo grove.\n\n11. Thorat was not sure. He said that he had never let the tiger out of the cage on his own. I was worried. We could not let the tiger be seen with the trainer in the film. How could Goopy and Bagha get frightened if the tiger is accompanied by a man? We could not allow that.\n\nPage – 47\n\n12. Thorat found a solution. He would tie a thin but strong wire round the tiger’s neck. If the wire was very thin, it would not be seen in the shot. But if the hair on the tiger’s neck was flattened by the wire, the wire would be seen. I suggested to get a collar made of tiger skin, fix the wire to this collar, and then tie it around the neck of the tiger.\n\n13. In a village named Notun Gram we found a suitable bamboo grove to shoot the first meeting between Goopy and Bagha and the tiger. Thorat came to the location with the tiger. There were some 25 people there. A few villagers took our permission to come and watch the shooting.\n\n14. The cage on the lorry was covered. When the cover was removed we saw two well-fed and strong tigers. Thorat said that he brought two because if one failed, the other could be used for the shot.\n\n15. The camera was placed on the tripod and it faced the bamboo grove. The audience was asked to be behind the camera so that they are far away from the tiger. We had to stay close to the bamboo grove. Goopy and Bagha had to be within yards of the camera. At least in one shot they should be seen with the tiger.\n\nPage – 48\n\n16. Thorat’s men had fixed a five foot iron rod to the ground. It was about 30 feet from the area where the tiger was to take a walk. They took a thin long wire and fixed one end to the tiger skin collar. The other end was tied to the rod. The door of one cage was opened and Thorat called out to the tiger. It responded quickly and jumped out of its cage to land on the open space. What followed was totally unexpected. We were all shocked and so was Thorat. Instead of walking calmly, the tiger started running around with great energy. It ran fast, jumped and rolled about, dragging the poor trainer with it. He was trying to control the tiger with the wire he held. But he was not succeeding. We all stood around foolishly, watching the free show! The camera was still on the tripod, facing the grove. The tiger was showing no sign of making its way there.\n\nPage – 49\n\n17. When the tiger calmed down, we took a few shots. But when we returned to Calcutta, we found that the camera had failed to record the scenes with the tiger. The shots were so dark that the tiger could not be seen distinctly from the trees and leaves. We had to reshoot the scenes again. We spoke to Thorat and he agreed to give us another chance. This time we found a bamboo grove in a village called Boral, near Calcutta. The lorry once again came with Thorat, the tiger, the steel wire, the special collar and the rod. The whole village came to see the shooting. We told the villagers to keep themselves at least 70 feet away from the scene of shooting. But nobody paid attention. The people came as close to the camera as they could. We had no time to explain and argue. We got the camera ready and signaled to Thorat.\n\n18. He opened the door of the cage. The tiger came out with a loud roar, and charged straight at the villagers. The crowd, some 150 people, melted away as if by magic. After that the tiger calmed down. Like an obedient child, it walked over to the spot we had chosen, paced about as it was required to do, and then went back to its trainer. The camera also behaved well and the scenes were properly shot.\n\nProject Tiger Summary in Malayalam"
