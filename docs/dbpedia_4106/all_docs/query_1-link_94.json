        "text": "The journey of a protagonist has always been an important motif across various genres of literature. Speculative Fiction, a term coined by famous American author Robert Heinlein, houses several genres like science fiction, fantasy, horror and detective. It often deals with plots that are sketched on the background of a place or world that are non-existent in the real world. It could be an undiscovered planet, a civilization underwater, a society embedded in deep space, a distant galaxy, or altogether in a different dimension. C.S. Lewis’ fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia is set in the world of Narnia; Tolkien built Middle Earth; and Rowling conjured an amalgamation of the wizarding world and muggle world. The trilogy of Dune by Frank Herbert is set on the barren planet Arrakis, while Isaac Asimov’s Foundation is set against the backdrop of the Galactic Empire. Satyajit Ray, an acclaimed Indian film director and author, penned several works of speculative fiction in Bangla, where Professor Shonku, the protagonist, embarks upon thrilling quests across various places in Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe. Professor Shonku also visits some places that cannot be traced in the real world. This current paper aims to trace the final frontiers, i.e., unknown and unchartered territories of Indian Speculative Fiction in Satyajit Ray’s seven stories about Professor Shonku, where the central character embarks across space and time, beneath the ocean, to different planets, and to some of the clandestine locations that do not exist on the geographical map of the world.\n\nThe contemporary debate in the philosophy of literature is strongly shaped by the anti-cognitivist challenge, according to which works of literary fiction (that contain propositions that are neither literally true nor affirmed by the author) cannot impart (relevant) knowledge to the readers or enrich their worldly understanding. Anti-cognitivists appreciate works of literary fiction for their aesthetic values and so risk to reduce them to mere ornaments that are entertaining, but eventually useless. Many philosophers have reacted to this challenge by pointing at ways in which works of literary fiction can be informative even though they lack worldly reference: it has been argued, for example, that works of fictions are thought experiments; that they add not to our theoretical knowledge, but to our know-how or to our phenomenal knowledge; or that that they help readers to understand the perspectives of others. A stubborn defense of literary cognitivism, however, risks to collapse into an instrumental understanding of literature. In my paper I suggest that both sides in the debate focus too narrowly on semantic features of the works in question that is tied to what I will call the \" referential picture \" of language. A shift perspective is needed: for one, we ought to fully appreciate that the term \" literature \" does not refer to a homogeneous phenomenon, but rather to a very heterogeneous and multifarious set of works that are read by many different readers for many different reasons in many different ways. Second, we need to understand that these works have in common much more than the semantic peculiarity of lacking worldly reference: they are a unique means of communication between authors and readers – and in particular the role of the latter is often neglected in contemporary debate. These two points should help us to get a more comprehensive understanding of the practice of literature and the vast range of values we can find works of literary fiction – and the interplay between them.\n\nChildren’s literature plays a significant role in their growth and development, and the shaping of their value system. India boasts of one of the oldest and richest traditions of children’s literature – be it the Panchatantra or the Jataka Tales or the Hitopadesa, not to mention the two great epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. These stories have been told and retold, written, reinterpreted and rewritten by generations of Indian story tellers. For years, Amar Chitra Katha popularized stories from Indian mythology through comic books. The other major genre that dominated Indian writing for children was moral stories. Each story was a lesson in ethics, and had a clear objective in mind. It ended with an overt and direct message that it wanted to convey to children to inculcate values of honesty, hard work, loyalty and righteousness. With lack of interesting reading material from India, Indian children turned to foreign authors like Enid Blyton for creating a fairy tale world of magic and fascinating boarding schools. The Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and Sherlock Holmes series quenched the thirst for mystery and adventure. The books transported children to a world very different from their own – one that they could enjoy but never identify with, because such books presented them with a culture that was a stark contrast to their own. The last few decades, however, have witnessed an experimentation with numerous contemporary themes, and an advent of publishers exclusively focusing on children’s books. It is ironic, because this is an age of digitization, and ostensibly that of decline in the reading habits of children which are gradually being replaced by gadgets like phones and tablets. Despite the threat from technology, there is a conscious movement to inculcate reading among children, creating for them a world that is fantastic, and yet often close to reality. This paper focuses on some of the lesser known books in Indian English writing for children, and explores new and contemporary themes that convey important lessons, but yet in a subtle and indirect manner. In some cases, the characters are children, but in other books, they are animals. Human qualities are projected on to animals, which ensures that the message is understated and restrained. Why are you Afraid to Hold my Hand by Sheila Dhir, published by Tulika books, deals with attitudes of people to children with disabilities, and the emotions of a disabled child who just wants to be accepted and not treated with sympathy. The Mouse with Seven Tails by Bapsi Sidhwa published by Pratham Books talks about peer pressure and the need for acceptance by one’s peers which often leads an individual to change his or her own personality in order to conform. Samaira’s Awful Lunch by Bharati Jagannathan, published again by Pratham Books, centres on the need to value, appreciate and respect the food we have been given. Vishv Books’ My Nose is Ugly by Bina Kapoor stresses the unique features of each individual, which make him or her distinct from others. It also deals with the concept of self-image and self-confidence. Another book by the same publication, Ma, Can I Help by Girija Rani Asthana, breaks gender stereotypes by projecting gender role equality within a family, where each member, regardless of sex, helps with the household chores. Fun Ok Please’s book Brown Like Dosas, Samosas and Sticky Chikky by Rebecca Manari, is a beautifully told story which challenges the Indian obsession with fair complexion, and defies the notion that fair is beautiful. The paper finally examines a short story entitled ‘The Missing Suitcase’ from my book Peek A Boo Manya, published by Omji Publication House. The story deals with valuing relationships over materialistic objects. Through an analysis of various books, the paper provides a comprehensive understanding of Indian children’s literature in English today. While publishers, authors and illustrators are working together to create meaningful books for children, the genre of children’s literature is still sadly not accorded the importance it deserves. Considering the fact that children’s literature lays the foundation for the thought process of an entire generation, the miniscule media coverage and critical thinking on children’s literature is indeed deplorable. More experts in the field need to come together to revolutionize the movement and spread awareness of the importance, need and variety of Indian children’s literature in the market today."
