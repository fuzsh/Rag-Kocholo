        "text": "The act of writing, owing to the permanence it craves, may be said to be in continuous interaction with the temporal flow of time. It continues to stimulate questions and open up avenues for discussion. Writing people, events and relationships into existence is a way of negotiating with the illusory. But writing falters. This paper attempts a reading of Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne in terms of power politics through the lens of the manipulation of written codes and inscriptions in the film. Identities and cultures are constructed through inscriptions and writings. But in the wrong hands, this medium of communication which has the potential to bring people together may wreck havoc on the social and political system. Writing, or the misuse of it, in the case of the film, reveals the nature of reality as provisional. If writing gives a seal of authenticity to a message, it can also become the casualty of its own creation. Key words: Inscription, Power, Politics, Writing, Social system\n\nThis article investigates the role of utopian and dystopian spaces in the construction of social realism in Bakita Byaktigato/The Rest is Personal (Pradipta Bhattacharya, 2013). The inherent contradiction between the implausible fictional construct of utopian and dystopian spaces and the existing socio-political reality is finely foregrounded through multiple loci of narrative actions. The film, based in Kolkata, revolves around Pramit, an aspiring documentary film-maker, and his quest for love. There are two spaces in the depiction of Kolkata: the city that contains the contemporary socio-political reality which is neither utopic or dystopic, and its dystopic underbelly that embodies the absence of hope for redemption or respite for its inhabitants. Pramit meets a fraudulent astrologer who occupies the dystopian space of ‘darkened shadows’ but knows about the utopian space that remains beyond his reach. The dystopian space is riddled with poverty, deprivation, unfulfilled desire, and hopelessness, along with fear and volatility. The final locus is a village called Mohini, a utopian space representing absolute harmony and undiluted bliss. Only the chosen ones have the privilege to enter the village. Everyone is happy in this space and prone to falling in love that lasts a lifetime. This is commemorative of arshinagar (‘the mirror city’), a coveted space in bāul practices and a metaphor for a utopian space that stands in stark contrast with the reality. By interweaving these spaces in his cinematic experimentation, Bhattacharya addresses issues such as folk-cultural practices and community, economic crises and class, caste hierarchy, and social relationships, while attempting to create an alternative cinematic language to counter the filmmaking practices in Bengal that rendered itself vestigial.\n\nThrough a close reading of the cinematic texts of Mahanagar and Golpo Holeo Satti, this essay explores the struggles of the historically underrepresented communities in a post-colonial Bengali society. As a manifestation of Third Cinema, Mahanagar is a transformative journey of Arati who exposes the societal tensions caused due to limited diversity, equity, and access. Dhanañjaẏa in Golpo Holeo Satti is a servant hero who bridges class divisions by hinging on the importance of hard work and fosters communal and cultural empathy. Both films collectively address gender, caste differences, and societal transformations, within the dysfunctional socio-cultural fabric of Calcutta in the 1960s.\n\nRealism depends upon a specific structure of experience for its intelligibility. That horizon is the metaphysical picture of the individual, with beliefs underlying his/her actions. What is the relationship between art which works through predominantly representational/mimetic forms (the novel, cinema and so on) and an experience which is structured on other metaphysical models? Taking the case of Indian cinema as an example, this essay argues that Indian cinema attempts to capture the essential predicament of modern Indian experience, the predicament of community disenfranchisement, using tools and resources which are not meant for this purpose. In order to understand the complex dynamics of this situation, it is important to develop a heuristic to 'provincialize' realism and representational forms of art. This paper argues that representational art and realism presupposes a particular conception of experience. This conception is one which privileges the propositional content of experience, a formulation which is also a cryptic description of the West as a culture. Representational art, therefore, is rooted in a metaphysics which has shaped that culture. Finding an alternative language to talk about non-western art forms will require us to explore alternatives to this metaphysics.\n\nThis essay will examine how the later films featuring or directed by Ghosh, with Arekti Premer Golpo (Just Another Love Story) onwards, oscillate and negotiate between two distinct narratives of (trans)gender identification, one based on a binary model of gender, and the other on a ternary model. The essay will argue that both these models are foundationally constituted through a class-/caste-restricted access to bourgeois modernity and enlightenment. The first model is of a woman in a (wrongly) male body, necessitating the external transition from ‘male’ to ‘female’ body. This model, corresponding to the biomedical discourse of transsexuality, has a relatively recent genealogy in the Bengali media and particularly in the much-publicized transition narratives of two trans women, Manobi Bandyopadhyay and Tista Das. In contra- distinction to this narrative, Ghosh draws on an older narrative of thirdness and gender liminality – in distinction from, rather than in transition between, both genders – which is often associated with hijras and kothis (‘third gender’ and ‘feminine’/‘effeminate’ persons assigned male at birth) in the ethnographic literature, but without making much reference to these communities. Ghosh establishes a double distanciation from working class/Dalit narratives of gender variance, and constructs a class-restricted script of gender choice and fluidity premised on bourgeois trajectories of modernization. This becomes particularly ironic and poignant in light of hir appropriation and celebration by both the middle class and working class/Dalit gender-variant communities to different ends; Ghosh’s posthumous gun salute and celebration by transgender/hijra/kothi communities accompanies the continuing, and perhaps increasing, criminalization, surveillance and pathologization of these communities.\n\nThe cinematic interventions of contemporary Dalit film-makers in India, Nagraj Manjule and Pa Ranjith, among others, represent modes of resistant historiography, employed by Dalits, against the aesthetic regime of stereotypical representation, through innovative techniques in visuals, sound, music, and cinematography. The paper attempts to evaluate and argue for an enabling anti-caste aesthetics articulated through an embodied sensibility in films. The paper argues that these film-makers not only disturb “the unconscious of caste” through an explicit anti-caste aesthetics but also produce affective, expressive archives. In other words, they bring into presence what was previously impossible through the processes of denunciation (of casteist images) and innovation (of anti-caste aesthetics)."
