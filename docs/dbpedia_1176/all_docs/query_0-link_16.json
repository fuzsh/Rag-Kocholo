These unpublished histories record experiences and provide insights into policies, decisions, implementing actions, and accomplishments of the United States Navy.\n\nThe collection is comprised of 175 numbered histories, bound in approximately 300 volumes. It includes narrative histories dealing with virtually every aspect of the administration of the naval establishment and the roles it played in contributing to victory during World War II. Some of the volumes also contain brief coverage of the pre-war beginnings and early histories of organizations and activities. The amount of information in these studies varies; some are extremely detailed, while others are more cursory in nature.\n\nThese administrative histories were one part of the Navy's effort to record its wartime experience. The first project was headed by Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) Samuel Eliot Morison, who early in 1942 was designated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox to prepare a history of naval operations. This led to the postwar publishing of the 15-volume History of United States Naval Operations in World War II (Boston, MA: Little, Brown, and Co., 1947-1962), the Navy's official history of World War II.\n\nThe second project was initiated after the President directed the establishment of a government-wide program, under the direction of the Bureau of the Budget, to document the administrative aspects of the war effort. In February 1943, Professor Robert G. Albion was charged with supervising the Navy's portion of that program, including oversight of the preparation of narrative summaries by the Offices of the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations, and by the various departmental bureaus.\n\nv\n\nThe Navy's historical endeavors were reorganized on 12 July 1944 when Admiral Edward C. Kalbfus, USN (Retired) was detached from the General Board and became Director of Naval History. His orders were to coordinate the various programs underway, including those of Professors Albion and Morison. Early in 1945, Admiral Kalbfus issued a series of directives relating to the writing of administrative histories. In one measure, he broadened the scope of the project beyond the Navy Department proper by requesting that major fleet and shore-based commands submit narratives of their wartime experiences. As a result, the United States Fleet, Pacific and Atlantic Fleets, sea frontiers, naval districts, and several independent commands were added to the program.\n\nAdmiral Kalbfus's Office of Naval History also provided guidance on the desired scope of the manuscripts, recommending that emphasis be given to such topics as policy formulation, the development of administrative structure, and relationships with other commands. Commanders also were urged to encourage their historians to consult the source materials maintained by the independent Office of Naval Records and Library in Washington that was under the direction of Kalbfus' deputy, Commodore Dudley W. Knox, USN (Retired). While some organizations utilized existing historical sections and personnel for the project, the Office of Naval History also assisted other commands in the assignment and orientation of a number of officers designated to perform historical duties.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the Office of Naval History began writing a single volume, based primarily on the administrative histories, that would provide a condensed analysis of the Navy Department's wartime experiences. After initial work by Professor Albion, the\n\nvi\n\nproject was undertaken by Rear Admiral Julius A. Furer, USN (Retired). In 1959, the Naval History Division completed Admiral Furer's 1,042-page volume titled Administration of the Navy Department in World War II (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1959).\n\nAs the title suggests, this comprehensive work focuses on the headquarters offices and bureaus which comprised the Navy Department. Coverage of the administration of the shore establishment and operating forces is limited to brief information of a background nature. Thus, the histories described in this guide provide an important supplement to the Furer volume.\n\nAlthough the documents described below represent the basic administrative histories of the Navy in World War II, the reader should be aware of other sources on the subject. Numerous subsidiary histories and unbound appendix materials were submitted as supplements to specific volumes in the series. That collection is held in the Operational Archives Branch of the Naval Historical Center. A description of the histories included in the group appears in Partial Checklist: World War II Histories and Reports in the Naval History Division (Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1973).\n\nExcept for the administrative histories, the majority of the Navy's unpublished original World War II-era records, including many of those once held by Office of Naval Records and Library (renamed the Naval Historical Center [now Naval History and Heritage Command]), are now located in various record groups at the National Archives in College Park, MD, and at regional branches of the National Archives, often within the records of the Naval Districts and Shore Establishments in Record Group 181.\n\nUse and Reproduction Policy\n\nOriginal US Naval Administrative Histories of World War II are unavailable for loan and must be consulted in the library. Reproduction of these manuscripts is permitted using a digital camera without flash. The use of personal scanners by non-library staff personnel must be approved by the reference staff on a document-by-document basis (Reference: Naval Historical Center Instruction [NAVHISTCENTINST] 5070.1C.). When requesting an administrative history, please specify its number. For example: \"I'd like to examine World War Two Admin.

Washington, n.d. 1,630 pp., appendices.\n\nThe two narrative volumes of this history discuss the Navy's employment of civilian manpower from 1940 to 1945. Several aspects of the program are examined, including its organization and extent. Efforts to resolve the numerous problems involved in the procurement, training, and assignment of the large number of new employees resulting from rapid wartime expansion, also are treated at length. Major emphasis is devoted to utilization of civilians at shore establishments in the United States, although one chapter considers the placement of these workers at offshore bases. The extensive volume of appendices contains such source materials as organization charts, letters, memoranda, and reports.\n\nMost of this history was written by Captain Samuel H. Ordway, Jr., USNR, who also performed the duties of overall editor. Other sections were drafted by Lieutenants James C. George, USNR, and Daniel R. Howe, USNR; Commanders Frank Cushman, USNR, and H. Lee White, USNR; and Captain John Craig, USNR.\n\nPage 1\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"Office of Procurement and Material: Industrial Mobilization.\" 2 vols. Washington. n.d.\n\nThis volume is a series of thirty-eight memoranda and accompanying documents that provide brief summaries of various aspects of the Navy's role in the wartime mobilization of industrial production. The first few memoranda concern the relationship of the Navy to the functions of the War Production Board. The remaining memoranda discuss the Navy's involvement in obtaining essential raw materials, including carbon, copper, and rubber, as well as the procurement of a myriad of finished products. Attached charts, graphs, and orders furnish supplementary data.\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"Office of Procurement and Material: Planning and Statistics Branch.\" 4 vols. Washington, 1945. Appendices.\n\nFollowing an explanation of its origins and organization, the branch's activities from establishment in early 1942 until dissolution in February 1945 are detailed. Among those activities were the development of centralized and uniform accounting systems; the establishment of controls over procurement schedules, raw materials, and inventories; and the analysis of the status and progress of such programs. A lengthy discussion is devoted to the branch's assistance to the Navy Department's bureaus, the Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard in developing similar programs. Its role as the central issuing authority for statistical information to the War Production board and other agencies also is examined.\n\nThree appendices are mentioned in the table of contents of the narrative volume. However, only Appendix B is included. It appears in three\n\n2\n\nvolumes and comprises important memoranda, letters, directives, and reports on procurement and material programs.\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"Office of Procurement and Material: Production Branch.\" 4 vols. Washington, 1945, 199 pp.\n\nDerived from an earlier analysis of the Production Branch's wartime activities, this study covers the period from 31 January 1942 to 31 January 1945. A case history approach is used to discuss the branch's varied duties, including its effort to coordinate and insure production of materials essential to the Navy's operation and the allocation of those materials in order to avoid deficiencies and promote conservation.\n\nEach case history examines specific raw materials such as steel, copper, and aluminum, or finished products such as electronics equipment. Introductory sections describe the organization of the branch, its personnel, and personnel procedures. The branch's liaison activity with the War Production Board is an important topic considered throughout the volume. The analysis that served as a basis for this history was prepared by a group of naval officers under the coordination of Lieutenant Commander L. Rohe Walker, USNR.\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"Office of Procurement and Material: Procurement Branch, Finance.\" 1 vol. Washington, 1946. 35 pp. appendices.\n\nAn introductory narrative provides a brief history of the Finance Division of the Procurement Branch during the period from May 1942 to August 1945. The history concentrates on the\n\n3\n\ndivision's program of extending government credit through war production loans authorized by Executive Order No. 9112. The development of the numerous policies and procedures involved in the loan program also is discussed. A roster of Finance Division personnel follows the narrative.\n\nAt the beginning of the extensive appendices, the location of the documentary material referred to in the footnotes to the narrative is outlined in a short bibliography. Much of this source material, directives, memoranda, and reports, is included in the remaining appendices.\n\nThe author of the narrative was Lieutenant Commander Theodore Chase, USNR.\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"Office of Procurement and Material: Coordination of Material Procurement.\" 7 vols. Washington. n.d.\n\nThese volumes contain compilations of source material related to the diverse functions of the Office of Procurement and Material. Memoranda, orders, charts, photographs, and published items pertaining to such activities as procurement, production, inventory control, and inspection administration are among the numerous documents included. Narrative sections are not included in the volumes.\n\nOffice of the Under Secretary of the Navy, \"History of Navy Department Renegotiation.\" 5 vols. Washington, 1947. Appendices.\n\nVolume I of this series is divided into three parts. The first provides a brief historical summary of American efforts to control\n\n4\n\nexcessive profits on war contracts. Also discussed are the provisions of renegotiation legislation and criticism of this legislation by opponents. The organization, procedures, and personnel of the Navy Price Adjustment Board, the office responsible for renegotiation activity, is the subject of Part II. Part III sets forth various observations concerning statutory, organizational, and operational aspects of renegotiation, and contains suggestions for similar efforts in the future.\n\nThe Price Adjustment Board's method of processing cases is reviewed in Volume II. Also included is a detailed examination of the organization and functions of the divisions of the board. This treatment, as well as a section on the personnel of the board, provides more thorough coverage of subjects found in Part II of the first volume. Volume II contains extensive statistics relating to the board's activities. Among this material are eighty-six tables and seven charts.\n\nTwo volumes of appendices, one each for Volumes I and II, accompany the set. Numerous administrative, procedural, and legal memoranda referred to in the narrative are included in the appendices, along with copies of several manuals on such subjects as the renegotiation of construction contracts. The author of the history was Robert J.H. Powel, Special Assistant to the Under Secretary of the Navy.\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"Administrative History, Office of Research and Inventions, 1 July-31 December 1945.\" Washington, 1948. 196 pp., appendices.\n\nThis volume opens with a brief summary of the establishment of the Office of Research and Inventions in May 1945. The new office included the Naval Research Laboratory, the Office of\n\n5\n\nPatents and Inventions, the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development, and the Special Devices Division of the Bureau of Aeronautics. Following an outline of the office's basic policies and structure, the remainder of the narrative examines the activities and historical origins of all the divisions except that of the Research Laboratory.\n\nThe narrative is followed by a series of nineteen appendices that include copies of key directives, short biographies of important personnel, pertinent general orders, and selected reports. A copy of Rear Admiral Julius A. Furer's administrative history of the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development and a catalogue of training devices also are located in the appendices. The authors of the volume were Lieutenants (junior grade) Donald Jackson, USNR, and Louise Herring.\n\nExecutive Office of the Secretary of the Navy, \"History of the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development from 12 July 1941 to 19 May 1945.\" Washington, 1945. 28 pp., appendices.\n\nThis history discusses the origin and development of scientific research in the Navy, the establishment of the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development in 1941, its relationship to other offices and agencies, and the office's internal organization. Particular attention is given to an explanation of the policies and procedures that were developed by the office during World War II.\n\nAppendices include organization flow charts, biographical sketches of key personnel, and descriptions of major projects undertaken by the office. The author, Rear Admiral Julius A. Furer, USN, served as Coordinator of Research and Development from 13 December 1941 to 19 May 1945.\n\n6\n\nAn October 1961 addendum prepared by him has been added at the beginning of the narrative.\n\nCommander, in Chief, United States Fleet\n\nCommander in Chief, United States Fleet, \"Headquarters.\" Washington, 1946. 178 pp., appendices.\n\nThis history discusses the organization and administration of Headquarters, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (COMINCH). The narrative begins with a chapter tracing the evolution of COMINCH from December 1941 to its disestablishment in October 1945. The ensuing chapters deal with the functions of the divisions responsible for plans, operations, readiness, and combat intelligence. The two final chapters briefly describe the activities of the Tenth Fleet and the Office of the Naval Inspector General.\n\nIn addition to the considerable number of documents reprinted in the narrative section, the nineteen appendices contain copies of important executive orders, letters, and memoranda outlining the functions and organization of COMINCH headquarters. Three organizational charts and several rosters of officers, issued periodically throughout the war, also are included in this section. The author of the history was Commander Walter Muir Whitehill, USNR.\n\n7\n\nCommander in Chief, United States Fleet, \"Convoy and Routing.\" Washington, 1945. 147 pp., appendices.\n\nThe administration of the Convoy and Routing Section of the Tenth Fleet is the subject of this volume. The section's administrative evolution and its mission of insuring the safe movement of merchant ships and troops transports are outlined in Chapter One. A lengthy discussion of the aid given to ships sailing independently and to ships in convoys follows. The narrative details the procedures and policies devised to protect merchantmen from enemy submarine attack. Procedures for avoiding and minimizing other navigational dangers also are related. The discussion of convoys focuses primarily in the North Atlantic, although a few remarks pertain to similar activity in the Pacific. A short concluding chapter summarizes the overall effort of the Convoy and Routing Section.\n\nEighty pages of appendices contain numerous tables, graphs, and photographs. Also included are lists of abbreviations, sources, and officers of the section. The only author identified is Commander George P. Markoff, USNR, who prepared the chapter dealing with communications systems used to report ship movements.\n\nCommander in Chief, United States Fleet, \"Office of the Inspector General.\" Washington, 1945. 15 pp., appendices.\n\nThe greater part of this manuscript consists of documentary material. In a short introductory narrative there is a description of the establishment of the Office of the Inspector General in May 1942 and its duties of inquiring into and reporting upon any matter affecting the efficiency and economy of the naval service. Besides comparing the office to that of the Inspector General of the Army, the narrative\n\n8\n\nalso surveys the evolution of inspection activities throughout the history of the Navy Department. The latter subject is developed more fully in a lengthy history located among the appendices that details such efforts from the formal establishment of the Navy Department in 1798 to the eve of World War II.\n\nThe other appendices contain considerable documentation regarding recommendations for the establishment of an Inspector General, advice received from the Army Inspector General, and tentative guidelines for inspection procedures. Key directives which established the office, and a lengthy 1944 memorandum that includes a summary of all naval inspection activities at the time, comprise the remaining appendices.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Army-Navy Petroleum Board and Petroleum and Tanker Division (CNO).\" 4 vols. Washington, n.d. 299 pp., appendices.\n\nThe narrative volume of this set is divided into three parts. Part I deals with the Army-Navy Petroleum Board; Part II treats the Petroleum and Tanker Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations; and a very brief third part discusses the Allied Tanker Coordinating Committee.\n\nThe efforts of the Petroleum Board to coordinate the procurement, storage, and shipping of petroleum products by the Navy and the Army are examined in Part I. After outlining the organization of the board and the functions of area petroleum officers, the narrative continues with a series of chapters explaining the particular activities of the working sections of the board.\n\n9\n\nA final chapter evaluates the board's policy-making function.\n\nThe approach used in Part II differs slightly from that of Part I. Although both the organization and functions of the Petroleum and Tanker Division are discussed, the major emphasis is on the problems dealt with during World War II. Among these was the task of maximizing the efficient operation of the ships used to transport petroleum.\n\nThe final part of the narrative briefly describes the composition and purpose of two Allied Tanker Coordinating Committees located in Washington and London. Also noted are the general policies developed by the committee. A glossary of abbreviations and a subject index follow the narrative.\n\nThe appendices to the history are divided into three volumes. The first contains a group of sixty-two general documents. Among these are directives, letters and memoranda, as well as statistical tables, rosters of officers, and minutes of selected meetings. Of particular value is a ten-page capsule history of the functions and operations of the Army-Navy Petroleum Board. Volume II of the appendices is a lengthy analysis by L.W. Harford of the British Ministry of Fuel and Power entitled \"A Review of Petroleum Supply - North Africa Theater 1942-1943.\" Copies of monthly reports of the Army-Navy Petroleum Board from December 1944 to July 1945 are included in the third volume of appendices.\n\nThe author of most of the narrative and the overall editor was Captain Alfred F. Loomis, USNR, who was assisted by Lieutenant Bernard McKenna, USNR. Additional chapters were written by Lieutenant V.P. Selph, (SC) USNR, and Lieutenant Colonel D.M.S. Langworthy of the British Army.\n\n10\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Internal Security and Passive Defense.\" Washington, n.d. 56 pp.\n\nThis history discusses the work of the Internal Security Section of the Base Maintenance Division. The section was responsible for safeguarding private facilities, particularly shipyards, with which the Navy contracted for ship construction and other work. These duties required the development of security policies and procedures, and coordination with other naval and non-naval organizations interested in the protection of private maritime installations. Such agencies included the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maritime Commission, and Army Provost Marshal, the Office of Naval Intelligence, and the Bureau of Yards and Docks. Three case histories are presented in this narrative to illustrate the actual functioning of the Internal Security Section.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Mine Warfare in the Naval Establishment.\" Washington, n.d. 230 pp.\n\nAfter a brief discussion of the Navy's development of mine warfare from 1918 to 1938, this volume concentrates on the history of the Mine Warfare Section of the Base Maintenance Division during World War II. The major responsibilities of the section were research and development of mine warfare weapons, coordinating the production of such devices, and general supervision of mine warfare personnel. In addition, the section was concerned with the preparation of operational plans, the development of mine warfare countermeasures, and the collection and dissemination of information pertaining to both weapons and countermeasures.\n\nThe narrative is divided into three basic parts. The first consists of an introductory\n\n11\n\nchapter discussing the status of mine warfare in the Navy from 1918 to 1938, while the second focuses on developments in mine warfare organization and administration during the war years. The final part deals with operational activities of the section during the war.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Naval Communications.\" Washington, 1948. 370 pp., appendix.\n\nAfter tracing briefly the evolution of naval communications from the creation of the Naval Radio Service in 1912, this volume focuses on the administrative history of the Division of Naval Communications from 1939 to the end of World War II. During this period, the division, which had cognizance over radio, telegraph, and telephone communications, experienced considerable expansion and underwent various organizational changes.\n\nThe operation of several offices within the division receive detailed examination. Among these are the shore section, with responsibilities for communications originating on shore; the fleet section; and the aeronautical section, which handled aircraft and air base communications and facilities. Also treated is the registered publications section that maintained and distributed certain secret and confidential publications in addition to operating a mail and courier service.\n\nThe appendix consists of a history of the Naval Teletypewriter System (NTX) during the war. The volume also includes several charts and plates as well as an index.\n\n12\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"The Control of Naval Logistics.\" Washington, n.d. 170 pp., appendix.\n\nDuring World War II, the Office of the Assistant Chief of Naval Operations (Material) underwent various changes in title, organization, and responsibility. Despite these changes, all of which are outlined in the history, the office had continuing responsibility for the execution of material plans. In performing this logistics function, the office had authority over several components of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, including Fleet Maintenance, Electronics, Naval Transportation, and the Progress Sections.\n\nMost of this narrative concentrates on the administration and activities of the Progress Section, which was created in November 1942 to aid in the processing, scheduling, and coordination of logistics plans and to monitor the execution of the plans. The final chapter evaluates several general problems confronted during the war years and officers recommendations for the management of the office in future crises.\n\nA lengthy appendix includes copies of key directives, memoranda, and periodic statements of mission. Several lists of projects monitored by the Progress Section and assignment of its personnel also are located in this section.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Aspects of Logistics Planning.\" Washington, n.d. 206 pp.\n\nThe Logistics Plans Division was a central agency concerned with planning and organizing naval logistics support in World War II. After a lengthy introduction tracing the history of planning within the Navy from the time of\n\n13\n\nAlfred Thayer Mahan, this narrative outlines the administrative structure and duties of the office after its establishment in December 1942. The ensuing discussion details the division's activities during 1943 and early 1944, an especially busy period. In April 1944, some of its duties were assumed by the Logistics Planning Unit of the Office of the Chief of naval Operations. A final chapter evaluates the overall accomplishments of the office.\n\nThe bibliography in Duncan S. Ballantine's U.S. Naval Logistics in the Second World War identifies the authors of this history as Lieutenant Myron P. Gilmore, USNR, and Lieutenant J. Blum, USNR.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"The Evolution of the Lend-Lease Office of Record.\" Washington, n.d. 53 pp.\n\nAccording to the introduction, this volume describes \"the Navy's interest...in allocation to foreign governments of naval munitions.\" The discussion begins by noting origins of this office in the period prior to the Lend-Lease Act, when the Navy participated in negotiations concerning foreign contracts for naval material. Part II of the narrative examines the period during which the office became the Navy's major procurement agency for the naval equipment provided foreign governments under lend-lease agreements. After the nation's entry into war, the office's role increased as it became responsible not only for procurement but also for the final assignment of naval munitions to the various Allies. This latter subject is reviewed in the final section of the history.\n\n14\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"The Logistics of Fleet Readiness: The Fleet Maintenance Division in World War II.\" Washington, n.d. 178 pp., appendices.\n\nDuring World War II, the Fleet Maintenance Division was responsible for coordinating construction, repair, and disposal of the Navy's vessels. To achieve coordination, the division worked closely with other divisions within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, the material bureaus in the Navy Department, and other entities engaged in naval logistics.\n\nBefore examining the division's wartime responsibilities, the history traces the evolution of the fleet maintenance function from the creation of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in 1915. The narrative that follows deals with such activities as the division's shipbuilding and alteration program. A separate chapter focuses on the process involved in scheduling the availability of naval ships so that the Navy was assured of the greatest possible strength afloat. Other chapters consider the division's efforts to maintain submarines and amphibious vessels. Administration of ship decommissioning and disposal is discussed in the final chapter.\n\nThe two appendices consist of organizational charts representing the various sections of the division and depicting their duties.\n\nDuncan S. Ballantine notes in U.S. Naval Logistics in the Second World War that the author of the history was Lieutenant (junior grade) William C. Askew, USNR.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"The Logistics of Advance Bases.\" Washington, n.d. 196 pp., appendices.\n\n15\n\nThis history describes the efforts of the Base Maintenance Division in planning and coordinating logistics support for the establishment of new overseas naval bases. Beginning with an evaluation of the prewar need for more naval facilities, the narrative covers the period from 1936 through the end of the war. Activities related to base construction in the Pacific receive considerable attention, although one chapter, \"Internal Organization of Op-30,\" presents a thorough discussion of the administrative structure of the division.\n\nAppendices include copies of several shipment schedules, representative memoranda, and several charts. According to Duncan S. Ballantine's U.S. Naval Logistics in the Second World War, the author of this volume was Lieutenant John H. Gleason, USNR.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Procurement Organization under the Chief of Naval Operations: The History of Op-24.\" Washington, n.d. 58 pp., appendix, index.\n\nThe Materials Division existed as a distinct organization within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations for less than three months, from 27 October 1941 to 30 January 1942. Its responsibility was to work with other government agencies in planning industrial mobilization, and to coordinate the procurement, stockpiling, conservation, and allocation of materials essential to the Navy. In addition to reviewing the reasons for the division's establishment and its activities, this volume briefly analyzes attempts by the military, dating from the World War I period, to plan procurement and allocation of raw materials. The latter discussion includes a brief history of the Army and Navy Munitions Board during the interwar years.\n\n16\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Technical Mission in Europe.\" Washington, 1945. 279 pp., appendix.\n\nEstablished on 26 December 1944, the Naval Technical Mission in Europe was assigned the duty of collecting German scientific and technical information for use by the Navy's technical bureaus and the Coordinator of Research Development. The mission was activated on 20 January 1945 and was decommissioned, upon completion of its assignment, on 1 November 1945. During the nine months of its existence, a massive amount of information was compiled and transmitted to Washington in approximately 240 letter reports and 350 technical reports.\n\nAfter providing a brief summary of the mission, the narrative focuses on its internal organization while in Europe. This discussion is followed by an examination of the mission's relations with various commands, including U.S. and British naval activities and the Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force. The methods and procedures used in preparing reports, in handling captured enemy documents and equipment, and in dealing with captured German personnel are treated. A summary reviewing the deficiencies and strengths of the mission concludes the narrative.\n\nIn addition to the extensive appendix, the volume contains rosters of both naval and civilian personnel associated with the mission and a list of the reports that they prepared. The appendix provides copies of important letters and memoranda. Several graphs showing the progress of the mission also are included.\n\nOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations, \"Office of Naval Intelligence.\" 4 vols. Washington, n.d. 1,510 pp., appendices.\n\n19\n\nCreated in 1882, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had numerous responsibilities throughout its existence. Among the most important was the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information concerning the naval policies and activities of all countries.\n\nONI's history through 1945 is traced in three textual volumes. The narrative begins by discussing creation of the office and its general evolution to 1939. A more lengthy description of its organizational development and expanded activities during 1939-1945 follows. The remaining fourteen chapters detail the evolution, duties, and administration of each of the office's branches. Among the branches treated is the Office of Naval Records and Library, a predecessor of the Naval History Division.\n\nA supplementary volume contains extensive appendices. Among these are copies of important memoranda, several reports, and a number of organizational charts. A few lists of publications and rosters of personnel are included.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air)\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Aviation in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.\" Washington, n.d. 134 pp.\n\nThe establishment in 1943 of the Office of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air) and its wartime evolution are examined in this brief history. The narrative also traces prewar and early wartime aviation programs. The history focuses on the development of naval aviation\n\n20\n\npolicy. Among specific topics treated are the views of naval bureaus regarding aviation organization and the influence of public opinion on the reorganization of naval aviation. The impact of a study, undertaken by Admiral H.E. Yarnell, USN, to determine the attitudes of naval officers regarding naval air power also is analyzed.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"History of Naval Aviation.\" Vol. III: \"1898-1917,\" Vol. IV: \"1917-1918,\" Vol. V: \"1918-1926,\" Vol. VI: \"1926-1939.\" Washington, 1946. 1,438 pp.\n\nDivided into four volumes, this history traces the evolution of naval aviation from the days of early experimentation to the eve of America's entry into World War II. The first volume focuses on the period before World War I, while the second examines the organization and administration of aviation activities and facilities during the war. The interwar years are treated in the last two volumes, with detailed discussions devoted to such topics as the creation of the Bureau of Aeronautics, the General Billy Mitchell controversy, the Morrow Board, Army-Navy relations regarding aviation, and preparedness efforts prior to World War II.\n\nThese volumes are well-documented with numerous footnotes. A helpful bibliographical essay appears at the end of the fourth volume. The author of the history was Lieutenant Commander Clifford L. Lord, USNR. A shorter version of this work, written by Lord and Archibald D. Turnbull, was published by the Yale University Press in 1949 under the title History of United States Naval Aviation.\n\n21\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"The Navy's Air War: Mission Completed.\" Vol. VII Washington, 1946. 594 pp., appendices.\n\nCoverage of both combat and administrative aspects of naval air power during the war years is presented in this concise history. The volume initially considers the development of naval aviation during the first three decades of the twentieth century and the organization of the air arm in World War II. The narrative then turns to a review of air operations in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.\n\nThe remaining chapters are devoted to logistical matters. Such topics as training, aircraft production, expansion of the shore establishment, the role of the Naval Air Transportation Service, and scientific contributions to aviation are discussed in turn.\n\nTwo appendices provide a list of aircraft designations and a chronology of important events. The volume was edited by Lieutenant A.R. Buchanan, USNR. This work subsequently was published in 1946 by Harer and Brothers.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Financial and Legislative Planning, 1911-1945.\" Vols. VIII-IX Washington, 1946. 547 pp.\n\nDivided into two volumes, one for 1911 to 1933 and the other for 1934 to 1945, this work summarizes the history of financial and legislative planning activities pertaining to naval aviation. Organized chronologically with a section for each fiscal year, the discussion covers both preparation of financial estimates for submission to Congress and the administration of funds appropriated annually by that body. The analysis is based primarily on the\n\n22\n\npoints brought out in official testimony before the House Naval Affairs Committee and Appropriations Committee and in various Senate hearings. Plans that were implemented as a result of congressional funding, as well as those that were curtailed or postponed due to the level of appropriations, are examined.\n\nThe text includes excerpts from many key documents and is footnoted. Several charts also are located in the text. Lieutenant Charles F. Stanwood, USNR, was the author of the work.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Aviation Planning.\" Vol. X Washington, n.d. 252 pp., appendices.\n\nFor the most part, the focus of this volume is on the duties and work of the Program Planning Section and the Programs and Allocations Section of the Aviation Planning Division. The primary responsibility of these sections was the planning of aviation procurement and aviation manpower programs.\n\nInstead of adhering to a strictly chronological sequence, this narrative follows a topical organization. Among the topics presented is an explanation of the planning process itself, which is defined as \"the methods and techniques...devised by staff planners to keep their analyses systematic and realistic, rather than random and based on guesswork....\" About two-thirds of the volume is composed of a series of twenty-five exhibits, including memoranda, reports, and instructions.\n\n23\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Aviation Shore Establishments, 1911-1945.\" Vol. XI. Washington, n.d. 497 pp., appendices.\n\nThe first of the two parts in this volume provides an extensive history of the naval aviation shore establishment between 1911 and 1938. In addition to examining the development of base complexes, the narrative notes the operational and logistical considerations that were instrumental in the establishment of each station. The effect of the submarine and the influence of America's allies on the establishment of North American and European bases during World War I are analyzed. The expansion of aviation facilities during that conflict, as well as the rapid postwar reduction of operational bases, is traced. Details are included on costs of construction, maintenance, and operation of the bases. The history also covers Marine Corps air facilities. An excellent bibliography follows the narrative.\n\nThe period from 1938 to 1945 is considered in a more limited manner in the second part of the volume. Among the topics dealt with are the building of new air stations and the expansion of existing air facilities. The development of the Naval Air Station at Quonset Point, Rhode Island is explored as a case study. The appendix to this part contains copies of a number of basic planning documents.\n\nLieutenant Ivor D. Spencer, USNR, was the author of the first part, and Lieutenant Donald M. Forester, USNR, prepared the second section.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Aviation Training, 1911-1939.\" Vol. XIII Washington, n.d. 321 pp.\n\n24\n\nFollowing an opening chapter describing the training available to naval aviators to the end of World War I, this chronological narrative devotes two chapters to the first part of the interwar period. The final chapter discusses events during the years from 1934 to 1939, which was a period of considerable expansion for naval aviation. Because of this expansion, the development of more extensive training programs became necessary. Among the numerous topics covered in each chapter are the training programs for both officers and enlisted personnel, the type of training provided, and the programs available at various facilities, including the Naval Academy and the Naval Air Stations at Hampton Roads, San Diego, and Pensacola.\n\nThe author of Chapter I of the volume was Lieutenant Commander Clifford L. Lord, USNR, while the other chapters were prepared by Lieutenant (junior grade) George M. Fennemore, USNR. Both authors document their work with extensive footnotes. Lieutenant Fennemore presents commentaries on his sources at the end of each chapter.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Aviation Training, 1940-1945.\" Vol. XIV. Washington, n.d. 258 pp.\n\nThe second volume of the series on aviation training is a collection of individual studies of various facets of the World War II program. The first focuses on the administration of the wartime air training program. Such aspects as organizational developments, supervision of aviation technical schools, and the establishment of the Naval Air Training Command are discussed.\n\n25\n\nSome of the remaining studies are more narrow in scope. These include an outline of the achievement testing program used in training pilots and an account of the special training devices program. Basic technical training for inexperienced personnel is another subject covered. A comprehensive summary of Marine aviation training is presented in the final paper.\n\nSeveral authors prepared these studies. Lieutenant (junior grade) George M. Fennemore, USNR, was the author of the first three. The fourth was contributed by Lieutenant Commander Moreau B. Chambers, USNR, while the final study was written by First Lieutenant Ann F. Vaupel, USMC (WR).\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"The Civil Aeronautics Administration-War Training Service (Navy) Flight Training Program.\" Vol. XV. Washington, n.d. 75 pp., appendices.\n\nThe Navy's utilization of the pilot training program of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (earlier known as the Civil Aeronautics Authority) is described in this volume. The CAA program of aviation training in colleges, universities, and flying schools throughout the country, as well as the effort to produce military pilots within the agency's existing civilian administration system, is discussed in the first chapter. The increased demand for military pilots within the agency's existing civilian administration system, is discussed in the first chapter. The increased demand for military pilots necessitated considerable expansion of this program between 1939 and 1944.\n\nChapter II examines the Navy's part in coordinating the project and evaluates the attempt to restructure civilian pilot training to meet the particular needs of naval aviation. The use of CAA facilities from 1942 to 1944 for\n\n26\n\nthe Navy's program of reducing the time needed for flight training is focused on in the third chapter. Chapter IV is devoted to problems encountered in the assignment of naval personnel, standardization of training requirements, supervision and inspection of training activities, and the loss of civilian instructors.\n\nThe appendices contain several statistical tables related to cost, manpower usage, and the number of individuals trained.\n\nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), \"Aviation in the Fleet Exercises, 1911-1939.\" Vol. XVI.
