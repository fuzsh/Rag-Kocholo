        "text": "Yesterday I visited the Cambridge American Cemetery, the only American WWII cemetery in the United Kingdom. It’s a pretty little cemetery in a peaceful setting in the outskirts of Cambridge. In this cemetery are buried 3,812 American war dead, primarily from the US Navy and the US Army Air Corps. Also memorialized here on the Wall of the Missing are an additional 5,127 Missing in Action. Among those remembered here are 24 Unknowns, one set of brothers and a brother-sister.\n\nAs I walked through the Visitors Center I was struck by the individual stories of many of the men buried or memorialized in the cemetery. It brought to mind the Soldier’s Creed and I mentally began placing the names under the different tenets.\n\n· I will always place the mission first: On January 3, 1943, Technical Sergeant Arizona Harris, US Army Air Corps, served as a Top Turret Gunner on a B-17 Heavy Bomber during a raid over St. Nazaire, France. On the return flight, his aircraft, Sons of Fury, was crippled by flack and fell behind the other bombers. The Sons of Fury was relentlessly pursued by German fighters and forced to ditch in the English Channel. TSGT Harris maintained his position and continued firing, providing cover for other crew who had escaped the aircraft, until the Sons of Fury sank below the water. On September 21, 2018, which would have been Harris’ 100th birthday, President Trump posthumously awarded TSGT Arizona Harris the Distinguished Service Cross. His name is listed on the Wall of the Missing.\n\n· I will never accept defeat: In anticipation of the D-Day landings, Lt Colonel Leon Vance, US Army Air Corps, was assigned to the lead bomber against German coastal defenses in France on June 5, 1944. Due to the bad weather and poor visibility, the lead aircraft was required to become the pathfinder in order for the group to use “blind bombing” tactics. On the second pass over the target area, Vance’s aircraft came under intense anti-aircraft fire and sustained heavy damage. Three of the four engines were disabled and the fuel lines were ruptured. Shrapnel from an explosion killed the pilot and seriously wounded the co-pilot and LTC Vance. Once over the English Channel, Vance order the crew to bail out. He assumed control of the craft from a prone position due to his foot being almost severed and trapped by dislodged plane parts. Leon Vance survived the impact of the plane hitting the water and was jolted loose from the wreckage by the ensuing explosion. The following month, the aircraft returning him to the United States for medical treatment disappeared over the North Atlantic between Greenland and Newfoundland. LTC Leon Vance was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic acts on June 5th. His name is listed on the Wall of the Missing.\n\n· I will never quit: Early in the war, Lieutenant Damon Gause, US Army Air Corps, and a fellow prisoner of war executed the most daring and successful escape of WWII. The saga began with LT Gause overpowering his guard at Baatan and swimming three miles to safety, only to be re-captured. With fellow POW Captain Lloyd Osborne, he escaped his captors at Corregidor and disappeared into the jungle. With the help of Filipino citizens, the two men acquired a small dilapidated fishing boat and sailed 3,200 miles through enemy-controlled ocean to freedom, reaching Australia on October 11, 1942. After returning home, he volunteered to serve again. Major Gause flew several missions over Europe but died in March 1944 in a plane crash in England. His military awards include the Distinguished Service Cross.\n\n· I will never leave a fallen comrade: Lieutenant Murray Blum, US Merchant Marine, was serving as chief radio operator onboard the merchant ship SS Leonidas when, in the darkness of December 3, 1943, the Leonidas rammed into a small Dutch ship. As the smaller ship broke apart and sank, the men from the Leonidas launched life rafts to rescue them. Murray Blum, with a reputation of helping people, heard voices calling for help from the opposite direction from which the lifeboats were heading. Unhesitatingly, he leapt overboard and swam towards the struggling sailors. After saving the lives of two of the men, LT Blum lost his own life looking for more victims in the freezing water. Three weeks later his body washed up on the shores of Scotland. LT Murray Blum was posthumously awarded the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nThese stories, and the others like them, remind us all of the courage and commitment, and the selfless service and sacrifice of the young men and women in our military. To all our military veterans, past and present, I thank you for your service."
