        "text": "Spotlight on Bandleader Frank Rosato\n\nFrank Rosato, trumpeter from New Orleans, Louisiana was referred to as “old man” at thirty years old by the younger band he commanded, the military band of the 156th Infantry Regiment, the Louisiana National Guard. Rosato’s band had been performing in London for years, even before the Royal Family, and were prepared to be sent home after V-E Day, but they delayed that event when asked to perform at the Potsdam Conference, the Allied summit conference from 17 July – 2 August 1945. Following the conference, the band headed after Truman to Berlin and played the National Anthem as the flag was raised over US Headquarters. The very same flag had flown over the Capitol during Pearl Harbor and the US declaration of war. The flag referred to as the Flag of Liberation had been raised over the vanquished Axis capitals. Soon it would fly over Tokyo. Rosato said that even beyond Potsdam, the highpoint of his career was playing the Star Spangled Banner in Berlin. He said, “When I directed the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ that day my hair stood straight up. Oh yes. That was a very, very strong feeling. I was very, very satisfied. Proud. Yes, indeed. I felt the heartbeat of everybody in the band. It was a very solemn occasion when that flag went up. I don’t think that we ever played the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ any better.” Rosata’s story can be read in War Stories: Remembering World War II by Elizabeth Mullener.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Frank Rosato.

Parks presented the Flag of Liberation to President Harry S. Truman in Berlin, Germany. President Truman is in Germany to attend the Potsdam Conference. The Flag of Liberation flew over the capitols of the axis powers. 23 July 1945.\n\nSpotlight on Merchant Seaman Murray Blum\n\nLt. Murray Blum served with the United States Merchant Marine (USMM) and was the chief radio operator aboard the SS Leonidas Polk. On December 3, 1943, sailing in the North Atlantic, the Leonidas Polk collided with another ship in its convoy, which sank immediately. Blum dove overboard and swam towards the voice of a survivor calling out for help. Blum’s body washed up on the shores of Scotland three weeks later. He was buried in Cambridge, England. His death changed his family forever.\n\nPhotograph of Murray M. Blum in his United States Merchant Marine uniform. Location unknown. 1940s. Photograph of the Murray M. Blum flag.
