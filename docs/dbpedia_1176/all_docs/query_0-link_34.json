The subcommittee met at 9:31 a.m., in room SD-192, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Daniel K. Inouye (chairman) presiding. Present: Senators Inouye, Dorgan, Shelby, and Brownback. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Army Office of the Secretary STATEMENTS OF: HON. JOHN M. McHUGH, SECRETARY GENERAL GEORGE W. CASEY, CHIEF OF STAFF opening statement of chairman daniel k. inouye Chairman Inouye. The hearing will come to order. This morning, we welcome the Honorable John McHugh, Secretary of the Army, along with General George Casey, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Gentlemen, we thank you for being here with us today as we review the Army's budget request for fiscal year 2011. Before proceeding, I'd like to announce that, because of illness, the vice chairman will not be with us this morning. In his place, we have the gentleman from Alabama. The Department of the Army's fiscal year 2011 budget request is $143.4 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion over last year's enacted budget, excluding funding appropriated to the Army in the fiscal year 2010 supplemental. The Army also has requested $20 billion for overseas contingency operations for the remainder of this fiscal year, primarily to fund surge operations in Afghanistan. In April of last year, President Obama and Secretary Gates announced substantial initiatives within the Department of Defense to strengthen our All-Volunteer Force, change how and what the Department buys, and rebalance military capabilities. After an overhaul of the Army's modernization effort last year, fiscal year 2011 budget request includes $3.2 billion for the Army's revamped Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program and provides $6 billion for Army aviation. The fiscal year 2011 budget request builds upon the reform agenda set by Secretary Gates last year and supports the final year of a 5-year plan to restore balance to an Army that has experienced the cumulative effects of years upon years of conflict. The subcommittee is looking forward to hearing not only about these efforts, but also about the Department's vision to rebalance and reshape, as directed in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) completed this past January. One of the central themes of the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review is balance. The Department needs to find balance between providing capabilities to prevail in today's wars, while building the capabilities needed to counter future threats. The Army is shouldering a very heavy burden, since it has been conducting combat operations in two theaters while transforming and modernizing at the same time. However, budget pressures to support current operations have made it very difficult to allow for the investment in modernization. Not only is balance included and needed between meeting the demands of today and the threats of the future, it is also needed within each of the military services, and the Army has continued to answer the Nation's call, but it has been at the expense of maintaining a well-balanced force. We are aware of the demands created by more than 8 years of continuous war. Repeated and lengthy deployments have stressed our soldiers, their families, and our support systems and equipment. Currently the Department is managing a shift in focus in our overseas contingency operations. While the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq has begun, an additional 30,000 troops have been committed to supporting operations in Afghanistan. Since the Army is the service most heavily engaged in these operations, the Secretary of Defense has permitted the Army to retain 22,000 soldiers, temporarily, above the authorized end strength of 547,000. This decision was made to acknowledge the fact that future readiness is dependent upon restoring balance and lessening the strain upon the force. Finally, there is one other type of balance that this subcommittee will be looking for during the budget review, the balance between risk and resources. The Quadrennial Defense Review has set the agenda and defined requirements, and presumably the Department has budgeted for those priorities. However, there will never be enough resources to eliminate all risk. It is our hope that today's hearing will help illuminate how the Army's fiscal year 2011 budget request addresses the recommendations of the Quadrennial Defense Review while maintaining balance among a number of valued, yet equally important, priorities. Gentlemen, we sincerely appreciate your service to our Nation and your dedication and sacrifices made daily by the men and women in our Army. We could not be more grateful for what those who wear our Nation's uniform do for our country each and every day. Gentlemen, your full statements will be made a part of the record. And I would now wish to turn to the Senator from Alabama. statement of senator richard c. shelby Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief. I just want to join you in welcoming Secretary McHugh and General Casey to this subcommittee. They're no strangers here. Thank you. Chairman Inouye. I thank you very much. Now, with that, Secretary, we are depending on you, sir. summary statement of hon. john mc hugh Mr. McHugh. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. As you noted, we'll enter, with your permission, our full statements into the record. And I know time is of some concern here this morning, so I just would like to summarize a few of those points. First of all, I want to, at the risk of stating the obvious, say what an honor it is to be here today. I had the distinct honor of serving for 17 years on the House Armed Services Committee, and in that time I gained a great appreciation for the great work this subcommittee does, for the enormous support that it has, historically, and certainly under the leadership of you, the vice chairman, and the current members, have continued in support of not just our Army, but all of our services. I certainly want to take this opportunity to express my personal appreciation and thanks for all that you do, and all that you will continue to do. If I may, Mr. Chairman, just a few comments on my now 5 months as the 21st Secretary of the Army. And while it's been a crash course of learning, I think some things are obvious. And I would add, Mr. Chairman, in listening to your opening comments, I think you've encapsulated very well the key questions, the key challenges that lie before us. As you've said, Mr. Chairman, and as I have seen from the first day I walked into that hallowed building on the other side of the Potomac, this is an Army that clearly is fatigued, is stressed by nearly 9 years of combat. But, it is still an Army that is amazingly resilient, that is amazingly effective. Today, as you know, this is an Army that has more expertise, more education, it has more capability and lethality than any Army in our Nation's history. That is, in no small measure, because of the great support and leadership that has come out of this great subcommittee. Those are significant gains, but, in spite of those gains, this is, quite simply, an Army that is, and remains, out of balance. The Chief of Staff--General Casey--and my predecessor, Pete Geren, the Army leadership, along in partnership with the Congress have made great progress in bringing that balance back. I think, one of the key assets and key attributes of the President's proposed budget is that it allows us to continue the regaining of balance, and, in fact, should allow us to finish it. But, this is a very delicate balance, and we need to stay focused on that objective. You noted, Mr. Chairman, the variety of appropriations that take us toward that goal, the $1.7 billion in requests to continue to fund our vital family programs in support of those amazing families, and other initiatives. I won't continue to repeat those, but a couple of other points, I think, do bear noting. We remain extraordinarily committed to our wounded warriors. Tomorrow, I will have the opportunity to pay my regular visit to Walter Reed, and I know what I will see. I will see a cadre of individuals who have stepped forward, who have given more in their time on the battlefield than most Americans could possibly imagine, and who will ask one simple question, ``What can I do to serve more?'' We recognize the obligation we have to provide world-class transition, world- class healthcare services to those heroes. This budget provides us with that opportunity and allows us to go forward in that solemn obligation. It also allows us to do something very important, in terms of recapitalizing, rebalancing, and modernizing our equipment systems that require those kinds of adjustments. And, as you noted, Mr. Chairman, that's a significant challenge under the best of circumstances, but clearly, at time of war, becomes even more problematic. But, with your support, we will continue to do that. The funding is there--$3.1--$31.7 billion in research and development, brigade combat team modernization funds, et cetera, et cetera. The other thing--and it's something that this Congress recognized last year--that we need help in is acquisition reform. I think it's necessary to give our acquisition people, who have also been at war for nearly 9 years, their due. Over the last 10 years, they've had a 15-percent cut in personnel and a 500-percent increase in their dollars to bring under contract. And in spite of that, in that time, 1,000 protests brought against the decisions that they made, and only 8 of those 1,000 protests upheld. Still, they would be the first to recognize they need help. We need to continue to redevelop the acquisition rules and regulations to allow us to be more effective in support of the warfighter, and, equally important, more efficient in support of our taxpayer dollars. We look forward in engaging with this Congress, with this great subcommittee, in bringing that about. prepared statement In the end, I would tell you, we have an Army that is strong in spirit, it is strong in ability and in results. But, as I said in my opening comments, and as you noted, Mr. Chairman, it is an Army that is greatly stressed. We can do better by them. We feel that's our obligation and what this budget brings to the table and allows us the opportunity to do. And, in partnership with you, we look forward to pursuing that very worthy goal. With that, Mr. Chairman, I'd yield back. Chairman Inouye. I thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of John M. McHugh and General George W. Casey, Jr. introduction America's Army continues to answer the Nation's call, as it has since it was established nearly 235 years ago. Today our Army is fighting two wars, assisting other nations as they build their own security capacity, supporting civil authorities at home, helping the people of Haiti rebuild after a devastating earthquake, and preparing to deter and defeat new threats. The Army's Soldiers, Civilians, and Families faithfully shoulder the load that our Nation asks of them. With the support of the Congress, we are on track with our 4-year plan to put the Army back in balance. Though their sacrifices can never be fully repaid, the Nation continues to recognize and honor our Soldiers and their Families by supporting them before, during, and following deployments. Our Soldiers rely upon the best training and equipment that our Nation can provide to accomplish their mission. Yet even with this continued support, the demands of 8 years of war weigh heavily on our Army. The strain of multiple deployments is evident on Soldiers and their Families. Equipment is used at a pace that seriously challenges our maintenance and replacement capabilities and resources. The stress is present in our institutions as we change 20th century systems and processes to meet the demands of the 21st century. Our Nation faces the difficult challenge of balancing when, where, and how to engage in a dynamic and uncertain world while meeting important priorities at home. However, when the security of our citizens or allies is threatened, the Nation can depend on America's Army--the Strength of the Nation. strategic context The United States faces a complex strategic landscape with an array of diverse security challenges. We are fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while preparing for future challenges to our national security. For the foreseeable future, violent extremist movements such as Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations comprise the most immediate threats. Current global economic conditions, changes in demographics, cultural pressures associated with globalization, and competition for scarce resources exacerbate the uncertainty and volatility of the strategic environment. Within this setting, the American Soldier stands as our Nation's most visible and enduring symbol of commitment in an era of persistent conflict. persistent conflict For the near future, persistent conflict--protracted confrontation among state, non-state, and individual actors that are increasingly willing to use violence to achieve their political and ideological ends--will characterize the global security environment. Security crises will arise unpredictably, vary in intensity and scope, and last for uncertain durations. These challenges will take place in all domains: land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies will continue to be frequent and unpredictable missions, requiring the commitment of Soldiers and resources. In this dynamic environment, the Army will conduct operations that span the spectrum of conflict from humanitarian and civil support to counterinsurgency to general war, often simultaneously. global trends Several global trends will continue to shape the international security environment and the conflicts confronting our Nation. Globalization may increase prosperity, but it can also spread destabilizing influences. The unequal distribution of benefits creates societies with divisions between ``haves'' and ``have nots''--divisions that can be exploited by extremist ideologies and lead to conflict. Fault lines reflecting protracted competition and friction can erupt unpredictably as societies struggle to adjust to the move toward modernity and greater interdependence. Meanwhile, increasingly available and affordable technology provides our adversaries sophisticated tools to enable a networked approach to recruiting the disenfranchised and exporting terror. Shifting demographics and rapid population growth that is increasingly urbanized can continue to break down traditional, localized norms of governance, behavior, and identity, and further strain already stressed governments. This is especially true where a lack of economic opportunity increases the potential for instability and extremism. Those who are disaffected may rebel against perceived Western interference, challenges to traditional values, and ineffective governments. Increased resource demand, in particular energy, water, and food, is a consequence of growing prosperity and populations. The growing global competition for resources will continue to produce friction and increase opportunities for conflict. In this environment, climate change and natural disasters will compound already difficult conditions in developing countries by igniting humanitarian crises, causing destabilizing population migrations, and raising the potential for epidemic diseases. The two trends of greatest concern are the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and failed or failing states. A catastrophic attack utilizing WMD has the potential to be globally destabilizing. Failed or failing states, lacking the will or capacity to maintain effective territorial control, contribute to regional instability and provide ideal environments for terrorist groups to plan and export operations. The merging of these two trends constitutes a significant and compelling threat. Together, these trends make conflict in the decades ahead more likely. character of conflict in the 21st century Global trends and recent conflicts--such as those in Lebanon and Georgia--and our own recent combat experience indicate the evolving character of conflict in the 21st century. Conflicts will be waged among diverse actors--state and non-state-- with the latter employing capabilities that, during the last century, remained largely the purview of nation-states. Motives, objectives, and often the identities of these actors will be difficult to discern, and are likely to shift as some act covertly and others use proxies. The battle to gain influence over, and support from, populations will be central to our success. Therefore, conflict will be unavoidably waged among the people. The initiation, location, duration, and intensity of conflicts are increasingly unpredictable. In an interdependent world, conflicts are more susceptible to the potential for spillover, creating regionally, and potentially globally, destabilizing effects. All of this will occur under the unblinking scrutiny of the 24-hour global media cycle and the Internet. Details of conflict as well as misinformation will flow equally across social, communications, and cyber networks. Our adversaries will exploit these media and communication sources locally and globally. We are more likely to face hybrid threats--diverse and dynamic combinations of conventional, irregular, terrorist, and criminal capabilities employed asymmetrically to counter our advantages. Hybrid threats require hybrid solutions--adaptive military forces that can function in a variety of situations with a diverse set of national, allied, and indigenous partners. Given the strategic environment, enduring global trends, and the character of 21st century conflict, the Army will operate as part of a Joint, interagency, inter-governmental, and multi-national team to fulfill its global commitments. roles of land forces More than one million of our men and women have served in the ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 3,900 American Soldiers have given their lives, and more than 25,000 others have been wounded during this longest period of sustained conflict ever fought by an all- volunteer force. Today, America's Army has over 255,000 Soldiers and more than 18,500 Army Civilians serving in nearly 80 countries around the world--with the remainder stationed within the United States supporting domestic missions, resetting from recent deployments, or preparing for an upcoming deployment. Our Soldiers are performing magnificently around the world every day, and the roles for land forces in this environment are becoming increasingly clear. First, the Army must prevail in protracted counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. Not only must we prevail in our current missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, we must be prepared to prevail in any future COIN operation. Second, the Army must engage to help other nations build capacity and to assure our friends and allies. Through security force assistance, we can increase the capacity of other nations' military and police to uphold the rule of law, ensure domestic order, and deny sanctuary to terrorists--thereby helping avoid future conflicts that might otherwise develop. American Soldiers are currently deployed to Central America and the Balkans, building the capacity of indigenous security forces. Additionally, the Army has established an Army Service Component Command for U.S. Africa Command to assist partner nations and humanitarian organizations in Africa. A third role that the Army fulfills is to provide support to civil authorities at home and abroad. In the past year alone, American Soldiers have fought fires in the west, conducted search and rescue operations in the Rockies and Alaska, and assisted with tsunami relief in American Samoa, in support of civil authorities. The Army has also provided a sizeable force to support the relief efforts in Haiti following the catastrophic earthquake that destroyed its capital. Army units from both the active and reserve components remain prepared to react to a variety of crises as consequence management and response forces. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is a lead organization in providing DOD support to civil authorities for disaster relief at home and engineering support to USAID overseas. Abroad, the Army has also supported civil authorities in many ways, such as sending Agribusiness Development Teams from the Army National Guard to Afghanistan. Finally, the Army must deter and defeat hybrid threats and hostile state actors. As an Army, we recognize that we must remain prepared to meet and defeat hostile state actors that threaten our national security. But we recognize that the probability of facing a nation that will challenge America's military head-on is lower than it was during the Cold War and other periods in our history. Our readiness and capability to confront near-peer competitors also deters war by raising the stakes for nation-state and hybrid actors who would threaten our security interests. To meet these threats, Army units continue to participate in Joint and international training exercises around the world, ensuring that military skills and cooperative partnerships remain strong. The Army continues to position forces in Korea and at various missile defense sites in order to discourage actors who seek to disrupt regional stability and security. two critical challenges The Army has operated at a demanding pace for the last 8 years, and while it has met each challenge, the strain has placed the Army out of balance. Demand for Army forces continues to exceed the sustainable supply. Against that backdrop, the Army continues to meet the wartime requirements of our Nation while it addresses the two major challenges facing our force--restoring balance and setting conditions for the future. In 2007, we established a 4-year plan to restore balance to an Army that had experienced the cumulative effects of years of conflict. The fiscal year 2011 budget supports the final year in that plan. As we continue to restore balance to the force, we are also setting the conditions for the Army of the 21st century--an Army that fulfills our strategic role as an integral part of our Joint Force. restoring balance: the army's four imperatives With the help of Congress, we have made significant progress over the past 3 years in our plan to restore balance--a plan founded on four imperatives. Yet today the Army remains out of balance. We've improved our ability to sustain the Army's Soldiers, Families, and Civilians; prepare forces for success in the current conflict; reset returning units to rebuild the readiness consumed in operations and to prepare for future deployments and contingencies; and transform to meet the demands of the 21st century. As a result of this progress we now are in a better position to achieve balance than we were 2 years ago. Critical to this was the growth in the size of the Army. The security agreement with Iraq that transferred security in urban areas to Iraqis was a momentous and welcomed accomplishment. The hard work and sacrifice of our Soldiers with the support of Congress helped make this achievement possible and set the conditions for our responsible drawdown of combat forces in Iraq this year. Coupled with our growth, the drawdown in Iraq allowed for our increased commitment of forces to Afghanistan to stem the rising violence, and disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda while reversing the momentum of the Taliban insurgency. However, the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to create demands that have our Army operating beyond sustainable capacity. In fact, in 2009 more Soldiers were deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan combined than during the height of the Iraq surge. Presently, and for the short term, we lack sufficient strategic flexibility, and we continue to accumulate risk. We continue to stress our Soldiers, Families, Civilians, equipment, and institutional systems, so our efforts to restore balance must not waiver. Sustain Sustaining our all-volunteer force is our first imperative. Nowhere is the stress on our force more profound than in the toll it takes on our people, as is tragically evident in the rising number of suicides and increasing need for counseling among our Soldiers and Families. We are aggressively addressing the causes of stress on individuals resulting from the cumulative effects of multiple deployments, and seeking to build resilience in Soldiers, Families and Civilians. The Army is committed to ensuring that the quality of life of those who serve the Nation is commensurate with the quality of their service. Goals To sustain the force, the Army continues to pursue four major goals. Our first goal is to Recruit and Retain quality Soldiers and Civilians dedicated to service to the Nation. Next, we are committed to furnishing the best Care, Support, and Services for Soldiers, Families, and Civilians by improving quality of life through meaningful initiatives such as the Army Family Action Plan, the Army Family Covenant, Army Community Covenants, and the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness Program. It is our solemn obligation to provide world-class Warrior Care and Transition to our wounded, ill, and injured Warriors through properly led and resourced Warrior Transition Units. Finally, by Supporting the Families of our Fallen Comrades we honor their service and sacrifice. Progress and Accomplishments The Army met 104 percent of its recruiting goals for 2009, and achieved both numeric goals and quality benchmarks for new recruits. All components exceeded 105 percent of their reenlistment goals. We reduced off-duty fatalities by 20 percent, to include a 15 percent reduction in overall privately-owned-vehicle fatalities and 37 percent reduction in motorcycle fatalities. In collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health, the Army began a seminal study into suicide prevention that will inform the Army Suicide Prevention Program and society's approach to suicide. We began instituting Comprehensive Soldier Fitness--an all- inclusive approach to emotional, social, spiritual, family, and physical fitness--as the foundation to building resiliency within the Army. We initiated an unprecedented series of construction projects at five major hospitals as part of our commitment to modernize our healthcare system. The Army established the Warrior Transition Command and reorganized Warrior Transition Brigades to provide centralized support, rehabilitation, and individualized transition planning to our recovering Warriors. We expanded Survivor Outreach Services to over 26,000 Family members, providing unified support and advocacy, and enhancing survivor benefits for the Families of our Soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We implemented the Post 9/11 GI Bill, significantly increasing educational benefits for active duty Soldiers, Veterans, and Family members. The Army Reserve established Army Strong Community Centers to support geographically-dispersed Soldiers and Families. Together with Army National Guard Family Assistance Centers and Soldier and Family Assistance Centers on active duty installations, these centers provide help to Soldiers' Families near their hometowns. Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Highlights Provides $1.7 billion to standardize and fund vital Family programs and services to include welfare and recreation; youth services and child care; Survivor Outreach Services; and expanded education and employment opportunities for Family members. Provides a 1.4 percent military basic pay raise and Civilian pay raise, a 3.9 percent basic allowance for housing increase, and a 3.4 percent basic allowance for subsistence increase. Warrior Transition Units for our wounded Soldiers will continue to receive strong support in fiscal year 2011 with $18 million in Military Construction funds allocated to resource construction of barracks spaces. Supports Residential Communities Initiatives program, which provides quality, sustainable residential communities for Soldiers and their Families living on-post, and continues to offset out-of-pocket housing expenses for those residing off-post. Prepare Our Soldiers face determined enemies--so preparing the force for our current conflict is complex and time-consuming, but essential for success. Our units must have the people, training, and equipment they need to prevail. Meanwhile, our institutions and systems must adapt to provide those critical capabilities in a timely manner and in sufficient quantities. Goals To prepare the force, we have four key goals. First, we accelerated the pace at which we needed to Grow the Army to our end strength and to grow our modular brigades to 73 Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and nearly 230 Support Brigades. Second, the Army is committed to improving individual and collective Training to better prepare Soldiers and leaders for a complex and challenging operational environment. Next, we continuously work to provide our formations with effective Equipment in a timely manner that maintains our technological edge and protects our most critical resource--the Soldier. Finally, we must transform the Army to a rotational model--Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN)--the core process for generating trained, ready, and cohesive units on a sustained and rotational basis--to meet current and future strategic demands. Progress and Accomplishments We began the phase-out of stop-loss, starting with the Reserve Component in August 2009 and the Army National Guard in September 2009, and followed by the Active Army in January 2010. Today, no mobilizing or deploying units have stop-loss Soldiers in their ranks. The force achieved its ``Grow the Army'' end strength goal of 1.1 million in 2009. The active component continues to grow toward its additional authorized Temporary End Strength in order to improve unit manning within the already existing Army structure as we eliminate stop-loss. Fifteen month tours effectively ended in November 2009, when the last Soldiers on those extended deployments returned. We completed fielding nearly 12,000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan and delivered the first MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles (M-ATVs) to Afghanistan--just 15 months after identifying the need for that capability. As of the beginning of February, we have provided nearly 800 M-ATVs to Afghanistan. This year, we successfully manned, trained, equipped, and deployed 67 brigade equivalents. The Army exceeded fleet readiness of 90 percent for ground equipment, to include MRAPs, and 75 percent for aviation. We established Army Training Network (ATN)--a 21st Century Approach to Army Training. This revolution in training knowledge access is now providing a one-stop portal to share training best practices, solutions, and products across the Army. The Army increased its employment of biometric technologies enabling the Army to better identify the enemy among the populace. Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Highlights Funds permanent, active component end strength at 547,400; Army Reserve at 205,000; and National Guard at 358,200 in the base budget and supports a 22,000 temporary increase in the active component through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request. Procures and upgrades the Army's UH-60 Black Hawk, CH-47 Chinook, and AH-64 Apache helicopters, which are vital to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Provides over $1 billion for flight crew training in all components to fund flying hours, maintenance, fuel, airfield operations, and specialized skill training. Reset With the pace of continuous combat operations in two wars for the past 8 years, we are consuming our readiness as fast as we can build it. Reset restores returning units--their Soldiers, Families, and equipment--to a level of readiness necessary for future missions. Goals Our Reset plans include four goals. Our efforts to Revitalize Soldiers and Families seek to reestablish and strengthen relationships following deployments. The Army's comprehensive efforts to Repair, Replace, and Recapitalize Equipment affected by the harsh environments of the war are essential to resetting units. In particular, achieving responsible drawdown in Iraq while increasing our commitment of forces and equipment to Afghanistan will require an unprecedented reset effort. The Army must Retrain Soldiers, Leaders, and Units to build critical skills necessary to operate across the spectrum of conflict in the current security environment. Lastly, we are identifying and applying the lessons learned from the Reset Pilot Program that was designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Reset process. Army Reset is a necessary process that must continue not only as long as we have forces deployed, but an additional two to three years after major deployments end. Progress and Accomplishments The Army completed the reset of 29 brigades' worth of equipment in fiscal year 2009 and continued the reset of 13 more. In total, we have reset more than 98,000 pieces of equipment as depot production has doubled since September 11, 2001. We began executing a responsible drawdown in Iraq which will redistribute, transfer, or dispose of 3.4 million pieces of equipment; redeploy 143,000 military and Civilian personnel, and 147,000 contractors; close 22 supply support activities; and consume or dispose of over 21,000 short tons of supplies. In 2009, more than 160,000 Soldiers and Family members participated in over 2,600 Strong Bonds events designed to strengthen Army Families. The Army continues to revise its approach to training by emphasizing doing fewer tasks better, making judicious use of field time, and maximizing the use of mobile training teams and distributed learning. We completed our Reset Pilot Program and will begin instituting the full Reset model across the Army in 2010. The Army fostered partnerships by executing more than $24 billion in new foreign military sales. Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Highlights Provides $10.8 billion to reset Army equipment through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request. Supports training and sustainment of Army forces to include individual skills and leader training; combined arms training toward full spectrum operations; and adaptable, phased training based on the ARFORGEN process. Transform Since 2004, the Army has been transforming our force to provide the combatant commanders tailored, strategically responsive forces that can dominate across the spectrum of conflict. Transformation is a continuous process that sets the conditions for success against both near-term and future enemies. Goals Our goals for transformation include continued Modular Reorganization to standardize our formations to create a more deployable, adaptable, and versatile force. We will accelerate fielding of Advanced Technologies to ensure our Soldiers retain their technological edge. The Army will Operationalize the Reserve Components by systematically building and sustaining readiness while increasing predictability for these Soldiers, Families, employers, and communities. Completing the requirements of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) statutes is central to Restationing Forces. Soldier and Leader Development will ensure that we produce the next generation of agile and adaptive military and Civilian leaders who are supremely competent in their core proficiencies and sufficiently broad enough to operate effectively in the Joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multi- national environments. Progress and Accomplishments The Army is 88 percent complete on the modular conversion of its brigades. The fiscal year 2011 budget will support the near completion of this process. The Army consolidated existing aviation force structure to create a 12th active component combat aviation brigade (CAB) forming an additional deployable CAB without adding force structure. The Army activated the 162nd Infantry Brigade at Fort Polk, Louisiana, providing a dedicated and enduring capability to prepare combat advisors to train and build capacity in foreign security forces. Trainers from the brigade are now deployed to Afghanistan to assist with the training and development of the Afghan Security Forces. The Army developed a new incremental capability package approach to modernization which will allow technologically mature, Soldier-tested, proven technologies to be prioritized, bundled in time, and fielded to the force more quickly than ever before. We provided combatant commanders with dedicated, regionally based network operations support, and integrated cyber security capability in the form of Theater Network Operations and Security Centers, unique within the Department of Defense. This past year, the Army closed three active installations and five U.S. Army Reserve Centers and is on course to complete BRAC in fiscal year 2011. To date, we have awarded 265 major military construction projects, of which 59 are complete. The Army built a Leader Development Strategy that balances experience, greater opportunities for professional education, and training in full spectrum operations. Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Highlights Invests nearly $3.2 billion in BCT modernization programs that include procurement of the first incremental changes packages for Infantry BCTs and additional research, development, testing, and evaluation funding for subsequent change packages as well as initial development of the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). Provides funds to begin equipping a 13th Combat Aviation Brigade. Supports the increase in ISR platforms to include the Extended Range/Multi-Purpose, Raven, Shadow unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the Extended Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System. setting conditions for the future 21st Century Army The second critical challenge facing the Army is setting the conditions for the future through a continuous process of transformation. We must ensure that our Nation has the capability and range of military options to meet the evolving challenges we face in the 21st century. We need an Army that is a versatile mix of tailorable and networked organizations, operating on a rotational cycle, to provide a sustained flow of trained and ready forces for full spectrum operations and to hedge against unexpected contingencies--at a tempo that is predictable and sustainable for our all-volunteer force. Versatility is the central organizing principle of a balanced Army. It enables our forces and institutions to effectively execute operations across the spectrum of conflict. Our modular heavy, Stryker, and light brigades provide a versatile mix of forces that can be combined to provide multi-purpose capabilities, and sufficient capacity to accomplish a broad range of tasks from peacetime engagement to major combat operations. Our modular units are designed to be tailorable. Brigades now have capabilities previously found at division level and higher. These brigades can be tailored for specific missions and combined with support units and key enablers such as ISR, communications, civil affairs, psychological operations, public affairs capabilities, and expanded logistics support, to accomplish a wide variety of missions and increase the land options available to combatant commanders. The network is essential to a 21st century Army. Networked organizations improve the situational awareness and understanding leaders need to act decisively at all points along the spectrum of conflict, while providing connectivity down to the individual Soldier. The network allows dispersed Army organizations to plan and operate together, and provides connectivity to Joint, combined, and interagency assets. To support this objective, the Army will use the Global Network Enterprise Construct (GNEC) as our strategy to transform LandWarNet to a centralized, more secure, operationalized, and sustainable network capable of supporting an expeditionary Army. To provide a sustained flow of trained and ready forces at a tempo sustainable for our all-volunteer force, we will put the whole Army under a rotational model--ARFORGEN. The ARFORGEN process includes three force pools--Reset, Train- Ready, and Available. Each of the three force pools contains a versatile force package, available at varying time intervals based on its readiness level. Each force pool consists of an operational headquarters (a corps), five division headquarters (of which one or two are National Guard), twenty brigade combat teams (three or four are National Guard), and 90,000 enablers (about half of those are Guard and Reserve). Each will be capable of full spectrum operations once we reach a steady-state, ratio of time deployed (known as ``boots on the ground'' or BOG) to time at home (dwell) of 1:2 (BOG:dwell) for active component forces and 1:4 for reserve component forces. This versatile mix of land forces could sustain operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At lower demand levels, a sustainable BOG:dwell ratio of 1:3 for active component forces and 1:5 for reserve component forces provides ready, global reaction forces and regionally-oriented forces for engagement in support of Theater Security Cooperation Programs. This process also allows strategic flexibility to surge in response to unexpected contingencies across the spectrum of conflict, and provides operational depth with more forces available for longer commitment times. The increased demands of our combatant commanders, coupled with the size of our active component (AC) force, require that we continue to integrate reserve component (RC) forces as part of our operational force. Continued and routine access to our RC forces is essential to sustaining current operations, and is improving the overall operational experience and quality of our RC forces. Additionally, sufficient Army National Guard (ARNG) forces must be ready and immediately available to their state and territorial authorities to respond to domestic crises. We are building an integrated Army in which our RC forces are included in the rotational cycle, but at a deployment rate of about half that of their AC counterparts. The ARFORGEN process increases predictability for Soldiers, Families, employers, and communities, and enables our RC to remain an integral element of the operational force while providing the Nation with the strategic depth (i.e. those non-deployed units which are 2 to 3 years from commitment) and operational flexibility to meet unexpected contingencies. The Army has undergone significant changes in recent years, and we must continue to change in order to keep pace with an environment of uncertainty and complexity in this era of persistent conflict. The same requirements that drive the imperative to change also drive our modernization efforts and need for institutional adaptation. Realizing Change To become the Army the Nation needs in the second decade of the 21st century, we are transforming the Army and prioritizing programs and efforts that show the most promise for today and tomorrow. Similarly, we are transforming business processes across the Army, including how we identify requirements, acquire, and provide materiel capabilities to our Soldiers, and how we adapt our institutions to align with the ARFORGEN process. On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates announced his adjustments to the defense program as part of the President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2010. The Secretary's decisions had an immediate and major impact on our FCS-centric Army modernization effort. He terminated the MGV portion of FCS, directing that we ``reevaluate the requirements, technology, and approach--and then re-launch the Army's vehicle modernization program. . . .'' He further directed the Army to ``accelerate the initial increment of the program to spin out technology enhancements to all combat brigades,'' and retain and deliver software and network development program in increments, and incorporate MRAP into our force structure. Secretary Gates' intent for these bold adjustments was clear--to better reflect the lessons that we were learning from ongoing operations and better posture Army forces for a broader range of future challenges. To fully implement the Secretary of Defense's direction, the Army has developed a comprehensive plan. We refer to this new program as the Army's ``Brigade Combat Team Modernization Plan,'' which is a subset of our overall Army Modernization Strategy. BCT Modernization Plan We will leverage the lessons learned from the last 8 years to provide effective and affordable equipment now, while reducing the time it takes to develop and field new and updated materiel solutions. BCT Modernization includes four elements: modernizing the network over time to take advantage of technology upgrades, while simultaneously expanding it to cover ever increasing portions of the force; incorporating MRAPs into our force; rapidly developing and fielding a new Ground Combat Vehicle that meets the requirements of the 21st century Army; and incrementally fielding Capability Packages that best meet the needs of Soldiers and units as they train and then deploy. Army Network.--Central to the Army's modernization efforts is an enhanced and interoperable communication network that gives the Army a decisive advantage across the spectrum of conflict. The network supports leaders in making timely, informed decisions, and supports organizational agility, lethality, and sustainability. It allows our Soldiers to know where the enemy is, where other friendly forces and civilian populations are, and what weapon systems are available for them at any given time. The network links Soldiers on the battlefield with space-based and aerial sensors, robots, and command posts-- providing unprecedented situational awareness and control and enabling the application of precise lethal fires on the modern battlefield. Maintaining our technological advantage is a constant challenge. The Army's battle command network must be continuously upgraded to ensure security and provide improved capability, capacity, connectivity and operational effectiveness. The Warfighter Information Network (Tactical) (WIN-T) is designed to extend the network ultimately to the company level for BCTs and provide real-time information, such as high definition imagery, from surveillance sources. The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) was born Joint with the specific requirement to resolve radio interoperability among the services. It will provide Soldiers at the tactical level with connectivity at extended ranges, including voice, data, and video, enabling them to move information from platoon to higher-level command posts in complex terrain (including urban and mountainous areas). MRAP Strategy.--In response to deadly IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Nation made a tremendous investment in fielding MRAPs that have saved lives by providing significantly improved protection for our Soldiers. The Army is incorporating these vehicles throughout its unit formations. Additionally, we used the basic design of the MRAP as the foundation for the M-ATV, modifying it for the mountainous terrain in Afghanistan and in other regions around the world. The MRAP family of vehicles provides the versatility our forces need to rapidly move around the battlefield, particularly in an IED environment, with the best protection we can provide. Ground Combat Vehicle.--Combining the lessons learned from the survivability of the MRAP, the tactical mobility of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the operational mobility of the Stryker, the Army is developing a Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) that possesses all of these qualities. Providing Soldiers protected mobility is our top design criteria. The first combat vehicle designed from the ground up to operate in an IED environment, the GCV will have enhanced mobility that will allow it to operate effectively in both urban and off-road environments. It will be designed to host the Army's network. And perhaps most importantly, it will have the capacity available to accept future upgrades incrementally as technologies mature and threats change. The GCV will be versatile enough to support our expeditionary requirements and be capable of carrying an infantry squad. It will combine sustainability features that match the availability rates of the Stryker while consuming less fuel than current vehicles of similar weight and power. The pace of change and the operational environment demand an expedited acquisition timeline, so the Army is pursuing a GCV program timeline that provides the first production vehicles in seven years. Capability Packages.--Capability packages provide the Army a regular, timely process to enable our deployable units with the latest materiel and non-materiel solutions based on the evolving challenges of the operating environment. The best available capabilities will go to the Soldiers who need them most, based on the threats they are likely to face. These bundles of capabilities will include materiel, doctrine, organization, and training to fill the highest priority requirements and mitigate risk for Soldiers. This incremental packaging approach will enable leaders to make timely, resource-informed decisions, and will help ensure that we provide the best available technologies to fulfill urgent needs to Soldiers in the fight--all driven by the cyclic readiness produced by ARFORGEN. These capability packages will upgrade our units as they prepare to deploy by providing them improved capabilities such as precision fires and advanced Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR). The Army Modernization Strategy The Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization Plan is a key element of our overall Army Modernization Strategy. The Army Modernization Strategy reflects our overarching vision of how we will achieve our ends, which is to: --Develop and field an affordable and interoperable mix of the best equipment available to allow Soldiers and units to succeed in both today's and tomorrow's full spectrum military operations. The Army Modernization Strategy relies on three interrelated lines of effort: --Develop and field new capabilities to meet identified capability ``gaps'' through traditional or rapid acquisition processes. In support of this Line of Effort in fiscal year 2011 we have requested $934 million to develop the Army's new Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV), which will overcome critical capability gaps in both current and future operations. It is envisioned to have the tactical mobility of a Bradley, the operational mobility of a Stryker, and the protection of an MRAP. We are also requesting $459 million to procure the Extended Range Multi- Purpose Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. This extraordinarily capable platform, which is already making a difference in Operation Enduring Freedom, gives commanders longer dwell ISR capabilities across a joint area of operations. --Continuously modernize equipment to meet current and future capability needs through upgrade, replacement, recapitalization, refurbishment, and technology insertions. Army efforts in this Line of Effort include our request for $887 million for the procurement of 16 Block III AH-64 Apache Helicopters, as well as the upgrade of 13 AH-64 Helicopters to Block II. Block III Apache is part of a long-term effort to improve situational awareness, performance, reliability, and sustainment of the Apache. Block II upgrades continue our commitment to modernize the Army National Guard Aviation Fleet. Additionally, in this line of effort, we have requested $505 million to upgrade Shadow RQ-7 UAVs. This key upgrade will increase the payload capacity and enhance the performance of this key ISR asset for our BCT Commanders. --Meet continuously evolving force requirements in the current operational environment by fielding and distributing capabilities in accordance with the Army Resource Priorities List (ARPL) and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) Model. Meeting the constantly evolving needs of theater commanders and the demands of persistent conflict will require unprecedented agility in our equipping and modernization programs. One example of this agility can be found in our Kiowa Warrior fleet. We are currently maneuvering our fleet of OH-58D Kiowa Warrior Light Helicopters to meet Army and COCOM requirements based on the ARFORGEN model. As Air Cavalry Squadrons return from conflict, their OH-58D helicopters are placed into Reset. Units in Reset have very few aircraft, if any. Because the Kiowa Warrior fleet is short 35 aircraft overall, when the squadrons transition into the Train/Ready Phase of ARFORGEN, they are provided a number of helicopters sufficient to conduct training (25), but less than what they are fully authorized (30). When the units move into the Available phase, they are provided their full complement of aircraft. It is this agility that has allowed Army forces to meet the needs of theater commanders for over eight years of sustained combat. What do we need? Congress has been very supportive of Army Modernization needs in the past. Their tremendous support has ensured that the Army Soldier is the best equipped and most respected combatant in the world. In order to execute Army Modernization and ensure the continued success of Soldiers and units, we depend on a variety of resources, not the least of which is predictable funding. For fiscal year 2011, we have requested $31.7 billion for procurement and Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) efforts. Adapting the Institution and Transforming Business Practices In addition to modernizing our operating force, we are transforming our institutional Army. As required by Section 904 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the appointment of the Under Secretary of the Army as the Army's Chief Management Officer (CMO) has allowed the Army to develop a series of initiatives to adapt the institutional Army and transform our business practices. In accordance with Section 908 of the 2009 NDAA, these efforts will result in the development and implementation of a comprehensive program that establishes a series of measurable performance goals and objectives. Specifically, the comprehensive program will address the following: --Developing and implementing a business transformation plan focused on running the Army as effectively and efficiently as possible. --Continuing the Army's business process reengineering activities, led by OSD's Business Transformation Agency. --Developing an integrated business systems architecture that emphasizes transparency and seamless access to data, and provides timely and accurate information to decision makers. --Preparing Army leaders to take a greater role in inculcating the Army with a cost-conscious culture. While the Army transformed its operating force--building versatile, agile units capable of adapting to changing environments--the institutional Army continued to use processes and procedures that were designed to support a pre-9/11 Army based on tiered levels of readiness. To support this new operating force, the Army must have an updated institutional Army--our generating force. Once the mission is defined, our institutions must seamlessly and continuously adapt--tailoring force packages and quickly adjusting training, manning, and equipping--to ensure units have all of the physical and mental tools necessary to succeed. Institutional agility allows us to adapt to the realities that present themselves. To that end, the CMO and Office of Business Transformation will build upon progress that has already been made toward the Army's institutional adaptation, specifically: --Improvement of the ARFORGEN process--aligning the generating force and its processes to better support Soldiers, Families, and units within the operating force. --Adoption of an Enterprise Approach--developing civilian and military leaders who take a collaborative, holistic view of Army objectives and resources to make better decisions for the Army. --Reformation of the requirements and resource processes--delivering timely and necessary capabilities at best value. This transformational approach will overlay everything that the institutional Army does, with the unwavering goal of effectively and efficiently providing trained and ready forces to meet combatant commander requirements. stewardship and innovation The Army remains devoted to the best possible stewardship of the resources it is provided by the American people through Congress. The establishment of the CMO and initiatives related to the transformation of Army business practices represent the Army's effort to act as a responsible steward. Several other initiatives serve to conserve resources and to reduce waste and inefficiencies wherever possible. The Army achieved full operating capability of the new Army Contracting Command, Expeditionary Contracting Command, and Mission and Installation Contracting Command in 2009. These organizations are dedicated to ensuring professional, ethical, efficient, and responsive contracting. Civilians are assuming increased responsibilities within the Army. The Army is recouping intellectual capital by in-sourcing former contracted positions that were associated with inherently governmental functions. In fiscal year 2009, the Army saved significant resources by in-sourcing more than 900 core governmental functions to Army Civilians. We plan to in-source 7,162 positions in fiscal year 2010, and are programmed to in-source 11,084 positions during fiscal year 2011-2015, of which 3,988 are acquisition positions. These positions were identified in the Army's ongoing contractor inventory review process. In the Employer Partnership program, the Army Reserve works with public agencies and private employers to leverage their shared interests in recruiting, training, and credentialing highly skilled Citizen-Soldiers. The Army Reserve has signed more than 800 partnership agreements with corporations, state agencies, and local police departments. Energy security is a key component of Army installations, weapons systems, and operations. The Army has developed a comprehensive energy security strategy, and is acting now to implement initiatives to make us less dependent on foreign sources of fuel and better stewards of our nation's energy resources. In support of these goals, we fielded the largest hybrid vehicle fleet within the Department of Defense. Energy will continue to be a key consideration in all Army activities in order to reduce demand, increase efficiency, seek alternative sources, and create a culture of energy accountability, while sustaining or enhancing operational capabilities. The Army is committed to environmental stewardship. Through cooperative partner agreements and the Army Compatible Use Buffer Program, the Army protected more than 28,000 acres of land at 14 locations in fiscal year 2009. Through creative solutions, the Army continues to conduct realistic training on its installations while protecting threatened and endangered species on Army lands. america's army--the strength of the nation The professionalism, dedicated service, and sacrifice of our all- volunteer force are hallmarks of the Army--the Strength of our Nation. Our Soldiers and their Families quietly bear the burdens of a Nation at war. Our Civilians stand with them, dedicated to the Nation and the Army that serves it. Despite the toll that 8 years of combat has taken, these great Americans continue to step forward to answer our Nation's call. In an environment in which we must make hard choices, they deserve the very best we can offer, commensurate with their dedication and sacrifice. To continue to fulfill our vital role for the Nation, the Army must sustain its efforts to restore balance and set conditions for the future. We have made significant progress this year, but challenges remain. The continued support of Congress will ensure that the Army remains manned, trained, and equipped to protect our national security interests at home and abroad, now and in the future. America's Army-- the Strength of the Nation. addendum a--the fiscal year 2011 president's budget The fiscal year 2011 President's budget asks for $245.6 billion for the Army. This budget, which includes $143.4 billion for the Base and $102.2 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) request, is necessary to: support current operations, increase forces in Afghanistan, responsibly drawdown in Iraq, sustain the all-volunteer force, and prepare for future threats. [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Amounts requested by major appropriation category in the fiscal year 2011 President's budget include: Military Personnel The fiscal year 2011 budget requests $71.0 billion, a $300 million increase over fiscal year 2010. Military Personnel funds support Army end-strength requirements for a Nation at war. This includes $1.2 billion for the temporary wartime increase in personnel, an increase of $684 million over fiscal year 2010. This amount funds pay, benefits, and associated personnel costs for 1,110,600 Soldiers: 547,400 Active, 358,200 Army National Guard, 205,000 Army Reserve and funds an active component temporary end strength increase of 22,000. The OCO request will fund special pays, incentives, and the mobilization of reserve component Soldiers. Compelling Needs Support the Army's base endstrength and the temporary end strength increase in fiscal year 2011 to reduce strain on the force. Sustain authorities and funding of programs in support of wounded, ill, and injured Warriors and their Families as they transition back to duty or to civilian life. Provide recruiting and retention incentives and benefits to sustain the quality of our all-volunteer force, allow the Army to meet end- strength objectives, and achieve Army standards for recruit quality. Enable the transition of the reserve component to an operational force by systematically building and sustaining readiness across the force and fund mobilization of RC units to support growing demand. Operation and Maintenance The fiscal year 2011 budget requests $107.3 billion--a $7 billion increase from fiscal year 2010. Operation and maintenance funds Soldier and unit training; ground and air vehicle operating costs; depot maintenance; base operations, sustainment, restoration, and modernization; and a 1.4 percent Civilian pay raise. The OCO portion of the request includes $628 million for the training and sustainment of the temporary wartime increase in personnel--an increase of $242 million from fiscal year 2010. The budget request works to restore balance to the force by recognizing $587 million of enduring requirements for training and depot maintenance in the base rather than in OCO. The base funds home station training for 59 brigade combat teams, 24 rotations through the Army's combined arms training centers, and an increased investment of $154 million in scholarships, language and individual training. It improves network security; operationalizes the LandWarNet; supports continued development and fielding of administrative systems; and provides funding for improvements in financial audit readiness (as required in NDAA 2009) by requesting an additional $578 million above the fiscal year 2010 levels for these activities. The base budget also increases funding for facilities sustainment restoration and modernization by $320 million and includes one-time requests to support BRAC and the transition out of NSPS. The OCO request will fund the day-to-day cost of the wars, training to prepare units for deployment, force protection, in-theater maintenance and repair, drawdown of equipment from Iraq, and reset of Army Prepositioned Stocks and equipment returning from deployment. Compelling Needs Sustain readiness through Soldier and unit training, including realistic, full spectrum training at the Army's three combat training centers. Fund the reset of 30 brigades, other enabling units, and equipment. Resource installation services worldwide and support the Army Family Covenant to provide Soldiers and their Families the quality of life they deserve and to enhance the health of the force. Procurement The fiscal year 2011 budget requests $30.3 billion--a $200 million decrease from fiscal year 2010. Procurement funds the Army's future force equipment requirements; sustains modernization and recapitalization; and fills equipment shortages. The OCO request will fund procurement of weapon systems to replace battle losses, replacement of equipment taken for current operations from the reserve components, and to fill urgent operational needs for deployed forces. Compelling Needs Fund the fielding of the first Capability Packages to two more Army brigades. Enhance Army command and control by providing an initial on-the- move networking capability resident in the Warfighter Information Network--Tactical (WIN-T), Increment 2. Increase the Army's tactical agility through an aviation modernization strategy that highlights the increasing importance of unmanned aerial systems (ERMP, Shadow and Raven) and rotary wing aviation (AH-64D Block III Apache, UH-60M Black Hawk and CH-47F Chinook). Improve lethality and precision fires by modernizing the Patriot PAC-3 missile, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, and the Paladin howitzer. Sustain access to training and war reserve ammunition by restoring stocks and the selective repair, upgrade and replacement of key ammunition production base equipment and facilities. Research, Development, Test and Evaluation The fiscal year 2011 budget requests $10.5 billion, approximately the same amount requested last year. Compelling Needs Fund Brigade Combat Team modernization including initial Ground Combat Vehicle development and further development of the second set of Capability Packages. Support Network modernization including continued development of WIN-T increment 2 and increment 3. Continues the international partnership to develop the Patriot Medium Extended Air Defense systems (MEADS) Construction, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), and Army Housing Fiscal year 2011 is a critical year for BRAC since this will be the final budget executed to meet the statutory deadline for many of the BRAC actions. fiscal year 2011 will be a particularly challenging year for BRAC as four of our major command headquarters and many of our military schools will be moving to new locations. The fiscal year 2011 budget requests $7.9 billion--a $2.5 billion decrease from fiscal year 2010. This funding supports the construction of facilities to support the growth and re-stationing of Army forces. The OCO request will fund construction in Afghanistan. Compelling Needs Fund BRAC requirements to meet fiscal year 2011 statutory timelines. Support construction of new family housing and improvements to existing housing. Support construction of permanent party and training barracks. Other Accounts The Army is the executive agent for a variety of critical functions within the Department of Defense, to include the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. Funding for this account is $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2011--a decrease of $100 million from fiscal year 2010. The Army also has responsibility for the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF), Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF), and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) appropriations. The Army budgets for recurring sustainment costs of JIEDDO with fiscal year 2011 funds at $200 million--an increase of $100 million from fiscal year 2010. The OCO Request will fund JIEDDO initiatives. The ISFF and ASFF are funded entirely through the OCO request. Compelling Needs Fund the Afghan Security Forces Fund and the Iraq Security Forces Fund to enable building essential security capacity. Support JIEDDO appropriations and initiatives to combat the most dangerous threat to U.S. forces. Continue the safe destruction of chemical agents and munitions and the closure activities at selected chemical demilitarization sites. Restoring Fiscal Balance Timely and full funding of the Army's fiscal year 2011 request of $245.6 billion will help ensure the Army is ready to meet the needs of the Nation and continue the process of restoring balance while setting the conditions for the future. Over the last 8 years, the Army has received significant portions of its funding for combat readiness through OCO appropriations. This recurring reliance on OCO funds and an overlap between base and OCO sustainment programs means that the Army's base budget does not fully cover the cost of both current and future readiness requirements. Because of this reliance, a precipitous drop or delay in OCO funding does not fully fund the readiness of our Army for the current conflict. Army continues the orderly restoration of the balance between base and OCO requirements in its fiscal year 2011 base budget request. This request fully funds Army authorized end strength and brings $965 million in O&M expenses back into the base rather than finance those requirements in OCO. addendum b--reserve component readiness Sections 517 and 521 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 1994 require the information in this addendum be reported. Section 517 requires a report relating to implementation of the pilot Program for Active Component Support of the Reserves under Section 414 of the NDAA 1992 and 1993. Section 521 requires a detailed presentation concerning the Army National Guard (ARNG), including information relating to implementation of the ARNG Combat Readiness Reform Act of 1992 (Title XI of Public Law 102-484, referred to in this addendum as ANGCRRA).

The number of waivers during the preceding fiscal year under section 1114(a) of ANGCRRA of any standard prescribed by the Secretary establishing a military education requirement for non-commissioned officers and the reason for each such waiver. --In fiscal year 2009, the ARNG had a total of 201 Noncommissioned Officers receive a military education waiver. As of September 30, 2009 all those waiver recipients were eligible for promotion to the next rank, but none have obtained the military education requirement that was previously waived. --In fiscal year 2009, the Army Reserve had a total of 331 Soldiers receive a military education waiver. Of these, 124 were SGTs in need of a waiver for Warrior Leader Course (WLC) as a result of being deployed or assigned to Warrior Transition Units (WTU) (Medical Hold or Medical Hold-Over Units) whose medical condition was incurred in direct support of Overseas Contingency Operations and who were otherwise eligible for promotion, if recommended. Furthermore, eligible Soldiers lacking the prerequisite level of military education due to operational deployment conflicts or the inability of the Army to schedule the course, were granted waivers. This included 173 Soldiers who were granted waivers for the Basic NCO Course (Now Advanced Leader Course) and 34 Soldiers who were granted waivers for the Advanced NCO Course (now Senior Leader Course). --The Secretary of the Army has delegated the authority for the waivers referred to in section 1114(a) of ANGCRRA to the Director, ARNG and to the Commander, U.S. Army Reserve Command. A majority of these waivers were approved due to the Soldiers being deployed and/or performing operational missions. Each reserve component maintains details for each waiver. 8. The number and distribution by grade, shown for each State, of personnel in the initial entry training and non-deployability personnel accounting category established under section 1115 of ANGCRRA for members of the Army National Guard who have not completed the minimum training required for deployment or who are otherwise not available for deployment. (A narrative summary of information pertaining to the Army Reserve is also provided.) --In fiscal year 2009, the ARNG had 61,812 Soldiers considered non- deployable for reasons outlined in Army Regulation 220-1, Unit Status Reporting (e.g., pending administrative/legal discharge or separation, medical non-availability, incomplete initial entry training, officer transition, unsatisfactory participation, or restrictions on the use or possession of weapons and ammunition under the Lautenberg Amendment). --In fiscal year 2009, the Army Reserve had 49,330 Soldiers considered non-deployable for reasons outlined in Army Regulation 220-1, Unit Status Reporting (e.g., pending administrative/legal discharge or separation, medical non- availability, incomplete initial entry training, officer transition, unsatisfactory participation, or restrictions on the use or possession of weapons and ammunition under the Lautenberg Amendment). 9. The number of members of the Army National Guard, shown for each State, that were discharged during the previous fiscal year pursuant to section 1115(c)(1) of ANGCRRA for not completing the minimum training required for deployment within 24 months after entering the National Guard. (Army Reserve data also reported.) --The number of ARNG Soldiers discharged during fiscal year 2009 pursuant to section 1115(c)(1) of ANGCRRA for not completing the minimum training required for deployment within 24 months after entering the Army National Guard is 141 officers and 15,105 enlisted Soldiers from all U.S. states and territories. The breakdown by each state is maintained by the NGB. --The number of Army Reserve Soldiers discharged during fiscal year 2009 for not completing the minimum training required for deployment within 24 months after entering the Army Reserve is 63 officers and 2,910 enlisted Soldiers. Soldiers who have not completed the required initial entry training within the first 24 months are discharged from the Army Reserve under AR 135- 178, Separation of Enlisted Personnel. Officers who have not completed a basic branch course within 36 months after commissioning are separated under AR 135-175, Separation of Officers. 10. The number of waivers, shown for each State, that were granted by the Secretary of the Army during the previous fiscal year under section 1115(c)(2) of ANGCRRA of the requirement in section 1115(c)(1) of ANGCRRA described in paragraph (9), together with the reason for each waiver. --In fiscal year 2009, no waivers were granted by the Secretary of the Army for the Army National Guard or the U.S. Army Reserve. 11. The number of Army National Guard members, shown for each State, (and the number of AR members), who were screened during the preceding fiscal year to determine whether they meet minimum physical profile standards required for deployment and, of those members: (a) the number and percentage that did not meet minimum physical profile standards for deployment; and (b) the number and percentage who were transferred pursuant to section 1116 of ANGCRRA to the personnel accounting category described in paragraph (8). --The number and percentage who did not meet minimum physical profile standards required for deployment: --In fiscal year 2009, 242,777 ARNG Soldiers underwent a Periodic Health Assessment (PHA) physical. Of these personnel 18,830 or 7.7 percent were identified for review due to a possible deployment limiting condition or failure to meet retention standards. --In fiscal year 2009, 115,133 Army Reserve Soldiers underwent a PHA physical. Of these personnel 21,505, or 18.68 percent were identified for review due to a possible deployment limiting condition or failure to meet retention standards. The fiscal year 2008-2009 increase is most attributable to PHA physicals now being required annually. --The number and percentage that were transferred pursuant to section 1116 of ANGCRRA to the personnel accounting category described in paragraph (8). --In fiscal year 2009, 18,830 ARNG Soldiers were transferred from deployable to nondeployable status for failing to meet medical deployability standards. This number includes Soldiers returning from a mobilization with a new medical condition and reflects an increase in the accuracy of electronic databases. --In fiscal year 2009, 21,505 Army Reserve Soldiers were considered non-available for deployment for failing to meet medical deployability standards. The new PHA physicals being required annually may account for the increase in those being found to be non-deployable. 12. The number of members and the percentage total membership of the Army National Guard shown for each State who underwent a medical screening during the previous fiscal year as provided in section 1117 of ANGCRRA. --Repealed.

The number of members and the percentage of the total membership of the Army National Guard shown for each State, over the age of 40 who underwent a full physical examination during the previous fiscal year for purposes of section 1117 of ANGCRRA. --Repealed. Public Law 104-106 (NDAA 1996), Div. A, Title VII, Section 704(b), February 10, 1996, repealed Section 1117 of ANGCRRA. 15. The number of units of the Army National Guard that are scheduled for early deployment in the event of a mobilization, and of those units, the number that are dentally ready for deployment in accordance with section 1118 of ANGCRRA. --Repealed. Public Law 104-106 (NDAA 1996), Div. A, Title VII, Section 704(b), February 10, 1996, repealed Section 1118 of ANGCRRA. 16. The estimated post-mobilization training time for each Army National Guard combat unit (and Army Reserve unit), and a description, displayed in broad categories and by State of what training would need to be accomplished for Army National Guard combat units (and AR units) in a post-mobilization period for purposes of section 1119 of ANGCRRA. --Per January 2007 direction from the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) reserve component unit mobilizations are limited to 400-day periods, including a 30-day post-mobilization leave and all post-mobilization training. --The most significant impact of this policy change is that many training tasks previously conducted during the first 3 to 6 months of mobilization have been identified for premobilization training, and units are training to standard on as many of these tasks as resources permit. Information on the type of training required by units during postmobilization is maintained by First Army. The data are not captured by state. --ARNG units strive to train in accordance with the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) process in order to prepare for operational missions and reduce post-mobilization training time. The ARFORGEN process requires increased resources for company-level training proficiency prior to mobilization. This training generally consists of individual warrior training tasks, weapons qualification and gunnery, battle staff training, and maneuver training. This is followed by theater- specific tasks and higher level collective training to complete the predeployment requirements for the unit's specific mission. The goal for post-mobilization training time for a brigade-size organization is approximately 60 days. --Post-mobilization training time is contingent upon the amount of certified pre-mobilization training conducted, the type of unit, and its assigned mission. In order to reduce post- mobilization training time, the ARNG has developed programs and products such as the ARNG Battle Command Training Capability, the eXportable Combat Training Capability (XCTC), training devices, and range complexes for our units. --The combination of programs and products, provide units with the capability to accomplish more during pre-mobilization training and therefore reduce post-mobilization training time. --The Army Reserve developed the Regional Training Center (RTC) concept in response to the SECDEF decision to restrict RC mobilizations to 1 year. These centers provide the capability for Army Reserve units to conduct training on Theater Specific Required Training (TSRT) to theater standards and conditions. The majority of training is on individual tasks but some collective training is also conducted. Because of certification by unit commanders, most of the training is not repeated in post-mobilization status. Exceptions are for tasks incorporated into other required training events and for convoy operations training. --The TSRT training is for units that will deploy to theater, including non-rotational forces (MTOE and TDA). Units mobilizing for CONUS based missions do not require this training. --Each RTC conducts standard rotations throughout the year although each has the capability to adjust training for selected large unit participation. Initially the Army Reserve provided a staff projection to DA that the training would require 17 days, but in actual implementation the training has required 21 days. --Army goals for post-mobilization training for Army Reserve headquarters and combat support/combat service support units range from 30 to 60 days. Post-mobilization training conducted by First Army typically consists of counterinsurgency operations, counter-improvised-explosive-device training, convoy live-fire exercises, theater orientation, rules of engagement/escalation-of-force training, and completion of any theater-specified training not completed during the pre- mobilization period. 17. A description of the measures taken during the preceding fiscal year to comply with the requirement in section 1120 of ANGCRRA to expand the use of simulations, simulators, and advanced training devices and technologies for members and units of the Army National Guard (and the Army Reserve). --During fiscal year 2009, the ARNG continued to synchronize the use of existing and ongoing live, virtual, and constructive training aids, devices, simulations and simulators (TADSS) programs with the training requirements of the ARFORGEN training model. By synchronizing the use of TADSS with ARFORGEN, the ARNG continues to improve unit training proficiency prior to mobilization. --To support the training requirements of M1A1 Abrams and M2A2 Bradley-equipped Brigade Combat Teams (BCT's), the ARNG continued the fielding of the Advanced Bradley Full-Crew Interactive Simulation Trainer, which provides full crew- simulations training for M2A2 units, Tabletop Full-fidelity Trainers for the M2A2, and the Conduct of Fire Trainer XXI for M1A1 and M2A2. When fully fielded, these devices, in addition to the Abrams Full-Crew Interactive Simulation Trainer XXI, will be the primary simulations trainers to meet the virtual gunnery requirements of M1A1 and M2A2 crews. --In order to meet the virtual-maneuver training requirements in the ARFORGEN process, M1A1 and M2A2 units use the Close-Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) and the Rehosted Simulations Network (SIMNET) XXI, in addition to the Rehosted SIMNET CCTT Core. The CCTT, SIMNET XXI, and SIMNET CCTT provide a mobile training capability to our dispersed units. --In order to train all ARNG units on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of convoy operations, the ARNG is fielding the Virtual Convoy Operations Trainer (VCOT). The VCOT, through the use of geo-specific databases, provides commanders with a unique and critical mission rehearsal tool. Currently, 32 VCOT systems are positioned in the ARNG force to train units on the fundamentals of convoy operations. --In order to meet basic and advanced rifle marksmanship requirements, the ARNG is fielding the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST 2000). This system is the Army's approved marksmanship-training device. The ARNG is also continuing use of its previously procured Fire Arms Training System (FATS) until EST 2000 fielding is complete. The EST 2000 and FATS are also used to provide unit collective tactical training for dismounted Infantry, Special Operations Forces, Scouts, Engineer, and Military Police squads, as well as combat support and combat service support elements. These systems also support units conducting vital homeland defense missions. --The ARNG supplements its marksmanship-training strategy with the Laser Marksmanship Training System (LMTS). The ARNG currently has over 900 systems fielded down to the company level. The LMTS is a laser-based training device that replicates the firing of the Soldier's weapon without live ammunition. It is utilized for developing and sustaining marksmanship skills, diagnosing and correcting marksmanship problems, and assessing basic and advanced skills. --The ARNG has further developed its battle command training capability through the three designated Battle Command Training Centers (BCTCs) at Fort Leavenworth, Camp Dodge, and Fort Indiantown Gap, and the Distributed Battle Simulation Program (DBSP). BCTCs provide the backbone of the program as collective hubs in the battle command training strategy. The DBSP provides Commanders assistance from Commander's Operational Training Assistants, TADSS facilitators, and Technical Support Teams. BCTCs and the DBSP collectively help units in the planning, preparation, and execution of simulations-based battle staff training that augments the Department of the Army-directed Warfighter Exercises and greatly enhances battle staff and unit proficiency. --In order to provide the critical culminating training event of ARFORGEN, the ARNG has implemented the XCTC. The XCTC program provides the method to certify that ARNG combat units have achieved company-level maneuver proficiency prior to mobilization. The XCTC incorporates the use of advanced live, virtual, and constructive training technologies to replicate the training experience until now only found at one of the Army's Combat Training Centers. The centerpiece of the XCTC is the Deployable Force-on-Force Instrumented Range System (DFIRST). DFIRST utilizes training technologies that allow for full instrumentation of the training area from major combat systems down to the individual Soldier, role player, and Civilian on the battlefield. --The most important part of every training exercise is the After- Action Review (AAR). By full instrumentation of the units, Soldiers, and training areas, units receive an AAR complete with two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and video playback of the actual training exercise. This allows Commanders and Soldiers to see what occurred during the training exercise from a different perspective, further enhancing the training experience. --The Army Reserve continues to leverage--to the extent resources permit--TADSS into its training program. Implementation of Army Campaign Plan Decision Point 72 continues with establishment of the 75th Battle Command Training Division (BCTD) (Provisional). This division, with five battle command training brigades, employs legacy constructive simulations to provide battle command and staff training to Army Reserve and Army National Guard battalion and brigade commanders and staffs during pre- mobilization and post-mobilization. The concept plan as well as requirements for supporting Army battle command systems and simulations drivers for the 75th BCTD is pending Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) approval. --The Army Reserve continues to partner with the Program Executive Office, Simulations, Training and Instrumentation; Training and Doctrine Command agencies; and HQDA to define TADSS requirements for combat support and combat service support units. The 75th BCTD is on the Entity-level Resolution Federation (ERF) fielding plan. The ERF provides a high- resolution (e.g., individual Soldier-level fidelity aggregated to un"
