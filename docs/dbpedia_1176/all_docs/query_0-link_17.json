        "text": "Suicide rates have been steadily increasing since 1999 (Curtin, Warner, & Hedegaard, 2016) to become the 10th leading cause of death in the United States (Kochanek, Murphy, Xu, & Arias, 2017; Murphy, Xu, Kochanek, Curtin, & Arias, 2017), resulting in over $50 billion in estimated medical bills and lost wages per year (Florence, Simon, Haegerich, Luo, & Zhou, 2015). Since the 1950s, the overall U.S. military suicide rate has been lower than the U.S. civilian rate (Cassimatis & Rothberg, 1997; Nock et al., 2013; Rothberg, Ursano, & Holloway, 1987). However, in 2004 there was a sharp increase in the military rate which continued to rise; those rates more than doubled from 2001 to 2009 (Bachynski et al., 2012; S. A. Black et al., 2011), surpassing the civilian rate in 2008 (Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center [AFHSC], 2012a; S. A. Black, Gallaway, Bell, & Ritchie, 2011). These facts make it imperative to identify malleable points of intervention to detect and reduce suicide among Service Members.\n\nIt has been widely documented in the general population literature that there is a strong association between psychiatric diagnosis and death by suicide (Cavanagh, Carson, Sharpe, & Lawrie, 2003) and between psychiatric diagnosis and other suicidal behaviors, regardless of socio-demographic factors and country of residence (Nock et al., 2008a). Some authors even suggest that suicide decedents are exclusively individuals with mental illness (Joiner, 2005; Joiner, Buchman-Schmitt, & Chu, 2017; Nock et al., 2008b; Robins, Murphy, Wilkinson, Gassner, & Kayes, 1959). The same patterns can be found in the military as well. Mental health diagnosis has been shown to have the strongest association with suicidal risk, thoughts, behaviors, and deaths (Bachynski et al., 2012; LeardMann et al., 2013; Shen, Cunha, & Williams, 2016; Stein & Ursano, 2013). In the military, being male (LeardMann et al., 2013), lower rank (E1-E4), younger (Bachynski et al., 2012; S. A. Black et al., 2011) and with a history of self-harm (Shen et al., 2016) all increase the risk for suicide substantially. Besides these risk factors, numerous life stressors have been identified that also increase military suicide risk: relationship problems (AFHSC, 2012b; S. A. Black et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2016), history of deployment (S. A. Black et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2016), separation from the military, and history of law violations (Shen et al., 2016).\n\nIn spite of the strong association between psychiatric disorder and the risk for suicide death and suicide attempts (SAs), the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders among U.S. military suicide decedents is not well understood. The magnitude of psychiatric disorder within the U.S. military has been assessed through various methods with varying 12-month prevalence estimates reported by different studies. Gadermann and colleagues (2012) predicted 27% prevalence of any psychiatric disorder within the Army through simulation modeling. A Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored review of Army medical records found 25.4% prevalence of any psychiatric disorder when averaged across years 2005–2015 (Deployment Health Clinical Center [DHCC], 2017). In other studies, Riddle et al. (2007) found 18.3% prevalence of any psychiatric disorder among U.S. military Service Members from the Millennium Cohort for years 2001–2003 while Black and colleagues found 15.5% prevalence of any psychiatric disorder from medical record data in the years 2001–2009 among Army personnel (S. A. Black, Gallaway, Bell, & Ritchie, 2011).\n\nThere are indications that the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the Army increased substantially in the early 2000s evidenced by a near doubling of psychiatric ambulatory visits from 2000 to 2008 (Bachynski et al., 2012). This was consistent with findings by Hyman, Ireland, Frost, and Cottrell (2012) that prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses increased across the military in the period 2005–2007 along with increases in psychiatric medication prescriptions and mental health visits. Further, studies that sought to determine age of onset for psychiatric disorder among Army soldiers found a high proportion with onset prior to age of enlistment indicating the majority of soldiers with psychiatric disorders likely enter the military with an existing disorder. Based on national data weighted to reflect the sociodemographic profile of the Army, Gaderman et al. (2012) estimate that age of onset for psychiatric disorder precedes age of enlistment for more than 90% of soldiers with lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Similarly, Kessler et al. (2014) found nearly 80% of soldiers with current psychiatric disorders reported onset before enlistment. Taken together, these data suggest there is a significant and growing proportion of soldiers who enter the military with psychiatric disorder, increasing the risk over time for suicide behaviors within the Army.\n\nGiven these prevalence data, better insight into the distribution of mental health conditions among suicidal soldiers and soldiers who attempt or die by suicide could inform military suicide prevention efforts. Gibson, Corrigan, Kateley, Watkins, and Pecko (2017) found the yearly prevalence for any psychiatric diagnosis before the event was 59.3% for suicide deaths and 74.3% for SAs or non-fatal self-injury when averaged across years 2014–2016. Gibson et al. (2017) also reported that the most frequent DSM-IV diagnoses among soldiers who died by suicide during this time were for disorders of adjustment (40.3%), mood (34.3%), substance use (27.7%), anxiety-except PTSD (23%), PTSD (16%), personality (5%), and psychosis (2.3%). The most frequent diagnoses among soldiers who attempted suicide during this time were for disorders of adjustment (58.6%), mood (47.3%), anxiety-except PTSD (33%), substance use (26.7%), PTSD (19%), personality (7.3%), and psychosis (2%).\n\nConsidering mental health disorders as a strong predictor for death by suicide, previous research has identified a robust association between personality disorders and self-directed violence (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2003). It has been estimated that about 30–40% of individuals in the general population who die by suicide and 40% of individuals who make a SA were diagnosed with personality disorder (APA, 2003; Duberstein & Conwell, 1997). Of those personality disorders, borderline personality disorder (BPD) presents one of the highest risks for suicide (Leichsenring, Leibing, Kruse, New, & Leweke, 2011; Oldham, 2006) – approximately 50 times higher than in general population (APA, 2001). In fact, it is one of only two disorders that explicitly includes suicidal behavior as a part of the diagnostic criterion (APA, 2013; D. W. Black, Blum, Pfohl, & Hale, 2004).\n\nBPD is estimated to occur in 2% of the general population and most individuals who meet criteria for BPD are women (APA, 2001). BPD is mainly characterized by dysfunction of the emotion regulation system (Linehan, 1993) which is expressed by some key diagnostic criteria, such as a pervasive pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships, affect, and self-image, in addition to marked impulsivity (APA, 2001). The severity of these symptoms and especially impulsivity has been found to pose an increased risk for suicide and SAs (APA, 2003). Most individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) will attempt suicide (APA, 2001) and about 10% will eventually die by suicide (D. W. Black, Blum, Pfohl, & Hale, 2004). Additionally, results of meta-analysis focusing on self-injuries and SAs showed that BPD has a stronger association with SA than any other mental health disorder (Victor & Klonsky, 2014). The distinction between suicidal patients with BPD and without the diagnosis could be explained by negative affective states. Mou and colleagues (2018) found that these negative affective states, such as feelings of abandonment, desperation, guilt, hopelessness, loneliness, rage, self-hatred, and upset, were more strongly associated with suicidal ideation among suicidal patients diagnosed with BPD than among suicidal patients without BPD. It appears that some of the key characteristics of BPD diagnosis exacerbate patient’s suicidality. As BPD poses a high risk for suicidality independently, the presence of psychiatric comorbidity elevates this risk even more (D. W. Black et al., 2004). The suicide risk is particularly high with comorbid disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders (APA, 2003; D. W. Black et al., 2004).\n\nThe diagnosis of BPD (and other personality disorders) does not result from a unitary set of symptoms. Some studies have identified meaningful subgroups or subtypes to be discerned among BPD (Hallquist & Pilkonis, 2012; Smits et al., 2017) and Hallquist and Pilkonis (2012) also showed that these subgroups can differ in severity of the diagnosis. The current classification system for personality disorders was introduced with the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III; APA, 1980) and has been the subject of considerable debate. Classification within the DSM is categorical; disorders are present or absent dependent on whether diagnostic criteria exceed a threshold number. Classification is also polythetic such that a subset of total criteria can be sufficient to meet diagnostic requirements. BPD is defined by nine diagnostic criteria of which any five or more may form the diagnosis among 256 possible combinations, while any two individuals diagnosed as BPD might share only one diagnostic criterion (Smits et al., 2017). In addition to heterogeneity of criteria within diagnostic categories, uncertain validity of criteria thresholds poses a problem for polythetic-categorical diagnoses (Krueger & Bezdjian, 2009; Morey & Skodol, 2013). Both issues were evident in a large clinical sample studied by Johansen, Karterud, Pedersen, Gude, and Falkum (2004). They found 136 combinations of five or more BPD criteria among 252 BPD patients, and among the total sample of 930 personality disorder patients there was no distinct threshold for number of BPD criteria between those with or without BPD.\n\nLikewise, Karukivi, Vahlberg, Horjamo, Nevalainen, and Korkeila (2017) found that personality difficulties just below diagnostic thresholds in a clinical sample were significantly associated with marked psychiatric symptoms and negative effects on subjective well-being with impairments equal to actually diagnosed single personality disorders. These findings are supportive of a more dimensional view of personality disorders expressed in the alternative model for personality disorders appearing in the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5; APA, 2013; Oldham, 2015). Additionally, the count of criteria met seems to play a role in regards to suicidality. In his study of BPD inpatients who were followed from 10 to 23 years after discharge, Stone (1989) reported that patients with eight DSM-III criteria had a suicide rate of 36% as opposed to 7% for those who met five to seven criteria. Similar analyses have not been conducted in clinical samples of suicidal military personnel. Such data could illuminate the frequency of BPD diagnosis and distribution of diagnostic criteria among suicidal soldiers, as well as contribute insight into clinical significance of salient, albeit sub-threshold BPD criteria among suicidal personnel.\n\nAs BPD has not been widely studied among Service Members, little is known about the prevalence of BPD disorder or traits among military community and clinical samples. Individuals are required to undergo a review of medical screening forms and a general psychiatric evaluation (Cardona & Ritchie, 2007) which are to identify individuals with certain conditions that could be disqualifying for military accession (DoD, 2016). Current or history of BPD and history of suicide, including SAs, suicidal gestures, and self-mutilating behaviors, are exclusion criteria during the recruitment of military personnel (DoD, 2011). The crucial point here to note is that the screening solely relies on disclosures by the applicant to questions embedded in a series of medical history questionnaires that query for history of symptoms and treatment for psychiatric disorder. Self-disclosures of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and attempts have been historically underreported, as individuals tend to conceal these facts due to fear of stigmatization and/or to avoid involuntary hospitalization (Chiurliza et al., 2018; Nock et al., 2013; Sudak, Maxim, & Carpenter, 2008). We can then speculate whether military applicants might be motivated to conceal their mental health history due to fear of being declined from the military. Few data are publicly available to evaluate the effectiveness of military pre-accession screening procedures. However, a review by the Institute of Medicine (Denning, Meisnere, & Warner, 2014) noted that non-validated procedures in use for pre-accession screening had limited effectiveness and various studies have found psychiatric disorder to be a leading cause of early attrition from military service including discharge during basic training (Hoge et al., 2002; Hoge et al., 2003; Niebuhr, Powers, Krauss, Cuda, & Johnson, 2006). These findings occur within a context that most psychiatric disorders among military members have an onset that predates their enlistment (Gaderman et al., 2012; Kessler et al., 2014), suggesting that service members diagnosed with BPD during military service likely entered the military with BPD or a co-occurring psychiatric disorder. Thus, evidence concerning the prevalence and scope of BPD symptoms among Service Members, including limited information concerning BPD as a risk factor for suicide among military personnel, is limited by these factors.\n\nTo date, there are two peer-reviewed articles examining BPD in active duty military. In his psychoanalytic perspective, Bird (1980) presents two case studies of army officers who experienced a “breakdown” one of which resulted in a SA. Despite Bird’s accurate descriptions of BPD symptomology in these officers, his conclusions that the Army can remedy those symptoms by standing in as a parent figure and as their only security have not been empirically investigated. Another study (Chu, Buchman-Schmitt, Joiner, & Rudd, 2017) examined personality disorder symptoms in active duty high-risk military members and found a puzzling subgroup of soldiers who present low desire and yet high plans for suicide. However, this subgroup was not found to have significantly greater symptoms of BPD, as the authors hypothesized. This study did not further explore the diagnosis of BPD in this active military sample. Thus, there is much to learn regarding the presence of BPD and its consequences in the military.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to bridge this gap in the literature. As part of a larger study concerning suicidal ideation and self-directed violence in the US Army, this secondary data analysis compared and contrasted active duty suicidal soldiers who did and did not meet DSM-IV criteria for BPD. This analysis sought to characterize the presence-absence of each BPD diagnostic criterion and lifetime history of self-directed violence in a suicidal military sample that included soldiers who did and did not meet BPD criteria. It was hypothesized that suicidal soldiers with more BPD criteria would be more likely to have engaged in self-directed violence, including lifetime counts of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and attempted suicide, compared to suicidal peers with fewer BPD criteria.\n\nResults\n\nApproximately one-quarter (n = 38, 27.7%, 95% CI = 20.2% to 35.2%) of the suicidal soldiers in this active duty sample met full diagnostic criteria for BPD. As is reported in , participants with BPD were on average younger than those without BPD, and less likely to have ever been married. Participants with BPD also reported lower military rank compared to those without BPD, which was consistent with the BPD subsample being younger. All psychiatric comorbidities for participants in this sample are reported in . Participants’ BPD diagnostic status (i.e., presence-absence) was associated with any current (i.e., past month) psychiatric comorbidities (χ2(1)=10.92, p=.001), such that participants with BPD were more likely to meet criteria for more than one disorder. However, there was not a statistically significant association between BPD diagnosis and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity (χ2(1)=3.73, p=.053), although this association approached significance, and indicated a similar pattern to current comorbidity status.\n\nTable 1\n\nBPDNo-BPDOverallSociodemographicsn(%)n(%)N(%)pdAge in years, M(SD)24.63(5.0)27.6(6.0)26.8(5.9).007Male gender29(76.3)85(85.9)114(83.2).205Ethnicity a White/Caucasian23(60.5)47(47.5)70(51.1) Black or African American9(23.7)23(23.2)32(23.4) Puerto Rican1(2.6)8(8.1)9(6.6) Other5(13.1)16(16.1)21(15.4).532Sexual Orientation b Heterosexual29(76.3)84(84.8)113(82.5) Bisexual7(18.4)9(9.0)16(11.6) Homosexual1(2.6)2(2.0)3(2.2).314Marital Status c Married13(34.2)53(53.5)66(48.2) Single, never married19(50.0)18(18.2)37(27.0) Separated4(10.5)20(20.2)24(17.5) Divorced07(7.1)7(5.1) Widowed01(1.0)1(7)<.001eNumber of children, M(SD).77(1.2)17(15)1.45(1.5).001Education High school or GED20(52.6)37(37.4)57(41.5) Some college, associate’s degree, or technical training15(39.5)52(52.5)67(48.9) Bachelor’s or graduate degree2(5.2)9(9.1)11(8.0).222Rank Junior enlisted (E1-E4)36(94.6)62(62.5)98(71.5)<.001f Noncommissioned officer (E5–E9)2(5.3)33(33.3)35(25.6) Officer (W2–O3)04(4.0)4(2.9)Number of combat deployments 025(65.8)33(33.3)58(42.3) 19(23.7)24(24.2)33(24.1) 23(7.9)23(23.2)26(19.0) 3 or more1(2.6)18(18.l)19(13.9).002\n\nTable 2\n\nComorbid DiagnosisBPDNo-BPDOveralln(%)n(%)N(%)LifetimeCurrentLifetimeCurrentLifetimeCurrentBipolar I disorder2(5.3)1(2.6)1(10)1(10)3(2.2)2(1.5)Bipolar II disorder1(2.6)1(2.6)2(2.0)2(2.0)3(2.2)3(2.2)MDD28(73.7)20(52.6)82(82.8)62(62.6)110(80.3)82(69.9)Dysthymic disorder3(7.9)-4(4.0)-7(5.1)-Schizophrenia000000Alcohol disorder22(57.9)7(18.4)46(46.5)12(12.1)68(49.6)19(13.9)Alcohol abuse6(15.8)2(5.3)9(9.1)2(2.0)15(10.9)4(2.9)Drug dependence10(26.3)2(5.3)16(16.2)3(3.0)26(19.0)5(3.6)Drug abuse8(21.1)023(23.2)1(10)31(22.6)1(7)Panic disorder20(52.6)12(31.6)41(41.4)27(27.3)61(44.5)39(28.5)Social phobia7(18.4)6(15.8)13(13.1)12(12.1)20(14.6)18(13.1)OCD2(5.3)2(5.3)4(4.0)4(4.0)6(4.4)6(4.4)PTSD22(57.9)17(44.7)62(62.6)52(52.5)84(61.3)69(50.4)GAD-11(28.9)-15(15.2)-26(19.0)Acute stress disorder-1(2.6)-0-1(7)Adjustment disorder-3(7.9)-14(14.1)-17(12.4)Any comorbidity37(97.4)35(92.1)85(85.9)63(63.6)122(89.1)98(71.5)\n\nDetailed information concerning participants’ past history of self-directed violence, stratified by diagnostic status, is reported in .

The quilt plot in demonstrates greater presence of particular criteria with darker shades of blue, which allows one to observe patterns across clinical subgroups, including participants with and without past history of attempted suicide or NSSI. The presence of BPD criteria was generally consistent across subgroups, except for the marked difference in criterion 5, which reflected the nature of the subgroups included. For participants with past history of NSSI or attempted suicide, efforts to avoid abandonment were somewhat more common among those with BPD. The reverse of this pattern was found among those who did not meet BPD criteria: efforts to avoid abandonment were less common among those with past NSSI. There was also a higher proportion of participants who met the impulsivity criterion among those with past history of NSSI or attempted suicide, though chronic feelings of emptiness were less common among participants who previously engaged in self-directed violence. The total proportion of participants who met each of the BPD criteria are also presented, and indicate that soldiers without BPD reported non-trivial experiences of BPD criteria, including near one-third who met the impulsivity and/or paranoid ideation or severe dissociation criteria.\n\nTo elucidate the patterns of BPD criteria counts among soldiers who did not meet the threshold for a diagnosis of BPD, criteria counts were graphed and are presented in . As demonstrates, relatively few particpants were subthreshold with three or four criteria. This suggests that the distinction between those with and without a BPD diagnosis is not confounded by a substantial number of subthreshold or marginal cases of BPD criteria that would be potentially prone to misclassification.\n\nIn a hurdle model (see ) calculated to test the association between BPD criteria count (i.e., total number of diagnostic criteria) and lifetime counts of NSSI, BPD diagnosis was a significant predictor of the odds of reporting any NSSI (Logistic regression portion, OR=1.23, p=.005), above and beyond the effects of age (0R=0.92, p=.024) and gender (0R=0.61, p=.300). Thus, a one criterion increase in BPD symptoms was associated with a 23 percent increase in the odds of having any lifetime NSSI. The number of BPD criteria also predicted greater lifetime counts of NSSI (Counts portion, 0R=1.36, p=.026), above and beyond age (0R=0.98, p=.834) and gender (0R=85, p=.828). This indicated that there was a 36 percent increase in the number of counts of NSSI for each one criterion increase in BPD symptoms.\n\nTable 4\n\nVariableLogistic regression portionCounts portionbeta(SE)OR (95% CI)pbeta(SE)RR (95% CI)pDependent variable: lifetime count of NSSIAge−.08(.04).92 (.86 to .99).024−.02(.08).98 (.85 to 1.14).834Gender−.50(.48).61 (.23 to 1.56).300−.16(.74).85 (.20 to 3.61).828BPD criteria count.20(.07)1.23 (1.06 to 1.42).005.31(14)1.36 (1.04 to 1.78).026Dependent variable: lifetime count of suicide attemptsaAge−0.07(.03).93 (.87 to .99).029---Gender−0.13(.47).88 (.35 to 2.20).781---BPD criteria count0.10(.07)1.10 (.96 to 1.26).156---\n\nBinary logistic regression was used to test the association between BPD criteria count and odds of any SA. There was not significant association between BPD criteria and ever attempting suicide (0R=1.10, p=.156), above and beyond the influence of age (0R=0.93, p=.029) and gender (0R=0.88, p=.781).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study demonstrated a large proportion of suicidal soldiers met diagnostic criteria for BPD, which was surprising given the low prevalence of any personality disorder in military medical records of soldiers who attempt or die by suicide. Further, our findings report in-detail the socio-demographic, clinical, and self-directed violence-related characteristics of suicidal soldiers with and without BPD. Consistent with the interpersonal and professional difficulties associated with BPD, suicidal soldiers with BPD were less likely to be married, reported lower military rank, and fewer deployments. These factors may reflect the impact of BPD symptoms, but may also be reflective of the younger age of soldiers with BPD. Also consistent with defined symptoms of BPD, the soldiers’ number of BPD symptoms was associated with increased odds of NSSI, and a higher number of counts of NSSI, if any. There was not a significant effect of BPD symptoms upon the odds of attempting suicide, which may indicate that this association is not as strong as the association between BPD symptoms and NSSI in this population. However, it may also be due to the relatively modest sample size included in this study, and the relatively low base rate of suicidal behavior.\n\nThe high prevalence of BPD found in this study was derived using a broadband clinical assessment of DSM Axis I and II disorder, including comprehensive assessment of each BPD symptom. This practice may not represent the typical approach in military clinics. Since personality disorder diagnosis can be the basis for an involuntary non-medical separation (DoD, 2016), providers may refrain from giving a DSM IV Axis II diagnoses when an Axis I diagnosis is given. This would be consistent with the high co-morbidity of BPD and other diagnoses within this sample. Additional study is needed to understand the extent to which our finding is representative of suicidal Service Members or Service Members in general.\n\nThe true prevalence of BPD among suicidal soldiers is relevant for planning effective treatment interventions. BPD is refractory to many psychological treatments which are often ineffective for mitigating suicide risk among BPD patients (e.g., Linehan, 1993) but can benefit from a range of evidence-based practices such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Mentalization Based Therapy. The high number of soldiers who attempt or die by suicide after receiving psychological treatment from the Army is an important quality of care issue. There is limited information about diagnostic and clinical assessments by Army providers of suicidal soldiers or their treatment outcomes from psychological interventions that precede SAs or deaths. The association of self-injury and BPD diagnosis in this sample supports the benefit of routine structured and comprehensive assessment for diagnosis of a personality disorder or diagnostic traits among suicidal soldiers who present for medical treatment. Under-diagnosis of BPD or clinically-significant BPD criteria could result in untreated maintaining factors for durable patterns of self-directed violence that are consistent with BPD symptoms. This may be particularly important among soldiers with elevated suicidality who receive BH care.\n\nFurther study of the prevalence of covert (i.e., undisclosed and/or untreated) self-directed violence among suicidal soldiers receiving BH treatment and potential missed opportunities for more effective suicide risk mitigation are suggested by these findings. The significant association between BPD diagnosis and NSSI is important to consider as a potential contributor to long-term risk of other forms of self-directed violence (e.g., Klonsky, May, & Glenn, 2013). While these findings did not indicate a significant association between BPD diagnosis and any history of attempted suicide, there could be military unique factors at play. Military pre-accession screening does not directly evaluate applicants for personality disorder, but it does screen for history of SAs. Given that approximately 80% of suicide attempters have one or more psychiatric disorders (Nock, Hwang, Sampson, & Kessler, 2009), applicants who are screened out for SA likely decrease the prevalence of existing or prodromal BPD by some degree and perhaps selects out those with higher severity BPD. Also, there may be military unique protective factors.\n\nIn addition to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, hallmarks of BPD include emotional dysregulation and unstable sense of identity. The military provides considerable lifestyle structure that externally organizes daily activities and longer-term planning. The military also has strong markers of identity and interpersonal boundaries in the form of rank, duty position, and unit affiliation that are reinforced by wear of the uniform, social traditions, and military customs and courtesies. For some persons with BPD, aspects of the military such as these may provide stabilizing counterbalance to vulnerabilities inherent to BPD that otherwise could manifest in suicidal ideation and urge for self-harm.\n\nClinically, military treatment providers may want to more directly assess and treat BPD to reduce suicide risk, improve occupational functioning and reduce subjective distress of soldiers with BPD. This might be done by the implementation of evidence-based BPD-specific interventions such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mentalization Based Therapy or another well-structured long-term psychotherapy which have been shown to be effective in reducing suicide risk (Cristea et al., 2017; DeCou, Comtois, & Landes, 2018). When a full evidence-based model is not feasible, key principles from these therapies can be used to assess, manage, and resolve suicidality (Carmel, Sung, Jeff, & Comtois, Kate, 2018). For instance, the Biosocial Theory of BPD (Linehan, 1993) suggests that BPD is the result of a series of transactions over the individual’s history between a biological vulnerability to emotional sensitivity and reactivity and an environment that is pervasively invalidating and oversimplifies difficulty. As Linehan proposes, treatment providers of BPD patients should focus on providing skills in emotion regulation and distress tolerance to address biological vulnerability, and provide validation of patient’s emotions and thoughts and teach interpersonal effectiveness skills to mitigate the negative impact of invalidating environments.\n\nLimitations\n\nThese findings are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data, which do not support causal inference. This is balanced by the methods undertaken to ensure standardized interview-based assessments using valid and reliable instruments. Further, our findings may not be generalizable to other samples of military personnel who did not experience suicidality, or suicidal personnel who did not present for treatment services. Additionally, although the study assessor went through rigorous training in administering the structured interviews, they were not a licensed clinician, which could have potentially impeded the accuracy of the diagnoses. Given that this was a secondary analysis project, our analyses are not powered to detect attempted suicide, which is a low base rate behavior. Finally, this study did not employ probabilistic sampling, and thus does not offer an estimate as to any true prevalence of BPD among soldiers in general, or suicidal soldiers in particular. Nonetheless, the relatively large proportion of soldiers with BPD noted suggests the need for such studies in the future."
