        "text": "On October 19, 2003, the Ohio-based newspaper the Toledo Blade launched a four-day series of investigative reports exposing a string of atrocities by an elite, volunteer, 45-man \"Tiger Force\" unit of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division over the course of seven months in 1967. The Blade goes on to state that in 1971 the Army began a four and a half year investigation of the alleged torture of prisoners, rapes of civilian women, the mutilation of bodies and killing of anywhere from nine to well over one hundred unarmed civilians, among other acts. The articles further report that the Army's inquiry concluded that eighteen U.S. soldiers committed war crimes ranging from murder and assault to dereliction of duty. However, not one of the soldiers, even of those still on active duty at the time of the investigation, was ever court martialed in connection with the heinous crimes. Moreover, six suspected war criminals were allowed to resign from military service during the criminal investigations specifically to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe Toledo Blade articles represent some of the best reporting on a Vietnam War crime by any newspaper, during or since the end of the conflict. Unfortunately, the articles tell a story that was all too common. As a historian writing his dissertation on U.S. war crimes and atrocities during the Vietnam War, I have been immersed in just the sort of archival materials the Toledo Blade used in its pieces, but not simply for one incident but hundreds if not thousands of analogous events. I can safely, and sadly, say that the \"Tiger Force\" atrocities are merely the tip of the iceberg in regard to U.S.-perpetrated war crimes in Vietnam. However, much of the mainstream historical literature dealing with Vietnam War atrocities (and accompanying cover-ups and/or sham investigations), has been marginalized to a great extent -- aside from obligatory remarks concerning the My Lai massacre, which is, itself, often treated as an isolated event. Unfortunately, the otherwise excellent reporting of the Toledo Blade draws upon and feeds off this exceptionalist argument to a certain extent. As such, the true scope of U.S.-perpetrated atrocities is never fully addressed in the articles. The men of the \"Tiger Force\" are labeled as \"Rogue GIs\" and the authors simply mention the that Army \"conducted 242 war-crimes investigations in Vietnam, [that] a third were substantiated, leading to 21 convictions... according to a review of records at the National Archives\" -- facts of dubious value that obscure the scope and number of war crimes perpetrated in Vietnam and feed the exceptionalist argument.\n\nEven an accompanying Blade piece on \"Other Vietnam Atrocities,\" tends to decontextualize the \"Tiger Force\" incidents, treating them as fairly extraordinary events by listing only three other relatively well known atrocity incidents: former Senator, presidential candidate and Navy SEAL Bob Kerrey's raid on the hamlet of Thang Phong; the massacre at Son Thang -- sometimes referred to as the \"Marine Corps' My Lai\"; and the war crimes allegations of Lt. Col. Anthony Herbert -- most famously chronicled in his memoir Soldier. This short list, however, doesn't even hint at the scope and number of similar criminal acts.\n\nFor example, the Toledo Blade reports that its \"review of thousands of classified Army documents, National Archives records, and radio logs reveals [the \"Tiger Force\"] ... carried out the longest series of atrocities in the Vietnam War [from May and November, 1967]....\" Unfortunately, this seven month atrocity-spree is not nearly the longest on record. Nor is it even the longest string of atrocities by one unit within its service branch. According to formerly classified Army documents, an investigation disclosed that from at least March 1968 through October 1969, \"Vietnamese [civilian] detainees were subjected to maltreatment\" by no less than twenty-three separate interrogators of the 172d Military Intelligence (MI) Detachment. The inquiry found that, in addition to using \"electrical shock by means of a field telephone,\" an all too commonly used method of torture by Americans during the war, MI personnel also struck detainees with their fists, sticks and boards and employed a form of water torture which impaired prisoners' ability to breath.\n\nSimilar to the \"Tiger Force\" atrocities chronicled by the Blade, documents indicate that no disciplinary actions were taken against any of the individuals implicated in the long-running series of atrocities, including 172d MI personnel Norman Bowers, Franciszek Pyclik and Eberhard Gasper who were all on active duty at the time that the allegations were investigated by Army officials. In fact, in 1972, Bowers's commanding general pronounced that \"no disciplinary or administrative action\" would be taken against the suspected war criminal and in a formerly classified memorandum to the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, prepared by Colonel Murray Williams on behalf of Brigadier General R.G. Gard in January 1973, it was noted that the \"...determination by commanders to take no action against three personnel on active duty who were suspected of committing an offense\" had not been publicly acknowledged. Their crimes and identities kept a secret, Bowers, Pyclik and Gasper apparently escaped any prosecution, let alone punishment, for their alleged actions.\n\nSimilarly, the Toledo Blade pays particular attention to Sam Ybarra, a \"notorious suspect,\" who was named in seven of the thirty \"Tiger Force\" war crimes allegations investigated by the Army -- including the rape and fatal stabbing of a 13-year-old girl and the brutal killing of a 15-year-old boy. Yet, Ybarra's notorious reputation may well pale in comparison to that of Sergeant Roy E. \"the Bummer\" Bumgarner, a soldier who served with the 1st Cavalry Division and later the 173d Airborne Brigade. According to a former commander, \"the Bummer\" was rumored to have \"personally killed over 1,500 people\" during a forty-two week stretch in Vietnam. Even if the number was exaggerated, clues on how Bumgarner may have obtained high \"body counts\" came to light in the course of an Army criminal investigation of an incident that took place on February 25, 1969. According to investigation documents, Bumgarner and a subordinate rounded up three civilians found working in a rice paddy, marched them to a secluded area and murdered them. \"The Bummer\" then arranged the bodies on the ground with their heads together and a grenade was exploded next to them in an attempt to cover-up their crime. Assorted weapons were then planted near the mutilated corpses to make them appear to have been enemy troops.\n\nDuring an Army criminal investigation of the incident, men in Bumgarner's unit told investigators that they had heard rumors of the sergeant carrying out similar acts in the past. Said one soldier in a sworn statement to Army investigators:\n\n\"I've heard of Bumgarner doing it before -- planting weapons on bodies when there is doubt as to their military status. I've heard quite a few rumors about Bumgarner killing unarmed people. Only a couple weeks ago I heard that Bumgarner had killed a Vietnamese girl and two younger kids (boys), who didn't have any weapons.\"\n\nUnlike Sam Ybarra, who had been discharged from the military by the time the allegations against him came to light and then refused to cooperate with investigators, \"the Bummer\" was charged with premeditated murder and tried by general court martial. He was convicted only of manslaughter and his punishment consisted merely of a demotion in rank and a fine of $97 a month for six months. Moreover, after six months, Bumgarner promptly re-enlisted in the Army. His first and only choice of assignments -- Vietnam. Records indicate he got his wish!\n\nMilitary records demonstrate that the \"Tiger Force\" atrocities are only the tip of a vast submerged history of atrocities in Vietnam. In fact, while most atrocities were likely never chronicled or reported, the archival record is still rife with incidents analogous to those profiled in the Blade articles, including the following atrocities chronicled in formerly classified Army documents:\n\nA November 1966 incident in which an officer in the Army's Fourth Infantry Division, severed an ear from a Vietnamese corpse and affixed it to the radio antenna of a jeep as an ornament. The officer was given a non-judicial punishment and a letter of reprimand.\n\nAn August 1967 atrocity in which a 13-year-old Vietnamese child was raped by American MI interrogator of the Army's 196th Infantry Brigade. The soldier was convicted only of indecent acts with a child and assault. He served seven months and sixteen days for his crime.\n\nA September 1967 incident in which an American sergeant killed two Vietnamese children -- executing one at point blank range with a bullet to the head. Tried by general court martial in 1970, the sergeant pleaded guilty to, and was found guilty of, unpremeditated murder. He was, however, sentenced to no punishment.\n\nAn atrocity that took place on February 4, 1968, just over a month before the My Lai massacre, in the same province by a man from the same division (Americal). The soldier admitted to his commanding officer and other men of his unit that he gunned down three civilians as they worked in a field. A CID investigation substantiated his confession and charges of premeditated murder were preferred against him. The soldier requested a discharge, which was granted by the commanding general of the Americal Division, in lieu of court martial proceedings.\n\nA series of atrocities similar to, and occurring the same year as, the \"Tiger Force\" war crimes in which one unit allegedly engaged in an orgy of murder, rape and mutilation, over the course of several months.\n\nWhile not yielding the high-end body count estimate of the \"Tiger Force\" series of atrocities, the above incidents begin to demonstrate the ubiquity of the commission of atrocities on the part of American forces during the Vietnam War. Certainly, war crimes, such as murder, rape and mutilation were not an everyday affair for American combat soldiers in Vietnam, however, such acts were also by no means as exceptional as often portrayed in recent historical literature or as tacitly alluded to in the Blade articles.\n\nThe excellent investigative reporting of the Toledo Blade is to be commended for shedding light on war crimes committed by American soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division in 1967. However, it is equally important to understand that the \"Tiger Force\" atrocities were not the mere result of \"Rogue GIs\" but instead stem from what historian Christian Appy has termed the American \"doctrine of atrocity\" during the Vietnam War -- a strategy built upon official U.S. dictums relating to the body count, free-fire zones, search and destroy tactics and the strategy of attrition as well as unofficial tenets such as \"kill anything that moves,\" intoned during the \"Tiger Force\" atrocities and in countless other atrocity tales, or the \"mere gook rule\" which held that \"If it's dead and Vietnamese, it's VC.\" Further, it must also be recognized that the \"Tiger Force\" atrocities, the My Lai massacre, the Herbert allegations and the few other better-known war crimes were not isolated or tangentially-related incidents, but instead are only the most spectacular or best publicized of what was an on-going string of atrocities, large and small, that spanned the entire duration of the war.\n\nThe headline of one Blade article proclaims, \"Earlier Tiger Force probe could have averted My Lai carnage,\" referring to the fact that the 101st Airborne Division's \"Tiger Force\" troops operated in the same province (Quang Ngai), with the same mission (search and destroy) months before the Americal Division's men committed their war crimes. But atrocities were not a localized problem or one that only emerged in 1967. Instead, the pervasive disregard for the laws of war had begun prior to U.S. buildup in 1965 and had roots in earlier conflicts. Only by recognizing these facts can we hope to begin to understand the \"Tiger Foce\" atrocities and the history of American war crimes in Vietnam,\n\nOn October 19, 2003, the Ohio-based newspaper the Toledo Blade launched a four-day series of investigative reports exposing a string of atrocities by an elite, volunteer, 45-man \"Tiger Force\" unit of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division over the course of seven months in 1967.

She has been poisoned\n\nby the most toxic molecule known to science; it was\n\nsprayed during a prolonged military campaign. The\n\ncontamination persists. No redress has been offered,\n\nno compensation. The superpower that spread the toxin\n\nhas done nothing to combat the medical and\n\nenvironmental catastrophe that is overwhelming her\n\ncountry. This is not northern Iraq, where Saddam\n\nHussein gassed 5,000 Kurds in 1988. Nor the trenches\n\nof first world war France. Hong Hanh's story, and that\n\nof many more like her, is quietly unfolding in Vietnam\n\ntoday. Her declining half-life is spent unseen, in her\n\nhome, an unremarkable concrete box in Ho Chi Minh\n\nCity, filled with photographs, family plaques and\n\nyellow enamel stars, a place where the best is made of\n\nthe worst.\n\nHong Hanh is both surprising and terrifying. Here is a\n\n19-year-old who lives in a 10-year-old's body. She\n\nclatters around with disjointed spidery strides which\n\nleave her soaked in sweat. When she cannot stop\n\ncrying, soothing creams and iodine are rubbed into her\n\nback, which is a lunar collage of septic blisters and\n\nscabs. \"My daughter is dying,\" her mother says. \"My\n\nyoungest daughter is 11 and she has the same symptoms.\n\nWhat should we do? Their fingers and toes stick\n\ntogether before they drop off. Their hands wear down\n\nto stumps. Every day they lose a little more skin. And\n\nthis is not leprosy. The doctors say it is connected\n\nto American chemical weapons we were exposed to during\n\nthe Vietnam war.\"\n\nThere are an estimated 650,000 like Hong Hanh in\n\nVietnam, suffering from an array of baffling chronic\n\nconditions. Another 500,000 have already died. The\n\nthread that weaves through all their case histories is\n\ndefoliants deployed by the US military during the war.\n\nSome of the victims are veterans who were doused in\n\nthese chemicals during the war, others are farmers who\n\nlived off land that was sprayed. The second generation\n\nare the sons and daughters of war veterans, or\n\nchildren born to parents who lived on contaminated\n\nland. Now there is a third generation, the\n\ngrandchildren of the war and its victims.\n\nThis is a chain of events bitterly denied by the US\n\ngovernment. Millions of litres of defoliants such as\n\nAgent Orange were dropped on Vietnam, but US\n\ngovernment scientists claimed that these chemicals\n\nwere harmless to humans and short-lived in the\n\nenvironment. US strategists argue that Agent Orange\n\nwas a prototype smart weapon, a benign tactical\n\nherbicide that saved many hundreds of thousands of\n\nAmerican lives by denying the North Vietnamese army\n\nthe jungle cover that allowed it ruthlessly to strike\n\nand feint. New scientific research, however, confirms\n\nwhat the Vietnamese have been claiming for years. It\n\nalso portrays the US government as one that has\n\nillicitly used weapons of mass destruction, stymied\n\nall independent efforts to assess the impact of their\n\ndeployment, failed to acknowledge cold, hard evidence\n\nof maiming and slaughter, and pursued a policy of\n\nevasion and deception.\n\nTeams of international scientists working in Vietnam\n\nhave now discovered that Agent Orange contains one of\n\nthe most virulent poisons known to man, a strain of\n\ndioxin called TCCD which, 28 years after the fighting\n\nended, remains in the soil, continuing to destroy the\n\nlives of those exposed to it. Evidence has also\n\nemerged that the US government not only knew that\n\nAgent Orange was contaminated, but was fully aware of\n\nthe killing power of its contaminant dioxin, and yet\n\nstill continued to use the herbicide in Vietnam for 10\n\nyears of the war and in concentrations that exceeded\n\nits own guidelines by 25 times. As well as spraying\n\nthe North Vietnamese, the US doused its own troops\n\nstationed in the jungle, rather than lose tactical\n\nadvantage by having them withdraw.\n\nOn February 5, addressing the UN Security Council,\n\nsecretary of state Colin Powell, now famously,\n\nclutched between his fingers a tiny phial representing\n\nconcentrated anthrax spores, enough to kill thousands,\n\nand only a tiny fraction of the amount he said Saddam\n\nHussein had at his disposal.\n\nThe Vietnamese government has its own symbolic phial\n\nthat it, too, flourishes, in scientific conferences\n\nthat get little publicity. It contains 80g of TCCD,\n\njust enough of the super-toxin contained in Agent\n\nOrange to fill a child-size talcum powder container.\n\nIf dropped into the water supply of a city the size of\n\nNew York, it would kill the entire population.\n\nGround-breaking research by Dr Arthur H Westing,\n\nformer director of the UN Environment Programme, a\n\nleading authority on Agent Orange, reveals that the US\n\nsprayed 170kg of it over Vietnam.\n\nJohn F Kennedy's presidential victory in 1961 was\n\npropelled by an image of the New Frontier. He called\n\non Americans to \"bear the burden of a long twilight\n\nstruggle ... against the common enemies of man:\n\ntyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\" But one of\n\nthe most problematic new frontiers, that dividing\n\nNorth and South Vietnam, flared up immediately after\n\nhe had taken office, forcing him to bolster the\n\nUS-backed regime in Saigon. Kennedy examined \"tricks\n\nand gadgets\" that might give the South an edge in the\n\njungle, and in November 1961 sanctioned the use of\n\ndefoliants in a covert operation code-named Ranch\n\nHand, every mission flown signed off by the president\n\nhimself and managed in Saigon by the secret Committee\n\n202 - the call sign for defoliating forests being \"20\"\n\nand for spraying fields \"2\".\n\nNgo Luc, 67, was serving with a North Vietnamese\n\nguerrilla unit in the Central Highlands when he saw\n\nplanes circling overhead. \"We expected bombs, but a\n\nfine yellow mist descended, covering absolutely\n\neverything,\" he says. \"We were soaked in it, but it\n\ndidn't worry us, as it smelled good. We continued to\n\ncrawl through the jungle. The next day the leaves\n\nwilted and within a week the jungle was bald. We felt\n\njust fine at the time.\" Today, the former captain is\n\nthe sole survivor from his unit and lives with his two\n\ngranddaughters, both born partially paralysed, near\n\nthe central Vietnamese city of Hue.\n\nWhen US troops became directly embroiled in Vietnam in\n\n1964, the Pentagon signed contracts worth $57m (£36m)\n\nwith eight US chemical companies to produce\n\ndefoliants, including Agent Orange, named after the\n\ncoloured band painted around the barrels in which it\n\nwas shipped. The US would target the Ho Chi Minh trail\n\n- Viet Cong supply lines made invisible by the jungle\n\ncanopy along the border with Laos - as well as the\n\nheavily wooded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that separated\n\nthe North from the South, and also the Mekong Delta, a\n\nmaze of overgrown swamps and inlets that was a haven\n\nfor communist insurgents.\n\nA reporter for the St Louis Dispatch witnessed a\n\nsecret spraying mission and wrote that the US was\n\ndropping \"poison\". Congressman Robert Kastenmeier\n\ndemanded that the president abandon \"chemical warfare\"\n\nbecause it tainted America's reputation. Instead,\n\nWilliam Bundy, a presidential adviser, flatly denied\n\nthat the herbicide used by America was a chemical\n\nweapon, and blamed communist propagandists for a\n\ndistortion of the facts about the Ranch Hand\n\noperation. Only when the Federation of American\n\nScientists warned that year that Vietnam was being\n\nused as a laboratory experiment did the rumours become\n\nirrefutable. More than 5,000 American scientists,\n\nincluding 17 Nobel laureates and 129 members of the\n\nAcademy of Sciences, signed a petition against\n\n\"chemical and biological weapons used in Vietnam\".\n\nEight years after the military launched Operation\n\nRanch Hand, scientists from the National Institute of\n\nHealth warned that laboratory mice exposed to Agent\n\nOrange were giving birth to stillborn or deformed\n\nlitters, a conclusion reinforced by research conducted\n\nby the US department of agriculture. These findings\n\ncoincided with newspaper reports in Hanoi that blamed\n\nAgent Orange for a range of crippling conditions among\n\ntroops and their families. Dr Le Ke Son, a young\n\nconscript in Hanoi during the war and now director of\n\nVietnam's Agent Orange Victims Fund, recalls, \"The\n\ngovernment proposed that a line of runners carry blood\n\nand tissue samples from the front to Hanoi. But it was\n\nmore than 500 miles and took two months, by which time\n\nthe samples were spoiled. How could we make the\n\nresearch work? There was no way to prove what we could\n\nsee with our own eyes.\"\n\nIn December 1969, President Nixon made a radical and\n\ncontroversial pledge that America would never use\n\nchemical weapons in a first strike. He made no mention\n\nof Vietnam or Agent Orange, and the US government\n\ncontinued dispatching supplies of herbicides to the\n\nSouth Vietnamese regime until 1974.\n\nThat year, Kiem was born in a one-room hut in Kim Doi,\n\na village just outside Hue. For her mother, Nguyen,\n\nshe should have been a consolation because her\n\nhusband, a Viet Cong soldier, had been killed several\n\nmonths earlier. \"The last time he came home, he told\n\nme about the spray, how his unit had been doused in a\n\nsweet-smelling mist and all the leaves had fallen from\n\nthe trees,\" Nguyen says. It soon became obvious that\n\nKiem was severely mentally and physically disabled.\n\n\"She can eat, she can smile, she sits on the bed.\n\nThat's it. I have barely left my home since my\n\ndaughter was born.\"\n\nBy the time the war finally ended in 1975, more than\n\n10% of Vietnam had been intensively sprayed with 72\n\nmillion litres of chemicals, of which 66% was Agent\n\nOrange, laced with its super-strain of toxic TCCD. But\n\neven these figures, contained in recently declassified\n\nUS military records, vastly underestimate the true\n\nscale of the spraying. In confidential statements made\n\nto US scientists, former Ranch Hand pilots allege\n\nthat, in addition to the recorded missions, there were\n\n26,000 aborted operations during which 260,000 gallons\n\nof herbicide were dumped. US military regulations\n\nrequired all spray planes or helicopters to return to\n\nbase empty and one pilot, formerly stationed at Bien\n\nHoa air base between 1968 and 1969, claims that he\n\nregularly jettisoned his chemical load into the Long\n\nBinh reservoir. \"These herbicides should never have\n\nbeen used in the way that they were used,\" says the\n\npilot, who has asked not to be identified.\n\nAlmost immediately after the war finished, US veterans\n\nbegan reporting chronic conditions, skin disorders,\n\nasthma, cancers, gastrointestinal diseases. Their\n\nbabies were born limbless or with Down's syndrome and\n\nspina bifida. But it would be three years before the\n\nUS department of veterans' affairs reluctantly agreed\n\nto back a medical investigation, examining 300,000\n\nformer servicemen - only a fraction of those who had\n\ncomplained of being sick - with the government warning\n\nall participants that it was indemnified from lawsuits\n\nbrought by them. When rumours began circulating that\n\nPresident Reagan had told scientists not to make \"any\n\nlink\" between Agent Orange and the deteriorating\n\nhealth of veterans, the victims lost patience with\n\ntheir government and sued the defoliant manufacturers\n\nin an action that was finally settled out of court in\n\n1984 for $180m (£115m).\n\nIt would take the intervention of the former commander\n\nof the US Navy in Vietnam, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, for\n\nthe government finally to admit that it had been aware\n\nof the potential dangers of the chemicals used in\n\nVietnam from the start of Ranch Hand. The admiral's\n\ninvolvement stemmed from a deathbed pledge to his son,\n\na patrol boat captain who contracted two forms of\n\ncancer that he believed had been caused by his\n\nexposure to Agent Orange. Every day during the war,\n\nCaptain Elmo Zumwalt Jr had swum in a river from which\n\nhe had also eaten fish, in an area that was regularly\n\nsprayed with the herbicide. Two years after his son's\n\ndeath in 1988, Zumwalt used his leverage within the\n\nmilitary establishment to compile a classified report,\n\nwhich he presented to the secretary of the department\n\nof veterans' affairs and which contained data linking\n\nAgent Orange to 28 life-threatening conditions,\n\nincluding bone cancer, skin cancer, brain cancer - in\n\nfact, almost every cancer known to man - in addition\n\nto chronic skin disorders, birth defects,\n\ngastrointestinal diseases and neurological defects.\n\nZumwalt also uncovered irrefutable evidence that the\n\nUS military had dispensed \"Agent Orange in\n\nconcentrations six to 25 times the suggested rate\" and\n\nthat \"4.2m US soldiers could have made transient or\n\nsignificant contact with the herbicides because of\n\nOperation Ranch Hand\". This speculative figure is\n\ntwice the official estimate of US veterans who may\n\nhave been contaminated with TCCD.\n\nMost damning and politically sensitive of all is a\n\nletter, obtained by Zumwalt, from Dr James Clary, a\n\nmilitary scientist who designed the spray tanks for\n\nRanch Hand. Writing in 1988 to a member of Congress\n\ninvestigating Agent Orange, Clary admitted: \"When we\n\ninitiated the herbicide programme in the 1960s, we\n\nwere aware of the potential for damage due to dioxin\n\ncontamination in the herbicide. We were even aware\n\nthat the military formulation had a higher dioxin\n\nconcentration than the civilian version, due to the\n\nlower cost and speed of manufacture. However, because\n\nthe material was to be used on the enemy, none of us\n\nwere overly concerned.\"\n\nThe Office of Genetic Counselling and Disabled\n\nChildren (OGCDC) operates out of a room little bigger\n\nthan a broom cupboard. Dr Viet Nhan and his 21\n\nvolunteers share their cramped quarters at Hue Medical\n\nCollege with cerebral spinal fluid shunt kits donated\n\nfrom Norfolk, Virginia; children's clothes given by\n\nthe Rotary Club of Osaka, Japan; second-hand computers\n\nscavenged from banks in Singapore.\n\nVietnam's chaotic and underfunded national health\n\nservice cannot cope with the demands made upon it. The\n\nVietnamese Red Cross has registered an estimated one\n\nmillion people disabled by Agent Orange, but has\n\nsufficient funds to help only one fifth of them,\n\npaying out an average of $5 (£3) a month. Dr Nhan\n\nestablished the free OGCDC, having studied the impact\n\nof Agent Orange as a student, to match Vietnamese\n\nfamilies to foreign private financial donors. \"It was\n\nonly when I went out to the villages looking for case\n\nstudies that I realised how many families were\n\naffected and how few could afford help,\" he says. \"I\n\nabandoned my research. Children need to run before\n\nthey die.\"\n\nThe walls of his room are plastered with bewildering\n\nphotographs of those he has helped: operations for\n\nhernias and cleft palates, open-heart surgery and\n\nkidney transplants. All of the patients come from\n\nisolated districts in central Vietnam, villages whose\n\nnames will be unfamiliar, unlike the locations that\n\nsurround them: Khe Sanh, Hamburger Hill, Camp Carroll\n\nand the Rock Pile. \"I am not interested in\n\napportioning blame,\" Nhan says. \"I don't want to talk\n\nto you about science or politics. What I care about is\n\nthat I have 60 sick children needing financial\n\nbackers. They cannot wait for the US to change its\n\npolicy, take its head out of the sand and clear up the\n\nmess.\"\n\nHe takes us into an intensive care ward to meet\n\nnine-year-old Nguyen Van Tan, who two weeks before had\n\nopen-heart surgery to correct a birth defect thought\n\nto be connected to dioxin poisoning. There is no hard\n\nproof of this, but his father, who sits beside the\n\nbed, talks of being sprayed with defoliants when he\n\nfought with the Viet Cong. The area they live in was\n\nrepeatedly doused during the war. Almost all of his\n\nformer battlefield comrades have disabled children, he\n\nsays. Nhan ushers us away. \"I don't want to tell the\n\nfamily yet, but their boy will never fully recover. He\n\nis already suffering from total paralysis. The most we\n\ncan do now is send them home with a little money.\"\n\nBack in his tiny office, the doctor gestures to\n\nphotocopies of US Air Force maps, sent by a veterans'\n\norganisation because the US government refuses to\n\nsupply them. These dizzying charts depict the number\n\nof herbicide missions carried out over Quang Tri, a\n\nprovince adjacent to the DMZ, from where almost all\n\nNhan's patients come. Its topography is obliterated by\n\nspray lines, 741,143 gallons of chemicals dropped\n\nhere, more than 600,000 of them being Agent Orange.\n\n\"I'm just scratching the surface,\" he says.\n\nThe Vietnamese government is reluctant to let us\n\ntravel to Quang Tri province. It does not want us \"to\n\npoke and prod\" already dismal villagers, treating them\n\nas if they are medical exhibits. We attempt to recruit\n\nsome high-powered support and arrange a meeting in\n\nHanoi with Madame Nguyen Thi Binh, who until last year\n\nwas the vice-president of Vietnam. She receives us at\n\nthe presidential palace in a teak-panelled hall\n\nbeneath an enormous photograph of Ho Chi Minh in a\n\ngold frame writhing with dragons. \"Thank you, my young\n\nfriends, for your interest in Vietnam,\" Madame Binh\n\nsays, straightening her grey silk ao dai, a\n\ntraditional flowing trouser suit.\n\nShe looks genteel, but old photographs of her in olive\n\nfatigues suggest she is a seasoned campaigner. As\n\nminister of foreign affairs for the Provisional\n\nRevolutionary South Vietnamese government, she\n\nnegotiated at the Paris peace talks in 1973. \"I must\n\nwarn you, I will not answer questions about George W\n\nBush,\" she says, casting a steely gaze, perhaps\n\nconscious of the fact that, since the lifting of the\n\nUS economic embargo in 1994, trade with America has\n\ngrown to £650m a year. Madame Binh does, however, want\n\nto talk about chemical warfare, recalling how, when\n\nshe returned after the war to her home province of\n\nQuang Nam, a lush region south-west of Hue which was\n\ndrenched in defoliants, she found \"no sign of life,\n\njust rubble and grass\". She says: \"All of our\n\nreturning veterans had a burning desire for children\n\nto repopulate our devastated country. When the first\n\nchild was born with a birth defect, they tried again\n\nand again. So many families now have four or five\n\ndisabled children, raising them without any hope.\"\n\nWhat should the US do? Madame Binh laughs. \"It's very\n\nlate to do anything. We put this issue directly on the\n\ntable with the US. So far they have not dealt with the\n\nproblem. If our relationship is ever to be normal, the\n\nUS has to accept responsibility. Go and see the\n\nsituation for yourself.\"\n\nShe sends us back to Hue. Over chilled water and\n\ntangerines, we talk to a suspicious party secretary\n\nwho asks us why we have bothered to come after all\n\nthese years. \"There is no point,\" he says. \"Nothing\n\nwill come of it.\" But he opens his file all the same\n\nand reads aloud: \"In Hue city there are 6,633\n\nhouseholds affected by Agent Orange and in them 3,708\n\nsick children under the age of 16.\" He eventually\n\nagrees to take us north-west, over the Perfume river,\n\nbeyond the ancient royal tombs that circle this former\n\nimperial city, towards the DMZ. We arrive at a distant\n\ncommune where a handyman is sprucing up a bust of Ho\n\nChi Minh with white gloss paint. Eventually, the\n\nchairman of the People's Committee of Dang Ha joins\n\nus, and our political charabanc stuffed with seven\n\nofficials sets out across the green and gold\n\ncountryside, along crisscrossing lanes. The chairman\n\ntells us proudly how he was born on January 31 1968,\n\nthe night of the Tet offensive, the turning point of\n\nthe war, when the Viet Cong launched its assault on US\n\npositions. By the time we stop, we are all the best of\n\nfriends and, holding hands, he pulls us into the home\n\nof the Pham family, where a wall of neighbours and an\n\nassembly of local dignitaries dressed in shiny,\n\ndouble-breasted jackets stare grimly at a moaning\n\nchild. He lies on a mat on the floor, his matchstick\n\nlimbs folded uselessly before him, his parents taking\n\nit in turns to mop his mouth, as if without them he\n\nwould drown in his own saliva.\n\nHoi, the boy's mother, tells us how she met her\n\nhusband when they were assigned to the same Viet Cong\n\nunit in which they fought together for 10 years. But\n\nshe alone was ordered to the battle of Troung Hon\n\nmountain. \"I saw this powder falling from the sky,\"\n\nshe says. \"I felt sick, had a headache. I was sent to\n\na field hospital. I was close to the gates of hell. By\n\nthe time I was discharged, I had lost the strength in\n\nmy legs and they have never fully recovered. Then Ky\n\nwas born, our son, with yellow skin. Every year his\n\nproblems get worse.\" Her husband, Hung, interrupts:\n\n\"Sometimes, we have been so desperate for money that\n\nwe have begged in the local market. I do not think you\n\ncan imagine the humiliation of that.\"\n\nAnd this family is not alone. All the adults here,\n\ncycling past us or strolling along the dykes, are\n\nsuffering from skin lesions and goitres that cling to\n\nnecks like sagging balloons. The women spontaneously\n\nabort or give birth to genderless squabs that horrify\n\neven the most experienced midwives. In a yard, Nguyen,\n\na neighbour's child, stares into space. He has a\n\nhydrocephalic head as large as a melon. Two houses\n\ndown, Tan has distended eyes that bubble from his\n\nface. By the river, Ngoc is sleeping, so wan he\n\nresembles a pressed flower. \"They told me the boy is\n\ndepressed,\" his exhausted father tells us. \"Of course\n\nhe's depressed. He lives with disease and death.\"\n\nThis is not a specially constructed ghetto used to\n\nwage a propaganda war against imperialism. The\n\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam has long embraced the\n\nfree market. This is an ordinary hamlet where, in\n\nthese new liberal times, villagers like to argue about\n\nthe English Premiership football results over a glass\n\nof home-brewed rice beer. Here live three generations\n\naffected by Agent Orange: veterans who were sprayed\n\nduring the war and their successors who inherited the\n\ncontamination or who still farm on land that was\n\nsprayed. Vietnam's impoverished scientific community\n\nis now trying to determine if there will be a fourth\n\ngeneration. \"How long will this go on?\" asks Dr Tran\n\nManh Hung, the ministry of health's leading\n\nresearcher.\n\nDr Hung is now working with a team of Canadian\n\nenvironmental scientists, Hatfield Consultants, and\n\nthey have made an alarming discovery. In the Aluoi\n\nValley, adjacent to the Ho Chi Minh trail, once home\n\nto three US Special Forces bases, a region where Agent\n\nOrange was both stored and sprayed, the scientists'\n\nanalysis has shown that, rather than naturally\n\ndisperse, the dioxin has remained in the ground in\n\nconcentrations 100 times above the safety levels for\n\nagricultural land in Canada. It has spread into\n\nAluoi's ponds, rivers and irrigation supplies, from\n\nwhere it has passed into the food chain, through fish\n\nand freshwater shellfish, chicken and ducks that store\n\nTCCD in fatty tissue. Samples of human blood and\n\nbreast milk reveal that villagers have ingested the\n\ninvisible toxin and that pregnant women pass it\n\nthrough the placenta to the foetus and then through\n\ntheir breast milk, doubly infecting newborn babies. Is\n\nit, then, a coincidence that in this minuscule region\n\nof Vietnam, more than 15,000 children and adults have\n\nalready been registered as suffering from the usual\n\narray of chronic conditions?\n\n\"We theorise that the Aluoi Valley is a microcosm of\n\nthe country, where numerous reservoirs of TCCD still\n\nexist in the soil of former US military\n\ninstallations,\" says Dr Wayne Dwernychuk,\n\nvice-president of Hatfield Consultants. There may be\n\nas many as 50 of these \"hot spots\", including one at\n\nthe former US military base of Bien Hoa, where,\n\naccording to declassified defence department\n\ndocuments, US forces spilled 7,500 gallons of Agent\n\nOrange on March 1 1970. Dr Arnold Schecter, a leading\n\nexpert in dioxin contamination in the US, sampled the\n\nsoil there and found it to contain TCCD levels that\n\nwere 180 million times above the safe level set by the\n\nUS environmental protection agency.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to decontaminate humans or\n\nthe soil. A World Health Organisation briefing paper\n\nwarns: \"Once TCCD has entered the body it is there to\n\nstay due to its uncanny ability to dissolve in fats\n\nand to its rock solid chemical stability.\" At Aluoi,\n\nthe researchers recommended the immediate evacuation\n\nof the worst affected villages, but to be certain of\n\ncontaining this hot spot, the WHO also recommends\n\nsearing the land with temperatures of more than\n\n1,000C, or encasing it in concrete before treating it\n\nchemically.\n\nAt home, the US takes heed. When a dump at the Robins\n\nAir Force Base in Georgia was found to have stored\n\nAgent Orange, it was placed on a National Priority\n\nList, immediately capped in five feet of clay and\n\nsand, and has since been the subject of seven\n\ninvestigations. Dioxin is now also a major domestic\n\nconcern, scientists having discovered that it is a\n\nby-product of many ordinary industrial processes,\n\nincluding smelting, the bleaching of paper pulp and\n\nsolid waste incineration. The US environmental\n\nprotection agency, pressed into a 12-year inquiry,\n\nrecently concluded that it is a \"class-1 human\n\ncarcinogen\".\n\nThe evidence is categoric. Last April, a conference at\n\nYale University attended by the world's leading\n\nenvironmental scientists, who reviewed the latest\n\nresearch, concluded that in Vietnam the US had\n\nconducted the \"largest chemical warfare campaign in\n\nhistory\". And yet no money is forthcoming, no aid in\n\nkind. For the US, there has only ever been one\n\ncontemporary incident of note involving weapons of\n\nmass destruction - Colin Powell told the UN Security\n\nCouncil in February that, \"in the history of chemical\n\nwarfare, no country has had more battlefield\n\nexperience with chemical weapons since world war one\n\nthan Saddam Hussein's Iraq\".\n\nThe US government has yet to respond to the Hatfield\n\nConsultants' report, which finally explains why the\n\nVietnamese are still dying so many years after the war\n\nis over, but, last March, it did make its first\n\ncontribution to the debate in Vietnam. It signed an\n\nagreement with a reluctant Vietnamese government for\n\nan $850,000 (£543,000) programme to \"fill identified\n\ndata gaps\" in the study of Agent Orange. The\n\nconference in Hanoi that announced the decision,\n\naccording to Vietnamese Red Cross representatives who\n\nattended, ate up a large slice of this funding. One of\n\nthe signatories is the same US environmental\n\nprotection agency that has already concluded that\n\ndioxin causes cancer.\n\n\"Studies can be proposed until hell freezes over,\"\n\nsays Dr Dwernychuk of Hatfield Consultants, \"but they\n\nare not going to assist the Vietnamese in a\n\nhumanitarian sense one iota. We state emphatically\n\nthat no additional research on human health is\n\nrequired to facilitate intervention or to protect the\n\nlocal citizens.\"\n\nThere is cash to be lavished in Vietnam when the US\n\ngovernment sees it as politically expedient. Over the\n\npast 10 years, more than $350m (£223m) has been spent\n\non chasing ghosts. In 1992, the US launched the Joint\n\nTask Force-Full Accounting to locate 2,267 servicemen\n\nthought to be missing in action in Vietnam, Cambodia\n\nand Laos. Jerry O'Hara, spokesman for JTF-FA, which is\n\nstill searching for the remains of 1,889 of them, told\n\nus, \"We don't place a monetary value on what we do and\n\nwe'll be here until we have brought all of the boys\n\nback home.\"\n\nSo it is that America continues to spend considerably\n\nmore on the dead than it does on the millions of\n\nliving and long-suffering - be they back home or in\n\nVietnam.\n\nThe science of chemical warfare fills a silent,\n\nwhite-tiled room at Tu Du hospital in Ho Chi Minh\n\nCity. Here, shelves are overburdened with research\n\nmaterials. Behind the locked door is an iridescent\n\nwall of the mutated and misshapen, hundreds of bell\n\njars and vacuum-sealed bottles in which human foetuses\n\nfloat in formaldehyde. Some appear to be sleeping,\n\nfingers curling their hair, thumbs pressing at their\n\nlips, while others with multiple heads and mangled\n\nlimbs are listless and slumped. Thankfully, none of\n\nthese dioxin babies ever woke up.\n\nOne floor below, it is never quiet. Here are those who\n\nhave survived the misery of their births, ravaged\n\ninfants whom no one has the ability to understand,\n\nbabies so traumatised by their own disabilities,\n\nluckless children so enraged and depressed at their\n\nmiserable fate, that they are tied to their beds just\n\nto keep them safe from harm\n\n11 million dead in Afghanistan and Iraq?\n\nBy Dr Gideon Polya\n\n08 February, 2008\n\nCountercurrents.org\n\nThe United States invaded Afghanistan in October 2001 with the ostensible excuse of the Afghan Government's \"protection\" of the asserted Al Qaeda culprits of the 9/11 atrocity that killed 3,000 people. In the light of as many as 6.6 million post-invasion excess deaths in Occupied Afghanistan as of February 2008 (see below), it is important to consider the major problems with this Bush-ite and neo-Bush-ite version of events as summarized below:\n\n1. The US has a long history of \"questionable\" excuses for war e.g. the explosion of the Maine (the Spanish-American War), the sinking of the US arms-carrying Lusitania (entry into World War 1), the Pearl Harbor attack with now recognized US foreknowledge (entry into World War 2), North Koreans provoked into invading their own country (the Korean War), the fictitious Gulf of Tonkin incident (the Vietnam War; recently similarly but unsuccessfully attempted in the Persian Gulf as an \"excuse\" to attack Iran) and the extraordinary 1,000 post-9/11 lies told by Bush Administration figures, most notoriously about non-existent Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction (the Iraq War; post-invasion excess deaths now about 1.5-2 million).\n\n2. The US supported and funded Al Qaeda and the Taliban from the late 1970s to the early 1990s associated with its anti-Soviet policies (see William Blum's \"Rogue State\").\n\n3. Oil- and hegemony-related plans for the invasion of Afghanistan were all ready to go before 9/11.\n\n4. No Afghans were involved in the 9/11 attack according to the \"official 9/11 story\" of the egregiously dishonest Bush Administration.\n\n5. Even the right-wing, neo-Bush-ite Democrat Al Gore in his recent book \"The Assault on Reason\" (Chapter 6, National Insecurity, pp178-179) condemns the Bush Administration for effective passive complicity in the 9/11 atrocity i.e. they let it happen, just as a fore-warned US Administration permitted the Pearl Harbor attack to happen in 1941: \"Their behaviour, in my opinion, was reckless, but the explanation for it lies in hubris, not in some bizarre conspiracy theory These affirmative and repeated refusals to listen to clear warnings [prior to 9/11] constitute behaviour that goes beyond simple negligence. At a minimum, it represents a reckless disregard for the safety of the American people.\"\n\n6. However, further to point #5, the extremely eminent former 7-year President of Italy, law professor, senator for life and long-term Western intelligence intimate Francesco Cossiga recently (November 2007) told one of Italy's top newspapers that (a) the US CIA and Israeli Mossad committed the 9/11 outrage in order to further US and Zionist aims and that (b) major Western intelligence agencies are well aware of this (for details and documentation see: http://mwcnews.net/content/view/18569/26/ ).\n\nAs of February 2008, analysis of UNICEF data (see UNICEF statistics on Occupied Afghanistan: http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/afghanistan_statistics.html ) allows the following estimate of 3.3-6.6 million post-invasion excess deaths (avoidable deaths, deaths that should not have happened) in Occupied Afghanistan:\n\n1. annual under-5 infant deaths 370,000.\n\n2. post-invasion under-5 infant deaths 2.3 million (90% avoidable).\n\n3. post-invasion avoidable under-5 infant deaths 2.1 million.\n\n4. post-invasion non-violent excess deaths 3.2 million (2.3 million /0.7 = 3.3 million; for impoverished, worst case Third world countries the under-5 infant deaths are about 0.7 of total non-violent excess deaths (see A Layperson's Guide to counting Iraq deaths: http://mwcnews.net/content/view/5872/26/ ).\n\n5. post-invasion violent deaths about 3.3 million (assuming roughly 1 violent death for every non-violent avoidable death i.e. roughly as in US-occupied Occupied Iraq where the ratio of violent deaths to non-violent excess deaths is 0.8-1.2 million to 0.7-0.8 million; see Continued Australian and US Coalition war crimes in Occupied Iraq: http://ruddaustraliareportcard.blogspot.com/2008/01/rudd-australia-report-card-1... ).\n\n6. upper estimate of non-violent plus violent post-invasion excess deaths 3.3 million + 3.3 million = 6.6 million excess deaths.\n\nFor detailed documentation of the above see \"Australian complicity in continuing Afghan genocide\": http://ruddaustraliareportcard.blogspot.com/ . A major cause of the carnage is revealed by WHO (see: http://www.who.int/en/ ) -- the \"total annual per capita medical expenditure\" permitted by the Occupiers in Occupied Afghanistan is a mere $19 -- as compared to as compared to $2,560 (the UK), $3,123 (Australia) and $6,096 (the US). This is in gross contravention of Articles 55 and 56 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (see: http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/92.htm ) which unequivocally demands that the Occupier must provide life-sustaining food and medical requisites to its Conquered Subjects \"to the fullest extent of the means available to it\". Compounding this is the appalling reality of 4 million Afghan refugees.\n\nWhat is happening in Afghanistan is an Afghan Holocaust. One sees that post-invasion under-5 infant deaths in Occupied Afghanistan (2.3 million) vastly exceeds the number of Jewish children murdered by the Nazis in World War 2 (1.5 million). The upper estimate of post-invasion violent and non-violent excess deaths in Occupied Afghanistan (6.6 million out of an average 2001-2008 Afghan population of about 25 million) exceeds the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis in World War 2 ( 5.6 million out of 8.2 million Jews in German-occupied Europe in the period 1941-1945) (see: Gilbert, M. (1969), Jewish History Atlas (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London) and Gilbert, M. (1982), Atlas of the Holocaust (Michael Joseph, London)).\n\nArticle 2 of the UN Genocide Convention (see: http://www.edwebproject.org/sideshow/genocide/convention.html ) states \"In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such: a) Killing members of the group; b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"\n\nFrom the data summarized above, it is apparent that the Afghan Holocaust is also an Afghan Genocide as defined by the UN Genocide Convention.\n\nOutstanding US Law academic Professor Ali Khan of the Washburn University School of Law, Topeka, Kansas has also described what is going on in Afghanistan as genocide i.e. an Afghan Genocide (see \"NATO Genocide in Afghanistan\": http://mwcnews.net/content/view/19831/42/ ).\n\nThe key legal verdict of Professor Khan is as follows: \"The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (entered into force, 1951) is binding on all states including the 26 member states of NATO. The Genocide Convention is jus cogens, the law from which no derogation is allowed. It provides no exceptions for any nation or any organization of nations, such as the United Nations or NATO, to commit genocide. Nor does the Convention allow any exceptions to genocide \"whether committed in time of peace or in time of war.\" Even traditional self-defense - let alone preemptive self-defense, a deceptive name for aggression -- cannot be invoked to justify or excuse the crime of genocide.\"\n\nProfessor Khan proceeds to analyse the campaign of extermination of the Indigenous Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan in relation to International law. He states that in relation to Article 2 of the UN Genocide Convention \"In murdering the Taliban, NATO armed forces systematically practice on a continual basis the crime of genocide that consists of three constituent elements - act, intent to destroy, and religious group.\" His detailed analysis can be succinctly summarized as follows:\n\n1. \"The Genocidal Act\" is prohibited as defined in the Genocide Convention as \"a) Killing members of the group; b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\" -- but is is clearly occurring on a huge scale as indicated by the above data.\n\n2. \"The Genocidal Intent\" is expressed in the Genocide Convention as \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\"- but is clearly present in the statements of the NATO leaders. The \"Intent\" is also apparent from the sustained, resolute conduct of this horrendously bloody war for over 6 years.\n\n3. \"The Genocidal targeting of a Religious Group\" is clearly prohibited by the Genocide Convention by \"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\" -- but is clearly being carried out with the accompaniment of immense Islamophobic propaganda in the West.\n\nProfessor Khan concludes: \"It may, therefore, be safely concluded that NATO combat troops and NATO commanders are engaged in murdering the Taliban, a protected group under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to physically and mentally destroy the group in whole or in part. This is the crime of genocide.\"\n\nAs an agnostic humanist I certainly don't care for the Taliban beliefs -- but what agnostic humanists (such as myself) or people of other philosophic persuasions think about the religious beliefs and interpretations of the Taliban is beside the point from the perspective of the UN Genocide Convention.\n\nAnd while I strongly object to human rights violations by the Taliban (especially in relation to women and application of their extreme interpretations of Sharia Law) one has to objectively give credit to the Taliban for (a) bringing Peace through victory in the middle 1990s and (b) for destroying 95% of the Afghan opium production in 2001 (as well of course banning the vastly more deadly use of alcohol and for prohibiting Afghan Government employees from the even more deadly practice of smoking tobacco in 1997). Smoking, alcohol and illicit drugs kill about 7 million people annually, the breakdown being 5 million (tobacco), 1.8 million (alcohol) and 0.2 million (from illicit drugs, about half opiate drug-related).\n\nIt can be estimated that 0.6 million people have died world-wide due to opiates in the last 6 years, about 0.5 million of these deaths being due to US Alliance restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium industry from 5% of world market share (2001) to 93% (2007) (see UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, World Drug Report 2007: http://www.unodc.org/unodc/world_drug_report.html ).\n\nThe 0.5 million global US-NATO-linked opiate drug-related deaths plus 6.6 million post-invasion Afghan excess deaths bring an upper estimate of the carnage due to the US invasion and occupation of Afghanistan to 7.1 million deaths. If we include excess deaths associated with UK-US actions against Iraq in the period 1990-2008 (about 4 million) then the gruesome carnage of the Bush I plus Bush II Asian Wars now totals about 11 million excess deaths (and this ignores the impact of the Bush Wars through oil price rises and other factors on Third World avoidable deaths).\n\nOccupied Afghanistan is the New Auschwitz of the US and its complicit allies (including former Axis countries Germany and Japan who have on US instigation joined the US-NATO Afghan Genocide) (see: http://mwcnews.net/content/view/7616/26/ ).\n\nThose Bush-ite and neo-Bush-ite politicians, military and Mainstream media executives complicit in the Afghan Genocide should be arraigned before the International Criminal Court (see: http://ruddaustraliareportcard.blogspot.com/ ).\n\nIn his 2005 Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech (see: http://www.countercurrents.org/arts-pinter081205.htm ), UK playwright Harold Pinter urged the arraignment of Bush and Blair before the International Criminal Court for war crimes and stated \"How many people do you have to kill before you qualify to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred thousand? More than enough, I would have thought.\"\n\nEleven million? More than enough, I would have thought."
