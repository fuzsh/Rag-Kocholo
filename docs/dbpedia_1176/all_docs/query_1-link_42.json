Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone is president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Charles M. Vest is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg is president of the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone and Dr. Charles M. Vest are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the National Research Council.\n\nwww.national-academies.org\n\nPreface\n\nProjections of sea-level rise are increasingly being incorporated into coastal planning at national, state, and local levels. This assessment of sea-level rise for the California, Oregon, and Washington coasts was requested by 10 state and federal agencies:\n\n• California Department of Water Resources\n\n• California Energy Commission\n\n• California Department of Transportation\n\n• California State Water Resources Control Board\n\n• California Ocean Protection Council\n\n• Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board\n\n• Washington Department of Ecology\n\n• National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n\n• U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)\n\n• U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)\n\nAt the committee’s first meeting, each agency described its needs for sea-level information.1 The state agencies need estimates and projections of sea-level rise in their areas to assess coastal risk; to plan investments in water, transportation, energy, and pollution-control infrastructure; to modify design and construction standards; to develop adaptation strategies that will protect the environment and infrastructure against increased salt-water intrusion, coastal erosion, and inundation; and to identify necessary changes in state law or policy. NOAA and the USGS need sea-level information at state, national, and global scales to assess coastal vulnerability and response to sea-level rise; to improve models and forecasts; to develop research priorities; and to develop decision support tools for a variety of users, including the public. Finally, the USACE needs sea-level information to guide water resource investment decisions.\n\nAssessments of sea-level rise at state and regional levels are challenging because data on the geophysical processes involved are relatively sparse and there are no agreed-upon models or approaches for projecting future sea-level rise. Consequently, in addition to searching the scientific literature, it was necessary to consult widely with colleagues and to carry out original data analyses. The results were discussed during four committee meetings in 2011 and countless teleconference and email discussions.\n\nThe committee used standard statistical techniques to calculate means, trends, and uncertainties associated with sea-level rise, and to extrapolate recent data into the future. To ensure that the calculated results were sound, the committee verified its results in several ways. Calculations performed using standard statistical packages or the equations and data presented in the report were cross-checked by one or two committee members. This process was used to check the means and uncertainties of the various components of sea-level rise, the tide gage and satellite altimetry measurement errors and corrections, vertical land motion observations and models, and estimates of the effect of gravitational attraction. Calculations that required specialized software, including extracting the steric contribution from model results, calculating trends from satellite measure-\n\n__________\n\nments and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models, and projecting future sea-level rise, were carried out or checked by a colleague or student of the lead committee member. The method for extrapolating the cryospheric contribution to sea-level rise was developed in collaboration with a statistician, who also verified the results. Where possible, the data and equations for these calculations are provided in the report or the public-access file, enabling an independent check from reviewers.\n\nThe committee would like to thank the individuals who briefed the committee; supplied data, figures, or model results; or provided other input or feedback: Jonathan Allan, Brian Atwater, Patrick Barnard, Laura Brophy, John Church, Abe Doherty, Catia Domingues, Peter Gleckler, Chris Goldfinger, Dominic Gregorio, Jonathan Gregory, Eric Grossman, Junyi Guo, Erica Harris, Greg Hood, Masayoshi Ishii, Ian Joughin, Jeanine Jones, Tom Kendall, Paul Komar, Eli Levitt, Sydney Levitus, Becky Lunde, Anne Pardaens, Archie Paulson, Stephan Rahmstorf, Eric Rignot, Peter Ruggiero, Carl Safina, Ingo Sasgen, Armand Thibault, Wouter van der Wal, Hansheng Wang, Kelin Wang, Jeff Weber, Josh Willis, Frank Wu, Patrick Wu, Jianjun Yin, and Phoebe Zarnetske. Special thanks go to Balaji Rajagopalan, who developed the statistical approach for the ice extrapolations; James Foster, who compiled and analyzed leveling data in California; Richard Peltier, who provided details of his GIA models and computed past and future predictions of relative sea-level changes in Washington, Oregon, and California; and Jerry Mitrovica, who provided gravity fingerprints along the U.S. west coast for Alaska, Greenland, and Antarctica. The committee also thanks the students, postdocs, and colleagues who crunched numbers, validated results, and created (and recreated) figures, including Jianbin Duan, Zhenwei Huang, Chungyen Kuo, Darrin Sharp, Scott Waibel, and Yuchan Yi. Without the hard work and contributions of all these individuals, it would have been difficult to complete this report.\n\nFinally, I thank all the members of the committee for their service, some of whom had to go way beyond that usually required for an NRC committee because of the short study period and the complexity of the task. Finally, I thank Anne Linn for her tireless efforts as Study Director and for bringing the report to fruition.\n\nRobert A. Dalrymple, Chair\n\nCommittee on Sea Level Rise in\n\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Washington\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis report has been reviewed in draft form by individuals chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise, in accordance with procedures approved by the NRC’s Report Review Committee.
