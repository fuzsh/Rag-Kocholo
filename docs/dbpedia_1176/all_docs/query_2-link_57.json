My book builds upon recent general studies that have begun to explore this avenue of inquiry. Among these works are George Lipsitz, A Life in the Struggle: Ivory Perry and the Culture of Opposition (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1988); Brenda Gayle Plummer, Rising Wind: Black Americans and U.S. Foreign Affairs, 1935–1960 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996); George Lipsitz, “‘Frantic to Join . . . the Japanese Army’: The Asia Pacific War in the Lives of African American Soldiers and Civilians,” in The Politics of Culture in the Shadow of Capital, ed.

African American Encounters with White Australia, 1942–1945,” Pacific Historical Review 71 (Fall 2002). Of special note is Chris Dixon and Sean Brawley, “Tan Yanks and a ‘Semblance of Civilization’: African American Encounters with the South Pacific, 1941–45,” in Through Depression and War: The United States and Australia, ed.

Based on the army’s long-standing policy of racial segregation, Fort Huachuca was one of the few defense installations where black soldiers who served in the U.S. Army could receive military training. Located at the base of the Huachuca Mountains, the post was established during the last half of the nineteenth century and served as an advance headquarters and supply base for military personnel and settlers during the Indian Wars of the 1870s and 1880s. The fort later served as the home of the men of the 10th Cavalry while they guarded the United States–Mexico border during World War I. By the beginning of World War II, the cantonment area underwent massive construction in order to house the extra 11,309 soldiers who, combined with the 25th and 368th infantries, constituted the remainder of the U.S. 93rd Infantry Division.\n\n8.

The personnel makeup for World War II infantry divisions was as follows: three regiments with each unit composed of approximately 3,000 men; each regiment was made up of three battalions along with a cannon company and an intelligence and reconnaissance platoon. The battalions, in turn, consisted of four companies, each constituting 190 or more men; each company normally had four platoons of 48 servicemen. Finally, platoons were broken down into two sections and two squads, with 12 men constituting a regular squad. The division’s total numbers were rounded out by large numbers of Headquarters, Heavy Weapons, Engineering, and Medical personnel.\n\n10. Clarence L. Gaines interview with author; Clarence L.

Data used to determine net in-migration in areas surrounding the military facility were gathered from 175 survey questionnaires, black newspapers, the Ninety-third Blue Helmet, archival records at the Fort Huachuca Historical Museum, and the National Archives and Records Administration. I particularly focused on the years beginning with 1941 and ending with 1942 because I wanted to examine the migration patterns of service dependents that occurred during the initial training of the 93rd Infantry Division while stationed at Fort Huachuca in 1942 and the out-flow of service families after the unit’s deployment to the 3rd Army Maneuver Area fourteen months later.\n\n4.
