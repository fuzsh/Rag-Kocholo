Unlike any other previous educational situ- ation, the pattern of the college campus completely surrounds the student, and for a period of some four years a student's whole world is enveloped by his daily activities of surving in the college environment. A yearbook attempts to capture some of that ex- perience in a permanent form. It tries to offer the student some tangible memories, a way to recall mo- ments of pride, passion, joy, and sorrow. It can serve as a momento of that unique period of one's life after the college career has ended. Perhaps as you, the reader, flip through TAPS some of those memories will return so that they might be refreshed and enjoyed once more. That's what TAPS is all about.

Long hours in and around Lake Hartwell, late night to early morning stereo parties, mind-inspiring conversations downtown with last year's friends, all must compete with the insanity of the three R's: reloca- tion, refrigeration, and registration. Relocation is a broad term which en- compasses all the fun of moving back to the dorm, from riding 140 miles with a stereo and five guppies in your lap, to try- ing to stick all of your crucial 29 plugs into the eight available electrical outlets of the new dorm room. Relocation also includes the decoration of the dorm room, highlighting with \"bed buildup\". Bed build-up begins the morning of the move with a frantic search through the Student Handbook for directions on how to fit four 70 inch 4X4's into the back of the family sedan. Bed build-up culmi- nates in a bed party (it's not as immoral as it sounds) where a handful of undergrad- uates drill, bolt, and hammer together the massive yet somehow wobbly structure which will hold your bed aloft. Architec- ture and engineering majors especially en- joy a surge of popularity at this time, while those less skilled perch on the air condi- tioner and recite \"Tiger Rag\" in olde eng- lishe until threatened with an electric screwdriver. The registration procedure is as frustrating to the upperclassmen as it is to freshmen Here, two coeds delve into the mysteries of the instruction book. Prospective members of Chi Omega sorority listen attentively during rush week Registration is one \"I the most confusing times ol the Insi week, ,md some time away from the lines is necessary to one's sanity.

These first two weeks will pret- ty well determine your label for the rest of the year, i.e. The Neat One, The Messy One, The Early Riser, The No-Classes- Til-Noon Sleeper, The Jungle Forest Plant Lover, etc. Although there are many types of combinations, one thing is certain — both \"roomies\" will feel the other is extreme about something. The next of the three bitter R's is refrig- eration. This means getting sunburned standing in a line which is moving every which way but forward, only to be reward- ed with a cross-campus pilgrimage carry- ing a 75 lb. refrigerator that will freeze your butter and melt your Breyer's butter pecan. This is really too sensitive a subject to be carried on further. The last, the most complex, and the most unnerving of the three R's is registra- tion. No four-year student yet graduated has been able to avoid the insidious Sikes A person's first experience at college life can be frustrating, and sometimes it's difficult to know even which direction to go in. Orientation is something every new students must experience, though it looks as if these freshmen would rather be elsewhere. Hal Waters Marly Kvans I8-Studcnt Life &it!^ Hall-Tillman-bottom floor E section Mar- tin cycle for all eight semesters. It is as certain as death and taxes. It is also during registration that you begin to realize the full complexity of as- tronomy. If there are no stars on your schedule form, then no problem. If there are five or six stars, then you get a First Day Drop/Add Card, and no problems. But if you get two or three stars, then you have to forge your advisor's name at least twice, and you still have problems. If you have been closed out of a class because it is full, then you have to stand like so many blind beggars along the wall by the sign-up table and wait for someone to drop. And even if someone does drop, and even if you do outlive the scramble to the sign-up table, and even if you do man- age to get your name printed at the bottom of the attendence register, you still have not solved everything. Now you have to decide if you are going to fit in your lunch hour at 9:05 or 4:40. by Sha Sifford A major campus problem is the incidence of depres- sion among many freshmen, who often feel over- whelmed by the sudden change in lifestyle. Many students lent a homey atmosphere to their rooms through the addition of refrigerators and fur- niture, while stacking beds gave moore space.

The theme of this year's parade was \"Hammer the Hooters,\" in keeping with the first football game against the Rice University Owls. The parade originated from the Astro Theater parking lot, and then spread out along College Avenue and through down- town Clemson. The parade route was liter- ally jammed with over 15,000 spectators who found viewing positions ranging from the grassy hill across from Bowman field to precarious perches on the roof of nearby buildings. Most of the fifty-two displays were the results of hectic hours of preparation. Wooden frames were built first and at- tached to whatever form of transportation could haul them. Yards of chicken wire and mounds of crepe paper were then art- fully combined into likenesess of huge ti- gers and owls. The helpers on these floats- usually trailing behind them on the parade route-resembled some sort of orange army. This year's event was organized, as in the past, by the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, and was the largest First Friday parade in Clemson history. The members of Pi Kappa Alpha led the procession, followed closely by the grand marshals of the pa- rade, an honor shared by former Clemson Coaches Frank Howard, Jeff Nelly, Joe Davis, and Bob Jones. Back by popular demand the infamous Kudzu people return to the First Friday Parade. What's a parade without a band and twirlers? The Clemson twirlers added color and spirit to the First Friday Parade. Some floats took less organization than other, but regardless of the complexity or cimplicty of the float, a good time was had by all. Marty Evans Marty Evans Student Life-21 First Friday Completing the line-up came the bulk of the entrants bearing floats based on the parade theme. Participants cheered their way down the avenue until the could \"strut their stuff as they flanked the judge's booth on Bowman field. Radio announcer Dan Kelley and his wife, women's basket- ball coach Annie Tribble, and Mrs. Bill McClellan judged this year's efforts in sev- en catagories: color, theme, workmanship, lighting, music, originality, and overall ef- fect. Trophies and other prizes such as kegs of beer, pizzas, and cash were awarded during the pep rally to first and second place winners in each division. First place in the Activity Club Division went to the Science Club, with the Chemical Engi- neering Society taking second place. Top honors in the Fraternity Division went to Alpha Gamma Rho, with the second spot going to Alpha Phi Omega.

The top spots in the Women's Dorm Division went to the Clemson House and Byrnes Hall, with Johnstone B-8 and D-3 taking first and second places in the Men's Dorm Division. The overall winner this year was Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority. The pep rally itself was in the traditional Clemson style, but with a few added touches. Coach Danny Ford presented the current crop of senior football players, and Leonard Posttoasties of \"Leonard's Los- er's\" fame came before the overflow crowd to predict Rice's defeat. The crowd remained standing through- out the entire event, and displayed their true Tiger spirit as the traditional playing of \"Tiger Rag\" and the Alma Mater end- ed the biggest First Friday Day ever. by Jill Pebbles and Kim Nelson The sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority ride proudly before their float, which won the award for best overall entry.

Student Life-25 Clubs Relieve Boredom Ed Elsea When a student has finished a full day of going to all his classes and labs, and has done all his homework (and carefully checked it for errors), he may find that he has nothing else to do. It is for this reason that a wide variety of sports clubs exist on campus, offering the bored Clemsonite a diverse group of activities to choose from. For the straight sports enthusiast, a number of strictly athletic organizations exist. The Clemson Gymnastics Club con- sists of both men's and women's teams that compete on club and varsity levels, repre- senting the school and state at national meets. Clemson Club Football caters to those who seek the medium between intramural and varsity football. This full-contact, high school-rules activity takes on other college teams in the North Carolina Na- tional Club Football Association. Lacrosse, a fast-moving sport that origi- nated with the American Indians, has been played at Clemson for five years and has never had a losing season. Less structured, but as vigorously played is Clemson Rugby Football, a strictly amateur effort that is marked by a cameraderie not found in many other sports. The rugby team takes on other college and city teams in week- end matches. A very demanding past-time is prac- ticed by members of the Clemson Tae Kwon Do Club. This art of self defense can be learned in the club, but only through dedication to the hard physical exercise the activity requires. A number of organizations give students the opportunity to get outside for some exercise. The Ski Club is an organization in which things are going well when they are going downhill, while the Outing Club prefers to lug packs up the same mountain slopes that the Ski Club comes down. The Freewheelers Cycling Club, now in its second year, schedules one-day bike trips to such destinations as Table Rock State Park and Whitewater Falls, as well as staging bike races and Bike-a-thons. From high in the clouds, the Dixie Skydivers present a free fall exhibition. It is recognized as one of the oldest parachuting clubs in the country. George Mylcr, president of the Frisbcc Club, demon- strates the expertise and concentration needed to suc- cessfully perform freestyle frisbce skills. Joel Mi»rs 26-Studcnt Life If aerodynamics are your thing, you can think small and seek out the Frisbee Club, or on a grander scale, the Aero Club and Dixie Skydivers await you. The Frisbee Club, has participated in the National Ul- timate Championship series for the past two seasons. The Sailing Club offers new members the excitement of racing or the tranquility of a leisurely cruise on the lake. The Scuba Club provides the equipment and training necessary for exploring the inner world. The club has taken trips to the Florida Keys and Panama City. The Lacrosse Team practices year round in order to be ready to compete with other universities such as Duke and Georgia. Raymond Teaster Student Life-27 Clubs . . . The Aero Club provides university folk with the opportunity to learn to fly, and stresses flight safety above all. The club has a Precision Flight Team that competes regionally, and the club has recently begun offering hang gliding instruction. The Dixie Skydivers present the student with the unique experience of going up for airplane rides but returning to the ground without the flying machine. The Dixie Sky-Divers is recognized as one of the ol- dest parachuting clubs in the country and seeks to promote skydiving as a safe and exciting sport. For the student who prefers the water to the air, there are several aquatically-based campus organizations. The Sailing Club boasts nine Coronado 15 boats that are operated out of Y Beach on Lake Hartwell. The club sponsors a sailing team that competes at intercollegiate events which last year qualified for the National Championships at Long Beach, California, placing sixth overall. The Water Ski Club offers the opportu- nity to move much faster over the lake surface than would the sailing club, but the potential for getting wet is significant- ly higher as each trip is guaranteed to start and end partially submerged. There is an even \"deeper\" club than the Ski Club however, for the Scuba Club makes a point of taking extended sub-sur- face jaunts. The club provides the equip- ment and training necessary for exploring the \"inner-world.\" The Clemson Sports Car Club offers an outlet for those who would rather explore performance limits on the land than in the sea. One of the oldest sports car clubs in South Carolina, the club sponsors auto- crossing and cornerworking projects. The recent donation of an actual Formula Vee race car by local racer Hampton Williams has also led to the proposed formation of a racing team. The Bowling Club on campus utilizes the ten-lane alley in the student union and gives students the opportunity to keep their hands in when it comes to going after that spare or split. The University Rifle Team devotes its time to range-shooting in the basement of Wannamaker Hall and participates in meets, while the Rod and Gun Club is devoted to the outdoors with emphasis on conservation and good sportsmanship in its outdoor pursuits. by Mark Sublette 28-Sludcnt Life Joel Mears Gymnastics coach aids a member of the team on a balance beam routine.

Student Life-29 Shagging, sun, sand, and suds arc the ingredients required for an enjoyable beach festival. The only thing the) need now is a little surf. The Corporation is another haven tor shag tans. These people here demonstrate the steps which have had a recent re-emergence. If Confuscious said, \"A T-shirt tells all.\" then there would be no doubt in anyone's mind that this person is a true shag fanatic. Raymond Teaster ) Richard Walkup \"i Studenl I ife \"I Love Beach Music\" Never mind that it doesn't make a stand on social equality, doesn't help solve world hunger or contributes to world peace. Ig- nore the fact that some of its most loyal devotees weren't even alive when the first 78 began spinning in some forgotten beach pavillion twenty-some-old years ago. The music isn't supposed to have any message, except perhaps one — feel hap- py. And although the pavillion beach mu- sic was introduced to America it has prob- ably long since either closed its doors or washed away, the spirit and the music re- main. More than remain — they thrive. The music and the loping soft dance that accompanies it, the shag, have trav- eled up from the coast and found a new home in the upper piedmont of the South. In fact, beach music has grown from a coastal cult item into one of the biggest forms of entertainment for those tired of whirling lights and disco nights. \"I just kind of got tired of the canned atmosphere in discos,\" said one Clemson coed at Bollwinkle's, a local shagging shrine. \"I don't know, I guess the beach music, the shag, it has the kind of atmo- sphere I'm looking for. It's easy-going, it's nice. I guess it sort of struck the right nerve in me.\" Beach music has struck that same nerve in thousands of couples in hundreds of for- mer discos. It's interesting to note that Bollwinkle's was built inside what was once a disco that burned down. Too much disco inferno, perhaps. The heroes of shagging and beach music aren't flashy like John Travolta. They can't fly around the floor on their own television show like Denny Terio. They don't have flashing lights, clouds of smoke, or a \"boom-boom\" disco beat that drives couples up the walls or blasts them out the doors. How has it survived the years? First of all, it's happy music. Around college towns, where architecture to zoo- logy and all classes in between can bring students down, the music and gentle danc- ing can chase away a day of troubles. \"When this old world starts bringing you down ...\" as the Drifters' song goes. Second, the mere fact that you don't have to be John Travolta or Denny Terio to dance to the music increases its popu- larity. To shag, you need three things: someone to dance with (people look at you funny if you shag by yourself), some shag- ging (i.e. beach) music, and two feet (left or right). Take your partner's hand (or hands if you're not too shy) and begin shuffling backwards and forwards in a loping three- step. After a few minor collisions with your partner, you're a natural shagger. After a few dances, you might decide to be more daring in your dancing, but basically the loping step that gave shagging its name is all there is to it. Another reason for the dance's popular- ity is the amazing degree of informality it allows. To be tops at disco, costume plays an important role. New Wave requires costume that might not otherwise be seen this side of Halloween. But all a person needs for shagging is a pair of soft shoes, soft music and, prefer- ably, soft lights. The costume can be any- thing from the preppiest wool skirt and sweater, to the more traditional docksiders and khakies, and even ancient garb like Bermuda shorts and polo shirts. Of course, there won't ever be a show on television called \"Shag Fever,\" either. As a rule there's not as much energy (or hu- man contorsion) involved in dancing to beach music. \"Why should I want to throw the girl I'm dancing with around,\" asked one shagger at a beach music festival on the Y-Beach. \"If I wanted to throw her around, we'd be at the all-star wrestling. Student Life-31 \"I want to dance with her. That's why we shag. It may not be as much fun to watch, but it's sure more fun to partici- pate.\" The stars of shagging aren't as flashy or rich as the kings of the disco. They are not as up-to-date as leaders of New Wave. In a sense, they are a sort of throwback to earlier, less hectic days. Their names-the Drifters, Platters, Embers, Catalinas- would have long ago been buried under the dust of a generation, had they been al- lowed to lie untouched. But unlike countless rock-and-roll bands that faded into the depths of obscur- ity, the best of the beach bands have not only endured but thrived. While \"who- dats\" like Judas and the Traitors, Francis X and the Bushmen, and ever popular Morgan David and the Grapes of Wrath have earned a well-deserved place in the old musicians home, the shaggers and beach bands keep rolling. \"I mean we could have packed it in a long time ago,\" said a drummer at a beach festival last fall. \"We could have changed our format. Some of the other guys did. But you see who's still around. We struck with what we felt would work. And we worked with what we felt. The kids come back. They always do, and I think they always will. \"Sooner or later, I'll get out of the busi- ness. We all will. But right now it's fun and it pays good. Why should we leave? Be- sides, it has a certain something that no other music has.\" Perhaps the \"certain something\" beach music has was best seen in last fall's festi- val. A half hour before the first band ap- peared on-stage, black rolling clouds threatened to wash away the 1,800 or so shagging enthusiasts. When the group climbed onto the stage and began to play, a burst of light broke through the clouds, as if on cue. Soon the clouds had broken, and the couples began their serious shagging. The rain didn't threaten for the rest of the day. That's not to say that playing beach mu- 7 hough there is a limited space in the crowd at the be;ich festival, these two avid fhaggen create a makeshift dance floor Itudenl l ilc sic would ease tensions in the Middle East, stop hurricanes in their tracks, or open vast new fields of alternate energy. It does, however, make these problems easier to live with. And, in a world beset with prob- lems, that says a lot. How long will the music stay? It's been floating on summer breezes since the mid- dle fifties, or before most students now in college were even born. Since most shag- gers don't really begin shagging until they reach college, the music doesn't get stale no matter how many times you hear it. Disco is dying. New Wave hasn't reached people yet. Maybe it never will. Beach music is working on its second gen- eration of shaggers, with no signs of stop- ping. It's reasonable to believe that in a few years, a third generation of shaggers will still move to the music of the Chair- men of the Board or the Drifters, chanting the slogan of the last 25 years: \"I love beach music.\" by Chick Jacobs Kathy Moorcr and John Williams exhibit their danc- ing techniques by doing the shag at the recently established bar.

Student Life-33 Students Find Spring A Time When Winter Dreams Become A Reality Bronzed and burnt bodies crowding the ledges of Johnston and the roofs of the highrises, elevators reeking of coconut oil, empty desks in every classroom, professors giving up on three cut limits, and week- ends ending on Monday and beginning on Tuesdays; they can call it Spring Fever, but at Clemson in the springtime it was more of a calm, layed-back attitude. It's not that we didn't care, it's that we didn't care quite so much. A sure sign that spring had arrived was when the residents of Mauldin Hall left their clothes behind to bare their bodies to the sun for any interested or, for that mat- ter, uninterested passers-by. Others at- tempted-and seldom succeeded-at working in classes between prime time sun hours, diligently bringing their books along with their towels and Hawaiian Tropic to the East Bank or Y-Beach only to use their Physics 222 textbook for a headrest. When students did make it to class, instead of the usual comparing of notes from previous lectures it was the comparison of skintones from Sun Science 101 the day before. The tendency to forget academics was encour- aged by such traditional spring events as beer gardens, Bengal Ball, Dixie Day, and Greek Week. Clemson Beer Gardens usually took place on the East Bank and were an appe- tizer for the long-awaited Bengal Ball. At the Student Union-sponsored Bengal Ball there was Southern Country Rock from the Marshall Chapman Band, plenty of liquid from the Budweiser trucks, and there were lines. The lines began when tickets went on sale for the event and con- tinued on April 19 as students waited pa- tiently for beer and impatiently for bath- rooms. Sororities competed in Dixie Day events organized by Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and The campus water treatment plant provided some ideal spots for sun worshipers to relax and soak up rays while cutting class. • J- ■ . -r*v ''Mh : l *< N 0P ... A later the fraternities participated in the Interfraternity Council's Greek Week. Once again the students of Clemson found an excuse for more sun-worshipping, beer guzzling, and \"izzy-dizzing\". Pledges pulled originally-designed chariots ridden by the particular fraternity's chosen Greek God and Goddess. Both the soroities and fraternities participated in Sorority and Greek Sings, sports such as softball, foot- ball, volleyball, and basketball in addition to the day's events including tug-of-wars, three-legged races, and the ultimate beer chugging contest. All spring events were not purely for individual self-indulgence, one such being the First Annual Football Marathon spon- sored by the Interfraternity Council for the benefit of the Cancer Society. All or- ganizations on campus were invited to par- ticipate and compete against the group of their choice. As the organizations played all through the night they raised over two thousand dollars. A sure sign that summer is getting closer is the feel- ing that one needs a reservation to get a spot at Y- Beach during Bengal Ball. With classes behind him, this Clemson student enjoys the sprint with a Bud and a frisbee. Marty Evans Glenn Stephens Student Life-35 Richard Walkup Raymond Teaster 36-Studcnt Life . Spring Marty Evans During the spring session students never seemed to succeed at buckling down to their studies as they had in the fall, and as Spring Break approached the cause seemed hopeless. Whether it was travel- ling three hours to Myrtle Beach, half a day to Fort Lauderdale, or the entire week cruising through the Caribbean, everyone relaxed and intellectually hibernated. Perhaps the spring semester was not as action-packed as the fall semester, but it gave the students the enjoyment of step- ping outside the walls of academia to, even if just briefly, get the rest they may or may not have deserved. The only regrets about the leisurely spring term came when the long suffering parents stared in shock at the 1.9 GPR which fell just a bit short of the hoped for 3.5. by Deborah Crandall and Celia Robinson Dixie Day, sponsored by Beta Theta Pi, was a time when fraternities and sororities enjoyed sports and, of course, the beer. One of the main obstacles to getting that golden- brown look is excessive thirst — a problem which this coed seems to have solved. Frisbee throwing has evolved into a high art on most campuses, and Clemson is no exception. With the coming of spring, thoughts turn to members of the opposite sex.

Homecoming 1980 was no exception to the rule. As the Physical Plant moved in with strings of electrical wiring and truck- loads of telephone poles, a mass of omi- nous-looking clouds followed closely be- hind them. The downpour began the Sunday night before Homecoming, bringing with it the first cold weather of the season.

But, as luck would have it, the clouds began to break up on Wednesday morning, and the rain stopped entirely by lunchtime. The resultant increase in activity in front of the loggia and on Bowman field was some- thing wondrous to behold. Fraternity and sorority members appeared in droves, and the displays began to take on recognizable shapes. Not everyone was busy with the dis- plays, however. Many students worked fe- verishly to prepare skits and other presen- tations for Friday nights Tigerama festivi- ties.

(ilenn Stephens Raymond I easier 46-Studcnt Life (>reeg Collins Student Life-47 Organizations On Parade Organizations' Day, held on September 10, was a big success. Seventy organiza- tions participated in the \"Carnival of Or- ganizations.\" A variety of science, sport, academic, military, religious and political clubs along with several fraternities and sororities were represented. The clubs set up displays along senior sidewalk, between Tilman and Riggs Halls, to attract new members. Displays ranged from simple to elabo- rate. Students strolled along the sidewalk stopping here and there at the organiza- tions that they were interested in. The Rugby Club presented a rugby film for interested students. The Outing Club set up tents. Religious organizations gave reli- gious materials to the students that stopped and talked to representatives. The Aero Club had two planes on display. The Sport Car Club had a miniature grand prix car and another sports car. Other displays included livestock, plants, mice, and politi- cal bumper stickers. Through the use of displays, organizations were able to show students what they had to offer. A large part of the events' success can be attributed to Joey Lemmons, Student Government Vice-President. He started preparations for Organizations' Day in September. A letter was sent to each club leader this fall specifying the location, date and time of the event. Lemmons es- tablished a special committee for Organi- zations' Day and appointed Carroll Der- rick as chairman of the temporary com- mittee. The committee published and dis- tributed a guide to campus organizations. Organizations' Day originated in 1973. It has usually been held during the second week of September. The Vice-President of Student Government is responsible for or- ganizing the event, which has enjoyed overwhelming success throughout its his- tory. The location was changed this year to the senior sidewalk area. Last year's loca- tion was Bowman Field. The location for Organizations' Day has see-sawed back and forth between these two areas through-out the event's history. Each loca- tion has its advantages and disadvantages. Joey Lemmons felt that Bowman Field was out of the way for the average student. Members of the campus EMT squad demonstrate the method ofcardio-pulmonary-rcsuscitation on a Resi- Anne.

The shade, pro- vided by the numerous trees along the sidewalk, was a welcomed relief from the late summer sun's scorching rays. This year, the budget for the event was three hundred dollars. Most of the money was utilized to provide electricity for sev- eral organizations that had requested it. The estimated price tag for the event was two hundred and fifty dollars. -Bill Wyeth \"Speed\" Bouknight. editor-in-chief of the Chronicle, Clemson's variety magazine, attempts to attract new members to his staff.

Pam Maddox Student Life-49 Marlv Evans Jobs On Campus Offer Financial Aid If a student at Clemson finds him or herself short of working capital while at school, there are a number of options available, depending on when the cash is- needed and for what purpose. For the student who needs immediate cash for survival, the work-study program exists as a means for him or her to partial- ly subsidize the costs of college. Some 325 students took part in this job program dur- ing the fall semester, with many jobs being keyed as much as possible to students' ma- jor fields of study. To apply for work-study jobs, a student must submit a Financial Aid Form so that his financial need can assessed. This is necessary as 80 percent of the funding for work-study pay is provided by the federal government, with only 20 percent coming out of university budgets.

Funding for these employees is out of regular universi- ty payroll monies, and as such, these jobs aren't restricted to just those in marked financial distress. Paying anywhere from $3. 1 0 to $3.40 an hour, these jobs involve just about ever- ything from tending beertaps at Edgar's, the student union night club, to stamping books at the library. And for those with long-range financial assistance needs, the Cooperative Educa- tion program exists to allow students to get on-the-job training with career-related firms by alternating school and work se- mesters. by Mark Sublette Many departments on campus offer a wide range of jobs for students employed in the work-study pro- gram.

They are the new right, the far right ultra- conservative evangelicals. Traditionally only seven percent of evangelicals actually voted. The Presidential election, however, with its moral issues motivated millions more to register and vote. National organizations such as Moral Majority and The National Christian Ac- tion Coalition were established to rally the Christian vote. They seek to motivate Christians to vote as the Bible directs them. In 1963, the Supreme Court banned prayer in public schools. The new right is in favor of reversing this. They are op- posed to abortion, homosexual rights, pas- sage of the Equal Rights Amendment, pornography, and \"various movements de- signed to undermine the traditional family unit as God ordained it.\" On Tuesday, October 21, 1980, the movement hit Clemson University as Christians from on campus and the sur- rounding communities stood on Johnstone plaza and shared their views. Under the banner reading \"Christians Care for America\" speeches were made proclaim- ing that \"America has been great because America has been good, but when Amer- ica ceases to be good it will cease to be great!\" All in attendance knelt in prayer that they as individuals would make a dif- ference on their campus and in their na- tion. In addition to the political activity, Christians on campus sponsored the na- tionally touring band \"City Lights,\" dur- ing the week of November 3, 1980. Their performances were well attended during the warm afternoons on Johnstone plaza and evenings in the Palmetto Room. They related the Gospel to the lyrical content of Contemporary Rock and performed many instrumental selections also. To help promote and coordinate Chris- tian activities such as the above, the re- cently recognized Christian Fellowship Council was formed. Consisting of seven Christian organizations, the fellowship has as two of its goals to arrange a Christian concert series, and hold a field day entitled \"Agape Day.\" by Hal Waters As this banner waved above, the Christians below expressed their views on the election year's moral issues. \"Vote Morality\" was the very visible theme of the rally. Student Life-53 Student \"art\" Airs Opinions A large university such as Clemson al- ways boasts an extensive public relations department whose duty it is to inform the public of the campus news and activities. This would probably seem like the organi- zation most capable of communicating the campus actions and reactions to the issues that shape the school's atmosphere and activities. This is not always altogether true, how- ever. For no matter how topical a public relations department attempts to be, it still has to reflect an \"official\" attitude for the university, and this does not always jive with actual campus feelings. There is another source of news, of cam- pus undercurrents, that much more accu- rately reflects the feelings of the students, and which may actually be faster than the P.R. releases dispatched by the media folk in the Trustee House. There are the many interesting and frequently entertaining banners, signs, and \"dorm art\" produced by the denizens of the dormitories at Clemson. The issues dealt with in these wild, imaginative, and occasionally risque state- ments of opinion can range from the mun- dane topics of daily campus life such as exams to the international issues like the Iran crisis. Signs can be friendly, such as the \"Wel- come Home, Alumni\" that some halls hang out to welcome ex-residents of the dorm, or hostile, exemplified best by the quasi-threatening statements of \"What Our Team is Gonna Do to Your Team\" so prevalent in the twenty-four hours prior to sports events. Typic.il ni the \"we're number one!\" style posters that frequently decorate dormitories on game weekends, was this effort for the football season opener. ( 'instruction material', left near the hall gave B-5, long one of the more vocally entertaining halls, fod- der for this gag sign (ilenn Stephens 54-Studen) I ife I But this can also extend to criticism of campus situations just as readily. It was truly stunning to see the speed with which \"Give 'em hell Pell!\" signs gave way to \"Go to hell Pell!\" statements on the fateful December evening in 1978 when word spread that Coach Charlie had opted to leave Clemson for the University of Flor- ida even before the football season had been finished. So whether the topic is a campus issue, praise for favorite rock groups, (Skynard Lives!), or just blowing off steam, dorm artwork and decorations can be counted on to accurately gauge the student view- point on the world. by Mark Sublette Paying homage to the concept double album \"The Wall,\" some exacting artist reproduced the band's name on the Riggs Field bleachers wall. Sunday mornings are likely to find the Greenville News almost buried among the Saturday night party decorations such as these on E-5.

There are fourteen fraternities governed by the Interfraternitiy Council. There are also seven national sororities on the Clem- son campus. These sororities operate un- der the supervision of the Panhellenic Council. Greek life encompasses a broad range of social activities, athletics, service projects, and other university-related events. Many of the projects that Clemson's fraternities and sororities participate in are very visi- ble; however, a large number of activities, especially those with a charitable nature go relatively unnoticed by those not in- volved in the Greek system. The fall semester begins with sorority rush during the week of registration. Girls interested in pledging a sorority attend parties throughout the week and are pledged on the Monday of the first week of classes. Fraternity rush begins during the week prior to the first football game.

Probably the week during which the ac- tivities of sororities and fraternitites are most visible is Homecoming Week. Fra- ternities spend both time and money con- structing the homecoming displays that annually adorn Bowman Field. Sororities and fraternities participate in the Tiger- ama skits that attract in excess of twenty- five thousand people to Death Valley on the Friday night prior to the Homecoming game.

Cunter Wiedemann Student Life-59 Raymond T easier After Class, It's Down To The Bars There was once a time when you could take a drive to a little college town on the eastern edge of Oconee County, S.C., and you would roll into the town on the main highway between Atlanta and Charlotte. The road dipped down into a small valley, skipped across the winding, muddy Seneca River on what was, for many years, a cov- ered bridge, and after skirting the fields of the agricultural college, would curve up- hill to the left for the final stretch to the main campus and town. And just as the driver came out of that last bend in the road, he could glance left and see a small business operation consisting of a combi- nation gas station and store/tavern. Tom Wolfe, a native of Asheville, N.C., must have seen it during his travels through the Piedmont region, for he wrote a poem inspired by local flavor of that little gas station-tavern and titled it \"Shark's Parlor.\" It must have been an interesting place, for as the areas's only watering hole, all of the fascinating local types would gather there. Wolfe, however, is also the sage individ- ual who observed that \"you can't go home again.\" No statement is truer than in the case of that little drive to town. The little agricultural college is now a booming uni- versity with vastly diverse schools of in- struction, it is now located in Pickens County, and the fields and most of the riverbed are at'the bottom of a 25 year old lake. But there is still a combination gas sta- tion/tavern on the last stretch into town and to the main campus of what is mod- ern-day Clemenson University. That little bar, now known as Bob's Esso Club, has remained remarkably unchanged in char- acter through the year's even if its configu- ration has been revised a number of times. And it is no longer the only place in the college community to snag ones self a brew. Just out of tradition, the Esso Club is an interesting place. It has survived the de- mise of the corporate trademark that gave it its name, and still intentionally seeks to maintain a rustic atmosphere. The bar consists of re-used seats from the old Riggs Field football stands. It is the only bar in town that can boast of receiving a letter from Billy Carter, and the Rugby Team claims the Esso Club as its own. So if you like the pick-up truck and hiking boots atmosphere, the Esso Club awaits you. The face of the Clemson downtown has also changed drastically during the last few decades. From a town without a single tavern in the business district to one that seems dominated by beer-selling establish- ments, the city of Clemson has seen it all. It wasn't until 1967 that downtown's first saloon arrived in the form of the Study Hall, which was opened by two local businessmen as the site of a restaurant previously known as Grady's Tiger Inn. Early advertisements emphasized the availability of \"your favorite beverages.\" In the fall of 1968 the two operators split up, with one retaining the Study Hall operation, while the other renovated the old Feed Bag location across the street into the plush (at first) Red Carpet Lounge, featuring a full menu plus beer. Due to the larger amount of space avail- able for partying at the Red Carpet, it became the hang-out for several years, and legends of hie incredible volume of kegs cycled through the Carpet's taps still sur- vive. So it was by the early 1970's that Clem- son had discovered a nightlife. Bars began to open up in every available corner, a trend that has not abated yet. On a weekday night, student movement to the down- town burs start later than during the weekend. Some- times, the bars aren't filled until ten o'clock. Within a short driving distance, the Corporation of- fers both beer and liquor drinks to satisfy the tu- dent's thirst, after dancing on the disco's dance Poor. Raymond I easier * 60-Studcnt Life The infamous Red Carpet would even- tually close after the red neck influence had dragged it down to a point wherein students no longer wanted to patronize it. A shooting in the late 1975 in the bar sounded the death kneel for the best known tavern in Clemson. But the Red Carpet location was revived as a tavern in the fall of 1975 with the opening of the Tigertown Tavern, and fol- lowing three successful years in operation, the bar eventually acquired the closed Ti- ger Bite Site restaurant next door and ex- panded through the wall in the summer of 1980. The Tavern offers the best sound system in town and rock is the staple of the musi- cal offerings. Live albumn sides have re- placed the taped music of previous years, and the bar probably cycles more custom- ers through than any other establishment in downtown simply because it is so large. The Study Hall continues to plug along, much as it did when first opened, although a casette deck sound system has replaced the juke boxes of yore, but upstairs and downstairs maintain a relaxed atmosphere more conducive to conversation than in the louder music bard. Another entry in the loud bar category is the Bookstore, which can also claim the closest location to campus. The music is Robert Bouknight provided by either disc jockeys or tape, and the musical offerings are also diverse, featuring a mixture of rock, disco, Beach, and (thanks to the commercial success of John Travolta's film \"Urban Cowboy\") even a cowboy night. The Bookstore, a favorite of the campus Greek world, is another bar that traces its heritage from a restaurant-turned tavern.

When he sold out, the Tiger Paw Restaurant took over and offered boxed chicken lunches. Eventual- ly, the Tiger Paw acquired a beer license and slowly but surely their food operation was eclipsed by their beer sales. By 1973 it had stopped serving meals at all. But poor vigilance at the door was its downfall as agents from the state alcoholic beverage control board revoked the Tiger Paw's li- cense due to too many minor drinkers. This cleared the way for the Bookstore, and it continues to carry on, though with much improved decor than the Tiger Paw ever offered. The Bookstore offers one of two dance floors in downtown. The other is at the Tigertown Tavern. Nick's is an interesting establishment. Depending on the time of day one visits it, it can either be a quiet place to sit and talk or a rowdy place with shoulder-to-shoul- der people. Open in the late morning, Nick's is one of the few taverns that has an operating kitchen, and their fried mush- rooms must be tried to be believed. They also serve up some pretty satisfying sand- wiches and fries. One of the rowdier fra- ternities on campus has claimed Nick's as home, as has the track team, and Bruce Springsteen is almost an honorary custom- er due to his popularity there. The most recent downtown bar (that is still in business) is the Sloan Street Tap- room which catches the Rugby team over- flow that the Esso Club can't handle. This is probably the most debauched bar in town, and they're proud of it. The juke box contains a most curious mix of C & W, rock and funk tunes, and they sound truly bizarre for the machine's motor is wearing out, creating interesting renditions as it gains and loses speed. Rumors are heard of a new drinking spot that is supposed to occupy a vacant location above the Taproom, and licenses have apparently been issued, but there is no telling if and when it might open. The town's winner for the most busin- esses-in-one-location award must go to the cubbyhole above Nick's that has been The Attic, Brothers Two, The Upper Level, The Loft, and Crazy Ed's, among others, during a seven period. It would appear that the spot isn't economically feasible to run a bar in, though one might try. Other watering holes in the area are widely dispersed. Edgar's on campus is op- erated by the University Union and pro- vides a most convenient service as it is the center of the campus' biggest dorm com- plex. Live acts appear on week-ends here and it offers a convenient on-campus stop- over point. Four Paws Amusement Center in the University Mini-Mall is a full-scale beer- serving arcade and offers billiards, pinball, and a variety of other games and ma- chines. It is also one of just three busin- esses that has stayed in operation in the mall since it was opened in the late sum- mer of 1975. David Ingram Mark Sublette 62-Studcni Life I The Tiger Den sits out on highway 123 where it meets highway 76 and dates from the mid or late 1960's. Though mostly ca- tering to the four-wheeler or pick-up crowd, this establishment is also frequent- ed by some fraternities. Lamar's, across highway 123 from the old train station, is one of the few places in town with a liquor license, and has catered to a little classier crowd through the years than the run-of-the-mill downtown bars. Several major scenes from the 1973 film \"The Midnight Man\", starring Burt Lan- caster and Cameron Mitchell, were shot there. ^ Boll Winkle's occupies the site next to Colonel Saunder's on 123 and is the latest in a line of bars that included the bankrupt Library Club, the arsoned Fat Cat's Disco, and the stillborne Music Hall. It is often likened to the infamous Crazy Zacks of Myrtle Beach, and is a favorite for shag- gers. Bottoms Up, a private club on College Avenue, offers memberships at very low prices and simultaneously provided a neat dodge around the archaic blue laws of the state. It caters heavily to the black crowd, but everybody turns out on Wednesday nights to get wasted on \"all the beer and wine you can drink\" for a nominal entry price. The Clemson area's only real disco is The Corporation, halfway to Central on highway 93. It is a pretty fair piece out from campus unless one has a car, but last year's shuttle bus service attempt was not justified by the ridership. \"The Corp\", as it is nicknamed, has a liquor license. It has also picked up on the success of \"Urban Cowboy\" and has even brought in one of the outrageously expensive artificial bulls for would-be rodeo champs to try their hands (and courage) on. So, with over a dozen taverns, bars, pubs, and so forth, well established in the Clemson community, someone may not be able to go home again, but he can darn sure find a place in which to get a beer! by Mark Sublette Joel Mears Tiger Town Tavern, having been remodeled over the summer months, now has a larger crowd than ever before.

The purposes of recruting, mo- tivating, educating, and commissioning of- ficers into military service remains the same despite the many changes in the pro- grams through the years. ROTC enrollment has steadily in- creased in the past few years. The military science (Army) program claims an enroll- ment of 230 students, while 226 students are enrolled in the courses offered by the Aerospace Studies (Air Force) depart- ment. Part of the enrollment increase can be attributed to the registration program enacted by Congress during the spring of 1980. Each of the ROTC programs is divided into two levels. The first two years, which is open to all students, is known as the General Military Corps. Enrollment in this level does not obligate the student to military service. The advanced program is the second level of each program. Interested students undergo testing and evaluation, before be- ing admitted into the Professional Officer Corps. Students in this program receive a tax-free allowance of $ 1 00 for each month of the school year. In return the student agrees to serve a certain number of years as an officer. The Army requires e'ach advanced pro- gram cadet to serve six years after gradu- ation. A portion of the committment may be served as in the Reserves. The Air Force advanced cadet incurs an obligation of between four and six years. Non-flying officers must serve four years, while pilots and navigators have six year committ- ments. Both programs require that advanced cadets complete a summer camp program before commissioning. The Army cadet attends camp between his junior and sen- ior year for a six-week period. The Army camp is held at Fort Bragg, North Caroli- na. Summer camp for Air Force cadets occurs between the cadet's sophomore and junior year. Cadets that have completed the first two years of basic courses spend four weeks at camp, while other cadets receive six weeks of training. Summer camp for Air Force cadets is held at var- ious bases across the nation. Room, board, and transportation to and from camp is provided to the cadet free of charge. Each program has several organizations affiliated to it. The Air Force has two such organizations. The Arnold Air Society is an honorary military fraternity. The Flying Tiger Angel Flight is the coed aux- iliary to the Arnold Air Society. These groups sponsor many activities including a blood drive for the Carolina Blood Center. The Army also has a number of organi- zations. The Pershing Rifles has two groups on campus; Company C-4 is a drill team, while the Fourth Regimental Head- quarters coordinates the drill meets for the 64-Studcnl Life Raymond Teasler ;, MM Southeastern United States. The Clemson Rangers are a tactical unit which stresses survival and other combat skills. Scabbard and Blade is a military honor fraternity open to cadets in both programs. This group sponsors the annual Military Ball and Banquet held in the spring. Both programs are doing well despite having to relocate because of the renova- tion of Tillman Hall. The Military Science offices are currently housed next to the Post Office and courses are conducted in Godfrey Hall. The Aerospace Studies de- partment moved into two trailers across from the Redfern Health Center and holds classes in Long Hall. The patriotic wave during the Seventies has boosted the enrollment in the pro- grams which had been declining as a result of the unrest during the Sixties. Both pro- grams anticipate enrollment to continue to increase during the current decade. by Bill Wyeth I ^ mm. \\:l Army ROTC cadets dash across the field in prepara- tion for entering the \"Huey\" helicoptor that will carry them to lab sites such as Clark Hill Welsite.

Cunter Wiedemann Gunter Wiedemann Student Life-65 Vocalists: A Dedicated Lot Clemson University is blessed to have several excellent music organizations on its campus, despite the fact that state leg- islature seldom see fit to fund music pro- grams at two state universities simulta- neously. As the college located in the state capi- tal has a full music school, music programs at Clemson have generally survived on lean budgets, and great dedication by the participants. The Clemson University Chorus is made up of such dedicated sutdents, for they put a huge effort into the organization, while receiving minimal credit from the univer- sity for the hours they invest. A person enrolled in the chorus, or any of Clemson's performing musical organizations, will be given a single hour of credit for an entire semester of effort. And that's no small amount, either. In addition to four and a half hours of clas- stime during the week, chorus members perform at all home football games, lead- ing the stadium in the National Anthem and the Alma Mater, while accompanied by the Tiger Band. They are also on call to perform during the Homecoming game half-time show when they present a mini-concert prior to the new Homecoming queen and her court being brought aroung the field on a float. Chorus members present public con- certs at the Christmas end of first semes- ter, and again in the spring immediately following their return from Spring Tour, a several day-long jaunt that carries them all over the Southeast.

But if their official rewards are so mea- ger, why do 94 students continue to lavish their time on the activity? It is really pret- ty simple — participating in a performing musical group offers experience unlike any other. Chorus members have the satisfaction of working very closely with one another, and long-lived friendships are not an un- usual by-product of being in the group. The opportunities to travel a bit are also a part of it. Choral tours in the past have included expeditions to North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. And the exotic experiences that come from traveling en masse with ninety people, all of whom are a definite common interest, can be the source of some of the fondest recollections of a college experience. So the next time that gowned groups of vocalists walk out onto the football field to lead the crowd in song, you can be sure that they have lavished much time and effort to entertain and inspire. by Mark Sublette The pre-game festivities always feature the singing of the National Anthem and the Clemson Alma Mater, led by the University Chorus and accompanied by Tiger Band. Gunter Wiedemann Student Life-67 Tillman Gets A Facelift Have you been awakened in your room by loud hammering noises lately? If you have, you are only one of the many people that are enduring the renovation of Tillman Hall. But don't worry; construction should be complet- ed by August of 1981, or so says D.J. Boyer, who is in charge of the renovation project. The construction caused problems not only to the light sleepers around campus, but also to the many classes and other functions that found themselves without homes when con- struction began. Many students found them- selves shuffled around campus in order to meet their classes. The contract for the renovation was signed in January of 1980, and work soon began on the Clemson monument. The entire interior is being remodeled, with the wood and masonry contents being discarded in favor of non- flammable materials. The fire marshall or- dered the building to be closed because of susceptibility to fire and its lack of fire exits. The exterior of the building will remain essentially unchanged, while the design calls for the floor plans on the second, third, and fourth levels to be utilized to their full capaci- ties. The presently unused fourth floor will be opened after fire safety regulations have been satisfied. The addition of an elevator is also required by law, and along with existing stair- ways should make the upper floors more ac- cessible. Plans also call for the main floor to be restored to its original condition. Another part of Tillman being remodeled is the auditorium, known as Memorial chap- el. The chapel could once hold 1500 people including standing as well as seating area. Because of the large number of people that it often held, the standing audience many times could not see or hear the performance. This is now being changed. After renovation, Memo- rial Chapel will hold only 900 people, but conditions will be much more favorable. All the seats will be cushioned and in clear view of the stage. Also, a new lighting and sound system will be in operation. Dressing rooms will be built to accomodate the performers. All in all, it should be an excellent facility for the performing arts. Kim Ambrose The renovation of Tillman Hall has become a major endeavor, requiring large amounts of manpower. The project should be copleted by Spring of 1981 Memorial Chapel is one ol the mam areas undergoing reconstruction The available backstage area is being expanded considerably. 6K-Studcnl I ife V Photos by Glenn Stephens and Raymond Teaster Student Life-69 Richard Baldwin An Inconvenience But A Necessity It may seem to many Clemson students that the only thing constant about the campus is its continual state of change. Every year, new obstacles are thrown up that in some way impede the student's pro- gress in completing his appointed rounds. A hand-drawn campus map in the 1974 edition of TAPS bears the legend: \"The shortest distance between any two points on campus is either blocked or under con- struction\"; a statement that holds true even today. The newest of the constant changes around the Clemson campus consist of construction to meet the special needs of handicapped students. According to sec- tion 504 of a recently enacted South Caro- lina law, all public buildings: such as those on the university campus must be designed so that mobility is available to the phys- ically handicapped. Such rennovation is also necessary to make Clemson eligible to receive certain federal funds. D.J. Boyer, head of the building opera- tion, stated that Clemson has at present only three areas in which the handicapped. Massive redesign of some campus sites, such us the hill between Hardin and Bracket Halls, will now permit handicapped access to previously unreachable locations Karen Moore, an RPA major from Pendleton, is trying out this wheelchair to see if she can better feel and understand the problems of the handicapped Pam Maddox 70 Student Life such as those in wheelchairs, cannot trans- port themselves. These locations are Riggs Hall, and the first and second levels of the library. Upon completion of the project, the physically handicapped will be able to access any classroom or facility on cam- pus. The main thrust of the construction pro- gram is the addition of elevators in Riggs, Martin, Sirrine, and Long Halls. Some secondary construction includes the addition of wheelchair ramps on the sidewalks and at the entrance to all cam- pus buildings. A former parking lot be- tween Brackett and Hardin Halls has been graded and repaved to provide a gentler slope for wheelchair students desiring en- trance to east campus, and numerous handicapped parking spaces around cam- pus have been marked off for their exclu- sive use. Many students complained about the in- conveniences caused by the construction, which in some cases caused major changes in the direction of pedestrian traffic flow. But even though the structures are a nui- sance to some students, they will hopefully provide the basis for a growing handi- capped population in the future. by Greg Nobles This elevator being constructed outside Martin Hall will allow Clemson's handicapped students to reach classes in Martin, Kinard, and Daniel Halls. After many months of construction, this elevator equipped to aid handicapped students reach the west side of the campus, is finally nearing completion. unter Wiedtminn Student Life-7! Responding To | Emergencies From its start in October of 1978, there were some doubts as to whether an all student volunteer ambu- lance service could be dependable. However, student Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) soon proved that they could handle the task, and students have responded by giving the service more calls each year. The formation of a campus Emergency Medical Service (EMS) was brought about by an accident in the fall of 1977 when a student was injured while working on a homecoming float. It took Pickens County EMS 20-30 minutes to arrive at the accident due to some radio difficulties. Regardless of the rea- son, there was an obvious need for an ambulance service at Clemson. The wheel was set in motion the following April 1978 when the EMT club was formed to provide training for the student EMT and to promote emer- gency medical services on campus. The EMT club has since changed its name to University EMS, which is not to be confused with the actual ambulance service of the same name. Planned by student volunteers. Rescue 2 is university owned and maintained. Rescue 2 is capable of handling almost any emergency. Glen McManus applies a leg traction splint to Eugene Bauer while Kip Lemaster takes his blood pressure. It takes two EMTs and a driver to man an ambulance properly. 72 Sludenl I ife Finally on October 6, 1978, the first University owned ambulance, Rescue 2, rolled out of the fire station with its first call. Since then they have had more than 350 calls ranging from heart attacks to stomach cramps. However, a large portion of their calls arise from sports-related in- juries due to Intramurals. Depending on the sport and the tempers, these injuries are anything from sprained ankles to a broken jaw. When a call does come into the station, the dispatcher calls for the EMTs on duty who have three minutes to be ready to go and on the ambulance. Once on the scene, the senior EMT decides whether or not to transport the patient to Redfern Health Center. If the injury is serious enough the patient may be transported to a local hos- pital should the patient express no particu- lar preference of locations. However, the patient does have the right to pick which hospital he or she is to be treated in as long as it is within a reasonable driving dis- tance. After unloading a patient, the EMTs return to the station where they must clean and prepare Rescue 2 for the next call. To become an EMT, a student must enroll in a class which takes over 100 hours to complete. This puts a big work- load on a student but for medical related majors it is a worth-while course and looks good on the record. If a student becomes certified and stays at Clemson at least 2 semesters, then the student government will refund the cost of the course. Prob- ably the most important bonus is the chance to get working experience in deal- ing with emergencies big and small. Stu- dents who do volunteer are protected by the Good Samaritan Law, which protects EMTs from lawsuits if the ambulance ser- vice is done for free. Even though the EMT is covered legally, there is little room for mistakes, and this allows a student to see how he or she reacts under pressure before they are thrown out into the real world. Every ambulance service has its draw- backs, and Clemson EMS is no exception. When the service was in its initial stages, it was proposed that Rescue 2 would run backup to Pickens County EMS in the city of Clemson. Pickens County officials said that this would take away from revenue as each run on Pickens County EMS cost a minimum of twenty dollars plus other ad- ded expenses. Thus, Clemson EMS is re- stricted to the campus. Where does this leave students in the downtown or off campus area? Well, all students not on university property must call Pickens County EMS and pay for their ambulance service. So if you are in a fight downtown or get run over by a bicy- cle, drag your body across the street to Mell Hall and yell for help, no charge. by Mike Murray While on duty.

This multifaceted group of workers, most of them students themselves, provide the bulk oi the campus entertainment with a truly dazzling variety. The Union is organized quite simply. Eleven student-run committee, each with a delegated authority over some form of re- creation, are coordinated by an excellent staff and Union Board. The cross-section of leisure activities or- ganized by these committees is staggering. Films, outdoor rec, educational opportuni- ties, blatant cheap drunks, cultural activi- ties, trips, tournaments ... all are offered by the Union folk.

Moved from the up- stairs lobby area to the buildings sub-base- ment the following year, with a major fire safety renovation in 1976-77, the Gutter now provides an intimate performing at- mosphere for acts of every kind. Larger campus musical offerings came under the umbrella of the Union organiza- tion in April 1977 when the budget-trou- bled Central Dance Association became the Central Dance and Concert Commit- tee. CDCC successfully organized its first concert without the assistance of an out- side promoter when they presented the Dixie Dregs, Mother's Finest, and fiddler Vassar Clements on Friday, September 26 in Littlejohn Coliseum. Other productions of the year included John Hammond at a beer garden and later a Beach Music Fes- tival, both at East Bank and blues singer Lonnie Brooks at the Clemson House Ball- room, all in the fall semester.

The Outdoor Rec. staff generally concern themselves with the more woods-y type activities such as tubing and Whitewater rafting on the Chatooga River, backpacking trips and fall color and snow photography trips into the mountains of North Carolina. And if long journeys appeal to the stu- dent, the Travel Committee organizes such jaunts as visits to the historic Bilt- more House in Asheville, and their annual Spring Cruise venture in the Bahamas dur- ing the spring break. They also offer travel reservation assis- tance and planning through their travel center, open each weekday afternoon in the Union offices on the loggia.

Games and Rec sponsors tournaments in Eight Ball, Foozball, and table tennis, as well as Backgammon tournaments in Ed- gar's, the Student Union nightclub. These tournaments are part of the Asso- ciation of College Unions' play-offs, and campus winners go on to represent Clem- son at regional, and possibly even the na- tionals which were held in Johnson City, Tennessee this spring. Not for competition, but simply for fun. Games and Rec co-sponsor \"Playfair\" during Welcome Week with the special events Committee. Playfair is a group of individuals who travel about the country, organizing afternoons of just plain fun. They teach a crowd of gathered students a whole series of \"new wave\" games, things which allow students to meet a lot of new people by interacting with them. The loggia has played host to many cur- ious activities the last two years as the Playfair organizers exuberance rubs off on the initially timid crowd. Special Events can be credited with many of the purely fun activities. Christ- mas and Valentine card making sessions in The ever popular Cincinnati Candlework's fourth trip to Clemson came just before Christmas vacation and provided many students with attractive gift pur- chases. The Outdoor Rec and Coffeehouse Committees jointly produced the nippy November 21 outdoor square dance in front of the loggia. The Welcome Week dance on the Union plaza was kept jumping as Windjammer played tunes all even- ing for the exuberant crowd of dances. President Bill Atchley (and his white shoes) were present on August 27 to help dedicate the new Alum- ni Video Theatre in the loggia. i.l. mi Stephens 7S-Studcnl I ilc Student Life-79 \\ YOUR Student Union the loggia as well as Halloween pumpkin carving and costume competitions are all the results of Special Events. The Short Course Committee's function is pretty much self-explanatory. They offer short courses in topics that interest stu- dents but which might be otherwise diffi- cult to find instruction for. Such diverse topics as hang-gliding, sign language, hammock-making, backgammon, and car- dio-pulmonary resuscitation are offered by Union instructors, usually at the most nominal costs. Such survival-oriented subjects as bicy- cle repair, how to buy a stereo, and first aid give students insights into subjects and activities that they can apply in their daily survival on campus. And for those who fancy themselves some manner of \"whiz kid\", the College Bowl tournament offers a chance for a vigorous mental work-out. Equal dexterity on the buzzer button and on factual recall are necessary to play this fast-paced game. As with the game tournaments, the cam- pus College Bowl winners are sent to re- present \"Moo U.\" in the regional and na- tional tournaments. In another more serious vein, the Cul- tural Committee offered their second sea- son of the Performing Artists Series in Daniel Hall auditorium. Five presenta- tions throughout the year brought live the- atre, mime, dance, and popular music to the Clemson campus with the assistance of such culturally-oriented agencies as the National Endowment for the Arts, and the South Carolina Arts Commission. But for those who prefer lighter enter- tainment, the Films and Video Committee present a number o( movies and video- tapes throughout the year. Not to be con- fused with the YMCA Theatre, the Union committee is responsible for special film showings such as the midnight movies in Tillman Hall and the amphitheatre, as well as those \"flicks\" shown down in Ed- gar's. The double showing of the classic Led Zeppelin tour tour film, \"The Song Re- mains the Same\" there on Thursday, Jan- uary 22 drew a huge crowd, especially in The Union information desk on the loggia serves as a clearinghouse for campus activities info, as well as a distribution point for the Tiger. the wake of the December disbanding of the band after drummer John Bonham died in September. The Films and Video Committee is also responsible for the Sunday Free Flicks shown in the Y Theatre, and the excellent choices of filmfare this past year made for packed houses as such classics as \"The Andromeda Strain\", 101 Dalmations\" and \"The Summer of '42\" drew capacity crowds on a regular basis. The Alumni Video Theatre in the log- gia, constructed over the summer by Union craftsman Bob Sanderson, replaced older television set-style video screens and makes watching the wide variety of video- tapes offered even more enjoyable. Ever- ything from Billy Joel concerts, to NFL Football Follies, to the Halloween show- ings of the classic horror film \"Night of the Living Dead\" were offered to anyone who was willing to stop off on the loggia and take them in. Though not a committee operation, the Union night club, named for Edgar Allen Brown, long a Clemson Trustee, has be- come a center of the campus social life since it opened in 1 976. Offering good mu- sic, cheap draft beer, imported beers, and cruddy Almaden wines, Edgar's is a major gathering point for students. As the most immediately available nightspot, it draws in those who may not feel like trekking all the way downtown. And responsible for keeping the campus posted on all these myriad Union activi- ties, is the often-overlooked Artwork Committee whose duty it is to come up with all the promotional posters and ad- vertising material that the Union displays all across the Clemson campus. Many gift- ed and imaginative artists labor with little recognition for their efforts to tell the world what's happening. So, the next time you hear someone on campus suggest that \"this is gonna be a dead weekend,\" suggest to him or her that they check with the Union, because there is ALWAYS something happening some- where with YOUR student union. bv Mark Sublette Pam Routh. president of the Univcrsit\\ I num. scries c.ikc to students attending the I nion's tenth birthday p.irn in the loggia in Januar) Seneca .irttst Janet Wagner's delicate protraits were u hit with students when she set up in the I nion gallery lor a v.eek in late January Andv Smith Student Lifc-81 Pan Maddox Jane Lybrand Speakers coming to Clemson have a lor to say and to communicate to the students. However, communications is more than just words as Jane Lybrand, the Speakers Bureau's first guest, pointed out. Lybrand discussed nonverbal communication and its role in today's technical society. Ac- cording to Lybrand, society has become so sophisticated that it is influenced more by actions than by speech. The use of space, clothing, the job interview, intermediation, and measure of sincerity were just a few topics that were discussed. The use of space that was mentioned dealt with how close a person will come to another person. Four basic areas: intimate, personal, close associate, and forefaced, were those discussed. Clothing was com- pared to a \"second skin\" which tells others . . . \"Touching is one of the most important things in our culture. \" about the type of person one is. Clothing is an important aspect of the job interview, where one should dress for the type of job one wants. Also mentioned were the gestures of in- timidation, such as tapping someone on the chest to emphasize a point or making karate type gestures when talking as well as looking at someone directly in the eye. Sincerity, or lack of it, according to Ly- brand, could be detected in nineteen dif- ferent ways. Of the most important were open eyes when a person talks, a relaxed forehead, and making gestures in front of the body. Lybrand concluded that in today's po- litical arena, image is more important than political platforms. This image inventory includes taking a look at the total candi- date who shares their personal strengths and weaknesses. by Lisa Goforth Pam Maddox 82-StudcnI I ik- Bill Foster \"There are only two kinds of coaches; those fired and those waiting to be,\" says Bill Foster head coach of the Clemson Ti- gers basketball team. Foster was the Speakers Bureau's second guest speaker of the fall semester. He stressed the fact that the Tigers are going to make mistakes ear- ly in the season due to the fact that he lost last year's guards to graduation. \"We're going to have to start some freshmen who are low on experience, but high on enthusi- asm. We should be fairly strong every- where else.\" Foster also spoke on some ideas that he tries to instill into his players. The three words he used were, \"Success, Attitude, ... \"1 think the other Bill Foster is a great person and coach. It 'sjust a shame that he's now at U.S.C.\" and Team\". Foster stressed that if his players would keep these things in mind, it would be all that he would ask of them. He said that winning wasn't what was impor- tant, but rather giving 1 00% of yourself at all times. \"Success is a journey, not a des- tination,\" was the main point Foster tried to put across. In conclusion, Foster told the audience how he stressed the importance of a good education to his team. Foster said that he feels a player cannot perform at his best if he is worrying whether he will ever gra- duate. He said that he told his club the importance of an education and reminded them that they all would not play pro ball and would need an education upon gradu- ating. by Kim Ambrose Raymond Teaster Raymond Teaster Student Life-83 Vincent Bugliosi A full house listened to the discussion of the unusual and bizarre Charles Manson case, as told by the chief prossecuter, Vin- cent Bugliosi. He is the author of two best selling novels, one of which, \"Helter Skel- ter\", had a television movie based on it. Manson had a magnetic appeal for peo- ple who were dissatisfied with society. He used tools of sexual perversion, drugs and continuous preaching to keep his follow- ers. Manson convinced his family it was all right to kill human beings, although he himself would not harm flowers or ani- mals. The continual preaching of his be- liefs was the only thing the \"family\" was exposed to since they were living in an abandoned movie setting in the desert. He never gave his followers the \"kill or be killed\" ultimatum, and contrary to public belief, some of the family would not kill. \"Not only were the murders un- usual, but the trial may also have been the most atypical in American history. \" Bugliosi gave numerous reasons as to why this was an atypical case. Usually mass murders involve people of below average intelligence with the leader also participating until Manson. Manson never killed anyone himself, and most of his fol- lowers, young girls in their late teens and early twenties, were of average intelli- gence. The ability to control the minds of his followers was most unusual, explained the California attorney. Manson convinced his family to rebel against the middle and upper class society so as to create racial tensions that would result in a war between blacks and whites that he called \"Helter Skelter\". The murders themselves were unusual and so was the trial. It lasted more than nine months, cost Californians $962,000, and was the longest murder trial in history. by Penny Lee X4 Student I ik- Wilson Bryan Key Are Americans being unknowingly se- duced by everyday advertisements? Dr. Wilson Bryan Key thinks so. As one of the Speaker's guest lecturers. Dr. Key ad- dressed a topic which is unknown to many Americans: the art of subliminal advertis- ing. Key played to a full house in Brackett Auditorium as he expounded on the rea- soning for and the techniques involved in subliminal sex in advertising. It is estimat- ed that during last year alone, sex was the factor that sold 50 million dollars worth of advertising in newspapers, magazines, and billboards across the country. During his presentation, Key explained that the title of his third book, \"Clam Plate Orgy\", was influenced by a Howard Johnson placemat. Hidden among the clams were pictures of eight men and \"No one can answer the ques- tions as to how or why subliminal stimuli work. \" women and a donkey engaging in sexual acts. Even the parsley had the word \"sex\" air-brushed into it. None of these advertisements contained actual photographs, as drawings are better than the real thing, according to Key. Some subliminal ads cost as much as three million dollars to produce. And in an actu- al liquor advertisement, the altering of a single ice cube in a glass took anywhere from one hundred to three hundred man- hours to accomplish. Subtle hints, such as the bottom line in ad copy, are things that most untrained people fail to conciously see, noted Key. He emphasized that, with training and ex- pe"
