The authors used models to inform and guide rather than provide a definitive set of predictors which is a welcome approach to such analysis.\n\nThe methods are laid out well and clear for the most part, although the only minor comments are:\n\nLine 200: a reference to the minimum distance between each grid could be made clearer – which grids are being referred to, either the Index grid or Random grid? I assume the Random grids, but it would be worth being explicit for the reader.\n\nLines 201 – 204: It would be worth stating how long the ibuttons ran for. The whole of the sampling period or just one/two/more days? Likewise, it isn’t clear whether the ibuttons were deployed in the Index or Random grids, or indeed, both.\n\nReviewer #2: Line 173: The phrase that starts with \"September being\" is not a complete sentence.\n\nLine 184: Culicidae mosquito is redundant.\n\nLines 190, 191, 192 and thereafter: density, not dense\n\nLine 234: mosquitoes (plural)\n\nWere data tested for normality prior to ANOVA?\n\nWere the indices used in these calculations invented by the authors or were they derived from literature?\n\nI like that the authors measured temperatures for both air and water inside container habitats. This is an often-overlooked criterion.\n\nFor all statistical tests that are used, please include a short statement about reporting of results, for example, for ANOVA, \"Results are reported as arithmetic mean +/- standard error.\" This gives the reader an idea of what to expect.\n\n--------------------\n\nResults\n\n-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?\n\n-Are the results clearly and completely presented?\n\n-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?\n\nReviewer #1: The authors analysed the data completely as planned, and present a clear set of results.\n\nThere is a well presented data overview, covering core data before moving onto more complex analysis; each statistical analysis was correctly presented.\n\nWith the mixed model analysis, the authors kept to the key drivers/main models whilst presenting their results - I fully approve of this approach, as there is a tendancy to over-describe results from mixed models which can muddy the waters somewhat. Because of this approach, the results, particularly for the mixed effect models was clear and easy to follow.\n\nFigures are of good quality and used to emphasise main findings. As such, the figures complement the writing and help enhance the narrative.\n\nReviewer #2: Lines 371-373: Were these species mentioned in full prior to this paragraph? I must have missed that.\n\nI see chi-square values reported but I didn't find them mentioned in the methods section. Same with beta values and Chao1 values.\n\nLine 523: This is not a complete sentence. What am I supposed to understand from a half of a thought?\n\nLines 387-388: the authors mention no seasonal difference between BPR and they refer to Figure 3, but figure 3 doesn't give any information about seasonality of BPR.\n\nLine 394: reference for WHO thresholds?\n\n--------------------\n\nConclusions\n\n-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?\n\n-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?\n\n-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?\n\n-Is public health relevance addressed?\n\nReviewer #1: The study has clear relevance for informing disease control from mosquito vectors. I completely concur with the conclusions drawn from the data.\n\nThe influence of the environment on mosquito breeding success, particularly those species linked with Dengue transmission, is clearly an important step in helping to control disease outbreaks. The study covered microhabitat and macrohabitat drivers and found that microhabitat, notably container presence (as well as season) helped determine mosquito presence and larval prevalence. This prevalence increased in urbanised areas, whilst species diversity decreased in urbanised areas leaving Aedes species as dominant species, clearly linked to dengue transmission.\n\nThe authors correctly state that \"transmission reduction programmes should focus on ‘neighbourhood surveillance’\" and within this context, reduction or removal of containers in urbanised areas would be a principal mechanism of reducing Aedes-borne diseases. The authors recognise that the link between dengue outbreaks and mosquito population dynamics is not clear, therefore further fine-scale data is required.\n\nI can safely say that the relevance to public health is very clearly addressed.\n\nReviewer #2: I believe that the authors have drawn reasonable conclusions based on their work.\n\n--------------------\n\nEditorial and Data Presentation Modifications?\n\nUse this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend “Minor Revision” or “Accept”.\n\nReviewer #1: As outlined above:\n\nLine 200: a reference to the minimum distance between each grid could be made clearer – which grids are being referred to, either the Index grid or Random grid? I assume the Random grids, but it would be worth being explicit for the reader.\n\nLines 201 – 204: It would be worth stating how long the ibuttons ran for. The whole of the sampling period or just one/two/more days? Likewise, it isn’t clear whether the ibuttons were deployed in the Index or Random grids, or indeed, both.\n\nReviewer #2: Some of the figures are a little hard to see - detail is lost at the small scale. I wonder what the figures will look like in print. I hope that they are readable.\n\n--------------------\n\nSummary and General Comments\n\nUse this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.\n\nReviewer #1: I felt that this study was really well conducted, thought-out and analysed to a high standard. The relevance to public health is clear and with all studies obvioulsy drives a number of additional questions. The simplicity of the conclusions is fantastic - something that can be implemented at ground-level. It will be interesting to see how that message is communicated from the scientific literature to the relevant neighborhoods; I fear that communicating the message will be a harder task than the study.\n\nReviewer #2: In the abstract, Line 78, Aedes albopictus =Stegomyia albopicta. Aedes and albopictus are masculine but Stegomyia is feminine and so the ending must agree, ergo albopicta.\n\n--------------------\n\nPLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (what does this mean?).
