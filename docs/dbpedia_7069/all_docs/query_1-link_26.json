The quantum state of a particle is defined by a set of numbers that describe quantities such as energy, angular momentum and spin. Fermions are particles such as quarks, protons, neutrons and electrons, that have spin = Â½ (in units of h/2Ï, where h is ...\n\nPauli Principle and Pion Scattering\n\nDOE R&D Accomplishments Database\n\nBethe, H. A.\n\n1972-10-01\n\nIt is pointed out that if the Pauli principle is taken into account in the discussion of pion scattering by complex nuclei (as it ought, of course, to be) some rather implausible consequences of some earlier treatments of this problem can be avoided. (auth)\n\nRestoring the Pauli principle in the random phase approximation ground state\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKosov, D. S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nRandom phase approximation ground state contains electronic configurations where two (and more) identical electrons can occupy the same molecular spin-orbital violating the Pauli exclusion principle. This overcounting of electronic configurations happens due to quasiboson approximation in the treatment of electron-hole pair operators. We describe the method to restore the Pauli principle in the RPA wavefunction. The proposed theory is illustrated by the calculations of molecular dipole moments and electronic kinetic energies. The Hartree-Fock based RPA, which is corrected for the Pauli principle, gives the results of comparable accuracy with MÃ¸ller-Plesset second order perturbation theory and coupled-cluster singles and doubles method.\n\nIs the Pauli exclusion principle the origin of electron localisation?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRincÃ³n, Luis; Torres, F. Javier; Almeida, Rafael\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this work, we inquire into the origins of the electron localisation as obtained from the information content of the same-spin pair density, Î³Ï, Ï(r2â£r1). To this end, we consider systems of non-interacting and interacting identical Fermions contained in two simple 1D potential models: (1) an infinite potential well and (2) the Kronig-Penney periodic potential. The interparticle interaction is considered through the Hartree-Fock approximation as well as the configuration interaction expansion. Morover, the electron localisation is described through the Kullback-Leibler divergence between Î³Ï, Ï(r2â£r1) and its associated marginal probability. The results show that, as long as the adopted method properly includes the Pauli principle, the electronic localisation depends only modestly on the interparticle interaction. In view of the latter, one may conclude that the Pauli principle is the main responsible for the electron localisation.\n\nSqueezed States, Uncertainty Relations and the Pauli Principle in Composite and Cosmological Models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTerazawa, Hidezumi\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe importance of not only uncertainty relations but also the Pauli exclusion principle is emphasized in discussing various 'squeezed states' existing in the universe.

Since then, several experiments have checked its validity. From 2006 until 2010, the VIP (Violation of the Pauli Principle) experiment took data at the LNGS underground laboratory to test the PEP. This experiment looked for electronic 2p to Is transitions in copper, where 2 electrons are in the Is state before the transition happens. These transitions violate the PEP. The lack of detection of X-ray photons coming from these transitions resulted in a preliminary upper limit for the violation of the PEP of 4.7 Ã 10-29. Currently, the successor experiment VIP2 is under preparation. The main improvements are, on one side, the use of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) as X-ray photon detectors. On the other side an active shielding is implemented, which consists of plastic scintillator bars read by Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The employment of these detectors will improve the upper limit for the violation of the PEP by around 2 orders of magnitude.\n\nThe Explanation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVasiliev, Victor; Moon, Russell\n\n2006-11-01\n\nUsing the principles of the Vortex Theory, the construction of the alpha particle, and the theory that the nucleus is constructed out of alpha particles, the explanation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle is explained. If protons and electrons are connected to each other via fourth dimensional vortices, they spin in opposite directions. Since the alpha particle possesses two protons possessing opposite spins, their electrons also possess opposite spins. With a nucleus constructed out of alpha particles, all paired electrons in shells and sub-shells will spin in opposite directions. 1. Victor Vasiliev, Russell Moon.

O.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn the framework of the energy density method with the use of the wave function of the two-center shell model, the influence of the simultaneous account for the Pauli exclusion principle and the monopole and quadrupole polarizations of nuclei on the nuclear part of the potential of their interaction by the example of the 40Ca +40Ca system is considered. The calculations performed in the framework of the adiabatic approximation show that the consideration of the Pauli exclusion principle and the polarization of nuclei, especially the quadrupole one, essentially affects the nucleus-nucleus interaction potential.\n\nThe Strange Friendship of Pauli and Jung - When Physics Met Psychology\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMiller, Arthur I.\n\nAt a key time in his scientific development, Pauli was undergoing analysis by Jung.

The paper detailed what we now know as his \"exclusion principle.\" This essay situates the work leading up to Pauli's principle within the traditions of the \"Sommerfeld School,\" led by Munich University's renowned theorist and teacher, Arnold Sommerfeld (1868-1951). Offering a substantial corrective to previous accounts of the birth of quantum mechanics, which have tended to sideline Sommerfeld's work, it is suggested here that both the method and the content of Pauli's paper drew substantially on the work of the Sommerfeld School in the early 1920s. Part One describes Sommerfeld's turn away from a faith in the power of model-based (modellmÃ¤ssig) methods in his early career towards the use of a more phenomenological emphasis on empirical regularities (GesetzmÃ¤ssigkeiten) during precisely the period that both Pauli and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), among others, were his students. Part two delineates the importance of Sommerfeld's phenomenology to Pauli's methods in the exclusion principle paper, a paper that also eschewed modellmÃ¤ssig approaches in favour of a stress on GesetzmÃ¤ssigkeiten. In terms of content, a focus on Sommerfeld's work reveals the roots of Pauli's understanding of the fundamental Zweideutigkeit (ambiguity) involving the quantum number of electrons within the atom. The conclusion points to the significance of these results to an improved historical understanding of the origin of aspects of Heisenberg's 1925 paper on the \"Quantum-theoretical Reformulation (Umdeutung) of Kinematical and Mechanical Relations.\"\n\nWhat Feynman Could Not yet Use: The Generalised Hong-Ou-Mandel Experiment to Improve the QED Explanation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMalgieri, Massimiliano; Tenni, Antonio; Onorato, Pasquale; De Ambrosis, Anna\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIn this paper we present a reasoning line for introducing the Pauli exclusion principle in the context of an introductory course on quantum theory based on the sum over paths approach. We start from the argument originally introduced by Feynman in \"QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter\" and improve it by discussing with studentsâ¦\n\nBeyond synchronicity: the worldview of Carl Gustav Jung and Wolfgang Pauli.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonati, Marialuisa\n\n2004-11-01\n\nWhile exploring the phenomena of synchronicity, Carl Gustav Jung became acquainted with the quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli and eventually began a collaboration with him. During that collaboration Jung's study of synchronistic phenomena underwent a considerable change; prior to the collaboration, Jung had stressed mainly the phenomenological and empirical features of synchronistic phenomena, while in association with Pauli, he focused his attention upon their ontological, archetypal character. Pauli, on the other hand, became increasingly sensitive to the philosophical aspects concerning the unconscious. Jung and Pauli's common reflections went far beyond psychology and physics, entering into the realm where the two areas meet in the philosophy of nature. In fact, as a consequence of their collaboration, synchronicity was transformed from an empirical concept into a fundamental explanatory-interpretative principle, which together with causality could possibly lead to a more complete worldview. Exploring the problematic character of the synchronicity concept has a heuristic value because it leads to the reconsideration of the philosophical issues that drove Jung and Pauli to clear up the conceptual background of their thoughts. Within the philosophical worldview arising from Jung and Pauli's discussions about synchronicity, there are many symbolic aspects that go against mainstream science and that represent a sort of criticism to some of the commonly held views of present day science.\n\nWolfgang Pauli\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEnz, Charles P.\n\n2000-11-01\n\nWolfgang Pauli gehÃ¶rt zu den bedeutendsten Physikern des 20.

By examining the cognitive features of the correspondence principle and comparing it with those of Pauli's exclusion principle, I will show that it did more than simply 'save the phenomena'. The correspondence principle in fact rested on powerful analogies and mental schemas. Pauli's rejection of model-based methods in favor of a phenomenological, rule-based approach was therefore not as disruptive as some historians have indicated. Even at a stage that seems purely phenomenological, historical studies of theoretical development should take into account non-formal, model-based approaches in the form of mental schemas, analogies and images. In fact, Bohr's images and analogies had non-classical components which were able to evoke the idea of exclusion as a prohibition law and as a preliminary mental schema.

I.; Entin-Wohlman, O.; Jonson, M.; Aharony, A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA simple model for the transmission of pairs of electrons through a weak electric link in the form of a nanowire made of a material with strong electron spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is presented, with emphasis on the effects of Coulomb interactions and the Pauli exclusion principle. The constraints due to the Pauli principle are shown to \"quench\" the coherent SOI-induced precession of the spins when the spatial wave packets of the two electrons overlap significantly. The quenching, which results from the projection of the pair's spin states onto spin-up and spin-down states on the link, breaks up the coherent propagation in the link into a sequence of coherent hops that add incoherently. Applying the model to the transmission of Cooper pairs between two superconductors, we find that in spite of Pauli quenching, the Josephson current oscillates with the strength of the SOI, but may even change its sign (compared to the limit of the Coulomb blockade, when the quenching is absent). Conditions for an experimental detection of these features are discussed.\n\nCosmic space and Pauli exclusion principle in a system of M0-branes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCapozziello, Salvatore; Saridakis, Emmanuel N.; Bamba, Kazuharu; Sepehri, Alireza; Rahaman, Farook; Ali, Ahmed Farag; Pincak, Richard; Pradhan, Anirudh\n\nAn emergence of cosmic space has been suggested by Padmanabhan [Emergence and expansion of cosmic space as due to the quest for holographic equipartition, arXiv:hep-th/1206.4916] where he proposed that the expansion of the universe originates from a difference between the number of degrees of freedom on a holographic surface and the one in the emerged bulk. Now, a natural question that arises is how this proposal would explain the production of fermions and an emergence of the Pauli exclusion principle during the evolution of the universe? We try to address this issue in a system of M0-branes. In this model, there is a high symmetry and the system is composed of M0-branes to which only scalar fields are attached that represent scalar modes of the graviton. Then, when M0-branes join each other and hence form M1-branes, this symmetry is broken and gauge fields are formed. Therefore, these M1-branes interact with the anti-M1-branes and the force between them leads to a break of a symmetry such as the lower and upper parts of these branes are not the same. In these conditions, gauge fields which are localized on M1-branes and scalars which are attached to them symmetrically, decay to fermions with upper and lower spins which attach to the upper and lower parts of the M1-branes anti-symmetrically. The curvature produced by the coupling of identical spins has the opposite sign of the curvature produced by non-identical spins which lead to an attractive force between anti-parallel spins and a repelling force between parallel spins and hence an emergence of the Pauli exclusion principle. By approaching M1-branes to each other, the difference between curvatures of parallel spins and curvatures of anti-parallel spins increases, which leads to an inequality between the number of degrees of freedom on the surface and the one in the emerged bulk and hence lead to an occurrence of the cosmic expansion. By approaching M1-branes to each other, the square of the energy of the\n\nGeneralized Pauli constraints in small atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchilling, Christian; Altunbulak, Murat; Knecht, Stefan; Lopes, Alexandre; Whitfield, James D.; Christandl, Matthias; Gross, David; Reiher, Markus\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe natural occupation numbers of fermionic systems are subject to nontrivial constraints, which include and extend the original Pauli principle. A recent mathematical breakthrough has clarified their mathematical structure and has opened up the possibility of a systematic analysis. Early investigations have found evidence that these constraints are exactly saturated in several physically relevant systems, e.g., in a certain electronic state of the beryllium atom. It has been suggested that, in such cases, the constraints, rather than the details of the Hamiltonian, dictate the system's qualitative behavior. Here, we revisit this question with state-of-the-art numerical methods for small atoms. We find that the constraints are, in fact, not exactly saturated, but that they lie much closer to the surface defined by the constraints than the geometry of the problem would suggest. While the results seem incompatible with the statement that the generalized Pauli constraints drive the behavior of these systems, they suggest that the qualitatively correct wave-function expansions can in some systems already be obtained on the basis of a limited number of Slater determinants, which is in line with numerical evidence from quantum chemistry.\n\nGiant Faraday effect due to Pauli exclusion principle in 3D topological insulators.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaudel, Hari P; Leuenberger, Michael N\n\n2014-02-26\n\nExperiments using ARPES, which is based on the photoelectric effect, show that the surface states in 3D topological insulators (TI) are helical. Here we consider Weyl interface fermions due to band inversion in narrow-bandgap semiconductors, such as Pb1-xSnxTe. The positive and negative energy solutions can be identified by means of opposite helicity in terms of the spin helicity operator in 3D TI as Ä¥(TI) = (1/ |p|_ |) Î² (Ï|_ x p|_ ) Â· z^, where Î² is a Dirac matrix and z^ points perpendicular to the interface. Using the 3D Dirac equation and bandstructure calculations we show that the transitions between positive and negative energy solutions, giving rise to electron-hole pairs, obey strict optical selection rules. In order to demonstrate the consequences of these selection rules, we consider the Faraday effect due to the Pauli exclusion principle in a pump-probe setup using a 3D TI double interface of a PbTe/Pbâ.ââSnâ.ââTe/PbTe heterostructure. For that we calculate the optical conductivity tensor of this heterostructure, which we use to solve Maxwell's equations. The Faraday rotation angle exhibits oscillations as a function of probe wavelength and thickness of the heterostructure. The maxima in the Faraday rotation angle are of the order of mrds.\n\nPauli structures arising from confined particles interacting via a statistical potential\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBatle, Josep; Ciftja, Orion; Farouk, Ahmed; Alkhambashi, Majid; Abdalla, Soliman\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThere have been suggestions that the Pauli exclusion principle alone can lead a non-interacting (free) system of identical fermions to form crystalline structures dubbed Pauli crystals. Single-shot imaging experiments for the case of ultra-cold systems of free spin-polarized fermionic atoms in a two-dimensional harmonic trap appear to show geometric arrangements that cannot be characterized as Wigner crystals. This work explores this idea and considers a well-known approach that enables one to treat a quantum system of free fermions as a system of classical particles interacting with a statistical interaction potential. The model under consideration, though classical in nature, incorporates the quantum statistics by endowing the classical particles with an effective interaction potential. The reasonable expectation is that possible Pauli crystal features seen in experiments may manifest in this model that captures the correct quantum statistics as a first order correction. We use the Monte Carlo simulated annealing method to obtain the most stable configurations of finite two-dimensional systems of confined particles that interact with an appropriate statistical repulsion potential. We consider both an isotropic harmonic and a hard-wall confinement potential. Despite minor differences, the most stable configurations observed in our model correspond to the reported Pauli crystals in single-shot imaging experiments of free spin-polarized fermions in a harmonic trap. The crystalline configurations observed appear to be different from the expected classical Wigner crystal structures that would emerge should the confined classical particles had interacted with a pair-wise Coulomb repulsion.\n\nNew Limits on Bosonic Dark Matter, Solar Axions, Pauli Exclusion Principle Violation, and Electron Decay from the Majorana Demonstrator\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nAbgrall, N.; Arnquist, I.

Due to many observations This rule must be valid to an extremely high degree and consequently no violations were found so far. On the other hand a simple explanation of PEP is still missing. Many experimental investigations based on different assumptions were performed to search for a tiny PEP violation in various systems. The experiment VIP2 at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS of INFN) is designed to test the PEP for electrons with high sensitivity by searching for forbidden X-ray transitions in copper atoms. This experiment aims to improve the PEP violation limit obtained with our preceding experiment VIP by orders of magnitude. The experimental method, comparison of the VIP result with different PEP searches and the present status of the VIP2 experiment will be presented.

This seems to imply that any reasonable definition of time operator must be conjugate to the Hamiltonian. Then both time and energy must have the same spectrum since conjugate operators are unitarily equivalent. Clearly this is not always true: normal Hamiltonians have lower bounded spectrum and often only have discrete eigenvalues, whereas we typically desire that time can take any real value. Pauli concluded that constructing a general a time operator is impossible (although clearly it can be done in specific cases). Here we show how the Pauli argument fails when one uses an external system (a \"clock\") to track time, so that time arises as correlations between the system and the clock (conditional probability amplitudes framework). In this case, the time operator is conjugate to the clock Hamiltonian and not to the system Hamiltonian, but its eigenvalues still satisfy the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for arbitrary system Hamiltonians.\n\nThe cultural significance of synchronicity for Jung and Pauli.\n\nPubMed\n\nMain, Roderick\n\n2014-04-01\n\nThis paper considers the cultural significance of C.G. Jung's concept of synchronicity, as this was envisaged both by Jung himself and by the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, Jung's most important discussant in developing the concept. For both thinkers the principle of synchronicity was, above all, an attempt to develop an expanded, more holistic understanding of science. The paper argues, however, that their motives for proposing this development were not just, as might be expected, scientific, philosophical, and psychological (including personal), but also historical, social, political, and religious, and involved consideration of esoteric as well as mainstream currents of thought.

Pauli spent 30 years as a professor at the Federal Institute of Technology ETH in Zurich, which occupy a central place in this biography. It would be incomplete, however, without a rendering of Pauli's sarcastic wit and, most importantly, of the world of his dreams. It is through the latter that quite a different aspect of Pauli's life comes in, namely his association with the psychology of C.G. Jung and his school.\n\nVariations on a theme of Heisenberg, Pauli and Weyl\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKibler, Maurice R.\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe parentage between Weyl pairs, the generalized Pauli group and the unitary group is investigated in detail. We start from an abstract definition of the Heisenberg-Weyl group on the field {\\\\bb R} and then switch to the discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group or generalized Pauli group on a finite ring {\\\\bb Z}_d . The main characteristics of the latter group, an abstract group of order d3 noted Pd, are given (conjugacy classes and irreducible representation classes or equivalently Lie algebra of dimension d3 associated with Pd). Leaving the abstract sector, a set of Weyl pairs in dimension d is derived from a polar decomposition of SU(2) closely connected to angular momentum theory. Then, a realization of the generalized Pauli group Pd and the construction of generalized Pauli matrices in dimension d are revisited in terms of Weyl pairs. Finally, the Lie algebra of the unitary group U(d) is obtained as a subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with Pd. This leads to a development of the Lie algebra of U(d) in a basis consisting of d2 generalized Pauli matrices. In the case where d is a power of a prime integer, the Lie algebra of SU(d) can be decomposed into d - 1 Cartan subalgebras.

E.; Dodin, I. Y.\n\n2015-06-10\n\nHere, classical variational principles can be deduced from quantum variational principles via formal reparameterization of the latter. It is shown that such reparameterization is possible without invoking any assumptions other than classicality and without appealing to dynamical equations. As examples, first principle variational formulations of classical point-particle and cold-fluid motion are derived from their quantum counterparts for Schrodinger, Pauli, and Klein-Gordon particles.\n\nSynchronicity and the I Ching: Jung, Pauli, and the Chinese woman.\n\nPubMed\n\nZabriskie, Beverley\n\n2005-04-01\n\nThe capacity of the human mind to discover and invent both imagistic analogies and mathematical structures to represent reality is strikingly juxtaposed in the ancient Chinese text of the I Ching. Its emphasis on containing all sorts of opposites and its plastic appeal to multi-valenced experience has kept it alive through millennia and across cultures. Jung was introduced to its Taoist wisdom by the Sinologist Richard Wilhelm. The Nobel Laureate quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli became familiar with its philosophy and mathematics through his reading of Schopenhauer and Leibniz. In their correspondence about the nature of the unconscious and synchronicity, Pauli and Jung also exchanged their musings on Pauli's dreams of a Chinese woman, her role in his psyche and his scientific theories(1).\n\nFrom Copenhagen to the consulting room: Pauli and Jung in Copenhagen.\n\nPubMed\n\nGieser, Suzanne\n\n2014-04-01\n\nIn this paper the city of Copenhagen is used as a starting point to highlight some critical historical events, both concerning the exchange of ideas between the physicist Wolfgang Pauli and C.G. Jung and the history of psychotherapy in Scandinavia. Pauli's years in Copenhagen under the influence of Niels Bohr and his philosophy prepared him mentally to receiveC.G. Jung's ideas. The paper also recounts the one occasion that Jung was in Scandinavia, attending the 9th conference of the General Medical Society for Psychotherapy in Copenhagen, just before going to New York in 1937 to give his final seminars on Pauli's dreams. The reason for focusing on these particular events is that they also constitute part of the history of the reception of psychodynamic psychology in Sweden and Scandinavia.

The V matrices were proposed by Lubotsky, Philips, and Sarnak [Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 40, 401â420 (1987)] as a purely geometric construct in 1987 and recently found applications in quantum computation. They allow for exceptionally simple quantum circuit synthesis algorithms based on quaternionic factorization. We adapt the deterministic-search technique initially proposed by Ross and Selinger to synthesize approximating Pauli+V circuits of optimal depth for single-qubit axial rotations. Our synthesis procedure based on simple SL{sub 2}(â¤) geometrymoreÂ Â» is almost elementary.Â«Â less\n\nPauli energy spectrum for twist-deformed spacetime\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDaszkiewicz, Marcin\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this paper, we define the Pauli Hamiltonian function for the twist-deformed N-enlarged Newton-Hooke spacetime provided by M.

The octet and decuplet intermediate states are included in the one-loop calculation. The 4-dimensional regulator is introduced to deal with the divergence. Different from the non-relativistic case, this 4-dimensional regulator is generated from the nonlocal Lagrangian with the gauge link, which guarantees local gauge invariance. As a result, additional diagrams appear which ensure electric charge 1 and 0 for proton and neutron respectively. The obtained Dirac and Pauli form factors of the nucleons are all reasonable up to relatively large Q 2.

The aim of this paper is to establish new uncertainty principles associated with the polar wavelet transforms in L2(R2). Firstly, we study some basic properties of the polar wavelet transform and then derive the associated generalized version of Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequality. Finally, following the idea of Beckner (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 123, 1897-1905 1995), we drive the logarithmic version of uncertainty principle for the polar wavelet transforms in L2(R2).\n\nOn Pauli's Invention of Non-Abelian Kaluza-Klein Theory in 1953\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStraumann, N.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nThere are documents which show that Wolfgang Pauli developed in 1953 the first consistent generalization of the five-dimensional theory of Kaluza, Klein, Fock and others to a higher dimensional internal space. Because he saw no way to give masses to the gauge bosons, he refrained from publishing his results formally.\n\nConsistent Pauli reduction on group manifolds\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBaguet, A.; Pope, Christopher N.; Samtleben, H.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe prove an old conjecture by Duff, Nilsson, Pope and Warner asserting that the NSNS sector of supergravity (and more general the bosonic string) allows for a consistent Pauli reduction on any d-dimensional group manifold G, keeping the full set of gauge bosons of the GÃG isometry group of the bi-invariant metric on G. The main tool of the construction is a particular generalised ScherkâSchwarz reduction ansatz in double field theory which we explicitly construct in terms of the group's Killing vectors. Examples include the consistent reduction from ten dimensions on S3ÃS3 and on similar product spaces. The construction ismoreÂ Â» another example of globally geometric non-toroidal compactifications inducing non-geometric fluxes.Â«Â less\n\nQuasi-Classical Asymptotics for the Pauli Operator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSobolev, Alexander V.\n\nWe study the behaviour of the sums of the eigenvalues of the Pauli operator in , in a magnetic field and electric field V(x) as the Planck constant Ä§ tends to zero and the magnetic field strength Î¼ tends to infinity. We show that for the sum obeys the natural Weyl type formula where Ï = (d- 2)/2 + Î³, with an explicit constant CÎ³, d. If the field B has a constant direction, then this formula is uniform in Î¼>= 0. The method is based on Colin de Verdiere's approach proposed in his work on ``magnetic bottles'' (Commun.

A positive magnetoresistance in excess of 200% at a temperature of 300 mK was observed in this configuration, reverting to negative magnetoresistance with the magnetic field oriented normal to the graphene plane. We attribute the observed positive in-plane magnetoresistance to a Pauli blockade of hopping conduction induced by spin polarization. Our Rapid Communication shows that spin polarization in concert with electron-electron interaction can play a dominant role in magnetotransport within an atomic monolayer.\n\n\"It's best not to think about it at all-like the new taxes\": Reality, observer, and complementarity in Bohr and Pauli\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPlotnitsky, Arkady\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis article considers the concepts of reality, observer, and complementarity in Pauli and Bohr, and the similarities and, especially, differences in their understanding of these concepts, differences defined most essentially by their respective views of the role of the human observer in quantum measurement. These differences are significant even in the case of their respective interpretations of quantum phenomena and quantum mechanics, where the influence of Bohr's ideas on Pauli's understanding of quantum physics is particularly strong. They become especially strong and even radical in the case of their overall philosophical visions, where the impact of Jungean psychology, coupled to that of the earlier archetypal thinking of such figures as Kepler and Fludd, drives Pauli's thinking ever further away from that of Bohr.\n\nSpectral properties of Pauli operators on the PoincarÃ© upper-half plane\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nInahama, Yuzuru; Shirai, Shin-ichi\n\n2003-06-01\n\nWe investigate the essential spectrum of the Pauli operators (and the Dirac and the SchrÃ¶dinger operators) with magnetic fields on the PoincarÃ© upper-half plane. The magnetic fields under consideration are asymptotically constant (which may be equal to zero), or diverge at infinity. Moreover, the Aharonov-Casher type result is also considered.\n\nRole of the pair potential for the saturation of generalized Pauli constraints\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLegeza, Ãrs; Schilling, Christian\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe dependence of the (quasi-)saturation of the generalized Pauli constraints on the pair potential is studied for ground states of few-fermion systems. For this, we consider spinless fermions in one dimension which are harmonically confined and interact by pair potentials of the form | xi-xj|s with -1 â¤s â¤5 . We use the density matrix renormalization group approach and large orbital basis to achieve the convergence on more than ten digits of both the variational energy and the natural occupation numbers. Our results confirm that the conflict between energy minimization and fermionic exchange symmetry results in a universal and nontrivial quasisaturation of the generalized Pauli constraints (quasipinning), implying tremendous structural simplifications of the fermionic ground state for all s . Those numerically exact results are complemented by an analytical study based on a self-consistent perturbation theory which we develop for this purpose. The respective results for the weak-coupling regime eventually elucidate the singular behavior found for the specific values s =2 ,4 ,..., resulting in an extremely strong quasipinning.\n\nSynchronicity - The Link Between Physics and Psyche, from Pauli and Jung to Chopra\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTeodorani, M.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThis book, which is entirely dedicated to the mystery of \"synchronicity\", is divided into three parts: a) the joint research between analytic psychologist Carl Gustav Jung and quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli; b) synchronicity mechanisms occurring in the microscopic (canonical quantum entanglement), mesoscopic and macroscopic scales; c) research and philosophy concerning synchronicity by MD Deepak Chopra.\n\nCarl Jung's interpretation of Wolfgang Pauli's dreams: The Bailey Island, Maine, and New York City seminars of 1936 and 1937\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrown, Richard Paul\n\nThis dissertation reviewed the development of Jung's dream theory and addresses the question as to whether or not Jung was influenced by the dreams of the Nobel Prize winning physicist, Wolfgang Pauli. Jung provided an extensive analysis of Pauli's dreams, which are contained in the lightly edited, unpublished transcripts of lectures delivered in 1936 and 1937. An archival and hermeneutic analysis of the texts reveals a staged process of individuation that Jung related to in many ways because of the parallels to his own personal journey toward individuation. A chronological history of the development of Jung's dream theory is presented, followed by a picture of the relationship between Jung and Pauli. Thereafter, a detailed summary of the seminar transcripts, one given on Bailey Island, Maine, and the other in New York City the following year, is offered with hermeneutic commentary. An analysis of the seminars found that Pauli's dreams did, in part, support Jung's theory. Specifically, while Jung was unable to meet the scientific demands for clear empirical evidence of his dream theory, he did offer his professional and non-professional audiences with a slightly less rigorous example of his dream theory in action, demonstrating that the process shared similarities across peoples, time, and cultures. Additionally, in Pauli he found a superior mind that had gone through the process of individuation in accordance with his theory and his own experience. During the course of research, reference to a document was found in the correspondence in the Jungian Archives in Zurich. This document entitled, \"FAREWELL SPEECH, Given by Dr. C. G. Jung on the Occasion of a Dinner Given in His Honor by the Analytical Psychology Club of New York City October 26, 1937\" and other related documents were subsequently uncovered in the sub-basement of the Kristine Mann Library in New York City. A synopsis of the discovery and description of the papers contained in the file are discussed in\n\nSuppression of Pauli Spin Blockade in Few Hole Laterally Gated Double Quantum Dots\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGaudreau, Louis; Bogan, Alex; Studenikin, Sergei; Korkusinski, Marek; Aers, Geof; Zawadzki, Piotr; Sachrajda, Andy; Tracy, Lisa; Reno, John; Hargett, Terry; National Research Council Team; Sandia Labs Team\n\nHole spins have attracted increasing attention as candidates for qubits in quantum information applications. The p-type character of their wavefunction leads to smaller hyperfine interaction with the nuclei resulting in longer coherence times. Additionally, strong spin-orbit interaction allows for enhanced all-electrical manipulation of spin qubit states. Single hole spins have been electrically studied in InSb and Si nanowire quantum dots, however, electrostatically confined hole spins in a 2D hole gas have thus far been limited to the many hole regime. In this talk we will present a full description of the two-hole spin spectrum in a lateral GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum. High-bias magneto-transport spectroscopy reveals all four states of the spectrum (singlet and triplets) in both the (1,1) and (2,0) configurations, essential for spin readout based on Pauli spin blockade. We show that spin-flip tunneling between dots is as strong as spin conserving tunneling, a consequence of the strong spin-orbit interaction. This suppresses the Pauli spin blockade. Our results suggest that alternate techniques for single hole spin qubit readout need to be explored.\n\nDirac and Pauli form factors from lattice QCD\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCollins, S.; Goeckeler, M.; Nobile, A.\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWe present a comprehensive analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon from a lattice simulation with two flavors of dynamical O(a)-improved Wilson fermions. A key feature of our calculation is that we make use of an extensive ensemble of lattice gauge field configurations with four different lattice spacings, multiple volumes, and pion masses down to m{sub {pi}{approx}1}80 MeV. We find that by employing Kelly-inspired parametrizations for the Q{sup 2} dependence of the form factors, we are able to obtain stable fits over our complete ensemble. Dirac and Pauli radii and the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleon aremoreÂ Â» extracted and results at light quark masses provide evidence for chiral nonanalytic behavior in these fundamental observables.Â«Â less\n\nBook Review: No time to be brief: a scientific biography of Wolfgang Pauli. Charles P.

Friends and colleagues of Charles Enz had known for a long time that he was preparing a Pauli biography, but only after his retirement as a professor for theoretical physics at the University of Geneva he was able to devote all his time to this demanding endeavor.\n\nHeisenberg (and SchrÃ¶dinger, and Pauli) on hidden variables\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBacciagaluppi, Guido; Crull, Elise\n\nIn this paper, we discuss various aspects of Heisenberg's thought on hidden variables in the period 1927-1935. We also compare Heisenberg's approach to others current at the time, specifically that embodied by von Neumann's impossibility proof, but also views expressed mainly in correspondence by Pauli and by SchrÃ¶dinger. We shall base ourselves mostly on published and unpublished materials that are known but little-studied, among others Heisenberg's own draft response to the EPR paper. Our aim will be not only to clarify Heisenberg's thought on the hidden-variables question, but in part also to clarify how this question was understood more generally at the time.\n\nThermalization Time Bounds for Pauli Stabilizer Hamiltonians\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTemme, Kristan\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe prove a general lower bound to the spectral gap of the Davies generator for Hamiltonians that can be written as the sum of commuting Pauli operators. These Hamiltonians, defined on the Hilbert space of N-qubits, serve as one of the most frequently considered candidates for a self-correcting quantum memory. A spectral gap bound on the Davies generator establishes an upper limit on the life time of such a quantum memory and can be used to estimate the time until the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium when brought into contact with a thermal heat bath. The bound can be shown to behave as {Î» â¥ O(N^{-1} exp(-2Î² overline{É}))}, where {overline{É}} is a generalization of the well known energy barrier for logical operators. Particularly in the low temperature regime we expect this bound to provide the correct asymptotic scaling of the gap with the system size up to a factor of N -1. Furthermore, we discuss conditions and provide scenarios where this factor can be removed and a constant lower bound can be proven.\n\nPauli-Zeldovich cancellation of the vacuum energy divergences, auxiliary fields and supersymmetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKamenshchik, Alexander Yu.; Starobinsky, Alexei A.; Tronconi, Alessandro; Vardanyan, Tereza; Venturi, Giovanni\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe have considered the Pauli-Zeldovich mechanism for the cancellation of the ultraviolet divergences in vacuum energy. This mechanism arises because bosons and fermions give contributions of the opposite signs. In contrast with the preceding papers devoted to this topic wherein mainly free fields were studied, here we have taken their interactions into account to the lowest order of perturbation theory. We have constructed some simple toy models having particles with spin 0 and spin 1 / 2, where masses of the particles are equal while the interactions can be quite non-trivial.\n\nQuark correlations in the color glass condensate: Pauli blocking and the ridge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAltinoluk, Tolga; Armesto, NÃ©stor; Beuf, Guillaume; Kovner, Alex; Lublinsky, Michael\n\n2017-02-01\n\nWe consider, for the first time, correlations between quarks produced in p-A collisions in the framework of the color glass condensate. We find a quark-quark ridge that shows a dip at Î Î· Ë2 relative to the gluon-gluon ridge. The origin of this dip is the short-range (in rapidity) Pauli blocking experienced by quarks in the wave function of the incoming projectile. We observe that these correlations, present in the initial state, survive the scattering process. We suggest that this effect may be observable in open charm-open charm correlations at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nPauli graphs, Riemann hypothesis, and Goldbach pairs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPlanat, M.; Anselmi, F.; SolÃ©, P.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nWe consider the Pauli group Pq generated by unitary quantum generators X (shift) and Z (clock) acting on vectors of the q-dimensional Hilbert space. It has been found that the number of maximal mutually commuting sets within Pq is controlled by the Dedekind psi function Ï(q) and that there exists a specific inequality involving the Euler constant Î³ Ë 0.577 that is only satisfied at specific low dimensions q â A = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 30}. The set A is closely related to the set Aâª{ 1, 24} of integers that are totally Goldbach, i.e., that consist of all primes p < n - 1 with p not dividing n and such that n-p is prime. In the extreme high-dimensional case, at primorial numbers Nr, the Hardy-Littlewood function R(q) is introduced for estimating the number of Goldbach pairs, and a new inequality (Theorem 4) is established for the equivalence to the Riemann hypothesis in terms of R(Nr). We discuss these number-theoretical properties in the context of the qudit commutation structure.\n\nThe symmetries of the fine gradings of sl(n{sup k},C) associated with direct product of Pauli groups\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHan Gang\n\n2010-09-15\n\nA grading of a Lie algebra is called fine if it could not be further refined. For a fine grading of a simple Lie algebra, we define its Weyl group to describe the symmetry of this grading. It is already known that the Weyl group of the fine grading of sl(n,C) induced by the action of the group {Pi}{sub n} of the generalized Pauli matrices of rank n is SL(2,Z{sub n}), where Z{sub n} is the cyclic group of order n. In this paper, we consider the fine grading of sl(n{sup k},C) induced by the action of the group ofmoreÂ Â» k-fold tensor product of the generalized Pauli matrices of rank n. We prove that its Weyl group is Sp(2k,Z{sub n}) and is generated by transvections; therefore, this generalizes the previous result.Â«Â less\n\nNon-Separability and Synchronicity: Pauli, Jung and a New Historical, Philosophical Perspective on Quantum Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGiannetto, E. A.; Pozzi, F.\n\nWe would like to discuss the historical emergence of quantum physics and quantum non-separability, by analysing Pauli's point of view in relation to Jung's ideas. Recent inquiries on EPR shows that quantum non-separability indicates an a-causal connection of the \"quantum reality\" for space-like intervals (\"simultaneity region \") of world (measurement) events: this non-causal connection is the physical counterpart of what Jung called \"synchronicity \" with an assessment given also by Pauli. This does not imply any violation of mechanical causality by any introduction of action-at-a-distance. From a physical point of view a-causal connections can be interpreted as implying a particular quantum topology of space-time, which leads to a non-mechanistic conception of nature and which could be related to a holistic quantum dynamical reality of the world like Bohm's \"holomovement\" or \"light\". This kind of non-mechanistic conception of nature as well as the idea of non-separability of the world and of synchronicity, as stated by Jung itself, was developed by Leibnitz: from this point of view, we can look at quantum physics (as well as for relativity it was shown) as related to a new emergence of concepts belonging to the Leibnitzian (anti-Newtonian) tradition.\n\nBreitâPauli atomic structure calculations for Fe XI\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAggarwal, Sunny, E-mail: sunny.du87@gmail.com; Singh, Jagjit; Mohan, Man\n\nEnergy levels, oscillator strengths, and transition probabilities are calculated for the lowest-lying 165 energy levels of Fe XI using configuration-interaction wavefunctions. The calculations include all the major correlation effects. Relativistic effects are included in the BreitâPauli approximation by adding mass-correction, Darwin, and spinâorbit interaction terms to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian. For comparison with the calculated ab initio energy levels, we have also calculated the energy levels by using the fully relativistic multiconfiguration DiracâFock method. The calculated results are in close agreement with the National Institute of Standards and Technology compilation and other available results. New results are predicted for many ofmoreÂ Â» the levels belonging to the 3s3p{sup 4}3d and 3s3p{sup 3}3d{sup 2} configurations, which are very important in astrophysics, relevant, for example, to the recent observations by the Hinode spacecraft. We expect that our extensive calculations will be useful to experimentalists in identifying the fine structure levels in their future work.Â«Â less\n\nGeneralized Pauli constraints in reduced density matrix functional theory.\n\nPubMed\n\nTheophilou, Iris; Lathiotakis, Nektarios N; Marques, Miguel A L; Helbig, Nicole\n\n2015-04-21\n\nFunctionals of the one-body reduced density matrix (1-RDM) are routinely minimized under Coleman's ensemble N-representability conditions. Recently, the topic of pure-state N-representability conditions, also known as generalized Pauli constraints, received increased attention following the discovery of a systematic way to derive them for any number of electrons and any finite dimensionality of the Hilbert space. The target of this work is to assess the potential impact of the enforcement of the pure-state conditions on the results of reduced density-matrix functional theory calculations. In particular, we examine whether the standard minimization of typical 1-RDM functionals under the ensemble N-representability conditions violates the pure-state conditions for prototype 3-electron systems. We also enforce the pure-state conditions, in addition to the ensemble ones, for the same systems and functionals and compare the correlation energies and optimal occupation numbers with those obtained by the enforcement of the ensemble conditions alone.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCurceanu, C.; Bragadireanu, M.; Sirghi, D.\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) is one of the basic principles of modern physics and, even if there are no compelling reasons to doubt its validity, it is still debated today because an intuitive, elementary explanation is still missing, and because of its unique stand among the basic symmetries of physics. We present an experimental test of the validity of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for electrons based on a straightforward idea put forward a few years ago by Ramberg and Snow (E. Ramberg and G. A. Snow 1990 Phys. Lett. B 238 438). We performed a very accurate search ofmoreÂ Â» X-rays from the Pauli-forbidden atomic transitions of electrons in the already filled 1S shells of copper atoms.

The symmetric and antisymmetric forms correspond to symmetric and antisymmetric extensions of thermodynamics from matter to antimatter - this is demonstrated by proving the corresponding H-theorem. The two forms are based on the thermodynamic similarity of matter and antimatter and differ only in the directions of thermodynamic time for matter and antimatter (the same in the time-symmetric case and the opposite in the time-antisymmetric case). We demonstrate that, while the symmetric form of PME predicts an equibalance between matter and antimatter, the antisymmetric form of PME favours full conversion of antimatter into matter. At this stage, it is impossible to make an experimentally justified choice in favour of the symmetric or antisymmetric versions of thermodynamics since we have no experience of thermodynamic properties of macroscopic objects made of antimatter, but experiments of this kind may become possible in the future.\n\nSymmetric and antisymmetric forms of the Pauli master equation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKlimenko, A.

It is natural to ask whether the classical Hamiltonian (with both the orbital and spin parts) is consistent with that in the relativistic quantum theory for a spin-1/2 charged particle, which is described by the Dirac equation. In the low-energy limit, up to terms of the seventh order in 1/E{sub g} (E{sub g}=2mc{sup 2} and m is the particle mass), we investigate the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation of themoreÂ Â» Dirac Hamiltonian in the presence of homogeneous and static electromagnetic fields and show that it is indeed in agreement with the classical Hamiltonian with the gyromagnetic ratio being equal to 2. Through electromagnetic duality, this result can be generalized for a spin-1/2 dyon, which has both electric and magnetic charges and thus possesses both intrinsic electric and magnetic dipole moments. Furthermore, the relativistic quantum theory for a spin-1/2 dyon with arbitrary values of the gyromagnetic and gyroelectric ratios can be described by the Dirac-Pauli equation, which is the Dirac equation with augmentation for the anomalous electric and anomalous magnetic dipole moments. The FW transformation of the Dirac-Pauli Hamiltonian is shown, up to the seventh-order again, to be in accord with the classical Hamiltonian as well.Â«Â less\n\nUse of an Optical Multichannel Analyzer for Reflectivity Measurements\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-03-01\n\nverified and expanded upon through the works of Bohr, Schrodinger, Dirac and others.

They conjectured a picture in which the mental and the material arise as two complementary aspects of one underlying psychophysically neutral reality to which they cannot be reduced and to which direct empirical access is impossible. This picture suggests structural, persistent,re-producible mind-matter correlations by splitting the underlying reality into aspects. In addition, it suggests induced, occasional, evasive mind-matter correlations above and below, respectively, those stable baseline correlations. These correlations, and the way they arise, suggest that the domain of the physical is not completely independent of the domain of the mental, and both are not independent from the assumed reality underlying them.

J.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEffective spin-spin interactions between ? qubits enable the determination of the eigenvalue of an arbitrary Pauli product of dimension N with a constant, small number of multi-qubit gates that is independent of N and encodes the eigenvalue in the measurement basis states of an extra ancilla qubit. Such interactions are available whenever qubits can be coupled to a shared harmonic oscillator, a situation that can be realized in many physical qubit implementations. For example, suitable interactions have already been realized for up to 14 qubits in ion traps. It should be possible to implement stabilizer codes for quantum error correction with a constant number of multi-qubit gates, in contrast to typical constructions with a number of two-qubit gates that increases as a function of N. The special case of finding the parity of N qubits only requires a small number of operations that is independent of N. This compares favorably to algorithms for computing the parity on conventional machines, which implies a genuine quantum advantage.\n\nPinning of fermionic occupation numbers.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchilling, Christian; Gross, David; Christandl, Matthias\n\n2013-01-25\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle is a constraint on the natural occupation numbers of fermionic states. It has been suspected since at least the 1970s, and only proved very recently, that there is a multitude of further constraints on these numbers, generalizing the Pauli principle. Here, we provide the first analytic analysis of the physical relevance of these constraints. We compute the natural occupation numbers for the ground states of a family of interacting fermions in a harmonic potential. Intriguingly, we find that the occupation numbers are almost, but not exactly, pinned to the boundary of the allowed region (quasipinned). The result suggests that the physics behind the phenomenon is richer than previously appreciated. In particular, it shows that for some models, the generalized Pauli constraints play a role for the ground state, even though they do not limit the ground-state energy. Our findings suggest a generalization of the Hartree-Fock approximation.\n\nWritings on Physics and Philosophy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPauli, Wolfgang Enz, Charles P.; Meyenn, Karl V.\n\nLike Bohr, Einstein and Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli was not only a Nobel laureate and one of the creators of modern physics, but also an eminent philosopher of modern science.

We reconsider their model in M-theory and study the process of birth and growth of nonlinear spinor and bosonic gravity during the construction of Mp-branes. Then, by application of this idea to BIonic system, we construct a BIonic superconductor in the background of nonlinear gravity. In this model, first, M0-branes link to each other and build an M5-brane and an anti-M5-brane connected by an M2-brane. M0-branes are zero dimensional objects that only scalars are attached to them. By constructing higher dimensional branes from M0-branes, gauge fields are produced. Also, if M0-branes don't link to each other completely, the symmetry of system is broken and fermions are created. The curvature produced by fermions has the opposite sign the curvature produced by gauge fields. Fermions on M5-branes and M2 plays the role of bridge between them. By passing time, M2 dissolves in M5's and nonlinear bosonic and spinor gravities are produced. By closing M5-branes towards each other, coupling of two identical fermions on two branes to each other causes that the square mass of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are created. For removing these tachyons, M5-branes compact, the sign of gravity between branes reverses, anti-gravity is produced which causes that branes and identical fermions get away from each other. This is the reason for the emergence of Pauli exclusion principle in Bionic system. Also, the spinor gravity vanishes and its energy builds a new M2 between M5-branes. We obtain the resistivity in this system and find that its value decreases by closing M5 branes to each other and shrinks to zero at colliding point of branes. This idea has different applications. For example, in cosmology, universes are located on M5-branes and M2-brane has the role of bridge between\n\nVisualizing heavy fermion confinement and Pauli-limited superconductivity in layered CeCoIn 5\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nGyenis, AndrÃ¡s; Feldman, Benjamin E.; Randeria, Mallika T.; ...\n\n2018-02-07\n\nLayered material structures play a key role in enhancing electronâelectron interactions to create correlated metallic phases that can transform into unconventional superconducting states. The quasi-two-dimensional electronic properties of such compounds are often inferred indirectly through examination of bulk properties. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to directly probe in cross-section the quasi-two-dimensional electronic states of the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn 5. Our measurements reveal the strong confined nature of quasiparticles, anisotropy of tunneling characteristics, and layer-by-layer modulated behavior of the precursor pseudogap gap phase. In the interlayer coupled superconducting state, the orientation of line defects relative to the d-wave ordermoreÂ Â» parameter determines whether in-gap states form due to scattering. Spectroscopic imaging of the anisotropic magnetic vortex cores directly characterizes the short interlayer superconducting coherence length and shows an electronic phase separation near the upper critical in-plane magnetic field, consistent with a Pauli-limited first-order phase transition into a pseudogap phase.Â«Â less\n\nFirst-principles study on stability of transition metal solutes in aluminum by analyzing the underlying forces\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiu, Wei; Xu, Yichun; Li, Xiangyan\n\n2015-05-07\n\nAlthough there have been some investigations on behaviors of solutes in metals under strain, the underlying mechanism of how strain changes the stability of a solute is still unknown. To gain such knowledge, first-principles calculations are performed on substitution energy of transition metal solutes in fcc Al host under rhombohedral strain (RS). Our results show that under RS, substitution energy decreases linearly with the increase of outermost d radius r{sub d} of the solute due to Pauli repulsion. The screened Coulomb interaction increases or decreases the substitution energy of a solute on condition that its Pauling electronegativity scale Ï{sub P}moreÂ Â» is less or greater than that of Al under RS. This paper verifies a linear relation of substitution energy change versus r{sub d} and Ï{sub P} under RS, which might be instructive for composition design of long life alloys serving in high stress condition.Â«Â less\n\nUpper critical fields in Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O single crystals: Evidence for dominant Pauli paramagnetic effect\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbdel-Hafiez, M.; Brisbois, J.; Zhu, Z.; Adamski, A.; Hassen, A.; Vasiliev, A.

These data were inferred from the measurements of the temperature-dependent resistance in static magnetic fields up to 14 T and magnetoresistance in pulsed fields up to 60 T. Hc 2 values are found to be 52 and 50 T for H â¥a b and H â¥c , respectively. These values are 1.2-1.35 times larger than the weak-coupling Pauli paramagnetic limit (HpË1.84 Tc ), indicating that enhanced paramagnetic limiting is essential and this superconductor is unconventional. Our observations of strong bending in the Hc2 a b(T ) curves and a nearly isotropic maximum upper critical field Hc2 a b(0 ) âHc2 c(0 ) support the presence of a strong Pauli paramagnetic effect. We show that the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula that includes the spin-orbit scattering can effectively describe the Hc2 a b(T ) curve, whereas Hc 2 deviates from the conventional WHH theoretical model without considering the spin paramagnetic effect for the H â¥c and H â¥a b directions. For H â¥c , a two-band model is required to fully reproduce the behavior of Hc 2, while for H â¥a b the spin paramagnetic effect is responsible for the behavior of Hc 2.

A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe address measurement schemes where certain observables Xk are chosen at random within a set of nondegenerate isospectral observables and then measured on repeated preparations of a physical system. Each observable has a probability zk to be measured, with âkzk=1, and the statistics of this generalized measurement is described by a positive operator-valued measure. This kind of scheme is referred to as quantum roulettes, since each observable Xk is chosen at random, e.g., according to the fluctuating value of an external parameter. Here we focus on quantum roulettes for qubits involving the measurements of Pauli matrices, and we explicitly evaluate their canonical Naimark extensions, i.e., their implementation as indirect measurements involving an interaction scheme with a probe system. We thus provide a concrete model to realize the roulette without destroying the signal state, which can be measured again after the measurement or can be transmitted. Finally, we apply our results to the description of Stern-Gerlach-like experiments on a two-level system.\n\nPhotoionization of S3+ using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStancalie, V.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSulphur is one of the most abundant chemical elements in the universe and a large number of lines have been observed in the spectra of astrophysical object. The S IV and SV ions considered in this work have received much interest in the last decade. The main objective of the present work is to report on photoionization cross-sections of S IV using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM) method. We have carried out extensive non-relativistic and relativistic calculations of the photoionization cross sections to focus on relativistic effects. The reliability of the atomic data presented here has been carefully tested. We have exploited the BPRM code to describe the atomic wavefunctions and generate the energy levels for the SV 81 fine-structure bound target states and the corresponding A-values for transitions between these levels. The partial and total cross sections for the photoionization of the Al-like S3+ ground and excited states are determined for photon energy ranging from the S4+ 3s2 threshold up to the S4+ 4s threshold. We present statistically weighted, level resolved ground photoionization cross sections for the S IV ion. Both resonance positions and the oscillator strengths are presented. Extensive comparison of the present calculated values with those obtained from direct theoretical scattering calculation is also presented. To the best of our knowledge, the work reported herein describes for the first time a detailed relativistic photoionization calculation for this system, and the results are relevant to the laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.\n\nOn the Runge-Lenz-Pauli vector operator as an aid to the calculation of atomic processes in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHey, J. D.\n\n2015-09-01\n\nOn the basis of the original definition and analysis of the vector operator by Pauli (1926 Z. Phys. 36 336-63), and further developments by Flamand (1966 J. Math. Phys. 7 1924-31), and by Becker and Bleuler (1976 Z. Naturforsch. 31a 517-23), we consider the action of the operator on both spherical polar and parabolic basis state wave functions, both with and without direct use of Pauliâs identity (Valent 2003 Am. J. Phys. 71 171-75). Comparison of the results, with the aid of two earlier papers (Hey 2006 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 39 2641-64, Hey 2007 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 40 4077-96), yields a convenient ladder technique in the form of a recurrence relation for calculating the transformation coefficients between the two sets of basis states, without explicit use of generalized hypergeometric functions. This result is therefore very useful for application to Stark effect and impact broadening calculations applied to high-n radio recombination lines from tenuous space plasmas. We also demonstrate the versatility of the Runge-Lenz-Pauli vector operator as a means of obtaining recurrence relations between expectation values of successive powers of quantum mechanical operators, by using it to provide, as an example, a derivation of the Kramers-Pasternack relation. It is suggested that this operator, whose potential use in Stark- and Zeeman-effect calculations for magnetically confined fusion edge plasmas (Rosato, Marandet and Stamm 2014 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 47 105702) and tenuous space plasmas ( H II regions) has not been fully explored and exploited, may yet be found to yield a number of valuable results for applications to plasma diagnostic techniques based upon rate calculations of atomic processes.\n\nMany-body formalism for fermions: The partition function\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWatson, D. K.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe partition function, a fundamental tenet in statistical thermodynamics, contains in principle all thermodynamic information about a system. It encapsulates both microscopic information through the quantum energy levels and statistical information from the partitioning of the particles among the available energy levels. For identical particles, this statistical accounting is complicated by the symmetry requirements of the allowed quantum states. In particular, for Fermi systems, the enforcement of the Pauli principle is typically a numerically demanding task, responsible for much of the cost of the calculations. The interplay of these three elementsâthe structure of the many-body spectrum, the statistical partitioning of the N particles among the available levels, and the enforcement of the Pauli principleâdrives the behavior of mesoscopic and macroscopic Fermi systems. In this paper, we develop an approach for the determination of the partition function, a numerically difficult task, for systems of strongly interacting identical fermions and apply it to a model system of harmonically confined, harmonically interacting fermions. This approach uses a recently introduced many-body method that is an extension of the symmetry-invariant perturbation method (SPT) originally developed for bosons. It uses group theory and graphical techniques to avoid the heavy computational demands of conventional many-body methods which typically scale exponentially with the number of particles. The SPT application of the Pauli principle is trivial to implement since it is done \"on paper\" by imposing restrictions on the normal-mode quantum numbers at first order in the perturbation. The method is applied through first order and represents an extension of the SPT method to excited states. Our method of determining the partition function and various thermodynamic quantities is accurate and efficient and has the potential to yield interesting insight into the role played by the Pauli\n\nInner-shell photoionization of atomic chlorine near the 2p-1 edge: a Breit-Pauli R-matrix calculation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFelfli, Z.; Deb, N.

We pursue the investigation of a model for sub-Chandrasekhar supernovae Ia explosions (SNIa) in which the energy stored in the Pauli tower is released to trigger a nuclear deflagration. The simplest physical model for such a degeneracy breakdown and collapse of the Pauli tower is a phase transition to an exactly supersymmetric state in which the scalar partners of protons, neutrons, and leptons become degenerate with the familiar fermions of our world as in the supersymmetric standard model with susy breaking parameters relaxed to zero. We focus on the ability of the susy phase transition model to fit the total SNIa rate as well as the delay time distribution of SNIa after the birth of a progenitor white dwarf. We also study the ejected mass distribution and its correlation with delay time.

To this end, we use configuration interaction (CI) expansions of the exact wave function in Slater determinants built from natural orbitals in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. With the exception of maximally polarized systems, the natural orbitals of spin eigenstates are generally spin dependent, i.e., the spatial parts of the up and down natural orbitals form two different sets. A measure to quantify this spin dependence is introduced and it is shown that it varies by several orders of magnitude depending on the system. We also study the ordering issue of the spin-dependent occupation numbers which has practical implications in reduced density matrix functional theory minimization schemes, when generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) are imposed and in the form of the CI expansion in terms of the natural orbitals.

Hence, this part of the simulation algorithm is described in details.Â«Â less\n\nMicroscopic calculations of dynamics and N/Z equilibration in peripheral collisions below the Fermi energy.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSouliotis, G. A.; Shetty, D. V.; Galanopoulos, S.; Yennello, S. J.\n\n2008-04-01\n\nA systematic study of heavy residues formed in peripheral collisions below the Fermi energy has been undertaken at Texas A&M aiming at obtaining information on the mechanism of nucleon exchange and the course towards N/Z equilibration [1,2]. We expect to get insight on the dynamics and the nuclear equation of state by comparing our heavy residue data to detailed calculations using microscopic models of quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) type. We are performing calculations using two codes: the CoMD code of M. Papa, A. Bonasera [3] and the CHIMERA-QMD code of J. Lukasik [4]. Both codes implement an effective interaction with a nuclear-matter compressibility of K=200 (soft EOS) with several forms of the density dependence of the nucleon-nucleon symmetry potential. CoMD imposes a constraint in the phase space occupation for each nucleon restoring the Pauli principle at each time step of the collision. CHIMERA-QMD uses a Pauli potential term to mimic the Pauli principle. Results of the calculations and comparisons with our residue data will be presented. [1] G.A. Souliotis et al., Phys. Rev.
