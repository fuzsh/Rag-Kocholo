Kathie’s first day as a\n\nfreshman began shortly after midnight when\n\nshe boarded the plane to Philadelphia from\n\nher hometown of Tempe, Arizona. It was\n\nmore than 24 hours later before Kathie got to\n\nbed in her new home in Wharton.\n\nIn those 24-plus hours Kathie began the\n\nfour-day process of getting oriented to her\n\nnew life. A 77-man freshman orientation\n\ncommittee, composed mostly of sophomores, 1\n\nhad been working since last spring to plan\n\nactivities that would give Kathie and her\n\n342 classmates (the largest freshman class in |\n\nthe College’s history) a helpful introduction |\n\nto the campus and to each other.\n\nThey met them at the airport and train I\n\nstation and manned the registration tables ini\n\nParrish, where freshmen picked up a packet I\n\nliterature they had assembled and their room\n\nkey. They directed freshmen to their\n\ndormitories and helped them with luggage.\n\nThey gave a tea for freshmen and their\n\nparents so they would have a chance to meet\n\nPresident Friend, also beginning his freshm\n\nyear. Later President Friend addressed the\n\nfreshman class in the Meeting House and th\n\nfreshmen returned to their dorms for hall\n\nmeetings with the upperclass resident\n\nassistants. The day ended with roving dorm\n\nparties which finally converged on Commonsj\n\nat 11 P.M. for beer and dancing and\n\nconversation.\n\nThe next days were even fuller: advanced1\n\nplacement tests in languages, English\n\nliterature, chemistry and biology; a swimmi\n\ntest, conferences with faculty advisers,\n\nmeetings with the deans, a game of Capture\n\nthe Flag played with 300 squirt guns, a\n\nbarbecue with faculty, a bonfire in the Cruffij'\n\na square dance, a late night swim. Camp\n\nSwarthmore, as people have dubbed Fresh\n\nOrientation, was in full swing and the Class\n\n’77 was prepped for the first day of classes. I\n\nOn her first day, Kathie found her mailbox, unpacked,\n\nmade friends, and looked up Admissions Officer\n\nBarbara Pearson Lange ’31, who was instrumental\n\nm setting up the new Rocky Mountain\n\nScholarship which Kathie won.\n\nPhotographs by James Purring\n\nCamp Swarthmore\n\nKathie listens attentively to President Friend, whom she’d met at the\n\nFreshman tea, address the Class of ’77 in the Meeting House.\n\nOn Sharpies patio she and roommates sort out the day’s advice,\n\nincluding “Down East Smoggy Air and Dirty Crum Creek Blues a pseudo­\n\nsubversive alternative to your freshman orientation handbook,\n\npublished by The Committee to make Togetherness Omnipresent (CoTomato).\n\n2\n\nS W A R T H M O R E A LU M N l*r 0 B E R\n\nKathie and two of her three roommates hear Residen\n\nAssistant Cabot Christianson ’75 tell freshmen in his\n\ncoed section of Wharton to lock their doors, be\n\ncareful with candles, don’t put their beds on the floor,\n\nbe sensitive to those around them, and to knock\n\non his door any time with any problems. At freshmar\n\ndorm party, Kathie has fun and forgets her worry\n\nthat she “ won’t be able to cut the academics.”\n\nH | glfil\n\nWbSLjl.'* JH\n\n; -H\n\nsssi\n\n1M\n\nft l\n\n-m\n\nThe Swarthmore College\n\nBulletin, of which this\n\npublication is Volume LXXI,\n\nNo. 2, is published in\n\nSeptember, October, March,\n\nMay, July, and twice in\n\nDecember and January\n\nby Swarthmore College,\n\nSwarthmore, Pennsylvania 19081\n\n¡Qjlff’OBER, 1973\n\nCamp Swarthmore\n\nFootball players have\n\ntheir own special orientation\n\nFor Louis Lupin ’77, a McCabe Delmarva\n\nScholar from Claymont, Delaware, Freshman\n\nOrientation was different. Lou arrived on\n\ncampus the day after Labor Day to play\n\nfootball. By the time his classmates arrived,\n\nLou said, “I more or less felt I was already\n\noriented.” The only event he went to the first\n\nday of orientation was the Parrish party and\n\nonly then because another football player\n\ndragged him. He went home early. There was\n\nlittle time for Lou, an enthusiastic jazz\n\nmusician, to keep up with his routine of daily\n\nbass practice and his lessons had to be postponed\n\nuntil classes started.\n\n“I was too tired. Pre-season practice was\n\npretty tough in terms of conditioning and the\n\ndouble sessions were exhausting, even though I\n\nhad been in good shape from lifting weights all\n\nsummer and running two miles a day since\n\nAugust 1.”\n\nCoach Millard Robinson conducted his own\n\nform of orientation over the summer with all his\n\nplayers, writing to the men and getting in touch\n\nwith many returning lettermen personally. “I\n\nreally liked all the football mailings,” says Lou.\n\n“It was cheering to know he cared that much.”\n\nÜ,\n\nm\n\nWÊÊ\n\nK\n\nf\n\n?\n\nêÊBm\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI*\n\nI\n\nâ\n\nAfter a full day sharpening his skills as defensive\n\nlinebacker, Lou Lupin relaxes with another\n\nfootball player and classmate, Mike Ehrhardt.\n\nS W A R T H M O R E A L U M N I W CTa S\n\nHow an “I” battled a faceless “they” to rid\n\nthe Potomac of the CIA’s unique form of industrial waste\n\nBY JOHN SEABURY THOMSON ’43\n\nI canoe to work.\n\nexperiences of life in Washington: the\n\nEach morning, except when the Sycamore Island Canoe Club, the\n\nPotomac is ice-bound or in flood, Canoe Cruisers Association, and all\n\neither alone or with one or two friends, the pleasures of white water canoeing.\n\nI park my car on MacArthur Boule­ It also provided the foundation for the\n\nvard, hike across two footbridges and Top Secret Slurry Caper.\n\ndown a zig-zag path to the river bank,\n\n“Pulp Run” is a small year-round\n\ntake the rope-drawn ferry to Sycamore streamlet, unnamed on local maps,\n\nIsland, launch my canoe on the quiet which winds through the northern Vir­\n\naters of the Potomac and paddle ginia countryside and across the old\n\ncross to the Virginia shore.

We often woner what the traffic helicopters\n\nbverhead think of us—but find\n\nthe wildlife, birds and flowers\n\nfar more interesting and attrac­\n\ntive. Unpredicted windstorms\n\n—and high waves on the Po­\n\ntomac—have given us pause,\n\n3ut nothing can undercut the\n\nsatisfaction the canoe pool has\n\nprovided.\n\nCanoeing to work has opened\n\n^P the way to some of the best\n\nI igpCTOBER, 1 9 7 3\n\nlation explosion and big government\n\nhave overtaken the area, and Pulp\n\nRun’s drainage basin has been vastly\n\nchanged, although the Potomac Pali­\n\nsades through which it cuts remain\n\nlargely untouched. It is second-growth\n\nwoodland: sycamore, hickory, persim­\n\nmon and pawpaw, together with the\n\nfallen hulks of old chestnut scattered\n\nalong its slopes. The Leiter mansion\n\nis gone, destroyed by fire, and the\n\nGeorge Washington Memorial Park­\n\nway runs along the crest of the pali­\n\nsade, bridging Pulp Run with a cul­\n\nvert. Back farther from the river, the\n\nmassive Central Intelligence Agency\n\nheadquarters building sits firmly\n\nastride the Pulp Run valley and, once\n\nagain, Pulp Run follows its natural\n\ncourse some thirty to fifty feet below\n\nthe new ground level. As has always\n\nbeen the case, Pulp Run carries the\n\nrunoff from the rains and serves as the\n\nlocal storm sewer. The reshaping of\n\nthe land contours and the\n\nlarge-scale paving operations\n\nwhich accompanied the build­\n\ning process sharply changed the\n\nrun-off patterns, bringing heav­\n\nier water flows after each storm\n\nand increased erosion but, byand-large, the visual quality of\n\nthe water was remarkably un­\n\nchanged. It remained cool, fresh\n\nand transparent—a lovely nat­\n\nural stream of water.\n\nApparent catastrophe struck\n\nPulp Rim in the 1960’s, when,\n\nin a move which reduced air\n\npollution and allowed for the\n\n5\n\n“I canoe to work.

Once there, I chain the\n\ncanoe to a tree, hide the paddles, and\n\nhike up through the woods, along the\n\nGeorge Washington Memorial Parkway,\n\nand into the north gate of the Central\n\nIntelligence Agency’s grounds. In the\n\nevening I reverse the pattern.”\n\nPhotographs by Walter Behr.\n\n6\n\n¡recycling of paper products, the CIA\n\nswitched from burning its classified\n\n|vaste to reducing it to pulp through\n\nI chemical process. The General Serv­\n\nices Administration now takes this\n\npulp, solidifies it, introduces seeds and\n\nfertilizer, and spreads it over the strip\n\npine area of West Virginia. Periodially, however, (and it frequently ap­\n\npeared to be a daily event) the pulping\n\nnks have had to be washed out. Quite\n\nnaturally, this washing water was al­\n\nlowed to flow into the established drain\n\nthe basement floor; and this basepent drain, designed to carry off the\n\nloff from rain storms and normal\n\nrater spillages, connected into the\n\nItorm sewer. The water and its slurry\n\nof pulp thus disappeared deep under)pound in the Agency’s basement. Al­\n\nthough it was not observed by the\n\nHypers—Pulp Run emerges only after\n\n_t leaves the Agency grounds, out be­\n\nyond the fence deep in the woods—\n\n¡he stream was turned periodically\n\nto a discolored sewer. In the momgs, as a rule, the water ran clear and\n\nyean. In the afternoons, however, it\n\nbecame thick with a slurry of paper\n\nlarticles. The CIA was putting into\n\nlie Potomac its own unique industrial\n\n.aste of Top Secret Pulp.\n\nAll this went unnoticed for about\n\nle years—it was a small thing in the\n\n|e of the Potomac—except when an\n\nKasional canoeist or walker stumbled\n\njito the stream by mistake. Then in\n\npril, 1971, we three Agency officers\n\nbo had been canoeing to work (for\n\nlasure and exercise) shifted our\n\nfading place to the mouth of Pulp\n\ninn.\n\n¡Indignant at first, like other canoe|s before us, we soon turned to ex■\n\n©ration and ultimately to the con­\n\nfusion that our Agency was guilty of\n\nlllution. I, who have always enjoyed\n\nping battle with windmills—with the\n\nfadeless, faceless “they,” “them,” and\n\nft” of large bureaucracies, launched a\n\njunpaign to clean up this small but\n\n■itating addition to the Potomac’s\n\ni'oblems.\n\nlit was predictable that the faceless\n\njireaucrats quickly disappeared to be\n\nplaced by individuals just as conjjrned and disturbed about the probfus as I was. Each in his own way,\n\nPTOBER, 1973\n\nhowever, was struggling with the pro­\n\ncedural problems of a large organiza­\n\ntion—with the further problems of\n\ndealing with other large organizations:\n\nThe General Services Administration,\n\nthe Environmental Protection Agency,\n\nand the Fairfax County Authorities.\n\nAs a matter of record, all of these\n\norganizations have shown a real and\n\nconstructive concern for the reduction\n\nof environmental pollution.\n\nI was greeted with skepticism, cool\n\nreserve, and what I sensed as a degree\n\nof hostility on my first, and only,\n\nmeeting with the officers charged with\n\nhandling the Pulp Run Problem. Who\n\nwas this nut, they seemed to be ask­\n\ning, who was stirring up trouble over\n\nsuch a minor thing as this storm\n\nsewer? I pointed out the exact location\n\nof the problem on an Agency map—\n\nand this was duly recorded with a red\n\ngrease pencil on an acetate overlay.\n\nI volunteered to report regularly on\n\nthe state of the stream, since I planned\n\nto observe it each morning and eve­\n\nning, and left the problem in the\n\nhands of the bureaucracy.\n\nThe next morning all the coolness,\n\nskepticism and hostility evaporated.\n\nI was told I was absolutely right. WTe\n\nwere polluting the stream. Top Secret\n\nPulp was the cause. I was urged to\n\nhave patience. The problem was far\n\nmore complex than, on the surface, it\n\nmight seem. Paper pulp has the char­\n\nacteristic of clogging up sewer lines\n\nand turning rock-hard. The bureau­\n\ncratic process is, at best, slow and in­\n\nvolved. Nonetheless, something would\n\nbe done. Indeed, I remained patient—\n\nwhat else could be done?—but chose\n\nto provide the information I had\n\npromised on the on-going state of the\n\nstream and its pulp content in written\n\nreports and occasional phone calls.\n\nFrustration and irritation sometimes\n\nsurfaced in the eight letters I filed be­\n\ntween May 10 and December 13. Prog­\n\nress seemed almost nonexistent after\n\na first flurry of activity which resulted\n\nin filters being placed in the pulping\n\nplant’s storm sewer. I learned indi­\n\nrectly, however, that my letters were\n\nhaving an effect even though they\n\nbrought no replies. They were being\n\nused as ammunition in the negotia­\n\ntions with the county authorities. I\n\nregained the degree of patience needed.\n\nPatience was rewarded. On Decem­\n\nber 29 my phone rang. “John, you will\n\nbe pleased to know that as of Decem­\n\nber 22 the overflow from the pulping\n\nprocess has been diverted from the\n\nstorm sewer into the Fairfax County\n\nsewer system.” Since then Pulp Run\n\nhas been running clear.\n\nAlthough I had begun to fear that\n\naction would never come, I am im­\n\npressed, after the fact, that seven\n\nmonths is a surprisingly short period\n\nin which to have budged a large\n\nbureaucracy. I found later that the\n\nactual cash outlay for the hookup into\n\nthe sewer system was about $2,000—a\n\nsmall price to pay—and that the de­\n\nlay, if it can be so designated, was\n\nonly a wait for official authorization to\n\narrive from the county for the con­\n\nnection.\n\nMy correspondence on this Pulp\n\nRun Issue follows. It tells the story.\n\nI would be fascinated to know what\n\nother communication, inhouse and\n\ninteragency, went into the Top Secret\n\nSlurry Caper.\n\nMay 10, 1971\n\nMr. Charles S.\n\nOffice of Logistics and Supply\n\nDear Mr. S.\n\nI thought I’d give you a progress re­\n\nport on the state of the stream and the\n\nflow of the Top Secret Pulp into the\n\nPotomac River. I recognize that there\n\nhas not been the time to install the\n\nfilter designed to keep the pulp from\n\nthe river, but I thought you’d be inter­\n\nested in one week’s observation.\n\nOn Monday mornings, last week and\n\ntoday, the stream runs clear and seems\n\nto remain in that state through to\n\nsometime Tueday. From Wednesday\n\nthrough Friday, especially in the after­\n\nnoons, the stream gets progressively\n\nheavier with pulp—to the point where\n\nit makes a very distinct color change\n\nin the water at the mouth of the stream\n\nand out into the river. It soon is so di­\n\nluted and mixed, however, that it is\n\nlost in the general flow of the river.\n\nDespite the variations in the color\n\nof the water through the week, the\n\nsedimentary deposits of pulp on the\n\nbanks and in the stream bottom and\n\nout into the river are quite permanent\n\n7\n\n—and thoroughly unpleasant to the\n\ntouch. It will take quite a time of\n\nnatural flushing through heavy rains\n\nto clear the area up.\n\nI am very glad that steps are being\n\ntaken to stop this element of pollution\n\nfrom going into the river. Two points\n\npuzzle me still. First, how did it hap­\n\npen that the washings from our pulp­\n\ning process were ever allowed to flow,\n\nuntreated, into a natural stream? Sec­\n\nond, will the filtering of the pulp out\n\nof the wash return adequately pure\n\nwater to the stream or are we still\n\nadding possibly dangerous wastes to\n\nthe river, now in a clear form?\n\nFinally, I must admit that I find it\n\ndelightful that, like the mines which\n\nadd acids to the river, the farms with\n\ntheir excessive nitrates, and the subur­\n\nban homes with their phosphates,\n\nCIA’s unique form of industrial waste\n\nshould be Top Secret Pulp.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Seabury Thomson\n\ncopy to J.Q.R.\n\nMay 21, 1971\n\nMr. Charles S.\n\nOffice of Logistics and Supply\n\nDear Mr. S.\n\nHerewith my second report on the\n\nstate of the Agency pollution on the\n\nstream running into the Potomac.\n\nIt is my impression that conditions\n\nhave improved, although the stream\n\nwater is not yet clear in the after­\n\nnoons. At the moment there appears\n\nto be little or none of the Top Secret\n\nPulp flowing down into the river. I\n\ntrust this means that the filter you re­\n\nferred to has been installed. Whether\n\nfrom this filter or from the excessive\n\nrainfall of the past few days, the ef­\n\nfluent coming down the stream is now\n\nonly a pale milky color.\n\nI am delighted with the apparent\n\nimprovement, but the question still re­\n\nmains to bother me. How is it that we\n\nare putting untreated, though filtered,\n\nwaste into the Potomac? If the water\n\nis the rinse from the pulping tanks,\n\nisn’t it still filled with chemicals? And,\n\nif so, aren’t we still engaged in an im­\n\nproper use of the natural stream and\n\nriver?\n\n8\n\nSome of the attractions of commuting by\n\ncanoe—geese, ducks, and occasionally a\n\nblue heron flying heavily along the shore.\n\nI have moved, on assignment.\n\nThough this complicates and lengthens\n\nmy commuting time, I intend to con­\n\ntinue my canoeing to and from work\n\nand will thus be able to keep you in­\n\nformed on the state of the stream\n\nthrough the summer.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Seabury Thomson\n\ncopy to J.Q.R.\n\nMay 28, 1971\n\nMr. Charles S.\n\nOffice of Logistics and Supply\n\nDear Mr. S.\n\nMy report to you last Friday on the\n\npollution problem in the stream flow­\n\ning into the Potomac was overly opti­\n\nmistic. To my regret, I can say only\n\nthat I see little change from the situ­\n\nation before I drew the problem to\n\nyour attention almost a month ago. If\n\na filter has in fact been installed, it\n\nhas made little or no improvement.\n\nFriday afternoon, May 21, the stream\n\nwas as white with pulp as it has been\n\nany time since I started observing it.\n\nAs I was canoeing this section of the\n\nriver on Saturday, I checked it again\n\n—and still the stream ran white. Mon­\n\nday the water was largely clear but\n\nthe stream bed, washed relatively\n\nclean by the earlier rains, was starting\n\nto fill with the Slime I noted earlier. I\n\nmissed on Tuesday since I came to the\n\noffice by car, but on Wednesday in the\n\nmorning the stream was turning milky\n\nagain. In the afternoon it was as thick\n\nas it had been the preceding Friday.\n\nThursday morning and evening the\n\nwater in the stream was relativel;jasg j\n\nclear but at noon, observed from thgts_,\n\nGeorge Washington Memorial Part^^,\n\nway, the stream was filled with t^nn_\n\nwhiteness of the pulp.\n\n-aking\n\nI cannot urge too strongly effectÙNounf\n\naction to stop this unnecessary and iiiear «=\n\nresponsible pollution of the stream bnac ,\n\nthe Agency.

We have not had the reekeiWrrence of the thick white pulp resi>r iiue which was common back in April\n\nISStCTOBER, 1973\n\nbefore I drew this to your attention.\n\nThe environmental conditions within\n\nthe run are not perfect, naturally, but\n\nwe have come a long way toward re­\n\nstoring the natural situation.\n\nYou would probably be interested to\n\nknow that back in the thirties and\n\nearly forties Pulp Run was so pure\n\nthat Sycamore Islanders used to row\n\nacross the river to draw their drinking\n\nwater from the stream. Naturally—\n\nand sadly—we now rely on our own\n\nwell and a chlorinating system instead.\n\nMy silence over these past weeks\n\nhas been caused by a number of differ­\n\nent factors. The most important of\n\nthese has been my sense that every\n\ntime I plan to write a congratulatory\n\nnote to you the stream turns up par-\n\nticularly messy as I pass it on the way\n\nhome! In addition, however, the canoe\n\npool has been disrupted by a number\n\nof things. One member, Joe M., retired\n\nand all of us have had breaks for va­\n\ncation time. Most serious, though, was\n\nthe fact that my canoe was stolen\n\n(Complaint #19,922 to the U.S. Park\n\nPolice!) in the middle of July.\n\nI am back in business again with a\n\nnew canoe—and will be reporting to\n\nyou at odd intervals when there is\n\nsomething to note. In the meantime,\n\nmy thanks to you for the interest and\n\nconcern you have shown for this prob­\n\nlem of pollution.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Seabury Thomson\n\ncopy to J.Q.R.\n\nOctober 1, 1971\n\nMr. Charles S.\n\nOffice of Logistics and Supply\n\nDear Mr. S.\n\nMy reluctance to write you a note\n\nlast week—for fear that it would upset\n\nthe nice balance and start a flow of\n\nwashings from the pulping tank down\n\nthrough the small stream—was justi­\n\nfied. Starting Thursday, September 23,\n\nthe stream has been going from bad to\n\nworse.

A yellowish fungus-like deposit reap­\n\npeared in the stream bed. Earlier such deposits\n\nhad been flushed by the heavy rains this summer.\n\nThe stream ran white in the morning for the first\n\ntime in months. The deposit in the stream bed is\n\ndeeper, and foam floats in the pools. The water\n\ninto the river was extensively discolored.\n\nI fear that there has been a rather\n\nserious slippage on the part of the\n\npulpers from the standards you set. I\n\ntrust you can get them back on the\n\ntrack—because it is a lovely little\n\nstream when it is clear.\n\nI’ll keep my reports flowing to you\n\nthrough the winter—unless you’d pre­\n\nfer I sent them to someone else.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Seabury Thomson\n\ncopy to J.Q.R.\n\n9\n\nDecember 13,19\n\nmwfc.fl\n\nf' '\n\nCanoeing to work introduced John Thomson 43 to the Top Secret Slurry Caper.\n\nor those times when I’ve had to have\n\nthe car at the office.

'regular recently, but I thought things\n\n^ V ere changing. On the 21st the old\n\n^pattern of clear-water mornings and\n\nia^ milky afternoons seemed to hold. On\n\n%he 23rd I wasn’t sure, but I thought it\n\n^isclmight be improving, and on Tuesday,\n\n^°\\he 28th (the next day I could padcan!dle) I was certain that, indeed, someP^thing had changed the quality of the\n\nwater remarkably. It was beautifully\n\nJ0 iclear this morning. It will take a heavy\n\nrainstorm or two to wash out the re3^W ining sediment, but that will come\n\nus\\hortly. I shall now have to think up a\n\n¡more fitting name for our little stream.\n\nw You may be interested in some of\n\nr| uie attractions of commuting by canoe\n\nIItPll •\n\n••\n\n.\n\n#\n\n—m addition to the physical exercise\n\nand the environmental improvement\n\nie^campaign which I enjoy. The spring\n\nwoflowers along the river bank and the\n\nsedstream bed are lovely in April and\n\nuonjgariy May. In the late summer and\n\nns%all we’ve found an abundance of wild\n\nfruit—raspberries, pawpaws, and wild\n\nmonpersimmons—and hickory nuts. Along\n\non (our path up the hill we’ve had the nest\n\nnd’ of a Carolina wren hidden in the roots\n\n3d of a large tree and were able to obiadeserve it from the first egg to a nest full\n\nI k^of ravenous young birds. Flood waters\n\nureaon the river knocked us out of our\n\n’> ^paddling routine for about two weeks\n\nwe so we never saw the young birds take\n\n^^bff and fly. Bird life on the river has\n\n°* included mergansers and Canada\n\ngeese, several varieties of duck and\n\nsmaller water fowl, gulls and two\n\nhor%eautiful blue heron that fly heavily\n\nalong the river shore.\n\nOur concern for the problems of pol­\n\nlution should not blind us to the fact\n\nthat fishing in this area of the Potomac\n\n■J\n\nI ISSbCTOBER, 19 7 3\n\nis quite good and that wildlife is re­\n\nturning. Ten years ago, when three of\n\nus first started canoeing to work, we\n\nonce saw a deer along the shore.\n\nRacoon and muskrat are plentiful and,\n\nI guess, always have been. Recent re­\n\nturnees include both beaver and otter.\n\nThe number of trees felled by beaver\n\non the river islands and the Maryland\n\nshore, and most recently on the Vir­\n\nginia shore is almost alarming. Finally,\n\nthis morning I saw my first beaver\n\nswimming upstream, in the middle of\n\nthe Potomac. As I approached him in\n\nmy canoe, he dove for safety, giving a\n\nsharp smack to the surface of the\n\nwater with his tail. It was about six\n\nweeks ago that I saw my first otter,\n\nalso swimming upstream. He, too, dove\n\nto get away from me, making a sleek\n\narc of brown as he went under.\n\nAlong with these specific attractions,\n\nthe never-ending changes in the at­\n\nmosphere and the weather are a con­\n\ntinuous pleasure—and sometimes a\n\nchallenge. (We drive to work if it is\n\nraining in the morning but, if it rains\n\nin the afternoon, I always try to get\n\nthe canoe back to the safety of Syca­\n\nmore Island. Even in broad daylight\n\nI had one canoe stolen from the Vir­\n\nginia shore where it had been chained\n\nto a tree.) A few days ago when we\n\nhad a particularly heavy fog on the\n\nriver we very nearly paddled in a com­\n\nplete circle—and ultimately made our\n\nway to the proper shore and our\n\nstream-mouth landing by relying on\n\nthe sound of Little Falls Rapids to\n\nguide us. We kept the roar of the\n\nwater to our left as we paddled.\n\nOnce again, my deepest thanks and\n\nwarmest congratulations to you, and to\n\nour Agency, for responding so well to\n\nthis minor aspect of the truly import­\n\nant problem of protecting and improv­\n\ning our environment. It has given me\n\na great deal of faith in our sensitivity\n\nand our willingness to take corrective\n\nactions.\n\nA happy new year to you. Come\n\ndown and visit our stream in 1972. It\n\nis a lovely sight and will now be even\n\nmore beautiful.\n\nVery Sincerely,\n\nJohn Seabury Thomson\n\ncopy to J.Q.R.\n\nTOP TEN\n\nThe Swarthmore College\n\nBulletin was named a Top Ten\n\nAlumni Magazine in national\n\ncompetition sponsored by the\n\nAmerican Alumni Council last\n\nJune. It was the sixth year the\n\nmagazine has been so honored.\n\nThe May, 1972, special issue on\n\npoetry was cited for special\n\nexcellence, and The Chronicle of\n\nHigher Education cited the\n\nmagazine for “superior reporting\n\nof the institutional issues and\n\ninternal problems of higher\n\neducation.” The other Top Ten\n\nalumni periodicals are from\n\nBrown, Cornell (Alumni News\n\nand Engineering: Cornell\n\nQuarterly), Harvard, University\n\nof Massachusetts at Amherst,\n\nUniversity of Missouri, Notre\n\nDame, University of Pennsyl­\n\nvania, and Pomona.\n\nThe College also won a direct\n\nmail award for its annual giving\n\nmailing “Swarthmore still risks\n\neating its own tail.”\n\n11\n\nA\n\nHUNDRED\n\nYEAR\n\nRECKONING\n\nDo the aims for Swarthmore\n\nset forth by the founding Quakers\n\nstill ring true ?\n\n12\n\nDOTO]\n\nS W A R T H M O R E A L U M N I ISS\n\nIn recent years we have marked a\n\nnumber of centennial anniversaries\n\nconnected with the beginnings of\n\nSwarthmore College. In 1964 we cele­\n\nbrated the centennial of the granting\n\nof the College charter. In the fall of\n\n1969, when the present seniors came\n\nas freshmen, President Cross pointed\n\nout that the actual opening of the\n\nCollege occurred one hundred years\n\nbefore, in the fall of 1869. The first\n\ngraduating class was the Class of 1873.\n\nand the first degrees were conferred\n\nin that year. In 1973, it is appropriate\n\nfor us to observe that we have come\n\nto the centennial of that occasion.\n\nThe Class of 1873 had 26 members\n\nwhen they entered as freshmen, but\n\n^ by the time they were seniors there\n\njwere only six. The Class of 1973\n\nnumbered 330 as freshmen, and 294\n\n^received degrees at Commencement in\n\n^ June. It is obvious that far fewer perSS^Jlisted until graduation in the early\n\n^Sftrears and that attrition was much\n\n^higher. Was it easier to flunk out in\n\nj l h e old days and harder to remain for\n\njjpSthe full four years? Have we made the\n\nBjkrequirements for graduation less strinfeent so that many more can remain\n\n(and receive degrees?\n\nLet’s go back even more than one\n\nundred years and look briefly at the\n\n■»«reasons why the College was estabished and at the aims and objectives\n\nf those who established it. To do so\n\ne must go back to the 1850’s when a\n\noup of Quakers in Baltimore began\n\no hold meetings to consider the imgjjprovement of educational opportuni­\n\nt i e s in the Society of Friends. They\n\necided that the chief need was for a\n\n^Jboarding school where young people\n\nould obtain an education beyond the\n\n‘common branches,” and for a college\n\nhere teachers might be trained for\n\nriends schools. Quakers were beginmg to feel the need for secondary\n\nJid higher education and very few\n\nchools which seemed satisfactory\n\nere available to them. The few that\n\nexisted were essentially local and\n\ndrew their students from a limited\n\narea. There was a clear need for an\n\ninstitution of the sort proposed by the\n\nBaltimore Friends, but it soon became\n\nevident that the plan would require\n\nwider support. They enlisted the help,\n\nI IS!\n\nOCTOBER, 1973\n\ntherefore, of similarly minded Friends\n\nin Philadelphia and New York.\n\nA meeting of Friends from the three\n\nYearly Meetings was held in Balti­\n\nmore on October 2, 1860, which re­\n\nsulted in an organization called the\n\nFriends Educational Association and\n\na document called an “Address of\n\nsome Members of the Religious So­\n\nciety of Friends to their fellow mem­\n\nbers proposing the establishment of a\n\nBoarding School for Friends children,\n\nand for the education of teachers.”\n\nIt was signed by 77 Friends from\n\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, and New\n\nYork. They acted as individuals, and\n\nnot as official representatives, and it\n\nwas clear from the beginning that they\n\ndid not intend that the proposed in­\n\nstitution be directly controlled by the\n\nYearly Meetings.\n\nAmong the 77 signers were a num­\n\nber of distinguished persons: In the\n\nBaltimore group were Martha E.\n\nTyson, who had originated the pro­\n\nposal several years before; Benjamin\n\nHallowell, whose scientific interests\n\nhelped to give shape to the proposed\n\ninstitution; and Samuel M. Janney,\n\nan educator and the author of schol­\n\narly books on Quaker history. The\n\nPhiladelphia group included Lucretia\n\nMott, the abolitionist and advocate of\n\nwomen’s rights, and Edward Parrish,\n\nwho later became the first president.\n\nThe New York group included Samuel\n\nWillets, who later became president of\n\nthe Board and whose generous con­\n\ntributions enabled the building fund\n\nto reach its goal. It is perhaps invidi­\n\nous to name these and not others, for\n\none recognizes in the list the names\n\nof many families who have supported\n\nthe College faithfully through several\n\ngenerations.\n\nThe selection of a site for the new\n\ninstitution provoked some controversy\n\nbetween advocates of a city location\n\nand those who favored the country. A\n\nsolution was soon reached, however,\n\nand a farm was purchased some 11\n\nmiles southwest of Philadelphia. A\n\ncharter was applied for and granted by\n\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\n\nBY JOHN M. MOORE\n\nProfessor Emeritus of\n\nPhilosophy and Religion\n\non May 4, 1864. The charter made it\n\nclear that what was intended was no\n\nmere boarding school but an institu­\n\ntion authorized to provide instruction\n\nin the arts and sciences and to grant\n\nthe usual degrees. The name Swarth­\n\nmore College was chosen to com­\n\nmemorate Swarthmoor Hall in the\n\nnorth of England where George Fox\n\nestablished a center of Quaker activity\n\nand found a wife.\n\nPlans were laid and committees ap­\n\npointed to raise the necessary funds.\n\nThe method adopted was the offering\n\nof shares, but it was made clear from\n\nthe start that no profits were to be\n\nexpected. The subscribers or stock­\n\nholders formed the corporation which\n\nelected officers and a Board of Mana­\n\ngers. The Board had responsibility for\n\noverseeing the operation of the Col­\n\nlege and made annual reports to the\n\nCorporation.\n\nOne of the first actions of the Board\n\nwas the naming of Edward Parrish, a\n\npharmaceutical scientist, as the first\n\npresident. The new president took\n\nleave from his business and profes­\n\nsional interests in Philadelphia and\n\nimmediately went to work raising\n\nmoney. An architectural firm was en­\n\ngaged, and plans were drawn for a\n\nbuilding to house the new institution.\n\nThe principal architect was Addison\n\nHutton, a Philadelphia Friend who\n\nlater designed buildings both for Haverford and Bryn Mawr and for Westtown and George School.\n\nThe cornerstone of the building we\n\nknow as Parrish Hall was laid on May\n\n10, 1866, and two important and re­\n\nvealing addresses were delivered: one\n\nby President Parrish and one by Dr.\n\nJoseph Thomas, an editor and author\n\nof Philadelphia. These addresses con­\n\ntain the clearest statements I have\n\nfound of the aims and ideas in the\n\nminds of the persons who established\n\nSwarthmore College.\n\nIn his address President Parrish set\n\nforth four aims for the new College:\n\n(1) coeducation, (2) academic stand­\n\nards equal to those of the best col­\n\nleges, (3) a liberal, balanced curricu­\n\nlum, and (4) a “guarded education”\n\nwhich placed moral values in the high­\n\nest position. It will be instructive to\n\nsee what has happened to these aims\n\n13\n\n“What we Americans have\n\nmost to fear is a dead level\n\nof mediocrity in . . . education”\n\nover the course of a century and\n\nwhether they are relevant to the Col­\n\nlege of today.\n\nFirst, President Parrish said, “We\n\naim to educate the sexes together.”\n\nThis may not sound revolutionary to­\n\nday, but it certainly seemed so at the\n\ntime. Swarthmore was not the first co­\n\neducational college in the United\n\nStates—this honor belongs to Oberlin\n\n—but it was one of the pioneers in\n\nthis field. The idea of coeducation\n\nseemed far more radical in the con­\n\nservative East than in the Middle\n\nWest of that day. It was called “an\n\nimpracticable fancy, born in the rev­\n\nerie of some speculative mind, wellmeaning perhaps but utterly ahead of\n\nsober sense and prudent wisdom . . .\n\nanomalous, absurd.” In recent years\n\nwe have seen a remarkable change of\n\nattitude toward coeducation and a\n\nsudden crumbling of traditional preju­\n\ndices. Institutions such as Princeton\n\nand Yale, long regarded as citadels\n\nof male exclusiveness, have suddenly\n\nopened their doors to women, and\n\nsome of the women’s colleges have an­\n\nnounced their intention to become co­\n\neducational. One cannot help wonder­\n\ning whether what is intended is a\n\nfull equality of the sexes or only a\n\ntoken representation. But perhaps we\n\nshould look about us in our own\n\nhouse before we cast too many stones\n\nin the direction of others. Have we\n\nachieved a full equality of the sexes\n\nwhen only a small number of our fac­\n\nulty are women, or when most offices\n\nin student organizations are regularly\n\nheld by men?\n\nThe second aim was stated by Presi­\n\ndent Parrish in these words: “We shall\n\npropose a high grade of intellectual\n\nattainment for those who seek our\n\ndiploma.” He quoted with approval\n\nthe declaration made in the original\n\nAddress that what was sought was “an\n\ninstitution in which an education\n\ncould be obtained equal to that fur­\n\nnished by the best colleges in the\n\nland.” The faculty must have agreed\n\n14\n\nMartha Tyson, original proposer\n\nwith the President, for when the in­\n\nstitution opened its doors in the fall\n\nof 1869, the incoming students were\n\nrequired to take a series of entrance\n\nexaminations, and on the basis of\n\nthese examinations they were assigned\n\nto their respective classes. Only 26\n\nwere classified as freshmen and none\n\nwas given advanced standing. The\n\nother 173 were assigned to the pre­\n\nparatory department. For seventeen\n\nyears the enrolment in the preparatory\n\ndepartment exceeded that of the col­\n\nlege. As the qualifications of incoming\n\nstudents improved, the more elemen­\n\ntary courses were dropped, but it was\n\nnot until 1894 that the preparatory de­\n\npartment was finally discontinued.\n\nThis was one of the most important\n\npolicy decisions in the history of\n\nSwarthmore College.\n\nThe second speaker at the laying of\n\nthe cornerstone in 1866 was Dr.\n\nJoseph Thomas, an editor and author\n\nconnected with J. B. Lippincott and\n\nCo., the Philadelphia publishers, who\n\nlater became professor of English at\n\nSwarthmore. Dr. Thomas strongly\n\nsupported President Parrish’s demand\n\nfor high academic standards. “In my\n\nopinion,” he said, “what we Americans\n\nhave most to fear, is a dead level of\n\nmediocrity in the education of oiiuniti<\n\npeople. . . . Many persons seem to tydvan\n\nlieve that a moderate education, These\n\njoined with good common sense, Iquali\n\nsufficient for all the purposes of liinust:\n\nIt may be all that is needed for ordequir\n\nnary occasions, but not for the highership\n\nobjects of our existence.”\n\nriandi\n\nThese words might easily have beefonal\n\ntaken as a text by Frank Aydelottrder\n\nthe seventh president, whose adminh a (\n\ntration from 1921 to 1940 saw Swartipecia\n\nmore develop fully into an institutinore\n\nof the highest standards and standiiyell-n\n\nDr. Aydelotte’s greatest monument hese\n\nthe Honors Program which was d Sur<\n\nveloped under his leadership and wiiolleg\n\nstrong faculty support. It is interestiibera]\n\nto note that the first graduates in tit the\n\nHonors Program received their drho b\n\ngrees just fifty years ago, in 192iotiv;\n\nHence as we celebrate the completiim si\n\nof a full century of the history tiing\n\nSwarthmore College as a degree granemoc\n\ning institution, we are also celebratiisrve\n\na half-century of the Honors Program hea\n\nBoth the academic curriculum and tbader\n\nathletic program were completeratia\n\ntransformed under Dr. Aydelotte’hey\n\nleadership, the relationship betwefith t\n\nstudents and faculty was greatly Pt tl\n\ntered, and a marked change took plaeek t\n\nin the nature of student interests aims\n\nactivities. Swarthmore College thenPmpe\n\ntained the position of academic excfays.\n\nlence toward which it had betake\n\npointed from its beginning.\n\n^ le\n\nWe must remind ourselves, hofill b<\n\never, that academic excellence in inict]\n\ninstitution is as difficult to maintain dead\n\nit is to attain in the first place.

In this he was\n\nundoubtedly following his own scien­\n\ntific and practical bent, for he was a\n\nscientist, a professor in the Philadel­\n\nphia College of Pharmacy, and one\n\nwho had taught that subject to medi­\n\ncal students in the University. He was\n\nalso expressing the views of intellec­\n\ntual leaders among the Quaker found­\n\ners of the College, such as Benjamin\n\nHallowell and Lucretia Mott. He did\n\nnot, however, go on to advocate a\n\nprimarily practical curriculum, as\n\nsome elements in the Quaker com­\n\nmunity doubtless hoped he would do.\n\nThe practical elements were recog­\n\nnized in the provisions made for lab­\n\noratory work in the sciences, in the\n\nearly establishment of a department\n\nof engineering, and in the emphasis\n\ngiven to the training of teachers. But\n\nthose who wanted the College to go\n\nmuch further in the direction of prac­\n\ntical training for business and me­\n\nchanical trades were firmly put down.\n\n“It is a false idea of education which\n\nlimits it to any one class of studies\n\nor degrades it to a mere utilitarian\n\nbasis . . .” the President declared. “We\n\nclaim a higher mission for Swarth­\n\nmore College than that of fitting men\n\nand women for business—it should fit\n\nthem for life with all its possibilities.”\n\nPresident Parrish expressed the hope\n\n“that those who shall hereafter guide\n\nits destinies shall be inspired with\n\na love of learning for its own sake,”\n\nand added “may they never cease to\n\ncouple in their systems of training the\n\nhighest intellectual culture with the\n\ndevelopment of the moral and reli­\n\ngious elements of character.” But it is\n\napparent today that the founders of\n\nthe College had certain blind spots:\n\nThey did not see the need of system­\n\natic instruction in what we call the\n\nsocial sciences or in social problems.\n\nThe other blind spot is disclosed by\n\ntheir almost total neglect of the arts.\n\nThe fourth and last of the aims or\n\nobjectives for Swarthmore College out­\n\nlined by President Parrish in 1866\n\nwas a “guarded education,” to use the\n\nterminology preferred by the Quakers\n\nat that time. It is perhaps unfortunate\n\nthat he used an expression which to\n\nus may appear wholly negative. A\n\nguarded education seems to us to be a\n\nmoral equivalent of the ivory tower,\n\nand the viewpoint of the Quaker\n\nfounders undoubtedly had many nega­\n\ntive and restrictive features. In the\n\n18th century Quakers had built a pro­\n\ntective hedge about their sect in an\n\neffort to keep themselves unspotted\n\nfrom the world. Similarly the Quakers\n\nof the 19th century believed that edu­\n\ncation should be carried on in a care­\n\nfully guarded environment. The school\n\nwas to be “a garden enclosed” into\n\nwhich the evils of the world were not\n\nto be permitted to penetrate. This was\n\nwhy the founders located the College\n\nin the country far removed from the\n\nevils and temptations of city life. This\n\nis why they tried to recreate in the\n\ncollege community the value-laden at­\n\nmosphere of a well-regulated family.\n\nThat there were many regulations is\n\nobvious, and many of them seem ab­\n\nsurdly restrictive today. Yet we should\n\nremember that they were dealing at\n\nfirst with a very youthful group, some\n\n15\n\nof whom were only twelve or thirteen\n\nand few of whom were over twenty.\n\nThey were beginning a daring experi­\n\nment in coeducation, and they were\n\nwilling to go to great lengths to make\n\nit succeed. In their zeal for a guarded\n\neducation they even attempted for a\n\ntime to keep books of fiction out of the\n\nlibrary and pianos out of the parlors.\n\nBut these extreme restrictions did not\n\nlast very long.\n\nUnder the dynamic and popular\n\nleadership of President Swain, the\n\nvalue system of the College was very\n\ngreatly changed. The old ideal of a\n\nguarded education was quietly dropped\n\nor transformed into an ideal which\n\ncombined service to society with edu­\n\ncation for successful living. The Col­\n\nlege was still predominantly Quaker,\n\nbut the Quaker community itself was\n\nrapidly losing its sectarian separate­\n\nness and breaking down the hedge\n\nwhich had kept it apart from the\n\nworld. So President Swain led the\n\nCollege into a new era of comparative\n\nprosperity and confidence. The stu­\n\ndents were permitted to develop extra­\n\ncurricular activities on an unprece­\n\ndented scale, and if it seems to us\n\ntoday that they went overboard in\n\ntheir enthusiasm for fraternities and\n\nfootball, we must remember that they\n\nbelieved themselves to be escaping\n\nfrom the trammels of an outmoded\n\npast and enjoying the freedom of a\n\nnew era.\n\nIt should also be remembered that\n\nthe old concept of a guarded education\n\nhas its positive as well as its negative\n\naspects. President Parrish explained it\n\nthus: “It is our desire to give its\n\nproper place to that feature of moral\n\ntraining. . . . which rests upon the\n\nrecognition of the intuitive sense of\n\nright and wrong implanted by the\n\nCreator in every rational soul. . . .\n\nthat free agency which is the high pre­\n\nrogative of our nature.” It is apparent\n\nthat the first president, speaking no\n\ndoubt for an influential and liberal\n\nsegment of the Quaker community,\n\nthought of the moral purpose of the\n\nCollege as something far beyond mere\n\nsectarian interests. He appealed rather\n\nto a general idealism which he be­\n\nlieved would command wide support.\n\n16\n\n“The Friends are not propagan­\n\ndists,” he said. “They have not aimed\n\nto proselyte. They seek here to set up\n\nan institution. . . . in which the incon­\n\nsistency of war with pure Christianity\n\nshall be made a matter of conscien­\n\ntious examination. . . . in which truth\n\nand duty shall be set far above mere\n\nexpediency, and obedience to law be\n\ntaught as limited only by the para­\n\nmount obligations of conscience. . . .\n\nin which the Christian democracy of\n\nthe early Friends shall be maintained.”\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that the found­\n\ners established Swarthmore College on\n\nthe basis of a philosophy which recog­\n\nnized that certain moral values and\n\ncommitments underlie the educational\n\nprocess. They knew what their values\n\nwere and they made their commit­\n\nments openly. They invited others who\n\nshared similar interests and values to\n\ntake part with them in an educational\n\nenterprise in which these values might\n\nbe sought and their applications\n\nworked out in an atmosphere of con­\n\nscientious and responsible freedom.\n\nMost of us would agree that the\n\nfounders of this College were right in\n\ntheir conviction that the aims of edu­\n\ncation are moral as well as intellec­\n\ntual. We too believe that intellectual\n\nfacility without moral integrity is dan­\n\ngerous both to the individual and to\n\nsociety. If our moral insights and\n\ncommitments take forms different from\n\nthose of a century ago, this should\n\nnot be surprising. We have long been\n\naware that\n\nNew occasions teach new duties,\n\nTime makes ancient good uncouth.\n\nA good many of the moral attitudes\n\nand judgments which were unques­\n\ntioned a century ago seem quaint or\n\nabhorrent today, and the rules and\n\nregulations by which they were ex­\n\npressed seem not merely repressive\n\nbut absurd. This distinction is signifi­\n\ncant because it shows that the rejec­\n\ntion of certain beliefs and attitudes\n\ngoes much deeper than just rebellion\n\n—some rebelliousness is to be ex­\n\npected in any society, especially\n\namong the young. A real change in\n\nthe moral climate has taken place.\n\nIt would be quite wrong, however,\n\nto think that here at Swarthmore, at\n\nany rate, there has been any weakei\n\ning of the moral sense or any chani\n\nin the basic conviction that moi\n\nvalues are central to a community!\n\na society. I am convinced that the\n\nis a clear line of continuity in tli\n\nrespect from the early days of tl\n\nCollege to the present. Indeed the\n\nhas been abundant evidence in rece\n\nyears that the strength of moral at\n\ntudes and commitments has be\n\ngrowing rather than diminishing, 'll\n\npresent generation of students mai\n\nfests increasing sensitivity to a wit\n\nrange of issues and values some\n\nwhich were overlooked or ignored evi\n\na short time ago.\n\nCollege life has taken on a m\n\nseriousness in recent years, and 1 1\n\nconvinced that this seriousness is!\n\nmoral phenomenon of great impi\n\ntance. I am not, of course, saying th\n\n“there is no sin £t old Swarthmorf\n\nwhat I am saying is that the moi\n\nsense of the present generation is cle\n\nand keen and that while the spec!\n\nforms of moral concern have shift!\n\nthe capacity for concern is still presei\n\nWe are very conscious of soci\n\nproblems nowadays, and we are i\n\ncreasingly aware that the moral co\n\nponent is of fundamental importai\n\nin all of them.

Swarthmore students re­\n\nturned to campus in early September\n\nto find their traditional Saturday night\n\nsteak dinner had fallen victim to the\n\nbeef shortage. Instead of beefing, how­\n\never, they recognized they had a stake\n\nin the matter so they corralled Ed\n\nMiller, Sharpies Food Service Direc­\n\ntor, who promised to bring those\n\nsteaks back home on the range in midOctober. In the meantime, they would\n\nget roast beef—not a bad substitute.\n\nSAGA, the Swarthmore dining serv­\n\nice, made the front page of the Phoe­\n\nnix in two successive issues as the food\n\nsituation was explained and future\n\nplans to cope with it were announced\n\nby Ed Miller. There will be shortages\n\n—the most severe expected in break­\n\nfast meat, beef, mayonnaise, butter,\n\noleo, perhaps milk and grain products.\n\nThis seems to leave Superbean, as\n\nTime refers to it, as the hoped-forsaviour of the gourmet set. Or, as\n\nSAGA put it in the news release to\n\nthe Phoenix, there will be “high pro­\n\ntein grain additives to select menu\n\nitems,” and the “introduction of nu­\n\ntritionally equivalent menu entrees\n\nwhere substitution by necessity is re­\n\nquired.”\n\nThe once lowly U.S. soybean has\n\nindeed become Superbean, and not\n\nonly at Swarthmore. It is the nation’s\n\nNo. 1 cash crop, most valuable farm\n\nexport (sales abroad exceeded $2 bil­\n\nlion last year), and most volatile and\n\ncontroversial commodity. Soybean oil\n\nis the major ingredient in salad and\n\ncooking oils and margarine. Ground\n\nup, the bean is used as an “extender”\n\nthat stretches out hamburger, ravioli,\n\nand soup. More protein-packed than\n\nfresh red meat, some admirers even\n\nallege that roasted soybeans will in­\n\ncrease sexual vigor.\n\nThe soybean additive that SAGA\n\nproposes as a food supplement is TVP,\n\na textured vegetable protein which con­\n\nsists of soybeans which are defatted\n\nand dehydrated to give a product with\n\nup to 90 per cent protein and the tex­\n\nture of meat.\n\nThe Swarthmore menu can expect\n\nto offer more other vegetables than in\n\nthe past, too, with a possible reduc­\n\ntion in the variety of condiments and\n\nsizes of servings. SAGA has a policy\n\nof unlimited servings of entrees, salads,\n\ndesserts, and beverages, with the ex­\n\nception of Saturday nights when stu­\n\ndents are limited to single servings\n\nof steak, Rock Cornish game hens,\n\nshrimp basket, or other such specials.\n\nThe popularity of vegetarian meals\n\nhas been mixed and only those which\n\nhave been well received will be con­\n\ntinued.\n\nSays Ed Miller: “We are serving\n\nmore fish, eggs, and dishes like cheese\n\nand brown rice casseroles, mushroom\n\nstroganoff over brown rice, and soy­\n\nbean pot pie. Cheese fondues are very\n\npopular and we’ve increased the fre­\n\nquency of yogurt, fresh raw fruits and\n\nvegetables, and we’re serving much\n\nmore skim milk than usual.”\n\nThe current health-food inclination\n\nof young people helps them accept the\n\nnew regimen, and SAGA opened a\n\nFood Information Center this fall in\n\nSharpies Dining Hall to offer fact\n\nsheets and bulletins on its problems.\n\nA SAGA manager is sometimes on\n\nhand to answer questions and accept\n\nsuggestions for improvement of the\n\nfood and service.\n\nConsensus among students is that\n\nSAGA is really trying hard to produce\n\ntasteful and satisfying meals. Joann\n\nBodurtha ’74 says, “Some of their in­\n\nnovations are really great. The alterna­\n\ntive to a salami and cheese sandwich\n\nat lunch today was a cracked wheat\n\nand apricot casserole. Really excel­\n\nlent.”\n\nSAGA’s college division (one of\n\nfive divisions) is nationwide.
