[Thales, 91 - Palaiseau (France)\n\n2009-01-15\n\nThis article presents a short biography of Pauli in which we find the most important facts of his scientific career and some stunning sides of his personality. Pauli was born in 1900 in Vienna in an intellectual family. He was very soon interested in physics. At the age of 21 he published a relevant article on relativity, and the same year he presented a doctorate thesis on the quantum description of the H{sub 2}{sup +} molecular ion. As soon as 1925, Pauli discovered the exclusion principle (for which he will receive the Nobel prize in 1945), and was the first to calculate the energy levels of the hydrogen atom by using the Heisenberg formalism. In 1930, he suggested the existence of an unknown particle (the neutrino) to explain the continuous spectrum of the beta decay. In 1934, he found a link between the spin and the quantum statistics that is now called the spin-statistic theorem. Pauli died in december 1958 from a pancreas tumor.

Wolfgang Pauli's Dialogue with C.G Jung\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nGieser, Suzanne\n\n2005-01-01\n\n\"The Innermost Kernel\" recounts the physicist and Nobel Laureate Wolfgang Pauli and his interest in Jungian psychology, philosophy and western world-view. It is also an exploration of the intellectual setting and context of Pauli's thinking, which has its starting point in the cultural and intellectual climate of fin-de-siÃ¨cle Europe. As a contribution to the general history of quantum physics this study has a special focus on the psychological and philosophical issues discussed by physicists belonging to the Copenhagen school. The work is mainly based on the correspondence of the principle characters and explores some of the central issues discussed there, as for instance the subject-object relation, complementarity, the relation of conscious and unconscious, the process underlying concept-formation, the psychology of scientific discovery, the symbolic world of alchemy, the theories of archetypes and of synchronicity. Ultimately this book is about a remarkable scientist searching for a new understanding of ...\n\nWolfgang Pauli Room\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nBennett, Sophia Elizabeth\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis small but historically valuable collection was donated by Pauliâs widow who, with the help of friends including his former assistants Charles Enz and Victor Weisskopf, gathered together Pauliâs manuscripts and notes, and tracked down originals or copies of his many letters. His correspondence with Bohr, Heisenberg Einstein and others, discussing many of the new ideas in physics, has been published (link) and provides an invaluable resource for those interested in studying the development of 20th century science. Unlike the main CERN Archive, most items in the Pauli collection have been digitised and are available online.\n\nPauli and Jung the meeting of two great minds\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nLindorff, David\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe pioneering work of Nobel prize-winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli led to developing the bombs that decimated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Desperate over this outcome, Pauli sought help from the eminent depth psychologist, C. G. Jung. Their long correspondence provides the powerful and unique record of a mature scientist's inner journey. It also has had a tremendous impact on scientific and psychological thought ever since. Pauli and Jung is a lucid interpretation of Pauli's ideas and dreams that forcefully validates his belief in the inseparable union of science and spirituality. Far ahead of their time, Wolfgang Pauli and C. G. Jung both knew this union is essential for the future of humanity and the survival of the planet.\n\nMind, matter, and Pauli\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStapp, H.P.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe role of subjective experience in physical theory is discussed, with particular attention to the later ideas of Wolfgang Pauli.

Pauli's vision it would appear, has not been widely shared, outside of the realms of popular science. It is not surprising that someone of Pauli's persuasion, like Laurikainen, should regard this neglect as the result of a conspiracy. In a more dispassionate light, it is appropriate to take Pauli's radical proposals as a measure of the profound sense of wonder he felt at the strange, shadowy world of the quantum where classical certitudes desert us. In attempting to delineate a metaphysics radically different from that underlying classical physics, Pauli took on a conceptual challenge of immense magnitude. This enterprise itself, regardless of its success or failure, offers testimony of Pauli's stature as a philosopher-physicist.

Jung provided an extensive analysis of Pauli's dreams, which are contained in the lightly edited, unpublished transcripts of lectures delivered in 1936 and 1937. An archival and hermeneutic analysis of the texts reveals a staged process of individuation that Jung related to in many ways because of the parallels to his own personal journey toward individuation. A chronological history of the development of Jung's dream theory is presented, followed by a picture of the relationship between Jung and Pauli. Thereafter, a detailed summary of the seminar transcripts, one given on Bailey Island, Maine, and the other in New York City the following year, is offered with hermeneutic commentary. An analysis of the seminars found that Pauli's dreams did, in part, support Jung's theory. Specifically, while Jung was unable to meet the scientific demands for clear empirical evidence of his dream theory, he did offer his professional and non-professional audiences with a slightly less rigorous example of his dream theory in action, demonstrating that the process shared similarities across peoples, time, and cultures. Additionally, in Pauli he found a superior mind that had gone through the process of individuation in accordance with his theory and his own experience. During the course of research, reference to a document was found in the correspondence in the Jungian Archives in Zurich. This document entitled, \"FAREWELL SPEECH, Given by Dr. C. G. Jung on the Occasion of a Dinner Given in His Honor by the Analytical Psychology Club of New York City October 26, 1937\" and other related documents were subsequently uncovered in the sub-basement of the Kristine Mann Library in New York City.

Thus bloomed an extraordinary intellectual conjunction. Eighty letters, written over twenty-six years, record that friendship, and are published here in English for the first time.Through the association of these two pioneering thinkers, developments in physics profoundly influenced the evolution of Jungian psychology. And many of Jung's abiding themes shaped how Pauli - and, through him, other physicists - understood the physical world. Atom and Archetype will appeal not only to those interested in the life of Pauli or Jung, but also to the educated general reader.\n\nStanding together in troubled times unpublished letters by Pauli, Einstein, Franck and others\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis captivating book is a story of the friendship between a genius physicist Wolfgang Pauli and Charlotte Houtermans whose career in physics was not as glamorous. They met in the late 1920s in Germany, at the very onset of the quantum era and personally knew all the major players in the emergent quantum world that was very much part of central Europe: Germany, Austria, Hungary, Denmark and Switzerland. And Charlotte was a student at GÃ¶ttingen that was right at the heart.Caught between two evils â Soviet Communism and German National Socialism â she would have probably perished if it were not for the brotherhood of physicists: Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli, Albert Einstein, James Franck, Max Born, Robert Oppenheimer and many other noted scientists who tried to save friends and colleagues (either leftist sympathizers or Jews) who were in mortal danger of being entrapped in a simmering pre-WWII Europe.Using newly discovered documents from the Houtermans family archive: twenty three Pauli's letters to Charlott...\n\nSynchronicity - The Link Between Physics and Psyche, from Pauli and Jung to Chopra\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTeodorani, M.\n\n2006-07-01\n\nThis book, which is entirely dedicated to the mystery of \"synchronicity\", is divided into three parts: a) the joint research between analytic psychologist Carl Gustav Jung and quantum physicist Wolfgang Pauli; b) synchronicity mechanisms occurring in the microscopic (canonical quantum entanglement), mesoscopic and macroscopic scales; c) research and philosophy concerning synchronicity by MD Deepak Chopra.\n\nZweideutigkeit about \"Zweideutigkeit\": Sommerfeld, Pauli, and the methodological origins of quantum mechanics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSeth, Suman\n\nIn early 1925, Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) published the paper for which he is now most famous and for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1945. The paper detailed what we now know as his \"exclusion principle.\" This essay situates the work leading up to Pauli's principle within the traditions of the \"Sommerfeld School,\" led by Munich University's renowned theorist and teacher, Arnold Sommerfeld (1868-1951). Offering a substantial corrective to previous accounts of the birth of quantum mechanics, which have tended to sideline Sommerfeld's work, it is suggested here that both the method and the content of Pauli's paper drew substantially on the work of the Sommerfeld School in the early 1920s. Part One describes Sommerfeld's turn away from a faith in the power of model-based (modellmÃ¤ssig) methods in his early career towards the use of a more phenomenological emphasis on empirical regularities (GesetzmÃ¤ssigkeiten) during precisely the period that both Pauli and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), among others, were his students. Part two delineates the importance of Sommerfeld's phenomenology to Pauli's methods in the exclusion principle paper, a paper that also eschewed modellmÃ¤ssig approaches in favour of a stress on GesetzmÃ¤ssigkeiten. In terms of content, a focus on Sommerfeld's work reveals the roots of Pauli's understanding of the fundamental Zweideutigkeit (ambiguity) involving the quantum number of electrons within the atom. The conclusion points to the significance of these results to an improved historical understanding of the origin of aspects of Heisenberg's 1925 paper on the \"Quantum-theoretical Reformulation (Umdeutung) of Kinematical and Mechanical Relations.\"\n\nApplication of photon detectors in the VIP2 experiment to test the Pauli Exclusion Principle\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPichler, A; Bazzi, M.; Bertolucci, S.; Berucci, C.; Bragadireanu, M.; Cargnelli, M.; Clozza, A.; Curceanu, C.; De Paolis, L.; Di Matteo, S.; D'Ufflzi, A.; Egger, J.P.; Guaraldo, C.; Iliescu, M.; Ishiwatari, T.; Laubenstein, M.; Marton, J.; Milotti, E.; Pietreanu, D.; Piscicchia, K.; Ponta, T.; Sbardella, E.; Scordo, A.; Shi, H.; Sirghi, D.; Sirghi, F.; Sperandio, L.; Vazquez-Doce, O.; Widmann, E.; Zmeskal, J.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) was introduced by the austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925. Since then, several experiments have checked its validity. From 2006 until 2010, the VIP (VIolation of the Pauli Principle) experiment took data at the LNGS underground laboratory to test the PEP. This experiment looked for electronic 2p to 1s transitions in copper, where 2 electrons are in the 1s state before the transition happens. These transitions violate the PEP. The lack of detection of X-ray photons coming from these transitions resulted in a preliminary upper limit for the violation of the PEP of $4.7 \\\\times 10^{-29}$. Currently, the successor experiment VIP2 is under preparation. The main improvements are, on one side, the use of Silicon Drift Detectors (SDDs) as X-ray photon detectors. On the other side an active shielding is implemented, which consists of plastic scintillator bars read by Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The employment of these detectors will improve the upper limit for the violati...\n\nWolfgang Schnell (1929 - 2006)\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWolfgang Schnell in 2004, displaying a piece of equipment for the CLIC test facility. Wolfgang Schnell passed away on 2nd October after an illness which he endured with great courage and lucidity. Wolfgang was one of CERN's pioneers and made numerous significant contributions to the field of accelerator physics and technology throughout his career. After obtaining a degree in physics from the University of Heidelberg, he worked at the Max-Planck Institute, before joining the PS construction team in 1954. When working in the group led by Chris Schmelzer in 1959, he achieved a breakthrough during the running-in of the PS, which suffered from substantial beam loss during acceleration. With the phase-lock feed-back system built by Wolfgang, the beam went immediately to 24 GeV with hardly any losses. He was proud to show later that the electronics of his system had been built inside a coffee tin.

As a result, we obtain the 11 classes of vector-potentials of the electro-magnetic field A(t,x(vector sign))=(A 0 (t,x(vector sign)), A(vector sign)(t,x(vector sign))) providing separability of the corresponding Pauli equations. It is established, in particular, that the necessary condition for the Pauli equation to be separable into second-order matrix ordinary differential equations is its equivalence to the system of two uncoupled Schroedinger equations. In addition, the magnetic field has to be independent of spatial variables. We prove that coordinate systems and the vector-potentials of the electro-magnetic field providing the separability of the corresponding Pauli equations coincide with those for the Schroedinger equations. Furthermore, an efficient algorithm for constructing all coordinate systems providing the separability of Pauli equation with a fixed vector-potential of the electro-magnetic field is developed. Finally, we describe all vector-potentials A(t,x(vector sign)) that (a) provide the separability of Pauli equation, (b) satisfy vacuum Maxwell equations without currents, and (c) describe non-zero magnetic field\n\nMr. Wolfgang Petritsch, Austrian Ambassador\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nPatrice LoÃ¯ez\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDr.Peter Schmid/CERN/EP, Dr.Wolfgang Petritsch, Austrian Ambassador, Permanent representative at UN, Mrs.Nora Petritsch, Dr.Kurt Hubner/CERN/AC, Mrs. Frederike Klaus-Salesin, Adviser, Mrs.Andrea Strohmeier, Secretary of the Ambassador, Mr.Heinz Klaus, AttachÃ©, Dr.Theodor Tortschanoff/CERN/LHC, Mr.Peter Storer, Advisor.

Cherrington, Jr., a long-time member of the AAS, died in San Jose, California on 13 July 1996, following a long illness. He had a short but active career as a research astronomer at Perkins Observatory at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio before World War II, in which he served as an officer in the Army Air Force. After the war ended he turned to full-time teaching and administration at the University of Akron, and then at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland. Ernest was born on 10 September 1909 in Westerville, Ohio, where his father, Ernest H. Cherrington, Sr., was a leader in the temperance movement and publisher of \"American Issue\", a Prohibitionist magazine. Ernest Jr.'s mother, Betty Clifford (nÃ©e Denny) Cherrington, was a homemaker. He was an outstanding student in high school and at Ohio Wesleyan University, which he entered in 1927. The little university's Perkins Observatory with its 69-inch reflector, briefly the second largest telescope in the United States, had just been built and gone into operation. After graduating with a BA magna cum laude in astronomy in 1931, Ernest stayed on one more year and earned his MS with a thesis on the motion of material in the tail of Comet Morehouse, supervised by Nicholas T. Bobrovnikoff. In 1932 Ernest entered the University of California at Berkeley as a graduate student, with a one-year teaching assistantship in the Astronomical Department. This was followed by a two-year Lick Observatory Fellowship. In June 1933 he married Ann McAfee Naylor, who had been a classmate at Delaware High School and Ohio Wesleyan. Ernest did his PhD thesis on spectrophotometry of the Mg I b lines in the solar spectrum, using a high-resolution grating spectrograph on the Berkeley campus, designed by C. Donald Shane, his adviser. In this thesis, Ernest tested and improved the then current theory of strong absorption lines in stellar atmospheres.

As an experimentalist I am not sufficiently knowledgeable to evaluate his contributions to theoretical physics - this will certainly be done by more competent scientists. Nevertheless I admired him for not only being attached to fundamental and abstract problems like quantum field theory, quantum gravity or black holes, but for his interest in down to earth questions like electron-proton scattering or the toponium mass. I got to know Wolfgang Kummer very well and appreciate his human qualities during his long attachment to CERN, in particular when he served as president of the CERN Council, the highest decision taking authority of this international research centre, from 1985 to 1987 falling into my term as Director-Generalâ¦\n\nProfessor Wolfgang Panofsky\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2007-01-01\n\n\"Professor Wolfgang panofsky, who died on September 24 aged 88, was a particle physicists and director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC) in California; with Jack Steinberger, he was the first to isolate the neutral pi meson, one of the subatomic particles which had been predicted by theoretical scientists to account for the strng force which binds the nuclei of atoms.\" (1 page)\n\nErnest Rutherford: scientist supreme\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCampbell, J.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, Ernest Rutherford a talented young New Zealander who had just spent three years as a postgraduate student in Britain left for Canada, where he was to do the work that won him a Nobel prize. All three countries can justifiably claim this great scientist as their own. Ernest Rutherford is one of the most illustrious scientists that the world has ever seen. He achieved enduring international fame because of an incredibly productive life, during which he altered our view of nature on three separate occasions. Combining brilliantly conceived experiments with much hard work and special insight, he explained the perplexing problem of naturally occurring radioactivity, determined the structure of the atom, and was the world's first successful alchemist, changing nitrogen into oxygen. Rutherford received a Nobel prize for the first discovery, but the other two would have been equally worthy candidates, had they been discovered by someone else. Indeed, any one of his other secondary achievements many of which are now almost forgotten would have been enough to bring fame to a lesser scientist. For example, he invented an electrical method for detecting individual ionizing radiations, he dated the age of the Earth, and briefly held the world record for the distance over which wireless waves could be detected. He predicted the existence of neutrons, he oversaw the development of large-scale particle accelerators, and, during the First World War, he led the allied research into the detection of submarines.

A simple algebra is constructed for the creation-annihilation operators, which contains a parameter Î² and describe small violation of the Pauli principle (the Pauli principle is valid exactly for Î²=0). The commutation relations in this algebra are trilinear. A model is presented, basing upon this commutator algebra, which allows transitions violating the Pauli principle, their probability being suppressed by a factor of Î² 2 (even though the Hamiltonian does not contain small parameters)\n\nPauli-Guersey symmetry in gauge theories\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nStern, J.\n\n1983-05-01\n\nGauge theories with massless or massive fermions in a selfcontragredient representation exhibit global symmetries of Pauli-Guersey type. Some of them are broken spontaneously leading to a difermion Goldstone bosons. An example of a boson version of the Pauli-Guersey symmetry is provided by the Weinberg-Salam model in the limit THETAsub(w)âO\n\nNon Pauli-Fierz Massive Gravitons\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nDvali, Gia; Redi, Michele\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe study general Lorentz invariant theories of massive gravitons. We show that, contrary to the standard lore, there exist consistent theories where the graviton mass term violates Pauli-Fierz structure. For theories where the graviton is a resonance this does not imply the existence of a scalar ghost if the deviation from Pauli-Fierz becomes sufficiently small at high energies. These types of mass terms are required by any consistent realization of the DGP model in higher dimension.\n\nPortrait of Gunnar KÃ¤llÃ©n a physics shooting star and poet of early quantum field theory\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWolfgang Pauli referred to him as 'my discovery,' Robert Oppenheimer described him as 'one of the most gifted theorists' and Niels Bohr found him enormously stimulating. Who was the man in question, Gunnar KÃ¤llÃ©n (1926-1968)? His appearance in the physics sky was like a shooting star. His contributions to the scientific debate caused excitement among young and old. Similar to his friend and mentor, Wolfgang Pauli, he demanded honesty and rigor in physics - a distinct dividing line between fact and speculation. In his obituary, Arthur S. Wightman would write: 'Gunnar KÃ¤llÃ©n was a proud continuer of the tradition in quantum field theory established by Wolfgang Pauli. His papers on quantum electrodynamics in the period 1950-1954 carried the non-perturbative approach to quantum electrodynamics forward to a point beyond which very little essential progress has been made up to the present day. At the time I was trying to puzzle out the grammar of the language of quantum field theory, and here was KÃ¤llÃ©n al...\n\nNon-Pauli-Fierz Massive Gravitons\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDvali, Gia; Pujolas, Oriol; Redi, Michele\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe study general Lorentz invariant theories of massive gravitons.

A simple algebra of creation and annihilation operators is constructed which contains a parameter Î² and describes a weak violation of the Pauli principle (when Î² = 0 the Pauli principle is satisfied exactly). The commutation relations in this algebra turn out to be trilinear. A model based on this algebra is described. It allows transitions in which the Pauli principle is violated, but the probability of these transitions is suppressed by the quantity Î² 2 (even though the interaction Hamiltonian does not contain small parameters)\n\nDouble-folding model including the Pauli exclusion principle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGridnev, K.A.; Soubbotin, V.B.; Oertzen, W. von; Bohlen, H.G.; Vinas, X.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nA new method for incorporating the Pauli exclusion principle into the double-folding approach to the heavy-ion potential is proposed. The description of the exchange terms at the level of the semiclassical one-body density matrix is used. It is shown that, in order to take into account Pauli blocking properly, the density matrices of free isolated nuclei must be redefined. A solution to the self-consistent incorporation of Pauli blocking effects in the mean-field nucleus-nucleus potential is obtained in the Thomas-Fermi approximation\n\nStanley Fish, Chi ha paura di Wolfgang Iser?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLaura Massari\n\n2011-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Presentiamo qui la traduzione del saggio di Stanley Fish, Why no oneâsafraid of Wolfgang Iser, pubblicato nel numero di Marzo 1981 della rivista Diacritics.

Yet the experiment shows that many fundamental laws are in fact not absolute, but only approximate, i.e. are valid only to a certain accuracy. At present, however, there are no answers to the question: ''To what accuracy is the Pauli principle valid?'' This is so because there are no models capable of describing small deviations from the exclusion principle. In the present paper we consider the problem of constructing such models. We have constructed the simplest algebra of the creation and annihilation operators with a parameter Î² which incorporates the small violations of the Pauli principle (for Î²=0 the Pauli principle holds absolutely true). The commutation relations in this model prove to be trilinear. We then present a model Hamiltonian based on the constructed algebra which describes the Pauli principle violating transitions i.e. transitions of two identical particles into the same state with the probability suppressed by a factor of Î² 2 (notwithstanding the fact that the Hamiltonian itself does not contain any small parameters). (author). 8 refs\n\nThe Pauli Objection\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeon, Juan; Maccone, Lorenzo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSchrÃ¶dinger's equation says that the Hamiltonian is the generator of time translations. This seems to imply that any reasonable definition of time operator must be conjugate to the Hamiltonian. Then both time and energy must have the same spectrum since conjugate operators are unitarily equivalent. Clearly this is not always true: normal Hamiltonians have lower bounded spectrum and often only have discrete eigenvalues, whereas we typically desire that time can take any real value. Pauli concluded that constructing a general a time operator is impossible (although clearly it can be done in specific cases). Here we show how the Pauli argument fails when one uses an external system (a \"clock\") to track time, so that time arises as correlations between the system and the clock (conditional probability amplitudes framework). In this case, the time operator is conjugate to the clock Hamiltonian and not to the system Hamiltonian, but its eigenvalues still satisfy the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for arbitrary system Hamiltonians.\n\n[Jan Fryderyk Wolfgang's autobiography (1850) in the light of hand-written and printed sources].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKuÅºnicka, B\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe archival collection of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in Vilnius (Wilno) contains many manuscripts relating to the scientific work of Jan Fryderyk Wolfgang (1776-1859), professor of pharmacy and pharmacology of the Wilno University in the years 1807-1831, the founder and main figure in the Wilno pharmacognostic school, a botanist with substantial achievements in wide-ranging research on the flora of the Wilno region, as well as a historian of pharmacy. The most interesting of the manuscripts include Wolfgang's Autobiografia [Autobiography], written in 1850, and a list of his publications covering a total of 57 items (including some that have hitherto remained unknown), a work entitled Historya Farmakologii i Farmacyi [History of pharmacology and pharmacy], and a particularly valuable manuscript (666 + 12 sheets) entitled Farmakologiia [Pharmacology]. Worth mentioning are also two catalogues of books from Wolfgang's library: one compiled by Wolfgang himself (37 sheets) and the other by Adam Ferdynand Adamowicz. The content of the autobiography manuscript is contained on five sheets. The author of the present article analyzes the document, comparing the information contained in it with the biographies of J. F. Wolfgang that hhave been published so far (these being primarily the biography by Dominik Cezary ChodYko, published in 1863, and that by Witold W3odzimierz G3owacki of 1960). The text of the autobiography is quoted in full, together with numerous comments. The analysis of the manuscript as well as the biographical data contained in the above-mentioned biographies indicate that Wolfgang had great achievements as a scientist (in both research and organizational work), as a champion of public causes and as an educator of a generation of botanists-pharmacognostics. It also transpires from the autobiography, as well as from the research by historians, that he was a very good and trustful person, who readily granted access to his research to his collaborators\n\nReader-Response Theory: A Path Towards Wolfgang Iser (La teorÃ­a de la recepciÃ³n: una ruta hacia Wolfgang Iser\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlejandra Giangiulio Lobo\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Se estudia la teorÃ­a de la recepciÃ³n a partir de diferentes autores y crÃ­ticos literarios, para caracterizar los distintos tipos de lectores, segÃºn cada aproximaciÃ³n y los procesos de lectura y creaciÃ³n de significado.

We know that this principle is extremely well fulfilled due to many observations. Numerous experiments were performed to search for tiny violation of this rule in various systems. The experiment VIP at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory is searching for possible small violations of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for electrons leading to forbidden X-ray transitions in copper atoms. VIP is aiming at a test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for electrons with high accuracy, down to the level of 10 â29 â 10 â30 , thus improving the previous limit by 3â4 orders of magnitude. The experimental method, results obtained so far and new developments within VIP2 (follow-up experiment at Gran Sasso, in preparation) to further increase the precision by 2 orders of magnitude will be presented\n\nPauli-Villars regularization in nonperturbative Hamiltonian approach on the light front\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMalyshev, M. Yu., E-mail: mimalysh@yandex.ru; Paston, S. A.; Prokhvatilov, E. V.; Zubov, R. A.; Franke, V. A. [Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg (Russian Federation)\n\n2016-01-22\n\nThe advantage of Pauli-Villars regularization in quantum field theory quantized on the light front is explained. Simple examples of scalar Î»Ï{sup 4} field theory and Yukawa-type model are used. We give also an example of nonperturbative calculation in the theory with Pauli-Villars fields, using for that a model of anharmonic oscillator modified by inclusion of ghost variables playing the role similar to Pauli-Villars fields.\n\nThe Telephone Connection: An Interview with Ernest Hemingway's Son.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWorkman, Brooke\n\n1979-01-01\n\nRelates how a conference call to Ernest Hemingway's son, Gregory, resolved questions and brought understanding and excitement to a group of Iowa high school students enrolled in a 12-week Hemingway seminar. (FL)\n\nThe Strange Friendship of Pauli and Jung - When Physics Met Psychology\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN. Geneva\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAt a key time in his scientific development, Pauli was undergoing analysis by Jung. What can we learn about Pauli's discoveries of the exclusion principle and the CPT theorem, as well as his thoughts on non-conservation of parity, and his quest with Heisenberg for a unified field theory of elementary particles from Jungâs analysis of his dreams? A very different Pauli emerges, one at odds with esteemed colleagues such as Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg.\n\nEffect of the Pauli principle in elastic scattering\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPicklesimer, A.; Thaler, R.M.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe effect of imposition of the Pauli principle for two-fragment elastic nuclear scattering is examined. It is shown that the antisymmetrized problem can be cast into the Lippmann-Schwinger form with an effective interaction in which the effect of the Pauli principle is entirely absorbed into the effective interaction potential operator. This result enables the formalism to be developed in analogy with the unsymmetrized formulation. Central to the approach is the choice of the off-shell extension of the transition operator. Comparison is made with a previously proposed treatment based on a different off-shell extension. It is shown that both the antisymmetrized transition operator and the associated optical potential proposed herein are readily expressed as spectator expansions in which the effect of the Pauli principle among the active fermions is incorporated in a physically appealing fashion at each stage of the expansion\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle origin, verifications and applications\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKaplan, Ilya G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis is the first scientific book devoted to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics and is permanently applied in chemistry, physics, molecular biology and in physical astronomy. However, while the principle has been studied for more than 90 years, rigorous theoretical foundations still have not been established and many unsolved problems remain. Following an introduction and historical survey, this book discusses the still unresolved questions around this fundamental principle. For instance, why, according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, are only symmetric and antisymmetric permutation symmetries for identical particles realized, while the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is satisfied by functions with any permutation symmetry? Chapter 3 covers possible answers to this, while chapter 4 presents effective and elegant methods for finding the Pauli-allowed states in atomic, molecular and nuclear spectroscopy. Chapter 5 discusses parastatistics and fractional statistics, dem...\n\nThe Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: An Epidemiologic Perspective\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nZegers, Richard H.

It is shown that the Pauli principle influences considerably the position and structure of a few low-lying states. The fragmentation of one-quasiparticle states at intermediate and high excitation energies is slightly affected by the Pauli principle, and the calculations can be performed by taking the Pauli principle into account roughly.

We show that the CCR representations obtained from the asymptotic field contain so-called {\\\\em coherent sectors} describing an infinite number of asymptotically free bosons. We formulate some conjectures leading to mathematically well defined notion of {\\\\em inclusive and non-inclusive scattering cross-sections} for Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonians. Finally we give a general description of the scattering theory of QFT models in the presence of coherent sectors for the asymptotic CCR representations.\n\nNucleon effective mass effects on the Pauli-blocking function\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPina, S.R. de; Mesa, J.; Deppman, A.; Arruda-Neto, J.D.T.; Duarte, S.B.; Oliveira, E.C. de; Tavares, O.A.P.; Medeiros, E.L.; Goncalves, M.; Paiva, E. de\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe effects of nucleon effective mass on the Pauli-blocking function are worked out.

This article deploys reception studies as a branch of Comparative Literature with a focus upon conceptions of Siegbert Salomon Prawer and the practical method of George Asselineau to unearth the ideological, political, and historical milieu that embraced Hemingwayâs literary fortune in Iran. This investigation, unprecedented in the study of Iranian literature, discusses how and why Hemingway was initially received in Iran. As such, the inception of literary fortune of Ernest Hemingway in Iran is examined by the contextual features, Persian literary taste, and the translatorâs incentives that paved the way for this reception. This article also uncovers the reasons for the delay in the literary reception of Hemingway in Iran and discussed why some of Hemingwayâs oeuvres enjoyed recognition while others were neglected by the Iranian readership.\n\nThe influence of Pauli blocking effects on the properties of dense hydrogen\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEbeling, W; Blaschke, D; Redmer, R; Reinholz, H; Roepke, G\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe investigate the effects of Pauli blocking on the properties of hydrogen at high pressures, where recent experiments have shown a transition from insulating behavior to metal-like conductivity. Since the Pauli principle prevents multiple occupation of electron states (Pauli blocking), atomic states disintegrate subsequently at high densities (Mott effect). We calculate the energy shifts due to Pauli blocking and discuss the Mott effect solving an effective Schroedinger equation for strongly correlated systems. The ionization equilibrium is treated on the basis of a chemical approach. Results for the ionization equilibrium and the pressure in the region 4000 K < T < 20 000 K are presented. We show that the transition to a highly conducting state is softer than found in earlier work. A first-order phase transition is observed at T < 6450 K, but a diffuse transition appears still up to 20 000 K\n\nLEP Celebration : Groupe de Jazz \"Wolfgang & The Werewolves\"\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN.

I suggest that small violations can occur in our four-dimensional world as a consequence of the compactification of a higher-dimensional theory in which the exclusion principle is exactly valid. I briefly mention a recent experiment which places a severe limit on possible violations of the exclusion principle.

When the Pauli principle is neglected for collisions between heavy nuclei, calculation of the optical phase-shift function leads to non-unitary results and cross sections cannot be obtained. When Pauli correlations are included important cancellations in the optical phase-shift function are found which make possible the calculation of total and differential cross sections for heavy nuclei.

Two methods for evaluating the quantum capacity of the memory Pauli channels are proposed to try to trace the memory effect on the transmissions of quantum information. We show that the evaluation of quantum capacity can be reduced to the calculation of the initial memory state of each successive transmission. Furthermore, we derive quantum capacities of the memory phase flip channel, bit flip channel and bit-phase flip channel. Also, a lower bound of the quantum capacity of the memory depolarizing channel is obtained. An increase of the degree of memory of the channels has a positive effect on the increase of their quantum capacities.\n\nViolations of the Pauli principle and the interior of the sun\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPlaga, R.\n\n1989-08-01\n\nThe consequences of a violation of the Pauli principle for the physics of the solar interior are explored. It is found that a bound state of two protons becomes possible. This leads to an increase in the rate of hydrogen burning in the sun. Because a very large cross section for this reaction is in clear contradiction with the theory of stellar structure when compared with observations of solar luminosity, radius and mechanical oscillations, stringent limits on a violation of the Pauli principle in the two nucleon system can be given. However, a very small violation of the Pauli principle in the two nucleon system might solve the longstanding solar neutrino problem.

According to many observations the Pauli Exclusion Principle must be extremely well fulfilled. Nevertheless, numerous experimental investigations were performed to search for a small violation of this principle. The VIP experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory searched for Pauli-forbidden X-ray transitions in copper atoms using the Ramberg-Snow method and obtained the best limit so far. The follow-up experiment VIP2 is designed to reach even higher sensitivity. It aims to improve the limit by VIP by orders of magnitude. The experimental method, comparison of different PEP tests based on different assumptions and the developments for VIP2 are presented.\n\nTaking into account of the Pauli principle in the quasiparticle-phonon nuclear model\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSolov'ev, V.G.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nThe effect of an exact account taken of the Pauli principle and correlations in ground states in calculations in the framework of the quasiparticle-phonon model of a nucleus has been studied. It is elucidated when it is possible to use the random phase approximation (RPA) and when the Pauli principle should be exactly taken into account. It has been shown that in the quasiparticle-phonon model of a nucleus one may perform calculations with a precise account of the Pauli principle.

A unitarity pole approximation is used for the nucleon-core interaction. Calculations are presented for the Ï- 4 He elastic scattering cross sections at energies below the inelastic threshold and for the real part of the Ï- 4 He scattering length by solving the three-body equations. Off-shell kinematics and the Pauli principle are carefully taken into account. The binding correction and the Pauli principle correction each have an important effect on the differential cross sections and the scattering length. However, large cancellations occur between these two effects. I find an increase in the Ï- 4 He scattering length by 100%; an increase in the cross sections by 20-30% and shift of the minimum in Ï - - 4 He scattering to forward angles by 10 0 .

However, a thorough biopsychosocial approach capable of integrating the various threads of the author's complex psychiatric picture has yet to be applied. Application of such a psychiatric view to the case of Ernest Hemingway in an effort toward better understanding of the author's experience with illness and the tragic outcome is the aim of this investigation. Thus, Hemingway's life is examined through a review and discussion of biographies, psychiatric literature, personal correspondence, photography, and medical records. Significant evidence exists to support the diagnoses of bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence, traumatic brain injury, and probable borderline and narcissistic personality traits. Late in life, Hemingway also developed symptoms of psychosis likely related to his underlying affective illness and superimposed alcoholism and traumatic brain injury. Hemingway utilized a variety of defense mechanisms, including self-medication with alcohol, a lifestyle of aggressive, risk-taking sportsmanship, and writing, in order to cope with the suffering caused by the complex comorbidity of his interrelated psychiatric disorders. Ultimately, Hemingway's defense mechanisms failed, overwhelmed by the burden of his complex comorbid illness, resulting in his suicide. However, despite suffering from multiple psychiatric disorders, Hemingway was able to live a vibrant life until the age of 61 and within that time contribute immortal works of fiction to the literary canon.\n\nTreatment of orofacial pain in patients with stylomandibular ligament syndrome (Ernest Syndrome).\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPeÃ±arrocha-Oltra, D; Ata-Ali, J; Ata-Ali, F; PeÃ±arrocha-Diago, M A; PeÃ±arrocha, M\n\n2013-06-01\n\nErnest syndrome involves the stylomandibular ligament. It is characterised by pain in the preauricular area and mandibular angle, radiating to the neck, shoulder, and eye on the same side, and associated with pain during palpation of that ligament. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and course of the disease in a series of patients with Ernest syndrome. Retrospective observational study covering the period from 1998 to 2008. We recorded patients' age, sex, duration of the disorder, and pain characteristics. All patients were injected with 40mg triamcinolone acetonide at the mandibular insertion of the stylomandibular ligament. The study included a total of 6 patients. Mean age was 40.3 years (range, 35-51). All of the subjects were women. Four patients had undergone lengthy dental treatments in the month prior to onset of the pain. The mean time between pain onset and first consultation was 23 months. The syndrome resolved completely in all cases after treatment, with a minimum follow-up period of 12 months. We analysed the clinical characteristics, treatment, and course of disease in 6 patients with Ernest syndrome. Correct diagnosis is the key to being able to provide proper treatment. This disorder is sometimes confused with other types of orofacial pain, and may therefore be more prevalent than the literature would indicate. Copyright Â© 2012 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de NeurologÃ­a.

Medical treatment of Wolfgang as a child by his father Leopold Mozart].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBankl, H C; Reiter, C; Bankl, H\n\n2001-12-17\n\nLeopold Mozart (1719-1787), father of Wolfgang AmadÃ©, had profound medical knowledge and was a passionate medical dilettante. As long as the young Mozart lived with his father and travelled on his concert tours with him, Leopold cared for his son in medical matters. Doctors were only consulted occasionally. In the extensive correspondence of Mozart's father drugs and treatments used for Wolfgang AmadÃ© are reported in detail. This represents a reliable description of the pharmacological therapies of the late 18th century. The mentioned drugs are, as far as possible, viewed from todays medical perspective.\n\nOn the checking of electric charge conservation law and the pauli principle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOkun', L.B.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThis is a short critical review of the attempts to check the accuracy with which are carried out in experiment the electric charge conservation law and the Pauli principle. The absence of the inwardly noncontradictory phenomenological theory is emphasized, which could describe the charge conservation and/or the Pauli principle violation. Under charge nonconservation longitudinal photons are of a principal importance. New suggestions concerning the principle Puli checking are discussed\n\nPauli and The Spin-Statistics Theorem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDuck, Ian; Sudarshan, E.C.G.\n\n1998-03-01\n\nThis book makes broadly accessible an understandable proof of the infamous spin-statistics theorem. This widely known but little-understood theorem is intended to explain the fact that electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This fact, in turn, explains the periodic table of the elements and their chemical properties.Therefore, this one simply stated fact is responsible for many of the principal features of our universe, from chemistry to solid state physics to nuclear physics to the life cycle of stars.In spite of its fundamental importance, it is only a slight exaggeration to say that 'everyone knows the spin-statistics theorem, but no one understands it'. This book simplifies and clarifies the formal statements of the theorem, and also corrects the invariably flawed intuitive explanations which are frequently put forward. The book will be of interest to many practising physicists in all fields who have long been frustrated by the impenetrable discussions on the subject which have been available until now.It will also be accessible to students at an advanced undergraduate level as an introduction to modern physics based directly on the classical writings of the founders, including Pauli, Dirac, Heisenberg, Einstein and many others\n\nGeneralized Pauli constraints in small atoms\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchilling, Christian; Altunbulak, Murat; Knecht, Stefan; Lopes, Alexandre; Whitfield, James D.; Christandl, Matthias; Gross, David; Reiher, Markus\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe natural occupation numbers of fermionic systems are subject to nontrivial constraints, which include and extend the original Pauli principle. A recent mathematical breakthrough has clarified their mathematical structure and has opened up the possibility of a systematic analysis. Early investigations have found evidence that these constraints are exactly saturated in several physically relevant systems, e.g., in a certain electronic state of the beryllium atom. It has been suggested that, in such cases, the constraints, rather than the details of the Hamiltonian, dictate the system's qualitative behavior. Here, we revisit this question with state-of-the-art numerical methods for small atoms. We find that the constraints are, in fact, not exactly saturated, but that they lie much closer to the surface defined by the constraints than the geometry of the problem would suggest. While the results seem incompatible with the statement that the generalized Pauli constraints drive the behavior of these systems, they suggest that the qualitatively correct wave-function expansions can in some systems already be obtained on the basis of a limited number of Slater determinants, which is in line with numerical evidence from quantum chemistry.\n\nVARIACIONES SRAFFIANAS: HOMENAJE A ERNEST LLUCH\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlfons BarcelÃ³\n\n2006-07-01\n\nFull Text Available No era Ernest Lluch individuo propenso a adoptar un singular libro de cabecera, ni a seguir con fidelidad las huellas de un Ãºnico maestro.

A.; De Conti, C.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe study medium modifications of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) cross sections and their influence on the nucleon knockout reactions. Using the eikonal approximation, we compare the results obtained with free NN cross sections with those obtained with a purely geometrical treatment of Pauli blocking and with NN obtained with more elaborated Dirac-Bruecker methods. The medium effects are parametrized in terms of the baryon density. We focus on symmetric nuclear matter, although the geometrical Pauli blocking also allows for the treatment of asymmetric nuclear matter. It is shown that medium effects can change the nucleon knockout cross sections and momentum distributions up to 10% in the energy range E lab =50-300 MeV/nucleon. The effect is more evident in reactions involving halo nuclei.\n\nAn Introduction to Geometric Algebra with some Preliminary Thoughts on the Geometric Meaning of Quantum Mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHorn, Martin Erik\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIt is still a great riddle to me why Wolfgang Pauli and P.A.M. Dirac had not fully grasped the meaning of their own mathematical constructions. They invented magnificent, fantastic and very important mathematical features of modern physics, but they only delivered half of the interpretations of their own inventions. Of course, Pauli matrices and Dirac matrices represent operators, which Pauli and Dirac discussed in length. But this is only part of the true meaning behind them, as the non-commutative ideas of Grassmann, Clifford, Hamilton and Cartan allow a second, very far reaching interpretation of Pauli and Dirac matrices. An introduction to this alternative interpretation will be discussed. Some applications of this view on Pauli and Dirac matrices are given, e.g. a geometric algebra picture of the plane wave solution of the Maxwell equation, a geometric algebra picture of special relativity, a toy model of SU(3) symmetry, and some only very preliminary thoughts about a possible geometric meaning of quantum mechanics\n\nExperimental Tests of Quantum Mechanics: Pauli Exclusion Principle and Spontaneous Collapse Models\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPetrascu, Catalina Curceanu; Bragadireanu, Mario; Clozza, Alberto; Guaraldo, Carlo; Iliescu, Mihai; Rizzo, Alessandro; Vidal, Antonio Romero; Scordo, Alessandro; Sirghi, Diana Laura; Sirghi, Florin; Sperandio, Laura; Doce, Oton Vazquez; Bassi, Angelo; Donadi, Sandro; Milotti, Edoardo; Laubenstein, Matthias; Bertolucci, Sergio; Bragadireanu, Mario; Curceanu, Catalina; Pietreanu, Dorel; Ponta, Titus; Cargnelli, Michael; Ishiwatari, Tomoichi; Marton, Johann; Widmann, Eberhard; Zmeskal, Johann; Matteo, Sergio di; Egger, Jean Pierre\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle (PEP), as a consequence or the spin-statistics connection, is one of the basic principles of the modern physics. Being at the very basis of our understanding of matter, it spurs a lively debate on its possible limits, deeply rooted as it is in the very foundations of Quantum Field Theory. The VIP (VIolation of the Pauli exclusion principle) experiment is searching for a possible small violation of the PEP for electrons, using the method of searching for Pauli Exclusion Principle forbidden atomic transitions in copper. We describe the experimental method and the obtained results; we briefly present future plans to go beyond the actual limit by upgrading the experiment using vetoed new spectroscopic fast Silicon Drift Detectors. We also mention the possibility of using a similar experimental technique to search for possible X-rays generated in the spontaneous collapse models of quantum mechanics.\n\n[Thomas Schwencke and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHillen, Harry F P\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThomas Schwencke (1694-1767) was Professor of Anatomy and Surgery and Lecturer in Obstetrics at the Surgical School in The Hague, the Netherlands. In 1743 he published the very first textbook on haematology. Furthermore, he described his observations on the variolation of smallpox, and published the design of a new obstetric instrument. Schwencke was physician of the city of The Hague and also physician at the court of the princes van Nassau-Weilburg. In 1765 Princess Caroline of Nassau-Weilburg invited the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to perform concerts. During his Dutch tour the young Mozart fell seriously ill, probably from typhoid fever. At the request of the court Mozart was seen for a second opinion and thereafter successfully treated by Schwencke. Mozart could continue his concert tour and Schwencke's reputation as Mozart's physician was established.\n\nGeneralized field quantization and the Pauli principle\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGovorkov, A.B.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe work is an attempt to prove that the generalized Pauli principle (i.e. Fermi statistics) for the half-integer spin fields and the Bose statistics for the integer spin fields with allowance for the existence of internal gauge symmetries are consequences of more general assumptions of the local quantum field theory. 32 refs.; 1 tab\n\n100 Ã¥r med hormoner: fysiologen Ernest H.

With the highest sensitivity, the VIP (VIolation of Pauli Exclusion Principle) experiment set an upper limit at the level of $10^{-29}$ for the probability that an external electron captured by a Cu atom can make the transition from the 2$p$ state to a 1$s$ state already occupied by two electrons. In a follow-up experiment at Gran Sasso, we aim to increase the sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.

It is shown, that if in the quasiparticle plus phonon component the Pauli principle is not violated or is slightly violated, then a relevant vibrational state may exist in an odd-A deformed nucleus\n\nEffect of Pauli principle accounting an the two-phonon states of spherical nuclej\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSolov'ev, V.G.; Stoyanov, Ch.; Nikolaeva, R.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe effect of account for the Pauli principle in two-phonon components of the wave functions on low-lying collective states of even-even spherical nuclei is investigated. The calculations are performed for sup(114, 116)Sn and sup(142, 144, 146, 148)Sm. The account of the Pauli principle is shown to exert a weak effect on the states with large one-phonon or two-phonon components. It is concluded that in some spherical nuclei sufficiently pure two-phonon states may exist\n\nOld and new questions in physics, cosmology, philosophy and theoretical biology Festschrift Yourgrau (Wolfgang)\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n1983-01-01\n\nSimply to say that this is a collection of essays in honor of the late Wolfgang Yourgrau (1908-1979) is to explain, at least for-the obviously many-\"insiders,\" the unusually wide-ranging title of the present volume. In a Foreword to the Proceedings of the First International Colloquium (focusing on logic, physical reality, and history), held at the University of Denver in May of 1966 under their leadership, Wolfgang Y ourgrau and Allen Breck wrote, in an oblique reference to C. P. Snow: \"Indeed there are not two or three or four cultures: there is only one culture; our generation has lost its awareness of this . . . . Historians, logicians, physicists-all are banded in one common enterprise, namely in their des ire to weave an enlightened fabric of human knowledge. \" Augment, if you will, the foregoing categories of scholars with biologists, philosÂ­ ophers, cosmologists, and theologians-all of whom, in addition to historians, WolfÂ­ gang Yourgrau, by dint of his inextinguishable enthusiasm and charismatic qu...\n\nProceedings of the symposium on the foundations of modern physics, 1987\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLahti, P.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThis book discusses the following subjects: The Quantum Postulate and atomic theory; modern mathematics in formulation of basic laws of physics; uncertainty principles, Quantum systems; Niels Bohr's concept of reality; Quantum theory; language and reality in Quantum physics; Wolfgang Pauli's conception of reality; interpretation of Quantum mechanics; varieties of realism; and many-Hilbert-spaces theory of Quantum measurements\n\nHistoric physics reprints come home\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn a surprise happy ending, six boxes of historic reprints have returned home to CERN - more than 30 years after they went missing! The 146 items had been part of the personal library of the Nobel prize-winning physicist, Wolfgang Pauli. After his death in 1958, Pauli's widow bequeathed his scientific legacy to CERN, and part of this valuable archival collection was stored in Salle Pauli, the room dedicated to his memory. In those trustful days the room was always left open so that Pauli's Library could be freely consulted; but then 170 preprints by Born, Bohr, Heisenberg and others - some with dedications to Pauli from the author - disappeared in 1972. Regretfully, the room was then locked. Use of the collection was henceforth âby appointment only', but it was assumed that the damage was done and the missing items had gone forever. However, in 2002 the CERN Archivist was surprised by a phone call from a representative of Christie's, New York, who explained that some reprints bearing the stamp of the CERN...\n\nThe interpretation of nature and the psyche\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nJung, Carl Gustav\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCarl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) and Wolfgang Ernst Pauli (1900 â 1958) were two of the greatest thinkers of modern times. Jung is the founder of Analytical Psychology and is one of the best known researchers in the field of Dream Interpretation and Symbolization. Pauli was one of the pioneers of Quantum Physics. In 1945, Pauli received the Nobel Prize in Physics after being nominated by Albert Einstein for his âdecisive contribution through his discovery of a new law of Nature, the exclusion principleâ involving spin theory underpinning the structure of matter and the whole of chemistry. Together they collaborated on this book that was First published in 1952 in German as NaturerklÃ¤rung und Psyche. C. G. Jung: SynchronizitÃ¤t als ein Prinzip akausaler ZusammenhÃ¤nge. W. Pauli: Der Einfluss archetypischer Vorstellungen auf die Bildung naturwissenschaftlicher Theorien bei Kepler. However, our reviewer, himself an eminent professor of mathematics, concludes, âAfter thoroughly studying their writings for ma...\n\nPauli principle role in the description of collective non-rotational states of deformed nuclei\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSolov'ev, V.G.; Shirikova, N.Yu.; Serdyukova, S.I.; Meliev, F.; Nesterenko, V.O.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe Pauli principle role account for one-phonon and two- phonon states of even-even deformed nuclei sup(160, 164)Dy, sup(230, 232)Th, 154 Gd, 240 Pu, 238 U is performed. With account of isoscalar part of multipole-multipole interaction hamiltonian of a model and basic equations for energy and wave functions of one-phonon and two-phonon states are obtained. The results of calculations of centroids of energies of two-phonon states of the (lambda 1 Î¼ 1 i 1 lambda 2 Î¼ 2 i 2 ) type with and without the Pauli principle are tabulated. The calculations performed have shown that the energy centroids shift of collective two-phonon states with the Pauli-principle account is characteristic for all even-even deform"
