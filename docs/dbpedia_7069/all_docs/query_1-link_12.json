Al- though Sommerfelds idea of elliptical orbits has been replaced by wave mechanics, the fine struc- ture constant he introduced has remained as an important parameter in the field ofÂ ...\n\nThe fine-structure constant before quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKragh, Helge\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThis paper focuses on the early history of the fine-structure constant, largely the period until 1925. Contrary to what is generally assumed, speculations concerning the interdependence of the elementary electric charge and Planck's constant predated Arnold Sommerfeld's 1916 discussion of the dimensionless constant. This paper pays particular attention to a little known work from 1914 in which G N Lewis and E Q Adams derived what is effectively a numerical expression for the fine-structure constant\n\nAn Einstein-Cartan Fine Structure Constant Definition\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStone R. A. Jr.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The fine structure constant definition given in Stone R.A. Jr. Progress in Physics, 2010, v.1, 11-13 is compared to an Einstein-Cartan fine structure constant definition. It is shown that the Einstein-Cartan definition produces the correct pure theory value, just not the measure value. To produce the measured value, the pure theory Einstein-Cartan fine structure constant requires only the new variables and spin coupling of the fine structure constant definition in [1].\n\nDerivation of the fine-structure constant\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSamec, A.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nThe fine-structure constant is derived as a dynamical property of quantum electrodynamics. Single-particle solutions of the coupled Maxwell and Dirac equations have a physical charge spectrum. The solutions are used to construct lepton-and quark-like particles. The strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational forces are described as the interactions of complex charges in multiple combinations\n\nSimple Model with Time-Varying Fine-Structure ``Constant''\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBerman, M. S.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nExtending the original version written in colaboration with L.A. Trevisan, we study the generalisation of Dirac's LNH, so that time-variation of the fine-structure constant, due to varying electrical and magnetic permittivities is included along with other variations (cosmological and gravitational ``constants''), etc. We consider the present Universe, and also an inflationary scenario. Rotation of the Universe is a given possibility in this model.\n\nAtomic fine structure in a space of constant curvature\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBessis, N.; Bessis, G.; Shamseddine, R.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nAs a contribution to a tentative formulation of atomic physics in a curved space, the determination of atomic fine structure energies in a space of constant curvature is investigated. Starting from the Dirac equation in a curved space-time, the analogue of the Pauli equation in a general coordinate system is derived. The theoretical curvature induced shifts and splittings of the fine structure energy levels are put in evidence and examined for the particular case of the hydrogenic n=2 levels. (author)\n\nQED Based Calculation of the Fine Structure Constant\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLestone, John Paul [Los Alamos National Lab. (LANL), Los Alamos, NM (United States)\n\n2016-10-13\n\nQuantum electrodynamics is complex and its associated mathematics can appear overwhelming for those not trained in this field. Here, semi-classical approaches are used to obtain a more intuitive feel for what causes electrostatics, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. These intuitive arguments lead to a possible answer to the question of the nature of charge. Virtual photons, with a reduced wavelength of Î», are assumed to interact with isolated electrons with a cross section of ÏÎ»2. This interaction is assumed to generate time-reversed virtual photons that are capable of seeking out and interacting with other electrons. This exchange of virtual photons between particles is assumed to generate and define the strength of electromagnetism. With the inclusion of near-field effects the model presented here gives a fine structure constant of ~1/137 and an anomalous magnetic moment of the electron of ~0.00116. These calculations support the possibility that near-field corrections are the key to understanding the numerical value of the dimensionless fine structure constant.\n\nThe connection between the electromagnetic fine structure constant Î±-bar0 and the monster Lie algebra\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMarek-Crnjac, L.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe essay gives arguments for deriving the electromagnetic fine structure constant from maximally symmetric spaces. A connection between the order of some subgroups of the monster simple group, the ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass and the fine structure constant is found. A derivation of the fine structure constant from the number of elements in the Cristoffel symbol and the order of the reflection group F 4 is given\n\nBig bang nucleosynthesis with a varying fine structure constant and nonstandard expansion rate\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIchikawa, Kazuhide; Kawasaki, Masahiro\n\n2004-01-01\n\nWe calculate the primordial abundances of light elements produced during big bang nucleosynthesis when the fine structure constant and/or the cosmic expansion rate take nonstandard values. We compare them with the recent values of observed D, 4 He, and 7 Li abundances, which show a slight inconsistency among themselves in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis scenario. This inconsistency is not solved by considering either a varying fine structure constant or a nonstandard expansion rate separately but solutions are found by their simultaneous existence\n\nOn the value of the fine structure constant\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBosi, L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe fine structure constant can be approximately expressed as Î± = (20 var-phi 4 ) -1 where var-phi is the golden ratio (1 + â5)/2: the discrepancy between the present and the true value of Î± -1 is lower than 3.4Â· 10 -4 . This simple occurrence would be not fortuitous, thus suggesting a hidden physical meaning. A tentative and qualitative explanation is proposed which is based only on symmetry considerations involving both the Von Klitzing resistance and the vacuum impedance\n\nCosmological constraints on variations of the fine structure constant at the epoch of recombination\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMenegoni, E; Galli, S; Archidiacono, M; Calabrese, E; Melchiorri, A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this brief work we investigate any possible variation of the fine structure constant at the epoch of recombination. The recent measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies at arcminute angular scales performed by the ACT and SPT experiments are probing the damping regime of Cosmic Microwave Background fluctuations. We study the role of a mechanism that could affect the shape of the Cosmic Microwave Background angular fluctuations at those scales, namely a change in the recombination process through variations in the fine structure constant Î±\n\nFine-structure constant: Is it really a constant\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBekenstein, J.D.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nIt is often claimed that the fine-structure ''constant'' Î± is shown to be strictly constant in time by a variety of astronomical and geophysical results. These constrain its fractional rate of change alpha-dot/Î± to at least some orders of magnitude below the Hubble rate H 0 . We argue that the conclusion is not as straightforward as claimed since there are good physical reasons to expect alpha-dot/Î± 0 . We propose to decide the issue by constructing a framework for a variability based on very general assumptions: covariance, gauge invariance, causality, and time-reversal invariance of electromagnetism, as well as the idea that the Planck-Wheeler length (10 -33 cm) is the shortest scale allowable in any theory. The framework endows Î± with well-defined dynamics, and entails a modification of Maxwell electrodynamics. It proves very difficult to rule it out with purely electromagnetic experiments. In a cosmological setting, the framework predicts an alpha-dot/Î± which can be compatible with the astronomical constraints; hence, these are too insensitive to rule out Î± variability. There is marginal conflict with the geophysical constraints: however, no firm decision is possible because of uncertainty about various cosmological parameters. By contrast the framework's predictions for spatial gradients of Î± are in fatal conflict with the results of the Eoetvoes-Dicke-Braginsky experiments. Hence these tests of the equivalence principle rule out with confidence spacetime variability of Î± at any level\n\nAn estimation of the fine structure constant using fiber bundles\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRoss, D.K.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nRoss calculates g 0 /e, where g 0 is the strength of an elementary magnetic monopole and e is the charge on the electron, in terms of a ratio of loop sizes in the twisted and untwisted principal fiber bundles with U (1) the structure group and R 3 -(0) the base space. The result involves the present distance around the U (1) space and, rather surprisingly, the structure of the quantum gravitational vacuum. Combining this result with the expression for eg 0 from the Dirac quantization conditions gives a final estimate for the fine structure constant, alpha, near 1/100\n\nNew Tests for Variations of the Fine Structure Constant\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPrestage, John D.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe describe a new test for possible variations of the fine structure constant, by comparisons of rates between clocks based on hyperfine transitions in alkali atomos with different atomic number Z. H- maser, Cs and Hg+ clocks have a different dependence on ia relativistic contributions of order (Z. Recent H-maser vs Hg+ clock comparison data improves laboratory limits on a time variation by 100-fold to giveFuture laser cooled clocks (Be+, Rb, Cs, Hg+, etc.), when compared, will yield the most senstive of all tests for.\n\nThe variation of the fine-structure constant from disformal couplings\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDe Bruck, Carsten van; Mifsud, Jurgen [Consortium for Fundamental Physics, School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sheffield, Hounsfield Road, Sheffield S3 7RH (United Kingdom); Nunes, Nelson J., E-mail: c.vandebruck@sheffield.ac.uk, E-mail: jmifsud1@sheffield.ac.uk, E-mail: njnunes@fc.ul.pt [Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica e CiÃªncias do EspaÃ§o, Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa, Campo Grande, PT1749-016 Lisboa (Portugal)\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe study a theory in which the electromagnetic field is disformally coupled to a scalar field, in addition to a usual non-minimal electromagnetic coupling. We show that disformal couplings modify the expression for the fine-structure constant, Î±. As a result, the theory we consider can explain the non-zero reported variation in the evolution of Î± by purely considering disformal couplings. We also find that if matter and photons are coupled in the same way to the scalar field, disformal couplings itself do not lead to a variation of the fine-structure constant. A number of scenarios are discussed consistent with the current astrophysical, geochemical, laboratory and the cosmic microwave background radiation constraints on the cosmological evolution of Î±. The models presented are also consistent with the current type Ia supernovae constraints on the effective dark energy equation of state. We find that the Oklo bound in particular puts strong constraints on the model parameters. From our numerical results, we find that the introduction of a non-minimal electromagnetic coupling enhances the cosmological variation in Î±. Better constrained data is expected to be reported by ALMA and with the forthcoming generation of high-resolution ultra-stable spectrographs such as PEPSI, ESPRESSO, and ELT-HIRES. Furthermore, an expected increase in the sensitivity of molecular and nuclear clocks will put a more stringent constraint on the theory.\n\nThe variation of the fine-structure constant from disformal couplings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDe Bruck, Carsten van; Mifsud, Jurgen; Nunes, Nelson J.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe study a theory in which the electromagnetic field is disformally coupled to a scalar field, in addition to a usual non-minimal electromagnetic coupling.

T.\n\n2006-10-01\n\nFull Text Available The new dynamical theory of space is further confirmed by showing that the effective âblack holeâ masses M BH in 19 spherical star systems, from globular clusters to galaxies, with masses M , satisfy the prediction that M BH = Î± 2 M , where Î± is the fine structure constant. As well the necessary and unique generalisations of the Schr Ì odinger and Dirac equations permit the first derivation of gravity from a deeper theory, showing that gravity is a quantum effect of quantum matter interacting with the dynamical space. As well the necessary generalisation of Maxwellâs equations displays the observed light bending effects. Finally it is shown from the generalised Dirac equation where the spacetime mathematical formalism, and the accompanying geodesic prescription for matter trajectories, comes from. The new theory of space is non-local and we see many parallels between this and quantum theory, in addition to the fine structure constant manifesting in both, so supporting the argument that space is a quantum foam system, as implied by the deeper information-theoretic theory known as Process Physics. The spatial dynamics also provides an explanation for the âdark matterâ effect and as well the non-locality of the dynamics provides a mechanism for generating the uniformity of the universe, so explaining the cosmological horizon problem.\n\nStructure formation constraints on Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter annihilation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nArmendariz-Picon, Cristian; Neelakanta, Jayanth T.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe study the growth of cosmic structure in a ÎCDM universe under the assumption that dark matter self-annihilates with an averaged cross section times relative velocity that grows with the scale factor, an increase known as Sommerfeld-enhancement. Such an evolution is expected in models in which a light force carrier in the dark sector enhances the annihilation cross section of dark matter particles, and has been invoked, for instance, to explain anomalies in cosmic ray spectra reported in the past. In order to make our results as general as possible, we assume that dark matter annihilates into a relativistic species that only interacts gravitationally with the standard model. This assumption also allows us to test whether the additional relativistic species mildly favored by cosmic-microwave background data could originate from dark matter annihilation. We do not find evidence for Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter annihilation and derive the corresponding upper limits on the annihilation cross-section\n\nEvolution of the fine-structure constant in runaway dilaton models\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMartins, C.J.A.P., E-mail: Carlos.Martins@astro.up.pt [Centro de AstrofÃ­sica, Universidade do Porto, Rua das Estrelas, 4150-762 Porto (Portugal); Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica e CiÃªncias do EspaÃ§o, CAUP, Rua das Estrelas, 4150-762 Porto (Portugal); Vielzeuf, P.E., E-mail: pvielzeuf@ifae.es [Institut de FÃ­sica d' Altes Energies, Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, E-08193 Bellaterra (Barcelona) (Spain); Martinelli, M., E-mail: martinelli@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de [Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Heidelberg, Philosophenweg 16, 69120, Heidelberg (Germany); Calabrese, E., E-mail: erminia.calabrese@astro.ox.ac.uk [Sub-department of Astrophysics, University of Oxford, Keble Road, Oxford OX1 3RH (United Kingdom); Pandolfi, S., E-mail: stefania@dark-cosmology.dk [Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Juliane Maries Vej 30, DK-2100 Copenhagen (Denmark)\n\n2015-04-09\n\nWe study the detailed evolution of the fine-structure constant Î± in the string-inspired runaway dilaton class of models of Damour, Piazza and Veneziano.

For model parameters which saturate bounds from current observations, the redshift drift signal can differ considerably from that of the canonical ÎCDM paradigm at high redshifts.

Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave interferometer, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: Î± = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 Ã 10â10 accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-BordÃ© interferometer and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly ge â 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in ge â 2; a 2.5Ï tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muonâs magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.\n\nThermal evolution and small scale structure of Sommerfeld enhanced dark matter\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAarssen, Laura Gusta van den\n\n2013-04-01\n\nAlthough the existence of Dark Matter (DM) has been confirmed by many independent observations on various scales, its nature still remains a mystery. Leading candidates for the cold, non-baryonic DM are Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), that are well motivated from particle physics and naturally explain the observed relic density by their thermal production mechanism. In this thesis we focus on a particular class of WIMP models in which the Sommerfeld effect has to be taken into account. This is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that can significantly enhance the annihilation cross section in the non-relativistic limit. To describe the non-perturbative effect, we use a non-relativistic effective field theory derived from the full quantum field theory. We include a detailed discussion of the calculation for the righthanded sneutrino, which is the superpartner of the neutrino and a viable DM candidate. The Sommerfeld enhancement can have a profound influence on the thermal evolution of the DM, which can no longer be described by the standard scenario. We introduce a framework to correctly take this effect into account and apply it to a simple leptophilic DM model. A new era of annihilations can decrease the DM density even after usual freeze-out, and in some cases where the Sommerfeld enhancement is especially large, even continue until after matter-radiation equality. The effect on the asymptotic WIMP temperature, which can be directly related to a small scale cutoff in the matter density fluctuations, causes the mass of the smallest gravitationally bound objects to be larger than expected from standard calculations. Furthermore we study the effect of velocity dependent DM self-scattering in relation to the small scale structure formation. Numerical simulations of ÎCDM have shown a remarkable agreement with the large scale structure of the Universe.

J. A. P.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe demonstrate that recent measurements of cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization anisotropy made by the ACBAR, QUAD, and BICEP experiments substantially improve the cosmological constraints on possible variations of the fine structure constant in the early universe. This data, combined with the five year observations from the WMAP mission, yield the constraint Î±/Î± 0 =0.987Â±0.012 at 68% C.L. The inclusion of the new Hubble Space Telescope constraints on the Hubble constant further increases the accuracy to Î±/Î± 0 =1.001Â±0.007 at 68% C.L., bringing possible deviations from the current value below the 1% level and improving previous constraints by a factor of â¼3.\n\nContinuum limit of discrete Sommerfeld problems on square lattice\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nBASANT LAL SHARMA\n\nSommerfeld half-plane; crack; rigid ribbon; continuum limit; WienerâHopf; Toeplitz ... case of which, when it approaches zero, is called 'contin- .... etc, denote constants in expressions, inequalities, etc. The .....

To do this measurement, we use the technique of Bloch oscillations, which allows us to transfer a large number of recoils to atoms. A velocity sensor, based on velocity selective Raman transition, enables us to measure the momentum transferred to the atoms. A measurement with a statistical uncertainty of 4.4 10{sup -9}, in conjunction with a careful study of systematic effects (5 10{sup -9}), has led us to a determination of alpha with an uncertainty of 6.7 10{sup -9}: {alpha}{sup -1}(Rb) = 137.03599878 (91). This uncertainty is similar to the uncertainty of the best determinations of alpha based on atom interferometry.

Analyses of other data ( 149 Sm fission rate for the Oklo natural reactor, variation of 187 Re Î²-decay rate in meteorite studies, atomic clock measurements) which probe variations of Î± in the more recent past imply much smaller deviations from its present value. In this work we tie the variation of Î± to the evolution of the quintessence field proposed by Albrecht and Skordis, and show that agreement with all these data, as well as consistency with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations, can be achieved for a range of parameters. Some definite predictions follow for upcoming space missions searching for violations of the equivalence principle\n\nConstraining spatial variations of the fine-structure constant in symmetron models\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.M.M. Pinho\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available We introduce a methodology to test models with spatial variations of the fine-structure constant Î±, based on the calculation of the angular power spectrum of these measurements. This methodology enables comparisons of observations and theoretical models through their predictions on the statistics of the Î± variation. Here we apply it to the case of symmetron models. We find no indications of deviations from the standard behavior, with current data providing an upper limit to the strength of the symmetron coupling to gravity (logâ¡Î²2<â0.9 when this is the only free parameter, and not able to constrain the model when also the symmetry breaking scale factor aSSB is free to vary.\n\nState of the art in the determination of the fine structure constant: test of Quantum Electrodynamics and determination of h/mu\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBouchendira, Rym; Clade, Pierre; Nez, Francois; Biraben, Francois; Guellati-Khelifa, Saida\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe fine structure constant Î± has a particular status in physics. Its precise determination is required to test the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory. The constant Î± is also a keystone for the determination of other fundamental physical constants, especially the ones involved in the framework of the future International System of units. This paper presents Paris experiment, where the fine structure constant is determined by measuring the recoil velocity of a rubidium atom when it absorbs a photon. The impact of the recent improvement of QED calculations of the electron moment anomaly and the recent measurement of the cesium atom recoil at Berkeley will be discussed. The opportunity to provide a precise value of the ratio h/m u between the Planck constant and the atomic mass constant will be investigated. (copyright 2013 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

T.\n\n2006-04-01\n\nFull Text Available A theory of 3-space explains the phenomenon of gravity as arising from the time-dependence and inhomogeneity of the differential flow of this 3-space. The emergent theory of gravity has two gravitational constants: G - Newton's constant, and a dimensionless constant alpha. Various experiments and astronomical observations have shown that alpha is the fine structure constant ~1/137. Here we analyse the Greenland Ice Shelf and Nevada Test Site borehole g anomalies, and confirm with increased precision this value of alpha. This and other successful tests of this theory of gravity, including the supermassive black holes in globular clusters and galaxies, and the \"dark-matter\" effect in spiral galaxies, shows the validity of this theory of gravity. This success implies that the non-relativistic Newtonian gravity was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, and that this flaw was inherited by the relativistic General Relativity theory of gravity.\n\nThe Charge-Mass-Spin Relation of Clifford Polyparticles, Kerr-Newman Black Holes and the Fine Structure Constant\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nCastro, C\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA Clifford-algebraic interpretation is proposed of the charge, mass, spin relationship found recently by Cooperstock and Faraoini which was based on the Kerr-Newman metric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. The components of the polymomentum associated with a Clifford polyparticle in four dimensions provide for such a charge, mass, spin relationship without the problems encountered in Kaluza-Klein compactifications which furnish an unphysically large value for the electron charge. A physical reasoning behind such charge, mass, spin relationship is provided, followed by a discussion on the geometrical derivation of the fine structure constant by Wyler, Smith, Gonzalez-Martin and Smilga. To finalize, the renormalization of electric charge is discussed and some remarks are made pertaining the modifications of the charge-scale relationship, when the spin of the polyparticle changes with scale, that may cast some light into the alleged Astrophysical variations of the fine structure constant.\n\nThe Bohr-Sommerfeld atom theory.

In Sommerfeld's collected works only the publication submitted 1916 by Sommerfeld in the Annals of Physics about this is found.''My spectral lines are finally printed in the Academy to the impure. In the Annals they will appear in purer form'', so Sommerfeld has announced in this publication in February 10th 1916 to the editor of the Annals of Physics. From the science-historical view however for the extension of Bohr's atom theory just the Academy-treatises published before the purification process are of special interest. To the reproduction of these Academy-treatises an extensive physics-historical essay is prepended.\n\nGalaxy clusters, type Ia supernovae and the fine structure constant\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHolanda, R.F.L.

In this paper, we show that this technique depends on the fine structure constant, Î±. Therefore, if Î± is a time-dependent quantity, e.g., Î± = Î±{sub 0}Ï( z ), where Ï is a function of redshift, we argue that current data do not provide the real angular diameter distance, D {sub A}( z ), to the cluster, but instead D {sub A}{sup data}( z ) = Ï( z ){sup 2} D {sub A}( z ). We use this result to derive constraints on a possible variation of Î± for a class of dilaton runaway models considering a sample of 25 measurements of D {sub A}{sup data}( z ) in redshift range 0.023 < z < 0.784 and estimates of D {sub A}( z ) from current type Ia supernovae observations. We find no significant indication of variation of Î± with the present data.\n\nWAVELENGTH ACCURACY OF THE KECK HIRES SPECTROGRAPH AND MEASURING CHANGES IN THE FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGriest, Kim; Whitmore, Jonathan B.; Wolfe, Arthur M.; Prochaska, J. Xavier; Howk, J. Christopher; Marcy, Geoffrey W.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe report on an attempt to accurately wavelength calibrate four nights of data taken with the Keck HIRES spectrograph on QSO PHL957, for the purpose of determining whether the fine structure constant was different in the past. Using new software and techniques, we measured the redshifts of various Ni II, Fe II, Si II, etc. lines in a damped LyÎ± system at z = 2.309. Roughly half the data were taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of well calibrated iodine lines. Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the normal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output, we found absolute wavelength offsets of 500 m s -1 to 1000 m s -1 with drifts of more than 500 m s -1 over a single night, and drifts of nearly 2000 m s -1 over several nights. These offsets correspond to an absolute redshift of uncertainty of about Îz â¼ 10 -5 (ÎÎ» â¼ 0.02 A), with daily drifts of around Îz â¼ 5 x 10 -6 (ÎÎ» â¼ 0.01 A), and multiday drifts of nearly Îz â¼ 2 x 10 -5 (â¼0.04 A). The causes of the wavelength offsets are not known, but since claimed shifts in the fine structure constant would result in velocity shifts of less than 100 m s -1 , this level of systematic uncertainty may make it difficult to use Keck HIRES data to constrain the change in the fine structure constant. Using our calibrated data, we applied both our own fitting software and standard fitting software to measure ÎÎ±/Î±, but discovered that we could obtain results ranging from significant detection of either sign, to strong null limits, depending upon which sets of lines and which fitting method were used. We thus speculate that the discrepant results on ÎÎ±/Î± reported in the literature may be due to random fluctuations coming from underestimated systematic errors in wavelength calibration and fitting procedure.\n\n3-Space In-Flow Theory of Gravity: Boreholes, Blackholes and the Fine Structure Constant\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCahill R. T.\n\n2006-04-01\n\nFull Text Available A theory of 3-space explains the phenomenon of gravity as arising from the time-dependence and inhomogeneity of the differential flow of this 3-space. The emergent theory of gravity has two gravitational constants: GN â Newtonâs constant, and a dimensionless constant Î±. Various experiments and astronomical observations have shown that Î± is the fine structure constant â 1/137. Here we analyse the Greenland Ice Shelf and Nevada Test Site borehole g anomalies, and confirm with increased precision this value of Î±. This and other successful tests of this theory of gravity, including the supermassive black holes in globular clusters and galaxies, and the âdark-matterâ effect in spiral galaxies, shows the validity of this theory of gravity. This success implies that the non-relativistic Newtonian gravity was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, and that this flaw was inherited by the relativistic General Relativity theory of gravity.\n\nBloch oscillations of ultracold atoms and measurement of the fine structure constant\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nClade, P.\n\n2005-10-01\n\nFrom a measurement of the recoil velocity of an atom absorbing a photon, it is possible to deduce a determination of the ratio h/m between the Planck constant and the mass of the atoms and then to deduce a value of the fine structure constant alpha. To do this measurement, we use the technique of Bloch oscillations, which allows us to transfer a large number of recoils to atoms. A velocity sensor, based on velocity selective Raman transition, enables us to measure the momentum transferred to the atoms. A measurement with a statistical uncertainty of 4.4 10 -9 , in conjunction with a careful study of systematic effects (5 10 -9 ), has led us to a determination of alpha with an uncertainty of 6.7 10 -9 : Î± -1 (Rb) = 137.03599878 (91). This uncertainty is similar to the uncertainty of the best determinations of alpha based on atom interferometry.

V.; Schwerdtfeger, P.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe present numerical calculations for cesium and mercury to estimate the sensitivity of the scattering length to the variation of the fine-structure constant Î±. The method used follows the ideas of Chin and Flambaum [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 230801 (2006)], where the sensitivity to the variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio Î² was considered. We demonstrate that for heavy systems, the sensitivity to the variation of Î± is of the same order of magnitude as to the variation of Î². Near narrow Feshbach resonances, the enhancement of the sensitivity may exceed nine orders of magnitude.\n\nStandard model and fine structure constant at Planck distances in the Bennett-Brene-Nielsen-Picek random dynamics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLaperashvili, L.V.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThe first part of the present paper contains a review of papers by Nielsen, Bennett, Brene and Picek which underly the model called random dynamics.

Klink\n\n2005-12-01\n\nFull Text Available A relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated in which all of the interactions are in the four-momentum operator and Lorentz transformations are kinematic. Interactions are introduced through vertices, which are bilinear in fermion and antifermion creation and annihilation operators, and linear in boson creation and annihilation operators. The fermion-antifermion operators generate a unitary Lie algebra, whose representations are fixed by a first order Casimir operator (corresponding to baryon number or charge. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the four-momentum operator are analyzed and exact solutions in the strong coupling limit are sketched. A simple model shows how the fine structure constant might be determined for the QED vertex.\n\nUpdated constraints on spatial variations of the fine-structure constant\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA.M.M. Pinho\n\n2016-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Recent work by Webb et al. has provided indications of spatial variations of the fine-structure constant, Î±, at a level of a few parts per million. Using a dataset of 293 archival measurements, they further show that a dipole provides a statistically good fit to the data, a result subsequently confirmed by other authors. Here we show that a more recent dataset of dedicated measurements further constrains these variations: although there are only 10 such measurements, their uncertainties are considerably smaller. We find that a dipolar variation is still a good fit to the combined dataset, but the amplitude of such a dipole must be somewhat smaller: 8.1Â±1.7Â ppm for the full dataset, versus 9.4Â±2.2Â ppm for the Webb et al. data alone, both at the 68.3% confidence level. Constraints on the direction on the sky of such a dipole are also significantly improved. On the other hand the data can't yet discriminate between a pure spatial dipole and one with an additional redshift dependence.\n\nBerry's Phase and Fine Structure\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBinder, B\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIrrational numbers can be assigned to physical entities based on iterative processes of geometric objects. It is likely that iterative round trips of vector signals include a geometric phase component. If so, this component will couple back to the round trip frequency or path length generating an non-linear feedback loop (i.e. induced by precession). In this paper such a quantum feedback mechanism is defined including generalized fine structure constants in accordance with the fundamental gravitomagnetic relation of spin-orbit coupling. Supported by measurements, the general relativistic and topological background allows to propose, that the deviation of the fine structure constant from 1/137 could be assigned to Berry's phase. The interpretation is straightforward: spacetime curvature effects can be greatly amplified by non-linear phase-locked feedback-loops adjusted to single-valued phase relationships in the quantum regime.\n\nA Sommerfeld toolbox for colored dark sectors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEl Hedri, Sonia; Kaminska, Anna; Vries, Maikel de\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe present analytical formulas for the Sommerfeld corrections to the annihilation of massive colored particles into quarks and gluons through the strong interaction. These corrections are essential to accurately compute the dark matter relic density for coannihilation with colored partners. Our formulas allow us to compute the Sommerfeld effect, not only for the lowest term in the angular momentum expansion of the amplitude, but for all orders in the partial wave expansion. In particular, we carefully account for the effects of the spin of the annihilating particle on the symmetry of the two-particle wave function. This work focuses on strongly interacting particles of arbitrary spin in the triplet, sextet and octet color representations. For typical velocities during freeze-out, we find that including Sommerfeld corrections on the next-to-leading order partial wave leads to modifications of up to 10 to 20 percent on the total annihilation cross section. Complementary to QCD, we generalize our results to particles charged under an arbitrary unbroken SU(N) gauge group, as encountered in dark glueball models.

We advocate to use a determination monitored by the Adler function which allows us to exploit perturbative QCD in an optimal well controlled way. Together with a long term program of hadronic cross section measurements at energies up to a few GeV, a determination of Î±(M Z ) at a precision comparable to the one of the Z mass M Z should be feasible. Presently Î±(E) at E >1 GeV is the least precisely known of the fundamental parameters of the SM. Since, in spite of substantial progress due to new BaBar exclusive data, the region 1.4 to 2.4 GeV remains the most problematic one a major step in the reduction of the uncertainties are expected from VEPP-2000 and from a possible ''high-energy'' option DAFNE-2 at Frascati.

Although not yet competitive with bounds from high- z quasar absorption systems, our constraints, considering a sample of 29 measurements of f {sub gas}, in the redshift interval 0.14 < z < 0.89, provide an independent estimate of Î± variation at low and intermediate redshifts.

Assuming a fiducial model without Î± variations, we show that ESPRESSO can improve current bounds on the EÃ¶tvÃ¶s parameterâwhich quantifies Weak Equivalence Principle violationsâby up to two orders of magnitude, leading to stronger bounds than those expected from the ongoing tests with the MICROSCOPE satellite, while constraints from the E-ELT should be competitive with those of the proposed STEP satellite.

These shifts are calculated by the Fock-space coupled cluster method and its extrapolated intermediate Hamiltonian extension, which allow high-accuracy treatment of electron correlation. The accuracy of the method is tested by comparing 33 transition energies in heavy atoms (obtained with the laboratory Î±) with experiment; the average error is 258 cm -1 , and the largest error is 711 cm -1 . This may be compared with an average error of 432 cm -1 and a maximum error of 2150 cm -1 in the work of Dzuba et al., who reported most of the available energy shift calculations. The enhanced accuracy is due to more extensive inclusion of electron correlation. To obtain the energy shifts, we repeated the calculations with different values of Î± (within 0.1% of the current value). Our shifts differ by up to 30% from the values given by Dzuba et al., with an average difference of 9%. Based on the better quality of the present-day excitation energies, we believe the energy shifts reported here are more accurate than earlier work\n\nSommerfeld-Watson transformation for nuclear fission\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlexandru, G.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nIt is proved that the fission matrix element can be written like a Sommerfeld-Watson relation.

The paper detailed what we now know as his \"exclusion principle.\" This essay situates the work leading up to Pauli's principle within the traditions of the \"Sommerfeld School,\" led by Munich University's renowned theorist and teacher, Arnold Sommerfeld (1868-1951). Offering a substantial corrective to previous accounts of the birth of quantum mechanics, which have tended to sideline Sommerfeld's work, it is suggested here that both the method and the content of Pauli's paper drew substantially on the work of the Sommerfeld School in the early 1920s. Part One describes Sommerfeld's turn away from a faith in the power of model-based (modellmÃ¤ssig) methods in his early career towards the use of a more phenomenological emphasis on empirical regularities (GesetzmÃ¤ssigkeiten) during precisely the period that both Pauli and Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976), among others, were his students. Part two delineates the importance of Sommerfeld's phenomenology to Pauli's methods in the exclusion principle paper, a paper that also eschewed modellmÃ¤ssig approaches in favour of a stress on GesetzmÃ¤ssigkeiten. In terms of content, a focus on Sommerfeld's work reveals the roots of Pauli's understanding of the fundamental Zweideutigkeit (ambiguity) involving the quantum number of electrons within the atom. The conclusion points to the significance of these results to an improved historical understanding of the origin of aspects of Heisenberg's 1925 paper on the \"Quantum-theoretical Reformulation (Umdeutung) of Kinematical and Mechanical Relations.\"\n\nPossible evidence for a variable fine-structure constant from QSO absorption lines: motivations, analysis and results\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMurphy, M.

M.\n\n2001-11-01\n\nAn experimental search for variation in the fundamental coupling constants is strongly motivated by modern high-energy physics theories. Comparison of quasar (QSO) absorption-line spectra with laboratory spectra provides a sensitive probe for variability of the fine-structure constant, Î±, over cosmological time-scales. We have previously developed and applied a new method providing an order-of-magnitude gain in precision over previous optical astrophysical constraints. Here we extend that work by including new quasar spectra of damped Lyman-Î± absorption systems. We also reanalyse our previous lower-redshift data and confirm our initial results. The constraints on Î± come from simultaneous fitting of absorption lines of subsets of the following species: Mgi, Mgii, Alii, Aliii, Siii, Crii, Feii, Niii and Znii. We present a detailed description of our methods and results based on an analysis of 49 quasar absorption systems (towards 28 QSOs) covering the redshift range [formmu2]0.5quote above is the raw value, not corrected for any of these systematic effects. The only significant systematic effects so far identified, if removed from our data, would lead to a more significant deviation of [formmu5]ÎÎ±/Î± from zero.\n\nHow Sommerfeld extended Bohr's model of the atom (1913-1916)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEckert, Michael\n\n2014-04-01\n\nSommerfeld's extension of Bohr's atomic model was motivated by the quest for a theory of the Zeeman and Stark effects. The crucial idea was that a spectral line is made up of coinciding frequencies which are decomposed in an applied field. In October 1914 Johannes Stark had published the results of his experimental investigation on the splitting of spectral lines in hydrogen (Balmer lines) in electric fields, which showed that the frequency of each Balmer line becomes decomposed into a multiplet of frequencies. The number of lines in such a decomposition grows with the index of the line in the Balmer series. Sommerfeld concluded from this observation that the quantization in Bohr's model had to be altered in order to allow for such decompositions. He outlined this idea in a lecture in winter 1914/15, but did not publish it. The First World War further delayed its elaboration. When Bohr published new results in autumn 1915, Sommerfeld finally developed his theory in a provisional form in two memoirs which he presented in December 1915 and January 1916 to the Bavarian Academy of Science. In July 1916 he published the refined version in the Annalen der Physik. The focus here is on the preliminary Academy memoirs whose rudimentary form is better suited for a historical approach to Sommerfeld's atomic theory than the finished Annalen-paper. This introductory essay reconstructs the historical context (mainly based on Sommerfeld's correspondence). It will become clear that the extension of Bohr's model did not emerge in a singular stroke of genius but resulted from an evolving process.\n\nCalibration of the fine-structure constant of graphene by time-dependent density-functional theory\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSindona, A.; Pisarra, M.; Vacacela Gomez, C.; Riccardi, P.; Falcone, G.; Bellucci, S.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nOne of the amazing properties of graphene is the ultrarelativistic behavior of its loosely bound electrons, mimicking massless fermions that move with a constant velocity, inversely proportional to a fine-structure constant Î±g of the order of unity. The effective interaction between these quasiparticles is, however, better controlled by the coupling parameter Î±g*=Î±g/É , which accounts for the dynamic screening due to the complex permittivity É of the many-valence electron system. This concept was introduced in a couple of previous studies [Reed et al., Science 330, 805 (2010) and Gan et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 195150 (2016)], where inelastic x-ray scattering measurements on crystal graphite were converted into an experimentally derived form of Î±g* for graphene, over an energy-momentum region on the eV Ã -1 scale. Here, an accurate theoretical framework is provided for Î±g*, using time-dependent density-functional theory in the random-phase approximation, with a cutoff in the interaction between excited electrons in graphene, which translates to an effective interlayer interaction in graphite. The predictions of the approach are in excellent agreement with the above-mentioned measurements, suggesting a calibration method to substantially improve the experimental derivation of Î±g*, which tends to a static limiting value of Ë0.14 . Thus, the ab initio calibration procedure outlined demonstrates the accuracy of perturbation expansion treatments for the two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac fermions in graphene, in parallel with quantum electrodynamics.\n\nThe Sommerfeld precursor in photonic crystals\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nUitham, R; Hoenders, BJ\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe calculate the Sommerfeld precursor that results after transmission of a generic electromagnetic plane wave pulse with transverse electric polarization, through a one-dimensional rectangular N-layer photonic crystal with two slabs per layer.

V.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRecently it was pointed out that transition frequencies in certain diatomic molecules have an enhanced sensitivity to variations in the fine-structure constant Î± and the proton-to-electron mass ratio m p /m e due to a near cancellation between the fine structure and vibrational interval in a ground electronic multiplet [V. V. Flambaum and M. G. Kozlov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 150801 (2007)]. One such molecule possessing this favorable quality is silicon monobromide. Here we take a closer examination of SiBr as a candidate for detecting variations in Î± and m p /m e . We analyze the rovibronic spectrum by employing the most accurate experimental data available in the literature and perform ab initio calculations to determine the precise dependence of the spectrum on variations in Î±. Furthermore, we calculate the natural linewidths of the rovibronic levels, which place a fundamental limit on the accuracy to which variations may be determined.\n\nThe Sun-Earth connect 2: Modelling patterns of a fractal Sun in time and space using the fine structure constant\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaker, Robert G. V.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nSelf-similar matrices of the fine structure constant of solar electromagnetic force and its inverse, multiplied by the Carrington synodic rotation, have been previously shown to account for at least 98% of the top one hundred significant frequencies and periodicities observed in the ACRIM composite irradiance satellite measurement and the terrestrial 10.7cm Penticton Adjusted Daily Flux data sets. This self-similarity allows for the development of a time-space differential equation (DE) where the solutions define a solar model for transmissions through the core, radiative, tachocline, convective and coronal zones with some encouraging empirical and theoretical results. The DE assumes a fundamental complex oscillation in the solar core and that time at the tachocline is smeared with real and imaginary constructs. The resulting solutions simulate for tachocline transmission, the solar cycle where time-line trajectories either 'loop' as Hermite polynomials for an active Sun or 'tail' as complementary error functions for a passive Sun. Further, a mechanism that allows for the stable energy transmission through the tachocline is explored and the model predicts the initial exponential coronal heating from nanoflare supercharging. The twisting of the field at the tachocline is then described as a quaternion within which neutrinos can oscillate. The resulting fractal bubbles are simulated as a Julia Set which can then aggregate from nanoflares into solar flares and prominences. Empirical examples demonstrate that time and space fractals are important constructs in understanding the behaviour of the Sun, from the impact on climate and biological histories on Earth, to the fractal influence on the spatial distributions of the solar system. The research suggests that there is a fractal clock underpinning solar frequencies in packages defined by the fine structure constant, where magnetic flipping and irradiance fluctuations at phase changes, have periodically impacted on the\n\nUnderstanding fine structure constants and three generations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBennett, D.L.; Nielsen, H.B.\n\n1988-02-01\n\nWe put forward a model inspired by random dynamics that relates the smallness of the gauge coupling constants to the number of generations being 'large'. The new element in the present version of our model is the appearance of a free parameter Ï that is a measure of the (presumably relatively minor) importance of a term in the plaquette action proportional to the trace in the (1/6, 2, 3) representation of the Standard Model. Calling N gen the number of generations, the sets of allowed (N gen , ÏN gen )-pairs obtained by imposing the three measured coupling constant values of the Standard Model form three lines. In addition to finding that these lines cross at a single point (as needed for a consistent fit), the intersection occurs with surprising accuracy at the integer N gen = 3 (thereby predicting exactly three generations). It is also encouraging that the parameter Ï turns out to be small and positive as expected.

At 5 K, a statistical average splitting of 443 Â± 132 Î¼eV has been found based on 81 quantum dots. The degree of fine structure splitting stays relatively constant for temperatures less than 100 K and only increases above that temperature. At 200 K, we find that the fine structure splitting ranges between 2 and 12 meV, which is an order of magnitude higher than that at low temperatures. Our investigations also show that phonon interactions at high temperatures might have a correlation with the degree of exchange interactions. The large fine structure splitting at 200 K makes it easier to isolate the individual components of the polarized emission spectrally, increasing the effective degree of polarization for potential on-chip applications of polarized single-photon sources.\n\nDielectric constant and electrical conductivity of contaminated fine-grained soils and barrier materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKaya, A.; Fang, H.Y.; Inyang, H.I.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nCharacterization of contaminated fine-grained soils and tracking of contaminant migration within barriers have been challenging because current methods and/or procedures are labor and time-intensive, and destructive. To demonstrate the effective use of both dielectric constant and electrical conductivity in the characterization of contaminated fine-grained soils, pore fluids were prepared at different ionic strengths, and were used as permeates for kaolinite, bentonite and a local soil. Then, both dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of the soils were measured by means of a capacitor over a wide range of frequencies and moisture content. It was observed that although each soil has its unique dielectric constant and electrical conductivity at a given moisture content, increases in ionic strength cause a decrease in the dielectric constant of the system at very high frequencies (MHZ), whereas the dielectric constant increases at low frequencies (kHz). Electrical conductivity of a soil-water system is independent of frequency. However, it is a function of ionic strength of the pore fluid. It is clearly demonstrated that dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of soils are functions of both moisture content and ionic strength, and can be used to characterize the spatial and temporal levels of contamination. This method/procedure can be used in estimating the level of contamination as well as the direction of contaminant movement in the subsurface without the use of extensive laboratory testing. Based on obtained results, it was concluded that the proposed method/procedure is promising because it is non-destructive and provides a quick means of assessing the spatial distribution of contaminants in fine-grained soils and barriers\n\nWhy has the bohr-sommerfeld model of the atom been ignoredby general chemistry textbooks?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNiaz, Mansoor; Cardellini, Liberato\n\n2011-12-01\n\nBohr's model of the atom is considered to be important by general chemistry textbooks. A major shortcoming of this model was that it could not explain the spectra of atoms containing more than one electron. In order to increase the explanatory power of the model, Sommerfeld hypothesized the existence of elliptical orbits. This study has the following objectives: 1) Formulation of criteria based on a history and philosophy of science framework; and 2) Evaluation of university-level general chemistry textbooks based on the criteria, published in Italy and U.S.A. Presentation of a textbook was considered to be \"satisfactory\" if it included a description of the Bohr-Sommerfeld model along with diagrams of the elliptical orbits. Of the 28 textbooks published in Italy that were analyzed, only five were classified as \"satisfactory\". Of the 46 textbooks published in U.S.A., only three were classified as \"satisfactory\". This study has the following educational implications: a) Sommerfeld's innovation (auxiliary hypothesis) by introducing elliptical orbits, helped to restore the viability of Bohr's model; b) Bohr-Sommerfeld's model went no further than the alkali metals, which led scientists to look for other models; c) This clearly shows that scientific models are tentative in nature; d) Textbook authors and chemistry teachers do not consider the tentative nature of scientific knowledge to be important; e) Inclusion of the Bohr-Sommerfeld model in textbooks can help our students to understand how science progresses.\n\nThe 130 GeV gamma-ray line and Sommerfeld enhancements\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChen, Jing; Zhou, Yu-Feng\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecently, possible indications of line spectral features in the Fermi-LAT photon spectrum towards the galactic center have been reported. If the distinct line features arise from dark matter (DM) annihilation into Î³X(X = Î³,Z 0 or h 0 ), the corresponding annihilation cross-section is unnaturally large for typical loop-induced radiative processes. On the other hand, it is still too small to be responsible for the observed DM relic density. We show that the mechanism of Sommerfeld enhancement with scalar force-carrier can provide a simple solution to these puzzles. The possibly large Sommerfeld enhancement of the cross-section for s-wave DM annihilation can significantly reduce the required effective couplings between DM and charged particles in typical loop diagrams. The DM particles necessarily annihilate into scalar force-carriers through tree-level p-wave process, which can dominate the total DM annihilation cross-section at freeze out, resulting in the correct thermal relic density, but has subdominant contributions to the DM annihilation today due to velocity suppression. We perform detailed analysis on the effects of p-wave Sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out. The results show that with the constraints from the thermal relic density, the required effective couplings can be reduced by an order of magnitude\n\nCosmological constants and variations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBarrow, John D\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe review properties of theories for the variation of the gravitation and fine structure 'constants'.

The behaviour of a simple class of varying alpha cosmologies is outlined in the light of all the observational constraints. We also discuss some of the consequences of varying 'constants' for oscillating universes and show by means of exact solutions that they appear to evolve monotonically in time even though the scale factor of the universe oscillates\n\nDark energy and equivalence principle constraints from astrophysical tests of the stability of the fine-structure constant\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMartins, C.J.A.P.; Pinho, A.M.M.; Alves, R.F.C.

This transition has a potential for high stability and accuracy and the advantage of the highest sensitivity among atomic clocks to variation of the fine-structure constant Î± . We find its dimensionless Î± -variation enhancement factor to be K =-15 , in comparison to the most sensitive current clock (Yb+ E 3 , K =-6 ), and it is 18 times larger than in any neutral-atomic clocks (Hg, K =0.8 ). Combined with the unprecedented stability of an optical lattice clock for neutral atoms, this high sensitivity opens new perspectives for searches for ultralight dark matter and for tests of theories beyond the standard model of elementary particles. Moreover, together with the well-established 1S0-3P0 transition, one will have two clock transitions operating in neutral Yb, whose interleaved interrogations may further reduce systematic uncertainties of such clock-comparison experiments.\n\nRotational and fine structure of open-shell molecules in nearly degenerate electronic states\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Jinjun\n\n2018-03-01\n\nAn effective Hamiltonian without symmetry restriction has been developed to model the rotational and fine structure of two nearly degenerate electronic states of an open-shell molecule. In addition to the rotational Hamiltonian for an asymmetric top, this spectroscopic model includes the energy separation between the two states due to difference potential and zero-point energy difference, as well as the spin-orbit (SO), Coriolis, and electron spin-molecular rotation (SR) interactions. Hamiltonian matrices are computed using orbitally and fully symmetrized case (a) and case (b) basis sets. Intensity formulae and selection rules for rotational transitions between a pair of nearly degenerate states and a nondegenerate state have also been derived using all four basis sets. It is demonstrated using real examples of free radicals that the fine structure of a single electronic state can be simulated with either a SR tensor or a combination of SO and Coriolis constants. The related molecular constants can be determined precisely only when all interacting levels are simulated simultaneously. The present study suggests that analysis of rotational and fine structure can provide quantitative insights into vibronic interactions and related effects.\n\nStudies in stellar evolution. 3. The internal structure constants\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHejlesen, P.M.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThis is the third paper in a series describing the results of extensive stellar evolution calculations. The internal structure constants k j (j = 2, 3, 4) have been computed for a fine grid of stellar models covering the HR-diagram from the zero-age main sequence to the subgiant region. These constants represent the influence of the internal structure on the disturbing potentials of stars, and they are needed for prediction of theoretical apsidal motion rates in close eccentric binaries as well as for other tidal effects. Results for four different initial chemical compositions are presented. The opacity tables by Cox and Stewart (1969) have been adopted, and a mixing length parameter of l/H p = 2.0 has been used throughout. The results are compared with previous calculations.

Eine Biografie\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nEckert, Michael\n\n2013-09-01\n\nArnold Sommerfeld is beside Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Max Planck one of the founders of modern atomic and quantum theory. His career began in the 1890th years at the University of Goettingen, the world center of mathematics of that time. Since 1906 he created on the professorship for theoretical physics at the Munich university one of the most important schools of science, the students of which are well-known theorists of the atomic era like as the Nobel-price winners Hans Bethe, Peter Debye, Wolfgang Pauli, and Werner Heisenberg. He also developed far beyond his subject an unprecedented impact. He travelled as ''messenger of culture'' in many countries in order to advertise in the years after the first world war for the reputation of Germany as culture nation. By the nationalsocialism the Munich ''nursery of theoretical physics'' however was prepared an inglorious end, because Sommerfeld counted for a ''main propagandist of Jewish theories''.

In addition to the boost to the dark matter annihilation cross section from the high densities of these subhalos with respect to the main halo, an additional boost caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement results from the fact that they are kinematically colder than the Galactic halo. If we further believe the generic prediction of the cold dark matter paradigm that in each subhalo there is an abundance of substructure which is approximately self-similar to that of the Galactic halo, then I show that additional boosts coming from the density enhancements of these small substructures and their small velocity dispersions enhance the dark matter annihilation cross section even further. I find that very large boost factors (10 5 to 10 9 ) are obtained in a large class of models. The implications of these boost factors for the detection of dark matter annihilation from dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Galactic halo are such that, generically, they outshine the background gamma-ray flux and are detectable by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.\n\nA Uniï¬ed Theory of Interaction: Gravitation and Electrodynamics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWagener P.\n\n2008-10-01\n\nFull Text Available A theory is proposed from which the basic equations of gravitation and electromagnetism are derived from a single Lagrangian. The total energy of an atom can be expressed in a power series of the fine structure constant, $alpha$. Specific selections of these terms yield the relativistic correction to the Bohr values of the hydrogen spectrum and the Sommerfeld-Dirac equation for the fine structure spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Expressions for the classical electron radius and some of the Large Number Coincidences are derived. A Lorentz-type force equation is derived for both gravitation and electrodynamics. Electron spin is shown to be an effect of fourth order in $alpha$.\n\nThe Sommerfeld enhancement for dark matter with an excited state\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSlatyer, Tracy R.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe present an analysis of the Sommerfeld enhancement to dark matter annihilation in the presence of an excited state, where the interaction inducing the enhancement is purely off-diagonal, such as in models of exciting or inelastic dark matter. We derive a simple and accurate semi-analytic approximation for the s-wave enhancement, which is valid provided the mass splitting between the ground and excited states is not too large, and discuss the cutoff of the enhancement for large mass splittings. We reproduce previously derived results in the appropriate limits, and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the enhancement. We show that the presence of an excited state leads to generically larger values of the Sommerfeld enhancement, larger resonances, and shifting of the resonances to lower mediator masses. Furthermore, in the presence of a mass splitting the enhancement is no longer a monotonic function of velocity: the enhancement where the kinetic energy is close to that required to excite the higher state can be up to twice as large as the enhancement at zero velocity\n\nImpact parameter representation from the Watson-Sommerfeld transform\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIslam, M.M.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nUsing the Watson-Sommerfeld transform the elastic scattering amplitude of two spinless particles is shown to have an exact and unique impact parameter, or Fourier-Bessel (FB) representation.

G.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nDark matter annihilation can have a strong impact on many astrophysical processes in the Universe. In the case of Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation cross sections, the annihilation rates are enhanced at late times, thus enhancing the potential annihilation signatures. We here calculate the Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation signatures during the epoch of helium reionization, the epoch where helium becomes fully ionized due to energetic photons. When considering the upper limits on the energy injection from the CMB, we find that the resulting abundance of He++ becomes independent of the dark matter particle mass. The resulting enhancement compared to a standard scenario is thus 1-2 orders of magnitude higher. For realistic scenarios compatible with CMB constraints, there is no significant shift in the epoch of helium reionization, which is completed between redshifts 3 and 4. While it is thus difficult to disentangle dark matter annihilation from astrophysical contributions (active galactic nuclei), a potential detection of dark matter particles and its interactions using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would allow one to quantify the dark matter contribution.\n\nPlanck intermediate results.

We show that the Planck data allow one to improve the constraint on the time variation of the fine structure constant at redshift $z\\\\sim 10^3$ by about a factor of 5 compared to WMAP data, as well as to break the degeneracy with the Hubble constant, $H_0$. In addition to $\\\\alpha$, we can set a constraint on the variation of the mass of the electron, $m_{\\\\rm e}$, and on the simultaneous variation of the two constants. We examine in detail"
