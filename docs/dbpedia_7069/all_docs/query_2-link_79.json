        "text": "Names of bird taxa commonly suggest features that describe the bird in some respect, such as a plumage detail, vocalizations, size, habitat, geographic distribution or pattern of behaviour. Especially in English and scientific names of birds, there are numerous references to actual persons’ names. This title is a reference book for such names, i.e., persons’ names used in the names of birds, or eponyms – both in the vernacular English or scientific name of a taxon. The book begins with a concise but sufficient four-page introduction, which tells how to use the book and accounts for the principles used in the preparation of the work. The introduction explains abbreviations used throughout the book and deals with various other issues, such as unidentified persons, birds named after more than one person, misspellings and nomenclatural fraud. After the introduction, the book runs through the more than 4,100 names of people who have been commemorated in birds’ names. Below each name ther...\n\nThe mystery of the Gouldian birds: an ornithological detective story. Zool. Med. Leiden 79-3 (7), 30-ix-2005, 79-84.— ISSN 0024-0672.

Bern. While compiling a computer database of the avian specimens of the E.A. Goeldi collection a considerable number of skins with original labels from John Gould were discovered. In an earlier inventory they had been registered as part of the Goeldi collection, but as there was no apparent connection with Goeldi, these skins were assumed to be part of an acquisition of birds from John Gould mentioned in the Natural History Museum Bern (NMBE) committee minutes of 1862 (Güntert et al., 1993). Subsequent investiga-tion, ho...\n\nAmong the papers of the celebrated anatomist William Hunter, founder of the Hunterian Museum of Glasgow University, is a manuscript in Hunter's hand entitled 'Orignal' the Canadian French name of the moose. It not only gives the first full description of this animal and attempts to discriminate it from the European elk, but also explains why Hunter commissioned George Stubbs to depict this animal in 1770, and again in 1773. It also reveals that Hunter was interested in this animal not simply as another new animal but also for the light it shed on the controversial fossil Irish 'elk'."
