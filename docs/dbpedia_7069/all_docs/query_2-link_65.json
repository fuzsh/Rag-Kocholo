In particular, CERN is considering 100 TeV pp collisions as the key target of a Future Circular Collider facility, built around a 100 km tunnel and designed to deliver pp, e+e- and ep collisions, in addition to a programme with heavy ion beams and with the injector complex. CERN is coordinating an international study tasked with the completion, by the end of 2018, of a Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for this facility. This document presents the first results of the assessment of the physics potential of the hadronic part of this research programme (FCC-hh).\n\nObservation of very large transverse momentum jets at the CERN pp collider\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBanner, M; Bonaudi, Franco; Borer, K; Borghini, M; Chollet, J C; Clark, A G; Conta, C; Darriulat, Pierre; Di Lella, L; Dines-Hansen, J; Dorsaz, P A; Fayard, L; Fraternali, M; Froidevaux, D; Gaillard, J M; Gildemeister, O; Goggi, V G; Grote, H; Hahn, B; HÃ¤nni, H; Hansen, J R; Hansen, P; Himel, T; HungerbÃ¼hler, V; Jenni, Peter; Kofoed-Hansen, Otto MÃ¸gens; Livan, M; Loucatos, Sotirios S; Madsen, B; MansouliÃ©, B; Mantovani, G C; Mapelli, L; Merkel, B; Mermikides, Michael E; MÃ¸llerud, R; Nilsson, B; Onions, Christopher J; Parrour, G; Pastore, F; Plothow-Besch, H; Repellin, J P; Ringel, J; Rothenberg, A F; Roussarie, A; Sauvage, G; Schacher, J; Siegrist, J L; Stocker, F; Teiger, J; Vercesi, V; Williams, H H; Zaccone, Henri; Zeller, W\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe distribution of total transverse energy Sigma E/sub T/ over the pseudorapidity interval -1( eta (1 and an azimuthal range Delta phi =300 degrees has been measured in the UA2 experiment at the CERN pp collider ( \\\\sqrt{s}=540 GeV) using a highly segmented total absorption calorimeter. In the events with the very large Sigma E/sub T/ ( Sigma E/sub T/>or approximately=60 GeV) most of the transverse energy is found to be contained in small angular regions as expected for high transverse momentum hadron jets. The authors discuss the properties of a sample of two-jet events with invariant two-jet masses up to 140 GeV/c/sup 2/ and measure the cross section for inclusive jet production in the range of jet transverse momenta between 15 and 60 Ge V/c.\n\nA study of multi-jet events at the CERN anti pp collider and a search for double parton scattering\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAlitti, J.; Ambrosini, G.; Ansari, R.; Autiero, D.; Bareyre, P.; Bertram, I.A.; Blaylock, G.; Bonamy, P.; Borer, K.; Bourliaud, M.; Buskulic, D.; Carboni, G.; Cavalli, D.; Cavasinni, V.; Cenci, P.; Chollet, J.C.; Conta, C.; Costa, G.; Costantini, F.; Cozzi, L.; Cravero, A.; Curatolo, M.; Dell'Acqua, A.; DelPrete, T.; DeWolf, R.S.; DiLella, L.; Ducros, Y.; Egan, G.F.; Einsweiler, K.F.; Esposito, B.; Fayard, L.; Federspiel, A.; Ferrari, R.; Fraternali, M.; Froidevaux, D.; Fumagalli, G.; Gaillard, J.M.; Gianotti, F.; Gildemeister, O.; Goessling, C.; Goggi, V.G.; Gruenendahl, S.; Hara, K.; Hellman, S.; Hrivnac, J.; Hufnagel, H.; Hugentobler, E.; Hultqvist, K.; Iacopini, E.; Incandela, J.; Jakobs, K.; Jenni, P.; Kluge, E.E.; Kurz, N.; Lami, S.; Lariccia, P.; Lefebvre, M.; Linssen, L.; Livan, M.; Lubrano, P.; Magneville, C.; Mandelli, L.; Mapelli, L.; Mazzanti, M.; Meier, K.; Merkel, B.; Meyer, J.P.; Moniez, M.; Moning, R.; Morganti, M.; Mueller, L.; Munday, D.J.; Nessi, M.; Nessi-Tedaldi, F.; Onions, C.; Pal, T.; Parker, M.A.; Parrour, G.; Pastore, F.; Pennacchio, E.; Pentney, J.M.; Pepe, M.; Perini, L.; Petridou, C.; Petroff, P.; Plothow-Besch, H.; Polesello, G.; Poppleton, A.; Pretzl, K.; Primavera, M.; Punturo, M.; Repellin, J.P.; Rimoldi, A.; Sacchi, M.; Scampoli, P.; Schacher, J.; Simak, V.; Sing, S.L.; Sondermann, V.; Stapnes, S.; Talamonti, C.; Tondini, F.; Tovey, S.N.; Tsesmelis, E.; Unal, G.; Valdata-Nappi, M.; Vercesi, V.; Weidberg, A.R.; Wells, P.S.; White, T.O.; Wood, D.R.; Wotton, S.A.; Zaccone, H.; Zylberstejn, A.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA study of events containing at least four high transverse momentum jets and a search for double parton scattering (DPS) have been performed using data collected with the UA2 detector at the CERN anti pp Collider (âs=630 GeV).

Â Officially launched in September 2001, GridPP was one of the original partners in wLCG, funding much of the early work at CERN. Over the last decade GridPP has gone from a mere proposal to almost 30,000 CPUs working for researchers scattered across the globe. Twice a year, GridPP meets to discuss the progress and future plans of the community and this year, for the first time since 2004, decamped to CERN for this biannual meeting on the theme âGridPP in the International Contextâ. The main meeting was held over 2 days in the IT auditorium and was the perfect opportunity to have contributions from experts based at CERN, alongside those from within GridPP.

Presentation on Wednesday, 16Â March at 4Â p.m. in the Library (bldg 52-1-052) The book aims to explain the historical development of particle physics, with special emphasis on CERN and collider physics. It describes in detail the LHC accelerator and its detectors, describing the science involved as well as the sociology of big collaborations, culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson.Â Inside CERN's Large Hadron ColliderÂ Mario Campanelli World Scientific Publishing, 2015Â ISBNÂ 9789814656641â\n\nCERN balances linear collider studies\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nILC Newsline\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe forces behind the two most mature proposals for a next-generation collider, the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) study, have been steadily coming together, with scientists from both communities sharing ideas and information across the technology divide. In a support of cooperation between the two, CERN in Switzerland, where most CLIC research takes place, recently converted the project-specific position of CLIC Study Leader to the concept-based Linear Collider Study Leader. Â The scientist who now holds this position, Steinar Stapnes, is charged with making the linear collider a viable option for CERNâs future, one that could include either CLIC or the ILC. The transition to more involve the ILC must be gradual, he said, and the redefinition of his post is a good start.

With CERN's LHC operations to start in 2007, a new era in the exploration of the fundamental laws of nature will begin. In anticipation of this era of discovery, Fermilab and CERN are jointly organizing a series of \"Hadron Collider Physics Summer Schools\", whose main goal is to offer a complete picture of both the theoretical and experimental aspects of hadron collider physics. Preparing young researchers to tackle the current and anticipated challenges at hadron colliders, and spreading the global knowledge required for a timely and competent exploitation of the LHC physics potential, are concerns equally shared by CERN, the LHC host laboratory, and by Fermilab, the home of the Tevatron and host of CMS's LHC Physics Center in the U.S. The CERN-Fermilab Hadron Collider Physics Summer School is targeted particularly at young postdocs in exp...\n\n12th CERN-Fermilab Hadron Collider Physics Summer School\n\nCERN Document Server\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCERN and Fermilab are jointly offering a series of \"Hadron Collider Physics Summer Schools\", to prepare young researchers for these exciting times.

An excited quark q*, produced like a resonance in qg collisions and decaying into Wq and Zq, is the best candidate for such a object. However, colored W* and Z* bosons, produced in qq-bar collisions and decaying into Wg and Zg, cannot be excluded. We discuss possible experiments at pp-bar, pp, and ep colliders for verifying the hypothesis of the excited quark and for investigating its properties\n\nCollide@CERN - public lecture\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCERN, the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the City of Geneva are delighted to invite you to a public lecture by Gilles Jobin, first winner of the Collide@CERN Geneva Dance and Performance Artist-in-residence Prize, and his CERN inspiration partner, Joao Pequenao.

After a short introduction into the physics of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, this article recalls the main design choices made for the detector and summarizes the initial operation and performance of ALICE. Physics results from this first year of operation concentrate on characterizing the global properties of typical, average collisions, both in proton-proton (pp) and nucleus-nucleus reactions, in the new energy regime of the LHC. The pp results differ, to a varying degree, from most quantum chromodynamics-inspired phenomenological models and provide the input needed to fine tune their parameters. First results from Pb-Pb are broadly consistent with expectations based on lower energy data, indicating that high-density matter created at the LHC, while much hotter and larger, still behaves like a very strongly interacting, almost perfect liquid.\n\nCollide@CERN: sharing inspiration\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nKatarina Anthony\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLate last year, Julius von Bismarck was appointed to be CERN's first \"artist in residence\" after winning the Collide@CERN Digital Arts award.

The CREMLIN project aims at strengthening science cooperation between six Russian megascience facilities and related research infrastructure counterparts in Europe. BINP and CERN coordinate a dedicated CREMLIN work package focusing on a future super-charm-tau factory (SCT) at BINP. SCT aims at producing e+e- collisions with up to 5 GeV centre-of-mass energy and at very high luminosity. In parallel CERN is hosting design studies for two possible high-energy e+e- colliders: FCC-ee and CLIC. In matters of physics, design and technologies the BINP and CERN studies address technological and scientific questions of common interest. Similar issues are dealt with in the framework of other flavour factories and energy frontier e+e- colliders worldwide.

With interest growing in electronpositron physics at energies beyond those attainable at LEP, the next generation of electron-positron colliders must be linear if prohibitive synchrotron radiation power losses are to be avoided. Very high energy linear colliders present many technical challenges but mastery of SLC at Stanford, the world's first electron-positron linear collider, is encouraging. The physics issues of a linear collider have been examined by the international community in ICFA workshops in Saariselka, Finland (September 1991) and most recently in Hawaii (April 1993). The emerging consensus is for a collider with an initial collision energy around 500 GeV, and which can be upgraded to over 1 TeV. A range of very different collider designs are being studied at Laboratories in Europe, the US, Japan and Russia.

The accelerator part of the project relied on a number of innovations in accelerator physics and technology. The invention of the method of stochastic cooling and the extension by many orders of magnitude beyond the initial proof of principle demonstration allowed the construction of the Antiproton Accumulator. Major modifications to the 26 GeV PS complex and the conversion of the 300 GeV SPS, which had just started up as an accelerator, to a collider were required. The SPS collider had to master the beamâbeam effect far beyond limits reached before and had to function in a tight symbiosis with the UA1 and UA2 experiments.\n\nThe ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nAad, G.; et al., [Unknown; Bentvelsen, S.; Bobbink, G.J.; Bos, K.; Boterenbrood, H.; Brouwer, G.; Buis, E.J.; Buskop, J.J.F.; Colijn, A.P.; Dankers, R.; Daum, C.; de Boer, R.; de Jong, P.; Ennes, P.; Gosselink, M.; Groenstege, H.; Hart, R.G.G.; Hartjes, F.; Hendriks, P.J.; Hessey, N.P.; Jansweijer, P.P.M.; Kieft, G.; Klok, P.F.; Klous, S.; Kluit, P.; Koffeman, E.; Koutsman, A.; Liebig, W.; Limper, M.; Linde, F.; Luijckx, G.; Massaro, G.; Muijs, A.; Peeters, S.J.M.; Reichold, A.; Rewiersma, P.; Rijpstra, M.; Scholte, R.C.; Schuijlenburg, H.W.; Snuverink, J.; van der Graaf, H.; van der Kraaij, E.; van Eijk, B.; van Kesteren, Z.; van Vulpen, I.; Verkerke, W.; Vermeulen, J.C.; Vreeswijk, M.; Werneke, P.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe ATLAS detector as installed in its experimental cavern at point 1 at CERN is described in this paper.

To be specific we have considered a Colliding Beam Accelerator (CBA) with center of energy âs = 800 GeV and luminosity L = 10 33 cm -2 sec -1 (the standard BNL Isabelle (ISA) operating conditions). Most experiments should accumulate 10 sec of beam and therefore will have an integrated luminosity L = 10 40 cm -2 . This corresponds to the production of millions of conventional charged W's per interaction region and gives the potential for high statistics studies of the properties of W's and for experiments searching for higher mass objects. Our focus has been on testing predictions of the standard model. We have concentrated on W production since it is likely the standard Z 0 will be observed in the near future. In most cases the W is detected via its semileptonic decay W â l + nu. The specific topics considered are: W +- production: pp â W +- + X, W +- â e +- + nu, pp â W +- + Î³ + X, polarization effects in W +- production, and very high luminosity experiments\n\nEIB lends EUR 300 million for CERN's major collider\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2002-01-01\n\n\"The European Investment Bank (EIB) is lending EUR 300 million to finance the final phase of construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

The study, conducted with the collaborative participation of interested institutes world-wide, considers several options for very high energy hadron-hadron, electron-positron and hadron-electron colliders to be installed in a quasi-circular underground tunnel in the Geneva basin, with a circumference of 80 km to 100 km. All these machines would make intensive use of advanced superconducting devices, i.e. high-field bending and focusing magnets and/or accelerating RF cavities, thus requiring large helium cryogenic systems operating at 4.5 K or below. Based on preliminary sets of parameters and layouts for the particle colliders under study, we discuss the main challenges of their cryogenic systems and present first estimates of the cryogenic refrigeration capacities required, with emphasis on the qualitative and quantitative steps to be accomplished with respect to the present state-of-the-art.\n\nAmerican superconductor technology to help CERN to explore the mysteries of matter company's high temperature superconductor wire to be used in CERN's Large Hadron Collider\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAmerican Superconductor Corporation has been selected by CERN, to provide 14,000 meters of high temperature superconductor (HTS) wire for current lead devices that will be used in CERN's Large Hadron Collider (1 page).\n\nComparison of impact-picture predictions with data from CERN panti p collider\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBourrely, C.; Westfield Coll., London; Soffer, J.; Tai Tsun Wu.\n\n1982-11-01\n\nRecent data on the total cross section and the elastic slope parameters at small momentum transfers from the UA1 and UA4 Collaborations at the CERN panti p Collider are compared with the impact-picture predictions.

In this paper, we describe the accelerator part of the venture which relied on a number of innovations: an extension of the budding method of stochastic cooling by many orders of magnitude; the construction of the Antiproton Accumulator, depending on several novel accelerator methods and technologies; major modifications to the 26 GeV PS Complex; and the radical conversion of the 300 GeV SPS, which just had started up as an accelerator, to a protonÃ¢Â\"antiproton collider. The SPS Collider had to master the beamÃ¢Â\"beam effect far beyond limits reached ever before and had to function in a tight symbiosis with the huge detectors UA1 and UA2.\n\nComplementarity of the CERN LEP collider, the Fermilab Tevatron, and the CERN LHC in the search for a light MSSM Higgs boson\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nCarena, M S; Wagner, C E M\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWe study the discovery potential of the CERN LHC, Fermilab Tevatron and CERN LEP colliders in the search for the neutral CP-even Higgs boson of the MSSM which couples to the weak gauge bosons with a strength close to the standard model one and, hence, plays a relevant role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. We place special emphasis on the radiative effects which influence the discovery reach of these colliders. We concentrate on the Vbb channel, with V=Z or W, and on the channels with diphoton final states, which are the dominant ones for the search for a light standard model Higgs boson at LEP or Tevatron and LHC, respectively. By analyzing the parameters of the MSSM for which the searches become difficult at one or more of these three colliders, we demonstrate their complementarity in the search for a light Higgs boson which plays a relevant role in the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking.

It describes in detail the LHC accelerator and its detectors, describing the science involved as well as the sociology of big collaborations, culminating with the discovery of the Higgs boson.

The intent of the lectures was to describe the physics of /bar p/p at CERN and Fermilab. Particular attention has been paid to making a self contained presentation to a prospective audience of graduate students. Since large Monte Carlo codes might not be available to all members of this audience, great reliance was placed on ''back of the envelope estimates.'' Emphasis was also placed on experimental data rather than theoretical speculation, since predictions for, for example, supersymmetric particle production are easily obtained by transcription of formulae already obtained. 9 refs., 67 figs., 2 tabs\n\nComparison of discovery limits for extra Z bosons at future colliders\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGodfrey, S.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe study and compare the discovery potential for heavy neutral gauge bosons (Z') at various e + e - and pp (-) colliders that are planned or have been proposed. Typical discovery limits are for the Fermilab Tevatron â¼1 TeV, Di-Tevatron â¼2 TeV, CERN LHC â¼4 TeV, LSGNA (a 60 TeV pp collider) â¼13 TeV while the e + e - discovery limits are 2--10x âs with the large variation reflecting the model dependence of the limits. While both types of colliders have comparable discovery limits the hadron colliders are generally less dependent on the specific Z' model and provide more robust limits since the signal has little background. In contrast, discovery limits for e + e - limits are more model dependent and, because they are based on indirect inferences of deviations from standard model predictions, they are more sensitive to systematic errors\n\nFor information - UniversitÃ© de GenÃ¨ve : Accelerator Physics Challenges for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nUniversitÃ© de GenÃ¨ve\n\n2005-01-01\n\nUNIVERSITE DE GENEVE Faculte des sciences Section de physique - DÃ©partement de physique nuclÃ©aire et corspusculaire 24, Quai Ernest-Ansermet - 1211 GENEVE 4 TÃ©lÂ : (022) 379 62 73 Fax: (022) 379 69 92 Mercredi 16 March SEMINAIRE DE PHYSIQUE CORPUSCULAIRE Ã 17h00 - Auditoire StÃ¼ckelberg Accelerator Physics Challenges for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN Prof. Olivier Bruning / CERN The Large Hadron Collider project at CERN will bring the energy frontier of high energy particle physics back to Europe and with it push the accelerator technology into uncharted teritory.

The machine will be built in the 27 km circumference ring-tunnel of an existing collider at CERN. It aims to achieve collision rates of 10 9 per second in two of its high-energy particle detectors. This requires two high-intensity beams of more than 10 14 protons each. Shielding, access control and activation in addition to the high power in the proton-proton collisions must be taken into account. The detectors and local electronics of the particle physics experiments, which will surround these collisions, will have to be radiation resistant. Some of the environmental issues raised by the project will be discussed.

The machine will be built in the 27 km circumference ring tunnel of the existing LEP collider at CERN. The high intensity of the circulating beams (each containing more than 10 14 protons at 7 TeV) determines the thickness specification of the shielding of the main-ring tunnel, the precautions to be taken in the design of the beam dumps and their associated caverns and the radioactivity induced by the loss of protons in the main ring by inelastic beam-gas interactions. The high luminosity of the collider is designed to provide inelastic collision rates of 10 9 per second in each of the two principal detector installations, ATLAS and CMS. These collisions determine the shielding of the experimental areas, the radioactivity induced in both the detectors and in the machine components on either side of the experimental installations and, to some extent, the radioactivity induced in the beam-cleaning (scraper) systems. Some of the environmental issues raised by the project will be discussed.

Compared with lower-energy jets observed in e + e - and pp collisions, the fragmentation function measured in the present experiment is softer (i.e. peaked to smaller values of z) and the mean internal transverse momentum is larger, mainly because of the effects of the QCD scaling violations. Using our knowledge of the quark and gluon structure functions in the proton, together with the QCD matrix elements, a statistical separation of quark and gluon jets is achieved within the present experiment. The fragmentation function for the gluon jets is found to be softer, and the angular spread of the fragmentation products larger, than is the case for quark jets.

It is the largest and most ambitious scientific instrument ever built and 100 years after the Rutherford experiment it continues that tradition of âsmashing atomsâ to unveil the secret of the infinitely small. LHC makes use of all what we learnt in 40 years of hadron colliders, in particular of ISR and Sp-pbarS at CERN and Tevatron at Fermilab, and it is based on Superconductivity, discovered also 100 years ago. Designing, developing the technology, building and finally commissioning the LHC took more than twenty years. While LHC is now successfully running, we are already preparing the future for the next step. First, by increasing of a factor five the LHC luminosity in ten years from now, and then by increasing its energy by a factor two or more, on the horizon of the next twenty years.

Using a data sample of 310 pb -1 collected by the Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab at â(s)=1.96 TeV, exclusive cross sections for events with two jets of transverse energy E T jet â¥10 GeV have been measured as a function of minimum E T jet . The exclusive signal is extracted from fits to data distributions based on Monte Carlo simulations of expected dijet signal and background shapes. The simulated background distribution shapes are checked in a study of a largely independent data sample of 200 pb -1 of b-tagged jet events, where exclusive dijet production is expected to be suppressed by the J z =0 total angular momentum selection rule. Results obtained are compared with theoretical expectations, and implications for exclusive Higgs boson production at the pp Large Hadron Collider at â(s)=14 TeV are discussed.\n\nCERN Library | Pauline Gagnon presents the book \"Who cares about particle physics? : making sense of the Higgs boson, the Large Hadron Collider and CERN\" | 15 September\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN Library\n\n2016-01-01\n\n\"Who cares about particle physics? : making sense of the Higgs boson, the Large Hadron Collider and CERN \", by Pauline Gagnon.

BICC General Superconductors, in collaboration with the University of Southampton, have developed and manufactured prototype current leads for the Large Hadron Collider project. The resistive section consists of a phosphorus de-oxidized copper conductor and heat exchanger and the HTS section is constructed from BICC General's (Pb, Bi)2223 tapes with a reduced thermal conductivity Ag alloy sheath. We present the results of the materials optimization studies for the resistive and the HTS sections. Some results of the acceptance tests at CERN are discussed.

Vol. 1\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1984-01-01\n\nA Workshop, jointly organized by ECFA and CERN, took place at Lausanne and at CERN in March 1984 to study various options for a pp (or panti p) collider which might be installed at a later date alongside LEP in the LEP tunnel. Following the exploration of e + e - physics up to the highest energy now foreseeable, this would open up the opportunity to investigate hadron collisions in the new energy range of 10 to 20 TeV in the centre of mass. These proceedings put together the documents prepared in connection with this Workshop. They cover possible options for a Large Hadron Collider (LHC= in the LEP tunnel, the physics case at it stands at present, and studies of experimental possibilities in this energy range with luminosities as now considered.

It became the second such workshop to be held, the first having been in 1979 at the College de France, Paris.

Progress was made on the test facility, for investigating the critical question of generating the short and intense bunches required for the driving beam. In the drive linac, the wake fields associated with the transfer structure and the consequent stability issue are severe. Therefore, studies and calculations are carried on overmoded pipes, cylindrical with either symmetrical corrugations or combs asymmetrically placed on one side. In the main linac, the question was addressed of minimizing the energy spread by shifting the phase of the accelerating voltage, leading to requirements conflicting with those for beam stability. A prototype of high-gradient accelerating cells has been built and measured. In parallel with the design studies of the final focus system, a model of a small-aperture, high-gradient quadrupole, that could be part of the scheme, has been realized and measured\n\nCP odd observables for the t t-bar system produced at p p-bar and pp colliders\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrandenburg, A.; Ma, J.P.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nSome CP odd observables are proposed to test CP invariance in the t t-bar system proceeded at p p-bar and pp colliders. As CP violation can appear both in the production and in the decays of the top quarks, it is important to separate the effects from each other by using different observables. These will be discussed and some comments on using the observables for pp colliders are also made. Numerical results for these observables are given together with their sensitivity to the new CP violating interactions. 17 refs, 1 fig\n\nProtection of the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchmidt, R.; Assmann, R.; Carlier, E.; Dehning, B.; Denz, R.; Goddard, B.; Holzer, E. B.; Kain, V.; Puccio, B.; Todd, B.; Uythoven, J.; Wenninger, J.; Zerlauth, M.\n\n2006-11-01\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will collide two counter-rotating proton beams, each with an energy of 7 TeV. The energy stored in the superconducting magnet system will exceed 10 GJ, and each beam has a stored energy of 362 MJ which could cause major damage to accelerator equipment in the case of uncontrolled beam loss. Safe operation of the LHC will therefore rely on a complex system for equipment protection. The systems for protection of the superconducting magnets in case of quench must be fully operational before powering the magnets. For safe injection of the 450 GeV beam into the LHC, beam absorbers must be in their correct positions and specific procedures must be applied. Requirements for safe operation throughout the cycle necessitate early detection of failures within the equipment, and active monitoring of the beam with fast and reliable beam instrumentation, mainly beam loss monitors (BLM). When operating with circulating beams, the time constant for beam loss after a failure extends from apms to a few minutesâfailures must be detected sufficiently early and transmitted to the beam interlock system that triggers a beam dump. It is essential that the beams are properly extracted on to the dump blocks at the end of a fill and in case of emergency, since the beam dump blocks are the only elements of the LHC that can withstand the impact of the full beam.\n\nSimilarities and differences between antipp and pp scattering at TeV energies and beyond\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGauron, P.; Nicolescu, B.\n\n1986-12-01\n\nThe significant difference between the pp and antipp elastic dÏ/dt discovered at the CERN ISR, and the behaviour of the antipp dÏ/dt at the CERN collider, which have profound implications for the asymptotic behaviour of hadron scattering amplitudes, are explained in terms of a model theory based upon general S-matrix principles and a dynamical assumption of ''maximal strength'' for the strong interactions. Our model theory provides an excellent description of the pp and antipp data in the huge range 10 â¤ âs â¤ 630 GeV for /t/ â¤2.5 (GeV) 2 . Several striking consequences of the theory will be testable at Tevatron energies and beyond\n\nFrom the LHC to future colliders.

This report of a CERN Theory Institute includes the summaries of Working Groups that reviewed the physics goals and prospects of LHC running with 10 to 300 fb -1 of integrated luminosity, of the proposed sLHC luminosity upgrade, of the ILC, of CLIC, of the LHeC and of a muon collider. The four Working Groups considered possible scenarios for the first 10 fb -1 of data at the LHC in which (i) a state with properties that are compatible with a Higgs boson is discovered, (ii) no such state is discovered either because the Higgs properties are such that it is difficult to detect or because no Higgs boson exists, (iii) a missing-energy signal beyond the Standard Model is discovered as in some supersymmetric models, and (iv) some other exotic signature of new physics is discovered. In the contexts of these scenarios, the Working Groups reviewed the capabilities of the future colliders to study in more detail whatever new physics may be discovered by the LHC. Their reports provide the particle physics community with some tools for reviewing the scientific priorities for future colliders after the LHC produces its first harvest of new physics from multi-TeV collisions.

Proposals concerning what accelerators CERN should build for the future are outlined; machines such as the Large Hadron Collider and the CERN Linear Collider have been proposed. Experimental expectations for the first Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider (now close to completion) are briefly described, along with the experimental investigations for the second phase of operation of LEP where modifications will increase the machine's energy. Criticisms of CERN's management by its governing body are also discussed.

Located at CERN, near Geneva, LEP was built during the years 1983 - 1989, was operational until 2000, and corroborated the standard model of particle physics through continous high precision measurements. The Author, director-general of CERN during the crucial period of the construction of LEP, recounts vividly the convoluted decision-making and technical implementation processes - the tunnel alone being a highly challenging geo- and civil engineering project - and the subsequent extremely fruitful period of scientific research. Finally he describes the difficult decision to close down LEP, at a time when the discovery of the Higgs boson seemed within reach. LEP was eventually dismantled...\n\nEnergy Extraction in the CERN Large Hadron Collider a Project Overview\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nDahlerup-Petersen, K; Kazmine, B; Medvedko, A S; Sytchev, V V; Vasilev, L B\n\n2001-01-01\n\nIn case of a resistive transition (quench), fast and reliable extraction of the magnetic energy, stored in the superconducting coils of the electromagnets of a particle collider, represents an important part of its magnet protection system. In general, the quench detectors, the quench heaters and the cold by-pass diodes across each magnet, together with the energy extraction facilities provide the required protection of the quenching superconductors against damage due to local energy dissipation. In CERN's LHC machine the energy stored in each of its eight superconducting dipole chains exceeds 1300 MJ. Following an opening of the extraction switches this energy will be absorbed in large extraction resistors located in the underground collider tunnel or adjacent galleries, during the exponential current decay. Also the sixteen, 13 kA quadrupole chains (QF, QD) and more than one hundred and fifty, 600 A circuits of the corrector magnets will be equipped with extraction systems. The extraction switch-gear is bas...\n\nDesign and Installation Challenges of the Neutral Beam Absorbers for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nFernÃ¡ndez VÃ©lez, Ãscar\n\n2005-01-01\n\nEl CERN (Consejo Europeo de InvestigaciÃ³n Nuclear) estÃ¡ construyendo su nuevo acelerador de partÃ­culas en la frontera franco-suiza.
