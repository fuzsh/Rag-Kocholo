        "text": "This is a collection of six papers that Schrödinger published at the rate of almost one a month in 1926. Three more papers written in 1927 were added to the second German edition of the book published in 1928, before being translated into English. This book contains the foundation of wave mechanics as a theory of matter, in which the now-famous Schrödinger equation first appears. As it is acknowledged by the author himself in his introduction, Schrodinger wrote the first paper without knowing exactly what deeper implications it may have. It was like exploring a dark, unknown room with a flashlight: you never know whether there is actually a door until you find one. Schrödinger's inquiry was driven by the desire of understanding what lies behind the phenomena. He believed that scientific theories should be taken as describing the mechanisms which give rise to the experimental results rather than merely systematizing them. In other words, he was a scientific realist searching for intuitive models which he believed would shed some light on the nature of things, just as a flashlight would indicate the door in the room. In his first paper in this collection, \"Quantisation as a Problem of Proper Values (Part I),\" his aim is to provide a deeper explanations of the 'quantum rules' which were merely postulated to reproduce the data. This explanation is tentative, but it suggests that there may be some oscillatory phenomenon in the atom, so that one can try to build a 'wave mechanics' to account for the experimental data. The other papers continue in this enterprise, as they provide the building blocks of what Schrödinger regarded as a promising model to describe reality, refining the ideas, and filling in the holes. Ultimately, however, the project turned out to be unsuccessful. In fact while in the papers in this collections Schrödinger points out at the difficulties of his project and he is hopeful of solving them, the situation quickly changed after 1928. For a variety of reasons 1 the Copenhagen School and its anti-realist attitude had won over most physicists, and Schrödinger stopped working on quantum theory if not to criticize it. So, while one may naturally think of the first paper in this collection as a starting point, namely the birth of the new quantum theory based on 1 See e.g. M. Beller (1999): Quantum Dialogue: The Making of a Revolution, University of Chicago Press, for more on this.\n\nThe relationship between light speed energy and the kinetic energy of non-relativistic particles is considered and an equation proposed to unify them. This leads naturally to the postulation of the de Broglie vector to represent any relativistic or non-relativistic particle. By adopting this concept, it is possible to account for the wave-particle duality associated with quantum mechanics, which is demonstrated for both diffraction and refraction. The angular momentum of the de Broglie vector can be considered as the spin of a particle, pointing along the axis of rotation. The visualisation of a particle as simply a de Broglie vector leads to the idea that all matter is an embodiment of energy trapped within a potential well. If energy escapes the potential well and reacts in a negative manner to the gravitational field of the potential well, it would reach the speed of light almost instantaneously."
