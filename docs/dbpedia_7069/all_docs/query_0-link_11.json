During a long weekend, she told of her father's discovery of quantum mechanics, the family's exile from Nazi Germany, and the personalities of her father's many famous students. Seventy years later, she could still see the Mephisto-like eyes of Edward Teller and hear the Bach concertos for two pianos performed by her father, Max Born, and his young assistant, Werner Heisenberg. She recalled Albert Einstein's visits to their home when she was young and how special they were. The story was fascinating, as was the woman; but Irene had one regret: No one had written a biography of her father, who had been so instrumental in the quantum revolution, the most important scientific advance of the twentieth century. After I arrived home, Irene's story bounced around in my head. The first half of this century had always held a particular absorption for me: the political reverberations of World War I, the creative explosion in science, literature, and the arts during the 1920s, the global Depression, the profound changes in Germany, World War II, the bomb. I realized that Max Born's life was an intimate portrait of all these events. I called Irene to ask if I could write his biography. She agreed. A few months later in London, I met her brother, Professor Gustav Born, the executor of his father's papers-who straightaway became Gustav. His gracious consent for me to use the papers and write the biography gave me access to the rich trove of family documents stored at the University of Edinburgh. The thousands of letters, diaries, and photos there, a largely untapped historical source, chronicle not only the life of Max Born and his family, but also the scientific and political developments of Germany and Europe that profoundly affected him. They are by turns fascinating and troubling. Perhaps the most disconcerting find was a letter to Born signed by Adolf Hitler, thanking him for his service to the University of Gottingen-from which the Nazis suspended him ix\n\nx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nin 1933 because he was Jewish. Later I learned that the signature was by autopen, but the impact was only slightly lessened. The Edinburgh papers reveal Born's personal side, in both relationships and thoughts, and complement the 10,000 or so letters in his professional correspondence that exist in public archives. (Max Born and his wife, Hedi, were prodigious letter-writers.) In all of these, the importance of religion, war, and scientific pursuit stand out as factors crucial to his development, but paradoxically: an assimilated German-Jew, Born had no interest in formal religion, yet it defined the direction of much of his life; a pacifist, he shaped the scientific background of many of the inventors of the atomic bomb. As for his own theoretical search for fundamental truths, it gave him optimism for the future and escape from the present. He was dependent on his work for his strength and sense of purpose and proud and excited when he found answers. Modest about his accomplishments, Born saw former assistant Werner Heisenberg receive credit for some of his own ideas, and he saw other ones simply subsumed into the quantum mechanical theory known as the Copenhagen Interpretation. The intimate side of his life revealed a paradox as well: a wife he desperately needed, but whom he described in his later years as the cross he had to bear. Their relationship was sometimes tortuous for him, but he chose to pursue it. As I had anticipated, Born's life contained the elements that drew me and made his story so compelling. Especially satisfying was that, in spite of the hardships through which Born journeyed, he persisted and ultimately prevailed. In old age, when he had graciously accepted his fate, he unexpectedly received the recognition that he had striven for and that he deserved. Life does not usually resolve itself in such a way, but it is pleasing when it does. Nancy Greenspan Bethesda, MD\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nDECEMBER\n\n1953,\n\nEDINBURGH, SCOTLAND\n\nOne Sunday evening, Max Born was relaxing upstairs in his sitting room listening to the radio. It was 9:15 and the soft voice just beginning his talk belonged to J. Robert Oppenheimer, Born's doctorate student in Germany twenty-seven years earlier. Oppenheimer was in London to give six lectures on quantum physics for the BBC's prestigious Reith Lecture Series. Born had enjoyed the first three and was anticipating the fourth entitled \"Atom and Void in the Third Millennium.\" This evening's topic covered Born's particular field of research. As the speaker began, he described the excitement of the quantum discoveries in the 1920s along with the illustrious physicists associated with them except for Born. Oppenheimer gave a lucid explanation of the discovery but passed over his old teacher without a single mention. Oppenheimer's omission did not come from ignorance; indeed, it was this specific research that originally had drawn him to work with Born in Germany. Oppenheimer told his radio audience that when researchers investigated the position of a particle, they never found it where they thought they would, nor did they see it spread out. He explained, \"The spreading of the waves in space did not mean that the electron itself spread; it meant that the probability or likelihood of our finding the electron, when we look for it, spread as the wave does.\" This fundamental concept, so simply put by Oppenheimer, changed the nature of science, creating the transition from the deterministic world of Newtonian mechanics to the modern statistical world of quantum theory. Born discovered the principle and originated the shift. Born's forty-five year career of shaping the theoretical physicists of the future had reached its end. A couple of weeks earlier, his department at the University\n\n- -- - - - - - -\n\n-\n\n-\n\n--\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nof Edinburgh had presented him with a collection of articles from colleagues and students-Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrodinger, Theodore von Karman, Alfred Lande, Louis de Broglie, David Bohm-to honor a scientific legacy that included major contributions in quantum theory, solid-state physics, optics, special relativity, and field theory. It was time for Born to take account of his life. Oppenheimer's omission felt all the more pointed in juxtaposition. Born thought about the lecture for a few days then wrote to Oppenheimer. It was December 11, 1953, Born's seventy-first birthday. Twenty years and a day earlier, his friends Paul Dirac and Erwin Schrodinger, and his former young assistant, Werner Heisenberg, had received the Nobel Prize for their contributions to quantum theory. Born, who had intensified the search for a solution to the quantum mystery and played a major role in the revolutionary new theory, did not. Born started off in the traditional European manner with a number of gracious remarks then came to the point.\n\nThe day Born wrote the letter, he and his wife moved out of their home of seventeen years and went to stay in a hotel before leaving Edinburgh for good. Up until that day, it had been a long journey through petty squabbles and world wars, quantum mechanics and atomic explosions. Now they were going back to Germany-where it had all started.\n\n2\n\nI was particularly happy about your emphasis of the importance of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics that I inaugurated 27 years ago, but I cannot conceal my disappointment that you did not mention my part in the matter, although you have quoted others, like Bohr, Heisenberg, etc. I am now very old and beyond ambition or greed for honours. I have been silent for these 27 years, but I think that I now can at least ask the question: Why is it that my participation, or may I say leadership, in this development from the mechanistic to the modern way of thinking is almost everywhere neglected? It began when in 1934 [sic] Heisenberg alone got the Nobel Prize, for work done in collaboration with me and, to some degree, with Jordan. He did not know at the time ( 1925) what matrices were; but a short time later the expression \"Heisenberg Matrices\" was introduced. This I can understand, for who could disentangle the distribution of 3 collaborators, except these themselves? But with the statistical interpretation of the wave function the matter is quite different. I found violent opposition from Heisenberg, who in a letter called my ideas a \"treason against the spirit of matrix mechanics.\" This letter is lost in the Nazi upheaval during my emigration, but Heisenberg has frankly acknowledged the correctness of my memory.\n\nA week later, Oppenheimer replied that he had kept the names to a minimum to reduce confusion. Trying to soften the slight, he added, \"I am one of the last to forget your part in these affairs, for I was one of those who learned of the discoveries more or less as you made them.\"\n\n3\n\nONE\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nM\n\nAX WANTED A PAIR OF LOVEBIRDS. HE KNEW HIS CHANCES WERE SLIM-HIS FATHER\n\nalready had said no. Their city apartment in Breslau could not accommodate the smell and noise of pet birds. In early December, though, shortly before his fifth birthday, Max overheard from the nursery an encouraging conversation in the drawing room. \"I got the couple of love-birds yesterday for Max,\" said Fraulein Wedekind, his grandmother's secretary. \"I hope he will like them.\" Max glowed. On the morning of December 11, Max ran eagerly into the drawing room. He saw a table covered with presents-toys, books, and cakes-but where was the birdcage? Overcome with disappointment, his eyes welled up and he cried quietly. Then he realized that Grandmother had not yet arrived. Surely she would bring the lovebirds! When she appeared empty-handed, Max burst into sobs. His family watched in bewilderment at the distraught little boy. Finally, Fraulein Wedekind took him into a corner and prodded the full story from him. He had misunderstood, she explained-the lovebirds were a Christmas present for his uncle, Max Kauffmann. Max hid his embarrassment amid the family laughter. Years later, recalling this public revelation of his greed and eavesdropping, he noted, \"It was the first experience which taught me to be reserved. Many others followed.\" Young Max's shyness and sensitivity were reinforced by a deeper loss than a pair of lovebirds. \"There was no mother in whom I could confide, and who could restore my confidence.\" Gretchen Kauffmann Born had died a year and a half earlier, in summer 1886. Pregnant with her third child, she had fled the heat of Breslau for the cooler air and forest beauty of Tannhausen, her parents' country estate. In this sanctuary southwest of Breslau, she hoped to find relief from the searing pain of gallstones. Max and his two-year-old sister, Kathe, came with her. 5\n\n7\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nAt Tannhausen, curly-headed Maxel and giggly Katchen (as the family called them) scampered about with a gang of seven or eight cousins, running on short plump legs through the park and gardens surrounding the house. Watching them was a pleasure long awaited by Gretchen. She had spent the previous year at the mineral springs in Karlsbad, hoping that soothing waters would ease her suffering. For months she had only been able to enjoy her children and their antics through her husband Gustav's letters. He had lovingly told her how the serious Maxel was always careful not to muss his clothes when splashing about with a watering can in the flower bed or when playing coachman to Gustav's unruly horse. If\"horse\" were not lined up with the reins properly, Maxel would yell, \"Horse not in order.\" Gustav described the happy and lively Katchen snatching Maxel's toys and making him search for them; and he lamented, \"Ach, that the Mama cannot see the joyful hunt.\" As a physician, Gustav knew the risks of gallstones. Besides acute pain, they caused inflammation and intense pressure that medical treatment in 1886 could do little to abate. His hopes for Gretchen's recovery and emptiness without her filled his letters to her.\n\nlate nineteenth century. Gustav's father, Marcus Born, had been a district physician in the small German town of Garlitz. When he died suddenly, Gustav came to the university. Gustav was a poet and amateur thespian with a sensitive face framed by curly dark hair and a full beard and mustache that accentuated the sparkle of his eyes when he was excited-eyes that to his young nephew Hans seemed \"on fire.\" Much sought after by the young ladies of Breslau, he had captivated Gretchen Kauffmann at once. Gustav in turn was charmed by the warmth and intelligence that lit up her strong, pretty features. Having grown up in an atmosphere of music and culture, she was a talented pianist and complemented his poetic temperament. Gretchen's father, Salomon, was director of the Meyer-Kauffmann Textilwerke A. G., a family-owned textile manufacturing company with numerous spinning, weaving, and dying plants located in Silesia, then part of Germany. In the Kauffmanns' eyes, at least, their wealth and social position outshone the educational and professional achievements of the solidly middle-class Born family. Gretchen's parents were not pleased by the prospect of marrying their oldest daughter to a junior researcher at the university. Shortly after Gustav and Gretchen's engagement was announced, Gustav's sister Selma called on the Kauffmanns. She was shown into a large first-floor apartment in a Florentine palazzo-style building located on one of Breslau's most prestigious squares. Frau Marie Kauffmann, with hair piled high in a bun and mouth sternly set, greeted her, and then, according to Selma, \"regally rustled out of the room.\" That meeting was a defining moment for the Born and Kauffmann families. To Selma Born, Marie Kauffmann forever remained a self-glorified person with whom she wanted little interaction. Only Gretchen, whom Selma saw as an \"amiable, lovely personality;' saved that first day. On a splendid August afternoon in 1881, Gretchen and Gustav married at Tannhausen. To make sure their daughter would maintain her social position, the Kauffmanns provided the new couple with a large annual allowance along with access to all the family trappings: Tannhausen, their summer estate; Kleinburg, a grand weekend retreat near Breslau; the family box at the symphony; dinner parties with renowned musicians; and a handsome apartment. Gustav chafed under this heavy-handed generosity but felt helpless to object, especially since Gretchen's fragile health benefited from her family's largesse. Bound by love, Gustav and Gretchen created what Selma called \"a house in the sun\" that shone for five yearsespecially with the birth of Max in 1882 and then Kathe in 1884. Then on August 29, 1886, as the sun began to set over the Weistritz River at the valley's base, Gretchen Born died at Tannhausen. Gustav showed his grief and love in the poem he wrote for her gravestone.\n\n6\n\nI have such a longing for my wife, to see her again with me healthy and blooming, that I am not quite capable of saying it. For nearly a year, I am so out of my mind, and so often I have feared who knows what. Look after yourself properly and conscientiously obey the rules. And before saying your prayers before meals, say to yourself: Lead me not into temptation with fatty and acidic foods; let me have plenty of meat, white bread, light vegetables and much wine. Thus he cautioned before continuing, I am alone again and so return my soul to you. I have a dream, a truly bold dream, a truly gigantic dream that comes to fruition when I have my wife and children, healthy, cheerful, and contented around me, and I myself have a permanent position which allows me to be independent. When will these bold dreams be fulfilled? Now enough of dreams. (That dream is my main vice anyway.) We defend ourselves bravely in the present. Gustav Born and Gretchen (for Margarethe) Kauffmann met in Breslau in 1880. He had come to Breslau six years earlier to be an assistant researcher in the anatomy department at the university. His love was embryology; he was beginning a serious investigation of hybridization, artificially inseminating frog eggs. First he had followed his father's wish and completed a medical degree, making two generations of Born physicians, unusual for Jewish families in the\n\n8\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nThere remains a comfort which lifts us up, What you have planted in me with your wonderful spirit of love and goodness, That endures on and on and that works and lives.\n\nAfter Gretchen's death, Gustav withdrew into his research. For a while, a young Polish Catholic girl who had been Katchen's wet nurse looked after the children. She was soon replaced by a governess-a stern spinster incapable of filling the emotional void left by their mother's death. Later, Max would recall, \"There was never anybody with whom we children could take refuge with our little sorrows and joys, as other children did with their mothers.\" As with the lovebirds, he buried his frustration, loneliness, and suffering deep inside himself. No one made things better, and no one explained about the world, leaving him frequently confused as a boy. Behind the governess stood the imposing figure of Grandmother Kauffmann: brisk, controlling, and overprotective. Almost every day the children would hear her carriage arrive, see her sweep into the house, then listen quietly as she gave the governess her orders for the day. Friends, health care, and little gifts-nothing escaped her attention. Gustav buried himself in his work, too tired to argue with either woman about the children's daily care. In the early years after their mother's death, the Born children had few friends apart from one another. Grandmother, fearing draughts because Max had had an asthma attack, restricted their activities except for playing with their cousins. Max and Kathe became each other's best companions, even creating their own language to confound the adults. When Max reached school age, his grandmother demanded that he be tutored at home, due to his fragile health. She hired Herr Bohr-a friendly man with a \"full resounding voice\"-as tutor. Bohr's first challenge was to get the timid boy to talk. With coaxing he eventually succeeded, and by the end of the year Max was shouting out answers with delight. His grandmother decided Max was healthy enough to go to Wankel's Knabenschule, an elementary school for boys, the next year. Afternoons and weekends were playtimes with his cousins. Once a week he played with the three Jacobi boys, sons of Aunt Selma and Dr. Joseph Jacobi, at Grandmother Born's house. Sometimes they also visited each other's houses; on other days, there were cousins from the Kauffmann side of the family. Gretchen Kauffmann Born had had a brother and two sisters, and their father, Salomon, came from a large family that provided plenty of playmates for Max and Kathe. Not liking their values, however, Selma kept her boys at home when Max was with his other cousins.\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\n9\n\nThe Kauffmann cousins often gathered at their retreat in Kleinburg, a budding suburb a few kilometers south of Breslau. On sunny days, Grandfather's carriage would collect the children and their nannies and drive them out to the private parklike garden, with a large orchard, greenhouse, vegetable garden, tennis courts, stables, and playground. The children romped, filched fruit from Grandfather's favorite trees, and played soldiers: Max as General Helmut von Moltke, hero of the Franco-Prussian War, and cousin Hans Schafer as the great chancellor Otto von Bismarck, unifier of Germany, led the others in mock battle. These lively afternoons in Kleinburg were a prelude to summer at Tannhausen, where life was idyllic for Max. An assortment of cousins roamed through the forest where the \"Teutons\" fought the \"Romans\" using twigs for swords and pinecones for missiles. Years later, when Max and Kathe were young adults, they climbed to a large outcropping in the woods called the Haunstein. From there they could see all that Max remembered as paradise- the river Weistritz meandering past quaint villages, the fields and meadows, the hills and forest. Age had not diminished its glory in Max's eye. He told his sister, \"If one traveled the world, one would never see a more beautiful place than this.\" Summers also brought Max cherished time with his father. After a long winter of work, Gustav would go trekking with friends in the Tirolean or Swiss Alps before joining the children at Tannhausen. There Max and the cousins excitedly anticipated nature walks through the. \"dark, mysterious spruce forests\" with Gustav, whom Max described as \"an intimate friend of all living creatures.\" During one summer, Gustav returned from the Tirol with a rare alpine salamander for Max. He explained to his son the animal's need for special care and feeding, and for a couple of weeks, Max carefully followed his instructions. One night, however, he forgot. The next morning he found the salamander dead. His father did not scold him but rather used the event to illustrate the meaning of life and death. As Max later wrote, \"From that moment I suddenly knew what it meant to make another creature suffer and die.\" From his father, Max learned his outlook on life, the basic principles for assessing life's most complex issues: I am certain that his deepest conviction was that the most fundamental rules of ethics can just as well, or even better, be derived from a study of nature, including man, than from religious tradition. For he believed that these rules, during the progress of evolution which culminates in man's civilization, become intrinsic parts of our soul. ... He did not say \"never kill\"-he killed many animals in his biological research- ... but nevertheless he imbued in\n\n10\n\n11\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nme a deep respect for the right of every living creature to enjoy its span in the light of the sun.\n\nsection lab in order to double-check Gustav's assessments. When Gretchen was still alive, Gustav had written to her, \"The professor torments me . . . [I will] pursue the matter with Hasse himself to show him clearly and sharply how very much he damages me.\" Unfortunately, Hasse, like many other Germans, was not to be moved. The \"truly bold dream\" Gustav had written Gretchen about included finding a position at another university, but opportunities for Jewish scientists were scarce. At the University of Halle, officials told him that employment would be conditional on his being baptized. They felt that having one Jewish scientist on the staff-a physiologist named Bernstein-was enough. Gustav refused the offer. He thought that religion should remain private. He would not renounce his religion for convenience, even though he did not adhere to its beliefs. After all, his father and grandfather had not converted in the face of anti-Semitic pressures. Indeed, Marcus Born, Gustav's father, had faced a similar decision. After establishing his first medical practice in the small Prussian-Polish town of Kempen, he had riled his Polish patients by supporting Germany in a political dispute and they abandoned him. Throughout a three-year hunt for another medical position-during which he worried constantly about supporting his wife and infant son-conversion would have simplified matters considerably. Instead, he only searched harder. Marcus made this decision even though he was not religious, describing himself as \"a bit of a heathen\" to his fiancee, Fanny Ebstein, before their marriage in 1849. The designation was by way of explaining that he could not tolerate Jewish dietary laws, such as the separation of meat and dairy products, or accept the concept of a wrathful God.\n\nWhat Max took from his father was that life without struggle and killing is an illusion. Nature did not follow the Christian rule. To survive, animals must kill each other, and humans must kill animals. The Christian rule came in to stop humans from killing each other-the difference being that humans \"remember, understand, and imagine; that means, our fear is not the terror of the moment, as that of a deer chased by a dog, but it is the clear vision of the cruel future.\"\n\nYears later, Max accepted a friend's invitation to a rabbit hunt. He expected to observe, but his friend persuaded him to shoulder a gun. As the two walked along, a hare jumped out in front of them, and the friend yelled \"Fire!\" Max did, purposely aiming too high, but then he \"heard a scream from some living creature. I do not know whether it was that hare or another animal, but I had certainly hit some living being, and there was no way to find it in the woods and end its pain:' He never raised a gun again, and he never forgot the scream. Gustav recognized Max's sensitive nature as akin to his own. Aside from his children, his most passionate attention went into his work, a quest for understanding the nature of life. He developed a method for constructing wax-plate models of biological organs that allowed him to demonstrate the structure of the mammalian heart and to discover a septum in the upper part of the atrium. His investigations of factors affecting sex ratio in the birthrate of frogs showed that poor nutrition favored the development of females. He experimented with the regenerative capacity of tadpoles by cutting up various species while they were still supplied with yolk, creating artificial unions and observing differences in growth and development. A \"newspaper\" published yearly by the university's young lecturers spoofed Gustav's efforts: Two frogs made love in a pond, Born waited in vain for their spawn, Inseparable they did seem, But both were masculine.\n\nGustav indulged his love for biology at serious emotional cost. From his start at the Institute of Anatomy in 1874, he had been under the direction of Professor Karl Hasse. The German laws of 1871 that legislated complete equality of Jews apparently had not diminished Hasse's anti-Semitism. He treated Gustav with disdain, ridiculing him in public and hampering his advancement. While Gustav looked on in chagrin, Hasse would reexamine students in the dis-\n\nI do not love the very old gray selfish ruler ... who gets yellow with anger when he gets the smell of buttered chicken up his nose. Either he does not know what is good or he begrudges it. Father Zeus did not bother about the fleshpots or milkpots of mankind. He looked at their strengths as in Hermes or Theseus ... and lifted them up to himself and the other gods in heavenly Olympus .... What do you think of this lovely region in which God is not a strange terrible unfathomable might on the other side of the stars, but lives in you and in everything around you? As Marcus's son, Gustav grew up on this philosophy. Their family by this time had resettled in the German town of Garlitz, which had very few Jews and no noticeable anti-Semitism. His parents belonged to a private club whose members were for the most part Gentiles. The household was nonkosher; Gustav\n\n12\n\n13\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nwent to the local Gymnasium rather than to a religious school. \"The loveliest feast\" of the year was Christmas, complete with presents and a tree that the four children decorated with their own handiwork of gilded apples, long paper chains, and strings of raisins and almonds. For the children, at least, assimilation was a fact. Unusual for most Jewish families, they unselfconsciously thought of themselves as Germans whose religious background was incidentally Jewish. Not surprisingly, Gustav brought these same values into his own family, raising Max and Kathe to be freethinkers with respect to religion. Still, he wanted them to know the Bible because so much of western culture was infused with its images. With no Jewish instruction at Wankel's Knabenschule, Max took the school Bible class taught by a Lutheran parson. On the first day, the parson asked Max to recite the Lord's Prayer. Max proudly began to recite the version learned from his sister's Polish Catholic wetnurse years earlier. The parson interrupted him several times to correct his wording to correspond to the Protestant form. From then on, the other boys in the class subjected Max to merciless teasing. The effect on him was profound, \"the beginning of a deep resentment against religion.\"\n\nnew bride's lack of charm and beauty; there was a more complex side: Bertha's strong East Prussian (i.e., \"Jewish\") accent unmistakably linked her to the ghetto and to ethnic Russian and Polish -Jews flocking to western cities such as Breslau. Bertha's conspicuous ethnicity seems to have threatened the Kauffmanns' sense of belonging to mainstream German society. Their attitude may have rubbed off on Max; some of the Lipsteins later had the impression that he too would have liked Bertha to be \"more German.\" The crucial milestone oflegal equality for Jews in 1871 did not create a truly open society any more than it ended the anti-Semitism of Gustav's boss. Barriers remained even for those Jews who wanted to assimilate fully into local and national customs, who simply wanted to be regarded as Germans, just like their Protestant and Catholic neighbors. Striving for parity, they willingly abandoned any vestige of their religious background, embraced German culture and higher education, accumulated wealth, and, perhaps most importantly, tried to erase the signs of their ethnic roots. Boarding school in Switzerland, however, had not succeeded in erasing Bertha's accent. Both the Kauffmanns and Borns were as assimilated as German society would allow. \"They believed they differed from their neighbours only in respect of religion,\" wrote Max, \"for which they had hardly any use, and that they were Germans by culture and custom.\" This identity was so strong that the late nineteenth-century novel Soll und Haben (Debit and Credit)-a story with sharply drawn, negatively stereotyped Jews who contrasted with the story's noble German merchants-was a favorite in their households as it was in other assimilated ones. Max read it as a boy and enjoyed it. Rereading the novel as an adult, he was struck by the contradictions. \"[The families] obviously considered themselves as belonging to the class of noble German merchants, and having nothing to do with the 'Galician' small traders with their 'Yiddish' dialect and low standard of education.\" Russian and Polish Yiddish accents and ethnic clothing were, for some assimilated Jews, an embarrassment, a reminder of the recent past and a liability in a society rife with anti-Semitism. Yet the Borns heartily welcomed Bertha into their family. They were generally more welcoming than the Kauffmanns, but they also had something in common: not only a reasonably similar background, but a shared dislike of Gustav's intrusive, self-important in-laws.\n\nIn the years after Gretchen's death, Gustav met and courted a few women. His quest did not find him a second great love, but he still wanted to remarry so that his children would have a mother. Friends thought they had the perfect match for him: a good woman in her late twenties-approaching spinsterhood-who could both care for his children and provide a dowry that would end his financial dependence on Gretchen's parents. Gustav got to know Bertha Lipstein through letters, an acceptable practice at a time when some marriages were still arranged. In July 1892, six years after Gretchen's death, they wed. Max was nine and a half; Kathe was eight. The new Mrs. Born came from Konigsberg in East Prussia. Bertha Lipstein was one of a dozen children of a wealthy timber merchant who had started out in the Russian part of Poland and moved west to escape violent pogroms. Max found his stepmother a kind and honest person. His cousin Helene Schafer thought \"she was not charming or beautiful like the first, but had a splendid character.\" Later on her granddaughter described her as very kind, shy, and lacking in social skills. To Marie and Salomon Kauffmann, however, Bertha was a poor substitute for Gretchen. Max later summarized their reaction. \"How could Gustav, the lover of the fair and charming Margarethe Kauffmann, marry this unattractive, shy, and reserved spinster!\" Their dismay, however, was not based solely on the\n\nGustav's father, Marcus, had grown up in the small Polish town of Lissa. His childhood was typical of Jewish experience of the 1820s. He lived with his parents and six brothers and sisters in the town's Jewish quarter, which was considerably apart\n\n15\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nfrom non-Jews. Marcus went to the cheder-a school often crammed into a room in the teacher's house-where he mainly studied Torah and the Talmud. His father was a trader whose life was largely at the mercy of the governing authority, which taxed the Jews excessively and did not allow them to move to another town, own real estate, or educate their children at the local Gymnasium. But as the Jews of Lissa knew, this disconcerting situation was far better than the constant fear felt by those who lived further east, where random violence by the peasantry or the more systematic looting, burning, and raping by a Cossackinstigated pogrom were a constant threat. The prosperity of Lissa, a market town in the province of Posen dependent on its Jewish traders, tended to shield Marcus's family and others from such life-threatening rampages. Except for a brief interlude under Napoleon, the Prussians had controlled this region of Poland since the country's partition between Prussia, Austria, and Russia in 1795. After the partition, the Prussian government found itself with a large Jewish population that was culturally, physically, and economically separate from the Poles and, because of governmental economic restrictions, considerably impoverished. It was a population the government did not want, so it set about concocting schemes to force the poorest Jews to migrate from the province. When population flows proved too fluid and borders too porous, the Prussian government gave up this approach and decided that what it could not get rid of, it would change. The official policy became one of \"Germanization,\" or cultural assimilation, a way to make the Jews seem less foreign and threatening. Jewish assimilation was a gradual process. By 1830, government policy allowed Marcus and his brothers to attend the German Gymnasium in town. Moreover, in 1835, his father, who was modestly successful at his trade, became a naturalized citizen of the state of Prussia. A German census taker, walking through the dusty streets of the Jewish quarter with printed form in hand, had knocked on the family's door to ask six important questions: Do you speak German in professional activities? Have you adopted a family name? Is your lifestyle irreproachable? Have you been a permanent resident of the Duchy of Posen since 1815? What is your occupation? Finally, and most important, are you economically secure? In that year only 5 percent of Posen's Jews fulfilled the six criteria necessary to earn citizenship. For those special few, the new status opened the door to Germany. Marcus was able to study medicine at the University of Berlin and left the Jewish quarter of Lissa far behind. As the list of census questions shows, last names were an important factor to the government. Before the 1795 Prussian takeover, most Jews did not have family names, referring to themselves by the patronymic \"son of\" (or \"ben\" in Hebrew, as in Isaac ben Solomon). To the Prussians, last names were essential, not\n\nonly for cultural conformity but as a system for tracking Jews. At first, Jews simply chose a name based on a descriptor such as a trade (Schneider for tailor) or a physical trait (Schwartz for black). In some towns, though not in Lissa, local clerks contrived to sell more desirable names such as Rosenthal (valley of roses) to the highest bidder and sadistically assigned humiliating names such as Affenkraut (monkey weed) to less affluent Jews. For reasons unknown, Marcus's family had taken the name Buttermilch. Marcus later wrote to a friend that his father had lived honorably with the name for years, but he felt differently. \"How is it possible to be called Buttermilch?\" he wrote. \"I am surprised how I managed to put up with such a sweet-sour name.\" And so, without their father's knowledge, the five sons petitioned the royal magistrate in Lissa for a change of name. On February 14, 1842, the Buttermilch sons became known as Born, German for \"rejuvenating spring.\" They were now, as Marcus said, \"one syllable men\" in the High German tradition. Gretchen Kauffmann Born's ancestors came from the other side of the Oder River from Prussian Poland-in Prussia itself. In the eighteenth century, throughout the German states, local authorities forbade Jews to live within the walls of towns and cities. Only with the local ruler's approval were a few exceptions granted. Having successfully petitioned the crown for special privileges in Frankfurt am Oder, Gretchen's ancestors established a business there in white goods-linens and bedding- in the early 1700s. In addition to moving inside the city wall, after much argument they were permitted to buy a home, largely because no one else would buy the deteriorating building. The next few generations managed to amass wealth in spite of the restrictions on professions, property ownership, and residence. As the nineteenth century began, the descendants of Chajim ben Jekuthiel Kauffmann Prager became known as Kauffmann (German for businessman). Gretchen's grandfather-Salomon's father-left the family business in Frankfurt am Oder, crossed the river into Silesia, and set up a small white goods shop in Schweidnitz. By 1843, he had expanded to Breslau, where he sent his oldest son, nineteen-year-old Salomon, as the firm's representative. Well-connected by rail, Breslau had an active market that supported a thriving textile smuggling business over the Polish border, and Salomon's office prospered. His business skills had sufficiently matured by 1851 that the firm sent him to London's Great Exhibition to display woven goods as one of more than 13,000 exhibits. There he marveled at spectacular fountains, fireworks, and most extraordinary of all, the Crystal Palace-a dazzling feat of Victorian architecture, more than 1 million square feet with 300,000 sheets of glass. But for Salomon, even the Crystal Palace was eclipsed by the superiority of English woven goods produced by mechanized looms.\n\n14\n\n16\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nOn his recommendation, the firm replaced old-fashioned handlooms with water-powered, mechanized ones. Within a year, they were well on their way to real prosperity, shipping white goods throughout Prussia and the provinces that were equal in quality to those produced in Britain. By the time Gustav Born met Margarethe Kauffmann in 1880, her father and his brothers owned four textile factories in various parts of Silesia and were one of Breslau's wealthiest families . German law and social structure had allowed Jews only a few narrow routes out of the ghetto. The Kauffmanns had successfully taken that of trade and business. Marcus Born had taken another-medicine. Law would have worked equally well. In entering academia, however, Gustav Born broke with custom and practice. Universities were state institutions, and professors were state employees. The state did not want to hire Jews; and if it did, it did not promote them.\n\ncreative. Out of bricks no more than three inches long he built a vaulted bridge with a span of more than a yard, relying on no glue or external supports but solely on the principles of physics. Even Grandfather Kauffmann was impressed. Max never forgot the special moment\n\nFor Gustav, marriage to Bertha severed the two most irritating of the Kauffmann strings: Grandmother's reign over the children-for which Max was pleased-and Grandfather's domineering financial control. First on Gustav's agenda was to move out of the apartment belonging to the Kauffmanns and into one on the other side of town. About a year later, Gustav and Bertha further consolidated their independence by having a son of their own, whom they named Wolfgang. Bertha, who had no more interest in the Kauffmanns than they in her, minimized their social contact, including the summer vacations in Tannhausen, although the children's Saturday dinners at the Kauffmanns were still a must. With their cousins, Max and Kathe entertained their grandparents with plays and recitals. As they grew older, they took part in social events at the house and in the city. The great violinist Joseph Joachim sent Max a postcard as a memento of Max's piano accompaniment at one of his grandparents' musical soirees. Still, contention brewed beneath the surface of these visits. The Kauffmanns could not resist using Saturday dinners to criticize Gustav and Bertha's child rearing. In a sharp letter to Marie-the chief agitator-Gustav retorted that he was concerned for Max and Kathe's health and education, not for their introduction to Breslau's theaters, symphonies, and parties. Ten-year-old Max called Bertha \"Mama;' appreciated her many kindnesses, and essentially enjoyed his new life. Only minutes from their new house lived one of his Kauffmann cousins and playmates, Franz Mugdan. After school, their favorite activity was creating colossal buildings out of toy bricks. Whether they followed the directions or not, they never liked the results-a reaction confirmed by their parents' raised eyebrows; so Max decided to try something more\n\n17\n\nwhen the last wedge was being fixed into the top of the polygonal arch resting temporarily on a pile of books, [and) the books were removed: would the bridge stand, would our purely intuitive calculation of the forces be correct? I think that this was the first time I had that kind of scientific adventure which consists in bringing a rational construction to the test by experiment, and it gave me the first idea of the meaning of definite rules of nature. More often, Max and Franz built intricate cities of houses and castles, guarded by tin soldiers. With small spring-loaded guns firing shot or peas, they bombarded each other's creations. Houses and castles tumbled down, miniature bricks skittered about, tin soldiers fell to the rhythm of their loud \"kabooms.\" To achieve greater realism, Max even invented a method to fire shot from the little guns that resulted in a whiff of smoke along with a loud bang. One night at supper, Max boasted to his father about the shattering defeat his army had inflicted on Franz's that afternoon. Gustav responded, \"Shall I tell you about my own experiences in the war of 1870-71 ?\" Max and Kathe listened, keen to hear of their father's exploits during Prussia's decimation of the French grand armies. Gustav told them that at the outbreak of war, he was a medical student and had patriotically enlisted as an orderly, transporting the wounded and assisting physicians in the field. He saw no glamour, no romance, no glory-only the realities of war in the soldiers' broken bodies and spirit. And so he told his children that night about trains crowded with soldiers who had left their personalities behind and become numbers in a machine; about field ambulance stations where wounded and maimed men were brought in and operated on; about field hospitals full of suffering, death and horror; he spoke about the fate of the civilians in the battle zone, whose houses were burning, and about the famine in the beleaguered city of Paris. With \"suppressed passion;' Gustav described \"the degradation of the human personality to a cog in the wheel of the war machine, deprived of will and dignity.\" Max, who was about thirteen, did not fully comprehend this horror-but years later he would.\n\n18\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA KIND OF SHELL\n\nBy this time, Max had entered the Kaiser Wilhelm Gymnasium, a school in the humanistic tradition, with Latin and Greek as the most important subjects, followed by mathematics. Max's school reports rated him, for the most part, genugend, or satisfactory, midway on the spectrum that started with sehr gut (very good) and ended with nicht genugend (not satisfactory). Occasionally, in physics he would get a gut, less often in mathematics, where his teachers' method relied on rote memory, a decided weakness on his part. Only one teacher from that period remained memorable to him: Erich Maschke, who taught physics and mathematics in a manner that did not require Max to rely on memory. Instead, Dr. Maschke explained the larger concepts-\"the meaning of the whole theory to which a theorem belonged, about its history and its practical applications.\" Max was excited by the world of ideas and the integration of mathematical concepts. The other subjects-Greek, Latin, German, history, geography-that required rote learning, were difficult and boring. \"Content to be just average;' he did not work hard, and his father did not push him. Outside of school, Max had plenty of close friendships with his cousins, but at school, he was a solitary person, an outsider. He never made any real friends there-perhaps, he thought later, because of his shyness. As for girls, he met a few whom he liked, but felt too shy and awkward to pursue them-except for one, for whom he had developed a special longing. He expressed these feelings so outwardly when playing Chopin's E-minor prelude that his piano teacher, who was a bit of a ladies' man and had an ear for these things, exclaimed, \"Max, you are in love. I hear it in your playing.\" After an innocent flirtation, however, the girl rejected him, closing even that emotional window. A photo of fifteen-year-old Max shows a good-looking boy with an air of sadness and vulnerability. His early years without a mother had been difficult. Music was-and remained-an important release for him. Later, when trying to explain his emotional reserve, he thought that not having a mother \"deprived us of a natural outlet for our feelings ... So a kind of shell had developed around me, and nature had not given me the gift of expressing my emotions in words.\" Through music, he could at least express \"a morsel\" of his feelings. Under his teacher's tutelage, he developed a talent that allowed him a lifelong opportunity.\n\nto die at that moment. He survived that night, and Bertha was able to take him home, but he suffered from a weak heart from then on. The next day, Uncle Joseph told Max about the serious state of his father's health-news that Max could plainly see was true. He saw his father as a \"completely exhausted, broken man;' as though the \"worries of his life had worn him out.\" The \"shadow of his suffering\" descended over the family. Gustav continued to work at his laboratory on a limited basis and in the evenings stayed home. In earlier days, Max would sometimes go by his father's lab to walk home with him, the two stopping on the way at a beer garden to sit under the Chestnut trees and eat scrambled eggs or Vienna sausages-peaceful evenings and a joy for Max. Now, the evenings were spent at home, but were still a joy. As Max recalled,\n\nOne evening in the winter of 1897-1898, Gustav arrived early for a dinner party at his sister Selma's and lay down to rest. Shortly afterward she heard him call for help. Hurrying in, she saw him covered with perspiration. Her husband, Joseph, who was also Gustav's physician, found his pulse and heart weak enough for him\n\n19\n\nWe profited from that as he liked to chat with us in his unique way, mixing humour and earnestness, or to read to us aloud-if his breath allowed the exertion. During his last winter he read the whole of Faust to us; or rather he recited most of it by heart. Sometimes a few of Gustav's colleagues would stop by to discuss their research along with politics and philosophy. Uncle Joseph visited, as well as Albert Neisser, the dermatologist who discovered the gonococcus. Occasionally, the anatomist Karl Weigert came from Frankfurt am Main, bringing his cousin, Paul Ehrlich, the future Nobel laureate who invented Salvarsan, a remedy for syphilis. These serious scientists welcomed Max into their circle. For a teenager who came alive in the world of ideas, it was inspiring-a final and lasting gift from his father. Gustav's own research at the end of his life focused on determining the function of the corpus luteum, a small yellowish body in the ovaries of mammals. Its function was unknown at that time, along with much else about the gestational process. Gustav hypothesized that the corpus luteum was an endocrine gland whose secretions prepared the uterus to accept and protect an egg. He had found that its structure was close to that of other endocrine glands and that it was present only in mammals that formed true placentas. Although close to unraveling the mystery, he was just too sick to carry out the additional research necessary to test his hypothesis. On his deathbed, he called his former student Ludwig Frankel to him and asked him to continue his work. Frankel did so, and, with his partner Cohn, he later confirmed his teacher's theory. Within thirty years, other researchers had proven that the secretion from the corpus luteum was the hormone progesterone, critical for maintaining a pregnancy to the end of gestation.\n\n20\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nGustav Born, a scientist who was never appropriately recognized, knew none of that. In the early morning hours of July 6, 1900, he died from a heart attack. He was forty-nine years old. Max was not yet eighteen, and Kathe was just sixteen. Gustav's family placed much of the blame for his early death on the poisoned atmosphere created by his supervisor, Professor Hasse. Even in death, Gustav was not free from his tormentor of twenty-six years. University officials asked Hasse, who was dean of the medical faculty, to deliver a speech at the ceremony following the funeral. It was a large and formal event with a performance by the university choir. Repeatedly in his speech, Hasse referred to Gustav as his Untergebenen-his subordinate, or inferior. Cousin Helene Schafer, who was in the audience sitting just behind Max, saw Max become paler and paler as Hasse continued. At one point she feared he would spring up and throttle Hasse. One obituary for Gustav began, \"Professor Born is dead. This frightening news ran through our city in the early morning hours of July 6 and shattered everyone's heart.\" To his students and colleagues, it was the loss of \"one of the best.\" Max himself simply described the days following his father's death as a \"nightmare.\"\n\nTWO\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\nT\n\nHE WEEKS FOLLOWING HIS FATHER'S DEATH SEEMED TO MAX AS THOUGH THEY WERE\n\n\"covered by a veil.\" On the surface, life gradually returned to normal: classes at the Kaiser Wilhelm Gymnasium; sharing meals at home with his sister, half brother, and stepmother; visits with his Kauffmann grandparents and cousins. Underneath, however, was a void he could not bear to contemplate. At seventeen, Max retreated even further into shyness. Growing up without a mother was a loss that he felt and talked about throughout his life, but it took many years before Max could write about the loss of his father. In the next year, Max finished at the Gymnasium and passed his leaving examination, the Arbitur, the credential needed for admission to a university. Since he had never been an outstanding student, his stepmother was so relieved that she gave him a party, even though she was still in mourning for Gustav. Part of the credit for Max's success belonged to a family friend named Lachmann, a former medical student of Gustav's then in his late thirties. When a Kauffmann cousin had fallen ill some years earlier, Gustav had arranged for the newly accredited Dr. Lachmann to travel with him to Egypt as his medical advisor-and treat his own incipient tuberculosis. Back in Breslau, he became Max's tutor. His specialty was balneology, the therapeutic use of baths. During the busy spring and summer seasons, he supported his family by practicing in the spa town of Bad Landeck; in the winters, he came to Breslau to take courses at the university. Max recalled, \"He was then deeply interested in astronomy and mathematics and it was much as a result of his influence that I took up these subjects. But I owe to him not only the deciding direction of my scientific interest, but also a general widening of my outlook on life.\" For Dr. Lachmann was a socialist, an active member of the Social Democratic Party-at that time, synonymous in most people's eyes with communism. He offered up the troika of Marx, Kant, and Hegel to Max and asked\n\n21\n\n22\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nprobing questions about the contrast in living conditions between Max's family and the workers who streamed out of Grandfather Kauffmann's factories. \"He was not afraid of proffering views which, in our bourgeois society, were still considered despicable.\" Grandfather Kauffmann, who provided well for his workers, had believed that the individual had to fight for his place. Max knew that he, like most other property owners, would have regarded Dr. Lachmann as an \"enemy of society.\" For Max, however, Lachmann offered a window onto a broader world. When he started at the University of Breslau in the fall, he changed his academic course from studying mechanical engineering to philosophy. Schoolboy memories of working with his fret saw and lathe-building little instruments for Dr. Maschke's Gymnasium physics class as well as an entire orchestra for his grandfather-could not compete with \"the ancient metaphysical problems of space and time, matter and causality, the roots of ethics and the existence of God.\" After a broad education in the Gymnasium, a university student was expected to focus immediately on courses related to his future. The German university was organized into separate faculties to facilitate this. Future lawyers studied in the Law Faculty, future doctors in the Medical Faculty, and ministers in the Theology Faculty. The Philosophical Faculty, which Max entered, comprised the sciences, mathematics, humanities, and languages. Students faced few academic requirements: They could move around to different universities, and were not obliged to attend specific courses but only to complete a certain number of terms at one university to be considered for a degree. They ended with only two options: either the state exam for a teaching certificate or the oral for a Ph.D. Gustav Born, considering his own narrow specialization a major shortcoming, had adopted the dictum \"what Hans doesn't learn, Hans never learns.\" Before his death, he counseled his son to explore a variety of intellectual areas. So Max filled his course list at the university with philosophy, the sciences, and mathematics-this last only because it was required for astronomy. His experience with the subject at the Gymnasium had left a bad taste. Max soon saw that his choices did not stand the test of maintaining his interest. Aristotelian logic with syllogisms such as \"All men are mortal; Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal\" seemed to Max \"the epitome of triviality.\" Zoology, physics, chemistry, and climatology bored him. Of the sciences, only astronomy excited him, especially cosmology and the relationship to infinity, but the professor did not focus on this aspect. His penchant was for endless measurements and calculations that Max found less congenial, as his own were full of errors. In front of his fellow students, the professor admonished Max that he needed to take a course in elementary arithmetic. Max's self-confidence and budding interest fizzled.\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\n23\n\nThe lure of higher mathematics was different. Geometry and calculus introduced him to concepts that \"mean nothing unless applied in a definite system of ideas to a definite problem where they can be made significant for that problem.\" At last, he was intrigued and challenged. Whereas the concept of infinity in philosophy had seemed \"veiled in a mist of paradoxes;' infinity in geometry became the symbolic point formed by the intersection of two parallel lines. Here he found stimulating companionship. From these math classes grew a small circle of committed students who talked into the night. In Max's first twelve years in school, he never made a close friend. Those from this math circle would last his lifetime. The social side of university life was dominated by Burschenschaften-male societies or clubs that engaged in traditional drinking and bravado but with a particular German twist-dueling-that harkened to bygone days. Members wore dueling facial scars as badges of honor. When a friend suggested that Max join a literary society true to this custom, he rejected the offer. Dueling, codes of honor, and the exclusively Jewish nature of this particular society were distasteful to him. But Max, who summarized himself as \"sophisticated, shy and therefore lonely;' did allow Dr. Lachmann to coax him into joining a mathematics society that did not require dueling. The group's weekly meetings, held in the back room of a small beer hall that reeked of alcohol and tobacco, began with a dull mathematics lecture. Then the beer hall supplied the fuel for the rest of the evening-drinking games involving rousing renditions of German folk songs and strict ritual, regulated by a mixture of German and Latin, the rules of which required frequently downing a liter of beer. As their vigorous gatherings often led them into collisions with other societies, the group did encourage dueling lessons. Max eventually learned the peculiar art, which in this form was definitely not a sport: Rules called for the duelists to stand motionless except for the rapier arm that could only thrust straight forward, and the knuckles that acted as a pivot for the rapier, the paragon of the stiff Prussian. Making it through one year with no duels and unscarred cheeks was enough of this kind of socializing for Max. Life in the Born family apartment was less appealing for Max without his father. Bertha was still a \"hen who sat on a duck's egg\"-kindly but socially awkward. Eighteen-year-old Kathe was surrounded by their many female cousins and numerous beaux-young men whom Max considered \"priggish.\" Their penchant for reciting Nietzsche and Rilke in dimly lit rooms was too much for him. (Years later, looking back, he would see himself similarly, a \"stupid little prig\" .. . \"primitive, uneducated, inexperienced, and narrow-minded.\") But home served at least one useful purpose: In the parlor before an audience of Bertha, nine-year-old Wolfgang, and Kathe, Max assembled the first of his many trios-a violinist and cellist who joined him in performing Haydn and Mozart.\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\nAs a young adult, Max found the homes of the highly cultured Kauffmann women more alluring. Grandfather Kauffmann had died just after Gustav Born; his daughter-in-law, Luise Kauffmann, took over the family role of symphony benefactor, filling the Kleinburg villa with all the great artists who came to Breslau. On the two Bechstein grand pianos in her music room, Max had the pleasure of hearing Europe's finest pianists. In the old days, Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann, and Joseph Joachim dazzled the audience. Max now listened to the artistry of violinist Pablo de Sarasate and pianists Artur Schnabel and Edwin Fischer. Schnabel's future wife, the singer Therese Behr was usually there. Gustav Mahler made an occasional appearance. At other times, Aunt Luise opened up the villa for sumptuous balls where Max-quite handsome and sophisticated in his tuxedo-danced the quadrille. Across the city in another large villa, his mother's cousin Toni Neisser and her husband, Albert, a physician, maintained a grand salon. With dinner guests such as the poet Gerhard Hauptmann and the composer Richard Strauss, the Neissers listened to poetry and music within frescoed walls painted by the Art Nouveau master Fritz Erler; they moved among beautiful objects from Asia and India. In this rich company, Max was just another set of ears at the table, pleased to listen. \"Villa von Neisser\" was his refuge from home. In his childless \"Aunt\" Toni, the motherless Max found emotional sanctuary as well. She listened to his problems, shored him up, and introduced him with an almost parental pride to her influential friends. One was Albert's cousin Arnold Berliner, a physicist who worked in industry and who encouraged Max to pursue his scientific interests. Probably recognizing the young man's insecurity, Berliner playfully bet him several bottles of wine that in ten years he would be a professor. Berliner, who later became editor of an important scientific journal, often appeared at Max's elbow at small but important moments. The tradition of the wandering medieval German scholars gave Max fairly frequent escapes from Breslau. Students changed universities to match the season, trading the winter term's big-city cultural events for the summer semester's outdoor sports and nature. In April 1902, Max and his cousin Hans Schafer left Breslau for a summer in Heidelberg, nestled between the Neckar River and the hills of the Odenwald. On the hilly street leading up to Heidelberg's old Schloss, Max found a room in a large house, its vestibule guarded by an imposing painting of a knight in armor. Having spent many summers together at Tannhausen (their mothers were sisters), Max and Hans also shared academic interests. Hans's was chemistry, and eventually he would take his interest in textiles and dyeing into the family firm. For now, their concerns were lighthearted. The first day of a mathematics class on determinants, when Max met the young geology student James Franck,\n\nbegan what Max described as a \"happy-go-lucky\" summer. As he said, \"To my cousin Hans and to me it was very soon clear that Franck was our man.\" The three mixed studying with a healthy appreciation for good company, often setting out to picnic on one of the Neckar's rocky islands. Testing their strength, Max and James rowed against the current; Hans, with one arm crippled from a childhood riding accident, helped with steering and navigation. Passersby on the riverbank encouraged the trio with comical cries. After a precarious landing, they might fill the evenings with talking, supping, and playing the three-way card game Skat. On land, they ate and raised steins at local beer halls. At the end of such an evening, they would often commemorate it by sending a postcard to Hans's sister, Helene, in Breslau. One of these, drawn by the slightly unsteady hand of Mackerle (as Max signed himself) portrayed dashing, dueling young men, all sporting mustaches, blood dripping from their epees. That was the beginning of May. By midsummer, when Helene came for a visit and they met her at the Heidelberg train station, James and Max had full beards. They had spent their razor money elsewhere. Max good-naturedly called James \"Noodle-head\" because he could not decide what to study. Although similar in this respect, they were otherwise quite different; James would later describe Max as the classicist and himself as the ro mantic. To Max, James had a cleverness, a \"peculiarly personal charm,\" and was \"the best comrade in all activities.\" James praised Max's \"goodness and intelligence.\" It was a friendship that would endure through extraordinary times. Their happy-go-lucky summer ended with James deciding to study in Berlin and Hans and Max traveling to Italy, where Max suffered an asthma attack. He returned to Breslau to face the recurring dilemma of what career to choose. His blossoming interest in mathematics struck him as all too likely to lead to the discouraging life of a schoolteacher. The more exciting option of becoming a university professor revived his old insecurities. Once again, Dr. Lachmann stepped in. He recognized the family wealth as an opportunity for Max to develop his interests rather than worry about his livelihood. If he failed-and Lachmann did not think he would-Max could fall back on these financial resources. So Max began the winter semester studying mathematics, physics, and astronomy. The following summer he spent in Zurich, dividing his time between hikes in the Alps and brilliant lectures on elliptical functions by the famed professor Adolf Hurwitz. Hurwitz must have recognized Max's promise, for he invited him and another student to his home for private lectures on the theory of functions of complex variables. Professor and student became friends. At Hurwitz's death, Max wrote to his widow, \"The clarity of [your husband's] thoughts opened up for me wide areas of science.\"\n\n24\n\n25\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA HIGH FR DES IRE\n\nAgain Max returned to Breslau for the winter semester. A friend from the math circle, Otto Toeplitz, persuaded him to take a course on algebraic equations-a subject he found interesting, without suspecting how important it would turn out to be. He was more concerned about the Neissers' planned trip to the Dutch East Indies. What was the point of staying in Breslau without their sanctuary and stimulation? Once more, Max, now twenty-one, had to decide where to go and what to study. Munich appealed to him, with mountain climbing in summer and cultural pursuits in winter. He now was leaning towards physics, having taken a course on Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, which he would later describe as \"a bad lecture, but ... fascinating.\" But Otto Toeplitz-whom Max called his \"selfappointed mentor\"-argued for \"pure\" mathematics and more brilliant lectures at the University of Gottingen, where Professor Hurwitz's world-famous students taught. Max did not even know where the university was. Still, he took his friend's advice.\n\nmountains nor Breslau's culture. Instead, the highlights of the town were Bierfests in the sixteenth-century Black Bear Tavern, with sagging half-timbered fa;:ade, and in Die Miitze, a glorious fifteenth-century house converted into a wine bar, covered with rich biblical carvings and secular themes: two among scores of half-timbered buildings. Then there was the graceful statue of the Giinsemiidchen, a young girl holding three geese under her arms and in a basket, with a fountain at her feet and a lovely rococo cupola over her head. The medieval Rathaus, still with massive crenellated walls, dominated the large square in which she gracefully, timelessly carried her wares. The university, completely integrated into the town, brought it prestige. Classroom buildings dotted many narrow winding streets. Boarding rooms or homes of professors' widows housed students. Born recalls the town as \"small and tame,\" but his first impression exiting the train must have bordered on shock. He had gone from balls and symphonies to a rural, medieval town that catered to a renowned university and little else. To his credit, Born adapted quickly and discovered other indulgences-namely, the maelstrom that was Gottingen mathematics. Within days of arriving, he became something new: an insider. On the first day of Born's class with David Hilbert, the professor asked interested students to submit their class notes for consideration as his scribe. The lectures were a creation of the professor, not a recitation from a textbook; in a tradition unique to Gottingen, a student scribe wrote up each lecture for reference in the students' mathematics reading room. Born and about six others volunteered their notes. Thanks to earlier advice from Toeplitz, Born was already well practiced in the art of careful note taking. At the start of the second class, Hilbert announced, \"There is one manuscript by far excelling all the others\" Born's. Born retrieved his notes from Hilbert, embarrassed by the attention but pleased to be chosen. He had taken his first step toward sharing the intellectual enthusiasm of the mandarins. Being Hilbert's scribe meant making regular, invaluable visits to Hilbert's house. Whether he was clarifying his class notes or following as Hilbert worked out his theory of functions, Born witnessed the Hilbert Principle in action: strip any problem of nonessentials, simplify without losing the core, and solve. Properly specifying the problem built a bridge to the solution. As Hilbert said, \"a perfect formulation of a problem is already half its solution:' Of course, this was easier said than done. Hilbert stressed searching for basic laws that provided the underpinning to scientific knowledge. Born's clear, neat hand duly recorded Hilbert's discussion of the axioms of mechanics, which, in his lecture, the professor listed grandly under the title \"the axioms of natural science.\" In the first sentence, Hilbert acknowledged that the task of discovering these axioms was far from complete,\n\n26\n\nGottingen's earth shook, at least figuratively, every Thursday afternoon when the \"mandarins\"-the high priests of mathematics-came together for their walk. Through the years, they had worked out the ritual. At 2:45, Hermann Minkowski left his house on Planckstrasse to walk two blocks to Wilhelm Weberstrasse. Perfectly timed, Felix Klein departed from the far end of Weberstrasse to stroll up the hill toward David Hilbert's front gate. As he walked past, Hilbert would come out so the two could meet Minkowski at the corner of Weberstrasse and Dahlmannstrasse at exactly 3:00. Then they strode up into the hills to have coffee at the Kehrhotel and to settle any raging issues. They were, after all, their generation's luminaries in the world of mathematics. They followed closely in the footsteps of earlier mandarins-Carl Friedrich Gauss, Bernhard Riemann, and P. G. Dirichlet-who had made the University of Gottingen a world-famous center of mathematics in the nineteenth century. Now, those of the twentieth century had inaugurated another era of greatness. Felix Klein's reputation from his masterwork on geometric functions, David Hilbert's from number theory and the foundations of geometry, and Minkowski's from the geometrical theory of numbers had catapulted the university's standing in mathematics beyond that of the University of Berlin. And their personalities enhanced their mathematical renown: Klein, formidable with his leonine beard, supplied bureaucratic clout; Hilbert, exuding energy, offered eccentricity; and Minkowski, pince-nez delicately perched, provided sensitivity. Born arrived in the small Hanoverian town for the beginning of the summer semester in April 1904. Gottingen possessed neither the magnificence of high\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\nbut that such a drawback did not limit his conceptual dream. Without further ado, he addressed himself to mechanics, the area he evidently found most suited to his deductive approach. In his new scribe, Hilbert's concepts fell on a fertile mind. Just as important for Born, Hilbert liked him. Born's introduction to Professor Hermann Minkowski came through family connections: Bertha Born had known the professor since their days together at dancing school in Konigsberg. When Max delivered a letter from her to the Minkowski household, he promptly received an invitation to dinner on Sunday afternoon. Any young student who felt reticent at his first meeting with an esteemed professor was likely to endure a painful visit with the equally reticent Minkowski. Someone as shy as Max Born could expect long awkward silences. Fortunately, the other guest, Dr. Constantin Caratheodory, a young Greek mathematician, charmed his fellow diners with tales of his adventures as a railroad engineer in Egypt. At the end of the dinner, Minkowski invited his guests to join him and his wife for a hike with the Hilberts to Die Burg Plesse, a crumbling medieval fortress a few miles away. Hilbert and Minkowski were close friends, having grown up in Konigsberg together. Through Hilbert's doggedness, they succeeded landing in the same faculty two years earlier. Now they spent Sundays together, enjoying picnics, hikes, or dancing at Maria Spring, a nearby beer garden, always discussing and dissecting as they went. From his first days in Gottingen in 1895, Hilbert had operated outside the behavioral confines of German academia. An inviolate social barrier placed students on one side and professors on the other; they mingled in the lecture hall only. The irrepressible and unorthodox Hilbert invited his students for billiards, walks in the hills, lavish dinners, and afternoons in his splendid garden. While he filled their minds with mathematics, politics, and science, his quirkiness and egotism made him in equal parts challenging and supportive, blunt and dismissive. The stimulating atmosphere surrounding Professor Hilbert fostered the creativity that became Gottingen's hallmark. Born quickly advanced from lecture scribe to assistant. Although one of many recipients of his mentor's intellectual largesse, he was the first to hold this unpaid, semi-official position. Most mornings, Born arrived at Hilbert's house to find Minkowski already there. Together, they framed the general principles of Hilbert's next lecture. Then Hilbert left, believing inspiration would fill in the details as he spoke. Minkowski and Born walked to Minkowski's house, the reticence of their first meeting long over, their conversation invigorated by the morning's mental exercises. When Born had first arrived in Gottingen, he felt too timid to address students two years his senior. Now, as the valued young colleague of two renowned\n\nmathematicians, Born lived in a heady world and thoroughly enjoyed it. As Gottingen lured his mathematical friends from Breslau, he took pleasure in serving as their link, introducing the expanding Breslau Group to Hilbert, Minkowski, Caratheodory, and others in his new circle. His position in the mathematics hierarchy of Gottingen appeared firm. Born had a different relationship with Felix Klein, the oldest of the three luminaries and the administrative hand behind Gottingen's success in mathematics. Felix the Great, as he was nicknamed, had strong ties with the minister of education, from whom he used to win extra resources for Gottingen mathematics. Whereas Hilbert approached each lecture with a few general principles to leave with his students, Klein dazzled with his breadth; as described in Born's words, \"guiding [the students J in endless winding paths through apparently impenetrable ground and halting at each little hilltop to give a survey over the area covered.\" Some students preferred Klein's courses to Hilbert's, but Born found them \"too brilliant\" (although later, his attitude shifted). Every time he signed up for one he found himself skipping. Unfortunately, as he would discover, even in a crowded hall, Klein noticed who was missing. With the support of Hilbert and Minkowski, Born aimed for a Ph.D. in pure mathematics. In his second semester there, he took Hilbert's course, The Quadrature of the Circle, which examined unsolved problems in mathematics. Born gave an excellent presentation of Hilbert's proof of the transcendental character of the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter-that is, that 1T cannot be constructed with a compass and ruler. For Born's dissertation topic, Hilbert suggested that he work out the proof of the transcendental character of the roots of the wavelike Bessel function. (Mathematically, transcendental has a clear meaning: in this case, that no algebraic equation with integral coefficients exists that has 1T as its root.) Weeks later, Born confessed to Hilbert that he could not solve the problem, that his skill at writing out mathematical presentations outpaced his ability to formulate this one. Hilbert's response-which Born later remembered simply as thoughtless and stinging-led Born to reexamine his mathematical ability. He decided that he had no genuine gift. He did not despair-his recent successes had been too encouraging for that-but decided to explore the possibilities of applying mathematics to science. Particularly in Gottingen, where mathematics was the master discipline, the boundaries between pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and the natural sciences were a blur. The tentacles of the mathematicians (who were only \"pure\" some of the time) regularly reached into the realm of physics, if in distinctively different ways. These mathematicians were academic descendants of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who advocated expanding mathematical thought and applying advances to unsolved problems in physics. Hilbert, who once pronounced that\n\n30\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WOR L D\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\nphysics was too important to be left to physicists, made \"the mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics\" number six out of twenty-three in his famous 1900 list of unsolved mathematical problems that could fundamentally contribute to the future development of the field. Minkowski had, throughout his career, investigated purely physical phenomena such as rigid bodies. A few years later, in his famous contribution to the development of relativity, he would write of \"the pre-established harmony between pure mathematics and physics.\" Above all, Klein focused on the importance of mathematics to technological advances. For years he had worked to create an alliance for educating personnel who were mathematically sophisticated and could direct technological advancement in Germany. Gottingen professors often offered interdisciplinary seminars to explore a specific physical problem. In the winter semester of 1904-1905, Klein and the professors of applied mechanics Carl Runge and Ludwig Prandtl held a seminar on elasticity, in keeping with Klein's philosophy of practical mathematical application. The following summer semester, Hilbert, Minkowski, and Emil Wiechert, professor of geophysics, explored the theory of electrons. Born participated in both, and, as he later wrote, \"my science future was determined, [but] not by my deliberate choice.\" The seminar on elasticity-the physical property that allows materials to return to their original configuration when stress is removed- did not in itself compel Born. He found it too applied, too practical, bordering on technical aspects with little importance to the deeper questions of science. Intending to remain in the background, he was thwarted by a requirement that all participants had to either present or be someone's deputy on a particular theme. He became the deputy for the topic of \"the stability of the elastic line,\" and when the presenter, Arthur Haas, pleaded illness only a week before the presentation, Born had to replace him. Whether Haas was truly ill or simply afraid of Klein-the cause for much \"illness\"-Born could not be sure. Since Haas had little research to pass on, Born gave up on a literature review and in the short time left resorted to Hilbert's method: simplify the problem and solve. He began with the simple case of a wire with both ends fixed. His problem was to determine which curved configuration of the wire would minimize potential energy and thus be the most stable. For his analytical method, he drew on Hilbert's course on the calculus of variations-the mathematician's answer to complex minimization problems. Born determined the set of differential equations for the stability conditions of the curve and systematically solved for the specific case. The presentation was a success, and Klein was pleased. When the term ended in March, Born left for Breslau. A week later came a letter from Gottingen. \"Dear Herr Born! ... We, the Philosophy Faculty, will probably arrange for an\n\nexamination of the Stability of the Elastica in a Plane and Space as the prize exercise for the year 1905/1906.\" The thesis submitted for the prize could also double as a dissertation. Would Born be a student until Easter 1906-a year away-and thus be an eligible competitor? Not waiting for his reply, or perhaps anticipating it, the letter ended, \"Anyway, it would probably be good if you familiarize yourself more thoroughly with this problem over the Easter holidays.\" Signed, \"Your devoted, F. Klein.\" The prize in question was a prestigious award that rotated among the university's many departments. As these included the humanities and sciences as well as mathematics, Klein's group rarely had the opportunity to determine the subject. By choosing the stability of the elastic line, Klein had chosen one dear to his heart, a topic that promoted broadening the attitudes of mathematicians. With more promptness than judgment, Born sent Klein his regrets. He wrote back politely rejecting the professor's suggestion, asserting that his research interests lay elsewhere. Born and his circle of friends, who thought of themselves as mathematical purists, agreed that \"Klein's predilection for applied mathematics\" was a waste of his gifts, a product of his political ambitions. In their view, \"students of minor mathematical gifts but greater adaptability were preferred and promoted by Klein if they flattered his partiality for applications.\" Even though Born had failed at his first dissertation topic on the Bessel function, he obviously did not consider his own talents minor. Yet his newfound confidence exposed tremendous naivete and lack of intuition about people. At best, Klein would take Born's response to such a flattering invitation as cheeky and tactless. If Klein had already mentioned Born's name to his colleagues, he would feel blatantly insulted. When Born returned to Gottingen a month later, he was pelted with questions. What had he done, his friends wanted to know, to perturb Felix the Great? Why was one of Gottingen's most powerful professors casting aspersions on Born's character? The laughter that greeted his explanation soon turned grim. In Germany, Klein's goodwill could propel careers, and his antagonisms could end them. Clearly, Born had tipped the balance in the wrong direction. Born spent the summer semester trying to repair the damage. He visited Klein to make amends and offered to analyze the elastica problem, but his contrition was no balm for Klein's anger. The imperious professor treated Born like a naughty schoolboy, stating in icy tones that he was not interested in what Born did. He let his errant student struggle in misery. Aside from the Klein problem, the summer semester had its rewards. Professors Hilbert, Minkowski, and Wiechert, and a young lecturer named Gustav Herglotz, held a seminar on electrodynamics to further the understanding of the electron and the new microscopic world that was just beginning to unfold.\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\nThe macroscopic world described by mechanics, electromagnetics, and thermodynamics had a new microscopic rival. Max was one of about fifteen participants to discuss the hottest topic in contemporary physics. Cambridge physicist J. J. Thomson had discovered the electron, the first subatomic particle, in 1897. Eight years later, many scientists were not convinced of the existence of atoms, let alone electrons. The discoveries of other particles, such as protons and neutrons, and of the nucleus, which would help make the invisible atom comprehensible, remained years away. Yet some physicists had begun to see electrons as central to a view of the physical world that might provide a new foundation for physics. The electron is a negatively charged particle, its motion giving rise to an electromagnetic field. Physicists firmly believed that this field spread out through and was supported by the ether, an indetectable medium assumed to fill space. They did not know if the electron had real physical mass or if its apparent mass was due to its motion, but experiments seemed consistent with the latter concept, raising the possibility that electromagnetism could explain and therefore, in effect, subsume mechanics-that is, instead of embracing an overarching mechanical worldview, these scientists championed an overarching electromagnetic worldview. It was a clash over the fundamentals for understanding nature, centered on the electron. The small group in Gottingen-perhaps the largest concentration of theorists focusing on the theory of the electron and including some of the best mathematical brains in the world-had an opportunity to resolve some of these questions percolating through the scientific community. For every theory about the electron, there seemed to be a countertheory, each with a different implication for how the universe and its myriad phenomena worked together-that for this group translated into how the electron's properties would be mathematically modeled. Some physicists played with its motion: Did it rotate, were they small or large rotations, did it vibrate? Some looked at its velocity: Could it travel faster than the speed of light, and if so, what were the ramifications? Was the speed of light a constant? The shape of the electron and the distribution of its charge mattered for the models. Some hypothesized that the electron was rigid, others that it was deformable-that is, that its shape would contract as its velocity increased. In a famous theory offered by one of the most respected theoreticians, Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz suggested that matter could be deformed. This was his explanation for the unexpected results of experiments by Americans Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. They had designed an experiment to detect the ether that physicists were sure filled space and carried electromagnetic waves. Assuming that the Earth moved through the ether and created a wind, they\n\nconstructed an instrument with equilength, perpendicular arms that could measure the time traveled by a ray of light as it went across the ether wind up and down one arm compared to the time light went through the ether back and forth on the second arm. The rays were like two men in rowboats, one going across the river's current and back and the other going the same distance and rowing up and down the river. The man rowing across the current always makes the trip faster. That was the expectation with the light rays, too-that resistance from the ether would be greater for the one moving \"upstream\"-but it did not hold. Both rays made the trip in the same amount of time. The instrument, known as an interferometer, floated on a bed of mercury to ensure a frictionless environment necessary to validate the experiment. Since there had to be an ether to propagate electromagnetic waves-just as sound waves need air and ocean waves need water-why did it offer no resistance, detectable as ether drift or wind? Lorentz's answer was that motion through the stationary ether must cause a deformation of matter in the parallel arm that exactly offset the amount of resistance. This hypothesis caused him to rethink the whole concept of actions relative to one another in what he called \"local time\" (valid in a moving frame of reference). There was no doubt in his mind that if one could experiment outside of one's own frame of reference, an ether drift would exist in absolute time. Lorentz developed transformation equations to describe the physics of moving frames of reference, which would become central in the continuing investigation between space and time. The Gottingen group saw itself as potentially in a position to resolve these issues and thereby establish the basis of physical nature. The excitement of the quest permeated their electron seminar. Minkowski began to bore into relationships between space and time, presenting some original ideas to the class. Meanwhile, a few hundred miles away in Bern, Switzerland, a twenty-six-yearold patent clerk named Albert Einstein was thinking about the speed of light and about objects moving at a constant speed relative to one another. In only a few months he would publish his own ideas on the relativity of time and space that would reframe the debate yet again. Electron theory, the structure of matter, fascinated Born. He wanted to write his dissertation on it but was too shaken by the Klein fiasco to concentrate on work. Instead, he fled to Gottingen's beautiful parks with their summer orchestras and operettas, dancing in the beer garden at Maria Spring, and horseback riding in the hills. A phenomenal sight reader, he played transcriptions of operas by Bizet and Wagner and Schubert sonatas endlessly on the piano in his room. Summer soon turned to fall, and the winter term began with Born still aimless. He signed up for some courses, including one of Klein's\n\n34\n\n35\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\non geometry, attended haphazardly as usual, when he realized that once again he was an outsider. Among Gottingen's famous minor institutions was its Mathematics Society, cofounded by Felix Klein to discuss new ideas in mathematics. That year's members, ironically, included most of Born's friends. Every Tuesday night after the meeting, Born had to listen to their animated discussions. As much as he wanted to join the society, he did not dare. Otto Toeplitz (who had come to Gottingen a year after Born) agreed that Klein probably would veto him. Toeplitz offered a solution. \"If you got the prize and your degree, I don't think Klein could object to your admission.\" Born took the matter too seriously to realize until much later that Toeplitz was manipulating him. What he did see was that to be free to pursue what compelled him, he had to finish his dissertation. And if he tried for the faculty prize on the stability of the elastic line, perhaps he would appease Klein. The conclusion was easy: His dissertation topic had to be the stability of the elastic line. Only one obstacle remained. Since elasticity was Klein's interest-as opposed to Hilbert's or Minkowski's-Born would have to ask Klein to be his dissertation supervisor. With his heart in his mouth, Born went to see Klein. \"Why not?\" Klein responded. \"But I doubt if you know enough geometry to pass the oral [Ph.D.] exam. You have never attended my lectures.\" Born was thunderstruck: How could Klein have noticed his absence among the 100 students in the class? He countered defensively that he had read the books, to which Klein retorted, \"How many inflexion points has the general curve of the third order?\" Intimidated, unable to answer, Born left in despair. Born convened his friends in a \"council of war\" to find a solution. Their reasoning was characteristically creative: Since Klein was in pure mathematics, Born could avoid him as a member of the oral examination committee, according to the rules, by asking Carl Runge, who was in applied mathematics, to be his supervisor. This Born did, and Runge agreed. Astronomy professor Karl Schwarzschild and physics professor Woldemar Voigt, from whom Born had taken a course on optics, became the other examiners. Born then set to work researching the elastic line. His first hurdle, the deadline for the prize, was April 1. Throughout the winter he sweated through solving complex equations by applying once again the abstract methods of the calculus of variations, as he had done in Klein's seminar on elasticity six months earlier. He worked entirely alone. To keep submissions for the prize anonymous from the faculty judges meant advice from professors was forbidden. Born built his analysis step by step, from the simplest case to the most difficult. He expanded on the two-dimensional stability conditions in his earlier report (where the wire was fixed at both ends) to complex analyses, where his\n\nhypothetical wire could loop, arch, and swoop, depending on the pressure exerted and restraints on the wire. After weeks of developing equations and churning through the calculus, he was able to predict the stability conditions that minimized potential energy. A month before the deadline for the prize, his curiosity heightened. Born designed a simple apparatus to test his predictions and had a local firm construct it. One end of a thin metal strip was clamped onto a lever that, in turn, was anchored to a dial, and the other end was attached to a long rod with a weight on it. The lever could move to a different angle so that the wire would bend in different directions; the other end could attach to different points along the rod, thereby increasing or decreasing the weight; and the length of the metal strip could vary. To stress the wire almost to the breaking point became a balancing act. As Born spent nights calculating and days experimenting with his new contraption, he watched the metal wire gracefully bend and loop when he changed the length of the wire, the direction of the loop from the lever, and the weight at the other end. His predictions held: He had passed his own test, confirming his theory by experiment-\"a moment of deepest satisfaction;' as he later put it. On the front of his prize article, Born quoted two lines from Goethe's Faust: Irrtum verlasst uns nie; doch ziehet ein hoher Bediirfnis Immer den strebenden Geist leise zur Wahrheit hinan. Error never leaves us; still, a higher desire gently draws the striving spirit always closer to the truth.\n\nBorn probably learned the lines from his father. Entries for the competition were judged during the following two months. On June 13, 1906, Born stood anxiously by the door of the anteroom to the Aula, the university's grand ceremonial hall. Inside, Gottingen's academic community gathered under the ornately coffered ceiling. He did not venture to sit among them. Listening to the rector's long-winded speech, waiting to learn who had won the Philosophy Faculty Prize, he finally heard his own name. The prizewinner did not celebrate. In a few weeks he had to take the oral Ph.D. exam. On July 11, 1906, Born arrived at the Aula at 6:00 P.M. wearing the requisite formal dress suit, top hat, and white gloves. He entered the room and shook hands with the three professors sitting around the long table. With the first two-Runge and Voigt-questions went smoothly. After asking an hour's worth of questions on such topics as the roots of numbers, function theory, Cauchy's integrals, and the calculus of variations, Runge wrote on his evaluation sheet, \"The candidate showed himself very well versed.\" After Voigt's half-hour\n\n36\n\n37\n\nTHE END OF THE CERTAIN WORLD\n\nA HIGHER DESIRE\n\nexam concluded much the same way, Born was relaxed and confident. The astronomer Schwarzschild began by asking Born, \"What would you do if you saw a falling star?\" Born answered, \"I'd make a wish.\" Though the others chortled, Schwarzschild was not amused and pressed his question. Born realized his impudence, collected himself, and answered satisfactorily. For his impressive work, the professors awarded him the Ph.D. in mathematics magna cum laude. Yet even with this degree, he knew he could not be a mathematician a la Hilbert or Minkowski. Just what he could be was not entirely clear to him. This time, Born did celebrate. He stayed around long enough to toast his triumph with his friends at Andreasberg, the famous guesthouse north of Gottingen. Then he left, vowing never to return. As one friend put it, Klein had \"broken his enthusiasm.\"\n\nkaiser slowly reviewed the long lines of his resplendent troops. What grander way for a king to celebrate his forty-eighth birthday? Born had never questioned service to his country because military duty had little moral or practical implication. It was expected of him, just as it was accepted within his bourgeois world that European wars were events of the past. Standing there, watching the pomp, however, Born recalled his father's description of his wartime service-of being \"a little cog in a little wheel in the big military machinery,\" and the resulting \"degradation of human dignity.\" As he waited to pay homage to the kaiser along with thousands of other soldiers, his father's quiet but passionate disagreement with militarism became his own. Born's service as a Dragoon was short-lived. The cold of January 27 led to an asthma attack, and he was discharged early for health reasons. He returned to Breslau, where he found his cousin Hans Schafer planning a trip to England for the Kauffmann textile firm. It was just"
