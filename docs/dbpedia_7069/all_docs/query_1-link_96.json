The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in room 406, Senate Dirksen Building, Hon. James N. Inhofe (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Senators Inhofe, Bennett, Voinovich, Boxer, and Chafee [ex officio]. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES M. INHOFE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA Senator Inhofe. The subcommittee will come to order. At today's hearing we are going to examine the recommendations of the Environmental Protection Agency's Blue Ribbon Panel Advisory Committee on the use of Oxygenates in Gasoline on MTBE. MTBE is a fuel additive used to add oxygen to gasoline. The Clean Air Act requires reformulated gasoline, RFG, to contain 2 percent oxygen by weight. MTBE is used in over 85 percent of the RFG, and ethanol is the second largest at 8 percent. The requirement for RFG began in 1995, as mandated by the 1990 Clean Air amendments. In the last few years, MTBE has been found in drinking water sources, and it is my understanding that the great majority of the levels found are well below the public health concerns, although they create a problem with odor and taste. Because of these water-related concerns, the use of MTBE has been questioned. In March 1999, Governor Gray Davis issued an executive order that will eliminate MTBE from California's gasoline by the end of 2002. There are various legislative options in Congress for dealing with MTBE. These range from an outright ban, to phase- out, to making oxygenates optional. Over the last 2 years the full committee has held two hearings addressing the concerns in California; today is the first time for our subcommittee to consider the MTBE program nationwide. We will be hearing from members of the Blue Ribbon Panel and other representatives. The EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel issued their report on July 29, 1999. The findings of the report have, in my opinion, been mischaracterized by both the press and the Senate. It is my understanding that the panel's recommendation for an orderly phase-down in the use of MTBE was dependent upon the repeal of the Federal oxygenate mandate. It is my hope that the ultimate goal of today's hearing is for the members of the committee to understand fully what the report says and does not say regarding MTBE. Recently the Department of Energy identified several areas of concern for the U.S. refining industry, including the uncertainty of the role of oxygenates, particularly MTBE in gasoline. I think it is important that we do not jump to any rash conclusions out of unfounded fear or unjustified claims of fuel alternatives. We should not act in haste on the MTBE issue because the potential impacts to the consumer are significant. The safeguarding of the nationwide supply and distribution of gasoline must be a key consideration in any action that is taken to address MTBE. I believe that one of the most important lessons to be learned from the current situation is that prescriptive mandates reduce flexibility and may lead to unintended consequences. There are a number of issues and questions that I would like addressed, both today and in the coming weeks and months. First, what are the health concerns of MTBE--not the talk, but the real health concerns? Are there benefits to the air from MTBE or other oxygenates, and are they necessary? Are there specific negative environmental effects from MTBE? What is the impact of MTBE and other oxygenates on the fuel supply and delivery system? Since MTBE was required under the Clean Air Act, if we ban or phase out, should we compensate for stranded cost of investment of the MTBE producers? And last, what impact will States' efforts to address MTBE have on the gasoline and distribution system? Senator Inhofe. We have an excellent slate of witnesses today, including the chairman of the Blue Ribbon Panel and former Senator Jake Garn. This is probably not the last time we will address the MTBE or oxygenates issue. We will probably be having a hearing on the environmental effects of ethanol. Senator Chafee, do you have an opening statement you would like to make? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN H. CHAFEE, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND Senator Chafee. I do. I am delighted that you are having this hearing, Mr. Chairman. I want to welcome our witnesses, especially our former colleague from Utah, Senator Jake Garn. It's so nice to see you here once again. The full committee held a hearing on MTBE last year. Since then, as you mentioned, much has happened. In March, Governor Davis in California ordered the State to phase out MTBE use by the end of 2002. In July, the Blue Ribbon Panel issued its report on the use of oxygenates in gasoline. Those findings have served to guide the debate about the future of MTBE, the 2 percent mandate, and the problems with leaking underground storage tanks. In August, the future of MTBE was even debated on the Senate Floor. In that debate I urged the Senate to move forward cautiously, guided by the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel. It is important that we not rush to judgment, as you indicated, Mr. Chairman, or make hasty decisions, but I believe we have to address this problem. The future of the program, the progress we've made on air quality and public confidence in our water supply, all depend upon resolving this question about the use of oxygenates in gasoline. I want to stress that this is not a ``California only'' problem. MTBE has been found in water supplies in 26 States, including my State of Rhode Island. Much of it comes from leaking underground storage tanks, which were required by law to be upgraded or closed by December 22, 1998. MTBE contamination of water is most acute in the 17 States that use reformulated gasoline. Air quality benefits of reformulated gasoline have been substantial. Toxics and ozone-forming compounds have been reduced dramatically. Last year, in a full committee hearing, I called for the 2 percent mandate to be lifted. I am glad to see that the Blue Ribbon Panel agreed with me in that recent report. We look forward to hearing what they have to say. I want to thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I would submit this entire statement for the record. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Chairman Chafee. Senator Boxer. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. Thank you so much to both my chairmen, my subcommittee chair and the full committee chair. I am really glad to have the opportunity to make some remarks. It is a very serious issue. I think I have a slightly different view than my friends, and I want to lay it out, if I might. After I asked Administrator Browner to phase out MTBE, she appointed the Blue Ribbon Panel, and I am very pleased that my reading of the panel's report suggests my view, that we would be better off without MTBE. Specifically, on the question of whether MTBE use should continue, the panel report states: The panel agreed broadly that in order to minimize current and future threats to drinking water, the use of MTBE should be reduced substantially. Several members believe that the use of MTBE should be phased out completely. I first formed a view that we should phase out MTBE in 1997, after the city of Santa Monica lost 71 percent of its drinking water supply due to MTBE contamination. And I want to say to both my Chairmen, I can assure you that if one of the cities in your State was faced with that situation, of losing 71 percent of their water supply, I think perhaps you would be closer to my view. Now, on August 4, 1999, the majority of the U.S. Senate joined with me in expressing the view that we should phase out MTBE. We adopted my Sense of the Senate; it provided that ``The United States should phase out MTBE in order to address the threats that MTBE poses to public health and the environment.'' And I would like to place the text of this Sense of the Senate into the hearing record, Mr. Chairman, if I might. Senator Inhofe. Without objection. Senator Boxer. Thank you. Senator Boxer. The Sense of the Senate counted Senator Crapo, Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Drinking Water Subcommittee, among its cosponsors, and for good reason. This issue is, first and foremost, a drinking water issue, because MTBE is contaminating drinking water. I would like to place into the hearing record the testimony of the Association of California Water Agencies, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, and the South Tahoe Public Water Utility District. Senator Inhofe. Without objection. Senator Boxer. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Boxer. These agencies wanted to testify today, but there wasn't time to have a panel on water quality, so I am putting their statements in the record. Why does MTBE pose a threat to drinking water and public health? First, in 1997, MTBE was the second-most produced chemical in the United States, so it's out there, in the environment, in huge quantities. Second, MTBE is classified by the EPA as a possible human carcinogen. The University of California has also concluded that MTBE is an animal carcinogen and has the potential to cause cancer in humans. I would like to place a peer-reviewed MTBE report, prepared by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, in today's hearing record. I would like to place, Mr. Chairman, a peer-reviewed MTBE report prepared by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment in today's hearing record. Senator Inhofe. Without objection, so ordered. Senator Boxer. Thank you. This report details and summarizes the health studies underlying the agency's recommendation, that California adopt an MTBE public health drinking water standard of 13 parts per billion. This standard is more protective than EPA's current non-binding standard of up to 40 parts per billion. So California is way ahead, in my view, in terms of protecting the public health, way ahead of where we are at the EPA, and I am very disappointed about that. To summarize what I've said so far, MTBE is dangerous and it is widely used. Another reason is that it is also very hard to control. When MTBE leaks from an underground storage tank, from a motorboat, or from a gas tank after a car accident, into the groundwater, it moves through that water very fast and very far. It extends well beyond the area of a typical gasoline groundwater plume. Also, unlike the other constituents of gasoline, it resists degrading once it is in the water. Moreover, it only takes a very small amount of this widely-used chemical to contaminate a drinking water source. For example, in Maine--I'm not talking about California, in Maine--about 7 to 12 gallons of gas containing MTBE spilled during a car accident and contaminated 24 nearby private drinking water wells. Twelve of those wells showed contamination above Maine's MTBE drinking water standard. And it takes even less MTBE to render water undrinkable. MTBE causes water to take on the taste and smell of turpentine at very low levels. Consumers can taste MTBE in their water at as low as 5 parts per billion. That is equivalent to less than a tablespoon of MTBE in an Olympic-size pool. I have an example of this from Santa Monica. This is what their water smells like. I thought it would be interesting to smell it. [Laughter.] Senator Boxer. If you could pass it on to Senator Bennett. I think it's important, because--here's the point I'm trying to make--even at 5 parts per billion, this stuff ruins the water in terms of your perception of it. People will not drink it if it smells that way. It smells like turpentine. What is the extent of MTBE contamination in the Nation? And, Mr. Chairman, I am winding down, you will be happy to know. Since the Santa Monica catastrophe, South Lake Tahoe, CA has lost 13 of its 34 drinking water wells to MTBE contamination. Santa Clara County in the Silicon Valley has detected MTBE at over 400 groundwater sites, many of which are near public water supply wells. In 1998, a study conducted by Lawrence Livermore determined that MTBE is leaking at 10,000 sites in California. But MTBE contamination is not just a California problem, as I have said before. Maine has determined that between 1,000 and 4,300 private wells may contain MTBE. In New Hampshire, MTBE has been detected in more than 100 public wells and water supplies. Suffolk County Water Utility in New York, which serves 1.2 million customers entirely with groundwater, tells me that 80 percent of its wells show detectable levels of MTBE. Overall, the panel report states that the USGS estimates that between 5 and 10 percent of drinking water supplies now show MTBE contamination. I believe that is a low-end estimate, and I can get into why I believe that, but I won't go into it in the statement. So again, to summarize, the chemical is out there; it's out there in large quantities; it has the potential to cause cancer in humans; it can render drinking water undrinkable, as I think you would agree, at very low levels. And one more point. We know that the potential cleanup costs are already astronomical. A University of California study in 1998 estimated cleanup costs could run as high as $1.5 billion just in California. Mr. Chairman, we all care about balancing the budget. Why would we want to put more of this stuff out there when we already know the cleanup costs are $1.5 billion? Now, I had further discussions. The authors of the studies believe they have underestimated the cleanup costs. They believe they could be 20 to 30 percent higher than that estimate. Some argue that replacing gasoline storage tanks is the answer, but even new tanks have problems. A July 22, 1999 study by Santa Clara Valley Water District, in fact, found that many of its new tanks are leaking. The study reviewed a total of 28 sites with fully upgraded storage tank systems, to observe whether MTBE had leaked. MTBE was detected in groundwater at 13 of these sites at concentrations ranging from 1 part per billion to 200,000 parts per billion. I would like to place that study into the record. Senator Inhofe. Without objection. Senator Boxer. So upgrading the tanks isn't the full answer, and neither will legislation which would amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate the oxygen requirement, but not ban MTBE--that's not the answer. The argument behind such legislation is that if we give oil companies the flexibility to make reformulated gas without an oxygenate, they will voluntarily stop using MTBE. A story from the San Francisco Bay area, however, shows we can't rely upon the oil companies to voluntarily stop using it. Even though oxygenated gas is not required to be used in the San Francisco Bay area, in May of this year it was disclosed that Chevron and Tosco were adding large quantities of MTBE to their gasoline in order to stretch gasoline supplies. So they didn't have to do it; they know the controversy--Governor Davis had already acted to say he was going to phase it out, and they used it anyway. And I would like to place an L.A. Times story detailing this incident into the record at this time. Senator Inhofe. Without objection. Senator Boxer. As a result of the action of Chevron and Tosco, an area of California we could have hoped would be spared MTBE contamination may now also face significant threat. In conclusion, I believe there are two ways to end MTBE use. First, Congress should pass a phase-out schedule; or second, Administrator Browner could use her emergency authority to phase it out, and I'm very sorry that she hasn't done so. I have introduced legislation which would phase out MTBE in stages beginning January 1, 2000, and adopting equal interim reductions each year until the phase-out deadline is completed on January 1, 2003. The DOE predicts it would take approximately 4 years to allow refiners to re-tool their facilities and increase ethanol production in the United States in order to implement such a phase-out, so my bill is in the ball park in terms of its timeframe. MTBE is destroying water supplies throughout the Nation. MTBE cleanup costs are astronomical. MTBE is harming our lakes. MTBE is dangerous to your health. MTBE should be phased out. Clean air is crucial to the health of our citizens; so is a safe drinking water supply. We need to do both--not one, but both. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement and article submitted by Senator Boxer follow:] Statement of Hon. Barbara Boxer, U.S. Senator from the State of California Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing today. After I asked Administrator Browner to phase out MTBE, she appointed the Blue Ribbon Panel.

Thank you. ______ [From the Los Angeles Times, May 7, 1999] MTBE Put In Gas (By Jennifer Warren) Sacmamento--Just as Gov. Gray Davis Was declaring MTBE an environmental hazard and ordering it phased out of gasoline, two oil companies were increasing amounts of the controversial ad?ditive in gas sold in Northern California. Officials at Chevron Corp. and Tosco Corp. confirmed the boost in MTBE, saying it was necessary to stretch their gasoline supply after refinery fires and marketplace factors reduced production. The move enabled the companies to keep a high volume of their gasoline flowing to market in March and April, when pump prices spiked to more than $2 a gallon in some parts of California. Chevron and Tosco officials defended the move as a temporary measure to help them serve customers during a short-term emergency. And while MTBE--a possible carcinogen--is scheduled to be banned in California, adding more of it to gasoline now is not illegal. Critics, including a state senator, condemned the tactic, accusing the companies of putting profits ahead of public fears of a chemical that has contaminated drinking water wells throughout the state. They also call the move hypocritical because both oil companies have been leaders in making MTBE-free gasoline. Last month, Tosco held a press conference to publicize its delivery of MTBE-free gasoline to Union 76 stations in the Lake Tahoe area. It also sells MTBE-free gas in three Bay Area counties. Chevron, meanwhile, had been supplying MTBE-free gasoline to much of Northern California. About half of the gasoline produced at its Richmond refinery is typically made without MTBE. ``These are companies that have been making MTBE-free gas for quite awhile, so why are they doing this?'' said state Sen. Don Perata (D- Alameda). ``It's pure economics. The price is high and they're stretching their supply by adding more MTBE. . . . It's hard not to be cynical about it.'' Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa (D-Los Angeles) expressed similar concerns: ``They seem to be sending mixed signals here. There's no formal MTBE ban yet, but this is obviously taking us in the wrong direction.'' MTBE is a key component of ``cleaner-burning gasoline,'' which has laden used in most of California's 24 million vehicles since 1996,. While credited with reducing auto emissions, MTBE has leaked from underground storage tanks to contaminate drinking water from Santa Monica to Lake Tahoe. It also taints lakes by entering the water from two-stroke engines such as those that power water scooters. Although other components of gasoline also seep from subterranean tanks, MTBE is a particular peril because it travels into ground water so quickly. Its health effects on humans are poorly understood, but it has been shown to cause cancer in mice and rats. Responding to a rising clamor, the Governor declared in late March that MTBE poses a ``significant risk'' to the environment and ordered it phased out in California by the end of 2002. Davis was traveling Thursday and had no immediate comment on the new developments. A spokeswoman noted that Davis has publicly urged companies to voluntarily remove MTBE from gasoline before the deadline. The boost in MTBE usage by Chevron and Tosco came to light after Perata--acting on a tip--asked an East Bay water district to take samples of gasoline at three service stations in early April. The samples showed that various grades of gas at the stations--in San Francisco and Oakland--contained levels of MTBE as high as 15 percent, the legal limit. Company officials did not dispute the findings, and acknowledge that they represent an increase. MTBE typically makes up about 10 to 11 percent of Tosco's gasoline, while much of Chevron's Northern California gas had previously contained no MTBE, officials said. The exception to that is in Sacramento, where clean air rules mandate an 11 percent concentration of the smog-fighting additive. Mixing in more MTBE was one of many steps the companies took in response to a gas supply shortage that hit in March, officials said. The shortage was caused in part by a Feb. 23 explosion that closed Tosco's Martinez refinery and a fire at Chevron's Richmond refinery on March 25. Al Jessel, a Chevron fuels specialist, said the fire cut the refinery's capacity by 10 percent to to 15 percent, forcing officials to hunt for ways to stretch supply. In addition to blending in more MTBE, Chevron ``bought every gallon of gasoline we could find from anyone anywhere in the world.'' If the company had not added more MTBE, the result would have been an even tighter supply and even higher prices, Jessel said. ``We had to make a balance in our minds between having, MTBE-free gas and running out of gas and being unable to supply our customers,'' said Jessel, adding that Chevron has since found new sources of gasoline and is no longer mixing in more MTBE. At Tosco, spokesman Duane Bordvick said his company went to similar lengths to cope with the supply crunch. He took issue with critics who suggest that adding more MTBE was an environmental sin. ``Tosco is doing an awful lot to get MTBE out of gasoline. We've been a leader in the industry,'' Bordvick said. ``But I don't think increasing it up to the legal limit over a period of days has any impact.'' At Communities for a Better Environment, staff scientist Azibuike Akaba disagreed and called the companies' action ``extremely irresponsible.'' ``We've already got a terrible contamination problem with MTBE,'' said Akaba, whose San Francisco-based nonprofit group has been a critic of MTBE since 1991. ``The more they put in, the worse it gets.'' Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Boxer. Senator Bennett. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT F. BENNETT, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Bennett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to look forward to the testimony of the witnesses. I hope when we finally come down to a decision here, it is based on sound science, based on a full understanding of all of the aspects of the issue. I cannot help but reflect on an experience that occurred before I came to the Congress but that nonetheless, I think, had lasting impact. This was the concern about Alar on apples, and the Congress received a great deal of testimony, some of it from Academy Award-winning actresses, about the terrible effects on human health from Alar being sprayed on apples. Congress reacted to that testimony, and Alar was banned. The apple crop for that particular season was ruined. I talked with the individual in Utah who handles food for the homeless, and he said, ``That was a great boon for us, because we received all the apples that could not be sold in the supermarkets that were perfectly wonderful food, that had no contamination to them at all, and had been taken off the market as a result of panic. And that was fine, in that we had food to distribute to the homeless, but once the science caught up with the rhetoric, we found out we had made a serious mistake.'' I get very nervous anytime we get into any of these kinds of hearings, to make sure that the science catches up with the rhetoric. And if we come out with a sound scientific answer this morning as a result of the balanced witnesses we're going to hear, I will be very grateful and I will be happy to support an appropriately scientific answer to what is a very troubling and difficult kind of question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Boxer. Would the Senator yield for one point? I would not send this to a homeless shelter. I mean, you're talking about a different situation. You're talking about a city that has 71 percent of its water supply finished, closed off, shut down. You're not talking about theory here. Also, I hope my friend would read the scientific reports that we have placed in the record. Senator Bennett. I will read those. Senator Boxer. I think it's part of the balance that he's looking for. Senator Bennett. I will read the scientific report. I have relatives who live in Santa Monica. They continue to drink the water, but I'll look forward to hearing from them, I'm sure, as this thing goes on. Senator Boxer. Well, we do deliver clean water to those people. Those wells are closed, but the rest of it is fine. Senator Inhofe. Our first witness was the chairman of the Blue Ribbon Panel. Mr. Greenbaum, we appreciate very much your being here today. As you can see, there are some clarifications that we are looking to you to take care of for us. We're going to have four witnesses today. What we're going to do is ask the witnesses to try to confine their opening statements to 5 minutes, and we will use the lighting system here. However, your entire statement will be entered in as a part of the record. We will also have 5-minute rounds, and we will try to hold ourselves to that same timeframe. Mr. Greenbaum. STATEMENT OF DANIEL S. GREENBAUM, PRESIDENT, HEALTH EFFECTS INSTITUTE, CAMBRIDGE, MA, AND FORMER CHAIR, BLUE RIBBON PANEL ON THE USE OF OXYGENATES IN GASOLINE Mr. Greenbaum. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. To you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Chafee and other members of the committee, I am pleased to have the opportunity to be here. I have to say, sitting here and listening to your opening statements, I felt for a moment that I was back at the first meeting of the Blue Ribbon Panel because some of the same issues and questions were placed on the table, as you might guess. We made an effort to try to bring a group of people together to try to look at this issue, look at the facts of this issue, and hopefully I can share with you some of that in my testimony and then answer questions as we go through the session this morning. In the wake of the detection of MTBE in drinking water supplies, as Senator Boxer said, in both Maine and California and elsewhere, Administrator Browner convened the Blue Ribbon Panel to investigate the facts of the situation and to recommend actions to achieve both clean air and clean water. The Panel consisted of experts on air, water, and public health, as well as representatives of the oil, ethanol, and MTBE industries, and the environmental community. We began our work in January of this year and we conducted an in-depth investigation of the air quality, water quality, fuel supply, and price issues surrounding the use of oxygenates in gasoline. We held six meetings in 6 months, including field meetings in New England and California. We heard from experts, we reviewed dozens of both existing and new studies of oxygenates in gasoline. Based on that review the Panel found, first, that RFG has provided substantial reductions in the emissions of a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles, in most cases resulting in emission reductions that exceed those required by law. Second, we found that there have been growing detections of MTBE in drinking water across the country, with between 5 percent and 10 percent of drinking water supplies in RFG areas showing detectable amounts of MTBE. There have not, at the same time, been increases in detections of the other portions of gasoline which behave fundamentally differently than MTBE in groundwater. The great majority of the MTBE detections have been below levels of public health concern, as you yourself said in your opening comments, Mr. Chairman. With approximately 1 percent rising to levels above 20 parts per billion, and some instances, such as Santa Monica--although rare--of levels of 100 parts per billion and higher. Detections at these lower levels, however, have raised consumer taste and odor concerns, and they have caused water suppliers to stop using some water supplies and to incur the costs of treatment and remediation. The third thing we found is that the major source of this contamination appears to be releases from underground gasoline storage systems. These systems have been upgraded in the past decade, and that has likely resulted in reduced risk of leaks. However, approximately 20 percent of the storage tanks have not yet been upgraded. As well, there continue to be reports of releases from some upgraded systems due to inadequate design, installation, maintenance, and operation. In addition, under the law under which USEPA regulates these tanks, they do not currently have the authority to regulate many fuel storage systems beyond those we see in gasoline stations. Based on these facts, the Panel evaluated a range of alternatives for addressing the problems, and we recommended that EPA work with you in Congress and the States to implement a four-part integrated--and that's an important term here-- integrated package of reforms to ensure that water supplies are better protected, while the substantial reductions in air pollution that have resulted from RFG are maintained. Specifically, the Panel recommended, No. 1, a comprehensive set of improvements to the Nation's water protection programs, including over 20 specific actions to enhance underground storage tanks, safe drinking water, and private well protection programs. The Panel considered these necessary to prevent future water contamination, but not sufficient in and of themselves to ensure that the problem will be solved. We recommended further that we agreed broadly that the use of MTBE should be reduced substantially, with some members supporting its complete phase-out, and that Congress should act to provide clear Federal and State authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of MTBE and other gasoline additives that might threaten drinking water supplies. Third, recognizing that MTBE was a very important part of the Nation's fuel supply, we recommended that Congress act to remove the current Clean Air Act requirement that 2 percent of RFG by weight consist of oxygen, to ensure that adequate fuel supplies can be blended in a cost-effective and timely manner, while reducing the use of MTBE. And fourth, we recommended that EPA seek mechanisms to ensure that there is no loss of the current air quality benefits as the use of MTBE declines. Now, although the Panel agreed broadly in its recommendations, two members--while agreeing with most recommendations--did have concerns over specific provisions, and I feel it my duty as Chairman to share those with you here. The MTBE industry representative on the Panel felt that the water protection reforms that we proposed were sufficient to protect water supplies, and was concerned that the Panel had not adequately considered the air quality benefits of oxygenates. The ethanol industry representative was concerned that the Panel's recommendation to lift the oxygen requirement did not adequately reflect the benefits of using oxygenates. Copies of their statements are attached to the executive summary and in the final report. In sum, the Panel found that we have a successful, cleaner- burning gasoline program in place, but we need to take action to ensure that the detections of MTBE in drinking water that we have seen, and which fortunately in the great majority of cases have not yet been a public health concern, do not continue to grow. We have provided to the committee the executive summary, as well as the full report of the Panel, as now available on the World Wide Web, and I thank you for this opportunity to testify. I would be glad to answer any questions. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Greenbaum. We will have rounds of questions. You know, all of this started, I guess, when Senators Dole and Daschle, in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, put the requirement in for oxygenates. I think that's getting down to the core of the problem. That's Dole and Daschle from the beautiful corn States of Kansas and South Dakota. What did the Panel find in relation to the air benefits from MTBE? I think this is getting down to the crux of the problem, because it's my understanding that your Panel called for the repeal of the Federal oxygen content mandate. When you talk about the phase-down in the use of MTBE, it was dependent upon the repeal of the Federal mandate, is that correct? Could you elaborate on that? Mr. Greenbaum. Yes, I will. First of all, we on the Panel understood that the RFG program as enacted into law, including the oxygen mandate, has been a tremendous air quality success. And as a result, it has been one that has greatly aided a number of people in their air pollution exposure across the country. The benefits of the oxygenates themselves, both MTBE and ethanol, in that have been substantial in getting that program up and running. I think it is fair to say that at the time, there were no other proposals on the table that would provide fuels as clean that could provide similar air quality benefits. What has occurred, and what the Panel saw, was that today the refining industry has emerged with fuel formulations that would contain no oxygenate at all, and that would meet or exceed the current performance of RFG. I don't think that was in place, necessarily, in 1990; I think that that's something that we've seen emerge, and I think in the end it was a challenge for the Panel. We didn't totally agree on the air quality benefits of MTBE specifically, in part because although they have played a role, it seems clear that there are other formulations of fuel that are available that could provide the same benefits as the ones with MTBE. We did feel, particularly in the area of air toxics reductions, that MTBE and the oxygenate presence--both MTBE and ethanol--had contributed in some way to that, but the Panel recommended that if you remove the oxygen mandate and reduce the amount of MTBE, and at the same time made sure that the air quality requirements stayed strong, that you could see the fuel supply provide fuel that was cost-effective and provide the same air quality benefits, but without the problems with high levels of MTBE. That was a long answer, Senator, I'm sorry. Senator Inhofe. No, it's a good answer. I just want to be sure that we're all clear, that if the MTBE is phased out, did the Panel have any recommendation to replace that? Or was it for a replacement of the 2 percent oxygenate mandate? In other words, did they have the idea of phasing this out and then replacing it with something else, or phasing it out and also phasing out the 2 percent mandate? Mr. Greenbaum. First of all, to clarify, the Panel as a whole called for phasing down the use of MTBE, not phasing it out, although there were members who thought we should phase it out, but that was not the majority opinion of the Panel. In other words, reduce its use substantially; that's what we called for. We did not pick one alternative that was ``the best'' alternative. We felt that that would depend on a complex mixture of decisions, including decisions at each refinery, decisions about the availability of fuel blending stocks, and decisions about what else within the gasoline already that neither the Panel, we thought, or the Federal Government should necessarily dictate. We thought that one of the alternatives that would come in to meet this would be increased use of ethanol. We thought another one would be increased use of components of existing gasoline, particularly alkylates, which are in gasoline currently and would have to be increased in production. And the Panel did not rule out the possibility of continued lower-level use of MTBE, in part because we saw in areas of the country where it had been used at lower levels, we did not see the same level of contamination. In order to provide the flexibility necessary for that range of alternatives to be chosen in a cost-effective fashion by the refining industry to meet the air quality needs, we felt it was essential that the 2 percent mandate be lifted that in some parts of the country it might still be 2 percent or even more, where ethanol was available, and could even grow in its use; in other parts of the country, other parts of crude oil would be used. In some components of it, smaller levels of MTBE might continue to be used. Senator Inhofe. Did your Panel look into the idea that if you are replacing MTBE, you could be replacing it with something that is as toxic or more toxic than MTBE is--benzene? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, we were concerned with that, and called for immediate review of the health effects of all of the alternatives that might mean an increase in supply, including ethanol, including alkylates, and including aromatics like benzene, which might increase in supply. First of all, we felt that benzene is already capped in its use in reformulated gasoline; and that second, if at the same time you were tightening the air quality requirements to ensure that we kept the same level of good performance that we've had from existing RFG, that that would in itself keep the lid on some of the levels of more toxic components of gasoline that might increase, like benzene. Senator Inhofe. Yes. Senator Chafee. Senator Chafee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let's see if I understand what you're recommending. As I understand it, you are recommending that we give up the 2 percent oxygen by weight, is that correct? Mr. Greenbaum. That's right. Senator Chafee. And leave it up to each State as to how they want to handle this situation, whether they want to have some kind of an oxygen requirement, is that correct? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, we actually called for each State's and EPA's authority to be clarified as to how they could regulate additives to gasoline that might cause a threat to groundwater. And in essence that might mean that a State could continue to require oxygen, per se, but more importantly the question was, did they want to regulate the use of additives that might affect groundwater, which was really the crux of our concern. Senator Chafee. Now, it seems to me that an important part of all this is that we ought to get on with this upgrading of the tanks, the underground storage tanks, and the surface tanks, too. But then you mentioned somewhere in your testimony that older outboards on recreational boats are contributing to this, likewise. Mr. Greenbaum. Yes. I actually have that in my formal testimony; to keep within the 5 minutes, I didn't comment on that. There's no question that the tank systems--we have to complete the upgrade that we already started back in 1988, but really have to go much further than that with the tank system than we have. First of all, to complete it, but second, for the tanks, the standards for those tanks were put in place in 1988, prior to any knowledge that there would be high levels of use of MTBE in the fuel. The oxygen requirement didn't pass until 1990. MTBE, as we have heard and as our Panel heard in detail from hydrogeologists, behaves substantially differently in groundwater than the other components of gasoline. Therefore, the consequences of a leak from an underground tank are greater, and the standards almost certainly would have been looked at more tightly in 1988 if we knew MTBE was in place, and probably need to be revisited. So even within the tank program, there are things that need to be done to really tighten those standards, which cannot be done overnight. They need to be done. Second, there are tanks that have been upgraded that are leaking. That's not because they weren't properly designed, necessarily, although in some cases they weren't well designed; they may have been misinstalled, they may have been improperly used. But we have had evidence of cases of that in Maine, Delaware, and California already. Not every tank, but some of the tanks will continue to leak. Third, and I think this gets more focused to the point of your question, Senator Chafee, once you put this material in gasoline, there are a number of ways it can get into the groundwater and into the surface water. It can happen if leaks occur, if a tanker truck turns over, which does happen on highways; I saw that when I was Commissioner in Massachusetts. If a car accident occurs or a truck accident occurs, it can happen in a number of situations. It also comes out of motorboats, and we saw evidence in a number of surface waters of seasonal peaks in MTBE levels in waters because of older boat engines. So it gets into the water in a number of ways. The single largest source of that has been underground tanks, but we shouldn't neglect the fact that there are other possible ways. Senator Chafee. What is your answer to this statement? I have a memo here, and it says as follows: ``The oxygen requirement is a redundant mandate that costs consumers over $1 billion a year.'' Mr. Greenbaum. Well, I'm not sure of the source of that. I can't go back to a specific economic analysis that would tell me that. I think, as I said earlier, it is not clear to me, looking backwards with 20-20 hindsight, that in 1990 there was another way to get to the kind of clean fuel we have, other than by the way that law was put in place. I think where we are today, technology has changed and the options have changed, and there are more options available to us for producing very clean gasoline than were available then. Whether there is an extra cost that consumers have incurred over time or not, I can't guarantee. I do know that most of the estimates of the increased cost of RFG, which were not just because of the oxygenates, ended up being in the $0.01 to $0.02 per gallon range, once that was actually implemented. So I don't think we were talking about large increases in cost. Senator Chafee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Let me ask about the leakage in these newly-installed underground tanks, like what percentage of them do have leaks, and what could be done to stop these leaks. Was it from installation? Was any kind of a study done? Because if it gets down to a point where we're going to have to be looking at regulation for the installation of these tanks, it will be important to know that. Mr. Greenbaum. There were only the beginnings of such studies, since many of the tanks didn't get upgraded until the latter part of the last decade, with a deadline of 1998. We did have one review done by the California Water Resources Board of a series of tanks in trying to identify what percentage were leaking and what the nature of the problems was, and they had the same interest, to try to understand whether they could tighten the rules, whether they could make it better. And we can certainly refer you to that. There was also this survey by the Santa Clara Water District that Senator boxer mentioned. Because we've only had 3 to 5 years, really, of experience with most of these tanks being upgraded, we probably don't have the full range of experience necessary. One of the things the Panel called for was an immediate look to try to build that data base. Senator Inhofe. Would you submit that for the record, the reports of the analysis in California? Mr. Greenbaum. We certainly will do that. Senator Inhofe. Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for pressing the issue of the tanks, because it is really stunning to realize that in Santa Clara they put in all these new tanks, and they still have the leakage. It's very troubling. I want to thank you very much for all the work you did and the committee did, the Blue Ribbon Panel. I think the fact that you had a member from the MTBE industry on there and a member from the ethanol industry on there says that there was quite a tug of war going on, and I know that makes it very, very difficult to come to some firm conclusion. Again, I want to read the conclusion that you came to, because I think it is very clear: The Panel agreed broadly that in order to minimize current and future threats to drinking water, the use of MTBE should be reduced substantially. Several members believed that the use of MTBE should be phased out completely. That's pretty clear guidance for this committee, I hope. I wanted to probe a little bit about this recommendation. Without identifying who, because that's not important, approximately how many felt it ought to be phased out? And I'm not counting the two--I don't think it's fair to count the two who had a special economic interest, because obviously the ethanol person would say, ``phase it out,'' and the MTBE person would say, ``don't.'' So without that, how many of that 11 left would you say said, ``phase it out''? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, first of all, I think it's fine not to count those two. Actually, as I said in my comments, the representative of the MTBE industry did not think that we needed to go to the next stage of reductions, that the upgrading of the tanks and the other recommendations were sufficient. To my recollection, there were four or five members, all from California--no, not all from California, four or five members of the Panel who felt they were most comfortable with a phase-out. The remainder of the Panel felt that a substantial reduction was adequate. Senator Boxer. OK. Mr. Greenbaum. But the whole panel could not agree on-- Senator Boxer. I understand. But I think that's important, Mr. Chairman, to recognize that, if you take away the ethanol and the MTBE people, because frankly, I think they have a particular view on the point. I think that's pretty interesting, because that is a large number who would say, ``phase it out.'' Now, out of those who said there ought to be a substantial reduction, what is a ``substantial'' reduction? What does that mean? Does that mean reduce the amount by 25 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent? What does that mean? It's kind of a fuzzy word. Mr. Greenbaum. Well, we actually did--in our recommendations we did not set a specific number because we felt, I think, more broadly that the setting of specific numbers in this process has been part of the problem rather than part of the solution. But we did give an example of such a substantial reduction, which would be moving back to the historical levels in which MTBE was used as a lead and other additive replacement prior to the introduction of RFG. It was used in those situations, on average across the whole fuel supply, at about 2 percent of the fuel supply, although in some cases it was higher and in some cases it wasn't used at all. But on average-- Senator Boxer. So the average was about 2 percent. And what is it now? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, in the RFG areas it is required to be 11 percent--I'm speaking, by the way, by volume here, 2 percent by volume versus 11 percent by volume. Senator Boxer. OK. Well, that's very important guidance, Mr. Chairman. That is a substantial reduction. Mr. Greenbaum. That would be a substantial reduction. We were not prepared, because of the nature of the issue in different parts of the country, to say that that's what should be happening in every single location, but it was one example that we could give. Senator Boxer. OK. Now, here's a point I want to get at. If you eliminate the 2 percent requirement for oxygenates, but you don't ban MTBE, what assurance is there that MTBE won't be used? Because I gave you the example of San Francisco, which was completely shocking to people, where we did not need, because we were meeting the clean air requirement, to have MTBE. The oil companies, after learning that Gray Davis wanted to phase this out and the legislature wanted to phase it out and all the rest, decided it was the cheapest way to expand their gasoline supplies. It was stunning to people that they did that. So my question is, if you don't ban MTBE but you list the oxygenate requirement, there's no guarantee that this substantial reduction is going to take place, wouldn't you agree, given the facts of what happened in San Francisco? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, I don't want to suggest that I know all the details of the situation in San Francisco, although I will say that the Panel happened to be having its meeting in California on the day that two things occurred simultaneously, No. 1, that Governor Davis made his announcement, and No. 2, that there was a major fire, the second in a short period of time, in one of the refineries in California. While I would agree that it was unusual that the use of MTBE went up within 2 months of Governor Davis calling for its reduction, I would also suggest, based on what we as the Panel understood, that the situation in California was unique in the sense that the supply of gasoline from crude oil was substantially reduced because of the incidents in these two refineries. Having said that, I think the general evidence that the Panel saw and the analyses that the Department of Energy has done, which are in the record and are summarized in our final report and can be provided, suggested that if you solely removed the mandate, that economic forces probably would reduce the amount of MTBE but continue to use it at fairly high levels, because it is a relatively cost-effective blending component for gasoline, very high octane and very clean. The factor that the Panel knew would be a factor in industry decisionmaking, but which we couldn't quantify, is the growing concerns that a variety of people in industry have raised about the future liability for cleanup costs for industry of using MTBE, and that in and of itself is often a driver to get industry to reduce its use. And I think some companies are already trying to figure out, without the 2 percent mandate, how to reduce the use. Having said that, the Panel did not feel that just lifting the mandate was sufficient, and that's why we called for Congress to clarify both Federal and State authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of MTBE and similar additives. In other words, we were not calling for a ban, but we were calling for clarity on what the authority would be to ensure that you could get a reduction over time if the market didn't provide that. Senator Boxer. I appreciate that. Two more quick questions---- Senator Inhofe. I'm really sorry, I'm going to have to cut you off because you've gone over---- Senator Boxer. Other people went over. You went over it, and so did Senator Chafee. Senator Inhofe. No, I'm really trying to be fair with everyone. Senator Boxer. Well, then, can I ask this when you finish everybody else? I have two more questions. Senator Inhofe. How about 1 more minute, all right? Senator Boxer. Fair enough. Here's the point. You're right about litigation. In Santa Monica--and this goes to the point raised by my good friend and colleague, Senator Bennett--in Santa Monica, they shut down 71 percent of the water supply. Do you know where they're getting the water from to serve your family or friends? From the Colorado River. Now, we are already over our allocation. This is a real serious problem for us. That is not a solution. And by the way, they are in litigation, trying to get the oil companies to pay for this importation of water. We all love local government here. I served in local government. This is putting the burden on them for some mistake we made here. So the bottom line is, the cost of this cleanup is enormous and it leads to litigation, and therefore we should ban MTBE. And the last question I have deals with the fact that this--I think it's good to focus on the leaking tanks; the chairman is right on that point. However, that's not the only way this stuff gets in the water. We already talked about the use of MTBE and the boats and it goes in the lakes. When we transfer the fuel at transfer stations, it leaks. There was a car accident in Maine that contaminated 24 wells. So it isn't just a matter of the underground tanks. We have other ways for MTBE to get in, is that correct, into the water supply? Mr. Greenbaum. I think I said that in response to Senator Chafee's question. There clearly are other ways. Our best estimate was that the great majority of the problems have been tanks, but that there are a number of other ways in which it can get in, the major ones being spills, accidents, and boats. Senator Boxer. All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Thank you. Before going to Senator Bennett, did you have an opening statement to make, Senator Voinovich? OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE V. VOINOVICH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Senator Voinovich. I will just submit it for the record. Senator Inhofe. All right. [The prepared statement of Senator Voinovich follows:] Statement of Hon. George V. Voinovich, U.S. Senator from the State of Ohio Mr. Chairman, I am pleased you are conducting this hearing on the EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel findings on the use of oxygenates in gasoline. Throughout my 33 years of public service, I have been committed to preserving our environment and the health and well-being of our citizens. While in the Ohio House of Representatives, I was responsible for creating the Environment and Natural Resources Committee and was honored to serve as vice chair of that committee. I am proud that the State of Ohio realized significant improvements in air quality in recent years. When I first entered office as Governor in 1991, most of Ohio's urban areas were not attaining the 1-hour ozone standard. By the time I left office in 1998, all cities had attained the standards, except one. However, earlier this year EPA proposed a rule to revoke the 1-hour standard for the last nonattainment area. Overall, the ozone level in Ohio has gone down by 25 percent. In many urban areas, it has gone down by more than 50 percent in the past 20 years. My point is that Ohio is doing its part to provide cleaner air and a healthier environment for its citizens. For instance, Ohio's public utilities spent $3.7 billion on air pollution controls through 1995, more than the combined expenditures of all the Northeast states. As I said, all of our urban areas but one have met the one-hour ozone standard. And one of the things we did in Ohio to achieve this was to implement an emission testing program. This was not an easy task and I took a lot of heat for it. As a matter of fact, I had to veto a bill passed by the state legislature which would have removed the E- Check program because it was so unpopular and the legislature did not want to take the heat for it. But my Administration thought this program would best help us attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Ohio could have chosen to opt into the reformulated gasoline program as one option to reach the NAAQS standards, but we were not mandated to use it. However, other areas of the country are required to participate in the reformulated gasoline program to help them comply with air standards. I think most state and local governments are willing to take the necessary steps to make the air we breathe cleaner. However, we need to make sure that the right hand knows what the left hand is doing. We want to make sure that as we are trying to reduce pollution in one source, such as air, we aren't affecting other sources, such as drinking or ground water. We need to make sure there is proper analysis and sound science behind the decisions we make whether they are regulatory standards or legislative requirements. Quite frankly, I am concerned we are here today. I am concerned that in 1990 Congress acted to put the 2 percent mandate in the reformulated gasoline program without showing the necessary scientific reason for doing so. I am concerned that there was no analysis of the costs, benefits or risks behind this provision before it was enacted into law. However, I am not convinced that EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel provides us with the adequate cost, benefit or risk analysis behind their recommendations either. We need to know more information before we start off on a new course of action. And we need to know whether the same money should be spent in this area or on other priority environmental problems. I'm not here to say whether these recommendations are wrong or right, but that we need more information to determine whether this is the right path to follow. I think that something should be done. However, I propose that states should have the flexibility to determine how to handle this problem in their own states. Today we have an example of where a mandate was made without adequately studying the potential risks that it could impose or the science behind it. However, before we jump forward with extensive suggestions on how to fix the problem, there needs to be careful analysis of the costs, benefits and risks that would be incurred by these proposals. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to today's testimony. Senator Inhofe. Senator Bennett. Senator Bennett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Greenbaum, I come to your final statement. You say, ``In sum, the Panel found that we have a successful, cleaner- burning gasoline program in place, but need to take action to ensure that the detections of MTBE in drinking water that we have seen, and which fortunately in the great majority of cases have not been a public health concern, do not continue to grow.'' Let's parse that statement. Let's go through that sentence very carefully, because that is your summary of everything else you say. We must ``take action'' that ``the detections of MTBE in drinking water that we have seen . . . do not continue to grow.'' I assume from that you're saying that MTBE, however noxious it may be, is not toxic? Is that a correct statement? If not, correct me. But that's what I read into what you're saying: this is unpleasant; it can cause people to not want to drink the water; it can cause great difficulty, but it's not killing anybody--at least, not yet. Mr. Greenbaum. The ``not yet'' is important, I think. Senator Bennett. OK. Mr. Greenbaum. I think that at the levels at which it has been seen in most water supplies, everyone would agree that it is not toxic. My institution, the Health Effects Institute, actually conducted a comprehensive review of the science of MTBE, asked for by the White House and Centers for Disease Control in 1996, and I think it is fair to say that while there are questions about the toxicity of MTBE, it does not rise to the same level of toxicity as things like benzene, which are already in gasoline. Having said that, there are levels at which everybody would agree it would not be safe. The levels that were reached in Santa Monica were 600 parts per billion. The levels at one set of private wells in Delaware were several hundred parts per million. So we have seen only the tip of the iceberg in terms of health or toxicity effect concerns. That's fortunate, and that's good. I think the Panel felt that we could not be assured that we wouldn't see continuing problems with that, and growth of that number of wells, and that's why we felt that we needed to take action now. Senator Bennett. You do not call for a ban. You call for a reduction, which would further support the notion that only in high concentrations is it toxic, and that a certain level is tolerable. Am I correctly summarizing your science here? Mr. Greenbaum. I think that's correct. The health basis for banning a chemical normally requires considerably more clear- cut evidence of the health concerns relating to that chemical than we have for MTBE. And that was a conscious discussion of the Panel. Just to give you one example of that, benzene, which is in gasoline, is identified by both national and international cancer agencies as a known human carcinogen. MTBE is neither a known human carcinogen, or even a probable human carcinogen. At this stage it is in the ``possible'' category. In other words, there are some animal tests that show that it causes cancer, but there are questions about those tests. Senator Bennett. OK. So I am interested that you did not call for a total ban on these reasons. Now, let's go to the other side of your examination. You found that we do have cleaner air because of MTBE, and I would ask, if MTBE were banned, what alternatives would you recommend in order to achieve the level of clean air? Are we talking about more ethanol, so that the corn farmers can rejoice? Or do we have something else that we can turn to? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, we actually found that clearly, RFG as a whole has had substantial air quality benefits. MTBE has been one of the components of that, but on the Panel we could not ascribe with agreement any particular amount of benefit to MTBE providing that benefit versus ethanol providing that benefit, and that's based on the availability of data. The data is not clear enough and clean enough to be able to do that. But there's no question that the fuel that has been out there with the oxygen has provided substantial air quality benefits. The challenge for the Panel was to try to answer your question: so if we take this stuff out, what's going to happen? We felt there were several scenarios that could occur. One of them would be increased use of ethanol. One of them would be increased use of the alkylate component refined from crude oil, which has very high octane and is generally clean. One of the scenarios could be increased use of aromatics, like benzene, which are things that we have been trying to reduce the use of in gasoline. The Panel did not feel that it could choose the best of those alternatives, because each has strengths and weaknesses, but rather felt that what we needed to do was make sure that the requirements for RFG are stringent enough that we are assured that as the fuel goes forward, no matter what a refiner decides to do--whether they decide to use ethanol, whether they decide to use alkylates, or whether they decide to continue to use lower amounts of MTBE plus some of these other things--that you continue to have the air quality benefits. And the Panel felt that that was possible, given what we had seen in evidence before us. Senator Bennett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Senator Bennett. Senator Voinovich. Senator Voinovich. Following up on Senator Bennett's line of questioning, if you eliminated the 2 percent requirement and banned MTBE, and you have reformulated gasoline, is there any guarantee that in order to achieve the same benefits to the air, that you wouldn't substitute something else that would be just as harmful? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, I think that's a very key question, Senator, and I think--because one of the possibilities would be that you would see some degree of increase from refiners in some of the refineries of the use of aromatics in the fuel, particularly things like benzene, which is very high octane. That's the kind of thing we've been trying to reduce; in fact, the refiners have reduced benzene below those required by the Clean Air Act and by EPA regulations. And I think that goes to the fourth key recommendation which the Panel made, which was that you could only do these things if you, at the same time, ensured that the air quality requirements that were originally put out in the act were tightened sufficiently to require continued benefits equal to those we've actually had in the fuel, and that's what our fourth recommendation was. If you don't do that, then the concern that you raised is very real. I think there is a chance that you wouldn't see a return to pre-RFG days because there is a limit on how much benzene can be in the fuel, but you would see an increase in some of the components that contribute to air toxics and other emissions. Senator Voinovich. So the fact is, to maintain the same improvement in the air quality that you're getting from MTBE, you are really not sure if you eliminated it what else you would have to do, and you're not sure whether that might have more harmful impact on the water than MTBE? Mr. Greenbaum. Well, the issue of water--actually, we did look at the alternatives and we looked at the question of what those alternatives might have, not only for air quality impacts, but also water impacts. It would have been crazy for us not to look at it, given the experience we have had with MTBE. I think there are two things there. First, most of the other components of gasoline, including the aromatics and the alkylates, actually, when they get into groundwater, they are not as soluble in groundwater as either MTBE or ethanol, and biodegrade more readily than MTBE. So our impression was that you would not be worsening the situation if you used more of crude oil components for the gasoline as a replacement for MTBE. The water situation would not be any worse than it has been historically, with leaks of gasoline. With ethanol, ethanol is highly soluble in water, more so than any of the other compounds we considered, but it is also highly biodegradable, meaning that the bacteria in soil prefer to drink ethanol than drink benzene; I guess that's probably one way of putting it. [Laughter.] Mr. Greenbaum. There are laboratory studies that confirm that. There are no field studies that say, ``Well, what does that mean when you get out in the field?'' We saw estimates, projections that were made, that suggested that what would happen with large volumes of ethanol in the fuel, is that you would see very rapid biodegradation of the ethanol. The ethanol would never move very far away from wherever the spill or the leak was. But you might see other components of the gasoline, like benzene, move further than they would otherwise move, because they wouldn't be biodegraded right away, and they might go as far as 30 percent further, but that is not tested in the field at this stage. That was something that we put in our report, and we called for an immediate look at that question before you went to a very broad use of ethanol. Now, to be clear, ethanol can grow in its use, but it would also need infrastructure investment. The ethanol industry appeared before us and it was clear that they were prepared to make that, but overnight you would not see more ethanol--you know, dramatic increases in ethanol. You would see some increases. Senator Voinovich. OK. The last question I have is this. I read your summary, and it looks like you are making all kinds of recommendations to the Federal level or the State level. It sounds to me like there was no mention in it about the cost to do everything that was recommended. The dissenting opinion at the end said that if this happened and they eliminated it, that it would increase the cost of gasoline by $1 billion to $3 billion. The money side of this wasn't involved. Wouldn't the best solution be to give EPA the flexibility to work with State people where they did have a problem to try to come up with something that would best respond to the needs of the particular community, rather than having some new Federal administration getting into all of this, and so on? In other words, in your report you also say that if we did a better job, for example, dealing with storage tanks, that the primary source of this is leaking storage tanks. Now, in my State we have a very aggressive program that we started to get these out of the ground and replace them with things that are getting the job done. The point is that this problem is localized, isn't it, in certain places in the country? And rather than come up with some gigantic new program, why don't we give the EPA flexibility to deal with the problem in the areas that have problems, and let them look at the alternatives, let the States come back with recommendations, and let them approve it or disapprove it, having to weigh the issue of clean air versus the issue of water? And leave it at that. Mr. Greenbaum. Well, there are a number of ways that one can address the sets of issues that we recommended. I think that embodied at the core of our recommendations was the recommendation that Congress act to clarify the authority of both EPA and the States to deal with these problems, because we do think there are going to be needs for some State flexibility and some ability to address this on a localized basis, in some cases going further than in others. And if anything, the Panel was suggesting moving away from a broad-based Federal requirement, the 2 percent requirement, because it--in and of itself--is an imposition in some ways on the entire system. But having said that, I think the biggest concern counter to that that requires some careful interaction and thinking between the Federal Government and the States is the issue of not fractionating our fuel supply in so many different pieces that we end up with what some have called ``boutique fuels'' in different States and in different situations, where you would have--as you would know, Senator, if your constituents in Ohio have to pay one thing for fuel because you have one type of fuel, and they went across the border into another State and got much cheaper fuel, it would get very complicated very fast. And one of our strengths is having a national fuel supply. So when we go to dealing with this, we have to be thinking about how we maintain that consistency while still giving States the authority and the flexibility to deal with their localized problems, and also while ensuring that the States have taken the actions to clean up their tanks as they should. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Greenbaum. We appreciate your being here and what you have contributed. Senator Inhofe. We will now ask panel No. 2 to come forward. It will be the Honorable Jake Garn, our former colleague, who is vice chairman of Huntsman Corporation; Mr. Michael Kenny, executive officer, California Air Resources Board; and Mr. Bob Campbell, CEO of Sunoco, Inc. Again, we will ask you to try to confine your opening remarks to 5 minutes, and then we will try to exercise the same discipline from this end of the table. Senator Garn. STATEMENT OF HON. JAKE GARN, VICE CHAIRMAN, HUNTSMAN CORPORATION, SALT LAKE CITY, UT Mr. Garn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased that you have called these hearings and are willing to expand from the BRP and take additional testimony. I am vice chairman of the Huntsman Corporation, which is the largest privately-owned chemical company in the United States, and we are a major producer of MTBE and a member of the Oxygenated Fuels Association. Huntsman's decision to get into the MTBE business was on the basis of clean air. Huntsman is a unique company. One of the reasons we can do the things we do is because we are privately-held. John Huntsman has given $150 million in cash to the University of Utah to create the Huntsman Cancer Institute. He is committed to solving the problem of cancer, and knowing John, I have no doubts he will probably over a number of years be able to accomplish that. I bring that out because in all of our plants in the United States and around the world, I don't think you would find a company that is more socially responsible, has put their money where their mouth is in health and safety of their employees, the surrounding communities, and so on, and it really is a remarkable record. So I wanted you to understand the context in which I am speaking today. We agree with much of what the Panel has found. For example, we agree that more research and monitoring is necessary concerning the health effects of not only MTBE, but also other constituents of gasoline. We agree that timely actions need to be taken to significantly enhance Federal and State gasoline storage programs. We also support the BRP finding that Congress must act to expand resources available to ensure safe drinking water supplies. However, we have strong concerns about several of the BRP's conclusions. Most importantly, we disagree strongly that there is sufficient justification to recommend a substantial reduction in the use of MTBE. As described in greater detail in our written submission, we believe the BRP left many important questions unanswered. Unfortunately, the BRP is gone, and the responsibility to answer these questions falls to Congress, and to this subcommittee in particular. Until those questions are answered, we believe it is inappropriate to move forward with any effort to amend the Clean Air Act to reconfigure the reformulated gasoline program. We appreciate this opportunity to contribute our thoughts on how Congress should endeavor to answer these remaining important questions. Today I want to focus on a few of the many issues raised by the BRP in some greater detail. We believe that the BRP's conclusion to phase down the use of MTBE is not supported by their own deliberative process. For example, the BRP made no finding with respect to the health effects due to MTBE exposure, and this result is not surprising, given that extensive research conducted over a number of years has indicated that MTBE exposure levels necessary to cause injury in animals are thousands and thousands of times greater than those humans could conceivably be exposed to. Therefore, an array of organizations has concluded that MTBE is not a human carcinogen. These include the Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer, the National Academy of Sciences, and California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. Consistent with our own beliefs about cancer research, Huntsman supports the notion that much more research should be done, just as BRP recommended. However, with a clear consensus to date regarding the lack of adverse health consequences of MTBE exposure, and with substantial health benefits relating to clean air hanging in the balance, we cannot support BRP's conclusion regarding phase-down of the additive. While we are on the subject of health benefits, Huntsman also believes that the BRP underestimated the air quality improvements attributable to the use of oxygenates like MTBE. EPA has written that oxygenates substantially reduce toxics and dilute or displace other fuel components, like sulfur, which in turn reduce emissions of the smog precursors. EPA has found that oxygenates like MTBE improve the performance of on-board automobile air pollution control devices. In short, the real world benefits of MTBE usage have exceeded even the most optimistic predicted results. By failing to give credit where credit is due for real world performance, BRP underestimated the environmental benefits of MTBE. We also believe that BRP may have underestimated the effectiveness of enhanced underground storage protection as an appropriate response. Even Senator Feinstein observed during Floor consideration of an appropriations matter some 2 weeks ago, ``The major way MTBE gets into groundwater is from defective underground tanks storing petroleum products.'' She has offered fixes to the UST program as a way to stop the contamination of drinking water by the gasoline additive MTBE. Lastly, we are concerned that BRP simply paid too little attention to the potential consequences of shifting to alternative fuel additives to MTBE. As we all know, the primary alternative to MTBE is ethanol. We have several concerns about the viability of ethanol production constraints, and trouble with pipeline deliveries make ethanol a logical and logistical nightmare to use as a basis for the fuel supply of the United States. Mr. Chairman, I notice the red light has come on, and I would simply refer to my detailed statement which you have already offered to put in the record. When I was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee I was very strict about time, and so I will be happy to respond to questions after the other witnesses, but when that red light comes on, I stop. Senator Inhofe. Good for you, Senator. [Laughter.] Senator Inhofe. Thank you. Mr. Kenny. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL KENNY, EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD, SACRAMENTO, CA Mr. Kenny. Thank you, Chairman Inhofe and members of the subcommittee. I am happy to be here today to present the California perspective on behalf of Governor Gray Davis, the California Environmental Protection Agency, and the California Air Resources Board. As the Blue Ribbon Panel report noted, California has its own reformulated gasoline program, which was established to deal with California's unique air quality problems. California's RFG program differs from the Federal program in a number of ways, and I think it's important to look at those. The California program limits the sulfur and aromatic content of gasoline, while the Federal program does not. California's program also utilizes a predictive model that enables refiners to market innovative fuel formulations that vary from California's gasoline specifications, as long as refiners can demonstrate through the model that the formulations provide the required air quality benefits. So far, the California RFG program has been immensely successful. Peak ozone levels in the State of California have been reduced by about 10 percent, and airborne benzene, a highly potent toxic, has been reduced by about 50 percent. Unfortunately, the continuing controversy over MTBE has overshadowed the success of this program. Two California cities, Santa Monica and South Lake Tahoe, have seen their domestic water supplies decimated by MTBE contamination, and MTBE has been found in groundwater at several thousand leaking underground tank sites in California. The Blue Ribbon Panel report documents that MTBE contamination is truly a national problem. California took its own proactive steps last March. Governor Gray Davis declared that MTBE is an environmental risk, and he ordered it to be eliminated from California gasoline by the end of 2002. Perhaps the single most crucial factor affecting California's ability to eliminate MTBE use is the Federal 2 percent oxygenate requirement. The Blue Ribbon Panel recommendation on this was to eliminate that requirement. It is absolutely critical for California that that 2 percent requirement be eliminated. California does not believe there is a technical or scientific basis for requiring the addition of oxygen to gasoline. It is possible to make California RFG without oxygen, and it is much more cost- effective to let each refiner decide for itself whether to use those oxygenates. About 70 percent of the California gasoline market is subject to the Federal 2 percent oxygen rule, and in the other 30 percent of the market, three refiners have produced and sold non-oxygenated gasolines that provide all of the air quality benefits required by California reformulated gasoline. California has shown that it can deliver the full benefits of its world-leading RFG program without an oxygen requirement. Once MTBE is eliminated in California, the only feasible oxygenate will be ethanol. If the 2 percent oxygen rule remains in effect, ethanol will be effectively mandated for 70 percent of California gasoline. California, in just 3 years, would need about half the amount of ethanol that is currently produced in the midwestern States. The Blue Ribbon Panel report acknowledges the large investment in infrastructure that would be needed to meet this large demand. The California Energy Commission estimated that the elimination of MTBE could add as much as $0.06 to $0.07 per gallon to gasoline costs if the oxygen requirement remains in effect. This would cost California motorists about $840 million a year, without producing any additional air quality benefit. In contrast, elimination of the 2 percent requirement would allow gasoline costs to remain stable, and possibly decline. Some have portrayed this as opposition to the use of ethanol. It's not. Even if the Federal oxygenate requirement is eliminated, we know that ethanol usage in California will increase exponentially; however, California should not trade its dependence on MTBE for a similar dependence on ethanol. Instead, we should strive for a diverse and stable RFG marketplace featuring a range of ethanol-based and nonoxygenated formulations. Such fuels will continue to achieve all the air quality benefits, but at less cost to the consumer. I urge the committee to support the Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendation to eliminate the 2 percent requirement, and I especially urge you to support legislation by Senator Feinstein and by Representative Bilbray that would provide California with an early exemption from the requirement. Action this year is crucial. Refiners need about 3 years to plan and complete the plant modifications that are needed to make non-MTBE gasoline by the end of 2002. To meet this challenging timeline, refiners need to know now whether they will have to continue to use 2 percent oxygen or have the flexibility to produce non-oxygenated formulations. In closing, I would like to emphasize that California, as an arid State, is more dependent that most other States on our groundwater resources. Consequently, we crucially need the flexibility to produce RFG without oxygenates. Equally important, California RFG can be produced that maintains, and even improves upon, current air quality benefits, and we can do so at less cost if oxygenates are not required. Thank you for agreeing to hear my testimony, and I would be happy to answer any questions. Senator Inhofe. Thank you, Mr. Kenny. Mr. Campbell. STATEMENT OF ROBERT H. CAMPBELL, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SUNOCO, INC. Mr. Campbell. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Bob Campbell, and I am chairman and CEO of Sunoco, Inc. My company is one of the largest refiners and marketers of gasoline on the east coast of the United States. In this region we produce and distribute more of the clean- burning RFG required by the Clean Air Act than by any other company, so consequently we have learned firsthand about the benefits and the burdens of the existing program. We are also a manufacturer and consumer of MTBE, and we have been using it since 1980 for its high-octane qualities. After the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were passed we constructed a world-class MTBE plant in Texas; consequently, we know about all there is to know about the use of that additive in gasoline. In addition, we are also a major supplier of conventional gasoline in mid-America, and here we don't use MTBE, but we are a major buyer and blender of ethanol in gasoline. So we have extensive firsthand knowledge of both the benefits and limitations of ethanol in motor fuel. Dr. Greenbaum has given an excellent summary of the deliberations and recommendations of the Panel, and those recommendations I wholeheartedly endorse. As you know, of course, we are now planning on implementation of those recommendations. Some of them require legislative action. Public concern is, of course, about the taste and smell of drinking water containing small amounts of MTBE. Putting aside the complex question of MTBE as a health hazard, it should clearly not be getting into drinking water. But regardless of how much money is spent on tank replacement and inventory control, gasoline handled by 190 million drivers will inevitably be spilled, and we now know how persistent a contaminant MTBE can be in water. California, as it so often has done, has led the way in defining a process for eliminating the problem. Critical to that, of course, is relief from the existing 2 percent oxygen mandate. But one needs to remember that MTBE is principally used on both coasts, both the east and west coast of the United States. In fact, more MTBE is used in the 11 east coast States comprising the ozone transport region than in California-- 130,000 barrels a day versus 100,000 barrels. And I can assure you that people in Boston and Philadelphia are just as adamant about the quality of their drinking water as the people are in Sacramento and Santa Monica. Consequently, my plea to you today is to help us solve the equally serious problem of MTBE in the Northeast, and I believe that to accomplish that we need a regional solution. If the proposed legislation deals only with California, I can assure you that several of the Northeastern States are poised to enact their own local solutions. The result will be a patchwork quilt of local initiatives and regulations, and that will be a nightmare for companies attempting to reliably supply low-cost, high-quality gasoline to consumers in the 11-State region. The bottom line is that we can solve the problem in the Northeast in a manner similar to California only if we are also given relief from the 2 percent oxygen mandate. If you will do that, then we will be able to continue to supply RFG to those areas requiring it in an economic manner, in reliable quantities, with the same air quality benefits; and that reformulated gasoline will have substantially less amounts of MTBE. I will tell you quite honestly that even with all our company's experience in blending ethanol in gasoline in mid- America, I don't know how to accomplish, in a real world practical manner, the same result in a northeast RFG system. Ethanol in RFG is successfully blended in the Chicago area because it's a relatively small proportion of the supply from the manufacturers in that region. In my opinion, if the 2 percent mandate remains and we are forced to directly substitute ethanol for MTBE in the large RFG volume areas in the northeast, we're going to have a disastrous scenario for both the supplier and the consumer. Obviously, there are two very practical problems with ethanol as a blending component on the east and west coast. No. 1, of course, is the need for a reliable, adequate supply and the transportation issues between where it is currently manufactured today, and where it would be primarily used. Obviously, it has an affinity for water, and it can't be transported in common carriers, so you would have to put it in rail cars and trucks for both coasts. Let me tell you exactly what I told the Blue Ribbon Panel this spring. Given enough time and money, an enterprising ethanol industry can expand production and create new logistics systems to address the problem. But the added cost will be immense and unnecessary. Solving the logistics problem, however, will still not address ethanol's second and most critical defect, its high vapor pressure when blended into gasoline. The one thing we have learned in the past 10 years is that the most crucial characteristic of a successful RFG program is vapor pressure, or volatile organic compound--VOC--control. Higher vapor pressure means higher increased VOC emissions, which leads to more ozone pollution. It's as simple as that. The next generation of RFG in January 2000 has even more stringent restrictions on vapor pressure than current. Consequently, blending ethanol into future RFG would severely compound both the environmental and the supply problems. It is my view that ethanol cannot be practically us"
