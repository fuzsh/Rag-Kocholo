The topic of Einstein's pathway to the special theory of relativity, however, is still as much a question for debate as it was thirty or forty years ago. It is a question of fundamental significance in the history of modern physics and its discussion raises fundamental issues in the understanding of Einstein's creativity. This book is divided into four chapters. An appendix complements the main text of the book, and presents the history behind the sources mentioned in the text. The appendix allows the main text of the book to place greater emphasis on the historical profound relationships and principles, and on Einstein's path to the relativity theory. The first chapter (A) presents a critical biography of Einstein from childhood until 1908 – the year that Einstein left the Patent Office. The biography is based on primary sources. Einstein was apparently not attracted to biographies. He preferred a representation of events or relations in which the personal remains in the background. I have sought to write a biography according to these guidelines, but I do discuss a few family stories in order to clarify certain historically important topics. I start with Einstein's childhood and schooldays: Albert Einstein and the family members seem to have exaggerated the story of Albert who developed slowly, learned to talk late and whose parents thought he was abnormal. These and other stories were adopted by biographers as if they had really happened in the way that Albert and his sister told them. Hence, biographers were inspired by such stories to create a mythical public image of Albert Einstein. As a child, Albert had had a tendency toward temper tantrums. A young and impudent rebel with an impulsive and upright nature, he rebelled against authority and refused to learn by rote. He could not easily bring himself to study what did not interest him at school, especially humanistic subjects. Consequently his sister told the story that his Greek professor, to\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nwhom he once submitted an especially poor paper, went so far in his anger as to have declared that nothing would ever become of him. Albert would study subjects in advance when it came to the sciences and during the long summer vacation he independently worked his way through the entire Gymnasium syllabus. He also taught himself natural science, geometry and philosophy by reading books obtained from a poor Jewish medical student of Polish nationality, Max Talmud, and from his uncle, Jakob Einstein. I then describe Einstein's student days at the Zurich Polytechnic: he skipped classes, did not attend all the required lectures, and before sitting for an examination he studied instead from the notebooks of his good friend in class, Marcel Grossmann. Einstein the free-thinker had little respect for the two major professors at the Polytechnic – Heinrich Friedrich Weber and Jean Pernet – who eventually turned on him. His beloved science lost some of its appeal to him because Weber's lectures did not include James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. He also seldom showed up to Pernet's practical physics course. Through his forthrightness and distrust of authority he alienated his professors, especially Weber, who apparently conceived a particular dislike of him. At the Zurich Polytechnic Einstein could not easily bring himself to study what did not interest him. Most of his time he spent on his own, studying Maxwell's theory and learning at first hand from the works of the great pioneers in science and philosophy: Ludwig Boltzmann, Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, Heinrich Hertz and Ernst Mach. Einstein eventually finished first in his class in the intermediate exams, followed by his note-taker, Grossmann. It might be better, however, not to copy Einstein's recipe for studying in college: after obtaining his diploma, when he sought a university position, he was constantly turned down. Rescue finally came from Grossmann, and thanks to him and Grossmann's father Einstein obtained a post in the Patent Office. There are strong reasons to believe that it was Einstein's rare mastery of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory that ultimately prompted the Director of the Patent Office to offer him a job. And it was there, in the Patent Office that Einstein hatched his most wonderful ideas and there that he spent his Happy Bern Years. Those wonderful ideas led to his miraculous year works of 1905.\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n3\n\nEinstein had no expertise in academic matters and he was outside the academic world; nor did he meet influential professors or attend academic meetings. Rather, he discussed his ideas with his close friends and colleagues from the Patent Office. In 1907, however, he finally got his foot in the academic doorway: Einstein became a privatdozent and gave lectures at the University of Bern.1 His first students consisted of his two close friends and another colleague from the Patent Office. I end my biographical survey with the mathematician, Hermann Minkowski, Einstein's former mathematics professor at the Zurich Polytechnic. During his studies at the Polytechnic Einstein had skipped Minkowski's classes. In 1904 Max Born arrived for the first time in Göttingen. Many years later Born wrote his recollections of the period. In the summer of 1905 Minkowski and David Hilbert gave an advanced seminar on mathematical physics, relating to electrodynamical theory. Minkowski told Born later that it had come to him as a great shock when Einstein published his paper demonstrating the equivalence of the different local times of observers moving relative to each other. Minkowski had reached the same conclusions independently but had not published them because he wished first to work out the mathematical structure in all its splendor. He never made a priority claim and always gave Einstein his full share in the great discovery. Indeed, in his famous talk \"Space and Time\", Minkowski wrote that the credit for first recognizing clearly that the time of one electron is just as good as that of another, i.e., that t and t' are to be treated the same, should be given to Einstein. The second chapter (B) provides a detailed account of fin de siècle physics. The science of optics underwent drastic changes from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century two rival theories of light were dominant among scientists: the corpuscular or emission theory of light, according to which light is composed of tiny corpuscles; and the wave theory of light, according to which light is just wave-like disturbances in a medium. Isaac Newton's name was linked with the idea underlying the first theory, although Newton himself did not express a strict adherence to any of the alternatives; while Christian Huygens tended to be associated with the idea underlying the second\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\ntheory. There were several optical phenomena still requiring explanation, and the adherents of each of the two rival outlooks sought to provide such explanations and, in so doing, to bolster their own position. A major turning point in this ambiguous state of affairs was made at the beginning of the nineteenth century by Thomas Young, Dominique François Arago, Augustin-Jean Fresnel and by the discovery of interference and polarization phenomena. Fresnel and Young proposed independently that one should assume that space was filled with an allpervading subtle substance called The Luminiferous Ether. The consideration of such ether helped scientists to contradict the possibility of action-at-a-distance interaction between electrified bodies. Neither the idea of an ether nor the desire to contradict action-at-a-distance interactions were new. For example, Newton had thought of it in connection with gravitation in his attempt to find a way to avoid action-at-a-distance, and through this to derive a physical explanation for the law of gravitational attraction. Fresnel's ether was supposed to be physically elastic in order to explain the rapid transverse motion of light waves. Many problems arose from these attempts to ascribe mechanical properties to the ether, so that the waves propagating in it would possess all the properties of light. During the nineteenth century analysis of an important astronomical phenomenon led to another type of difficulty that preoccupied scientists in the field of the optics of moving bodies: the phenomenon of stellar aberration. The phenomenon of aberration of starlight was discovered by James Bradley in 1728, as a result of his efforts to detect in certain stars an annual parallax – the change in the observed location of stars as a result of the change in the annual position of the Earth, stars that had passed near the zenith directly above the plane of the Earth’s orbit were the most amenable to accurate measurement of this effect. Explaining stellar aberration was a major problem in nineteenth century physics. As interest in the wave theory of light gradually grew, the phenomenon of aberration demanded an explanation within the framework of wave theory. By 1818, in a letter to Arago, Fresnel explained that in the wave theory of light the velocity at which the waves propagate is independent of the motion of the body from which they emanate, an explanation that ran counter to the Newtonian theorem of the addition of velocities. In addition, it assumed that velocity was constant with reference to the ether. Fresnel postulated that in order to explain aberration within the framework of the new emerging wave theory of light, one was obliged to assume an ether wind or drift, penetrating freely through the pores of\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n5\n\nthe Earth, as suggested originally by Thomas Young. Fresnel expanded Young's proposal to what has come to be known as the immobile ether hypothesis. In addition to offering an explanation for the aberration, Fresnel's ether theory could shed light on the absolute motion of the Earth in the ether. If there was immobile ether it further raised the problem of why no optical experiment made on Earth had demonstrated, or could be expected to demonstrate, the motion of the Earth through the ether – whatever the optical phenomenon used to detect this motion. Newtonian classical mechanics was incapable of explaining this in a satisfactory manner. If the ether is immobile with respect to the sun, then the Earth should move with the same velocity of 30 kms/sec with respect to the ether as it moves with respect to the sun. Therefore, the velocity of the Earth relative to the immobile ether must be at least 30 kms/sec. According to Young and Fresnel's supposition, relating to an ether wind passing freely through the Earth, there must thus be a stream of the ether, an ether wind, flowing through our laboratories and attaining velocities of at least as great as 30 kms/sec. Accordingly, one should be able to measure the actual velocity of this supposed stream of ether relative to the laboratory; and from that measurement, infer the velocity of the Earth through the ether. This possibility precipitated the ether drift experiments conducted for the express purpose of measuring the velocity of the Earth relative to the ether. First order terrestrial ether drift experiments investigated effects of the Earth’s motion proportional to v/c (the aberration constant), where v is the speed of the Earth through the ether and c the speed of light. They proved incapable of revealing the Earth’s motion with respect to the immobile ether and thus all the experiments that were aimed at ascertaining this gave negative results. Fresnel tried to supply an explanation through two such experiments: Arago's experiment and that proposed by Roger Joseph Boscovich (carried out much later by Sir George Biddell Airy), whose outcome was that the motion of the planet Earth could not affect the laws of refraction. By viewing the stars with a telescope filled with water, it was hoped to disclose the Earth's motion with respect to the immobile ether. But the experiment provided negative results. Fresnel explained this result by suggesting that most of the ether is immobile, while the ether in transparent bodies, like water and glass, is slightly dragged along. Guided by this partial ether drag hypothesis he derived a formula for the speed of\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nlight in a moving medium known as Fresnel's formula, which included a dragging coefficient. Despite the success of Fresnel's formula, however, his interpretation in terms of partial ether drag remained problematic, and many authors embracing the former explicitly distanced themselves from the latter. There was, of course, a simple, alternative explanation for these experimental results, in which there would seem to be no need for the peculiar partial dragging effect in transparent matter. If all ether inside matter were fully dragged along by it, the ether at the surface of the Earth would be at rest with respect to the Earth, which would explain automatically why no ether drift was ever detected. The concept of dragged along ether was much more natural than that of immobile ether. In 1845 George Gabriel Stokes developed a model in which the Earth drags along the ether. Stellar aberration continued to provide the strongest argument against such a model, and much of Stokes' efforts went into attempts to show that aberration could be accounted for on the basis of a dragged along and on the basis of an immobile ether. In 1851 Armand Hippolyte Fizeau performed measurements of the speed of light in moving water. Fizeau's water tube experiment found that it was possible to measure the actual velocity by the interference method, and in so doing confirmed Fresnel's formula. This formula was found to represent the velocity accurately both for water and for other transparent media. In 1886, Albert Abraham Michelson, together with Edward Williams Morley, repeated the Fizeau experiment with improved accuracy. The experiment confirmed Fresnel's prediction. Michelson and Morley concluded that Fresnel had to be right and Stokes wrong. In 1881 Michelson performed a second order ether drift experiment aimed at measuring the ratio v/c to second order. The means by which this experiment endeavoured to discover the Earth's motion with respect to the ether was mainly through the use of optical instruments (interferometers). It returned a negative result. However, the celebrated Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 gave the same negative result of Michelson's first attempt in 1881, with reduced experimental error. Now both Fresnel's and Stokes' hypotheses appeared to be untenable. Meanwhile, in 1886 Hendrik Antoon Lorentz argued that all experiments could be accounted for on the basis of a theory somewhere in between Fresnel's and Stokes', a theory that contains Fresnel's coefficient and in which all moving matter partially drags along the ether.\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n7\n\nTwo major theories were offered for extending Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory to moving bodies: Heinrich Rudolf Hertz’s 1890 macroscopic electrodynamics of moving bodies, and Lorentz’s 1892 microscopic electron theory. Hertz’s theory was contradicted by Fizeau’s 1851 water tube experiment because it assumed a complete drag of the ether along with the bodies in motion. On the other hand, it was obviously compatible with the negative results of ether drift experiments. Lorentz’s theory explained all that Maxwell’s theory had already explained and left intact the intimate connection between optics and electricity discovered by Maxwell. Lorentz started from the hypothesis that electrical charges are carried by material particles called the electrons and the electrons composing ponderable matter move in immobile ether. The study of the interactions between the immobile ether and the electrons in motion accounted for the observed phenomena: Aberration and Fizeau’s 1851 experimental result both received a satisfactory explanation within Lorentz’s theory. He was able to derive the Fresnel coefficient from his theory, reinterpreting it as due to an interaction between ether and matter that required no ether drag whatsoever. In 1895, Lorentz produced a more general derivation of the Fresnel coefficient with the help of an auxiliary quantity called local time. Formally, this derivation is very close to the derivation of the dragging coefficient in special relativity, based on the relativistic addition theorem for velocities. However, all the experiments seeking to demonstrate the Earth’s motion with respect to the ether contradicted Lorentz’s fundamental hypothesis of immobile ether and moving electrons, in that they failed to reveal the preferred state of rest of the ether. For the purpose of reconciling the hypothesis of immobile ether with the negative results of the MichelsonMorley experiment, Lorentz proposed (in 1892) the contraction hypothesis (which had already been suggested by George Francis FitzGerald in 1889). Lorentz included the contraction and other compensations within later versions of his 1892 theory, his 1895, 1899 and 1904 theories of the electron. In these later versions, Lorentz formulated a theorem of corresponding states. According to this new theorem, there existed mathematical transformations that preserved the elementary electromagnetic equations of Lorentz's electron theory almost in their original form. These transformations required a linear rescaling of time with the distance coordinate x so that the time coordinate t is replaced by the local time; and, for later, more exact, higher order versions of the theorem, lengths were contracted by the factorඥͳ െ ሺ‫ݒ‬Τܿ ሻଶ . By means of\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nthese transformations, Lorentz explained the impossibility of detecting the Earth's motion by electromagnetic and optical means; or, in other terms, the motion of the Earth through the ether had (almost) no observable effect on electromagnetic and optical processes. Before 1905 Einstein had tried to discuss Fizeau's experiment as originally discussed by Lorentz. At that time he was still under the impression that the ordinary Newtonian law of addition of velocities was unproblematic. In 1907 Max Laue showed that the Fresnel dragging coefficient would follow from a straightforward application of the relativistic addition theorem of velocities. Indeed this derivation was mathematically equivalent to Lorentz's derivation of 1895. From 1907 onwards Einstein adopted Laue's derivation. When Robert Shankland asked Einstein how he had learned of the Michelson-Morley 1887 ether drift experiment, Einstein told him that he had become aware of it through the writings of Lorentz, but it had come to his attention only after 1905. Otherwise, he said, he would have mentioned it in his paper. He continued to say that the experimental results that had influenced him most were those of stellar aberration and Fizeau's water tube experiment. They were enough, said Einstein. Indeed, the famous Michelson-Morley experiment is not mentioned in the 1905 relativity paper. Curiously, however, Einstein did not mention Fizeau's experimental result either, and this is puzzling in light of the importance of the experiment in Einstein's pathway to his theory. This topic is discussed in chapter D. The third chapter (C) discusses Einstein’s path to special relativity and Henri Poincaré's contributions to the principle of relativity. There is a major problem still basically unsolved: the vast amount of evidence and sporadic pieces of primary material do not shed too much light on the overall course of Einstein's thinking between 1901 and 1904, because he published nothing on the subject of optics or electrodynamics of moving bodies (relativity) between 1901 and 1904. Apparently, therefore, neither correspondence nor any other source can be said to assist in creating a coherent story of Einstein's path to the special theory of relativity between 1901 and 1904, for there are unfortunately no relevant new letters from this period. In chapter C I confront this problem and present my story of Einstein's path to relativity between 1895 and 1905.\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n9\n\nIn 1894-1895 Einstein wrote an essay that he sent to his uncle, Cäser Koch. At the time he believed in the ether theory, but did not show any knowledge of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. In 1895, at the age of sixteen, Einstein was also familiar with the principle of relativity in mechanics. A year later, in 1895-1896, while in Aarau, Einstein conceived of a thought experiment: the chasing of a light beam thought experiment. In 1899 Einstein studied Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Around 18981900 he invented the magnet and conductor thought experiment (asymmetries in Lorentz's theory regarding the explanation of Michael Faraday's induction). Between 1899 and 1901 Einstein was occupied with the contradiction between the Galilean principle of relativity and the constancy of the velocity of light in Maxwell's theory. He was also interested in ether drift and appears to have designed at least two experiments: the first in 1899 and the second, two years later. In 1901 Einstein still accepted the Galilean kinematics of space and time, in which the Galilean principle of relativity holds true. Between 1901 and 1903 Einstein was working on two topics: the quantum of light problem and the electrodynamics of moving bodies. The two topics seemingly could, however, be said to depend on one another; they were interwoven. For the telling here, I first unravel them (in chapters C and D), and follow each in turn. Subsequently, I consider the part that Einstein's work on the quantum of light and on relativity played on his path to special relativity. We should remember that between 1901 and 1903, Einstein was still sitting in the Patent Office. One can imagine him trying to hide from his boss, writing notes on small sheets of paper and, according to reports, seeing to it that the small sheets of paper on which he was writing would vanish into his desk-drawer as soon as he heard footsteps approaching behind his door. Einstein nonetheless said that he had enjoyed considerable freedom in the worldly cloister, where during 1901-1903, he was perhaps ruminating (i.e., pondering) his best ideas, brooding upon the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty space. He tried to solve the conflict between the Galilean principle of relativity and the constancy of the velocity of light. He dropped the ether hypothesis and replaced Lorentz's theory with emission theory. Einstein seems to have engaged with emission theory for\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nan extra year, from 1903-1904 until almost spring-summer 1904, apparently, remote as possible from Lorentz's theory. Einstein discussed Fizeau's experiment using emission theory but then demonstrated why emission theories could not hold true. Towards springsummer 1904 he dropped emission theory and returned to Lorentz's theory. He tried to discuss Fizeau's experiment in Lorentz's theory, by now firmly believing that Lorentz's theory was correct. The invariance of the velocity of light however contradicted the addition rule of velocities used in mechanics. Einstein realized the difficulty in seeking to resolve this, and spent almost a year in vain trying to modify Lorentz's idea in the hope of solving the problem. In spring 1905 he found the final solution: the step, which solved his dilemma. An additional topic discussed in Chapter C is Henri Poincaré's Dynamics of the Electron and ideas in regard to the principle of relativity. I begin with Poincaré's biography followed by his possible influence on Einstein. I first present a brief biographical sketch of Poincaré, which does not in any way reflect Poincaré's rich personality and immense activity in science. It is interesting to note that, as opposed to the plethora of biographies and secondary papers studying the life and scientific contributions of Albert Einstein, one finds far fewer biographies and secondary sources that discuss Poincaré's life and work. From 1920 on Einstein became a myth and a world famous figure, whereas during his lifetime Poincaré was not a cultural icon. Despite Poincaré's brilliance in mathematics, he was to remain an internationally famous mathematician mainly within the professional circle of scientists. He published more papers than Einstein, performed research in many more branches of physics and mathematics, received more prizes on his studies and was a member of more academies world-wide. Despite this tremendous yield, Poincaré did not win a Nobel Prize. During Poincaré's travels to Europe, Africa and America, his companions noticed his broad knowledge on everything from statistics to the history and curious customs and habits of the local people. He taught almost every subject in science, possessing such an encyclopedic knowledge that he was able to engage with the outstanding questions of the time in the different branches of physics and mathematics. Indeed he altered the thinking in entire fields of science, such as non-Euclidean geometry, Arithmetic, celestial mechanics, thermodynamics and kinetic theory, optics,\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n11\n\nelectrodynamics, Maxwell's theory and other topics at the forefront of fin de siècle physical science. Prior to 1905 Poincaré had stressed the importance of the method of clocks and their synchronisation but, unlike Einstein, issues of magnet and conductor or chasing a light beam and overtaking it, were not a matter of great concern for him. In 1905 he elaborated upon Lorentz's 1904 electron theory in two papers entitled \"On the Dynamics of the Electron\". In May 1905 Poincaré sent three letters to Lorentz at the same time that Einstein wrote his famous May 1905 letter to Conrad Habicht, promising him four works, of which the fourth one was only a rough draft at that point. In the May 1905 letters to Lorentz Poincaré presented the basic equations of his 1905 Dynamics of the Electron. Hence, in May 1905, Poincaré and Einstein both had drafts of papers relating to the principle of relativity. Poincaré's draft led to a space-time mathematical theory of groups at the basis of which stood the postulate of relativity, and Einstein's draft led to a kinematical theory of relativity. Poincaré did not renounce the ether theory. He wrote a new law of addition of velocities but did not abandon the tacit assumptions made about the nature of time, simultaneity and space measurements implicit in Newtonian kinematics. Although before 1905 he questioned absolute time and absolute simultaneity, he did not make tacit new kinematic assumptions about space and time. He also did not require reciprocity of appearances and, therefore, did not discover relativity of simultaneity: those are the main hallmarks of Einstein's special theory of relativity. Nevertheless, as shown by other writers, Poincaré's theory influenced later scientists, especially Hermann Minkowski. Einstein was the first to explore the inertial mass-energy equivalence. In 1905 he showed that a change in energy is associated with a change in inertial mass, equal to the change in energy divided by c2. In 1900 Poincaré considered a device that could create and emit electromagnetic waves. The device would emit energy in all directions, as a result of which it would recoil. No motion of any other material body would compensate for the recoil at that moment. Poincaré found that as a result of the recoil of the oscillator, in the moving system, the oscillator generating the electromagnetic energy would suffer an apparent complementary force.\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn addition, in order to demonstrate the non-violation of the theorem of the motion of the centre of gravity, Poincaré needed an arbitrary convention, the fictitious fluid. Einstein had demonstrated that if the inertial mass E/c2 is associated with the energy E, and assuming the inseparability of the theorem of the conservation of mass and that of energy, then – at least as a first approximation – the theorem of the conservation of the motion of the centre of gravity would also be valid for all systems in which electromagnetic processes take place. Prior to 1905 (and also afterwards) Poincaré had not explored the inertial mass-energy equivalence. In 1908 Einstein wrote the German physicist Johannes Stark that he was a little surprised to see that Stark had not acknowledged his priority regarding the relationship between inertial mass and energy. Present-day relativistic kinematics follows the general pattern established by Einstein in 1905. Therefore, much effort has been invested in determining whether Poincaré had in fact preceded the main features of Einstein's 1905 relativistic kinematics. The history of Poincaré's contributions is usually understood in terms of Poincaré was just a step away from Einstein's 1905 special relativity. Poincaré, however, created a space-time mathematical theory of groups, at the basis of which stood the postulate of relativity, to which I also briefly refer from the philosophical point of view. Poincaré's philosophy of conventionalism sprang from his research into geometry during a period (the end of the 1880s) when non-Euclidean geometries were constantly considered a matter of possibility. Poincaré developed two kinds of conventionalism: conventionalism applicable to geometry and conventionalism for the principles of physics. Both sprang from his mathematical group theory. He adopted the notion of Lie groups, developed by the Norwegian mathematician Marius Sophus Lie, and demonstrated that all geometries could be generated from Lie groups, arriving thereby at the conclusion that they are all logically equivalent. Poincaré began to think of conventionalist ideas as a result of the development of non-Euclidean geometry in the nineteenth century. The non-Euclidean geometries arose as a logical alternative to Euclidean geometry. However, they were not considered as geometries that could represent bodies in the real world, unlike Euclidean geometry. Poincaré agreed with this contention and it underlined his philosophy of\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n13\n\nconventionalism, which complied with the basic thesis of his mathematical group theory. The final chapter (D) engages with Einstein's methodology and presents a critical analysis of his relativity theory. The status and meaning of the special theory of relativity is still as much a question for debate as it was a hundred years ago. This chapter discusses the various methodological problems in special relativity that occupied scholars when Einstein's relativity theory was first introduced. Fairly soon after Einstein had formulated his relativity theory, his friend Paul Ehrenfest reasoned that the theory was simply a reformulation of Lorentz's electrodynamic theory. Einstein's response to his friend was that the theory of relativity is a theory of principle; and he explained that, beyond kinematics, the 1905 heuristic relativity principle could offer new connections between non-kinematical concepts. Indeed when Einstein appreciated that the results of the Dayton Clarence Miller ether drift experiments might be confirmed, he declared that relativity theory could not be maintained, since the experiments would then prove that, relative to the coordinate systems of the appropriate state of motion (the Earth), the velocity of light in a vacuum would depend upon the direction of motion. With this, the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, which forms one of the two foundation pillars on which the theory is based, would be refuted. He was prepared to give his relativity theory up completely in the case of irrefutable contrary empirical evidence since special relativity is a heuristic system of two principles; it is not a constructive theory like the ether-based electron theory, then one cannot modify principles without giving up the whole theory. However, a theory of principle has a solid theoretical basis, and therefore there is little chance that experiments like that of Miller's (and also like that of Walter Kaufmann's discussed in Chapter D) would turn out to be right. Another topic discussed in this chapter is Einstein's methodology. Einstein himself seems to have made different statements regarding the process that results in a new idea, ranging from discovering the principle of relativity to the theory of relativity as an invention. Einstein desired to invent, and he compared the inventive science to music (\"Thinking for its own sake, as in music\"), and music was also an inspiration for his scientific inventions. Einstein characterized the process\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nof his creativity using the words: free creations of the human mind. Those are theoretical scientific ideas and musical sonatas, both enhancing one another. For Einstein, the process of thinking consists of two stages. The first stage is primary non-verbal in nature. Words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in his mechanism or thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are clear images. Many of the crucial thought experiments Einstein later reports confirm the existence of this first stage of the thinking process (for instance, the chasing a light beam and the magnet and conductor thought experiments). At a secondary stage, it was necessary for him to transform the results of the primary process into forms communicable to others. The need to put ideas into communicable form led Einstein to search throughout his early life for people to act as sounding boards for his ideas. At the age of four or five, young Albert experienced a wonder. His father Hermann showed him a compass. This experience, so recounts Einstein himself in his Autobiographical Notes, changed his life. His thinking went on for the most part without use of signs (words), and he wondered quite spontaneously about this experience. The significance of a wonder for Einstein was that Einstein had the ability to keep the child alive in the man. Towards the end of his life Einstein mused that he was brought to the formulation of relativity theory in good part because he kept asking himself questions concerning space and time that only children wonder about. For Einstein a wonder was an apparent conflict between a phenomenon and our established conceptual framework. Einstein's 1905 relativity paper became famous as the one in which he inferred odd and curious effects. One immediate consequence of this was that of discussions of the misunderstandings and paradoxes in the theory. Einstein wrote in his 1905 relativity paper that the theory developed here was based on the kinematics of the rigid body. It was shown that a rigid body cannot exist in the special theory of relativity. In addition, it was claimed that special relativity assumes a connection between synchronisation and contraction; a connection that was challenged. It should be keep in mind that a discussion of these topics requires additional philosophical reinforcement (which is beyond the scope of this\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n15\n\nbook); and, therefore, the discussion of these topics in this book is restricted. Reformulations of the elements of the relativity theory that appear to render the theory applicable to similar phenomena were also suggested: distant simultaneity can be defined with respect to a given frame of reference without any reference to synchronised clocks; and a theory of relativity without light was posited. In 1905 Einstein presented the Clock Paradox and in 1911 Paul Langevin expanded Einstein's findings to human observers, as the Twin Paradox. I explain the difference between Einstein and Langevin. Einstein did not present the so-called Twin Paradox, but later continued to speak about the clock paradox. Einstein might not have been interested in the question of what happens to the observers themselves, possibly because he dealt with measurement procedures, clocks and measuring rods. Einstein's observers were measuring time with these clocks and measuring rods and he might not have been interested in studying the so-called biology of the observers themselves, as to whether they were getting older, younger or had undergone any other changes. Such changes appeared to be beyond the scope of his principle of relativity, or kinematics. The processes and changes occurring among the observers seemed to be more appropriate for philosophical rather than scientific discussions. To the later writers, who criticized Einstein's clock paradox, such as the anti-Semites who blamed the theory of relativity as an anti-German science, he quickly replied with witty retorts. In 1907 Einstein discussed with Wilhelm Wien the occurrence of superluminal velocities in dispersive and absorptive media. He tried to present to Wien an expression for the group velocity in dispersive media based on his 1905 addition theorem for relative velocities, which he claimed to be valid for absorptive media, and to demonstrate the impossibility of superluminal velocities. However, he recognized that his expression required an amendment and correction. Having failed to convince Wien, he was finally confused, lacking a correct expression for the group velocity in dispersive media. However, he wrote to Wien that it was beyond doubt that the electromagnetic theory of dispersion could never yield superluminal velocity for the propagation of an optical signal.\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe should recall that Einstein was occupied among others, with the microstructure of radiation (light quantum paper). In 1905 the well-known physicist Max Planck was coeditor of the Annalen der Physik, and he accepted Einstein's paper on light quanta for publication, even though he disliked the idea of light quanta. Einstein's relativity paper was received by the Annalen der Physik at the end of June 1905 and Planck was the first scientist to take note of Einstein's relativity theory and to report favorably on it. In his 1905 relativity paper Einstein used a seemingly conventional notion, light complex, and did not refer to his novel quanta of light heuristic with respect to the principle of relativity. He chose the language light complex for which no clear definition could be given. With hindsight, however, in 1905 Einstein had made exactly the right choice not to mix concepts from his quantum paper with those from his relativity paper. He focused on finding the solution to his relativity problem, whose farreaching ramifications Planck had already sensed. Before ending with Dayton Clarence Miller's experiments I discuss Einstein’s 1905 relativity theory of the motion of an electron. He obtained expressions for the longitudinal and transverse masses of the electron using the principle of relativity and that of the constancy of the velocity of light. It was quite natural and presumably expected that Einstein's expression for the mass of the electron would seem to resemble that of Lorentz. And indeed, I have already remarked that Einstein's above solution appeared to Ehrenfest to be very similar to Lorentz's one: both clearly suggested a deformed electron. Einstein commented on Ehrenfest's paper and characterized his work as a theory of principle and reasoned that, beyond kinematics, the 1905 heuristic relativity principle could offer new connections between non-kinematical concepts. Walter Kaufmann concluded that his own measuring procedures were not compatible with the hypothesis posited by Lorentz (Lorentz's electron) and Einstein. However, unlike Ehrenfest, he gave the first clear account of the basic theoretical difference between Lorentz's and Einstein's views. Finally, Alfred Bucherer conducted experiments that confirmed Lorentz's and Einstein's models, while Max Born analyzed the problem of a rigid body and demonstrated the existence of a limited class of rigid motions, concluding that the main result was a confirmation of Lorentz's formula. The final topic is that of Miller's ether drift experiments. The negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment stimulated many repetitions of this experiment during the next fifty years, especially in light of the\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n17\n\nimplications of Einstein's special theory of relativity. Every trial of this experiment yielded a null result within the accuracy of the observations. Then in the 1920s, the history of relativity took some interesting turns. A repetition of the experiment, performed by Miller, appeared to be perplexing, as he had observed very small fringe displacements. There was great excitement amongst experimentalists and the scientific community; and even Einstein declared that, if these results would be substantiated, he would give up his special theory of relativity, and with it also his general theory of relativity! Einstein nonetheless announced that there was practically no likelihood of Miller being right, and upon hearing the rumor about Miller's experiments for the first time, Einstein produced one of his classical aperçus: \"The Lord God is Subtle, but malicious he is not\".\n\nA. FROM EINSTEIN'S CHILDHOOD TO PATENT OFFICE\n\n1 Einstein's Parents and Sister Maja Albert was born on the morning of March 14, 1879, at 11:30 a.m, in the city of Ulm, at the former Bahnhofstraße 135B, which vanished in 1945 (Birth Certificate, CPAE 1, Doc. 1). It is quite symbolic that Einstein was born in a street named \"Station Street\", as if he was born into his thought experiments of stations and trains. The house in Ulm where he was born no longer stands. World War II reduced it to rubble. A street in Ulm has since been named Einsteinstraße.2 Ulm is a Swabian town on the Danube, in the state of Württemberg, in southern Germany. In the correction to Seelig's biography it was noted that the word Swabian should not be taken literally, because in Switzerland the Germans were all called Swabians. Einstein's childhood was spent in Munich, the capital of Bavaria, but Einstein was especially Swabian because he had a Swabian sense of humour. There is a particularly Swabian good-natured humour, curiously like English humour, and a Swabian taste for practical jokes (EA 39-084; Vallentin 1954, 6).3 On his birth certificate Einstein is recorded as born to the merchant Hermann Einstein and his wife Pauline née Koch, both of the Israelite religion. Helen Dukas told Abraham Pais that Einstein's name was supposed to be Abraham, for his paternal grandfather, Abraham Rupert Einstein, but his parents found the name too Jewish and adopted only the initial A, naming him Albert instead (Pais 1982, 35; Calaprice 2005, 352). Hermann Einstein was a native of the small town of Buchau on the Federsee and Pauline Koch of Kannstatt on the Neckar. He was a merchant who possessed a particular inclination for technical matters. He ran an electrical business and enjoyed solving technical problems and the mathematics taught in the lower forms of the German secondary schools. Music meant little to him as a distant and not very necessary pleasure. He\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n19\n\ndid not concern himself with politics but he loved literature and, in the lamp-lit evenings, he read Schiller and Heine (Talmey 1932a, 160, 1932b, 68; Reiser 1930, 26). Albert Einstein was thus quite the opposite of his father, except for his love of mathematics. Empires and rising mighty powers disgusted him and his concern with politics was as a pacifist and humanist. Furthermore, he showed no inclination for commercial and business matters. Hermann Einstein had several brothers and sisters. Jakob Einstein, a younger brother, was the only brother to acquire an higher education, attending the Polytechnische Schule (polytechnic school) in Stuttgart from 1867 to 1869. He served as an engineer in the army during the FrancoPrussian War and in 1876 he moved to Munich and started a gas-fitting and plumbing firm (CPAE 1, l-li, notes 7-9). In contrast to Albert's father, his mother Pauline Koch, was in many respects more serious and did not always see the world through his optimistic eyes. She enjoyed her life, loved people and her household and possessed a genuine and hearty humour (of the Swabian kind). Of little Albert, she often prophesied that \"some day he will be a great professor\" (Reiser 1930, 27). Einstein's mother had a brother, Cäser Koch, Einstein's uncle. He lived in Stuttgart and often visited Einstein's family. In January 1885 Uncle Koch returned to Germany from Russia, where some of his family were living. With him he brought a model steam engine as a present for Albert purchased during a visit to Munich that year. Shortly afterwards Uncle Koch married and moved to Antwerp – where the young Albert was subsequently taken on a conducted tour. The uncle was a grain merchant, hardly close to science and physics, but nevertheless it was to Cäser that Einstein was to send, as a boy of sixteen, his first essay on physics. Regarding religion, the family never attended the local synagogue, nor did they keep a kosher home. Hermann saw in Jewish customs and traditions \"an ancient superstition\". There is one story that sounds more like a family legend or, better, an Einstein anecdote, than a reality. The family had one particularly hard-bitten agnostic uncle, whom Einstein used as a peg for an old Jewish joke. He would always describe with relish how he had surprised him one day in full formal dress preparing to go to the synagogue. The uncle had responded to the nephew's astonishment at seeming him there with the warning: \"Ah, but you never know\". Thus,\n\n20\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\nwrites Ronald Clark in his biography, Einstein was nourished on a family tradition that had broken with authority; one that dissented, sought independence and deliberately did not tow the line (Clark 1971, 8-9).4 The story perfectly suits both Einstein's Swabian sense of humour and the legend of Einstein the atheist. Einstein later, in Zurich of 1909, displayed an atheistic approach to religious issues (Seelig, 1954, 133, 1956a, 113). Though he would identify with great passion and care with his tribe, the Jewish people, and endeavoured to assist the Jews and the Jewish people on every occasion, he himself was not religious. On November 18, 1881, a daughter was born to Hermann and Pauline. She was named Maria (Miriam), but throughout her life she was called Maja. In 1924, in her Biographical Sketch (after Einstein had become world famous), Maja recounts a family story: when the two-and-a-half-year-old Albert was told of the arrival of his little sister, with whom he could play, he must have imagined a kind of toy, for at the sight of his new sister he asked, with great disappointment, \"Yes, but where are its wheels?\" [\"Ja, aber wo hat es den seine Rädchen?\"] (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1vii, 1924c, xviii). The famed psychoanalyst Erik Erikson explained his interpretation of the story (Erikson 1979, 152): \"Now, as to the little wheels, the German word for it is Rädchen, or in Swabian, Rädele, which rhymes with that for little girl (Mädchen, or Mädele). Is it not possible that a play with rhymes began early in this thoughtful child, even as it continued throughout his life as an humorous need at the oddest moments 'ein Gedichte zu mache' – to make a little poem or 'ditty'? More, one might consider a special preoccupation with 'the way things rhyme' to be an important trend throughout Albert's development\".\n\nMaja recounted that Albert as a child would play by himself for hours. As a boy he \"developed slowly in childhood, and he had difficulty with language that those around him feared he would never learn to speak. But this fear also proved unfounded\" (Winteler-Einstein 1924b xlviii-lxvi; 1924c, xviii). In 1930 Einstein's son-in-law, Anton Reiser (Rudolf Kayser), recounted the same story, \"Slowly, and only after much difficulty, he learned to talk. His parents thought he was abnormal. The hired governess called the still, backward, slow-speaking Albert, 'Pater Langweil' (Father Bore)\" (Reiser 1930, 27).5\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n21\n\nThe elderly Einstein also recalled in a letter from 1954 to Sybille Blinoff: \"My parents were worried because I started to talk comparatively late, and they consulted the doctor because of it\". Einstein could not say how old he was at the time, but admitted that he was certainly not younger than three. He also added that his later development was completely normal except for the peculiarity that he used to repeat his own words softly (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 14; CPAE 1, note 37, 1vii). Maja too reports on this strange linguistic habit. Every sentence Albert uttered, no matter how routine, he would repeat to himself softly, moving his lips. This odd habit persisted until he was seven (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1vii, 1924c, xviii). In the above 1954 letter Einstein did go on to say, \"Also, I never exactly became an orator later\" (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 14). It appears that it did indeed take Einstein quite a long time to become a good lecturer. Maja, Albert Einstein, and the family members seemed to have exaggerated the story of Albert who developed slowly, learned to talk late and whose parents thought he was abnormal. There is no doubt that there is grain of truth to these stories and Maja and Einstein recount their recollections in all sincerity. These stories, however, sound like family tales, and as such may be exaggerated. These and other stories were then adopted by biographers as if they had really happened in the way that Maja and Albert had told them. Biographers were thus inspired by them to create a widespread mythical public image of Albert Einstein that embodies stories about Einstein the retarded genius.6\n\n2 The Move to Munich and the Electric Firm At the time of Albert's birth, Hermann Einstein, age thirty-two, was in a business partnership with a cousin. At the beginning of 1882, when Albert was about eighteen months old, the family moved to Munich (Talmey 1932a, 160, 1932b, 68). The decision was of two-fold significance. First, Hermann's younger brother, Jakob, had finished his studies in engineering and started the plumbing and electrical business in Munich. Since he now wished to borrow money from Hermann's wife's family, he prevailed upon Hermann to join in the venture, both personally as business manager and with a large investment (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1i, 1924c, xvi). In 1885 they inaugurated the J. Einstein & Co. Electrotechnical Factory. Second, the world was beginning to install electric lighting and, although the Einstein enterprise had good prospects in Munich Jakob Einstein was\n\n22\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\napparently more ambitious. He wanted to produce on a large scale, to construct a large plant, a dynamo of his own invention, and none of these two achievements was possible without financial assistance, i.e., they required substantial funds. The entire family, and especially Hermann's father-in-law Julius Koch, who lived with the Einsteins for some years after his wife's death in 1886, participated financially, making the new enterprise possible (CPAE 1, li, note 12). The business failed in Munich. Maja did not really understand why this gigantic enterprise failed to prosper. She assumed that Jakob Einstein, constantly seeking novelty and change was unable to learn from failure. Hermann Einstein was also not of help and it was the wealthy Koch who paid (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1i-1ii, 1924c, xvi). In other words, the children of Hermann Einstein very likely grew up with the understanding that they had a rich grandfather, Julius Koch, who was willing to invest, without which the firm could not have survived; and even when it was finally relocated from Munich, the rich Koch continued to pay. The ambitious uncle, Jakob Einstein, who invented a large dynamo but had a small firm and few funds, invested a lot of money in his inventions but could not learn from his failure. Their father was easily drawn into the business but could not contribute to its flourishing. In a word, the children were disappointed with commercial and business matters. In Munich of the 1880s there were few social and religious contrasts to be seen. The Jews, although united in common interests with the Christians, lived, as everywhere and at all times, in certain seclusion. Einstein's childhood was thus passed in a characteristically Jewish environment (Reiser 1930, 24). In Munich the family shared an house together with Jakob Einstein's family. The electro-technical factory adjoined the house. A large garden shaded by big trees separated the two buildings from the main road and kept the noise of the city away from the peaceful residence of the two families. There they associated little with other people. Albert passed his boyhood in this environment, until he was fifteen years old (Talmey 1932a, 160-161, 1932b, 68). The children of the family and other relatives often got together in Albert's parents' garden in Munich. However, Albert seldom joined their boisterous games, occupying himself with quieter things. As a child he preferred\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n23\n\nworking on puzzles, doing fretsaw work and erecting complicated structures with the set of stone building blocks for children by Anker, Ankersteinbaukasten. His favourite pastime was to build multi-storied houses of cards, as high as fourteen stories (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1vii1ix, 1924c, xviii-xix).\n\n3 Rebellious and Creative In 1940, Einstein recounted in a draft of a letter to Philipp Frank that he had taken violin lessons from age six to fourteen but had had no luck with his teachers, for whom music did not transcend mechanical practice (CPAE 1, 1viii, note. 39). Until Albert was twelve the violin lessons gave him no pleasure, remaining only a duty as burdensome as school. His musical experience grew out of listening and pleasure in his playing came but slowly (Reiser 1930, 31). Indeed, Albert the boy showed little sign of behaving in an expected way. At the age of six, for example, he referred to his music teacher \"Du, Herr Schmied...\" instead of \"Sie, Herr Schmied...\". In Germany one used the polite form \"Sie\" for adults and for people who were not members of one's family, while \"Du\" was used only within the family, among children, and between close friends (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1vii-1viii, 1924c, xviii-xix). At the age of five-six Albert also received his first preschool instruction at home from a woman teacher. Albert's sister Maja, who was probably quite annoyed with her brother from time to time, as he sometimes threw things at her, wrote in 1924 that Albert had inherited from his grandfather Julius Koch a tendency toward violent temper tantrums. Indeed people later spoke of Einstein's impulsive albeit upright nature (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1vii, 1924c, xviii; Seelig 1954, 44, 1956a, 38). Albert opposed authority as well illustrated by the following tale. Maja, as she remembered, saw that Albert's \"face would turn completely yellow, the tip of his nose snow-white, and he was no longer in control of himself. On one such occasion he grabbed a chair and struck at his teacher, who was so frightened that she ran away terrified and was never seen again\" (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1vii, 1924c, xviii); for the excellent reason that she had probably criticized the young Albert.\n\n24\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\n4 Einstein Cannot Take Authority and Demands for Obedience 4.1 Primary School In October 1885, when Albert was seven, he entered the public primary school, öffentliche Volksschule. There were no Jewish schools and no secular schools in Munich at that time. Thus Hermann and Pauline registered young Albert for the Volksschule Peterschule, a Catholic elementary school near their home. As the one Jew alongside seventy Catholic children he learned Catholic lessons and made good progress in them. He was even able to assist his classmates (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1viii, 1924c, xix). In 1886, Albert's mother, Pauline, wrote to her mother Jette Koch saying that Albert was once again top of his class and had received a brilliant report (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 19). Albert had a rather strict teacher whose methods included teaching children arithmetic, especially the multiplication tables, with the help of a whack on the hands. This style of teaching was not unusual at the time and \"prepared the children early for their future role as citizens\" (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1viii, 1924c, xix). On the whole, Einstein felt that school was not so very different from any other place where individuals were subjected to the power of an organization that pressurized them, leaving no area open within which they might carry on some activity more suited to their nature. The students were required to learn mechanically the material presented to them, with the main emphasis placed on inculcating obedience and discipline (Frank 1949, 23, 1947, 10). Einstein told Alexander Moszkowski with bitter sarcasm that his teachers in the elementary school had the character of army sergeants, while those in the gymnasium (the secondary school) were of the nature of lieutenants. Moszkowski explained that both terms were used in the pre-armistice sense and Einstein's words had been directed against the self-opinionated tone and customs of the military schools of earlier times (Moszkowski 1921a, 221, 1921b, 223). Frank reported exactly the same story, based on Moszkowski, foregrounding the historical aspect of the problem. He explained that the sergeants in the German army of Wilhelm II were notorious for their coarse and often brutal behaviour toward the common soldiers; while the\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n25\n\nlieutenants were members of the upper classes and did not come into direct contact with the men, extracting their desire for power in an indirect manner. Thus, when Einstein compared his teachers to sergeants and lieutenants, he perceived their task as that of enforcing mechanical order upon the pupils (Frank 1949, 24-25, 1947, 11).7 Einstein said later that the worst of all, in his view, was when a school was mainly run by means of fear, power and artificial authority. He thought that such treatment destroyed the healthy feelings, integrity and selfconfidence of the pupils, producing only servile helots (Seelig 1954, 17, 1956a, 14). A few words about Einstein's religious feelings. The older more tolerant and humanist Einstein spoke with Frank while the latter was writing Einstein's biography in the 1940s. In this connection Frank reported that it was very characteristic of the young Einstein that he saw no noticeable difference between what he had learned of the Catholic religion at school and the rather vaguely remembered remnants of the Jewish tradition with which he was familiar at home (Frank 1949, 23, 1947, 10). It is important to emphasize that the young Albert, only six or seven years old, when he entered public school, his religious instruction, then compulsory in Bavaria, also had to begin. A liberal spirit and nondogmatic in matters of religion, which both parents had brought from their respective homes, prevailed within the Einstein family. There was no discussion of religious matters or rules, since Albert was obliged to receive Jewish religious instruction, he was taught at home by a distant relative (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1ix, 1924c, xx). Reiser tells the story of the teacher bringing a nail to the class one day. The Catholic teacher of religious knowledge liked Einstein. \"But one day this teacher brought a large nail to class and told the pupils that it was the nail with which the Jews had nailed Jesus to the Cross\". The incident stimulated anti-Semitic feelings in the pupils which was turned against their Jewish fellow-student Einstein. For the first time Albert experienced the frightful venom of anti-Semitism (Reiser 1930, 30). Frank, in contrast, wrote that the teacher told the pupils, \"The nails with which Christ was nailed to the Cross looked like this\". He did not add, however, as sometimes happens, that the Crucifixion was the work of the Jews. Nor did the idea enter the minds of the students that because of this they must alter their relations with their classmate Albert. Nevertheless,\n\n26\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\naccording to Frank, Einstein found this kind of teaching rather uncongenial, because it recalled the brutal act connected with it and because he sensed that it could awaken latent sadistic tendencies (Frank 1949, 22-23, 1947, 9). Max Jammer explains in his book, Einstein and Religion, that Frank's biography is known to be based largely on epistolary correspondence with Einstein, whereas Reiser's account is based on personal conversations. In his brief preface to Reiser's biography, Einstein declared, \"I found the facts of the book duly accurate\". Jammer notes that it is of course difficult today to determine which of the two versions is the true one. It is also difficult to assess how such an anti-Semitic incident, had it really happened, might have affected Albert's attitude toward Judaism (Jammer 1999, 21).8 Einstein was about to leave elementary school. Moszkowski described him at the age of eight or nine: \"He presented the picture of a shy, hesitating, unsociable boy, who passed on his way alone, dreaming to himself, and going to and from school without feeling the need of a comrade. He was nicknamed 'Biedermeier' (Honest John), because he was looked on as having a pathological love for truth and justice\" (Moszkowski 1921a, 220, 1921b, 222). The pathological love for truth (the Biedermeier trait) was also described later, in 1952, by Einstein's former classmate, Hans Byland, at the secondary school Aargau Cantonal School (Seelig 1954, 17, 1956a, 14). Frank adopted Moszkowski's description. According to Frank, when Albert was nine years old and in the final year of elementary school he still lacked fluency of speech, and everything he said was expressed only after thorough consideration and reflection. In the English translation of Frank's biography of Einstein \"(Honest John)\" is added in parentheses for the English reader. No evidence of any special talent was revealed at the time and his mother occasionally remarked: \"Maybe he will become a great professor someday\" but Frank noted: \"perhaps she meant only that he might develop into some sort of eccentric\" (Frank 1949, 23, 1947, 10). In this context, Reiser wrote of the young Albert, however, that his mother often prophesied: \"Someday he will be a great professor\" (Reiser 1930, 27). I have already remarked that in 1886, when Albert was eight, Pauline had written to her mother, Jette Koch, saying that Albert was top of his class and had received a brilliant report (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 19). Albert's mother clearly recognized that her son was talented and it does not seem that she thought he would develop into some sort of eccentric.\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n27\n\nFrank probably based his above report on one of Maja's stories pertaining to Einstein's early childhood.\n\n4.2 Secondary School On October 1, 1888, at the age of nine and a half, Albert entered the Luitpold Gymnasium. The building was almost completely destroyed during World War Two and today the school is called after Albert Einstein, Gymnasium Albert Einstein, even though, as we shall soon see, Einstein would not have settled down well in this school. In accord with the Gymnasium's humanist orientation, primary emphasis was placed on Classical languages, Latin and later Greek, while mathematics and the natural sciences received less emphasis (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1x, 1924c, xx). At the time, it was more common for well-to-do Jewish families to send their children to Realschulen, which offered a more practical education centered on modern culture and the sciences – specializing in sciences (Mosse 1964, 3). Albert's parents choice of a Gymnasium, with its emphasis on Classical languages and literature – specializing in linguistic and humanistic studies, was somewhat unusual. In retrospect, Einstein apparently felt a Realschulen would have been the better choice (Einstein to Hans Albert Einstein, January 25, 1918, CPAE 8, Doc. 442). In 1955 – the year Einstein died – he attested that, as a pupil in the Gymnasium he had been neither particularly good nor bad. His principal weakness was a poor memory and especially a poor memory for words and texts. In language studies Albert was only mediocre, lacking both phonetic, and the mnemonic, gift. He hated the burden of so much memorizing and showed not the slightest talent for learning by rote, which for the study of Classical languages was particularly necessary. Albert the rebel refused to study the humanities and refused to learn by rote. Indeed, he found it hard to study what did not interest him (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 19-20, 28; Reiser 1930, 37). Einstein told Frank about the spiritless and mechanistic method of teaching at school, which seemed pointless when he confronted difficulties because of his poor memory for words. He said that he preferred to accept any kind of punishment rather than having to learn things by heart (Frank 1949, 24-25, 1947, 11).\n\n28\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\nEinstein was not as good in Latin as he was in the natural sciences and he rebelled against authority, and Maja told the story of this that has since been repeated in many biographies: \"His Greek professor, to whom he once submitted an especially poor paper, went so far in his anger to declare that nothing would ever become of him. And in fact Albert Einstein never did attain a professorship of Greek grammar\" (WintelerEinstein 1924b, 1x-1ix, 1924c, xx). The older Einstein told Seelig the same story, but that it was his Latin master who had prophesied: \"You will never amount to anything, Einstein\" (Seelig 1954, 15, 1956a, 12). In light of the growing fame of Einstein the genius, this anecdote indeed seemed incredible and so his biographers grabbed at the story. For instance, Clark told the story in his biography in the following way, a family legend tells that \"when Hermann Einstein asked his son's headmaster what profession his son should adopt, the answer was simply: 'It doesn't matter; he'll never make a success of anything' \" (Clark 1971, 27). Einstein was indeed very talented in the sciences. At fourteen he had already mastered higher mathematics, which the secondary school, based on humanist principles, did not teach (Reiser 1930, 37). In the Gymnasium Albert was supposed to begin the study of algebra and geometry at the age of thirteen. By that time however he already had a predilection for solving complicated problems in applied arithmetic, although the computational errors he made kept him from appearing particularly talented in the eyes of his teachers. He then wanted to see whether he could learn about these subjects in advance of their being taught, and so during his vacation he asked his parents to obtain the textbooks for him. He forgot all about playing and playmates, but set out instead to work on the theorems, not by accepting the proofs from books but rather by attempting to prove them for himself. He sat all alone for days, immersed in the search for solutions and proofs, and he often arrived at proofs that differed from those found in the books. During this vacation period Albert independently worked his way through the entire prospective Gymnasium mathematics syllabus (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xi, 1924c, xx).\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n29\n\n5 Einstein Teaches Himself Natural Science and Philosophy 5.1 Max Talmud Recommends Bernstein and Kant The Jewish community had obtained free meals with the Einstein family for a poor Jewish medical student of Polish nationality, Max Talmud (who later changed his name to Max Talmey when he immigrated to the United States and became an ear-nose-and-throat doctor). Each Thursday Albert's parents invited Talmud to dinner, a practice that was a form of customary beneficence silently exercised in Jewish circles. It was Talmud who initiated Albert into the world of natural science and philosophical thought (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xii, 1924c, xx-xxi; Reiser 1930, 36). In 1932, Talmud recalled those visits to the Einstein's family home. Early in the winter of 1889-1890, shortly after he had graduated as a medical student at the University of Munich, he was introduced into the comfortable, cheerful Einstein home. Talmud met Albert, an handsome, dark-haired, brown-eyed boy, then in the third grade of the Luitpold Gymnasium. Although Talmud was his senior by eleven years, a close friendship soon developed between them, for Albert was able to converse with a college graduate on subjects beyond the comprehension of children of his own age. He showed a particular inclination towards physics and took pleasure in talking about physical phenomena (Talmey 1932b, 6869). Talmud gave him Aaron David Bernstein's Naturwissenschaftlichen Volksbücher (Popular Books on Physical Science), Ludwig Büchner's Kraft und Stoff (Force and Matter) to read; two works that were then quite popular in Germany. Einstein later said that indeed at the age of thirteen he had read with enthusiasm Büchner's Force and Matter, but when he grew up he perceived its philosophical weakness and found it to be rather childish in its ingenuous realism (Reiser 1930, 38; Seelig 1954, 14, 1956a, 12). Talmud recalled that Albert was at the time profoundly impressed by these books, especially Bernstein's books, which describe physical phenomena lucidly and engagingly, and had a great influence on Albert, enhancing considerably his interest in physical science. \"He never forgot Bernstein's books\" (Talmey 1932a, 162). The elderly Einstein recollected memories from reading Bernstein's books in his Autobiographisches (Autobiographical Notes) (Einstein 1949, 1415):\n\n30\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office \"At the age of twelve-sixteen I familiarized myself with elements of mathematics together with the principles of differential and integral calculus. […] I also had the good fortune of getting to know the essential results and methods of the entire field of the natural sciences in an excellent popular exposition, which limited itself almost throughout to qualitative aspects (Bernstein's People's Books on Natural Science, a work of five or six volumes), a work which I read with breathless attention\".\n\nBernstein's books were very popular little works. Twenty-one of them were published and they had at that time an extraordinary large circulation. They offered a gaily-coloured, beautiful atlas of nature presented within the limits of a child's comprehension. These volumes were less involved with theoretical physics. They were indeed an atlas that presented the wonders of science; and as such the emphasis was on technical innovations, applied science, new horizons in planetary and comet discoveries, Earth science, Darwin's theory and so forth. The books supplied scientific answers to children's and lay people's questions and Bernstein often presented the explanations using imaginary fantastic stories (Reiser 1930, 36; Bernstein 1867-1870). Starting in the third volume, Bernstein began to explain electricity and magnetism (Bernstein 1880 3). Volume 8 contains an essay \"On the Rotation of the Earth\", the first chapter of which is Die Uhr (The clock). Bernstein starts with an explanation of our tacit notion of a clock from daily life and then relates it to the daily rotation of the Earth (Bernstein 1880 8, 88-92). He then describes the pendulum (Bernstein 1880 8, 93100) and the machinery of pocket watches that causes the \"Tick-Tock\"; finally he discusses in a few pages the rotation of the Earth (Bernstein 1880 8,106-109). This followed by an essay, \"On The Speed of Light\", the first chapter of which is \"On Light\". Bernstein begins the essay by declaring: \"Light travels forty thousand miles per second!\" A modern day equivalent of this is almost 306,000 kilometers per second (Bernstein 1880 8, 124). He then discusses attempts to measure the velocity of light by two ways: one by Jupiter satellites, and the other that of Bradley's attempts (Bernstein 1880 8,133-147). After science and mathematics Talmud went on to philosophy. He recommended Immanuel Kant's Critiques of Pure Reason to Einstein and philosophy then became a frequent subject of their conversations. Talmud had recommended that Albert read Kant although he was only thirteen years old at the time. Even at that age, however, the works of Kant, \"difficult as they are to most readers, seemed to be clear to him\" (Talmey\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n31\n\n1932b, 69). \"Kant became Albert's favourite philosopher after he had read through his 'Critique of Pure Reason' and the works of other philosophers\" (Talmey 1932a, 164). Einstein had read all three main works of Kant before he was sixteen: Kritik der reinen Vernunft (Critique of Pure Reason), Kritik der praktischen Vernunft (Critique of Practical Reason), and Kritik der Urteilskraft (Critique of Judgment). During the same period Einstein was also becoming immersed in music. In 1940 he told Frank that he had really begun to learn the violin only when he was about thirteen years old, mainly after he had fallen in love with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's sonatas. Einstein felt that his attempt to reproduce the artistic content and singular grace of Mozart's sonatas compelled him to improve his technique, which he achieved without practicing systematically. \"I believe, on the whole, that love is a better teacher than sense of duty – with me, at least, it certainly was\" (CPAE 1, 1viii, note. 39).\n\n5.2 Einstein Reads a Small Geometry Book In addition to Bernstein's books, Einstein also read a geometry book and taught himself geometry. Talmud says that, contrary to popular belief, Albert had an unusual predilection for mathematics and because of this Talmud gave him, after he entered the fourth grade, Theodor Spieker's Lehrbuch der ebenen geometrie mit übungsaufgaben für höhere lehranstalten (Textbook of Plane Geometry with Exercises for HighSchool), a popular textbook from 1890 (Talmey 1932b, 69). Talmud used to visit Albert's home every week and whenever he came Albert delighted in showing him new problems from the book that he had solved during the previous week. After a period of only a few months he had worked his way through the entire book of geometry (Talmey 1932a, 163-164). Geometry was not yet an assigned study in Albert's secondary school. That would only begin a little later. The twelve-year-old Albert, however, already possessed a geometry textbook that caused him tremendous excitement. Reiser refers to this textbook as \"The first small geometry book held in his tender hands\" (Reiser 1930, 35). Could this have been Spieker's geometry book? Maja reports that at that time Albert's Uncle Jakob, an engineer with a comprehensive mathematical education, set difficult mathematical problems for Albert. Albert invariably found a correct solution and even found an entirely original proof for the Pythagorean Theorem. When he\n\n32\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\nobtained such results Albert \"was overcome with great happiness\" says Maja, \"and was already then aware of the direction in which his talents were leading him\" (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xi-1xii, 1924c, xx). Moszkowski reported that Einstein had plunged himself for three weeks into the task of solving the Pythagorean Theorem, using all his power of thought. \"He came to consider similarity of triangles (by dropping a perpendicular from one vertex of the right-angled triangle on to the hypotenuse), and was thus led to a proof for which he had so ardently longed!\" (Moszkowski 1921a, 222-223, 1921b, 224-225). This style of work, \"considering the similarity\" of two objects or things, was going to be an heuristic guide in Einstein's later work. Reiser recapitulated Moszkowski and Maja's above descriptions, noting that Uncle Jakob had also told Albert of the Pythagorean Theorem. \"Soon the small textbook was his favourite reading […] When he secured Spieker's geometry, he at once succeeded in solving all the exercises, including the most difficult, with the exception of two or three\". Reiser explained that Einstein had worked through Spieker's geometry book, but only after he had read \"the first small geometry book\" (Reiser 1930, 3536). Einstein wrote in his Autobiographical Notes that at the age of twelve he had experienced a wonder \"in a little book dealing with Euclidean plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a school year\" (Einstein 1949, 10). This first small geometry book, which he had considered a wonder, was probably the textbook that he had received from his Uncle Jakob, Adolf Sickenberger's Leitfaden der Elementaren Mathematik, Zweiter Teil, Planimetrie (Textbook of Elementary Mathematics, Part Two, Plane Surfaces), 1888. The book was published in three separate parts and Part Two fits the description Einstein later gave of \"Holy Geometry Book\" that he had received at the age of twelve at the beginning of the school year (CPAE 1, lxi, note. 49). Einstein recounted in his Autobiographical Notes (Einstein 1949, 13): \"At the age of twelve through sixteen I familiarized myself with the elements of mathematics, including the principles of differential and integral calculus. In doing so I had the good fortune of encountering books that were not too particular regarding logical rigor, but that permitted the principal ideas to stand out clearly. This occupation was, on the whole, truly fascinating.\"\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n33\n\n5.3 Einstein Is Free in Italy The Einstein's firm in Munich was liquidated and transferred to Italy. Einstein's father had suffered one mishap after another in his business undertakings. The electrical engineering plant failed to prosper and he found it impossible to make a living. When Italy showed a great promise for the future the Italian representative of the firm proposed moving the plant there. Albert's ambitious uncle, Jakob Einstein, was at once taken with the idea and he persuaded Albert's father to make the change, sweeping him along in his enthusiasm. In the summer of 1894, the plant was therefore transferred to Pavia. Albert's parents, his sister and Uncle Jakob all moved, first to Milan in 1894 and a year later to Pavia (WintelerEinstein 1924b, 1ii-1iii, 1924c, xvi-xvii; Reiser 1930, 38). Maja recalls with much agony how the firm in Munich was liquidated. The lovely estate with the villa in which she and her brother had spent an happy childhood was sold to a building constructor, who immediately turned the handsome grounds into a construction site, cutting down the magnificent old trees and erecting an entire row of ugly apartment houses (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1iii, 1924c, xvii). Albert remained alone in Munich to complete his schooling. When the family moved to Italy in 1894 they had decided to leave young Albert in Munich to ensure that he would graduate from school and finish the last three years of the Gymnasium. He boarded with a family in Munich and relatives took care of him (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xiii, 1924c, xxi; Reiser 1930, 40). When Einstein had been very small, young cousins had come to visit the family from Genoa and told him of Italy and its people, of harbours, ships and sailors. Using old factory chests, they had played at going to sea. Albert was now fifteen and alone, and Italy seemed a paradise to him. Now his parents lived there and their letters painted a picture for him of this land of sunshine, colour, and free, ordinary people (Reiser 1930, 28, 40). Einstein clearly felt miserable at having to occupy himself at school with things in which he was not interested, and which he was supposed to learn solely because he had to take an examination in them. This feeling of dissatisfaction increased when his parents departed and left him alone in a boarding-house. He described the situation in a letter written in 1940. When he was in the seventh grade at the Luitpold Gymnasium, and thus\n\n34\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\nabout fifteen, he was summoned by his home-room teacher who expressed a wish that he leave the school. That home-room teacher was the same Joseph Degenhart who had prophesied that Einstein would never amount to anything (Frank 1949, 30, 1947, 16; CPAE 1, lxiii, notes 56, 58). To Einstein's remark that he had done nothing amiss Degenhart replied only that \"your mere presence spoils the respect of the class for me\". Einstein indeed wanted to leave the school and follow his parents to Italy, although the main reason for this was the dull, mechanized method of teaching. Because of his poor memory for words this presented him with great difficulties that it seemed pointless for him to try to overcome. He preferred, therefore, to endure all sorts of punishments from Degenhart rather than learn to gobble by rote. The rebellious and miserable Einstein, whose behaviour was intolerable in school and who was willing to study only those topics he liked, wanted to leave. His teacher, who demanded total obedience, could not stand his presence in class. His situation at school was thus absolutely miserable and he naturally longed for home and his parents. He felt that the style of teaching at the school was repugnant and militaristic, worshipping authority, and he could not stand the systematic training that was supposed to accustom pupils at an early age to a military discipline. He could not even think about the moment he would have to wear a soldier's uniform and fulfill his military duty. According to the then German citizenship laws, a male citizen must have emigrated by the age of sixteen; otherwise, if he failed to report for military service, he would be declared a deserter. Albert thus decided to leave Germany as quickly as possible (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 25; Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xiii, 1xiv, 1924c, xxi-xxii). He was depressed and nervous, seeking a way out of school. Hence, when Degenhart annoyed him yet again, he decided he would leave. He obtained a certificate from the family doctor, presented it to the school principal, left the school on December 29 1895 and set off by train, crossing the Alps straight into Italy, Milan, to his parents (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xiii, note 58, 1924c, xxi). Upon arriving at his parents' home in Milan, Albert announced that he would not return to Munich. The young rebel told his (here I should add, perhaps, shocked) father that he wanted to renounce his German citizenship. Albert's father, however, had kept his own citizenship so the situation was rather unusual. In January 1896 Albert nonetheless gave up his German citizenship and was no longer subject to military service in the German army. As he could not immediately acquire any other citizenship\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n35\n\nhe therefore remained stateless until much later becoming a Swiss citizen. Simultaneously, he renounced his legal affiliation to the Jewish religious community and thus become Konfessionslos (a person devoid of any religious affiliation) (Frank 1949, 34, 1947, 17). Albert nonetheless promised his stunned parents that he was going to prepare himself independently for the entrance examination to the Eidgenössische Polytechnische Schule (Swiss Federal Polytechnic School) in autumn (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xiv, 1924c, xxi). He used to call this school the Zürcher Polytechnikum (Zurich Polytechnic [School]), the \"Poly\" in Zurich. It was one of the best teaching and research institutes in all Europe. In Milan Einstein gained some practical experience while working in the family factory, and at the same time he resumed his scientific and mathematical studies to prepare for the exams. He purchased the three volumes of the advanced large textbook by Jules Violle, Lehrbuch der Physik (Physics Textbook), and worked through nearly all of them (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xiv, 1924c, xxii; Violle 1892-1893).9 Maja considered her brother's work habits rather odd: \"Even in a large, quite noisy group, he could withdraw to the sofa, take pen and paper, in hand, set the inkstand precariously on the armrest, and lose himself so completely in a problem that the conversation of many voices stimulated rather than disturbed him; an indication of remarkable power of concentration\" (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xiv, 1924c, xxii). At the age of sixteen Albert had already taught himself calculus and acquired an extraordinary scientific and technical insight. As evidence of the latter, Banesh Hoffmann and Helen Dukas offer this excerpt from a letter (March 12, 1929) greeting Einstein on his birthday. It came from Otto Neustätter, his hiking companion during the year that Einstein had spent with his parents in Milan before leaving for Aarau. The excerpt tells of an incident when Albert was fifteen. His Uncle Jakob had told Neustätter that he had encountered great difficulty with the calculations for the construction of a particular machine. Some days later Jakob told one of his apprentices: \"You know, it is really fabulous with my nephew. After I and my assistant-engineer had been racking our brains for days, that young sprig had got the whole thing in scarcely fifteen minutes. You will hear of him yet\" (Hoffmann and Dukas 1973, 27-28).\n\n36\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\nAt around the same time Einstein sent to his uncle Cäser Koch his first essay on physics, \"Über die Untersuchung des Aetherzustandes im magnetischen Feld\" (On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field). (CPAE 1, Doc 5).\n\n6 Secondary School in Aarau At the beginning of October 1895, at the age of sixteen and a half, Einstein went to the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich to sit the entrance examination (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, lxv; Reiser 1930, 44). He lacked Maturitätszeugnis (a certificate from the Munich Gymnasium) and was two years below the regular admission age of eighteen. With the aid of Gustav Maier, a family friend, he received permission from the Polytechnic director, Albin Herzog, to take the entrance examination required of applicants without a certificate. He was seeking to enroll in the engineering section of the Polytechnic. The examination began on October 8, 1895 and extended over several days. The results were announced on October 14, 1895. Einstein had failed to gain admission. He had done so well with his autodidactic preparations that he passed the entrance examination with the best results in maths and the sciences but, unsurprisingly, failed in languages and history (Albin Herzog to Gustav Maier, September 25, 1895, CPAE 1, Doc. 7, \"ETH Entrance Examination and Aargau Kantonsschule\", 10-11). Einstein's parents were advised to have their son attend the final year of a Swiss secondary school with the prospect of certain admission to the Polytechnic the following year, despite the fact that Albert would still be six months below the official age of admission (Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xv, 1924c, xxii). Einstein begins his Autobiographische Skizze (Autobiographical Sketch) of 1955 by recounting the examinations he had taken in October 1895. He then says that the physicist Heinrich Friedrich Weber invited him to attend his college physics lectures, provided that he remains in Zurich. However, continues Einstein, he enrolled according to the advice of the Rector, Prof. Albin Herzog, in the Kantonsschule (Cantonal School) in Aarau, a small Swiss town near Zurich whose schools had an high reputation and as a result were often attended by overseas students. From the end of October 1895 to the early autumn of 1896 Einstein was thus a pupil in the third and fourth classes in the technical stream of the Aargau Cantonal School. It was originally founded as a private school in 1802 and later taken over in\n\nEinstein’s Pathway to the Special Theory of Relativity\n\n37\n\n1813 by the \"state\" – the Kanton (Canton) Aargau (Einstein 1955, 9; Winteler-Einstein 1924b, 1xv, 1924c, xxii; correction to Seelig's biography, EA 39-084). During his year in Aarau Einstein boarded with a teacher from the Aargau Cantonal School, Prof. Jost Winteler. Winteler taught German and history in the liberal arts division of the school. He was a liberal-minded man to whom Einstein would later be related; for some years later the professor's son, Paul Winteler, married Albert's only sister, Maja (Reiser 1930, 47). Einstein's former Cantonal School classmate, Hans Byland, one year older than Einstein, had painted a verbal portrait of Einstein as a teenage: Einstein as a young man could not be fitted into any pattern; an impudent Swabian, sure of himself, his grey felt hat pushed back on his thick, black hair; a restless spirit that carried a whole world in itself. Nothing escaped the sharp gaze of his large bright brown eyes. \"A sarcastic curl of his rather full mouth with the protruding lower lip did not encourage Philistines to fraternize with him\". His friend added that his attitude towards the world was that of a laughing philosopher and his witty mockery pitilessly lashed out at any conceit or pose. Einstein made no bones about voicing his personal opinions, whether they were offensive or not, and his courageous adherence to the truth gave his personality a certain cachet which, in the long run, was bound to impress even his opponents (Seelig 1954, 15-17, 1956a, 13-14). By 1952 the aging Byland had probably forgotten that when he had studied with the young impudent rebel Einstein (who was not yet famous), and the latter had voiced his personal opinions (whether offensive or not), his opponents had probably not been impressed at all… As noted earlier, when Einstein was nine years old, because of his conscientiousness in not making false statements or telling lies, he was called Biedermeier (Honest John) by his classmates. He told only the truth and, later, the rebel Einstein still thought the most important and useful thing was to tell the truth; and thus he always voiced his personal opinions, whether welcome or not. The Aargau Cantonal School was a Realschule, not a Gymnasium. Einstein thus could study the topics he really loved. It was also a democratic school. The combination of these two traits suited Einstein's spirit. The system of teaching was liberal, unburdened by too much authority, and resembled university lectures in approach more than that of\n\n38\n\nA. From Einstein's Childhood to Patent Office\n\nan high-school institution. The classes were not confined each to their own room but there was a room for each subject, so that the students moved about for the different subjects as at a university, divided according to subject at definite hours as in college. Furthermore, the teachers were enlightened, modern individuals. In this school Albert immediately felt at home and made friends with his schoolmates (Seelig 1954, 14, 1956a, 12; Reiser 1930, 46). In the 1955 Sketch Einstein recalled that the \"liberal spirit\" of the Aargau Cantonal School had created an \"unforgettable impression\" on him. \"By comparison with the six years training at the Deutsche, authoritative Gymnasium, I have become aware\", noted Einstein, that \"real democracy is not an empty delusion\". In the democratic and free-thinking environment of the Aargau Cantonal School, Einstein imagined a \"childish thought experiment that has to do with the special theory of relativity\" (Einstein 1955, 9-10).10 This was the chasing after light beam thought experiment (discussed in chapter C, section 3). Einstein graduated from the Aarau secondary school and on November 7, 1896 he sent his curriculum vitae to the Aargau authorities (Dukas and Hoffmann 1979, 8-9, 121): \"[…] I have attended the Cantonal school in Aarau, and I now take the liberty of presenting myself for the graduation examination. I then plan to study mathematics and physics in division 6 of the Federal Polytechnic Institute\". In his matriculation examination essay in French, entitled \"My Future Plans\", written at the age of seventeen (September 18, 1896), Einstein also expressed his inclination and desire to study mathematics and abstract subjects (CPAE 1, Doc. 22). It was very clear to Einstein at that time that he would not be able to pursue his original aims, which had corresponded "
