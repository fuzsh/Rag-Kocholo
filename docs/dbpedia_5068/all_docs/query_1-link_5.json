        "text": "Pledge the Pink Foundation is a nonprofit public charity dedicated to funding breast cancer screening, treatment, outreach and research.\n\nWe provide funding for free mammograms, medical assistance, and outreach services to the people who need it most and too often are lost in a system of endless paperwork.\n\nQuite simply, we fill the gap and eliminate the red tape and bureaucracy.\n\nYour donation makes early detection possible for individuals across the country.\n\nEarly detection pushes the breast cancer 5-year survival rate to nearly 100%. Mammograms are the best way to catch breast cancer early.\n\nThe funding you provide will help cover the cost of a mammogram for someone who otherwise might go without due to an inability to pay.\n\nWith your support, we make it easier for our our service provider partners to fill the gaps in available life-saving care for those who are frequently overlooked.\n\nAll donations are tax deductible to fullest extent of the law."
