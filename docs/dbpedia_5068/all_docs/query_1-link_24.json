        "text": "Amazon\n\nThrough a new collaboration, the American Childhood Cancer Organization and Amazon are celebrating children diagnosed with cancer who demonstrate an interest in STEM. During September, Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, ACCO and Amazon will deliver smiles to 30 children in 30 days, one for every day of the month, through exciting STEM-related immersion experiences across the country. On behalf of each child, Amazon will also make donations to pediatric oncology programs across America committed to saving their lives.\n\nJelSert\n\nSince 2008, ACCO’s partner Jel Sert has played a vital role bringing happiness to children with cancer, while simultaneously promoting our Gold Ribbon Awareness Program. Knowing the relief and joy an icy treat can bring, especially for children in treatment, Jel Sert generously provides pediatric cancer hospitals with a continuous supply of Fla-Vor-Ice freezer pops in a freezer decorated with the Gold Ribbon.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe American Childhood Cancer Organization (ACCO) would like to thank our partner – Microsoft Corporation – for hosting an incredible PJammin® for Kids with Cancer fundraising event!\n\nYouCaring\n\nYouCaring’s Compassionate Crowdfunding™ program helps families facing financial hardship due to childhood cancer to develop and coordinate a personalized online fundraising campaign. YouCaring’s revolutionary crowdfunding techniques are designed to walk you through the fundraising process, with no additional fees, so you can ease your financial burden and focus on what really matters: helping your child beat this terrible disease!\n\nLa Roche-Posay\n\nIn an effort to raise awareness and help families of children undergoing cancer treatments, La Roche-Posay is proud to partner with the American Childhood Cancer Organization. To help facilitate communication between children undergoing treatment and their loved ones, La Roche-Posay will donate kits with emotive tools designed to help kids express their feelings. In addition, La Roche-Posay will also host a “donations” button on their website for customers to donate directly to ACCO.\n\nPalmCo\n\nPALMCo makes it easy: for every customer that registers with PALMCo and its sister company, Columbia Utilities, PALMco pledges a $1.00 donation every month to support the ACCO’s critical mission to offer resources, information, and support to children and families impacted by cancer. Once you have registered, all you need to do is pay your utility bill every month and you are joining the fight against childhood cancer.\n\nGoorin Bros\n\nGoorin Bros. Hats Company has generously donated a selection of high-quality hats for children and teens fighting childhood cancer. If you would like a hat to brighten the spirits of your warrior, use the discount code 'FREE HAT' when you visit the ACCO store.\n\nThe Loft Entertainment Company\n\nThe Loft Entertainment is a celebrity marketing and brand acceleration company that is the \"go to\" company matchmaking celebrities and Influencers to brands specializing in the areas of celebrity marketing, brand acceleration, content creation, and so much more. In September 2018, The Loft + ACCO will challenge their key Influencers in an online campaign to donate #OneGoodDollar to raise awareness and program funding for ACCO.\n\nMatilda Jane\n\nDenise Demarchis, founder of the Matilda Jane Clothing (MJC) line said, \"It's all about keeping a little girl... a little girl. Keeping her youthful. Keeping her spinning and twirling and carefree. And most importantly, bringing her happiness.\" Denise passed away from cancer, but true to her legacy, MJC is now bringing happiness to little girls fighting cancer too. In September 2018, we are proud to unveil a GO GOLD Matilda Jane Platinum dress celebrating the bravery of little girls battling cancer and their desire to still express their girly-ness, even after losing their hair. Designed by two cancer moms, the Bennett dress features gold fabric and gold glitter ribbon - showcasing the gold ribbon as the international symbol of childhood cancer - as well as additional ruffles and pink lace for an extra helping of girly sweetness. Proceeds from purchase of the dress will benefit ACCO.

Servier Pharmaceutical’s drug pipeline includes Oncaspar® (pegaspargase) – a chemotherapy drug that is essential to the successful treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ACCO appreciates the support from Servier to aid in the expansion of our Why Not Kids and Founding Hope Programs and provide resources to execute essential programs and services that address the critical needs of children being treated for cancer.\n\nErimish\n\nErimish and the American Childhood Cancer Organization began a partnership in September 2020 with a variety of custom bracelets inspired by the bravest childhood cancer warriors. With custom stacks and singles in adult and youth sizes, there is an option for everyone! Whether you choose to Go Gold® or rock the colorful option, you’ll be able to keep your favorite warrior close to you with each of these beautiful designs!
