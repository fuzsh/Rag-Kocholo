Lynn Cancer Institute is one of the largest cancer centers in South Florida and is accredited as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the American College of Surgeons. The Lynn Cancer Institute treats an estimated 4,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients each year in facilities such as the Harvey & Phyllis Sandler Pavilion, our state-of-the-art cancer center; as well as our other respective satellite locations in Delray Beach.\n\nOur patients receive treatment and services from specialists in genetics, surgery, radiation oncology, hematology oncology, medical oncology, pathology and imaging. A unique approach at the Lynn Cancer Institute is our multimodality care. Each multimodality team is comprised of physicians and healthcare professionals who specialize in a specific site of cancer. The team is able to develop standards of care for the specific disease site it treats. These standards reflect the most advanced technology and current treatments available. This simplifies the entire process for our patients, from diagnosis and treatment, to wellness and survivorship programs and allows our patients to focus on one thing — recovery. For additional information, call 561.955.LYNN (5966)\n\nThe Eugene M. & Christine E. Lynn Cancer Institute is supported by many funds, including:\n\nCancer Research\n\nIt is the commitment and goal at the Office of Clinical Research to provide our cancer patients with the most sophisticated care possible, all in a compassionate and respectful environment.

Individuals and businesses host a variety of fundraising events -- from spin-a-thons to softball games and shopping parties.\n\nLeague of Ribbons/Run for the Ribbons\n\nThe League of Ribbons funds many different programs including, but not limited to, providing gifts cards for groceries and gas, health and wellness programs for patients and the community-at-large and guided imagery, yoga and massage therapy for cancer patients in treatment.
