Inflammation plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. There were no reports which investigated the relationship between Sarculator and inflammation. Methods: A total of 217 patients with extremity STS were included. The Sarculator-predicted 10-year probability of OS (pr-OS) was stratified into two subgroups: lower risk (10-year pr-OS ≥ 60%) and higher risk (10-year pr-OS < 60%). The modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) varied from 0 to 2. Results: Out of the 217 patients, 67 were classified as higher risk, while 150 were lower risk. A total of 181 patients had an mGPS of 0, and 36 had a score of 1 or 2. The 5-year OS was 83.3%. When patients were divided into two groups according to the 10-year pr-OS, those with a higher risk had poorer OS than those with a lower risk. Among the patients with a higher risk, those with an mGPS of 1 or 2 had poorer OS compared to those with a score of 0. Conclusions: The mGPS could potentially play an important role in identifying patients who are at high risk of death and metastasis in the higher-risk group on the Sarculator.

Molecular subtyping of BC is crucial for predictive and prognostic purposes due to the diverse clinical behaviors observed across various types. The molecular heterogeneity of BC poses uncertainties in its impact on diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Numerous studies have highlighted genetic and environmental differences between patients from different geographic regions, emphasizing the need for localized research. International studies have revealed that patients with African heritage are often diagnosed at a more advanced stage and exhibit poorer responses to treatment and lower survival rates. Despite these global findings, there is a dearth of in-depth studies focusing on communities in the African region. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are paramount to improving survival rates. In this context, radiogenomics emerges as a promising field within precision medicine. By associating genetic patterns with image attributes or features, radiogenomics has the potential to significantly improve early detection, prognosis, and diagnosis. It can provide valuable insights into potential treatment options and predict the likelihood of survival, progression, and relapse. Radiogenomics allows for visual features and genetic marker linkage that promises to eliminate the need for biopsy and sequencing. The application of radiogenomics not only contributes to advancing precision oncology and individualized patient treatment but also streamlines clinical workflows. This review aims to delve into the theoretical underpinnings of radiogenomics and explore its practical applications in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of BC and to put radiogenomics on a path towards fully integrated diagnostics.

This study aims to introduce longitudinal muscle biopsies as a potential framework for disease monitoring and treatment. The initial feasibility and safety assessment was performed for healthy mice and rats that received two consecutive muscle biopsies. The assessment was performed by utilizing three different tools. Subsequently, the protocol was also applied in leiomyosarcoma tumor-bearing rats. Longitudinal muscle biopsies proved to be a safe and feasible technique, especially in rat models. The application of this protocol to tumor-bearing rats further affirmed its tolerability and feasibility, while microscopic evaluation of the biopsies demonstrated varying levels of muscle atrophy with or without leukocyte infiltration. In this tumor model, sequential muscle biopsies confirmed the variability of the cancer cachexia evolution among subjects and at different time-points. Despite the abundance of promising cancer cachexia data during the past decade, the full potential of muscle biopsies is not being leveraged. Sequential muscle biopsies throughout the disease course represent a feasible and safe tool that can be utilized to guide precision treatment and monitor the response in cancer cachexia research.

A randomized, prospective, multi-institutional clinical trial (COMS) showed no difference in survival between brachytherapy and enucleation for medium-sized lesions. With the obvious benefit of retaining the eye, brachytherapy has flourished and many different approaches have been developed such as low-dose-rate sources using alternate low-energy photon-emitting radionuclides, different plaque designs and seed-loading techniques, high-dose-rate brachytherapy sources and applicators, and low- and high-dose-rate beta-emitting sources and applicators. There also have been developments of other radiation modalities like external-beam radiotherapy using linear accelerators with high-energy photons, particle accelerators for protons, and gamma stereotactic radiosurgery. This article examines the dosimetric properties, targeting capabilities, and outcomes of these approaches. The several modalities examined herein have differing attributes and it may be that no single approach would be considered optimal for all patients and all lesion characteristics.

The presence of extra-hepatic metastases limits curative (surgical) treatment options and is associated with very poor survival. The mechanisms governing multi-organ metastasis formation are incompletely understood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the site of tumor growth influences extra-hepatic metastasis formation. To this end, we implanted murine colon cancer organoids into the primary tumor site (i.e., the caecum) and into the primary metastasis site (i.e., the liver) in immunocompetent mice. The organoid-initiated liver tumors were significantly more efficient in seeding distant metastases compared to tumors of the same origin growing in the caecum (intra-hepatic: 51 vs. 40%, p = 0.001; peritoneal cavity: 51% vs. 33%, p = 0.001; lungs: 30% vs. 7%, p = 0.017). The enhanced metastatic capacity of the liver tumors was associated with the formation of ‘hotspots’ of vitronectin-positive blood vessels surrounded by macrophages. RNA sequencing analysis of clinical samples showed a high expression of vitronectin in liver metastases, along with signatures reflecting hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation, and macrophages. We conclude that ‘onward spread’ from liver metastases is facilitated by liver-specific microenvironmental signals that cause the formation of macrophage-associated vascular hotspots. The therapeutic targeting of these signals may help to contain the disease within the liver and prevent onward spread.

However, many genes exhibit recurrent mutational positions known as hotspots, specifically linked to varying degrees of survival outcomes. Nevertheless, few hotspots have been analyzed (e.g., TP53 and EGFR). Thus, many other genes and hotspots remain unexplored. Methods: We systematically screened over 1400 hotspots across 33 TCGA cancer types. We compared the patients carrying a hotspot against (i) all cases, (ii) gene-mutated cases, (iii) other mutated hotspots, or (iv) specific hotspots. Due to the limited number of samples in hotspots and the inherent group imbalance, besides Cox models and the log-rank test, we employed VALORATE to estimate their association with survival precisely. Results: We screened 1469 hotspots in 6451 comparisons, where 314 were associated with survival. Many are discussed and linked to the current literature. Our findings demonstrate associations between known hotspots and survival while also revealing more potential hotspots. To enhance accessibility and promote further investigation, all the Kaplan–Meier curves, the log-rank tests, Cox statistics, and VALORATE-estimated null distributions are accessible on our website. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed both known and putatively novel hotspots associated with survival, which can be used as biomarkers. Our web resource is a valuable tool for cancer research.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with stage IVB cervical cancer during 2013–2019 in the National Cancer Database and treated with chemotherapy (CT) ± external beam radiation (EBRT) ± intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) ± IMT were studied. The adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for risk of death were estimated in patients treated with vs. without IMT after applying propensity score analysis to balance the clinical covariates. Results: There were 3164 evaluable patients, including 969 (31%) who were treated with IMT. The use of IMT increased from 11% in 2013 to 46% in 2019. Age, insurance, facility type, sites of distant metastasis, and type of first-line treatment were independently associated with using IMT. In propensity-score-balanced patients, the median survival was 18.6 vs. 13.1 months for with vs. without IMT (p < 0.001). The AHR was 0.72 (95% CI = 0.64–0.80) for adding IMT overall, 0.72 for IMT + CT, 0.66 for IMT + CT + EBRT, and 0.69 for IMT + CT + EBRT + ICBT. IMT-associated survival improvements were suggested in all subgroups by age, race/ethnicity, comorbidity score, facility type, tumor grade, tumor size, and site of metastasis. Conclusions: IMT was associated with a consistent survival benefit in real-world patients with stage IVB cervical cancer.

Conventional ALPPS is associated with high morbidity and mortality. MILS reduces morbidity and the robot adds technical features that make complex procedures safe. Material and Methods: The MD-MILS was screened for patients who underwent rALPPS. Demographic and perioperative data were evaluated retrospectively. Ninety days postoperative morbidity was scored according to the CD classification. The findings were compared with the literature. Results: Since November 2021, five patients have been identified. The mean age and BMI of the patients were 50.0 years and 22.7 kg/m2. In four cases, patients suffered from colorectal liver metastases and, in one case, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Prior to the first operation, the mean liver volume of the residual left liver was 380.9 mL with a FLR-BWR of 0.677%. Prior to the second operation, the mean volume of the residual liver was 529.8 mL with a FLR-BWR of 0.947%. This was an increase of 41.9% of the residual liver volume. The first and second operations were carried out within 17.8 days. The mean time of the first and second operations was 341.2 min and 440.6 min. The mean hospital stay was 27.2 days. Histopathology showed the largest tumor size of 39 mm in diameter with a mean amount of 4.7 tumors. The mean tumor-free margin was 12.3 mm. One complication CD > 3a occurred. No patient died during the 90-day follow up. Conclusion: In the first German series, we demonstrated that rALPPS can be carried out safely with reduced morbidity and mortality in selected patients.

Biomarkers are becoming increasingly important in addressing clinical issues, including in monitoring tumour progression and assessing survival and treatment response. The goal of this study was to identify prognostic biomarkers associated with glioma progression. Discovery proteomic analysis was performed on a small cohort of astrocytomas that were diagnosed as low-grade and recurred at a higher grade. Six proteins were chosen to be validated further in a larger cohort. Three proteins, CA9, CYFIP2, and LGALS3BP, were found to be associated with glioma progression and, in univariate analysis, could be used as prognostic markers. However, according to the results of multivariate analysis, these did not remain significant. These three proteins were then combined into a three-protein panel. This panel had a specificity and sensitivity of 0.7459 for distinguishing between long and short survival. In silico data confirmed the prognostic significance of this panel.

The high incidence and mortality rate of BrC prompts researchers to search for new markers that will provide information on the possible impact of the therapy on the risk of cancer-related events. This study aimed to investigate whether the level of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) may have a potential impact on disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in BrC patients with early-stage cancer. Additionally, we tried to assess the relationship between AOPPs and angiogenic parameters. In this study, the pre- and post-treatment AOPP levels were examined in the serum of 70 newly diagnosed BrC women. The receiver operating characteristic curve identified pre- and post-treatment AOPPs to be above 9.37 μM and 10.39 μM, respectively, as the best cut-off values to predict the risk of cancer relapse. Additionally, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that pre- and post-treatment AOPPs above 9.37 μM and 10.39 μM were associated with significantly poorer OS. The uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis highlighted that lower levels of pre- and post-treatment AOPPs were associated with a longer duration without relapse or cancer-related death. A positive correlation between concentrations of pre-treatment AOPPs and vascular endothelial growth factor A, and negative correlations with levels of soluble forms of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 1 and 2, were found. In conclusion, AOPPs appear to have an important role in predicting cancer-related events and may potentially serve as a simple prognostic marker in clinical practice.

EP considerably boosts the absorptivity of targeted cells to anticancer molecules of different natures, thus upgrading their effectiveness. Its use in veterinary oncology has been widely explored, and some applications, such as electrochemotherapy (ECT), are currently approved as first-line treatments for several neoplastic conditions. Other applications include irreversible electroporation and EP-based cancer vaccines. In human oncology, EP is still mostly restricted to therapies for cutaneous tumors and the palliation of cutaneous and visceral metastases of malignant tumors. Fields where veterinary experience could help smooth the clinical transition to humans include intraoperative EP, interventional medicine and cancer vaccines. This article recapitulates the state of the art of EP in veterinary and human oncology, recounting the most relevant results to date.

Therefore, we have an urgent need in advanced-PSCC treatment to find novel therapies. Approximately half of all PSCC cases are positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). Our objective was to generate HPV-positive (HPV+) and HPV-negative (HPV−) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to determine the biological differences between HPV+ and HPV− disease. We generated four HPV+ and three HPV− PSCC PDX animal models by directly implanting resected patient tumor tissue into immunocompromised mice. PDX tumor tissue was found to be similar to patient tumor tissue (donor tissue) by histology and short tandem repeat fingerprinting. DNA mutations were mostly preserved in PDX tissues and similar APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide) mutational fractions in donor tissue and PDX tissues were noted. A higher APOBEC mutational fraction was found in HPV+ versus HPV− PDX tissues (p = 0.044), and significant transcriptomic and proteomic expression differences based on HPV status included p16 (CDKN2A), RRM2, and CDC25C. These models will allow for the direct testing of targeted therapies in PSCC and determine their response in correlation to HPV status.

However, metastatic carcinoma of the peritoneum is difficult to diagnose based on biopsy findings, and ascitic aspiration cytology has a low sensitivity and specificity and a high inter-observer variability. The aim of the present study was to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to classify benign and malignant cells in ascites cytology patch images of metastatic CRC using a deep convolutional neural network. Datasets were collected from The OPEN AI Dataset Project, a nationwide cytology dataset for AI research. The numbers of patch images used for training, validation, and testing were 56,560, 7068, and 6534, respectively. We evaluated 1041 patch images of benign and metastatic CRC in the ascitic fluid to compare the performance of pathologists and an AI algorithm, and to examine whether the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists improved with the assistance of AI. This AI method showed an accuracy, a sensitivity, and a specificity of 93.74%, 87.76%, and 99.75%, respectively, for the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign ascites. The diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity of the pathologist with the assistance of the proposed AI method increased from 86.8% to 90.5% and from 73.3% to 79.3%, respectively. The proposed deep learning method may assist pathologists with different levels of experience in diagnosing metastatic CRC cells of ascites.

However, it is not only blood vessels that are responsible for tumor cell spread. During the process of tumor growth, lymphangiogenesis is mediated by other members of the VEGF family, specifically VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which act independent to bevacizumab. Therefore, based on the mechanism of bevacizumab action and the processes of angio- and lymphangiogenesis, we formed three hypotheses: (1) if the lymph nodes in primary ovarian cancers are metastatic, the outcome of bevacizumab treatment is worsened; (2) concerning the second-line treatment, bevacizumab will act in a weakened manner if recurrence occurs in lymph nodes as opposed to a local recurrence; (3) patients treated by bevacizumab are more likely to have recurrences in lymph nodes. These hypotheses raise the issue of the existing knowledge gap, which concerns the effect of bevacizumab on metastatic lymph nodes.

Tumors with high ITH cause therapeutic resistance and have human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) heterogeneity in response to HER2-targeted therapies. This study aimed to investigate whether high HER2 heterogeneity levels were clinically related to a poor prognosis for HER2-targeted adjuvant therapy resistance in primary breast cancers. Methods: This study included patients with primary breast cancer (n = 251) treated with adjuvant HER2-targeted therapies. HER2 heterogeneity was manifested by the shape of HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization amplification (FISH) distributed histograms with the HER2 gene copy number within a tumor sample. Each tumor was classified into a biphasic grade graph (high heterogeneity [HH]) group or a monophasic grade graph (low heterogeneity [LH]) group based on heterogeneity. Both groups were evaluated for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for a median of ten years of annual follow-up. Results: Of 251 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, 46 (18.3%) and 205 (81.7%) were classified into the HH and LH groups, respectively. The HH group had more distant metastases and a poorer prognosis than the LH group (DFS: p < 0.001 (HH:63% vs. LH:91% at 10 years) and for the OS: p = 0.012 (HH:78% vs. LH:95% at 10 years). Conclusions: High HER2 heterogeneity is a poor prognostic factor in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. A novel approach to heterogeneity, which is manifested by the shape of HER2 FISH distributions, might be clinically useful in the prognosis prediction of patients after HER2 adjuvant therapy.

A prospective cohort study was conducted in cancer patients who received anthracycline-based chemotherapy between 2018 and 2020 and who had baseline abdominal CT including L3 level for measuring SMM. Regional muscle measurements were carried out using US. A total of 65 patients (14 males, 51 females) were included. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis identified threshold values of 18.0 mm [AUC (area under the curve) = 0.765] for females and 20.0 mm (AUC = 0.813) for males, predicting severe neutropenia. Using these cut-offs, females with low rectus femoris (RF) thickness (<18.0 mm) had a significantly higher incidence of grade ≥3 neutropenia (50.0% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.005), and males with low RF values (<20.0 mm) had a higher incidence (80.0% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.063). A regression analysis, irrespective of age, gender, and body mass index, revealed that only low RF muscle thickness increased the risk of grade 3–4 neutropenia by 9.210 times (95% CI = 2.401–35.326, p = 0.001). Utilizing US to measure RF muscle thickness aids in identifying cancer patients at an elevated risk of developing neutropenia. Needless to say, US can serve as a convenient and easily accessible tool for assessing low SMM, providing repeat point-of-care evaluations in clinical practice.

NB exhibits cellular heterogeneity, with adrenergic and mesenchymal states displaying distinct tumorigenic potentials. NB is highly vascularized, and blood vessels can form through various mechanisms, including endothelial transdifferentiation, leading to the development of tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) associated with chemoresistance. We lack specific biomarkers for TECs. Therefore, identifying new TEC biomarkers is vital for effective NB therapies. A stiffness-based platform simulating human arterial and venous stiffness was developed to study NB TECs in vitro. Adrenergic cells cultured on arterial-like stiffness transdifferentiated into TECs, while mesenchymal state cells did not. The TECs derived from adrenergic cells served as a model to explore new biomarkers, with a particular focus on GB3, a glycosphingolipid receptor implicated in angiogenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. Notably, the TECs unequivocally expressed GB3, validating its novelty as a marker. To explore targeted therapeutic interventions, nanoparticles functionalized with the non-toxic subunit B of the Shiga toxin were generated, because they demonstrated a robust affinity for GB3-positive cells. Our results demonstrate the value of the stiffness-based platform as a predictive tool for assessing NB aggressiveness, the discovery of new biomarkers, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of targeted therapeutic strategies.

However, a universal clinical consensus or reliable prognostic evaluation system for this malignancy is lacking. Our study aimed to develop a risk model based on comprehensive clinical data to assist in clinical decision-making. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study by examining data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) repository, spanning 2000 to 2019. The external validation cohort was sourced from the Children’s Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, China. To discern independent factors affecting overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), we applied Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Random Forest (RF) regression analyses. Based on these factors, we structured nomogram survival predictions and initiated a dynamic online risk-evaluation system. To contrast survival outcomes among diverse treatments, we used propensity score matching (PSM) methodology. Molecular data with the most common mutations in AT/RT were extracted from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Results: The annual incidence of AT/RT showed an increasing trend (APC, 2.86%; 95% CI:0.75–5.01). Our prognostic study included 316 SEER database participants and 27 external validation patients. The entire group had a median OS of 18 months (range 11.5 to 24 months) and median CSS of 21 months (range 11.7 to 29.2). Evaluations involving C-statistics, DCA, and ROC analysis underscored the distinctive capabilities of our prediction model. An analysis via PSM highlighted that individuals undergoing triple therapy (integrating surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) had discernibly enhanced OS and CSS. The most common mutations of AT/RT identified in the COSMIC database were SMARCB1, BRAF, SMARCA4, NF2, and NRAS. Conclusions: In this study, we devised a predictive model that effectively gauges the prognosis of AT/RT and briefly analyzed its genomic features, which might offer a valuable tool to address existing clinical challenges.

This article delves into the promising approach of combining immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, with radiation therapy, a cornerstone of HCC management. Our review synthesizes current preclinical and clinical research, highlighting the potential synergistic effects of this combinational treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that this synergy enhances tumor control and improves patient survival rates. The combination leverages the localized, tumor-targeting ability of radiation therapy and the systemic, immune-boosting effects of immunotherapy, potentially overcoming the limitations inherent in each treatment modality when used separately. This integrative approach is especially promising in addressing the complex tumor microenvironment of HCC. However, the treatment landscape is nuanced, with challenges such as patient-specific response variability and potential resistance to therapies. Future research directions should focus on refining these combination strategies, tailoring them to individual patient profiles, and understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the interaction between immunotherapy and radiation therapy. Such advancements could significantly improve HCC management, setting new standards for patient care and treatment efficacy.

This review delves into the intricate dynamics surrounding both glutamine antagonism strategies and glutamine supplementation within the context of cancer treatment, emphasizing the critical role of glutamine metabolism in cancer progression and therapy. Glutamine antagonism, aiming to disrupt tumor growth by targeting critical metabolic pathways, is challenged by the adaptive nature of cancer cells and the complex metabolic microenvironment, potentially compromising its therapeutic efficacy. In contrast, glutamine supplementation supports immune function, improves gut integrity, alleviates treatment-related toxicities, and improves patient well-being. Moreover, recent studies highlighted its contributions to epigenetic regulation within cancer cells and its potential to bolster anti-cancer immune functions. However, glutamine implementation necessitates careful consideration of potential interactions with ongoing treatment regimens and the delicate equilibrium between supporting normal cellular function and promoting tumorigenesis. By critically assessing the implications of both glutamine antagonism strategies and glutamine supplementation, this review aims to offer comprehensive insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting glutamine metabolism for effective cancer management.

HGF/c-MET signaling, which is instrumental in embryonic development and wound healing, is also implicated for its mitogenic and motogenic properties. In pancreatic cancer, this pathway, along with its downstream signaling pathways, is associated with disease progression, prognosis, metastasis, chemoresistance, and other tumor-related factors. Other features of the microenvironment in pancreatic cancer with the HGF/c-MET pathway include hypoxia, angiogenesis, metastasis, and the urokinase plasminogen activator positive feed-forward loop. All these attributes critically influence the initiation, progression, and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, targeting the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway appears promising for the development of innovative drugs for pancreatic cancer treatment. One of the primary downstream effects of c-MET activation is the MAPK/ERK (Ras, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) signaling cascade, and MEK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors have demonstrated therapeutic value in RAS-mutant melanoma and lung cancer. Trametinib is a selective MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor, and it has evolved as a pivotal therapeutic agent targeting the MAPK/ERK pathway in various malignancies, including BRAF-mutated melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer. The drug’s effectiveness increases when combined with agents like BRAF inhibitors. However, resistance remains a challenge, necessitating ongoing research to counteract the resistance mechanisms. This review offers an in-depth exploration of the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway, trametinib’s mechanism, clinical applications, combination strategies, and future directions in the context of pancreatic cancer.

However, these two agents have not been compared head-to-head. We therefore compared the safety and efficacy of both agents for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in immunocompromised cancer patients. Methods: We identified 240 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with Molnupiravir or Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir. Patients were matched using a 1:2 ratio based on age group (18–64 years vs. ≥65) and type of cancer. The collected data included demographics, comorbidities, and treatment outcome. Results: Both groups had comparable characteristics and presenting symptoms. However, dyspnea was more prevalent in the Molnupiravir group, while sore throat was more prevalent in the Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir group. The rate of disease progression was comparable in both groups by univariate and multivariable analysis. Treatment with Molnupiravir versus Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir revealed no significant difference in disease progression by multivariable analysis (adjusted OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.56–3.14, p = 0.70). Patients who received Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir, however, were significantly more prone to having drug–drug interactions/adverse events (30% vs. 0%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: In the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in cancer patients, Molnupiravir was comparable to Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir in preventing progression to severe disease/death and rebound events, and it had a superior safety profile.

We studied right colon vs. left colon vs. rectal PTL in a real-life study population (n = 1080). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed multi-cross-sectionally with QLQ-C30, QLQ-CR29, EQ-5D, and 15D. A chi-square, Kaplan–Meier, and Cox regression were used to compare the groups. The PTL was in the right colon in 310 patients (29%), the left colon in 396 patients (37%), and the rectum in 375 patients (35%). The PTL was associated with distinct differences in metastatic sites during the disease trajectory. The resectability, conversion, and resection rates were lowest in the right colon, followed by the rectum, and were highest in the left colon. Overall survival was shortest for right colon compared with left colon or rectal PTL (median 21 vs. 35 vs. 36 months), with the same trends after metastasectomy or systemic therapy only. PTL also remained statistically significant in a multivariable model. The distribution of symptoms varied according to PTL, especially between the right colon (with general symptoms of metastases) and rectal PTL (with sexual- and bowel-related symptoms). mCRC, according to PTL, behaves differently regarding metastatic sites, resectability of the metastases, outcomes of treatment, and HRQoL.

The SIMPLR study aims to compare open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches using propensity score matching analysis. Methods: This study included 258 patients with tumors of the left side of the pancreas who underwent surgery between 2016 and 2020 at three high-volume centers. The patients were divided into three groups based on their surgical approach and matched in a 1:1 ratio. Results: The open group had significantly higher estimated blood loss (620 mL vs. 320 mL, p < 0.001), longer operative time (273 vs. 216 min, p = 0.003), and longer hospital stays (16.9 vs. 6.81 days, p < 0.001) compared to the laparoscopic group. There was no difference in lymph node yield or resection status. When comparing open and robotic groups, the robotic procedures yielded a higher number of lymph nodes (24.9 vs. 15.2, p = 0.011) without being significantly longer. The laparoscopic group had a shorter operative time (210 vs. 340 min, p < 0.001), shorter ICU stays (0.63 vs. 1.64 days, p < 0.001), and shorter hospital stays (6.61 vs. 11.8 days, p < 0.001) when compared to the robotic group. There was no difference in morbidity or mortality between the three techniques. Conclusion: The laparoscopic approach exhibits short-term benefits. The three techniques are equivalent in terms of oncological safety, morbidity, and mortality.

These enzymes are expressed in many cancers, especially during tissue remodeling and subsequent tumor cell invasion. Opaganib (ABC294640), a novel, orally available small molecule is a selective inhibitor of the phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) by sphingosine kinase 2 (SPHK2). Both sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and SPHK2 are known to regulate the proliferation-inducing compound S-1-P. However, SPHK2 is more critical in cancer pathogenesis. The goal of this project was to investigate the potential antitumor effects of upamostat and opaganib, individually and in combination, on cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) xenografts in nude mice. PAX165, a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) from a surgically resected CCA, expresses substantial levels of SPHK2, PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3. Four groups of 18 mice each were treated with upamostat, opaganib, both, or vehicle. Mouse weights and PAX165 tumor volumes were measured. Tumor volumes in the upamostat, opaganib, and upamostat plus opaganib groups were significantly decreased compared to the control group.

We compared outcomes of QS ± concurrent ICIs in the palliative treatment of HNC. Materials and Methods: We identified patients who received ≥three cycles of QS from 2017 to 2022 and excluded patients without post-treatment clinical evaluation or imaging. Outcomes for patients who received QS alone were compared to those treated with ICI concurrent with QS, defined as receipt of ICI within 4 weeks of QS. Results: Seventy patients were included, of whom 57% received concurrent ICI. Median age was 65.5 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 57.9–77.8), and 50% patients had received prior radiation to a median dose of 66 Gy (IQR: 60–70). Median follow-up was 8.8 months. Local control was significantly higher with concurrent ICIs (12-month: 85% vs. 63%, p = 0.038). Distant control (12-month: 56% vs. 63%, p = 0.629) and median overall survival (9.0 vs. 10.0 months, p = 0.850) were similar between the two groups. On multivariable analysis, concurrent ICI was a significant predictor of local control (HR for local failure: 0.238; 95% CI: 0.073–0.778; p = 0.018). Overall, 23% patients experienced grade 3 toxicities, which was similar between the two groups. Conclusions: The combination of QS with concurrent ICIs was well tolerated and significantly improved local control compared to QS alone. The median OS of 9.4 months compares favorably to historical controls for patients with HNC treated with QS. This approach represents a promising treatment option for patients with HNC unsuited for curative-intent treatment and warrants prospective evaluation.
