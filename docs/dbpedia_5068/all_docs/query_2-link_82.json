There is lots of things out there for breast cancer patients but not a lot for families, so when I was diagnosed, my family was diagnosed and it's like that for anyone going through cancer.\"\n\nAnd that's why the organization gives retreats for the entire family of a breast cancer survivor.\n\nPatten-Coble says, \"We have a week that's amazing where we provide everything for the families, the houses, the meals, the services, but more importantly, we provide an opportunity for them to create a support network with each other.\"\n\nLittle Pink Houses of Hope hosts retreats like the one they had in Emerald Isle all over the country. So far they have given vacations to more than 150 families.\n\nYou can find out more information on the organization by clicking on the related link."
