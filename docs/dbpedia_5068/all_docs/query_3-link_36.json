Although we can’t list everyone, please let us know if you’ve found a particularly useful site.\n\nInherited Cancer Syndromes\n\nSee our Genes tab to learn more about inherited mutations and hereditary cancer syndromes.\n\nGeneral Information on Cancer:\n\nCancer Australia is the Australian Government's site on all aspects of cancer, for patients and doctors>\n\neviQ has detailed Australia-specific information on germline testing and cancer risk management for doctors. It also has plain-language information for patients. The site is managed by the Australian Government's Cancer Institute.\n\nDr Hilda High is one of the experts who write and update the eviQ Australian Guidelines for genetic testing and risk management.\n\nSupport groups\n\nThere are heaps! They range from common cancers such as breast cancer to rare tumours. Some to choose from:\n\nPink Hope was set up to support young women affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer\n\nLynch Syndrome Australia provides information for people who have increased risk of bowel (colon) and uterine cancers due to a mutation in one of the 4 mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome\n\nPheo Para Troopers is a support group for people affected by the uncommon tumours called paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas.\n\nRare Cancers Australia is a charity whose purpose is to improve awareness, support and treatment of Australians with rare and less common cancers.\n\nYou'll find more information about specific support groups for inherited cancer syndromes on our Genes tab\n\nGeneral Genetics?\n\nWe only deal with Hereditary Cancer Syndromes (Cancer Genetics). If you have a more general genetics question (for example relating to cystic fibrosis, fragile X or inborn errors of metabolism, you'll need a Clinical Geneticist. Clinical geneticists, and genetic counsellors working in this area, are usually found working in clinics associated with a public hospital or community centre.\n\nLike Sydney Cancer Genetics, many of these clinics offer Telehealth as well as face to face appointments. You'll find a state-based list of public clinics on the government's Centre for Genetics Education's Genetic Service Finder page and a similar list on the The Human Genetics Society of Australasia's Clinical Genetics Services page, under their Health Professional Resources tab."
