        "text": "For the past 6 months, I've been fortunate enough to work with the team at The Aquarium, Consortio and Total Resource Solutions to create a new branding suite across the group. From disco balls to fishy features and all that stood between us, the new branding came together cohesively across the group with a fresh, modern approach with an aquatic twist. Thank you to the whole leadership team for diving into the deep end and swimming boldly into the future with this branding project. It also represents a personal milestone of being my first branding project since graduating from Shillington Education in 2018. Pivoting into the world of graphic design was not to be for me at the time (such is life when you discover your boobs are trying to kill you!), so this project has given me so much fulfilment and confidence to develop my skills as a working professional once more. #branding #personaldevelopment #theaquarium\n\n\"Healthcare needs a revolution, not reform.\" üôèüèº There are gaps‚Äîabsolute chasms‚Äîin the health systems we are all a part of. (Did you know that there's no official recorded number of people living with Metastatic Breast Cancer in Australia? That discussion is for another time...) Most of us don't choose to enter into this system; it is all we have at our most vulnerable, when our health fails us. We cannot be the change we want to see in isolation. Patients rely on the expertise of healthcare professionals; they in turn rely on legislative bodies, philanthropy, and corporate funding to research, implement and update their practices. But it all comes back to the patient‚Äîit's our lives, and our legacies, that are affected. To share my lived experience with the indomitable Oongi Barb Flick, a Gomeroi Nation Elder, former nurse and champion of healthcare reform for our First Nations people, and the formidable Paul Bain, a tenacious and worthy advocate for Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and men's health, was truly an honour. My only hope is that our messages were heard by those present in the room, that our perspectives were understood and can be the catalyst for change. And to the woman, the healthcare advocate, the fighter, the mother, entrepreneur and brilliant friend (yes, she really does wear this many hats‚Äîand countless more) who made it all happen. Krystal Barter and the Humanise Health team: THANK YOU. What you do, matters. To so many. It's time to climb that mountain. üéíüèî #ourmomentintime #patientexperience #patientcare #healthcare\n\nI‚Äôm thrilled to be starting a new chapter at Consortio & TRS as a PT Senior Marketing Consultant! Searching for a new role was not on my late-2022 bingo card, but redundancies are unfortunately unavoidable. I‚Äôm not the first in my LinkedIn feed to have experienced it this year. But born from unexpected situations are unexpected possibilities. An application for a temporary contract resulted in being recruited into the recruitment industry! It‚Äôs a completely new frontier, but one I am piqued to be exploring, as well as returning to my strengths‚Äîbrand building, design, communications and engagement. Upmost thanks to Rebecca Pond for noticing my skills were a great fit for the new role, and putting me forward through a quick and seamless interview process. Here‚Äôs to turning the unexpected into the unequivocal.\n\nüíÑ Two things I‚Äôve passionate about come together: women‚Äôs health advocacy and a bold pink lippy! Honoured to be a part of Pink Hope‚Äôs Bright Pink Lipstick Day as an ambassador this year. Cancer waits for no one, but this organisation are working towards empowering women to know their risk, and support them through all stages of breast and ovarian cancers. Read more about the campaign (and why I‚Äôm lending my lips to it) below. üëá üôèIf you can bear to part with your morning coffee dollars and would like to donate to Pink Hope instead, I‚Äôll leave my fundraising link here: https://lnkd.in/gcwPn-ij #health #fundraising #thislipstickcan"
