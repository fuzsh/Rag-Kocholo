        "text": "we fight together, as one, and as a community\n\nfilled with love and hope for one another.\n\nPink Warrior Advocates is focused on providing direct support to those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. We believe in creating a sense of community of Advocates to guide our Warriors through their journeys. We act on what we have experienced in our own personal battles with breast cancer by providing resources, financial assistance, and most importantly, emotional support.\n\nOur Mission\n\n“Empowering those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer while advocating for their emotional and financial wellness.”\n\n​\n\nOur Philosophy\n\nPink Warrior Advocates is focused on providing various forms of support to those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. We believe in creating unity to empower our Warriors through their journeys. We fight together, as one, and as a community filled with love and hope for one another.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nOur history\n\nSince becoming an established 501c3 in August of 2015, we have awarded over $600,000 in grants to those undergoing treatment for a breast cancer diagnosis. In 2018 we initiated a split, which has allowed us to keep your generous donations local, funding the following counties: Comal, Guadalupe, Bexar, Travis, Hays, Bastrop, Caldwell, Medina, Wilson, Bandera, Kerrville, Kendall, Blanco, Gillespie, Llano, Burnett, Williamson, Lee, Gonzeles.\n\nWe are so grateful to be back to our goal since covid of averaging $10,000 in financial assistance every month. The financial grants come in many unique forms ranging from medical bills, living expenses, groceries, and even assisting families with unexpected funeral costs.\n\nIn addition, we have partnered up with various resources, allowing us to fund necessary items such as: care kits, knitted knockers, and mastectomy bras designed by Ana Ono.\n\nIn 2018 we launched MetaWish: a unique program designed to grant wishes for those diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer. With the continued support of our local community, we will have the ability to continue to fulfill all of these necessary needs. Our ongoing goal is to continue to increase our grants so that we may continue lifting the burdens that a cancer diagnosis leaves on our Warriors.\n\n​\n\nOur founder, Jen Reynolds, who battled Stage IV incurable breast cancer, knew what it felt like to go through a breast cancer diagnosis feeling alone and confused, and Pink Warrior Advocates was created to fulfill the needs she felt were lacking in the community.\n\nFrom the moment an individual is diagnosed with cancer, their entire life can take a turn, and though they may not realize it at first, seeking support through those who have experienced and conquered their own battles with cancer is something we believe can help them throughout their journey. No one should ever have to fight this battle feeling alone.\n\nWhile it may be difficult to acknowledge the need for this type of support, Pink Warrior Advocates encourages our Warriors to reach out and provides them with a special support system of Advocates to help guide them through. The life-long bonds that are created through our organization are so meaningful and so important for the well-being of all our Warriors and their Co-Survivors.\n\nWe pride our organization on the philosophy that we fight together, as one, and as a community filled with love and hope for one another.\n\n​"
