        "text": "In this study, we will compare the make-up of breast tissue from women in clinical trials before and after they take preventative drugs, in order to find markers of whether women are responding or not. This research will enable us to better understand why preventative drugs are effective in some women but not in others. As a result, we will be able to better tailor prevention treatment to individual women, which could mean that many women are spared from unnecessarily experiencing tamoxifen’s challenging side effects.\n\nThis study aims to improve risk estimates for breast cancer in younger women, which is typically more aggressive and has differing risk factors to post-menopausal breast cancer. Using genetic testing, this study hopes to develop a more accurate way of predicting a patient’s risk of developing breast cancer and comparing this to existing risk estimates to see which is better for younger women with breast cancer. This research will aid development of new therapies that harness the immune system and improve outcomes for younger breast cancer patients.\n\nIn our previous research, we have developed an ex-plant model (small tissue fragments based on the human breast) which allows fragments of human breast tissue to be cultured in the lab. This follow-on project will carry out in-depth studies to investigate how similar our ex-plant models are to matching samples of breast tissue collected from clinical prevention trials and how they respond to treatment. Our lab-based model, when fully verified, can provide a platform to test new prevention treatments for women who are at a high risk of breast cancer.\n\nThis project looks at improving early detection and breast cancer screening by using microsimulation, a computer programme that analyses data, to predict screening outcomes. Microsimulation models can be used to answer complex questions about screening without the need for costly and impractical clinical trials, which will improve patient outcomes through an efficient use of resources. This research has the potential to improve the NHS breast screening programme by building on current trials investigating screening strategies in women with high breast density.\n\nSNPs are small DNA fragments that our research has proved to be a valid predictor of the risk of developing breast cancer. In total, over 300 of these tiny but significant gene fragments have been discovered by our research team, who have developed a simple saliva test to detect them. Research has shown that around 28% of hereditary breast cancers can be attributed to SNPs variations and they are predicted to account for more once further research has been undertaken. SNPs are far more commonly found than known gene mutations (for example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for around 20%), making them an incredibly important for identifying someone’s breast cancer risk. Our hope for the future is that SNPs testing will form part of the NHS screening programme, and help to predict a woman’s particular breast cancer risk.\n\nPrevent Breast Cancer’s PROCAS (Predicting the Risk of Cancer at Screening) study was launched in 2009 and will revolutionise NHS breast screening by predicting a woman’s individual risk of breast cancer at the time of her mammogram. Risk is calculated based on breast density, family history and lifestyle. We would also like to see SNPs testing as part of the breast screening process. Those found to be at higher risk will be provided with advice and support and where appropriate, offered options including more frequent mammograms, preventative drugs and surgery. The hope is that this more sophisticated approach to screening will be rolled out across the UK in the near future.\n\nHigh breast density is the most significant risk factor for breast cancer after age. It can mean that a woman is six times more likely to develop the disease.\n\nBreast density refers to the supportive tissue around cells in the breast, known as extra-cellular matrix (ECM). An important component of ECM is collagen, which give a “stiffness” to the breast tissue, and breasts with dense ECM show up as whiter on mammograms.\n\nOur scientists worked on lab-based projects to try and understand why high breast density is such a significant indicator of risk. They have discovered that denser breast tissue is subject to higher levels of DNA damage, leading to harmful cell signals getting through, and so affecting cancer risk."
