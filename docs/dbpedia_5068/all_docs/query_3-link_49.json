        "text": "A Study of Familial Breast Cancer in BRCA Mutation-Negative Families: Women with a strong family history of breast cancer, but no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, are two to four times more likely to develop breast cancer than women without a family history. Despite this elevated risk, no clinical guidelines have been developed for the care of these women. This study evaluates factors which may influence their risk.\n\nBreast Cancer Treatment in Women with PALB2 Mutations: The Familial Breast Cancer Research Unit at Women’s College Hospital is conducting a research study to better understand breast cancer treatment among women with a PALB2 gene mutation.\n\nCognition in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers: We are currently recruiting individuals to participate in a study investigating the effects of prophylactic oophorectomy (surgical removal of an ovary or ovaries) on cognition over a three-year period. The purpose of this study is to evaluate possible changes in memory and attention and to determine if there is any correlation with another gene, apolipoprotein E (APOE).\n\nFollow-up Telephone Genetic Counselling Study: This research study aims to evaluate a follow-up telephone-based genetic counselling intervention for women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who have received genetic counselling in the past.\n\nRapid Genetic Testing for Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients Phase II: This study provides genetic testing for nine genes associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers free of charge to participants. Test results are available quickly, with a testing turnaround time of 5-12 days, and all results are disclosed to participants by a genetic counsellor.\n\nReducing the bUrden of Breast cancer in Young women (RUBY) Study: This study is a pan-Canadian collaborative comprised of a national network of 62 researchers and clinicians at 44 institutions and clinics across Canada, with the common goal of studying breast cancer in young women.\n\nRisk Factor Analysis of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer: This is the largest long-term study of women who carry a mutation in one of the two breast cancer genes (BRCA1/BRCA2). Its purpose is to better understand the prevention and treatment of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.\n\nThe Screen Project: The Screen Project is a Canadian National initiative to make BRCA1 & BRCA2 screening available to all Canadians over 18 years of age at an accessible price. We hope that our study will reduce the mortality from breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers.\n\nAt Women’s College Hospital (WCH), your safety and the safety of our physicians and staff is a priority. Minimizing the number of people that come into our hospital during the pandemic is critical to reduce infection transmission.\n\nTo keep you safe, we have several protocols in place. It’s essential that everyone who enters the hospital follow strict infection prevention and control practices, including but not limited to hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, screening for signs and symptoms of illness, and the use of face masks as required.\n\nAlong with other infection prevention and control measures, healthcare organizations have placed limitations on the number of people allowed within the hospital environment during the pandemic. These limitations reduce exposure to potentially infectious individuals and promote the safety of patients, healthcare providers, staff and the public. Adhering closely to these measures, WCH is open. We encourage you to book an appointment should you need to speak with your healthcare provider to discuss any cancer-related concerns.\n\nHealth care needs, specifically cancer concerns, should not be put aside because of COVID-19 — they are more important now than ever. We encourage you to pay close attention to changes in your health, monitor any new symptoms and be proactive if something doesn’t look or feel right.\n\nOur Breast Centre, Familial Ovarian Cancer Clinic (FOCC) and FOCC-Aftercare Clinics, and Gynecology Clinic are open for in-person, telephone or virtual appointments, along with our Family Practice Health Centre. If you are a patient at WCH experiencing any new symptoms, please make an appointment with your primary care provider to address your concerns.\n\nIf your family physician is not at WCH or is not offering services, The Ontario College of Family Physicians has put together this helpful resource to help you access the care you need. Options include finding a walk-in clinic in your neighborhood, connecting with a doctor at the Ontario Virtual Care Clinic and/or finding a family doctor if you don’t already have one."
