        "text": "Christine Runge Weiss, Founder of Faith Wears Pink, an online support platform for women battling breast cancer, shares how she learned she had breast cancer at the age of forty-four. Her diagnosis followed wave after wave of personal crises. In this conversation with Sharon Betters, herself a breast cancer survivor, Christine offers hope and practical help to breast cancer warriors. One evening she realized she was helping over twenty women with their questions, fears, and the unknowns of their journeys. She decided they all needed a way to talk to each other so she started a “Breast Friends” Facebook page. She eventually changed the name to Faith Wears Pink and as of today over 1000 women have connected through this platform. Faith Wears Pink not only connects breast cancer warriors but also gives gifts to women just starting their journey and sponsors periodic gatherings. If you or a loved one is facing this battle, Christine’s joyful perspective will give you hope and ways to navigate what can be a most frightening pathway.\n\nLearn more at faithwearspink.org\n\nChristine Runge is a Wisconsin native but moved to Dallas in 1995. Her 3 kids are her greatest joy! Brooke is 27, has a successful career in marketing and is married; Cole is 25, married, and in his final year of law school; Kylie is 22 and a recent graduate of Baylor University beginning her career in marketing.\n\nShe is a self-employed hairdresser and the founder of FAITH WEARS PINK. After her battle with breast cancer in 2013, at the age of 44, she realized there was a need for spiritual and emotional support for women going through it. What started as a Facebook page for the 22 women she met along her journey, is now a nonprofit organization that supports the spiritual and emotional needs of over 1000 warriors!\n\nIn her free time, she enjoys baking and spending time with her friends, adult children, and significant other Bryan. She also loves having her 3 dogs and a few cats too!"
