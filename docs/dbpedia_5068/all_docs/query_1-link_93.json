        "text": "The Head - This logo symbolize the impact that Breast Cancer has on the human race. Your gender, ethnic background, religion, or financial status will not save you from this disease. Anyone could be diagnosed at anytime or anywhere.\n\nArm Sleeve - Showing support and raising awareness for those that suffer from Lymphedema. This is caused when lymph nodes are removed due to cancer stage. There is no cure for this disease. However, exercise, wearing the compression sleeve and massages controls the inflammation, and discomfort. I personally have been diagnosed with Lymphedema.\n\nThe Apparel - A crown turned upside down for “queen or king status”. I chose a pink crown because this color represents charm, sensitivity, can be linked to being feminine or masculine. A queen or king can either carry this apparel or wear it with strength."
