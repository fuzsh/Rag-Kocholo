        "text": "Liam Ronan-Chlond (L) and Daniel May (R) from Socius\n\nEmployees from land developer Socius have donned their running shoes to raise money for The Institute of Cancer Research – as members of our 2024 London Marathon team.\n\nSocius’ Head of Engagement Liam Ronan-Chlond and Development Director Daniel May are taking on the iconic course as one of a series of challenges by teams from Socius and colleagues from insurer Aviva.\n\nSocius and Aviva staff are fundraising for the ICR after the companies joined the partnership at The London Cancer Hub in Sutton, south London, which is aiming to make Sutton the home of the world’s leading district for cancer research and treatment.\n\nThe companies are currently consulting with local communities as they bring together proposals for a five-hectare site at The London Cancer Hub, that will consist of labs, commercial workspace, accommodation and local amenities. These spaces aim to attract researchers and scientists from around the world, and accelerate the development of ground-breaking cancer treatments.\n\nOther challenges that Liam, Daniel and their colleagues are set to take on to raise money for cancer research include the RideLondon-Essex bike ride and the Great North Run.\n\nEndurance challenges\n\nFor keen runner Liam, the London Marathon is one of a series of endurance trials over the summer. Having reached his training peak of a 20-mile run over the Easter Weekend, he ran the Sheffield Half Marathon as part of his preparations for the big day in the capital this Sunday.\n\n“We’ve all been touched by cancer at some point in our lives,” says Liam, “whether personally or through a family or friend. Sadly, half of us will develop cancer in our lifetimes. That’s why the work of The Institute of Cancer Research is so important.”\n\nNewer runner Daniel’s effort is heroic too – having taken on the challenge just two months before the event.\n\n“In a moment of madness, I agreed to run the London Marathon,” he says, “giving me a total of 65 days of training. I've never run more than 10km, I'm not a massive fan of running, and it's never been on my bucket list!”\n\nYou can support Liam and Daniel’s efforts directly through their fundraising pages: Liam and Daniel.\n\nLook out on the ICR’s Twitter/X profile for updates from our team on London Marathon day. You can find out more about The London Cancer Hub on the ICR’s website.\n\nCorporate challenges\n\nWould your company like to support the ICR through a corporate partnership? Contact Corporate Partnerships Manager Annie Edwards to find out more at [email protected].\n\nAlison Halliday reflects on some of the key achievements from our Business and Innovation Office over the past year.\n\nIt’s been a busy year for the Business and Innovation Office here at The Institute of Cancer Research, as we’ve been seeking to foster the interactions with industry that ensure our research leads rapidly to benefits for people with cancer. Read on for just a few of our achievements of 2022.\n\nA CGI image of the Innovation Gateway at The London Cancer Hub\n\nInnovation Gateway\n\nThe Innovation Gateway – a new incubator and collaboration space for innovative life-science companies – opened its doors at The London Cancer Hub in Sutton, south London in February.\n\nIts creation marked a significant step in realising the vision of The London Cancer Hub, an ambitious partnership led by the London Borough of Sutton and the ICR.\n\nIn November, personalised medicines start-up Curesponse – which is developing a platform for evaluating drug response and guiding personalised cancer treatment – became the latest company to move in at the Innovation Gateway.\n\nThe medtech company joined a growing innovation ecosystem at The London Cancer Hub, alongside fellow tenants Vesynta – a start-up delivering personalised dosing guided by ‘medicine exposure’ measurements – and The Exercise Clinic, a company offering physiotherapy and exercise regimes for cancer patients.\n\n‘Breakthrough’ in cancer treatment\n\nWe’re extremely proud of the latest news from a long-term drug discovery and development programme that’s involved the ICR and the pharmaceutical companies Astex and AstraZeneca.\n\nA new targeted cancer drug called capivasertib – which emerged from that programme –has shown ‘remarkable’ results against advanced breast cancer in a phase III trial.\n\nThe development of capivasertib followed years of fundamental research at the ICR, aimed at understanding how the AKT protein – the drug’s target – is regulated. The story provides a compelling example of the ICR’s excellence at translating scientific discoveries about the biology of cancer cells into innovative new cancer treatments, with real benefits for patients.\n\nCapivasertib is also being evaluated in major phase III trials for triple-negative breast cancer and PTEN-deficient prostate cancers – which, if successful, could provide urgently needed new treatment options for other groups of patients with advanced disease that has become resistant to other treatments.\n\nTop marks\n\nWe were thrilled that this year to once again rank among the top academic institutions in the UK for generating income from our intellectual property.\n\nThe ICR received the fifth highest amount of invention income overall – and the most income per member of academic staff – compared with all other UK higher education institutions in the 2020/21 academic year.\n\nFive months later, we were also rated as one of the UK’s top higher education institutions in the latest Knowledge Exchange Framework (KEF) – a Government assessment of universities’ influence on society.\n\nEvents are back! And new collaboration opportunities\n\nWe’ve also been working to showcase our opportunities to forge fruitful new collaborations between our scientists and industrial partners in the future.\n\nOur Partnering to Defeat Cancer series of business networking events returned in July, with ICR scientists giving presentations on their work to an audience of industry professionals before a networking reception.\n\nWe’ve been busy creating brochures on licensing and partnering opportunities on highlighted research projects, which are available to download on our website.\n\nAnd you can watch our new film that introduces our work to commercialise our discoveries, in collaboration with industry partners – featuring ICR scientists, staff from our Business and Innovation Office alongside our commercial partners.\n\nCelebrating a culture of innovation\n\nClosing out an eventful year, the ICR’s staff awards ceremony provided us with an opportunity to celebrate the success of our researchers who are working with industry to translate discoveries into patient benefit.\n\nWe warmly congratulated this year’s Innovation category award winners – highly commended Dr Matthew Blackledge, Team Leader in Computational Imaging at the ICR in the Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, and winner Professor Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at the ICR and Consultant Oncologist at our partner hospital, The Royal Marsden.\n\nWe hope their success will help to inspire others encourage to identify and develop new ideas with commercial opportunity and work in an entrepreneurial way!\n\nFind out more\n\nContact our Business and Innovation Office to learn more about working with us.\n\nA fundamental shift is happening right now in the UK life-science sector.\n\nCompanies have been moving away from the traditional ‘science park’ working model – with stand-alone developments in out-of-town places – and are making major investments in city-based laboratories and workspaces.\n\nScience is increasingly taking place in ‘open collaboration’ between industry, academics, and other partners such as NHS hospitals.\n\nOften these centres are close to universities that are already famous for pioneering new approaches in science, medicine and healthcare. In London, they include Imperial College London and White City, the Francis Crick Institute and the developing Knowledge Quarter in Kings Cross, and us at The Institute of Cancer Research at The London Cancer Hub in Sutton, South London.\n\nBut why is this shift happening?\n\n1. Academic innovation and expertise\n\nOne of the reasons we’re seeing more life-science developments in UK cities, especially in the ‘golden triangle’ of London, Oxford and Cambridge, is that many of the most innovative new ideas in the sector come from our universities. Companies want to work with academics to develop their ideas and scale up their discoveries.\n\nThe development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is one of the most famous recent examples of academic-industry collaboration, although ultimately, the development of most modern medicines has been underpinned by academic discovery allied with industrial development, from antibiotics to immunotherapy.\n\nAt the ICR, the past few years have seen the discovery and development of multiple new cancer drugs, and the development of pioneering new radiotherapy technology, in collaboration with industry partners.\n\n2. Record investment\n\nThere is a record level of investment in the UK life sciences right now, according to the latest figures from the BIA, with investment in UK biotech at £4.5 billion in 2021. Venture capital investors are backing biotech companies and we’ve seen notable initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies spinning out from academia – such as Oxford Nanopore and Monte Rosa Therapeutics, the latter of which was originally a spin-out from ICR science and listed last year on New York’s NASDAQ stock exchange.\n\nThis kind of investment is leading to a surge in demand for quality laboratory space. MedCity, which represents the life-sciences across London and England’s South East, recently reported a four-fold increase in demand for life sciences real estate over the past five years, and demand is rising faster than supply.\n\n3. Working from home\n\nFor property investors – across the world as well as the UK – the life sciences is an attractive proposition partly because of the changes to our working lives caused by Covid.\n\nIn a new era of home working for ‘office’ workers, property developments have become more attractive to investors if they include spaces that anchor professionals there – like laboratories, which of course many scientists cannot work without. You can’t work from home if you need a lab!\n\nThere was a trend towards major urban developments in the life sciences even before Covid, but pandemic-era announcements by the likes of Merck and AstraZeneca suggest this could be a longer-term change.\n\n4. Intellectual property\n\nSome analysts point to an ongoing transition to open innovation in the Big Pharma business model that involves being receptive to rapidly adopting innovations from outside their own walls, including from the academic sector.\n\nThis business model involves shifting some of the focus from in-house research and development to being primed to act when intellectual property, like that emerging from academic institutions and their spin-outs, becomes available – as well as working in collaboration with academics and smaller companies, by co-locating with them.\n\n5. Recruitment\n\nAnalysts also point to recruitment as a key strategic reason to be based near cities and academic districts – close to the thriving cultural hubs where people want to live, and where they might find the best new recruits coming straight from the academic centres. And where it is easy to move between different companies as they grow and evolve.\n\n… and 6. The Innovation Gateway\n\nSo why should companies looking for lab space consider taking space here at The London Cancer Hub?\n\nThe Innovation Gateway is a new, modern laboratory and collaboration space that is set to become home to a variety of life-science companies – and definitely ticks the box for academic innovation and expertise.\n\nThe development contains around 6,300 square feet of space, of which about 3,500 square feet is new laboratory space – and we’re looking for licensees now, especially those working in fields related to oncology.\n\nIt’s part of The London Cancer Hub – a partnership led by the ICR and the London Borough of Sutton which aims to generate around 7,000 new jobs in the life sciences, and create the world’s leading life-science campus specialising in cancer research, treatment, education and enterprise.\n\nModern facilities\n\nLicensees at the Innovation Gateway will benefit not only from new modern facilities in the building itself, but also potential collaborations with scientists at the ICR – which is already a world leader in collaborating with industry partners to translate its discoveries into benefits for patients, including through the discovery and development of new cancer drugs.\n\nThere’s also potential access to the ICR’s state-of-the-art scientific and other facilities and a location adjacent to our partner hospital – the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. And all at a location in Sutton, South London, affording easy access into Central London while at the same time being close to the desirable Surrey hills.\n\nOne of London’s greenest boroughs, Sutton is also home to some of the UK’s best secondary schools – and there’s even a fantastic new school on site at The London Cancer Hub.\n\nSo if you’re a company interested in taking space here, get in touch!\n\nWith thanks to Jack Sallabank at Future Places Studio\n\nEvolution by natural selection is the foundation law of biology. So we shouldn’t be surprised that it has great relevance to cancer.\n\n‘Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution’\n\nTheodosius Dobzhansky, 1973\n\nAlmost 40 years ago, Peter Nowell first championed the idea that cancer is, fundamentally, a process of somatic cell evolution 1. Since then, the concept has been validated and elaborated, such that the striking parallels with Darwinian speciation by natural selection in ecosystems have been highlighted on many occasions 2,3,4.\n\nMore recently, the rapid expansion of research in cancer genomics has resulted in a massive endorsement of the Darwinian perspective. Provided with detailed genetic descriptions and the technologies for interrogating both single cells and multi-regional small biopsies, it now possible to reveal the space-time genetic diversification of cancer cells and to reconstruct clonal phylogenies. In effect, we can now chronicle evolutionary histories.\n\nIt’s a striking fact that every patient’s cancer has an individually unique and very varied clonal architecture and evolutionary history. This knowledge is now driving practical oncology in the clinic. Quantitative measures of intra-clonal genetic diversity (measures of the genetic differences between the many descendants of the tumour’s few formative cells) appear to be predictive of the progression of a disease. Clinical response can also be predicted, probably as a surrogate for the probability of drug resistance. Furthermore, measures of tissue ecosystem diversity may also be predictive of outcome; again this is as would be predicted from evolutionary principles, since the ecosystem provides the selective pressures for clonal diversification.\n\nObservations such as these endorse the idea that evolutionary biology can provide a very appropriate and clinically valuable perspective on cancer. Potentially, this is a paradigm shift with major implications for the way we think about the fundamental biology of cancer and for our attempts to control it 5-8. Evolutionary considerations will help us to explain the big questions, such as “Why are humans so vulnerable to cancer?” 9Evolutionary biology shouldn’t be regarded as a sub-topic of cancer sciences, it is a conceptual framework for every aspect of our endeavours in cancer.\n\nMost biologists, epidemiologists and oncologists involved in cancer research are to some extent aware of cancer’s evolutionary character. But many, on a day-to-day basis, have insufficient appreciation of the underlying biological principles and their potentially radical clinical implications. At the same time, the topic of cancer evolutionary biology is expanding very rapidly with increasing numbers of papers in premier journals and major presentations at conference symposia. So we think that the time seems right for a commentary-style blog designed to communicate these exciting new advances and to foster debate.\n\nThis British Journal of Cancer-based blog is aimed at trainees and senior professionals in all areas of cancer research and treatment – for academic biologists, clinicians, chemists (in drug development for example) and epidemiologists, as well as pharmaceutical industry-based scientists involved in cancer therapeutics. But we hope our content will also interest evolutionary biologists considering the implications of their field for human health and biologists and clinicians engaged in the related but broader topic of evolutionary medicine 10.\n\nIn the first week we will publish three introductory pieces setting the scene and giving a gentle introduction to some of the more complex themes that will feature in posts to come. Later in the month we will publish the first of the regular discussion posts which will address key issues and new insights into the evolutionary biology of cancer as and when they arise. We hope to also feature guest posts from invited scientists and clinicians.\n\nMy primary objective is to facilitate debate, particularly on contentious issues, so I invite responses from readers either using the comments section or the contact page. Most of all, I and those who have helped set up this blog at the BJC hope you will find it a stimulating read.\n\nMel\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Each day we’ll bring you a new discovery, looking at what we found, and what the impact of this research could be for cancer patients.\n\nSo keep an eye on our website as we reveal our most exciting achievements of the year. Our highlights include clinical trial results that we hope will change clinical practice, research revealing the structure of key proteins in cancer development, the discovery of a genetic link between two apparently unrelated diseases, and potential new ways to prevent cancer cells from spreading or to identify the patients most likely to respond to certain treatments.\n\nWe have started this week with research which discovered that the prostate cancer drug enzalutamide improves patient survival in men with prostate cancer before chemotherapy, and a discovery that revealed the structure of one of the most important and complicated proteins in cell division and cancer, which you can read about here.\n\nWe hope you’ll come back and see what we announce over the next few weeks.\n\nIf you follow the work of The Institute of Cancer Research, you’ll have seen a lot of buzz on our website recently about a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors.\n\nThe story behind PARP inhibitors is underpinned by 20 years of research here at the ICR in London, so we have been following developments closely. I thought I’d take a moment to update you.\n\nThe big news for PARP inhibitors came in October, with the announcement from the European Medicines Agency that its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had recommended that olaparib be approved for women with ovarian cancer who have a BRCA mutation. The recommendation from the EMA is an important step forward in olaparib’s path to patients, and the drug will now be referred to the European Commission for a decision on EU-wide marketing authorisation.\n\nNot only is olaparib the first PARP inhibitor to reach this stage but it is the first time a cancer drug targeted at an inherited genetic fault will have been approved.\n\nWith all the discussion in the media recently around access to the latest cancer drugs in the UK, the next big question is whether the NHS will pay for PARP inhibitors. The good news is that NICE has already started the appraisal process for olaparib, and estimates that the process should be finalised by September 2015.\n\nIn the meantime, NHS England has included olaparib on a recently announced list of new drugs which it will be considering making available through the Cancer Drugs Fund, so we’re waiting to see the outcomes of that decision in December.\n\nOlaparib’s assessment for use on the NHS is a great example of how scientific research carried out here at the ICR can be translated into real benefits for patients.\n\nResearchers at the ICR discovered that the protein produced by the BRCA2 gene plays a role in repairing damaged DNA.\n\nCells with BRCA mutations can survive by using an alternative DNA repair pathway which involves PARP proteins. But using PARP inhibitors such as olaparib to block this second pathway kills cancer cells with BRCA mutations, while leaving normal cells which have a working BRCA repair system unharmed.\n\nThis approach exploits a specific genetic weakness of cancer cells and provided a completely new approach to treatment.\n\nThe ICR’s Professor Alan Ashworth, who led the research showing that cancers with BRCA mutations could be exploited with PARP inhibitors, issued a statement on the committee’s decision. He said: “The European Medicines Agency's recommendation that olaparib be approved for some patients with ovarian cancer marks an important moment in the development of targeted treatments for cancer. It is a great example of how collaboration can take scientific principles and turn them into treatments – showing how close interaction between researchers here at the ICR, a UK biotech and drug company, NHS hospitals and charitable funding bodies can improve the outlook for cancer patients worldwide.”\n\nWe hope that this drug really will make a difference to many patients worldwide. The recent announcements on olaparib refer to the drug being used for people with ovarian cancer who have BRCA mutations, but research has also found benefits for patients with BRCA mutations who have other cancer types, such as breast cancer.\n\nAnd earlier this month the Professor Johann de Bono spoke at a national cancer conference on early trial results indicating that PARP inhibitors could also benefit patients with prostate cancer who had mutations to DNA repair genes within their tumours.\n\nYou can read more about the ICR’s research on PARP inhibitors in this feature article on the ICR website here. We’ve very hopeful that our research will go on to have real benefits for patients with cancer treated on the NHS.\n\nTuesday was a busy day at the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Cancer Conference, with many interesting sessions spanning a wide breadth of cancer topics.\n\nThe session that really grabbed my attention was the second round of NCRI celebratory talks, which were a reflection back on the past and a look to the future of key areas of cancer research. I enjoyed these series of talks immensely, and came away inspired by all the incredible groundwork that has already been made in cancer research.\n\nThe lectures looked at where we are going with clinical trial design, metabolomics and localised therapies, following on from yesterday’s celebratory talks.\n\nClinical trials\n\nFirst up was Professor Andrew Hughes from the University of Manchester, who also leads the early clinical development group at AstraZeneca. He told us that ten years ago, clinical trials were often based on biopsies, were focused on single molecular targets, and encompassed laborious data capture.\n\nHe stated that taking biopsies – particularly in patients with lung cancer – is not only painful, but can actually contribute to mortality. But now we looking to a future when we will be able to carry out ‘virtual’ biopsies – meaning looking at circulating tumour DNA from a series of blood samples, rather than putting patients through uncomfortable biopsy procedures.\n\nProfessor Hughes also told us that conducting clinical trials that only test for a single molecular target can leave patients disillusioned when they are ineligible. One way to select more patients for trials is to use a ‘bucket’ trial approach – to send a patient’s sample to a genetic technology hub, where they will be tested for biomarkers and then matched to the molecular targeted agent most appropriate to them.\n\nAlso, clinical trial data capture is still quite archaic, Professor Hughes pointed out. One of the main problems is the long delay from the point where a study nurse notes down data, to the point where an investigator views that data. By simply using an electronic tablet to capture data, in addition to other visual and audio aids – such as a picture of a rash, or patients being recorded verbally – in the future, investigators will have access to patient data more quickly.\n\nMetabolomics\n\nIn the next talk, Professor Karen Vousden from the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute gave us a fascinating insight into how changes in metabolic pathways can contribute to cancer. Changes can lead to many advantages for the cancer cell, promoting and supporting tumour formation.\n\nOne of the challenges facing cancer cells is fluctuation in available nutrients. They rely on the amino acids serine and glycine for cell proliferation and survival. So what if we could starve cancer cells of these crucial amino acids – would we influence tumour growth?\n\nIn a series of experiments, Professor Vousden had been able to show that removing serine and glycine from the diets of mice did indeed slow down tumour growth, increasing their survival.\n\nLocalised therapies\n\nThe final NCRI celebratory talk was from Professor Tim Maughan, from the Cancer Research UK and Medical Research Council Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology. He overviewed surgery and radiotherapy – two localised therapies commonly used in cancer.\n\nSurgical techniques have come on in leaps and bounds over the last 30 years, Professor Maughan said, with approaches now being less invasive, more precise and better guided. Some are even being performed by robotic devices. Image-guided radiotherapy has revolutionised the field of radiotherapy – a technique trail blazed by researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research.\n\nProfessor Maughan stated the next phase of progress will be biologically driven, with variations in the tumour microenvironment – a big influencer in how well a patient will respond to radiotherapy – being defined. This biologically-based stratification of patients combined with the added anatomical precision of modern radiotherapy will carry great promise in improving outcomes in the next decade.\n\nResearch into liver cancer could identify new markers to predict which treatments will work and new drug targets - which is why The Institute of Cancer Research, London, has launched a new fundraising appeal.\n\nLiver cancer rarely makes the headlines. It is hard to detect and has one of the lowest survival rates of any cancer, with only 20% of patients living one year after diagnosis and only 5% still alive after five years. There is only one drug treatment available for patients with liver cancer and it is limited in its effectiveness, so there is a desperate need for more research into the disease.\n\nTo bridge the gap, the ICR has launched a new fundraising appeal for liver cancer, focused on the work of Dr Chiara Braconi, a clinician scientist working within our Division of Cancer Therapeutics. She is studying fascinating and little understood molecules called microRNAs – tiny signals within cells responsible for regulating the activity of genes – to understand if they can predict how a patient will respond to liver cancer treatment.\n\nBeing able to predict treatment response is extremely important to choose the best drug and avoid needlessly exposing people to side-effects if a drug is unlikely to do them any good. Dr Braconi plans to use money raised in the appeal to identify new biomarkers that can be detected with simple blood tests, and possibly novel targets for more effective liver cancer therapies.\n\nI spoke to Dr Braconi about what makes liver cancer so difficult to treat, and how her research could help.\n\nShe told me: “There are two forms of cancer that originate directly into the liver: hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Both are very resistant to standard chemotherapy. In addition, most liver cancer patients suffer from cirrhosis, which makes them more prone to get side-effects from drugs. Identification of biomarkers of sensitivity is the key.”\n\nShe said: “For most patients with liver cancer prognosis is very poor. The liver is a maintenance organ, and can cause the whole body to collapse if it doesn’t function properly. Fortunately, liver cancer is not as common here in the UK as other cancer types. However, this rarity has caused the research community to shift its attention to other forms of cancer, leaving us underprepared in terms of viable therapies.”\n\nLast year 4,000 people died from liver cancer in the UK, and the incidence of the disease is increasing.\n\n“My hope for this appeal is to spread awareness towards a form of cancer which affects more and more people every year,” Dr Braconi said. “These patients are in great need of attention and of more personalised therapies, and I hope to help provide new treatments through my research.\"\n\nYesterday Professor Richard Marais opened the 10th National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) conference celebratory talks by setting the scene for the session’s big-hitting speakers. He told a packed lecture theatre, “At this 10th year it's important for us to see where we have come from and where we are going in the fields of patient care, genetic basis of drug discovery and genomics.\"\n\nThe first of the three celebratory talks was from Professor Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals for the Department of Health. He opened the session with an overview of the last 30 years in cancer services.\n\nIt seems we have come a long way since the 1980s, which Professor Richards referred to as ‘the dark ages’, where there was little open discussion about cancer. Even though we have progressed brilliantly in the last 30 years, with many new initiatives in research and patient care launched, we still have a lot of work to do.\n\nDr William Sellers, director of cancer drug discovery at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, discussed the future of targeted therapies – stressing that we need to look at the oncogenes that are traditionally hard to target (such as transcription factors), target tumour suppressor pathways (with a particular focus on synthetic lethality) and deal with therapeutic resistance by thinking about combination and sequential therapies.\n\nIt was the middle talk of the session that especially grabbed me though, with Professor Sir Mike Stratton giving a virtuoso overview of the field of genomics. Fifty years ago things were much more basic than today, focusing on cytogenetics and copy number changes. Moving into the 1980s we were performing copy number analysis and the harvest for cancer genes began, resulting in 2,000 cancer genomes sequenced. Now, we have sequenced nearly 20,000 cancer genomes.\n\nSo what have we been able to do with all this information? We have identified large numbers of drug targets - 600-700 cancer genes have been identified and many are potentially druggable.\n\nBut we have discovered that there are few common mutations, and the majority of mutations are found in less than 10% of patients. We’re likely to be looking at different drug targets, in other words, in the many different genetic sub-types of cancer.\n\nGenomics has given us a fantastic insight into cancer evolution – giving clues, for instance, about how metastasis starts. Researchers are beginning to be able to use circulating tumour DNA for early detection of cancer, and to predict outcome and response to therapies.\n\nAnd where can we expect genomics to take us next? Professor Stratton, Director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, suggested that in the next five years, we would see the next round of genome sequencing. He predicted we would uncover many more new mutations that occur only infrequently in cancer – the ‘long tail’ of cancer genomics – and would ultimately need to decide how long to keep on going in characterising cancer.\n\nProfessor Stratton finished by stressing that the costs of sequencing are getting lower and lower – he estimated that one mutation costs around £60 to sequence, compared with £1,200 for the whole genome. Gradually, over time we can expect the differential between sequencing a gene and sequencing a whole genome to get smaller and smaller - adding fuel to the genomics fire.\n\nAs we start the 10th National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Cancer Conference, there is a real buzz in the air. With a record number of abstracts submitted this year, there is a choice of more than 150 speakers from across the globe talking and debating a myriad of topics ranging from cancer diagnosis and therapy to survivorship and end-of-life care.\n\nWe are in for a stimulating programme, with many of our researchers presenting their work here, including Dr Gerhardt Attard and Professors Ian Collins, Johann de Bono and Kevin Harrington.\n\nBefore the main conference kicked off today, we were lucky to sit in on a fantastic debate last night – chaired by the Director of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Centre here at the ICR, Professor Andrew Tutt – that asked ‘Genomic medicine in metastatic breast cancer: reality or hype?’\n\n1,000 women die each month in the UK as a result of metastatic breast cancer. It’s an alarming figure, highlighting the need for better treatments that will help those diagnosed to live longer and healthier lives. With the advent of more affordable and elegant sequencing technologies, and the launch of the 100,000 genomes project, research can potentially move away from characterising the few known genetic markers associated with breast cancers and instead focus on the information found in entire genomes.\n\nThe dream of using these data to inform treatment choice is now closer to becoming a reality. Or is it?\n\nFor the debate, Professor Tutt had pulled together a panel of experts – Professor David Cameron and Dr Iain MacPherson in favour of using genomic medicine in metastatic breast cancer, and Dr David Miles and Dr Andreas Makris, who were sceptical about this approach.\n\nTo start with, Professor Tutt asked the audience, “who believes genomic medicine in metastatic breast cancer is a hype, and who believes it's a reality?” The vote was close, with around 45% of the audience believing it was hype, and the remaining 55% thinking it was a reality.\n\nWe heard a 10 minute pitch from each speaker, who threw up some really interesting points – including Dr MacPherson quoting Lord Kelvin, who said in 1997, \"The radio has no future...\".\n\nOn a more serious note, one of the main rationales against the genomic approach was the problem of cancer evolution and tumour heterogeneity – and the need for focusing on the driver mutations. Dr Makris stated, \"You can't derail the cancer train by shooting the passenger, you have to kill the driver\". Other points for the case against included the concern that we could be neglecting other promising treatment approaches in favour of this hyped up and fashionable route.\n\nThe arguments in favour included the fact that we are already focusing on HER2 copy number and ‘BRCA-ness’ with promising results. Whole genomic analyses can sometimes even show that the patient doesn't even have the disease – and Professor MacPherson also made the point that genomic sequencing will throw up rarer frequency mutations.\n\nAfter we heard a very informative and at times, a very witty and amusing debate, Professor Tutt took another audience vote. It seemed that there was a bit of a swing, with a 50/50 divide in opinion.\n\nWhatever your opinion may be, we are now at a fantastic point where we are questioning what paths to take in treating metastatic breast cancer.\n\nThe UK’s biggest annual cancer research conference – the NCRI – is not the only one drawing our scientists this weekend. As the talks start on Sunday in Liverpool, some of our researchers will be making an alternative trip over to Berlin for ‘Goodbye Flat Biology’ – with more than 250 delegates, the biggest conference to date to focus on creating tumour models from cells in three dimensions.\n\n‘Two dimensional’ cell cultures – the well-known research model of cells grown in a flat sheets in plastic dishes – can tell researchers a lot about cancer, but only replicate the disease up to a point. Tumours, particularly advanced tumours, are three-dimensional structures made up of different cell types, with their own blood supply and a complex relationship with the non-cancerous tissues surrounding them.\n\nThe things that make tumours metastatic – that help them invade and spread around the body, colonise new sites and cause the majority of cancer deaths – are particularly difficult to mimic in a petri dish. Researchers need new, three-dimensional tools to study them.\n\nThat’s what researchers at the ICR, including Professor Sue Eccles and Dr Maria Vinci – who are co-chairing the conference – are developing. At the conference, one of a series in specific research areas run by the European Association for Cancer Research, delegates will share knowledge and expertise in this exciting emerging field.\n\nAnimal alternatives\n\nThese new 3D models will become important research tools in their own right – but they are also an example of how cancer researchers are aiming to reduce the number of animals used in preclinical research.\n\nAlthough earlier-stage studies of cancer can rely on cells in a dish, ‘2D’ cell cultures cannot reliably mimic how cancers behave inside a body – such as cancer cells’ ability to move and invade tissues. Scientists often need to look in mice to see how they behave in a living organism – our researchers, for instance, often use mice to see whether a potential drug has an effect on a living tumour. The expectation is that 3D models will take the place of mice for some of this sort of work.\n\nProfessor Eccles’s own 3D cell cultures have already reduced the number of mice needed to bring each new drug to the clinic – as she discussed at the British Science Festival last year at a session arranged by the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research. The NC3Rs, the leading national scientific body dedicated to these goals, has funded some of our work to develop new 3D models of cancer.\n\nWe often hear the UK life sciences sector described as a vibrant ecosystem, bringing together government, charity and private sector funding. It’s a comment we’ve made ourselves before, and is widely seen as a real strength for UK science.\n\nThis week I was lucky enough to attend a Summer Reception at the House of Commons which really drove home the point – showcasing the results of these sorts of collaborations and the benefits of investing in medical research.\n\nMPs, Peers, research funders, industry representatives and medical researchers gathered at the Summer Reception, organised by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Medical Research.\n\nI attended the event with Dr Chris Lord, a team leader here at The Institute of Cancer Research, who works on breast cancer genetics and ways of exploiting specific genetic weaknesses of cancer cells.\n\nHe presented research conducted here at the ICR which has led to a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors – which have gone on to show remarkable effectiveness in clinical trials of patients with breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.\n\nAround 20 years ago, scientists at the ICR discovered the BRCA2 gene, which when mutated increases the risk of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. This discovery of BRCA2 and its links to some cancers paved the way for genetic testing and the discovery of treatments for patients with the faulty gene.\n\nICR researchers went on to find that the protein produced by the BRCA2 gene plays a vital role in repairing damaged DNA, and found a way to turn this weakness against cancer cells.\n\nCells with BRCA mutations can survive as another DNA repair pathway exists, involving PARP proteins. But if cells do not have either a functional BRCA repair pathway or a PARP repair pathway, they die.\n\nScientists found that blocking PARP proteins killed cancer cells with BRCA mutations, but left normal cells – with a working BRCA repair system – unharmed. Cells with BRCA mutations were up to 1,000 times more sensitive to PARP inhibitors than normal cells. It was a completely new approach to cancer treatment.\n\nThis research underpinned the discovery of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors, which have now been successfully tested against many types of cancer in clinical trials. You can read more about this work in a booklet which accompanied the event – A Healthy Future for UK Medical Research.\n\nThe event coincided with the launch of a new report on the economic benefit of cancer research in the UK, which several of the speakers made reference to in their talks. Cancer Research UK covered the launch of the report on its blog which you can read here. The key message for me was that for every pound invested in cancer research, the UK economy gains 40p every year afterwards, providing economic return as well as health gains.\n\nThe work that Dr Lord presented at the Summer Reception is a great example of how an initial discovery – that of the BRCA2 predisposition gene – can have just this sort of impact. The discovery has enabled families with a history of breast cancer to be informed about their risk, guiding decisions over preventative measures and personalised cancer treatment, and laid the groundwork for developing novel forms of therapy for BRCA-associated cancers.\n\nWe think this work is a real British success story, showing how close interaction between ICR scientists, a UK drug company, NHS hospitals and funding bodies can improve the outlook for cancer patients.\n\nWhat does the future of cancer treatment hold?\n\nThat was the subject of discussion last week as some of our researchers here at The Institute of Cancer Research and our partner hospital The Royal Marsden appeared together at The Times Cheltenham Science Festival.\n\nIt was the first time that the ICR and The Royal Marsden have held an event at the festival, and we were keen to get across a range of the most exciting translational and clinical research that we conduct together. We decided to focus on some of the work conducted together within our two virtual centres – the Cancer Research UK Centre at the ICR and The Royal Marsden, and the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre.\n\nDr Marco Gerlinger opened the event by setting out the biggest challenge facing cancer researchers and clinicians at the moment – cancer’s ability to evolve and eventually resist treatment. He explained how in some cancers no two cells may be the same, with tumours made up of multiple ‘clones’ all with different combinations of mutations. These clones are capable of evolving to adapt to new circumstances, and that’s how drug resistance develops. One way to tackle this is to target the environment the cancer is in rather than the cancer itself, and another is to use combinations of targeted treatments. You can read more about this work in a feature article on our new Centre for Evolution and Cancer.\n\nOur second speaker, Professor Kevin Harrington, then went on to explain some of the advances in his field – radiotherapy. New techniques for the delivery of radiotherapy mean we can now guide radiation in a much more targeted fashion, with the hope that we will soon be able to do so by using real time-imaging of the tumour. The ICR and The Royal Marsden have recently been announced as the first in the UK to gain access to a state-of-the-art radiotherapy system which should allow us to do this. He illustrated why that matters by talking about patients with lung cancer, who have the inconvenient habit of breathing when receiving radiotherapy, significantly changing the position of their tumour.\n\nDr James Larkin of The Royal Marsden finished the opening discussions by explaining about his work using immunotherapy to direct a patient’s own immune system against a tumour. This field of research is still at an early stage, but new breakthroughs are happening all of the time and Dr Larkin said he believed treating cancers with immunotherapy could potentially be as promising as radiotherapy and surgery when it comes to curing patients, at least for some cancers.\n\nThe floor was then opened to the audience to ask our expert panel anything on the future of cancer treatment. This was my first time attending the science festival, and one of the things that really impressed me at the events I went to was the amount of discussion with the audience. At our event the questions really covered the breadth of cancer research, treatment and policy, covering not just science but a range of social and ethical issues from an audience who were clearly very engaged with the topic.\n\nSome of the questions that most interested me touched on the benefits of working in partnership between a hospital and a research institute, the role of competition in academic research, the competing costs of different types of cancer treatments and the role of NICE in deciding what counts as value for money for the NHS. In fact there were so many questions that the three speakers stayed on at the end to go to the festival’s ‘Talking Point’ to continue the discussions. I could fill a whole week of blog posts with the interesting responses our speakers gave to these questions!\n\nI really enjoyed the event, learning a lot from what the speakers had to say and the level of audience engagement. I had chance to spend the whole day at the festival, attending a few other events, and speaking to researchers at the more ‘hands on’ exhibitions.\n\nThe ICR is looking at expanding the amount of public engagement work that we do; this blog is just one of the ways in which we are increasingly sharing the exciting research that we are doing. With events like Cheltenham Science Festival on the annual science calendar, I think we’re going to have a really great time doing so.\n\nToday NICE announced its decision not to recommend use of the prostate cancer drug abiraterone in patients who are yet to receive chemotherapy, saying it would not be cost-effective for the NHS.\n\nI’ve been following the NICE assessment of abiraterone closely as it is a really important drug for us here at The Institute of Cancer Research. It was discovered by the ICR and the early clinical development of the drug was carried out by the ICR and it’s clinical partner The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. We’re really disappointed, as you might expect, to see that NICE is not extending use of abiraterone to more patients.\n\nWhat is abiraterone?\n\nAbiraterone has been available for prostate cancer patients in the UK since the European Medicines Authority licensed the drug in 2011, quickly becoming one of the most requested drugs on the Cancer Drugs Fund. The drug works by blocking the production of testosterone, which prostate tumours rely on to grow. You can read more about the discovery and development of abiraterone in this feature article on our website.\n\nBased on the results of a pivotal trial led by the ICR and The Royal Marsden, NICE ran an appraisal in 2012 looking at the use of abiraterone in patients who had already been treated with chemotherapy. Initially NICE said no then too, but it changed its mind and approved use of abiraterone after pricing negotiations with the manufacturer, and reappraisal using criteria that make special allowance for drugs used at the end of life.\n\nAbiraterone is now used as standard treatment for prostate cancer after chemotherapy and has extended the lives of thousands of men in the UK with advanced prostate cancer, with fewer side-effects than chemotherapy. Since then, researchers have been looking at using abiraterone earlier in the course of treatment, without men needing to be treated with toxic chemotherapy first.\n\nProfessor Johann de Bono, Professor of Experimental Cancer Medicine at the ICR and an honorary consultant at The Royal Marsden, led the UK arm of a large study looking at abiraterone treatment before chemotherapy. It was this study that was the basis for NICE’s evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of abiraterone in its appraisal. The trial showed that when the drug was given to men with no or mild symptoms before chemotherapy, it could double the time before tumour progression could be detected by a scan. Men in the abiraterone group also reported less pain than those on placebo. The benefits seen in some men were so impressive that the trial was stopped early so that all men in the study could receive abiraterone.\n\nWhy did NICE turn abiraterone down?\n\nNICE did not recommend abiraterone in this case because the estimated costs of the drug were substantially above the range for which a drug is normally considered cost-effective. NICE did not apply its end-of-life criteria, which are used when assessing treatments for patients with a short life expectancy, simply because men at this earlier stage in their course of treatment tend to live too long. End-of-life criteria are normally applied where patients are expected to live for less than 24 months, whereas in this case the men in question could expect to live at least 30 months.\n\nIt is of course good news that men with prostate cancer are living longer thanks to the advances we are seeing in cancer treatments. We’ve blogged here in the past on the big changes that have been happening in prostate cancer treatment in recent years and the effect they are having on life expectancy. On average, patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with the latest therapies are living with the disease for more than twice as long as they did a decade ago. Here, Professor de Bono who has led a lot of this work tells us more in a video interview.\n\nBut it’s disappointing that abiraterone has been a victim in a sense of these successes in prostate cancer medicine. The evidence is clear that abiraterone is effective when given before chemotherapy and can give men many months of extra life free of disease, with much milder side-effects than conventional chemotherapy. We are very disappointed that NICE has not been able to recommend use of abiraterone in these patients, at least in part because its end-of-life criteria were not met. NICE’s decision is a particular blow for men who are unable to have chemotherapy because they are too old or too frail, since these men – having not been treated with chemotherapy – will now presumably be deemed ineligble for abiraterone too.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAt the moment, this is only a preliminary decision and there is a chance for us to feed our comments into NICE before it finalises its recommendations. We’ll be giving our views as part of the consultation, which is open until 5 June.\n\nWe’ll of course be expressing our disappointment that abiraterone was considered too expensive to be recommended before chemotherapy. But equally, NICE does have a duty to make sure the treatments it approves are cost-effective for the NHS. We will be urging NICE, the NHS and the manufacturer to reach an accommodation as soon as possible on the price of abiraterone, so that the drug can be made more widely available for patients without breaking the bank.\n\nThe committee will meet again to discuss the decision later next month. I’ll be following the twists and turns of the process closely, and will report back here.\n\nScience is great isn't it? Here at The Institute of Cancer Research in London we love nothing more than talking about the amazing work we do. Now some of our researchers are getting the chance to do so with a pint in their hands.\n\nThe Pint of Science festival is in its second year and celebrates the amazing breadth and depth of modern scientific research. The idea behind Pint of Science is simple: invite scientists at the cutting edge of their fields to discuss their work in the relaxed setting of your local pub.\n\nThis is the first time the ICR has been involved with the Pint of Science festival. Two of our leading scientists, Professor Kevin Harrington and Dr Chris Bakal will be at The Albion in the City of London on the 19 and 20 May at 7.30pm, giving the festival audience an insight into their research.\n\nOn Monday 19 May, Professor Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies and Honorary Consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, will be speaking about using viruses to treat cancer.\n\nWhile viruses like the human papillomaviruses (HPV) can cause cancer, it’s only in the past couple of decades that scientists have realised the potential of viruses to treat the disease. Professor Harrington will talk about how viruses can be used to target and kill cancer cells, and improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\n\nThere will also be a talk from Kevin’s team member, surgeon and clinical scientist, Aadil Khan. Mr Khan uses viruses to deliver gene therapy to healthy cells in the body, protecting them from the damaging effects of radiotherapy.\n\nAnd on Tuesday 20 May, Dr Chris Bakal will talk about how he and his team are mapping cancer networks.\n\nThe biological processes that lead to cancer form a complex web of interconnected pathways – understanding these pathways is one of the major challenges in cancer research. Dr Chris Bakal leads the ICR’s Dynamical Cell Systems Team and he’s using mathematical approaches to better understand the biology of cancer.\n\nDr Bakal will show how studying proteins important to cancer could help map the architecture of these cell signalling networks, which could lead to new therapies that are more effective against cancer, and capable of overcoming drug resistance.\n\nThese talks will provide a fascinating insight into some important approaches to understanding and treating cancer. Those who would like to come along and find out more can book your ticket online.\n\nThe Pint of Science Festival begins on Monday the 19th of May in 7 cities up and down the country.\n\nOn Monday night, Professor Kevin Harrington spoke to a busy audience at the Albion pub for the Pint of Science festival, which celebrates the fantastic breadth and depth of modern scientific research.\n\nProfessor Harrington is one of our research team leaders here at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, and he was talking about using viruses to treat cancer – an innovative technique which is delivering amazing benefits to some cancer patients.\n\nIn an entertaining talk, Kevin explained scientists have known for nearly 100 years that viruses can lead to cancer, and as early as the 1880’s, a surgeon called William Coley experimented with bacteria and infectious agents to fight cancer.\n\nColey saw that some cancer patients with infections fared better after surgery than patients without infections, which he thought could be harnessed to form a new type of treatment.\n\nThis early foray into immunotherapy lead to the development of a cancer treatment called Coley’s Toxins, a mixture of bacteria which could boost the patient’s immune system to help fight their disease.\n\nColey’s treatment was used to fight cancer for almost 70 years, and while modern scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness is mixed, it shows it is possible to use the body’s own immune system to fight cancer.\n\nSo how do viruses fight cancer?\n\nAt the ICR, Kevin Harrington and his team are focusing on two viruses that have been engineered to seek out and destroy cancer cells and help recruit the patient’s own immune system to clean up the mess and target other tumour cells.\n\nT-VEC is a genetically modified version of the HSV1 virus, better known as oral herpes. Interestingly, T-VEC was originally developed from a sample supplied by a post-doctoral researcher with a particularly nasty cold sore!\n\nThe T-VEC virus was modified by deleting two important parts of its DNA: deleting a region called ICP34.5 prevented the virus from being able to replicate in healthy cells, while deleting the region ICP47, which normally helps HSV1 hide from the immune system, makes the virus visible to our bodies again.\n\nIn addition, the human gene GM-CSF was added to the virus to enable it to make a protein that potently activates the immune system.\n\nThe result is a virus that selectively replicates in cancer cells, bursting and killing them, which can then be mopped up by our immune system – ingenious, and devastatingly effective.\n\nThe ICR and its partner hospital, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, helped develop T-VEC through phase I and II trials, and the treatment has recently gone through a phase III trial in melanoma patients. Some patients on the trials have been disease free for six years, which could mean their cancer has been cured.\n\nT-VEC must be injected directly into a patient’s tumour to be effective, but another virus being investigated by Kevin’s team could be delivered via the bloodstream like any normal drug. Reolysin is a type of reovirus which exploits a viral mechanism called ‘hitch-hiking’ to pass from white blood cells into tumour cells.\n\nNormally, our cells are protected from reovirus infection by a protein called PKR, which prevents the virus from replicating. But in cancer cells, a signalling protein called Ras blocks PKR activity, allowing the virus to invade tumour cells while healthy cells are protected.\n\nAbnormal Ras activity is common in cancer, so Reolysin could be used to treat a wide range of cancer types.\n\nPreliminary results for both viruses as cancer treatments are promising, but the researchers are also finding the effects of treatment can last long after the virus has disappeared out of the patient’s system.\n\nIn some patients, after treatment, the immune system begins to recognise the cancer cells as being a threat, even when not infected by virus, and it becomes even more vigilant to identify and keep tumours at bay.\n\nThese are just two examples of how viruses can be used to treat cancer, and combining oncolytic viruses with conventional treatments could offer even further benefits, so this novel therapy could be benefiting patients very soon.\n\nCancer cells are really good at staying alive. When most normal cells become irreparably damaged, proteins within the cell and on its surface set into motion a cascade of chemical events that eventually results in programmed cell death, termed apoptosis. Some cancer cells, however, can suffer significant damage to their DNA without this triggering an automated death response.\n\nUnderstanding how cancer cells cheat death can open the door to new ways of combatting the disease, and of making it more sensitive to existing treatments.\n\nThe process by which damaged cells commit suicide is a complex one – involving a network of receptors, proteins and signalling molecules. But it can be broken down to an extrinsic pathway (outside the cell) and an intrinsic pathway (inside the cell).\n\nThe extrinsic pathway to apoptosis starts with the ominously named ‘death receptor’, which sits on the cell surface. When certain signalling molecules bind to this receptor, other proteins are employed to form the even more ominously named ‘death-inducing signal complex’. This then initiates the chemical events that lead to cell death.\n\nBut these receptors don’t work in some cancer cells and stay silent when a chemical signal docks with them. This opens up the opportunity to develop drugs that can somehow ‘switch on’ the death receptors – making cancer cells more susceptible to cell death during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n\nDr Rhoda Molife, a medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust who holds an honorary post here at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, has just published a review with colleagues Drs Khurum Khan and Montserrat Blanco of the clinical progress of apoptosis-inducing therapies for cancer.\n\n“Some of the therapies discussed in our paper are agonistic antibodies, rather than antagonistic. Instead of stopping the death receptor working, they ‘switch on’ the receptor, meaning apoptosis can take place within the cancer cells,” she says.\n\nThe intrinsic pathway is controlled by a delicate balance of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins. In normal cells, this balance is tightly regulated so that apoptosis occurs when it is needed. However, some cancer cells – such as small cell lung cancer or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia – produce more anti-apoptotic proteins than needed. These stop apoptosis from occurring, keeping that cancer cell alive, and contributing to resistance against other anti-cancer treatments.\n\nNew therapies target these anti-apoptotic proteins, allow apoptosis to proceed and ‘sensitise’ cancer cells to radiation or chemotherapy.\n\nDr Molife explains the importance of pro-apoptotic therapy, “What we are trying to do is to tell the body what it should be doing – removing damaged cells. This approach also tends to have a different profile of systemic side-effects from those found with more traditional cytotoxic therapies.”\n\nBut as promising as these new therapies are, Dr Molife and her co-authors argue that the medical community needs to find better ways of using pro-apoptotic therapies.\n\nWhile carrying out a phase I trial of the experimental, pro-apoptotic agent navitoclax (ABT-263) in combination with docetaxel, Dr Molife and her team noticed that it was not clear why patients who derived the most benefit from the combination did so.\n\n“We need to develop the therapies hand in hand with developments in biomarkers which can help predict which patients are likely to benefit from apoptotic therapy. Many of these apoptotic therapies entered the clinic before ‘targeted therapy’ became a buzz phrase, and before the importance of predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers was fully appreciated, so we really need to start finding ways of better designing clinical trials to help find drugs that will help specific patients.”\n\nWe have written before about using combination therapy to target cancer drug resistance, and the development of pro-apoptotic drugs offers new therapeutic combinations that reverse resistance.\n\nBut identifying the patients who would benefit the most from this sort of therapy is important too. By knowing what biological signs to look for, clinicians will be able to give the right treatment to patients – ultimately making the patient’s cancer cells easier to kill.\n\nThe last of the presentations are being given at this year’sAmerican Association for Cancer Research (AACR) conference, and the organisers are preparing to bring one of the biggest events in the cancer calendar to a close for another year.\n\nIt’s time to ask what are the major themes to have emerged from this mammoth event – involving around 18,000 clinicians and scientists from around the globe – and how the discussions here will help shape the cancer research agenda for the months and years to come.\n\n‘Harnessing Breakthroughs – Targeting Cures’ was the strapline for the AACR conference this year – with the focus very strongly on translational research. That’s an area close to our heart here at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, and the backbone of our scientific strategy. Many talks and sessions at the conference this year reflected on the fact that the translation of basic science into clinical advances for the benefit of cancer patients is occurring at an increasing pace and more seamlessly than ever before.\n\nLots of scientists from the ICR were in attendance, and our website last week reported on how their presentations were focusing on finding new, smarter ways of attacking cancer designed specifically to tackle drug resistance – which is probably the most important challenge currently facing cancer researchers and clinicians.\n\nI managed to speak to Dr Marco Gerlinger – head of our Translational Oncogenomics Team who was chairing a session at the AACR – to find out what he took back from the conference. “Optimising personalised medicine and developing effective treatment strategies were the big topics this year,” says Dr Gerlinger. “This is mainly being driven by two things. One is through the advances in genomic techniques, which are providing increasingly detailed insights into the genetic drivers of cancer and the evolution of acquired drug resistance. The second is patient-derived cancer cells, which are allowing the rapid preclinical testing of new drug combinations – a strategy that can be used to overcome drug resistance. I think this integration of genomics with functional models is extremely powerful, and we should soon see a number of new exciting clinical trials testing these drug combinations.”\n\nDiscussion surrounding tumour heterogeneity and its clinical impact was a hot topic at the AACR, as it has been at a number of recent conferences, and Dr Gerlinger was asked to chair a session on 'tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution’. He told me: “New data are emerging that show genetic heterogeneity is far more common that we thought, and is present in acute myeloid leukaemia, glioblastoma, and lung, breast, and head and neck cancers. Because of this, we need to start looking at heterogeneity much more closely, so we can try to understand the processes and rules governing cancer evolution. Once we get a firmer understanding on this, we can begin to integrate heterogeneity assessments into personalised therapy strategies. It's also becoming clear that cancer genomic landscapes of heterogeneous and evolving cancers can change quite dramatically during treatment. There seems to be an increasing consensus that we need to re-biopsy tumours before every new line of treatment if we want to make treatment personalisation a reality.”\n\nOne of the aims of the AACR is to provide a unique opportunity for members of the world-wide cancer research community to learn about cutting-edge advances, obtain feedback on their own research, and make connections that will foster future collaborations. Our Deputy Chief Executive – Professor Paul Workman – took time out of his busy schedule to expand on how this works: “This is a fantastic concentration of cancer scientists who are coming together to discuss world-leading cancer research. With around 18,000 attendees, the atmosphere has a real buzz about it. As well as listening to, and delivering great presentations, we have invested a lot of time meeting other scientists, exchanging information, and are setting-up new collaborations, as well as maintaining our ongoing collaborations. We are discussing ideas with a lot of academic scientists and also many companies, meaning that we can speed up scientific advances, and achieve patient benefit more quickly.”\n\nThe AACR meeting has once again offered a fantastic opportunity for the brilliant minds in cancer research not only to showcase their work, but to learn from each other. There’s no doubt that tumour heterogeneity and drug resistance are important problems that need to be solved – but reading some of the exciting science coming out of this year’s meeting, it’s equally clear that researchers at the ICR and around the world are up to the challenge.\n\nLast week I attended an event looking at how gene testing can help people with cancer and their families. Representatives from a range of cancer charities and support groups joined a discussion about the future of gene testing with leading researchers and clinicians. I wanted to share with you some of the main messages which I took from the event as an attendee.\n\nThe afternoon featured a fascinating talk from Professor Nazneen Rahman, Head of the Division of Genetics and Epidemiology here at The Institute of Cancer Research in London and also Head of Cancer Genetics at our partner hospital, The Royal Marsden.\n\nProfessor Rahman began by talking about why and how we do testing for cancer predisposition genes in the NHS at the moment.\n\nShe explained that testing for gene mutations that increase the risk of cancer in the unaffected relatives of cancer patients can help in reducing their risk, with the possibility of preventative measures like surgery in some cases.\n\nBut Professor Rahman also stressed the importance of gene testing in cancer patients themselves. Learning that a cancer patient had inherited a predisposition gene mutation could help clinicians in arriving at a diagnosis and prognosis, help shape treatment and follow-up, and open up management options for reducing the risk of a subsequent cancer. Finding out that a patient has not inherited a predisposition gene mutation could also be very useful in their management.\n\nOne point Professor Rahman made very strongly was that the current system had been developed to meet the needs of the unaffected family members of patients with cancer, rather than the cancer patients themselves. And that meant the NHS was failing to make optimal use of gene testing in improving cancer care.\n\nResearchers have discovered more than 100 cancer predisposition genes with clinical use, most famously the BRCA genes which predict risk of breast and ovarian cancer. They made the headlines last year when Angelia Jolie announced she had had a double mastectomy to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer after discovering she had a BRCA1 gene mutation which increased her risk.\n\nThe NHS currently has gene tests for about half of these cancer susceptibility genes, but the provision of testing is patchy and inequitable. Gene testing had been treated as something of a luxury, Professor Rahman said, and was largely restricted to people who asked for it.\n\nMuch of the problem centres on the entry point for gene testing, which has tended to be through patients concerned about a family history of cancer, rather than testing all patients who actually have the disease. The NHS has complex eligibility criteria to determine if a patient’s family history is sufficiently strong to warrant testing.\n\nLast year, Professor Rahman commented on NICE’s new national guidelines on familial breast cancer, which found it cost effective to widen out access to BRCA testing even further, but warned that doing so would run up against limitations in NHS capacity.\n\nSo what are the bottlenecks in getting gene tests to more patients?\n\nConcerns over whether the NHS could routinely deliver such large scale testing are being addressed by modern technologies and programmes such as the Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics Programme. The programme is using new DNA sequencing technologies to deliver a faster and cheaper gene test to analyse the genetic information relevant to cancer, and to facilitate making this a routine part of cancer patient care.\n\nOne of the major bottlenecks the programme is looking at is the delivery model of gene testing.\n\nCurrently gene testing is carried out by clinical geneticists, but Professor Rahman talked of a new ‘oncogenetic’ gene testing model, piloted at The Royal Marsden, which allows approved members of the cancer team to order gene tests directly. The oncogenetic model retains the flexibility to allow referral to genetics at any time, should further discussions be required. You can read more about this new model in this blog post from the MCG team.\n\nThis oncogenetic model is faster and more effective for the NHS than the current gene testing processes, and allows more patients to benefit from gene testing.\n\nThe eventual aim of the programme is to develop a framework for every cancer patient to have access to genetic testing. I found the event a really insightful introduction to how this might be done, and I will watch this programme with interest to see what happens in the future.\n\nThe ‘How Gene Testing Can Help People With Cancer - A Consultation with UK Cancer Charities’ event was organised by the ‘Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics Programme’ team at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), and Genetic Alliance UK - a national charity working to improve the lives of patients and families affected by genetic conditions.\n\nHow should the scientific advances we have made in genomics shape the way that care to patients is delivered? That’s the subject of a new review which in particular discusses the role of nurses in making genomic medicine a reality for patients.\n\nGenomics coupled with patient care has become a hot topic, and looks certain to bring about a revolution in the way healthcare is delivered. Having a detailed understanding of an individual’s genetic make-up will not only enable screening and prevention measures to be targeted at those who need it most, but it will also improve diagnostics and treatments. This ‘personalised medicine’ approach to healthcare should move genetics from being in a specialist area into something that is a routine part of the care pathway.\n\nNurses have a fundamental role in healthcare, and empowering and educating patients is just one aspect. Being a potential patient, I know I would rely on my nurse for additional information into the background of my disease -- if only because I tend to find them more approachable than my GP. I also know I would be asking ‘why is this happening to me?’, ‘can I pass this on to my children?’, and ‘what tests and treatments are available?’ But when it comes down to the genetics and genomics of a disease, most nurses have received minimal education.\n\nDr Liz Bancroft is a registered nurse at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and a researcher within Professor Ros Eeles’s Oncogenetics team at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, so she’s in a good position to assess how best genomics can be brought into the heart of healthcare. Currently working in a clinic where she sees men with a family history of prostate cancer, she talks to them about their genetic risk based on current knowledge. She has written a review on how advances in genomics will, and already are changing patient care, and how nurses from every speciality will need a basic understanding of genetics to deliver optimal care to their patients. Dr Bancroft says: “Nurses need adequate training not only in the science behind genetics, but also in communicating this information to the public in an accessible and useful way. There appears to be a common misconception that genetic information is set in stone and your fate is determined by your DNA. But we now know that for certain diseases such as cancer, there are complex interactions between genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, and nurses will need to understand this interplay when they assist with the interpretation of an individual’s risk of disease. Providing information and counselling, support and follow-up of people undergoing genetic testing, and assisting in the interpretation of test results will also be needed, so nurses should fully understand the implications of any test results.”\n\nSo how can nurses -- who are in a unique position to assist the integration of genetics into everyday practice -- be equipped with the knowledge they need to do their job? Dr Bancroft says: “There are now guidelines for genetics education and competencies in place, and also useful online teaching modules. The Department of Health also recognises that all nurses must be competent in delivering genomic healthcare, and that professional leaders should be prioritising the incorporation of genomics into education and practise. But despite these valiant efforts, genetic and genomic education is still lacking within nursing curricula internationally.”\n\nWe are discovering amazing insights into genomics at a breathtaking pace. However, exciting though new research into the effect of gene variants on cancer risk undoubtedly is, its implications for patients are complex and not always obvious. It’s encouraging that the education of frontline NHS staff is beginning to take into account our new knowledge about cancer genes – as a key step to embedding it into routine clinical practice.\n\nThe field of targeted personalised medicine is maturing, driven by the response to recent challenges -- including a new wave of big data.\n\nOne of the most important developments in cancer treatment in the past couple of decades has been the introduction of targeted treatments, enabled by a growing understanding of the gene mutations that transform healthy cells into cancers. Designed to attack the products of these rogue genes -- the protein drivers of cancer growth -- the targeted treatments that are now benefiting patients are often more effective than traditional chemotherapeutics and much less toxic, because they home in on the disease cells while sparing more of the healthy ones.\n\nBut defeating a disease like cancer was never going to be quite as simple as that. Fantastic fighters though our first generation of targeted treatments are, cancer is a formidable foe and there remain some major challenges for researchers. Professor Paul Workman and Dr Bissan Al-Lazikani from the Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit here at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, recently assessed these challenges in the leading journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery and suggested some solutions to the big data challenge based on their own research.\n\nThe biggest challenge highlighted in their analysis is the sheer number and diversity of genes involved both within and between cancers. The large number of as yet undrugged cancer genes leads to difficulty in prioritising these for drug discovery. Furthermore, the diversity of cancer genes leads to the development of drug resistance: the treatment drives the cancer into remission, but over time the disease begins to return as the drug becomes ineffective against it. Target just one mutation and the chances are that it will not be carried by every cell in the tumour, so some will slip through the net. In addition, tumours can evolve during treatment such that the genes that are driving the cancer can change -- and so will require alternative treatments.\n\nWhen the first targeted treatments were being developed, our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity both between and within tumours was still very patchy, and it was also difficult to determine which mutations carried by cancer cells were driving the disease and which were random harmless passengers picked up during its development. This incomplete picture of the biology of the tumour meant that our early targeted treatments were often opportunistic pursuits of the few insights into the working of the cancer cell that we did already possess.\n\nPaul and Bissan argue that we are now in a good position to solve these problems, by building a much more complete picture not only of how cancer cells work, but also of which cancer genes should be targeted for maximum benefit. In the past decade, large-scale projects have produced mountains of data on the biology of cancer cells. This is especially true in genomics, where projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) are working towards sequencing the genomes of tens of thousands of tumours from dozens of different cancer types. This deluge of data is full of signs pointing to the next targets for drug discovery and to strategies for pre-empting and overcoming drug resistance. The amount of data way outstrips that which has been collected in the lifetime of the Hubble Space Telescope. But it creates a new problem of its own: how to sift through all the data, find the needles in the haystack, and prioritise the best potential targets -- especially those targets that could be attacked in targeted combinations to tackle tumour heterogeneity and drug resistance.\n\nTheir answer to this challenge is CanSAR, the vast database developed by Bissan's team here at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). With a powerful search interface that taps into intelligent tools for cross-referencing results from across the different fields of cancer research, CanSAR can highlight the most promising genes to target.\n\nUsing CanSAR, Bissan, Paul and their colleagues have already drawn up a shortlist of candidates. To do this they first narrowed down from the initial list of hundreds of known cancer genes to focus on those genes are found to be mutated in cancers again and again, by several different big genome data studies like TCGA and ICGC, in large numbers of patients and in multiple types of cancer.\n\nWith the resulting shortlist of 58 genes, Paul and Bissan used CanSAR to combine and analyse all available information from genetics, cell biology, chemistry, structural biology and pharmacology studies -- using both past laboratory research and computer projections to assess “druggability” -- that is, how practical it would be to design a small molecule drug acting on the protein product of the cancer driver genes. The key unique feature of the ICR team’s approach is to provide a computer-based look that is multidimensional, multidisciplinary and comparative across all the data, rather than just focusing on any one gene and any one type of data, such as the genetics. This can give a much better picture of which genes to focus our drug discovery efforts on.\n\nAnd by looking at the bigger picture of groups of genes linked to cancer, we can begin to see the patterns of how cancer genes conspire together in functional networks -- ones that not only create and support advanced cancer but also allow resistance to develop. Analyzing networks rather than individual genes should help us to prioritize drug targets -- or existing drugs -- that will work best in the sort of clever drug combinations that will be needed to overcome resistance and defeat cancer. This network analysis feature and others have been enhanced in the latest version 2 release of CanSAR, recently released as a tool for the whole research community.\n\nDriven by the new big data, the discovery of targeted treatments is now entering a second phase of maturity. Intelligent tools like CanSAR light the way and help us map the paths ahead.\n\nWe wrote in this blog a few weeks ago about Dr Nicholas Turner’s call for researchers to meet the challenge of triple-negative breast cancer -- the most hard-to-treat type with the worst outlook for women. Dr Turner has expanded on that theme -- along with Dr Jorge Reis-Filho, a former colleague here at The Institute of Cancer Research, London -- in a new review. It makes fascinating reading.\n\nBreast cancers are usually grouped on the basis of whether the cancer cells express one of three receptors -- human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor. Breast cancer cells that have none of these hormone receptors are classified as triple-negative.\n\nOnly focused on relatively recently, it turns out that triple-negative breast cancers account for around 15% of breast cancer cases. Studies also show that triple-negative cancers are more likely to spread beyond the breast and to recur after treatment than other forms. Following surgery to remove the cancer, chemotherapy is currently the best treatment option and is usually given in combination. But although adjuvant chemotherapy reduces the relative risk of death by approximately 30%, there still isn’t a particular chemotherapy combination that doctors recommend.\n\nDr Turner says improvements in hormone positive breast cancer treatments have come on over the last five years owing to the progress made with targeted therapies. But improvements in survival for patients with triple-negative breast cancer have plateaued because of the absence of promising systemic therapies, and disappointingly, there are no current treatments in late-stage clinical trials for this type of breast cancer.\n\nSo how can we kick start the progress that has halted over the last couple of years? Dr Turner is suggesting that we combine traditional research approaches, such as pathological classification, with more focus on a deeper understanding of the genetic profiles of individual cancers. As I learned more about the molecular diversity of triple-negative breast cancer, I realised that researchers have a real challenge on their hands when it comes to classifying this form of the disease. Not only does it have at least six gene expression subtypes, there are also multiple genetic drivers to consider, such as mutations, deletions or amplifications in genes including TP53, PTEN and MYC. This becomes even more complex when researchers are revealing that there are associations between gene expression subtypes and genetic drivers – all of which could be targeted by different treatments. Only now are we beginning to realise the high heterogeneity in triple-negative tumours and the major challenge this poses to the development of targeted therapies.\n\nUndaunted, Dr Turner is extremely excited and optimistic about finding new treatments. He believes that we need to bring molecular stratification into the clinic potentially with both genetic and gene expression subtypes. Armed with this knowledge, we will be able to design smarter clinical trials of targeted treatments, picking out the most appropriate therapy for each individual patient.\n\nThis Movember let’s not forget the sufferers of the other male cancers, that don’t often manage to share the spotlight with prostate and testicular cancer.\n\nThis month men up and down the country are doing their best to grow moustaches for Movember, the charity which raises funds and awareness for men’s health issues. Movember also funds research conducted here at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, such as Dr Clare Turnbull’s important study identifying new familial genetic causes of testicular cancer. This work will hopefully improve diagnosis and management for patients with the condition, but what about other cancers that afflict men?\n\nCompared with big killers like prostate, lung and bowel cancer, cancer of the penis accounts for just 0.3% of men who develop cancer. Fewer than 550 men are diagnosed with penile cancer in the UK every year, and this rarity means that a urologist may only see one case a year. As a result, little is known about what is the most effective treatment.\n\nThere are very few drugs available to tackle penile cancer, and still one of the most common treatment options is surgery, including amputation; a distressing prospect for any man.\n\nTo find more effective options than surgery, new treatments must be rigorously tested in clinical trials, but for such a rare disease gathering enough patients to perform trials can be a long and laborious process.\n\nBut a penile cancer trial published recently in the British Journal of Cancer, carried out by The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, on behalf of the NCRI Penile Cancer Subgroup, has demonstrated that trials can be run in this rare disease.\n\nIt was the first UK trial for patients with penile cancer in 20 years and was only possible due to a reorganising of cancer services in the UK. On the advice of NICE, ten nationwide supra-regional networks were set up to manage penile cancer treatment; their formation also facilitated efficient collaborative research allowing patients from across the country to participate in the trial. 26 patients were recruited in just over a year; the only other similar sized trial in recent years, conducted in Italy, took eight years to recruit..\n\nThe trial (funded by Cancer Research UK, CRUK/09/001) was testing a type of chemotherapy called TPF, which compliments two chemotherapy drugs with a drug called docetaxel, to see if it could be beneficial to penile cancer patients. At the moment, patients may receive the drugs cisplatin and 5-flurouracil (PF), but there is very little scientific evidence to say if it actually benefits penile cancer patients; in fact, despite the treatment being in use since 1990, its effects have only ever been reported in 19 men.\n\nUnfortunately, the trial found that TPF chemotherapy was not a promising treatment option. While two patients saw their cancers go into remission, only 10 out of 26 patients on the trial displayed a measurable response to TPF (39%) and 19 patients suffered serious side-effects (66%).\n\nAlthough this outcome may seem disappointing, there are positives that can be taken away. For rare cancers like penile cancer, a negative result can be as important as a positive result. It allows researchers to focus on the treatments that are most effective and ensures that the best available evidence guides clinical practice.\n\nThis trial also shows that it’s possible to conduct research into rare cancers quickly and get the evidence needed to make better decisions on medical treatment.\n\nThe NCRI Penile Cancer Subgroup and the ICR Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit are now collaborating on more trials in this disease, including the VinCaP trial (CRUK/12/021), which will investigate the effectiveness of another chemotherapy treatment called vinflunine. A new international trial, InPACT, is also being set-up. Led by the ICR’s Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU) and run under the backing of the International Rare Cancers Initiative, it is hoping to recruit 400 penile cancer patients from the UK, Europe and US for the largest penile cancer trial ever.\n\nThe study will examine the benefit of standard treatments for penile cancer, providing an evidence basis on which to test newer interventions, including the place of targeted therapy in penile cancer management. So there’s plenty of hope that this rare cancer will see better treatments coming soon.\n\nWe’ve made major progress tailoring treatments to genetic sub-types of breast cancer – but the next big challenge will be to drive up survival rates for triple-negative tumours, and that’s going to need the targeting of lots of different genes.\n\nThat was the message yesterday from Dr Nicholas Turner, Team Leader at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and an Honorary Consultant at The Royal Marsden, in his talk at the NCRI conference in Liverpool.\n\nDr Turner described the substantial progress that researchers have made in getting new targeted breast cancer treatments into clinical trials for certain types of breast cancer. But he had a strong message about the need for new models of clinical research for patients with the triple-negative form of breast cancer, which has proved particularly tough to treat.\n\nBreast cancers have traditionally been categorised into sub-types based on whether the cancer cells express certain hormone receptors such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and oestrogen receptor (ER). This information can be used to prescribe treatments which target these receptors on the tumours. A well-known example is the drug Herceptin, which is used on tumour cells which express a lot of HER2 protein. Cells which have none of these receptors are classed as triple-negative breast cancers, and patients with this form of the disease have the worst outcomes.\n\nIn more recent years, researchers have moved beyond this classification system, to also classify tumours based on their genetic cause, and to develop targeted treatments against the specific cancer causing genetic alterations seen in an individual tumour.\n\nTargeted treatments\n\nDr Turner described a selection of the more common mutations found in breast cancers and recent progress in patients using drugs targeting these specific mutation. One example he described was a mutation found in around 40% breast cancers, in a gene coding for an important subunit of a protein called PI3K. Clinical trials of drugs which inhibit this protein are showing positive early results in patients with breast cancer. Dr Turner showed other areas of research where we are making good progress in getting new therapeutics into clinical trials.\n\nBringing targeted treatments to triple-negative breast cancer\n\nBut he also warned that there were only a few of these really common mutations in breast tumours, and that further progress was going to rely on targeting of genes implicated in only a few per cent of cancers.\n\nResearch into the genetic profiles of triple-negative tumours has identified several common genetic alterations which are common in triple negative tumours, for example mutations in the p53 gene and amplification of another known cancer causing gene, MYC. However, as yet we haven’t been able to develop drugs which target either of these genes or their products.\n\nWhat I found most interesting was that Dr Turner explained that the current approach we use for clinical trials doesn’t work well enough when it comes to triple-negative breast cancers. He said we need to be using sequencing technologies to screen for all cancer-causing mutations, identifying the most relevant mutations in individual cancers, and directing patients into clinical trials that specifically target these mutations.\n\nIt’s worth bearing in mind that so many women get breast cancer each year (around 50,000) that a mutation implicated in 2% of patients is still found in 1,000 people a year – more than the total number affected by many cancer types.\n\nDr Turner urged researchers to use the experience of stratifying and treating patients according to the more common subtypes of cancer, and apply this knowledge to the rarer causes of breast cancer.\n\nBy incorporating this strategy into our trial design, we can identify the most appropriate treatments for patients, and hopefully make progress into this most difficult breast cancer subtype.\n\nLast week, Breast Cancer Campaign ran a press briefing about their new Gap analysis, a study that aims to shine a light on the biggest gaps in breast cancer research and treatment in the UK. At the briefing, Professor Sue Eccles from The Institute of Cancer Research, London -- who had the task of pulling together the submissions of more than 80 leading UK experts for the analysis -- shared a platform with the University of Dundee’s Professor Alistair Thompson and Breast Cancer Campaign’s Chief Executive Baroness Delyth Morgan.\n\nThe analysis, published today in the journal Breast Cancer Research, lays out ten priorities which research institutions, funders and policy makers need to address urgently -- if they don’t, Breast Cancer Campaign says, 185,000 lives could be needlessly lost to breast cancer by 2030. I was already familiar with some of the priorities, such as the need to better understand cancers at the genetic level, but others were new to me.\n\nOne major point that Professors Eccles and Thompson kept returning to was the urgent need for scientists to be able to get hold of samples, or biopsies, from cancers which have spread to new parts of the body -- such as the bones, liver or brain.\n\nCurrently, the researchers pointed out, only one tumour sample is taken from breast cancer patients, from the original tumour. If the biopsy shows that, for example, a patient has ER positive cancer, which uses hormones to grow, they could be offered hormone therapy. Or if the tumour sample tests HER2 positive, patients could be offered trastuzumab (Herceptin).\n\nBut cancers often find a way to mutate, evade first-line treatments, and spread throughout the body. Secondary cancers are often different from the primary cancer, which is why they can be very difficult to treat. But even if a secondary cancer does not respond to the usual breast cancer drugs, there could still be an existing cancer drug that will work – but we will only know the right drugs to use by taking a biopsy.\n\nProfessor Thompson pointed to a very powerful statistic: one in six women with secondary tumours could benefit from an existing treatment when first-line treatments have failed. That means that a second biopsy could be the difference between life and death in thousands of women.\n\nProfessor Eccles compared treating cancer to shooting at a target: we need the right sort of bullet for each different type of breast cancer. “Until you know what you're shooting at, you don’t know what the right bullet is,” she said. A secondary sample would give us effective bullets for a huge number of patients. It could also save a lot of money currently spent on therapies which we would know were likely to fail -- money which could be invested in more research.\n\nA second biopsy from a secondary site could also make a huge difference in our understanding of how cancers which started in the breast mutate and metastasise, and could lead to new treatments to tackle treatment-resistant cancer. Although clinicians are understandably concerned about the risks associated with a second biopsy, without it we simply don’t know which treatments could be saving patients’ lives, and doctors are often left shooting in the dark.\n\nWill we win the battle against cancer by finding a cure? It’s the time-old question for cancer researchers, posed most recently by an excellent article in the Observer on drug resistance in cancer treatment that quoted three of our scientists here at The Institute of Cancer Research, London.\n\nIt’s a really interesting piece and I do recommend that you read it if you are interested in the latest thinking on how best to treat cancer. The article tells the story of cancer drug resistance really nicely, and how genetic differences between different cells within a tumour can lead to cancers recurring when drug-resistant cells re-establish the tumour after an initial treatment response.\n\nThe article also raises a point which I am keen to talk more about"
