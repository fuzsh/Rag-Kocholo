I am currently under doctors care and lost my job in between treatments. I was in need of assistance with my monthly bills as to try and stay current. Special shout out to L. Tauriainen at BSW Irving,Tx who reached out to Women‚Äôs Rock on my behalf. When I tell you they were supportive, understanding, timely and very generous believe me! It‚Äôs comforting knowing there‚Äôs agencies out there that really care. I am so relieved and can now focus more on my self care! I appreciate the assistance, kindness and quick turnaround. Keep RockinüôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nNina Titus\n\nWomen Rock is a great organization! They assisted me with my bills which helped me tremendously. They are quick to respond too. I heard back from them the same week that I applied for assistance. Women Rock really does \"rock\"!\n\nLaTisha Lewellen-Hernandez (Tisha)\n\nVery helpful\n\nPat Brady\n\nAs a 6 year survivor, Women Rock still continues to support me with the opportunity to network with others and discuss the ongoing effects of being a cancer survivor. From day one LuAnn has been available for questions and just to help with my concerns. WR provided some much needed financial assistance during my initial treatment. Although I would never wish breast cancer on anyone, I feel blessed to have the opportunity to participate in Women Rock.\n\nJenel McGrath\n\nBeing a part of Women Rock Inc has been a hope of mine for a number of years. I finally was able to open my work schedule & join the Board.i am so grateful for the welcome I‚Äôve rec‚Äôd! The Pink Sisters are a true inspiration of strength and love. LuAnn is the most amazing leader and inspiration to all of us and I‚Äôm honored to be a part of this powerful group of womenüë©üèª‚Äçüé§üíïüë©üèª‚Äçüé§üíï\n\nButch Baker\n\nMark & LuAnn are the best. LuAnn is the most compassionate lady I know. She always goes above & beyond to make sure each lady is taken care of. Debbie Baker\n\nAngela Ingram\n\nWomen Rock is an amazing group! They help local breast cancer survivors cope with the difficulties in their breast cancer journey, whether it's emotional support or financial support.\n\nPamela Hicks\n\nMs. LuAnn and the Women Rock are awesome. Upon receiving my diagnosis and knowing as long as I'm not driving I would not receive any income, I needed rental assistance. They helped with assistance as promised in a very timely fashion. They live up to the term \"Rock.\" They really really do. Thank you all so so much. Words cannot truly express how much I'm grateful for you all."
