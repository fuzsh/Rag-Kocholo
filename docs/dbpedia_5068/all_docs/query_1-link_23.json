        "text": "Nearly one out of every eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.\n\nAlthough breast cancer is most common in women over 40, it can affect anyone at any age. At BCFO, we know that the fight against breast cancer is never easy, taking a toll on family, friends, and loved ones.\n\nBefore 2000, no breast cancer organization worked exclusively in the Ozarks to provide direct financial assistance to patients in treatment for breast cancer. When established, Breast Cancer Foundation of the Ozarks sought to fulfill this role to ensure that local charitable contributions would impact the local community.\n\nIn 2005, BCFO expanded this mission by partnering with local hospitals and health organizations to improve breast cancer screening rates. Since then, BCFO has provided free screening mammograms to the uninsured and underinsured. Additionally, we provide local breast cancer patients and survivors with emotional support through a support group and the mentoring program.\n\nHave you been diagnosed with breast cancer?

Are you struggling to pay for lymphedema garments? Click HERE for an application.\n\nBreast Cancer Foundation of the Ozarks is a local 501(c) 3 not-for-profit organization. BCFO reaches out to friends and neighbors who have been affected by breast cancer. BCFO offers personal support and comfort in real and practical ways, providing support networks, mentoring programs, a full range of resources regarding breast cancer awareness, diagnosis and treatment, where to find related community services, and more."
