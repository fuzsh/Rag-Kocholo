        "text": "About 20% of breast cancers are believed, at this time, to be connected to an inherited alteration in DNA. In families with an inherited alteration of DNA, multiple generations of people may have breast and related cancers. The best-known examples of inherited alterations are BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nKnowledge about inherited breast cancers is changing quickly. Today, what doctors and researchers are telling patients is based on what they know so far, but it is important to check back in with providers and specialty genetics clinics every few years to learn about updates. So, for example, laboratories used to test just at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes when investigating whether a patient had increased elevated risk for breast cancer. Now, in 2020, laboratories are looking at 30 genes - including the ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2 genes.\n\nAs personalized approaches to cancer treatment evolve, efforts are also being made to link specific treatments to genetic characteristics of either the tumor itself or of the inherited mutations that gave rise to the cancer. So far, targeted treatments have been developed for a few of the many identified alterations; in these cases, there are improved odds that the cancer will respond to treatment. Universities and pharmaceutical companies are investing substantially in ongoing research, aimed at finding not only more targeted therapies but more effective ones.\n\nWe included experiences of people with inherited breast cancer or increased genetic risk for breast cancer in the qualitative research study described on this website because inherited breast cancer, like Lynch syndrome and polyposis syndromes, is distinctive in a few ways. They are conditions for which our knowledge is constantly changing over time as more is learned about genomic testing, inherited disease risk and the possibility of individualizing testing and treatment (this is sometimes called “precision medicine”).\n\nAs understanding about the genetics of these disorders evolves, people often find that:\n\nTheir predicted risk for future cancers may change over time (e.g., lifetime risk for cancers associated with a particular mutation turns out to be less than it was initially thought to be),\n\nThe number of gene mutations associated with each of these conditions/syndromes increases over time,\n\nHereditary cancer risks are increasingly identified through tumor typing (testing of tumor/cancer tissue) and not only by genetic screening (blood testing),\n\nAnswers to current questions about hereditary risks lead to more new questions that will require continued research\n\nGuidelines for management of these syndromes are constantly being revised to keep up with new medical knowledge, so it is important to keep in touch with healthcare professionals.\n\nHereditary breast cancer shares these features with other cancer risks inherited through families. It differs in some other ways, each of which can significantly impact patient experience.\n\nMore-Known and Less-Known Mutations\n\nMutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are among the earliest identified mutations related to cancer risk, and remain the most widely recognized by the public. While each is associated with multiple forms of cancer, each has a particularly strong association with breast cancer.\n\nMutations in the BRCA gene were identified several decades ago, but genetic tests have continually improved. Early tests for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes only screened for a handful of genetic variants. People we interviewed who had had genetic testing long ago described how the knowledge they were able to gain from those results was incomplete. When Sarah was tested in 2012, for example, what she learned felt incomplete. “They tested for 15 markers,” she says, “They were all negative …. it's almost like it didn't mean anything.” When Desiree was tested 15 years ago, genetic screening was sufficiently expensive, so her insurance screened for only a few variants.\n\nAlthough information about BRCA mutations can be incomplete, people identified with them may have greater awareness of their genetic risk than people with more recently identified mutations.\n\nInherited Breast Cancer Risks and Genetically-Targeted Treatment\n\nA number of new therapies have emerged for breast cancer that are targeted to particular genetic mutations - including treatments for metastatic cancer which had previously been considered ‘untreatable’. Clinical advances like these bring great hope to people who face inherited cancer risks. But the contrast between these emerging genetically-targeted treatments and the persisting unknowns about the origins and implications of hereditary breast cancer risks can also feel quite poignant.\n\nDiffering Perceptions of Breast Cancer Risk among Men and Women\n\nMost people think about women when they think about breast cancer. This association is made stronger by advocacy campaigns linking breast cancer to pink ribbons and pink outfits, which, as one of our interviewees put it, communicates “feminine energy” and “feminine symbolism”. Our participants also noted that the connection between women and breast cancer create some misimpressions; One being that only women – and not men – can get breast cancer. As Lisa J. put it, “I've had men say, men can't get breast cancer, and it's like, yes, you can. You have breasts. You have a mom. She could have passed the BRCA gene to you, because you can get it.” Another is that hereditary breast cancer risk can only be passed through the mother’s side of the family. In Amy’s words, “You know, this isn’t right. There's a chance, a 50% chance that if my dad has it, that I have it, doesn't matter if it's maternal or paternal.”\n\nBreast Cancer Risk and Prophylactic Treatment Choices\n\nSome forms of breast cancer are related to estrogen levels. The people identified with these forms of breast cancer are encouraged to take hormone-suppressing medications such as Tamoxifen - whether the person is female or male. This is not unique to hereditary cancers, however because mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes lead to such large increases in cancer risk, those identified with these mutations are routinely prescribed hormone-suppressing medications. Ronnie, for example, noted that prior to her genetic testing she was “having a hard time deciding whether to take tamoxifen or not” given its various side effects. But a positive genetic test made it clear to her that she should go ahead, because “Tamoxifen is one of the few things that actually helps for genetic breast cancer.”\n\nOur module on breast cancer includes a more complete exploration of people’s experiences with Tamoxifen and other treatment medications."
