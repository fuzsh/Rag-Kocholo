        "text": "Established in 1996, Nor-Cal Think Pink is a community effort to promote breast cancer awareness. Early detection is the best defense against breast cancer. When caught and treated early, breast cancer has a 98% cure rate. Breast cancer can strike anytime: young and old, family history or no family history, healthy and unhealthy women. Breast cancer does not discriminate. It is our hope that through advocacy and outreach education with our surrounding Northern California communities (Shasta, Siskiyou, Modoc, Plumas, Tehama, and Trinity Counties), women will recognize the importance of annual mammograms, monthly self breast exams, and other early detection tools. We invite you to join us in our mission by supporting Think Pink and helping to spread the word about the importance of early detection.\n\nIt is the hope of Think Pink to secure donations from local businesses and individuals as well as grant money to continue to educate women and men about the importance of breast cancer awareness, annual mammograms and self breast exams.\n\nThe campaign originated in 1996 in Northern California with three individuals: Dr. Michael Figueroa, Oncologist of Solace Cancer Care (previously Cancer Care Consultants), Carol Lake of the American Cancer Society â€“ Northern California Unit, and Melody Christenson of MD Imaging (and retired from Solace Cancer Care) in Redding, California. The campaign began with just 500 free bags being handed out to the public. Today, up to 40,000 Think Pink Bags and Breast Cancer Awareness Calendars and are distributed to over 30 surrounding communities each year on Think Pink Day!"
