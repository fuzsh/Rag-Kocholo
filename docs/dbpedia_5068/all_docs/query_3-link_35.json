        "text": "Cancer Council Victoria advocates and supports general practitioners to accurately assess patients’ personal and family histories of cancer to identify if they need referral to a Familial Cancer Centre.\n\nPatients who present with a family history can be anxious about what it means to them and may require a different pathway to what they have prepared for. As we know, patients who express concerns that cancer 'runs in their family', may not mean they have a genetic susceptibility to cancer or an altered gene.\n\nIn collaboration with Victorian Familial Cancer Centres, this information aims to provide general practitioners relevant advice on how to risk assess, support, and refer patients onto Familial Cancer Centres. It also contains links to resources to build knowledge and training modules to further develop applicable skills.\n\nWhat you’ll find on this page:\n\nRisk assessing patients with a family history of cancer\n\nNext steps if a patient has an inherited altered cancer gene\n\nFind a Victorian Familial Cancer Centre\n\nOnline training and webinars\n\nOther useful resources and tools\n\nRisk assessing patients with a family history of cancer\n\nIf a patient presents with a family history of cancer, that does not mean they should automatically be referred to a Familial Cancer Centre.\n\nIt's important to assess a patient’s level of risk of an inherited altered gene that increases their susceptibility to cancer.\n\nTo determine a patient’s level of risk, you will need to compile a basic family tree and history of cancer.\n\nOnce a patient’s brief family history has been compiled, please refer to the eviQ GP referral guidelines for cancer genetics assessment to complete a risk assessment.\n\nHere are additional resources to assist with assessing risk:\n\niPrevent tool: an Australian tool designed for self-administration by women and collaborative use with clinicians and is the only tool that links the breast cancer risk assessment directly to the relevant risk management guidelines.\n\nCanRisk Web tool: this online clinical tool can be used to calculate the future risks of developing breast or ovarian cancer using information on family history, lifestyle/hormonal risk factors, rare pathogenic variants in moderate and high-risk breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, common breast/ovarian cancer genetic susceptibility variants (Polygenic Risk Scores) and mammographic density. It can also be used to calculate the likelihood of carrying mutations in the moderate to high-risk genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, CHEK2, BARD1, RAD51C and RAD51D.\n\nBased on the patient’s level of risk, there are different follow up steps to take, for example:\n\nRisk level Follow up support High Refer to a Familial Cancer Centre. See below for a list of centres in Victoria. Moderate Continue to monitor risk regularly and manage according to clinical guidelines. Moderate (Patient has been genetically tested and no altered gene was identified) Access this clinician resource to help explain what they can do in the future.\n\nNext steps if your patient has an inherited altered cancer gene\n\nIf your patient has accessed Familial Cancer Centre services and is identified as having an inherited altered gene, you can access clinician resources to help guide treatment and ongoing risk management and care.\n\nHere are additional resources you can access to support patients with a genetic cancer susceptibility:\n\neviQ Cancer Genetics Patient support resources: fact sheets for specific types of genetic cancers providing general information about: the increased risk of cancer for those with an inherited altered gene; how this risk may be managed; and what this may mean for family members.\n\nNSW Centre for Genetics Education: resources for patients to assist in understanding different aspects of cancer genetic testing, risk management, as well as guidance for talking to their family about genetic information.\n\nFind a Victorian Familial Cancer Centre\n\nPlease note, due to COVID-19, the majority of Familial Cancer Centre consultation appointments are conducted via telehealth.\n\nAustin Health Clinical Genetics Service\n\nParkville Familial Cancer Centre\n\nPeter MacCallum Cancer Centre\n\nThe Royal Melbourne Hospital\n\nMonash Health Familial Cancer Centre\n\nOnline training and webinars\n\nDeveloped by Cancer Council Victoria, Referral to Familial Cancer Centres for assessment of hereditary cancer risk | ThinkGP is an online education module that aims to improve GP understanding about altered genes of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and Lynch syndrome, risk assessing patients and referral to Familial Cancer Centres.\n\nIt is free and practical, and offers RACGP and ACRRM professional development credits.\n\nTime: 1.5 educational activity hours\n\nAccess the ThinkGP training module\n\nOur RACGP CPD accredited webinar Genetic cancer update for general practitioners is also available to view online.\n\nThe webinar is presented by A/Prof Yoland Antil, Medical Oncologist and Genetic Cancer Specialist and Dr Michael Bogwitz, Senior Genetic Counsellor.\n\nIt addresses best practice management for patients with a high-risk familial cancer, including the referral process with genetics centre, as well as how to undertake and record a patient's family history relevant to familial cancer and their level of risk.\n\nView the webinar\n\nOther useful resources and tools\n\nThese additional clinical resources can help general practitioners provide the best support to a patient who may be susceptible of hereditary cancer."
