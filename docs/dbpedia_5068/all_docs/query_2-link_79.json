        "text": "Look for hope this fall coming to Estes Park! Breast cancer families will travel to Estes Park as part of the Little Pink Houses of Hope retreat program. The nonprofit organization provides free week-long vacations for breast cancer patients and their families to give them an opportunity to reconnect and celebrate life in a relaxing environment. Estes Park is the newest location being added to their 22-city schedule.\n\nAs part of the retreat experience, all activities and services are provided free of charge so that families can focus on spending quality time together. The retreat in Estes Park is possible because of the generosity of the local community and in particular, the support of Ponderosa Realty who reached out to secure housing for allthe families attending from their group of owners. “When we heard about the life changing experience that Little Pink provides, we had to get involved! The generosity of our owners has been amazing and we are excited for our company to be a part of such a great experience”, said Ponderosa General Manager Seth Smith.\n\nThroughout the week families will enjoy a variety of activities, including partnering with the YMCA of the Rockies, the Estes Park Rec Center, Wildside 4X4 excursions and more. Local restaurants like Ed’s Cantina, Bird & Jim and Rock Inn at Mountain Tavern are pitching in to support the event by providing meals for the families.\n\n“We love how the local community uses its gifts, talents and resources to support our breast cancer families during this incredibly difficult time while on the cancer journey,” said Little Pink Founder, Jeanine Patten-Coble. “We encourage anyone that might like to get involved and help create an amazing week for families to reach out and become a part of our local Team Pink!”\n\nLittle Pink Houses of Hope was founded by Jeanine Patten-Coble, a breast cancer survivor who started the organization after noticing the gap in services that exists for families of survivors. Little Pink was recently named the 2021 National Breast Cancer Non-Profit of the Year.\n\nTo learn more about Little Pink Houses of Hope and how you can get involved, visit littlepink.org or contact info@littlepink.org\n\nAbout Little Pink Houses of Hope\n\nLittle Pink Houses of Hope is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that exists to help breast cancer survivors and their loved ones laugh, connect, play, and heal in a fun-filled environment designed to make family the priority.
