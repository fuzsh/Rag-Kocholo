        "text": "After having a preventative double mastectomy at the age of 25 and her fallopian tubes and one ovary removed to reduce her risk of cancer six years later, Krystal Barter has gone through more surgeries in her 31 years than most would go through in a lifetime, and had hoped that would be it.\n\nLoading\n\nBut earlier this year, Barter, 35, discovered 60 per cent of her uterus was larger than normal and riddled with endometriosis. She had to have major prolapse surgery involving a full hysterectomy and internal reconstruction.\n\nOpening up about her latest surgery for the first time, the Pink Hope founder told The Goss: \"My uterus was double the size of what it should have been and full of endometriosis.\n\n\"It is very rare for my age and I had everything removed. I have no body parts left that society would deem me to be female.\"\n\nShe said the surgery left her feeling \"depressed\", \"emotionally and physically exhausted\" and \"in pain all of the time\".\n\nBut never one to feel sorry for herself, she is \"starting to feel like herself again\".\n\n\"I feel like I have been given this lemon of a body for a reason,\" she laughed.\n\n\"There has been a few dark moments, but I am alive and people have it far worst. All I need to do is look at my kids [Riley, 13, Jye, 10, Bonnie, 8] and they give me all my strength.\"\n\nOn Monday, Barter will speak at The Australian Consul-General Alastair J. M. Walton event, where she will be surrounded by friends, including model Robyn Lawley and Dr Kristi Funk, who carried out Angelina Jolie's preventative breast cancer surgery.\n\n\"When you openly share so much, I thought I could help a few people, but I could never have dreamed where it has taken me,\" she said.\n\nWhy we will never see the likes of the Brownlows thong dress again\n\nEvery year when the Brownlows and the Dally Ms roll around, mentions and pictures of Tania Buckley's legendary jewel-encrusted thong dress or Rachel McLeod sporting her husband's number 23 in a large, glitter back decal (who says Australians have no culture?) resurface from the murky depths of the internet.\n\nAnd although the noughties were a more questionable time style-wise (will we ever live down cargo pants and velour tracksuits?), it's unlikely such memorable, Australian red carpet moments will happen again. There are a few people to thank/blame â€“ namely Australia's best-known red carpet stylists Donny Galella, Lana Wilkinson and Elliot Garnaut.\n\nBack in the good old days, WAGs might visit a local dressmaker for their gowns, but nowadays they \"work with\" a whole team that includes stylists, designers, and hair and makeup artists to ensure there's not a hair out of place (or a jewel-encrusted thong in sight).\n\nThis year, Galella styled 21 looks for the NRL's night of nights, including what has been deemed as the best-dressed: Tegan Martin in a Malbec-hued, mullet jumpsuit.\n\nBut without him there might have been another unforgettable red carpet moment.\n\n\"There was someone who really wanted to wear something very revealing and very booby,\" Galella told The Goss.\n\nLoading\n\n\"It's both our names that would have been out there on it and I couldn't let it happen.\n\n\"I took a picture of them in [what they wanted] and put it beside a picture of them in the look I chose, and when they saw both side by side they went with my one. A stylist can look at an outfit from an outer perspective, and I'm more conscious of how it will photograph as well.\"\n\nAnd although he doesn't think we will ever see any \"frock horrors\" like we have in the past, he commends those who go it alone, without stylists, and have the confidence to show off their \"individual style\".\n\nWe thought there was no room for extras at the Dally Ms?\n\nLoading\n\nWhen the news broke this week the Burgess brothers would not attend this year's Dally Ms, one of the reasons cited for their absence by the South Sydney Rabbitohs was there wouldn't be room for \"any extras\", while an NRL spokesman said that invites were only issued to \"positional nominees and club captains\".\n\nBoth played down suggestions that the PR-savvy brothers, the NRL's most high-profile players, skipped the event to avoid the hordes of media as they lay low after the lewd video scandal, which Sam Burgess has denied and was cleared of misconduct by the club.\n\nSo why were Miss Universe Australia 2014 and former I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here contestant Martin and her personal trainer beau Blake Worrall Thompson there?\n\nMartin's spokesman confirmed that she has \"no connection to NRL but is always invited\".\n\nIf there was room for Martin, surely they could have made space for the NRL's most famous players and their fashion-forward WAGs?\n\nFairfax Media has asked the NRL for comment."
