        "text": "Increased Screening\n\nWomen should have annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) beginning at age 25–29, depending on family history. At age 30 and beyond, alternate annual mammography and breast MRI every six months, depending on family history.\n\nObtain a clinical breast exam every 6–12 months, starting at age 25 for women and 35 for men.\n\nPractice breast self-awareness, with prompt evaluation of any change, starting at age 18 for women and 35 for men.\n\nMen should have prostate screening with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen test starting at age 40.\n\nObtain annual full-body skin examinations for melanoma, and conduct monthly skin self-examination with prompt evaluation of any changes.\n\nObtain annual pancreatic screening starting at age 40 or 10 years prior to the age of the youngest pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the family, with MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic ultrasound, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c.\n\nRisk-Reducing Surgery\n\nBilateral risk-reducing mastectomy with an option of breast reconstruction\n\nSurgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes at age 35–45, when childbearing is complete\n\nOther Prevention Strategies\n\nTamoxifen and raloxifene, used for five years, may reduce the risk for certain types of breast cancer by up to 50%.\n\nHormonal contraceptive pills following risk-reducing mastectomies may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 60%.\n\nIndividuals should avoid artificial tanning and use broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher, seek shade, cover up with clothing (including hats), and wear UV-blocking sunglasses."
