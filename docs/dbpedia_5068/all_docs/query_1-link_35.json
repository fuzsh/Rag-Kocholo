We provide “totes” with many items needed during treatment along with a monetary donation.\n\nWe have monthly support groups as well as extra activities and functions to keep everyone connected and remain a “family”.\n\nOur job as a project never ends. We are available 24/7, to make sure NO ONE fights alone.\n\nNominate a Fighter:\n\nOur project is 100% DONOR FUNDED. All assistance we give to those in treatment is due to the generosity of our amazing community and family members.\n\nIf you know of someone currently going through breast cancer treatment within the pink shaded area of the map (you may zoom in), please direct them to the nomination form, as it is in our heart to assist all those affected by breast cancer in our local area.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: As we would love to assist everyone, all monies donated are done with the understanding that it is distributed to those fighting breast cancer in our local area.\n\nPPP is not an emergency assistance program and we are unable to provide immediate financial aid. Any and all requests, must be submitted with the online form.\n\n​"
