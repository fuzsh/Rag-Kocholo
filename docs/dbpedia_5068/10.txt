For a growing number of young women such as nineteen-year-old Emma Sinclair, genetic science is revealing a potential killer in their DNA.

Researchers have identified two mutant genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 that give rise to breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.

With five generations of women in her family suffering from breast cancer, Emma was tested for the gene aged 16 and was diagnosed when she finished high school.

Faced with a drastic, but potentially life-saving decision ever since, Emma is preparing to have her breasts removed, it’s just a question of when.

“My great great grand mother died of breast cancer, my great grandmother died of breast cancer my grandma has had a mastectomy and my aunt has had a mastectomy and so has my mother.

"Once I got older and developed boobs and thought well these could kill me,"

Sisters, Laura and Stacey Gadd also inherited the breast cancer gene from their mum. And both have had a double mastectomy aged 22.

More than 12 thousand Australian women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year most will be over 50.
