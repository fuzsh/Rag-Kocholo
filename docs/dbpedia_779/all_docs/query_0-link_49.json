HOROWITZ, EDITORS\n\nAdvisory Board Carolyn Abbate J. M. Bernstein Eve Blau T. J. Clark John Hyman Michael Kelly Paul Kottman In memoriam: Arthur C. Danto Columbia Themes in Philosophy, Social Criticism, and the Arts presents monographs, essay collections, and short books on philosophy and aesthetic theory. It aims to publish books that show the ability of the arts to stimulate critical reflection on modern and contemporary social, political, and cultural life. Art is not now, if it ever was, a realm of human activity independent of the complex realities of social organization and change, political authority and antagonism, cultural domination and resistance. The possibilities of critical thought embedded in the arts are most fruitfully expressed when addressed to readers across the various fields of social and humanistic inquiry. The idea of philosophy in the series title ought to be understood, therefore, to embrace forms of discussion that begin where mere academic expertise exhausts itself; where the rules of social, political, and cultural practice are both affirmed and challenged; and where new thinking takes place. The series does not privilege any particular art, nor does it ask for the arts to be mutually isolated. The series encourages writing from the many fields of thoughtful and critical inquiry.

This book—the culmination of over a decade of research, writing, revision, and discussion—is, if nothing else, a communal effort. And it could not have been otherwise. Indeed, it is a long, winding, and unconventional path that stretches from my dissertation to the publication of this book, and it has ensnared many accomplices along the way. And so I owe a lot of gratitude to a lot of people who, wittingly or not, have played a role in the conception, evolution, and production of this project. As the core foundation of this project dates back to my doctoral research, I’d like to first thank my dissertation advisors at the University of Notre Dame: Karl Ameriks and Fred Rush. I came in yelling “Kant” and came out yelling “Hegel,” so thanks for supporting (or at least tolerating) this conversion. The many drafts you read and commented on; the many hours of consultation you generously gave; and the many, many forms of support provided along the way—deserve more thanks than I can give here. Also in this context I’d like to thank the late Gary Gutting, whose commitment to making philosophy more interesting and relevant for a broader audience has been a positive influence on this project, and on the discipline in general.\n\nx Y Acknowledgments\n\nAnd thanks also to Vittorio Hösle, whose quirky and energetic brilliance introduced me to an exciting world of German scholarship. As far as mentoring goes, Richard Eldridge gets as close to the Platonic form of mentorship as one can get, and for this deserves very special acknowledgment and thanks. I am incredibly grateful for the intellectual guidance and camaraderie that has evolved since that fortuitous encounter in Freiburg years ago. These have proved invaluable to many projects, most especially this one. Thanks, in particular, for encouraging me to write the book that I wanted to write. Du bist ein richtiger Mensch. A number of other brilliant minds have played a major part in the genesis of this book. Special thanks to John Gibson and Keren Gorodeisky for very insightful comments on early drafts of the final chapter. And thanks to Aaron Meskin and James Shelley for hosting the Southern Aesthetics Workshop at Auburn University that made these exchanges possible. Thanks to Jonathan Neufeld for offering loads of helpful feedback along the way, and also for commandeering the Aesthetics Work Group at the College of Charleston, which has been an excellent venue for discussing aesthetics with colleagues and students. Thanks also to Michael Kelly for the many conversations about art and politics that have given shape to this book. And thanks to the American Society for Aesthetics for the many opportunities to present and exchange ideas relevant to this project in a productive and collaborative environment. Still others have played some part in the making of this book, directly or indirectly, whom I’d like to thank: Raymond Geuss, Paul C. Taylor, Crispin Sartwell, Anne Eaton, Grant Kester, Lambert Zuidervaart, Tom Mulherin, and probably many more. This work has also benefitted immensely from conversations with artists and friends: Mel Chin, Helen Nagge, Thomas\n\nAcknowledgments Z xi\n\nWoltz, Günther Schaeffer, Jefferson Pinder, Jacob Brault, Thom Klepach, Walter Early, Dave Teng Olson, Mike and Jake Simmons, and all the fine folks at the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center. I have also had the great fortune of having strong institutional support for my research. A research grant from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) for the opportunity to spend a year immersed in research at Goethe Universität in Frankfurt, and to Prof. Christoph Menke for hosting me. In 2018, the Andrew Glasgow Writing Residency afforded me two precious weeks of focused writing among the lovely folks at the Penland School of Craft. My students—more than they probably realize—have been a central part of this process, both in class and beyond. Thanks to Mina Juhn, Shannon Hebert Waldman, Lukas La Rivière, and Wes Tirey for keeping these conversations alive. And a very special thanks to Sam Morkal-Williams for being an awesome and immensely helpful research assistant, and to Jemma Natanson for swiftness and precision in all the eleventh-hour editorial work. Thanks to present and past colleagues at Rice University, Wellesley College, and Warren Wilson College. Thanks to everyone at Columbia University Press who helped bring this book to light. That includes, first of all, series editors, Gregg Horowitz and Lydia Goehr, for including this work in the “Philosophy, Social Criticism, and the Arts” series. A special thanks to Gregg, who more than anyone has put in the labor to see this thing through, from vision to revisions. Thanks to Wendy Lochner for editorial insight and guidance, and to Lowell Frye for running a tight but generously accommodating ship. Thanks also to Partha Chakrabartty, whose contribution to the book at the final stages go well beyond meticulous\n\nxii Y Acknowledgments\n\ncopyediting. And, of course, thanks to the anonymous reviewers for their excellent and valuable comments on the manuscript. Finally, and most importantly, thanks to my family: Candace, Conley, and Lena. I suppose we all learned the hard way that The Time of Two Toddlers is not the best time to write a book. But it could not have happened without your seemingly infinite reserves of patience, support and encouragement. And so, a special “thank you” is in order to my wife, Candace, to whom I dedicate this book.\n\nTHE POLITICS OF PERCEPTION AND THE AESTHETICS OF SOCIAL CHANGE\n\n1 THE CULTURAL TURN\n\n1.1. DO THE RIGHT THING: AESTHETICS AND THE POLITICS OF PERCEPTION A pivotal scene from the celebrated Spike Lee film, Do the Right Thing, begins like this: A young, charismatic Black activist known as “Buggin’ Out” (brilliantly played by Giancarlo Esposito), having just haggled over the cost of a slice of cheese pizza, is settling into a booth in a Brooklyn pizzeria. Suddenly he pauses, mid-bite, struck by the gaze of portraits featured on the wall next to him. The camera cuts to the wall and we see through Buggin’ Out’s eyes as he scans the rows of black-andwhite photographs: Sylvester Stallone, Joe DiMaggio, Al Pacino, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, and Mario Cuomo, among other Italian-American notables. Above the portrait gallery, in large block lettering, reads: WALL OF FAME. “Yo Mook!” he shouts to Mookie (played by the youthful Lee), the sole Black employee of Sal’s Famous Pizzeria, who is seated a few booths over, wholly consumed in flirtations. “How come you got no brothers up on the wall?” More interested in these pursuits than Buggin’ Out’s sudden pursuit of racial justice, Mookie defers to the boss: “Man, ask Sal.” Sal—visibly\n\n2 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nFIGURE 1.1 “Wall\n\nof Fame” scene, Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing\n\nirritated when the same question is put to him—fires back: “You want brothers up on the wall? Get your own place. You can do what you wanna do. You can put your brothers and uncles, nieces and nephews, your stepfather, stepmother, whoever you want, you see? But this is my pizzeria. American-Italians on the wall only.” And the thing is, in terms of rights, Sal’s not wrong: it is his place. It is Sal’s Famous Pizzeria, which, we come to learn, Sal has owned and operated in Brooklyn’s Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood for some twenty-five years. And so, in this sense, the “Wall of Fame” is his property to do with as he pleases. But, of course, Sal’s is much more than this. It is a social space, a gathering point for patrons. In his more reflective moments, Sal is happy to take ownership of this as well, even priding himself on making Sal’s a fixture of the neighborhood’s social life. But, as he also recognizes, neighborhood demographics have shifted. And it is precisely because of this shift from a\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 3\n\npredominantly Italian-American neighborhood to a predominantly African American and Puerto Rican one that there’s more to Sal’s Famous Pizzeria than just Sal. It’s not just about rights; it’s about representation. It’s about the perception of racial difference in shared spaces. For, as Buggin’ Out urges Sal to observe, Sal’s clientele is predominantly Black. “Rarely do I see any American-Italians eating in here. All I see is Black folks. So since we spend much money here,” he reasons, “we do have some say.” It is at this point that the specter of violence makes its first appearance in the film: the ominous baseball bat. But Sal is quickly subdued and disarmed. And Mookie calmly escorts Buggin’ Out from the restaurant as he protests and calls for a boycott. This violence, momentarily defused, will appear again and again throughout the film and culminate in full-blown chaos. This conflict over the “Wall of Fame” will continue because it has nothing to do with the rights of individuals in a free society and everything to do with how individuals are reflected in the social environments they inhabit. Which is why, as the scene ends, Buggin’ Out hollers out to Mookie one last impassioned directive: “stay Black!” His campaign for social change is, to a large extent, a battle over social perceptions. At once comical and confrontational, the “Wall of Fame” scene provides a glimpse into a fictional microcosm in which such seemingly pedestrian interactions are freighted with social and political significance. At stake in this brief exchange is something that lies well beyond decorative choices, the expression of individual preferences, or even the assertion of legal rights. At stake here is a question of representation, and of how individuals see themselves represented not only at the political level, but also at the social and cultural ones, in the course of ordinary, everyday interactions. It is not so much a matter of the\n\n4 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\npolitical rights and protections that individuals share, but of the differences among individuals and the varying perceptions of these differences. As with any Spike Lee film, Do the Right Thing is a “political” film in the sense that it engages explicitly in a form of identity politics. Typical of Lee’s directorial style, the “Wall of Fame” scene shows how even the most banal situations are saturated with, and structured by, an awareness of racial difference. Sal’s Pizzeria is both a multicultural hub as well as a pressure cooker of racial tensions. It is both private property and public gathering space, a volatile mix of individual and collective interests. It is a political film about race that leaves unanswered the question motivating the entire plot of the film: What is “the right thing?” In this sense, W. J. T. Mitchell is certainly right to read the politics of Do the Right Thing as a critique of the view that equates common spaces with shared spaces. “The Wall is important to Buggin’ Out,” he writes, “because it signifies exclusion from the public sphere.”1 The film is political in the more nuanced sense that it shows how the space of public discourse has been inscribed by dominant perspectives. In terms of political theory, it exposes a major blind spot of democratic theorists such as Jürgen Habermas and others who put faith in the “public sphere” as the great equalizer of social and cultural difference. It shows that politics has as much to do with the exchange of social perceptions as it does rational deliberation. We might even say that the “Wall of Fame” scene offers liberalism a lesson: that the ideals of individuality, universality, shared norms, and common spaces is, and will remain, in conflict with the realities of racial representation and social perception of racial identity. But there is another, equally-significant-but-often-overlooked sense in which the film is political. This has to do with the way this critique is lodged specifically within the medium of film. It\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 5\n\nis a political film, but it is also film as politics. Do the Right Thing— and, indeed, Lee’s entire cinematic oeuvre—is predicated on the recognition that many of today’s social and political struggles are still deeply rooted in the way racial identity is perceived (or misperceived) in public. As a work of cinema, it is engaged with what we might call the politics of perception. For several decades now, critics of liberal politics have been increasingly attuned to the ways that race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other markers of supposedly private interests and identities, nevertheless figure centrally in the various social interactions and institutional arrangements that define the public sphere. But such critics consistently overlook the central role that social perceptions of identity play in contemporary politics. Do the Right Thing disrupts not only the notion of a singular, homogenous public sphere, but also the more fundamental supposition that the sole function of the public sphere (or spheres) is to facilitate rational discourse among equal individuals. The sociopolitical significance of Lee’s film, then, is that it responds to the reality that today’s politics involves the public exchange of perceptions as much as the exchange of reasons, ideas, and interests. Indeed, the “Wall of Fame” scene shows exactly the failure of the liberal trust in the public sphere, as Buggin’ Out’s attempt to make the case for diversifying the “Wall of Fame” is met with the flexing of property rights. The argument that images of Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela, and Michael Jordan also deserve a place on the wall is met with the threat of violence. Reasons are met with a baseball bat. And this failure of deliberative politics is made all the more evident by the fact that the fictional violence depicted in the film spilled off the screen and onto the streets not long after the film’s release.2 In such an environment, where politics is forced out of abstract notions of equality and into the complex and\n\n6 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nfraught perceptions of identity, film (and art more generally) turns out to be a far more significant medium for effecting social change than the traditional channels of public discourse. Put in a current vernacular, Do the Right Thing was showing then what a surge of political protests is trying to show us now, namely, that Black lives matter. Art is also political in the further sense, then, that it does what identity-blind politics can’t or won’t do: it engages in the politics of perception. In Do the Right Thing, this notion of art-as-politics can be seen in the character of Radio Raheem. Shouldering an outsized boombox, the stern and towering figure of Radio Raheem commands equal parts fear, respect, and annoyance as he freely navigates the neighborhood blasting Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power” on repeat. Notably, the song was conceived at Lee’s request for the film, and released concurrently with the film in the summer of 1989, several months prior to the release of Public Enemy’s third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. It furnishes the opening and closing theme song of the film, and features in the film as the source of both Black empowerment and reactive violence. Radio Raheem is the devoted messenger of Public Enemy’s lyrical politics, in which “Fight the Power” functions, as Chuck D puts it, as “a work of art to revolutionize.” At a critical juncture in the film, Radio Raheem joins forces with Buggin’ Out, and “Fight the Power” becomes the anthem for the campaign for racial diversity on the “Wall of Fame.” The baseball bat reappears. Only this time, Sal uses it to smash the boombox to pieces. This dramatic show of force represents not only the destruction of property (a rights transgression), but also the silencing of Black voices. For Radio Raheem, rap music is a way of reclaiming space. And his tragic encounter with violence further confirms the need to vocalize Black interests through nonstandard channels of public discourse. Music, like film and art\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 7\n\nmore generally, is thus made a primary communicative vehicle for engaging in the politics of perception. To engage in these politics, then, is to proceed from what critical race theorist Charles Mills terms the “nonideal” approach to politics, which trades the traditional liberal conception of how things ought to be for a sober assessment of how things actually are.3 This is crucial since (as we’ll see) even some of the more recent and refined conceptions of the public sphere developed as part of a more recent, critical response to Habermas (such as that of Nancy Fraser), maintain a troubling faith in the sovereignty of rational deliberation in contemporary politics. The reality Lee shows us in film is one in which some of the most important issues that belong to public discourse are precisely those that are least likely to prompt the general public to rational reflection. Do the Right Thing shows us that when it comes to the representation of racial identities, there is often no conclusion to be reached; only an attitude, a perception of the other that is itself culturally constructed and unreflectively adopted. The film engages in the politics of perception by asking its audience to perceive race in a certain way, which speaks volumes about both the weakness of traditional politics as well as the political force of art. Importantly, however, there are different ways that art can engage in the politics of perception. Do the Right Thing is political in the obvious sense that it is a critical, if not bluntly confrontational, response to the prevailing narrative of a “postracial” America that began to take hold in the post-Civil Rights era, and was strengthened in the heyday of Reagan-era economic prosperity. Indeed, Lee’s trademark brand of racial realism has been foundational to both the successes and controversies of his prolific career as a director. Such pointed critique, however, should not eclipse the equally important, though\n\n8 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nperhaps less obvious, affirmative dimension of Lee’s cinematic treatment of racial identity. The representation of race in film should be seen as a form of political engagement that not only deconstructs dominant narratives, but also constructs new ones. To engage in the politics of perception, in other words, is to critique the misperception while furnishing the social imagination with alternatives. The movie screen plays a vital role in this regard, as it often provides the imagery of cultural identity, particularly where it remains invisible or distorted in the public imagination. I take it that this is what W. E. B. DuBois has in mind when, in his famous 1926 speech to the NAACP, he calls on artists to imagine “the Negro painted by white Americans in the novels and essays they have written.” He then invites them to “turn it around,” to then imagine what it would mean “to write a story and put in it the kind of people you know and like and imagine.” 4 And I take it that Lee, like many contemporary Black artists, is taking up DuBois’s call to reclaim Black identity through aesthetic representation. Given the force of appearance in contemporary social and political life, film— and, by extension, the arts in general— furnish precisely the kinds of representation that we’ve come to recognize as the chief deficiency of liberalism’s identity-blind politics. Supposing the critical aim of a Spike Lee film is to reveal how the presumably shared space of the public sphere is segregated along racial lines, conjoined with this is the positive task of creating that very space in which underrepresented or misrepresented identities are made to appear. In this respect, the politics of Do the Right Thing expands the overly narrow parameters of the public sphere to include forms of artistic expression in which perceptions of identity are publicly negotiated. In the context of art, sensory perception and emotional response are deployed not as a threat to rational discourse, but as a necessary\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 9\n\nsupplement to, and, at times, a substitute for it. The film brings Black identity into public consciousness through the back door, as it were, in a way that subverts the limited discursive mechanisms of traditional politics. It is not by the exchange of reasoned articulations in the marketplace of ideas that race is thrust into the public sphere, but by Lee’s effective use of cinematic imagery and narrative. It solicits recognition of Black identity, not by pleading with us to take stock of our convictions, to examine their bases, and their internal coherence, but by giving us a story—“an honest, unsentimental story,” as Roger Ebert puts it in his glowing review of the film, “about those who are left behind.”5 Do the Right Thing takes up the politics of appearance at precisely the point where the Enlightenment-era politics of liberalism leaves off: at the limits of discursivity. Beyond its critical agenda, then, the film is political in the broader sense that it takes up the positive task of showing what can’t be articulated in the space of traditional politics, namely, the particular perspective. In this respect, Do the Right Thing is emblematic of the way that art and politics have more generally come to converge on distinctly contemporary notions of cultural identity in recent decades. The familiar legacy of political aesthetics extending from Plato to Schiller to critical theory to poststructuralism is an enduring testament to the ever-evolving dynamic between art and politics. But this tradition of Western philosophical aesthetics has remained stubbornly unresponsive to the kinds of insights DuBois offers on racial aesthetics, not to mention decades of intellectual work in feminist theory, postcolonial studies, queer studies, Latinx and Asian studies, and in other fields, which thematize cultural identity in terms of both political and aesthetic representation. This book aims to address the growing disparity between political and aesthetic theory within\n\n10 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nthat tradition by taking up the question of cultural identity in art and politics. Thus, the central concerns of this book emerge from a particular narrative I describe as the “cultural turn” in art and politics that has taken hold in recent decades. I’ll give a more detailed account of what I mean by this term below, but broadly, what I want to say with the analysis of Do the Right Thing is that it is but one example of a much more general and pervasive trend in recent decades in which both politics and art have been marked by a radical transition in priorities, from abstract representation to the particularity of cultural identity. In politics, the cultural turn is marked by a distinctive shift away from traditional liberalism, with its emphasis on universal, identityblind rights and freedoms, to various forms of cultural politics which recognize cultural identity and multicultural difference as key components of democratic inclusiveness. In contemporary art, the cultural turn is marked by a distinctive shift away from the aesthetic language of abstraction and aesthetic autonomy to the proliferation of artistic practices that aim, in sometimes explicit ways, at aesthetic representation of cultural identity, particularly of the socially and politically marginalized. What follows from this quasi-empirical account of the cultural turn in art and politics, I hope to show, is a fairly robust set of normative claims about the role of art in the cultivation and articulation of a modern sense of self. The cultural turn narrative I offer here, as well as the claims that follow from it, are predicated on the ubiquity of cultural identity today. The once-controversial declaration of a Spike Lee Joint now seems quite familiar: cultural identity matters. It matters to who one is and how one navigates the social world. Of course, “cultural identity” remains a contested term, particularly with respect to difficult questions concerning which features define us and the extent to which they define us. In the context\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 11\n\nof the arguments made throughout this book, having an “identity” is something like having a life narrative, a story that lends coherence to our distinctive sense of self and becomes a framework through which the self is related to others. To own one’s sense of self—to be self-determined—is to be in control of one’s narrative. There will of course be more to say about this narrative view of cultural identity. The main thing for now is to distinguish the particularist way of conceiving identity from the generalist, as this distinction is, in the broadest terms, the basis of the cultural turn. It is a deliberate shift away from the abstract concept of personal identity thematized in the philosophical writings of Descartes and Locke. The important thing is to recognize the extent to which modern conceptions of the self are increasingly articulated in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, and other (often overlapping) markers of distinctive, sometimes highly particularized, forms of individuality. And we can appreciate this development—this resistance to the Enlightenment impulse to erase particularity for a transcendent cosmopolitanism—without necessarily having to specify whether some of these features count more than others in the process of cultivating a sense of self. It is this profound shift in the way we think about subjectivity that underwrites the values assigned to terms such as “diversity” and “difference,” taken to be essential to well-functioning political, social, educational, and market institutions. It is this prioritization of cultural particularity over abstract, anonymous agency that provides the legal rationale for group rights in recent debates over affirmative action, the limits of free speech, or religious exemptions to schooling, and immunization requirements. It also provides the moral rationale for claims of cultural appropriation, criminal justice reform, and hate crime legislation and (in the U.S.) the removal of Confederate monuments from\n\n12 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\npublic spaces. It has manifested in Leftist political movements ranging from the Quebec separatists to the Stonewall Rebellion to Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, and yet has also fueled more regressive forms of so-called “identity politics” in the form of rising nationalism (e.g., white nationalism), cultural purists, anti-immigrant activists, and so on. For better or worse, who one is, individually or collectively, is largely a matter of highly individualized and sometimes fluid, overlapping identities shaped by forces both genetic and environmental. I take it as fairly evident that contemporary consciousness is to a large extent shaped by an awareness of cultural identity. Far more interesting is the extent to which battles over claims of cultural identity have been waged on the cultural front. Contemporary cinema, television, music, literature, performance, dance, not to mention the many and various forms of popular culture, have become a primary site for the communication and contestation of identity. That Kendrick Lamar wins a Pulitzer Prize for a rap album that celebrates “the complexity of modern African-American life” is but one telling indication of this phenomenon.6 The same could be said of any number of rap and hip-hop artists, the films of Jordan Peele or Steve McQueen, the paintings of Kara Walker or Kehinde Wiley, the creative performances of artists such as Adrian Piper, Faith Ringgold, Nick Cave, and so on. It is evident in the distinguished tradition of feminist art extending from Guerrilla Girls to Pussy Riot to the televised adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel Handmaid’s Tale. It is evident in the increased visibility of gay, queer, and trans identities in popular films like Brokeback Mountain, Moonlight, Dallas Buyers’ Club, and in TV shows like The Wire and Orange Is the New Black. And it is evident in the significantly expanded range of aesthetic genres and subgenres introduced to capture the corresponding\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 13\n\ndiversification of identity-based art: African American painting, feminist art, queer film, Latinx art, Native art, and so on. Well beyond Do the Right Thing, the past several decades have been marked by the broad expansion of artworks that critically examine notions of race, ethnicity, gender, faith, sexual orientation, as well as subcategories or intersectional relations among these and other relevant identity categories. The central aim of this book is to reconsider the relation between art and politics in light of this decisive turn to cultural identity in politics and art. Given, on the one hand, a sociopolitical shift that regards the recognition of identity as integral to the achievement of subjectivity, and, on the other, the artistic shift that regards art as a primary medium for the aesthetic representation of identity, I think we have to take seriously the idea that art plays a constitutive role in defining who we are. Throughout, I develop the rather ambitious claim that engagement with art is a primary form of self-constitution. To the extent that determining one’s identity is a matter of authoring one’s own narrative, it is bound up with aesthetic modes of communicating the forms and images comprising that narrative. Most importantly, I argue, aesthetic engagement with art is bound up with selfdetermination in that it affords a certain kind of reflexive experience through which we confront and contend with a perception of the self. We appear to ourselves in works of art in a way that better orients us to a sense of individual and collective identity. One reason for this is that art is and always has been one of the principal mediums through which we see ourselves reflected in our lived social environments. But the more specific claim I want to advance here is that aesthetic engagement becomes particularly relevant to the achievement of selfdetermination in the context of the cultural turn. The cultural turn makes explicit that the full and free development of one’s\n\n14 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nagency depends on the recognition of one’s particular identity. From this condition emerges the politics of perception, whereby the self is regarded, not as the finished product of individual, rational reflection, but as the site of an ongoing process to define one’s identity in relation to the perceptions and attitudes of others. Insofar as contemporary notions of self-determination demand that we orient ourselves with respect to both shared interests and identities as well as forms of cultural difference, art holds a uniquely significant value for us today. Bound up with this thesis is a unique set of questions around which the chapters of this book are organized. If, as I contend, art bears such a significant relation to modern notions of selfdetermination, we also have to ask: How should we rethink liberal notions of agency in terms of identities that are, at least in part, constructed and contested through aesthetic (that is, not strictly rational) processes? How might we understand and evaluate claims of cultural identity that take the aesthetic form of images, narratives, fictional representations, musical styles, performances, and so on? To what extent is the recognition of cultural identity contingent on the perception of otherness, and to what extent do the arts shape such appearances? For that matter, how should we understand the cultural authority of artists who give aesthetic representation to cultural identity, as well as the civic and aesthetic responsibilities that come with such creative practices? Conversely, how should aesthetic theory understand and evaluate the aesthetic merit of such artistically rendered cultural narratives? What is the relation between the political and aesthetic value of art? To address such questions, I draw on what might seem an unlikely resource: nineteenth century philosophical aesthetics. The account I develop here revives a view of art’s relation to modern subjectivity that can be found in the writings of Friedrich\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 15\n\nSchiller and the tradition of early German romantics, but which is carried to fruition in the aesthetic writings of G. W. F. Hegel. The inquiry of this book is motivated by the Hegelian insight that who we are and how we stand in relation to one another is substantially worked out in the arena of artistic expression and aesthetic experience. Even more precisely, it is the view that aesthetic experience involves a form of reflexive self-awareness that is a source of both meaningful aesthetic engagement as well as meaningful cultivation of socially mediated identity. It is, then, a Hegelian formulation of art’s reflexive character that I think explains both the sociopolitical as well as the aesthetic value of much contemporary art: art shows us both the particular element in humanity as well as the human element in particularity. This, I take it, is the guiding insight of Hegel’s aesthetics and the basis of its renewed relevance to the present discourse around representations of cultural identity in both art and politics. Art engages the imagination in a dialectic between the self and the other, the familiar and the unfamiliar. Works of art reveal both the points of fracture in perceptions of the common and the points of connection among irreducible modes of difference. And this movement between specificity and generality, resonance and discord, gives us a way of rethinking not only how we engage with works of art, but also how we orient our identities within a modern social world increasingly defined by difference. At the same time, harvesting this insight for the present requires a degree of revisionism toward Hegel’s philosophy. This means, among other things, a willingness to sacrifice particular historical and philosophical assumptions for a more general appreciation and application of Hegel’s philosophy of art to the cultural turn in contemporary art and politics. It is worth saying at the outset, then, that while this book both draws on and contributes to the efforts of several recent monographs which\n\n16 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nchampion a renaissance of Hegelian aesthetics in the context of modern art,7 it is decidedly not a standard monograph on Hegel’s philosophy. The argument engages deeply with Hegel’s writing on art, particularly in its extensive engagement with the threevolume Lectures on Aesthetics (Vorlesungen über die Äesthetik). But rather than defend the views of Hegel to the letter, my aim is to cultivate the insights of Hegelian aesthetics to get a better handle on the role that art plays in modern life. I am happy to trade textual fidelity for contemporary relevance if that means connecting with a broader discussion of contemporary art and its relation to contemporary politics. In reviving (and substantially revising) a set of claims central to Hegelian aesthetics, this book aims to engage a broad audience for whom these questions are or might be relevant. Thus, beyond the scope of Hegelian studies and German aesthetics more generally, this book is deeply engaged with current scholarship in political theory, particularly as it concerns the critique of classical liberalism and the emergence of a politics of difference, recognition theory, multiculturalist theory, and similar strands of contemporary cultural politics. With respect to aesthetic theory, the conversation easily cuts across the sometimeswide division between the continental and analytic traditions, both historical and contemporary. While drawing on current scholarship in both political and aesthetic theory, this book also aims to initiate a uniquely interdisciplinary discussion within and among these and similar fields by framing such questions as soliciting both individual and collaborative responses.8 Finally, the claims of this book will be illustrated by, and tested against, deep and sustained engagement with a range of contemporary works of art in which modern conceptions of identity enter into public discourse. My hope in formulating a Hegelian response to the questions raised by the cultural turn\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 17\n\nin art and politics is that it allows us to recalibrate art’s relation to contemporary agency and reconceive aesthetic experience. As I illustrated above, for example, a film such as Do the Right Thing can be seen as facilitating both legitimate forms of political participation as well as rich forms of aesthetic experience in how it aims to solicit engagement with representations of cultural identity. The Hegelian idea that we enact subjectivity in works of art, in other words, gives us a more robust and meaningful way of engaging aesthetically with the representation of race in a Spike Lee film, and the increased representation of cultural particularity in art more generally. As the demand for cultural representation has come to underwrite the political and artistic developments of recent decades, the question is: How does this demand for representation influence the evaluative criteria relevant to both politics and art? Just as the long-standing assumption of liberal politics that justice and equality demand an identity-blind allotment of rights, responsibilities, and public goods is being challenged, the notion that the aesthetic can or should operate independently of cultural politics no longer holds sway. We can no longer evaluate artistic productions without considering whether the characters appear as stereotypes, whether dialogue and plot lines are male-dominated, whether the female body is sexually objectified, or whether the artists, writers, and directors have the appropriate cultural standing even to take aesthetic responsibility for these representations. The Broadway production Hamilton is celebrated for director Lin Manuel-Miranda’s efforts to stage a musical biography of a white American statesman using only nonwhite performers. Increasingly, audiences demand that Disney films take greater responsibility with the images and narratives of women, Native Americans, or Muslims, and commend Black Panther for introducing a superhero into the world of Marvel comics that is not\n\n18 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nanother white man. Contemporary cultural phenomena such as these imbricate the politics and aesthetics of identity in ways that outstrip the theoretical framework belonging to what Walter Benjamin described as the “politics of aesthetics,”9 and compel us to formulate new ways of articulating the relation between art and politics.\n\n1.2. THE CULTURAL TURN IN POLITICS Instead of simply adding to an already crowded field of turns devised to package complex historical, cultural, and intellectual developments into simple explanatory concepts, my aim in using the phrase cultural turn is to give it a more precise meaning than it has elsewhere been given. There is, in the first place, the technical, academic sense of cultural turn, used to describe the emergence of disciplinary practices (primarily in the social sciences) specifically adapted to treat culture as the proper lens through which to examine human behaviors, values, and practices. It can also have prescriptive meaning. As it occurs in the writings of Frederic Jameson, for example, cultural turn signifies the sense in which “culture,” once a privilege of high society, is now “consumed throughout daily life itself.”10 Yet, there is a more specific sense in which this turn to culture takes hold at the intersection of politics and aesthetics, which I think warrants more focused analysis. Though common to each is a certain anti-positivist skepticism regarding the purity of practices and the clarity of boundaries—between the objective and the subjective, between the public and the private, between the global and the local— the cultural turn in art and politics is distinctive in the way such boundaries are blurred by critically examining the meaning of cultural identity in particular. As we’ll see soon enough, the\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 19\n\nemerging congruency between art and politics with respect to cultural identity is by no means coincidental; it is evidence of their mutually dependent roles in shaping the meaning of modern identity. Political theory, for its part, has in recent decades adopted a decidedly more critical view of liberalism’s appeal to universality. This tendency has its roots in the contractualist tradition that extends from Hobbes, Locke, Mill, Rousseau, and Kant to the more recent writing of John Rawls and Robert Nozick. Political theorists are coming to appreciate what marginalized communities have long understood: that behind Locke’s reformist campaign for individual liberty is an opportunistic pitch for the exploits of European colonialists, that Mill’s championing of individuality as “one of the elements of well-being” paradoxically asks us to check our private identities and interests at the door of public discourse; that Rawls’s notion of political deliberation behind a “veil of ignorance” turns out to conceal the very source of social bias that liberalism purports to eliminate. Some question whether it is even possible, as Rawls puts it, “to evaluate principles solely on the basis of general considerations.” 11 Others question the practical wisdom of deliberating in hypotheticals, as if an ideal of justice could be reached in abstraction from existing structural inequalities. To a large extent, then, political theory today has come to terms with the reality that what passes as “fairness” is not the product of political bargaining, and much of it is forged well outside the space of the bargaining table. I join such critiques in acknowledging liberalism’s historical success in prevailing over oppressive aristocracy and the persistent ambitions of authoritative regimes. But this does not mean that liberalism has made good on its promise to level the playing field. In fact, many of these critiques allege that the anonymized\n\n20 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nlanguage of “equality” is precisely the tool with which gender disparity, institutional racism, employment bias, and similarly pervasive forms of oppression have been able to persist. Even stalwart defenders of the liberal tradition have acknowledged the need for more robust conception of social and political agency. Such “reformed liberalists,” as we might call them, insist that, beyond the usual schedule of rights and freedoms, liberalism’s commitment to an ideal of individual autonomy requires the recognition of culturally specific identities. Many reformed liberalists maintain that its appeal to universal human dignity entails the dignity of certain national, cultural, and social groups. Will Kymlicka, for example, argues that the recognition of “societal cultures” is not just consistent with the liberal commitment to individual freedom, but demanded by it, since it is only within the context of a given cultural environment that individuals make choices about the kind of life they want to lead.12 Charles Taylor, however, is more skeptical that the “politics of equal dignity” in classical liberal thought can be reconciled with the “politics of difference,” which rejects the notion that politics must proceed from a place of unity. Instead, he proposes a politics of recognition, according to which self-determination requires more than simply the ascription of equal rights and a general toleration of cultural difference in society; it also requires equal respect for individual and collective forms of identity.13 The point here is not to evaluate the individual merits of these views, but rather to take note of the fairly profound shift in the way subjectivity is conceived of in political philosophy. The cultural turn in politics reflects a shift from the abstract to the particular: from the liberal conception of the individual as the bearer of rights to the reformed liberalist’s conception of the individual as the bearer of a distinctive identity deserving recognition and respect. These critiques of liberalism form part of a\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 21\n\nbroader development in political theory which, though it goes by different names (e.g., the politics of difference, the politics of recognition, multiculturalism, identity politics, etc.) can be broadly designated by us as “cultural politics.” What binds these views together is a commitment to liberal ideals—justice, rights, equality, etc.— coupled with the critique of the notion that such ideals can be analyzed or implemented independently of the specific cultural contexts in which they occur. This critique is premised on the ostensible gap between what liberalism promises in theory and what it delivers in practice, particularly for oppressed or underrepresented communities. For example, feminist philosopher Carol Pateman introduces the idea of a “sexual contract” to make explicit how the neutral language of social contract theory implicitly sanctions forms of gender inequality that have persisted for centuries.14 Mirroring this strategy, critical race theorist Charles Mills argues that this philosophical power play reveals itself in racial terms, as a “racial contract.” In doing so, he explains, “whites contract to regard one another as moral equals who are superior to nonwhites and who create, accordingly, governments, legal systems, and economic structures that privilege them at the expense of people of color.”15\n\n1.2.1. Reformed Liberalism (and Its Limits) Radical as many of these critiques may seem, it is significant that none recommends the wholesale rejection of liberalism; only its reform. At the heart of the cultural turn in politics, then, is an effort to revise liberal thought by way of an internal critique that reveals how its commitment to anonymity and abstraction disproportionately benefits the privileged at the expense of the underprivileged. The first step to reform, Mills recommends, is\n\n22 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nto abandon the theoretical orientation toward an “ideal” politics altogether and instead acknowledge the ways that cultural identity actually figures into politics, both explicitly and implicitly. Rectifying the injustices that occur on liberalism’s watch does not mean dispensing with the liberal ideal of individual self-determination altogether. Nor does it mean abandoning the traditional framework of universal rights and freedoms designed to secure that ideal. Instead, it means going beyond the limited institutional frameworks of politics and situating the conditions of self-determination in the social recognition of cultural identity. But, as I intend to show, it also means situating the modern ideal of self-determination where, curiously enough, the liberal tradition of Western political theory has not yet thought to look—in the aesthetic. In shifting attention from abstract individuality to cultural particularity, reformed liberalism takes part—perhaps unwittingly—in the politics of perception. In pushing liberalism beyond the neutral territory of policies, principles, and procedures, and into the undefined and contested space of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc., it shows that representation is as much a matter of public perception as it is of public policies, institutions, and discourse. Contending with the cultural politics of, say, the Muslim headscarf, transgender bathrooms, female genital mutilation, affirmative action, or any other such identity-specific conflicts of individual and group rights means also contending with the dominant perceptions and attitudes that inevitably figure into the formal political response to such issues. Cultural politics must consider the causal relation between identity-specific institutional measures and public perceptions of identity, as well as the function of deliberative processes in facilitating this relation. Are present conflicts over immigration, for example, a contest of reasoned\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 23\n\nprinciples or a struggle to control a certain narrative about immigrants? Are the sweeping legislative reforms concerning same-sex marriage the product of, or a precursor to, the corresponding shift in social perceptions that normalize same-sex relations? To what extent is public deliberation of, say, legal protections of native and indigenous lands connected with the public perception of such lands as having a certain spiritual and cultural value? It is at exactly these moments, when institutional politics intersect with the politics of perception, that even reformed liberalism reveals its limits. Its narrow emphasis on discursivity overlooks certain informal modes of social communication through which identity claims are transmitted within and beyond cultural groups. So much, then, for the nonideal approach to the revamping of liberal thought. This oversight on the part of cultural politics also undercuts its efforts to register identity claims within the liberal framework of abstract rights. Even more worrisome is that ignoring the ways that identity is negotiated at the level of social perception can seriously distort the way in which we understand, evaluate, and respond to the claims of culture when they appear in the form of art. As I argue in the next chapter, this is precisely what happens with the political handling of the infamous controversy over Salman Rushdie’s The Satanic Verses. By framing the Rushdie affair as a clash between liberal free speech rights and group-specific demands to be protected from offensive speech, political theorists overlooked the sense in which it involved an even more basic struggle to wrest control over the narrative of modern Muslim identity. Almost never in the course of the controversy is it asked: What is the status of literature as a claim to cultural identity? What bearing might the literary status of The Satanic Verses have on the clash of cultural rights that it is presumed to exemplify, or, for that\n\n24 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nmatter, on the question of what constitutes its alleged offensiveness in the first place? Such questions lead us to even more complex considerations concerning the cultural authority of the artist and how this factors into both political and aesthetic judgments about the artistic representation of identity. Comparing the Rushdie controversy with the more recent controversies involving the Danish cartoons of Muhammad and Dana Schutz’s painting of Emmett Till, I claim that cultural authority has something to do with having skin in the game— the extent to which the artist’s own identity is substantially informed by the representation of identity at stake in the artwork. But ultimately what this demonstrates, I go on to show, are the conceptual limits to which this line of inquiry inevitably leads us. To articulate the conditions of cultural authority or to make value judgments about it entails exercising some degree of the very authority in question. The Rushdie controversy is but one illustration of the way that cultural politics confronts its limits at the politics of perception. For there it encounters the vexing metaquestion: Who determines who gets to determine what certain forms of cultural identity look like? This brings us to the broader issue, taken up in chapter 3, of what self-determination looks like in the age of cultural identity, and the role that art plays in advancing it. It is here that the resources of Hegelian aesthetics prove especially valuable. Because the thing that emerges most clearly from the critique of liberalism is that the achievement of modern agency is bound up with the perception of cultural identity, and the idea that works of art embody “the deepest interests” of humans gives us a firm starting point for analyzing the way artworks such as Do the Right Thing and The Satanic Verses function as significant sources of contemporary self-understanding. More specifically,\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 25\n\nthe Hegel-inspired account of aesthetic reflexivity I begin to develop in this chapter offers a way of preserving the liberal ideal of self-determination by extending the concept beyond the constraints of rational discourse. Insofar as modern subjectivity increasingly demands reflexive awareness of one’s own particularity in relation to the particularity of others, art becomes increasingly central to the practice of situating oneself socially. In this way, the critique of liberal self-determination gives way to the Hegelian notion that in works of art we enact our identities through culturally expressive forms of images, narratives, and the like. By reviving one of the central insights of nineteenth century aesthetic theory in the context of contemporary political theory, we are able to reclaim what literary critic Lionel Trilling describes as the loss of imagination in liberal politics. Beyond the space of policy and deliberation, art provides a way of imaginatively orienting oneself within and among myriad ways of being human. In chapter 4, I extend this discussion of aesthetic reflexivity to another, more familiar concept in Hegel that assigns to selfdetermination an explicitly reflexive structure: the concept of recognition. I begin by pointing out that the more recent strands of critical theory advancing the discussion of recognition have all but abandoned the pivotal connection between politics and aesthetics that prompted seminal texts of critical theorists such as Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, György Lukács, and Hebert Marcuse. Focusing specifically on the influential writings of Axel Honneth, I argue that recognitive theory is especially vulnerable to the criticism that its own objectives are significantly undermined by its systematic neglect of the aesthetic dimension of recognition. If, as recognition theorists readily admit, achieved subjectivity demands more than rational reflection, and demands for recognition are met only in achieving a certain kind of\n\n26 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nreflexive relation between the self and the social world, then the real issue confronting the politics of recognition, I argue, is the way that nondiscursive perceptions of individual and collective identity shape and inform these relations. The key here, I think, is to see that aesthetic experience bears a similar reflexive structure to that of recognition. Works of art prompt us to evaluate a normative dimension of the self–other relation otherwise invisible to or inaccessible through rational reflection alone. By reformulating the political aesthetics of early critical theory in terms of the reflexive character of aesthetic experience, recognitive theorists (and cultural politics more generally) will I think be in a better position to address the perennial concern that recognition is often contingent upon social perceptions that reify, distort, or trivialize particular forms of identity.\n\n1.3. THE CULTURAL TURN IN ART Meanwhile, a similar phenomenon is evident in the artistic practices of recent decades. More or less concurrently with the political developments just described, the cultural turn in art likewise undertakes a paradigm shift from abstraction to particularity. For much of the twentieth century, the dominant narrative of modern (and to a certain extent postmodern) art has been characterized in terms of a gradual dissolution of representation. The grand narrative of art that connects Bauhaus to Warhol’s “Factory” is underwritten by a supposed crisis in representation that begins with the loosening of the impressionist’s brushstrokes and ends with the collapse of the term “art” itself. Whether the crisis in representation is manifested in the purification of artistic practice through the expulsion of content or the critique of representation through mass-produced images, its real\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 27\n\nfunction is to lend a certain logic to the disparate developments of avant-garde art. Yet, as critics, curators, and historians have increasingly pointed out, the narrative of modern art works by way of omission. At some point, the myth of a raceless, genderless modernism has begun to crack and give way to practices deeply embedded within culturally pecific practices and modes of representation. A growing number of contemporary artists actively resist the modernist narrative that separates representation from the aesthetic and the political aims of art through an aggressive reclaiming of art as the space for cultural expression. This is not to say, of course, that the tendency to claim (or reclaim) a sense of identity isn’t present throughout art history. Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing is a clear example of art’s taking up the politics of identity, but similar precedents can be found in Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, the poetry of Langston Hughes, or the music of Aretha Franklin, John Coltrane, or the Delta blues. Indeed, examples such as these are plentiful, and are vital to the culmination of similar aesthetic practices into a profoundly influential artistic movement. So it is not in terms of any particular set of aesthetic qualities that we can speak of a cultural turn in art, but rather in terms of the sheer quantity of works over the past few decades that take the representation of cultural identity to be central to art. The same year that Do the Right Thing was released (1989), Salman Rushdie’s fourth novel, The Satanic Verses, was published by Penguin Press, instigating mass protests among many Muslims who perceived the book as an offense to Islam, shortly followed by book burnings, death threats, and, of course, the infamous fatwa issued by the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini calling for the assassination of Rushdie and his publishers. That year also witnessed the fever pitch of the “culture wars” in the\n\n28 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nU.S., marked by the state censorship of Robert Mapplethorpe’s homoerotic photography and Andres Serrano’s allegedly blasphemous work, Piss Christ, depicting a crucifix submerged in a vitrine full of the artist’s urine. Meanwhile, the feminist artist collective, Guerrilla Girls, began placing its iconic posters throughout New York City, asking the public “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” And finally, the rap group N.W.A was arrested for performing the controversial “Fuck the Police” track off their debut album at a concert in Detroit. Incidentally, it is also the year in which Francis Fukuyama famously asserted (in that neoconservative appropriation of Hegelian dialectics) the “end of history” in the “unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism.”16 The advance of this political trend within the art establishment was made abundantly clear at the notorious 1993 Whitney Biennial, heavily criticized at the time for its curatorial focus on art that, as one reviewer smugly put it, “shrieks about every last inequality.”17 We can certainly develop a retrospective appreciation for the cutting-edge criticality of these works that was largely absent at the time, as Michael Kelly has argued.18 And we can read such works through the interpretive lens of what Hal Foster famously describes as the “return of the real” in postwar avant-garde art, a form of art-mediated investigation into social conflict in which the turn to identity plays a determinative role.19 But there is a more specific and more important sense in which the most controversial works of the 1993 Whitney biennial are “political”: they engage with the politics of identity. The works of Byron Kim, Laura Simpson, Sue Williams, Cindy Sherman, Spike Lee, Kiki Smith, and Fred Wilson were significant then, as they are now, for their explicit treatment of gender, sexual orientation, and race, particularly as they appear against the backdrop of an increasingly urgent AIDS epidemic and the\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 29\n\nreleased video footage of Rodney King being brutally assaulted by the Los Angeles police. This specification is crucial, since the controversies that emerge in this art historical context involve a question not about the place of politics in art in general, but about the role of art in articulating one’s particular sense of self. The worry, then, is that if we confuse the general question of political art with the specific question of art’s turn to the representation of cultural identity, we grossly misread what is at stake in such cases, both aesthetically and politically. Instead of responding to critics who disparaged Serrano’s work as “trash” with blanket condemnations of censorship, 20 we might consider the ways that such representations function aesthetically as an expression of the same religious identity its critics perceived to be under attack. And insofar as Mapplethorpe’s work prompts questions about the value of public funding for art deemed offensive or controversial, that discussion should specifically address the status of photography as the medium of expression. We need to ask why artists such as Ray Navarro, David Wojnarowicz, and activist artist collectives like Act Up, Gran Fury, and General Idea, looked to art to bring attention to an increasingly urgent AIDS epidemic that especially affected the gay community, or, more generally, to bring public awareness to the existence of a gay subculture no longer content to remain concealed at the social periphery. It is no surprise, then, that when we ask “Why has there been this cultural turn in art?,” we find that art appears where representation on the sociopolitical front is lacking. Art appears when representation is needed in a way that the usual political mechanisms cannot, or perhaps will not, supply. It is no surprise, then, that when art reemerges from the modern/postmodern condition, liberated from overzealous strictures against\n\n30 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nrepresentation, aesthetic representation forms in direct response to the socially and politically underrepresented. Speaking to the emergence of Black aesthetics, Paul Taylor cites its origin in the failures of deliberative politics: “Having been barred, for the most part, from the spaces and settings that their societies of residence set aside for the formal conduct of politics, Black people turned disproportionately to expressive culture.”21 Similarly, Zina Jardaneh, chair of the board of the Palestinian Museum in Birzeit, describes the surge of creative output coming from Palestinian artists frustrated with stalled diplomacy around peace talks: “With the continued failure of the political process, many of us now believe that culture is where we should channel our resources, energy and hopes.”22 These and other similarly earnest appeals to art in the name of identity cut a wide swath in what is now a global landscape of creative and curatorial practices.23 Individual artists I associate with the cultural turn in art include Adrian Piper, Lorna Simpson, Robert Gober, Fred Wilson, Jimmie Durham, Edgar Heap of Birds, Coco Fusco, Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, Felix GonzalesTorres, Glenn Ligon, Catherine Opie, and the quirky artist duo Gilbert & George, among many, many others. Each of these artists deploys a distinctive form of art’s representational force in the ongoing battles over contemporary identity: what it means to be “Black” or “Native American,” “Woman” or “Feminist” or “Queer,” and so on. Collectively, such artists have radically altered how we perceive both the production and reception of art. They have demanded we add yet another layer of complexity to aesthetic perception: that we see “art” not as the neutral, disinterested, “autonomous” thing modernism has made it out to be, but as something that always— even if to varying degrees— appears to us under the phenomenological conditions of race, gender, religion,\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 31\n\nnationality, ethnicity, class, sexual orientation, etc. By making explicit the contest of cultural interests deployed in all aspects of art, such works prompt us to see the ways in which we see the work through the lens of cultural particularity, and to make this reflexive awareness part of the experience of art. And, while aesthetic representations of cultural particularity do not necessarily make for good art, I think this added layer of experiential complexity can significantly enliven and enrich how we engage with art, and can open up a range of imaginative and interpretive possibilities. Finally, it is no surprise that the cultural turn in art has contributed much to the overall expansion of the art world into popular culture. It is no surprise at all that the broadly accessible mediums of television, movies, cartoons, comic books, etc., have played an integral part in extending the sociopolitical reach of art into the public sphere. With the spheres of modern existence growing increasingly isolated and insulated, where else might we find a point of convergence among radically different types of folks but in the mass appeal of easily consumable culture? Popular culture brings visibility to identity. Television shows such as The Wire and The Handmaid’s Tale are the stuff of water cooler conversations, bringing issues of race, gender, sexual identity, and the like, into broader view. Rejecting the modernist assumption that art gains politics only by compromising the aesthetic, these and many other popular contemporary works are aesthetically engaging in the way they allow complex social issues to inform their artistic elements. For the millions of viewers drawn to the character of Omar Little, it is worth considering that part of what makes his character so interesting and complex is the unexpected intersection of identity categories at work in the idea of a queer Black hero-villain protagonist. It is hard to say how this kind of aesthetic achievement measures\n\n32 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nagainst the success of staking out new terrain in the everexpanding geography of avant-garde art. But it does seem that works of art that aim to represent a particular normative view of the world without collapsing into moralism or didacticism carry the additional burden of having to invest more heavily in their aesthetic appeal. Plato was right to worry about the poet’s capacity to lure audiences from the rational into the sensory. But he was wrong in his efforts to expel rather than engage with the politics of perception. Because, from the nonideal standpoint, we are all lovers of sights and sounds, and thus need to be critically attentive to the myriad ways our world, as well as our place in it, is made intelligible to us through appearances. Contrawise, contemporary critics who advocate expelling the political from art in order to protect the purity of the aesthetic should bear in mind that many works of art attain the sociopolitical force that they do precisely because they succeed in attracting and sustaining aesthetic attention.\n\n1.3.1. The Kantian Avant-Garde (and Its Limits) Just as political theory fails to respond to the cultural turn in politics, aesthetic theory fails to respond to the cultural turn in art. Whereas political theory fails to account for the aesthetic dimension of contemporary cultural politics, aesthetic theory fails to account for the political dimension of contemporary art. Only, with respect to aesthetic theory, the failure is not simply a matter of oversight; rather, it has to do with the entrenched skepticism of aesthetic theory with respect to the nonaesthetic, particularly regarding heavily freighted normative concepts such as “culture” and “identity.” For many\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 33\n\naesthetic theorists, the value of art is not that it represents culture aesthetically, but that it represents the unpresentability of culture. Indeed, such theorists seem to revel in art’s impotence, finding ever novel ways of theorizing art exclusively in terms of incompleteness, indeterminacy, and indecipherability. This tendency toward negativity is characteristic of a wider trend in contemporary aesthetic theory I call “Kantian avantgardism.” This includes a wide and somewhat disparate set of views, but broadly shared among them is a tendency to read Kant’s Third Critique as a discourse on the unpresentability of avant-garde art. Implicitly or explicitly, many theorists turn to Kant in search of an aesthetic progressivism solely on the conviction that Hegel uses words like “Truth” and “Absolute.” Now, some are rightly skeptical of the attempt to ascribe grandiose purposes to art, for example, providing a cultural mythology or a tool of human emancipation. Others are dubious of efforts to elevate art to the level of something sacrosanct, thus cutting it off from the world of everyday experience. And yet, many of the same skeptics have no problem drawing a causal connection between a Hegelian aesthetics of cultural expression and the sinister cultural agenda of fascist politics. Whatever the particular motivations among Kantian avant-gardists, the general sense is that all the perceived ills of idealist aesthetics can be warded off with the antidotes available in Kant’s third Critique. The tendency I refer to is not so much even that of the Kantian formalism that has gained such prominence in analytic aesthetics in recent decades (though, of course, the conceptual language of “significant form” and “perceptual qualities” hardly capture what’s going on in a work such as Piss Christ or Do the Right Thing).24 Nor does it have to do with skepticism in general. In the aftermath of National Socialism, for example, the appeal\n\n34 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nto artistic freedom was concomitant with the widespread progressive reforms taking shape across Europe, particularly with the student protests of the late 1960s. The emergence of reception aesthetics (Rezeptionsästhetik) in postwar Germany literary theory is a good example of an aesthetic strategy of skeptical resistance meaningfully informed by Kantian theory. 25 Rather, the problem has to do with skepticism for its own sake; skepticism run amok. It is the entrenched and principled skepticism, which, irrespective of sociopolitical circumstances, insists on situating the sociopolitical force of art strictly in its inability to represent, that is problematic today. It is the kind of skepticism that regards representation as inherently compromised, both politically and aesthetically, irrespective of what is represented or who is representing. My critique of Kantian avant-gardism is in this respect a historicist critique. The problem, more precisely, has to do with the way this radical skepticism extends from the modern to the postmodern and beyond. For it seems that what began as a commendable call for expressive and imaginative freedom has somehow been translated into a narrow set of avant-garde aesthetic norms against which contemporary art continues to be measured. I am not sure that art theory should still be preaching the doctrine of unpresentability in view of the cultural turn in art. I am even less certain about the move to make Kant the unwitting underwriter of avant-gardists making hay about art’s incapacity to do anything at all. I am not convinced by the skepticism which insists the vitality of the text demands the death of the author; which trashes narrative to treasure the fragmentary; which is unreflectively prepared to pounce on any work of art that does not indulge fully in ambiguity and indecipherability as the unwitting tool of conservative ideologues. This is the skepticism I am skeptical of.\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 35\n\nIt is a messy genealogy, but we can identify two basic varieties of Kantian avant-gardist skepticism: the modern, which takes shape primarily in the writings of Theodor Adorno, and the postmodern, as articulated by Jean-Francois Lyotard. For Adorno, the form of skepticism begat by the toxic concoction of fascism and capitalism is that which drives virtually every impulse of Frankfurt school critical theory. The most conspicuous expression of this skepticism with respect to aesthetic theory is undoubtedly Adorno’s provocative-but-overanalyzed assertion that “to write lyric poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.”26 Whatever else this vexing phrase is supposed to mean, it is clear that it is less a moral indictment than an aesthetic claim about the norms of artistic representation in the face of immeasurable atrocity. For even though, as Adorno goes on to say, “this corrodes even the knowledge of why it has become impossible to write poetry today,” the point is that poetry does continue, not as a contingent fact, but as a necessity of modern life. More importantly, it is the recognition that art carries forth, not in blissful oblivion, but with the searing, inescapable consciousness of horror and the equally damning burden that it must, but can’t, bear aesthetic witness to such horror. Art is neither exempted from nor adequate to the Sisyphean task of representation. So it is not the impossibility, but rather the irreconcilable tension between the necessity and impossibility of representation that Adorno insists on as both the condition and the content of modern art. Modern art, according to Adorno, just is this impossibility to reconcile its residual tendency toward mythical transcendence of the everyday world and its ineluctably disenchanted presence within it. Art does this, not by pointing at the social world, but by showcasing its asociality, by making a virtue of its practical impotence. As soon as art says something it is reified and thrust back into the world of instrumental reason\n\n36 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nwhere it can be tamed and made complacent. Instead, by way of paradoxical dialectic, art becomes political by retreating from politics, by becoming autonomous. “What is social in art is its immanent movement against society, not its manifest opinions.”27 By this logic, instead of becoming political in the grip of tragedy and oppression, art is to become “enigmatic” (AT, 27). Between the “committed” politics of Brechtian theater and the enigmatic literature of Kafka or the atonal music of Schoenberg, there is for Adorno an ultimatum on modern art’s strategic response to the persistent threats of fascism and all-consuming capitalism: either render art legible and thus benign as a form of politics, or work subversion from within by exploiting art’s apolitical advancements in “style.” Adorno’s aesthetic program rests wholly on the certainty that it is only by this inward turn, this explicit rebuke of social utility, sustained by radical experimentations in aesthetic form, that art becomes “socially useful,” that it “criticizes society merely by existing” (AT, 225–26, emphasis mine). To be sure, Adorno’s Aesthetic Theory is equal parts Kant and Hegel, forged on the possibility of reconciling aesthetic autonomy with historical dialectics. But it is precisely because Adorno’s skepticism prioritizes the sensuous particularity of the artwork in relation to a given set of social conditions that we should be skeptical of setting such rigid modernist prescriptions in stone. Let’s admit that artistic inventiveness and ambiguity come off as a clever fuck-you to the artless, jingoistic kitsch promoted by Nazis. And let’s admit that the capitalist machinations of the “culture industry” favor intelligibility in subversive art because it retains marketability. But let’s also admit that by the same token social conditions may call for an aesthetic response that is not forced to choose stylistic innovation over representation. Adorno was smart enough not to speculate\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 37\n\non art’s future. But it seems not to have occurred to him that conditions would be such that the dialectic between transcendence and disenchantment would not, in fact, be “inherent in art itself ” but a product of historical contingency (AT, 149). It does not seem to occur to Adorno that sociopolitical conditions may be such that the choice between committed and autonomous art is itself a product of social conditions that favor philosophical elitism over expansive artistic practices, or that the taboos of representation fit neatly into an aesthetic and political agenda that favors abstraction over direct confrontation with particularity. But if the dialectical reading of art’s political character is to mean anything at all, it must mean that wallowing in aesthetic impotence must also meet its limits. It must mean that merely existing is not enough. It must mean that the dogma of aesthetic pessimism must at some point turn against itself, become self-critical in a way that restores at least the possibility of artistic representation that is at once critical and affirmative. But the denial of even this possibility is skepticism run amok. It is the principled rejection of aesthetic representation based on the assumption of art’s inherent vulnerability to being easily coopted by political or market forces. This skepticism winces at the slightest whiff of the political in art, since, as Terry Eagleton complains, on Adorno’s view, “for art to refer, even protestingly, is for it to become instantly collusive with what it opposes.”28 Nor is the modernist strand of Kantian avant-gardism peculiar to Adorno; it lives on in various reconstituted forms. Jay Bernstein, for example, ascribes sociopolitical significance to modern art vis-à-vis Kant’s appeal to a sensus communis as the basis of aesthetic judgment, recasting modern aesthetics from Heidegger to Derrida to Adorno as a collective yearning for this lost unity—as a “memorial” aesthetics.29 Though Bernstein is certainly right to\n\n38 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\ndiagnose this relation in terms of a modern liberal state that has separated the legal from the ethical, and the public from the private, he is wrong to draw the Adornian conclusion that the only answer to a neutralized politics is the neutralization of art. Precisely because modern liberalism “leaves out of consideration any self that might matter in the way of self-determination,”30 art should no longer content itself with the modernist’s assurance that a strict diet of pure aestheticism is the only way to feed the hunger for a progressive counterpolitics. It is precisely because “our ‘We’ has gone underground” that art praxis has come to interrogate the myth of the identityless subject in both politics and aesthetics. And it is because art objects are “saturated” in precisely the way Bernstein describes that we need not mourn the “turn away from art and the aesthetic toward gender and race” but instead see feminist and critical race theory (among others) as guiding inquiry into why such objects have come to be so thoroughly saturated with race and gender, not to mention the range of other identity concepts that now ineluctably shape the experience and appreciation of art.31 Today, this line of thought continues (albeit in far more elusive and elliptical form) in the increasingly popular writings of contemporary French theorist Jacques Rancière. From a fairly loose conceptual affiliation with the aesthetics of Kant and Schiller,32 Rancière identifies the aesthetic as one of the principal “regimes” of community life in which sensible experience frames our modern understanding of the world. In keeping with the post-1968 orientation of Rancière’s politics, however, he frames art’s relation to what he vaguely terms the “distribution of the sensible” in decidedly antagonistic terms, bereft of the affirmative character that Kant and to a greater extent Schiller ascribed to art. Art’s role is not to “produce collective bodies,” but rather to “introduce lines of fracture and disincorporation\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 39\n\ninto imaginary collective bodies.”33 With Rancière, we get the extension of the modernist logic from high modernism to radical avant-gardism. It once again confirms the separation of art and politics, both implicitly and explicitly ruling out the possibility of art capable of speaking the representational language of a “We.” In Germany, this anti-representational tendency is being led by Christoph Menke, who takes up the task of resolving Adorno’s “antinomy” of modern art. For Menke, reconciling the autonomy of art with its distinctly critical capacity requires that we assert the sovereignty of art over reason. Aesthetic experience, in other words, is a privileged form of critique to the extent that it subverts rational critique. The theoretical thrust of this view supplements the negative aesthetics of Adorno with the deconstructionist approach of Jacques Derrida. Whereas Adorno touts the “enigmatic” character of artworks, which closes them off from rational discourse, Menke sees the distinctive function of artworks in terms of what he calls “de-automization,” a disruption of the everyday connections between sign and meaning.34 This rupture makes possible the kind of radically indeterminate and ungoverned meaning-making practices that Derrida insists is part of any critical reading of any text. Menke’s thesis, then, reasserts the modernist trope that art registers criticality only at a distance from politics, and pushes it deep into postmodernist territory where criticality means showing the impossibility of ever showing how things might be otherwise. The postmodernist strand of Kantian avant-gardism takes the modernist skepticism of representation and transforms it into all-out cynicism. As Lyotard himself makes clear in The Postmodern Condition, where modernism appeals to aesthetic form to gesture at the unpresentable, postmodernism represents the unpresentable by evacuating normativity from aesthetic\n\n40 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nrepresentation altogether, abandoning even the idea of art.35 In demonstrating the failure of representation and the necessity of this failure, the romantic genius gets a postmodernist makeover as an aesthetic outlaw whose political agenda consists in flaunting this freewheeling detachment. But this lack of accountability, in art as elsewhere, is won through an abundance of privilege. A critique of representation is one thing; dawdling in indeterminacy with the unreflective certainty that it makes for either good art or good politics is another—it is cynicism. The most fashionable version of this tendency exists in the persistent attempt to make the Kantian category of the “sublime” relevant to contemporary art. This familiar strategy turns up not only in the context of Derrida’s deconstructionism, but in the writings of various postmodernist thinkers such as Gilles Deleuze, Frederic Jameson, Paul de Man, et al. But it has also been revived in the more recent work of scholars such as Paul Crowther, Rodolphe Gasché, and Kirk Pillow. 36 Common among such efforts is the tendency to measure the political and aesthetic function of avant-garde art not in terms of what it can do, but in terms of what it can undo. Its formula is simple: for any x, art gives us not-x. In this way, modernist skepticism thus slides into a postmodern cynicism which insists (to quote Eagleton again) “Truth is a lie; morality stinks; beauty is shit.” 37 So, again, what draws these different strands together is a deep and enduring suspicion of aesthetic representation forged from a highly abstract conception of the political relevance of avant-garde art and bearing a (sometimes dubious) connection to the aesthetic theory of Kant. This results, first, in a conspicuous disconnect between contemporary aesthetic theory and the contemporary practices of art. The ideals that have carried this tradition to prominence— aesthetic autonomy,\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 41\n\nindeterminacy, the sublime, etc.— evolved from an era of avant-garde experimentation that no longer hold much explanatory purchase on dominant trends in contemporary art, particularly those that treat “culture” as a primary site of interrogation. More significantly, this disconnect generates a deeply troublesome contradiction for Kantian avant-gardism that so far hasn’t seemed to register within contemporary aesthetic theory. For it turns out that, much like the political, the principle of aesthetic abstraction to which the Kantian avantgardist is committed, rather than safeguarding art from ideological abuse, turns out to be a potential source of it. Peter Bürger elucidates this contradiction by noting that once the autonomy of art came to imply “an element of the noncommittal and an absence of any consequences,” the avant-garde was bound to fail in its efforts to reintegrate art with the reality.38 Rita Felski, lamenting the present condition of literary studies as one consumed by a “hermeneutics of suspicion,” writes that it is not criticism itself that is the issue, but rather “the kudzulike proliferation of a hypercritical style of analysis that has crowded out alternative forms of intellectual life.”39 Similarly, my worry is that an entrenched skepticism has taken over philosophical aesthetics, and foreclosed on the possibility that aesthetic representation can be an affirmative source of self-understanding, an idea which is no longer taken seriously. Even if the anti-representationalist position can be made internally coherent, any formulation of it will be hard to square with the historical development of art. The Kantian demand for generalizability that the various strands of avant-gardism have come to regard as essential to politically subversive art turn out (rather ironically) to be the least subversive. Indeed, there is an air of conservatism in the expectation that high art transcend cultural particularity, as it, in effect, implies that art is not the\n\n42 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nproper place to exercise our identities. Worse still, in the context of the cultural turn in art, the principled denial that art can represent the underrepresented without sacrificing aesthetic integrity reads as an aesthetics of privilege. Of course, one can formulate this critique in direct response to Kant’s aesthetics, as Monique Roelofs does in arguing that Kant “champions an aestheticization of normatively white cultural forms, and propounds a racialized and ethnically delimited paradigm of taste.”40 But the tendency I want to address is the more broadly (and more deeply) manifested tendency to dig in one’s heels on the theoretical commitment to aesthetic abstraction even as contemporary artistic practices have become overwhelming preoccupied with cultural particularity. The once-promising belief that refusing representation is a more refined and indirect way of attaching aesthetics to politics has in the end morphed into to dogma, providing the aesthete with an all-too convenient basis for refusing to engage with the Guerilla Girls poster that says, in effect, “this is what gender bias looks like” or the Kehinde Wiley painting that says, in effect, that “this is what the Black figure looks like.”\n\n1.4. CONCLUSION: A RETURN TO HEGEL Against this tendency toward abstraction in both political and aesthetic theory, this book aims to give an affirmative account of aesthetic representation as one of the primary sources of modern identity. Beyond the critical task of showing the limitations of this tendency, therefore, is the positive task of advancing an account of art that is sufficiently responsive to the developments of contemporary politics and contemporary art. The cultural turn\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 43\n\nin politics signals the need to understand modern subjectivity in terms of cultural identity, and the cultural turn in art signals art’s turn, or rather return, to the cultural significance of art. It is this twofold development that gives renewed relevance to Hegelian aesthetics, particularly in terms of the way it connects the reflexive form of aesthetic experience with the cultivation and communication of one’s identity. With the shift from conceptually abstract notions of agency to the concrete particularity of cultural identity comes the need to recognize and respond to the social and political force of appearances. The idea that one’s sense of self depends in large part on how (or even whether) one’s distinctive identity is perceived in a given social context raises an important set of questions presently neglected in both political and aesthetic theory. It is for this reason, then, that the cultural turn calls for a revisionist approach to Hegel’s philosophy. Indeed, the Hegelian view of art I develop here applies to the present in large part because the Hegelian view of rationality does not. It is hardly the Hegelian vision of an upward dialectical trajectory from Sense to Reason that connects the past to the present. If anything, we are witnessing the retreat of the universal to increasingly localized and diversified centers of discourse. The present is entrenched in the politics of perception. Accordingly, the philosophical problem of subjectivity that preoccupied Hegel has evolved into the sociopolitical problem of cultural identity, a problem in which the tensions between perception and reason resurface in new forms. No longer compelled by the cosmopolitan ideal, the modern subject seems to have returned to, and indeed embraced, the provincial origins in which its distinctive identity is forged. This is not to cast any value judgments on the present state of things, but simply to register its impact on contemporary conceptions of selfhood. For better or worse, the\n\n4 4 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nreality today is that we navigate a path to self-understanding through a complex maze of imagery, narrative, symbolism, and appearance. Verdicts are cast, policies shaped, lawsuits filed, headlines made, protests ignited, elections won and lost, even political leaders toppled—all on the strength of identity-based allegiances and interests. The social negotiation of one’s distinctive identity takes place within a public sphere that now extends well into spheres of existence once considered “private” (race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, etc.) and thus outside the scope of proper sociopolitical life. Moreover, this happens through new platforms such as the internet, social media, the entertainment industry, etc.—each of which heavily mediate the form and substance of the negotiation process in significant ways. In order to accommodate the emergence of modern forms of identity, we must be willing to rethink not only the scope of the public sphere as comprising multiple “subaltern counterpublics” (to use Nancy Fraser’s term),41 but also its modus operandi, by giving serious consideration to nontraditional, nondiscursive modes of communication and participation. The cultural turn also requires that we rethink the aesthetic dimension of art’s relation to identity. Despite the critique of the Kantian avant-garde tradition in aesthetic theory, it is worth emphasizing that this does not mean the rejection of Kantian aesthetics tout court. The revisionist reading of Hegel that I bring to the discussion of contemporary art explicitly resists the familiar dichotomy between the supposedly pure aestheticism of Kant and the supposedly heavy-handed cognitivism of Hegel upon which the story of modern aesthetics is typically premised. Instead, the arguments throughout the book are grounded in what I call the “continuity thesis,” according to which the key insights of Hegel’s aesthetics are better understood as an extension and development of, rather than an alternative to, the\n\nThe Cultur al Turn Z 45\n\naesthetic of Kant. On my reading, Kant is not oblivious to the social, political, and cultural significance of art, nor Hegel to the value of aesthetic experience uncorrupted by instrumental ends. Indeed, I argue it is on fundamentally Kantian premises that Hegel takes the reflexive experience of art to be uniquely bound up with the process of situating oneself in one’s social, historical, and cultural context. Even more precisely, Hegel takes from Kant’s brief and idiosyncratic but fruitful account of fine art in §§45–53 of the Critique of Judgment the recognition that the aesthetic experience of art is sufficiently distinctive to warrant further inquiry. The continuity thesis thus informs the account of aesthetic experience I develop in chapter 3, where I expand on the phenomenological distinction between natural and artistic beauty initially introduced by Kant. But it is particularly relevant to the discussion of aesthetic imagination and interpretation that I take up in detail in the final chapter. There, I begin by addressing two major concerns raised in the context of the discussion of aesthetic reflexivity—one concerning the political, the other concerning the aesthetic. The first—a version of a familiar political critique of cultural politics—is that the aesthetic, so understood, serves only to accelerate the fracturing of the social world into distinct and incommensurable spheres of value and experience—the “balkanization” of identity, as it were. The other concern is that the sociopolitical ends of identity art threaten the imaginative freedom and interpretive richness that rightly belong to the aesthetic experience of art. I’ll address both concerns by developing a more fine-grained articulation of aesthetic reflexivity as an imaginative exchange between the particular and general forms of human experience and perspective. In this way, I’ll aim to show how the account of aesthetic reflexivity connects the political value of art to its aesthetic value: by showing us both the\n\n46 Y The Cultur al Turn\n\nparticular element in humanity, as well as the human element in particularity. This account begins with a much-needed reevaluation of the well-known “end of art” thesis in Hegel, whereby the significance of modern art, liberated from its religio-mythological function, consists in its representation of the particularity of identity in conjunction with a recognition of shared human experience. The political upshot of this view is that art simultaneously solicits imaginative engagement with radically different cultural perspectives while also revealing the limits of the aesthetic imagination in relation to an individual’s particular experiential context. Race, ethnicity, gender, and the like appear in works of art, not as fixed stable concepts, but as perspectives to be taken up imaginatively. For the same reason, the aesthetic upshot of this view is that engaging with works of art framed around such issues can offer an imaginative and interpretive framework in which meaning is constructed reflexively through various experiential contexts. I take this view to be more consistent with Kant’s discussion of aesthetic ideas than the mandate for radical conceptual indeterminacy fashionable among many Kant-inspired theories of art. Works of art need not eschew conceptual content or sociopolitical motive to yield deeply engaging imaginative and interpretive possibilities. What is aesthetically engaging about the works of Kara Walker, Kiki Smith, Nikki Giovanni, Edgar Heap of Birds, Robert Mapplethorpe, and countless others, is not that they enable infinitely expandable interpretive and imaginative possibilities, but rather that they guide reception to conceptual content and ask the spectator to contend with it as aesthetic representation. Naturally, one has to be skeptical of any ab"
