The translations are 'best attempts' at deciphering the records.\n\nGeburten und Taufen\n\n(Birth and Baptism)\n\n~Contributors notes: My mom and I found this page (above) in the archives at the Waseca Co. (MN) Historical Society. My family are the Menke listings in this baptism records page. I've heard from others that the St. John's Lutheran Church have fallen into tatters and the pages are completely mixed up now. Fortunately, they have been microfilmed & are at the Evangelical Lutheran Church Archives in Chicago\n\n~Contributed by Kathy Hines\n\n~*~*~*~\n\nGeburten und Taufen\n\n(Birth and Baptism)\n\n1855\n\n~*~*~\n\nGeburten und Taufen\n\n(Birth and Baptism)\n\n1856 & 1857\n\n~*~*~\n\n~source: St. John's church, Guttenberg, Record Book of Births and Baptisms\n\n~photocopies of original records made during a visit to Guttenberg on Oct 8, 2001 by Keith Schrader & copies of microfilmed church records from Kathy Hines\n\n~contributed by Keith Schroder & Kathy Hines\n\n~Keith's notes:\n\n1) I have a Dubbels - Rippe couple in my file that could be the parents of the Dubbels entry in the above image. Heinrich Dubbels born Bet. 1810 & 1819 in Germany, died 1855 in Guttenberg. Rosetta Ribbe born Nov 29, 1818 in Linsburg, WÃ¶lpe Co., Hanover, Germany, died Sep 16, 1902 in Preston, Neb. Heinrich & Rosetta were married between 1837 and 1841 in Cincinatti, Ohio. They are listed in the 1852 State census in Jefferson Twp., Clayton County. Their children were Henry, William, Rosetta, John, Anna M., Carl and an unnamed infant. 'Carl' was born 1855 or 1856, and died in Nov 1856.\n\n2) The Schweikert entry may be for the John & W. Schaweikert family enumerated in Jefferson twp on the 1860 US census. They have a 5 year-old son Wm. shown on that census."
