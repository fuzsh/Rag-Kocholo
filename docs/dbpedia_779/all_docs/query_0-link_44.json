I worked on it steadily for several years, and during that time encountered many people who were not only enthusiastic supporters of the project, but also willing helpers in the search for information. Most I have never met in person, but our email and phone conversations were often exhilarating and always helpful. April Streeter, who is writing a novel about Louise Armaindo, shared interesting tidbits from her research. I owe much to Gherardo Bonini at the European University Institute in Italy, and to Dag Hammar, a cycling historian in Sweden, for their support and willingness to provide me with newspaper articles and photos, and best of all, for their helpful advice. I did meet Lorne Shields, who became a friend. He has amassed one of the finest collections of all things related to the bicycle, and his knowledge of bicycle history is unsurpassed. I sought his advice countless times. Along with cycling historian John Weiss, he was always on the lookout for interesting bicycle ephemera and archival photos, some of which are included in this book. One of their finds was the delightful poster used on the book’s cover. It was painstakingly scanned and digitally restored by Paula Aurini-Onderwater. A project like this depends on the many archivists and reference librarians who kindly and expediently answer inquiries. I am in debt to those who assisted me at the following institutions: American Antiquarian Society; Bancroft Library, University of California Berkeley;\n\nx\n\nack now ledgments\n\nBenson Ford Research Center, The Henry Ford; Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec; Bibliothèque nationale de France; Brooklyn Public Library; Canada Science and Technology Museum; Granger Historical Picture Archive; Heinz History Center, Pittsburgh; Kentucky Historical Society; Library of Congress; Maine Historical Society; Minnesota Historical Society; Nevada Historical Society; Stephen H.

I am grateful to the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation at the University of Alberta, my intellectual home for more than fifty years, for their ongoing support of my research, and especially for providing a grant to the publisher for this book. It has been a pleasure to work with the team at McGill-Queen’s University Press, and in particular editor Kyla Madden. Finally, there are two members of my family to whom I owe a huge debt. My sister, Nancy Mitchell, used her unsurpassed genealogical skills to hunt down background information about many of the individuals in this story. Where I gave up the search, she persisted until we had a verifiable account. Jane Haslett, my partner for more than thirty years, is used to sharing our life with my latest research project, and she does so willingly. She is also a superb editor, and as always, this is a better book because of her suggestions.\n\nMu s c l e o n Wh e e l s\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe girl was small and compact. Her legs were rather thicker than beauty demanded, and if you had touched them you would have found their sheaths of muscle as hard as steel. Though she was the greatest woman athlete that ever lived, there was nothing masculine about Louise Armaindo except the toughness of her body. Her smile was alluringly white toothed and her dark eyes full of sex-appeal … though that was a day before feminine fascination had so obvious a label attached to it. In Louise Armaindo’s business sex-appeal was of assistance in the box-office, but was of no help in her actual work. She doubled in brass, so to speak, as a weight-lifter, bicycle rider and long-distance walker … and was better than most men at any of those jobs. Jack Kofoed, Thrills in Sport\n\nIn a 1931 syndicated column, “Thrills in Sports,” sportswriter Jack Kofoed wrote admiringly about Louise Armaindo and wondered what happened to her.1 Kofoed was following in the footsteps of sports journalist and historian Frank G. Menke, who was the first to claim Louise Armaindo as the greatest woman athlete who ever lived. Few men, he argued, could match her in all-around physical powers. In a syndicated column in 1922, published in over three hundred newspapers throughout\n\n4\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nNorth America, Menke sketched her accomplishments as circus acrobat, pedestrienne, and high-wheel bicycle racer. “Fear,” he wrote, “was entirely foreign to her. She did not know its meaning. And she was forever trying something new and novel in the way of athletics.”2 By the mid1880s Louise was at the height of her athletic career, but by the beginning of the new century she had disappeared from public view. Few realized she was no longer alive, nor did anyone seem to care. When Menke’s column appeared, she had long since been forgotten, and he too seemed unaware that she had died more than two decades ago. By the time Kofoed got around to writing about her, likely no one reading had heard about her. In his comprehensive Encyclopedia of Sports, first published in 1939, Menke did not mention Louise, nor did he in subsequent editions.3 Occasionally, an enterprising sports reporter would remember Louise, such as the one who wondered how the “greatest all-around female woman athlete of all time” – namely, Mildred “Babe” Didrickson – would stack up against Louise Armaindo in her prime.4 It was difficult to judge how Louise would have fared in modern competition, argued the writer, because there were no Olympic Games for women in her day; moreover, golf and tennis were much too tame for the rugged tastes of the “little French-Canadian lass.” Rather, he suggested, Louise might have preferred a backfield berth with a “big-league” professional football club. Today, nearly 140 years after Louise became a marvel of athletic strength, talent, and endurance, she continues to be ignored not only by cycling historians but also by those who write about women’s sport history. There are scattered, though often inaccurate, references to Louise, but nothing of substance.5 As a French Canadian, she has not been included among the histories of famous, sometimes forgotten, athletes from Quebec. In 1909, Montreal journalist and archivist Édouard-Zotique Massicotte published a book containing the biographies of over fifty French Canadian athletes and sportsmen since the eighteenth century. Among them was only one woman: Marie-Louise Sirois (1867–1920), a strongwoman, who married fellow Quebec strongman Henri Cloutier.6 The more recently published Dictionnaire des grands oubliés du sport au Québec 1850–1950, which contains 283 biographies of forgotten in-\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\ndividuals in Quebec sport – athletes, journalists, physical educators, administrators, and promoters – makes no mention of Louise Armaindo.7 I became interested in Louise Armaindo because she was Canadian, and certainly among Canada’s first women professional athletes. For more than fifteen years, beginning in the late 1870s, she travelled extensively throughout the United States, rarely returning to Canada, even though press reports usually noted that she was French Canadian and from Montreal. She received a brief mention in two of my previous books about the history of women’s sport in Canada.8 With frustratingly little information to go on, I decided that she deserved a book of her own. Tracking Louise Armaindo throughout the last two decades of the nineteenth century led me to examine the high-wheel era more closely; as a result, I discovered many more women who raced. Like her, several began their racing careers as professional endurance walkers or pedestriennes. They had already experienced the rigours of incessant travel, poor living conditions, and men who claimed to be agents or trainers, yet more often than not took their hard earned money, or worse still abused them physically, even sexually. There were probably about twenty women in the United States who were professional high-wheel bicycle racers during the 1880s and 1890s. Of these, approximately eight also raced safety bicycles from 1895 onwards until their competitive careers ended. We have little information about these women racers or how gender (and to a lesser extent social class) operated in the high-wheel era. By and large these women athletes have not been taken seriously by cycling historians, and they are often dismissed as the “kind of low-class show-business chicanery that amateur organizations sought to purge from sport.”9 In his social history of the bicycle, Robert Smith begins each of his thirteen chapters with the reproduction of an advertising card depicting a female on a bicycle, more than half of whom were atop a high wheel.10 These scantily clad women portrayed trick riders in titillating poses designed to appeal to men. The twenty-five cards were issued by the American Tobacco Company in the early 1890s to advertise their chewing and smoking tobacco.11 Smith also included the famous Waverley Belle Cycles advertisement depicting a woman from behind, naked except for shoes and knee-length stockings, her left arm behind her head with her\n\n6\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nright arm holding a “Kangaroo” bicycle, a geared safety version of a high wheel. There is no mention of women who raced the high wheel, though he does include an unidentified photo of Elsa von Blumen, a racing contemporary of Louise Armaindo. To be fair, his book contains a wide variety of illustrations depicting bicycle history, including various outfits worn by women when safety bicycles first became popular in the mid-1890s. Nonetheless, those reading the book today would be left with the impression that women who rode high wheels were nothing more than exhibitionist trick riders or circus performers. Some indeed were, but many more were serious, professional athletes. Only recently have sport historians turned their attention to in-depth explorations of women’s professional sports in nineteenth-century North America – what sport historian Roberta Park called “contesting the norm.”12 Mostly, these athletes were pedestriennes, high-wheel and safety bicycle racers, wrestlers, boxers, shooters, and baseball players. This research allows us to examine similarities and differences between sports and the women who competed in them. In Bloomer Girls, for example, Debra Shattuck meticulously reconstructs a forgotten era of women’s professional baseball in the United States from the 1860s into the 1890s. The earliest spectacles of women’s baseball were best described as “burlesque al fresco,” a form of satirical, theatrical comedy performed outdoors by players who lacked the athletic skills to play the game properly. Audiences were primarily working-class men, although women and children were encouraged to attend to provide an air of respectability. Promoters and sports reporters emphasized the femininity of the players with performances advertised as wholesome family entertainment. Despite condemnation, especially from the male baseball fraternity, women’s professional teams continued to multiply in the 1880s and 1890s because scores of young, working-class women saw an opportunity to earn a living away from the drudgery of waitressing, laundering, sewing, or domestic servitude. Unfortunately, they were routinely exploited by unscrupulous managers whose sole purpose was to make money off their young charges.13 In this respect, they were no different to the strongwomen, pedestriennes, bicycliennes, and boxers, but those athletes, unlike the baseball players, required serious athletic talent, perseverance, and endurance to\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nbe successful. Through their performances they contested and challenged the prevailing gender norms in late nineteenth-century America, and as a result they helped to encourage a more assertive Victorian physicality, especially among women.14 Were these women athletes competing in sport, or were their efforts strictly for the entertainment of a primarily male audience? To bicycle historians, these events were nothing more than risqué, exploitative commercial spectacles, rather than meaningful athletic events. Certainly novel, they lacked genuine competition, and it was the promoter who benefitted and not necessarily the athlete. This may be true, but the occurrence of these events should be placed within the larger context of the burgeoning entertainment industry of nineteenth-century America, which began to employ more and more women. The circus created the first truly national depiction of women at work as seen by an audience of women, men, and children.15 Circuses celebrated female power, especially physical strength, risk, and sexuality, and they also expanded notions about Victorian women’s capabilities and appropriate work. Louise Armaindo began her professional athletic career in the circus as a strongwoman and trapeze artist in the 1870s. Pedestrianism, which she took up next, provided more opportunities for working-class women to perform before large audiences and earn a living, precarious as it was, through their athleticism.16 A common misperception is that women first took up cycling in the mid- to late 1880s with the advent of the chain-driven safety bicycle, made even more comfortable with the invention of pneumatic tires. In fact, women have been riding, and occasionally racing, some form of the bicycle since the first vélocipèdes (literally “quick foot”) appeared in Europe early in the nineteenth century. Also called draisines (after inventor Karl von Drais) or hobbyhorses, velocipedes were similar to present-day bicycles except that they were propelled by pushing off the ground with one foot and then the other. Balance was an issue, but young ice skaters took to them easily. A special model for ladies was marketed, though unsuccessfully, with a lower horizontal bar to accommodate flowing dresses. These early bicycles were impractical for daily use because they were expensive and it was impossible to ride them safely on rough roads or carriageways already occupied by horses. Since\n\n8\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nsidewalks were the only other option, magistrates and city officials were forced to ban them to protect pedestrians. Although velocipedes had arrived in the United States by 1819, they were soon prohibited in larger cities like New York and Philadelphia. For the next forty years, these early velocipedes and their three- and four-wheeled cousins remained largely a British preoccupation, and only occasionally were there reports of their use in North America.17 A pedal-powered velocipede propelled by a crank attached to the front axle was developed in France in the 1860s. International visitors to the 1867 Paris Exhibition saw these velocipedes in action and were sufficiently impressed to bring home glowing reports, perhaps even a few velocipedes. Aptly called “boneshakers,” the original versions had wooden wheels with iron hoop tires, but later models had rubber or leather coverings over the metal. Still, they were a rough ride, especially over hard, uneven surfaces. They too were expensive, costing anywhere between $75 and $150, which meant that only the well-off could afford the new-fangled machine.18 By 1869 major American cities experienced velocipede mania, and riding schools, often in converted ice or roller skating rinks, sprung up everywhere. Handbooks appeared describing the varieties of velocipedes, their history, how to ride and manage them, and often a section addressed to “ladies.” Velocipedes for females – at least some can be identified as earlier versions of a “women’s bicycle” – were invented and patented. One developed by a New York company had a frame following the curve of the front wheel and running horizontally to the rear axle. The two wheels were close together and between them was a spiral spring, on top of which was a comfortable, willow-backed chair-seat.19 Although most women wanted “a little risk and dash which attends the riding of the two-wheeled velocipede,” some preferred a three-wheeled velocipede tricycle because it was more stable and did not require a special costume.20 In Canada, velocipede rinks and riding academies were established in Toronto, Kingston, Montreal, and Halifax, but there was less enthusiasm for this new machine.21 An editorial in the Globe called it a rich man’s toy that would never become popular: “In Toronto, we fancy that few people would care to run a velocipede over the rough and\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ndirty macadamized streets, and the machines will be driven off the sidewalks if by their number they should prove a nuisance.”22 A month later, a clearly peeved editorialist complained, “We object very strongly to being ridden down by inexperienced and inebriated youths, who appear to select the most crowded thoroughfares in which to exhibit their want of proficiency.”23 Cities and towns, not just in Canada but also throughout North America, introduced bylaws prohibiting the riding of velocipedes on sidewalks. Unsuitable for rough roads and banned from pedestrian routes, velocipedes were relegated to a few indoor rinks, which were increasingly dependent on riders performing tricks and stunts to stay in business. Did women race velocipedes? On 1 November 1868, in a local park in the French city of Bordeaux, four women known only as Mlles Louise, Julie, Louisa, and Amélie took part in a five-hundred-metre velocipede race attended by thousands of curious onlookers. In a sketch published in Le Monde illustré, the women were “coquettishly” dressed in short skirts or puffy shorts with their stocking-covered legs visible.24 Mlle Julie won the close race and a gold watch for her efforts. A few weeks later, when the same race was reported by the American publication Harper’s Weekly, the women’s legs were mysteriously covered up.25 Clearly, what to wear while riding a velocipede, especially where speed was important, was a fraught issue. Many people, mostly male, offered an opinion. The French journalist Richard Lesclide, who published a velocipede manual under the pseudonym of Le Grand Jacques, recommended a peaked cap, short blouse, belt, and pants tucked into halfhigh boots even though it might give the wearer an air of “hooliganism.” Short skirts without crinolines would be more suitable, and on the question of whether to “show leg,” the journalist equivocated but made it clear that exposed legs should be shapely.26 Women’s velocipede races in France began as novel events, and it was sometimes difficult to attract contestants, but soon there was a small coterie of adept riders who enlivened the French racing circuit as part of the growing sports-entertainment industry. Female velocipedists also performed in the Hippodrome, a wooden stadium holding up to 15,000 spectators, in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. On 7 November 1869, a\n\nI.1 Top Women’s velocipede race in Bordeaux, France, Le Monde illustré, 21 November 1868 (Bibliothèque nationale de France) I.2 Bottom Women’s legs were covered when reprinted in Harper’s Weekly, 19 December 1868 (Granger)\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\n“Miss America,” who was the wife of Rowley B. Turner, the Paris agent for a British manufacturer of velocipedes, became the only woman to complete the 123-kilometre long-distance race between Paris and Rouen. With a reputation as a fierce competitor, she came twenty-ninth among a field of more than a hundred starters.27 There is less evidence of women’s velocipede races in North America during this period, and if they occurred, it was usually as part of an entertainment spectacle created by a promoter to make money. Carrie Augusta Moore, a well-known and accomplished ice and roller skater, and widely publicized “Skatorial Queen,” also gained a reputation as the “Velocipede Queen.” On one occasion in the Jersey City Velocipedrome, Moore was complimented on her exhibition of graceful roller skating, but when she demonstrated her velocipede racing skills against W.H. Darling, a male competitor, the New York Times pronounced that “velocipede races for lady riders are out of place and anything but attractive.”28 As far as public opinion was concerned, Moore fared much better when she demonstrated her ability to perform a gymnastic routine while riding her bicycle.29 Incredibly, she would pick up two chairs, one in each hand, and carry them around the room; make figure eights and curves without using her hands; circumvent the room without using her hands or feet; and stand with one foot on the saddle while passing a hoop over her head. Similar performances by Edith Shuler of Chicago enthralled audiences in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with the added attraction of riding double with a male velocipedist.30 These infrequent accounts of women racing and performing on velocipedes, in the open air or in the urban skating rinks and velocipede halls of major European and American cities, can be viewed as progressive and genuine athletic contests. Spectators, both male and female, flocked to these indoor shows not only for thrilling entertainment, but also because they provided an opportunity to see the much talked-about velocipede in action. These performances, considered to be risqué and sensational by some, showcased women’s skill, athletic prowess, and exertion, something usual at the time. They were also the forerunner to the high-wheel bicycle races that followed. The majestic high-wheel bicycle with spider wheels and rubber tires emerged in the mid-1870s as the standard bicycle. Popularly nicknamed\n\n12\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\na “penny-farthing” in Britain because of the relative sizes of the large front and small back wheels, it was also called an “ordinary” to distinguish it from other types of bicycles. First introduced to an American audience in 1876 at Philadelphia’s world fair, it was soon imported and then manufactured by Albert Pope of Boston, and his Columbia brand became the most popular. The new configuration went considerably faster than the clumsy velocipede because it was lighter and had a larger front wheel that covered more ground for every pedal stroke. Since it proved fairly roadworthy, the high wheel also became recreationally popular, especially among athletic, well-off young men. The large-circumference front wheel, padded with a rubber tire, effectively absorbed shocks while suspending the rider above the dust of unpaved roads. Unfortunately, it was also susceptible to cross winds, and an unseen bump could throw a rider flying. The difficulties of mounting and dismounting, especially as the front wheel became larger, were made somewhat easier by a small step to the left side of the frame just over the rear wheel. Mounting was accomplished by the rider putting his or her foot on the step and vaulting into the saddle from behind. Cycling historians often characterize the high-wheel era as masculinized and the safety era as feminized.31 The social impact of the high wheel, they argue, was unequivocally in favour of men because women were effectively excluded from high-wheeling activities, except in the most marginal sense of participating in bicycle club social functions. Indeed, Charles Pratt, the founder of the League of American Wheelmen, wrote in his 1879 manual for club cyclists, “As a sport, bicycling is manly, innocent, humane, and rational … It is pre-eminently a gentlemanly recreation, a refined sport. It is pursued by noblemen and right honorables abroad, and by nature’s nobility in our own untitled land.” Professional high-wheel racing, he maintained, is ungentlemanly with all the “excesses and cruelties, which are so often objectionably attended upon boxing, billiards, trotting, pedestrian races, and other public exhibitions of physical training or endurance.”32 Cycling historians also insist that Victorian women, and by this they usually mean bourgeois women, did not ride the high wheel “partly because Victorian dress and behaviour codes made it virtually impos-\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nsible for a woman to ride one, and partly because the men engaged in the sport constructed activities as acts of male bonding, often surrounded by militaristic trappings.”33 There were, according to them, very few exceptions and if there were, they were to be found in the circus and theatre, where the normal codes of Victorian conduct were waived. In a book about how the bicycle reshaped American life, the author writes that women on high wheels were “acrobats, hussies, or freaks,” and that one early performer was seen as a “sort of semimonster.”34 In a curious footnote, bicycle historian Glen Norcliffe states, “For instance, Mlle Louise Armaino [sic] of Montreal is depicted in the Wheelmen’s Gazette of 1885 racing a high bicycle as part of what seems to be an ‘entertainment.’”35 Although some women enjoyed riding an adult-size tricycle, the introduction of the rear-driven safety bicycle in the late 1880s brought about the so-called feminization of the bicycle as more and more women took to riding. The problem with this dichotomization of “masculinist” versus “feminized” in terms of the social history of the bicycle is that it does not make a distinction between a bicycling era and the bicycle itself. As we have seen, bicycling from the early days of the velocipede was not necessarily a gendered activity. However, the bicycle itself was a gendered object, and unless otherwise stated, bicycles were effectively male.36 Since their invention, bicycles have been gendered in order to accommodate women riders with long skirts. The problem with the high wheel was that it was almost impossible to mount and ride wearing a long skirt. It simply was not safe. As one commentator of the day argued, If any daring person inquires why ladies cannot ride the bicycle, he must address the inquiry not to Nature, which has interposed no objection, but to the same irrational conventionalism which has decreed to the female equestrian an ungraceful, inconvenient side-saddle and a trailing robe that make her helpless while in her seat and endanger her life as soon as unseated … Give her – or, rather let her dare to take – for the occasion, not that terrible Bloomer, but some modification of sensible gymnasium or short dress, and she will quickly adapt it to satisfy all requirements of\n\n14\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\ndelicacy and grace, and will thus be able to mount this swift steed now awaiting her – a steed which fits well enough the Naturewoman, but cannot unmake itself to fit skirt-civilization.37 Some manufacturers tried to create a women’s version of the high wheel where the rider sat lower, further back, and side-saddle, but the model was quickly abandoned.38 It was not until the rear-driven safety bicycle came on the market, especially the diamond-frame design, that the high crossbar designated a male bicycle, whereas a dropped bar signalled a female machine. The point is that there was nothing other than clothing restrictions preventing women from riding the high wheel, and if their costumes were suitable, like those of the women high-wheel racers, then it was entirely possible. Even feminist historians of cycling often assume that the high-wheel era was masculine and the safety era was feminine. For example, Sarah Hallenbeck in Claiming the Bicycle considers the role of women’s rhetorical activities (ranging from bicycle seats to bloomers to short stories) in the transformation of bicycle culture and the bicycle itself. Although she makes a brief mention of Louise Armaindo and also her contemporary Elsa von Blumen, who, according to Hallenbeck, “gained notoriety,” she also states that they received little attention outside the cycling press and they raced primarily before male audiences.39 As I demonstrate in this book, neither of these assumptions is true. Moreover, the continuing characterization of the high-wheel era as masculine and the safety era as feminine ignores obvious class divisions and renders women’s incredible athletic activity in the high-wheel era invisible. The tale told here is but a small slice of cycling history. Louise Armaindo was the first highly successful woman high-wheel racer, and as a result, she raced primarily against men (and occasionally horses). She became one of the guys, so to speak, because they were her constant companions wherever she travelled, raced, and lived. As more women entered the sport and female-only races became possible, Louise was challenged by younger girls and women. Ignored by the male racing fraternity, who no longer wished to race against her, she was more often than not beaten on the track by these female upstarts. Late in her career, the professional cycling racing culture that Louise helped to\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\ncreate evolved as new technology took hold in the form of the more stable and ultimately faster safety bicycle. Proud of her skill on the high wheel and scornful of the chain-driven safety, Louise never raced one. By the mid-1890s, the high-wheel era of cycling history had come to an end, and so too had the racing career of Louise Armaindo. The story emerges chronologically beginning with what little is known about Louise’s background as a French Canadian from a small community near Montreal, and how, as a young woman seeking employment, she ended up in Chicago in the late 1870s. Initially, she performed as a strongwoman and trapeze artist, possibly in a circus, until she discovered the sport of pedestrianism, the earliest form of endurance race walking. Louise became a pedestrienne, and along with fellow Canadian Thomas Eck, she set out to earn a living by travelling and giving pedestrian exhibitions in small American towns. Chapter 2 explores the world of female pedestrianism in more depth as dozens of working-class women, including Canadians Mary Marshall, Exilda Lachapelle, Louise Armaindo, and others, took to walking for money throughout the United States. In the late 1870s several pedestriennes, including Louise, learned to ride the high-wheel bicycle and began to race (chapter 3). Among her contemporaries was Elsa von Blumen, who raced trotting horses, and initially was not interested in competing against Louise. The next three chapters (4, 5, and 6) explore Louise’s adventures as a high-wheel racer from 1883 until the end of 1888, when she raced primarily male professionals such as Tom Eck, John Prince, William Woodside, William Morgan, and Henry Higham. Although she was the preeminent female racer in the United States, she was in essence one of the fellows, living and travelling with them as they performed throughout the country. Sports promoters realized that women’s high-wheel races could be popular and lucrative if only there were riders skilled enough to race. Chapter 7 describes the entrance of many more women into the world of high-wheel racing such as Lulu Gordon (who became Frankie Nelson), Lottie Stanley, Jessie Oakes, May Allen, Helen Baldwin, and others. Louise, still determined to race men, initially ignored these women, but eventually it was worth her while to race and travel with them, although by the late 1880s she was considerably older than these young newcomers. The 1890s brought the pneumatic-tire safety bicycles and\n\n16\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nthe end of the high-wheel era. Thousands of women took to riding the newer bicycles. Chapter 8 explores the problems the bicycle craze posed for women racers as they struggled to find opportunities to compete against a tide of criticism. Louise refused to switch to racing a safety; her career dwindled, and then was brought to a halt by personal tragedy. The epilogue provides a brief summary of women’s cycle racing in the United States after Louise Armaindo involuntarily retired from the track. The reader also learns what eventually happened to the two central characters in this story, namely, Armaindo and Tom Eck. This book is also about gender and the history of cycling. By this I mean a history of cycling that takes gender and gender relations centrally into account. Often, this translates into a singular focus on women, but bringing men more fully into the story of women’s sport is intended “to prompt more careful discussion of gendered collaboration in how sport has been performed.”40 Louise’s story, as well as those of other women high-wheel racers, cannot be told without reference to the many men who controlled this sport during the latter part of the nineteenth century, especially in the United States. They were the racers, managers, trainers, agents, and bookmakers. They were also the administrators in amateur sport organizations like the League of American Wheelmen (law), and the editors and reporters of influential cycling magazines such as the Boston-based Bicycling World. The lives of these women, at least while they raced, were controlled almost entirely by men, some caring and responsible, and others not so much. Issues of race, gender, and race relations, although important, are not discussed here for several reasons. There is little evidence that people of colour, specifically blacks, participated in cycling during the high-wheel era.41 As discussed previously, it was white, middle-class, young men in major urban centres who rode the high-wheel, primarily for recreation, through their bicycle clubs. Those who raced were typically amateurs, and as the sport developed a few professionals earned a living through impromptu races, exhibitions, and eventually an organized racing circuit. There is no evidence at all that women of colour in the United States or Canada raced a high-wheel bicycle. Moreover, in the 1880s these machines were expensive and beyond the reach of anyone without means, though professional racers were often supplied with bicycles.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nIt was not until the safety bicycle era in the 1890s that race became a contentious issue in cycling. The cheaper, often second-hand, easier to ride safeties opened the sport to thousands more enthusiasts, including women and blacks. Cycling clubs sprang up across the continent, some exclusively for women, and in the segregated United States, all-black and by implication all-white clubs emerged. Professional cyclists were already denied any form of membership in the law, although determining a professional as opposed to an amateur was always a prickly issue. As more women took up cycling, the law slowly welcomed them into its ranks. In 1892 a mere 2.6 per cent of the total law membership was female.42 It was also forced to grapple with two additional issues: whether to accept “colored” cyclists and all-black cycling clubs as members, and whether to allow black racers in races sponsored or sanctioned by the law.43 In February 1894, after much debate and several aborted attempts, primarily because of opposition from more northern states, the law instituted a ban on “colored” membership.44 The Canadian Wheelmen’s Association, established in 1882, though it often followed the law’s lead on many issues, did not introduce a similar colour ban. Kittie Knox was a twenty-year-old biracial cyclist associated with the Riverside Cycle Club, the major “colored” cycling organization in Boston. She was also a member in good standing of the law, and had a membership card to prove it. In July 1895, along with other Boston cyclists, Knox travelled to Asbury Park, New Jersey, to take part in the law’s annual week-long meet. When she registered at the meet, she was refused due to the law’s recently approved “color line.” Sadly, a few of the leading women cyclists threaten to leave the law should Knox remain a member. In the end, Knox was not ousted from the meet, nor did she withdraw. However, despite considerable controversy and publicity over the incident, the law did not change its racist policy.45 At the same time, Marshall “Major” Taylor, a superbly talented black racer from Indianapolis, began to dominate his white rivals, first as an amateur and then a professional, on the cycle racing tracks of America and Europe. Although the law banned black membership, Taylor could still race in law-sanctioned meets, and in 1896 he received his professional licence from the Racing Board. However, this did not mean his struggle for the right to race was over; in fact, it intensified.\n\n18\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nAlthough some white racers accepted Taylor with good grace, there were many who did not by conspiring to exclude him from victory through physical intimidation, verbal insults, and harassment both on and off the track. Taylor persevered and became one of the most successful cyclists of all time.46 Kittie Knox and Marshall Taylor had probably never heard of Louise Armaindo because her racing career was over by the time they were just starting. Unquestionably, however, she was la mère du cyclisme féminin, the mother of women’s cycling.47 She rode only a high wheel, well before the Victorian women safety racers appeared in North America and Europe in the mid-1890s. Her legacy goes back almost 140 years. Early in her career, she raced primarily men, and later increasingly more women, on either crude indoor or rough outdoor tracks. Her racing accomplishments are astounding. Most surprising is the fact that she is rarely recognized for her pioneering role in women’s cycling, in Quebec, in Canada, and generally in the world of women’s professional cycling. My hope is that this book will change all that.\n\nc hap t e r o n e\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s Who was Louise Armaindo? Her real name was Louise or Louisa Brisbois (also spelled as Brisebois). We know this for certain because when Louise married, she was identified as “Louisa Brisbois” on the marriage record.1 Discovering her origins has not been easy, and what we know is not definitive. Given the very few clues provided through interviews Louise gave during her athletic career, and the fact that she frequently lied about her age, we may never be certain of her background. One of the problems with historical research related to circus performers and other athlete-entertainers is that not only did they adopt stage names; they also created stage biographies that often embellished the truth about their backgrounds. Why Louise chose the name Armaindo is a complete mystery, but tracking her digital footprints some 140 years later became a little easier because it was such an unusual one. There are some consistencies in the information provided in these interviews and other articles about Louise’s background.2 Most important is the fact that she was French Canadian, and that she spoke both French and English, the latter with an accent. According to one article, she was born on 12 October 1860 in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Jacques Cartier County, on the westernmost tip of the Island of Montreal, Quebec.3 She also claimed never to have been an amateur athlete, and at fourteen years of age decided to become a professional by following in the footsteps of her mother, a professional strongwoman. Louise was proud of stating\n\n20\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nthat when her mother was twenty-one, she lifted 900 pounds dead weight. By the time Louise herself was eighteen and performing as a strongwoman, she could lift 760 pounds. She also trained as a trapeze artist before she took up pedestrianism (endurance walking), and finally high-wheel bicycle racing. “It will be a matter of wonder to many how this girl can endure so much fatigue,” wrote a Chicago newspaper reporter, “but it should be taken into account that she is a trained athlete and gymnast, being a trapeze performer and capable of putting up a ninety-pound dumbbell many times in succession.”4 He also explained that Louise also had “a regular stage training, or rather circus schooling,” and that she could ride a horse longer than any of the other lady riders of note. One thing we know for certain about Louise’s background is that she was descended from René Dubois dit Brisebois, who immigrated to New France as a French habitant in the seventeenth century, probably around 1658. A few years later he married Anne-Julienne Dumont, who, along with other young, healthy filles du roi (king’s daughters), had been recruited by the French Crown and sent across the ocean to help populate New France. Together René and Anne-Julienne had nine children, including two sons whose descendants eventually settled in the west end of the Island of Montreal. Louise would be among these offspring, but unfortunately there are several Louises, all of whom are cousins of some sort, among a complicated and convoluted web of family interrelationships.5 Identifying the Louise Brisbois who became Louise Armaindo is speculative and probably no better than a best guess. Until a relative or descendant can be found, we may never know for certain the true origin of Louise Brisbois/Armaindo. However, there are a few more clues that help to narrow the genealogical search. One is that Louise’s mother supposedly died at a relatively young age, information that comes from a brief article about Louise published in a German newspaper.6 According to this report, it was after her mother’s death that Louise was sent to a girls’ school in Chicago, which seems improbable given the distance and expense. Another clue is that her father lived to a relatively old age because in an interview in 1889 the reporter made reference to how Louise had made considerable sacrifices to help her “old father” in business. At the\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n21\n\nsame time, Louise mentioned a brother, who, according to her, was one of the most successful divers in the world.7 Louise continually lied about her age and, as she grew older, she was determined to make herself appear younger. As mentioned previously, the only birthdate found in print was 12 October 1860. An intensive genealogical search has turned up no Louise or Louisa Bris(e)bois born in either Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue or Montreal in that year. When she was married in 1888, her age on the church record was listed as twenty-four, which would mean that she was born in 1864. In court records relating to a hotel fire in 1896, in which Louise was seriously injured, she claimed that she was twenty-seven years of age. This would mean that she was born in 1869. Finally, when Louise died on 2 September 1900 and was supposedly buried a few days later in Montreal’s Notre-Dame-des-Neiges cemetery, her age on the burial record was stated as forty-two, which implies that she was born in 1857 or 1858.8 Was this her true age? Given these bits of information, where does this leave us? My best guess is that Louise is the daughter of Charles Brisebois, born in 1830 and a descendant of Jean-Baptiste, son of René Dubois dit Brisebois. In February 1857, Charles married Hélène Brunet in the Ste-Anne-deBellevue parish. A baptismal record dated 14 October 1857 shows that Marie Louise Brisebois was the daughter of Charles and Hélène.9 It is possible, therefore, that her birthdate could be 12 October 1857 because baptism usually occurred shortly after birth. In the 1861 census, Charles (confusingly listed as “Pierre”) was living with his wife Hélène and their children Louise, aged four, and Hélène, aged two. His occupation is noted as voyageur, normally an expert woodsman and boatman employed by a fur trading company to transport goods and supplies. He was also a journalier, which means labourer.10 In 1867 tragedy struck when Charles’s wife died at the age of thirty-two. He immediately married again, this time to Julia Brennan, who was of Irish descent and considerably younger than Charles. Their family eventually consisted of Louise, her younger sister, Hélène (listed as Ellen), and four halfbrothers, Charles, William, Samuel, and Ferdinand. Louise appears in the 1871 census living with her family in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue.11 She is not listed on the 1881 census because she is no longer in Canada. This is confirmed by her appearance in Chicago in March 1879, where she\n\n22\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nwas competing in a pedestrian contest under the name of Louise Armando (likely a misspelling).12 Louise was fond of bragging about her Oncle Joe: “He one gr-r-r-r-rand Frenchman! He so strong it take seex poleesmen to hold hees hat!”13 Joe was not her real uncle, but rather Joseph Montferrand, a larger-than-life Canadien folk hero from Montreal. A giant of a man with legendary strength and agility, he fought in taverns on principle and in the ring for money. He travelled the fur trade routes as a voyageur with the North West Company, but for most of his life he ran rafts and booms as a lumberman on the Ottawa River. Joe Mufferaw or Mufraw were the English versions of his name, and his reputation still resonates in the Ottawa Valley today.14 Although he died in 1864, when Louise was still a child, she no doubt heard stories about him and perhaps idolized him as a champion of Les Canadiens. More importantly, Montferrand had a sister whose name was Hélène. Since Louise’s mother was possibly named Hélène, it made sense for her to imagine that Montferrand could actually have been her uncle. We know nothing of Louise’s childhood, except that “she was always throwing big stones, and seeing how far she could run and jump.”15 If I have found the correct Louise, she would have been ten years old when her mother died in 1867. Four years later, she decided to follow the life of a professional athlete by going into training in a gymnasium. What is unclear is whether she began this training in Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, or in Montreal, or possibly in Chicago. Her father had married again and was enlarging his family so possibly sending his eldest daughter away either to school or to follow her dream of becoming a professional athlete made sense. Why Chicago? There has been a French Canadian presence in Chicago for most of its history. It was Quebec-born Louis Joliet and Jesuit missionary Jacques Marquette, who in 1673 were sent by Jean Talon, the intendant of New France, on an expedition to explore and map the area where Chicago eventually emerged on Lake Michigan. The waterways between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River were essential to fur traders who ventured southwest from Montreal and Quebec City, and the Midwest was a vital component of the French empire in North America. All this changed after the Seven Years’ War in 1763 when France surrendered\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n23\n\nits territories between the Atlantic and the Mississippi to Britain. By the mid-nineteenth century, the city of Chicago had been transformed from a fur-trading outpost to a capitalist town. People streamed to Chicago, called “America’s city,” from all parts of the country seeking employment and a better life. With rail lines coming from every direction, Chicago was a national transportation hub. It was also a bustling metropolis, having been mostly rebuilt after the devastating fire of 1871 that destroyed a third of the city, including the downtown. As it rose again quickly from ashes, the city was grander and statelier than ever.16 Facing intense economic pressure at home, French Canadians began migrating to nearby Kankakee area, where they founded the town of Bourbonnais, and in the 1870s a large number of French Canadian families settled in the Brighton Park area of Chicago.17 Alfred Brisbois, a distant cousin of Louise Brisebois, who became a well-known photographer, was born in Chicago in 1853. His parents moved between Canada and the United States several times, but young Brisbois finished his education in old Sandwich, located along the Canadian border of the Detroit River and now part of the city of Windsor. Although Brisbois tried his hand at several occupations, he finally chose photography, travelling extensively until settling in Leadville, Colorado, where he established his own business. His photographs of American cultural icons Annie Oakley and Buffalo Bill Cody are well known. Brisbois eventually returned to Chicago, where he managed a photographic studio between 1891 and 1900. Whether he was aware of the athletic feats of Louise Brisbois/Armaindo is unknown, and no photographs of Louise taken by him have been unearthed. By 1880 Chicago’s rapidly growing population had reached half a million, and among these were thousands of young women from small towns. They left home primarily to find work, although some sought anonymity in a large city where no one knew them. Over four million women were gainfully employed in the United States by 1880, some 15 per cent of all workers.18 Roughly one in five of these working women lived apart from family and relatives. They were, in the parlance of the day, “women adrift,” a term used to describe Victorian women who were wage earners and did not live with kin or their employers. These women challenged and undermined the Victorian “separation\n\n24\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nof spheres” ethos that segregated women from men and relegated them to the domestic world of the home. When they mingled freely with men in rooming houses, at work, and at places of recreation, they also challenged the perception that all women, single or married, needed the economic and moral protection of family life.19 Canadian women like Louise represented over 10 per cent of foreign-born women adrift, and they were overrepresented in terms of the proportion of Canadians in Chicago in general. Most of these women worked in the needle trades, such as dressmaker or seamstress, and many held service jobs in domestic day work or laundering. Louise presumably escaped these humdrum occupations through her employment in the entertainment world, which, though a rapidly growing industry, provided few opportunities for women. In the late 1870s and into the 1880s, this kind of female employment was minimal because in the 1890 United States census, “actresses, professional show-women, etc.,” accounted for only 4,491 gainfully employed women, a mere 0.12 per cent of all female workers.20 Louise’s trapeze days did not last long, mainly because the pay was meagre and certainly not enough to keep her in the fancy outfits required for performing. Flying high on a trapeze was hard on the nerves and certainly dangerous, so that every week newspapers reported at least one accident resulting in serious injuries and an occasional death. Louise supplemented her small income by performing as a strongwoman, following in her mother’s footsteps. She may have heard of another Canadian strongwoman, Millie De Granville, whose real name was Alma Hayes. Little is known about Hayes’s background other than that she was born in Montreal on 31 May 1852 to parents who came to Quebec from Europe. She worked professionally as a circus performer beginning around 1874, and for the next fifteen years toured with a variety of circuses throughout the United States, even venturing into Mexico and Cuba. Known as the “lady with the jaws of steel,” De Granville was among the first iron jaw artists who performed in North America.21 During her performances she would throw chairs around with her bare teeth, and then daringly twirl on a rope up to the top of the tent supported only by a piece of leather held in her teeth.22 One newspaper commentator was in awe of her feats of strength, but also\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n25\n\nnoted that they were “rather indelicate even for the circus.”23 De Granville’s performances and those of other circus strongwomen generated a female physicality that was fearless, brazen, outrageous, and often broke social taboos.24 Performing as a strongwoman also provided a means to earn a living. No doubt Louise weighed her prospects in this promising line of work, and she had the strength and talent to do so. At the Chicago Athenæum in the spring of 1878, and before a large audience, Louise lifted 760 pounds and had records to prove it. On another occasion a witness saw her lift 750 pounds without a harness or shoulder straps.25 According to yet another report, she could also handle Indian clubs and dumbbells “with a skill that would make some of the sterner sex blush.”26 She is said to have “pressed” a 105-pound dumbbell five times in succession with her right arm and three with her left.27 Many years later, there was a report that at one time she had considerable notoriety as Zoe, the “Human Cannonball.”28 However, all we have now are tidbits of information about Louise’s exploits as a strongwoman, and possible circus performer, because no mention of her name as either Brisbois or Armaindo has been found in the well-documented histories of early North American circuses. The Chicago Athenæum, where Louise performed, was a brand new, four-storey building on Dearborn Street. Created as a philanthropic society to provide relief for victims of the 1871 fire, the Athenæum soon became a community educational centre offering day and evening classes in a wide range of subjects. The new building included commercial stores on the first floor; reading rooms, classrooms, and a library on the second; and on the third and fourth floor was a spacious, welllit, and ventilated gymnasium alongside splendidly equipped dressing rooms, showers, and baths. The gymnasium was the chief attraction of the new facilities allowing the Athenæum to offer courses in physical culture to both sexes and to organize athletic exhibitions. Another important feature of the Athenæum gymnasium was a four-foot wide, oval track, measuring a little over sixteen laps to the mile and designed specifically for pedestrian matches.29 Walking around a flat track, usually indoors, may have seemed easier to Louise than flying around on a trapeze, being shot from a cannon, or even lifting heavy weights. It was certainly more enticing provided the money was better.\n\n26\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nAs a spectator sport, pedestrianism was familiar to Chicagoans and they enthusiastically supported their hometown hero, Daniel O’Leary, an Irish immigrant who made his living as a door-to-door book salesman. After the Great Fire, his downtown business dried up and he was forced to walk daily out to the suburbs, which put him in great shape to walk around a pedestrian track. O’Leary’s goal was to challenge the reigning pedestrian star Edward Payson Weston, another door-to-door book salesman with a flair for self-promotion. His walking exhibitions, held mostly in roller rinks, were a commercial success. O’Leary and Weston finally went head-to-head in November 1875 in a five-hundred-mile race held in Chicago’s Inter-State Exposition Building, a huge barn of a building with standing room only for spectators around a make-shift tanbark (mulch) track. O’Leary, who was several years younger than Weston, won handily, earning widespread approval as Chicago’s favourite son. More importantly, the match was a commercial success that launched O’Leary’s career as a promoter. In the years following the Civil War, pedestrianism had a substantial following even though it was competing for spectators among sports like baseball, pool, rowing, and prizefighting. There was no league as in baseball, nor was there an organized circuit of signed performers. Instead, a comparative handful of walkers travelled about the country seeking a marathon contest, or they went alone by walking X number of miles in X number of days, often in an attempt to break a record. Indoor six-day marathons were the creation of promoters eager to cash in on the public’s interest in long, cross-country treks by walkers. For the athlete to make money, there had to be a way to attract it, and that was through gambling. Bookmaking was legal, and bookies hauled portable booths from one sporting event to another. The athletes themselves rarely saw much of this money. It might be announced, for example, that one pedestrian would race another for two hundred dollars a side, which did not mean that the winner would emerge two hundred dollars richer. Pedestrians were generally underpaid hired athletes, employed by a backer who would put up the wager and gave the athlete a cut of the winnings. Long-distance walking was, in the words of one commentator, for stouthearted members of the working class.30\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n27\n\nIn early February 1876 Chicagoans witnessed their first walking match between two female pedestrians, or pedestriennes as they were called, when Bertha von Hillern and Mary Marshall competed on a track laid out in the Second Regiment Armoury building at the corner of Jackson and Carroll Streets. The race was managed by Daniel O’Leary, who realized there was money to be made in a novel event featuring two women. Bertha, a nineteen-year-old German immigrant, had arrived in the United States around 1875 and settled in Chicago amongst its large Germanic community. She brought with her a reputation as a pedestrienne, and although she had aspirations to become an artist, she lacked the money to study and paint. Thirty-four-year-old Mary Marshall was a Canadian from eastern Ontario, whose real name was Mary Tryphena Curtis. She appeared to be supporting herself and possibly a teenage son selling books door-to-door, which is where O’Leary probably found her. The women’s goal was to walk three hundred miles over six days, going round and round on a sawdust track measuring one-tenth of a mile in length. The typical six-day format was from Monday to Saturday to avoid disrupting the Christian Sabbath on Sunday. An indoor setting allowed for the supervision of contestants from start to finish, providing proof they did not cheat. Each contestant supposedly put up a five-hundred-dollar stake with the winner receiving the total purse, and O’Leary kept the gate receipts after paying his expenses. Though a sudden cold snap in February made for frigid conditions inside the armoury until the heat from several stoves warmed the air, attendance during the day was respectable and brought out a noticeable number of “ladies.” The armoury was filled to capacity in the evenings, especially during the last day of the race when the outcome was in doubt. By the end of the fifth day, Bertha von Hillern was five miles ahead of her opponent and victory seemed assured. Poor Mary suffered from painfully sore and swollen feet, but still boasted that “she would win the race or die in her tracks.” On the sixth and final day, Mary began walking at nine o’clock in the morning and did not stop until the race ended at ten o’clock that night. Part way through the morning she threw off her shoes and completed the race in stocking feet. In the end she won the race, accomplishing nearly 234 miles to Bertha’s 231½, but she was\n\n1.1 Poster advertising Bertha von Hillern’s endurance walk in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1878.

Bertha complained bitterly that it was against the rules of pedestrianism to walk in one’s stocking feet, and this flagrant violation, along with the bad air and tobacco smoke in the armoury, were the causes of her loss.31 A rematch between Bertha von Hillern and Mary Marshall took place a month later at the Chicago West Side rink. The six-day event was going smoothly, though attendance was only fair, when Bertha withdrew from the contest on the grounds that the rules were unfair. Whenever one woman left the track, the other had to leave also. Bertha claimed she was at a disadvantage because she was counting on her superior endurance to win. If Daniel O’Leary was managing this event, he likely made little money.32 Also, pedestrian races among men occurred regularly at this time and Chicagoans were becoming more blasé towards the sport. Louise Brisbois was possibly a spectator at these pedestrienne matches in Chicago. Perhaps she thought that because of her extensive circus training she was just as strong and determined as either Bertha von Hillern or Mary Marshall. Superbly athletic and pleasantly attractive, Louise saw no reason why she should not give pedestrianism a try to bring in more money than she could earn as a strongwoman and circus performer. What she needed to get started was a manager and promoter. She found this person in Tom Eck, a fellow Canadian. Thomas William Eck was born on 10 April 1856 in the small village of Prince Albert in Reach Township in Canada West (today’s province of Ontario) and located north of Lake Ontario, about twenty miles northeast of Whitby. In Tom’s youth, about six hundred people lived in Prince Albert, a busy grain and timber centre. As a “general agent” Tom’s father was likely involved in several local businesses to support his wife, Margaret, and four children, which included Tom (age fourteen) along with siblings Sarah, Edwin, and Calvin. All we know of Tom’s early life was that he was a versatile athlete with a love of horses. He became a jockey in his teens, and by the time he was twenty, he had a good reputation as a harness racing driver, sometimes winning a share of the purse.33 He also played cricket and lacrosse and was a capable ice skater but settled on athletics as his route to stardom. He was a good quarter-miler for his day, posting a time of\n\n1.2 Poster advertising a walk by Mary Marshall in Worcester, Massachusetts. She completed the fifty miles in less than twelve hours (Courtesy American Antiquarian Society)\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n31\n\n52.4 seconds at a meet in Toronto in 1875.34 His favourite event was the standing long jump (also called the broad jump). In those days, the jumper’s momentum was facilitated by dumbbells or small weights carried in each hand and swung forward during the jump, not unlike the stone halteres used by jumpers in the Olympics of Ancient Greece. In 1876 Tom purportedly established a world record at a track meet in Woodbine Park in Toronto by jumping thirteen feet and two inches, using twelve-pound dumbbells. Now a young man of twenty, Tom was living in Oshawa, a manufacturing town on the shore of Lake Ontario about thirty miles east of Toronto.35 Perhaps he went there to find work in one of the town’s many manufacturing concerns such as the famous Joseph Hall Works, which employed as many as three hundred workers and had an excellent apprenticeship program. As the oldest son, he would be expected to earn his own living and, by 1876, his parents had two additional mouths to feed because sisters Margaret and Cara had joined Tom’s three younger siblings. Two more children, John and Niala, would come along later making Tom the oldest of eight children.36 Throughout this time, Cyrus Eck moved his family several times from Prince Albert in Reach Township, to Aurora in York North, to Newmarket in Ontario West, and finally to Whitchurch also in Ontario West. He died in Whitchurch in 1909 at the age of seventy-five. A few days after his twenty-first birthday in April 1877, Tom Eck travelled to the United States, entering at Port Huron, Michigan, and then made his way to Chicago.37 Why he went to the United States then and why he chose Chicago is unclear. Did he think there was a better chance to earn a living through his athletic skills than was possible in Canada? Was it his intent to become a trainer and manager of other athletes? Tom was inventive, smart, wily, and determined, and no doubt soon found a way to earn a living. In Chicago, Tom met Louise Brisbois, although under precisely what circumstances is unknown. Most likely it was at some sort of athletic venue or event. She was probably attracted to this athletic and handsome fellow with clear, penetrating eyes and a bushy moustache. For his part, Tom saw something in the gutsy French Canadian that convinced him she was serious about becoming an athletic star, and it soon became obvious that he was attracted to her too.\n\n32\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nLouise quickly became a pedestrienne and was known as Mlle Louise Armaindo or Madame Armaindo. We can only speculate as to why she chose this particular name.38 Louise decided herself, or was advised by others, to choose a stage name, just like the many singers, actresses, chorus girls, circus entertainers, and performers of athletic feats who made their living in the growing American entertainment industry. The use of a pseudonym was also common among bourgeois women wishing to conceal their real family name, though this was not something that concerned Louise whose background was working class. The first time “Louise Armando” (likely a misspelling) appeared in a press report was at a pedestrienne contest in Chicago in 1879. On the evening of 18 March in the Exposition Building, following a day of men’s races, a tenmile walk was held for women. A dozen contestants, including Louise, were entered in the race before some 1,500 spectators, described in the newspaper as a “howling, crazy, free and easy mob,” but a good-natured one that came primarily to encourage their friends on the track.39 After a little more than two hours, Mary Ackerly, a flower girl who sold bouquets about the hotels, came first; a Mary Miller came second and Louise was third. By October 1879, Louise claimed to have been engaged in the pedestrienne business for two years, and although she called herself the “champion female pedestrienne of Canada” not a single report of her racing in Canada during this time has been unearthed.40 Indeed, she does not show up again in a newspaper account or at least one accessible through a digitized search until early August 1879 when she (and presumably Tom too) was in St Louis, Missouri. Louise was giving five-mile exhibition walks during a men’s six-day go-as-you-please pedestrian contest at St George’s Hall. “Go-as-you-please” meant that competitors were permitted to walk, trot, jog, run, sprint, or crawl as opposed to the more traditional “fair heel and toe” method, where one part of the foot must always be in contact with the ground.41 According to the report, she was training for an upcoming thirty-six-hour walk.42 This may have been a walking match against Carrie Reynolds (or Howard) and Nellie Worrell, who each walked fifteen-hour stretches, held in Union Park Hall in St Louis, although no report was found.43\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n33\n\nBy the first week of October 1879, Louise and Tom were in Sedalia, Missouri. The previous week saw them in Kansas City, where Louise competed in a walking contest of some sort. They had been secured as entertainment by the Sedalia Weekly Bazoo, and soon after they arrived in town, the paper sent a reporter to find out more about Mlle Armaindo. She claimed that she had engaged in some fifteen professional pedestrienne contests and had given over one hundred exhibition walks in various cities and towns in the United States (there was no mention of Canada). She boasted that she had only been beaten once, in St Louis, in the thirty-six-hour walk against Reynolds and Worrell, during which she claimed to have walked eighteen hours and fifteen minutes without stopping.44 Therefore, it seems strange that no record or report could be found to verify at least some of these events, but while researching Louise and her exploits I soon came to accept that she was prone to exaggeration, if not outright lies. Besides, Tom Eck was present during this particular interview, and as her manager he would be keen to embellish the growing reputation of his protégé. They had brought along Louise’s numerous medals and trophies, which were exhibited while she walked. The Bazoo reporter provided one of the first descriptions of Louise, especially her physical appearance. At five feet three inches, she was small, muscular but shapely, and weighed 132 pounds. “It was duly impressed upon the mind of the reporter,” noted the scribe, “that she was amply able to take care of herself at any place and under any circumstances.”45 She was also described as a brunette, the possessor of a very healthy complexion, and about twenty years of age. So confident was Louise of her pedestrienne talent that she issued a challenge to any woman in the world to walk or run any distance from one to one hundred miles. She was not yet among the notables in the pedestrienne world, having to make her reputation mostly through exhibitions or as a sideshow in a men’s race. This was the case in Sedalia, a small Missouri railroad town founded in 1860. The location for the Sedalia race was in Smith’s Hall on a makeshift sawdust track, twenty-seven laps to the mile. Except for some side betting among the almost five hundred patrons in attendance, no money was involved. The trifling prizes were an elegant French clock, a pair\n\n34\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nof English walking shoes, and a gold pen with a cigar and a supply of peanuts offered as the consolation prizes. A handsome bouquet would go to the most graceful walker, to be decided by the ladies in the audience. The eight male competitors began walking promptly at eight o’clock in the evening. The rules for this particular match were heeland-toe (as opposed to go-as-you-please) with the winner covering the most distance in four hours. These rules did not apply to Louise, who appeared about half-past eight in her street clothes, accompanied by manager Tom Eck, to enthusiastic applause from the crowd. She reappeared a half hour later in her walking costume, a short dress exposing a good set of calves, and on her feet a pair of low-heeled English walking shoes laced up to the ankles. After a suitable introduction, Louise stepped onto the track and took off at breakneck speed amid cheers from the audience, many rising and straining to see her in action among the male racers. She completed her first mile in exactly ten minutes at which point she requested that the band in attendance play some music while she continued her second mile, completing it in twenty-one minutes. She kept up this pace completing a mile about every ten minutes and the audience cheered wildly whenever she passed one of the male walkers. Occasionally, Eck would jump onto the track and accompany her for a few laps. At ten minutes to midnight, Louise completed her requisite fifteen miles (her time was just under three hours) and she left the track, seemingly not fatigued in the least. Only three men were left in the official race with the winner, Lou Hughey, completing twenty miles and fourteen laps in four hours, although he was so tired he could not come up on the stage to accept his prize. Afterwards, everyone involved in the contest – scorers, umpires, contestants, reporters, and others – were invited to Kaiser’s, a local restaurant, for an oyster feast. Tom and Louise remained in Sedalia for most of October, taking part in several exhibition walks with side trips to similar events in local railway towns such as Boonville and Moberly. Again, she did not compete for any of the prizes, which were items donated by local merchants and suitable for men (a case of Anheuser beer, silk handkerchiefs, silver tobacco box, and the like). She was an interesting sideshow to the main\n\nCircuses and Walking Tracks, 1870s\n\n35\n\nevent, just like child pedestrian Harry Johnson, only eight years old and suited up in white tights handsomely trimmed with blue, who walked a few miles in the middle of the race. Louise was fitter and more experienced than most of these local athletes, and when she was allowed to go headto-head against a man, for example in a five-mile heel-and-toe walk, she usually won. Even when she entered the track in the middle of a race, she inevitably overtook the leader much to the delight of the audience. In one match she walked for five miles, completing it in fifty-four minutes, and shortly after came back to show off her running style. She completed seven laps, equal to a quarter of a mile, in one minute and 48½ seconds, certainly slow by today’s standards. For her efforts that night, Louise received a silver cup and a bottle of French perfume. One evening Louise promised to show off her trapeze skills to an excited audience, but a rowdy in the crowd began spouting insulting language, whereby all the “ladies” among the spectators left the building and Louise refused to perform. Pedestrianism in those days was sometimes farcical, but it was also sufficiently respectable to draw hundreds of spectators. Tracking Louise’s pedestrienne career is challenging because there are so few sightings available to us today. After their month-long stay in Sedalia, Missouri, Tom and Louise headed north to Palmyra, where the local paper reported that a “Canadian woman of very masculine form, named Armaindo, has been making a show of her dexterity here by walking and running long distances very fast, and the sight has attracted large crowds of both sexes nightly.”46 Tom left Louise in Palmyra while he headed to Quincy, Illinois, where as an “advance agent” he was able to arrange exhibition matches for his protégé.47 By the end of December, they were in Burlington, Iowa, preparing for a tour of the state.48 For much of 1880, they were based in Springfield and travelled to smaller centres in Illinois – Cairo, Jacksonville, Lincoln, Peoria, and Pekin – giving exhibitions of their walking prowess. Louise usually walked a longer distance and Tom gave an exhibition of “fast walking.” Where she was billed as the “champion pedestrienne of Canada,” he was the noted “champion fast walker of Toronto.” One of their favourite races was to walk five miles against five local men each of whom covered one mile. In Springfield in May, Louise walked twenty-five miles in four hours and\n\n36\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\none minute, supposedly the fastest time ever by a woman.49 She was immediately challenged by a Madam LaFayette, “Champion of the West,” to a walking race in Springfield, but there is no trace of this contest. By late fall of 1880, Louise and Tom were in Ontario, one of the few times they returned to Canada. Tom’s family lived in Aurora, so perhaps he took Louise home to meet them and at the same time engage in a few walking exhibitions. An announcement in the Aurora Banner made an outrageous claim: “M’lle Louise Armaindo, champion pedestrienne of the world, gives an exhibition walk of five miles in the Town Hall tonight (Friday), commencing at eight o’clock sharp. This is the first appearance of this lady in Canada, and no doubt there will be a large attendance.”50 Tom took on his younger brother Calvin in a two-and-a-half-mile race. The couple also appeared in nearby Uxbridge where Louise walked five miles in just over forty-three minutes, beating five men walking one mile each.51 The two soon headed back south of the border to revitalize their careers as athlete-entertainers. Pedestrianism in Canada, and more accurately eastern Canada, was neither as popular nor as developed as it was in the United States. Besides, as discussed in the next chapter, the peak year for pedestriennes was 1879, and from then on interest in the sport began to wane. Louise never did become a star on the women’s pedestrian circuit, but before we leave the pedestriennes it’s important to understand how the sport laid the groundwork for the high-wheel bicycle era that followed. Along the way, we will meet other luminaries in this sport who, like Louise, exchanged their walking shoes for a bicycle.\n\nc hap t e r t wo\n\nPedestriennes, 1878–1880\n\nMiss Von Blumen is called the Queen of Lady Pedestriennes, and has won an enviable reputation. She comes with the very highest recommendations from all over the country, and we have no doubt she is just what she is represented … and she has never failed to accomplish what she has undertaken. “Miss Elsa Von Blumen,” Highland (OH) News, 10 July 1879\n\nMiss von Blumen – not her real name – was a contemporary of Louise Armaindo in the pedestrienne world. Her story is as astonishing as Louise’s but somewhat easier to document. Caroline Wilhelmina Kiner was born in Kansas on 6 October 1859 to George and Anna Kiner. Both were German immigrants from Prussia, probably as young children, since George had been a soldier and fought in the American Civil War. By 1870 the family was living in Oswego, New York, on the southern shore of Lake Ontario. Caroline, or more familiarly Carrie, was ten years old with three younger sisters. Never a robust child, her health continued to decline until her now widowed mother took the family to Rochester, hoping the dryer climate would improve her daughter’s delicate condition. On the advice of her doctor, Carrie began to exercise with dumbbells and clubs, and walked regularly until she could manage five to six miles a day. Realizing that walking for a living was possible, she sought\n\n38\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nout Bert Miller, who trained and managed several other pedestrians. Carrie took the stage name of Elsa von Blumen, an obvious salute to her German heritage, and with Miller as her manager, she began her pedestrian career in early 1879.1 Albert “Bert” Miller (sometimes “Burt”) was an alias for William H. Rosevelt.2 Born around 1843 in Albany, New York, he came to Utica as a young man, and in 1862 enlisted in the New York 165th Infantry Regiment, fighting for the duration of the Civil War. In the 1870s he settled in Rochester, where he became involved with pedestrian matches and other entertainment, especially those involving women. He was an unsavoury character, and when he died of heart disease at age forty-nine in 1892, it was said that he “always managed to lead a lazy life at the expense of female endurance in sporting circles.”3 Margaret “Maggie” Gangross, whose stage name was Bertha von Berg, was likely the first female pedestrienne managed by Bert.4 A Rochester seamstress with a fondness for walking, she came to Bert’s attention after completing the twelve miles between Rochester and Fairport in just over two hours. She began her pedestrian career in August 1877, and under Bert’s tutelage completed several exhibition walks. Muscular, tall, and “possessed of wonderful pluck, nerve, and Spartanlike grit,” von Berg often competed against an amateur male pedestrian usually over a distance of one hundred miles on an inside track.5 Within a year there were growing concerns about the cruel and unreasonable way Bert treated his protégé, and by the end of 1879 he and Bertha had parted company. Meanwhile, Bert and his wife accompanied Elsa von Blumen as they made their way from one pedestrian venue to another. Again there were instances of Bert’s bad-tempered and predatory behaviour with one particularly unflattering early report. Bert apparently got drunk and called Elsa vile names. Even more revealing was his financial arrangement with his young pedestrienne. She received twenty-five dollars for each one hundred miles she completed, with the rest of the proceeds going to Miller and his wife, who normally stayed in a fancy hotel while Elsa was put up in a cheap room.6 On another occasion, Bert forced Elsa to ride in an open carryall just after she had walked those one hundred miles. Rumours circulated that Elsa would soon leave her\n\nPedestriennes, 1878–1880\n\n39\n\nmanager, but she was likely more compliant than Bertha von Berg, and bad publicity was harmful for securing exhibitions and contests at which to make money. Later, the seemingly reformed manager was advertised as the “distinguished master of physical culture, Prof. Burt Miller.”7 Whether or not he also shared more of the profits with his pedestriennes is not known. Elsa’s specialty was walking one hundred miles in twenty-seven hours or less, usually competing against a local male pedestrian walking 120 miles, or against two of them, each walking sixty miles. Her exhibitions often took place in an opera house or music hall where a special sawdust track, usually three feet wide, had been laid, with spectators seated inside facing the track. Since these were small facilities, one circuit of the miniature track would measure only a fraction of a mile. In one hall, located in Wheeling, West Virginia, the track was exactly 187 feet in circumference. Since there are 5,280 feet in a mile, it required twentyeight laps and forty-four feet to make one mile. Therefore, in a onehundred-mile walk, Elsa would need to complete 2,823 laps. Allowing for two feet to a step, this would make 264,000 steps altogether.8 In this particular walk, Elsa was matched with amateur pedestrian and prominent Bellaire jeweller Newton L. Marsh, who would attempt to walk 120 miles in twenty-seven hours or less against Elsa’s one hundred miles. The event began at eight o’clock in the evening, continued throughout the night and all next day, and finished just after ten o’clock at night. Carrying a light whip, Elsa wore a short, grey, poplin dress trimmed with pink satin. They walked almost continuously averaging between eleven and twelve minutes per mile, taking periodic short breaks with longer ones for breakfast and supper on the second day. Spectators came and went, and were sparse in the middle of the night, but by eight o’clock on the evening of the second day, there was standing room only. Just after ten o’clock that night Marsh completed one hundred miles and decided to call it quits. Elsa was not far behind and during her final mile kept up a furious pace to the music of “Yankee Doodle.” Amid deafening cheers she closed her one hundredth mile in exactly eleven minutes, her quickest of the race. At just over five feet four inches, Elsa was a little taller than Louise Armaindo but weighed about the same (130 pounds). Often described\n\n40\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nas retiring and lady-like in her deportment, her walking outfit was always a grey suit covered by a dress that fell to just above her shoes. As her reputation grew, Elsa became known as the “White Fawn” of Rochester, a name given to her by the governor of New York, Lucius Robinson, who was smitten by her petite form and child-like, innocent face. She also collected testimonials from respected men in the community, which were duly printed in the local paper to publicize her walks. A special appeal was often directed at women to attend, with the assurance that the exhibition would be one of refinement and nothing would happen to offend the most fastidious of ladies. If women were in attendance, the entertainment was also suitable for the best and most refined circles of society, unlike some pedestrian events where rowdiness, betting, and gambling were tolerated. Elsa von Blumen modelled herself after one of the first pedestrienne celebrities in the United States, Bertha von Hillern, the young German immigrant introduced in the previous chapter. A German paper published in Cincinnati even went so far as to suggest that Elsa might be von Hillern’s successor.9 During Bertha’s short but successful career, due to her extraordinary endurance and her agent’s business connections, her efforts made a significant impact, especially among middle- and upperclass women. After match-ups with Mary Marshall, first in Chicago early in 1876 and later in November in New York’s Central Park Garden, von Hillern never again walked in competition except against herself. Her first solo exhibition took place just before Christmas in 1876. At the invitation of physicians in Boston, she completed 350 miles over six days on a temporary track (twenty laps to a mile) laid out in the city’s music hall.10 During the next year and a half, she travelled throughout the eastern United States giving solo exhibitions where she would walk eighty-eight miles in twenty-six hours or one hundred miles in twentyeight hours. Walking consecutive hours meant that she went without sleep and with very little food during the time she was on the track. She was cleverly promoted by her manager, David Thomas, a press agent with the Barnum circus organization, who ensured that von Hillern’s walks were well publicized, and that she was made available for enlightening interviews. Under Thomas’s guidance, Bertha saw herself as an example to be emulated by proving to “my sex that correct diet,\n\n2.1 Elsa von Blumen, the “White Fawn” of Rochester, New York, c. 1883 (Author’s collection)\n\n42\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nstrict temperance and systematic exercise have much to do in securing perfect health.”11 Some women took her advice to heart and formed walking clubs, where members pledged “to eat oatmeal for breakfast, put on a loose, light Bloomer walking dress and take a long walk in the country at least three times a week.”12 Others attended her lectures on the benefits of exercise and healthy eating. By the mid-1880s there was increasing interest among physicians, physical culturists, and entrepreneurs in regimens of vigorous physical exercise for both women and men to encourage greater strength, enhanced muscularity, and increased body size. Gymnasiums were established and equipped, and home exercise equipment, such as the lift machine – the precursor of the modern weightlifting machine – was invented and sold by enterprising agents. Many reform-minded Americans embraced the notion of a larger, stronger female body.13 When pedestrienne Bertha von Hillern came to prominence in the late 1870s, the movement towards bigger, stronger, more active women, directed primarily at those who had time and money, was fully recognized. Bertha might well have been the first female athletic personality to endorse fitness products, such as a special liniment to relax tired muscles. She was also the subject of lectures titled “Physical Culture and Bertha Von Hillern” given by Leroy J. Cherrington, whose main objective was to sell the Dr Butler Health Lift.14 By the summer of 1878 von Hillern had left the sawdust track to pursue a career as a landscape artist, although she continued to promote exercise for women, especially walking, hiking, and mountain climbing, through her articles and talks.15 The two Berthas – von Berg and von Hillern – along with Mary Marshall likely influenced Louise and Elsa to try earning a living through pedestrianism. Louise probably didn’t realize that Mary Marshall (Mary Tryphena Curtis Lipsey) was a fellow Canadian, but had she known about her background, she would certainly have empathized with her. Born on 5 July 1841 in Soperton, Leeds, Ontario, Tryphena Curtis (as she was called) was the oldest sibling of eventually four brothers and two sisters. At nineteen, she married Irishman Thomas Lipsey, an ironworker, and they soon moved to Dunkirk, New York. A son, James, was born in 1862.\n\n2.2 Poster advertising a walk of eighty-eight miles in twenty-six consecutive hours by Bertha von Hillern in Portland, Maine, 1877 (Collections of Maine Historical Society)\n\n44\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nWhen Tryphena began her pedestrian career in 1876 in Chicago, under the name of Mary Marshall, newspaper reports indicated she was a widow, when in reality she had a husband and a teenage son. Whether she and her husband were still together is unclear because rumours circulated about a rocky marriage due to Lipsey’s drinking and abuse. By the spring of 1877, with Bertha von Hillern refusing to walk against her, Marshall was forced to go solo as well. From April till July she travelled throughout New England putting on exhibitions of fifty or one hundred miles. She also became pregnant again, which forced her to disappear after the summer. Her son Allen (the father was Lipsey) was born in Soperton, Ontario, in February 1878.16 After nearly a year, Mary, who now preferred to be called May, resumed her pedestrian career. Making up for lost time, she kept up a furious pace by travelling and performing extensively. By early 1879 she had amassed, according to her, an astonishing record of one hundred 50-mile, twenty-three 100-mile, six 225-mile, and four six-day walks, which was the equivalent of 9,000 miles. She had also defeated twenty-two men and a number of female walkers.17 Confident and boastful, Marshall proclaimed that she was the “best human walker in the country” and bragged that as a “woman of iron heart” she could accomplish anything she undertook.18 Her immediate goal was to exceed the achievement of the English pedestrienne Ada Anderson, who had recently walked a quarter mile every fifteen minutes for a month. Madame Anderson, as she preferred to be called, had worked as an actress, circus clown, singer, and theatre proprietor in London before taking up pedestrianism in 1877. She had been trained by William Gale, a well-known and successful endurance pedestrian, who encouraged her to specialize in walks covering hundreds of miles over several weeks without sleep. Seeking greater challenges, she and her husband arrived in the United States in October 1878 and immediately sought out a New York venue for a twenty-eight-day walk. They attempted to rent Gilmore’s Garden (later renamed Madison Square Garden) but had to settle for Mozart Garden, a smaller variety hall in Brooklyn. Anderson’s goal was to walk a seemingly impossible 2,700 quarter miles in 2,700 quarter hours, a total of 675 miles in twenty-eight days. Night and day, commencing every fifteen minutes, she made seven\n\nPedestriennes, 1878–1880\n\n45\n\n2.3 Madame Ada Anderson, the great 2,700 quarter-mile walker, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper, 1 February 1879 (Brooklyn Public Library)\n\ncircuits around the track, which on average took between three and four minutes. She then retired to her dressing room for the remaining eleven or twelve minutes, during which time she either ate, slept, changed her costume, or had a quick bath before the bell went again. Officials made certain she stuck to the rules, and curious spectators, including many women, came and went at all hours. Betting was plentiful and heavy, the odds being against the pedestrienne. Anderson, thirty-five years of age, was variously described as robust, rosy, hearty, strong, and muscular; her walking style was admired for\n\n46\n\nm uscle on w heels\n\nits graceful, swaying movements, and even, steady tread. She suffered badly blistered feet in the first couple of weeks, but overcame the problem with treatment. Since she managed to sleep only about an hour during each twenty-four, sleep deprivation was her biggest enemy. Increasingly, she suffered “sleepy spells,” which meant that she walked around the track with her eyes closed and sound asleep. Occasionally, she walked an extra lap by mistake, and sometimes an assistant had to wake her and guide her back to the dressing room. To relieve the monotony and boredom she would jump onto the stage and, seated at a piano, serenade the crowd for a few minutes before resuming her walk. Anderson began her walk on 16 December 1878 and completed it on 12 January 1879 with reports that she earned between seven and eight thousand dollars for her efforts.19 Madame Anderson was now a celebrity, and her success in Brooklyn set off a pedestrian mania as dozens of working-class women throughout the United States took to walking for money with some trying to better her feats. Most were untrained and they failed miserably, never to be heard from again.20 Among those succeeding were established pedestriennes like May Marshall, who completed 2,796 quarter miles in 2,796 consecutive quarter hours in a Washington gymnasium in mid-February. Unfortunately, the event was a financial failure and the audience was asked to contribute to a collection for the exhausted pedestrienne.21 At the same time Marshall walked in Washington, the exotically named Exilda Lachapelle was completing 2,700 quarter miles in 2,700 quarter hours in Chicago. Lachapelle was one of several celebrated pedestriennes depicted in a book published in 1878, titled Practical Training for Running, Walking, Rowing, Wrestling, Jumping and All Kinds of Athletic Feats.22 In a later interview, she claimed to have been born in Marseilles, France. When she was very young, her doctor father moved to Canada, but both parents died soon after, leaving her in the care of an uncle. As a young child she loved to walk and run fast, which led to her walking professionally, first in Marseilles, and then as she travelled with her uncle.23 Like many early athlete-entertainers, Lachapelle created a stage biography that only partially resembled the truth. Surprisingly, Exilda Lachapelle, like May Marshall and Louise Armaindo, was Canadian.\n\nPedestriennes, 1878–1880\n\n47\n\nBorn on 15 February 1859 in Montreal, Exilda was baptized Marie Ezilda Langlois dit Chapelle (her last name was Langlois, but the family also went by Chapelle). Her parents were Louis Langlois dit Chapelle and Herméline (Herminie) Daniel.24 It’s unlikely that Louis was a doctor, but his occupation is not known. The young family was beset by tragedy. Their first child, Louis Charles, born in 1857, died nine months later; then came Marie Ezilda in 1859, followed by Josephine in 1861, who died at age two; Jeremiah, born in 1864, survived, but Joseph Louis, born in 1865, died shortly thereafter. Even more tragically, Herméline died in 1868 at age thirty-two, leaving Louis with two young children, one of whom was Exilda. Nothing further is known about Louis, but Exilda and perhaps her brother Jeremiah may have been sent to a relative or a friend of the family. In 1874 and only fifteen, Exilda was married in Montreal to William Ross Derose, who was also French Canadian, eight years older and a bailiff. William, their son, was born on 7 May 1876, but he died three days later. The facts of Exilda Lachapelle’s life make it clear that she was a gritty survivor, which probably accounts for her success as an endurance walker. She was physically slim, petite, compact, and, according to one observer, “every muscle is serviceable.”25 Unlike some of her fellow pedestriennes, she did not lope around the ring or skip in a half run; her gait was even and graceful. Her attire was a light silk dress with little adornment that came just below the knee, and on her feet she wore high, lace-up shoes. Exilda always insisted that her pedestrienne career began when she was thirteen (in 1872), but where she performed is unknown. It was not in taverns and small theatres in Montreal and environs, as some have suggested, because there is no evidence that pedestrianism as a sport, let alone for women participants, took place there at that time.26 However, we know little about the origins of pedestrianism in eastern Canada. I suspect that Exilda’s walking career really began when she and her husband immigrated to the United States, probably to Wisconsin, likely sometime in the fall of 1877.27 Early in 1878, in a brief note in the Chicago Daily Tribune, Exilda complained that she had found no one willing to walk a long tramp against her; therefore, she challenged anyone to one hundred miles to be walked in the city. “She is by no means a novice,” explained the article,\n\n2.4 French Canadian pedestrienne Exilda Lachapelle, c. 1878 (Houseworth’s celebrities [graphic] theater portraits collection, Lachapelle Exilda—por 2, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley)\n\nPedestriennes, 1878–1880\n\n49\n\nand “having a good Canadian reputation, she will make it lively for any contestant.”28 Exilda and her husband travelled throughout Wisconsin and Illinois seeking walking matches, though mostly she walked solo attempting to complete one hundred miles in twenty-six hours or less. In Madison, Wisconsin, for example, she accomplished this with more than half an hour to spare on an indoor sawdust track that required thirty laps to make one mile.29 Occasionally, she went up against a male pedestrian in a ten-mile race; for instance, in Rockford, Illinois, she raced against a fellow who beat her by less than two minutes. The press report was entirely complimentary of Exilda’s efforts, noting that though the male pedestrian strode out with a long and quick step, the “willing little French woman held him to the work with pertinacity, and beat him on the last mile.” When the difference in the length of their limbs was considered, Lachapelle’s feat was the more extraordinary of the two.30 All this was excellent training for Exilda’s severest test of endurance early in 1879, which was 2,700 quarter miles in 2,700 consecutive quarter minutes round and round on a track laid out in the Folly Theatre on Desplaines St"
