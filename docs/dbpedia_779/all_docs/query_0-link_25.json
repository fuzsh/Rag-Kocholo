I hope God will give me the strength to fulfill that task in the way in which it ought to be fulfilled. I am enjoying good health and feel in full possession of my mental capacities; I have been blessed for over forty years with the companionship of a wonderful wife, who has made it possible for me to pursue all my personal and professional activities with the leisure necessary to pursuing them. Nevertheless, the years have taken their toll of my memory. There are many essential details, especially of my earlier days, that I may no longer remember; my own perspectives may be distorted; what I regard as significant and memorable may not have appeared so to other members of my family. Moreover, I cannot check my memories with many people who formed part of my early life. It is already more than two decades ago, on May 1st, 1966, that my beloved brother Ernest met his premature death; my last surviving aunt Trade Strauss, sister of my mother, who knew me from the day of my birth, died on Tisha b'Av on August 14, 1986.1 can no longer check any of my memories with them. Of the five cousins on my father's side, all older than myself, three survive. The oldest of them is Else Halle, daughter of my late aunt Johanna Rose, nee Ostwald, and mother of Inge Nathan, lives in a retirement home in London and is 91 years old. I have never been very close to her: when I was a child, she lived in Berlin and we rarely saw one another so that she did not really share my life. Next in line comes Liesel Humberg, daughter of my aunt Emmy Klein, nee Ostwald. Although she lived in Langendreer not very far from Dortmund when I was a child, I have always felt less close to her than to Else Halle, primarily 2 because her temperament is entirely different from mine. Her mental horizon is very limited and, in my opinion, she has never had any values higher in life than to have a good time. (Her daughter, Monica Flori, who lives in Portland, Oregon, is quite a different kettle of fish. Unfortunately, I have so far met her only once, but we are in sporadic correspondence with one another.) Liesel emigrated to Uruguay ca. 1937, shortly after her marriage to Helmut Humberg, and they had themselves baptized soon after their arrival there. This, too, makes a good relationship difficult for me, for, unless there are deep and genuine spiritual reasons, I regard it as a betrayal to forsake the religion for which our fathers and forefathers have had to give their lives. I also regard it as lack of character on Liesel's part to have returned to live in Germany after the war, the country which caused the death of her parents. For these reasons, Liesel, too, can do little to aid my memory. There remains my favorite cousin Hella Reinach, nee Neukircher. I have always been fond of her, probably because she inherited the warmheartedness of her mother Rosa. She is twelve years older than I, i.e. she is now 78 years of age. She was born and raised not far from Dortmund, a small town in Westphalia, named Werl. Since it is about half-way between Dortmund and Sichtigvor, Ernest and I used to stop over there for lunch whenever we cycled to Sichtigvor. Hella married Julius (Julie) Goldschmidt in 1930; they lived very close to Dortmund in Castrop-Rauxel and we visited them quite often. They emigrated to Chicago about 1937, where Jiille was very successful as a dentist. He died in 1953. After a few years of widowhood, Hella then married Walter Reinach, a physician, and moved to Schenectady, where he practised. A few years after his death, she moved to Sherman Oaks (Los Angeles) to be close to her daughters, Marlene Malkin and Joanne Dolinki. Hella is now about the only person with whom I can check my memory, although in the crucial period from 1937 until I moved to Chicago in 1946 our only contact was by correspondence. So much about the human sources other than my memory. In addition, I can look to photographs and some old letters to stimulate my memory, and I shall do in that respect whatever I can. So with these cautionary words, let me proceed. □ • In resuming writing in April 2009, after a long lapse, 1 regret to have to report the deaths, over the past few years of all my cousins mentioned above: Liesel Humberg died in Berlin (but 1 am still in sporadic touch with her daughter Monica Flori); Else Halle in London; most painful to me was the death of my beloved 3 Hella Reinach, at the age of 98, on April 4th of this year in Sherman Oaks, California. She was buried on Lore's 85th birthday two days ago (April 8th, 2007). Her life was long and , by and large happy. She was attended in admirable devotion by her daughters, Marlene Malkin and Joanne Dolinki. In addition to them, these were predeceased by Hilde Halle, Else Halle’s younger sister, who lived in Macclesfield, England; and by Use Spiegel, nee Klein, sister of Liesel Humberg, who lived in Portland, Oregon. My two cousins on my mother’s side were approximately my own age and would not have been appropriate sources for these memoirs. The younger of them, Eva Jonas, daughter of Crete, nee Strauss and divorced from her husband Richard Jonas, was, with her mother, killed by the Nazis during World War II. She was born in Berlin in 1924 (?). My older cousin, Hans (Harold) Weinberg, son of Else Weinberg, nee Strauss, was born in 1921; he managed to flee to England before the War; was interned and sent to Australia. He married there and his daughter Marie Else Klein still lives there (in Bulleen near Melbourne), and we are in occasional touch. Harold died a few years ago. 4 MEMOIRS Table of Contents Introduction i-iii I. Family Background 1 1, The Ostwald Side 1 2. The Strauss Side 14 II. Childhood 1922-33 23 III. Childhood 1933-38 38 1.

The Ostwald side It is difficult to convey in words to those who do not share my background how very German our family was. My father, Max Ostwald, traced back his side of the family as far as ca. 1640. He could not go back any further, because the necessary documentation was destroyed in the Thirty-Years War. From at least that time on, all the Ostwald family lived in Westphalia.The documents he gathered laboriously and conscientiously shortly after Hitler came to power are now lost. On a postcard dated June 19, 1939 and sent from Dortmund to me in England, my father reports his discovery that my great-great-grandmother, Hanne Weinberg was bom in 1771 in Calle near Meschede (Westphalia) as the daughter of Moses and Esther Weinberg, and that she died in Horn (Westphalia) on September 8, 1860. This is somewhat puzzling to me for two reasons. Her name alone appears on the birth registration of my great-grandfather, Menke Ostwald; at some point unknown to me she married, according to my father, Salomon Ostwald. But on Menke’s tombstone his Hebrew name is inscribed as “Menachem ben Avraham,” not as “Menachem ben Shlomo.” Why is Salomon’s name not registered as Menke's father? Since males of uncertain paternity are usually given the Hebrew patronymic “ben Avraham,” my father speculated that Menke may have been Hannchen's illegitimate child, who was adopted by Salomon Ostwald when he married her. Where Salomon Ostwald lived, my father did not know. Secondly, it is somewhat strange that my father believed Hanne to have died in Horn at a time when her son Menke had already been settled in Sichtigvor for 21 years, since Horn is quite a distance from Sichtigvor, and since Menke's tombstone clearly indicates that he was bom in Belecke (a small town about 3 or 4 miles from Sichtigvor). 6 Since my father was not a professional archivist or historian, but picked up his information sporadically and unsystematically, I am more inclined to believe an account, sent to me under the date of February 10, 2000, by Willi Hecker, a local and very conscientious historian of Sichtigvor, who found in the archives of the public registry office in Warstein (a larger town near Sichtigvor, into which Sichtigvor is now incorporated), a record of the marriage of Menke Emanuel Ostwald to (He)lena Griineberg (of Arnsberg, the capital of one of the three districts into which Westphalia was divided) as having taken place in Sichtigvor on February 26, 1840. In that same document, Menke’s birthplace is given as Belecke, his father’s name as Jakob Ostwald (from Iserlohn), and his mother’s as (Jo)hanna Weinberg. The names of Helena’s parents (i.e., my great-great- grandparents) are given as Abraham Griineberg and Bertha Stem. It is known from their tombstones in the Jewish cemetery in Belecke that Menke was bom in Belecke on October 14, 1810, and died in Sichtigvor on April 15, 1895; and that Helena was bom in Arnsberg on November 12, 1812, and died in Sichtigvor on May 7, 1885, i.e. a year after Opa Max was bom. Photographs of the two used to hang over the piano in the living room of our house in Sichtigvor. Small copies of these pictures are in my possession. My father told me that Menke was very poor and wore no more than a linen suit on his bar mitzvah. Menke had moved from Belecke to Sichtigvor in 1839, and his marriage to Helena Griineberg took place a year after he purchased “our” house. 1 In their house 1 Willi Hecker reports in his letter of February 10, 2000, that other Ostwalds are recorded as having lived in Belecke, and he assumes (rightly, I believe) that they must have been relatives of Menke. The most interesting of these is Salomon Ostwald, who married Bela Weinberg (1785- 1844) . His name, as well as the fact that his wife’s maiden name was Weinberg, suggests one of the reasons why my father regarded him as Menke’s father. This seems chronologically possible, though he might also have been Menke’s uncle. The document seems more reliable. — Salomon’s children were: (1) Jakob Ostwald, who married Evi Stern in 1851; they had a son named Seligmann; (2) Abraham Ostwald, who married Jette Rosenthal in 1840 and had a son Jakob with her in 1841; the same Abraham Ostwald is said to have married Pauline Stem in 1859 (presumably he was widowed at the time and this was a second marriage), and they had a daughter named Hedwig in 1864. —To this information Willi Hecker adds: “Whether Esther Ostwald, who married Michael Lowenstein and gave birth to a son, Jakob, in 1850, is also one of Salomon Ostwald’s children could not be ascertained. There was also a Jeanette Ostwald, who gave birth in 1845 to an illegitimate daughter, Esther, who lived for only 8 months. I don’t know 7 all their children were bom and it remained our family's homestead until my father was forced to sell it by the Nazis in 1939. My brother Ernest and I spent all our vacations there until the death of my grandmother in 1934, and many vacations thereafter, when it was remodelled and, except for a small apartment which we retained, rented out. Some of my happiest childhood memories are associated with Sichtigvor and that house. On November 9, 2008, the 70 th anniversary of the infamous “Kristallnacht,” when synagogues were burned, Jewish homes laid waste, and my father, Uncle Ernest and I arrested, a bronze plaque was affixed and dedicated at our house by the Sichtigvor community to commemorate our former ownership of the “Judenhaus” and the contributions made by our family to the community life of Sichtigvor. Menke and Helena had 3 sons and 4 daughters. The eldest son was my grandfather Markus Ostwald, who was born in Sichtigvor on October 15, 1842, and died there on November 22, 1914. In addition to him, there were, according to the letter from Willi Hecker of February 10, 2000, two other sons (Levi, bom July 30, 1850; and Salomon Benjamin, who was bom on December 23, 1852, and died February 16, 1869). The reason why I had never heard of them before is probably that they had both died by the time Opa Max was bom. Of the daughters I best remember Rosalie Ostwald, who was bom on May 20, 1860, and married (Meyer) Max Rosenthal in Horde (near Dortmund). She was the mother of George, Julius, and Helene. We had close relations with George, who emigrated to the U.S. in the mid-193 0s and had a practice as a physician in Cherry Valley, N.Y., where he died ca. 1954. He and his wife, Else, had no children. Julius (called Julie) owned his father's department store in Horde until his emigration in 1938. He settled in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., and died there in the early 1950s. His wife, Lucie, nee Meyer, died of cancer a few years after him in New York. Of his two children, Alfred (who changed his family name to Ronald) used to live in Scarsdale, where I understand he died a few years ago. His daughter Lore used to live in Trenton, where she was married to John Groeger, a distant relative through the Fleischhacker branch of our family, of whom more later. He committed suicide in the early 1960s. We last saw Lore, when we were at whether Isaak Bachmann, who married Rebekka Blankenstein, is in any way connected with your grandmother.” 8 the Institute in Princeton in 1973-74, but after that lost touch with her. Helene lived in Elberfeld, married to a lawyer named Adolf Strauss. They were divorced in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Lene (as she was called) then moved to Horde with her only son, Werner, to be near her family. Adolf committed suicide soon after the divorce. Lene lost her life in one of the Nazi extermination camps. Her son Werner went to Israel (when it was still Palestine) in the late 1930s and settled in the kibbutz Givat Brenner. We visited him there on our first trip to Israel in 1962.1 maintained a brief correspondence with him thereafter, but it fizzled out. Rosalie died in Cologne shortly before the outbreak of war on May 16, 1939. Another daughter of Menke and Helena Ostwald, Henriette, was bom on November 11, 1845, and also married a resident of Horde, Benedikt Back. She was always referred to as \"Tante Back\". I well remember their son Albert Back, who owned the family textile store when I was a boy, and especially his wife Lene, a cordial, warm-hearted and ebullient woman. They had a weekend house on the Hengstey See, not far from Dortmund (where, incidentally, the Rosenthals also had a weekend house), which we visited often on a Sunday or for a weekend. They had two children, Lritz and Liese, both of whom emigrated to Israel in the early 1930s. Lritz, who was a fellow student of Walter Leipzig's in Cologne, died fairly young in the 1950s; Liese was married to Werner Alexander and you will remember her well from our visits to Beth Yitzchak. She was a wonderful woman and it was a great loss to us, when she died of cancer in the early 1970s. Her son David still lives in her house in Beth Yitzchak. The Backs also had a daughter, named Rickchen, who married Siegmund Seligmann. Their son, Ernst Seligmann, became the husband of Irene (=Reni) Bachmann, who now lives in Los Angeles. Reni, incidentally, is related to us from my grandmother's side: her father, Lelix Bachmann, was my grandmother's nephew and thus my father's cousin (see below). Ernst's sister, Herta, was married in Buer near Dortmund. She perished in the holocaust. I have some memories of the third daughter of Menke and Helene Ostwald, whom I very vaguely remember to have met, when I was still a very little boy. But I may be mistaken about that. Her name was Bertha; she was bom on September 28, 1858, and married Hugo Lleischhacker in Diisseldorf. She had two sons, 9 named Max and Hugo, and two daughters named Else and Helene. Helene was the mother of John Groeger, whom I mentioned above as the husband of Lore Rosenthal. Else worked in a very elegant department store in Dusseldorf, got married in the late 1930s and emigrated the U.S. Of the sons, I remember only Max and his two children (one male and one female), who were several years older than I, from a visit they paid to Sichtigvor shortly before Oma's death. Hella told me that the famous sculptor Benno Elkan (who made the menorah in front of the Knesset building in Jerusalem) is somehow connected with the Fleischhackers. The fourth Ostwald daughter, whose name was Minna (or Bemhardine, according to Willi Hecker), was bom on February 4, 1841, and married a Katzenberg in Grebenstein near Kassel. Their daughter Toni I once met in Cologne, where she lived with her husband, a laborer named Sassen. Another daughter married a man named Schnitzler. Their son Adi emigrated to Florida, where he made his living as a window trimmer for Lane Bryant. I know that Hella was still in touch with him some years ago. My grandfather, Markus Ostwald, was the second eldest, but eldest of their male children. I infer that from the incontrovertible facts that he inherited the paternal estate in Sichtigvor, and that he had the initial \"M\", which became traditional for the eldest son in our family. He married Philippine, nee Bachmann from Velmede (near Arnsberg) on September 10, 1873, in Sichtigvor in a religious ceremony under the chuppah; the civil marriage took place over a month later in Ruthen (a small municipality near Sichtigvor) on October 27, 1873. No doubt the former was regarded as the more important, and the latter a mere formality; if it were otherwise, the sequence would no doubt have been reversed. Markus Ostwald died in Sichtigvor on November 22, 1914, long before I was bom, and six years before my parents got married. I shall have very much more to say about my grandmother later on, since she is one of the great women in my life. But for the moment I simply record that she was born in Velmede (Westphalia) on January 29, 1849, and that she died in Sichtigvor on October 17, 1934, at the age of 85.1 have very vivid memories of her and especially of her funeral, which I attended in the sad consciousness that she would no longer experience my bar mitzvah, which was to take place a little over two months later on December 22, 1934. 10 There are two stories about her I should like to mention here. One is that my father, when he tried to track down her birth certificate, discovered that her birth was recorded at the public registry in Meschede (the nearest town to the village of Velmede) as having been reported by her father on February 5, 1849, to have taken place on February 3, and not on January 29, which was the day on which her birthday had always been celebrated. My father believed that either (a) her father was later than the local laws prescribed in registering the birth and therefore gave a later date than the one on which it actually took place, or (b) that February 3 was the actual date of her birth by the Jewish calendar, and that when the Jews started to celebrate their birthdays according to the common calendar, it was celebrated on January 29, because the Jewish date had fallen on January 29 the year before. I regard the first of these alternatives as the more likely, because at that time there was no public transportation to cover the five miles or so between Velmede and Meschede, so that he had to go on foot to the registry, and weather conditions may have prevented him from making the trip within the time prescribed by law. Another peculiarity about the birth registration was that her name was entered as Bienchen, not Philippine. My father had no theory how that had happened. But the truth of the matter is that she was called \"Pinchen\" by all her relatives; since this is a kind of pet name for \"Philippine\" it may well be that \"Bienchen\" is a misspelling for that. The other story involves an incident shortly after my grandparents' marriage. It was the custom of Jewish families in the neighborhood to visit one another on Shabbat afternoons for coffee and cake. On one of these occasions my grandmother wanted to parade her best coffee service, including little mocha cups, which had been a wedding gift. Her father-in-law, Menke, called her away from the party and rebuked her: \"Aren't you ashamed of yourself to serve coffee out of such small cups? People will think that you are stingy!\" The house in Velmede in which my grandmother was bom had probably been acquired ca. 1830 by her father, the merchant Marcus Bachmann, when he married Roschen Strauss, who was born in Velmede on November 13, 1811. He himself was bom in nearby Meschede on March 11, 1800. Both died in Velmede, Marcus on May 16, 1873, and Roschen on April 20, 1881. I have an unreliable 11 note that they had 6 sons and 4 daughters. But I know only of my grandmother, a sister of hers who married a Rosenthal in Meschede, and her brother Leeser. Leeser's son, Max Bachmann, owned both the house and the store when, as children, Ernest and I visited their ancestral home together with our parents several times. Max Bachmann's wife was Klara, nee Wolff. They had four children. The oldest was Anneliese, then came Edgar, then Carla (who was two or three years older than I), and finally Hilla, who was Ernest's age. Anneliese was married to Robert Goldschmidt of Eslohe, the brother of Hella's first husband Julius (= Julie) Goldschmidt. Robert died a very few years after their marriage and left her widowed with two children, Marianne and Hans-Jurgen. They emigrated to the U.S.. together and lived in Columbus, Ohio. Anneliese died there many years ago, and both her children have also passed away. Edgar also emigrated to the U.S. with his wife, Liesel Buchdahl from Brilon in Westphalia. Edgar has passed away, but Liesel may still be alive. Carla and Hilla were both married in this country,and lived in Columbus. Carla died a few years ago, and the only survivor, Hilla, lived in St. Louis with her husband Albert (?) Harf, and upon his death moved to a retirement home in Wilmette, Illinois, to be near her daughter Sally. I have visited her there a few times on our visits to neighboring Glencoe. A sister of Max Bachmann, Amanda, lived in Dortmund, where she was married to Louis Wolff. We saw quite a bit of her when we were children, and I remember her three children, all of whom were quite a bit older than Ernest and I, very well indeed. Erich, the eldest, lived in Buffalo with his wife Anita, nee Blum, after his emigration. I saw him there when Mummy and I visited with Tante The Godshaw on the way back to Chicago from a vacation in Canada in 1948. I heard from him again just several years ago, when he had retired to Florida, and shortly thereafter had news of his death. He and Anita have three children. The second, Lotte, I haven't seen since we left Germany. I know that she got married and lived in Newark, N.J., but have never seen her again. Hella told me that she is no longer alive. The youngest, Fritz, went to live on a moshav in Israel, where we visited him in 1962. He had contracted polio while on the moshav and was therefore assigned to office work. I believe I heard through Frieda some years ago that he has died. In addition to Max and Amanda, there was a brother, Felix Bachmann, who was a physician in Hannover, where Mummy's family knew him. I remember him 12 well, although we did not see each other often. His wife's maiden name was Nelly Borgzinner, and their two daughters were named Irene (=Reni) and Ruth. Ruth came to visit us once in Dortmund; Reni,born on September 28, 1915, married, as I mentioned above, Ernst Seligmann (related to us on the Ostwald side), when he worked in Back's store in Horde in the 1930s and I knew both very well; she lived widowed in Los Angeles, where she was in constant touch with Hella, and I heard from her occasionally. A son of theirs, Ralph, also lives in California. Ruth, bom on February 18, 1921, also emigrated to the U.S.and was married to Willi Poliak. Upon his death she moved to Laguna Beach, California, where she still lives. I have been in touch with a few times when I visited Hella in. She has a daughter, Judy, and a son, Oliver. Oliver used to be a university professor in Omaha, Nebraska, but then became a lawyer. There was a further Bachmann brother, Hermann, who lived in Liinen, not far from Dortmund. I remember him quite well, although our families somehow did not have very close contact. I also remember that a son of his (whose name I forget) committed suicide very young early under the Hitler regime. In addition I know of a sister, Mathilde, who was married to a Mr. Frank in Cologne. So much for what I remember about the Bachmann family, and back to Markus and Pinchen Ostwald. They had four children. The eldest, Johanna, was bom on August 5, 1874. She married a very rich man, Bernhard Rose, a banker and business man, with whom she lived in Wanne-Eickel. After my father had finished grade school in Sichtigvor, he lived with them to attend high school (Gymnasium) in the neighboring town of Recklinghausen. They had two daughters, Else and Hilde, who married two brothers, Hugo and Gerhard Halle, respectively. Else Halle, who was bom on November 14, 1897, and died in London a few years ago. She is the mother of Inge Nathan and Herman (formerly Horst) Halle. Hilde (born March 11, 1899) and her husband Gerhard, who was a textile merchant, left Germany (Berlin) very soon after Hitler came to power in 1933 and settled in England. One of the first things they did there was to have themselves and their children baptized in the Anglican church, believing that that would provide them an entry into British society. They were very prosperous to start with, and I remember a weekend Ernest and I spent on their very sumptuous estate in Whyteleafe, Surrey, soon after we arrived in England in early 1939. Later, however, he overextended his business and had to reduce it. This involved at first a 13 move to Macclesfield in Cheshire, and not many years later bankruptcy. Soon thereafter Gerhard died; I last visited Hilde in a small house into which she had to move in 1977 (?). She died there in the early 1980s. She is survived by three sons. The eldest, Claude, is a ne'er-do-well, who lived by all kinds of shady deals, and went from riches to rags and back again. He spent quite a bit of time in Spain, and the last I heard of him was that he was a taxi driver in London. The other two are twins, Bernard and Harold, who rescued of their father's business what could be rescued. Bernard, I understand, has meanwhile retired and lives in Majorca (?); Harold, I believe, is still in Macclesfield. They all married gentile girls and have shown very little interest in their family, and that includes their aunt Else and their cousin Inge. Emmy Ostwald, their second child, was born on July 25, ca.1880. She married Hermann Klein, a small and not very successful business man, who had a shoe store in Langendreer near Dortmund, when I was a little boy. He was a lot of fun, full of funny jokes and tricks, and often came to visit in Sichtigvor, while Ernest and I were there on vacations with Oma. We also went several times to Langendreer to visit them. Their elder daughter, Ilse, bom March 19, 1906 (?), used to work in a shoe store in Dortmund and regularly had dinner (which was in Germany consumed at midday) in our house. She was engaged for many years to Richard Spiegel, a young lawyer, who, like all young Jewish lawyers, was forced out of his profession very early under the Hitler regime, and then became a shirt salesman. They got married when they decided to emigrate to the U.S. By that time the war had already started in Europe, and they had to make their way to the U.S. in a sealed train across Russia to Vladivostok, and thence to the U.S. via Yokohama. They settled in Portland, Oregon. Richard became a travelling salesman and devoted his spare time to painting. I understand that a number of his pictures are now in an art gallery in Portland. We saw Use and Richard a few times when they came to New York to visit Richard's sister, and I visited them once in 1969, when I came back from having taught for the summer at the University of California in Berkeley. Richard died in Portland ca. 1980, and Ilse passed away ca. 1984 on a trip to Hawaii. Use's younger sister, Liesel was born on August 29, 1908. She married Helmut Humberg, who worked in the same bank in which she worked in Essen. They emigrated together to Montevideo, Uruguay, about 1937, where they had a daughter, Monica, who now lives with her husband, Frank Flori, 14 in Portland, Oregon. That family, too, had themselves baptized soon after they reached Uruguay. They returned to Germany from Uruguay shortly before the military coup of 1974 to rescue themselves and their money. Soon after settling in Berlin, Helmut died; Liesel died in Berlin a few years ago. My aunt Rosa was the third child. She was bom on October 4, 1881, and married a wealthy textile merchant, Heinrich Neukircher. Their daughter Hella was bom on October 15, 1910. They lived in Werl on top of their big textile store. A particularly attractive feature of their house was a roof garden, which was rather rare in Germany. Onkel Heinrich was my godfather. He was a rather formal and stiff Victorian gentleman, to whom it was difficult to get close. His wife, Tante Rosa, was just the opposite: she was lively, warmhearted, generous, qualities which her daughter, Hella, inherited from her. There was never any question in my mind that just as Rosa was my favorite aunt, so Hella was my favorite cousin. Also in their house lived two sisters of Onkel Heinrich., both of whom worked in the store. Tante Mathilde was a spinster, and Tante Anna, who operated the cash register, was a big voluminous widow, who had been the second wife of a Mr. Cohen in Strassburg and was thus the stepmother of Alice Witte. As far as I know, Alice was never very close to her stepmother. But she was very fond of Tante Rosa, of Hella, and also liked to talk to my father. And, as you know, she transferred that fondness to me from the time that I came to New York as a graduate student in 1948. Werl was about hallway between Dortmund and Sichtigvor. Whenever Ernest and I went to Sichtigvor by bicycle, which we did fairly frequently after the death of our grandmother, we arranged our trip in such a way that we stopped over in Werl for lunch (which, you must remember, was the main meal in Germany). On every occasion, Tante Rosa packed us a big bag with all kind of goodies to take along: chocolate, raisins, nuts, sausage, etc. A special favorite she used to give us for our mother was a chunk of smoked beef (Rauchfleisch). She was like that also in our grandmother's lifetime: every week she would send a package with all kind of goodies to Oma, not only food but also articles of clothing, books, etc., and every time there was also some kind of toy or delicacy for Ernest and myself. Her specialty for us in those packages was Studentenfutter (a mixture of nuts and raisins). 15 My father, Max, was the youngest Ostwald child. He was bom on June 6, 1884, and was thus ten years younger than his eldest sister, Johanna. To have a male in the family to continue the family name was very important to my grandparents, as it was to most families in Germany. Being the youngest, he was thoroughly spoiled by his sisters. He went to the local school in Sichtigvor until, I suppose, the age of 10. Education has always been important for us Jews, and it must have been for that reason that my grandparents decided that he ought to go to high school. Since all that German law demanded was eight years of grade school, only larger towns had them. That meant that most of the inhabitants of Sichtigvor did not — or could not afford to — give their children an education beyond grade school. It must have been about the time that my father was ready to be sent to high school that my aunt Johanna got married and moved to Wanne-Eickel. The natural thing to do was, therefore, to have my father board with her, while attending the Gymnasium (high school with a classical curriculum) in nearby Recklinghausen for the usual nine-year duration of that part of one's education. It was at that school that he picked up his lasting love for Latin and Greek, which he later instilled in me. After his graduation, it was more or less a foregone conclusion that he should go on to a university. But he could not decide what he wanted to study. It happened that at that time Onkel Bernhard (Tante Johanna's wealthy entepreneur husband) had been involved in a lot of litigation, and he persuaded my grandparents to make my father study law, in the belief that that was one way in which to get rich fast. And my father was willing. University studies in Germany were quite unlike college education in the United States. Students were free to move from one university to another to study with the professors of their choice or to have a change of atmosphere. Since final exams were administered by the state, you could take them at any university after you had attended the specified number of lecture courses. There were practically no scholarship stipends, and there was no tradition of working your way through university. That meant in practice that only people who could afford it sent their children to university, and for the children it meant that they did not have to worry about making a living. The result was that having a good time was as much — or 16 more — of the aim of German students as it was to learn something. I do know from my father that he spent a lot of time with his friends in taverns and at dances, and that he joined a Jewish fraternity. In fact, there was no other kind of fraternity that he could have joined, since gentile fraternities did not accept Jews. Many fraternities, both Jewish and gentile, had the barbarous tradition of having their members prove their masculinity by engaging in saber-duels. If another student insulted you, you were expected to challenge him to a duel, and if no one insulted you, you would insult someone in the hope that he would challenge you. That is the way in which my father acquired deep scars on his right cheek and even two on top of his head. It is significant of the German ethos that these scars were regarded as a mark of honor and that my father was very proud of them. Fraternity life was important enough to my father that I ought to say about it what little I know. The friendships he contracted in them as a student lasted all his life and were extended from his family to the family of his fraternity friends. As far as I know, there was a small number of Jewish fraternities, organized largely along ideological lines. There was at least one Zionist fraternity and one which emphasized a combination of allegiance to Germany with Judaism. It was to the latter group that my father belonged. It was called \"K.C.\", short for \"Kartell Convent\", but what the meaning of that was supposed to be I don't know. But I do know that the members of the K.C. kept up their contacts and published their own little newssheet with personal news even after their emigration. In one of its issues appeared an obituary of my father, written by his friend Bernhard Baruch, who emigrated to France very early during the Hitler regime and vainly tried to persuade my father to move with his family to France. A typed copy of this obituary is among my papers. The chapters to which my father belonged were \"Licaria\", which, I believe, was at the University of Munich, and \"Rheno-Silesia\", which was — but I am not sure — at Bonn. I remember that my father's favorite beer mug had the Licaria coat-of-arms on it, and that it included the motto \"Recht geht vor Macht\" (= \"Law is greater than power\"). Each fraternity brother had (and was always called by) a nickname. My father's was \"Peperl\", a Bavarian form for \"Joseph\", which he was allegedly given, when one of the barmaids in a pub the fraternity frequented in Munich called him by that name. Among our family friends from his fraternity days I remember \"Pisterich\", a lawyer named Erich Simon, who lived in Munster, and \"Pichel\", a bachelor lawyer named Josef 17 Meyersberg from Bochum. Incidentally, Richard Spiegel, the husband of my cousin Use, nee Klein, who emigrated to Portland, Oregon, also was a K.C. member. To describe my father's professional education, I can do no better than to translate the biography which, as was conventionally done, he appended to his published doctoral dissertation. The title of that dissertation is, by the way, “Der Ubergang des gesetzlichen Hypothekentitels bei Abtretung einer Werklohnforderung” (= The transfer of a legal mortgage as an assignment undertaken to satisfy payment for labor performed). “Born on June 6, 1884, in Muhlheim on the Mohne in Westphalia as son of the merchant Markus Ostwald and his wife Philippine, nee Bachmann, I attended the humanistic Gymnasium in Recklinghausen, from which I graduated Easter 1903. I then devoted myself to the study of the law: 3 semesters at the University of Munich, 1 semester at the University of Bonn, and 2 semesters at the University of Munster in Westphalia. On October 4, 1906, I passed my first qualifying examination as a lawyer at the Royal Superior Court in Hamm in Westphalia. Shortly thereafter, I was appointed as a Referendar (= intern) and served in that capacity at the municipal court in Borbeck (Rhineland); at the district court in Dortmund; in the district attorney's office in Dusseldorf; in the office of the attorney Dr. Schoenewald and the notary Counsellor of Justice Goldberg in Bochum; and finally at the municipal court in Munster, where I am currently active. I passed my doctoral examination before the high faculty of Law of the Grand-Ducal Badensian Ruprecht-Karls-University in Heidelberg on the basis of the present dissertation and an oral examination on January 22, 1910.” I know practically nothing of what happened to my father between his service at the municipal court in Munster and his marriage to my mother, except that he settled and opened his law office in Dortmund in 1912, that he was drafted into the German army in World War I; he was not sent to the front because his right hand was crippled. That was due to an injury he had sustained as a boy: when one of his schoolmates made some anti-Semitic remarks, he lunged at him, fell and 18 pierced his palm on a sharp stone. The doctor who treated him did such a poor job that the palm shrivelled, so that he could no longer grasp anything firmly in it. He could hold a pen with it for writing, but that was about all. So his military service was behind the lines. I don't know, either, how long it lasted. Immediately after the war he returned to Dortmund and resumed his law practice there. I think it was in the summer of 1919 that a senior colleague of his, Dr. Max Frank, asked him to take care of any cases that might come up, while he himself was off on a vacation. Dr. Frank's administrative assistant at that time was a young lady named Hedwig Strauss. My father had already been introduced to her family through his cousin, Helene Rosenthal, who was a good friend of Grete Strauss, Hedwig's younger sister. In any event, my father started dating her, and on April 25, 1920, while accompanying her on a shopping trip she had to make to Unna- Konigsbom, they got engaged. The wedding took place in Dortmund on December 19, 1920. I was told that my father appeared for the occasion in his sturdy walking boots. A sociologically interesting point is that up to their engagement my parents addressed each other in the polite form (\"Sie\"); only after that did they use the familiar \"Du\". 2. The Strauss Side On her father's side, my mother's family came from Westphalia; on her mother's from the region around Hannover. I don't know much about the genealogy of her father, Levy Strauss. He was bom in Lippstadt on August 22, 1858, and died in Dortmund on July 10, 1919, from an embolism. His grandfather's name was Moses Strauss and his grandmother's maiden name Berta Camp. Where and when they were bom and died, I do not know. His father's name was Michael Strauss, a merchant by profession, who was bom in Obermarsberg on July 3, 1829, and died in Philadelphia in 1901.1 have been very remiss in trying to find out what brought him to Philadelphia, what he died of, how he died, and where he is buried. But I do intend to try and find out what I can. He married a widow, Frederike 19 Bacharach, nee Ostheimer, who was born in Lipperode on February 2, 1815, and died in Lippstadt on December 4, 1859, i.e., a year and a half after the birth of Levy. I only know that her father's name was Levy Raphael Ostheimer and her mother's Rebekka Lea, nee Edler. I have no information about their birthplace or the dates of their birth and death. I am not even sure how many children they had in addition to Levy. As far as I remember, Levy had a half-sister from his mother's previous marriage, who married Sally Schild in Dortmund. She had died long before I was bom, but I remember very well her husband, who was called \"Onkel Schild\" and who died in his eighties in the early 1930s. He was not tall, but very stately and sported a long dark beard when beards beards were not in fashion. He had a very good sense of humour and was always on the Board of our synagogue. I remember three of his children: Dr. Otto Schild was a very distinguished physician in Dortmund and was our family doctor. Otto’s sister Adele married a Dutchman named Meyer Gompels, with whom she moved to South Africa (I believe it was Capetown) in the 1920s. She had two sons, Joost and Paul, with whom she came to visit her father one time shortly before his death. Trulla told me some years ago that Joost had moved to the U.S. and was living in Westchester County. There was also another son, named Hermann, whom I met only once, and that was at the time of Onkel Schild's funeral. Nobody spoke of him or had any contact with him, which leads me to believe that he was the black sheep of the family. Onkel Otto's wife was Berta, nee Blankenberg. They had two children, several years older than I. Hans completed his studies of medicine very early when Hitler had already come to power, and Grete had to leave university under Hitler without finishing her study of law. Adele helped that whole family to emigrate to South Africa, where they settled in or near Johannesburg. I seem to remember that Onkel Otto got some sort of position on the medical faculty of the University of Johannesburg (Witwatersrand?). Onkle Otto and Tante Berta died quite some time ago. Hans married a gentile South African; Grete lived in Johannesburg with her husband Fred Rothberg, whom she met as a law student in Germany. I know that they have at least one daughter, who once came to visit Trulla. I last heard from Grete after Trulla's death, but haven't had any contact with her since. As for my maternal grandmother, Ida Strauss, nee Weinberg, I know more about her mother's family than her father's. She was bom in Hemeringen, a village not far from Hannover, as the third child of Meyer Weinberg, who was bom in 20 Hemeringen on March 27, 1835, and died there on August 2, 1906. About his ancestors I have no information. Her mother was Selma, nee Abrahamson, who was bom in Gestorf (another little village in the vicinity of Hannover) on December 8, 1835, and died in Hemeringen on December 3, 1898. Selma's father was Isaac Abrahamson, who was born in Gestorf in July 1800 and died in Gestorf in March 1869. His wife was Jeanette, nee Wolff, bom in Mehle on January 23, 1808, and died in Gestorf on May 12, 1904. They had four children, of whom Selma was the youngest. Who the others were I don't know. But I remember their house in Gestorf opposite the village church very well indeed, because as children we visited what was left of that part of the family once or twice with our mother. The house was inhabited at that time by a very old lady named Tante Rickchen, who must have been either a sister or, more likely, a sister-in-law of Selma, and by two unmarried Abrahamsons, Onkel Julius and Tante Ella. Tante Rickchen died in the early 1930s; Julius and Ella Abrahamson never emigrated, as far as I know, and must have perished in the holocaust. Apart from Ida, Meyer and Selma Weinberg had three other children. The eldest was Tante Helene, who was bom in Hemeringen on September 28, 1865. I remember her very well indeed. She never married and, to the best of my knowledge, spent all her adult life in the domestic service of others. When I was a child, she ran the household of a wealthy Jewish family in Bocholt. After her retirement in the early 1930s, she moved to Dortmund, where she lived in rented one- or two-room apartments. My mother was her favorite niece and of her grandnephews she liked me best. Ernest and I visited her often, and she would usually read stories to us and give us candy. Since she did not live far from our high school, we would visit her fairly regularly when we had a free period, which we always had when our gentile classmates would have their religious instmction. She was mn over by a car and killed immediately on February 16, 1938. I well remember her funeral service, which was conducted by Emmanuel Goldschmidt, the father of Uncle Berthold (and husband of Tante Suse), whom you remember from Kew Gardens. Less than a year after Tante Helene, her brother Iwan Weinberg was bom in Hemeringen on May 8, 1866. He was always regarded as the \"rich uncle\". Ida, my grandmother, was his favorite sister, and he lavished gifts on my mother and on 21 Itti, who were his favorite nieces. He lived in Berlin, where he died in 1920. His wife was Elise (called \"Lieschen\"), nee Ephraimson, and they had an adopted son named Rudolf, who later emigrated to South Africa. Tante Lieschen managed to get herself and much of her money to England after Hitler. I remember her only very vaguely, but she used to visit Itti and Trulla quite a bit until some difficulties arose between her and them. I don't know what happened to her, but believe that she went back to Berlin after the war. Although Ida Weinberg came next in line, I shall first mention her younger brother Adolf. I have no birthdate for him, but infer from the will of Iwan, which I found among Trulla's papers, that Adolf had died by the time that will was made on September 10, 1919. He died in Berlin, where he lived at that time with his wife Amalie, nee Wertheimer, having earlier lived in Dortmund. They had two sons and a daughter. Trulla, whom I consulted about these things, knew no more than that the daughter's name was Siddy. A Siddy Weinberg is indeed mentioned in Iwan's will among his nieces, but since he left less than half to her of what he left to his other nieces, I suspect that she had been somehow disowned by the family. The two sons were Werner, who was bom in Dortmund on November 24, 1898, and Hanns, who was bom in Dortmund on May 26, 1900. I knew both and you certainly knew Hanns. Werner emigrated to South Africa, where he was a very prosperous gynaecologist. I met him in the early 1960s, when he tried to establish himself in the U.S. and visited us at the time in Swarthmore; we were still living at 7 Cmm Ledge Lane at that time, and his wife Rubchen came along, too. I remember that he found it difficult to settle in this country and that he returned to South Africa after a few years. He died there in the 1970s. Hanns was a lawyer in Berlin. He managed to emigrate to England shortly before the war and, being a very shrewd business man, established there the Antique Porcelain Company, starting with some valuable pieces that he had brought out with him from Germany. When we (and you) first met him, he had come to New York to open a branch of his company there in the late 1950s, which then became the headquarters of his enterprise. Mummy and I were invited to the very fancy opening: we mbbed elbows there with a lot of upper-class New Yorkers, there were musicians, and so much champagne flowed that I got slightly drunk. Hanns died in New York on June 20, 1976, and the business was taken over by his daughter Rotraut, who is married to the dentist David Beiny. We were in very occasional touch with them, 22 but, as of this writing, we last saw them at Trulla's memorial service in 1986. Hanns's wife, Lisa, nee Wintel, was a good friend of Trulla's for a long time, until they fell out with one another not long before Trulla's death. Since that time, Lisa has avoided contact with any member of our family. Rotraut and David Beiny have two children. The elder, Michelle, is (or was) married in New York, where she worked as a lawyer; what the younger one, David, is now doing, I don't know. Rotraut also has a brother, Horst, who changed his name to Martin Vineyard and, as of last hearing, worked as a surgeon in Syracuse, New York. My grandmother, Ida Weinberg, was born in Hemeringen on July 15, 1867. Her marriage to Levy Strauss took place on March 7, 1888, in Hemeringen, but the two must have moved immediately (or very soon thereafter) to Dortmund, where Levy Strauss was a wholesale merchant in grain. Their eldest daughter, Else, was bom that same year on November 24. She married Leo Weinberg, who came from Fulda to work in her father's office, about 1919 or 1920, and they had one son, Hans (now Harold) Weinberg, bom on July 28,1921, who lived in Heidelberg Heights near Melbourne in Australia. Hans was less than three years old, when his father suddenly died (I think it was of brain hemorrhage) on March 3, 1924. Tante Else never married again. As long as I remember, she made her living as secretary of the Jewish community in Dortmund and stmggled valiantly to bring up her son. She and Hans were very close to us, especially since Hans is only one year older than I. My father tried to be a father to Hans, and, although that sort of thing was never talked about in our house, I suspect that he also contributed to his and Else's financial support. Hans came to England a few months after Ernest and I did, but our contacts with him were sporadic, since he lived in Ealing (outside London) while Ernest and I lived first in Ramsgate and later in Bournemouth, and neither he nor we had enough money to travel. Tante Else never succeeded in emigrating; like my parents she was deported to Theresienstadt, and, according to my mother's last letter, died there on July 31, 1944. Hans was interned in England a little after I was, and he was among those who were sent to Australia, where, incidentally, he met your Uncle Steve. He joined the army after his release from camp, and after he was demobilized married an Irish-Australian girl named Aileen. You met his daughter Marie Else, bom February 23, 1947, when she came to Swarthmore to visit us on her honeymoon with her husband Barry Klein. Hans was a retired 23 bookkeeper and accountant, when he died a few years ago. I am still in occasional touch with Marie, who lives in Bulleen, a suburb of Melbourne. My mother Hedwig was the second of the six daughters of Levy and Ida Strauss. But I shall first talk about her younger siblings. Next after her came Grete, bom in Dortmund on December 19, 1890. As long as I knew her she lived in Berlin, where she was married to Richard Jonas and had with him a daughter, Eva, who was born in Berlin on October 1, 1923, i.e., she was about six months younger than Ernest. She was a very lovely and beautiful girl, and the few occasions on which she came to visit us in Dortmund were always a great event. We were also very fond of Tante Grete and Onkel Richard, who came with her on one occasion, when I remember they brought us toy versions of a dmm worked with a foot-pedal and other percussion instmments of the kind played in jazz bands by one person, i.e., triangle, cymbal, etc. Onkel Richard was a lot of fun and entertained us with his piano playing. But as I was told later, he was also quite a philanderer, and that seems to have been the reason why he and Grete got divorced ca. 1930. Not long thereafter, about 1934,1 remember a lot of excitement and telephone calls between my parents and Tante Grete one Sunday ca.1934: Richard had suddenly vanished and was soon found dead as a suicide. As I mentioned earlier, financial affairs were never discussed in the presence of us children, but I have the impression that Grete depended on his alimony payments, which now ceased. In any event, she moved with Eva into a small apartment on Schliiterstrasse in Berlin, and eked out a living by sewing gloves and decorative flowers. But she was a lovely, warmhearted, and generous woman, very fat, and we loved her dearly. When Ernest and I visited Berlin for the first time for the Olympic Games in 1936, Ernest stayed with her, while I stayed with a client of my father on the Kurfurstendamm, who had invited one of us to stay with her. And upon our release from the concentration camp in December 1938, Tante Grete was the person for whom we headed before going home to Dortmund. In fact, that is the last time we saw Tante Grete and Eva. They never managed to leave Germany, and I believe that both were killed ca. 1943. Eva, I seem to have heard, was married to someone at that time, who also lost his life to the Nazis. Else, Hedwig, and Grete were the only Strauss girls ever to be married, and my mother was the only one whose marriage was smooth and happy. The three 24 youngest, Elfriede (called Friedchen), bom March 4, 1892, Gertrude (Trulla), bom September 18, 1893, and Louise (Lieschen, named Itti by her nephews and niece), bom September 3, 1895, never got married. They lived together in their parents' three-story house on Zweite Kampstrasse 18, and my parents moved into the ground floor of that house when they were first married. It is in that house that I and Ernest were bom. Friedchen was a teacher at the Jewish elementary school, where her colleagues and close friends were the three Schanzer girls: Tante Suse (later the wife of Berthold Goldschmidt) and her unmarried sisters Alice and Helma. She was a very cultivated lady who travelled a lot and even went to visit Paris at a time when foreign travel was fairly unusual among middle-class German Jews. I always went to her when I had trouble with my homework in the first two grades. She died of a strep throat while on a vacation in Freudenstadt on August 26, 1930.1 remember that we were in Sichtigvor at the time, when my mother was called to the railroad station to take a telephone call (practically no one in Sichtigvor had a phone at that time, and all important calls came to the railroad station); she returned in tears and completely distraught with the sad news, since she had been particularly close to Friedchen. She immediately left for Dortmund, and my father went to Freudenstadt to bring her mortal remains home. Friedchen was only 38 at the time of her death, the first of the sisters to die. She is buried on the Hauptfriedhof in Dortmund, where Mummy and I visited her grave when we went through Germany on our way to Rome in September 1986. Trade ran a very fancy chocolate and coffee store in Dortmund, located in the center of the city, near the market place. It had originally been bought by her father for her and her sister Grete, but when Grete married, Trulla took over. Her customers came from the uppermost social classes: industrialists, directors of coal and iron mines, owners of big department stores, doctors, lawyers, etc., and she was always very deferential to her clientele. The store was on the way to and from the Gymnasium, and Ernest and I often stopped by because we could usually count on getting a piece of chocolate. In addition, whenever we got a test back in school, Trulla would give us 5 pfennige for a \"B\" and 10 pfennige for an \"A\". Sometimes during vacations we made a little pocket money by making deliveries to her customers on our bicycles. 25 As children, Itti was our very favorite aunt. She and Trulla (and, until her death, also Friedchen) lived together all their lives, except for short periods in England, when they had jobs in different households. Itti was always rather frail. She was in Germany never gainfully employed but ran the household for Trulla and herself. She was easy-going and spoiled us quite a bit. In addition, she was very musical and played the piano quite well. Her favorite opera was \"Carmen\", and she would spend hours playing the opera to us on the piano and singing the more notable songs. Their house on Zweite Kampstrasse 18 was just down the street from Zweite Kampstrasse 3, where my parents moved when I was about three or four years old, and we visited them very very often. On that same street, about half-way between our house and the aunts' was the Jewish Elementary School, where Friedchen taught and which both Ernest and I attended. My mother, Hedwig, was, as already mentioned, bom as the second child of Levy and Ida Strauss on November 27, 1889. For reasons that can't quite understand (and to which Trulla did not know the answer, either), she was not brought up by her parents but by her maternal grandparents in Hemeringen. I'm not sure how old she was when she went there, but she can't have been much more than 3 or 4 years old. All I was told that, on a visit by my grandparents to Hemeringen, Ida's parents said: \"Why don't you leave the little one with us?\", and that that offer was accepted. Since Else, Hedwig, and Grete were bom within a year of one another, I can imagine that my grandmother felt that she had too much on her hands, appreciated the relief (possibly in the expectation that Hedwig wouldn't stay in Hemeringen very long), and agreed to leave Hedwig there, when she saw how much she meant to her parents. But that is only a guess. In any event, there is no indication whatever that my mother ever felt abandoned or resented that her parents had left her with her grandparents; on the contrary, she was very devoted both to her grandparents and her parents, and was always happy to have been brought up in the country. She got all her schooling in the village school in Hemeringen. She took Ernest and me on a visit there about 1930, and on that occasion we were also introduced to Mr. Hillebrecht, who had been her teacher. There are pictures taken on that visit in one of my photo albums. I don't know how long my mother stayed in Hemeringen. Since her grandmother died in 1898, when my mother was nine years old, and her 26 grandfather eight years later, she must have left soon thereafter. From there she went to Cologne, where she stayed with her Tante Helene and had some schooling in French, English, sewing, cooking, etc., presumably at some finishing school. I know that she was friendly there with Hans Wilhelm Steinberg, who later became the conductor of the Pittburgh orchestra, and his brother Walter. I have in my library a book, Rudolf Baumbach, Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen, which they gave to her on June 5, 1906, and inscribed: \"Zur freundl. Erinnerung der lieben 'grossen' Hedwig von ihren treuen Freunden Wilhelm und Walter Steinberg\" (\"To our dear 'big' Hedwig in friendly remembrance from her loyal friends Wilhelm and Walter Steinberg\"). She went to many concerts and operas there, and probably developed her liking for art in the local museum. There is a considerable gap in my knowledge also about what happened between her stay in Cologne and her engagement to my father in 1920. The presumption is that she went to Dortmund to stay at her parents' house at some point before war broke out in 1914, and that she spent the war years in Dortmund. Nor do I know how long she had been Dr. Frank's secretary by the time she met my father. Of the beginning of their courtship I have one piece of evidence, a book by Wilhelm Bode, Der Weimarische Musenhof inscribed: \"Dr. Max Ostwald s/1. Frl. Hedwig Strauss zur frdl. Erinnerung an die gemeinsame Tatigkeit in den Gerichtsferien 1919 und mit herzlichem Danke fur die tatkraftige Unterstiitzung. Dortmund, d. 6. Sept. 1919\" (\"Dr. Max Ostwald to his dear Miss Hedwig Strauss to remember their cooperation in the lawcourt recess of 1919 with cordial thanks for her energetic support. Dortmund, September 6, 1919\"). At that time, my mother's father had been dead for just two months (he died of an embolism in his leg), and her mother was to die some six months later. And a month after that, on April 25, 1920, my parents got engaged. I remember being told one story about the time of their courtship. It was the time immediately after the end of the war and there was a considerable food shortage in Germany. One day, when my father got hold of some meat, he sent it to my mother, but was very surprised that she never thanked him for it. So on their next date he asked her whether his package had ever reached her. My mother blushed and apologized for not thanking him. \"Did you enjoy the meat?\", my father asked. Blushing even more, my mother replied: \"I'm sorry, but I had to throw it away, because it was horse meat.\" 27 As already mentioned, the wedding took place in Dortmund on December 19, 1920, and thirteen months later, I was bom. II. CHILDHOOD: 1922-33 January 15, 1922, the day of my birth, was a Sunday, and a lot of fuss was always made about the fact that I was a \"Sunday child\". A lot of fuss was made for another reason, too: I was the first male to be bom into the Ostwald family since my father. He was the only male in his generation, and all his three sisters had exclusively female offspring. To have male offspring was important to most German-Jewish families, and it was also important for Germans living in the country, because that way the family name would be perpetuated. I was told that the first reaction of my father to my birth was: \"Unser Mama wird verruckt werden!\" (\"Mama [referring of course to his own mother] will go out of her mind with happiness\"). A telegram was at once dispatched to Sichtigvor, and the elderly postmistress (Fraulein Vetter) ran from her post office in Muhlheim half a mile away all the way up the hill to our house to deliver it personally to my grandmother. A week later Oma came to Dortmund to hold me at my Brit Milah. I was bom at home at Zweite Kampstrasse 18 (hospital births were very rare in those days) and the doctor who delivered me was my mother's cousin, Onkel Otto Schild. In following a family tradition going back to my great-grandfather, I was given a name starting with the letter \"M\". I ought to mention here that very soon after my birth my mother started some kind of a diary for me, in which she entered every congratulatory note that arrived. After that, she made some sporadic entries only. I was given this diary on my Bar Mitzvah. My father wrote a very moving message into it (which I intend to translate later in this narrative), and I added some entries later, whenever something that moved me happened. The relevant parts of that will also be translated in their proper place. That book is still in my possession: it was one of the few things I took with me out of Germany when we left in 1938. There is also a 28 very beautiful small book in which my mother recorded my weight for the first few months of my life. Although I do not remember it, the first important event in my life took place exactly fourteen months after I was bom. On March 15, 1923, was the birthday of my brother Ernst Levy, whose second name commemorated my maternal grandfather. It is very difficult to put into words how very close we were to one another. It was not only a matter of being close in age, and certainly not at all a matter of being similar in temperament. Even the little you are likely to remember of your Uncle Ernest will include the difference between us. Ernest was much more outgoing than I am; he was very quick-witted; much more intelligent than I; and a much better student in school. He was always thin, I on the fat side. (In fact, I was often referred to as \"Der Dicke\" [\"fatso\"]). Somehow our differences complemented one another's. I had a tremendous admiration of him and he for me. We always did everything together and were never separated from one another until February 1939, when, as I will describe later, he found a job as a waiter in Bournemouth a few weeks before I did; I had to stay a little longer in the farm camp where the English refugee committee had accommodated us, but then I,too, got a waiter’s job in Bournemouth. Because of the different locations of the hotels in which we worked, we no longer lived in the same house, and when internment came we were separated permanently, because I was interned first and soon sent to Canada; by the time he was interned, no more refugees were sent overseas. The memories of the first six years of my life are very hazy indeed. I was told when Minna Wigrewe, who was my nursemaid (and whom I actually vaguely remember), carried me on her arms to show me my baby brother for the first time, I said:\"Puppa, soil nicht in meine Heia!\" (\"A doll, don't put it in my crib\"). Soon after I had learned to walk, I toddled into the kitchen, opened a cupboard, and pulled out the meatgrinder, which promptly landed on my right big toe. As a result, the growth of its nail has been freaky ever since. My very earliest spotty memories go back to scenes in the hospital, into which I was taken at age 3 to have my appendix removed. I seem to remember a mask being placed on my face for the anaesthetic and to be given drink from a cup with a spout. I also vaguely remember my mother being with me in the hospital room all the time. The operation was per¬ formed by Professor Henle. Another memory of this whole period is the 29 paediatrician who looked after us. He was a lovely man with a deep gentle voice, Dr. Fritz Levy. Ernest and I loved him, and we were very sad, when he died (from nicotine poisoning, I seem to remember) in the early 1930s. I also have a vague recollection of being on a boat in rough seas, when I was about 4 or 5 years old. That must have been en route to either Binz on the island of Rugen or Norderney, where our mother took us in successive summers for vacations. When I was five, my tonsils were clipped by Dr. Hans Lion in his office. What I remember about that is that, before giving me the anaesthetic, he asked me to count as far as I could, and I promptly and proudly told him that I could count up to 16. It must have been early in this period that we moved from Zweite Kampstrasse 18, the house that used to belong to my maternal grandfather, Levi Strauss, to Zweite Kampstrasse 3. It was a big three-storey house, of which we occupied the first two floors. We had a store room and larder on the top floor to store the preserves my mother made every year; the rest of it was rented to a couple called Korbmacher. The house was not ours; we rented it from the city. We lived there until about 1937, when we were evicted as being Jewish, and moved then to an apartment at Schwanenwall 46. The bottom floor had a large living room, dining room, men's parlor, and a big kitchen with a larder right next to it. Upstairs were our playroom with bathroom right next to it, one big bedroom for Ernest and me, and another for my parents, and a big guest room. In addition, there was a small room for the maid. There was one toilet on the landing between the two floors and another along the passage that led from the groundfloor into the garden. As in England, toilets were usually separate and not part of the bathroom. The garden was fairly big and Ernest and I spent most of our time playing there. It consisted of a big bordered lawn around which there was a gravel path, lined with beds of fern. On the lawn we had a tall pear tree, from which the birds benefitted more than we did, and in the far left comer was a chestnut tree, around which a table had been built on which afternoon coffee was served, when we had guests. But most important of all, part of the garden was fenced off for the doghouse, which was the home of Kuno, a lovely and gentle German shepherd dog, whom we loved dearly and who was an important part of our childhood. When my father had to put him to sleep about 1935, it was a very sad occasion for the whole family. 30 Our household menage consisted not only of the family, but also a maid to do the heavy work, such as cleaning, washing, and cooking and a nanny to take care of Ernest and me, so as to give our mother time to engage in the kind of social activities that were expected of a good bourgeois housewife. These included in our mother's case very active engagement in the Judische Frauenbund, a Jewish women's organization concerned with social work among indigent Jews, much like the Hadassah in this country and in Israel. In addition, she was also very active in the Chevra Kadisha, which prepared the dead for burial in the Jewish tradition. After Tante Friedchen's death in 1930, we no longer kept a nanny; for a while we had a part-time lady to take care of us between the end of the schoolday and dinner, but, as far as I remember, that lasted for less than a year. Every Monday was laundry day. We had a washing machine, driven by water power in the basement, and a washing woman came to help our maid with the job. Then there was also a seamstress, who would come every now and then to repair torn clothes and do simple sewing jobs on our sewing machine. The main meal in Germany used to be consumed at midday; in our house usually between 1 and 2 p.m. It was a always a warm three-course family meal in the dining room, served by the maid, who, together with nanny, had her meal in the kitchen. One constant participant in that meal throughout the 1930s was our cousin Use Klein (later married to Richard Spiegel). She commuted every day from Fangendreer to Dortmund, where she worked as section head in a very fancy shoe store. The evening meal consisted mainly of sandwiches and cold cuts and was taken about 8 p.m. One of the rules established by our parents was that we had to eat whatever was put on our plate, except that we could choose any two items that would be exempted from that rule. In my case the two items were asparagus (which I now love) and tomatoes (which I still don't like in their raw state). For our birthdays we could determine the menu. I always asked for roast goose and strawberries with whipped cream for dessert. Apart from the trips to Binz and Nordemey, our travelling was largely confined to Sichtigvor to visit our Oma. It is with Sichtigvor that the happiest and most carefree times of my life are associated. My father was very close to his mother and went to visit her about every other Sunday. Since he was inordinately fond of hiking (both by himself and in company), he would usually take the train to 31 some spot, from which he could hike through the beautiful forest (Amsberger Wald) to Sichtigvor in two or three hours and then come home by train at night. He would then carry a rucksack with provender along, and would often bring back with him some goodies from Oma for Ernest and me. On those Sundays we would take walks with our mother in one or another of the lovely parks near Dortmund, visit the aunts, or spend time with Tante Else and Hans, with whom we were also very close in age as well as in feeling. On some occasions, we would all go to Sichtigvor together for a day or more, but there were regularly two or three periods each year (Christmas, Easter, and the summer), when our parents would take us to Sichtigvor and leave us there for two weeks or more, and go themselves on vacations to the Alps or some other nice place, mainly to go hiking by themselves or with some friends. In fact, from the time that I started going to school in 1928 until Oma's death in 1934, there was not a single vacation which Ernest and I did not spend in Sichtigvor. To get from Dortmund to Sichtigvor took about an hour. You took a train to Soest, where you changed into a rural train that connected Soest with Brilon, and on which Sichtigvor was one of the stops. The train was popularly called the \"Bimmelbahn\", because the engine had a bell that rang constantly. The nice thing about changing trains was that we always were treated to a glass of raspberry juice (\"Himbeersaff') between trains at the station in Soest. At the station in Sichtigvor Frieda (and in our early years sometimes also Oma) were waiting, and together we would traipse the two hundred yards or so to our house. It was a big half-timbered house with the beams painted black and the rest whitewashed. The roof was made of slate; under the eaves there were always swallows' nests. Five or six steps led to a stoop, flanked by cast-iron benches on either side, where Oma would sit with us in the evenings. As one entered the house, the living room (which was also the dining room) was on the left; on the right there was the \"Laden\", the shop in which my grandfather and great-grandfather sold clothes and textiles. You entered the store through a smaller oblong room, which must originally have been used for storage; after my grandfather's death and until shortly after World War I, Oma used it for selling wooden clogs and chickenfeed. In our time, both it and the large actual store beyond it were only used for general storage. In fact, as far as I remember, the store itself, although it still contained its original counters and shelves, was only used for us and our friends to play in on rainy days. I remember 32 an occasion when we gave a performance of a puppet play in it for the family. It was also the scene of Oma’s 80 th -birthday celebration, of which more later. Behind the living room was the spacious kitchen. It had a big stone sink and water was supplied by a handpump. There was a big coal-burning stove for cooking and in a comer next to it an old wooden chair, where Oma would usually be sitting doing her knitting. Opposite it was a counter for preparing food for cooking and on its comer stood the milk-separator, in which each evening cream would be extracted from some of the milk that the milking maid had taken from our cow. There was also a cylindrical upright vat for making butter and a net for making cottage cheese. We always had our own butter and milk, and often also cottage cheese, which was then often converted into \"Kochkase\" (something like Limburg cheese). Behind the kitchen was a small dining room, which must orginally have been for the hired help, but in our time it was partly a larder and sometimes we would have our meals there. A stairway led from the kitchen to the cowpen in the basement. As long as Oma was alive we always had a cow, and the cow had a calf regularly every year, fathered for pay at one of the local farms. We had two large meadows, about half a mile from the house, to which the cow would be taken every morning (usually by the maid) and from which Ernest and I, often with some of our friends, would bring it back into her pen for milking every evening. Calves were kept for some six to eight weeks and then sold to the local butcher. There was also a third meadow about two miles from the house, the grass of which was cut for hay every fall to feed the cow during the winter. A steep stairway led from the hall to the upper floor. To the right of its head was first a small room in which the maid slept, and next to it a huge bedroom with some four or five beds and a coal stove. This is where Ernest and I usually slept. On the other side of the stair-head was Oma's bedroom, next to it another guest bedroom with two beds, and opposite it Frieda's room. Beyond the stair-head a very big room containing old newspapers and a square wooden box with a hole on top was the toilet. The excrement dropped straight onto the dung heap, which was emptied several times each year and its content used for manuring the garden. There was no toilet paper: newspaper was cut into squares for that purpose. All that changed in 1928, when the village laid a waterline, which not only brought tap water into the kitchen, but also caused the replacement of the box by a W.C. 33 The house had no bath and no washbasin. Each bedroom had a ceramic basin and a ewer for daily use, and every Friday night, a big zinc vat was brought into the kitchen, in which Frieda gave Ernest and me a bath. Water for that purpose was heated on the stove. Moreover, since the bedrooms were not heated, marble slabs were heated in the oven every winter evening, a towel was wrapped around them, and there were placed into each bed about half an hour before bedtime, so that the bed was nice and warm by the time we were ready to go to sleep. The land we owned around the house was some four or five acres in size. On the gentle slope that rose behind the house (“Hammerberg”) was our potato field, and adjacent to it a patch of woods that descended into the dip through which a little brook flowed into the Mohne, one of the more important rivers of the Sauerland, which is the name of this part of Westphalia. It ended in a grassy incline on which stood two or three plum trees, which yielded lovely little round sweet plums. On the right as one faces the house there was a largish garden, which supplied most of the fruit and vegetables for the house. There were beans, peas, carrots, cabbage, lettuce, cauliflower, cucumbers, red beets, white beets, turnips, etc. We had rhubarb, gooseberries, red currants, apples, pears, and plums, and there were flowers all over the place. At one end, there was an arbor, which had a slate- topped table and benches in it. It wasn't used very much in my time, but I think my cousins Hella, Use, and Eiesel used it quite a bit in their childhood. Many names of family members were scratched into it. They were copied by Willi Hecker and a copy of it is in my files. At Willi’s suggestion, we placed it into a local museum. Opposite the garden towards the potato field stood an old bam, in which my great¬ grandfather and grandfather used to keep their horse and carriage. The latter I still remember playing on in my earliest days in Sichtigvor, but it was gone by ca. 1927. The main use of this bam was as a chicken coop and as a stable for the goat (named “Hopli”) which Oma kept for a while. The barn also had an upstairs, where the hay was stored that was cut from the more distant field that I mentioned above. It was used for feeding the cow in the winter. Incidentally, bringing in that hay was always a very special treat. Oma would hire neighbors to cut the grass (by hand with a scythe) and spread it for drying; when it had dried, it would be loaded on a horse-drawn wagon, a beam would be put on top and tied down at the sides so 34 as to keep the hay in place, and we would ride on top of the hay the two miles back to the house, where the hay was loaded into the loft of the bam. Another smaller garden, also with fmit, vegetables, and flowers (and a favorite bench of Oma's) was on the other side of the house, on the left as you face it, just below the potato field. So we had always plenty of room to play in and we spent practically all our time outdoors. There was no danger from traffic. Hardly any cars were on the road in those days and most of the vehicles that passed the house would be horse-drawn—even more usually cow-drawn— wagons loaded with hay or farm produce. The permanent inhabitants of the house were Oma, Frieda, and Emilie. Emilie Hillebrandt was a girl from the village, who did the hard work around the house: cleaning, washing, milking the cow, and so forth. She was still alive and was overjoyed to see us, when we visited Sichtigvor in 1986. Frieda's position was that of a companion and housekeeper. She was always regarded as a member of the family. Her parents had come to Germany from Poland in the early 1900s (I believe) and died when Frieda was still very young. Frieda was then sent to a Jewish agricultural school (Ahlem), where she learned housekeeping, and soon after the end of World War I, when Oma had recently been widowed, was taken into our house. In addition to getting room, board, and pay, Oma as well as her children regularly brought her sheets, blankets, dishes, clothes, and household articles to save as a dowry. But in a village, in which there were no other Jewish families, it was difficult for Frieda to have a social life, in which she would meet marriageable young men. If she resented or regretted that, she never told me so, and I don't think I am kidding myself in believing that she never harbored feelings of that sort. She had a brother, Fritz (now Ephraim), who emigrated first to Cyprus and then to Palestine as a farmer about the time that she came to Oma. He lived in Beth Yitzchak, where we visited him and his family in 1962. She also had a sister (I think her name was Warda), who also lived in Israel, but I am not sure where she lived while Frieda was in our house. Being orphaned, Frieda thus had no family except for us, and since she was utterly devoted to Oma and reciprocated our feelings for her, we were her family. An indication of that is the fact that all my cousins and myself have never lost contact with her, and even in Israel her closest friend was Liese Alexander, who after all was also a member of the Ostwald 35 family. Frieda stayed in the house until shortly after Oma's death. As far as I recollect, she then spent some time on the agricultural school (Ahlem) from which she had come to our house, and emigrated from there to Palestine by contracting a phoney marriage to a Jewish man, from whom she got divorced as soon as she was settled in Palestine. She made her living there by working as a housekeeper in various families until she retired into the pleasant retirement community in Haifa. As she got more and more frail she moved into a retirement home in Bet Yitzchak to be close to her family,where we visited her every time we were in Israel. She died there a few years ago. I am still in touch with her niece Esther and her husband Zvi Heller in Bet Yitzckak. It is difficult for me to say anything significant about Oma. I was about 12 1/2 years old when she died at the age of 85 on October 17, 1934. My memories of her are, therefore, those of a child and may be gilded by the more than seventy years that have passed since I last knew her. If one considers that she was 73 and 74, respectively, when Ernest and I were bom, it is remarkable that the company of two lively little boys in her otherwise quiet house was never too much for her. I do not remember her ever in a bad mood, never annoyed by our being too noisy, never raising her voice or rebuking us. For that matter, I don't remember her ever speaking ill of anyone. When there was someone ill in the village, she would send us to take some goodies to that person's house. She would play our table games with us, and she would tell us stories. I still remember a little ditty (of the \"patty cake\" variety) that she must have sung to us when we were about three years old. I also remember an occasion during the Easter vacations ca. 1932 or 1933, when she asked me to read her a letter which had arrived that day from my mother. It contained a sentence which ran something like: \"Trade's (=Tralla) has made a thumping business this season; on one day alone she took in over 1,000 marks. But please don't tell the children; it's none of their business.\" When I had read that sentence, Oma said quietly: \"I haven't told you anything about that, have I? But don't tell your mother that you know.\" She knew that we had a passion for the way she made waffles, and there'd always be at least one big waffle feast for us every vacation. I don't think she had an enemy in the village (or in the world, for that matter); that came home to me with special force when I listened to what people said about her on our visit to Sichtigvor in 1986. She radiated love and affection to such a degree that her house was regarded as the center of the family in the widest 36 sense. It is largely due to the impact she left on the community that a bronze memorial plaque was affixed to our house on November 9 th , 2008. The seventieth anniversary of the “Crystal Night.” That Oma was the center of the family was especially evident on the celebration of her 80th birthday on January 29, 1929. I vividly remember the occasion. The entire family was present, including all kinds of cousins, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and so on. A big dinner was served in the store (the \"Laden\"), which usually stood empty. Ernest and I recited congratulatory poems which my mother had composed to celebrate the event, one of which I still remember, and I also remember most of the song she composed to be sung to the tune of a popular student song, which was sung after dinner by the whole assemblage. It celebrated, among other things, the demise of the old rickety toilet and sang the praises of the recently installed W.C. It also contained a reference to a remark she once made, when someone sent her a box of grapefruit, which were regarded as a rare delicacy in Germany at that time. Oma thought it was a pity to throw away the grapefruit peels instead of using them to put flowers in. So Ernest and I gave her a bunch of violets in half a grapefruit shell, and an accompanying poem duly recorded that gift. Oma had neighbors over to the house for a cup of coffee almost every afternoon, and she had some very close friends among the Catholic sisters in the convent in Sichtigvor. When Frieda saw that her end was near on October 17, 1934, she sent to the convent to summon one of Oma's favorite sisters, and while Frieda said the \"sh'ma yisrael\" over her, the sister closed Oma's eyes and said one of her own prayers. Later she told my father that in the absence of a rabbi God would surely accept the last offices of a Catholic sister. Oma's mortal remains were prepared in her house for the funeral. The simple coffin, prescribed by our religion, was made by the local carpenter, Mr. Eichhoff. My father, who went to Sichtigvor immediately on learning of her death, insisted on seeing his mother once more before the coffin was closed. He told me later that there was nothing he had done in his life that he regretted more: instead of remembering his mother as she had been active around the house, he could not get the image of her lying peacefully in her coffin out of his mind. The funeral to 37 which of course Ernest and I came was especially remarkable in view of the fact that Hitler was already in power and the general attitude to the Jews quite precarious. But in spite of that, the Veterans Organization of Sichtigvor insisted on providing the pallbearers and the hearse to take Oma to her grave, because they felt that, as the widow of one of its members, she was entitled to it. From our house to the Jewish cemetery in Warstein, where she was buried next to her husband, is a distance of about 7 miles. All members of the family and about fifty villagers walked behind the horse-drawn hearse all the way to the cemetery. The eulogy was delivered by a Jewish teacher, Mr. Fritzler, who came from a neighboring small town (Ruthen), where his family had been friends with ours for several generations. (Incidentally, in smaller German Jewish communities, the Jewish teacher, in addition to being responsible for the teaching of Hebrew and of religious studies, usually conducted services and officiated at funerals and weddings.) Some years ago, I translated that eulogy into English and gave it to you. How did we spend our times in Sichtigvor? I already said that we were mostly outdoors, where there was unlimited space to play. Our playmates were the neighbors' children, especially the Peitz children, who lived directly opposite us. There were at least 12 of them. After all, Sichtigvor was entirely Catholic and there was no such thing as birth-control. Their father worked in the local chain factory, where heavy chains for ships and industrial use were manufactured by hand. Every worker had his own little furnace in which he would heat U-shaped pieces of steel rod and then hammer them into chain links on his anvil. Every day one of the children would have to take the father's hot lunch in two enamelled metal pots placed in a metal carrier to the factory (a distance of about 11/2 miles), and we would often accompany them. The father of another friend of ours, Fritz Flocke (or Amerikens Fritz, as he was called—more about that appellation later) had his own little smithy in which chains were made for the factory, and we spent much of our time in it watching the men work. Sometimes they would make a hoop for us from an odd steel rod. I might as well insert here a remark on the names of the villagers. Although everybody had of course a first name and a surname for official purposes, people were ordinarily not called by their surnames but by the name of the original owner 38 of the house in which they lived, the first name following the name of the house. For example, although everybody knew that my name is Martin Ostwald, I would be referred to as \"Menkens Martin\". In other words, since my great-grandfather, Menke, had been the original owner of our house, our family was called \"Menken\"; Fritz Flocke's house belonged originally to a man called \"Amerike\", so that his family was \"Ameriken\", etc. One other peculiarity: although everybody knew how to speak proper German, most people spoke \"plattdeutsch\" or Low German. It is not a written language, but the language of the simple common people. Many of our friends had learned the proper (or \"High\") German only at school or in the church. To us city folks they would always speak in High German. But, for example, Oma would talk Low German to all her village friends. My father also spoke Low German fluently and would use it in his conversation with the villagers, whenever he came to Sichtigvor. He had many clients among them, who trusted him and regarded him as one of them. Ernest and I spoke a little Platt, but understood it well. That stood us in good stead later, when we went to Holland, for Dutch is fairly close to Westphalian Low German. Our life in Sichtigvor was almost exclusively outdoors. When it rained, we took our friends into the large Laden in the house or else went to one of their homes to play. Our main games outdoors were hide-and-seek, flying kites, swimming in the Mohne, going for walks, etc. The kites we flew we made ourselves. The local carpenter would give us two slats, which we would nail together cross-shaped; grooves would be cut into the four ends and a piece of string laid through them to connect the four ends and make the frame of the kite. For the body of the kite we placed newspaper around the frame and glued it with a mixture of flour and water. One piece of string was attached to the front of the kite to attach the long kite-flying string to, and another to the bottom to make a tail into which we knotted either pieces of newspaper or of grass to give the whole thing balance. There were many meadows into which we would go to fly the finished product; our favorite was the public soccer field. Another favorite activity was to make whistles from willow branches and (non-smokable) pipes from bullrushes. The spokes of old umbrellas were used to make bows from. We would bunch them together with pieces of wire, attach a piece of strong string to the ends, and then cut arrows from willow trees and tip 39 them with empty shells the forester gave us. That was lovely for target practice, and I must add that, as far as I remember, no one ever got hurt. There were two highpoints to every year in Sichtigvor. One was the \"Schiitzenfest\" about mid-summer. It was arranged by and for the Veterans Organization and consisted of shooting down a wooden bird which had been fixed on top of a pole in the middle of a field. Each member would take a shot and the one whose shot got the bird down was declared \"king\" (and his wife or girl-friend \"queen\"). They were escorted around the village in a procession with a brass band, flags, etc., and of course we'd march along. Usually a travelling fun-fair came to Sichtigvor on this occasion with all kinds of booths, merry-go-rounds, and so forth. As already mentioned, the fact that my grandfather was a member of this Veterans organization made it supply the hearse on which Oma's coffin was transported to the Jewish cemetery in Warstein in 1934, even though Opa had been dead for 20 years by that time. The other highpoint was harvest time, when the farmers helped one another cut and bring in the various kinds of grain (mainly rye and wheat, but also some barley) that they grew. The grain was cut manually with scythes, then loaded on waggons very much like the hay I mentioned earlier, and taken to the farmyard. There it was tossed into a big threshing machine, rented for the purpose, and the grain separated from chaff and straw. The grain was usually kept for making flour (or to be sold to a flour mill) and the straw kept as bedding for the farm animals. We loved watching the proceedings and often participated in throwing the grain into the hopper. I remember also one occasion on which Ernest and I participated with many of our friends in laying the roof for a farmer's bam. We formed a long chain from the floor to the roof, and each shingle was passed along to be put on the roof by whoever was stationed there. For the afternoon's work we were paid the munificent sum of 1 mark, which, however, gave us a sense of having worked for what we got. All this also gave a feeling of being accepted by the villagers for what we were: as the only Jewish family in Sichtigvor, to be sure, we were regarded as \"different\", and this was underscored by the fact that our permanent residence was in the big town, i.e., that Ernest and I, at least, were not part of the regular year-round scene. Still, we were no strangers, and there certainly was no anti-Semitism until shortly before the war. One of the clearest indications of that is 40 that on more than one occasion we were invited to participate together with our neighbors' children in the village celebration of the \"Feast of the Magi\" (Epiphany) on January 6th. This feast celebrates the homage paid, according to the New Testament, to the Christ-child by the three magi from the East. Teams of three children would dress up in masks and exotic costumes as the magi and go from house to house, singing in each a song about the magi and ending up with a request for money, very much as children do in this country on Halloween. That we were Jewish and did not believe in any of this disturbed neither the friends with whom we teamed up nor the people whose homes we visited. I have stretched the limits of this chapter to approximately October 1934, when Oma died, since her death marks the end of our regular vacation visits to Sichtigvor, and thus an important marker in my life. There must now be added a brief account of my early schooldays. I entered school on April 17, 1928, at the normal age of six. In Germany at that time, all public elementary schools were denominational; that is, wherever numbers warranted it, there were separate elementary schools for Catholics, Protestants (mostly Lutherans), and Jews. Dortmund, being a large city, had a sufficiently large Jewish population to have its own Jewish elementary school, and it was run at public expense, though I am not sure whether the state or the municipality paid for it. (For the record, I ought to add that under the Weimar Republic one secular, i.e. religiously unaffiliated, public elementary school was opened in Dortmund, but its reputation was less good than that of the denominational schools.) Since a very large number of the students at the Jewish school were children of immigrants who had come from Poland after World War I, prejudice against socially inferior \"Ostjuden\" (Eastern Jews) prompted many Jews to send their children to private elementary schools instead. I am proud to say that my parents did not share that prejudice and that Ernest and I were sent to the Jiidische Volksschule. Among the teachers at that school were our aunt Friedchen Strauss (who died in 1930) and Alice Schanzer, a sister of Tante Suse. Tante Suse herself also taught there before she got married, and her father-in- law, Emmanuel Goldschmidt, had taught there until his retirement. It was a good school, and its charactistic was that we had regular instruction in Jewish customs, prayers, and history, and began to learn Hebrew in second grade. As in all elementary schools, boys and girls attended the same school, but were kept in separate classes. But a boys' class might have a female teacher, and a girls' class a 41 male. Our school was located just a block from our house on the Zweite Kamp Strasse when I entered it, but it was relocated to a larger building only a little further away when I entered third grade. I might add that a lot of fuss was made about the first day of school. You were given a decorated paper funnel filled with candy, and the myth was that the funnel would be used in school to pour knowledge into your head. After school, we were taken to a professional photographer to immortalize this momentous occasion. Pictures of Ernest and myself on our first school days are in our albums. Elementary schools in Germany had eight grades, but only those who wanted to enter a trade stayed for all eight. Parents who wanted their children to have a higher education sent them to high school after four years of elementary school. Contrary to elementary schools, high schools were not denominational, except for one Catholic high school in Dortmund. Moreover, there were separate high schools for boys and girls. The choice was mainly along the line of schools with a classical curriculum (Gymnasium) and schools with an orientation toward mathematics, science and modem languages (Oberrealschule). Both types of school had eight grades, and both had very few few elective subjects. The difference was only one of emphasis: the Gymnasium also had science, mathematics, and modem languages, but these met less frequently than classes in language and literature. The Oberrealschule offered eight years of French, five years of English, and eight years of mathematics and the different sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, geography). The Gymnasium required eight years of Latin, six years of French, and five years of Greek, mathematics, and sciences. In addition, there were two optional years of Hebrew and three optional years of English. World history was required in both kinds of school as was music, drawing, and physical education. There was no Gymnasium for girls; all girls' schools were of the Oberrealschule type. On our father's insistence, who had himself gone to a Gymnasium, Ernest and I entered the Municipal Gymnasium (Stadtisches Gymnasium) in 1932 and 1933 respectively. It was the second oldest Gymnasium in Westphalia, founded in 1543. In 1934 its name was changed to Hitler Gymnasium, when Hitler was made an honorary citizen of Dortmund. Despite that infamous name, it was the last high 42 school in Dortmund to close its door to Jews. That was on November 10, 1938. It is now again called Stadtisches Gymnasium. I last visited it in November 2001, when I was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Dortmund. A photo of me in front of a bronze plaque near the entrance of the school commemorating the Jewish students who had been expelled from the school in 1938 is in my files. III. CHILDHOOD: 1933-38 1.
