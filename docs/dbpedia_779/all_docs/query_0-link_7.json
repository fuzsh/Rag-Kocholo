She was a native of Germany, but for twenty years a resident of the United States, most of the time of Columbus. [Place of interment unknown]\n\nWeimar Mercury, November 4, 1893\n\nFaber, Damon Charles\n\nFuneral Services For Damon Faber To Be Tomorrow\n\nDamon Charles Faber, 32, of Pasadena, son of Mrs. Annie Faber, died in a Pasadena hospital at 1:30 a. m. Thurday. He was born in Eagle Lake May 2, 1910 and had been in the employ of the Champion Paper and Fibre Company of Pasadena as a chemical engineer for the past five years.\n\nThe remains were brought to Eagle Lake and services will be held at 3 p.m. Saturday from the Presbyterian Church. Interment will be made in Lakeside Cemetery. Sincere sorrow is expressed by many friends here over the passing of Mr. Faber.\n\nEagle Lake Headlight, June 26, 1942\n\nFaber, Ernst August William Frederick\n\nErnst Faber, Citizen Of Eagle Lake for Nearly Fifty Years Buried At Lakeside Yesterday\n\nBorn In Germany And Came To America At Age Of Seven Years Settling At Columbus, Coming Here In Young Manhood\n\nMr. Ernst August Faber, 71 years of age, an old citizen of Eagle Lake, passed away at his home in this city shortly after noon Wednesday, following a long illness.\n\nMr. Faber was born in Luxenwald, Germany, on November 9th, seventy-one years ago, and with his family came to Texas when he was seven years of age, the family settling at Columbus when Alleyton was the western terminal of the Southern Pacific railroad. His parents died in his early youth, and he is the last of the original Faber family that came over from Germany. His two brothers, Herman and George, and two sisters, Betty, who became Mrs. Obenhaus and Mary, who became Mrs. Nicholis, both having married at Columbus, preceded him in death.\n\nMr. Faber came to Eagle Lake from Columbus when he was a young man, having for some time worked as a clerk in the general store of J. W. McCarty, at the same time that O. S. Gibson, who recently passed away at Houston, was connected with the same business. Later he went with the old-time Eagle Lake firm of Vineyard & Walker as a clerk, and for some time remained with the Frank Stephens Company when that firm took over the Vineyard & Walker business. Later, and for many years, he was connected with the store at Eldridge, which was under the firm name of Faber Mercantile Company, and in later years conducted the mercantile store of H. Matthews & Vogelsang at Matthews until the death of Mr. Matthews some four years ago when the business was discontinued.\n\nMr. Faber was married in Eagle Lake to Miss Annie Perkins, who with two daughters and two sons, B. H. Faber of Liberty; Misses Beatrice and Ernest, and Damon Faber survive him. Damon, the youngest son, is a student at the A. & M. College.\n\nMr. Faber was a quiet, pleasant and useful citizen and up to a few years ago, when his health failed, was an active man for his age. He had been confined to his home with illness for a number of months. He enjoyed the friendship, confidence and esteem of all who knew him, and at no time during his long life among us have we ever heard a word of him ill spoken.\n\nFuneral services were conducted at the home at 4 oclock Thursday afternoon, Rev. N. G. Ozment, the local Methodist pastor conducting the services. Interment was made in the Lakeside Cemetery.\n\nActive pallbearers were G. W. Keith, S.O. Boothe, Ben Ahlers, Dr. P. T. Gordon, Dr. Otto Rogers and J. E. Truitt.\n\nHonorary pallbearers named were Hayes Stephens, B. L. Vineyard, S. O. McCarty, G. B. Skelton, Bruce McCarty, M. O. Calvert, Dr. L. C. Wozencraft, Geo. H. Heck, W. W. Little, A. L. Wahrmund, Judge W. S. Strickland, Vic Engelhard, and W. Y. Westmoreland of this city; O. A. Zumwalt, S. K. Seymour, Dr., and S. A. Harbert of Columbus; John H. Brooks of Weimar and Chas. Davis, formerly of Eldridge, who is now making his home at Corpus Christi.\n\nEagle Lake Headlight, April 15, 1933\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nPhoto courtesy Ernest Mae Seaholm\n\nFaber, George\n\nThe killing of Mr. Geo. Faber at Waelder on Monday morning lastparticulars of which are published elsewherewas sadly and sorrowfully received. George was a young man with many generous and noble traits of character, and universally esteemed by those knowing him best. HIs remains were yesterday laid to rest in the presence of quite a number of our citizens in the City Cemetery, Rev. H. C. Howard officiating. Our sincere condolence is offered his bereaved relatives.\n\nColorado Citizen, June 28, 1883, page 3\n\nFatal Accident at Waelder\n\nThe Killing of Mr. Geo. Faber, of this placeCarelessness of a Negro BrakemanParticulars of Accident\n\n(Special Correspondence of the CITIZEN.)\n\nWaelder, Texas, June 26.\n\nEditor Citizen:\n\nA serious and sad accident occurred this morning at this station, causing the wreck of a freight train and locomotive of passenger train, and sudden death of a fireman. Some time before the west-bound passenger or mixed train (due at this station at 3:45) was due, a freight train containing a number of flat-cars, going east, pulled into the station and backed on the side track to wait for the mixed passenger to pass. Soon after this train backed in, a special going east went by, and the negro brakesman who held the switch key, thinking, probably, that this was the train his freight was waiting for, went back to the switch stand to open the switch for his train to pass out on the main track. It is supposed that he opened the switch, and as his train did not come out, he went to sleep, leaving the switch open, so that when the passenger train approached the station, instead of following the main track, it entered the sidetrack, too late for the engineer to discover and avert the danger. Geo. Faber, (fireman of the freight,) while his train was lying on the side-track waiting for the passenger to pass, went back of his engine and lay down to sleep on one of the flat-cars. After the collision, he was found dead on the flat, with another flat on top of him. It is probable that after going to sleep on the flat, he never woke again. He was but slightly disfiguredsome bruises about the head and side. The jury are now holding an inquest on the body.\n\nColorado Citizen, June 28, 1883, page 2\n\nFahrenthold\n\n(Browse all obits with Fahrenthold surname)\n\nFalardeau.

A. W. Didner officiated and burial was in Lakeside cemetery of Eagle Lake.\n\nIt was the custom of the Burdas to take Miss Falardeau to church in Eagle Lake each Sunday morning. They went by for her Sunday but could not find her, so after church they investigated and found her body.\n\nMiss Falardeau came to Rock Island from San Antonio 20 years ago. She was originally from Michigan. A niece, the late Mrs. Paul Lowe, once lived in Rock Island, but whereabouts of most of her relatives is unknown.

(Little)\n\nDeath of an Estimable lady\n\nThursday of last week the spirit of life left its tenement of clay and joined the innumerable throng of loved ones gone on before. Thus passed Mrs. C. R. Falwell, one of this city's most estimable and beloved ladies, one who had spent practically a lifetime among our people, and who was known far and wide for her many estimable traits of character. The funeral took place Friday afternoon in the presence of a large throng of mourning relatives and friends, Rev. J. C. Wilson, Methodist pastor and, officiating.\n\nActive pallbearers at Mrs. Falwell's funeral were M. H. Fulford, W. P. Ammann, Charles Ammann, H. Brasher Jr., Felix Melor and G. W. Shaver. Honorary pallbearers were as follows: J. J. Armstrong Sr., W. P. Watson, W. W. Williams, T. A. Hill, P. J. Shaver, W. S. Shaver, F. W. Koltermann and Will F. Miller of Houston.\n\nMrs. Falwell, nee Little, was born near Nashville, Tenn., May 16, 1836, and was slightly over 88 years old at the time of her death. Few indeed of us will ever live to attain such a ripe old age! She came to Texas in 1858, when our state was a comparative wilderness, and endured all the hardships and privations incident to early life in our state. Practically all her life from that time on was spent in Colorado County. The family lived on a farm in the Clear Creek section for many years, and here this good woman raised a family of good boys and girls, who were ever a comfort and pleasure to her. At the time of here death, she had been a widow for 42 years.\n\nMrs. Falwell leaves two sons, Jack and Tom, and two daughters, Mrs. Wm. Jordan of Wilmar, Ark., and Mrs. Jno. Armstrong Jr., of this city. She also has four brothers living. She joined the church at the age of 15, and for 73 years had lived a consistent, Christian life. At all times she was cheerful, neighborly, self-reliant, religious, and ready to go and meet her loved ones gone on before, whenever the Master called her. Mrs. Falwell was truly a good woman in every sense of the term.\n\nHer death is deeply and sincerely deplored. Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to her bereaved ones.\n\nThe Weimar Mercury, July 18, 1924\n\nTranscribed by Dennis Boatright\n\nFalwell, John\n\nWeimar Local Matters\n\nOur neighbor, John Falwell, who was reported sick in last Items, quietly passed away last Saturday evening, and was laid away in the Odd Fellows Rest, Sunday at 3 oclock, :P M., there to await the last summons. Mr. F. was a consistent member of the M. E. Church. He leaves a sorrowing wife and a large family of children to mourn his loss. May the grace of God sustain the widow and orphans in the hour of sorrow and bereavement.\n\nColorado Citizen, March 1, 1883\n\nFalwell, John E.\n\nThis community was again shadowed in gloom this week over the death of Mr. John E. Falwell, which sad event occurred Monday afternoon at 2:25 oclock. Mr. Falwell was taken sick some eight weeks ago with typhoid pneumonia, and all was done that medical science and attention could do, but to no avail. It was the call of the Master, and he expressed a perfect willingness to go. He was in his 28th year--a young man whose qualities of heart and mind had endeared him to his many friends, and by whom he will be sadly missed. He was buried in the family lot at the Odd Fellows cemetery Tuesday afternoon, under the auspices of Weimar lodge No 201, I.O.O.F., and the Weimar fire department, of which organization he was a member. A large number of relatives and friends of the deceased followed the remains to their last resting place. Our deepest sympathy is extended the bereaved mother, sisters, brothers and other relatives.\n\nWeimar Mercury, December 21, 1889\n\nFaner, unknown\n\nKILLING AT BERNARD STATION.--In a difficulty at Bernard station last Friday between Todd Fitzgerald and ______Faner, brothers-in-law, the latter was killed, and the former seriously, though not dangerously wounded.

Fanning of Clodin, Fort Bend county, Texas, died at the home of Mr. Mack Garrett near Osage at 3:30 o'clock Wednesday morning, August 3, of that dreaded disease, consumption. He had been a sufferer for several months, and was traveling overland in the hopes of being benefited. He left a wife and mother, two sisters and three brothers to mourn his untimely death. He was 26 years, 7 months and 19 days old at the time of his death. The interment took place at Osage cemetery at 5 o'clock Wednesday afternoon. The Mercury's sincere sympathy is extended the bereaved family.\n\nWeimar Mercury, August 5. 1898\n\nFrom files of Dorothy Albrecht\n\nFarek, LaVerne (Guthmann)\n\nFarek\n\nLaVene Farek, 82, of Columbus, devoted wife, mother, grandmother and aunt passed into the loving arms of our Lord, on January 30. She left this world as peacefully as she entered after a beautiful life of motherhood, service, and profound friendship to every person with whom she came in contact.

We grieve for our loss but we are comforted by our belief that she is resting in eternal peace.\n\nHer life began on June 29, 1924 in New Ulm, the daughter of Emil and Valerie Wavra Guthmann.

She had a knack for gardening, and was a member of the Garden Club where she was recently made an honorium member. She also was a life member of the Ladies Auxiliary to the V.F.W., and until the last few years she participated in their fund raising activities. She was a member of the Magnolia Homes Tour, serving as a docent. She always enjoyed a good game of cards or dominoes.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, and daughter, Phyllis, who was killed tragically on March 11, 1972.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 56 years, Ben Farek. Also, her daughters, Judy Quick and husband Jonathan of Huntington Beach, California, and Kathy Gabel and husband Frank of Cincinnati, Ohio. She has two granddaughters, Elyse and Natalie Gabel. She is also survived by her sister, Elvira Orsak of Pearland, and brothers Henry Guthmann of New Ulm, and Frank Lesikar of Columbus.\n\nFuneral services were held Saturday, February 3, 2007 at Henneke Funeral Home with Father Dan Kahlich and Deacon Bennie Holesovsky officiating. Interment followed at St. Anthony's Catholic Cemetery in Columbus.\n\nPallbearers were Gary Guthmann, Elton Lesikar, Dale Orsak, Roland Gassmann, Vic Hyek, Ed Krenek, Thomas Wostarek, and Joey Barten. Manual Schneider served as honorary pallbearer.\n\nThe family would like to extend a heartfelt thank you for the loving care she received from Delores Horndt, Bernice Kollaja, Dorothy Poncik and Eunice Bratcher.\n\nThere will be a void in each of us who knew and loved LaVene.

Box 271561, Houston, Texas 77277.\n\nColorado County Citizen, February 7, 2007\n\nCourtesy The Citizen\n\nFarek, Phyllis Ann\n\nColumbus Girl Killed in Crash\n\nPhyllis Farek, 16, a Columbus High School sophomore, was killed and Janet Koehl, 16, a classmate was critically injured early Saturday in a traffic accident south of Weimar.\n\nThe post-midnight tragedy, the second of a similar nature to strike Columbus in less than 45 days, occurred on F.M.155 about 4.5 miles south of Weimar following a dance at New Bielau.\n\nThe highway patrol said the 2 girls were struck by a car driven by Ruben Lewis Hoehne, son of the chief of police at La Grange.\n\nHoehne had driven up on another accident that had occurred a few minutes earlier involving 4 vehicles in a chain-reaction stop.\n\nWere Passengers\n\nMiss Farek, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Benny Farek, and Miss Koehl, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Koehl of Alleyton, were passengers in one of the cars involved in the earlier collision.\n\nThere were conflicting stories even among the witnesses who were there, about what happened, and the highway patrol said its investigation of the tragedy is continuing.\n\nAccording to one witness, the accident scene \"looked like an automobile junk-yard with a lot of people standing around.\"\n\n\"It was a great big mess,\" said another.\n\nAs near as can be determined by the highway patrol here is what happened.\n\nA car driven by J. B. Rogers, 17 of New Ulm, either slowed down or stopped because of a car in front of him causing a chain-reaction smashup involving 4 cars proceeding north behind him.\n\nThe other cars were driven by R. L. Menke, 16, of Cat Spring; Chester Brian Naumann, 18, of Columbus, and Julius Edward Bartek, 24, of Weimar.\n\nGo Off Road\n\nThe vehicles driven by Rogers and Naumann went off the road into a ditch on the right, and the vehicle driven by Bartek went off the road into a ditch on the left. The vehicle driven by Menke remained on the highway.\n\nThe drivers and their 8 passengers got out to survey the wreckage. A few minutes later Hoehne's car drove up on the accident, striking the 2 Columbus girls who were standing on the highway.\n\nHoehne, the highway patrol said, did not see the wreckage or the people until it was too late to stop. His car left skid marks, but the vehicle itself, its front splattered with blood, never left the roadway.\n\nLights Knocked Out\n\nHighway Patrolman Alton Adcock said the rear lights on the vehicles in the first crash had been knocked out in the chain-reaction stop. He said the only light on the highway was a flashlight one of the passengers was using to signal oncoming traffic.\n\nHighway Patrol Sgt. Gilbert Kiel said no major traffic charges are contemplated, although some minor traffic citations may be issued in connection with the first crash.\n\nThe highway patrol said 3 pedestrians were struck by the Hoehne car; Miss Farek, Miss Koehl and Clarence Noska 16, of Columbus. Noska suffered minor bruises and abrasions.\n\nFour Passengers\n\nMiss Farek and Miss Koehl, along with Renee Duncan, 16, and Cindy Calhoun, 16 both of Columbus were passengers in Naumann's car.\n\nNoska and Howard Hayek, 16, of Columbus were riding with Rogers. John David Brown, 19 of Columbus was a passenger in Menke's car, and Bartek apparently was alone in his vehicle.\n\nRiding with Hoehne were Donna Halek, 16, Debbie Knebel, 17 and Larry Ulbrich, 19 all of Weimar.\n\nThe highway patrol said all of the youths had been to a dance at New Bielau and were returning home after the dance had ended.\n\nRegular Patrol\n\nKiel said the highway patrol has one patrol car assigned to the road on dance nights, but the car happened to be at the other end of the highway when the first accident happened.\n\nA passerby reported the first accident to Adcock and his partner, Ray Scholton, the investigating officer. The second accident happened while the 2 patrolmen were enroute to the scene.\n\nMiss Farek died at the scene. Miss Koehl was picked up by a Henneke Funeral Home ambulance and later hospitalized at Methodist Hospital in Houston where her condition at noon Wednesday was reported by the hospital authorities as critical.\n\nThe fatal accident rocked Columbus, coming only 45 days after a similar tragedy Jan. 31 that took the lives of Johnny Rutta 17, and his sister, Linda, 16, in a2-car crash 4 miles south of Columbus on S.H. 71.\n\nFive County Fatalities\n\nThe latest fatality is the fifth in Colorado County this year, 3 of them involving Columbus High School students.\n\nFuneral services for Miss Farek were held at St. Anthony's Catholic Church at 9:30 a.m. Monday, with Father Patrick Palmer officiating. Interment was in St Anthony's Catholic Cemetery. A Christian Wake was at 7 p.m. Sunday at Henneke Funeral Home.\n\nMiss Farek was a member of the Columbus High School band, the Spanish Club, the Young Americans, Future Teachers of America, and the stage band. She was reporter for the sophomore class and taught a religion class at St. Anthony's Catholic Church.\n\nSurvivors include her parents; 2 sisters, Judy Kristynik of Huntsville and Kathy Farek of Columbus.\n\nPallbearers were Mark Jensen, John Seymour, Tom Rau, Gregory Mikeska, Clayton Adams and Chester Naumann.\n\nColorado County Citizen, March 16, 1972\n\nTranscribed by Judy Talkington\n\nFarley, Louisa C.\n\nMrs. Farley, mother of the late lamented Frank Farley who was downed last May in Lavaca county, and of Mrs. John Mullen of Oakland, died at the home of her daughter Thursday morning at 2 oclock, and was buried in the Weimar cemetery yesterday at 10 oclock. Mrs. Farley was in her 84 year and during her latter days was a great sufferer, being confined to her bed over ten years.\n\nWeimar Mercury, August 30, 1902\n\nFarmer, Jesse P.\n\nOur town and our community was saddened when the news spread on last Monday afternoon that Jesse Farmer was dead. His death was due to pneumonia following an attack of influenza. He was only ill about ten days.\n\nJesse, as he was familiarly known to all of his friends, was one of the best men we have ever known. He was so good natured, so jolly and always of such a happy frame of mind that he won for himself a wide circle of friends.\n\nJesse P. Farmer was born in Columbus, Texas, August 2nd, 1876 and was married to Miss Bettie Lowrey Sept. 3rd, 1905[1900]. Two children; Jessie and Lyle blessing the union.\n\nHe was a valuable employee of the Southern Pacific railroad and has made his home in Glidden for the past sixteen years. He was a good citizen, a most faithful husband and father, was honest, upright and respected by all.\n\nHe leaves a wife, two children, three sisters, two brothers and a host of friends to mourn his loss.\n\nTo those to whom his life was devoted it is hard to say a word of comfort yet a star of hope illuminates the night of their sorrow for he was a good chiristian and died happy in the security of his love and salvation The same thought that brightened his dying hours, thought that every night of death is followed by a morning of resurrection, is the comfort of those left behind.\n\nThe blessed doctrine of the resurrection throws a halo over every Christians headstone and makes each grave an open gate leading into glory, for after all Death is but a path that must be trod, If man would ever pass to God.\n\nHis remains were committed to earth in the Odd Fellows Rest Tuesday afternoon under the auspices of the Masonic Lodge.\n\nRev, Stack of Weimar and Rev.

LENA FARMER\n\nIt was a great shock to the many fiends of the family when news was received in Columbus last Sunday that Mrs. Farmer was dead. Mrs. Farmer was born in Columbus and had lived here all of her life, but for the past six or eight months had been visiting her children in Houston and Palacios, and at the time of her death was at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Tom Brandon, at Palacios. She had not been in the best of health for some months, but was not confined to her bed, and apparently was feeling very well last Sunday but shortly after eating dinner she started across the room and fell, and in a few moments was dead,\n\nThe body was brought to Columbus Tuesday for burial and was accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Tom Brandon of Palacios, Mr. and Ms. Henry Farmer, and Miss Myrtle Farmer of Houston, also a number of other relatives and friends.\n\nServices were held at the family home Tuesday afternoon at 4:30, and interment was in the City cemetery, Rev. C. P. P.[sic] Morgan officiating.\n\nColorado Citizen, March 14, 1919, page 1\n\nMEMORIAL\n\nOur hearts were grieved when the message came that Mrs. Lena Farmer had died suddenly in Palacios at the home of her daughter, Mrs. Tom Brandon. Mrs. Farmer had lived all her life in Columbus, and her friends were numbered by her acquaintances.\n\nMiss Lena Boediker[sic] was born in Columbus, Sept. 15th., 1863, and died in Palacios march[sic] 9th, 1919. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Boediker. Her mother died when Mrs. Farmer was a child. Her father died after her marriage. He was for many years a trusted and faithful Treasurer of Colorado County. She was married to Robert Edward Farmer, a lawyer and a native of Columbus, who died several years ago. One son and two daughters came to bless this union. Mrs. Farmer was naturally endowed with a cheerful and lovable disposition, and seemed happiest when making others happy around her. Loving and tender in friendship, she was always ready with words of comfort and encouragement, where needed. She was of a retiring nature, and her true worth was most appreciated by those who knew her well in her home. She gave her heart to God and united with the Methodist Church, and was a loved and devoted member of that church when she died. We shall miss her sweet face and form in her accustomed place in church.\n\nHer christian life will be to her children a sweet legacy, like a star of hope ever pointing them to the haven of rest, and her influence will remain as a sweet perfume to bless and encourage them. She leaves three children, Mrs. Tom Brandon of Palacios, Henry and Myrtle Farmer of Houston, one grand-son, Tom Brandon, Jr. and one brother, Charles Boediker of Houston, besides other relatives and friends whose sympathy and tears are mingled with her loved ones in their grief.\n\nShe was buried in Columbus in the City Cemetery, Tuesday, March 11, 1919. The remains was accompanied to Columbus by her children, brother and grand-son, and other friends. The large gathering of friends at her home and at the cemetery, the flower covered mound told of love for her. We shall meet her when the night is past, and day dawns in the land of God. The services were conducted by Rev. C. P. Morgan of the Methodist church.\n\nThe pall bearers were Messrs. Albert Hahn, Alex McCormick, Chriss Grobe, C. K.

She had an attack of la grippe, from which she recovered, but unfortunately relapsed, and tenderest care and best medical aid failed to relieve her. Mrs. Farmer was born in Wilson, Edgecombe county, N. C., Feb 5, 1836; was married to Mr. Pharoah Farmer in 1854; immigrated to Texas in 1857, and has resided in Columbus over 40 years. She was not a member of any church, but her pronounced Christian principles and life of close adherence to religious works, her moral precept and example were well known and admired by her intimate friends. She was the mother of fourteen children, seven of whom -- Mrs. Sallie A. Cousins, Mrs. Indella Wilson, Miss Lula, Messrs. Robert E., George L., Thomas S. and Jesse P. Farmer -- survive her, and mourn her irreparable loss. Her remains were interred in the city cemetery yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, in the presence of many sorrowing friends.

He had struggled for a number of years with myelodysplasia and all of the extended ramifications of this blood disorder. He was a tough, determined character who dealt with this challenge head on, determined to squeeze every good moment of life possible out of his remaining years – enjoying every precious moment with his family and friends.\n\nSeveral puzzling years of illness preceded the myelodysplasia diagnosis shortly after Bill’s 75th birthday and he was told there was no cure. He liked to say that his “new car warranty” expired when he reached 75. Typical of Bill, he accepted the restrictions put on his remaining years with grace, never any self-pity or complaint. He was always grateful for the added days that allowed him to be part of grandchildren’s weddings, great grandchildren’s births and birthdays….and the birth of his last grandson, the only one to carry the Farris name into the future.\n\nA fifth generation Texan, Bill was proud of his ancestor’s contribution in winning Texas independence and settlement of the area of present-day Montgomery, Grimes, Madison and Walker Counties. He was born 21 March 1928, in the family home 10 miles southwest of Huntsville in Walker Co., the eldest child of Emmett Lester Farris and Emmie Edna Leonard Farris. His parents were 5th cousins, both descended from 17th century immigrants along the James River of Virginia, later they were early settlers of middle Tennessee before permanent settlement in Texas in the 1830’s.\n\nBill met and courted his future wife while on a ten day furlough before deploying with the Signal Corps of the 40th Infantry Division for Japan and Korea in 1951. It was a wartime, whirlwind courtship with both committing to each other before his departure. Upon his return following 18 months overseas in the Korean War, he immediately married Helyn Lorena Hobbs in the wedding chapel of Riverside Methodist Church, Houston, TX. 24 November 1952. They have been lovers, best friends, business partners, and constant companions ever since. Bill’s long life allowed them to celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary at their home surrounded by their family 24 November 2012.\n\nThe love and joy of his family was at the core of Bill’s life. The children born to his marriage and today all survive him are Candyce Dawn Farris Dixon and husband, Dale, of Huntsville, TX; Melody Leigh Farris Grigar and husband, Michael, of Eagle Lake; William Richard “Rich” Farris of Plano, TX. Grandchildren: Alyssa Dixon Crockett and husband, Paul, of Houston; William Dale Dixon and wife, Melissa of Houston; Lucas Dixon of Los Angeles, CA; Lance Grigar and wife, Carrie of Fulshear, TX; Lori Grigar Chapman and husband, Will of Fulshear, TX; Nicole Farris and Dylan Farris of Plano, TX. Also five great grandchildren: Laila and Caine Chapman, Gunner and Halleigh Grigar, and Brayden Dixon.\n\nOther survivors are a brother, Harold Farris and wife, Nancy, of Victoria; sisters, Mrs. Robert H. (Doris) Turner and Mrs. Delbert (Della) Robinson; and brother-in-law James L. “Red” Wells, all of Huntsville. Also surviving him are many cousins, nieces and nephews. Preceding Bill in death were his parents; a brother, Carl Gaylord Farris; and a sister, Anna Merle Farris Wells.\n\nA long life allowed two lengthy careers. Bill retired from A.T. &T after 30 years service. At the end of his telephone career he was supervisor of the central offices of Columbus, Eagle Lake, Sealy, Hempstead, Prairie View, and Waller. This was followed by a 20 year career as owner of The Farris 1912, the local hotel that he and Helyn restored and operated as a widely known hunting lodge and hospitality facility.\n\nBill Farris left his legacy on many local organizations. He was a past president of Rotary, Chamber of Commerce, Little League, and United Way. He also was County Chairman of the American Red Cross and served on the Eagle Lake city council. He served as president of the Eagle Lake I.S.D. school board as well as Rice Consolidated I.S. D. board. He gave a total of 10 years to the betterment of education for the children of southern Colorado County. He and Helyn were instrumental in the organization of Texas Historic Hotels and Inns Association in the 1980’s.\n\nThe three things that Bill cited as the great satisfactions in his life were his family, the role he played in the creation of Rice Consolidated School District, and service for his country as a platoon sergeant in Korea where he served in the 40th Infantry Division’s Signal Corps in communications at Command Headquarters.\n\nAt Bill’s request no funeral or memorial service was scheduled. His cremains will remain with his family until they are interred in the future with Helyn’s at the base of a red, Indian granite monument in the Farris Cemetery in Huntsville that he gave serious thought in designing and wording. The monument is inscribed “From Eternity to Eternity, in Between the Sweet Grass Grows,” a line that conveys the personal philosophy he lived by. He was an avid student of the western settlement of America. He had read all of Louis Lamour’s 250 plus books, all of Elmer Kelton’s books and those of Larry McMurtry. His all time favorite was McMurtry’s Lonesome Dove.\n\nThe family of William Leon “Bill” Farris wishes to express their gratitude for the care and devotion given to him through these years by Dr. Russell Thomas and the staff of Rice Medical Center. Those wishing to make memorial contributions are asked to consider the following: Rice Medical Center Employee Volunteers, Prairie Edge Museum, Wintermann Library, all in Eagle Lake, TX; Farris Cemetery Association, P.O. Box 343, Huntsville, TX 77342; or the church or charity of your choice.\n\nA celebration and commemoration of the life of William Leon Farris will be held at a later date by family and friends at the Farris home.\n\nColorado County Citizen, January 9, 2013\n\nContributed by Helyn Farris\n\nFarrow, Jimmie Earl\n\nJimmie Earl Farrow\n\nJimmie Earl Farrow, 68, passed away April 2.\n\nHe was born September 14, 1941 in Columbus to Cora Farrow and Jim Farrow.\n\nHe received his education from the Columbus public schools, worked for Coca-Cola for 22 years, McCoy’s for 19 years and HEB for five years.\n\nHe married Bobbie Farrow and was a member of Antioch Baptist Church.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his daughter, Debbie Sampson; one brother, Archie Clayborne; two sisters, Betty Collins and Evelyn Shine; three uncles, Howard Booker, James “Bo” Johnson and Willie Glenn, Sr.; and two aunts, Josey Carter and Minnie Banks.\n\nHe is survived by two sons, Eddie and Henry; three sisters, Jessie Johnson (James) of Houston, Roslyn Phlegm (Tommie) of Tomball and Margaret Sampson (the Rev.

She supported her two daughters in everything that they did and even if she wasn't able to make a specific function, due to work, they knew she loved them and could be there if the situation was different. She worked constantly and even if you happened to catch her complaining, she still got up and went to work.\n\nShe was diagnosed with breast cancer in the spring of 2001. She began treatment and went into remission for about six months. Her doctor then discovered that the cancer had metastasized to bone cancer; for which she went on treatment immediately.

She went on radiation for that right away.\n\nUnfortunately the treatments were not enough and the cancer continued to win the battle over her body.

FANNIE FERRELL SUDDENLY SUCCUMBS EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.\n\nThe people of this community were greatly shocked Sunday morning when the news was flashed over the city that Mrs. Fannie Ferrell had suddenly passed away. Mrs. Ferrell had not been in robust health for a number of years, but no one had an inkling that Death hovered so near. She was noted at church during the recent Methodist revival and while in rather feeble condition, no one realized that the end for her was so near at hand. The end came peacefully and with scarcely a struggle. Sunday School at the Methodist Church had just been started, but upon announcement that Mrs. Ferrell was dead, it was adjourned and many of the attendants went over to extend condolence and offer their services. The body was prepared for burial and Monday afternoon was laid to rest in the Odd Fellows Cemetery in the presence of a large gathering of mourning relatives and friends of this most estimable lady. Rev. J. C. Wilson, Methodist pastor, performed the burial service.\n\nMrs. Ferrell was born May 23, 1849, at Macon, Baker county, Georgia. She came to Texas at the age of 3 years, settling with her parents a short distance south of Weimar and lived there and in this city continuously up to the time of her death. She joined the Methodist Church at an early age and lived a consistent, christian life ever afterward. She was a daughter of the late Elizabeth and John Tooke and was married to J H Ferrell Oct. 22, 1869. Two children survive--Mrs. H. Brasher, Sr., and Miss Kate Ferrell, both of this city also four grandchildren, and seven sisters, namely: Mrs. Bettie Kindred of Columbus, Mrs. L. D. Herndon of Houston, Mrs. M. A. Tooke of Lockhart, Mr. G. G. Nolen and Mrs. Smma[sp] Stockton of Louise, Mrs. Nannie Rhodes and Miss Callie Tooke of Fort Worth.\n\nMrs. Ferrell was a most estimable, popular lady, one who endeared herself to all by her gentle disposition and interest in the welfare of all those with whom she came in contact. She took great interest in church work, and up to the time when her health failed was an active worker in the Masters cause. She was a devoted mother, and greatly beloved by neighbors and friends wherever known.

In her death Weimar looses a good citizen, relatives and friend, a loved and faithful companion. She was an estimable lady, possessed of a legion of friends wherever known, and her death has caused many hearts to be bowed down with sorrow. Mrs. Fietsam was born March 28, 1831, in Elz, Dukedom of Nassau, Germany; was a daughter of P. Laux; emigrated to Texas in the fall of 1845; and she and her husband have lived in Weimar for many years. Her death was caused from catarrh of the stomach, aggravated by an attack of dengue fever.

Louis Blinka. [Interment in Weimar Odd Fellows Cemtery]\n\nMiss Fietsam was a native of Bluff, near La Grange, and moved to Weimar, along with her parents in 1887. Widely known throughout this section, she was an early employe of the Weimar post office and for many years was a part-owner and employe of one of Weimar’s drug stores. She made her home here with her sister, Mrs. Bertha Tell, at whose residence she expired.\n\nAn additional survivor is another sister, Mrs. Mary Hilden of Shiner. There are also a number of nephews and nieces.\n\nPall bearers were six nephews, Joe and Roy Fietsam, Oscar Schindler, Edgar Banse, Clarence and Arthur Munke.\n\n“Miss Emma”, as she was known to many here, had scores of friends throughout this area and in the passing of this good woman, Weimar has lost a good citizen and one who will be long remembered by those who knew her.\n\nTo sorrowing survivors, the Mercury staff extends sincere sympathy.\n\nWeimar Mercury, May 3, 1940, page 1\n\nFietsam, Henry P.\n\nWeimar Local Matters\n\nOne of the most horrible of all murders and robberies was committed between the hours of 11 and 12 o’clock on the night of Monday, August 15, 1892, and is recorded among the black deeds perpetrated at Weimar. It seems some deep-dyed villain, intent on robbery, entered the north window of Mr. H. P. Fietsam’s residence by cutting the blind and raising the latch--passed through the parlor, rifled the secretary in the bed room, then safely crept to the head of the bed where lay asleep Mr. and Mrs. Henry P. Fietsam, felt under the pillow and succeeded in removing his purse (containing currency and gold) and pistol. It is supposed that at that time Mr. Fietsam was aroused and attempted to raise his head when the dastardly villain--right in Fietsam’s own residence in his own bedroom, by the side of his own beloved wife, with his own pistol--shot and immediately killed one of the best citizens of Weimar. The ball took effect in the top of the head, blowing out his brains, and killed Mr. F. instantly. The wife was aroused by the shot and says the heartless murderer fired another shot, evidently intended for her, but missed her and buried itself in the calf of the right leg of the murdered man. The perpetrator of the terrible deed removed the money from the purse, dropped the purse on the floor near the bed, made his escape the same way he entered, dropping the pistol on the outside of the window; and also in his hurry dropped a $5 gold piece. Officers Hatch York, Joda Shiver, Sheriff Townsend and Sam Rees were soon on hand, and will do everything in their power to bring the guilty scoundrel to justice. The remains of Henry P. Fietsam were interred in the family lot in the Odd Fellows’ cemetery Tuesday evening, under the auspices of Weimar Lodge No 13, Herman Soehne, of which he was ex-president, followed by a large concourse of relatives and deeply sympathizing citizens. The CITIZEN condoles with the deeply distressed family in the untimely loss of their protector and best friend.\n\nColorado Citizen, August 18, 1892\n\nContributed by Deborah Smith\n\nON AN OLD CHARGE\n\nA dispatch from Weimar to the San Antonio Express last Saturday reads as follows:\n\n\"Henry R. Michalke, a well-to-do citizen of Weimar, was arrested here this evening by Sheriff Sam Rees and carried to the Columbus jail charged with the murder of Henry Feitsam [sic.] at this place several years ago. The murder has been wrapped in mystery. Michalke has since the murder married the widow of the murdered man. The alleged evidence is kept secret.\"\n\nBriefly told the circumstances of the killing for which Michalke stands charged are as follows: About five years ago Henry Feitsam, a saloon and hotel man and former postmaster of Weimar, was killed as he lay in bed with his wife by his side. The murderer entered the house and shot Feitsam with his own pistol--a 38-cililbre (sic) Smith and Wesson. The ball entered the back of the head and lodged in the throat. A second bullet burned Mrs. Feitsam's night dress. Her screams called in the neighbors who found where the murderer had jumped out of the window and traced him for a long distance,"
