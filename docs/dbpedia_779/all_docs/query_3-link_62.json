        "text": "Commission on Influenza\n\nDedicated with respect and grateful appreciation to Thomas Francis, Jr., founder and first commission director. He contributed so much to our understanding and control of influenza. Dr. Francis` pioneering work and wise counsel were instrumental in making possible a vaccine that played a major role in controlling influenza and preventing it from becoming a significant health hazard in the military services during World War II and thereafter.\n\nForeword\n\nThe specter of epidemic diseases, such as influenza and pneumonia, during World War II was the major stimulus that led to formation of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB) in 1940, called originally \"The Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases\" in the Army. Its success was practically ensured simply because there was great need for solution of these always threatening epidemiological scourges for the military services and the general public. Moreover, there were key and well-informed medical scientists in America who were poised and anxious to serve their country. Need and desire are impelling ingredients for success of any venture.\n\nA decision of great and lasting importance was the choice of Thomas Francis, Jr., a product of Yale, New Haven, Connecticut; the Rockefeller Institute, Princeton, New Jersey; and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to organize and direct a team effort directed toward control of influenza. Simultaneously with directing this effort, he participated as a \"sleeves rolled up\" investigator. There is an old adage that says, \"if you want to solve a difficult problem, ask a busy person to do it.\" This epitomized Francis. Impressive, in so many ways, was his insight into the solution of pressing problems sparked always by his epidemiological sense and his clinical astuteness. These attributes enabled him to help determine the proper roads to take and which routes to abandon.\n\nThe team of Commission on Influenza members that he led was the best possible group ever to be assembled, and it is to their great credit and his strong and wise guidance that the work of the Commission helped relegate influenza to the realm of effectively controlled infections. Dr. Francis` dedicated associate and friend, Fred Davenport, succeeded him as Director and Dr. Davenport, in turn, was followed by Gordon Meiklejohn, who directed activities of the Commission until its termination in 1973. Dr. Meiklejohn continues to perform surveillance evaluations that afford valuable data regarding antigenic changes through studies performed at the Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. This information has been most helpful in selecting the proper types of influenza virus to be incorporated in new vaccines from year to year.\n\nThis success story on influenza is an example of coordinated effort and cooperation between academically oriented and military scientists who collectively spearheaded a major effort aimed at the solution of a common health problem. Influenza, although not fully eradicated, is now effectively controlled when the public accepts and follows the available guideline recommendations. The military has a simple built-in mechanism for controlling influenza-military personnel all take the influenza vaccine.\n\nA very important spin-off of the accomplishments of the Commission on Influenza has been the training and development of a hard core of medical investigators and educators who have filled and now grace many important professorships in our leading educational institutions. They continue to serve the Department of Defense and Public Health Service through their wise advice in determining the character of influenza vaccines and other means of control, all of which are persistent problems requiring ceaseless evaluation.\n\nGrateful appreciation is expressed to Dr. Meiklejohn for preparing this history, which is now a document of historic and lasting importance. Ms. Patricia Graves, his devoted Research Associate, has our sincere thanks for helping re-\n\n142\n\ntrieve much valuable information from numerous files, correspondence, reports, and reprints. Colonel Robert Wells and Ms. Jean Ward aided materially in this search. Without such contributions, this history would not have been completed.\n\n-Theodore E. Woodward, M. D.\n\nHistory of the Commission on Influenza\n\nGordon N. Meiklejohn, M.D.\n\nPREFACE\n\nWhen Dr. Theodore Woodward first contacted me about writing a history of the Commission on Influenza, I was somewhat overwhelmed by the prospect. As I thought about it more, it seemed to me very important to have a record of the accomplishments of this remarkable group. I had been involved in the 1943 field trials in which the influenza A vaccine was first shown to be effective in a massive field trial and have continued to work on the control of influenza in the Armed Forces up to the present time. The only other two survivors of the early days of the Commission, Drs. Jonas Salk and Edwin Lennette, have since left the influenza field.\n\nIt seemed to me that the best source of information would be the massive annual reports of the Commission. I contacted Colonel Robert A. Wells, Executive Secretary of the AFEB. He made a major effort to find them and came up with a number of the reports, but many were missing and could not be found anywhere. He was most helpful, and the reports that were found were invaluable. He provided me with a history of the first 5 years of the Commission, which Dr. Francis had written in 1945, that covered the early years very well. There still were many gaps in the story, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s.Consequently, I turned to Dr. Hassan Maassab in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for assistance. He did not have the full Commission reports but was able to provide me with the Director`s summaries of all years from 1950 to 1970. From this source material I was able to find most of the main points of activity. The reader, however, must be aware of the fact that the Director`s Commission reports may have been somewhat biased presentations. I may have added a bias of my own in trying to pick out what was important for the mission of control of influenza in the Armed Services. To any individuals who feel their contributions were not rightly recognized, I apologize.\n\nAt the time when the Commission began its studies there was a great deal of uncertainty and fear about what influenza might do as mobilization increased. Memory of the disaster of 1918 and 1919 was bright in the minds of many of the senior Preventive Medicine Officers and in the minds of Drs. Francis, Francis Blake, and Stanhope Bayne-Jones, who had a large part in the early organization of the Commissions. This concern is reflected in the name that they gave to the original Board, namely the \"Board of the Control of Influenza and other Epidemic Diseases in the Army.\"\n\nWhen the Commission activities began in 1941, relatively little was known about influenza. Influenza B had been discovered only a couple years earlier by Dr. Francis. The agglutination of chicken red blood cells had just been described by Dr. George Hirst in New York and Drs. Ronald Hare and L. McClelland in Toronto. Before that time, the laboratory diagnosis of influenza was based on the isolation of virus in ferrets or by complement fixation tests. The latter were not widely used. Elsewhere, during the epidemic, efforts were made to use clinical criteria to make a diagnosis, and it was obvious that these effort were not satisfactory. Neutralization tests were carried out only in mice. These were expensive and required an enormous number of animals at a very considerable cost in dollars, time, and effort. The notions of epidemiology of influenza were rigid, and it was believed that influenza would reoccur every 2 years. This was a source of considerable concern because 1942 was supposed to be a year when an epidemic of influenza would occur.\n\nThe expected epidemic did not materialize, and to save time, Drs. Francis and Salk with their colleagues at the University of Michigan conducted a series of rather remarkable and daring experiments. They sprayed large amounts of wild influenza virus into the nasal passages of large numbers of\n\n144\n\n\"volunteers\" from mental institutions in Michigan. The recipients developed influenza within a very short period of time with typical symptoms and many developed â¥4 fold increases in antibody titers. Performed today, experiments of this type would be considered highly unethical. Fortunately, no one was seriously harmed by the virus challenge. In another experiment, conscientious objectors were challenged with large amounts of wild virus to determine whether an aerosol of immune serum could protect against the virus as the Russians had claimed. None of the study participants became seriously ill. Much was learned about the immunity to influenza, and it was clear that immunity was far from solid. This led the Commission to minimize its efforts to develop an attenuated live vaccine because it appeared that even infection by wild virus would not provide solid protection for much longer than 4 months. The Surgeon General of the Army at that time was especially concerned that an attenuated live virus vaccine might revert to avirulent virus of the type that caused such havoc in 1918 and 1919.\n\nIn military personnel it was accepted practice to divide troops on a random basis into vaccinated and control groups and to administer placebo injections to the controls. Field trials have never been better controlled. Once the vaccine had been declared to be effective, it was considered unethical to withhold vaccine from any member of the Armed Services. This policy was accepted by the Army in 1970.\n\nApart from the scientific contributions made by the members, associate members, and persons holding contracts supported by the Commission, something must be said about the personal qualifications and personal relationships of the members of the Commission. Dr. Francis served as Director of the Commission from its inception until 1957. He was admired and liked by all members of the Commission and his military colleagues. Dr. Davenport served as Director from 1957 to 1970. He also had extreme dedication and moved the Commission activities along very well. The morale of the group was exceptionally high, and the early members took on any assignments thought necessary by the Commission as a whole. They were a remarkable group of professionals who worked together in their common effort to solve a major health problem. It is hard at the present time to realize that the Commission members received no financial compensation apart from the small honorarium for each day of the meetings that they attended each year. This fact alone attests to their interest in and dedication to the public welfare.\n\nPreparation of this history has been a time-consuming effort, but well worth it. As references were found, I could not resist reading many of them from beginning to end. All persons interested in immunity to influenza should be familiar with these early studies.\n\nFinally, a word of appreciation must be expressed to a number of persons who were most helpful in this enterprise. Assistance provided by Colonel Wells, Executive Secretary of the AFEB, and Dr. Maassab, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, has already been mentioned, and their help is again acknowledged. I am certain that all members of the Commission recognize the assistance provided by a series of Executive Secretaries of the AFEB, and particularly by Ms. Betty L. Gilbert, the Board`s long-term secretary. Dr. Woodward has been most helpful and supportive in encouraging me to prepare this manuscript and in reviewing an earlier draft. Ms. Pat Graves has been exceptionally helpful, particularly in finding many of the earlier references and in the assistance in the whole project.\n\nYou will note that in some instances we were unable to find references in published articles and were forced to refer to the Director`s Summary of the Annual Commission reports. Anyone who wishes to pursue further details can contact me. Every attempt will be made to provide additional data.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Board for the Investigation of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases was created on 11 January 1941. During 1940 the United States had experienced a large increase in the number of recruits\n\n145\n\nintroduced into the armed services in response to the war in Europe. A number of thoughtful medical authorities in the armed services, who recalled the disastrous epidemics, particularly influenza, during and after World War I, felt a need for additional assistance in developing new methods for coping with the potential risks and problems. The solution recommended was organization of Commissions made up of civilian scientists who were active in research and were well-informed of the needs in specific areas. It was conceived that Commission members would work side by side with their military counterparts in attacking these problems. Twelve Commissions were initially envisioned. Invitations were extended to highly qualified health professionals to direct these commissions and to arrange control programs required to meet projected needs.\n\nOn 10 February 1941 Dr. Blake, President of the Board, invited Dr. Francis, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to organize and serve as director of the Commission on Influenza. The invitation was immediately and enthusiastically accepted.\n\nThe original Board was called the Board for Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases in the Army. In 1949 the name was changed to the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board.\n\nApproximately 30 highly qualified scientists with backgrounds as epidemiologists, virologists, and educators whose interests covered wide ranges of disease categories were recruited from various areas in the United States. Each was appointed as a Consultant to the Secretary of the Army. The common goal was to detect outbreaks of influenza and institute control measures.

Schooled in internal medicine, Dr. Blake ultimately chaired the Department of Medicine at Yale for 3 de cades and he simultaneously served the School of Medicine as its Dean. Francis Blake was the complete physician, an academician in the fullest sense; he was a teacher who taught by precept, a clinician accomplished in diagnosis, and a leader in curative and preventive medicine. Additionally, he was an accomplished clinical investigator and researcher in infectious diseases, particularly influenza, pneumonia, viral diseases, and the scrub typhus fevers.\n\nIt is no surprise that the original AFEB succeeded; it was blessed with the membership of accomplished clinicians and medical scientists such as J. Steven Simmons, Stanhope Bayne-Jones, and Colin MacLeod, and the presidential leadership of Francis Blake.\n\n147\n\nTHOMAS FRANCIS, JR., M.D.\n\nThomas Francis graduated from Yale University School of Medicine where he was a prot?g? of Dr. Francis Blake, who introduced him to the field of infectious diseases, particularly influenza and pneumonia. This relationship led to Dr. Francis`s being \"passed on\" to serve under Rufus I. Cole, chief of the hospital of the Rockefeller Institute in New York. At the Rockefeller Institute, Francis worked with Thomas M. Rivers, William T. Tillett, Oswald T. Avery, Homer T. Smith, Colin MacLeod, Joe Smadel, and Frank Horsfall. His interests were directed to the field of virology and, specifically, to influenza. He is credited with having been the first scientist to isolate the influenza virus in this country, in 1935. His contributions to the field of influenza research included his clarification of the antigenic shifts that characterize this complicated virus. He directed the Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, where he gained national prominence when he designed the trials for, and analyzed the results of, the Salk poliomyelitis vaccine. Jonas Salk was one of his proteges.\n\nIn 1941, Thomas Francis was chosen to be the first Director of the Commission on Influenza of the AFEB. The contributions of this Commission to the prevention and control of influenza with biological vaccines is a remarkable achievement in American medicine. He was proud that his associate, Dr. Fred Davenport, succeeded him as Director of the Commission on Influenza. From 1958 to 1960, Dr. Francis was President of the AFEB.\n\n148\n\nORIGINAL AFEB, 1942\n\nThe original members of the Board for the Investigation and Control of Influenza and Other Epidemic Diseases 12-13 May 1942\n\nFront row, left to right: Dr. Oswald F.

The composition of this group was reduced to a more efficient size in 1943 when the Commission on Influenza consisted of the following members:\n\nMonroe D. Eaton, M.D.\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n\nBerkley, California\n\nWilliam M. Hale, M.D.\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nIowa City, Iowa\n\nGeorge K.

Throughout this period, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to provide personnel support to a number of Commissions.\n\nAn outline of the plan presented to the Board on 27 and 28 February 1941 was as follows.\n\n150\n\nOutline for Plan of Commission on Influenza-\n\nPresented to the AFEB on 27 and 28 February 1941\n\nI.

Pathological\n\na. To correlate the picture in fatal cases with etiologic studies.\n\nb. To search for diagnostic criteria when illness was not caused by known virus.\n\n6. Cooperative studies with other Commissions, especially in the fields of complications and chemotherapeutics.\n\nThe proposed program for the Commission on influenza was developed and discussed with the Board along with a proposed budget estimate in the middle of April 1941. The organizational plan provided for geographic coverage of all parts of the country. The Commission planned to function during a specific outbreak by utilizing the laboratories of the State of New York and the Rockefeller Institute to cover epidemics in the first, second, third, and fourth Army areas. The Midwestern group, centered at the University of Chicago, would serve the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth Army areas. The ninth corps in the western states would be covered by the laboratory in the California Department of Health at Berkeley, California.\n\nAmong the goals recommended were (a) to study the protective efficacy of vaccines; (b) to investigate air sterilization by aerosols; (c) to study the effectiveness of masks to control infection; and (d) to collect data on the clinical, pathological, and bacteriological aspects of the investigation. In addition, during field studies, epidemiological data would be collected on the character and dissemination of the illnesses, the type of influenza virus involved, pathological studies on fatal cases, and evaluation of various forms of treatment.\n\n151\n\nA series of recommendations was made to provide for one mobile laboratory in each of the geographic divisions and to integrate studies with those of other Commissions, such as the Commissions on Pneumonia, Streptococcal Diseases, and Epidemiological Survey. It was also proposed that a trial mobilization be organized as soon as possible to test the mechanisms by which the Commission might function in the event of an epidemic. It was considered essential that the investigative units work at the site of the outbreak in collaboration with the appropriate medical armed forces personnel.\n\nThe original proposal called for a total budget of $53,200 for each of the three units, for a total of $159,600 to be utilized as follows:\n\nIt is significant to mention that salaries of most of the investigators were derived from their own institution or were through funds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation; it was assumed that individual investigators would receive supplemental compensation only during their assigned duties in the field.\n\nThe original proposal was consequently revised and reduced. The Rockefeller Foundation provided, without cost, the facilities of their laboratories in New York and California and offered the Medical Department of the Army the use of their laboratory services and the opportunity to obtain and store materials for the Commissions purposes. Arrangements were made for the close scrutiny of weekly surveillance reports for possible outbreaks of influenza by the members of the Commission of Acute Respiratory Diseases. Authorization was given for (a) experimental trial of an influenza vaccine should the vaccine of promise be available and a suitable opportunity arise; (b) studies of the efficacy of respiratory masks; (c) laboratory studies of materials and samples collected in the field bearing on the etiology, epidemiology, and immunology of influenza and its complications.\n\nThe contract between the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the Commission on Influenza was completed on 15 December 1941. From this time on, the Ann Arbor unit became the focal center for the Commission and remained the core unit throughout the Commission`s existence. The Commission had by this time in December 1941, reached a point of coordinated intent, alert to the\n\n152\n\ntechniques of early detection of influenza disease at any site. It was prepared primarily to study the medical features of influenza. There was little else available except application of general public health measures to control virus infection.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF INFLUENZA VACCINE\n\nThe possibility for development of an inactivated vaccine, effective for prophylaxis against influenza, had been the main focus of attention since 1935 when Drs. Francis and Thomas McGill had first shown that active virus cultivated in tissue culture produced antibody in humans without producing an illness.1 It was also well established that vaccination could be effective against influenza virus in mice. There was wide experience in using live virus given intranasally in humans without producing overt illness.\n\nTo obtain further information on the usefulness of immunity produced by live wild influenza strains administered intranasally, Dr. Francis and his colleagues at the University of Michigan conducted a remarkable series of studies in \"volunteers\" at Ypsilanti State Hospital. The results were surprising when 27 of 30 men developed sharp attacks of influenza within 24 hours or less. The discovery of infection among non litigated individuals in the same quarters was obtained by serologic tests.\n\nFour months later the 27 persons described above were challenged with a different preparation of the same influenza B virus. The virus induced fever and clinical illness in many of the same group, accompanied in eight persons by additional antibody rises. There was evidence that the earlier infection had exerted some effect, because a milder illness occurred in most of those previously infected. A spray of irradiated influenza virus material produced no significant reaction, which indicated that the favorable effects observed were related to active virus.2\n\nThe fact that these persons lacked very strong resistance to the same virus, after a period of 4 months, raised serious doubts about the probable efficacy of vaccination with live attenuated strains. Furthermore, the consideration that inoculation of humans with live attenuated virus carried the possibility of are vival of virulence that might initiate another epidemic. The Surgeon General, Major General Norman Kirk, concluded that this was an inadvisable risk; hence, further work with live vaccine was not carried out at this time.\n\nIt was concluded that (a) vaccine must be given before the appearance of influenza because of the rapid spread of the virus, (b) large numbers of individuals were needed to obtain definite results, (c) these studies would have to be performed in vaccinated and unvaccinated (control) population groups under similar observation, and (d) the vaccine evaluations must be regarded as experimental. Always there was concern that an epidemic of influenza A might appear before the study got underway. Considerable attention was given to evaluation of methods of demonstrating vaccine effectiveness and detection of antigenic drift.\n\nIt was ultimately decided that the best source of virus for the vaccine would be infected egg allantoic fluid inactivated with Formalin and kept at 4? C in the fluid state. Lyophilization reduced the amount of available antigen. Antigenicity of the vaccine was planned to be tested in mice inoculated intraperitoneally. All vaccine testing was conducted on an experimental basis.\n\n1941 and 1942\n\nThe Commission was authorized by the Board to undertake a study of influenza vaccine of type A and B viruses conducted by Dr. Monroe Eaton in California should an appropriate opportunity arise. Two thousand doses of vaccine were provided by Dr. Hirst of the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation. The process of finding a satisfactory study group was abandoned with the entry of the United States into World War II. It was considered impractical to undertake a study in\n\n153\n\ntroops, particularly when influenza was not prevalent at the time.\n\nAfter consultation with five commercial firms (including Parke Davis and Co., Lilly, Lederle, Sharp & Dohme, and Squibb) plans were made to prepare 100,000 doses of inactivated vaccine from allantoic fluid. It was concluded that this could be accomplished in 4 to 8 weeks at a cost of 7 to 60 cents for a 1.0 mL dose. Each company then was asked to furnish sample lots of 250 mL. Samples were tested in mice for vaccine potency in Dr. Francis` laboratory in Michigan. There was extremely wide variation in antigenic potency, and sterility was also a problem.\n\n1942 and 1943\n\nBecause influenza A epidemics were said to occur every 2years, there was concern that an epidemic caused by the virus would occur in the years 1942 and 1943. Efforts to organize an evaluation within the armed services were unsuccessful. Two civilian-sponsored trials were conducted, the first under the direction of Drs. Wilson Smillie, Magill, and Norman Plummer at Cornell University through the University Health Service. A total of 2,885 student volunteers were enrolled in the study, of whom 1,673 received vaccine and 1,213served as controls. Serum specimens were collected from one-sixth of those enrolled in the study before, 3 weeks after, and 4 or 5 months after vaccination. The vaccines, manufacturers, and method of preparation are shown below:\n\nA number of epidemiologists had tried previously to predict when influenza epidemics were likely to occur. The prevailing dogma was that influenza A occurred every 2 or 3 years and influenza B every\n\nVaccines Used in Cornell University Study\n\nVaccine\n\nOrigin\n\nMethod of\n\nPreparation\n\nNo. of Persons\n\nA & B\n\nHirst\n\nFreezing, thawing, formalinized\n\n782\n\nA & B\n\nSharpe & Dohme\n\nFreezing, thawing, formalinized\n\n582\n\nA\n\nSharpe & Dohme\n\nFreezing, thawing, formalinized\n\n308\n\nÂ\n\nTotal Vaccinated\n\nFreezing, thawing, formalinized\n\n1,672\n\nControls\n\nSharpe & Dohme\n\nFormalinized saline placebo\n\n1,213\n\nTOTAL\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n2,885\n\n5 or 6 years. Dr. Alex Langmuir, Senior Epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control, tended to support this belief. This worked to the advantage of Dr. Davenport and me. Each year at the Atlantic City meetings of the American Society of Clinical Investigation and The Association of American Physicians, we would wager with Alex about what type of influenza A or B would occur during the next winter. Dr. Langmuir, with his profound knowledge of epidemiology, never had any doubts of what was coming. My friend, Fred Davenport, and I had observed enough outbreaks of influenza to realize that no prediction was justifiable and that whatever influenza had occurred in the past was no longer applicable. More rapid means of transportation provided by air travel had changed all the earlier rules. It seemed folly to predict what might happen.\n\nSera were also collected from all persons who reported to the Health Service with acute respiratory disease. No epidemic of influenza occurred, and it became obvious that influenza vaccine had no influence on other types of respiratory diseases. The serologic results suggested that influenza B had occurred but there was no evidence that it had affected the number of visits to the clinic. The reactions to the inoculations were of interest. Eleven percent of those who received vaccine experienced systemic reactions compared with 2.1% in the controls. Local reactions also were observed in 8.7% to 17.5%of individuals who received vaccine compared with 0.5% in the controls.\n\n154\n\nWhen no influenza appeared, Drs. Francis, Salk, and Harold Pearson at the University of Michigan conducted experimental trials in the inmate population at the Ypsilanti State Hospital in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and Eloise Hospital and Infirmary, Eloise, Michigan. Both institutions were occupied mainly\n\nby mental patients. The vaccine was prepared by absorbing the virus onto chick embryo red blood cells and then eluding the virus from the red cells. The virus was inactivated with Formalin and a mercurial bacteriostatic agent was added. Blood specimens were obtained from approximately 10% of the vaccinated and control groups before and 2 weeks after vaccination. The mean hemagglutination inhibiting (Hemagglutination Inhibition) titers of the vaccinated group against types A and B were increased approximately nine- and eightfold, respectively. The geometric mean titers decreased by approximately35% after 4 months, and at the end of a year the titers decreased by approximately 50%. Influenza A infection did not appear in this population. Influenza B apparently infected approximately 20% of this group even though clinical influenza was not detected in those persons who reported with respiratory illness. Thus, it appeared that influenza B occurred essentially as a subclinical infection.3,4\n\nDespite the lack of an epidemic and in an effort to gain information regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, groups of vaccinated and untreated subjects were tested for resistance by actual intranasal spray with active virus. Two milliliters of the virus were delivered into each nostril of each volunteer with an atomizer. One hundred two (102) men were exposed to artificial infection with a strain of influenza A virus (A/Baum/40),which differed from the PR/8 strain used in the vaccine. The control group of the subjects had not been previously vaccinated. Fifty percent of the controls developed temperature elevations of 100?F or more associated with clinical manifestations. Of those vaccinated 4.5 months earlier, 32% had similar reactions, whereas of those who were vaccinated 2 weeks previously, approximately 14% had fever as high as 100?F, but none as high as 101?F (see Appendix 1).\n\nNinety-six (96) men were exposed to influenza virus, type B, in the same manner. Of the 27 unvaccinated controls, 41% developed fever of 100?F or more with clinical symptoms. Of the 69 who had been vaccinated up to 4.5 months earlier, 7% to 13% had fever of 100?F; in no instance did it reach 101?F (see Appendix 1).\n\nThese results showed clearly that the vaccine exerted a protective effect against artificial infection of a severe degree. There was a tendency for resistance to be related to higher levels of antibody. However, even at the lowest antibody level, only about half the individuals became ill. The results well confirmed the concept that vaccination could induce resistance.\n\n1943 and 1944\n\nIn June 1943 authorization was obtained from The Surgeon General of the Army to conduct a vaccine study against influenza in the Army Student Training Program (ASTP) unit at Cornell University and other Army personnel at a few selected posts. A meeting was held on 2 September 1943 in the Office of The Surgeon General to discuss this program. The following individuals were present:\n\nDr. Francis Blake\n\nDr. Monroe D. Eaton\n\nDr. George K. Hirst\n\nMajor Norman Plummer\n\nLieutenant Colonel Elliott S. Robinson\n\nCaptain Phillip E. Sartwell\n\nColonel Stanhope Bayne-Jones\n\nDr. Thomas Francis, Jr.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Esmond Long\n\nDr. Colin MacLeod\n\nDr. Thomas P. Magill\n\nDr. Elsmere R. Rickard\n\nDr. Jonas E. Salk\n\n155\n\nIt was agreed that vaccination in the various ASTP units be put on a compulsory basis with half of each unit to receive vaccine and half the control inoculum. The test vaccine would be of the eluate type with vaccination contemplated to begin in October.5 If no influenza appeared before 15January 1944, the vaccination was to be repeated. A follow-up plan provided that approximately 5% of the vaccinated subjects and 10% to 25% of the controls would provide blood specimens for antibody studies at the time of vaccination and 2weeks later. The purpose of taking blood specimens from a larger number ofc ontrols was to obtain information on the frequency of subclinical infections. Throat washings and paired sera were to be obtained from as many of the volunteers with cases of respiratory infection as possible. Two virus strains, namely PR/8 and the Weiss strain, an influenza A virus isolated in an Army camp in May 1943, would represent the A component. The B component would be equal to the A component and would be made up entirely from the B Lee strain of virus. The contemplated arrangements concerning the university groups and their supervision by the members of the Commission on Influenza were\n\nDr. Monroe Eaton\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n\nDr. George Hirst\n\nPrinceton University\n\nDr. Thomas P Magill\n\nCornell University and New York Medical and\n\nDental Colleges\n\nDr. William M.

Rickard\n\nUniversity of Minnesota\n\nObligingly, an epidemic of influenza appeared in sufficient extent and severity and covered the United States with readily detectable illness. It was a mild, and, in most instances, an uncomplicated disease. The scope of the epidemic was observed to be higher than in any other epidemic since 1918 and 1919.\n\nOn the basis of clinical results, it was found that among 6,263 vaccinated individuals, there was an attack rate of 2.22%. Among the 6,211 control participants, the attack rate was 7.11%. Estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) was 69%.6 This trend was the same in all study groups. In some are as the ratio of control to vaccinated was as high as 6:1. In California, however, the trend was less pronounced. There was a suggestion from the serologic data obtained that the virus in California had shown some antigenic change and differed more from the Weiss strain contained in the vaccine than at the other institutions.\n\nIt was also observed that in both vaccinated and control groups, the greatest percentage of cases of illness occurred in those individuals with low antibody titers. Persons with the higher antibody titers, whether produced through natural causes or by vaccination, were much less frequently affected.7,8\n\nIt was also noted at Iowa9 and at City College of New York,10 where the influenza appeared before the vaccination was completed, that in the first week after vaccination there was no difference between the incidence of disease between controls and the vaccinated subjects. Thereafter, incidence in the groups deviated with a sharp reduction in the frequency of illness in the vaccinated population. Cases of pneumonia, which were few in number, occurred almost entirely in unvaccinated persons. In institutions where Streptococci were isolated from the pharynx of up to 20% of persons, pneumonia cases were few in number. No deaths were recorded among the approximately 12,474 individuals under observation. Subclinical infections occurred in up to 40% of individuals. Toxic reactions to vaccine were considered unimportant. Two cases were presumed to be due to a sensitization reaction to the egg component of the vaccine: an asthmatic reaction in one patient and an urticarial rash in another. Systemic reactions occurred in 2% to 3% of those vaccinated and were similar to the mild reactions observed after typhoid vaccination. When the data were sufficiently compiled to provide a clear indication of the\n\n156\n\neffect of the vaccination, a conference was held at the Rockefeller Foundation on 2 February 1944. The participants were\n\nDr. Francis G. Blake\n\nDr. Joseph W. Beard (by invitation)\n\nDr. Thomas Francis, Jr., Chairman\n\nDr. Wendell M. Stanley (by invitation)\n\nDr. George K. Hirst\n\nColonel Stanhope Bayne-Jones\n\nDr. Thomas P. Magill\n\nColonel Karl R. Lundeberg\n\nDr. Jonas E. Salk\n\nLieutenant Colonel Arthur P. Long\n\nMajor Norman Plummer\n\nIt was agreed that the results obtained had shown that the vaccine used was highly, although not completely, effective in preventing influenza A.\n\nDr. Francis was asked to prepare a statement of the results obtained in the Commission`s studies on the effectiveness of vaccine in experimentally induced influenza, the field trial of vaccination against influenza A, reactions to the vaccine, and specifications for the production of vaccine. This statement was anticipated to serve as a basis for evaluation and recommendations to The Surgeon General. After full discussion, Commission members voted to recommend the following to The Surgeon General: (a) All troops deployed overseas and other military personnel in this country should be vaccinated against influenza, as the amount of vaccine permitted. (b) Special controlled field trials should be continued with modifications of influenza vaccine. These should be undertaken on a selected basis under the supervision of the Commission on Influenza in certain units of the Army, at an appropriate time when vaccine became available. (c) The type of influenza vaccine currently used should be the same as that used by the Commission in the ASTP test (mixed A present and B formalinized vaccine), according to the specifications in the statement submitted by Dr. Francis.\n\nFurther conferences with representatives of biological firms were held. Finally, on 1 July 1944 the program was officially approved. This provided for the acquisition of 10,000,000 doses of vaccine for use throughout the entire U.S. Army, if necessary. The vaccine to be prepared was to be the eluate from chick embryo erythrocytes with the possibility of changing to other procedures as new information warranted.\n\nTOXICITY, STABILITY, ANTIGENICITY\n\nIn January 1944 Dr. Joseph Beard11 of Duke University and Dr. Wendell Stanley12 of Princeton University, each of whom had worked under Office of Scientific Research and Development contracts, suggested that the influenza vaccine could be prepared by Sharples centrifugation with a high degree of purity. This procedure was conceived to increase the amount of virus in the vaccine and at the same time remove practically all the nonvirus protein. At the time there was no information available on the stability of the purified vaccine or on its toxicity. Stability and toxicity were thought to be caused by the amount of virus in the vaccine rather than the egg protein.\n\nAt a conference held on 2 February 1944, it was recommended that investigation of more purified concentrations of the vaccine prepared by Sharples centrifugation be sponsored and supervised by the Commission on Influenza through collaboration with Drs. Stanley and Beard. Controlled field trials were contemplated. The field trials were proposed to discover the following: (a) The protective value of the vaccine in animals; (b) the degree and duration of antibody response in humans; (c)the frequency and severity of reactions in humans with different concentrations of virus; (d) the practicality of com-\n\n157\n\nmercial mass production, because any increase in the number of fertile eggs required per dose proportionately increased the cost; and (e)prophylactic value in humans.\n\nThe eluate vaccine that had been proven effective in the 1943 field trials served as a point of reference. It was estimated that the amount of virus in that vaccine was about 0.2 mg/mL.\n\nDr. Salk, who worked at Eloise Hospital in Michigan with vaccine prepared by Dr. Beard, found that three of six individuals given vaccine containing 0.2 mg of B Lee influenza virus, developed fevers of more than 100?F with troublesome symptoms; in the controls who received the PR/8 strain, none showed fevers over100?F. Three of the six who received 0.4 mg of the B virus vaccine developedf ebrile reactions between 101`F and 102?F with overt manifestations. Three of the six persons given this amount of type A vaccine had fevers of 100?F. These data suggested that this dosage level represented the upper limit of tolerance.\n\nDr. Hirst at West Coxsackie, New York13 and Dr. Salk tested different dosages using vaccines by Dr. Stanley`s methods and vaccine prepared by Sharp & Dohme (double cycle centrifugation).12 Of those men who received 2.0 mg of vaccine, 80% had fever and symptoms of toxicity that clearly indicated that this dosage was unacceptable. A dose of 0.2 mg elicited fever of 100?F in 4% to 15% of subjects. The Commission vaccine referred to earlier had induced a slightly higher incidence of reactions. Dr. Hirst gave a few volunteers 10 mg of vaccine; all had sharp, severe reactions. It appeared that the desired amount of antigen should probably not be more than 0.2 mg.\n\nAnother batch of vaccine using Dr. Stanley`s method prepared by the Squibb Company caused considerably less toxicity. Using 0.5 mg produced similar reactions in only 16% of the subjects, and a preparation of eluate vaccine made by the same firm produced the same results.\n\nDr. Beard and his associates in Durham, North Carolina, conducted another study on the toxicity of vaccine in swine. This was performed on his premises, which he had converted into a large pig farm. The swine received doses of virus varying from 0.125 mg to 2.0 mg. In animals that received 0.5 mg or more of vaccine, general reactions were noted followed by loss of weight. These studies helped define the upper limit of acceptability.14,15\n\nOver the 16-fold range of dose employed, antibody response differed by only twofold. Revaccination with the same dose at 1-week intervals showed little effect. As the interval before the second dose was lengthened, the response increased and reached higher levels; antibody titers were more prolonged, regardless of the amount of virus injected. These results were of interest because of the insignificant difference in antibody response that resulted from relatively large increases in the amount of antigen used. Dr. Beard also tested alum-precipitated vaccine and concluded that there was little gained by this procedure.\n\nDrs. Hirst and Salk followed the serologic response to different amounts ofv irus in the vaccine. Dr. Hirst found that the antibody response to 2.0 mg was definitely better than 0.2 mg after 2, 18, or 60 weeks. The results obtained with vaccine used by Commission members in 1943 fell between the three. Ther esponse to the Weiss strain of influenza A was less than the PR/8 strain of A or the Lee strain of influenza B. Although these data indicated the possible advantages of doses approaching 2.0 mg in humans, these were counteracted by th efact that five to six eggs were needed to obtain that amount of virus. In addition, the toxic reactions in humans were proportional to the virus concentration. This was taken to indicate that the amount of virus, as presently prepared, was probably appropriate. Stability studies at Michigan and in Dr. Stanley`s laboratory showed that vaccine prepared by centrifugation was stable at 4?F for as long as 1 year.\n\nOn 30 March 1945 at The Surgeon General`s Office, a meeting was held that included representatives of the National Institutes of Health (Dr. Joseph Bell), Army Procurement of The Surgeon General`s Office, and Drs. Beard, Stanley, and Francis. Centrifugation was accepted as an alternate method for production of influenza virus vaccine for Army use. The technique to be employed was essentially that described in Dr. Stanley`s publication.12 It was specified that the material would contain 0.03 mg/mL of nitrogen of stated minimal agglutinating titer. Despite some contrary opinions, it was concluded that the potency test in mice was desirable and should be retained. The producers now had a choice of two approved methods.\n\n158\n\nOn 21 June 1945 Commission members and representatives of The Surgeon General`s Office met at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City to consider the subject of vaccination. Recognized epidemics of influenza B had occurred during May and June of that year. Those in attendance were\n\nDr. Francis G. Blake, President of the Board\n\nMajor John H. Dingle\n\nDr. Thomas Francis, Jr., Director of the\n\nCommission on Influenza\n\nCaptain George K. Hirst\n\nDr. Ronald Hare of Toronto, Canada (by invitation)\n\nDr. Joseph W. Beard\n\nDr. Alto E. Feller\n\nDr. William R. Hale\n\nDr. Thomas P Magill\n\nDr. Jonas E. Salk\n\nDr. Wendell M. Stanley (by invitation)\n\nDr. Wilson G. Smillie\n\nFor The Surgeon General`s Office:\n\nColonel Elliott S. Robinson\n\nMajor Norman Plummer\n\nAt that time there was a general discussion of the desirability of vaccination with the aim to avoid the effects of a gradual intensification of the disease such as had occurred in 1918. Colonel Robinson stated that as of 1 June 1945, 3,000,000 doses of vaccine had been delivered. According to planned schedules, enough vaccine for recruits would be on hand by1 October 1945.\n\nThe following recommendations were made to the AFEB: (a) Provide influenza vaccine in sufficient amounts; (b) if there was no epidemic of sufficient severity to justify vaccination earlier, vaccination should be carried out by the Army during October 1945; (c) further field trials should be carried out if suitable locations could be found. Dr. Stanley stated that vaccine prepared by centrifugation would be available for these purposes.\n\nA committee chaired by Captain Hirst was appointed to study and make recommendations concerning common laboratory procedures. Drs. Beard and Stanley were also requested to study the methods of estimating influenza virus quantitatively, which, at that time, gave quite different results in different laboratories.\n\nThe recommendation for the use of vaccine in the Army was presented by Dr. Blake to The Surgeon General in a communication dated 2 July 1945. It was approved by General Kirk on 10 August 1945. Final approval of the Secretary of War was recorded on 25 August 1945. The program of vaccination with eluate was carried out by the Army in October and November 1945.\n\nAn increasing incidence of influenza B developed in the United States during November and December 1945. It was reported that Army personnel who were vaccinated experienced a much lower incidence of illness than unvaccinated Naval and civilian groups.\n\nThe results to that point had demonstrated that vaccination effectively prevented epidemic influenza A. However, this was only one important step in the development of an effective vaccine prophylaxis for this important epidemic scourge. Yet, it was a major accomplishment and served as a stimulus to find more effective vaccines. The various progressive steps were made not only by members of the Commission, but by numerous associates and assistants. They called on, without reservation, the President of the Board, other Board members, General J. Steven Simmons, General Bayne-Jones, and Preventive Medicine officers continuously for their advice and assistance in making arrangements for the investigative work. Contributions of pharmaceutical firms to solution of production problems and safety matters were very significant. These firms continued to investigate with methods and procedures at their own expense, as requested, and contributed valuable suggestions to make procurement of vaccine for testing possible. The experience gained in the process of virus cultivation, harvesting,\n\n159\n\nand control of contamination was both troublesome and costly. The field trial in ASTP units represented a unique example of the conduct of difficult experimentation made possible through the cooperation of groups of many persons engaged in a wide variety of activities.\n\nINTRANASAL SERUM PROPHYLAXIS\n\nThe possibility that influenza could be prevented by intranasal administration of appropriate immune serum had been shown by results reported by some investigators in studies with mice. In addition, the interest in this approach had been heightened by the report in 1939 of A. A. Smorodinsev and his associates in the USSR. He reported that administration of spray containing a slittle as 2.0 mL of immune horse serum in humans once in 2 weeks had reduced the incidence of influenza infection by 10-fold (82/1,000).16 (In California a prominent magazine featured, under a banner heading reading \"Flu is Through,\" a photograph of 12 men in naval uniforms each with a tube in his mouth connected to a chamber that was said to contain atomized immune horse serum.) It was considered important to gain information on the efficacy of this procedure as an emergency measure alternative to uniform vaccination.\n\nThe Army Epidemiological Board in May 1942 recommended that the Commission on Influenza undertake studies on the prophylactic and therapeutic effect of convalescent serum given intranasally should the proper opportunity arise.\n\nDiscussions were held with Dr. Paul Cannon, who was interested in local immunization of the respiratory tract, and with Dr. O. H. Robertson whose group was working with aerosol techniques and routes of infection. Dr. Clayton Loosli, who had been working with Dr. Robertson, undertook the developmental aspect of the investigations. A subcommittee of members of the Commission comprising Drs. Cannon, Irving Gordon, Loosli, Robertson, and Francis was formed as an epidemic study group in 1942.17However, no epidemic occurred during 1942.\n\nVolunteers for experimental studies were recruited at a camp for religious conscientious objectors at Wellston, Michigan. Dr. Salk joined the Committee members to help in conducting studies there. After it was shown that the influenza B virus preparation that had been planned for use was unsatisfactory, allantoic fluid was used containing a new strain of influenza A isolated in 1940. The results of the two completed experiments that were performed are summarized in Appendix 2.\n\nTwo experiments were performed, each in healthy, husky volunteers. In Experiment 1, the allantoic fluid produced illness in almost all of the volunteers who received 1.0 mL of saline aerosol before an aerosol of the virus. With no exception, the control volunteers who received immune serum followed by inactivated virus escaped illness. The serum had no demonstrable effect.\n\nExperiment 2 was carried out with a different preparation of virus. On the assumption that the virus challenge might have been too strong, the amount of high titer convalescent serum was far greater than that used in the first experiment. It was given in three doses before administration of the live virus and also 7 and 17 hours after the virus challenge; in all, a total of 37 mL were given. The second group received doses of saline at the same intervals and in similar amounts. The test was milder in that only 8 of 15 (53%) controls were ill, and the febrile reactions were less marked than in the first experiment. Of those who received immune serum, 11 of 16 (69%) had fever of 100?F or more; the distribution of severity was approximately the same as in the controls. There was no effect on the incubation period (see Appendix 2).\n\nTo gain a better idea of the amount of virus in the challenge preparation, the virus was titrated in volunteers at the Ypsilanti State Hospital. Results of the titrations are also shown in Appendix 2. It appeared that the amount of virus was by no means excessive.\n\n160\n\nThe evidence was conclusive even though unexpected. Further studies were not carried out because the results of the vaccination study in1943 were far more satisfactory. It was hoped to carry out further studies during the epidemic of 1943, but suitable conditions did not occur.\n\nInvestigation of the contraindications caused by sensitization to the various antisera that had been proposed were carried out in guinea pigs by Dr. Cannon`s group. Normal horse serum, \"despeciated\" anti-influenza horse serum, Lilly`s purified horse serum, goat serum, swine serum, and crystalline egg albumin were all tested in guinea pigs. All produced anaphylactic sensitization. This provided fair warning against continued use of such sera in humans.17\n\nMETHODS FOR DIAGNOSIS AND ISOLATION OF VIRUS\n\nA number of investigators undertook studies to develop protocols for rapid diagnosis of influenza infection. The agglutination-inhibition test of Hirst proved to be of great value, and a number of modifications were made to expand the value of the test.18 One test that had been extensively used was the one described by Dr. Salk. 9 The time required for identification of influenza virus in the throat washings had been reduced to between 36 and 72 hours. Drs. Rickard, Eaton, and Hirst each attempted an evaluation of different procedures with somewhat different results. Nonetheless, both amniotic and allantoic inoculations served to speed the diagnosis of influenza considerably.\n\nADJUVANT EFFECTS\n\nThe possibility of finding adjuvant materials that would heighten the antibody response and prolong immunizing effects was undertaken particularly by the Ann Arbor, Michigan, groin, and their studies suggested that the adsorption of virus to calcium phosphate was not promising.20\n\nCENTER FOR THE STUDY OF STRAINS OF VIRUS\n\nOne of the constant problems encountered was whether a virus strain was suitable for vaccine production. There was enough antigenicheterogeneity to raise serious questions about the capacity for one strain to induce immunity to others of the same type. In the 1943 epidemic the suggestion had been advanced that the vaccine had not stimulated a satisfactory antibody response to the current epidemic strains. The PR/8 strain of influenza A was consistently shown to be one of the most effective ones studied.\n\nTo gain further information about these characteristics, Dr. Magill accepted the invitation of the Commission on Influenza in 1944 to establish a center for the collection of strains of virus submitted for study of their antigenic patterns and immunizing potencies.21 His work was also to include the preparation of specific antisera and a broad hyper immune serum for purposes of strain identification. In this connection it was noted that Dr. Francis reported apparent variation in two lines of the same strain of virus grown in different media.\n\n161\n\nÂ\n\nINFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL FACTORS ON INFLUENZA VIRUS\n\nIn the course of studying the aerial transmission of respiratory infection, Dr. Loosli evaluated the influence of temperature and humidity on survival of influenza virus. In the experimental spray chambers22 he found that the virus remained infectious at low humidity (17% to 24%) for as long as 24hours. As the humidity progressively increased, the period of survival was reduced so that at humidity of 80% to 90% it was infective for no longer than 1hour. The same trend was followed with virus found on the floor in dust. What relation these facts had with the general epidemiology of influenza was a subject of speculation.\n\nTOXICITY OF INFLUENZA VIRUS FOR MICE\n\nIn studying a strain of influenza isolated in 1943, Dr. Hale noted that intracerebral inoculation of mice caused convulsions. These were not associated with multiplication of virus in the brain. This convulsion-producing factor was heat labile and was absorbed and eluted from erythrocytes with the virus activity; it was neutralized by specific antibody23The significance of this intrinsic toxicity of the virus in relation to the symptomatology and pathogenesis of the disease was considered important for future studies.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR PSITTACOSIS-LGVA GROUP OF VIRUSES\n\nDr. Francis Gordon at the University of Chicago investigated the specific diagnosis of Psittacosislymphogranuloma venereum group (LGVA) closely related group of viruses. Sera prepared in chickens were shown by neutralization tests to have a high degree of specificity. In the course of these tests, information was obtained on nonspecific reactions to chicken sera that had probably been the chief obstacle to the use of serum from chickens in serologic tests.24\n\nATYPICAL PNEUMONIA\n\nDuring the fall and winter of 1942 the increased prevalence of atypical pneumonia in the Army and the lack of information regarding it setiology justified an extensive investigation. Drs. John H. Dingle and G. John Buddingh, who had been members of the Commission on Influenza, joined the Commission on Acute Respiratory Disease (CARD). As work expanded, Dr. Alto Feller joined the CARD group. The Commission on Influenza provided a laboratory technician and a statistical assistant. In February 1942, Dr. Francis spent 2 weeks with the CARD at Camp Claiborne in Louisiana, aiding in the investigation and participating in other aspects of the study. Following this, the Commission on Influenza laboratory at Ann Arbor, Michigan, in an effort to isolate virus, tested throat washings in mice from nine patients and sputum from two characteristic cases at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. Eggs, mice,\n\n162\n\nCLAYTONLOOSLI, M.D.\n\nDr. Clayton Loosh was an Idahoan who attended the University of Chicago. He worked closely with Dr. O. H. Robertson. He was particularly helpful to the Commission in developing effective means of delivering virus in suspension for experimental challenges in human beings. He was also instrumental in developing the \"glycolizers\" that were used to create suspension of propylene glycol in the air. These were widely used at Camp Detrick for the protection of the staff who were working with particularly lethal agents. Later, after he became Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, he continued to be an active participant in the affairs of the Commission. He worked with mice, trying to produce a controlled antigenic change in the virus. He also obtained interesting, and somewhat surprising, data on the effect of Los Angeles smog on mice infected with influenza virus. At one point, it appeared that the smog actually helped the animals, rather than hurt them. He was a very friendly person with broad interests who was exceptionally well qualified to be dean of a medical school.\n\n163\n\ncotton rats, hamsters, ferrets, monkeys, rice birds, doves, and chickens were used. No influenza virus was recovered. In four instances, a virus similar to the meningo-pneumonitis virus of mice was recovered from the sputum or throat washings by passage through mice or rice birds. In each of these instances, the patients were blacks who had significant levels of complement-fixing antibodies to LGV in their sera. Serologic tests of the patients against influenza A and B were negative. The results of complement fixation tests using both meningo-pneumonitis and psittacosis virus performed with serum collected from more than 300 patients and controls were essentially parallel. Although a relatively large number of persons showed positive reactions, it was uncommon to find any increase in titer during the course of illness. Analysis of the results showed that positive results were concentrated largely in blacks, suggesting that this was probably a reflection of a common antigen with LGV virus.\n\nFrom July to November 1942, Dr. Feller, working in the laboratory in Michigan, in an effort to isolate a virus, tested large numbers of specimens from a variety of military bases in the Midwest. In two instances, viruses resembling meningo-pneumonitis were recovered. One of these patients showed a significant antibody rise in complement fixation tests.\n\nWith the establishment of the permanent CARD at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the materials stored at Michigan were transferred to its laboratories, and investigations of atypical pneumonia at Ann Arbor, Michigan, were discontinued. Repeated clinical and epidemiological studies at Fort Custer, Michigan, led Dr. Francis to the opinion that \"atypical pneumonia\" was occurring in the Army probably as a single entity. The relatively low transmissibility and its random distribution suggested that pneumonia might be a rather infrequent manifestation of a more common disease in the trachea and upper respiratory tract. The whole course of the disease differed from that of influenza in that the peaks of the outbreaks were long plateaus rather than sharp spikes and only the recruits were infected. With influenza, both recruits and permanent personnel were affected. There were also sharp differences in the clinical manifestations of the two diseases.\n\nThe solution to the cause of this disease became highly competitive. Dr. Frank Horsfall and his group at the Rockefeller Institute reported transmission of an agent to mongooses.25 This group also isolated a Streptococcus(M.G.) and showed that the agglutination titers of convalescent sera of many patients with atypical pneumonia were higher than those in the acute phase sera.26\n\nDr. Eaton had demonstrated in 1942 that when sputa from patients with atypical pneumonia were inoculated into cotton rats or hamsters, small lung lesions developed in a large proportion of the animals.27Serial passage of these lung specimens produced even better lesions, but it was found that a number of wild viruses was being picked up. Material from patients at Cowell Memorial Hospital in Berkeley, California, when inoculated into eggs, was shown to produce a similar pneumonic lesion and could be passed using a suspension of amniotic fluid, and trachea and lung of the embryo.28It was shown in neutralization tests that fourfold increases in antibody titers were obtained in 68% of the aired sera from patients with atypical pneumonia. An additional 16% showed a twofold rise.29-31 These were the same patients in whom rises in titer of cold agglutinins had previously been demonstrated.32 Dr. Eaton and his collaborators were convinced that they had excluded wild animal viruses, but others refused to accept their interpretation until Dr. Robert M. Chanock at the NIH showed that the agent (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) could be grown on synthetic media.33Drs. Eaton of the California Department of Public Health and K. F. Meyer of the Hooper Foundation of the University of California differed so strongly on the importance of psittacosis-like virus that they stopped speaking to one another.\n\nHAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE\n\nUnder the direction of Dr. Hattie Alexander, a laboratory was organized in1941 for the typing of Haemophilus influenzae and for the preparation of diagnostic reagents. Antisera of various types were\n\n164\n\nproduced in rabbits on the basis of agglutinin nitrogen. Beginning with the influenza epidemic of 1943 and continuing through the spring of 1945, a study of throat cultures was carried out on normal young adults to obtain background information on severe pneumonia. No encapsulated strains of H. influenzae were found. Only 2% of those cultures were potentially encapsulated. Tests on the susceptibility of these organisms to sulfonamides revealed considerable variation.34 Classification of H. para influenzae was also attempted and suggestive evidence of three serologic groups was obtained.\n\nThe value of these studies had been a continuing evaluation to determine the significance of the presence of microorganisms in respiratory diseases, especially influenza, when characteristic association is expected. In the event of an upsurge of these bacteria, the availability of a diagnostic center seemed essential to maintain a state of preparedness. Support of the work was discontinued on 30 June 1945.\n\nMASKS\n\nAt the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the Commission in April 1941, Drs. Robertson and Dingle agreed to review the available investigations concerning masks designed to prevent dissemination of respiratory discharges. They obtained advice and recommendations from Drs. Charles K. McKhann of Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and M. W. Jennison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge. The latter recommended a gauze-covered mask with a Canton flannel filler and a flexible nose band. In September 1942, it was suggested that a conference beheld to include those investigators actively engaged in the study of masks.\n\nA meeting held 26 September 1942 was attended by the following persons:\n\nDr. Thomas Francis, Jr.\n\nChairman: Commission on Influenza\n\nDr. Charles K. McKhann\n\nCommission on Measles and Mumps\n\nDr. Deryl Hart\n\nDuke University, Durham, North Carolina\n\nDr. Ronald Rooks\n\nUniversity of Iowa, Iowa City\n\nDr. M. W. Jennison\n\nM.I.T., Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nMajor A. P Long\n\nThe Surgeon General`s Office\n\nConference members agreed that the masks ordinarily worn were worthless and recommended use of the type shown by extensive physical and bacteriological studies to be most effective. Specifications were formulated by Dr. McKhann and approved by other members of the conference. The report of the conference was transmitted to the President of the Board on 10 October 1942.\n\nCHEMOTHERAPEUTIC STUDIES OF EXPERIMENTAL, COMBINED BACTERIAL, AND INFLUENZA VIRUS PNEUMONIA\n\nAt Washington University, beginning in 1943, Dr. Barry Wood assisted by Dr. Carl Harford initiated studies on the influence of sulfonamides in pneumonia in which influenza virus was associated with type I Pneumococcus or hemolytic Streptococcus inanimals.35 The following observations were made: (a) In mice, even in the presence of subsequently fatal infection due to influenza virus, a concomitant bacterial invasion was eliminated by sulfonamide. (b) In rats, the bacterial component of a combined infection was also controlled. (c) In mice, the inhalation of finely dispersed type I pneumo-\n\n165\n\ncocci did not produce infection, but if the mice had been previously infected with a sublethal virus infection 5 days earlier, they died of a pneumococcal infection. The bacteria did not enhance the virus effect before treatment with sulfonamide brought about recovery.\n\nThey concluded that in the event of an epidemic of influenza, chemotherapeutic measures would probably aid in controlling pneumonia if a pneumococcal infection was superimposed on an influenza viral infection. This coincided with a comment made by Drs. Eaton and Meiklejohn that of six instances of pneumonia that occurred in their unvaccinated controls of 1943, all responded promptly to sulfadiazine.\n\nPENICILLIN IN STREPTOCOCCAL TONSILLITIS\n\nIn 1944 at Fort Jay Regional Hospital, Governor`s Island, New York, Dr. Plummer and his associates showed that in severe tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus hemolyticus, continued treatment with 15,000 units of penicillin given intramuscularly every 4 hours promptly produced negative throat cultures. However, discontinuation of treatment within 6 days resulted in relapse and return of infection. With longer treatment, pharyngeal cultures remained negative.36 The study emphasized the dangers in casual treatment of acute streptococcal infections of the throat.\n\nPSITTACOSIS\n\nIn 1945, Dr. Eaton reported a study of the effects of some 60compounds, unrelated to sulfonamides, on viruses of the psittacosis group. Allresults were negative. It was shown in certain species of animals that a drug might show some activity against a given virus, but against the same virus it would have no effect in a different animal species. This was an interesting observation. Chemotherapy of influenza virus infections showed no progress, which emphasized the need for further exploration using different methods.37\n\nHEPATITIS-EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nInvestigation of Post vaccination Jaundice at Chanute Field, Jefferson Barracks, Scott Field, and Fort Sheridan-12-20 April 1942\n\nOn 12 April 1942, Dr. McKhann of the Commission on Measles and Mumps and Dr. Francis of the Commission on Influenza undertook an investigation of jaundice, which was occurring at Army camps. At each installation, clinical and epidemiological studies were conducted and specimens were obtained for investigation in the laboratory of the Commission of Influenza in Michigan. As data on icteric patients were assembled at Chanute Field, Illinois, it became apparent there that the most prominent common factor was the prior vaccination with yellow fever vaccine, lot no. 335. The incubation period in 80% of the cases varied from 62 to 84 days. Lack of contagious spread was clearly demonstrated. At Scott Field, Illinois, information was obtained from additional personnel vaccinated with lot no. 335. Ten thousand men at that post who were vaccinated with other lots were not infected. The results\n\n166\n\nindicated that in this area, that yellow fever vaccine lot no. 335 was seriously implicated. The incidence of hepatitis in vaccinees was10% to 15%. There were a few instances in which other lots were indicated, such as lot nos. 338, 351, 334, and possibly a few others. At this time it was learned that lot no. 368 had been used at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, at the end of February 1942 without any recognizable effect by April. Attention was called to the fact that the resulting illness was severely incapacitating and that sequelae were anticipated. The disease was clinically comparable to that ordinarily called catarrhal jaundice. In view of the extended incubation period, comments were made regarding pathogenesis of the disease and whether it might be due to yellow fever virus or to an extraneous agent accidentally incorporated in the vaccine. The report suggested that a commission be organized to study the biochemistry, treatment, and prognosis of the disease.17\n\nFort Custer-4 and 5 June 1942\n\nDr. Francis also investigated the same illness at Fort Custer.17 At that time there were 212 cases of jaundice, which increased to a total of 650 cases by the end of July 1942. Yellow fever vaccine lot no. 368 appeared to be responsible for all the cases. It was the same lot that had been used at Fort Sheridan, where no cases had been detected within 2months after vaccination. The illness at Fort Custer seemed less severe than that observed earlier in the spring and the incubation period was most commonly90 to 100 days. Urticaria was observed to occur in a certain number of persons 1or 2 weeks before onset of signs of acute hepatitis. A group of officers of the12th General Hospital, then located at the post, were interested in conducting an extensive study of the disease and recommended that the Commission on Influenza conduct these studies. As a result, a committee was appointed by the Commanding Officer with Lieutenant Colonel N. H. Barker as President. In their studies, the committee emphasized the frequency of non-icteric cases with apparently similar disturbances and the adverse effect of exercise upon patients who were at this stage of illness or who were in the early stage of convalescence. Further attempts were made at the University of Michigan laboratory to establish an etiologic agent. The excellent report to the Board included a large number of determinations of liver function tests, effect of exercise and therapy, and a description of relapses. This report was submitted to The Surgeon General`s Office late in 1942 and represented a major contribution of new knowledge regarding hepatitis.\n\nINFECTIOUS HEPATITIS\n\nThe differentiation between infectious hepatitis and what is now known as serum hepatitis was clarified by Dr. Francis, who spent approximately 6 weeks in Sicily and Italy at the invitation of the Surgeon of Natousa (North Africa theater of operations) and his colleagues in the Armed Services. After considering many possibilities, they noted a correlation among the occurrence of hepatitis, malaria, and dysentery. They also noted a relationship between traumatic injuries and blood transfusion to transmission of the agent but obtained no supporting data to support this concept. Insect transmission was also considered. Dr. Francis collected a number of specimens, particularly blood, which were transported to Ann Arbor for further study. A full report was made to The Surgeon General, Department of the Army.17\n\nCLINICAL INVESTIGATION WITH MATERIALS FROM NATOUSA\n\nIn the summer of 1944, arrangements were made for volunteers from the state prison at Dearborn, Michigan, to participate in experimental studies involving the sera and tissue specimens obtained in North Africa. Captain A. W. Frisch, an experienced microbiologist, was reassigned from Camp Custer to work at the Commission`s laboratory in Ann Arbor and to assist in these studies.\n\n167\n\nExperiment 1\n\nFour volunteers received a filtered dilution of serum subcutaneously from a patient taken 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Four other persons were given a 20% suspension of filtered feces orally from the same patient. Four volunteers were given 1 mL of serum subcutaneously taken from a patient 3 days after the onset of jaundice. Four volunteers received the same amount of the similar serum that they gargled and swallowed. No jaundice occurred.\n\nExperiment 2\n\nOn 13 April 1945, a study was carried out using mosquitoes that had fed on the same patient and were killed at various times after feeding on the patient. The mosquitoes had been allowed to feed for 1 day after the onset of symptoms. Five were sacrificed after 1 day of feeding and the others 8 days after feeding. A suspension was made of a pool of mosquitoes and injected into four volunteers subcutaneously. No jaundice resulted in any of the recipients.\n\nExperiment 338\n\nIn May 1944, serum was obtained from an apparently well soldier who had served as a donor to a man who was recovering from a gunshot wound. Two days later the donor reported to sick call with icterus. The disease developed rapidly and he died 5 days after serving as donor. The recipient had his first suggestive symptoms of hepatitis 11 days after the transfusion. After 19 days his liver edge was palpable and tender. More definite systemic symptoms, including fever, were noted on the 20th day, and jaundice was first detected on the 21st day after transfusion. Samples of serum were taken 8 days after transfusion (13 days before the onset of jaundice) and also 14 days after transfusion (7 days before the appearance of jaundice). On 13 April 1945, four men received subcutaneously1 mL of the filtrate from the first sample of serum and another four men received 1 ml, of the filtrate of the second sample. Thirty-eight days after inoculation of the first group, one of the patients became ill. Jaundice developed on the 41st day and the patient died on the 46th day. The second subject developed symptoms on the 39th day, jaundice on the 44th day, and a relatively mild, uneventful course of hepatitis thereafter. The third subject had onset of symptoms on the 44th day, jaundice on the 49th day, and a moderately severe illness afterward. The fourth subject had intermittent symptoms from 21st to the 41st day without evidence of jaundice or hepatitis detectable by biochemical tests.\n\nIn the second group, one volunteer had onset of symptoms on the 43rd day and jaundice on the 47th day followed by a moderate illness and uneventful recovery. The other three subjects had intermittent periods of digestive disturbance, but no jaundice was noted over a period of 135 days.\n\nThe experiments were useful but inconclusive in solving the problems of hepatitis. It became obvious that the limitations in the use of human subjects was such that only very vital questions dealing with the problem should be investigated in this manner. Other specific tests useful for detection of virus or the mechanisms of its action must be sought.\n\nNo further studies were performed in volunteers because World War II came to an end and Captain Frisch was demobilized.\n\nETIOLOGIC STUDIES\n\nAt the laboratory of the Commission on Influenza in Ann Arbor, Michigan, studies of hepatitis were carried out with the aim to induce the disease in experimental animals. This was performed with material taken from14 acutely ill patients and 5 fatal cases. The materials included stool specimens,\n\n168\n\ndefibrinated blood serum, duodenal drainage fluid, liver sections, and suspension of duodenal wall. Monkeys, lambs, pigs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, mice, eggs, chicks, and chickens were utilized in the studies. Presumably infected tissue was introduced by feeding and by the intravenous, intracerebral, intraperitoneal, intrahepatic, and subcutaneous routes. In all instances animals were kept under observation for at least 4months. There was no further opportunity for testing the presence of virus inhuman subjects.\n\nCOMMENT\n\nThroughout this period Dr. Francis enjoyed excellent working relationships with Board members, with practically all civilian workers in the field, and with his military counterparts, who respected him greatly not only for his skills as an epidemiologist but his ability as a clinician. He maintained a continuous interest in clinical affairs and was a fine physician. His reports always generously acknowledged the help of many individual contributors during the war years. Under his leadership, the Commission answered numerous questions that came to it from multiple sources.\n\nALERT FOR INFLUENZA\n\nWhile the vaccination program was under development, there were continuous efforts to become aware of early prevalence of influenza. The weekly incidence reports of respiratory diseases made it possible to note trends or sudden changes, but it was impossible to investigate all potential threats. Various members of the Commission, through their continued association with military posts in their respective areas, were able to obtain estimates of the character of current respiratory diseases. This was particularly true of Dr. Eaton in California, who was freely called upon by the Ninth Service Command. Similar responses by Michigan laboratory personnel involved repeated trips to Fort Custer, a large base in Michigan, where special examination of materials obtained from other areas was performed. Dr. Hirst also made repeated tests in civilians and at certain Army bases in the New York area. At the bases where vaccination studies were in progress, there were continuous efforts to identify the presence of influenza. Despite all these efforts during the last 6 months of 1941 and throughout 1942, there was no evidence of influenza A or B except for a few positive serum tests for influenza A found by Dr. Eaton at Camp Roberts, California, in February 1942.\n\nIn early 1943 influenza B was detected in Michigan in several civilian groups and at Fort Custer. At the Eloise Hospital, Eloise, Michigan, a study of vaccination was in progress and examination of sera suggested that an incidence of influenza B of nearly 20% of the complement had occurred among the 2,900 unvaccinated controls. In spite of this, clinical illness was infrequent, although two instances of influenza A were suggested by the serologic tests. There was widespread infection so mild that it was rarely detected clinically despite intensive efforts to record all cases of respiratory disease regardless of their character. Influenza B was again identified in May 1943.17\n\nInfluenza A was identified in Michigan and found to be of the same type as previously isolated from an outbreak among a group of interns in New York City in April. Influenza A was also identified at Fort Custer. These observations clearly demonstrated an important, previously unidentified fact regarding influenza, namely, the occurrence of widespread patchy distribution recognized only because of the constant support and vigilance of several diagnostic laboratories. Influenza A had previously been considered to be an epidemic disease of varying severity, but evidence of its sporadic, not epidemic, nature was established.\n\n169\n\nTo intensify the active alert, members of the Commission initiated a program of detection with the following assignments: Dr. Hirst and the Commission on Acute Respiratory Diseases, Second and Third Service Commands; Dr. Buddingh, Fourth Service Command; Dr. Francis and Dr. Salk, Sixth Service Command; Dr. Rickard, Sixth and much of the Seventh Service Command; Dr. Hale, Seventh Service Command; and Dr. Eaton, Ninth Service Command. From May to November 1943, no cases of influenza A were detected. In November, influenza A was detected in Michigan, Minneapolis, and St. Louis, Missouri, where other studies on influenza were in progress. Within a matter of days this information was transmitted to all other groups. The early identification of this epidemic was very helpful in evaluation of the effect of vaccine because all cases could be identified. In 1944, the sampling was augmented by Dr. Magill in the First and Second Service Commands and by Drs. Wood and Harford in the Seventh Service Command. No outbreaks of influenza A were detected up to the end of April 1945.\n\nThe effectiveness of the committee organized for the detection of influenza was well demonstrated during 1945. During the rest of that year members of the Commission or their affiliated units identified 16 outbreaks of influenza B of varying magnitude. Most of these episodes were small but some sharp outbreaks affected civilians as well as military personnel. Large numbers of cases were observed in Hawaii, and an outbreak of influenza B occurred in students at Yale University at the end of the year. It was reported by Dr. Blake and the virus identified by Dr. Hirst. Dr. Francis learned of overseas outbreaks on Tarawa, Guam, and Saipan. On Tarawa, it was said 83% of natives were affected, but there was little infection among caucasians.\n\nThe Commission members derived great satisfaction from visiting Army laboratories and observing efforts to acquire information quickly. In many instances, because of previous experience with Commission members, each visit was welcomed. It served to stimulate interest in the entire field of communicable diseases. Without these cooperative activities in spatial and temporal relationships, a long and drawn out incidence of influenza B of such mild and irregular distribution might have been overlooked. The Commission, through these procedures, maintained a broad picture of the patterns of illness and brought into perspective numerous isolated occurrences that formed a composite epidemiological picture. This enabled the Commission to advise the Army effectively and accurately as to the most desirable technical control measures. The experience seemed to reinforce the impracticality of waiting until an epidemic began to institute prophylactic vaccination. In nearly every instance mentioned in the report, the peak had been reached before the investigation succeeded in identifying the cause of the disease. The data obtained in the 1943 episode showed clearly that vaccination should be carried out before the virus made its appearance. As a result, data of great value were obtained.\n\nTHE COMMISSION - 1946 TO 1950\n\nContinuation of the Commissions\n\nWhen World War II ended, the question arose as to whether the AFEB would continue to function as it had during the war. Use of the Commission structure had been highly successful in field investigations of infectious diseases, and such activities continued to provide protection to the Armed Services against a variety of diseases. The Commissions had already made substantial progress in many areas. Furthermore, it was obvious that the demobilization of the Armed Services would by no means be complete and that the draft would continue for an indefinite period. In view of the uncertainty of the world situation, it was anticipated that a substantial number of recruits would enter military service during the coming years.\n\nResearch on influenza had progressed considerably toward achievement of the goals that the Commission had established. A number of experiences made it patently clear that many problems needed\n\n170\n\nconsiderable more study before solutions were reached. Commission members had taken part in a number of studies at military installations. Generally, they had learned how to work well with their colleagues in the Armed Services. A concern that the Commission system might be abolished prompted a decision by Dr. Francis to prepare a history of the Commission on Influenza during the World War II period. It was with considerable relief that Commission members learned that their activities would continue, at least for a while. Some of the most important lessons learned up to that time were that behavior of the influenza virus was extremely difficult to predict, many older notions had to be discarded, and new problems would appear almost every year. All of these potential problems would require study and solutions.\n\n1946 and 1947\n\nInfluenza B\n\nInfluenza B had not been detected since 1940 except in 1943 when a few scattered cases were encountered in Michigan. In 1945, however, the disease was identified as having caused outbreaks in practically all parts of the country as well as in Alaska and Australia. The alert system established earlier had functioned extremely well; laboratory data sufficient to identify the cause of the disease were obtained during most outbreaks. An extensive outbreak among civilians on Oahu, in the territory of Hawaii, led the Theater Surgeon to request aid from the Commission on Influenza. Captain Hirst and Dr. Francis left their posts on 27 June 1945 to investigate the outbreak. The number of civilians reported ill during that time was approximately 7,000. The number of admissions for respiratory disease in the Army totaled 2,600 between 1 June and 18 July. Vaccine had been administered to medical personnel, but the illness was so mild that there appeared to be no need for general vaccination. Drs. Francis and Hirst proceeded to Saipan and Guam where they found an increased incidence of respiratory infection identified by workers at NAMRU 2, on Guam, as influenza B. They subsequently obtained information that the Eighteenth Medical Laboratory on Okinawa had identified influenza B and also that it had information regarding another outbreak on Leyte, Philippine Islands. Dr. Salk visited Germany to establish diagnostic outposts in Army laboratories in the European theater.\n\nIn July 1945, Dr. Eaton identified influenza B in troops who became ill aboard a ship that had just arrived from the Pacific; a small local outbreak occurred in Stockton, California. Thereafter, in late August, outbreaks occurred at Fort Hood, Texas, Fort Dix, New Jersey, and at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. By November the illness was very widespread and was detected across the United States. Information from Australian workers indicated that this was the first time in their experience that influenza B was responsible for a large general epidemic.39 Thus, it was demonstrated that influenza B, which had behaved like an endemic disease, had attained epidemic characteristics and caused sharp epidemics in specialized segments of the population.\n\nInfluenza A\n\nInfluenza A was not noted during most of the time that influenza B was prevalent. However, there were scattered cases of influenza A detected in the Fourth Medical Laboratory; this supported the belief that influenza A had occurred in 1945 and suggested the possibility that the current cases were forerunners of a more extensive epidemic in autumn of 1946.\n\n171\n\nEffectiveness of Vaccine Against Epidemic Influenza B\n\nThere was no system similar to that which had been used in1943 available to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccine against influenza A. However, several observations were made that indicated that the influenza B component of the vaccine was effective, possibly more so than the A component. None of these observations was as well controlled as the 1943 study. At the University of Michigan, the comparison of the attack rates in a small number of vaccinated Army personnel compared with unvaccinated Navy students showed a hospitalization rate of 1.15 in the vaccinated Army group and 9.91 in the Navy group, which was unvaccinated. At Yale University in Army and Navy student training units, Dr. Blake requested that Dr. Hirst visit the infirmary on November 19. The situation there was slightly better controlled. All persons with temperature levels of 100?F or more who could not attend classes had to visit the infirmary. Vaccine coverage was good for Army personnel. Navy personnel were not vaccinated. Obviously, many people failed to report to sick call.\n\nDr. Orville Rogers at the Yale University Department of Health, with the aid of Dr. Frederick C. Robbins, attempted to separate the cases into the following categories: (a) Influenza with typical picture;(b)influenza complications, indicating typical influenza followed by some other disorder such as otitis media; (c) influenza, questionable; (d) URTI, upper respiratory tract infection non influenzal. In each of these groups there was a heavy preponderance of cases in the Navy group compared with Army personnel. The difference in rates was 16.9% in unvaccinated and 1.9% (vaccine efficacy 89%) in vaccinated subjects. This showed obvious protection afforded by the vaccine.40The study also pointed to the effectiveness of vaccine given before an epidemic occurred and the value of an \"alert system\" that was organized to provide information on the prevalence of influenza B throughout the general population. Also, it was shown that influenza B, as well as influenza A, could be prevented by use of inactivated vaccine. This experience provided more valuable data obtained by the cooperative work of the Commission on Influenza control program.\n\nStudies on Influenza Vaccines\n\nStability\n\nDr. Stanley studied the influence of various chemical agents on the stability of centrifuged vaccines.40 Vaccine at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, when held at pH 7.6 and 4?C, showed a marked loss in agglutinating activity. The virus had been formalinized, in different concentrations, with buffers at pH7.0 with no loss of titer at 4?C at 30 weeks. Virus treated with concentrations of Formalin of 1:640 and 1:570 also showed considerable loss of titer at 4?C.There was no loss at concentrations of 1:2000.\n\nDr. Salk showed that the stability of the virus in allantoic fluid exposed to temperatures between 56 and 65?C varied considerably from strain to strain. The Weiss strain (1943) was destroyed in 1.5 hours, the PR strain in 6 hours, whereas the B/Lee strain was stable for at least 10 hours but was destroyed in 24 to 36 hours.\n\nLaboratory Studies\n\nTests by Dr. Hirst showed that there was no difference between the antibody levels of persons who had been vaccinated with either Commission-provided vaccine or vaccine prepared by Sharples cen-\n\n172\n\ntrifugation at intervals of 2 weeks, 18 weeks, and 14 months after vaccination. Most vaccinees showed titers higher than their original level.41\n\nDr. Salk also compared the antibody levels at the end of the year of a group vaccinated with double-cycle centrifuged vaccine in amounts of0.1 mg to 2.0 mg and compared with eluate vaccine prepared in 1943.42The best results were obtained with the 2.0 mg material. The differences were evident when measured against B/Lee, but less distinct against the type A viruses. There was no evidence that centrifuged vaccine, because of its purity, was superior antigenically to the eluate material except when the doses were increased beyond a practical level.\n\nThe results of the two studies established the fact that there was no standardized method for measuring HI antibodies. Dr. Salk continued to determine the possibility of increasing the potency of influenza vaccine by absorption to calcium phosphate. When influenza virus was absorbed to calcium phosphate,Â there was an increase in titer 2 weeks after vaccination. No data were obtained on persistence of antibody 1 year after vaccination.\n\nProtective Effect of Vaccination in Swine\n\nDr. Beard and his associates continued to test the degree of immunity to induced infection after subcutaneous or intranasal vaccination of swine influenza virus in hogs.43 Those animals that received vaccine subcutaneously appeared somewhat more resistant than those that were unvaccinated. This effect was most marked in those vaccinated three times before infection. All vaccinated animals showed sharp antibody rises after the intranasal administration of active virus. Animals that had recovered from intranasal infection showed a more complete and uniform resistance than any of the vaccinated groups. Some animals were revaccinated after 13 weeks and then rechallenged a month later. One fourth of the animals showed mild clinical infection randomly distributed between vaccinated and revaccinated animals. There was no evidence that revaccination enhanced the resistance of the recovered animals, although a further antibody increase took place. Dr. Beard and his colleagues next investigated the effect of combined intranasal and subcutaneous vaccination. Subsequent exposure to intranasal virus did not cause typical infection.\n\nIt appeared that antibody titers had an inverse relationship to clinical response to infection. In general, the results did correspond with those obtained in ferrets, demonstrating that subcutaneous vaccine did not produce a consistent solid immunity to infection.\n\nIntranasal Vaccination in Humans and Ferrets\n\nDr. Francis and Dr. Joseph Quilligan investigated the effectiveness of an intranasal spray of inactivated vaccine on antibody response of children 8 to 12years of age.44 They found that a single spray produced a modest antibody response that was considerably increased when the spray was administered five times. After intranasal vaccination, the mean titer was less than one-half that following subcutaneous vaccination.\n\nIntranasal spraying of vaccine in ferrets uniformly produced antibodies in all animals. However, all were susceptible to both influenza A and B viruses despite the antibody production.\n\n173\n\nJONAS E. SALK, M.D.\n\nDr. Jonas Salk, a New Yorker, received his medical degree from New York University in 1939. This was followed by internship at the Sinai Hospital from 1940 to 1942. He was attracted to the University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, by Dr. Thomas Francis, where he progressed through the ranks between 1942 and 1947 as fellow, research fellow of epidemiology, to associate professor of epidemiology. Here, during the war years, he worked closely"
