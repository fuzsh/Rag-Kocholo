        "text": "The United States (or the U.S. for short) and Vietnam have always been different in many aspects, including culture and history, which directly affect the film industry of each country. While Hollywood has been the pride of the U.S. as the heart of the global cinema industry, Vietnamese cinema is far behind since the country suffers consecutive wars. As a result, these features lead to different portrayal of romantic relationship in Hollywood and Vietnamese romance films. However, it is impossible to compare Hollywood and Vietnamese on-screen romance without clarifying the contrasts between American and Vietnamese cultures that lead to on-screen contrasts. The word “culture” itself is already very complicated. Various researchers have defined it in different ways with numerous perspectives; therefore it is hardly able to point out exactly the distinctions between American and Vietnamese cultures. Recognizing the problem, this thesis proposes a solution by narrowing down the sphere of the word “culture” with theories from Geert Hofstede (1996) and Edward Hall (1977), two of the most well-known social psychologists in the world. Based on these concepts, the paper aims to build a firm basis to support further studying Hollywood and Vietnamese romantic films, thus finding the key contrasts of their on-screen romance. The sphere of research is limited among movies of the romance genre, which means movies of other genres such as horror, sci-fi or action are not included, even if they contain a romantic relationship in their plot. In short, the research aims to provide a creative approach to studying intercultural communication by analyzing films as a new form of mass media. Hopefully, the thesis will become an effective tool for those working in the fields of communication, culture, country or cinema, and an inspiration for those who are interested."
