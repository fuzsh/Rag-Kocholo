        "text": "Halle Maria Berry was born Maria Halle Berry on August 14, 1966 in Cleveland, Ohio and raised in Oakwood, Ohio to Judith Ann Berry (née Hawkins), a psychiatric nurse & Jerome Jesse Berry, a hospital attendant. Her father was African-American and her mother is of mostly English and German descent. Halle first came into the spotlight at seventeen years when she won the Miss Teen All-American Pageant, representing the state of Ohio in 1985 and, a year later in 1986, when she was the first runner-up in the Miss U.S.A. Pageant. After participating in the pageant, Halle became a model. It eventually led to her first weekly TV series, 1989's Living Dolls (1989), where she soon gained a reputation for her on-set tenacity, preferring to \"live\" her roles and remaining in character even when the cameras stopped rolling. It paid off though when she reportedly refused to bathe for several days before starting work on her role as a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991) because the role provided her big screen breakthrough. The following year, she was cast as Eddie Murphy's love interest in Boomerang (1992), one of the few times that Murphy was evenly matched on screen. In 1994, Berry gained a youthful following for her performance as sexy secretary \"Sharon Stone\" in Flintstones: Die Familie Feuerstein (1994). She next had a highly publicized starring role with Jessica Lange in the adoption drama Die andere Mutter (1995). Though the movie received mixed reviews, Berry didn't let that slow her down, and continued down her path to super-stardom.\n\nIn 1998, she received critical success when she starred as a street smart young woman who takes up with a struggling politician in Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998). The following year, she won even greater acclaim for her role as actress Dorothy Dandridge in made-for-cable's Die Geschichte der Dorothy Dandridge (1999), for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a TV Movie/Mini-Series. In 2000, she received box office success in X-Men (2000) in which she played \"Storm\", a mutant who has the ability to control the weather. In 2001, she starred in the thriller Passwort: Swordfish (2001), and became the first African-American to win Best Actress at the Academy Awards, for her role as a grieving mother in the drama Monster's Ball (2001).\n\nJulie Benz was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on May 1, 1972. Julie's father is a Pittsburgh surgeon and her mother is a figure skater. The family settled in nearby Murrysville, when Julie was two, and she started ice skating at age three. She competed in the 1988 U.S. Championships in junior ice dancing with her partner David Schilling, coming in 13th. Her older brother and sister, Jeffrey and Jennifer, were 1987 U.S. Junior Champions in ice dancing and competed internationally. When Julie was 14, she had a bad stress fracture and had to take time off.\n\nBy 1989, with her figure skating career over, Julie turned to acting and got involved in the local theater where she got a role in the play \"Street Law\". Her first movie role was a small credited speaking part in the Black Cat segment of the Dario Argento/George A. Romero co-direction horror flick, Two Evil Eyes (1990), playing in one scene alongside Harvey Keitel. A year later, she got a role on a TV show called Hi Honey, I'm Home (1991).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Julie entered New York University to study acting there. After graduation, Julie moved to Los Angeles to further pursue her career and landed some small roles in movies and TV shows including a guest appearance on Eine schrecklich nette Familie (1987) and in the Aaron Spelling TV pilot Crosstown Traffic (1995).\n\nIn 1996, Julie auditioned for the role of \"Buffy\" in the series Buffy - Im Bann der Dämonen (1997), but lost out to Sarah Michelle Gellar. However, she was offered a small role as a vampire girl in which she did such a good job that her part was expanded to a few more episodes in playing the vampire \"Darla\". With that, Julie Benz's career had finally taken off. She reprised her role as \"Darla\" in the Buffy spin-off series Angel: Jäger der Finsternis (1999) for two years and has had several small roles in various film productions. She also had a small, but memorable, role playing a receptionist in the movie Besser geht's nicht (1997).\n\nEven after her role on Angel: Jäger der Finsternis (1999) wrapped up, Julie continued to find work on television in playing many guest staring roles in numerous popular TV shows from CSI: Vegas (2000), to Supernatural: Zur Hölle mit dem Bösen (2005), to playing the lead and supporting roles in various made-for-TV movies. She landed another notable role on the TV-cable series Dexter (2006) playing \"Rita\", a troubled divorcée and lover of the title character played by Michael C. Hall. Benz played a leading role in the TV series My Superhero Family (2010) playing Stephanie Powell along with actors Michael Chiklis, Kay Panabaker, Jimmy Bennett, Autumn Reeser, Romany Malco, and Stephen Collins.\n\nIn 2013, she had the starring role in the sci-fi / fantasy breakout hit show Defiance (2013).\n\nNamed one of People Magazine's highly coveted 50 Most Beautiful, award nominated, Haitian-born actress Garcelle Beauvais immigrated to the United States at the age of seven with her mother and sisters and has since charmed audiences with her dramatic and comedic abilities. Balancing perfectly between the small screen and big screen, this cultural icon proudly became the first Black cast member on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" (2020). Cementing her status as a media queen, she released a memoir titled Love Me as I Am (Harper Collins) about life, love, and the pursuit of true happiness. It quickly rose in the ranks, landing in the #1 spot on Amazon and garnering a great deal of press attention including Good Morning America, Nightline, and PEOPLE Magazine. Most recently she expanded her empire to include a home line with HSN called \"Garcelle at Home.\" Garcelle has expanded her career with a Lifetime partnership to executive producer original titles, including most recently the award-winning film \"Black Girl Missing\" (2023) and it's second installment \"Abducted at an HBCU: A Black Girl Missing Movie\" (July 20, 2024) and \"Terry McMillan Presents: Tempted By Love\" (August 17, 2024).\n\nA look back at Garcelle's career shows a hybrid of businesswoman and mother who has been a cherished face in Hollywood for over three decades. She got her start in 90s comedies \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"The Jamie Foxx Show.\" She went on to appear in television on series such as SyFy's \"The Magicians,\" NBC's \"Chicago Med,\" \"NYPD Blue,\" \"Franklin & Bash,\" HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" \"Arrested Development,\" \"Power\" on Starz and many others. In addition to scripted TV, she co-hosted on Fox's daytime talk-show \"Hollywood Today Live,\" where she broke down the latest in entertainment, pop culture, and celebrity news, as well co-hosting for E!'s \"Fashion Police,\" and \"Access Hollywood Live\" on NBC. On the voiceover side of work, Garcelle was heard in HBO Max's \"The Prince\" with Gary Janetti. Recently, she wrapped her final season on the multi-award-winning talk show Fox's \"The Real\" as co-host.\n\nShe could also recently be seen in Netflix's \"Survival of the Thickest\" and Hulu's \"The Other Black Girl.\" Working in film has always been a passion for Garcelle. She has starred in box office hits \"White House Down\" with Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum as the First Lady of the United States, \"Flight\" with Denzel Washington, \"American Gun\" with Forrest Whitaker, \"Coming to America\" (1988), and the sequel \"Coming 2 America\" (2021) where she worked once again with Eddie Murphy, \"Bad Company\" with Chris Rock, \"Barbershop 2: Back in Business\" with Queen Latifah, and \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" with Tom Holland, among others.\n\nAbove all, Garcelle's most important job is being a mother. She was inspired by motherhood to write a children's book series entitled I AM, addressing identity issues relevant to many children today. There are three successful books in the series. The book series was re-released in April 2020 for its fifth anniversary. Garcelle is an ambassador for Cybersmile, a multi-award-winning nonprofit organization committed to digital well being and tackling all forms of bullying and abuse online and she also supports the Step Up Women's Network, a national non-profit that empowers women and girls to be strong and reach their full potential. She is also an active supporter of UNICEF and CORE, raising money for Haiti. Garcelle also supports the W.K. Kellogg Foundation \"Pockets of Hope\" campaign focused on the investment in locally led initiatives that are building a strong and equitable future for Haitian children, families and communities.\n\nShe resides in Los Angeles and has three sons; Oliver, her firstborn who has made her a proud grandmother and her twins, Jax and Jaid.\n\nChristine Baranski is an American actress from Buffalo, New York.

She is the daughter of Lorraine Davis, an actress turned drama therapist, and veteran character actor Paul Sorvino. Her father's family were Italian immigrants. The young Sorvino was intelligent, an avid reader and an exceptional scholar. Her father discouraged her from becoming an actor, as he knew how the industry often chews up young stars. She attended Harvard, majoring in Chinese, graduating magna cum laude in 1989, largely on the strength of her thesis, a Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on racial conflict in China, written and researched during the year spent in Beijing, which helped her fluency in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nHowever, she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age, and moved to New York City to try her hand in the City's film industry, waitressing, auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s, but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Unter Freunden (1993), on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film, and, more importantly, was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received, and Sorvino's performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies, one a more prominent indie, Barcelona (1994), the other her first Hollywood feature, Quiz Show (1994), and her skillful performances brought her yet more attention.\n\nAn exceptionally poised and articulate young woman, she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker, but Woody Allen took the chance, and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his Geliebte Aphrodite (1995) proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar (at the tender age of 29) for Best Supporting Actress. Since winning the Oscar, Sorvino has continued to take a wide range of roles, including another stretch as Marilyn Monroe in Marilyn - Ihr Leben (1996), co-starring with another very intelligent and skilled young actress, Ashley Judd. Forays into action and horror, such as Mimic - Angriff der Killerinsekten (1997) and The Replacement Killers - Die Ersatzkiller (1998) show that Sorvino is not above being playful in the film roles she chooses.\n\nHowever, what forever cemented her role in popular culture was her performance as charmingly silly California beach girl Romy White in Romy und Michele (1997), in which she and co-star Lisa Kudrow utter one hilarious absurdity after another.\n\nMira Sorvino married Christopher Backus on June 11, 2004, and the couple have four children.\n\nL.L. Cool J was born James Todd Smith in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, the son of Ondrea Griffith and James Louis Smith, Jr.\n\nTodd, as he was called, did not have a very happy childhood. At the age of four, he saw his mother and grandfather shot by his own father. After they recovered from their injuries, his mother began to date a young physical therapist she met while in the hospital. The therapist treated Ondrea kindly, but for years he abused Todd physically and verbally, which resulted in Todd becoming a bully himself. It was during this period that he started wearing hats all the time (one of L.L. Cool J's trademarks is the fact that people never see him without a hat on--until recently). Fortunately, Ondrea finally discovered what this man was doing to her son and left him.\n\nAs he grew older, Todd found a way to escape the effects of his abuse and his bullying attitude: hip-hop music. He fell in love with it at the age of nine, and by 11 he was writing lyrics and making his own songs with some DJ equipment his grandfather gave him. At 15, he and one of his best friends came up with his present stage name, L.L. Cool J, which means \"Ladies Love Cool James.\"\n\nIn 1984, when L.L. was 16, he met Rick Rubin, a student at NYU, who gave him his big break in music. Rick really liked L.L.'s music and decided to try to get him a record deal. Together, they made the single \"I Need a Beat\" and sent it to an artist manager named Russell Simmons. Simmons loved the single, and, in the same year, Rick and Russell co-founded the famous Def Jam Recordings; L.L.'s debut album, \"Radio,\" released in 1985, after securing a distribution deal for Def Jam with Columbia/CBS Records, was the label's first long-playing release. Even today, L.L. is considered one of Def Jam's most prized possessions.\n\n1985 was also the year L.L. started his acting career. He first appeared in Krush Groove (1985), which is a semi-biographical account of the early days of Def Jam Recordings. L.L. had a cameo appearance in the film. In 1986, L.L. also had a cameo appearance in the movie American Wildcats (1986) and also wrote that movie's theme song. After that, L.L. took a break from film and concentrated more on his first love: music. His career took off, and after every one of his albums hit platinum-selling status, he was (and still is) regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.\n\nAfter a few years, he had small roles in a few other films, but was still better known for his music. All this changed in 1995. By this time he was a happily married 27-year-old with three children. His first starring film, Out-of-Sync (1995), had also been released. It didn't do very well at the box office, but it got him noticed by executives at NBC-TV, who wanted to give him a part in a sitcom they were going to air. This sitcom was Ein schrecklich nettes Haus (1995), which showed L.L.'s acting ability; the show stayed on the air until 1999.\n\nHe had been offered several films roles during the run of the show and decided to accept a part in Halloween H20 - 20 Jahre später (1998). Its success resulted in L.L. being cast in bigger and better film roles, and he has acted alongside such stars as Whoopi Goldberg, Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Lee Curtis, James Woods, Al Pacino, Omar Epps, Pam Grier, Stanley Tucci, and Dennis Quaid, to name a few.\n\nIn 2000, he was finally rewarded for his acting talent. That year he won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for the best supporting actor in the action film Deep Blue Sea (1999). Even though his film career has taken off, he hasn't forgotten his love of hip-hop music. In 1998, he was planning to retire from hip-hop and just concentrate on his film career, but he later decided to keep dividing his time between both fields. L.L. is not only known as one of the greatest MCs of all time, but he is also known as a great actor.\n\nSince starring in his first film, Fieber im Blut (1961), Warren Beatty has been said to have demonstrated a greater longevity in movies than any actor of his generation. Few people have taken so many responsibilities for all phases of the production of films as producer, director, writer, and actor, and few have evidenced so high a level of integrity in a body of work.\n\nIn Regeln spielen keine Rolle (2016), he writes, produces, directs and stars in. Only Beatty and Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) have been nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as an actor, a director, a writer, and a producer for the same film. Beatty is the only person ever to have done it twice, for Der Himmel soll warten (1978) and again for Ein Mann kämpft für Gerechtigkeit (1981). Beatty has been nominated 15 times by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, and 8 films he has produced have earned 53 Academy nominations. In 1982 he won the Academy Award for Directing and in 2000 was given the Academy's highest honor, the Irving G. Thalberg Award.\n\nHe was awarded Best Director from the Directors Guild of America and Best Writer three times from the Writers Guild of America. He has received the Milestone Award from the Producers Guild, the Board of Governors Award from the American Society of Cinematographers, the Directors Award from the Costume Designers Guild, the Life Achievement Award from the Publicists Guild, and the Outstanding Contribution to Cinematic Imagery Award from the Art Directors Guild. The National Association of Theater Owners has honored him as Director of the Year, as Producer of the Year and as Actor of the Year.\n\nHe has won 16 awards from the New York and Los Angeles Film Critics, the National Board of Review, and the Golden Globes. In 1992, he was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in France; in Italy he received the David di Donatello award in 1968 and again in 1981 and its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998; in 2001, he received the Donostia Lifetime Achievement Award from the San Sebastian International Film Festival; in 2002, he received the British Academy Fellowship from BAFTA; and in 2011, he was awarded the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.\n\nIn December 2004, Beatty received The Kennedy Center Honor in Washington, D.C. In addition, he is the recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, the HFPA Cecile B. DeMille Award and many others. Politically active since the 1960's, Beatty campaigned with Robert F. Kennedy in his 1968 presidential campaign. That same year he traveled throughout the United States speaking in favor of gun control and against the war in Vietnam. In 1972 he took a year off from motion pictures to campaign with George McGovern.\n\nIn 1981, Beatty was a founding board member of the Center for National Policy. He is a founding member of The Progressive Majority, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has participated in the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland.\n\nBeatty serves on the Board of Directors of the Motion Picture and Television Fund Foundation. He previously served on the Board of Trustees of The Scripps Research Institute for several years. He has received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award from the Americans for Democratic Action, the Brennan Legacy Award from the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, and the Philip Burton Public Service Award from The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.\n\nIn multiple forums he has addressed campaign finance reform, the increasing disparity of wealth, universal health care and the need for the Democratic Party to return to its roots.\n\nIn March of 2013, he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.\n\nBeatty was born in Richmond, Virginia. He and his wife, Annette Bening, live in Los Angeles and have four children.\n\nHis mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and his father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia. His sister is actress Shirley MacLaine (born Shirley MacLean Beaty). His ancestry is mostly English and Scottish."
