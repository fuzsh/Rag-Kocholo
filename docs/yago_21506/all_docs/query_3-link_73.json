        "text": "MICHEL MARTIN, host:\n\nI'm Michel Martin, and this is Tell Me More from NPR News. Coming up, a sampling of essays about democracy and politics from our listeners. It's a special edition of This I Believe with a conversation with curator Jay Ellison.\n\nBut first, maybe you're just back from voting. Maybe you're tired from standing in line. Maybe you're not quite ready to let go of all the election excitement, or reality is just too much to take. Why not pop in a DVD and watch a political movie? Some are satirical. Some are deadly serious, but they all offer some window into the political process.\n\nHere to talk about his all-time favorite is Fox Television film critic Shawn Edwards. Shawn is also the cofounder of the African-American Film Critic Society. Welcome back, Shawn. Nice to talk to you.\n\nMr. SHAWN EDWARDS (Film Critic, Fox Television): Hey, thanks a lot. It's always a pleasure.\n\nMARTIN: Now, you gave us a list of your top choices. I'm going to build up anticipation and start in reverse order. What is number four on your list?\n\nMr. EDWARDS: One of my all-time favorite political movies is a movie that was released in 1998 called \"Bulworth.\" I thought it was very relevant because the main character is a guy who's actually running for the president of the United States. And I think he does the one thing that every citizen wishes that every politician would do.\n\nMARTIN: Which is?\n\nMr. EDWARDS: Straight up tell the truth.\n\nMARTIN: Now, of course, he's having a nervous breakdown in this movie. I should mention, it stars Warren Beatty and the then-relatively-unknown Halle Berry. I'm going to play a short clip. Now, those who saw the film, I think this is one of those scenes that you will remember. Here it is.\n\n(Soundbite of movie \"Bulworth\")\n\nUnidentified Woman: Are you saying the Democratic Party don't care about the African-American community?\n\nMr. WARREN BEATTY: (As Bulworth) Isn't that obvious? You got half of your kids out of work, and the other half are in jail. Do you see any Democrat doing anything about it? So what're you going to do, vote Republican? I mean, come on! You can have a Billion Man March! If you don't put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife, you're never going to get rid of somebody like me!\n\nMARTIN: Ouch!\n\nMr. EDWARDS: Yes.\n\nMARTIN: Why did you pick this one?\n\nMr. EDWARDS: I like it because it's sort of a contemporary film. It was released in 1998, which is pre-9/11. So the landscape is sort of before the things that happened on September 11, 2001, which totally changed the tone of political movies being released by Hollywood.\n\nMARTIN: OK. Let's go to number three.\n\nMr. EDWARDS: The classic, \"Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,\" which was released in 1939. And I think a lot of people consider this movie great. And I do as well because Mr. Smith is this everyday guy who goes to Washington with the hopes that he can change a corrupt governmental system.\n\nAnd I think a lot of the reason why the film is so enduring is because of, you know, Jimmy Stewart's great performance. I mean, let's not forget about that. I mean, I think a lot of people could see themselves as Jimmy Stewart because that performance was just so overwhelmingly fantastic.\n\nBut I think people, even though they may be a little more cynical today, I think, in the back of their minds, they still think that, as an American, as a participant in our political system, that we still have the power if we want to go in and make a change. Whether we're running for, you know, student council president, for the city council, for the Senate, or for the presidency, I think we all have the hopes that people will listen to us, and we have the power to create change.\n\nMARTIN: Now, next film on your list is one that I'm just not that familiar with. It's called \"V For Vendetta.\" Tell me about it.\n\nMr. EDWARDS: Number one, I like it just because, I mean, I think it's one of the best movies made in the past 10 years. It's based on a graphic novel, and it deals with the issue that a lot of people have been struggling with recently, and that's the issue of terrorism. In fact, Hollywood's released several movies that have been, you know, based on terrorism. This is one of the few movies based on terrorism that was actually pretty successful, and it deals with the whole idea of taking a symbol and crushing that symbol to create change.\n\nMARTIN: As I understand, the character V is played by Hugo Weaving, and then, in this clip that we're going to play, he's talking to Natalie Portman, who plays a character called Evey. Let's listen.\n\n(Soundbite of movie \"V For Vendetta\")\n\nMr. HUGO WEAVING: (As V) People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.\n\nMs. NATALIE PORTMAN: (As Evey) And you're going to make that happen by blowing up a building?\n\nMr. WEAVING (As V): The building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. Alone, a symbol is meaningless. But with enough people, blowing up a building can change the world.\n\nMARTIN: Now, you were saying that this was one of the few films post-9/11 that addressed some of the issues raised by 9/11 that was actually successful. Why do you think that is?\n\nMr. EDWARDS: I think one of the reasons this movie was successful compared to some of the others because, I think, the other movies Hollywood has released have been too realistic, too serious. This was also better than a lot of the movies that Hollywood has released about terrorism, was another reason I gave it credit for being successful.\n\nIt's a well-made movie that's sort of fictional, that really doesn't directly deal with the themes of 9/11, but sort of addresses them symbolically. A lot of the other movies sort of like tackle 9/11 head-on, and I don't think the general public's ready to actually deal with those issues just yet.\n\nMARTIN: And finally, your number one. What's your number one?\n\nMr. EDWARDS: Number one, by a wide margin, and it's \"All the President's Men,\" released in 1976, which stars Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, and Jason Robards, who actually won an Academy Award for his performance in this movie that deals with two reporters who work for the Washington Post. And they actually are working on a story that involves the Watergate incident. They began in like the early '70s and actually ended up forcing President Richard Nixon to resign.\n\nMARTIN: And for the little newbies among us, this is actually not fiction.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMARTIN: I mean, for people...\n\nMr. EDWARDS: No.\n\nMARTIN: Some people don't know this. This is not fiction.\n\nMr. EDWARDS: No, this is totally nonfiction.\n\nMARTIN: There may be some other characters in the film or might be composite characters of people in real-life. But the reality is, Robert Redford plays Bob Woodward. Jason Robards plays Ben Bradlee, and, you know, there's a Carl Bernstein character. Let me play a short clip, and then you can tell us what it is that you liked about the film, and why it's your top pick.\n\n(Soundbite of movie \"All the President's Men\")\n\nMr. JASON ROBARDS: (As Ben Bradlee) Did Deep Throat say that people's lives are in danger?\n\nMr. DUSTIN HOFFMAN: (As Carl Bernstein) Yes.\n\nMr. ROBARDS: (As Ben Bradlee) What else did he say?\n\nMr. HOFFMAN: (As Carl Bernstein) He said everyone is involved.\n\nMr. ROBARDS: (As Ben Bradlee) You know the results of the latest Gallup Poll? Half the country never even heard of the word Watergate. Nobody gives a...\n\nMARTIN: And, of course, I think that this is on a lot of reporters' lists of top picks of all time because it harkens back to a more innocent time when people actually liked reporters or thought they did a good job. But what - why is this your top pick?\n\nMr. EDWARDS: It's my top pick because it took a complicated subject matter, in dealing with the Watergate incident, and they very cleverly and very realistically were able to turn it into a two-hour movie, which is very difficult to do.\n\nI have to be honest. I am a bit biased because I got my start working in a newspaper, so I used to be a journalist, a print journalist as well. So, the realism of the newsroom, the realism of the editors and the reporters, and the process that it takes to uncover facts, to develop sources to, you know, tap into a story and dig into all the information you need to turn this into a credible news story that changes the course of a country and totally redirects history is so fascinating in this movie. And most of all, the movie totally holds up over time. It's just a great work of film.\n\nMARTIN: Now, I know that people are going to want to argue with you. No \"Manchurian Candidate,\" no \"Dave,\" no \"W.\"\n\nMr. EDWARDS: The four films that we talked about represent different genres. You know, I wanted to give a satire. I wanted to give a movie that dealt with terrorism. I wanted to give an example of a movie pre-9/11, post-9/11. And then we had to talk about one of the older classics, which is represented by \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\" Because there are a lot of great political films that - you know, don't let this list sway you. There are a lot of good movies. This is a starting point.\n\nMARTIN: All right. Shawn Edwards is a film critic for Fox Television in Kansas City, Missouri. He joined us from Member Station KCUR in Kansas City. What about you? Agree with Shawn's top picks, or is he all wet? You can let us know.
