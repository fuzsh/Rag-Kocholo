        "text": "You have to hand it to Warren Beatty, he redefines the term \"maverick\". He could be, like many of his contemporaries, taking it easy. Instead, \"Bullworth\". One of the most outrageously funny satires I've seen in a long time. Satire? Somebody asked me. Well yes, satire. A realistic, daring, clearheaded, masterful satire. We live in satirical times, we have no choice in the matter. It takes an artist of Beatty's caliber to turns things around and makes us laugh and shiver at this mess of our own making. After seeing \"Bullworth\" I felt compelled to revisit some of Beatty's earlier work as an actor or producer or director. From \"Mickey One\" to \"Reds\" passing through \"Bonnie And Clyde\" and \"Shampoo\" not to mention \"Heaven Can Wait\" Mr. Beatty's legacy is one of amazing consistency. As I smiled enjoying his funny portrayal in \"The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone\" with Vivien Leigh, I thought: that beautiful man is not just a pretty face.\n\nI cannot recommend 'Bulworth' highly enough. Sure, I've seen lots of worthy political satires. 'The Candidate', 'Wag the Dog', 'Bob Roberts', and others. But this is the finest example ever made. Warren Beatty should be very proud of this masterpiece. Not only for the guts it took to so brazenly confront the modern political process (and how it affects race relations, the film industry, education, medicine, and so on) but also for the fact that he wrote it, produced it, directed it, and starred in it. Any one of those jobs can be a supreme undertaking, and here he has accomplished all four with integrity, wit, humor, intelligence, and undeniable brass. It is quite simply impossible to watch this movie without being repeatedly shocked at the depth of its honesty. The supporting cast is also excellent, and Don Cheadle stands out as LD.\n\nFor years, it seemed like Warren Beatty was trying too hard to play handsome young men, despite his age. \"Bulworth\" totally vindicated him. He plays the title character, a right-wing senator who has a breakdown and starts singing rap songs that tell the truth about politics and the status of the black community. I mean the whole, unvarnished truth. Specifically, he calls for socialism.\n\nYou say that a 60-ish white guy can't don a ghetto suit and sing rap songs? Maybe it sounds a little strange coming from him, but the truth's gotta come from somewhere. And that TV interview? A truly classic piece of cinema. I guess that this sort of thing could only come from Warren Beatty (most recently, he and Rob Reiner successfully encouraged California's voters to reject Arnold Schwarzenegger's proposals).\n\nAll in all, \"Bulworth\" is a great movie. I just wish that this could happen with a real-life politician. Also starring Halle Berry, Sean Astin, Don Cheadle, Oliver Platt, Laurie Metcalf, Jack Warden, Paul Sorvino and Christine Baranski. Perfect."
