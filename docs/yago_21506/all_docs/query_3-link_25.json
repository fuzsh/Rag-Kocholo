        "text": "For months it was known as ''The Untitled Warren Beatty Project.'' Then it was known as ''Untitled Bullworth.'' Now it's just ''The Untitled. . .''\n\nWhatever the title, Mr. Beatty, the movie star and director, has completed filming, amid military-style secrecy, a new film at 20th Century Fox that will probably be released early next year. Mr. Beatty is hardly alone in his quest for secrecy and control in making a film. Look at Woody Allen, Stanley Kubrick, Barbra Streisand and others.\n\nBut what has attracted more attention to the new Beatty film is that it was written, directed and produced by the star, who also plays the lead role. Mr. Beatty (above) won an Academy Award as best director for the 1981 movie ''Reds,'' in which he also starred, produced and co-scripted.\n\nBy all accounts, the new film is a contemporary political comedy about a Senator named Jay Bullworth, who is unraveling and fed up with the system. He finds his way to a church in a ghetto in Los Angeles. As he begins speaking to the congregation, his life takes unexpected turns. The cast includes Halle Berry, Paul Sorvino, Oliver Platt, Jack Warden and Don Cheadle. (Mr. Beatty has been involved in politics for years, mostly in the Democratic Party.)\n\nFox executives expect the film to be called ''Bullworth,'' although they are waiting for Mr. Beatty's approval on that title. They are also waiting for Mr. Beatty to deliver the final version of the movie, which some Fox executives hope to release in December, in time to make it eligible for this year's Academy Awards. A release next year, however, appears more likely.\n\nThe film was part of a deal Mr. Beatty made with Barry Diller, former chairman of Fox Inc., when Mr. Diller ran the studio in the late 1980's and early 90's. As a result, the current management of Fox had no choice but to make it. The film is not especially expensive by Hollywood studio terms -- about $30 million, one executive said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
