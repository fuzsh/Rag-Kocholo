        "text": "Bulworth\n\nWarren Beatty / US, 1998 / 108 min.\n\nSurprisingly sharp political comedy by and with Warren Beatty, who bitingly satirises the American election circus. Senator Bulworth decides that from now on, he’s going to speak straight from the heart – as a rapper. Much to the dismay of his spin doctors. Chosen by Albert Serra.\n\nIn Bulworth, Warren Beatty, the renowned New Hollywood icon (Shampoo, The Parallax View, Bonnie and Clyde), provides a biting satire on the devolution of American politics.\n\nBulworth was Beatty’s fourth film as a director. It was released the same year as Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, two other political comedies, yet was almost instantly forgotten even though two absolute legends worked on it, film composer Ennio Morricone and director of photography Vittorio Storaro.\n\nScreening of a 35mm copy from Eye’s collection.\n\nThis is part of\n\nDetails\n\nThis movie contains scenes with alcohol and/or drug usePersons under 12 years must be accompanied by an adultThis movie contains foul language\n\nDirector\n\nWarren Beatty\n\nProduction year\n\n1998\n\nCountry\n\nUS\n\nOriginal title\n\nBulworth\n\nLength\n\n108 min.\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\nSubtitles\n\nNONE\n\nFormat\n\n35mm\n\nPart of\n\nAlbert Serra\n\nEye Filmmuseum presents the first exhibition in the Netherlands about the work of Catalan film and theatre director Albert Serra. Transforming the entire exhibition space into an immersive stage, Serra orchestrates nocturnal and clandestine encounters where theatre, cinema, and art converge.\n\nLearn more\n\nWhy in Eye\n\nIn his political satire Beatty makes fun of everyone and everything, yet primarily his ‘own’ Democratic Party. Bulworth sometimes loses the plot, but has lost nothing of its contemporaneity. Straight-talking fiction films like this are hardly made anymore.\n\nThijs Havens\n\nProgrammer Eye Filmmuseum\n\nPlanning on having a drink or a bite to eat?
