        "text": "Don't bother writing a political movie! At least for the moment.\n\nHollywood has never been too welcoming of films about politics, but the recent box-office disappointments, ''Primary Colors,'' directed by Mike Nichols and starring John Travolta (above), and ''Bulworth,'' directed by and starring Warren Beatty, have made similar projects even more dicey.\n\nBoth films were critically acclaimed. ''Bulworth,'' a farce about a California Senate candidate (Mr. Beatty) in the grip of a nervous breakdown, who speaks bluntly about race, class, the power of money and just about everything else, was, by all accounts, one of the more provocative films of the star's 30-year career. ''Primary Colors,'' based on the novel by Joe Klein about a Southern Governor who resembles Bill Clinton, earned some of the strongest reviews of the year and was termed one of Mr. Nichols's best.\n\nIn addition, the two movies generated an extraordinary number of magazine covers, television interviews and newspaper stories. Mr. Beatty, who was also co-writer and co-producer of the film, appeared on everything from the Sunday morning talk shows to Howard Stern.\n\nBut neither film stirred enthusiasm at the box office. ''Bulworth,'' made by Fox Filmed Entertainment, grossed about $24 million, while Universal's ''Primary Colors,'' which cost about $64 million, has grossed less than $40 million.\n\nStudio executives say they are proud of the films. And they blame the public's dislike of politics and politicians for the lackluster box-office performance. As one person involved in ''Primary Colors'' said: ''The day before the film opened, I went to the dentist, and the hygienist said to me: 'I'm so sick of politicians. I don't even care if it's John Travolta playing a politician. I don't want to see that movie.' And that's what hurt the movie -- this distaste for politicians.''\n\nProducers here say the airwaves are so glutted with politics and scandal that making a movie about a President or Senator in trouble seems redundant. Worse, it seems unentertaining. Audiences hear enough bad news about politicians on television; who wants to pay for it?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
