        "text": "Warren Beatty is usually right on target with politics. His 1981 Epic REDS is a stone-cold masterpiece. A classic film that he wrote, directed, produced, and starred about the communist party. But in Bulworth he misses the target. Bulworth could possibly have been a combination of REDS and HEAVEN CAN WAIT, another classic film and brilliant comedy he did quadruple duty on in 1978. Beatty brought it all home with those two efforts and in Bulworth his aim was high, his effort grand but the arrow just didn’t get to the bullseye this time. Warren Beatty is knowing in his political comprehension and sharp and wise with his political discourse. That’s why when his 1998 effort steeped in the world of an American political campaign Bulworth fell short, I was surprised and disappointed. Not that he didn’t make it very entertaining. However, the movie falls short in its story, political aspiration, its ability to make us laugh and in its hopeful take on race relations and the significance of Black Americans place in their country both socially and politically. At least he tried and not too many filmmakers can say that. His effort and intent were noble, but Bulworth doesn’t grasp several matters as tight as it could have. The movie’s story structure was also a hinderance as his screenplay is a meandering one. Bulworth being shuffled from here to there in real time with not a really strong and clear-cut storyline or place for the audience to be grounded in. As soon as a relationship develops, or something becomes interesting we’re off again as Bulworth is back on the chase going from stop to stop essentially just getting ran through the ringer. Most disappointing was the films both sides do it narrative that Democrats and Republicans are really just the same and the need for a third-party candidate who says wild things and tells the truth. But whos’ truth? The truth is very much in dispute. A third party doesn’t magically change that. The character of Bulworth used to be a staunch conservative and is now running on a Democratic ticket. He’s described in the film as an old conservative wine in a new liberal bottle. The black people in Bulworth are there to provide the fish out of water element and the comedy relief and the seriousness of black issues like poverty, drugs, gangs, and crime. As Bulworth begins turning into a black man and rapping his campaign speeches. The movie gets tied down in a forced romantic element as Beatty’s vein nature, once known as “Warren Beauty” can’t seem to help but making himself the object of desire as he is a legendary ladies’ man if not a habitual philanderer. His object of desire this time is the stunning Halle Berry. They have some chemistry and one good scene of dialogue about their situation but there’s no there, there. In various bits the movie is simply bizarre. Bulworth and his handlers end up at a black night club in the inner-city smoking marijuana, dancing to hip hop, spinning 45’s and eating spareribs in a sequence that’s seems to go on forever. The black people in the club seem to be from another planet sometimes. With a gang of bald-headed black men in black leather trench coats running around like rejects from The Matrix. Many of the white political characters are highly cliched and nothing we haven’t seen before. Cops pull Bulworth over and threaten to kill him now that he’s wearing his hip hop gear and bouncing through The Ghetto with a black child. There’s an old joke and canard about Jews in the media and in Hollywood. Bulworth pulls out the old “white people have more in common with black people than they do with poor people.” Line. I have never understood what that meant or why people feel the need to still say it or all the other many variations of it. The movie’s cynicism pulls down whatever little optimism it has. The farcical element to the entire story about a white guy speaking through black man and is also being chased around by a hitman he’s trying to stop ultimately stands in the way of a better movie with a more stable grip on the issues it is trying to feature and how to better express them. Frankly I didn’t care about Bulworth at all really didn’t care whether Bulworth was killed or not. If Beatty had just wrote the Bulworth character as a black man, he could have cut out the need for a clunky white male translator. A black conservative trying to reach Black Democratic voters or even vice versa might have made more sense and still kept the comedy elements and given the movie a chance to go where Beatty seemed to want it to go but didn’t. My advice would have been for Beatty to rewrite the script and just direct the film while casting Denzel Washington to star as Bulworth, a black conservative senator trying to swing black voters in the inner city. We may have gotten down more to some political and social issues then as well. I’m glad Beatty cares about all of these issues and he jumped high as he always does, warren beautifully, he just didn’t stick the landing this time. It’s all certainly still better and more realistic than watching Cornell West fumbling around like a buffoon as he pretends to run for President today."
