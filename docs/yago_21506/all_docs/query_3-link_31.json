        "text": "Beatty was never very productive, and even in his peak years during the seventies he only did seven films. His dithering over projects only got worse as he got older, so he was never going to let himself be rediscovered by audiences. Even Redford did a Marvel movie, so it could have happened.\n\nIn comparison, his sister never really left the public eye. In Her Shoes and Bernie weren’t classics, but they were at least something (both have strangely devoted followings, which I don’t quite understand even though I like both films). And even though no one liked her on Downton Abbey, it was still a star turn on a popular show,\n\nHe had a pretty damn good run especially considering he took about 10 years to shit out a film. And had total control of them and well after his box office ran out studios were still giving him carte Blanche to write/direct/star in movies well into his 60s.\n\nBulworth was (mostly) great but flopped. Town and Country killed his career.\n\nAgree with R17 and R24. Beatty's star days were far before my time, but judging from his big movies that I have actually watched - his acting is about akin to watching bargain basement, \"ceiling white\" paint dry. You can of course be a bad actor but still have both charm and sex appeal that translates on screen (many leading men through the decades fit this category). He was very handsome for sure but had none of the above. Literally nothing. Ryan O'Neal for instance was a lousy actor, but he was very charming. Just my opinion.\n\nCan't tell whether OP is deliberately trolling, as seems likely. Beatty's has had one of the great Hollywood careers of all time - he is a legend and icon through and through, and all this despite modest talents (apart from physically). Who, post-age 60 in Hollywood had the same success as when they were in their prime?\n\nWe could literally play this stupid game with anyone at any time. After \"Fat Man and Little Boy\" - \"Why did Paul Newman's career Go Right Down the Shitter?\" After \"Mona Lisa Smile\" - \"Why did Julia Roberts' career go Right Down the Shitter?\" After \"Random Hearts\" - \"Why did Harrison Ford's Career go Right Down the Shitter?\" Yawn."
