        "text": "One of the least fun things about life under the Trump Administration is that everything that happens in culture — TV, music, movies, sports — inevitably gets interpreted through the lens of Trump. What does this new TV series say about the President? How does this Oscar contender speak to the times we live in? Which athlete is Trump arguing with on Twitter today? It can be incredibly tiresome.\n\nAnd yet: it is virtually impossible to watch the 1998 Warren Beatty film Bulworth — which hit American theaters 20 years ago today — and not think of Trump at least a little. The film is a Clinton-era fantasia about what would happen if a suicidal politician shrugged off all his paid donors and spoke harsh, unvarnished truths, often about race in America. It is a film exceedingly of its time, back when we thought that dishonesty and grift in politics was the only thing holding us back. Back when The American President told us that the only thing tying up our most idealistic of public servants was an unwillingness to tell their conservative rivals exactly where to stick their hypocritical family values. Bill Clinton was always such a slickster, even to his supporters, that it wasn’t hard to get behind a vision that said that if only politicians were more honest with the American public, we might like them a little better.\n\nBulworth took that vision to its farthest reaches. Warren Beatty — who directed and co-wrote the film — stars as Jay Bulworth, Democratic Senator from California, running for re-election once again in a fairly anemic campaign. Depressed with the knowledge that his own Kennedy-era idealism had jaundiced into a more centrist, Welfare-reform neo-liberalism, with an emotionally estranged wife and a brand of politics that is shamelessly open to the highest bidder, Bulworth decides to kill himself. He takes out a $10 million insurance policy and arranges for an assassin to kill him some time over the weekend. But then, in case you were worried this was a 10-minute short film of a successful suicide-by-contract, a funny thing happens. When he resumes campaigning, freed from any concerns about reelection or satisfying donors, Bulworth begins to speak the truth, which mostly adds up to “We politicians are in the pocket of those who finance our campaigns, and that’s not you, poor black communities.” The honesty is a shock to the system; a Democrat telling black audiences that Democrats don’t care about them. The media goes nuts. Jay Bulworth becomes a national sensation, just for telling the truth; and his popularity starts to skyrocket.\n\nBulworth is not really so simple as that synopsis above. It’s a messy movie that bogs itself down with a too-complicated assassination plot and too many cutaways to Bulworth’s coked-out campaign manager (Oliver Platt, playing his role like he got the note that his character is actually shoving rocket fuel up his nose). But it’s not just the structural imperfections that make Bulworth stand out in 2018. Back in 1998, the film was received as a bold statement, with Beatty lashing out at a broken system by playing a character who crossed all sorts of PC lines by affecting black mannerism and “rapping” on the campaign trail. Jay Bulworth was outré, but he was also speaking startling truths in a way that would be a welcome shock to the system if they were happening in real life.\n\nIn 2018, though, we’ve seen what happens when a political candidate tosses aside the usual political script and speaks bluntly to the American people. You’d be hard-pressed to call Donald Trump “honest” with a straight face, but what he does possess, now and during his campaign, is a brand of reality-TV-ready overtness. It’s the “keeping it real” principle, where if you tell people to their face all the awful things you’d normally say behind closed doors, it gives the air of honesty. Donald Trump is “honest” because he doesn’t pull punches when discussing his enemies. He’s “honest” because he doesn’t filter his tweets. Bulworth’s assertion that the Democratic party does not care to help black people sounds very similar to statements that Trump made in his campaign and Kanye West has been making in recent weeks. Is Donald Trump the 2010s version of Jay Bulworth? (Is Kanye his Halle Berry?) Sure. But in a way that exposes Jay Bulworth as a naive fantasy.\n\nIt goes back to the idea that if politicians would just be honest with us, everything would be okay. And not just okay, but everything would be better and (particularly in Beatty’s vision) more progressive. With the truth of Washington’s grift off of his chest, Bulworth is free to speak freely, which leads to him connecting to the black community — pretty much instantaneously, which plays as pretty insulting in hindsight, that this cadre of black women start following him the second he starts going off book and “rapping” — which leads him to speaking the truth about the black community’s struggles during a nationally televised debate.\n\nThere’s some white-savior stuff at play here for sure, though there’s an attempt to temper that with Halle Berry’s character, an ambivalent observer who’s shadowing Bulworth, seemingly to act as a check on him at all times. Her approval (“You crazy, Jay Bulworth”) gives the audience permission to approve too, and her character’s fierce intelligence covers the movie’s ass against charges that it’s not letting the black characters speak for themselves. But those moments end up getting undercut as well. Berry will deliver a (heavily post-dubbed) monologue about black struggle, only to have her character cut off at the knees by sinking her into the dumb assassination plot.\n\nBut where Bulworth comes across as most naive, though, is in its failure to recognize that the collapse of politics as we know it wouldn’t automatically birth a new and progressive political future. In his three-and-a-half star review of the film, Rogert Ebert opined, “You realize that if all politicians were as outspoken as Bulworth, the fragile structure of our system would collapse, and we would have to start all over again.” But if Donald Trump has taught us anything is that radical honesty (“honesty”) in politicians hasn’t led down the path to our best selves. It’s led to reactionary, backwards-looking pleas to go back to a time not when politicians were more honest but when we didn’t notice the dishonesty.\n\nBulworth is not a cynical movie. It’s actually an incredibly optimistic one. Brush away all the bombast and old-white-man rapping and self-consciously outrageous statements about Johnnie Cochran and malt liquor and you find a movie that is essentially saying that we’d all be a lot better off if we started speaking the same language. Is Bulworth a patronizing movie? Yeah, a little. Warren Beatty as the pied piper of millinnium-era black activism is … not a super great look. But more than anything, with 20 years of hindsight at the ready, Bulworth feels like a naive movie. One which assumed, as most of us did, that sunshine would be the best disinfectant for our crudded-up political system. But it’s May of 2018, and the sun shines brightly on month 16 of the Trump presidency. And unfiltered political candidate did indeed shock the public into voting for him, just not at all in the way we (and Warren Beatty) thought."
