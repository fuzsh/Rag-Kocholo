        "text": "“Bulworth” is a serious movie with some truth included in the offbeat plot. However, to get to the meat of the movie you have to watch it, an experience much like diving for coins in a cess pool. After I left I felt slimed. However, many people who viewed it when I did cheered and applauded at the end.\n\nJ. Billington Bullworth is a Senator from California running for re-election. Near the end of the campaign he goes for days without sleep and food ending up mentally so deranged that he gets a large insurance company to issue a policy to him for $10 million dollars for bottling up a bill in his senate committee that the insurance company doesn’t want passed. Next he sets up a hit on himself as a way of committing suicide.\n\nNow, he feels free to express himself honestly for the first time and does so at several churches, one black, one white, at a meeting of rich Hollywood jews, on national TV and generally alienates everyone, except Halie Berry, who ends up as a sidekick in the movie.\n\nThis is really Warren Beatty’s political statement, and he uses “Bullworth” to make his points, such as:\n\nSocialism is not a dirty word\n\nthe United States Constitution is outdated and ineffective\n\nHollywood makes a lot of money but a very poor product\n\nblacks are only important in the American political process to the extent that racism can be used as a political tool\n\nthe rich get richer and the poor get poorer\n\nthere are no black leaders today because middle class jobs have been shipped off shore to 3rd world countries\n\nthe only opportunity young black men in our culture have is to be a business man—and sell drugs on the street\n\nthe media only cares about ratings, not truth.\n\nBeatty is socialist and uses this movie, which he co-produced, directed as well as starred in, to further his socialist agenda begun in his previous movie, “Reds”.\n\nI would like to ask Mr. Beatty a question. Is his portrayal of blacks in this movie what he really believes black people to be like? And I have a question for blacks. Do they appreciate how demeaning, how sick and nasty Hollywood portrays them in movies like this? Every song that I remember from the movie was a rap song about f-ing, b-chs drugs etc. If I was black, I would be ashamed of this type of presentation of my culture.\n\nSo, what truth did Mr. Beatty present in this movie? Our culture and country are sick beyond belief. The churches are apostate, minorities downtrodden and the middle class being wiped out. But what is the answer?\n\nAccording to Beatty, socialism.\n\nMy humble opinion is Jesus Christ and a return to the values that founded this country are the answer, including the Constitution, second only to the Bible as the greatest document ever written.\n\nAt the end of the movie, an old grizzled black man speaks directly to the audience and says, “You got to be a spirit, not a ghost.” What is Beatty trying to say here? I really don’t know but I will paraphrase what he should have meant, “You’ve got to know the Holy Spirit, not the ghosts of humanistic government.”\n\nThis movie contains an incredible amount of profanity, no nudity, some mild violence and is really only for adults."
