        "text": "A story collection confidently and intriguingly connecting relationships to their locations.\n\nAll but the title story in Israeli author Liebrecht’s collection (A Man and a Woman and a Man, 2001, etc.) bear the name of a city or a country. In the opener, “America,” the narrator describes her mother’s departure for the U.S. with another woman’s husband and his newborn baby daughter. The two girls, allies and enemies, meet a handful of times, but only after most of the parents are dead does a truth emerge that rearranges the entire emotional landscape. This rich scenario introduces themes that will reappear elsewhere: orphaned and damaged children, long-contained anger and pain, family bonds. “Hiroshima” also makes fertile use of a delicate set-up, Idit’s move to Japan when her relationship with Natan stalls. In a foreign city, she learns lessons about another Holocaust and about the opacity of cross-cultural involvements. Liebrecht’s choices of location often carry historical and emotional baggage, and several of her protagonists are the offspring of Holocaust survivors. “Munich” depicts neo-Nazi violence against Muslims, drawing political parallels with Kristallnacht. “Jerusalem” tellingly moves between the present, with Idit tensely returning from Hiroshima to her old home and love, and the past, in which a historical figure gives voice to the city’s spiritual aspect while signaling the imminent destruction of the Temple. A warm and empathetic intelligence informs this book, fluently translated by Silverstein. Only a taste of melodrama occasionally mars its sensitivity, as in “Kibbutz,” which shows kibbutzniks abusing two mentally disabled members of the group. The concluding, post-apocalyptic title story is set in a nameless place where new family connections are being painfully forged and tenderness exists alongside a more brutal pragmatism.\n\nAccessible, perceptive fiction from a talented writer.\n\nFour men who meet as college roommates move to New York and spend the next three decades gaining renown in their professions—as an architect, painter, actor and lawyer—and struggling with demons in their intertwined personal lives.\n\nYanagihara (The People in the Trees, 2013) takes the still-bold leap of writing about characters who don’t share her background; in addition to being male, JB is African-American, Malcolm has a black father and white mother, Willem is white, and “Jude’s race was undetermined”—deserted at birth, he was raised in a monastery and had an unspeakably traumatic childhood that’s revealed slowly over the course of the book. Two of them are gay, one straight and one bisexual. There isn’t a single significant female character, and for a long novel, there isn’t much plot. There aren’t even many markers of what’s happening in the outside world; Jude moves to a loft in SoHo as a young man, but we don’t see the neighborhood change from gritty artists’ enclave to glitzy tourist destination. What we get instead is an intensely interior look at the friends’ psyches and relationships, and it’s utterly enthralling. The four men think about work and creativity and success and failure; they cook for each other, compete with each other and jostle for each other’s affection. JB bases his entire artistic career on painting portraits of his friends, while Malcolm takes care of them by designing their apartments and houses. When Jude, as an adult, is adopted by his favorite Harvard law professor, his friends join him for Thanksgiving in Cambridge every year. And when Willem becomes a movie star, they all bask in his glow. Eventually, the tone darkens and the story narrows to focus on Jude as the pain of his past cuts deep into his carefully constructed life.\n\nThe phrase “tour de force” could have been invented for this audacious novel.\n\nA violent surfacing of adolescence (which has little in common with Tarkington's earlier, broadly comic, Seventeen) has a compulsive impact.\n\n\"Nobody big except me\" is the dream world of Holden Caulfield and his first person story is down to the basic, drab English of the pre-collegiate. For Holden is now being bounced from fancy prep, and, after a vicious evening with hall- and roommates, heads for New York to try to keep his latest failure from his parents. He tries to have a wild evening (all he does is pay the check), is terrorized by the hotel elevator man and his on-call whore, has a date with a girl he likes—and hates, sees his 10 year old sister, Phoebe. He also visits a sympathetic English teacher after trying on a drunken session, and when he keeps his date with Phoebe, who turns up with her suitcase to join him on his flight, he heads home to a hospital siege. This is tender and true, and impossible, in its picture of the old hells of young boys, the lonesomeness and tentative attempts to be mature and secure, the awful block between youth and being grown-up, the fright and sickness that humans and their behavior cause the challenging, the dramatization of the big bang. It is a sorry little worm's view of the off-beat of adult pressure, of contemporary strictures and conformity, of sentiment….\n\nA strict report, worthy of sympathy."
