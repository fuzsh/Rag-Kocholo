        "text": "The seemingly endless conflict in the Middle East, which has erupted again into full-fledged war between Hamas and Israel, involves not just opposing governments and their armed forces, but millions of people who, like all of us, want only to live in peace. It’s easy to take sides and to see those we oppose as an abstract “other”, but they are human beings as well, with much the same hopes and dreams as us.\n\nTo say the situation is longstanding and complex would be an understatement; the roots of this conflict go back more than 150 years, and involve not just the Israeli Jews and Arab Muslims, but geopolitical players around the world. And while both “sides” can make claim to the moral high-ground, neither is entirely blameless for the crisis that exists.\n\nRather than seek evidence for whom to fault, we think the best course that we, as individuals can take, is to learn more about the people who are caught up in this war. To that end, we’ve begun to collect books, videos, movies and podcasts we think will help us to better understand both sides, and the humanity of those involved. We encourage you to share your suggestions.
