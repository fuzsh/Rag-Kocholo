        "text": "APPLES FROM THE DESERT\n\nSelected Stories.\n\nBy Savyon Liebrecht.\n\nTranslated by Marganit Weinberger-Rotman, Jeffrey M. Green, Barbara Harshav, 234 pp. New York:\n\nThe Feminist Press. $19.95.\n\nTHE parents of Savyon Liebrecht -- who was born in Munich in 1948 -- were death camp survivors who immigrated to Israel when she was a year old. Her childhood was shadowed by their silences. Her father had another wife, and children, in Poland before the war. Who were they? What became of them? She never learned. When she did her military service on a kibbutz and then left for school in London, her father stopped speaking to her for a year. More silence. She returned to Tel Aviv, married, had children and only then began her writing career.\n\n''Apples From the Desert'' is a collection of 12 stories published in Israel between 1986 and 1992 that explore the gap between bereft parents and their conflicted children. Liebrecht has perfect pitch for certain hyperalert, abrasive patterns of Jewish speech. Her characters squabble like George's parents on ''Seinfeld,'' except their grievances are real. She takes you places you've never been before -- a Warsaw apartment right after the war, crowded with young, marriageable death camp survivors; an Israeli playground frequented by nannies who had been rabbis' daughters and then were forced into prostitution in a Nazi brothel. At her best, Liebrecht is the equal of far better-known Israeli authors like Amos Oz. She deserves to have more of her work translated, in a more consistent fashion. Five translators, of varying abilities, contributed to this edition.\n\nAmericans expect only minor epiphanies from short stories. Liebrecht wants soul-shattering revelations and last-ditch reconciliations. Pregnant situations intrigue her more than rounded characters. You can feel you're reading a screenplay (she also writes for television) that leaves it to the actors to provide nuances and idiosyncrasies that make characters come to life.\n\nIn ''Hayuta's Engagement Party'' a survivor in his 70's begins, at last, to speak of the past. For his loving daughter, his death camp tales are ''a key to the riddle that haunted her all those years.'' For the rest of the family, they're a major nuisance -- horror stories that ruin every celebration. The naive, anguished patriarch, with ''the raised hand that always heralded the lofty words,'' is a gripping figure, but Liebrecht plays him for maximum pathos. Forbidden to speak at his granddaughter's engagement party, he has a stroke and drops dead on the cake. Bitter stories in his heart, sweet frosting on his lips? It might work on television."
