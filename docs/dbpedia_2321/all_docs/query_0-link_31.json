        "text": "Naomi Segal invites you to discuss a story, ‘Excision’ (כריתה), by Israeli author Savyon Liebrecht.\n\nSavyon Liebrecht (Hebrew: סביון ליברכט; born 13 January 1948) is an Israel author. She was born in Munich, Germany, to Polish Holocaust survivors as Sabine Sosnowski, the eldest of three children. She emigrated to Israel in 1950.\n\nExcision\n\nWhen Henya extracted the sharp scissors from the green plastic sheath with the picture of the dissected chicken sketched on it, her eyes started glazing, and when she put her hand to her granddaughter’s head and parted the shining, golden hair which tumbled like curled laces under the clicking scissors, her face had already turned into a mask.\n\nTo find out more, please contact Naomi at naomi.segal@sas.ac.uk or wait for a hand-out on the day!\n\n---------------"
