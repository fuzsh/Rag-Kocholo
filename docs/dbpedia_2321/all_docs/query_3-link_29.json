For some, these disguises help to realize secret longings and aspirations. But for Aldrick, the dashing “King of the Hill” who is dressed as a glorious dancing dragon, it will take one more masquerade—this time involving guns and hostages—before the illusion of power becomes reality.\n\n“The Dragon Can't Dance is a wonderful work filled with depth, insight, and truth.

Dungy, Matt O'Donnell & Jeffrey Thomson\n\nForeword by Gerald Stern\n\nDerived from the From the Fishouse Web site, a one-of-a-kind online archive devoted to the oral and aural aspects of contemporary American poetry, the From the Fishouse print anthology is a jamboree of poetry at its acoustic best. It collects over 175 poems by nearly a hundred poets from the archive, dividing them into ten playful thematic sections. Each poem is a striking example of why poetry is meant not just to be read, but read aloud. To complement the poems, the book includes illuminating excerpts from the Web site's Q&As with the poets, and, in the Fishouse tradition of poetry as an oral/aural form, it comes with a compact disc that features dynamic recitations of 36 of the poems in the book.

A dentist on a tryst is seduced by and impregnates an impetuous ghost. A beleaguered young writing professor follows his imagination one step too far while escorting a famous writer he finds darkly alluring. Provoked by a radio talk show, a woman tests who is more intimate, her husband or her dog. In the novella-length title story, a young McDonald’s cashier sets off alone on a harrowing, surreal journey after her domineering boyfriend commits a murder in her name—a journey from nowhere and nothing to an epiphany in Gatlinburg, at the edge of the Smoky Mountains wilderness.\n\n“[Vollmer] has now conjoined his two writing brain halves, his formal ease with tradition and an impulse to upset your applecart.

She’s a rebel—outspoken, sexually liberated, and determined to live her own life, free of her parents’ past. Yet, as daring and defiant as she is, Zosha cannot escape, obsessed with events that took place before her birth. She has dreams of Auschwitz, falls in love with “her own private Nazi,” and has an affair with a kinky Holocaust scholar. Meanwhile, her parents are baffled by the life of their American daughter. With unflinching honesty and wild humor, this collection of autobiographical, linked stories captures what it means to be born in the shadows of death, and to live and love without forgetting.\n\n“Fifteen finely crafted, interconnected stories, loosely based on the life of novelist Pilcer, that cumulatively reflect the tensions haunting the children of Holocaust survivors, . . .

As vignettes of Turkish life flash before our eyes at movie-like speed, it becomes clear that the poet is also telling the turbulent story of the twentieth century itself and of the ongoing global struggle between tradition, which trusts in God, and modernity, which entrusts the world to human hands. This is the first complete English translation of Hikmet’s epic masterwork.\n\n“A human landscape of the twentieth century.”\n\n—The Washington Post Book World\n\n“A lastingly fascinating work.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\nBanned in his own country for thirty years, the poetry of Turkey's foremost modern poet, Nazim Hikmet (1902-1963), has been translated into more than fifty languages.

She rose to become a member of the fledgling United Farm Workers union in 1966, and then, at the request of its leader Cesar Chavez, became its first woman organizer. Jessie fought injustice toward Mexican and all farm workers, seeking ways for workers to purchase their own farmland. As an activist, she became a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, testified before the Senate, and met the Pope.\n\nJessie De La Cruz is a role model for all– an ordinary person who became extraordinary by making change happen, not only for herself but for others.\n\n“A portrait of a true American heroine.”\n\n—Studs Terkel\n\n“Chicano writer Soto (who worked in the fields in high school and college) has written [De La Cruz’s] biography, based on personal interviews...teens will be caught by the facts of her hardship and struggle.”\n\n—Booklist\n\n“The author effectively personalizes the struggle of farm workers in a manner that will enable students to understand and care about their triumphs.”\n\n—School Library Journal\n\nGary Soto is a beloved and award-winning author of many novels, stories, memoirs, and collections of poetry, including Crazy Weekend and The Effects of Knut Hamsun on a Fresno Boy.\n\nPaperback / $11.95 / ISBN 978-0-89255-285-6 / 128 pages / Young Adult Nonfiction\n\nThe Laura (Riding) Jackson Reader\n\nLaura (Riding) Jackson\n\nSome see Laura Riding and Laura (Riding) Jackson as virtually two separate writers, the former a strikingly original Modernist poet and critic, the latter a supposedly reclusive thinker on man and woman, language, meaning, and truth. However, encountering her work in this rich cross-section, one discovers a remarkable consistency of theme developing throughout, from the earliest poems and stories to the \"post-poetic\" writings of her final years. The selections presented here span sixty-four years (1923-1987) and include famous works of poetry and prose—some long out of print or difficult to find—significant lesser-known writings, and an important previously unpublished late essay, “Body & Mind and the Linguistic Ultimate.”\n\nLaura (Riding) Jackson (1901-1991) is the author of more than forty books of poetry, criticism, and story. In 1991, just months prior to her death, she was awarded the Bollingen Prize for lifelong service to poetry.\n\nPaperback / $21.95 / ISBN 978-0-89255-263-4 / 380 pages / Criticism\n\nLife’s Good, Brother\n\nNâzim Hikmet\n\nTranslated from the Turkish By Mutlu Konuk Blasing\n\nSet in 1925 in Izmir, Turkey, protagonist-narrator, Ahmet, a Communist Party member who shares many biographical details with Hikmet himself, is hiding out in a stone cottage. Ahmet is being pursued by the secret police as he sets up an underground printing press. Using a cinematic technique, Hikmet experiments with the fluidity of time and memory, flashing back to his/Ahmet’s earlier years in Turkey and Russia and forward to the years and experiences to come. Present events and memory freely mix and merge, capturing everyday exigencies as well as the passionate undercurrents of Hikmet’s tumultuous life.\n\n“One of the first and most important ‘European’ novels written in Turkey: its horizons are not limited to the national issues of Turkey, it explores the basic values of life, and its heroes live cosmopolitan lives.”\n\n—Orhan Pamuk\n\n“A man’s never-ending search for life’s truths and loves...Humorous...exciting...profound.”\n\n—James Burt, ForeWord Reviews\n\nNâzim Hikmet (1902-1963) is “one of the essential poets of the twentieth century” (Edward Hirsch).

It is a tale full of beauty, and beautifully told.”\n\n—Stephen Kinzer\n\n“Nazim Hikmet is one of the heroes of the twentieth-century poetry. His work arrived to poets in the United States with a great rush of purity, power, and inspiration from a literary culture to which and a poet to whom we were all but oblivious.

It is the 1960s; the Second World War is in the past. Yet their father begins: “When I was in the camp...” He cannot stop telling stories about the concentration camp. Any ordinary event can evoke a memory and another story. The children are his frightened witnesses, his spellbound audience. They live in the everyday world of school and friends, and also in their father's nightmare world. The enormous tragedy of the Holocaust is passed down from parent to child through the powerful bond of love that ties them.\n\n“Friedman writes without ever compromising her compassion or extinguishing her sense of hope....a shocking and touching first novel.”\n\n—New York Times Book Review\n\n“A terse, haunted novel....with the tone and rhythm of a child's tale....heart-wrenching.”\n\n—Margo Jefferson, New York Times\n\n“Like Anne Frank's diary, [Nightfather] transcends genres, addressing adults and children alike....it retains a deep humanity in a pared-down, skeletally beautiful style....An extraordinary novel, written with passion, lucidity, and restraint...A noble addition to the literature of Holocaust survivors and their children.”\n\n—The Forward\n\nCarl Friedman was born in the Netherlands in 1952. She now lives in Amsterdam.

In ten installments, written from varying perspectives, we witness her uneasy relationships with faster, looser peers—girls she is drawn to but also alienated by.\n\nNo one, though, alienates Leah more than her mother, Helen. Estranged yet intertwined, they struggle within the confines of their personalities, unaware of how similar their paths are. Just when they seem at a lonely impasse, each makes an impulsive change—Leah taking a risky trip abroad, Helen renting a secret room in a welfare hotel. Jolted from their old patterns, the two of them independently glimpse the possibility of a more hopeful life.\n\n“Nothing pleases and startles a reader like a well done short story, and in Normal People Don't Live Like This, debut author Dylan Landis provides 10 of them, each a star turn. Landis knows when to be dreamy, and she knows when to be sharp, a perfect match for her themes of female desire, the quest for knowledge. [Her] precisely observed women are on the verge of everything, capable of anything.”\n\n—Susan Larson, New Orleans Times Picayune\n\n“Dylan Landis has a gift for creating characters... it is in her character details that the writing comes to life.... Leah is a female Holden Caulfield.... As for Landis, watch her very carefully. Once you can create characters like Leah (or Angeline, Rainey and Helen), there's no stopping you”\n\n—Susan Salter Reynolds, Los Angeles Times\n\n“The characters in Dylan Landis's debut short story collection, Normal People Don't Live Like This are blessedly extraordinary.”\n\n—Elissa Schappell, Vanity Fair\n\nDylan Landis has published stories in Bomb, Tin House, Best American Nonrequired Reading, and elsewhere. A former journalist, she has won a Poets & Writers California Voices Award and other honors for her fiction.

But his descendants, having eaten salt, were too heavy to fly and would not follow....\n\nOne hundred years after official Emancipation, the diverse people of Trinidad—Africa, Asian, and European—still have not settled into the New World. Two men set out to free them from “old captivities” and to welcome them to their island homeland. Around them swirl a cast of unforgettable men and women, each telling his own story in his own voice, each striving with passion and wit to make sense of life in a still-young country where the roles of enslaved and landowner still linger, but “the sky, the sea, every green leaf and tangle of vines sing freedom.”\n\n“A novel confident in its rhythms, in the authority of its selling, driven by an exultant compassion for its characters.”\n\n—Derek Walcott\n\n“[Lovelace’s] generous, torrential prose...seems to hold every complexity—of history, of ethnicity, of reason and magic alike—within its rushing energy.”\n\n—The New York Times Book Review\n\nEarl Lovelace was born and still resides in Trinidad.

Twenty years old, a philosophy student (and nonbeliever), she takes care of the children of a Hasidic family by day. At night she stays up reading - Nietzsche, Einstein, the Baal Shem Tov. The more she reads, the less she seems to understand. Does God exist? What does it mean to be a Jew? Chaya questions the reasons for anti-Semitism, the role of women in Judaism, the reasons for suffering. Mr. Apfelschnitt, an old friend of her father, tells Chaya that Creation is a masterpiece, that Science can’t replace God or the Torah. But her father advises her to study physics. Trying to put her Auschwitz past behind her, Chaya’s mother obsesses over baking, tea, and weaving. Her advice to Chaya: go out dancing.\n\nFinally, it is Chaya’s love for Simeha, the three-year-old boy in her care, that provides the key. She clashes with his tradition-bound father, then propelled by a tragic accident, learns just how much she is tied to her people and her faith.\n\n“In The Shovel and the Loom, Carl Friedman perfectly accomplishes the delicate task of making unspeakable stories at once accessible and shocking.”\n\n—Katherine Albert, The New York Times Book\n\n“One this is certain: Friedman’s vivid emotional power.
