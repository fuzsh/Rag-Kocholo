        "text": "This article examines Israeli discourse on posthumous reproduction (PR) and the related cultural construction of \"(un)natural\" grief. Based mainly on an analysis of in-depth interviews with family members who submitted a request for PR, we examine the regimes of justification used by supporters and opponents of this technology. With both sides using the notion of \"nature\" to support their claim, the dispute centers on whether PR constructs a new social expression of grief (and hence should be seen as unnatural) or is only a reflection of an age-old grieving process (and is thus natural). We argue that by employing a twofold, novel/traditional justification , PR supporters aim to go one step further, from a symbolic continuity of the dead to a so-called real one. This progression highlights the flexibility of the natural category at the intersection of technology and culture and the aban-donment of such binary distinctions as life/death and nature/culture.\n\nThis article addresses the national-political functions of mainstream Hebrew literature, focusing on one question: What are soldiers’ mothers in the canonical literature ‘allowed’ to think, feel and do, and what is considered transgressive? How has the presence of soldiers’ mothers in Israeli public life changed since the first Lebanon War? At the center of the discussion is David Grossman’s novel To The End Of The Land (2008). I argue that the author posits ‘the flight from bad tidings’ as both a maternal strategy and the author’s psycho-poetic strategy. This paper examines the cultural and gendered significance of the analogy between the act of flight and the act of writing which Grossman advances in his epilogue.\n\nIn recent years, A. B. Yehoshua has been taken to task for tempering his criticism of Israeli politics and shifting closer to the political center. In this article, I shift the discussion to a historical and poetic perspective through an interpretive evaluation of the bereaved father figure in Yehoshua's oeuvre. His approach to the bereaved father has undergone a radical transformation. This is clearly seen in his latest works in which he has made the transition from a critical stance toward the bereaved father—one of the most potent images of Zionist ideology—to a more moderate position reflecting internalization and acceptance of bereavement. To investigate this development, I explore the use of the bereavement myth in several of Yehoshua's works and offer a detailed comparison of his early novella Bi-techilat kayits 1970 (Early in the Summer of 1970; 1972) and his more recent work Esh yedidutit (Friendly Fire: A Duet; 2007).\n\nThe study of loss as a result of war and conflict has been a mainstay of the bereavement field in Israel. The present article provides a brief background of Israel and its literature relating to loss and bereavement. A series of research studies based on the Two-track Model of ..."
