        "text": "July 19, 2023\n\nEncountering the right book at the right time requires a very subtle alchemy. When it occurs, the result is magic. That’s what happened with The Bridesman.\n\nI hadn’t heard of Savyon Liebrecht before (more’s the pity) but we happened to be entertaining Israeli visitors. When they saw me pick up this book, they exclaimed with delight, “You’re going to love her work.” How right they were!\n\nI was hooked by the very first page. A seasoned ghostwriter is invited to cross the ocean at the request of Adella, a young poor, and disfigured woman who married his beloved uncle years ago. In his profession, he has learned that the details of a tale are dependent upon what he is told. As a result, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between fact and fabrication. How will he straddle the gap between the facts as he remembered them as a young boy and the way these same facts were perceived by his close-knit, rigidly religious Persian family?\n\nThe facts he remembers is that an orphan from a boarding school, with coke-bottle classes and a noticeable limp, is identified as a potential wife for his kind uncle, who is victim to a disease with certain characteristics of Parkinson’s. She is much younger than her intended groom, and the family treats her with barely concealed disdain. All, that is, except for our narrator, Mischa. Adella chooses him to be the birdesman at the wedding.\n\nFast forward. Mischa is now in Los Angeles. Years have interceded. Adella is not at all the unpoised woman he met years ago. She seems to have a story she wants to share with him. But what is the import of the story? Why Mischa…and why now?\n\nThis slim novel is beautifully written and reveals a writer who is at the top of her craft. I was immersed in the sights, the sounds, the smells, the trajectory of this book. Thanks once again to Europa Editions for enabling me to be an early reader in exchange for an honest review. I wholeheartedly recommend this riveting book, wonderfully translated from the Hebrew by Gilah Kahn-Hoffmann.\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nמיכה, סופר צללים, ישראלי לשעבר החי בלוס אנג'לס, מוזמן לביקור בארץ ע\"י אדלה, אישתו של דודו משה, כדי לשמוע את סיפור חייה. מיכה מתאר את זיכרונותיו מגיל 9 ועד גיל 15, ספציפית בהקשר להצטרפות של אדלה למשפחתם, עד שעזב בגיל 15 את הארץ ועבר לגור בלוס אנג'לס, ולאחר מכן את קורותיו בביקור בארץ ומה שאדלה - עכשיו אדל, אשת עסקים מצליחה - מספרת לו. בסוף גם נגלה לו סוד מפתיע.\n\nספר מצוין שקראתי בנשימה אחת - סאגה משפחתית עם מאפיינים מסו��מים של סיפור בלשי. הכתיבה מעולה ומרתקת.\n\nבתחילת הספר מיכה מתאר את המשפחה כרשת ביטחון עשויה פלדה, וככל שהספר מתקדם, מסתבר שמושג המשפחה הוא לאו דווקא כזה. קשרי המשפחה החזקים הולכים ומתרופפים, ואילו אדלה - יתומה ללא משפחה - מצליחה לברוא משפחה משלה במו ידיה.\n\nמיכה מונה כשושבין של אדלה בחתונתה, ואכן הוא משמש כשושבין בחייה של אדלה לא רק בחתונה, אלא גם בהיבטים אחרים.\n\nMay 29, 2023\n\nIl testimone della sposa (E/O, 2023, traduzione di Alessandra Shomromi) è un breve romanzo che la scrittrice nata in Germania, ma ormai israeliana, Savyon Liebrecht, autrice di libri belli ed emozionanti, ci regala: è il caso di usare questo termine, per la leggerezza, la sensibilità con cui viene descritto il rapporto tra un bambino di dieci anni, Micha, e una diciottenne claudicante, molto miope, orfana, timidissima, che lui incontra in casa del nonno. La ragazza, che vive in collegio, potrebbe essere scelta come sposa dello zio Mose, unico dei fratelli rimasto in casa col padre, perché la sua condizione di salute non è buona.\n\nTra la solitaria e povera Adela, guardata dai fratelli dell’ipotetico sposo, quasi quarantenne, e il bambino ingenuo ma diretto, scatta una forma di tacita solidarietà e vicinanza, fortemente osteggiata dall’intera famiglia. Al bambino viene persino vietato di frequentare la casa del nonno dove la famiglia si riunisce ogni settimana per lo Shabbat.\n\nDopo molti contrasti e diverse altre proposte, Adela viene accettata e sposerà l’handicappato Mose, a patto che Micha sia il testimone di nozze della sposa. Durante il matrimonio un terribile affronto viene fatto ad Adela: una delle cognate le strappa gli occhiali, rendendola così incapace di vedere quanto avviene intorno a lei. La ragazza, disperata, chiede a Micha di riportarglieli, ma lui viene bloccato dalla madre.\n\nAdela vivrà anni terribili in casa con il suocero vecchio, il marito fragile e incapace di difenderla dalla rapacità dei suoi fratelli, di cui è l’eterno succube.\n\nMolti anni dopo Micha è un giovane uomo emigrato con la sua famiglia a Los Angeles. Ora è un ghostwriter affermato, si è sposato, poi separato, ha una figlia.\n\nUn giorno riceve improvvisamente un invito a tornare a Tel Aviv, proprio da Adela, che gli chiede un incontro. Arrivato nella sua terra d’origine, per Micha vi saranno molte sorprese; l’albergo prenotato per lui da Adela è quello dove lei e Mose avevano passato la prima notte di nozze. Ma Adela ha cambiato nome, adesso si chiama Adel, che è anche il titolo della seconda parte del romanzo.\n\nUna sorpresa per Micha, ma anche per noi lettori, la storia che la donna, ormai cinquantenne e divenuta bella e ricca, racconterà al suo testimone di nozze.\n\nGrande narratrice di storie intriganti, Savyon Liebrecht, abile nel tratteggiare la psicologia di una ragazza sfortunata, ma tenace e determinata che saprà rivoltare il suo destino con la forza della disperazione.\n\nLingua affilata e precisa, quella di cui si serva la scrittrice, per raccontare una storia dura ma anche amorosa e piena di profondità nascoste.\n\nLa famiglia ebrea di stretta osservanza religiosa è un recinto di mostri, da cui però la giovane Adela non si farà schiacciare, restituendo la sua dolorosa storia di vincitrice all’unico essere umano che aveva provato a capirla e apprezzarla.\n\nMicha è un ghost writer e vive ormai da decenni negli Stati Uniti. Per questo è sorpreso quando la moglie dello zio, Adela, lo invita a sue spese in Israele, dove è vissuto da ragazzo. La prima parte del romanzo di Savyon Liebrecht si incentra sulla reminiscenza delle circostanze che hanno creato il rapporto particolare fra Micha e Adela in una vita passata che sembra ormai remotissima. Micha era ancora un bambino la prima volta che incontra Adela durante una riunione per lo shabbat con l’intera famiglia allargata. Fratelli, cugini, zii, tutti fortemente legati all’interno di una tradizionalissima famiglia di ebrei persiani. È per la sua origine persiana che anche Adela è lì: la famiglia cerca una sposa per lo Zio Moshe, ormai di mezza età e con una menomazione, e Adela, seppure giovane, è orfana, zoppa e porta occhiali spessi, e potrebbe per questo prendere in considerazione questo matrimonio. È quindi invitata, ma quando arriva, fradicia e intirizzita, viene abbandonata in un angolo, su una poltrona, sola in mezzo a un gruppo di sconosciuti che la ignorano altezzosamente non ritenendola degna. Solo Micha le rivolge una parola gentile, ed è così che inizia il loro inusuale rapporto in mezzo alle beghe di una famiglia ostile e chiusa nelle sue dinamiche. Adela però si rivela inaspettatamente originale e determinata. Rimane però un mistero che è al centro della seconda parte del romanzo e che si svolge nel presente: perché Adela ha invitato Micha dopo tanti anni?\n\nMoltissimi scrittori israeliani hanno scritto saghe familiari, fra loro autori molto conosciuti anche all’estero, come Amos Oz con l’opera autobiografica Una storia di amore e di tenebra, e Scatola Nera, un romanzo di fantasia. Di famiglie tratta anche l’apprezzato e recentemente scomparso scrittore Abraham B. Yehoshua, col bellissimo Un divorzio tardivo. Il fascino che gli scrittori israeliani provano per le biografie è probabilmente connesso con la peculiare realtà del paese. Fra gli anni Cinquanta e gli anni Novanta del Novecento moltissimi ebrei si sono trasferiti in Israele da altri paesi, portando con loro tradizioni dalle comunità della diaspora, per ritrovarsi in un paese nuovo, in rapido cambiamento e in un continuo dibattito fra tradizione e modernità. Le saghe diventano così il modo di trattare, nel microcosmo del nucleo familiare, gli enormi cambiamenti della società. Spesso appaiono personaggi che hanno vissuto in un altro paese e tornano a riesaminare dinamiche e ricordi in un’autopsia su rapporti spezzati, errori commessi e una società piena di contraddizioni. Parte di quello che rende la novella di Liebrecht interessante è la capacità di calare il lettore all’interno di scene al contempo vivide e simboliche. Come osservare il vecchio nonno persiano e toccare la poltrona di velluto verde su cui siede Adela.\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nYou never know what \"hidden gem\" you will find while browsing through hoopla. This was an understated book that came with a surprise twist near the end of the story. Well written and translated, the author captures the culture, food, and family dynamics.\n\nMay 8, 2024\n\nQuick read- only 160 pages. Enjoyed the story. Knew the twist at the end by the middle of the book. Still enjoyed it.\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\nThis was a well written short story about Miche who is invited back to Israel to visit his aunt Adela years after being a Bridesman for her and uncle Moshe. Memories and revelations of family dynamics are revealed. Enjoyed the ending.\n\nJune 3, 2023\n\nUna storia piena di rivelazioni e sconvolgimenti di due vite che si rincontrano dopo ventiquattro anni, facendo riaffiorare un passato dimenticato da troppo tempo, che cambierà il corso della loro esistenza. Soprattutto ci rivela come i legami familiari che ci danno sicurezza a volte rappresentino una prigione da cui è meglio evadere. Personaggi ben caratterizzati e definiti\n\nMolto interessante la rappresentazione del mondo ebraico.\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nThe 2 main characters in this novella are Adella and the narrator Micha, who both belong to the Persian-Jewish minority in Israel. An orphan with severe myopia and a clubfoot, Adella is in a weak position when it comes to choosing a husband. When a powerful family reluctantly picks her as the bride of 38-year Moshe, still single because he is handicapped, Adella nonetheless manages to set some conditions, one of them being that Moshe's 9-year old nephew Micha should act as bridesman to their wedding. The odd alliance between the boy and the young woman upsets Micha's mother, who tries her best to keep them apart. Love does blossom between Moshe and Adella, in spite of the cruelty and duplicity of Moshe's siblings who take advantage of the couple at every turn, and virtually turn Adella into a slave. One day at school, Micha is seized by a raging fever, and before collapsing entirely, asks to be taken to Moshe's house. When he is on his way to recovery, his mother promptly puts him on a plane to Los Angeles, where his father has long made a new home for himself. Micha embraces his new American identity with a vengeance, and forgets all about Adella. The book starts when Adella pays for Micha to visit her in Israel. Micha, who makes a reasonable living as a ghost-writer, is surprised to find that Adella has become a prosperous businesswoman. Having fixed her vision through laser surgery and her clubfoot with clever insoles, she exudes charm and confidence. Adella shows Micha a picture of her only son, born a few months after Micha emigrated, but is oddly reluctant to introduce the 2 men. Unfortunately, the reason for her reluctance became instantly obvious to me, so that the big reveal at the end was a bit of a wet firecracker as far as I was concerned. This is a nice, easy read with some atmosphere but nothing very special.\n\nDecember 28, 2023\n\nThis 151-page novella provides an engrossing journey into the memory of a nine-year-old Israeli boy. Micah is now an almost 40-year-old who returns to Tel Aviv for the first time in almost 25 years.. When he became quite ill at 15, his mother moved him to the United States to live with his father. This is the first time he is back in Israel, and he believes it is because his aunt, Adella, wants him to ghost-write her autobiography.\n\nWhen he first med Adella, she was an impoverished girl of 18, raised in an orphanage residence for girls. She had a severe limp and coke-bottle glasses and had been brought to a family gathering to meet Moshe, the handicapped youngest brother of the boy's large Persian-Jewish clan.\n\nA Bridesman is someone asked to give a bride away at her wedding. Micha became that at Adella's wedding to Moshe, at her request. he had been the only one at the family meeting who was kind to Adella, giving her some candied almonds.\n\nA beautifully written piece of literary fiction, The Bridesman will involve you emotionally with a large, close but dysfunctional family. The story develops over the course of two days Micha spends in Israel with Adella, now successful businesswoman Adel. It is a fascinating and engrossing piece of writing whose ending will stun and surprise you. Savyon Liebrecht is someone whose earlier works I will now look up and read.\n\nI received this book as a gift from Europa Editions for which I am very thankful and appreciative.\n\nMarch 20, 2024\n\nSet in Israel amongst a Persian-Jewish family who immigrated to the country in 1950, this short novel tells the story of Micha, who at the age of nine was chosen to be the bridesman at his Uncle Moshe’s wedding. The bride was a young orphan, an outwardly timid girl whom the family had chosen as she seemed to fit the bill for their disabled brother. She would be biddable, they thought. A few years later, Micha and his family emigrate to the US and have little contact with the rest of the family. Then 25 years later Micha gets a call from Adella, now transformed into Adel and nothing like the girl he remembers. Micha is now a ghost-writer and Adel wants him to write her memoir. As she starts to divulge all that happened after Micha’s departure, Micha is confronted with a past very different to the one he thought he knew and has to readjust his own memories. It’s a vivid portrait of a traditional Jewish family, caught between their home customs and the new demands of a secular state. There’s a twist at the end, which I didn’t find totally convincing, but in the context of the rest of the novel I was willing to suspend my disbelief. I very much enjoyed the book, finding it well-written, well-paced and insightful about family relationships and the possibility of challenging and changing one’s destiny. A great read.\n\nApril 13, 2024\n\nMicha was nine when he met Adella, the fifteen-year-old girl who would marry his beloved and disabled 40yo uncle Moshe. Orphaned, poor, but extraordinarily bright, Adella was at first rejected then grudgingly accepted by Moshe’s family. Years later, after Micha moved to Los Angeles and became American, Adella invites him back to Israel so she can tell him her story.\n\nThis book was, for lack of a better word, a quiet story. Micha and Adella are rich, imperfect characters and although there is an extensive cast of additional characters, they aren’t as well drawn. It’s mostly told to Micha or observed by Micha; there isn’t a lot of action or a compelling plot to drive the story forward. That said it is very readable and there is a certain je ne sais quoi that keeps the reader engaged. When I put it down I didn’t feel compelled to come back to it, but when I was reading, I didn’t want to stop. Interesting\n\nJune 20, 2024\n\nTranslated from Hebrew, this book by a well-known Israeli author is a quick and engaging read. Years after the fact, Micha is invited back to Tel Aviv by the wife of one of his uncles (he was a teenage bridesman at their wedding). At the time he seemed the only member of his Persian Jewish family who treated her for kindness, even though the family sought her out to marry a family member with a variety of disabilities. She herself had both very limited vision and a limp, but already showed herself capable of standing up for herself. Decades later, after her husband’s death, Micha finds her a very different person, one who has made herself independent and wealthy with her line of homemade clothing. But why has she invited Micha back? Is it to tell her story? And what does he really know of her? I admit I didn’t foresee the surprise revelation at the end.\n\nAugust 22, 2024\n\nSome books are deceptively simple. Take, for example, Sayon Liebrecht’s “The Bridesman” (Europa Editions). This evocative and poignant short novel – 151 pages – is narrated by Micha, an Israeli expatriate who is called back to visit Israel by his Aunt Adella after he’s lived in the United States for 24 years. Her purchase of a plane ticket and the reservation at a fancy Tel Aviv hotel makes him wonder what she wants in return. Micha is a ghostwriter and ponders whether she wants him to write the story of her life. This makes him think back to his aunt’s initial introduction to his formerly very close-knit family.\n\nSee the rest of my review at https://www.thereportergroup.org/book...\n\nFebruary 25, 2024\n\nA lyrical story about family (with all its complexity) and the importance of forging a path in life for oneself.\n\nAdelle is a young girl that gets married into a Jewish family of Iranian descent in which women's voices don't have a seat at the table. Over many years, she is punished for her desire for independence. The only person in the family who is kind to her is Micha, who becomes her bridesman at the wedding. He later emigrates to Los Angeles.\n\nThe two are reunited decades later when Adelle is now Adel - a successful and wealthy designer and store owner.\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nI read it in Hebrew so I don't know how the translation is.\n\nAs far as the story: Savyon Liebrecht knows how to write a captivating story. Her description of Micha's childhood memories are beautiful gems full of what makes up memories: smell, touch, voices and especially eyes that always speak on their own. Adella, the orphaned girl, and main character may have impaired eyes , yet she is the one that sees the true nature of her new family. And while they all have strong legs and she is the one with a bad limp, it's Adella that realy moves forward in life while they are stuck.\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nI really liked Liebrecht's stories and was excited to read a novel - she is prolific but not a lot has been translated into English.\n\nThis novel has a wonderful and slightly dark twist that I figured out right before the end. It's very slice of life (if you a Mizrahi Jew, that is) with just a tiny bit of creepiness. I thought it was delicious but YMMV.\n\nJuly 29, 2023\n\nA short book, gentle, smart and unassuming. A great example that a story (and a book) can be excellent without being long\n\nJanuary 2, 2024\n\nI found this to be a very enjoyable novel and a light read. The prose was easy and engaging and drew me into the story that the author effortlessly laid out before me. I would recommend this book.\n\nJanuary 6, 2024\n\nThis sweet, sad, charming, bizarre story is told in less than 150 pages. Perfect!\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\n4.0 rating due to questions that are still left unanswered.\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nSlim novel great to read while traveling- 6 hours on a plane and I roared thru it - very compelling read.\n\nApril 23, 2024\n\nThis book was nothing that I expected it to be. Rather bland but the ending is quite a surprise.\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\nסיפור נהדר! מעורר מחשבה, מעורר השראה וכתוב נהדר\n\nJune 13, 2024\n\nWow, what a story. A fast read that rips your heart."
