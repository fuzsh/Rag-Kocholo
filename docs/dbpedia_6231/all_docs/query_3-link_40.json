        "text": "To get a good glimpse of the back room horse trading that typify European Union appointments, many have argued the rapid rise of Federica Mogherini is a case in point.\n\nLacking experience and seen as suspiciously soft on Russia, the 41-year-old Italian has been named the EU’s foreign policy chief, only seven months after she was plucked from parliamentary obscurity in Rome and named foreign minister of her own country.\n\nTo her detractors, the timing of her arrival in the EU’s top foreign policy posting could not be worse, as Vladimir Putin sends troops into Ukraine, presenting the EU with its toughest challenge yet.\n\nThis, after all, was the same minister whose conciliatory comments on Russia’s possible annexation of eastern Ukraine were once given a welcome reception by Itar-Tass, the state-run news agency.\n\nFor Italy, critics argued, this was par for the course. With its strong trade ties to Moscow and a reliance on Russian gas, Italy has long moderated its criticism of Mr Putin’s aggressive foreign policy, notably when Italy’s former prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, was in the habit of attending discrete parties at the Russian leader’s dacha.\n\nSo how did Mrs Mogherini make it?\n\nThe answer is the EU’s habit of carefully parcelling out top positions along party lines. The job was reserved for a centre-Left politician, and Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was able to push for a senior posting in Brussels after his strong showing in European elections in May.\n\nMrs Mogherini also helps solve the tricky problem of bringing in more women to top posts, particularly after Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, warned in July that the legislature would not accept “a gentleman’s club”.\n\nThen, on Thursday, the Eastern Europeans were thrown a bone when the Polish government said Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, was seriously considering a proposal to take on the job of president of the European Council to help the EU tackle the Ukraine crisis.\n\nTo assure East Europeans that Italy would not go soft on Mr Putin, Mr Renzi telephoned the Russian president on Thursday to warn him of the “very serious consequences” of his incursions into Ukraine. But none of that washed with Thomas Wright, a fellow at the influential Brookings Institution in the US, who complained that EU horse trading was riding rough shod over putting the right people in the right job. “The bottom line is that foreign policy is almost entirely absent from the discussion,” he wrote.\n\n“In normal times, this would be a bit unseemly but not outrageous. These are not normal times however.” But Italians who have worked with her believe Mrs Mogherini might prove a surprise package.\n\n“She is well prepared, she reads the files, she is enthusiastic and picks excellent advisors - I am moderately optimistic,” said Michele Nones, a senior analyst at the IAI think tank in Rome.\n\n“She grasps topics fast and is at ease in an international setting,” said Alessandro Politi, the director of the Nato defence college foundation in Rome, who worked with Mrs Mogherini when she ran the Italian delegation to Nato’s parliamentary assembly.\n\nOn her blog, named “BlogMog”, she reveals she worked in a call centre after leaving school and reads thrillers.\n\n“Federica is more of the scholarly type, a brilliant student of international relations who discovered a passion for politics,” said\n\nNicola Pedde, the director of the Institute for Global Studies in Rome."
