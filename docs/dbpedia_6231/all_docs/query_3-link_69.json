        "text": "Federica Mogherini, from Italy, has been proposed as the EU's high representative for foreign policy and security policy, which would also make her a vice-president of the Commission. She was heard by the foreign affairs committee on Monday, 6th of October.\n\nMember of the foreign affairs committee Tunne Kelam MEP asked the following question:\n\nMs Mogherini, you have impressed me with your sincere will to efficiently run the common foreign policy, but you have yet to convince me how to stop Mr Putin in real time. EU sanctions are lagging behind Putin’s moves. It is Moscow that sets the agenda, while we react, but cannot stop or prevent, not to speak of restoring the pre-aggression situation. Do you not think that we need first to address and clearly condemn the very roots of Russian aggression, the scandalous doctrine of defending so-called ‘compatriots’ abroad by military invasion? Ignoring this fascist doctrine has resulted in the present situation. Second, defending Ukraine, how can we justify refusing arms to a friendly country under attack while allowing a Member State to deliver modern assault warships to the very aggressor? If that is not crossing the red line of European principles and solidarity, then what is?\n\nFederica Mogherini, Vice-President-designate of the Commission, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy:\n\nI think that it was made quite clear by all of us, not just by me or by some of us, but by all of us, from the very beginning of this crisis, where the responsibility lies and how dangerous it is, not only for our continent but for the rest of the world, to change borders by force. I think that is the basis for all the decisions that we have taken in the last month. So there is no doubt among us – I think we should be very clear, whatever our political family or our Member States, or our personal views – no doubt that occupying or annexing part of a country, changing the borders by force, and having troops in a different country, is absolutely a violation of international principles that we all agreed on and that are the basis of our common work. The point is, how do we take effective action to put a stop to it? And on this question I think it would be very fruitful to have a real and in-depth discussion, first of all with our friends from Ukraine. My point of reference there is working with the Ukrainians, because in the end they are the ones that are there. They are the ones that have to deal with the conflict on their territory, and they are the ones for whom we are trying to develop a strategy to stop this. We have adopted the sanctions. Have the sanctions been effective on the Russian economy? Yes. I think the Russian economy is starting to suffer quite a lot from that. So, if the question is: have the choices that we have made so far been effective on the Russian economy? Yes. Are they effective on Russian political decisions? I think we still have a question mark there. And the Ukrainians themselves have a question mark there as they now continue to say we have to go on working, trying to work on the political solution. So my point of reference there would be to support President Poroshenko’s efforts and agree with the Ukrainians the steps that we take."
