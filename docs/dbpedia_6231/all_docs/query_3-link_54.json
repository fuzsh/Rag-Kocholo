        "text": "On a working visit to Brussels, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan met today with Federica Mogherini, Vice-President of the European Commission / EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\n\nThe Prime Minister underscored that the European Union has been a reliable partner ever since Armenia’s independence. Nikol Pashinyan noted that the new Armenian government is pursuing a policy of upward democratic development in a bid to ensure the rule of law, protect human rights and build a competitive and business-friendly environment. In this context, the head of the Armenian government stressed the importance of European Union’s advisory and financial assistance for the ongoing democratic reforms in Armenia.\n\nSpeaking about the political transformations underway in our country, Nikol Pashinyan noted that democracy is not a foreign policy orientation for Armenia, but a system of values that the government seeks to develop and strengthen.\n\nWelcoming Armenia’s peaceful democratic changes, Federica Mogherini pointed to the need for furthering EU-Armenia relations. “You can rely on us on the way to implementing the radical reforms initiated by you, which seek to enforce the rule of law, combat corruption, protect human rights and so on. I am confident that our cooperation is in for a bright future; we stand ready to support the reforms implemented in your country,” Mogherini said.\n\nThe parties stressed the importance of expanding EU-Armenia cooperation and successfully implementing the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA). Nikol Pashinyan and Federica Mogherini touched upon the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the peaceful settlement of which, according to the High Representative, remains one of the priorities of the European Union."
