        "text": "European Union – Jean-Yves Le Drian to attend Foreign Affairs Council (Brussels - July 17, 2017)\n\nMinister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian will attend the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on July 17.\n\nThe ministers will review the situation in Mosul and Raqqa. Mr. Le Drian will brief them on his visit to the Gulf.\n\nThe ministers will work on the migration crisis and the political situation in Libya as the new UN secretary-general's special representative, Ghassan Salamé, prepares to assume his duties.\n\nThey will examine the responses to be given to the nuclear and ballistic crisis in North Korea following the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4. North Korea's destabilizing actions call for a firm response from the EU, one that includes stepping up pressure and a thorough reexamination of our relations with North Korea.\n\nThey will also review the crisis in Venezuela.\n\nDiscussions will deal with the implementation priorities for the global strategy of the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini. On this occasion, Jean-Yves Le Drian will reiterate France's priorities, particularly the conclusion of work on security and defense, and strengthening the EU's commitment on eight other major challenges, including the climate.\n\nMr. Le Drian prepared this Foreign Affairs Council with Ms. Mogherini during their meeting in Paris on July 13.\n\nHuman rights – France's support for the Spanish candidate to the Human Rights council for the 2018-2020 term and its announcement of France's candidate for the 2021-2023 term\n\nFrance promotes human rights and denounces their violation at the Human Rights Council (HRC) and in all bilateral and multilateral bodies.\n\nWe focus on our priorities with a progressive vision: promoting the universality of human rights, denouncing their violation, combating the death penalty, protecting rights defenders and journalists, protecting children in armed conflicts, and combating forced disappearances, to name but a few.\n\nAt the Human Rights Council, we take part in debates and—with and via our partners—initiate resolutions such as the resolution on extreme poverty at the 35th session of the HRC.\n\nIn this regard, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian recently reviewed the human rights situation in the world with his Spanish counterpart, Alfonso Dastis. Fully agreeing with our analyses and sharing the same European values, they agreed that our two countries would speak with a single voice at the HRC. To that end, we have decided to support the Spanish candidate to the Human Rights Council for the 2018-2020 term, with the understanding that France will put forward a candidate for the subsequent three-year term when elections are held in 2020.\n\nSituation in the Gulf\n\nThe Kuwaiti paper Al-Qabas reports that Mr. Le Drian is arriving in the Gulf with a European initiative and several specific proposals to end the crisis. Can you confirm this?\n\nAs the President affirmed in Trieste on July 12, Jean-Yves Le Drian will be visiting the region on July 15 and 16 \"in order to hold talks with all our partners, in a situation of high tension.\"\n\nHe noted that since the outbreak of the crisis, France had been acting as an intermediary with the aim of \"easing tensions\" and \"holding discussions with each of the parties, to restore calm in the region.\"\n\nIraq\n\nThe families and lawyers of French citizens arrested in Iraq are asking the French authorities to repatriate them so that they will be tried in France and their children will be cared for. What is France's position on this?\n\nWe are not contesting the Iraqi authorities' ability to try French nationals involved in terrorist organizations in Iraq.\n\nIf the Iraqi authorities inform us that they are detaining French nationals, we will of course extend to them the consular protections provided by the Vienna Convention of April 24, 1963. That protection consists of ensuring the conditions in which the parties are detained and the respect of their right to a defense. We would also be particularly vigilant concerning the situation of any children who are minors.\n\nChina / Death of Liu Xiaobo – Statement by Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs (July 13, 2017)\n\nI was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Liu Xiaobo, winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nI hail the memory of this intellectual whose peaceful commitment to promoting freedom, human rights and democracy will remain a legacy for future generations. Despite long periods of detention, for more than 30 years he never stopped courageously defending basic rights, and particularly the freedom of expression.\n\nI offer my condolences to all his loved ones. France had repeatedly called for his release, and we hope that the Chinese authorities will guarantee freedom of movement for his wife, Liu Xia, his family, and his loved ones.\n\nDefending human right is a French diplomatic priority worldwide. This issue is therefore part of our dialogue with China."
