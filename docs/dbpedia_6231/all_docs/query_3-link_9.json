        "text": "Federica Mogherini is a College of Europe chancellor, former Member of Italian Parliament, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and a senior representative for European foreign relations. Her three decades of experience in international diplomacy and negotiation have made her a powerful advocate for global peace and cooperation, and she is a sought-after political speaker for industry events and conferences.\n\nFederica has been the rector of the College of Europe, a postgraduate institution that focuses on European studies based in Belgium and Poland, since 2020.\n\nIn 2019 she was named co-chair of the High-Level Panel on Internal Displacement by the United Nations Secretary-General.\n\nIn addition to her services in the European Commission’s Group of Personalities on Defence Research as a High-Level member since 2015, Federica served in the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as a High Representative from 2014 to 2019. Serving as Head of Italian Delegation and Vice-President of the Political Committee for the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, she was a vanguard of crisis-management operations and missions.\n\nFederica was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in 2014 as part of Italy’s 63rd cabinet, becoming the third woman in history to hold this position. Prior to this, she became an official member of the Italian Parliament in 2008 when the Chamber of Deputies elected her Secretary of its Defence Committee, a position she held until 2013. During this period, she served in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe as an Italian Delegation member. Since the founding of the Democratic Party in 2007, she has served in governance positions, including Secretary for European and International Affairs and Secretary for Institutional Reforms. She was also a member of the National Council, where later she was appointed to the National Executive Board and Political Committee.\n\nAs an accomplished columnist, Federica has written many articles on her popular online column BlogMog. The blog, which covers topics from technology and trading to health and lifestyle, also showcases some of her prominent engagements and even features various statements and speeches she has delivered in the political landscape and news media.\n\nShe received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Tampere in 2018 and was presented the Kaiser Otto Prize in 2017 for outstanding services to European unity. In 2016, she was awarded the Hessian Peace Prize to recognise her contributions as a mediator in the Iran and US nuclear settlement.\n\nFederica has been appointed to numerous boards, including the Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI) as a member, Generation Unlimited as a board member, Munich Security Conference as a member of the Advisory Council and the Africa Europe Foundation as a member of the High-Level Group of Personalities on Africa-Europe Relation. She also serves on the board of trustees for non-profit organisations such as Friends of Europe and International Crisis Group. Furthermore, she is a fellow of the German Marshall Fund.\n\nFederica is a highly accomplished politician and diplomat who has held several high-profile positions in comparative government. As a celebrated speaker, she is known for her eloquence and charisma. Federica has an ability to inspire, which has made her a sought-after speaker for some of the most respected events in the world, such as the G20 summit."
