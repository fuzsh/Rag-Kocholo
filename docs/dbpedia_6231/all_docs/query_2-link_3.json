        "text": "Federica Mogherini (born 16 June 1973) is an Italian politician who served as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission from November 2014 to November 2019. She previously served as Italy's Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation from February 2014 to October 2014, in the centre-left Renzi Cabinet. She was a Member of the Chamber of Deputies (MP) from 2008 to 2014. In 2020 she was appointed rector of the College of Europe, a post-graduate university for European studies in Bruges (Belgium) and Natolin (Poland). She is a member of the Democratic Party, part of the Party of European Socialists, a political faction made up of centre-left national-level political parties in EU and Norway.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nWe need to tell citizens what Europe is, it is not all about angels and demons. It is a reality which have helped us in numerous ways – and still helps us. I think about peace, a thing we now undervalue but which has a primary importance. Let’s think about fYROM, for instance. Nowadays, those countries, former enemies, are entering the Union or are already Member States. Then, the freedom of movement, the rights for consumers.\n\nAs quoted in \"Mogherini: Italy will play a major role\" in eunews (12 January 2014).\n\nThere are mistakes, which governments have been doing when they were trying to face the economic crisis, since 2008. Slow choices, sometimes insufficient, sometimes wrong, never neutral. Political choices made by political governments which must assume their responsibility on them. In Italy we have adopted forward-looking choices, economically speaking, we have adopted austerity as leading value. Now it is time to work on development and growth, to create jobs and exit this crisis.\n\nAs quoted in \"Mogherini: Italy will play a major role\" in eunews (12 January 2014).\n\nWe take the same line as the United States: the austerity policies need to be accompanied by greater flexibility to stimulate growth.\n\nAs quoted in \"Yearning for Change: Italian Diplomacy Just Got Younger\" by Walter Mayr, in Der Spiegel (4 July 2014).\n\nYou can't demand generational change on the one hand and expect 40 years of experience on the other.\n\nAs quoted in \"Yearning for Change: Italian Diplomacy Just Got Younger\" by Walter Mayr, in Der Spiegel (4 July 2014).\n\nMany Italians suspect that this is our last chance for change.\n\nOn the government of Matteo Renzi, as quoted in \"Yearning for Change: Italian Diplomacy Just Got Younger\" by Walter Mayr, in Der Spiegel (4 July 2014).\n\nOn World NGO Day, we celebrate the relentless and invaluable role of civil society organisations in protecting and fighting for fundamental human rights, democracy, and sustainable development for all.\n\nOn the occasion of the World NGO Day in EEAS official statement 2019,Statement by High Representative/ Vice-President Federica Mogherini on the occasion of World NGO Day. eeas.europa.eu ( ).\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
