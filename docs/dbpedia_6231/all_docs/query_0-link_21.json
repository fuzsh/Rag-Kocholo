        "meta_description": "The European Union (EU) Global Strategy, presented in 2016, has triggered the most significant leap forward in the European integration on security and defense in decades. Innovations that followed, such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Defense Fund (EDF), have enhanced the EU’s capabilities and fostered a competitive European defense industry. These moves toward closer defense cooperation on the “old continent” have also relaunched the debate on European strategic autonomy – and raised concerns about (un)intended consequences for NATO and EU-U.S. relations. For some, such initiatives will inevitably lead to the weakening of transatlantic bonds in the long term and a (perceived) choice between Brussels and Washington. Others argue that European strategic autonomy will strengthen transatlantic cooperation by contributing to a more effective burden-sharing between the EU and the U.S. on the world stage. During this study group, the participants are invited to reflect on European strategic autonomy and the transatlantic (im)balance in security and defense. These reflections will be based on three case studies from the term in office of former EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini (2014-2019): The Afghan peace process The Iran nuclear agreement (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) The stabilization of the Western Balkans through political and economic reforms Please register here. A light reading list will be provided and students are expected to come on time and prepared.",
