        "text": "The 2009 Lisbon Treaty did much to strengthen the European Unionâ€™s activities in the area of external action. First, it created the post of High Representative (HR) of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. In 2010, Catherine Ashton became the first person appointed to that position. She was succeeded on the 1st of November 2014 by Federica Mogherini for the period 2014-2019."
