        "text": "As Italy’s populist government draws battle lines in its budget fight with Brussels, there’s a small problem with the Italians vs. EU narrative — half of the EU’s top six jobs are held by … Italians.\n\nEuropean Parliament President Antonio Tajani, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and the EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, were all born in Rome, and all three have worked in national politics.\n\nSo while Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister, tries to cast the budget fight as a standoff over the interests of Italians, no country can claim to wield as much influence in the upper echelons of European power as Italy.\n\nGermany, which is often criticized for having outsized influence in Brussels, holds none of the top jobs (Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is from Luxembourg; Council President Donald Tusk from Poland; and the Eurogroup president, Mário Centeno, is from Portugal).\n\nThe three top Italians in the EU have hardly forgotten which passport they carry.\n\nThe EU has rejected Italy’s draft budget and given Rome three weeks to submit a revision. The Italian government has already said it will not be making changes. That raises the prospect of a lengthy and destructive standoff, in which financial markets could well punish everyone involved. And the EU’s remedies for addressing violations of budget policies are hardly appealing, effectively amounting to financial penalties that only stand to make a deteriorating fiscal situation worse.\n\nBut one response Salvini and others in Rome may not be counting on would be for the EU to deploy its top Italians to defend the bloc’s position as aimed at serving the interests of all Italians, as well as all Europeans.\n\nTajani has already sounded off, telling public broadcaster Rai that Rome’s approach could end badly. “Italy’s last declaration of war did not bring much luck to the citizens,” Tajani said, adding: “This maneuver does not go in the right direction because it will not create new jobs.”\n\nThat sort of reproach from Tajani, whose party, Forza Italia, is at local level a conservative ally of Salvini’s League, prompted officials in the Italian government to begin an uncomfortable calibration of their message. They now assert the problem is that the Italians in senior EU positions were put in place by the likes of former prime ministers Matteo Renzi and Paolo Gentiloni, and are using their posts to act against Italy’s national interests.\n\n“These are three personalities very different from each other,” said Paolo Borchia, a League official based in Brussels, who is very close to Salvini. “But I cannot see among them one close to the League.”\n\nIt is perhaps inevitable that Italians would be on both sides of a fight between Brussels and one of the EU’s founding member countries. At the same time, it makes it far harder for Salvini and his lieutenants to claim that Brussels is biased against Italy, in the way, for instance, that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán claims unfair treatment of Budapest.\n\nAt a news conference after last week’s European Council summit, Juncker noted that he is under some pressure not to let Italy bend the EU’s budget rules — after years of Brussels granting accommodations to Rome. “We were very kind, gentle, and positive when it came to Italy,” Juncker said, adding with a smile, “because Italy is Italy.”\n\nStill, the League seems undeterred in trying to paint the EU, and the Italians who help run it, as the enemy.\n\n“It’s not that we are against Italians in very senior roles within European institutions,” another League official said. “We think the ones currently holding those positions aren’t the right people.”\n\nThe League’s ire is directed not only at Draghi, Mogherini and Tajani, but also at other senior Italian officials they regard as suspect, including the chairman of the European Banking Authority, Andrea Enria, and Mario Nava, a top Commission civil servant who briefly served as head of the Italian markets regulator, Consob, but resigned after coming under relentless pressure from the government in Rome.\n\n“I mean, who is Federica Mogherini?” the League official asked. “Renzi put her there. And how about Draghi and Enria? Both close to the Italian establishment. And to cite the latest scandal: Mario Nava was nominated to Consob by the Gentiloni government and in his role he had to report back to the Commission twice a month. How can you even think these people have our national interest at heart?”\n\nDraghi, Mogherini and Tajani are all widely regarded in Brussels as keeping Italy’s interests close to heart.\n\nThe three top Italians in the EU have hardly forgotten which passport they carry.\n\nTake Tajani’s announcement in Brussels earlier this month of a new EU youth health initiative. Joining him at a news conference were two compatrioti: Francesco Cognetti, of the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome, and Massimiliano Allegri, the head coach of Juventus, the storied Turin football team.\n\nDraghi, as the EU’s central banker, has more stature than anyone to weigh in on Italy’s fiscal situation, and he has done so in recent weeks by urging the government to take a pragmatic approach, level the tone of its rhetoric, and reach a compromise with Brussels.\n\nDraghi’s remarks, while hardly controversial, nonetheless drew a sharp rebuke from Salvini last month, questioning the banker’s patriotism. “I count on Italians in Europe to look after the interests of Italy as happens in all other countries, and that they help and advise and not just criticize,” Salvini said in a statement.\n\nWhile no European official can show overt favoritism to a home country, Draghi, Mogherini and Tajani are all widely regarded in Brussels as keeping Italy’s interests close to heart.\n\nTajani at times has been criticized for spending as much time in Italy as in Brussels or Strasbourg. And Draghi’s overall policies, including the ECB’s quantitative easing program, are generally regarded as having helped create favorable conditions for the Italian bond market in recent years.\n\nMogherini is a bit different: She’s viewed as in-step with Rome by favoring dialogue and engagement with Russia but at the same time it’s pretty easy to find Italian diplomats who are very critical of her and she was frequently at loggerheads with Renzi when he was PM — they are both members of the same party, the Democrats. At the same time, she is also not trusted by the League, or its allies, the 5Star Movement.\n\nAdding to the danger of the brewing budget fight with Brussels is that there are still many officials in the Italian government who are betting that Italy, the eurozone’s third largest economy, is too big to fall and, if necessary, Draghi will step in to prevent a serious crisis.\n\nMeeting foreign journalists in Rome two weeks ago, Paolo Savona, Italy’s Euroskeptic Europe minister, said that “nobody has interest that Italy will get into a deep crisis,” adding that “I’m confident that the ECB will prevent a new deep crisis.”\n\nSuch confidence may be misplaced. Draghi has already warned that if Rome is acting outside of the EU’s rules, the ECB’s hands may be tied."
