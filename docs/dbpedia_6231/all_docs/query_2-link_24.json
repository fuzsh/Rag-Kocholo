        "text": "Minister for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini thanked all the institutions that collaborated on the repatriation of the Italians from Libya. “The arrival in Pisa of the last Air Force flight completes a complex operation that was made possible by the contribution not only of our embassy and the foreign ministry’s Crisis Unit, but also of the close coordination in recent weeks between the inter-forces command and our services”, Mogherini said.\n\n“I would like to thank Ambassador Giuseppe Buccino, and all those who have made this outcome possible. With its decision to keep the diplomatic mission in Tripoli open, Italy played a guiding role and ensured the transfer out not only of 189 Italians and Italo-Libyans who had requested transport after the suspension of commercial flights and the intensification of clashes, but also of 109 foreign nationals. Italy also utilised its own means to arrange for the re-entry into Tripoli of some UN officials, who included the Special Envoy for Libya Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed”, the minister pointed out.\n\nIn recent weeks, 100 Italians and 50 Italo-Libyans left the country on five special flights, while 39 Italian nationals were transferred on land. Of the 109 foreign nationals assisted by Italy, 57 were European citizens.\n\nThe minister continued, “there are now 100 Italian nationals remaining on Libyan soil, who are there for their jobs and expressly requested to remain, but that could in any case avail themselves of the support of our embassy. Ambassador Buccino continues to work with the maximum commitment on behalf of the security of the Italian community and interests in Libya, and to support the difficult political process under way”."
