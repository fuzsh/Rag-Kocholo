        "text": "For Iran as nuclear power & EU under sharia\n\nFew facts about Mogherini\n\nPart form Mogherini’s speech:\n\nIslam holds a place in our Western societies. Islam belongs in Europe. It holds a place in Europe’s history, in our culture, in our food and what matters most in Europe’s present and future. Like it or not, this is the reality.\n\nCan we draw a conclusion from her speech, that something that first started as a love for Islam, developed in admiration toward sharia?\n\nWe need to show some humble respect for diversity. Diversity is the core feature of our European history, and it is our strength. … We need to understand diversity, understand complexity. … For this reason I am not afraid to say that political Islam should be part of the picture.\n\nStarting with her graduation paper “the relationship between religion and politics within Islam” – what later developed as statement that “political Islam”, the proponents of Sharia, must have a legitimate place in Europe, only confirms that her love for Islam grows through the years, which makes her non-objective in her decision making, and also unfit for the position she’s holding. Basically, she hates everything that’s western.\n\nFor those of who don’t know ISIS is governed by sharia. Do you like what ISIS does?\n\nExamples for some penal correctional measures according to sharia law…\n\nOn June 24, 2015 (shortly before her trip to Vienna) Mogherini has held a speech:\n\nWestern media like to refer to Da’esh with the world “medieval”. This does not help much to understand the real nature of the threat we are facing. Da’esh is something completely new. This is a modern movement, reinterpreting religion in an innovative and radical way.\n\nThan, on July 14, 2015 Mogherini went to Vienna to work with Obama to close the “nuclear deal” which means – help Iran build the atomic bomb and financially enable Iran to expand the support of global terrorism. She was even rewarded for her contribution in destabilizing Middle East, Europe and potential World War III. How nice!\n\nThe position she holds was arranged by a small circle of evil man, (who only want money, and don’t care about peace or stability) who noticed her ignorance, as a great opportunity to deliver their evil anti-Europe, anti-America and anti-Israel plan. That is why she’s welcomed in Iran!\n\nMogherini is appointed to say “thumbs up”, to every transaction with Iran. She is enabling a huge amount of money to get to the designated IRGC and other terrorist organizations like Hamas, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Al-Qaeda etc.. Now she takes the right to provide companies legal cover to operate in Iran. This statute will allow European firms to recover damages from American measures and nullify any court ruling against them. Awesome!\n\nLess worries for the greedy people who think only about filling their pockets with money, and don’t care about the constant disrespect of the so-called “nuclear deal”.\n\nMaybe she’s trying to impose the thinking that something is changed in Iran?! But before the “nuclear deal” agreement and to this moment Iran is governed by the same regime, with the same hopes and dreams. Make money through illegal transactions with European companies, so the regime could finance different terrorist cells, also strengthen their nuclear power plant and attack first Israel, than the one guilty for making all of this possible – Europe.\n\nDoes Mogherini supports this? This is what’s happening in Iran!\n\nIran’s violations of the “nuclear deal” are everyday news! How is she going to protect the European citizens(that didn’t elected her!) as European Union Security Policy High Representative, when Iran will strength its military power and decides to attack some EU country?\n\nThe truth about Iran"
