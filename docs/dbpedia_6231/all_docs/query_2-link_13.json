        "text": "EU leaders have chosen Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk as the new president of the European Council and Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the new EU foreign-policy chief.\n\nThe choices were announced by the outgoing president of the European Council, Herman Von Rompuy, as EU heads of state met on August 30 in Brussels.\n\nTusk said in a press conference following the announcement that the EU needed a courageous but not radical position on the conflict in Ukraine and that the end goal should be peace.\n\nHe also said that it was possible to combine fiscal discipline and economic growth in Europe and pledged to address the concerns of Britain, where Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on continued EU membership by 2017.\n\nMogherini, speaking at the same press conference, said the EU must keep the path to a diplomatic solution of the Ukraine crisis open even as it worked on new sanctions against Russia.\n\n\"As we think and we work on the level of sanctions, we also have to keep the diplomatic way open...hoping that the combination, a wise combination, can be effective,\" she said.\n\nTusk has been Poland's prime minister for two terms.\n\nThe 57-year-old center-right politician from what is by far the biggest of the ex-communist EU states is an economic liberal and advocate of free trade.\n\nHis reported weak point is that he speaks little English and no French, making it harder for him to communicate on behalf of the EU to a wide audience.\n\nHis appointment to chair and steer policymaking meetings of EU leaders is a victory for the 10 ex-communist Central and Eastern European countries that joined the European Union a decade ago and which have demanded that one of the top jobs go to a candidate from their region.\n\nIn the Ukraine crisis, Poland alongside Britain has led the drive for tougher sanctions against Moscow.\n\nPrior to being named Italy's foreign minister in February, the 41-year-old Mogherini was a member of the Italian parliament since 2008.\n\nHer foreign-policy experience consists of stints representing her country in the parliamentary assemblies of both NATO and the Council of Europe and as a fellow at the German Marshall Fund.\n\nShe is fluent in English, French, and also speaks some Spanish.\n\nThe center-left politician was widely expected to get the EU foreign-policy-chief job back in July, but her candidacy was scuttled by Poland and Lithuania, who argued that she was too soft on Russia during the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThe fact that Mogherini's first foreign trip since Italy took over the EU presidency in July was to Moscow to see Russian President Vladimir Putin exacerbated the issue.\n\nEU foreign-policy chief Catherine Ashton will step down at the end of October.\n\nPresident Herman Van Rompuy's term also expires this year.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters and AFP\n\nAgents of the FBI have raided and searched the Virginia home of Dmitri Simes, a prominent political commentator and author who hosts a current-affairs program on Russia’s state-run Channel One television, the newspaper Rappahannock News reported on August 16.\n\nThe FBI told the paper the search began on August 13 but declined to comment further, RFE/RL's Russian Service reported.\n\nSimes told the paper he is currently out of the country, but was \"puzzled and concerned\" by the FBI's action. He told the Russian state news agency TASS on August 16 that the reports that FBI agents were at his home were true, although he had not been officially notified.\n\nSimes was born in Moscow in 1947 and emigrated to the United States in 1973. He served as an informal adviser to former U.S. President Richard Nixon and regularly traveled with Nixon to Russia and other former Soviet countries.\n\nIn 1994, Nixon named him to head the Center for the National Interest, which at the time was called the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom. Simes retired from the position in 2022.\n\nSimes also advised the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump and arranged an important 2016 foreign-policy speech in which Trump outlined a vision for greater cooperation with Russia.\n\nSimes's name was mentioned more than 100 times in a 2019 report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller entitled Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Presidential Election.\n\nSimes moderated a question-and-answer session with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2023.\n\nEarlier this month, Fox News reported that FBI agents had raided the New York home of Scott Ritter, a former UN weapons inspector in Iraq who has been a frequent contributor to Russian government media including RT and Sputnik. An FBI spokesperson told Fox the search was part of an \"ongoing\" investigation.\n\nRitter has supported Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine and in January he addressed thousands of Chechen soldiers on a central square in the Chechen capital, Grozny.\n\nIn June, U.S. authorities seized Ritter's passport and prevented him from travelling to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nWith reporting by TASS\n\nKyiv will not create special camps for Russian civilians who want to evacuate amid an ongoing incursion by Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions, Ukraine's human rights commissioner Dmytro Lubinets told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service on August 16.\n\nLubinets also said that he did not envisage any threats to the security of the civilian population from the Russian region on the territory of Ukraine and that he thinks the number of civilians willing to evacuate to Ukraine will be limited.\n\n\"We do not expect that there will be a large number of people willing to come to us, if any. But I am definitely not worried about the fact that it will be dangerous for the civilian population from Kursk region.... We have offered each and every resident of Kursk the option to evacuate from this territory if they wish,\" Lubinets said.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:02:38 0:00\n\n\"Ukraine will open humanitarian corridors.

It was damaged by Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023 and has frequently been closed during security incidents.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said on August 15 that its air defenses had \"repelled\" an overnight attack that included 12 U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles and targeted the Kerch Bridge. All the missiles were reportedly \"destroyed,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe claim could not be independently verified.\n\nThree drones were reportedly shot down near the port city of Sevastopol, which is home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\nIn all, the ministry said on August 15 it had \"neutralized\" 5 Ukrainian flying drones and five sea-based drones overnight.\n\n\"Mi-8 and Ka-29 helicopters from the Black Sea Fleet's marine air force destroyed five unmanned boats heading toward the Crimean Peninsula,\" the ministry's statement said.\n\nThere were social-media reports of blasts near the Chornomorsk district and the Crimean capital, Simferopol.\n\nThere were no reports of serious damage, and the Ukrainian military did not comment on the reports.\n\nElsewhere, authorities in the Siberian region of Irkutsk said that one crew member of a Tu-22M3 bomber that crashed during a training exercise on August 14 had died. Three others were rescued and have been hospitalized, Irkutsk region Governor Igor Kobzev wrote on Telegram.\n\nThe cause of the crash was not reported by Russian authorities.\n\nThe European Union has told Serbia that maintaining ties with Russia during its war of aggression against Ukraine is not compatible with EU values and the accession process.\n\n\"The European Union has been crystal clear with our partners: Relations with Russia cannot be business as usual after Russia's unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine,\" an EU statement said on August 15 in response to an RFE/RL inquiry.\n\nBrussels also said that the EU \"wants to count on all candidate countries as reliable European partners for common principles, values, security, and prosperity.\"\n\nThe reaction followed meetings between Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Kremlin officials in Moscow this week along with claims of intelligence cooperation with Russia.\n\nVulin has met several government officials during a four-day visit to Moscow, including First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov on August 15.\n\n\"Relations between the two countries, despite numerous challenges, are at a high level,\" according to a statement from the Serbian government after the meeting.\n\nVulin and Manturov “reviewed the outcomes of the discussions between the Serbian Vice Prime Minister and Russian ministers…and agreed that, despite the good cooperation, there is room for further improvement,\" the statement said.\n\nVulin also met on August 15 with Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilyov and expressed gratitude for natural gas deliveries that he said ensure Serbia's energy security.\n\nSerbia is entirely dependent on Russian gas but has taken the first steps toward energy diversification.\n\nVulin met on August 14 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow to discuss \"further improving the Serbian-Russian strategic partnership,\" the Serbian government said in a statement.\n\nHe repeated that he is proud that Serbia is \"not part of the anti-Russian hysteria\" and has not joined the Western sanctions on Moscow imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the start of his visit Vulin thanked Russian security structures \"for the warning about preparations for mass unrest and attempts at a coup\" in Serbia.\n\nThe government has described recent mass protests against lithium mining as a \"coup attempt,\" and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused unnamed Western countries of being behind the protests.\n\nVucic said warnings from Russian services had arrived in Serbia before a mass protest on August 11 advising that the ultimate goal of the demonstration was the overthrow of the country's leadership.\n\nThe Serbian government and the Security Information Agency (BIA) have not responded to RFE/RL's request for information that was provided to Belgrade by Russian services.\n\nThere has also been no answer to the question of what evidence supports the claim that the lithium protests are an attempt to overthrow the government and that they are supported by Western countries.\n\nOrganizers have repeatedly denied that the protest aimed to overthrow the government.\n\n\"Government changes through elections; if anyone expected to come to power on our backs, they were mistaken. The aim of the protest is to gather people and show the world how many are against the lithium mining project,\" Nebojsa Petkovic of the organization We Will Not Give Up Jadar, told RFE/RL.\n\nThe organization was formed in the village of Gornje Nedeljice in western Serbia, where multinational giant Rio Tinto plans begin mining for lithium.\n\nOpposition to the project has come from citizens who believe it could have negative environmental impacts.\n\nPetkovic said We Will Not Give Up Jadar \"is not funded by foreigners but by the people of Serbia who donate.\"\n\nRomanian gymnast Ana Maria Barbosu will be awarded the bronze medal in the women's floor exercise on August 16 in a ceremony in Bucharest, but the controversy over who finished third in the competition at the Paris Olympics is far from settled.\n\nThe Romanian Olympics Sports Committee announced the ceremony in a press release on August 13, saying that Octavian Morariu, a member of the International Olympic Committee for Romania, and Mihai Covaliu, president of the Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee, will present the medal to Barbosu.\n\nThe event will take place on the esplanade of the Olympic House on August 16 starting at 3:30 p.m. Bucharest time.\n\nThe controversy arose after the medal was awarded to U.S. gymnast Jordan Chiles after her coach appealed her score at the end of the competition on August 5.\n\nChiles's score was increased to 13.766 from 13.666 after U.S. coach Cecile Landi appealed a deduction that Chiles had received on one element, known as a tour jete full. The appeal, known as an inquiry in gymnastics, wiped away the deduction, moved Chiles into third, and knocked Barbosu off the podium.\n\nDays later the Court of Arbitration (CAS) ruled that the inquiry was made past the 1-minute limit allowed under the rules of the International Gymnastics Federation, thus reinstating Chiles's original 13.666 score. The ruling bumped Barbosu back into the bronze position.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed on August 11 that Chiles must return the medal, but it is still unknown if Chiles has done so or if Barbosu will be receiving a new one.\n\nChiles called the CAS panel's decision that she must return the medal “unjust” and a “significant blow” in a message posted on social media on August 15.\n\n“I am now confronted with one of the most challenging moments of my career,” Chiles posted. “Believe me when I say I have had many. I will approach the challenge as I have others -- and will make every effort to ensure that justice is done. I believe that at the end of this journey, the people in control will do the right thing.”\n\nShe also said that \"unprompted racially driven attacks on social media\" had added to the heartbreak, calling them \"wrong and extremely hurtful.\"\n\nWhile the IOC said it would respect the CAS ruling, USA Gymnastics said in a statement on August 12 that it would \"continue to pursue every possible avenue and appeal process, including to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, to ensure the just scoring, placement, and medal award for Jordan.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement quoted by the Washington Post on August 14 that it had time-stamped video proving Landi initiated the inquiry 47 seconds after Chiles's score was posted. USA Gymnastics said the footage was not available to the organization at the time of the hearing, and said that it was given less than 24 hours' notice of the hearing.\n\nUSA Gymnastics said it was notified by the CAS on August 12 that its rules do not allow for the award to be reconsidered \"even when conclusive new evidence is presented,\" adding that it was \"deeply disappointed by the notification.\"\n\nSince the CAS ruling, reports have surfaced that the chair of the panel appointed by the court to rule on the decision about the bronze medal originally awarded to Chiles included an official with ties to Romania. The reports cited documents that show Hamid Gharavi, a lawyer, previously represented Romania in international disputes.\n\nYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, said on August 15 that a three-page document provided by Russian authorities offered no convincing explanation for his death in prison six months ago.\n\nNavalnaya said in a video posted on YouTube that she had received \"the first and only\" official document on the cause and circumstances of Navalny's death: a three-page document stating it had not been the result of a crime and there were consequently no grounds for a criminal investigation.\n\nNavalnaya, who lives in exile, said everyone wants to know what really happened: how Navalny died, who was with him at the time, what medical aid was provided, and other questions such as whether there were attempts to save him and why it took so long to release his body.\n\n“There are still a thousand questions hanging in the air,” she said.\n\nNavalny died on February 16 in an Arctic prison where he was serving a lengthy sentence on what he and his supporters said were politically motivated charges.\n\nNavalnaya said lawyers for Navalny have been seeking autopsy results, medical documents, and video footage from his cell and the courtyard and medical office of the prison \"and after six months, this is all we've been given -- a half-page of explanation.\"\n\nThe document attributes his death to a \"combined illness,\" including a gall-bladder infection, a slipped disc, and staphylococcus infection, with cardiac arrhythmia ultimately causing death.\n\n\"When I first saw these pathetic three pages, I couldn't believe my eyes,\" Navalnaya said. \"It's another pathetic attempt to cover up what really happened: a murder.\"\n\nNavalnaya noted that every third Russian had illnesses of the kind described in the document but did not die from them. In addition, Navalny underwent a comprehensive medical examination when he entered the prison that had turned up no evidence of such ailments.\n\nShe also recalled how the day before his death he was seen in a video attending a court hearing and \"feeling fine, smiling, even joking with the judge,\" she said.\n\nThe document, which has been posted in full on Navalny's website, was signed by investigative official Aleksandr Varapayev. Varapayev was the official in the Russian Investigative Committee who refused to hand over Navalny's body to his mother unless she agreed to hold his funeral in private. According to Russian media reports, Varapayev was promoted after the events.\n\nLeonid Volkov, an opposition activist who was close to Navalny, also criticized the official document. The investigators took six months to formulate their version of events, and it revealed nothing, he wrote on Telegram.\n\nNavalnaya remains under an arrest warrant in Russia that was upheld on August 7 by a Moscow City Court. She is charged with taking part in an extremist group's activities and was added to Russia's wanted list in July.\n\nThe arrest warrant was issued less than two weeks after Navalnaya was elected to head the Human Rights Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and protecting human rights around the world.\n\nKosovar President Vjosa Osmani said on August 15 the country must ensure that the main bridge in Mitrovica, which divides the northern city into an Albanian-majority southern side and a Serb-majority northern side, is opened in a way that does not provoke conflict with Kosovo's international partners.\n\nThe country’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, announced at the beginning of August plans to open the bridge to vehicle traffic, a move that was opposed by members of both NATO and Quint, an informal decision-making group consisting of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain.\n\nThe announcement sparked protests by Serbs in northern Kosovo, who expressed concerns that the move would increase ethnic tensions and impact their safety.\n\nKosovo and Serbia reached an agreement about the bridge in Brussels in 2014 and the European Union funded its revitalization worth 1.5 million euros. The bridge was supposed to open in 2017, but it is currently open only for pedestrians.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to Pristina, Jeffrey Hovenier, has said that, while the United States believes the bridge should ultimately be open to vehicles, \"this is not the time,\" due to security concerns.\n\n\"We believe there's a real risk associated with taking this action right now,\" he said in an interview with RFE/RL's Kosovo Service on August 13, citing potential violence and threats to NATO soldiers, including Americans.\n\nThe European Union has repeated its stance that the issue of opening of the bridge in Mitrovica should be resolved within the framework of official dialogue.\n\nOsmani said that the bridge in Mitrovica \"must absolutely be opened.\"\n\n“But we must ensure that when it is opened, it remains open permanently, [and] that its opening doesn’t lead to a much greater NATO presence there,” she told reporters on August 15 during a visit to the southern town of Viti.\n\nNATO forces have been operating in Kosovo to maintain peace and stability since 1999, when the Western military alliance intervened to stop escalating violence being perpetrated by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians in what was then a province of Serbia.\n\nKosovo went on to declare independence in 2008, but neither Serbia, nor its traditional ally Russia have recognized its sovereignty.\n\nSoldiers from NATO's mission to Kosovo, KFOR, are currently stationed on the bridge in Mitrovica, while members of the Kosovo Police patrol nearby.\n\n“Is it in Kosovo's interest to see conflict between Kosovo police and an American soldier? I don't believe there is any Albanian who would agree with that. We have no reason for a conflict with our allies. They have saved us,\" Osmani added.\n\nKFOR has said it could \"adjust\" its presence \"as needed and will not hesitate to act in response to any significant security developments and in accordance with our UN mandate.\"\n\nKurti has defended the plans to open the bridge, saying his government will continue consultations with international partners.\n\nOsmani, however, dismissed the EU position that the issue of opening of the bridge in Mitrovica should be resolved within the official dialogue with Serbia.\n\n“I oppose in every way the discussion of the bridge opening in Brussels. We have no reason to ask Serbia,\" she said.\n\nOsmani was elected president in 2021 with the support of Kurti's party, Vetevendosje (Self-Determination), but the two have recently disagreed on issues like the level of coordination with Kosovo's international allies.\n\nKosovo's plan to open the bridge in Mitrovica comes amid rising tensions in the Serb-majority north of the country.\n\nEmbed

August, the Kosovar authorities closed down nine branches of the Serbian post office in the north after determining that they were operating illegally and without a license, a move that was criticized by the United States and the European Union, which have mediated Serbia-Kosovo relations for over a decade.\n\nThere are an estimated 120,000 ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo, mostly in the north, and many still receive benefits or pensions from Serbia.\n\nBulgarian President Rumen Radev has signed into law a recently adopted amendment banning LGBT \"promotion\" in schools despite calls to veto it from Bulgarian intellectuals as rights groups staged a protest against the measure on August 15.\n\nThe law, which bans \"propaganda, promotion, or incitement\" in the education system of \"ideas and views related to nontraditional sexual orientation and/or gender identity other than the biological one,\" will be published in the August 16 issue of Bulgaria’s State Gazette.\n\nHundreds of Bulgarian academics urged President Rumen Radev in an open letter to veto the amendment.\n\nThe changes aim to tackle \"a problem that does not exist\" in Bulgaria's school system, the letter says, and would instead \"normalize political attacks\" on the LGBT community.\n\nThe Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Michael O'Flaherty, had also called on Radev not to sign the law, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" by the ban.\n\nRadev did not comment on the calls, but his press service said he \"has expressed his attitude to the changes\" by signing them into law.\n\nHundreds of people demanded Radev's resignation at a protest in Sofia on August 15, chanting \"Fascism kills, power covers up\" and \"Shame on you.\"\n\nThe protesters initially demanded the president veto the \"disgraceful\" bill, but after it became clear that Radev signed it into law, the protesters demanded his resignation and its repeal.\n\n\"We are here because we will not tolerate falling into the black hole of fascism,\" said one of the protesters, addressing the crowd in front of the presidency.\n\nA counterprotest of the pro-Russian party Vazrazhdane took place simultaneously at a different venue in the capital.\n\nThe separate protests took place under an increased police presence.\n\nThe amendment was proposed by the pro-Russian far-right Revival party and passed with 159 votes in favor, 20 against, and 10 abstentions.\n\nLawmakers also voted on another amendment to the education law, which defines \"nontraditional sexual orientation\" as \"different from the generally accepted and established notions...[of] attraction between persons of opposite sexes.\"\n\nThe text also passed but with a smaller majority.\n\nSupporters of the amendments have said they reflect the spirit of Bulgaria's constitution, which stipulates marriage is only between a man and a woman and is based on Orthodox Christian values.\n\nThe Bulgarian Orthodox Church welcomed the amendments in a statement published on August 8.\n\nBut many rights groups have criticized the move, calling it \"an attack\" on children's rights.\n\n\"The proponents of the law, the Revival party, and all those who voted in favor of the law claim that this is to protect young people,\" LGBT advocacy group ILGA-Europe said in a statement.\n\n\"However, the truth is that this is an attack on the rights of children, particularly LGBTI children,\" the statement said.\n\nDomestic and international LGBT groups have said the wording of the Bulgarian legal changes has similarities to \"LGBT propaganda\" laws in Russia and Hungary, which have been criticized by rights groups for violating freedom of expression and promoting discrimination and abuse against LGBT people.\n\nResearchers and human rights organizations routinely place Bulgaria among the worst countries in Europe for its record on LGBT rights.\n\nA Russian court in Yekaterinburg has sentenced dual U.S.-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina to 12 years in prison after convicting her of treason for transferring $51 to a Ukrainian aid charity in early 2022.\n\nThe verdict was rendered on August 15 by Sverdlovsk regional court Judge Andrei Mineyev after prosecutors had sought a 15-year prison term for Karelina, who is also known by her marital surname Khavana.\n\nKarelina’s lawyer, Mikhail Mushailov, said his client admitted making the donation, but planned to appeal the verdict.\n\nThe verdict came one day after a Moscow court gave a U.S. citizen identified as Joseph Tater a 15-day jail term for \"petty hooliganism.\"\n\nKarelina, 33, moved to the United States in 2015, married a U.S. citizen, and received U.S. citizenship in 2021.\n\nThe U.S. State Department is aware of Karelina’s verdict, spokesman Vedant Patel said, adding that Russia \"has a track record of…not recognizing their (dual nationals') American citizen status and frankly being uncooperative when it comes to…meeting their obligations under consular conventions.\"\n\nShe was arrested in Yekaterinburg in January on suspicion of petty hooliganism.\n\nOn February 7, however, treason charges were filed against her after investigators learned that on the second day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, she had transferred $51 to Razom, a Ukrainian aid group that helps civilians affected by the war.\n\nPatel reiterated that donating to a nonprofit, NGO, or supporting the Ukrainian cause and its people, especially on American soil, is not a crime. Patel also strongly condemn the Kremlin's \"escalating domestic repression.\"\n\nLawyer Mushailov said prosecutors found evidence of the donation on her mobile phone.\n\nIn February, Razom co-founder Dora Chomiak appealed to the U.S. government to \"continue doing everything possible to demand that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin free all those unjustly detained in Russia.\"\n\nMineyev was the same judge who in July sentenced U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich to 16 years in prison on espionage charges.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal correspondent was then included in a large prisoner exchange on August 1 that also included RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, and several imprisoned Russian dissidents.\n\nAccording to rights groups, nearly 900 Russians have been convicted of treason, espionage, or cooperation with foreign governments since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt least 1.4 million girls in Afghanistan have been denied access to secondary education since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural agency, said on August 15.\n\n\"In just three years, the de facto authorities have almost wiped out two decades of steady progress for education in Afghanistan, and the future of an entire generation is now in jeopardy,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nIt comes as the Taliban marked three years since its forces seized Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, on August 15, 2021, after the U.S.-backed government collapsed and its leaders fled into exile.\n\nSince the Taliban's return to power, women have been squeezed from public life -- banned from many jobs as well as parks and gyms -- and barred from secondary and higher education.\n\nThe restrictions amount to what the United Nations has described as \"gender apartheid.\"\n\nThere are now nearly 2.5 million girls deprived of their right to education, representing 80 percent of Afghan school-age girls, UNESCO said. This represents an increase of 300,000 since the previous count carried out by the UN agency in April 2023.\n\n\"As a result of bans imposed by the de facto authorities, at least 1.4 million girls have been deliberately denied access to secondary education since 2021,\" UNESCO said.\n\nAccess to primary education has also fallen sharply, with 1.1 million fewer girls and boys attending school, the agency added. It blamed the drop on the authorities' decision to ban female teachers from teaching boys as well as the lack of incentive for parents to send children to school.\n\nThe agency is \"alarmed by the harmful consequences of this increasingly massive drop-out rate, which could lead to a rise in child labor and early marriage.\"\n\nEnrolment in higher education is equally concerning, the statement said, adding that the number of university students had decreased by 53 percent since 2021.\n\nUNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay urged the international community to remain mobilized \"to obtain the unconditional reopening of schools and universities to Afghan girls and women.\"\n\nLack of access to education has been among the main points of criticism by Afghans toward the Taliban authorities.\n\n\"There are those who are not literate enough, and more importantly, a part of society, women, are deprived of education, and this is a big problem for the people of Afghanistan,\" a male resident of the northern Balkh Province who preferred not to be named due to security concerns, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\n\"The issues of education -- women's education and work -- and their participation at national and international level have been completely nullified and pushed to the sidelines,\" a female resident of Kabul, who also preferred not to be named, said.\n\nThe Taliban celebrates their return to power both in mid-August around the date Kabul fell and at the end of the month, when the last U.S.-led international troops left Afghanistan.\n\nThe withdrawal, agreed by the United States and the Taliban on February 29, 2020, allowed the radical Islamist movement's return to power 20 years after being ousted by U.S. forces following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\nThe Taliban government remains unrecognized by any other state.\n\nWATCH: Rights groups have documented targeted killings, disappearances, and extrajudicial arrests of hundreds of former Afghan service personnel, while RFE/RL has spoken to two women who say they live in fear due to their past roles in the military.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:32 0:00\n\nInternational aid organizations have warned that millions of Afghans struggle in \"one of the world's largest and most complex humanitarian crises, three years after the change in power.\"\n\n\"Heavily dependent on humanitarian aid, Afghans are trapped in cycles of poverty, displacement, and despair,\" a statement by 10 aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, Islamic Relief Worldwide, and the International Rescue Committee -- said on August 13.\n\nWomen and girls are among the most seriously affected by this humanitarian crisis, Human Rights Watch has said.

Among other topics, he reported on the government's use of forced labor to harvest cotton in the Dashoguz area, food shortages, and wage arrears among state officials.\n\nIn December 2016, he and his mother were arrested and accused of possession of chewing tobacco, which is illegal in the authoritarian former Soviet republic. RFE/RL reported that authorities in Dashoguz had learned Allashov's identity the day of his arrest.\n\nSources told RFE/RL that he was tortured by police in Koneurgench, including with electric shocks. Police also questioned his wife and two young children.\n\nIn February 2017, Allashov and his mother were given three-year suspended prison sentences, following calls by diplomats and rights groups for their release. Fearing for his safety, Allashov stopped working with RFE/RL.\n\nAllashov was arrested again in October 2019 and was beaten during several hours of interrogation.
