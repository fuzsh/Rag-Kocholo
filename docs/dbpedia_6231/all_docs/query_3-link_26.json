        "text": "For us, inexperience is a virtue,” a well-placed Italian official responded when asked in July by a clutch of journalists about the professional qualifications of Federica Mogherini, the woman whom Italy was aggressively advocating should be the next chief of the European Union’s foreign policy. On Saturday (30 August), Mogherini was duly appointed until 2019, leaving Europe with five years to discover the full implications of selecting someone who has now been a government minister for just six months.\n\nThe Italian official’s praise for inexperience echoed the ‘cult of youth’ created by Matteo Renzi, who in February seized on Italians’ desire for a break from a past scarred by Silvio Berlusconi, and became – as he likes to stress – the socialist with the biggest popular mandate in Europe. To his credit, Renzi has brought about some real change, including the promotion of women. But it would be hasty to take his embrace of a new, inexperienced generation as a sign that he is championing a break with the past.\n\nFor one thing, Renzi’s praise of youth is a form of self-defence – he is just 39 (in Saturday’s press conference, Mogherini in turn invoked Renzi’s youth to fend off questions about her own inexperience). For another, his style – including turbo-charged affability, brass and bombast – owes much to Berlusconi. More significantly, much of his policy – and this is where Mogherini comes in – is hardly refreshingly novel.\n\nMogherini is not a representative of some new, invigorated Italian foreign policy. Rather, the 41-year-old has spent her career in the bosom of the left-wing establishment, eventually, just months ago, rising to its head (though Mogherini seemed anxious to stretch those credentials to the limit when she said on Saturday that “it is now, this year, 20 years that I am involved in European and foreign work”).\n\nMogherini is, in short, a top graduate of a traditional, closed, business-heavy – and, in many eyes, discredited – Italian foreign policy. If she reflects her training, she can be expected to talk strongly about issues in which the EU’s influence is weak, such as the Middle East, and weakly in areas where the EU’s influence is vital, such as Ukraine. Based on her six months as foreign minister, she is keeping with that training: in EU ministerial meetings, she has been among the most passionate of the doves on EU policy towards Russia, and, on a visit to Moscow in July, went further than other EU foreign ministers in expressing dovishness in public.\n\nTwo consequences springing from Mogherini’s twin principal features – a lack of ministerial experience and her identification with Italy’s traditionally close ties with Russia – can be confidently predicted. Firstly, the EU’s member states will be very wary about giving her much rein to steer EU foreign policy. Secondly, reluctance to cede much influence to Mogherini – and, therefore, to the European External Action Service (EEAS), the institution that she heads – may encourage Mogherini to pay more attention to a second institution, the European Commission, of which she is now vice-president.\n\nIf she masters the Commission aspect of her job, her impact could be significant, since many of the EU’s policies with the most significant international impact are marshalled by the Commission. But the challenges of coping with a large and complex institution such as the Commission or of completing the formation of the three-year-old EEAS will sorely test her lack of ministerial experience.\n\nWherever she looks – from the tests the world is throwing at her, to member states, to the Commission and the EEAS – Mogherini faces uphill struggles for which she is not obviously well suited. This is perhaps a gloomy take, but deep wariness is just one of the challenges that Mogherini now faces because of her inexperience\n\nA profile of Federica Mogherini can be found here."
