        "text": "Brussels agencies and College of Europe launch InclusivEU initiative\n\nPrivate sector public affairs agencies and College of Europe join forces to tackle lack of existing diversity in the Brussels talent pipeline\n\nDedicated scholarship to support broader diversity in the wider EU ecosystem\n\nBrussels, 10 October 2023: The EU offices of BCW, Dentons Global Advisors and FTI Consulting (the ‘Founding Sponsors’), in partnership with the College of Europe (the ‘College’) in Brugge, Belgium, have today launched InclusivEU, a new diversity and inclusion initiative. Its objectives are twofold:\n\nImprove social and cultural mobility in higher education; and\n\nContribute to the diversification of the future talent pipeline in public affairs in Brussels.\n\nAs part of its foundational year, InclusivEU has awarded an inaugural scholarship to a selected student studying at the College, with a future opportunity to take two subsequent renumerated internships with the Founding Sponsors. The successful student was selected from an initial shortlist of 45 applications.\n\nThe InclusivEU initiative seeks to contribute to diversifying the College of Europe, the EU institutions and the broader European ecosystem, in terms of ability, class, culture, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, race, religion, sexual orientation or socio-economic background.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Federica Mogherini, the Rector of the College said: “The EU is increasingly diverse but the European institutions, where the future of our continent is shaped, are not yet. The College of Europe, as a great stepping stone for a successful career in EU affairs, has an important role to play in filling that gap. We are committed to helping transform the field of EU affairs into a truly diverse and inclusive environment. We are glad that we are embarking on this process with committed partners with whom we share this core objective to make the EU institutional environment more diverse.”\n\nWhile InclusivEU was started by BCW, Dentons Global Advisors and FTI Consulting, the ambition is to encourage other agencies and organisations to participate. By growing the number of sponsoring partners and the size of the associated scholarship, the initiative will be able to support more students in the future.\n\nHans Hack, Head of FTI Consulting’s Brussels office, said: “It’s the start of a journey. We appreciate that the challenge is much bigger than one programme, but it is important that EU public affairs agencies are part of the conversation and work together to address it.”\n\nKieran O’Keeffe, Partner at Dentons Global Advisors, added: “The focus in the EU Bubble is too often on ensuring we represent the 27 member states and not on reflecting the diversity of the societies within them.”\n\nAndrew Cecil, CEO of BCW Brussels, added: “As part of the estimated 35,000 consultants working in Brussels, we have a responsibility to take tangible steps and turn talk into action. Our ambition is to grow this initiative, but we can only do this with more partners. The more organisations that join us, the more impactful this initiative will become, allowing us to award more scholarships in the future.”\n\nFuture applications will come from those applying to study at the College. The next opportunity will be for the academic year 2024/2025 and will be open from 12 October 2023 and close on 16 January 2024.\n\nFor more information on InclusivEU and the scholarship programme, please contact Valentin Dupouey-Sterdyniak, Director of Communications, External Relations & Events at the College of Europe (valentin.dupouey@coleurope.eu) or go to the dedicated page on the College of Europe’s website at https://www.coleurope.eu/diversity-scholarship.\n\nFor all media enquiries, please contact:\n\nMarcus Pepperell, Marcus.Pepperell@FTIConsulting.com\n\nMelissa Marlette Kresse, melissa.kresse@dentonsglobaladvisors.com\n\nGeorgina Unsworth, georgina.unsworth@bcw-global.com\n\nValentin Dupouey-Sterdyniak, valentin.dupouey@coleurope.eu\n\nAbout College of Europe\n\nThe College of Europe is the oldest and leading postgraduate institute of European studies.
