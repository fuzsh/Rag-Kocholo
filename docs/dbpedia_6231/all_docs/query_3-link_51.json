        "text": "BRUSSELS -- European Union foreign-policy chief Federica Mogherini says that the EU \"could not take the issue of hybrid threat[s] more seriously.\"\n\nMogherini was speaking ahead of the October 2 inauguration of the new European Center of Excellence For Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki.\n\nThe center, which is a Finnish initiative, brings together 10 EU member states as well as Norway and the United States to focus on research, training, education, and exercises.\n\nBoth NATO and the EU will be part of the steering board of the center, which Mogherini described as \"an essential contribution to our capacity to respond to crisis.\"\n\nThe EU has in recent months ramped up its activities to counter hybrid threats -- a reference to a mix of conventional and nonconventional means used by an adversary to achieve its objectives.\n\nLast month, EU defense ministers held a cyberexercise aimed at testing the bloc's ability to respond to a potential attack by hackers on its military structures.\n\nLast week, various EU institutions launched their first-ever exercise to test the EU's crisis response in countering cyberattacks and hybrid-warfare threats.\n\nThe European Commission recently also proposed to establish a new, beefed-up European cybersecurity agency.\n\nMogherini noted that the EU's Stratcom East team, which deals with Russian disinformation, had uncovered over 3,000 disinformation cases since its foundation two years ago.\n\nShe said the EU would continue to \"talk about what we are doing, to explain with a maximum of transparency our policies, spread the real stories about the positive impact that our European action has the lives of so many people.\"\n\nEthnic Germans from the former Soviet Union have held their first international \"memory marathon\" to raise awareness of the deportation and persecution of the group under brutal dictator Josef Stalin and through into post-Soviet Russia.\n\nThe chairman of the Association of Ethnic Germans of Ukraine Vyacheslav Bodrov (aka Redekopp) told RFE/RL that the event, which began on August 26 and ended on August 28, was held in Germany, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the United States.\n\n\"This is the first [international] event held by ethnic Germans from the post-Soviet space to express solidarity in different countries and attract attention to the big problem,\" he said of the single largest and one of the oldest diaspora groups in the former Soviet Union that is connected to a foreign state.\n\n\"Through the marathon, we remind about the suffering of the German minority in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia, and also focus on the destinies of the successors of those who survived the deportation,\" Bodrov added.\n\nSubscribe To RFE/RL's 'The Rundown'\n\nGet a curated digest of all our essential news, features, and analysis, plus our best visual journalism, in your inbox every day.

Sign up here.\n\nAccording to Bodrov, before Russia launched its ongoing invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the major problem faced by ethnic Germans in Russia was assimilation.\n\nBut since the Kremlin launched its offensive, ethnic German males have been actively recruited to the war in Ukraine.\n\nBodrov said more than 500 ethnic Germans recruited to Russia's aggression have been killed in Ukraine.\n\nGerman organizations in Russia are currently divided over the war, with one part openly condemning the full-scale aggression against Ukraine, while the other is trying to keep a low profile and avoid the war, Bodrov said.\n\n\"People in Germany very often have no idea about our problems. German authorities responsible for solving problems faced by ethnic Germans in post-Soviet countries report that there are no problems. But it is a big problem to enter Germany for ethnic Germans from the post-Soviet states because of German law,\" Bodrov added.\n\nAs part of raising awareness over the situation, ethnic Germans held pickets in front of the German Consulate in Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty; the UN Office in Bonn; the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) in Strasbourg; Amnesty International's headquarters in Dusseldorf; the Federal Administrative Office in Cologne; the White House in Washington; and in several U.S. cities.\n\nAt least one single-person picket was held in Russia.\n\nThe picketers held placards with slogans saying: \"Kremlin Sends Russia's Germans to Die,\" \"80 Years of Assimilation and Ethnocide,\" \"Save German Minority in the Former Soviet Union,\" and \"Russia's Germans Are Hostages Of Russian-German Business.\"\n\nBodrov said he and his organizations have sent letters of awareness to several European institutions, urging them to help ethnic Germans from the post-Soviet space obtain refugee status in Germany and other European nations.\n\n\"Germany and Russia have been unable to solve the problem of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union in the last 30 years. It means the problem is now international,\" Bodrov said.\n\nEthnic Germans in the post-Soviet space are successors of Germans invited to the Russian Empire in the 18th century by Russian empress Catherine the Great, who was German herself.\n\nIn the autumn of 1941, shortly after Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Soviet authorities dissolved the German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the Volga area and deported at least 400,000 ethnic Germans to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Siberia.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early '90s, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans emigrated from the former Soviet Union, mostly from Kazakhstan, to Germany.\n\nHuman rights groups and media reports have said that since Russia started its invasion against Ukraine, Moscow has been mostly recruiting representatives of ethnic minorities to the war.\n\nKYIV -- Ukraine on August 29 commemorated those who have fallen defending the country's independence as Russia unleashed fresh strikes on Kyiv and across the country.\n\nUkraine's air defenses shot down more than 10 Russian drones over Kyiv in the third large-scale attack on the Ukrainian capital in four days, the city's administration reported.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"The third air attack on Kyiv in the last 4 days! A mass attack again! This time, they used exclusively attack UAVs,\" Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv's military administration, said on Telegram, adding that the attack came from the occupied part of Ukraine's Kherson region and from Russia's Kursk region.\n\nPopko said drone debris ignited a fire that was put out by firefighters and added that there were no immediate reports of casualties or material damage.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine's Air Force said two Russian missiles and 60 drones were downed above the whole territory of Ukraine early on August 29.\n\nThe latest attacks on Ukraine came a day after at least nine people were killed in Russian attacks on two Ukrainian regions, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhya, and on the same day as Ukraine marked the Day of Remembrance of the Defenders of Ukraine.\n\nThe holiday marked the 10th anniversary of the battle of Ilovaisk, in the Donetsk region, when hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were killed by Russian troops on August 24, 2014, as they began to withdraw from the Russia-encircled town, despite the Russian military giving assurances that the withdrawal would be allowed to proceed peacefully.\n\nGeneral Oleksandr Syrskiy, the commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said the holiday serves as a perpetual warning about what he called the treachery of the Russian aggressor.\n\n\"Ilovaisk is not only a tragic event in the history of Ukraine but also a page of Ukrainian indomitability. It is an act and feat of the Ukrainian military. Let's remember that despite the loss and deception of the enemy, our soldiers did not give up but kept attempting to break out of the trap and fight,\" Syrskiy said in a message on Telegram.\n\n\"This day will always remind us of the treachery of the Russian aggressor [and will remind us] that any negotiations with terrorists and murderers are a mortally dangerous business, and that they cannot be trusted,\" he added.\n\nSeparately, Ukraine's General Staff on August 29 confirmed that it was behind three drone strikes the previous day that targeted Russian oil depots and an ammunition storage facility.\n\nIt said that the strike on the oil depot in the Kamensky district of Russia's Rostov region was carried out by units of the Special Operations Forces of the military and the Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) in cooperation with other branches of Ukraine's defense forces.\n\nIt also claimed responsibility for a strike on the Zenit oil depot in the Kirov region, some 1,500 kilometers northeast of the Ukrainian border, and one on the ammunition depot of the artillery group Zapad in Russia's Voronezh region.\n\nIn Russia's Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on August 29 that one person had been killed and two wounded by Ukrainian strikes.\n\nGladkov said on Telegram that \"the town of Shebekino was targeted by Ukrainian forces\" and \"unfortunately, one person was killed.\"\n\nUkraine has not commented on the claim, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nThe Romanian government on August 28 approved the start of negotiations with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the purchase of a major stake in Moldova's Danube River port of Giurgiulesti.\n\nThe port, located near Moldova's borders with Romania and Ukraine, is 134 kilometers from the Black Sea and can be accessed by river and sea vessels.\n\nTwo different port infrastructure entities operate in Giurgiulesti -- Giurgiulesti State Port and Giurgiulesti International Free Port. The Moldovan government said on August 28 that it does not intend to sell the state port.\n\nThe negotiations will take place with the operator of the Giurgiulesti International Free Port, Danube Logistics SRL, which was acquired by the EBRD in 2021.\n\nThe Romanian government approved a memorandum to form a negotiation commission and begin talks with the EBRD to acquire Danube Logistics SRL. The purchase would be made through a company controlled by the Romanian state through the Transport Ministry.\n\n\"The Romanian state has expressed interest to buy the shares given competition between Constanta port and the other Black Sea ports and those of other EU states, as well as the expansion of Constanta port and its transformation into a market leader for central and southeast Europe,\" the memorandum said.\n\nA Moldovan government spokesperson said EBRD is negotiating with several potential investors, including from Romania, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Denmark.\n\nThe Romanian government did not specify when it expected negotiations to take place or how much it was willing to pay, but it appears to be under pressure to start negotiations because the Bulgarian company MBF Port Burgas has already shown interest in Giurgiulesti.\n\nMBF Port Burgas operates two terminals in the Port of Burgas in southern Bulgaria and is part of Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar). Until 2008, Navibulgar was the largest shipping company owned by the government in Sofia.\n\nAfter the privatization, Navibulgar ended up in the portfolio of billionaire brothers Kiril Domuschiev and Georgi Petrov Domuschiev, who are close to former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.\n\nRFE/RL contacted MBF Port Burgas for comment but didn't receive a response.\n\nAn EBRD official confirmed to RFE/RL that the bank wants to sell its stake in the port of Giurgiulesti and is interested in making the process transparent.\n\n\"EBRD wants to find a reputable buyer for the port. We are often approached by various interested buyers, but we are currently focusing on working with the government of the Republic of Moldova to pave the way for a transparent sale process,\" the EBRD official said.\n\nRomania's main Black Sea port of Constanta has seen an influx of investment, including EU funds to increase its capacity, since becoming Ukraine's biggest alternative grain export route following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nAccording to the memorandum, taking into account the competition between the Port of Constanta and the other ports of the Black Sea basin and of the EU member states, the purchase of Giurgiulesti International Free Port would help to expand the port of Constanta and transform it into a market leader for Central and Southeastern Europe.\n\nThe Romanian state's interest in the port was announced last year by Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.\n\nThrough this investment, Romania will become one of the most important international hubs for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the end of the war, he said at the time.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nIt is \"positive news\" that French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Serbia, said the head of the Delegation of the European Union, Emanuele Giaufret, in Belgrade on August 28, assessing the visit as an important step in Serbia’s path to the European Union.\n\nThe two-day visit, set to begin on August 29, will include a meeting between Macron and President Aleksandar Vucic and is also expected to see the signing of an armament deal to sell French fighter jets to Serbia.\n\nAlong with the signing, Macron will unveil a plaque marking the completion of modernization works at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, visit the Matica Srpska Gallery in Novi Sad, and give a speech at the Forum on Youth and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"It is part of the engagement of the member countries working to strengthen bilateral relations with Serbia, and it is also important in the context of Serbia's European path,\" Giaufret told reporters at a school exchange program event in Belgrade, Beta agency reported.\n\nThe Elysee Palace previously announced that Macron will confirm his support for Serbia's European integration and that his visit will be an opportunity to talk with Vucic about the economy, health care, energy, culture, and artificial intelligence.\n\nMacron's visit comes less than five months after he hosted the Serbian president in Paris. It will be the second visit of the French president to Serbia in the last five years, following the strengthening of relations between the two countries.\n\nSerbia, which has been a candidate for membership in the European Union since 2012, has irritated the European Union by maintaining ties with Russia during its war of aggression against Ukraine and by refusing to impose sanctions on Moscow over its war.\n\nThe European Union told Serbia on August 15 that this behavior is not compatible with EU values and the accession process. Brussels also said the EU \"wants to count on all candidate countries as reliable European partners for common principles, values, security, and prosperity.\"\n\nThe reaction followed meetings between Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Kremlin officials in Moscow along with claims of intelligence cooperation with Russia.\n\nWhile in Moscow, Vulin repeated that he is proud that Serbia is \"not part of the anti-Russian hysteria\" and has not joined the Western sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt least nine people were killed by fresh Russian attacks on two Ukrainian regions on August 28 as Kyiv's drones struck three Russian regions, setting an oil depot on fire in Russia's Rostov region.\n\nSeveral of those killed were in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, where fighting has been going on for several months as Russian troops press their offensive toward the regional hub of Pokrovsk.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"This morning, Russians killed four people and destroyed a house in Izmaylivka in the Kurakhove community,\" Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.\n\nFilashkin said that two more people were killed by Russian shelling in Chasiv Yar, in the region's Bakhmut district, which was the scene last year of a monthslong clash between Ukrainian forces and attacking mercenaries from the notorious Wagner Group.\n\nA total of 16 houses and two high-rise buildings were also damaged in the shelling, Filashkin said.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, Russian forces launched a guided aerial bomb on the center of Kupyansk, injuring 14 people, including three police officers, the Kharkiv regional prosecutor's office said.\n\nThe head of the regional military administration, Oleh Synyehubov, said hundreds of windows in residential and municipal buildings were damaged as a result of the shelling. Other administrative buildings, shops, and civil infrastructure were also damaged, Synyehubov said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the air strike on Kupyansk had resulted in several deaths but didn't say how many. He also again urged Western leaders to allow Ukraine to use the weapons their countries have provided for long-range strikes against Russian targets.\n\nZelenskiy in his evening video message said the situation in Pokrovsk and other areas in Donetsk region was \"extremely difficult.\"\n\n\"The key Russian efforts and the largest forces are concentrated there, and the stability of each of our units, our ability to destroy the occupier, is very important now,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nIn Ukraine's southern region of Zaporizhzhya, a Russian drone attack killed three people -- two women and a man -- the region's Governor Ivan Fedorov said.\n\n\"Two women aged 83 and 86 and a 61-year-old man died, three more women aged 19, 30, 56, and a 59-year-old man were wounded as a result of a Russian drone attack,\" Fedorov said.\n\nKryviy Rih, in the southern region Dnipropetrovsk region, was again targeted on August 28 by a Russian missile strike that wounded three people, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, a day after another Russian Iskander missile hit a hotel in the city, killing four people.\n\nLysak said infrastructure and cars also sustained damage in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian officials and Telegram channels reported Ukrainian drone strikes on three regions of Russia, including a first attack on a remote Russian region.\n\nUkraine, whose civilian and energy infrastructure has been battered by relentless Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, has in turn resorted in recent months to targeting oil and fuel installations inside Russia that mainly work for the military.\n\nThe governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, confirmed reports on Russian Telegram channels of a fire at an oil depot in the Kamensky district.\n\nA strong explosion occurred before the fire broke out at the depot located close to the village of Molodezhny, reports on Telegram said.\n\n\"In the Kamensky district, as a result of a drone attack, a fire broke out at a fuel depot. There are no casualties. Emergency response forces are involved in the extinguishing the blaze. There is no threat of fire spreading to residential buildings,\" Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nGolubev said earlier that four drones had been shot down by Russian air defense systems above his region.\n\nBaza, a Telegram channel with close ties to Russia's security services, said debris from two drones ignited a fire at three storage tanks in the Kamensky district.\n\nVideos posted on Telegram purported to show what appeared to be large fuel tanks burning in the dark.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the information, which could not be independently confirmed immediately.\n\nIn another Rostov district, Proletarsk, fuel tanks were reportedly still on fire some 10 days after they were hit by Ukrainian drones.\n\nIn the southwestern Voronezh region, Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported a fire \"near explosive objects,\" likely an ammunition depot.\n\nHe said there were no casualties among civilians, but the residents of two nearby villages had been temporarily evacuated by bus as a precaution before being returned to their homes.\n\nSuspected Ukrainian drones also attacked the Kirov region, some 1,500 kilometers northeast of Ukraine's border. The drones targeted an oil storage facility in the regional city of Kotelnich.\n\nKirov Governor Aleksandr Sokolov reported that there were no casualties as a result of the attack and no fire ensued. According to him, \"the situation is under control.\"\n\nThe government in Russia's Kursk region said on August 28 that it would introduce additional security measures in the Kurchatov district and at the Kursk nuclear plant from August 29.\n\nAleksei Smirnov, governor of the Kursk region, said entry to the town of Kurchatov, where the plant is located, would be temporarily restricted.\n\nUkrainian forces began an incursion into the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has taken place within about 40 kilometers of the nuclear facility.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it had shot down a Russian Su-25 plane in Kramatorsk, in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"In the direction of Kramatorsk, our military shot down a Russian Su-25 aircraft that was trying to fire at the positions of units of the Defense Forces. Antiaircraft forces employed \"a well-aimed shot from a MANPADS system,\" to destroy the plane, the military said in a statement.\n\nMANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) are lightweight and highly mobile antiaircraft weapons.\n\nNATO members meeting in Brussels on August 28 reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen Ukraine's defenses.\n\n\"Ukraine continues to intercept Russian missiles on a daily basis, saving countless lives. But Ukraine's ability to maintain their defenses requires increased supply and more support,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\n\"In the wake of the latest Russian assault, Allies today reaffirmed they are stepping up their military aid to Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said. \"We must continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment and munitions it needs to defend itself against Russia’s invasion. This is vital for Ukraine’s ability to stay in the fight.\"\n\nTelegram chief Pavel Durov has been indicted on charges of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular messaging app and placed under judicial supervision, the Paris prosecutor's office said on August 28.\n\nDurov is required to report to the police station twice a week and is prohibited from leaving France, the prosecutor's office said in a statement posted on X. Investigative judges in Paris also ordered the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of Telegram to pay 5 million euros bail.\n\nDurov was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning. According to French media reports, this was done at the request of a special unit within France's Interior Ministry in charge of investigating crimes against minors.\n\nThe allegations against Durov include that his platform is being used for child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking, and that Telegram refused to share information or documents with investigators as required by law.\n\nThe first preliminary charge against him is for \"complicity in managing an online platform to allow illicit transactions by an organized group,'' a crime that can lead to sentences of up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000 euro fine, the prosecutor's office said.\n\nPreliminary charges under French law mean magistrates have strong reason to believe a crime was committed but allow more time for further investigation.\n\nTelegram said in a statement on August 25 that Durov had nothing to hide, adding it was absurd to hold an owner responsible for the abuse of the messaging and social media platform.\n\nHis lawyer, David-Olivier Kaminski, echoed that statement after the preliminary charges were announced on August 28.\n\n\"It is totally absurd to think that the head of a social network...could be involved in criminal acts\" that could be committed on the messaging service, Kaminski said, adding that Telegram \"complies in all respects with European rules concerning digital technology.\"\n\nIn addition to Russian and French citizenships, Durov holds passports from the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis.\n\nThe U.A.E. Foreign Ministry said it was \"closely following the case\" and had asked France to provide Durov \"with all the necessary consular services in an urgent manner.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on August 27 that the allegations against Durov were \"very serious\" and that \"they require evidence that is just as serious\" to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nWithout substantial evidence, \"we are witnessing a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication and, one might even say, direct intimidation of the head of a large company,\" Peskov said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying on August 26 that Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nIn a post on X, Macron said France is \"deeply committed\" to freedom of expression but that \"freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights.\"\n\nTelegram was founded by Durov and his brother in 2013 in the wake of the Russian government's crackdown after mass pro-democracy protests that rocked Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nOne of its main advantages is the encryption of communications and the anonymity of users. In groups, the user's phone number is not visible.\n\nIn his first major interview in seven years, which he gave to U.S. conservative media figure Tucker Carlson on April 17, Durov vowed that Telegram aims to be a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics.\"\n\nCritics in Ukraine, however, say it spreads misinformation and facilitates illegal actions. Some accuse Telegram of having ties to the Russian state and of contributing to its war effort.\n\nTelegram, based in Dubai, boasts more than 900 million users, the majority of them in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, and is the third-largest communication platform worldwide after WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut Telegram has proved to be a powerful tool in spreading disinformation. A 2023 investigative journalism report found it to be the largest platform for disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2022 it ran it afoul of authorities in Germany, who issued fines of 5.1 million euros ($5 million) against the operators of Telegram for failing to comply with German law.\n\nA third member of a Belarusian family has been told to leave Sweden by September 3 after a relative was arrested in Belarus following his deportation after being denied political asylum.\n\nFamily members told RFE/RL's Belarus Service on August 28 that the man, along with his mother, was deported on August 21. The detained man's sister, meanwhile, is scheduled to be deported to Belarus by next week.\n\nThe family arrived in Sweden in 2022 saying a probe had been launched in Belarus against them over their participation in mass protests in 2020 against the official results of a presidential election that handed victory to authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka amid opposition claims the vote was rigged.\n\nThe father of the family died in a Belarusian prison, the relatives said, asking that their family name not be published. All of them had taken part in anti-Lukashenka rallies in Belarus that lasted for months after the election, they said.\n\nAfter the father was arrested in fall of 2022, the mother and son fled Belarus for Sweden using Italian visas. The daughter joined them afterward, with all three requesting political asylum in Sweden.\n\nThe father had been sentenced to three years in prison on charges of insulting Lukashenka, inciting hatred, and organizing mass unrest. RFE/RL obtained documents confirming the man's death in Belarusian custody in August 2023.\n\nThe daughter told RFE/RL that the Swedish authorities were reluctant to consider their applications for asylum because they entered Sweden on Italian visas. The woman said her mother and brother were sent to Belarus via Lithuania.\n\n\"They deported them by plane. Mom said it all was carried out with violence against them. My brother resisted a little; my mother was handcuffed -- like some sort of murderer,\" the woman said.\n\nAccording to her, Lithuanian officials then brought her mother and brother to the neutral zone along the Lithuanian-Belarusian border. The brother was then arrested on unspecified charges, while the mother was allowed to travel on to Minsk.\n\nHer brother's exact whereabouts and the exact charges he faces remain unknown.\n\nSwedish human rights defender Martin Ugla told RFE/RL that his country's legislation regarding political asylum is very complex, and while the case is \"outrageous, it's not a surprise.\"\n\n\"The fact is that in order to get asylum in Sweden, you need to prove very clearly that you are in danger of being detained at home. And it is difficult, including in cases concerning Belarus. We know what is happening there, but it is very difficult to prove that it is you who will be detained,\" Ugla said.\n\nAccording to the Swedish human rights defender, after 2020, only about 3 percent of Belarusians who applied for asylum in Sweden received it. The rest were forced to look for other ways of legalization or ask for asylum in other countries.\n\nThe former editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov has called on the Red Cross to intervene to alleviate the situation of Aleksei Gorinov, who is serving a 7-year sentence that rights groups and his supporters say is politically motivated.\n\nGorinov, 63, a former Moscow municipal lawmaker, was sentenced in July 2022 for spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military because of his stance in opposition to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIn November 2023, a new criminal case was opened against him for \"justifying terrorism.\"\n\nMuratov sent the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric-Egger, a request to assist in providing medical assistance to Gorinov.\n\n\"The consequences of inaction are obvious. I ask you, Ms. Spoljaric, to facilitate the provision of medical assistance and to intervene to stop the torture of Aleksei Gorinov by authorities. I again ask you for an urgent inspection by the Red Cross into places where internationally recognized political prisoners are held in Russia and Belarus,\" Novaya Gazeta quotes Muratov's letter as saying.\n\nNovaya Gazeta writes that Gorinov was not issued a mattress or blanket, does not have hot water or a working toilet, and is deprived of books, letters, and phone calls. The publication says that due to his complete isolation, Gorinov has begun to forget words.\n\n\"He is facing a second sentence -- in a case regarding conversations he had with cellmates in which he allegedly justified terrorism,\" Novaya Gazeta writes, adding that the accusation is based on false testimonies by other prisoners.\n\n\"The word of a criminal against the word of a political prisoner is, of course, more significant; Gorinov will be given an extra sentence. He will certainly not live to see the end of it,\" Novaya Gazeta writes.\n\nGorinov was the first individual to receive a prison term under the article on the dissemination of \"fake\" information about the Russian military, which was added to the Russian Criminal Code after the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nGorinov underwent surgery to remove part of one lung in 2016. His support group has repeatedly reported on his health problems in prison.\n\nAfghanistan is one of the largest recipients of humanitarian aid from the European Union, EU officials said on August 27, one day after saying it was appalled by a new decree issued by the Taliban-led government further restricting the lives of women.\n\nThe European Union this year has provided 125 million euros ($139 million) to Afghanistan for humanitarian-aid purposes, Balazs Ujvari, European Commission spokesman for budget, human resources, humanitarian aid, and crisis management, said at a European Commission news briefing in Brussels.\n\nIn addition to classic aid distribution, the EU has also organized 35 “air-bridge” flights carrying 1,600 tons of aid since 2021.\n\n“This shows that in a broad variety of areas, we are deploying a variety of humanitarian and civil-protection tools as well to try and alleviate the ongoing difficulties in the country,\" Ujvari said.\n\nEuropean Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer added that when the EU distributes humanitarian aid, it works with partner organizations, not the government.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, said the EU reacted very quickly on August 26 to the Taliban’s so-called Law on the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, but at the same time she defended keeping ties with the Taliban.\n\n“When it comes to the engagement with the Taliban, we do maintain contact...to allow the dialogue for political priories of the EU and to ensure that the EU can provide support to the Afghan people, and this is very important,” she said at the briefing. “The EU engagement with the Taliban is not an acknowledgement of legitimacy.”\n\nIn addition to saying it was appalled by the August 26 decree, the EU statement called it a “serious blow undermining the rights of Afghan women and girls, which we cannot tolerate.”\n\nThe decree imposes further restrictive dress codes for women and says that voices of women must not be heard in public, “which effectively deprives Afghan women of their fundamental right to freedom of expression,” the EU statement said.\n\nThe European Union said the decree, issued on the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport that killed 13 U.S. soldiers and scores of Afghans during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal, also gives the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice a mandate to enforce it.\n\n“This, together with the restrictions imposed, punishable under Taliban law, violates legal obligations and treaties to which Afghanistan is a state party, including by undermining Afghan people’s right to due process,” the EU statement said.\n\nIt also noted that the decree creates another obstacle to normalized relations and recognition by the international community -- goals that the Taliban publicly aspires to.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv has conducted its first test of a domestically produced ballistic missile as Russia unleashed a second day of deadly strikes on across Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy also said at a news conference following a forum in Kyiv on August 27 that the war with Russia would eventually end in dialogue, but that Kyiv had to be in a strong position.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelenskiy said he hoped to go to the United States in September to attend the UN General Assembly in New York and meet U.S. President Joe Biden and present a plan to end the war. Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is part of that plan, but it also includes other steps on the economic and diplomatic fronts, he said.\n\n\"The main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war,\" he said, adding that he wants it to be fair for Ukraine.\n\nHe did not elaborate on the next steps but said he would also discuss the plan with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate running for president, and probably also with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.\n\nHis announcements came as Ukraine has been pleading with its Western allies to remove their ban on Kyiv using weapons they supplied to attack military targets deep inside Russia in order to prevent Moscow's forces from destroying civilian and energy infrastructure.\n\nUkraine has also said it is working on developing the Hrim-2 short-range ballistic missile system, which is designed to combine the features of a tactical missile system and a multiple rocket launcher.\n\nLast weekend Zelenskiy also confirmed the existence of the domestically produced Palianytsia missile, which he called a \"new class\" of weapon for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy spoke hours after at least five people were killed and several more were wounded in a second massive drone and missile attack by Russia on Ukraine in as many days.\n\nIn Russia's Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6 when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory, Rafael Grossi, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear agency, visited the Kurchatov nuclear plant amid fears about the atomic installation's safety.\n\nGrossi said after the visit that there was a risk of \"nuclear incident\" at the plant, where the situation was serious.\n\nThe Kurchatov plant is situated some 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border on the banks of the Seym River, where there has been heavy fighting for the past three weeks.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian military's top commander, General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said that his forces now control 1,294 square kilometers and 100 settlements in Kursk. He also said Ukrainian troops have taken a total of 594 Russian prisoners during the ongoing operation in Kursk.\n\nAs Russia launched another wave of strikes, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had shot down a total of 60 drones and 5 missiles early on August 27.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks prompted an all-out air-raid alert declared for the whole of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian aviation expert Valeriy Romanenko told RFE/RL that the recent massive air strikes that Russia has launched are meant to exceed the capabilities of Ukraine's antiaircraft missile systems.\n\nRockets fly in a \"bunch\" and appear to air-defense systems be just one rocket, Romanenko said. The air-defense system launches a single rocket, but there is not one but five or six to shoot down.\n\nRomanenko also pointed out that the Russians are using X-101 missiles, which have a range of almost 5,500 kilometers.\n\n\"The Russians take advantage of this and plan trajectories in such a way as to avoid the positions of antiaircraft missile systems as much as possible,\" he told Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL. They also use variations in the terrain where possible, programming the rockets to pass undetected behind hills and other topography and make many turns without losing the target.\n\nIn the latest wave of Russian missiles strikes, a hotel in Kryviy Rih in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk was hit. Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that a man and a woman had been killed and five people were wounded.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLocal officials also said that two people had been killed in overnight Russian strikes in the southern region of Zaporizhzhya.\n\nIn the northeastern region of Kharkiv, a Russian missile killed one person and wounded another five, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram.\n\nIn the Khmelnytskiy region, eight Russian drones were shot down, but a person was wounded during the attack, regional Governor Serhiy Tyurin said on Telegram.\n\nAir defense systems shot down all 15 drones that attacked Kyiv, the administration of the Ukrainian capital said, adding that a fire broke out due to falling debris in a forest park in the city's Dnipro district.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, the governor or Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, claimed early on August 27 that the situation was challenging but manageable in the area amid an attempted incursion by Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the situation on the border remains difficult, but under control. Our military is carrying out planned work. I ask you to remain calm and trust only official sources of information,\" Gladkov wrote on Telegram. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on Gladkov's claim.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused authorities in Kazakhstan of violating international human rights law by \"misusing\" extremism and terrorism legislation to target peaceful government critics and others.\n\nThe rights group said in a 29-page report issued on August 27 that that those placed on Kazakhstan’s Financing Terrorism List face financial restrictions that cause them \"significant hardship\" and lead to \"violations\" of their guaranteed rights.\n\nThe situation \"is particularly egregious when the prosecutions are for alleged nonviolent “extremist” or “terrorist” crimes, that should not be considered crimes in the first place,\" it added.\n\n\"If you participate in peaceful antigovernment protests in Kazakhstan, not only can the government prosecute you as an ‘extremist,’ but it can cut you off financially,\" HRW's senior Central Asia researcher Mihra Rittman said in the report.\n\n\"Kazakhstan should immediately end its pernicious use of extremism and terrorism laws against peaceful critics and others and remove anyone currently on the Financing Terrorism List who has been convicted of nonviolent crimes.”\n\nAccording to HRW, the tightly controlled former Soviet republic's laws do not distinguish between violent and nonviolent extremism and multiple articles in the Criminal Code relating to extremism and terrorism are vaguely worded and overly broad.\n\nThe Central Asian nation's authorities automatically place on the list of groups or individuals financing terrorism or extremism any person convicted on charges that they deem to be \"extremist\" or \"terrorist\" regardless of whether the person instigated, took part in, or financially supported violence.\n\n\"Kazakhstan authorities should revise the criminal code’s provisions on extremism and terrorism so that they have sufficient precision to guarantee legal certainty. Kazakhstan also should not criminalize legitimate exercise of freedoms of speech, expression, and association, or violate other rights protected by international law, HRW's statement said.\n\nIran’s pro-reform President Masud Pezeshkian has appointed lawmaker Abdolkarim Hosseinzadeh as his deputy for rural development and underprivileged areas.\n\nThe appointment, announced late on August 26, makes Hosseinzadeh the first-ever Sunni cabinet member in an Iranian government since the Islamic republic came to power in 1979.\n\nIn his decree, Pezeshkian said he tapped Hosseinzadeh for the job because of his “commitment and valuable experiences.”\n\nPezeshkian tasked his deputy with enhancing the living conditions in villages and “improving the indicators of rural development.”\n\nHosseinzadeh, 44, has been representing the northwestern cities of Naqadeh and Oshnavieh in parliament since 2012.\n\nSunni Muslims make up around 5-10 percent of the population in Shi'ite-majority Iran, according to government estimates. They have very rarely held key posts since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nAfter winning the July 5 runoff presidential election, Pezeshkian said he sought to form a “national unity” government. Members of his team later said that included naming a relatively young cabinet which represented Iran’s ethnic and religious diversity.\n\nBut Pezeshkian came under fire for failing to include members of underrepresented groups, including Sunni Muslims, in his proposed ministerial picks earlier this month.\n\nAll 19 ministerial nominees were approved by the conservative-dominated parliament last week in a move not seen since 2001.\n\nAhead of the vote of confidence in the cabinet, Pezeshkian told lawmakers that he had selected its members in “coordination” with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This led many to conclude that Pezeshkian’s cabinet had been picked by the supreme leader and lamented what they said were the limits of the president’s powers in Iran.\n\nPezeshkian’s cabinet also includes three women, including Roads Minister Farzaneh Sadeq, who is only the second woman in the Islamic republic’s history to be named a minister.\n\nThe other two women are Zahra Behruz-Azar, Pezeshkian’s deputy for women and family affairs, and Shina Ansari, a deputy to the president and head of the Department of the Environment."
