The name comes from the baby that was given birth onboard the German ship “Schleswig-Holstein” after a rescue of migrants carried out last 22 August in the Central Mediterranean.\n\nThe “Schleswig-Holstein” is one of the vessels operating within Eunavfor Med together with other ships and air assets that have recently accomplished all the tasks of the first phase of the mission and, therefore, will permit the transition to the next phase."
