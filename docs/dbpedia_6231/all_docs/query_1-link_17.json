        "text": "Last November, two weeks after the terrorist attacks in Paris, European and Arab leaders met at a hotel on the lush outskirts of Barcelona. Bounteous palms on the manicured grounds stretched their leaves, and the air smelled crisp and clean. It was one version of Europe: serene, ecological, prosperous. But the mood inside—where the agenda was economic and political integration—was grim, even a little stunned. At one point, Nasser Judeh, the foreign minister of Jordan, went so far as to say that the conflicts across the Middle East, drawing in Europe, North Africa, Russia, and the United States, and fueled so violently by ISIS, had become “World War III.”\n\nThe conference cochair, the 42-year-old European Union foreign-policy chief, Federica Mogherini, was dressed in a black suit, a fuchsia blouse, and a necklace strung with two small parallel spears. She spent most of the day in a sea of aging men—scenes that recalled the landmark Iranian nuclear negotiations last summer, in which Mogherini was, again and again, the only woman among diplomats in dark suits.\n\n“There is not much to celebrate in these times,” she said to the assembly. In a soft and steady voice, she spoke of the Islamic State: “Their unholy war has nothing to do with faith. It is a struggle for power dressed up in the narrative of an apocalyptic clash between a self-branded caliphate and the rest of the world. Let us move beyond this narrative and think with our own minds.”\n\nMogherini is a relative newcomer in these settings, having come into her current job in November 2014. Though her post’s closest equivalent in the United States would be Secretary of State John Kerry’s, the E.U. is a body with limited military power, so she plays the role of moderator abroad, as well as negotiating between member states at home, urging them to speak with one voice. She represents the continent’s collective interest among lumbering, highly militarized giants: Russia, Iran, China, the United States. “She’s done well at a tough job,” says Kerry. “She’s very serious and works at it. I like her personally. She’s a good partner, thoughtful and constructive and very much engaged.” In Barcelona, Mogherini told me that one of her priorities now—at a time when the very future of the E.U. is being debated, amid a refugee crisis that has seen the largest movement of people on the continent since World War II—is to untangle how Europe should protect itself without succumbing to racism, disunity, and broken ideals. Sixty years since the beginning of unification, the E.U. risks fracture, and Mogherini is one of the leaders charged with saving it.\n\n“I’m worried about one thing in particular,” Mogherini said, referring to the violence in Paris. “The names of the terrorists are Arab, but their passports are European. They want to attack our ability to live together. And this could push society in exactly the direction they want—of becoming more closed.” That’s not the vision of Europe that she’s trying to maintain. “It’s not diversity that is going to destroy us,” she said, “but fear of diversity.”\n\nI first met Mogherini last October in Brussels, amid the maze of the European Union’s mammoth and unbeautiful bureaucratic buildings, a concrete-and-steel mass, as expansive and unending as a New York City housing project. Her office was all sleek, pale surfaces and clinical couches; the sole personal touches were her daughter’s crayon drawings and a cream-colored, cropped puffy coat hanging on a door. But the tangible warmth between Mogherini and her staff of mostly women filled the room; as a boss, Mo­gherini is known for kindness. She can be as sober and serious as any E.U. bureaucrat, but she doesn’t have the steely artifice of most politicians—she didn’t seem to be warily anticipating my questions in order to deflect them. In fact, she came across as relatively unguarded, laughing easily, even making self-deprecating jokes as she posed for photographs.\n\n“Moving from Rome to Brussels was hard,” she said, dressed in a black shift and silver pearls, her bright blonde hair hanging unfussily to her shoulders. She looked toward the windows. “The main thing I miss is the light. If you land in Rome, you immediately see orange and yellow. Here it is white and gray. And I miss the food. But the food I can do myself.”\n\nMogherini grew up in Rome as the only child in what she calls a “very normal family.” In fact, her father, Flavio Mo­gherini, was an influential set designer and director on the Italian film scene—but he was not a typical film-world figure, glitzy and party-hopping. Mogherini never went to film premieres. “It was not a Hollywood kind of childhood,” she says.\n\nShe did, however, visit his sets, and conjures a dreamy Cinema Paradiso image of a little girl tangled in film rolls. “I would spend entire Sundays with him editing film,” she says, gesturing as if she were holding the pieces in her hands. “He gave me the parts he didn’t want to use, and I would play with them and cut them.”\n\nMogherini’s mother worked as both an architect and a teacher, and is the person Mogherini credits for her own sense of independence. “I learned from her how to take care of myself,” she says. “She taught me the importance of being autonomous.” Which may help explain how the child of a film director ended up a politician. “Originally it was to be a journalist,” she explains. “My passion was reading newspapers—and I became curious, in particular, about Islam and the Arab world.” She wrote her university thesis on Moroccan writer Abdallah Laroui and studied political Islam. “I was convinced it would become the issue of future decades.”\n\nMogherini joined the youth organization of the Democratic Party of the Left (formerly Italy’s Communist Party), where she was spotted by a minister named Marina Sereni, who encouraged her to make her focus foreign policy. “I was struck by her,” Sereni says. “She was very young and really well prepared, always calm and professional.”\n\nAs Mogherini rose through Italy’s political system, eventually being elected to Parliament in 2008, she remained a mystery to most of the public. “She was known in Rome only by people ‘in the business,’ ” says Sergio Romano, former Italian ambassador to Russia and NATO, and now a columnist at Corriere della Sera. But her obscurity didn’t stop Prime Minister Matteo Renzi from elevating Mogherini, in a wave of hires, to be his foreign minister—the youngest in Italian history, and only the third woman to hold the position. She stayed in that job for eight months before assuming her current post; its official title: High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.\n\nThe swift rise of the young Italian did not escape notice in the E.U. The previous High Representative, Catherine Ashton of Britain, had been hands-off; Mogherini, by contrast, as an unknown, was unpredictable. The campaign against her was intense—but what seemed to drive her opponents craziest was her age. “ ‘Who is Mo­gherini?’ ” Sereni recalled people asking with exasperation. “ ‘Why not someone more experienced?’ ”\n\nIt’s not diversity that is going to destroy us,” she said of the European Union, “but fear of diversity\n\n“I am not that young!” Mogherini responds. “I’m 42 years old. When did Barack Obama become president of the United States? How old was he?” She also thinks the issue may have been equally about gender. “I paid a little bit of a price for being a young woman. A relatively young woman is perceived as younger than a relatively young man.”\n\nThe criticism faded soon after she was voted in. “The reaction in Brussels has been very positive,” says Steven Blockmans, a research fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies. “She’s not the quiet diplomat. She’s outgoing; she’s using all her natural charm in a diplomatic sense to her advantage . . . in creating a more effective and visible foreign policy at a time when foreign policy is under serious stress tests.”\n\nThe day I visited her in Brussels, European heads of state had assembled for what is called the European Council, a quarterly meeting that helps set the E.U.’s policy agenda. The council does not, however, pose or pass laws at these summits; that falls to the European Parliament, the European Commission, and something called the Council of the European Union. It’s all very confusing. When you tell Europeans that most Americans don’t understand how the E.U. works, they all reply, “Neither do most Europeans.”\n\nThe prime topic that day was migration—a crisis the E.U. has been seen as slow to confront. With Syrian and North African asylum-seekers making perilous journeys across the sea, and countries like Hungary and Austria closing parts of their borders, the council was scrambling to speak with one voice. (The E.U. would eventually agree to give Turkey $3.2 billion to toughen up on border control—a measure that was widely seen as desperate and seemed to reward President Recep Tayyip Erdogan just as his human rights record was being called into question.)\n\nMogherini told me she’d been urging other European foreign ministers to take the crisis seriously for some time. She had visited refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. “It had been very clear to me that there was not enough European awareness of the phenomenon,” she said. She added unequivocally that Europe could handle the migrants. Didn’t many of her European colleagues, especially those from poor Eastern European countries, disagree? “If you look at Lebanon,” she said, “migrants are 20 percent of the total population. And that’s a country that has more social, political, and economic challenges than we do in Europe. If you look at Jordan, migrants are 10 percent. We are a strong Europe. If we think that those countries can handle it, why shouldn’t we?”\n\nShe continued, “It’s not just that Europe can manage, it’s also that Europe has to manage. We have to come to terms with the times we are living in. The issue is not going to go away—even if we solved all the crises and wars in the world, it’s going to continue.”\n\nMogherini is constantly on the road; in one week, she could travel from Kiev to Addis Ababa, Cairo to Paris. Many experts credit her near-constant travel with making European Union foreign policy more visible, for making its voice more widely heard. “I have a strong sense of duty, and so it is always difficult to say no,” she says. “So far I’ve managed to keep a space for my family.”\n\nHer husband, Matteo Rebesani, and two daughters, Marta and Caterina, ages five and eleven, respectively, followed her from Rome and now live in Brussels. (“For us the big drama is there is no Gap in Brussels,” she says. “For Caterina, it’s only Gap.”) She makes the most of the early-morning hours: “That’s my free time—from 6:20 to 8:00, with my family. Otherwise, the only luxury I take for myself is reading a crime novel.” She’s working her way through all of the books of Jo Nesbø. “And then I try to have at least part of the weekend with my family—go to the park, go to the supermarket, cooking, doing the laundry; ordinary things.”\n\nRebesani, whom Mogherini met at a European congress in Strasbourg, left his job in Rome with Save the Children Italy because he believed it posed a conflict of interest. “He’s a very present father,” she says, and they share the parenting as equally as possible. “There have been times when he was working twelve hours a day, and I was working less; times when I am working twelve hours a day, and him less.” I suggest that Italian men are not known for such egalitarianism. “Not at all,” Mogherini says with a laugh. “People tell me I’m lucky, but you choose the people you’re with. Building a relationship based on equal responsibility—it’s also up to the woman.”\n\nMogherini can be a tough negotiator. During the Iran negotiations, it was leaked that she was the one who sternly warned the Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif that if he didn’t accept certain conditions, the negotiators would simply leave. Zarif reportedly exploded, “Never threaten an Iranian!” Which prompted the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov to cry, “Or a Russian!”\n\n“You don’t expect an Italian and an Iranian to be nice,” Mogherini says. “Zarif and I were laughing about it afterward; it was a negotiating tactic on both sides. The Iranian way is very much the Mediterranean way, but not necessarily the Anglo-Saxon way.” And she notes slyly, “The women sitting at the table are not necessarily the softer ones.”\n\nThe role she played in that historic deal, which has resulted in Iran dismantling large parts of its nuclear program, is widely considered Mogherini’s biggest achievement. Foreign-policy expert Rem Korteweg of the Centre for European Reform adds the rapprochement between Kosovo and Serbia that she helped negotiate, and the corralling of “member states to take the refugee crisis seriously.” “She seems to have gotten the good feelings of the minister community,” agrees the Italian columnist Sergio Romano. “But she’s very careful to not let anyone know that she’s taken one position rather than another. If she vigorously said, ‘This is the line we should take’ ”— on migration, combating ISIS, or any number of issues confronting the E.U.— “she would quickly find herself surrounded by wolves.”\n\nCan Mogherini expand and cement a vision of European foreign policy that unifies Europeans more than it divides them? Right now many European leaders question whether the E.U. can lead them out of its crises. She argued to me that the very relentlessness and complexity of the problems Europe is facing will be what, in the end, reminds member states of the Union’s protective necessity.\n\n“Just in July we were talking about Europe collapsing, during the Greek crisis—now it’s the refugee crisis, terrorism,” she says. “European citizens understand much more than the political leadership in some cases that there is no possible national response to such things. We live in a world that requires big answers to difficult questions. The size of the powers we’re dealing with are the U.S., Russia, China. We need to be big.”\n\nWatch Vogue_’s cover videos below:_\n\nGet the March issue delivered by Amazon instantly."
