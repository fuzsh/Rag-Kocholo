        "text": "The Bertelsmann Foundation and Aspen Institute are pleased to announce the release of season two’s third episode in the Leadership in Action series, featuring Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s former High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, reflecting on her role in brokering the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal.\n\nIn Episode 3 of Leadership in Action Season 2, Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s former High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, takes viewers on a journey from her early years working in Rome and London to the halls of the Italian foreign ministry. Along the way, Mogherini shares her candid memories as a young woman rising to positions of influence in politics, and the lessons drawn from overcoming the obstacles placed in her path.\n\nThis episode builds toward Mogherini’s greatest challenge in office: leading the negotiations with Iran to curb its pursuit of nuclear weapons. Recounting the high stakes summit with Iranian diplomats in Switzerland, Mogherini addresses issues such as negotiating tactics, balancing strategic interests of multiple stakeholders, and the importance of recognizing the humanity of those on the other side of the table."
