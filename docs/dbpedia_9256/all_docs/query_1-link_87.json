        "text": "Aly Michalka is enjoying the ‚ÄúRush‚Äù of new motherhood. The Aly & AJ singer just shared intimate pictures of her waterbirth with her baby Jack ‚Äî and new photos of her adorable baby boy.\n\n‚ÄúJack Francis Michalka-Ringer was born at 6:40 am on April 21st at 6 lbs 10 ounces. It‚Äôs the honor of my life you chose me as your Mama,‚Äù Michalka, who shares baby Jack with husband Stephen Ringer, wrote on Instagram today. She revealed that she welcomed her baby at home.\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nBindi Irwin's Daughter Grace Has the Cutest Aussie Accent as She 'Reads' the Rules Before an Adventure\n\n‚ÄúWe brought you into the world in our living room as morning birds sang for your arrival outside our window. I caught you in my hands surrounded by the best team,‚Äù Michalka continued, describing a scene that sounds like it came out of a fairytale. She thanked the many people who helped her during the birth, including her midwife, doulas, and family dog.\n\nMichalka continued, ‚ÄúWomen all over the world have for thousands of years been giving life in their own unique ways and I was able to call on my ancestors who for generations have demonstrated courage that brought me to this moment.‚Äù She thanked her mom, grandmothers, and her sister AJ Michalka ‚Äúwho Jack already loves so much.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been enjoying every minute with our baby boy these past weeks and we can‚Äôt help but marvel at this miracle we were given,‚Äù she said, explaining that her son was named after family members. The ‚ÄúPotential Breakup Song‚Äù singer also shared new photos of her baby, including one picture of her cuddling the little guy in blue pajamas as he smiles at the camera. He looks exactly like his mom, and she is absolutely glowing while she holds him. In another snap, baby Jack looks at the camera as a little rattle rests on his chest. There‚Äôs also a photo of him crying in his dad‚Äôs arms and a picture of him with the family dog. He‚Äôs so cute!\n\nIncluded in the carousel are intimate shots of Michalka‚Äôs water birth. She rests her arms on an inflatable tub in her living room. At one point, her husband comes over to rub her back, presumably to help ease labor pains. Afterward, the baby was wrapped in a blanket and put in Michalka‚Äôs arms as she rests along the side of the tub and holds them. Later, she breastfeeds her baby on her bed, propped up by pillows.\n\nNow, she is focused on her baby boy. ‚ÄúMy lil Dandelion, may the early mornings by the ocean as the animals awaken always bring you the comfort you‚Äôve brought to us,‚Äù she added in the caption. ‚ÄúThank you for working so hard to make our birth experience together so beautiful. You are so strong, curious, and soulful. I love how you have such a special relationship with the sunshine. I love everything about you. Jack, you are already our favorite face üåº‚Äù\n\nEarlier this week, Michalka confirmed her childbirth with PEOPLE and shared the first photo of the little cutie sleeping in her arms. She said, ‚ÄúIt was a very peaceful and calm birth, which is really what we were hoping for.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEvery woman‚Äôs birth is really their own journey and their own choice,‚Äù the iZombie alum told the outlet. ‚ÄúBut I do feel like our medical system intervenes in ways that can be really harmful for women and really traumatic for not only themselves, but for their baby. For me, it felt like a great way to be able to avoid that.‚Äù\n\nShe felt so good, she went to the studio one week postpartum to continue working on their new album. Still, she is struggling with postpartum changes like everyone else, including that she ‚Äúneeded to wear a diaper‚Äù herself with the bleeding that comes after childbirth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to be kind to myself and not feel pressured to immediately get back to the size that I was,‚Äù she revealed. ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt reach that for a little while, that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù\n\nThese celebrity moms opened up about their home birth experiences.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nTaylor Dye & All the Other Celebrity Pregnancy Announcements of 2024\n\nCandace Parker & All the Celebrities Who Welcomed Babies in 2024\n\nCelebrate Pride Month (& Every Day) With These Children's Books About LGBTQ Families"
