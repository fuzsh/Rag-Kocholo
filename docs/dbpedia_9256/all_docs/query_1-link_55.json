        "text": "Watch : See all the Stars Who Have Welcomed A Baby in 2024!\n\nAly Michalka is walking on sunshine.\n\nThe Aly & AJ musician welcomed her first child, a baby boy named Jack Francis, with husband Stephen Ringer at home on April 21, the couple confirmed.\n\n\"It was a very peaceful and calm birth,\" Aly told People in an interview published June 10, \"which is really what we were hoping for.\"\n\nBut a home birth wasn't always Aly's plan. The Easy A actress shared that she had been angling to deliver her baby in the hospital with a \"great doctor\" before coming across a midwife who made her realize her \"ideal\" experience.\n\n\"Every woman's birth is really their own journey and their own choice,\" Aly explained. \"But I do feel like our medical system intervenes in ways that can be really harmful for women and really traumatic for not only themselves, but for their baby. For me, it felt like a great way to be able to avoid that.\"\n\nAs for her son's name? That was a much simpler decision. In fact, the couple—who tied the knot in 2015—only had a short list of options before landing on a moniker that honors Aly's late grandfather.\n\n\"We just kind of knew immediately like, 'Oh yeah, he's a Jack,'\" the 35-year-old recalled. \"He's just a great little guy. He's got a really special disposition about him.\"\n\nAly's baby news arrives six months after she after she first found out that she was pregnant. The \"Like Whoa\" singer learned she was expecting while still finishing up her With Love From Aly & AJ 2023 tour alongside sister AJ Michalka.\n\nAnd while the Phil of the Future alum and her husband had initially planned to wait until the tour to start a family, they were ultimately happy with the way things turned out.\n\n\"It was nice that it ended up happening quickly,\" Aly told People in January, when she publicly announced her pregnancy. \"But also I think that took us by surprise in a way where we were like, 'Oh, we thought that maybe this would take us eight, nine months to get pregnant or a year,' and it didn't.\""
