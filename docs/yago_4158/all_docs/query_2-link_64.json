        "text": "Given that in France there was the least resistance to understanding and accepting film as art, it is no coincidence that strong avant-garde tendencies first appeared there, which, while the poetic process of narrative consolidation was taking place, essentially increased the scope and dynamics of the film image and syntax.\n\nIn the first period, before his ideas became unsubstantiated grandiose, the innovative impulse of Abel Gance, due to the smaller format, turned into a specific Luddism, all the more effective as it was more self-serving. La Folie du Docteur Tube (The Madness of Doctor Tube, 1916) shows the author's programmatic interest in the technique that must be mastered, above all for the lens, the lens that allows the world to be aggressively deformed. With 'justification' - the madness of the title - the director succeeds in distorting the image, which not only abandons the mimetic frame, but also introduces elements of the grotesque and humor: the fantasy, just like in Méliès, is the product of the tricks the director discovered while working with camera. In general, Gance is most interesting when he pioneers the way, when he tries to follow paths that contradict the established conventions, when his play is observed in a medium that sought its own aesthetic legitimization.\n\nThe problem of a tighter contextualization of the avant-garde praxis that burdened Gance will also follow Marcel L'Herbier, who ultimately did not resolve the fundamental aporia of his own engagement: the used prosedes were modernist or even avant-garde postulated, but the screened stories were not reworked in quality, so they still stubbornly signaled that they belonged nineteenth-century sentimental simplification. Therefore, El Dorado (1921) constantly varies between surprisingly far-sighted sequences that indicate a deliberate advancement of the range of autonomy of the film language, which is able to express both the inner state of the hero and the completely abstract overcoming of realistic coordinates, and scenes that fall into the retrograde pathos of the Victorian palp.\n\nThis split is also evident through the comparison of the beginning and end of the film. Namely, the shot with which we meet the protagonist Sibilla (Ève Francis) boldly violates the obligation of iconic and expositional 'transparency', i.e. basic mimetic precision, because L'Herbier, while the other dancers are given in normal sharpness, leaves her 'blurred', out of focus (although she is the one in the center of the narrative's attention), which should testify to the external and internal problematic nature of her position. However, by the end of the film, the character that was introduced and presented in such a stylistic revolutionary way will be condemned only to repeat the usual \"repentant\" gesture of \"fallen\" women who were denied motherhood: to the theatrical suicide with which El Dorado \"makes its point\".\n\nIn Paris qui dort (Paris sleeps, 1924) by René Clair, the special effects that leave Paris 'immobile' allude to the very ability of the medium to perform representation with the help of moving images, even when the effect is obtained by suspending or playing with that very synaestic foundation: this achievement is an experimental attempt to refocus attention on the scope of film screening practice.\n\nOn the other hand, conceived as a Dadaist diversion, as a dedicated product to be shown during the break between two acts of the ballet, i.e. when the majority of the audience has left the hall, when there is almost no one to watch it, it did not even concentrate on its 'incidental' structure, Clair's Entr'acte (Međučin, 1925) is an avant-garde work par quintessence, primarily because it completely abandons the concept of semantic roundness and message consistency. Scenes are sequenced, fast-paced or slow-motion, with the help of unusual camera angles or humorous super-impositions, and the only connection that holds them together is the rhythm, which becomes more frenetic as the film approaches the end.\n\nEven associativeness is only authorized, so that Entr'acte can really act as a kind of polemical vignette, a collection of images that builds its modernity through the disruption of narrative linearity. But is it possible to escape from the narrative, doesn't it return to the text, even if by a detour? The moment the sign or presence of death is introduced into Clair's film, the narrative suddenly begins to show 'meaningful' contours, just as the impressionistic distortion of reality is transformed into a surrealist critique of bourgeois rituals (thus a much more referential attack on the canons of 'normality' which was actually the basis of avant-garde poetics at the beginning of the twentieth century). In this respect, the procession from Entr'acte that moves behind the coffin before embarking on a mad race after it, seems to trace a path whose final dead end will of course be depicted by Buñuel with the senseless walk of his protagonists from Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie.\n\nContrasted with Clair's Dadaism is the impressionism of Jean Epstein in La Chute de la maison Usher (The Fall of the House of Usher, 1928). One of the most celebrated works of early French cinema found its formal and aesthetic inspiration in the famous story of Poe: the avant-garde poetics that forced itself into the new medium needed the avant-garde legitimization of the great forerunner, the writer who discovered the abyss of the human psyche. By combining The Fall of the House of Usher with The Oval Portrait, Epstein created an interesting, but only half-satisfying amalgam, because the intriguing visual expressiveness cannot compensate for the huge semantic deficit in the transposition of the prose template. Namely, if Epstein's decision to replace Poe's Gothic setting with an impressionistic one can be interpreted as an inadequate, but still acceptable difference in sensibility, then the director's effort to translate The Fall of the House of Usher into a metaphor for regeneration means a fatal misunderstanding of the writer's magnificent decadent art.\n\nThe pinnacle of early French advanced poetics is found in Jean Cocteau's Le Sang d'un poète (Blood of a Poet, 1932), a film that foreshadows a further development: the avant-garde will move from some broader tendencies to a personal attitude. Although by inertia Cocteau's debut is classified as a surrealist work, it seems that, regardless of the numerous points of contact, the author's inspiration lay primarily in the further extension of personal mythology. The general aesthetic effect of Le Sang d'un poète, which enters the space of surrealism, is rather due to the director's constant playing with obsessive themes, with privileged metaphors that give a strange effect, than it is a consequence of the decision to organize the film text according to the canons of one direction.\n\nCocteau's automatic writing is not a capricious act that can be an indicator or product of the unconscious: it is, in fact, an additional focusing around the fundamental motives of the director's fascination which - devoid of narrative or semantic shaping, at least in the more conventional sense of the word - are connected by the arbitrariness of the artist's will. The four episodes in Le Sang d'un poète communicate with each other only insofar as they are the expression of the same personal vision and preference for certain symbols: the avant-garde tendencies are not the result of the director's focus on the formal aspect of the film, which must be renovated at all costs, but are only 'sub- product' of the director's obsessive autobiographical subtext."
