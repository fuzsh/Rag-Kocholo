        "text": "Directed by silent film pioneer Abel Gance, \"Lucrezia Borgia\" (1935, 93 min.) blazes onto the screen with the story of one of history's most ruthlessly ambitious families. With the same high style and exquisite attention to detail that Gance demonstrated so breathtakingly in \"Napoleon,\" \"Lucrezia Borgia\" has been called an exuberant display of Gance's extensive filmmaking prowess. Also included are two rarely seen shorter silent films directed by Gance: \"Au Secours!\" (1923, 31 min.) uses experimental editing and photography to illustrate a man's adventures in a haunted house. \"La Folie Du Docteur Tube\" (1916, 14 min.) is a highly advanced experimental comedy about a mad scientist who discovers a sneezing powder that can alter someone's physique. This film, which uses mirrors to create distorted images, is considered by many to be the first appearance of the avant-garde in French cinema."
