        "text": "La Sortie des usines (Exit of workers from the factory, 1895) - Lumière brothers\n\nThe brothers' first film Light La sortie des usines was made for a scientific presentation (and not as the main news), only to be filmed again after a few months - due to certain technical improvements.\n\nAnd cinematography automatically manifested a double conditionality: on the one hand, the film will rest, as an industrial commodity, on the exploitation of workers, on their additional use, on the other hand, the film, as part of the capitalist matrix, will be produced without hesitation, without time lag, simultaneously moved into a remake, as a reminder of limited narrative resources: the reproduction of images will inevitably become - self-reproduction.\n\nToo, La sortie des usines was recorded with a hidden camera, which is proof of the internal documentary resonance of the film image, but what stands out even more strongly and exemplary in the subsequent analysis is that in this selection, in fact, an ideological vision was already involved.\n\nEven in its most innocent phase, the cinematographic apparatus is not ideologically 'inert', since every selection (from the marking of the 'theme' to the stylistic articulation, even within the scope of one frame), is a certain political attitude, a reading that is a consequence of the adopted 'code' system.\n\nL'Arrivée d'un train à La Ciotat (The arrival of a train at the station, 1896) - Lumière Brothers\n\nHow La sortie des usines shows how ideology is loaded textually 'invisibly' even in a naive, 'primitive' staging, then L'Arrivée d'un train à La Ciotat signifies a strong confirmation of cinematography as an aesthetic statement and expression.\n\nThe Lumière brothers achieve the artistic dimension by treating the frame as an eminent perspective space (spatial continuity is segmented into plans), which gives the staging a suspenseful dramaturgy, while the very entry of the train turns into the purpose and goal of the \"narrated\" scene: the film as such acquires its own telos, poetics anticipation and resolution are emphasized, the story (at the minimum as well as at the maximum level) must have a beginning and an end, what is begun must also be completed: the narrative always stretches between excitement and ending, which is why it is inherently sexualized.\n\nThat's why - regardless of his enthusiasm and complete turn to the studio and fantastic film trick and spectacle (all of which together seemed like a salutary overcoming of the skepticism of the Lumière brothers) - the enhanced artistry Georges Méliès was a kind of regression. Because he could not construct his audience except as one who observes a play in the theater, to frame the frame except as an event inside the proscenium: Méliès' fantasy was imprisoned within the fifteenth-nineteenth-century theatrical vision, no matter how charming.\n\nAgainst this insufficient attempt to perhaps sense mimetic outlines in the phantasmagoria, the Lumière brothers discovered, that is, illuminated - which is a filmographic act par quintessence - the fictionality at the heart of reality. Already in their last name ('light' in French) the necessary energy was already written in advance, without which the shadows on the wall could not even be summoned to the bewitching game.\n\nAt the very beginning of a history, they found themselves in an indistinguishable interweaving of techniques, business, (somewhat terrifying) entertainment and mimesis, an initiating combination that would make film the most popular art of the twentieth century: after this iconographic, imaginary intrusion, reality was never the same again. .\n\nEnoch Arden (1911) - David Wark Griffith\n\nAs announced by his debut The Adventures of Dollie (1908) Griffith's rising from the primitive phase that marks the very beginnings of cinema when the foundations for what is are being laid Noël Burch called the 'institutional mode of representation', is primarily reflected in the director's progressive insight into the far-reaching use of montage.\n\nBy 1911, when he recorded his first two-reel feature, Enoch Arden, Griffith's montage alternation had both a narrative and dramaturgical function, especially as it relates to spatial organization. U Enoch Arden, the director's remake of the same name Tennyson's poems, on the other hand, the compactness and completeness of the space is achieved - in the story of Enoch (Wilfred Lucas) who is shipwrecked, remains separated from his wife for many years (Linda Arvidson) and manages to return home only when she succumbs to the advances of Philip (Francis J. Grandon) - by the adequate orientation of the gaze of the main characters: in this way, with the help of the form itself, they still remain in a certain relationship, and the film retains the required emotional dimension, as well as the \"uniqueness\" of the action.\n\nVoyeur parallelism structures Enoch Arden which for Griffith is a metapoetic means of exploring a new medium, emphasizing that what the gaze sees (thus, what the frame decisively contains) is always open to different interpretations.\n\nLa Folie du Docteur Tube (The Madness of Doctor Tube, 1915) - Abel Gance\n\nWhen, due to the small format and already 'distorted' story, there was no more pronounced need for contextualization, Gance's the innovative dynamism turned into a specific Luddism, all the more effective as it was more self-serving. La Folie du Docteur Tube it shows the author's - almost childishly delighted - interest in the technique that must be mastered, above all in the lens, the lens that allows the world to be aggressively deformed.\n\nWith 'justification' - the madness of the title - the director succeeds in distorting the image, which not only abandons the mimetic frame, but also introduces elements of the grotesque and humor: the fantasy, just like in Méliès, is the product of the tricks the director discovered while working with camera.\n\nIn principle, Gance is most interesting - this is also the most important reason for his place in the film diachrony - when he pioneers the paths, when he tries to follow paths that contradict the conventions already established at the time, when his play is observed in a medium that was just looking for its own. aesthetic legitimization.\n\nThe Birth of a Nation (1915) - David Wark Griffith\n\nAlthough during the XNUMXth years of the last century, the American film industry made the most money from short comedies Chaplin i Keaton, the most far-sighted vision of the period certainly belonged to Griffith.\n\nMoreover, his ideas will directly lead to the profiling of Hollywood poetics as we know it today: with intolerance (Intolerance, 1916), but especially and foundationally with The Birth of a Nation, Griffith will conceive the first real spectacles, large sumptuous productions in which aesthetic and financial intentions will be inextricably intertwined, which will logistically provide a permanent advantage and spread of the American understanding of film in which the need for the simultaneity of artistic and business logic can be reconciled painlessly.\n\nMore importantly, in his effort to investigate reception rules and preferences, Griffith approached the film as a narrative, or metonymic medium, in which it is crucial to insist on realistic continuity of action. The Birth of a Nation is the best testimony of the initial, yet refined Hollywood classicism almost down to the last detail, which will be a binding discourse in the coming period.\n\nAt the same time, for Griffith, the seventh art is a center for the revival and re-dramatization of history, to such an extent that the birth of the American nation and the construction of American cinema are essentially both parallel and coincident. By discovering a form that could narrate even the most complex narratives, cinematography emerged from its pioneering phase."
