        "text": "La Folie du Docteur Tube\n\nFeaturing Albert Dieudonne (later to play Napoleon), La Folie du Docteur Tube is “a black comedy which carried Melies fantasy into the realm of the avant-garde...a self-indulgent romp with camera tricks....” (Kevin Brownlow). Made in 1916, it is significant as the cinema's first extensive use of distorting mirrors, with which the tale of a mad scientist who discovers a sneezing powder capable of changing people's shapes is cleverly told. The cinematography is by Léonce-Henry Burel, who worked on Gance's 1919 J'Accuse, La Roue and Napoleon, and later on films of Renoir and Bresson.\n\nHaving gained producer Louis Nalpas' confidence with his first film in 1912 (Un Drame au Chateau d'Acre, shot in five days for 5000 francs), a young Abel Gance confidently let loose his imagination for the making of La Folie du Docteur Tube. Nalpas refused to release it. “I had tried to mirror reality in an unconventional way,” Gance explains (in Films in Review, 1952), “and I was warned never to embark on surrealism again....” (JB)\n\n• Directed by Abel Gance. Produced by Louis Nalpas for Film d'Art. Photographed by Léonce-Henry Burel. (1916, 14 mins, silent, Print from Images Film Archives)\n\nAu Secours!\n\nEven rarer than La Folie du Docteur Tube is Au Secours!, directed by Gance as a vehicle for the great French comic, Max Linder. The script, written by Gance and Linder, involves Max, a haunted chateau, and a “Ghastly Thing” against which he holds the door. Made in six days, it features experimental editing and photography by Gance.\n\n• Directed by Abel Gance. Written by Gance and Max Linder. With Max Linder, Jean Toulout, Gina Palerme. (1923, 35 mins, silent with English intertitles, Print from Images Film Archives)"
