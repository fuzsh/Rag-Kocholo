La Folie du Docteur Tube

Featuring Albert Dieudonne (later to play Napoleon), La Folie du Docteur Tube is “a black comedy which carried Melies fantasy into the realm of the avant-garde...a self-indulgent romp with camera tricks....” (Kevin Brownlow). Made in 1916, it is significant as the cinema's first extensive use of distorting mirrors, with which the tale of a mad scientist who discovers a sneezing powder capable of changing people's shapes is cleverly told. The cinematography is by Léonce-Henry Burel, who worked on Gance's 1919 J'Accuse, La Roue and Napoleon, and later on films of Renoir and Bresson.

Having gained producer Louis Nalpas' confidence with his first film in 1912 (Un Drame au Chateau d'Acre, shot in five days for 5000 francs), a young Abel Gance confidently let loose his imagination for the making of La Folie du Docteur Tube. Nalpas refused to release it. “I had tried to mirror reality in an unconventional way,” Gance explains (in Films in Review, 1952), “and I was warned never to embark on surrealism again....” (JB)

Au Secours!

Even rarer than La Folie du Docteur Tube is Au Secours!, directed by Gance as a vehicle for the great French comic, Max Linder. The script, written by Gance and Linder, involves Max, a haunted chateau, and a “Ghastly Thing” against which he holds the door. Made in six days, it features experimental editing and photography by Gance.
