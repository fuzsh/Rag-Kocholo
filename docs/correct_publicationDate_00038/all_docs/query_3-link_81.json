        "text": "There is no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump ever read a word of the Bible. There IS evidence he never knew the Lord's Prayer or the Apostle's creed, standing in mute boredom through one and fumbling mumbling through the other. (See the Obamas, Clintons, Carters and Bidens all reciting the Creed by heart, while the Trumps are in mute agony. See 1st comment below.) What we DO see is him bowing before one of his overlords, here. And in other pics grinning victoriously and chortling with Lavrov & Kisliak and so many other \"ex\" Leninist commissars. Show these to your borderline -wavering aunt. You uncle may be almost hopeless, but keep at it. With demands for fact-based wagers.\n\nWeekend post has many parts, starting with a brief reminder that JoeB can ease out in a best-way that's a win-win-win. But mostly I dive into the central pillar of today's GOP message - hatred of 'credentialed elites.' The REAL elites who have benefited from 40 years of 'supply side' vampirism are desperate to point \"look instead over there at those snooty folks who know stuff!\" Waging all-out war vs ALL fact using professions, from science, teaching, medicine and law and civil service to the heroes of the FBI/Intel/Military officer corps who won the Cold War and the War on terror. They must do this, lest anyone recall who the US Revolution fought against... kings and lords and monopolists and especially 6000 years of rule by inheritance brats. Come on by, if history - the real stuff - is your thing. And if you want ammo to demolish the Steve Bannon 'elites' crap and point at the real enemies of freedom. https://lnkd.in/g-ynPQbM\n\nYes? All the MORE reason to try my win-win-win scenario! (See 1st comment, below.) He could do this in a masterful way that'd give America and the delegates a great menu of choices without actually betraying Kamala. It truly would be a win-win-win and give JoeB the best possible way out. https://lnkd.in/gCv7vCJf\n\nAn excellent and detailed - if a little biased - bio of JD Vance and his nurtured apprenticeship to Peter Thiel. Even if you're Republican, it is the most informative, by far. In fact, I do not agree with Maddow's diagnosis of what Vance's selection means. In fact, her gloom interpretation is logically absurd. Sure, Thiel - and other influences like Orson Scott Card - now have their guy on the ticket. But I bet that Donald Two Scoops has enough self-preservation instinct to know that they are planning for the (likely soon) post-Trump era. He'll insure there's never another Pence he can't utterly control, even from beyond the grave. It may seem a perverse and sci fi thriller plot scenario, but I bet DT would insist on having blackmail kompromat to ensure loyalty. But let's test it. Were there any times during the last month when JDV was out of sight, incommunicado, away from view by family or multiple aides? If you get my drift, then maybe YOU have it in you to write Grisham-like thrillers! If not, well, then settle for finding out as much as you can about this Putin tool. Start here. https://lnkd.in/ge4hK6bd"
