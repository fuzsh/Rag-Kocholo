        "text": "My \"The Postman\" opinion\n\nI bought this book after having watched the movie starring Kevin Costner, I was hoping it would be some what similiar to the movie, it was definitely different. I thought the book started out very interesting but halfway through I lost interest. This very rarely happens to me even if I struggle through some that I lose interest in. I never finished reading the book and ended up just skimming through to the end. I thought the writing was good I just lost interest in the story line hoping it would go a different way. If I was a new buyer I would give it a chance to see for myself, you might find it worth the read. Overall it was nothing like the movie so if this would be the reason for buying it don't bother.\n\ni much better picture\n\nthis is one of the best novels from the post-apocolyptic sub genre of science fiction. it tells a great story of one mans struggle to bring back something from the ruins of a world that we all take for granted today. the book is one mans not so unbelievable interpretation of a world after civilization has ceased and if you liked the movie, you will love the book. like so many other titles of novel and film. it is basically the same, but with much more story and detail.\n\nBook is better than the movie!\n\nIn my opinion, the book is MUCH better than the movie. The book is much more detailed and tells an epic tale of one man's journey to help re-establish the idea of society in a world blown to hell! The film focuses on the one aspect of the tale, the short story the Postman, which is part one of the book. I would HIGHLY recommend reading the book first and then seeing the movie."
