        "text": "Based on a book by David Brin, The Postman is an epic post-apocalyptic adventure film, not something I favour, but I borrowed this 1997 DVD because Kevin Costner (also the director and co-producer) is a drifter who has a knack for Shakespeare.\n\nA drifter who trades Shakespearean performances for food and water stumbles upon an old uniform and mail bag of a postman, arrives in Pineview claiming to be a postman from the newly restored US government. He inspires at least one young man, Ford Lincoln Mercury (Larenz Tate) who organises a postal service based on the Postman’s story, to establish communications with other settlements and spreading hope. He also meets Abby (Olivia Williams) and becomes involved with her.\n\nThe longest Shakespearean quote in the film comes from Henry V:\n\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;\n\nOr close the wall up with our English dead.\n\nIn peace there’s nothing so becomes a man\n\nAs modest stillness and humility:\n\nBut when the blast of war blows in our ears,\n\nThen imitate the action of the tiger;\n\nStiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\n\nDisguise fair nature with hard-flavour’d rage.\n\nIt is slightly modified for the movie: “In peace, nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility, but when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger, summon up the blood, disguise fair nature with rage and lend the eye a terrible aspect”.\n\nFilmed in Metaline Falls and Fidalgo Island, Washington; central Oregon; and southern Arizona around Tucson and Nogales, the sceneries are spectacular and breathtaking. Kudos to the crew involved in photography, special effects and visual effects."
