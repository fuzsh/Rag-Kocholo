It’s a much better novel than her final and more famous book, Atlas Shrugged. Below is a link to an analysis of Rand’s philosophy, as presented in Atlas Shrugged, by David Brin, a libertarian science fiction writer. He wrote the novel The Postman, which Kevin Costner adapted into a film. I recommend the novel (the movie was just okay). If you’ve read Rand, I think you’ll enjoy Brin’s insights."
