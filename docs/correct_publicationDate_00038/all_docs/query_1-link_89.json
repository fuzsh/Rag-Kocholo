        "text": "I sure hope not!\n\nHere's the deal: I'm looking for recommandations on sf (or fantasy!) books that portray a world with as little humans as possible- but in a good way. Think of \"I'm legend\" but without the horror element- zombies etc.\n\nHere are some more guidlines: There's a book called \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\" which I recommaned to all of you. The protagonistlikes to pretend that all people have vanished and that he can, for example, enter candy shops and take stuff for free.\n\nBasically I'm looking for \"the last man on earth\" scenario, in which the man (or woman) is enjoying the solitude and loneliness, while the human world of cities and technologies is crumbling away.\n\nSomeone recommanded me The Dancers at the End of Time which kinda sounds like what I'm looking for, but more recommandations are welcome.\n\nBig P.S: if the author and/or some of the characters hold misanthropic views and general hatred towards humanity- that's an advantage, though not mandatory.\n\nThanks!\n\nSome of the Collected short stories by Vernor Vinge deal with the aftermath of a global catastrophe from very optimistic perspectives.\n\nIn them civilisation survives, scientific knowledge and technologies are not automatically lost and humanity endures rather well.\n\nThey might be worth checking. They are not strictly speaking \"last man on earth\" type scenarios, but they do try a different approach from the usual doom and gloom of most of the post-apocalytic stories around.\n\nAll the best.\n\nNick\n\nI believe Arthur C. Clarke's 'The City and the Stars' fits your stipulation. That reminds me - Clifford Simak's 'City' and Edmond Hamilton's 'City at World's End'. [note: by coincidence I have just started reading Greg Bear's 'City at the End of Time' (parts of it is set in distant future, other parts in a world similar to our own - it probably has too many people for your OP, though the ones it does have are \"loners\", and is not particularly optimistic probably].\n\nRoger Zelazny's 'Damnation Alley' is a 'fairly happy man type' post-apocalyptic novel as is David Brin's 'The Postman' - don't be put off these by the inferior movie versions.\n\nJ.G. Ballard's 'Concrete Island' has a contemporary setting, but deals with a man alone in an environment, and his coming to terms with it."
