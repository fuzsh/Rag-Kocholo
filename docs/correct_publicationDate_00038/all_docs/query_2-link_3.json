        "text": "DAVID BRIN: scientist, best-selling author, tech-consultant and speaker\n\nDavid Brin is best-known for shining light — plausibly and entertainingly — on technology, society, and countless challenges confronting our rambunctious civilization. His best-selling novels include The Postman (filmed in 1997) plus explorations of our near-future in Earth and Existence. Other novels are translated into 25+ languages. His short stories explore vividly speculative ideas.\n\nBrin's nonfiction book The Transparent Society won the American Library Association's Freedom of Speech Award for exploring 21st Century concerns about security, secrecy, accountability and privacy.\n\nAs a scientist, tech-consultant and world-known author, he speaks, advises, and writes widely on topics from national defense and homeland security to astronomy and space exploration, SETI and nanotechnology, future/prediction, creativity, and philanthropy. Urban Developer Magazine named him one of four World's Best Futurists, and he was appraised as \"#1 influencer\" in Onalytica's Top 100 report of Artificial Intelligence influencers, brands & publications.\n\nHere you will find the latest news about DAVID BRIN, including his newest books, articles, appearances and speeches.\n\nBest of David Brin\n\nDavid Brin has thrilled readers in almost thirty languages by presenting vastly imaginative — and well-grounded — challenges set in times that might yet come... along with a sometimes razor-thin hope weâll persevere. In this major retrospective collection of shorter work, gathered from across an extraordinary career spanning decades, youâll find wonder via David Brinâs unparalleled talent at imagination, extrapolation, hard headed optimism, and plain old fun.\n\nFind out more, or purchase Best of David Brin as a special limited collectible hardcover or Kindle ebook. (#AmazonCommissionsEarned)\n\nDavid Brin's OUT OF TIME series\n\nWould you want to be Yanked out of time... if it meant you could help save the future?\n\nAll our best efforts in the difficult 21st century bore fruit, and in the 24th century, people live in the very opposite of a dystopia. Only now their near-utopia is in desperate peril. Suddenly, they need heroes with grit and determination, who can teach them how to face trouble and prevail. So they reach back through time to fetch such heroes...\n\n... but only teenagers can survive the journey from our present to the future! So the heroes they bring forward must be youths from eras teeming with troubled hope — teens from today and from deeper in the past — who are \"yanked\" to an uncertain tomorrow, where only their courage and savvy innovation can save the day.\n\nVivid Tomorrows\n\nCan science fiction — especially sci-fi cinema — save the world? It already has, many times. And itâs not been all dire warnings. While optimism is much harder to dramatize than apocalypse, both large and small screens have also encouraged millions to lift their gaze, contemplating how we might get better, incrementally, or else raise grandchildren worthy of the stars. Come along with legendary science fiction author and astrophysicist David Brin on a quirky quest for unusual insights into the power of forward-looking media.\n\nFind out more, or purchase Vivid Tomorrows as a paperback.
