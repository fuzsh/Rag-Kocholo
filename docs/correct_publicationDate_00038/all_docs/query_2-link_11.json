        "text": "\"I would consider Existence to be a triumphant, epic Science Fiction novel on many levels. It stayed with me after I set it aside for the day, continues to simmer in my mind now that I've finished reading it, and has opened up a gateway to Brin's novels I'd wanted to enter for a while.\" — Rob H. Bedford at SFFWorld.com\n\nDavid Brin, 2023\n\nTor, 2012\n\nScroll down to read chapter-excerpts or to purchase EXISTENCE.\n\nfilm & media queries\n\nVince Gerardis\n\nCreated-By Agency\n\nemail: rightsqueries@gmail.com (with cc: to DAVID BRIN at books@davidbrin.com)\n\nwhat is the secret of EXISTENCE?\n\nBillions of planets may be ripe for life, even intelligence. So where is Everybody? Do civilizations make the same fatal mistakes, over and over? Might we be the first to cross the mine-field, evading every trap to learn the secret of Existence?\n\nAstronaut Gerald Livingstone is an orbital garbage collector, clearing a hundred-year mess, when he spots something unexpected — a glinting crystal, unmapped and strange. An hour after he captures it, rumors fill Earth's infomesh about an \"alien artifact.\"\n\nPeng Xiang Bin is a shoresteader off the Chinese Coast, salvaging homes abandoned to the rising tides. Under one mansion, Bin finds a secret treasure cache. One box bears a warning: Inhabited by Demons.\n\nTor Povlov is a new-era reporter, a genius at trolling Web and street for exciting and heartbreaking \"you are there\" reports. On a cross-country zeppelin tour she documents an America and world fracturing apart, torn between a future promising godlike powers for all ... and a beguiling past that might offer the only sanctuary. She does not expect to find herself — and her million-member smart posse — snagged by the biggest story ever.\n\nFrom a tribe of beleaguered dolphins to the highest mountain observatory, Existence asks the question: Are we alone in the universe? Does every bright new race stumble over the same pitfalls? The same, entrapping seven hundred ways to fail?\n\nThrown into this maelstrom of worldwide shared experience and tension over human destiny, Livingstone's Artifact is a game changer. A message in a bottle, an alien capsule that wants to communicate ... but for good or ill? The world reacts as humans always do: with fear and hope and selfishness and love and violence. And insatiable curiosity.\n\nwatch the book trailer for Existence\n\nWatch a preview book-trailer, with stunning images of characters and events in Existence, by the great web-artist Patrick Farley.\n\nread chapter-excerpts from Existence\n\nIn \"The Smartest Mob,\" a news reporter finds herself aboard a passenger Zeppelin that might — perhaps — have been turned into a weapon of terror.\n\nIn \"Aficionado,\" Hacker Sander is spoiled, temperamental and a champion rock-jock, expert at the game of Space War... till a crash landing throws him into lethal peril.\n\nIn \"The Shelter of Tradition,\" a mother and her child must flee dark forces in broad daylight while evading the gaze of a hundred million cameras on every ledge and lamp-post.\n\nIn \"Shoresteading,\" a brave Chinese man trying to make a life in the flooded boundaries of Shanghai stumbles upon a great and terrible discovery.\n\nother uplifting novels\n\nIs Existence: an uplift \"prequel\"? In many ways, yes. David Brin's bold novel explores the ultimate question: Billions of planets may be ripe for life, even intelligence. So where is Everybody?\n\nThe Uplift series is one answer.\n\nThe stirring saga that begins with Sundiver continues in Startide Rising, and climaxes in The Uplift War.\n\nA second uplift series begins with Brightness Reef, continues with Infinity's Shore, and concludes with Heaven's Reach.\n\nAn illustrated companion to the series, Contacting Aliens: An Illustrated Guide To David Brin's Uplift Universe, is a fun tour of the many alien races in the Uplift Universe.\n\nLearn more about all of Brin's novels and books here.\n\nuplifted short stories\n\nThese shorter stories are also set in the uplift universe. Learn more about all of Brin's shorter fiction here.\n\nIn \"Temptation\" (included in the newest story collection, Insistence of Vision), a female dolphin on Jijo — on the run from two predatory males — stumbles into a deeply dangerous ancient secret.\n\nIn \"Gorilla, My Dreams,\" chimpanzees and dolphins are helping humans choose the next species for uplift when powerful alien starships arrive to wipe out all life on Earth. (This story is sold on Apple's iBook, Amazon's Kindle (#AmazonCommissionsEarned), and Smashwords.)\n\nnovels\n\nDavid Brin's science fiction novels have been New York Times Bestsellers, winning multiple Hugo, Nebula and other awards. At least a dozen have been translated into more than twenty languages. They range from bold and prophetic explorations of our near-future to Brin's Uplift series, envisioning galactic issues of sapience and destiny (and star-faring dolphins!). Learn More\n\nshorter fiction\n\nShort stories and novellas have different rhythms and artistic flavor, and Brin's short stories and novellas, several of which earned Hugo and other awards, exploit that difference to explore a wider range of real and vividly speculative ideas. Many have been selected for anthologies and reprints, and most have been published in anthology form.

Learn More\n\nsocial media influencer\n\nWho could've predicted that social media — indeed, all of our online society — would play such an important role in the 21st Century — restoring the voices of advisors and influencers!
