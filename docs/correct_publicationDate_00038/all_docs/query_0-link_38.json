Fate touches him one chill winter&apos;s day when he borrows the jacket of a long-dead postal worker to protect himself from the cold. The old, worn uniform still has power as a symbol of hope, and with it he begins to weave his greatest tale, of a nation on the road to recovery.From the Paperback edition.\n\nSoft cover.
