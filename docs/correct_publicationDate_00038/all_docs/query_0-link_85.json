        "text": "A scientist, tech-futurist and best-selling author, Brin has won numerous awards for his novels, which include Earth, the 1989 ecological thriller, and Existence, the 2012 novel which explores bio-engineering, intelligence and how to maintain an open, creative civilization. His nonfiction book, The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Freedom and Privacy? won the Freedom of Speech Prize from the American Library Association.\n\nThe event is free and open to the public. Grass Roots Books and Music will have signed copies of Brinâ€™s work available for purchase at the event. View the event on Facebook.\n\nBrin will present the public lecture as part of a mini-residency at OSU October 3-6, where he will visit classes, meet with faculty and participate in a panel discussion about issues of technology and society.\n\nHe will also conduct a master class workshop in science fiction writing for undergraduate students in the School of Writing, Literature and Film, and participate in a science fiction prototyping workshop with faculty and graduate students. The workshop will explore the role of science fiction writing as a means to explore potential new technologies, as well as their social, ethical, economic and other implications."
