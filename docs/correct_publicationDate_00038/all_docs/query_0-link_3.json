        "text": "OMNI Online listed The Postman as one of ten science fiction books that changed the genre forever.\n\nrevised, and with a new introduction\n\n© David Brin, 2020; Bantam, 1985\n\nRead the first 7 chapters online, or scroll down to purchase THE POSTMAN.\n\nfilm & media queries\n\nVince Gerardis\n\nCreated-By Agency\n\nemail: rightsqueries@gmail.com (with cc: to DAVID BRIN at books@davidbrin.com)\n\nwill we miss government?\n\n\"Lying still, Gordon felt a sad poignancy — something like homesickness. The jeep, the symbolic, faithful letter carrier, the flag patch ... they recalled comfort, innocence, cooperation, an easy life that allowed millions of men and women to relax, to smile or argue as they chose, to be tolerant with one another — and to hope to be better people with the passage of time.\" — The Postman\n\nThis is the story of a lie that became the most powerful kind of truth.\n\nGordon was a survivor — a wanderer who traded tales for food and shelter in the dark and savage aftermath of a devastating bio-war.\n\nFate touches him one chill winter's day when he borrows the jacket of a long-dead postal worker to protect himself from the cold. The old, worn uniform still has power as a symbol of hope, and with it Gordon begins to weave his greatest tale, of a nation on the road to recovery.\n\nThe Postman is the dramatically moving saga of a man who rekindled the spirit of America through the power of a dream. This best-selling and award-winning novel (NOMINEE: 1986 Nebula and Hugo Awards; WINNER: Locus and John W. Campbell Memorial Awards for best novel; \"Best\" from the American Library Association) is widely considered the most universally \"accessible\" Brin novel, for those who don't normally read SF.\n\nthe civil service we all want\n\n\"This tale of struggle against chaos, by mayors and university professors and postmen, had a 'what if' flavor that was too poignant for him to consider for long.\" —The Postman\n\nthe author reacts to the film\n\n\"As many of you know, a movie version of The Postman premiered December 1997 (watch the film's theatrical trailer), and was promptly killed by both Titanic and attacks by cynical critics. If you missed it, do see it in video. It's a flawed and uneven but ambitious rendition of my story, with some stirring moments and wonderful visual imagery that make it well worth looking at. Though I could complain about lots of things, it's far better than the critics said... though not what it could have been if Costner had stayed closer to the book.\" Read David Brin's complete reaction to the Kevin Costner film.\n\nforeign-language editions\n\nThe Postman has been translated into Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. Here are some of the covers of the foreign and foreign-language publications.\n\nnovels\n\nDavid Brin's science fiction novels have been New York Times Bestsellers, winning multiple Hugo, Nebula and other awards. At least a dozen have been translated into more than twenty languages. They range from bold and prophetic explorations of our near-future to Brin's Uplift series, envisioning galactic issues of sapience and destiny (and star-faring dolphins!). Learn More\n\nshorter fiction\n\nShort stories and novellas have different rhythms and artistic flavor, and Brin's short stories and novellas, several of which earned Hugo and other awards, exploit that difference to explore a wider range of real and vividly speculative ideas. Many have been selected for anthologies and reprints, and most have been published in anthology form.
