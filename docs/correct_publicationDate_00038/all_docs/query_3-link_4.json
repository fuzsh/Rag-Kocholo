        "text": "writing\n\nBeing an author wasn't your first career choice; you earned a Ph.D. in astrophysics. How did your multi-track career evolve?\n\nI came from a family of writers and always figured that storytelling would be my artistic side-line... most scientists have one. I knew science would be harder that storytelling and I respected it more, drawn to the Enlightenment's greatest project. After all, every culture has had storytellers, but only one ever invested heavily in training a myriad brave investigators to find our what's actually true, despite our preconceptions. And indeed, I managed to contribute a few new bits of knowledge... while maintaining passion for my art.\n\nAh, but sometimes life takes a turn. Your pastime can take over and become the central profession. I was a pretty good scientist and I still keep my hand in the game. But civilization seems more eager for my art, for tales that shed a different kind of light on the transformations we're all going through. And who am I to argue with civilization?\n\nWhat is special about writing? What drew you from seeking scientific facts to literary truths?\n\nLiterature was the first truly verifiably repeatable and effective form of magic. Picture how it must have impressed ancient people to look at marks — on papyrus or clay — and know they conveyed the words of scribes and kings long dead. Knowledge, wisdom and art could finally accumulate. Death was robbed some of its sting.\n\nWriting still is magical. To create strings of black squiggles that millions of others skillfully de-code with just their eyes — into emotions and thoughts, or the struggles of believable characters, or spectacle beyond Hollywood's wildest dreams.\n\nDespite all of that, science and the honesty that it engenders have been our true accomplishments. I believe in a literature that explores this revolution, that presents alternatives and hard choices and that might help us to be wise about the onrushing process of change. One that helps to remind science and progress that it needs a heart. I reject the dichotomy, the notion that these things oppose each other.\n\nWhen a chance came along to combine the two? Who wouldn't grab the opportunity?\n\nWas Science Fiction always your chosen genre?\n\nThough SF offers me the freedom I need to explore a world undergoing drama and change, I often tell writing students that their first work of fiction should be a murder mystery.\n\nOh, it can be a sci fi mystery, like my first novel, Sundiver. Or you might give it romance or set it in the wild west, or ancient Rome. What matters is that it should follow the plot patterns and revelatory structure of a mystery yarn.\n\nWhy? Because only mysteries demand total storytelling discipline. No distractions or arty styling or array of gimmicks can mask or make up for bad plotting. This all becomes apparent when the reader finds out who-dunnit in a mystery. In the end, the reader knows whether or not you cheated. And once you've had that lesson, you will never neglect it again.\n\nDo you develop the world of a novel fully in your mind before beginning to write?\n\nI like to be surprised. Fresh implications and plot twists erupt as a story unfolds. Characters develop backgrounds, adding depth and feeling. Writing feels like exploring.\n\nOh, I sometimes plot an outline in advance. That works well. Still, not too much detail! I like to be surprised.\n\nDo you have any advice for up and coming writers?\n\nWrite. Love writing. Love stories. Love the sound of language, the vividness of description and ironies of the heart. The marvelous web of misunderstanding that is conversation. The astonishing, non-linear gyrations of cause and effect and surprise.\n\nRay Bradbury said that — deep in the heart of the writer's relationship with story and reader, there has to be love! Love the words. Love the tension that propels your plot and characters like a steam boiler. Love a civilization that gives you plenty to read and the food and shelter and safety to do it in comfort. Love to poke hard at that civilization's flaws. Love the fact that you have enough conceit to think others might like to read your drivel!\n\nOnly then, amid that love... be competitive! Aim to do it better than anybody else. Have patience to refine your craft... but never stop burning. Burn like a flame. An inferno.\n\nArt is like any other exercise in skill: a combination of talent, hard work and learning from criticism. And luck. Any three of those things can make up for a deficit in the fourth one. But those three had better be really strong.\n\nThe core point? CITOKATE: Criticism Is The Only Known Antidote To Error! Seek and relish criticism, because that is how to get even better. If you put your work out there and look upon criticism as your friend — (not easy, but worthwhile) — you will improve. And having that attitude will gain you real advantages, leveraging your talent, however great or small it may be.\n\nGood luck. There are lots of ideas out there waiting to be mined. It's not an endangered resource.\n\nThat's only a very small summary of a long list. There's lots more. After typing countless answers to requests for advice from would-be writers, I finally put it all together in a handy place.\n\nscience fiction\n\nWhat are your favorite Science Fiction novels?\n\nStand on Zanzibar, by John Brunner, was simply creepy in how far ahead it looked and how accurate its vision. Lord of Light, by Roger Zelazny, was a breakthrough in multicultural SF that was also gorgeous and exciting and all about rebellion! Ursula LeGuin's Lathe of Heaven was darn near perfect. Vernor Vinge's Rainbows End is a gem of recent \"singularity fiction.\" Herbert and Heinlein provoke vivid arguments and I like that! Bear and Robinson poke hard at our biological destiny. Banks and Stephenson believe in us and make me feel we might make it; that counts for something. For short fiction: Robert Sheckley and Alice Sheldon (James Tiptree Jr.).\n\nSee my full list of personal favorite novels.\n\nWhich authors have most influenced your writing?\n\nI grew up on Robert Heinlein and Robert Sheckley, moved on to Aldous Huxley and James Joyce, then thawed out a bit with Vonnegut and Amis and Sharp. Finally, I decided to become a storyteller, and reacquainted myself with the clear, almost tribal rhythms of Poul Anderson.\n\nMy favorite depends on which \"me\" you ask. The Serious Author in me, who comments on deep human trends, would like to think that he's grounded by Huxley and Orwell. Popper and Locke. Brunner, Sheffield and Wells. Gilman and Delaney. Shakespeare and Donne and Homer and Swift and Defoe.\n\nOn the other hand, I can't write more than a page of heady philosophy or social speculation without feeling an itch... the itch to blow something up. To make something exciting happen. Or something fun. That's when I know I've been influenced by the storytellers who made Science Fiction exciting. Like Anderson or Zelazny.\n\nBut I guess the ones I revere most are those who briefly left me speechless. Unable to write or even move, because something in a perfect story left me stunned, changed. I guess in that category I'd put Tiptree and Varley. Vonnegut at his best. Shakespeare. And Philip K. Dick.\n\nIdeally, those three personalities — the thinker, entertainer and \"writah\" — can get along. Collaborate. Work together in crafting a tale that speaks to the brain, heart, and organs of adrenaline. Well, you can try.\n\nAs a genre, where is SF heading? Will the more general population start to take it serious eventually?\n\nIn a general sense, Science Fiction is about expanding the available range of settings beyond the parochial present or familiar, freeing literature by extending it into realms of the possible. Fantasy goes farther, by diving into the improbable or impossible.\n\nThis happens to match what's done by our most recent and powerful portions of the human brain, the prefrontal lobes, or the \"lamps on the brow,\" that we use every day to explore our options, making up scenarios about tomorrow or the next day. These organs let us ponder the whole notion of \"future\" as a place, a destination. Nothing could be more human.\n\nLet others wall themselves in with their rigid genre boundaries and absurdly oppressive notions of \"eternal verities,\" needing to pretend that today's familiar obsessions will last forever. They won't.\n\nWe in SF specialize in imagining that things might be different than they are. In exploring prefrontally the potential dangers and opportunities. As long as that's our playground, no literary ghetto will fence us.\n\nHas a fictional work every made you angry. If so, which one?\n\nOh tons! I try not to get my blood pressure or dander up though. Heck, I even feel mildly positive toward Kevin Costner, who on-balance did more good than bad in The Postman film. Only a few works make me stark fuming outraged. For example, see how I eviscerate Frank Miller's horrifically evil and despicably lying piece of propaganda-for-evil called \"300.\"\n\nHow do you feel about Fantasy novels?\n\nClearly we need both romance and reason, even in creative arts such as fiction. Craft without imagination is like a mill without wheat. Imagination without craft is extravagant... and sterile.\n\nThe trend toward feudal-romantic fantasy may seem harmless. Heck, I enjoy Tolkien and steampunk and some of the best fantasists. But dreaming wistfully about kings and lords and secretive, domineering wizards is a sugary path that leads ultimately to betrayal. Because kings and lords and wizards were never our friends! Indeed, for most of history they were the chief plague destroying hope for humankind.\n\nOh, some kings and wizards were less bad than others. But they were all \"dark lords.\" Our fixation on them is a legacy of the 10,000 years in which feudalism reigned, when chieftains controlled the fables by ordering the bards what to sing about, and when humanity got nowhere. When the strong took all the women and wheat, and forced everyone else to recite fables about how right it was.\n\nTill some of us finally rebelled. The great Rebellion and the most wonderful story ever told. The story that should have us all transfixed and loyal and grateful as all outdoors.\n\nWe are heirs of the greatest heroes who ever lived. Pericles, Franklin, Faraday, Lincoln, Pankhurst, Einstein, Marshall and so on. Any one of whom was worth every elf and dragon and fairy ever imagined.\n\nSee this page for more on the differences between Science Fiction and Fantasy."
