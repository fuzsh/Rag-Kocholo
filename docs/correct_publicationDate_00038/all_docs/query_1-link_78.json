        "text": "7.5/10\n\nDolphins. In spaaaaace.\n\nThis novel is like a space opera theme park. David Brin just squeezed in every idea that he thought was cool until the novel was ready to burst. It’s a space opera candy store. I’ll have some of these and some of that, and some of those sweet things over there. If you love galaxy-wide settings, with alien races and deep time ideas and space ships and strange planets, there is much to like in this novel. But what this novel is known for most of all, is dolphins in space, and, along with the other books in the ‘Uplift universe’, the whole uplift concept of uplifting animals to high intelligence. And Brin did cool things with it.\n\nI did not expect the uplift idea to be so interesting, to be honest, but that’s what sci-fi authors are for. I liked many of the ideas, but the writing left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe story starts with the spaceship Streaker, the first dolphin ship and ‘manned’ by 140 dolphins, seven humans and one chimpanzee. We humans are the patron race of the dolphins and chimps, someone to fall back to if they mess up. It turns out that all the aliens in the galaxy had their patrons, going back a few billion years – all alien races are uplifted species themselves – which makes humans a “wolfling” species. Are we orphans? Anyway the Streaker finds a big secret out in space, and since the dolphins are still a bit impulsive, they broadcasted their discovery and now a thousand aliens are on their tail to blast them out of the stars. Oops.\n\nBrin gave the dolphins their own culture and character. Something that fits our image of them. They are impulsive smartasses, which strains their relationship with the humans, but they work well together. Brin gave them a tittering song-language. They talk in haikus and are mirthful. And they have their spiritual and animalistic side: the Whale Dream and the Threshold Sea. Sometimes they slide back into animalistic behavior, which is a great obstacle for them.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. The handful of alien races also each have their unique cultures. There is also an alien AI on the Streaker with a dry sense of humor, and an uplifted chimpanzee scientist. And the ship crashed on a planet with metal lifeforms. And there are ancient relics connected to a galaxy-wide conspiracy. And a Galactic Library. As you can see, everything and the kitchen sink was added to this novel, and I’ve only described the first 30 pages or so. Even more ideas are added as we go.\n\nThis is not exactly a richness of concepts. None of it is really deeply investigated, scientifically or philosophically. It’s more a muchness of stuff that is superficially intriguing, and the more Brin squeezes in, the less we notice that the story and writing are actually rather bland. The multitude of dolphin characters start to blend together and the humans aren’t developed much either, so that, although all the ideas are fun in a superficial, gee-whiz way, the story and characters don’t pull you in. I felt like I had to push myself through the novel.\n\nThere’s not enough space to give every idea its due. A lot of mysteries are set up, but the story is quite simple and restricted in its locations, and by the end of the book, there are no payoffs to the central mysteries. The ship and crew don’t travel around but stay put, so we don’t actually get to see much of the universe, and the story doesn’t move forward much. Some of the plot threads don’t feel right, either. For example, one about a young woman who gets harassed by a pushy dolphin with a taste for human women. There are records of dolphins in real life displaying sexual interest in humans, but it’s uncomfortable how Brin lets that play out as some men-will-be-men joke.\n\nIn short, the novel is far from perfect. But I don’t want to criticise it into the ground. The uplift idea raises some really intriguing questions, and that also raises the book’s value. Did humans truly lift themselves up, or did we have a patron who abandoned us? What if a patron race steps forward to claim us for indentured service? Can we make it in the universe without a patron to guide us or will we destroy ourselves? Are we humans responsible enough to be a patron for new races like the dolphin? Will that role be a blessing or a curse? When is the uplift experiment a success? Are the dolphins still too animalistic? Should we meddle in the dolphin’s interactions with other alien species? Should we protect them or would that be too patronising?"
