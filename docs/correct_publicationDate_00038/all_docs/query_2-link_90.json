        "text": "We invited Award Winning Science Fiction author David Brin to speak on his creative journey, his writings, and his the role of Science Fiction and Hollywood.\n\nDavid Brin is a scientist, tech speaker/consultant, and author. A film by Kevin Costner was based on Brin’s novel, The Postman. Brin’s 16 novels, including NY Times Bestsellers and Hugo Award winners, have been translated into more than twenty languages. Several of them foreshadowing global warming, pandemics, biotech, AI, cyberwarfare and the world wide web. His Uplift Series is one of the most popular and influential in science fiction literature. In EARTH and EXISTENCE he explores near future trends that may transform our world in a dangerous-but-hopeful near future.\n\nWith degrees from Caltech and the University of California-San Diego,\n\nDr. Brin serves on advisory panels ranging from astronomy, NASA innovative concepts, nanotech, and SETI to national defense and technological ethics. His nonfiction book The Transparent Society: Will Technology Make Us Choose Between Privacy and Freedom? explores the dangers of secrecy and loss of privacy in our modern world. It garnered the prestigious Freedom of Speech Prize from the American Library Association. (http://www.davidbrin.com )\n\nHis first non-fiction book—The Transparent Society: Will Technology Make Us Choose Between Freedom and Privacy? (1997)—won the Freedom of Speech Award of the American Library Association. His next—VIVID TOMORROWS: Science Fiction and Hollywood (2021)—explores the messages and clichés and memes that often go unnoticed, but help society shift under the influence of SF films."
