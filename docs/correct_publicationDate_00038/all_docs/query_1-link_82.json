        "text": "Preface to the 2020 Edition\n\nThe Postman was written as an answer to all those post-apocalyptic books and films that seem to revel in the idea of civilization’s fall, and that only lone heroes can make a difference. Yes heroes matter! But far more important would be reminding survivors that they once had been mighty beings called citizens, and they might be, yet again.\n\nThis a story about how much we take for granted – and how desperately we would miss the little, gracious things that connect us today.\n\nIt starts with the last idealist in a fallen America. A wanderer who cannot let go of a dream we all once shared, who – quite by accident – sparks restored faith that we can recover, and perhaps even become better than we were. In the years since this novel emerged, I’ve been touched by many letters and messages from readers who felt moved by the travels and travails of a ragged survivor, deeply scarred, yet still willing to hope. In this era of cynicism, we need reminders of the decency that lies within.\n\nSome messages reported that this decidedly America-centered tale has taken root as an icon for democracy movements even in nations of the former Soviet steppe. If so…then wow.\n\nOf course there’s the 1997 Kevin Costner movie – you’d expect me to have mixed feelings. I won’t go into detail here, except to say that I deem it to be among the most gorgeous – in music and cinematography – in film history. And it has a great, big heart, beautifully conveying the moral center of my tale, for which I’m grateful. Some characters were even strengthened and yes, I’d have made the same choice to leave computers and augments out of a screen version! As for brains? Well, I speak of that elsewhere (see a link in postscript). The flick is under-rated, but I hope you’ll find such nourishment here.\n\nI changed very little in this light re-edit. That 80s version of me had some knack. Though I did alter dates, just to keep readers from getting jarred every time. Naturally, much of this tale is technologically obsolete. But the dramatic core…well…to see a later, techie version, go play the video-game homage to The Postman called Death Stranding.\n\nAbove all, in these days of rampant and contagious solipsism, with so many people claiming to despise a civilization that’s been so very kind to them – the only one ever to self-criticize, with the aim to become worthy of the stars – this little tale’s overall message still needs to be heard.\n\nCivilization means something. We are in it together.\n\nPRELUDE\n\n—\n\nTHE THIRTEEN YEAR THAW\n\nChill winds still blew. Dusty snow fell. But the ancient sea was in no hurry.\n\nThe Earth had spun six thousand times since flames blossomed and cities died. Now, after sixteen circuits of the Sun, plumes of soot no longer roiled from burning forests, turning day into night.\n\nSix thousand sunsets had come and gone – gaudy, orange, glorious with suspended dust – ever since towering, superheated funnels had punched through to the stratosphere, filling it with tiny bits of suspended rock and soil. The darkened atmosphere passed less sunlight – and it cooled.\n\nIt hardly mattered anymore what had done it – a giant meteorite, a super-volcano, or a nuclear war. Temperatures and pressures swung out of balance, and great winds blew.\n\nAll over the world, a dingy snow fell. In places even summer did not erase it.\n\nOnly the Ocean, timeless and obstinate, resistant to change, really mattered. Dark skies had come and gone. The winds pushed ocher, growling sunsets. Fields of ice grew and shallower seas began to sink.\n\nBut Ocean’s vote was all important, and it was not in yet.\n\nEarth turned. Men still struggled, here and there.\n\nAnd Ocean breathed a sigh of winter.\n\nI\n\n—\n\nTHE CASCADES\n\n1\n\nIn dust and blood – with the sharp tang of terror stark in his nostrils – a man’s mind will sometimes pull forth odd relevancies. After half a lifetime in the wilderness, mostly spent struggling to survive, it still struck Gordon as odd – how obscure memories would pop into his mind. Right in the middle of a life-or-death fight.\n\nPanting under a bone-dry thicket – crawling desperately to find a refuge – he suddenly experienced a recollection as clear as the dusty stones under his nose. It was a memory of contrast – of a rainy afternoon in a warm, safe university library, long ago – of a lost world filled with books and music and carefree philosophical ramblings.\n\nWords on a page.\n\nDragging his body through the tough, unyielding bracken, he could almost see the letters, black against white. And although he couldn’t recall the obscure author’s name, the words came back with utter clarity.\n\n\"Short of Death itself, there is no such thing as a ‘total’ defeat… There is never a disaster so devastating that a determined person cannot pull something out of the ashes – by risking all that he or she has left…\n\n\"Nothing in the world is more dangerous than a desperate man.\"\n\nGordon wished the long-dead writer were here right now, sharing his predicament. He wondered what pollyannaish glow the fellow might find around this catastrophe.\n\nScratched and torn from his desperate escape into this dense thicket, he crawled as quietly as he could, stopping to lie still and squeeze his eyes shut whenever the floating dust seemed about to make him sneeze. It was slow, painful progress, and he wasn’t even sure where he was headed.\n\nMinutes ago he had been as comfortable and well-stocked as any solitary traveler could hope to be, these days. Now, Gordon was reduced to not much more than a ripped shirt, faded jeans, and camp moccasins – and thorns were cutting them all to bits.\n\nA tapestry of fiery pain followed each new scratch down his arms and back. But in this awful, bone-dry jungle, there was nothing to do but crawl onward and pray his twisting path did not deliver him back to his enemies – to those who had effectively killed him already.\n\nFinally, when he had come to think the hellish growth would never end, an opening appeared ahead. A narrow cleft split the brush and overlooked a slope of tumbled rock. Gordon pulled free of the thorns at last, rolled over onto his back, and stared up at hazy sky, grateful simply for air that wasn’t foul with the heat of dry decay.\n\nWelcome to Oregon, he thought bitterly. And I thought Idaho was bad.\n\nHe lifted one arm and tried to wipe dust from his eyes.\n\nOr is it that I’m simply getting too old for this sort of thing? After all, he was over thirty now, beyond the typical life expectancy of a post-holocaust traveler.\n\nOh Lord, I wish I was home again.\n\nHe wasn’t thinking of Minneapolis. The prairie today was a hell he had struggled for more than a decade to escape. No, home meant more to Gordon than any particular place.\n\nA hamburger, a hot bath, music, Merthiolate…\n\n…a cool beer…\n\nAs his labored breathing settled, other sounds came to the fore – the all too clear noise of happy looting. It rose from a hundred feet or so down the mountainside. Laughter as the delighted robbers tore through Gordon’s gear.\n\n…a few friendly neighborhood cops… Gordon added, still cataloging the amenities of a world long gone.\n\nThe bandits had caught him off guard as he sipped elderberry tea by a late afternoon campfire. From that first instant, as they charged up the trail straight at him, it had been clear that the hot-faced men would as soon kill Gordon as look at him.\n\nHe hadn’t waited for them to decide which to do. Throwing scalding tea into the face of the first bearded robber, he dove right into the nearby brambles. Two gunshots had followed him, and that was all. Probably, his carcass wasn’t worth as much to the thieves as an irreplaceable bullet. They already had all his goods, anyway.\n\nOr so they probably think.\n\nGordon’s smile was bitterly thin as he sat up carefully, backing along his rocky perch until he felt sure he was out of view of the slope below. He plucked his travel belt free of twigs and drew the half-full canteen for a long, desperately needed drink.\n\nBless you, paranoia, he thought. Not once since the Doomwar had he ever allowed the belt more than three feet from his side. It was the only thing he had been able to grab before diving into the brambles.\n\nThe dark gray metal of his .38 revolver shone even under a fine layer of dust, as he drew it from its holster. Gordon blew on the snub-nosed weapon and carefully checked its action. Soft clicking testified in understated eloquence to the craftsmanship and deadly precision of another age. Even in killing, the old world had made well.\n\nEspecially in the art of killing.\n\nRaucous laughter carried up from the slope below.\n\nNormally he traveled with only four rounds loaded. Now he pulled two more precious cartridges from a belt pouch and filled the empty chambers under and behind the hammer. Firearm safety was no longer a major consideration, especially since he expected to die this evening anyway.\n\nSixteen years chasing a dream, Gordon thought. First that long, futile struggle against the collapse…then scratching to survive through the Three-Year Winter…and finally, more than a decade of moving from place to place, dodging pestilence and hunger, fighting goddamned Holnists and packs of wild dogs…half a lifetime spent as a wandering, dark age minstrel, play-acting for meals in order to make it one day more while I searched for…\n\n…for someplace…\n\nGordon shook his head. He knew his own dreams well. They were a fool’s fantasies, and had no place in the present world.\n\n…for someplace where someone was taking responsibility…\n\nHe pushed the thought aside. Whatever he had been looking for, his long seeking seemed to end here, in the dry, cold mountains of what had once been eastern Oregon.\n\nFrom the sounds below he could tell that the bandits were packing up, getting ready to move off with their plunder. Thick patches of desiccated creeper blocked Gordon’s view downslope through the ponderosa pines, but soon a burly man in a faded plaid hunting coat appeared from the direction of his campsite, moving northeast on a trail leading down the mountainside.\n\nThe man’s clothing confirmed what Gordon remembered from those blurred seconds of the attack. At least his assailants weren’t wearing army surplus camouflage…the trademark of Holn survivalists. They must be just regular, run of the mill, may-they-please-roast-in-Hell bandits.\n\nIf so, then there was a sliver of a chance the plan glimmering in his mind just might accomplish something.\n\nPerhaps.\n\nThe first bandit had Gordon’s all-weather jacket tied around his waist. In his right arm he cradled the pump shotgun Gordon had carried all the way from Montana. Come on! the bearded robber yelled back up the trail. That’s enough gloating. Get that stuff together and move it!\n\nThe leader, Gordon decided.\n\nAnother man, smaller and more shabby, hurried into view carrying a cloth sack and a battered rifle. Boy, what a haul! We oughta celebrate. When we bring this stuff back, can we have all the ’shine we want, Jas? The small robber hopped like an excited bird. \"Boy, Sheba an’ the girls’ll bust when they hear about that lil’ rabbit we drove off into the briar patch. I never seen anything run so fast!\" He giggled.\n\nGordon frowned at the insult added to injury. It was the same nearly everywhere he had been – a post-holocaust callousness to which he’d never grown accustomed, even after all this time. With only one eye peering through the scrub grass rimming his cleft, he took a deep breath and shouted.\n\nI wouldn’t count on getting drunk yet, Brer Bear!\n\nAdrenaline turned his voice more shrill than he wanted, but that couldn’t be helped.\n\nThe big man dropped awkwardly to the ground, scrambling for cover behind a nearby tree. The skinny robber, though, gawked up at the hillside.\n\nWhat…? Who’s up there?\n\nGordon felt a small wash of relief. Their behavior confirmed that the sons of bitches weren’t true survivalists. Certainly not Holnists. If they had been, he’d probably be dead by now.\n\nThe other bandits – Gordon counted a total of five – hurried down the trail carrying their booty. Get down! their leader commanded from his hiding place. Scrawny seemed to wake up to his exposed position and hurried to join his comrades behind the undergrowth.\n\nAll except one robber – a sallow-faced man with salt-and-pepper sideburns, wearing an alpine hat. Instead of hiding he moved forward a little, chewing a pine needle and casually eyeing the thicket.\n\nWhy bother? he asked calmly. That poor fellow had on barely more than his skivvies, when we pounced him. We’ve got his shotgun. Let’s find out what he wants.\n\nGordon kept his head down. But he couldn’t help noticing the man’s lazy, affected drawl. He was the only one shaven, and even from here Gordon could tell that his clothes were cleaner, more meticulously tended.\n\nAt a muttered growl from his leader, the casual bandit shrugged and sauntered over behind a forked pine. Barely hidden, he called up the hillside. Are you there, Mister Rabbit? If so, I am so sorry you didn’t stay to invite us to tea. Still, aware how Jas and Little Wally tend to treat visitors, I suppose I cannot blame you for cutting out.\n\nGordon couldn’t believe he was trading banter with this twit. That’s what I figured at the time, he called. Thanks for understanding my lack of hospitality. By the way, with whom am I speaking?\n\nThe tall fellow smiled broadly. \"With whom…? Ah, a grammarian! What joy. It’s been so long since I’ve heard an educated voice. He doffed the alpine hat and bowed. I am Roger Everett Septien, at one time a member of the Pacific Stock Exchange, and presently your robber. As for my colleagues…\"\n\nThe bushes rustled. Septien listened, and finally shrugged. Alas, he called to Gordon. \"Normally I’d be tempted by a chance for some real conversation; I’m sure you’re as starved for it as I. Unfortunately, the leader of our small brotherhood of cutthroats insists that I find out what you want and get this over with.\n\nSo speak your piece, Mister Rabbit. We are all ears.\n\nGordon shook his head. The fellow obviously classed himself a wit, but his humor was fourth-rate, even by postwar standards.\n\n\"I notice you fellows aren’t carrying all of my gear. You wouldn’t by some chance have decided to take only what you needed, and left enough for me to survive, would you?\"\n\nFrom the scrub below came a high giggle, then more hoarse chuckles as others joined in. Roger Septien looked left and right and lifted his hands. His exaggerated sigh seemed to say that he, at least, appreciated the irony in Gordon’s question.\n\nAlas, he repeated. \"I recall mentioning that possibility to my compatriots. For instance, our women might find some use for your aluminum tent poles and pack frame, but I suggested we leave the nylon bag and tent, which are useless to us.\n\n\"Urm, in a sense we have done this. However, I don’t think that Wally’s…er, alterations will meet your approval.\"\n\nAgain, that shrieking giggle rose from the bushes. Gordon sagged a little.\n\nWhat about my boots? You all seem well enough shod. Do they fit any of you, anyway? Could you leave them? And my jacket and gloves?\n\nSeptien coughed. Ah, yes. They’re the main items, aren’t they? Other than the shotgun, of course, which is nonnegotiable.\n\nGordon spat. Of course, idiot. Only a blowhard states the obvious.\n\nAgain, the voice of the bandit leader could be heard, muffled by the foliage. Again there were giggles. With a pained expression, the ex-stockbroker sighed. \"My leader asks what you offer in trade. Of course I know you have nothing. Still, I must inquire.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, Gordon had a few things they might want – his belt compass for instance, and a Swiss army knife.\n\nBut what were his chances of arranging an exchange and getting out alive? It didn’t take telepathy to tell that these bastards were only toying with their victim.\n\nA fuming anger filled him, especially over Septien’s false show of compassion. He had witnessed this combination of cruel contempt and civilized manners in other once-educated people, over the years since the Collapse. By his lights, people like this were far more contemptible than those who simply succumbed to barbaric times.\n\nLook, he shouted. \"You don’t need those damn boots! You’ve no real need for my jacket or my toothbrush or my notebook, either. This area’s clean, so what do you need my Geiger counter for?\n\nI’m not stupid enough to think I can have my shotgun back, but without some of those other things I’ll die, damn you!\n\nThe echo of his curse seemed to pour down the long slope of the mountainside, leaving a hanging silence in its wake. Then the bushes rustled and the big bandit leader stood up. Spitting contemptuously upslope, he snapped his fingers at the others. Now I know he’s got no gun, he told them. His thick eyebrows narrowed and he gestured in Gordon’s general direction.\n\nRun away, little rabbit. Run, or we’ll skin you and have you for supper! He hefted Gordon’s shotgun, turned his back, and sauntered casually down the trail. The others fell in behind, laughing.\n\nRoger Septien gave the mountainside an ironic shrug and a smile, then gathered up his share of the loot and followed his compatriots. They disappeared around a bend in the narrow forest path, but for minutes afterward Gordon heard the softly diminishing sound of someone happily whistling.\n\nYou imbecile! Weak as his chances had been, he had spoiled them completely by appealing to reason and charity. In an era of tooth and claw, nobody ever did that except out of impotence. The bandits’ uncertainty had evaporated just as soon as he foolishly asked for fair play.\n\nOf course he could have fired his .38, wasting a precious bullet to prove he wasn’t completely harmless. That would have forced them to take him seriously again…\n\nThen why didn’t I do that? Was I too afraid?\n\nProbably, he admitted. I’ll very likely die of exposure tonight, but that’s still hours away, far enough to remain only an abstract threat, less frightening and immediate than five ruthless men with guns.\n\nHe punched his left palm with his fist.\n\nOh stuff it, Gordon. You can psychoanalyze yourself this evening, while you’re freezing to death. What it all comes down to, though, is that you are one prize fool, and this is probably the end.\n\nHe got up stiffly and began edging cautiously down the slope. Although he wasn’t quite ready to admit it yet, Gordon felt a growing certainty that there could only be one solution, only one even faintly possible way out of this disaster.\n\nAs soon as he was free of the thicket, Gordon limped to the trickling stream to wash his face and the worst cuts. He wiped sweat-soaked strands of brown hair out of his eyes. His scrapes hurt like hell, but none of them looked bad enough to persuade him to use the thin tube of the precious iodine in his belt pouch.\n\nHe refilled his canteen and thought.\n\nBesides his pistol and shredded clothes, a pocket knife, and compass, his pouch held a miniature fishing kit that might prove useful, if he ever made it over the mountains to a decent watershed.\n\nAnd of course ten spare rounds for his .38, small, blessed relics of industrial civilization.\n\nBack at the beginning, during the riots and the great starvation, it had seemed that the one thing in inexhaustible supply was ammunition. If only turn-of-the-century America had stockpiled and distributed food and medicine half so well as its citizens had cached mountains of bullets…\n\nRough stones jabbed his throbbing left foot as Gordon gingerly hurried toward his former campsite. Clearly these half-shredded moccasins would get him nowhere. His torn clothes would be about as effective against freezing mountain autumn nights as his pleas had been against the bandits’ hard hearts.\n\nThe small clearing where he had made camp only an hour or so ago was deserted now, but his worst fears were surpassed by the havoc he found there.\n\nHis tent had been converted into a pile of nylon shreds, his sleeping bag a small blizzard of scattered goose down. All Gordon found intact was the slim longbow he had been carving from a cut sapling, and a line of experimental venison-gut strings.\n\nProbably thought it was a walking stick. Sixteen years after the last factory had burned, Gordon’s robbers completely overlooked the potential value of the bow and strings, when the ammo finally ran out.\n\nHe used the bow to poke through the wreckage, looking for anything else to salvage.\n\nI can’t believe it. They took my journal! That prig Septien probably looks forward to poring over it during the snowtime, chuckling over my adventures and naivete while my bones are being picked by cougars and buzzards.\n\nOf course the food was all gone: the jerky; the bag of split grains that a small Idaho village had let him have in exchange for a few songs and stories; the tiny hoard of rock candy he had found in the mechanical bowels of a looted vending machine.\n\nIt’s just as well about the candy, Gordon thought as he plucked his trampled, ruined toothbrush out of the dust. Now why the hell did they have to do that?\n\nLate in the Three-Year Winter – while the remnants of his militia platoon still struggled to guard the soy silos of Wayne, Minnesota, for a government nobody had heard from in months – five of his comrades died of raging oral infections. They were awful, inglorious deaths, and no one had even been sure if one of the war bugs was responsible, or the cold and hunger and near total lack of modern hygiene. All Gordon knew was that the specter of his teeth rotting in his head was his own personal phobia.\n\nBastards, he thought as he flung the little brush aside.\n\nHe kicked the rubbish one last time. There was nothing here to change his mind.\n\nYou’re procrastinating. Go. Do it.\n\nGordon started off a little stiffly. But soon he was moving downtrail as quickly and silently as he could, making time through the bone-dry forest.\n\nThe burly outlaw leader had promised to eat him if they met again. Cannibalism had been common in the early days, and these mountain men might have acquired a taste for long pork. Still, he had to persuade them that a man with nothing to lose must be reckoned with.\n\nWithin half a mile or so, their tracks were familiar to him: two traces with the soft outlines of deer hide and three with prewar Vibram soles. They were moving at a leisurely pace, and it would be no trouble simply to catch up with his enemies.\n\nThat was not his plan, however. Gordon tried to remember this morning’s climb up this same trail.\n\nThe path drops in altitude as it winds north, along the east face of the mountain, before switching back south and east into the desert valley below.\n\nBut what if I were to cut above the main trail, and traverse the slope higher up? I might be able to come down on them while it’s still light…while they’re still gloating and expecting nothing.\n\nIf the shortcut is there…\n\nThe trail wove gradually downhill toward the northeast, in the direction of the lengthening shadows, toward the deserts of eastern Oregon and Idaho. Gordon must have passed below the robbers’ sentinels yesterday or this morning, and they had taken their time following him until he was settled into camp. Their lair had to be somewhere off this same trail.\n\nEven limping, Gordon was able to move silently and quickly, the only advantage of camp moccasins over boots. Soon he heard faint sounds below and ahead.\n\nThe raiding party. The men were laughing, joking together. It was painful to hear.\n\nIt wasn’t so much that they were laughing over him. Callous cruelty was a part of life today, and if Gordon couldn’t reconcile himself to it, he at least recognized he was the oddball in today’s savage world.\n\nBut the sounds reminded him of other laughter, the rough jokes of men who shared danger together.\n\nDrew Simms – freckle-faced pre-med with a floppy grin and deadly skill at chess or poker – the Holnists got him when they overran Wayne and burned the silos…\n\nTishawn Kielre – saved my life twice, and all he wanted when he was on his deathbed, the War Mumps tearing him apart, was for me to read him stories…\n\nThen there had been Lieutenant Van – their half-Vietnamese platoon leader. Gordon never knew until it was too late that the Lieutenant was cutting her own rations and giving them to her men. She asked, at the end, to be buried in an American flag.\n\nGordon had been alone for so long. He missed the company of such comrades, almost as much as the friendship of women.\n\nWatching the brush on his left, he came to an opening that seemed to promise a sloping track – a shortcut perhaps – to the north across the mountain face. The dust-dry scrub crackled as he left the path and broke his own trail. Gordon thought he remembered the perfect site for a bushwhack, a switchback that passed under a high, stony horseshoe. A sniper might find a place a little way above that rocky outcrop, within point-blank range of anyone hiking along the hairpin.\n\nIf I can just get there first…\n\nHe might pin them down by surprise and force them to negotiate. That was the advantage in being the one with nothing to lose. Any sane bandit would prefer to live and rob another day. He had to believe they would part with boots, a jacket, and some food, against the risk of losing one or two of their band.\n\nGordon hoped he would not have to kill anybody.\n\nOh grow up, please! His worst enemy, over the next few hours, could be his archaic scruples. Just this once, be ruthless.\n\nThe voices on the trail faded as he cut across the slope of the mountain. Several times he had to detour around jagged gullies or scabrous patches of ugly bramble. Gordon concentrated on finding the quickest way toward his rocky ambuscade.\n\nHave I gone far enough?\n\nGrimly, he kept on. According to imperfect memory, the switchback he had in mind came only after a long sweep northward along the east face of the mountain.\n\nA narrow animal track let him hurry through the pine thickets, pausing frequently to check his compass. He faced a quandary. To stand a chance of catching his adversaries, he had to stay above them. Yet if he kept too high, he might go right past his target without knowing it.\n\nAnd twilight was not long away.\n\nA flock of wild turkeys scattered as he jogged into a small clearing. Of course the thinned human population probably had something to do with the return of wildlife, but it was also one more sign that he had come into better-watered country than the arid lands of Idaho. His bow might someday prove useful, should he live long enough to learn to use it.\n\nHe angled downslope, beginning to get worried. Surely by now the main trail was quite a bit below him, if it hadn’t already switched back a few times. It was possible he had already gone too far north.\n\nAt last Gordon realized the game path was turning inexorably westward. It appeared to be rising again as well, toward what looked like another gap in the mountains, shrouded in late afternoon mist."
