        "text": "David Brin's OUT OF TIME series\n\nWould you want to be Yanked out of time... if it meant you could help save the future?\n\nAll our best efforts in the difficult 21st century bore fruit, and in the 24th century, people live in the very opposite of a dystopia. Only now their near-utopia is in desperate peril. Suddenly, they need heroes with grit and determination, who can teach them how to face trouble and prevail. So they reach back through time to fetch such heroes...\n\n... but only teenagers can survive the journey from our present to the future! So the heroes they bring forward must be youths from eras teeming with troubled hope — teens from today and from deeper in the past — who are \"yanked\" to an uncertain tomorrow, where only their courage and savvy innovation can save the day.\n\nVivid Tomorrows\n\nCan science fiction — especially sci-fi cinema — save the world? It already has, many times. And itâs not been all dire warnings. While optimism is much harder to dramatize than apocalypse, both large and small screens have also encouraged millions to lift their gaze, contemplating how we might get better, incrementally, or else raise grandchildren worthy of the stars. Come along with legendary science fiction author and astrophysicist David Brin on a quirky quest for unusual insights into the power of forward-looking media.\n\nFind out more, or purchase Vivid Tomorrows as a paperback. (#AmazonCommissionsEarned)\n\nnovels\n\nDavid Brin's science fiction novels and short stories have been New York Times Bestsellers, winning multiple Hugo, Nebula and other awards. At least a dozen have been translated into more than twenty languages. Novels include bold and prophetic explorations of our near-future, including The Postman (filmed in 1997) plus Earth and Existence.\n\nHis Uplift series plunges farther, envisioning galactic issues of sapience and destiny (with star-faring dolphins!) and includes Hugo Award winners Startide Rising and The Uplift War.\n\nall of Brin's novels and books are accessible here\n\nsee a compilation of representative book reviews\n\nBrin's uplift page describes both fictional and scientific attempts at uplift\n\nBrin's science fiction visions have expanded into alternative forms of storytelling\n\nshorter fiction\n\nShort stories and novellas have different rhythms and artistic flavor than a complete novel. David Brin's short stories and novellas, several of which earned Hugo and other awards, exploit that difference to explore a wider range of real and vividly speculative ideas. Frequently, his shorter fiction explores the human desire (bordering on obsession!) to find or invent other intelligent life forms.\n\nMany of his shorter fiction has been selected for anthologies and reprints, and most have been published in anthology form; still others can be read on this website.\n\nlearn more about Brin's short stories and novellas\n\nscience fiction books Brin finds both inspiring and well worth recommending\n\nrecommendations for learning science and science fiction\n\nfilm recommendations that captivate and illustrate basic science concepts\n\nscientist\n\nDavid Brin's Ph.D in Physics from the University of California at San Diego (the lab of nobelist Hannes Alfven) followed a masters in optics and an undergraduate degree in astrophysics from Caltech.\n\nEvery science show that depicts a comet now portrays the model developed in Brin's PhD research — a spinning icy mass insulated by carbonaceous dust, with sun-heated, geyser-jets spewing particles into space. See the Astrophysical Journal paper \"Three Models of Dust Layers on Cometary Nuclei\" or an abstract of the dissertation: \"Evolution of Cometary Nuclei as Influenced by a Dust Component.\"\n\nBrin's complete biographical information\n\nhow we can best use science and technology to achieve our most difficult goals\n\nexploring nearby solar systems has renewed interest in expanding into our own\n\nauthority on transparency, privacy and security\n\nDavid Brin's non-fiction book, The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Freedom and Privacy?, continues to receive acclaim for its accuracy in predicting 21st Century concerns about online security, secrecy, accountability and privacy.\n\nOther papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals cover an eclectic range of topics, from astronautics, astronomy, and optics to alternative dispute resolution and the role of neoteny in human evolution.\n\nanalyzing the issues surrounding transparency, security, privacy, and openness\n\nhow we confront and solve our 21st century challenges and opportunities\n\npredictions and ponderings about our near and far futures\n\nTwo of the peer-reviewed articles can be read here:\n\n\"Neoteny and Two-Way Sexual Selection in Human Evolution,\" (J. Social and Evolutionary Systems 18(3) 1996), speculates why we turned out so strange compared to other species.\n\nThe lead article in the American Bar Association's Journal on Dispute Resolution (15(3) 2000), \"Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competition,\" looks at how truth is determined in our four \"accountability arenas\" — science, democracy, courts and markets.\n\npublic speaker\n\nDavid Brin is best-known as a 'futurist' who speaks plausibly and entertainingly about trends in technology and society to audiences willing to confront the challenges that our rambunctious civilization will face in the decades ahead. He also talks about the field of science fiction, especially in relation to his own novels and stories.\n\nThrow in curiosity about science- and tech-driven change, an immersion in history/anthropology, plus an avid belief in the potential of human civilization, and to date he has presented at more than 200 meetings, conferences, corporate retreats and other gatherings.\n\nBrin speaks plausibly and entertainingly about science and society\n\na (nearly) complete listing of print interviews\n\naccess to Brin's podcast talks and interviews\n\nwatch his video speeches, talks and interviews\n\nlatest news\n\nThomson Reuters just published one of David Brin's best interviews about Artificial Intelligence and ways to get a \"soft\" singularity. His proposal re AI is (alas) not offered anywhere else, though it's the only one that can possibly work... because it already has worked, increasingly well, for 200 years. read it here\n\nDavid was interviewed about transparency, freedom and the future by the Indian magazine Factor Daily, with emphasis on India's ambitious Aadhaar Program to digitize all billion of the nation's people. read it here\n\nHere & Now's Jeremy Hobson interviews Brin and Boise State University professor Justin Vaughn about the ways in which our cameras-everywhere culture is affecting the candidates, presidential campaigns and us. Brin's podcasts page has more like this\n\nA tribute page about my father, journalist and poet Herb Brin, appears here. The page includes access to his fascinating autobiography, \"Shouting for Justice: The Journey of a Jewish Journalist Across the Century of Hitler and Israel,\" his two investigatory travelogues, and his internationally-acclaimed books of poetry — some with prefaces by Elie Weisel, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Several of his poems are available to read on the page.\n\nHerb Brin was born in the vibrant immigrant enclave of Chicago's Northwest Side and after high school staked out the beginning of his lifetime career in the brawling journalism of 1930s Chicago, covering gangland killings, corrupt politics and the aching heart of poverty.\n\nAfter soldiering in World War II, he took the advice of another great journalist, went West and back into the fourth estate. He was earning a reputation as one of the liveliest feature writers on the Los Angeles Times when he suddenly turned his back on the safe, monthly paycheck and dove bravely into the swirling waters of Jewish journalism.\n\nIt was then that he established Heritage, which, despite glum predictions, survived, matured and thrived, and expanded into a chain of four lusty Southern California weeklies. Herb went on to become one of the most honored Jewish newspapermen of his day.\n\nIf you feel moved to read his work, please leave a comment on Herb Brin's Memorial Facebook page."
