        "text": "The War of the Worlds\n\nBy H.G. Wells,\n\nFrom my list on real-life time machines through sci fi.\n\nBy Jools Cantor Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nScience fiction lets us readers escape into space or travel through time, but I believe it is most effective when grounded in our primal anxieties. Classics like Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Handmaid’s Tale resonate because the dark futures they describe drive us to prevent their prophecy. These stories give us a window into the world that birthed them by crystalizing the authors' fears into a work of fiction. When I read each book on this list, they transported me to the time they were written. En route, they showed how much our world has changed and how much we humans haven’t.\n\nJools' book list on real-life time machines through sci fi\n\nWhy did Jools love this book?\n\nI don’t know what I was expecting when I decided to cross this book off my “should have read a long time ago” list, but right off the bat, the narrator is riffing on humanity’s destruction of its own planet and Europe’s extermination of indigenous groups across the world, and asking if we can really blame the Martians for giving us a taste of our own medicine.\n\nWritten in 1898 as the Victorian age waned and the new century loomed, Wells weaves all sorts of still-relevant commentary between the gripping action and horror. Whether it’s the suicidal religious fervor of the curate, the terror of total war and mechanized murder, or societal breakdown as London evacuates, the 1890s had things to say that never stopped being relevant. Maybe we’ll finally sort them out in the next 130 years.\n\nBy H.G. Wells,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n15 authors picked The War of the Worlds as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBut planet Earth was not only being watched - soon it would be invaded by monstrous creatures from Mars who strode about the land in great mechanical tripods, bringing death and destruction with them. What can possibly stop an invading army equipped with heat-rays and poisonous black gas, intent on wiping out the human race? This is one man's story of that incredible invasion, from the time the first Martians land near his home town, to the destruction of London. Is this the end of human life on Earth?\n\nPreview\n\nWorld War Z\n\nBy Max Brooks,\n\nFrom my list on Sci-Fi real science that justifies unreal things.\n\nBy Johnny B. Truant Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBefore I was an author, I was a scientist pursuing a PhD in molecular genetics. When I left the lab and started writing, that scientist’s need for real-world sense stuck with me and became a theme in everything I write. The authors I like understand that “suspension of disbelief” is a limited resource, so they’d better only ask readers for it when it counts. Get the baseline facts and logic right, and I’ll believe and enjoy the fantastical stuff spun from it so much more.\n\nJohnny's book list on Sci-Fi real science that justifies unreal things\n\nWhy did Johnny love this book?\n\nThis book blew me away! This time, it wasn’t about science in a strict sense but rather the “scientific mindset” the book was written with. Every aspect of a real zombie war is honestly considered—all the ramifications of an event so enormous—versus the simplistic way filmmakers portray it.\n\nHow do you fight millions of things that never back down or die? They’d spread out, for instance, so you’d be finding zombies for decades later, maybe in small pieces. They don’t need to breathe, so you could “lose” them underwater until they grab you one day. And what about military strategy? How hard would it be to fight an army of soldiers who can’t panic, never give up, and don’t care enough to retreat?\n\nBy Max Brooks,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n23 authors picked World War Z as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt began with rumours from China about another pandemic. Then the cases started to multiply and what had looked like the stirrings of a criminal underclass, even the beginning of a revolution, soon revealed itself to be much, much worse.\n\nFaced with a future of mindless man-eating horror, humanity was forced to accept the logic of world government and face events that tested our sanity and our sense of reality. Based on extensive interviews with survivors and key players in the ten-year fight against the horde, World War Z brings the finest traditions of journalism to bear on what is…\n\nPreview\n\nStation Eleven\n\nBy Emily St. John Mandel,\n\nFrom my list on airports teaching us about society.\n\nBy Eric Porter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve long had an ambivalent relationship with airports. They have been the starting point for my adventures, but I have also known well the discomfort, boredom, stress, surveillance, bad food, and other unpleasantries that often define airport experiences. Despite my ambivalence, I’ve found airports to be fascinating places where differently situated people (travelers and workers) encounter one another. I’ve learned that those encounters, as well as airport operations and design, tell us something about the places where they are located and the broader societies in which we live. I’ve since become aware that reading (and writing) about airports are also great ways to gain such insights.\n\nEric's book list on airports teaching us about society\n\nWhy did Eric love this book?\n\nIn addition to eerily anticipating the COVID-19 pandemic—thankfully, our pathogen was not nearly as virulent and lethal—this post-apocalyptic novel offers interesting commentary about airports as microcosms of society.\n\nThe airport that figures prominently here is the gateway to and manifestation of a “secure” society structured as much by those it excludes as by those it includes. It is also the archive of a society defined, for better and for worse, by its relationship to technology.\n\nBy Emily St. John Mandel,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n25 authors picked Station Eleven as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'Best novel.

Falconer Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always had a longstanding interest in space, and particularly in aliens. In researching my breakthrough novel Not Alone, I extensively read as much nonfiction content on the topic as I could find, including governmental-backed scenario analyses of how things might actually play out in a contact or invasion scenario. Naturally, I have also read widely in the sci-fi genre for my own pleasure, with most of my interest in this specific topic.\n\nCraig's book list on how things will change when the aliens show up\n\nWhy did Craig love this book?\n\nThis was the first major alien arrival novel I read. I recall being awestruck by Arthur C. Clarke’s masterful mixing of incisive storytelling and a deep sense of grandeur.\n\nThe Overlords are hugely memorable, but it was the exploration of human identity that had the biggest effect on me. The story endures as a classic for a very good reason.\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Childhood's End as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nArthur C.

Nolan, George Clayton Johnson,\n\nFrom my list on post-apocalyptic showcasing humanity’s drive to survive.\n\nBy Justin Oldham Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a lifelong fan of all things post-apocalyptic. Books, movies, television, games – I have enjoyed all of it. I knew I wanted to write post-apocalyptic fiction before I was ten years old. I had to wait almost three decades before life gave me the opportunity to do it. I’ve always been fascinated by the many different ways people can survive these kinds of catastrophes. As dark and visceral as the genre can sometimes be, I will always look for the elements of hope.\n\nJustin's book list on post-apocalyptic showcasing humanity’s drive to survive\n\nWhy did Justin love this book?\n\nThis book embodies many of my favorite features of post-apocalyptic fiction—everything from rogue AI and hazardous underground encounters to trekking across devastated hellscapes. The concept of “Sanctuary” and its mythical connotations made a significant impression on me. The idea that there was a safe place, regardless of how bad things got, appealed to my sense of fairness in the universe and reinforced the idea that there is always hope.\n\nBy William F. Nolan, George Clayton Johnson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Logan's Run as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe bestselling dystopian novel that inspired the 1970s science-fiction classic starring Michael York, Jenny Agutter, and Richard Jordan.\n\nIn 2116, it is against the law to live beyond the age of twenty-one years.

I can’t help noticing that the plot holds up, even today. The idea that someone could predict that war was coming from simply paying attention to the news and things going on around them fostered my own interest in keeping up with current events. Ultimately, the story is all about making the best of a bad situation. Even today, I still enjoy the inherent optimism of that sentiment.\n\nBy Robert A.

Facing life in prison for his various crimes, he's given a choice: Rot away his remaining years in a tiny jail cell, or drive cross-country and deliver a case of antiserum to the plague-ridden people of Boston, Massachusetts. The chance of a full pardon does wonders for getting his attention. And don't mistake this mission of mercy for any kind of normal road trip-not when there are radioactive storms, hordes of carnivorous beasts, and giant, mutated scorpions…\n\nPreview\n\nPilgrimage To Hell\n\nBy James Axler,\n\nFrom my list on post-apocalyptic showcasing humanity’s drive to survive.\n\nBy Justin Oldham Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a lifelong fan of all things post-apocalyptic.

I was a little detached. I was busy thinking about the future, a “someday soon” when we could be around people, go to the movies, go to school, hug our friends…I feel like I missed nearly half of his life!
