Om Shanti Om, starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone, was a smash hit when it debuted in theatres in 2007. Interestingly, the movie also included the most cameos. One of the movie's sequences included Farhan Akhtar, Dino Morea, and Boman Irani among others on the red carpet of an awards ceremony. They were seen in the scene predicting who would win the best actor award. In the film, SRK also played an actor.

However, 16 years after the film's release, an unseen video of R Madhavan has surfaced online. R Madhavan is heard identifying himself as "South Ka Shah Rukh Khan" in this deleted Om Shanti Om scene footage.

He said, "Mujhe lagta hai mujhe milna chahiye tha, lekin unhone nominate tak nahi kiya. Aapko shayad pata nahi par south ke Shah Rukh Khan mujhe kaha jaata hai lekin yaha koi izzat hi nahi hota yaar."

Released in 2007, Om Shanti Om, directed by Farah Khan stars Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone in lead roles. The film also features Arjun Rampal, Shreyas Talpade and Kirron Kher in key roles.
