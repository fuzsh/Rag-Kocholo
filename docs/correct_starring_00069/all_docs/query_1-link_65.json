        "text": "Deepika Padukone has been on a rise and rise ever since her big debut in Om Shanti Om (2007) opposite superstar Shah Rukh Khan. 10 years later, Deepika Padukone is the undisputed queen of Bollywood, sitting on the numero uno position since the last four years.\n\nBut after all these years, here’s an interesting news from the past about how Deepika got her first ever break that too with the King himself, SRK. Reportedly, Deepika was a model and was then walking at the Lakme Fashion Week for the ace designer Wendell Rodricks.\n\nSimultaneously on the other hand, the makers of Om Shanti Om were looking for a female lead and director Farah Khan asked Malaika Arora to suggest a new model to star opposite SRK. Malaika who was friends with Rodricks, got a suggestion from him to cast Deepika for the role.\n\nRodricks confirms the news, saying, “I showed a collection called Isadora at Lakmé Fashion Week...it was a game changer for Deepika. Director Farah Khan asked my friend Malaika to suggest a new model to star opposite Shah Rukh Khan for her new film. Om Shanti Om did not have a working title at the time. I suggested Deepika who was barely two years into modelling. I made her open the show and told Malaika that the first girl I was sending out was the one I recommend. Malaika liked her, conveyed the same to Farah and a screen test was done. The rest is history.\"\n\nWell, that’s interesting isn’t it?"
