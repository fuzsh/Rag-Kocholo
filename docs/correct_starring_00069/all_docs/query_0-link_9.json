        "text": "‘Om Shanti Om’, which released in the year 2007, celebrates its 10 year anniversary today. The film, which starred Shah Rukh Khan, marked the debut of Deepika Padukone and directorial debut of Farah Khan. With a plot that paid tribute to classic Bollywood films and a song that brought together the who’s who of Bollywood, ‘Om Shanti Om’ garnered critical acclaim and box-office success. Here are five reasons why ‘Om Shanti Om’ was one of the most iconic films of the decade:\n\nTimeless Entertainer\n\n‘Om Shanti Om’ has all the ingredients of a blockbuster film: Romance, drama, action, comedy, entertainment, melodies and more. The film has stood the test of time because it beautifully weaved these magical elements together.\n\nTimeless Romance\n\nOm and Shanti’s romance is the stuff fairy tales are made of! Their love transcends time and space and makes us believe in true love!\n\nTimeless Tunes\n\nComposed by Vishal-Shekhar, the film’s music is still etched in people’s hearts. From the mesmerizing ‘Aankhon Mein Teri’ to the foot-tapping ‘Dard-e-Disco’, ‘Om Shanti Om’ is truly a landmark album.\n\nTimeless Drama\n\nBollywood blockbusters are incomplete without a pinch of drama. For Om Shanti Om, Farah Khan roped in the inimitable Kirron Kher for the job.\n\nTimeless Comedy\n\nTimeless comedies are those that make you laugh even when you have watched the scene before /heard the joke before! ‘Om Shanti Om’ easily is a timeless comedy because of its fresh brand of humor."
