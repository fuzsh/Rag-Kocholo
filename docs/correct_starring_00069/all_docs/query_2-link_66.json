        "text": "Owen Teague is best known among moviegoers for playing Patrick Hockstetter in Warner Bros.’ horror franchise films “It” and “It Chapter Two.” He makes his Hollywood leading man debut via motion capture as “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” protagonist Noa, a young chimpanzee who sets out to bring his friends and family home when his colony is pillaged and destroyed.\n\n“We had a lot of pressure on us to find the person who can carry this trilogy,” director Wes Ball previously told Variety. “We needed someone who is kind of innocent and naive but can also be tough and strong. It was some kind of miracle that we met Owen.”\n\nTeague spent days at a Florida ape sanctuary in order to prepare for the role. That’s where he got up close and personal with primates — well, except for the orangutans. “Man, they smell terrible,” he told Variety. “Our evolutionary predecessors were stinky guys.”\n\nEven if you don’t know Kevin Durand by name, you are sure to have seen him on screen at some point thanks to his enduring career as a genre character actor in “Lost,” “The Strain,” “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” “Legion” and more. He stars in “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” as Proximus Caesar, a villainous bonobo monarch who rules over a clan of coastal apes and is hellbent on learning the ways of humans in order to maintain the dominance of apes around the world. Caesar is a despot who took his name from the last trilogy’s Caesar (Andy Serkis), as it has come to be associated with a godlike leader.\n\nPeter Macon is best known for playing Lt. Commander Bortus in Seth MacFarlane’s Fox/Hulu television series “The Orville,” and he brings much needed warmth and humanity to “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” as the supporting character Raka. An orangutan who knowledge of the past, Raka befriends Noa on his journey to find his lost colony and serves as a mentor to him. Raka is enlightened in all the teachings of Caesar (Andy Serkis) and advocates for a stronger world where apes and humans can co-exist together.\n\nAustralian actor Travis Jeffery stars as Anaya, a chimpanzee who is one of Noa’s close friends. The film begins with Noa and his friends Anaya and Soona hunting for eagle eggs as they will soon take part in one of their colony’s most sacred traditions in which they are bonded with a baby eagle. Anaya is one of Noa’s loved ones who is captured and imprisoned by Proximus Caesar, which sets Noa off on a mission to rescue him.\n\nSome moviegoers might recognize the name Neil Sandilands as he starred as Titus on the popular The CW dystopian drama series “The 100.” He has a supporting role in “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” as Koro, Noa’s intimidating father who is the leader of their colony. Koro is a master of the eagles, and every ape in his colony is raised to bond with an eagle.\n\nAustralian actor Eka Darville has one of the more memorable supporting roles in “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” as Silva, a 400-pound silverback gorilla who is Proximus Caesar’s henchman and hunts apes to serve under his leader.\n\nSpeaking to Variety at the film’s premiere, Elka said the “highlight of the entire” motion capture process was the freedom to escape himself and let his character completely take over.\n\n“We spent a lot of time just embodying these beings and these creatures, and that was the most transformative thing I’ve ever done as an actor,” Darville said. “You really get to be something else. I think we all crave that a little bit as actors.”\n\nEnglish actress Freya Allan broke out among genre fans with her role as Princess Cirilla of Cintra in the popular Netflix fantasy series “The Witcher.” Now she’s making her Hollywood leading lady debut as Mae in “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.” Mae is one of the few human characters audiences see in the new movie. She is introduced as a feral young woman stalking Noa for food after her human clan is murdered, leaving her alone and forced to fend for herself. But Mae is hiding some secrets that could end up leading to humanity’s chance to rise again.\n\nWilliam H. Macy shows up in “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” in a crucial supporting role. He plays Trevathan, a human who has become an ally and mentor to Proximus Caesar. Trevathan has all but given up on his allegiance to humans and has accepted a world in which apes are the dominant rulers. He lives a content life in Proximus Caesar’s kingdom and educates the despot on all things humans, from literature to technology. Trevathan’s ideology puts him at odds with Mae, who would very much like to see humans return to their dominant place on the social chain."
