        "text": "How did you get into acting?\n\nIt was a happy accident. I was six and loved dancing and performing. My dream at the time was to play “Matilda” on Broadway. My family and I were visiting Los Angeles for an “end of the summer” trip and my manager thought it would be a good idea for me to have a general meeting with a casting director who casts a lot of shows for the Disney Channel. So, I did. That meeting turned into three auditions, and I just happened to book all three. I was seven when I started filming “Stuck in the Middle” and finished by the time I was ten.\n\nWhat is it like working with such big names in the movie industry?\n\nWhen I was younger, half of the time I had no idea with whom I was working. I just thought they were cool, funny people. It was easier back then because I never felt starstruck or nervous. I would’ve never thought that I’d have the opportunity to work with such incredible actors and for that I’m extremely thankful. When I get the chance to work with such talented people, like Margot Robbie or Cate Blanchett, I just spend all my time observing them, learning from them, and admiring their work ethic. I get close to people with whom I work and I’m so happy that we can have these sweet relationships.\n\nWho are your acting inspirations?\n\nI have a long list so here we go. I really love and look up to Natalie Portman, Saoirse Ronan, Jim Carrey, Margot Robbie, Mia Goth, Joaquin Phoenix, Zoe Saldaña, and so many more.\n\nSince you are only a teenager, how do you balance your school/social life alongside acting?\n\nI would say I’m still trying to find that balance. It’s not easy to do both, but I’m fortunate to have a great team that understands my school life and plans meetings, fittings, interviews, etc. all around my school schedule. They also take the time to include my favorite set of teachers that I travel with on any job. Luckily, I’ve known and worked with them all since the beginning. Shout out to Trish and Ruthie. It’s really important for me to have teachers who understand me and can tell if I get overwhelmed with work and school. I also always have my Mom with me. She travels with me and helps keep things organized. She loves decorating my trailers/dressing rooms so that I feel calm and comfortable if I want to take naps during lunch, lol. Social life has always been pretty tricky for me. I still go to normal school which I love but there are definitely times where it gets hard to relate to everyone because my lifestyle is different from theirs. High school can be tough, and most times I feel like I’m living a double life. But my family gives me a lot of strength and encouragement. It’s good to have an older brother and a Dad who’ve been there and done that. It takes a village.\n\n“Barbie” is one of the most anticipated movies of the summer. Tell us what it was like working on set.\n\nIt was everything you could imagine and hope for. Everyone on set, whether it be crew, cast, production, etc., were always happy to be there. It was honestly the privilege of my life to have Greta and Margot trust me to play their “Sasha.” The set design was incredible and everyone worked so hard to make Barbieland come to life. Every morning Micheal (Cera) and I would play Wordle and that’s definitely something I’ll never forget. I love all the Barbies and Kens and Allan, of course, so much.\n\nHow was your role in “Barbie” different from your previous roles?\n\nWell, for one thing, I was playing a normal teenage girl. No alien makeup or blood and dirt. It was refreshing to play someone whom many people, including me, could relate to. I got to wear normal clothes and be on earth so that was exciting for me. Although Sasha is a normal girl she is put in some not normal situations.\n\nWhat was the most exciting part about being on the set of “Barbie?”\n\nThe most exciting part about being on the set for me was the people with whom I got to spend my days. The energy and love were so special. I know that sounds cliche but walking on set every morning and seeing something new and pink was a highlight. Some of the crew members in London I had worked with before on “The One and Only Ivan” so that was really comforting. Going into this project I hated pink, and now it’s honestly my favorite color. I also really looked forward to Wednesdays, because every Wednesday the entire crew had to wear something pink. The cast didn’t because we were already in pink. I still see Greta in her pink jumpsuit, I love it.\n\nWhat helps you get into your characters in these different movies?\n\nMy biggest thing is getting to know my character. I like to build backstories and find the character’s body language or how she says things. If I’m lucky enough to have a director who likes to collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other then I definitely do that. Making mood boards on my Pinterest helps me get into character too, oddly enough.\n\nHow does it feel to be cast in these big roles?\n\nIt feels really great. You know, every project I do I learn so much from and try to take the opportunity to grow as an actor. I love storytelling and being able to play with these actors that I’ve loved since the beginning. I’m insanely honored and thrilled to see what’s next. I never for one moment take these experiences and opportunities for granted.\n\nWhat does it mean to you to be a part of these anticipated films?\n\nIt’s so cool. Even though I’m a part of these films, I still feel like a fan waiting for them to come out. It’s nerve-racking too. For the months to years after production, these films feel like just me and the cast and crew’s little secret. No one knows what we’ve spent so long working on, so for them to come out and have everyone see them is scary. But I’m really proud of “Barbie” and can’t wait for people to see what I’ve been trying not to spoil for a long time.\n\nDo you have a favorite role that you have played?\n\nEach role I’ve taken on is so different and means so much to me in their own way. Most of my projects that have come out recently, I filmed when I was much younger. Watching those films now is like watching a completely different person. But at this moment, I’m going to pick “Sasha” as my favorite role. She was exciting to play and I finally was able to be a normal teenage girl with normal girl problems."
