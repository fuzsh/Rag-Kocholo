Especially when the title is a phrase that’s not so easy to sneak in. “Dude, where’s my car?” is a gimmie, but kudos, Nic Cage, for “wild … at heart.”\n\nThe compilation video above, featuring scenes from 150 films, was put together by an editor who calls himself Roman Holiday. It’s such silly fun watching a lot of fine—and some not-so-fine—actors doing their best to pretend they don’t know what they’ve just done. (Looking at you, Benedict Cumberbatch.)"
