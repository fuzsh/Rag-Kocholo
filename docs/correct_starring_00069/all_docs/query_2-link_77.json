        "text": "Bimbo Akintola, a Nigerian movie star, has stated that an actor should be able to play any character and believes that no part is beneath them.\n\nThe Nollywood actress stated that she takes pride in her ability to play a range of parts, and she believes that directors use performers as tools to portray diverse tales.\n\nAkintola stated this in an interview with The Punch, where she discussed how she has managed to stay relevant in the profession for decades.\n\nShe said; “It is an actor’s job to play any role. There is no such thing as a role being beneath an actor. As a true artist, one should take on any challenge that comes towards one. As an actor, I pride myself on being able to interpret different roles. An actor is a tool that the director uses to tell a story.”\n\nThe popular thespian was also asked about the criteria she considers before taking a movie part, and she stated that her decision is based on the character after reading the screenplay.\n\nShe highlighted that it is crucial for it to transmit a message because she wants there to be more stories that bring about positive change.\n\nAkintola said; “When it comes to movies, I usually accept them based on how I feel about the character I’m playing. It also depends on what the story is saying; as well as how it would impact women and children. I think about women and children first before I think of men. That is because we are the most vulnerable groups on earth."
