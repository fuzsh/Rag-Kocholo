        "text": "If you are a fan of Kirron Kher, then take our Bollywood quiz and guess her films like ‘Devdas’, ‘Dostana’ from her famous dialogues.\n\nAs ‘Main Hoon Na’ completes twenty years today, here’s a look at the movie's cast, how they were then and how they are now, and more.\n\nIn a social media video director Karan Johar posted, his friend and ‘India's Got Talent’ co-judge Kirron Kher can be seen comparing K.Jo to Anarkali. Meant to be ‘friendly banter’, the commentary is loaded with problematic stereotypes about conventional masculinity. Here’s why such comments are damaging.\n\nOn her birthday today, we celebrate Kirron Kher’s memorable roles as a Punjabi mother. From playing a filmy mom in ‘Om Shanti Om’ and a cool mom in ‘Khoobsurat’, Kirron Kher has always been a perfect maa. Now identify her roles from just a still in our quiz.\n\nBeing a single parent can be quite challenging, especially in a country like India. Let’s take a look at some movies that captured the essence of being a single parent in India.\n\nWatching Om Shanti Om after 13 years, you’d think that the film might have lost its charm but nope, it’s still one of the finest masala films made in the last 20 years. It’s got action, drama, horror, thrill--you name it! Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone bring this reincarnation film to life.\n\nAre you a huge fan of veteran Bollywood actress Kirron Kher? Take our trivia quiz on her famous movie dialogues and guess which of her films the following funny lines are from. From ‘Khoobsurat’ and ‘Dostana’ to ‘Main Hoon Na’ and ‘Om Shanti Om’, she has starred in many popular comedies.\n\nOn Bollywood’s iconic couple Anupam and Kirron Kher’s 35th Anniversary, we take a trip down memory lane and look back at their love story. Take a look at their heartwarming messages for each other on their special day too!\n\nIf Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s 2002 film Devdas is remade, here’s who we think should play the roles. Devdas, played by Shah Rukh Khan, should be played by Ranveer Singh. Paro, played by Aishwarya Rai, should be played by Deepika Padukone. Priyanka Chopra should play Madhuri Dixit’s character Chandramukhi, and Nushrat Bharucha should play Kumud, while Rana Daggubati would be great as Kalibabu.\n\nIf you have grown up watching a lot of Bollywood movies and either hating/loving the onscreen mom, then it’s time you took this quiz to know which Bollywood mom matches your personality.\n\nPrivilege and an influential background doesn’t always guarantee success in Bollywood. Here are 10 actors who tanked in Bollywood despite nepotism.\n\nKaran Johar is probably going to announce Dostana 2 tomorrow, or so netizens believe. He shared a cryptic video on his social media fueling speculations.\n\nIt’s 10 years of Dostana, and we are still talking about it--so Karan Johar must have done something right with that one.\n\nMalaika Arora Khan and Arjun Kapoor have been ‘good friends’’ for a really long time but we’re not sure all good friends walk hand in hand like this.\n\nDostana was definitely a game changer for mainstream Bollywood. But, we wish certain things were not treated in such a ham-fisted manner. Homosexuality is not comedic fodder.\n\nAs Om Shanti Om turns 10, we remember all the epic dialogues of the movie.\n\nNot to discourage all the pop culture aficionados and unbelievable talent we have now, but the late 90s-early 2000s were by far the best years for musical television. The peak years of MTV and Channel [V], the late 90s saw the emergence of some of our favourite television personalities and V.Js who we still love and miss. They covered everything from music, to fashion to crazy ass reality and prank shows, and we miss timing the rest of our day to catch our favourite show. There was just something about the television of that time, that is lacking BIGTIME right now, and there’s no doubt that it was because of the people who hosted these shows. Luckily for us though, there are still a number of our favourite VJs who are currently active in Bollywood, television and music. Ride this wave of nostalgia with us, as we catch up with what they’re doing now.\n\nOn Kirron Kher’s 62nd birthday, here’s our ode to the woman who channelled every desi mom with perfection.\n\nIf you’re close to your mother, you know that it is one of the most important and beautiful relationships you can ever have. You are each other’s strength, best friends and as you get older, you even take on the role of their parent, sometimes. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have disagreements or come close to pulling each other’s hair out, occasionally! If you and your mum share a close relationship, you’re definitely going to know these 14 moments.\n\nThere weren't as many stars in the sky last night as the ones that descended at Amitabh Bachchan's Diwali party at his palatial residence, Jalsa, which is one of the most favourite landmarks in Mumbai. The Bachchans are known to host an extravagant Diwali party every year and this year too was no exception.\n\nWe constantly crib about Indian television shows because, frankly, most of the story lines have been done to death. Whether it’s love stories, family dramas or even stories about social issues, there’s really nothing dynamic about the plots. Luckily though, the gamut of Indian television shows doesn’t just comprise soap operas. There are a few reality shows on air that are worthy your time, thanks to the talented and driven people they feature. Here are three reality shows that you should tune into.\n\nIndia’s Got Talent is one of our favourite reality shows. We love the multitude of sheet talent that pours in from different parts of the country. We also love the judges panel, especially Kirron Kher who has been involved since season one, way back from 2009. We dig the designer saris and traditional Indian jewellery but it’s her warm, friendly demeanour has always been a comforting factor for the show’s contestants and the audience.\n\nBollywood actresses are trendsetters in themselves. Be it fashion, beauty, travel, they are an inspiration. We think they are just super-badass who need to be applauded all the time. These are the some amazing things which Bollywood actresses did in 2015 and made us super proud.\n\nSo, Khoobsurat is pretty - and pretty hilarious. Dr. Mrinalini Chakravarty aka Mili (Sonam) is a physiotherapist, hired to help Rajasthan royal Shekhar Rathore (Aamir Raza). Rani Nirmala (Ratna) and Yuvraj Vikram (Fawad) expect a quiet medic who will blend blandly into royal discipline - but they get a live-wire who teases the dishy Yuvraj, 'Raja log praja ke saath party nahin karte?', whose therapy includes drinking wine with her charge, who crushes paapads noisily onto regal china, and who, in striped PJs and cartoon-coloured T-shirts, is no fashionista.\n\nMost of us are caught in an embarrassing situation at some point or the other. But what if during one of those situations you were caught by your parents? How are you going to react? Watch these HILARIOUS ‘caught in the act’ videos and give us your reaction.\n\nWomen empowerment symbolised by supreme feminine grace, a compassionate nature to nurture and a strong forte to balance family and career - these are the multiple themes that 15-year-old Gayatri Ketharaman explored to win Google’s Children’s Day Doodle contest in India. Type Google on your browser to check out this teenager’s brilliant work of art.\n\nSingleton Yami Gautam believes being in a relationship is all about how your man makes you feel.\n\n\"Gulbadan refers to a woman’s body fashioned after a flower\", says Gaurang. Like the name of his collection, the inspiration comes from the forgotten land of Persia. It intricately combines kota from Rajasthan and chikankari from the nawab’s of Lucknow – a combination that looks as majestic as it sounds. But then again, it takes a maverick like Gaurang Shah to place two opposing fabrics on the same canvas and weave magic into them. In a tete-a-tete with the designer, we unravel his story and creative streak\n\nThe grand finale of India's Got Talent was a star-studded affair with the lead cast of the film Jab Tak Hai Jaan visiting the sets of the popular TV reality show. We bring you some exclusive snapshots from the mega show right here.\n\nOur B-town celebrities surely know to live life king size! And this year, most of the A-listers took out time from their busy schedules to celebrate Diwali with much pomp and fanfare. Check out these pictures to see who all attended Shilpa Shetty, Amitabh Bachchan and Ekta Kapoor's lavish Diwali parties.\n\nCome Diwali, and everyone has yet another reason to party. At least such was the case for Shilpa Shetty and the Bachchans, who seemed to have invited all the industry bigwigs to bring in the New Year. While we spotted quite a few celebs, expectedly in their Tarun Tahilianis and Manish Malhotras, here's a sneak peek in to the starry bashes of tinsel town\n\nSome of the biggest TV actors and Bollywood personalities attended the recently held Indian Telly Awards 2012 in Mumbai. Some stood out in their statement outfits, others made their presence felt with their better halves on the blue carpet. Take a look at some of the celebrities who made our heads turn!\n\nHema Malini talks about her unconventional marriage to Dharmendra, & her daughters\n\nMoet & Chandon threw an anniversary bash for designer duo Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, who have completed 25 years in the fashion industry. Friends and family came together at China House at the Grand Hyatt, Mumbai. Here’s who we spotted at the do\n\nWhile everybody is talking about Ash’s baby bump, the Bachchans are busy preparing to host a godh bharai ceremony for the gorgeous mom-to-be! We heard that mom-in-law Jaya Bachchan has chalked out a grand baby shower for her daughter-in-law on October 18 at the Bachchan residence. The ceremony will be carried out in a very traditional manner and has some delicious food apart from song and dance programmes! High society celebs Gauri Khan, Sussanne Roshan, Maanayata Dutt, Maheep Kapoor, Kajol, Kirron Kher, Sridevi, Sonali Bendre among others will attend the ceremony. The Bollywood actress, who is all glowing, is due to deliver next month. We are sure the Bachchans have enough reason to celebrate!\n\nShe's a cult queen in customised accessories. Even Angelina Jolie loves her funky bags. She's got India on her bags -- the motifs, funky designs and ethnic fabrics. Meet Meera Mahadevia, the stylish 'accessory' designer, who has stormed the world with her 'heirloom bags, belts and sandals.'\n\nFrom Hrithik Roshan and Ranbir Kapoor to Shilpa Shetty and Dia Mirza, most of B'Town came together for Shabana Azmi's fashion show to raise funds for upliftment of rural women. While we thought all these stars looked hot in desi avatars, there are a few who looked hotter. Check them out\n\nDirector Farah Khan knows exactly what she wants (rather what she can get) from her cast and employs them to that effect. But sadly, Tees Maar Khan doesn’t even guarantee thirty good laughs in its three hour runtime."
