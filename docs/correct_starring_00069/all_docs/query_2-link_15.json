        "text": "When Shelley Duvall accepted the role of Wendy Torrance in “The Shining,” playing the wife to Jack Nicholson’s demented character Jack Torrance, she had only made a handful of movies at the beginning of what would become a three-decade career in Hollywood with more than 50 credits to her name.\n\nAlthough not considered her best performance at the time, the role in Stanley Kubrick’s horror film based on Stephen King’s novel of the same name, however, became the role more associated with her name than any other title in her repertoire. Prior to the horror masterpiece, Duvall had other notable roles, including a small part in the classic Woody Allen romantic comedy “Annie Hall” and the role of Millie in “Three Women,” which garnered her the best actress award at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe 75-year-old actress passed away on Thursday, July 11 from complications of diabetes.\n\nAs headlines announced the news of her death, more often than not they also included a reference to “The Shining,” continuing her connection to the film she described as physically and emotionally exhausting to make.\n\nA memorial in honor of Duvall quickly sprung up last week in the lobby of The Stanley Hotel, which too has been associated with the macabre storyline of “The Shining” more than any other event that has taken place at the historic hotel.\n\nStephen King penned the horror novel after a one-night stay at the Estes Park hotel in 1974. That short stay – and the dreams he had during the night – gave him the idea of a story about a creatively blocked writer turned hotel caretaker who becomes psychotic and attempts to kill his family. Duvall’s wide-eyed character turns out to the be the Gothic heroine of the horror film, leaving her husband to, well, let’s not reveal the ending for the few who haven’t watched the film.\n\nAlthough the movie was not filmed in Estes Park, a television series based on the book was. Duvall did not participate in the series and research has not shown any visit by Duvall to the hotel that inspired the horror novel.\n\nThe memorial has been removed from the lobby but the association with “The Shining” for Duvall and The Stanley Hotel will forever be connected in history.\n\nThe Stanley Hotel will be the site for a new horror movie museum curated by horror film production company Blumhouse. One of the items already procured for the exhibit is a prop axe from “The Shining” used in the famous “Here’s Johnny” scene when Jack Nicholson’s character chops through a wood door with the tool."
