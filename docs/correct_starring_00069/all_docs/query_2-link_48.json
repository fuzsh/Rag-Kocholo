        "text": "After appearing as Alyssa Targaryen on House of the Dragon Season 2, learn more about actress Emeline Lambert.\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 5, Alyssa appears in a dream sequence experienced by her son, Daemon Targaryen, played by Matt Smith.\n\nAlyssa Targaryen is an important figure in Targaryen history. She was the mother of Daemon Targaryen, who was just three years old when she died giving birth to his brother, Aegon II.\n\n[ Who's the Woman In Bed With Daemon In House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 5? ]\n\nMeet Emeline Lambert - Biography Details\n\nEmeline Lambert Got Her Training at National Youth Theater\n\nEmeline Lambert honed her acting skills at the prestigious National Youth Theater (NYT) in London.\n\nFounded in 1956, the NYT is renowned for nurturing young talent. It offers training that emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and practical experience. Alumni include acclaimed actors like Helen Mirren and Daniel Craig.\n\nLambert's training at NYT has undoubtedly contributed to her versatile acting abilities, preparing her for complex roles like Alyssa Targaryen.\n\nEmeline Starred in the Short Film Longing\n\nBefore her breakout role in House of the Dragon, the 5' 8\" actress played Lena in the short film Longing.\n\nLonging features Lambert alongside Kae Alexander and Alex Chang. Directed and written by Courteney Tan, the film follows a Malaysian woman with a secret who embarks on an impromptu date with another woman the night before her flight home.\n\nTan detailed the production challenges to Erato Magazine, including night shoots and logistical issues, but praised the cast and crew's dedication.\n\nThe film, funded by the British Film Institute in 2022, \"was quite challenging,\" according to the director, adding that \"short films are always challenging as often there is not enough time or money for what you’re trying to do:\"\n\n\"We put in an application to the BFI and we were awarded funding in 2022. So the first few months of that year were spent rewriting the script, casting, location scouting, and crewing up leading to our shoot which took place in August. The shoot was quite challenging, in as much as we were shooting nights and there were a few hiccups with locations and equipment along the way, but the cast and crew were truly brilliant. Short films are always challenging as often there is not enough time or money for what you’re trying to do, but having a crew who are either passionate enough about the story or their craft and are willing to stay calm and give it their all really makes a difference.\"\n\nIn addition, the film was shortlisted for the Iris Prize, an honor that Tan described as a special recognition despite the varying feedback it received:\n\n\"Yes absolutely. I’ve always been a fan of Iris Prize so it was really special to be recognised by them! We traveled to Cardiff to attend the festival and it was great to see our film play with the other shorts nominated. In terms of feedback, it does matter but I think it’s important to know that you’re not going to please everyone – some people might like your work and others might hate it – and that’s ok!\"\n\nEmeline Has a Lot of Talents\n\nLambert's acting CV is impressive, showcasing many skills beyond her acting prowess.\n\nShe is well-trained in various accents and dialects, including French, Received Pronunciation, and Swedish. She has a high standard of American accents from California, New York, Southern States, and Standard American.\n\nIn addition to her linguistic talents, Lambert excels in music and dance, with skills in ballet, contemporary dance, hip-hop, jazz dancing, and general singing.\n\nShe is also skilled in Pilates and yoga, demonstrating her versatility and dedication to maintaining a well-rounded skill set for her acting career.\n\nHouse of the Dragon is Emeline's Biggest Role Yet\n\nPortraying Alyssa Targaryen in House of the Dragon marks Lambert's most significant role to date, with a potential for future dream-state appearances.\n\nBefore this, Lambert appeared in the TV series Django and Invasion Season 2, showcasing her acting range and ability to tackle diverse roles.\n\nEmeline Lambert's journey in the entertainment industry is just beginning, and her performance in House of the Dragon is set to propel her career to new heights.\n\nHouse of the Dragon is streaming on Max, and new episodes are released every Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nRead more about House of the Dragon on The Direct:\n\nWhy Is Vhagar So Big?
