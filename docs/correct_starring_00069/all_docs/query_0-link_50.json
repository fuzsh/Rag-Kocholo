        "text": "Bollywood's king Shah Rukh Khan had once said that he felt like a 'stalker uncle' in a particular scene with Deepika Padukone in their film Om Shanti Om, back in 2007.\n\nIt was Deepika's debut film and she was just 21 years old. SRK was 42 and the age gap between the two actors was nearly 20 years.\n\nShah Rukh-Deepika worked with choreographer-filmmaker Farah Khan to romance each other in Om Shanti Om.\n\nThe trio graced an episode in the second season of Karan Johar's chat show Koffee With Karan in 2007.\n\nIn the episode, Karan talked to Shah Rukh about Deepika's thoughts on Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. The talk show host recalled her reply saying, \"Yeah, I loved it. I saw it when I was 11 years old.\"\n\nHe went on to joke that she was just 8 years old during the release of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge in 1995.\n\nThen, Karan asked Shah Rukh, \"Did you ever feel strange that you were working with someone who's actually literally seen you as a child?\" To which he replied, \"I think my first realisation that I am doing a few silly things at my age is when I did the first scene.\"\n\nThe actor further added, \"I started feeling jhoota (liar). I started feeling, may I say the word, little stalker uncle, little kamina (bad). Ki main kya yeh choti si bacchi k liye aese peeche peeche kar k bhag raha hoon (That I am running after this little girl)?\"\n\nEveryone was shocked, when Farah further added, \"Let me just tell you that the scene is fab. He's done it superbly.\"\n\nKaran also questioned Deepika if there were any nervous moments while working with SRK. Shah Rukh said while laughing, \"A couple of times, she said, 'I love you, uncle'.\""
