Spanning three decades, the film stars Shah Rukh Khan as Om, a junior artist in 1977 who has a crush on a secretly-married superstar, played by Deepika Padukone in her Hindi film debut. Her lover, a producer played by Arjun Rampal, kills her in a fire; Om witnesses this and dies from the injuries sustained from trying to rescue her. Reincarnated as a superstar in 2007, he seeks to avenge his love. The film also starred Shreyas Talpade, Kirron Kher, Nitesh Pandey, Yuvika Chaudhary, Asawari Joshi, Bindu Desai and Javed Sheikh feature in supporting roles, and saw cameos from many Bollywood celebrities in several sequences and songs.\n\nOm Shanti Om was produced and presented by Shah Rukh's wife Gauri Khan under the banner Red Chillies Entertainment on a budget of â‚¹30 crore. Farah conceived the film while directing the musical Bombay Dreams (2002), which was based on the Indian film industry. After Shah Rukh rejected the first version of her next film Happy New Year, she was reminded of Om Shanti Om; the film's title derives from a similar titled popular song from the 1980 film Karz. The soundtrack album was composed by Vishalâ€“Shekhar, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. The background score was performed by Sandeep Chowta. The album received positive reviews and was also commercially successful, becoming the highest-selling album of the year in India.\n\nThe film was theatrically released in India on 9 November 2007 during Diwali weekend, Om Shanti Om earned over â‚¹149 crore worldwide becoming the highest grossing Bollywood fi\n\n#arjunrampal #rampal72 #arjunrampal_radha #elegant #arjunrampalofficial #modeling #handsome #bhaijaan #shahrukhkhan #shooting #indianmalemodelsðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ #indianmodelshouts #instagram #instabollywood #omshantiom #modelindian #indian #rohitbal #hottes #hotmodels #manishmalhotra #loveyoubhai #yogenshah #voompla #viralbhayani #manavmanglani #delhitimes #hindustantimes #gabriellademetriades #memories\".",
