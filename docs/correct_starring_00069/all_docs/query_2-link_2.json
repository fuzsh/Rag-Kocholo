It earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[11] Later that year, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of the musical Cabaret.\n\nStone won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as an aspiring actress in Damien Chazelle's musical La La Land (2016).[12] She also recorded six songs such as \"City of Stars\" for the film's soundtrack.
