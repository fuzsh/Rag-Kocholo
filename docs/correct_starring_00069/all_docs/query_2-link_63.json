        "text": "Shelley Duvall, known for a bunch of incredible roles in her decades-long career in acting, died at the age of 75, with her partner Dan Gilroy telling multiple publications that she died in her sleep on Thursday from complications due to diabetes.\n\nDuvall started her career in 1970 and became a favorite of director Robert Altman, as you’ll see below, as she starred in multiple films of his. She also worked with names like Terry Gilliam and Stanley Kubrick.\n\nAs we say goodbye to Duvall, let’s take a look back at some of the more iconic roles she had during her career.\n\n3 Women\n\nMcCabe & Mrs. Miller\n\nThe Shining\n\nPopeye\n\nTime Bandits"
