Have an account? .\n\nMany iconic TV and movie roles have been recast over time.\n\nOn \"Game of Thrones,\" the roles of The Mountain and The Night King were recast.\n\nTwo different actors played Lavender Brown in the \"Harry Potter\" film series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Night King switched actors after season five on \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nThe change in the appearance of the Night King in \"Game of Thrones\" easily went unnoticed under all the make-up and CGI that the character endures.\n\nHowever, after season five, Richard Brake was replaced by stunt performer Vladimir Furdik.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPam's mother on \"The Office\" was recast after a few seasons.\n\nThroughout the beginning of the NBC comedy \"The Office,\" actress Shannon Cochran plays Pam Beesly's mother.\n\nBut on season six, episode five (\"Niagara: Part 2\"), actress Linda Purl appears as Pam's mother instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo people played Thanos in \"The Avengers\" franchise.\n\nAt the end of \"The Avengers,\" fans got a tease of what was to come for Marvel's next two phases with a scene introducing the new villain, Thanos.\n\nDamion Poitier filled this role, unceremoniously credited as \"Man #1.\"\n\nWhen Marvel needed a bigger name to fill Thanos's shoes, Josh Brolin was cast for \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeg was voiced by Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert on \"Family Guy.\"\n\nMila Kunis is now famous for voicing the role of Meg on the animated series \"Family Guy,\" but she was not the original voice actress.\n\n\"Mean Girls\" star Lacey Chabert was the voice of Meg for the entire first season before leaving due to other obligations. They eventually acknowledged this swap during a season-eight gag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarol from \"Friends\" was played by two different women.\n\n\"Friends\" has a huge fanbase and many binge-watchers may have likely noticed this change by now. However, when Ross's ex-wife Carol first appears on season one she was played by Anita Barone.\n\nLater on, Barone was replaced by Jane Sibbett, who went on to make the character her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlair's mom on \"Gossip Girl\" was recast early on.\n\nThe CW drama \"Gossip Girl\" featured actress Florencia Lozano as Blair's mom, Eleanor Waldorf, on the pilot.\n\nBut by episode four, she'd been replaced by Margaret Colin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo actors played Bloodraven on \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nDuring the season-four finale, Bran finally met the Bloodraven, played by British actor Struan Rodger.\n\nBut a few seasons later he was replaced by the well-known Swedish actor Max Von Sydow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo actors played Lavender Brown in the \"Harry Potter\" movie series.\n\nIn her only credited role, actress Jennifer Smith played Lavender Brown in the \"Harry Potter\" film, \"The Prisoner of Azkaban,\" which was her only appearance in the franchise.\n\nThe role of Lavender was recast as Jessie Cave in \"The Half-Blood Prince.\"\n\nUnnoticed at the time, discussions about diversity in the \"Harry Potter\" series and spin-offs have ignited debate over whether the recasting of the role was a result of whitewashing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmperor Palpatine was played by two actors in \"Star Wars.\"\n\nThe antagonist of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, Emperor Palpatine was played by Marjorie Eaton and then voiced by Clive Revill in his first appearance in \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n\nFor \"Return of the Jedi\" and the prequel films, Ian McDiarmid was cast in the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnn on \"Arrested Development\" was played by two actresses.\n\nOn \"Arrested Development,\" Ann was George Michael's often-forgotten girlfriend. She was played by Alessandra Torresani on the first season but replaced by Mae Whitman on the second.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDash was voiced by two different child actors in \"The Incredibles\" and its sequel.\n\nIn the original Pixar superhero hit, middle child Dash was voiced by child actor Spencer Fox.\n\nIn the 2018 reboot, \"Incredibles 2\" Fox was replaced with Huckleberry \"Huck\" Milner, due to the fact that the sequel takes place immediately following the original, even though it debuted 14 years after the first movie released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Mountain from \"Game of Thrones\" has been played by three actors.\n\nThis role of The Mountain has been recast twice. On the first season, Gregor Clegane was played by Conan Stevens. Recurring \"Game of Thrones\" actor Ian Whyte took up the Mountain mantle on season two.\n\nFrom season four on, the role was filled by the strongest man in the world Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Harry Potter\" character Griphook was played by two actors.\n\nIn the first \"Harry Potter\" movie, the Goblin banker Griphook was played by Verne Troyer but voiced by Warwick Davis.\n\nDavis, who also played Professor Flitwick in the franchise, went on to take over the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Parker in \"Back to the Future\" was played by two different actresses.\n\nThe love interest of Marty McFly, Jennifer Parker was originally portrayed by Claudia Wells.\n\nFor parts two and three of the film series, Wells was recast and the role of Jennifer was played by Elisabeth Shue. The time-traveling nature of the second movie forced scenes from the first movie to be remade shot for shot, with Shue as Jennifer instead of Wells.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarice Starling in the \"Red Dragon\" movies was played by two different actresses.\n\nDespite winning an Oscar for her performance in the 1991 film \"Silence of the Lambs,\" Jodie Foster dropped out of playing Clarice in the flick's sequel.\n\nJulianne Moore replaced Foster in the 2001 movie \"Hannibal.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree different women played Catwoman on the \"Batman\" TV show.\n\nOn the 1960 \"Batman\" TV show, Lee Meriwether, Julie Newmar, and Eartha Kitt all played the caped crusader's nemesis, Catwoman. That's one Catwoman per season.\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
