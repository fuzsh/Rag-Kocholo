        "text": "Credit: Getty Images(2)\n\nStars Who Left Hollywood Behind Over the Years: Cameron Diaz, Michael Schoeffling and More\n\nCelebrities such as Cameron Diaz and Rick Moranis rose to stardom in Hollywood — only to leave their acting careers in the past. Diaz got her start with a role alongside Jim Carrey in the 1994 film The Mask. The actress continued to find success with movies including My Best Friend's Wedding, There's Something About Mary, Vanilla Sky, Charlie's Angels and many more. After exchanging vows with Benji Madden in 2015, the Golden Globe nominee confirmed her decision to step away from acting. She welcomed daughter Raddix in 2019 via surrogate. In August 2020, the California native reflected on her decision to hit pause on her career. “I really looked at my life and I saw what I had been — when you’re making a movie, it’s the perfect excuse, they own you — and I realized I handed off parts of my life to all these other people,” she explained during an episode of the “In Goop Health: The Sessions” video series. “They took it. I basically had to take it back and take responsibility for my life.” Moranis, for his part, made a name for himself starring in projects including Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Ghostbusters. The comedian stepped away from Hollywood to focus on raising his children, Mitchell and Rachel, after his wife, Ann Belsky, died of cancer in 1991. The actor offered a rare glimpse into his decision, telling USA Today in 2005, \"I pulled out of making movies in about ’96 or ’97. I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn’t miss it.\" Scroll down for more stars who chose to part ways with Hollywood over the years:\n\nCredit: CW\n\nIan Somerhalder\n\n\"I stepped away from acting a little over four years ago to raise my kids, build my companies and get these films launched,\" Somerhalder, who is best known for his role as Damon on The Vampire Diaries, told E! News in November 2023 about choosing to raise a family with wife Nikki Reed over his acting career.\n\nTwo months later, Somerhalder said he now prioritized being a producer on documentaries, adding, \"I love what I did for a really long time. I love making films, I just did it for so long. We had an amazing run. But this is our 2.0 version — about to be 3.0 version.\"\n\nCredit: Desiree Stone/Getty Images\n\nAngus T. Jones\n\nJones is best known for his role as Jake Harper on Two and a Half Men, in which he starred alongside Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen. Following his time on the sitcom, Jones largely removed himself from the public eye.\n\nThe former actor made headlines in 2012 when he urged viewers to stop watching Two and a Half Men.\n\n\"I'm on Two And A Half Men, and I don't want to be on it. Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth … If I am doing any harm, I don’t want to be here,” he said in a YouTube video filmed for the Forerunner Christian Church, which he has since departed. “I don’t want to be contributing to [Satan's] plan. You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I know I can't. I'm not OK with what I'm learning, what the Bible says and being on that television show.\"\n\nJones later released a statement walking back his criticism, telling TMZ, \"While I cannot address everything that has been said or right every misstatement or misunderstanding, there is one thing I want to make clear. Without qualification, I am grateful to and have the highest regard and respect for all of the wonderful people on Two and Half Men with whom I have worked over the past ten years and who have become an extension of my family.\"\n\nHe later attended University of Colorado Boulder, where he majored in environmental studies before switching to Jewish studies. Jones also joined the multimedia and event production company Tonite in 2016.\n\nCredit: Richard Milnes/Shutterstock\n\nMia Wasikowska\n\n\"If I can have the best of both worlds, which is dip in and out of it occasionally, I'd be really happy, but I wouldn't ever be in that place where I was just on a treadmill,\" the Alice in Wonderland actress told IndieWire in March 2023 about moving to Australia. \"I want to do more things in life other than be in a trailer.\"\n\nShe added: \"It's great, and there are lots of great things, [but] the perception of it is quite different from the reality, and it didn't suit me as a person. You can really lose perspective because you're treated quite strangely. When that's your only reality, it's quite strange.\"\n\nCredit: Gregory Pace/Shutterstock\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis\n\nThe England native had a lengthy career in Hollywood with roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. He also appeared in My Beautiful Laundrette, A Room with a View, The Boxer, The Age of Innocence and more.\n\nDay-Lewis is the only actor to have won three Best Actor Academy Awards and received a knighthood for his services to drama in 2014. Three years later, the Phantom Thread star issued a statement that he would no longer be working as an actor.\n\n“Daniel Day-Lewis will no longer be working as an actor,” the actor’s spokesperson told Variety in 2017. “He is immensely grateful to all of his collaborators and audiences over the many years. This is a private decision and neither he nor his representatives will make any further comment on this subject. ”"
