We have been overwhelmed by the love and support that the audience has given the show and can’t wait to dive back into the world of Silver Falls and the lives of these characters,\" Executive Producer, Melanie Halsall, previously said.\n\nAlthough the pre-production for the second season has been in the works since early last month, shooting will not start till next week and will wrap in November. Due to the pushed-back filming dates, it is likely that the release of the second season on Netflix will not happen until 2025.\n\n\"The saying It takes a village couldn’t be more true as it pertains to the success of My Life with the Walter Boys. From Ali Novak's original novel, brilliantly adapted by Melanie Halsall, to our wonderful cast who brought her characters to life, and Netflix’s steadfast commitment, we’re thrilled to continue Jackie’s journey with season two.\n\nThe series has amassed 20.3 million views reaching the top 10 in 88 countries.\"\n\nSend your news tips, story ideas, pictures, and videos to news@discoverairdrie.com.
