        "text": "As a youngster Kirron Kher played badminton with legend Prakash Padukone . So did her sister Kanwal who went on to be an Arjuna Awardee in the sport. The two sisyers, children of Colonel Thakar Singh were known as the Thakar Singh sisters of Chandigarh. Kirron ji however moved on to films and much later to politics as well. In the 2019 General elections, she retained her Chandigarh Parliamentary constituency by defeating a strong Congress candidate Pawan Kumar Bansal by 47000 votes. In 2014 too she had won as well, with an even more comfortable majority.\n\nOn her birthday on 14th June, lets reminiscence a trivia journey of some of her popular and hit films.\n\nSardari Begum; This movie was directed by Shyam Benegal. Kirron ji plays the title role of a singer and courtesan who achieves excellence in profession but has a sad personal life. The movie won 3 awards at the 44th National film awards including special jury award for Kirron ji, best supporting actress for Rajeshwari Sachdev and best Urdu feature film for producers Mahesh Bhatt and Amit Khanna.\n\nDarmiyaan; This is one of her best movies where director Kalpana Lajmi brings out Kirron Kher’s acting prowess to the maximum. The subject is sensitive- the life of an eunuch. Kirron ji plays a Bollywood super heroine of the bygone era and she hides the secrecy of her transgender son whom she calls her brother. Kirron Kher is magnificent and so is Arif Zakaria in the role of a lifetime.\n\nDevdas; Kirron Ji won the Filmfare best supporting actress for this Sanjay Leela Bhansali creation starring SRK, Madhuri and Aishwarya. The movie swept the awards , getting 5 National Awards and 10 Filmfare awards. She played the role of Sumitra, Paro’s( Aishwarys’s) mother.\n\nThere are several other movies in which Kirron Kher played important roles, usually as the hero’s mother. It has been said that while she was typecast as the Punjabi mummy, yet she managed to reinvent the role and put in something slightly different every time. Some of these movies are as follows;\n\nMain Hoon Naa; Kirron ji plays the role of Zayed Khan’s mother in this SRK movie. Another SRK movie in which Kirron ji plays an important mother roles is Om Shanti Om.\n\nIn Rang de Basanti, Kirron ji received the Filmfare award for best supporting actress for her role of Mitro, Aamir Khan’s mother.\n\nIn Dostana she played Abhishek Bachchan’s mother in a comic role.\n\nIn Khoobsoorat her role as Manju, where she though being Sonam Kapoor’s mother is more like a friend to her was highly appreciated. “Ma ka phone aaya, maa ka phone aaya” is Sonam’s caller tune and every time the phone rings, it drew peals of laughter from the audience.\n\nAs a television personality, Kirron ji is probably best known for her role as a Judge in “India’s got talent”. The show is popular and her popularity has ensured that she has been a judge for each and every season.\n\nBadminton, movies, TV Judge, social activist, filmstar, Member of Parliament. Kirron Kher wears many hats with aplomb.\n\nHappy birthday Kirron Ji"
