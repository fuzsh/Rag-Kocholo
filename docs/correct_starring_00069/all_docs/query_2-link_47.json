        "text": "Shannen Doherty, the actress behind culture-defining projects like Beverly Hills, 90210, Heathers, and Charmed, died on Saturday after a years-long struggle with cancer. She was 53.\n\n“It is with a heavy heart that I confirm the passing of actress Shannen Doherty. On Saturday, July 13, she lost her battle with cancer after many years of fighting the disease,” Doherty’s longtime publicist Leslie Sloane said in a statement to People on Sunday. “The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie. The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace.”\n\nDoherty rose to fame playing a slew of complicated characters in Heathers and Beverly Hills, 90210, a reputation painted as imitating real life as the actress captivated tabloid attention with rumors of high-profile feuds and a string of engagements and marriages. Yet she never saw her reputation as anything other than a refusal to stop standing up for herself, and she eventually reconciled with the cacophony of criticism that cast a shadow on her time in the limelight. “I have felt misunderstood my whole life,” she told People in 2019. “The only difference is that now I’m okay with it.”\n\nDoherty was born on April 12, 1971 in Memphis, Tennessee, the younger of two siblings raised in the Southern Baptist faith. The family relocated to Los Angeles when she was six, shortly before her father Tom’s company went under and the Dohertys went from living in luxury to eating rice every day. Her luck changed when actor-director Michael Landon cast her on Little House of the Prairie in 1982. She was just 10, and the acting legend imparted wisdom that carried Doherty through her hard years in Hollywood and beyond. “That show changed my life. Michael Landon was the one who said to me, ‘Always slick up for yourself. Never let anybody walk all over you. Be a strong woman,’ ” Doherty remembered in 1992.\n\nFollowing Prairie, Doherty starred in the 1985 teen comedy Girls Just Want to Have Fun with Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt, and the TV drama Our House in 1986. Two years later, she starred in the 1988 cult-classic Heathers, playing one of the titular mean-girl characters. The latter two roles caught the attention of actress Tori Spelling, who brought Doherty up to her mega-producer dad, Aaron Spelling. The two were tapped for Beverly Hills, 90210 in 1990, thrusting them into superstardom.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nDoherty played Brenda Walsh, an L.A. transplant from Minnesota who adapts to life in the affluent zip code. The show took off, but Doherty felt the heat of constant tabloid attention fueled by rumors of on-set trouble. Influenced by her turmoil on and off the set, fans formed “I Hate Brenda” clubs, and Doherty’s time on the show eventually came to an end in 1994 following a string of difficult moments and growing frustration with her chronic lateness.\n\n“There was definitely a time that I did not want to be there. I was unhappy. It sounds odd to say that I was on a hit show making a lot of money and I was unhappy, because it makes me sound unappreciative — I wasn’t. It’s just that the sacrifice at the time seemed too large to me,” Doherty told Entertainment Weekly in 2000 ahead of the show’s finale.\n\nUnbeknownst to her costars and producers, Doherty was having a hard time with both her personal life and father’s ongoing health struggles; she was engaged to three different men during the run of the show. She eventually married Ashley Hamilton during her last year on the show, though they divorced by the time she left the series in April 1994. For Doherty, all the struggles tied to an ever-present feeling: “Somebody had a problem with me being late, but perhaps they didn’t know I was late because my dad was in the hospital, or maybe because I was in a horrible marriage. I’m not saying it was all a misunderstanding, but a large portion of it was a misunderstanding,” Doherty recalled to People in 2019.\n\nRelated\n\nYet the issues didn’t stay on the 90210 set. When Doherty signed onto Aaron Spelling’s Charmed in 1998, she once again was lauded for her performance as Prue Halliwell, one of a trio of sister witches, and directed a few episodes of the series. But her time on the hit show once again ended early when she left in its third season, seemingly due to her ongoing issues with costar Alyssa Milano. “There was too much drama on the set and not enough passion for the work,” she told ET at the time. “I’m 30 years old and I don’t have time for drama in my life anymore.”\n\nShe stuck to the mantra, spending the early 2000s doing smaller TV roles and even reprised her role as Brenda in The CW spinoff 90210. With her return, Doherty turned the page on the bad press of the past. “I have a rep. Did I earn it? Yeah, I did. But, after a while you sort of try to shed that rep because you’re kind of a different person. You’ve evolved and all of the bad things you’ve done in your life have brought you to a much better place,” she told Parade in 2010.\n\nDoherty ended up needing that strength, and then some, as she faced breast cancer diagnoses in 2015 and again in 2019. Her first diagnosis came amid a legal battle with her former business manager, forcing her to reveal her health struggles as legal papers leaked. She underwent a unilateral mastectomy in May 2016 and announced she was in remission in 2017. Yet she was realistic about the chance of recurrence. “As every single one of my fellow cancer family knows, the next five years is crucial. Reoccurrences happen all the time,” she wrote on Instagram. “So with a heart that is certainly lighter, I wait.\n\n“I was always used to being the strong one, and during that time period, every wall I’d built up in my life came down,” she said of her first bout with the illness. “I also had a lot more time to look at myself and say, ‘I’m a pretty okay person and cut myself some slack.” It helped that her vulnerability started changing her public image. “I get a little less trolls and haters on social media now, so that’s good,” she said. “I think because cancer stripped me of my defense mechanisms, it allowed people to see all sides of me.”\n\nHer remission message turned out to be prophetic, as she was diagnosed with stage four cancer in 2019. “There are definitely days where I say, ‘Why me?’ And then I go, ‘Why not me? Who else?'” Doherty said at the time. “Who else besides me deserves this? None of us do.”\n\nThis felt especially true when, right after her second diagnosis, Doherty suffered another devastating blow: Her longtime friend and former Beverly Hills costar Luke Perry died in March 2019 of a massive stroke. “There is a special kind of love one has for each other when you are experiencing the journey we did on 90210 and of course, life in general. I will miss him every day. Every minute. Every second.”\n\nFollowing Perry’s death, Doherty rethought her initial denial to take part in the semi-reality show BH90210 with the surviving original cast. “I felt like it was a great opportunity to honor him,” she explained. “We went on this amazing journey together where we also got to really, sort of, heal through losing somebody who means the world to all of us.” Doherty also appeared on the Riverdale farewell episode to Perry.\n\nHer time back on the screen also offered her the opportunity to prove that her professional life would continue post-diagnosis. “A lot of people who get diagnosed with stage four, they sort of getting written off. It’s assumed that they cannot work or they can’t work at their full capacity. And that is not true,” she said.\n\nDoherty went back to work and also publicized the intimate moments that come with fighting the disease. In vulnerable Instagram posts, Doherty refused to shy away from the reality of the illness. “Is it all pretty? NO but it’s truthful and my hope in sharing is that we all become more educated, more familiar with what cancer looks like. I hope I encourage people to get mammograms, to get regular checkups, to cut [through] the fear and face whatever might be in front of you,” she wrote.\n\nJust weeks later, Doherty revealed that her breast cancer had metastized to her brain. She announced the news alongside an emotional video of her receiving radiation. “My fear is obvious… there was a lot going on in my life,” Doherty wrote. “But that fear…The turmoil…the timing of it all…This is what cancer can look like.”\n\nTrending\n\nJason Priestley, who played Doherty’s brother on 90210, paid tribute to the actress on social media Sunday. “Shocked and saddened to hear about the passing of my friend Shannen,” he wrote. “She was a force of nature and I will miss her. Sending love and light to her family in this dark time.”"
