        "text": "And so it begins..\n\nHello everyone!\n\nYesterday, I watched an amazing movie: Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (aka A Match Made By God).\n\nMy love affair with Bollywood began years ago, when I was still in high school. As an avid watcher of TCM (the classic movie channel), my favourite times were when they had themes, playing movies they would never normally play.\n\nOne day, they played Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (The Brave Shall Win the Bride), a Bollywood film starring Bollywood superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol. At over 3 hours, it certainly wasn’t quick and breezy, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away. The passion, the music, the costumes, the direction.. It was probably the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. It’s still one of my favourite movies ever, and I love sharing it with my friends who also like Bollywood. (I always forget that it’s roughly 3 hours, though, which occasionally becomes an issue.)\n\nOne thing I love about Bollywood is how they can express passion and True Love without resorting to nudity or unnecessary physical contact. While it’s not necessarily taboo for actors to kiss onscreen anymore, it’s still fairly rare to see it happen, and I appreciate that. (That isn’t to say that I don’t like a nice kiss now and then, but I don’t need to see it in EVERY MOVIE.)\n\nAlso, I love the emphasis on family that is so prevalent (although I could do with a little less filial obedience; I know I’d go crazy if I allowed my parents to run my life to the extent that some of these Indian people do), the realization that a One True Love is nice but not necessarily going to happen for everyone, the strange (to my Western eyes) mixture of feminine modesty and raw sexuality.. And of course, I love the costumes and the dance sequences. I think most people wish their life could be a musical, and I’m no exception.\n\nBut anyway. I’ve been ignoring my love of Bollywood for several months now, and yesterday I randomly began thinking about it again.\n\nOne of the girls I went to college with recently graduated and moved to India. She’s apparently taking India by storm, appearing on TV shows, the odd commercial here and there, and even a movie. (She’s a white girl, which makes this more interesting.)\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried to find the movie she’s been in, but I couldn’t remember the title. I did remember the actor she had a scene with, though–Shah Rukh Khan. King of Bollywood. Even my mother knows his name, and she only knows two Bollywood actors. (The other is Amitabh Batchan, who is a veteran acting god. She’s a bit of a fangirl of his, hehe.)\n\nSo, I’ve started downloading Shah Rukh Khan movies, beginning with the most recent and working my way backwards, hoping I’ll find it eventually. I haven’t found it yet, but I did find Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (among other things I haven’t watched yet). And oh my god, I’m glad I did. I’ll recap it in the next post.\n\nIn fact, it’s that movie that inspired me to start this blog. I was sitting in my Korean lesson with my friend, chattering at her about the movie I watched last night, and I realized that it’s highly possible she doesn’t care, but is too polite to say anything. So, instead of bothering my friends who may or may not care, why not start a blog (a la Dramabeans) and share my passion with people who might actually, y’know, care?\n\nAnd so with that, I created this blog. It’s new, but it’s not particularly shiny, and I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to continue this. Still, I’d like to think I won’t drop it immediately.\n\nThis post is long enough already, so I’ll simply end by saying welcome to my blog, and I hope you enjoy my ramblings."
