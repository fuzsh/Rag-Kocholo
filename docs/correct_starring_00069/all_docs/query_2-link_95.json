        "text": "In the first part of our interview with actress Tina Louise, we discussed men’s irrational fear of beautiful women, her work as a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science, her own biggest fear and how she deals with it and her serious accident last summer. Here in part two, Louise, who has worked with actors including Katharine Ross, Robert Ryan, Jack Lord and Vic Morrow, opens up about her favorite career moment, the necessity of volunteer work, her about-to-be-released film Tapestry, and more.\n\nJim Clash: As an actress, what are some of your best memories?\n\nTina Louise: Tina Louise: My favorite experience was my first film, God’s Little Acre, directed by Anthony Mann. I came from the stage and had never done a movie. It was months of going for auditions, my partner not showing up, sitting in the lobby of the Warwick Hotel for an hourbefore finding out that I actually had to call up [laughs]. The\n\nproducer read with me, which was fabulous because it was a scene with Ty Ty, the father. And, like the producer, he was much older. Later, I kept reading about all the well-known actresses in California that could have the part. But I got the screen test, and the role!\n\nJC: You won a Golden Globe for that movie at what, all of 25 years of age?\n\nTL: It was incredible. The movie ended up in the Venice Film Festival. I went abroad. There were all these people around taking care of me. I didn’t have to worry about anything. We sat in the theater, and I got bright red roses [laughs]. I'm saying, \"Why did you give me roses? You should give them to the writer, the director – somebody else.\"\n\nJC: If you could offer your younger self some advice now, what would it be?\n\nTL: Find something else to contribute to society besides loving what you do so much. To get involved [in your career] to the point it becomes so agonizing to lose something - somebody wanted you, somebody didn’t want you - we all need more in life. We need to contribute. That’s more balanced. I have lectured at the school around the corner from PS 59 – older kids, 16 and 17 - and told them that. I think people in the arts need to be told they should help make someone else’s life better. It’s not just children and teens that need help and mentoring. There are a lot of older people who can’t read.\n\nJC: What can you tell us about Tapestry, your movie expected to debut this spring?\n\nTL: The story is of a family that’s falling apart. My character is in the center. Stephen Baldwin plays my son. His character works in one of those high-pressure offices – a Glengarry, Glen Ross situation. He gets fired, becomes despondent. He’s got a family and little children. My job is to try to bring them all together. There is also an illness involved. I haven’t seen the final yet, so I don’t know what happens – we totally improvised the ending. But it was a great character part, and I loved it.\n\nJC: What’s next for Tina Louise?\n\nTL: That’s a good question. I turn down things I don’t want because I enjoy the birth of films. Plus I manage to keep pretty busy. I love being alive. I’m not in a hurry to do something else – I want to see this through. The way we are as actors is it’s like giving birth. I’m giving birth now. It comes out, and then you have to see. In life, it is the experience in everything, whether it works out the way you want or not. The experience of Tapestry has been incredibly good. I’m cool. Now I just need to have the baby [laughs].\n\nJC: Hopefully, it will be easier than the birth of your daughter Caprice.\n\nTL: I was 18 hours in labor! The doctor came by in the early morning and said, “You’ve got a long way to go.” She wasn’t born until 5:21 p.m. But it was a wonderful experience."
