        "text": "A while ago, for no good reason that I can fathom, I wrote an article about movies with the word Massacre in the title. It can be found here. Then, this New Year's episode of The After Movie Diner Podcast featured a discussion about movies with the word Academy in the title. While not as frequently used as Massacre, the word Academy in movie titles is still pretty prolific and just as interesting.\n\nWhereas you can tack Massacre on to just about any movie that features at least one kill in it, the Academy titled films, certainly the 80s ones, represent and conjure adolescent memories of zany madcappery and abundant nudity that were the backbone of any decent sex romp comedy from the late 70s and 80s. They were to the comedy genre what slashers were to the horror genre and while some may think that's a bad thing, I think it's a ringing endorsement!\n\nMost people would probably point to Police Academy as starting this trend but actually you have to go back to 1980, 4 years prior to Police Academy, for the Mad Magazine produced, Animal House rip-off, Up The Academy. It stars a young Ralph Macchio, Bond girl and Ringo Starr lover, Barbara Bach and is directed by Robert Downey Sr.\n\nThe wonderful thing about doing articles like this is looking deeper into a film like Up The Academy and finding out that lead actor, Ron Liebman had his name removed from the film and, likewise, so appalled with the final film, Mad publisher Bill Gaines wanted all of Mad Magazine's association with the film (including scenes of Alfred E. Newman - Mad's ginger, freckly, boy mascot) removed from it. He failed theatrically but managed it on early HBO screenings of the film by sending a $30,000 cheque to Warner Brothers!! (but the full film has since been re-instated on DVD post his death because, well, capitalism and screw him, he's dead)\n\nAll of this must've been especially MAD-ening for him as, after the success of Animal House, which had only tangential ties to National Lampoon's magazine, Mad Magazine simply wanted to add their name to Up The Academy to make some cash, they had next to nothing to do with the production beyond that. It was meant to be a money maker for them and it ended up being a bomb that they tried desperately to disown. The irony of all that is, it probably would've been forgotten had the story behind the film not been so delicious and kept it as a cult favourite for years. Just hearing how offensive and awful it must be to have such a storied history makes you want to check it out, right?\n\nThe true heyday of Academy movies may be dwindling, people have lost their sense of humour and even the Serbian made films Military Academy 1, 2 & 3 are all about the very serious lives and drama of people at some tedious military academy and not about a large breasted weapons instructor making dick jokes about heavy artillery, sadly.\n\nAcademies, these days, are just as likely to be attended by cutesy tween vampires or teen pop starlets as they are bikini models or strippers but even that shows the difference between the 80s/90s Academy boom and now. Back then even Mortuary Academies were assumed to probably have boobs in them. You didn't have to jump right to strippers or bikini models! Talk about overdoing it and misunderstanding that the judicious application of the word Academy already implies sex romp and doesn't require the blunt and unimaginative addition of bikinis or stripping.\n\nAnyhow, if you, like me, like a good, raucous, knockers filled comedy or if you just want to vicariously revisit your youthful institutions of learning, training or...erm... ninjas then below is our list in full.\n\nIf you know of any others then comment below and I'll add to the list!\n\nAlso let me know your favourites!!\n\nMilitary Academy (1940)\n\nNaval Academy (1941)\n\nUp the Academy (1980)\n\nMister Blot's Academy (1984)\n\nPolice Academy (1984)\n\nPolice Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985)\n\nCombat High (TV Movie) aka \"Combat Academy” (1986)\n\nPolice Academy 3: Back in Training (1986)\n\nPolice Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987)\n\nThe Princess Academy (1987)\n\nDance Academy (1988)\n\nMortuary Academy (1988)\n\nPolice Academy 5: Assignment: Miami Beach (1988)\n\nAll's Fair aka \"Academy war” (1989)\n\nVice Academy (1989)\n\nNinja Academy (1989)\n\nPolice Academy 6: City Under Siege (1989)\n\nVice Academy Part 2 (1990)\n\nDaddy and the Muscle Academy (1991)\n\nVice Academy Part 3 (1991)\n\nAcademy (TV Movie) (1992)\n\nReanimator Academy (Video) (1992)\n\nPolice Academy: Mission to Moscow (1994)\n\nVice Academy 4 (1995)\n\nWitch Academy (1995)\n\nVice Academy 5 (1996)\n\nSnowboard Academy (Video) (1996)\n\nSouth Beach Academy (1996)\n\nAcademy Boyz (1997)\n\nKickboxing Academy (1997)\n\nVice Academy Part 6 (1998)\n\nVoodoo Academy (Video) (2000)\n\nNot Another Teen Movie aka \"Sex Academy\" (2001)\n\nThe Academy (Video) (2003)\n\nWhitecoats aka \"Intern Academy” (2004)\n\nBlack Rose Academy (2004)\n\nDeath Academy (Video) (2005)\n\nStripper Academy (Video) (2007)\n\nMilitary Academy (2007)\n\nAcademy of Doom (2008)\n\nPlato's Academy (2009)\n\nThe Academy (2010)\n\nFire Academy (Video) (2011)\n\n2: Voodoo Academy (2012)\n\nMilitary Academy 2 (2013)\n\nBowes Academy (Short) (2013)\n\nVampire Academy (2014)\n\nCode Academy (Short) (2014)\n\nBikini Model Academy (Video) (2015)\n\nThe Academy (2015)\n\nThe Academy of Muses (2015)\n\nPolice Academy Alaturka (2015)\n\nAcademy (2016)\n\nMilitary Academy 3 (2016)\n\nTeen Star Academy (2016)\n\nDance Academy: The Movie (2017)\n\nBad Kids of Crestview Academy (2017)"
