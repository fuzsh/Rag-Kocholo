        "text": "Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost (2003)\n\nName: Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost\n\nStarring:Abhishek Bachchan & Lara Dutta\n\nDirector: Apoorva Lakhi\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nDid I watch this recently?Yes\n\nReview:\n\nBefore there was Dhoom, before there was Yuva, before there was Bunty aur Babli and before there was Guru – Abhishek Bachchan starred in Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost, a city boy returning to his rural town with a tv.\n\nMumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost story revolves around – not Abhishek, not Lara Dutta BUT the protagonist of this film is a TV. Don’t believe me! Read the below summary of the plot…\n\nWhen Kanji (Abhishek Bachchan) returns to his rural community (which only recently received electricity) he brings with him a TV and a satellite dish. The rest of the movie then track the impact this TV has on the lives of the villagers – from the barber, to the local Priest and to the Landowner of the village. Villagers start to mimic the characters and scenes of movies in their everyday lives (often to considerable failure). Most villagers are pleased about the arrival of the TV, which has brought entertainment and interest to their lives, with the exception of the local priest as the villagers are not coming to the temple to give money as they are pre-occupied by the TV.\n\nSo the Priest, offended that the TV is taking all his villager’s time and money, goes to the local Landowner of the village to help get rid of the TV and the problem. The Landowner at first refuses to help until he finds out that the TV in the village is in fact bigger then the Landowners. This then sparks off a violent campaign to take down Abhishek, his family and the TV.\n\nThere is also a side romantic plot whereby Abhishek falls in love at first sight with the landowner’s sister Kesar – played by Lara Dutta. Although not a very special romance, it does have considerably steamy scenes and there is definete chemistry between Abhishek & Lara in this movie. I woul love to see another movie (other then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom) properly explore their chemistry, because i think its one of the few interesting things about this film.\n\nThe movie’s plot is unintersting and at times rediculous. It does have its few scenes that can be quite funny – like the villagers trying to do actions and scenes from some classic movies to a disasterous effect. But this is repeated so often in the film that too soon gets boring. There is also i’m sure a message about the impact of progress in rural town, but there are so many other films out there that do a better and more interesting job at addressing this issue.\n\nSome more positive things to say about this film is Abhishek does a decent job as Kanji. He has certainly lost his wooden acting that plagued his earlier career by this stage, but unfortunately the screenplay makes you forget any great acting by Lara & Abhishek. Also on a more vapid note, Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost marks the beginning of the bearded/stubble Abhishek which has graced the screen for many years now and my personal Abhishek appearance favourite.\n\nAnother positive of this movie is the cinematography of Rajasthan. Watching the beautiful scenary of Rajasthan was certainly a strength of this film and viewers might feel the itch to visit Rajasthan after watching some of the scenes. Director Apoorva Lakhia (now known for his 2007 hit ‘Shootout at Lokhandwala’) both directed and wrote this film. I think of his as a decent director, but obviously he was the reason for the screenplay. He has obviously improved since then but his other movies Ek Ajnabee demonstrate he had room to improve before Shootout came along. Also some of his experience in the movie ‘Karma Sutra: A Tale of Love’ incorporated into the movie when he shows more shots of Lara’s cleavage then her face.\n\nOverall Score: 1.5/5 Hairy Anil Kapoors – Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost marked the improvement in acting for Abhishek Bachchan, but even he could not save this incredibly boring film whose main protagonist was a television. Lara Dutta & Abhishek’s chemistry is the main highlight of this film as well as the beautiful cinematography of Rajasthan. Other then these points though, the film is an all round boring dud.\n\nJanuary 14, 2008 at 4:40 pm\n\nOm Shanti Om (2007)\n\nName: Om Shanti Om\n\nStarring:Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Shreyas Talpade, Arjun Rampal & Kirron Kher\n\nSpecial Appearances By: Malaika Arora, Rishi Kapoor, Subhash Ghai, Karan Johar, Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta, Javed Sheik, Zayed Khan, Arbaaz Khan, Dino Morea, Ritesh Deshmukh, Aftab Shivdasani, Rekha, Shabana Azmi, Kajol, Priyanka Chopra, Shilpa Shetty, Lara Dutta, Vidya Balan, Tabu, Dharmendra, Amrita Arora, Juhi Chawla, Saif Ali Khan, Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Tusshar Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, Karisma Kapoor, Urmila Matondkar, Sunil Shetty, Govinda, Bobby Deol, Shahwar Ali, Uvika Chaudry, Akshay Kumar, Bindu & Satish Shah\n\nDirector: Farah Khan\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nDid I watch this recently? Yes\n\nSynopsis:\n\nTaken straight from the OSO website in an attempt not to spoil anything too much.\n\nHe (Om) was a junior artist in the 70’s. She (Shanti) was a superstar of the 70’s. He was her biggest fan. She was his biggest inspiration.\n\nHe was madly in love. She was ready to give up everything she had for love. He felt betrayed in life. She felt betrayed in love.\n\n… And then … started the saga of ‘Om Shanti Om‘.\n\nFor some love stories one lifetime is not enough…\n\nReview:\n\nOm Shanti Om is a bollywood film on bollywood. Layered with many delicious insider jokes for the avid bollywood watcher, Om Shanti Om makes hilarious fun at itself and the bollywood industry. It’s everything i personally love about Bollywood – multiple plot twists, emotional substance, great music, colour, scenes that make you totally involved in the film. Whether thats to whistle at the screen, laugh out loud, get up and dance or cry your heart out. Om Shanti Om is an involving tribute to the Masala genre. For any newbies ‘Masala’ is generally used to describe a mixture of all types of genres together in a movie – action, romance, drama, tragedy comedy etc. Masala genre was generally prevalent throughout the 1970s bollywood movies.\n\nWhat do i think about Deepika Padukone – model turned bollywood actress? As a fan of Aishwarya Rai its hard for me to admit this – but Aishwarya eat your heart out! Deepika Padukone does such a brillant job at the dramatic, comedic and normal scenes that she not only makes it look easy, but you would never guess it was her first acting job! Unfortunately she didn’t have much of a role in the second half but for the scenes she was on she showed her ability to do different genres of acting. Can’t wait to see more with her in it! I hope she only goes from strength to strength like the other debutants this Diwali. They all deserve to become stars.\n\nShahrukh had his bobbly head movements, tearing eyed acting – but i can think of no better actor to play this part. He really gets the comedy and charisma of his character. Plus when i saw him dance in ‘Dard-E-Disco’ topless, i didn’t even care the lyrics were nonsensical and badly translated – ‘pain of disco’. Although the firefighter outfit all oiled up I found he more like an oiled up chicken then hotty. Watching Om Shanti Om I remember why I used to love Shahrukh when i see him in such fun movies like this – when he doesn’t take himself too seriously and has a comedic element to his character (Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Chalte Chalte, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai etc). Another favourite of the film was Kirron Kher – playing the over the top mother role with the realistic normal mother moments i can’t think of any other Older Bollywood Actress who could pull off both. She has great comic timing!\n\nThere have been a lot of comparisons between Saawariya & Om Shanti Om but i think its unfair to compare the two. Om Shanti Om will definetly be the commercial favourite because it caters to the wants of the masses. It makes people feel good and they enjoy their movie experience. Saawariya is not generally a movie for the masses due to its slow pace, elite technicalities and due to the type of story it is. Its not all wam, bam action and comedy – its more thinking then feeling from my own experience with both. I could be wrong – i have a hard time putting into words the issues with Saawariya.\n\nThree main cautions for anyone about to see this film – chances are you won’t get all the jokes (because most of them are ‘insider’ jokes about the industry). If your an outsider/newbie to Bollywood the thing to remember is they are making fun of Bollywood so when you see over the top acting and silly scenes just remember that its on purpose. So sit back and just laugh at it. You won’t get the joke on all levels but you can probably get the generally gyst. If you do happen to pick up on what they mean with certain jokes and lines then you will be laughing your head off like I was in bits.\n\nSecond flaw that potentially could ruin people’s experiences of the film is that the plot makes absolutely no sense and lacks logic. There will be scenes when your head will say ‘what the hell! how can that happen’ or ‘I so don’t get how that even works’. But if you can suspend your belief and brain for 2.5 hours and just accept that this is a very unrealistic movie than it won’t bother you so much i’m sure. Especially if you have seen alot of 1970s films from Bollywood a lot of the plot twists or storylines will not be new to you.\n\nThird is that the second half drags and is not nearly as fun as first half. There are scenes that i enjoyed in second half but it does lose its momentum.\n\nOk so my favourite scenes (without being too spoilery) – when 70s Shahrukh is fighting and doing the actions scenes for his movie involving the fight with the tiger and bad fight Choreography. I was killing myself laughing. Second favourite scene was the Filmfare Award scene, in particular Abhishek in Dhoom 5 clip. Third favourite scene was watching ‘Deewangi Deewangi’ song with all my favourite actors coming on (old and new) with people from my cinema whistling and cheering at their favourite actors.\n\nOverall Score: 4.5/5 – My brain is telling me to give it 4/5 because it was such a silly entertainment movie it doesn’t deserve to get near 5 stars, but my heart is telling me I had such a fun time going to see it that it deserves to get 4.5 for being the most enjoyable film all year. Without a doubt has severe flaws, but if you don’t let them bug you and if you can realise they are always making fun of themselves you should have a positive viewing experience. Also if you a relative newbie to bollywood, might have to wait a while before you can understand the large referential comedy of Om Shanti Om.\n\nDon’t get all the references to Bollywood? See an attached post for some of the found insider jokes, their explanations and order of appearances of Bollywood stars for Deewangi Deewangi song.\n\nhttp://thebollyblog.com/2007/11/17/om-shanti-om-filmi-references/\n\nNovember 17, 2007 at 6:26 pm"
