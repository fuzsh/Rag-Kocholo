        "text": "First of all, there is a site within the Stack Exchange network which still accepts such questions:\n\nScience Fiction & Fantasy requires the work to contain distinct science fiction, fantasy, or other speculative fiction content. You can consult their meta for guidelines on how to ask a good story-ID question.\n\nThen there are also some other Q&A sites working similar to SE where you can just provide a description and ask for a movie:\n\nI Remember This Movie...\n\nNameThatMovie?\n\nFilmfind\n\nReddit's /r/tipofmytongue (be sure to read the rules sidebar first!)\n\nWhat is my movie?\n\nCriticker.com has a Help me name that movie forum\n\nIf you are working from different information than a verbal description, there's also other less Q&A oriented ways to find your movie/TV-show:\n\nGoogle image search lets you search directly for matches to a given image, for when you have a visual representation of either a scene from the film or an actor whose name you'd like to know.\n\nSo does TinEye\n\nQuoDB might be useful if you only have a specific quote or part of the dialogue you remember.\n\nIMDb's Advanced Search lets you combine a variety of types of information from IMDb catalogs to create extremely specific searches. You can fill in (with the information you have) as many optional fields as you can to narrow the search results.\n\nIf you are looking to identify movies or TV shows with a Speculative Fiction theme (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror, Superhero Fiction, Alternate History, Utopian and Dystopian Fiction, Supernatural Fiction, and the like), you may want to ask your question on our sister site Science Fiction & Fantasy SE, which allows identification questions for Speculative Fiction works. Please make sure to read their identification guidelines before posting. You can also browse the list of questions there tagged [story-identification] and [movie] or [story-identification] and [tv] for some examples of how to format your question and what kind of information to provide.\n\nRelevant Science Fiction & Fantasy SE meta posts:\n\nWould non-horror Speculative Fiction be on-topic for this site?\n\nAre works that aren't SF per se, but have occasional SFnal elements on-topic? (e.g. spy movies)\n\nDoes \"Fantasy\" include the supernatural? What about horror?\n\nAre questions about alternate history on or off topic?\n\nAre comic superheroes considered sci-fi?"
