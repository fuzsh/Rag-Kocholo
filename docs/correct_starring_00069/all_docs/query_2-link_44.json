        "text": "From the moment that director Robert Altman discovered her for 1970’s Brewster McCloud, Shelley Duvall was a singular presence in film and television. Her wide eyes implied a total lack of guile, something many of her characters used to their advantage; her nervy energy made her captivating in both comedy and horror projects. There was no one else like her on screen, then or now, which makes her passing at the age of 75 all the more sad.\n\nDuvall’s filmography feels like it could have been much longer, as the actress took an extended break from the public eye starting in 2002. But the projects she left behind include some iconic performances, that most importantly could never have come from any other actor.\n\n— Liz Shannon Miller\n\nSenior Entertainment Editor\n\nL.A. Joan, Nashville (1975)\n\nDuvall brought such life to the role of “L.A. Joan” (née Martha), a young woman who seems to drift between names as well as men. Coming to the titular town for a family health crisis, she instead gets swept up in the chaos of Robert Altman’s ensemble comedy, with less interest in visiting her sick aunt and more in discovering everything the music and social scene of Nashville has to offer. With such a massive cast, it’s remarkable how many standout performances and characters endure, and Duvall’s work was one of the highlights. — L.S. Miller\n\nRelated Video\n\nWhere to Stream: Available on VOD\n\nMildred “Millie” Lammoreaux, 3 Women (1977)\n\nAnyone who has seen this 1977 film wouldn’t be surprised to learn that it was developed directly from a dream writer-director Robert Altman had — but thankfully, such eerie, odd settings are a place where Shelley thrived. Here, she starred as Millie opposite Sissy Spacek and Janice Rule in a story that feels set outside the rules of reality. Against the backdrop of a tiny California desert town, the titular three women circle each other’s lives until they become inexorably intertwined. As Millie, Duvall is self-absorbed but remains compelling throughout the twisty story, rarely ceasing her monologuing long enough to take a breath. It was a demanding role, but one Duvall inhabited incredibly well. — Mary Siroky\n\nWhere to Stream: Available on VOD\n\nPam, Annie Hall (1977)\n\nShelley Duvall graced the ’70s rom-com Annie Hall as Pam, a Rolling Stone reporter that briefly dates Woody Allen’s Alvy. She’s not in much of the film, but she does bring Allen’s idiosyncratic dialogue to life in her scenes with him — hearing her say “transplendant” multiple times as they’re about to see Bob Dylan and celebrity yogi The Maharishi is genuinely hilarious. Then, in bed with Alvy, she describes sex with him as a “Kafka-esque experience,” cigarette stylishly held, her iconic gaze fixated directly at the bumbling man next to her. Duvall was certainly adept at comedy, and her small part in Annie Hall is undoubtedly a bright spot in the film. — Paolo Ragusa\n\nWhere to Stream: Hoopla, Tubi, MGM+, Pluto TV\n\nWendy Torrance, The Shining (1980)\n\nThere’s something poignantly tragic that Duvall’s best and most iconic role is also infamously her most trying. Her portrayal of the tormented Wendy Torrance, wife of Jack Nicholson’s equally famed character, is filled with intense fear as well as heart. It’s her sweetness and vulnerability in the first half that makes her sheer terror at Jack’s descent into madness all the more unsettlingly visceral.\n\nThe lamentable backstory of how she reached those emotional peaks, however, is the unfortunate mirror Duvall’s character puts up to her performance. Director Stanley Kubrick put Duvall through a grueling process on set, reportedly doing 127 takes for the iconic stairway scene, at the great emotional expense of the actor. “I will never give that much again,” Duvall said of shooting the film in a 1981 People interview. “If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me.” Still, she is quoted as having had immense pride in the final product and her role in it, all of which she undoubtedly earned thrice over. — Ben Kaye\n\nWhere to Stream: AMC+, Shudder\n\nOlive Oyl, Popeye (1980)\n\nRobert Altman’s adaptation of the long-running comic strip doesn’t hold up that well in modern times; as good as Robin Williams is as the titular character, the film is an awkward slog at points. However, between her height, her voice, and her whole vibe, casting Duvall as Olive Oyl in the 1970s was as iconic a casting choice as Patrick Stewart taking on the role of Professor X in X-Men. And her commitment to the sailor man’s high-strung love interest was like none other. — L.S. Miller\n\nWhere to Stream: Hoopla, Kanopy, Pluto TV\n\nHonorable Mention: Faerie Tale Theatre (1982–1987)\n\nMaybe one of the most impactful projects of Duvall’s career wasn’t in film, but in television: As the creator and host of the Showtime series Faerie Tale Theatre (also acting in seven episodes), Duvall brought young audiences star-studded recreations of classic fairy tales directed by major filmmakers. Duvall opened every episode by saying “Hello, I’m Shelley Duvall,” a supercut of which went viral in the early YouTube era. That supercut now lives on her personal YouTube channel, as seen above — and it’s magic. — L.S. Miller"
