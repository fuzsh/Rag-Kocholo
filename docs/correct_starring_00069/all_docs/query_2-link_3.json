        "text": "Lindsay Lohan’s absence from movies for over a decade has been notable. But her return in 2022 in the Netflix movie ‘Falling for Christmas’, which saw the actress playing a hotel heiress with amnesia, has fans excited about her future.\n\nBefore her Netflix return, Lohan had starred in a number of big roles, becoming a 2000s icon, starring in films that perfectly captured the era and what it was all about. Here are some of her most iconic roles.\n\nThe Parent Trap (1998)\n\nAt just 12 years old, Lohan took on her first major role in ‘The Parent Trap’ in 1998. She played twin sisters Hallie Parker and Annie James, who discover they are long-lost twin sisters, when their parents divorced after they were born.\n\nFor the role, Lohan won Best Performance in a Feature Film at the Young Artist Awards in 1999.\n\nFreaky Friday (2003)\n\nWhen Lohan was 17, she starred in ‘Freaky Friday’ playing Anna Coleman, opposite Jamie Lee Curtis, who played her mom, Tess Coleman, in the movie.\n\nThe movie follows the bizarre events when mother and daughter switch bodies, with the actresses playing the opposite role throughout the movie. The film also featured the first instance of Lohan singing on a movie soundtrack, singing the song ‘Ultimate’.\n\nIn 2004, Lohan won an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance, and two Teen Choice Awards, one for Choice Breakout Movie Star, and another for Choice Hissy Fit.\n\nConfessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004)\n\n‘Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen’ found Lohan playing a teenager with dreams of becoming a Broadway star. Lohan sang the movie’s lead song ‘Drama Queen (That Girl)” as well as a number of other songs on the soundtrack.\n\nMean Girls (2004)\n\nIn one of Lohan’s most well-known works, her role as Cady Heron in ‘Mean Girls’ has gone down in history as a teen movie classic about the drama caused by school cliques and gossip."
