Episode 33 of the Khandaan podcast brings you one of our favorite movies, 2007’s Om Shanti Om. Directed by Farah Khan, this Shahrukh Khan-starrer was also Deepika Padukone’s debut film. Co-starring (Chowkidar) Kirron Kher as Maa, Shreyas Talpade as Friend, and all of Bollywood as backup, OSO is an homage to Hindi film. It should surprise nobody that co-hosts Asim, Amrita, and Sujoy love this film.
