Please give us the complete sentence, with some context, so we have a specific situation to discuss.

There are hundreds of sites where you can ask the name of a particular movie if you don't remember the name .

In my opinion, Title of a movie means the name of a movie. It's an official language.

What is the working title of the movie. But I don't think a layman like me will use this word.

Wait for the natives to reply.

Let's say, I am looking at the movie's poster. Is that what I see there the name of a movie or the title of a movie?

Actually, I thought that it's a set phrase and it doesn't depend on the context.

That's obviously is the TITLE for me. Wait for the valuable inputs from the native speakers.

These are interchangeable. I agree that "title" is the proper word, and we probably should say "title" but we're just as likely to say "Hey, what was the name of that movie?" We do the same with books.

I went to a few movie review sites. Surprisingly they never use the word "title" or "name" within any of the sites.

They have lists to check.

Reviews, Great Movies; Now Playing.

When you click one of the movies the review comes up and it lists:

Cast, Director, Studio, Writer, Cinematographer, Release Date.

But no where does "title" or "name" appear.

And thinking back a conversation might play out like this (again with no "name" or "title":

Do you want to see a movie tonight?

What's playing?

The Foreigner.

Who's in it?

Jackie Chan.

Sounds great; when is it playing?

It is because the name or the title is at top of the page in block letters. Even if it is not there , how would you get the list without typing the name.

I was jut pointing out that the "title" or "name" is rarely used in reference to a movie.

What is the name of the movie you saw last night. (sounds stilted)

What is the title of the movie you saw last night. (also sounds stilted)

What movie did you see last night? (sounds colloquial; not stilted)

Hi Packard, what about this context for example? Does it sound unnatural to say title or name? If so, how would you rephrase it?

There was this movie I loved when I was a teenager, I saw it in Hungarian. I'd love to watch it again. Just wondering what the title/name could be in English, because sometimes it's not translated literally.
