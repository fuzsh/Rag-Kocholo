        "text": "The NBA will crown a different champion for the sixth straight season as the Conference Finals matchups were set on Sunday (19 May) following a pair of thrilling Game 7s.\n\nIn the day's early action, the Indiana Pacers shot a record-breaking 67.1% from the field to beat the New York Knicks 130-109 and advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they will now face the Boston Celtics.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the Minnesota Timberwolves erased a 20-point deficit to beat the reigning champion Denver Nuggets 98-90 and secure their first Western Conference Finals berth since 2004. The Timberwolves will play the Dallas Mavericks for the chance to advance to the NBA Finals, scheduled to begin on 6 June.\n\nBelow you'll find the top details for the Conference Finals, including a guide on all the Olympians to follow throughout the series!\n\nFIBA World Cup 2023: Unexpected stars, who has secured an Olympic quota & teams to look out for ahead of Paris 2024\n\nOlympic basketball: Complete list of winners and medallists\n\nUSA Basketball announce men's national team roster for Paris 2024\n\nEastern Conference Finals: Boston Celtics vs Indiana Pacers\n\nThe Boston Celtics reached their sixth Eastern Conference Finals in the last eight years after dispatching the Miami Heat in five games in the first round, followed by a 4-1 series win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the semi-finals.\n\nThe Celtics were the league's best team in the regular season (64-18) and came into the playoffs as the No.1 seed in the East; they'll have home-court advantage against the Pacers and a potential Finals opponent, should they advance.\n\nWith the series scheduled to start on Wednesday (22 May), the Celtics will have had almost a full week to rest and prepare for the Conference Finals. The Pacers, on the other hand, wrapped up their series with the Knicks on Sunday, and have played 13 games compared to Boston's 10 this postseason.\n\nFor Indiana, their Eastern Conference Finals berth is the first since 2014, which is all the more impressive when you consider the Pacers entered the postseason as the 6 seed in the East. The Pacers were the second-best offensive team in the league this season at 120.5 points per game; the problem they have to navigate is that the Celtics were ranked No.1 (122.2).\n\nAdditionally, Boston had the second-highest defensive rating of any team (110.6 compared to Indiana at 117.6) and won the regular season series with Indiana 3-2. The Celtics outscored Indiana by an average of 129.0 to 116.8 points per game – the Pacers’ biggest deficit (-12.2) against any opponent.\n\nOlympians & Stars to watch\n\nJrue Holiday and Jayson Tatum of the Celtics both played at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 in 2021, helping the USA win gold against France in the final. They were also named to the USA men's national team roster for the Olympic Games Paris 2024 back in April.\n\nThough he was unable to compete at the FIBA World Cup last year, Kristaps Porzingis has represented his native Latvia on several occasions and should be considered a strong favourite to make his Olympic debut in Paris if Latvia progress from the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in July.\n\nThough not an Olympian, Jaylen Brown is a key member of this Celtics team; the 27-year-old is averaging 23.1 points and 6.6 rebounds in the playoffs this year.\n\nMen's Olympic Basketball Tournament: Paris 2024 draw results\n\nFor Indiana to have a chance at causing an upset they will have to rely on big performances from their own 'Big 3' of Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, and Myles Turner.\n\nHaliburton is a two-time All-Star who led the NBA in assists this season with 752. For his play in the 2023-24 campaign (which included leading the Pacers to the In-Season Tournament Final), the 6 ft 5 (1.96m) point guard was named to the USA roster for Paris 2024. Haliburton also played at the 2023 FIBA World Cup, leading the USA in steals and assists.\n\nSiakam was traded to the Pacers from Toronto in January, where he won a championship with the Raptors in 2019. The 203cm (6 ft 8) Cameroonian has a bevvy of accolades to his name (including two All-Star selections, All-NBA Second and Third Team nominations, and the 2019 Most Improved Player Award), and is averaging 21.1 points and 7.5 rebounds per game in the playoffs.\n\nTurner has spent his entire 10-year career with the Pacers after being selected with the 11th overall pick in the 2015 draft. The two-time NBA blocks leader is averaging 17.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game this postseason.\n\nWestern Conference Finals: Minnesota Timberwolves vs Dallas Mavericks\n\nMinnesota's comeback over Nikola Jokic and the reigning champion Denver Nuggets on Sunday was one for the ages; their 20-point comeback was the biggest in Game 7 history in the play-by-play era (1997-98), according to the NBA.\n\nThe seven-game series proved a far tougher test for the Timberwolves than their first round contest against the Phoenix Suns (a 4-0 sweep for Minnesota), but their reward is a trip to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2004.\n\nThe Mavericks were also able to erase a big defecit in Game 6 of their second round series against the No.1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder, rallying from 17 points down in the second half for a 117-116 win and a 4-2 series triumph.\n\nThe Timberwolves finished 3-1 against Dallas during the 2023-24 regular season, but the Mavericks were without either Luka Doncic or Kyrie Irving for three of those games.\n\nOlympians & Stars to watch\n\nThe face of this Minnesota Timberwolves team is undoubtedly Anthony Edwards.\n\nThe 22-year-old has ascended to superstardom this season, reaching his second All-Star team after averaging 25.9 points per game. \"Ant-Man\" was the leading scorer for the USA at the FIBA World Cup, averaging 18.9 points per game. Edwards was named to the USA 2024 Olympic team earlier this year.\n\nRudy Gobert won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year award this season after anchoring a Wolves defense that ranked first in defensive rating and points allowed per game in the regular season. The Tokyo 2020 silver medallist was named to France's preliminary team on 16 May.\n\nFrance Basketball announce preliminary national team rosters for Paris 2024\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns is a four-time NBA All-Star and the No.2 offensive option on the Wolves next to Edwards. The 7-footer (2.13m player) averaged 21.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game this season, and represented the Dominican Republic at the FIBA World Cup, averaging 24.4 points and 8 rebounds per game."
