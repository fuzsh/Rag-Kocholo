        "text": "Bullets swept by Warriors.\n\nWhat you remember: The Bullets had won 60 games that year, and had knocked off Buffalo and Boston—the vaunted Celtics had won 60 games that year, too. The Warriors were the top seed in the West, but had been picked fourth in the Pacific Division and even with their surprise success, had won only 48 games. There was little evidence that any Western Conference team could keep up with the best in the East, especially the Warriors, whose home building was unavailable during the Finals, and their home games were moved to the Cow Palace outside San Francisco. But Rick Barry was dominant for the Warriors, averaging 29.5 points against the Bullets to outdo Washington stars Phil Chenier and Elvin Hayes and lead the sweep.\n\nMORE: 10 devastating NBA playoff injuries that crushed championship dreams\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The Bullets were supposed to have their very own Barry-stopper: Mike Riordan, a tough wing who could be as feisty as Barry was. In three games against Riordan that season, Barry—who averaged 30.6 points — had scored just 16.3 points, including an eight-point performance in one of the games. Another aspect of this series that is often overlooked: K.C. Jones was coaching the Bullets, and Alvin Attles the Warriors, making it the first championship series in any major American sport with two black head coaches.\n\nLakers blow 3-1 lead over the Suns.\n\nWhat you remember: The Suns were still in seven-seconds-or-less mode, and had won 54 games that year, despite losing Amare Stoudemire to a knee injury. But the Lakers—a No. 7 seed — were able to push Phoenix to the brink of elimination thanks in large part to a last-second layup to send Game 4 into overtime, then another last-second shot to win the game, 99-98, in overtime. It was the first time that Phil Jackson had lost a first-round series, though, in his defense, his starters around Bryant and Lamar Odom included Kwame Brown and Smush Parker.\n\nNBA MOCK DRAFT: Who comes after Ingram and Simmons?\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The move that turned the series might have been the insertion of James Jones into the starting five for the Suns. Jones gave Phoenix another shooter on the floor, and the Suns’ offense, held under 100 points for three straight games for the first time in four months, opened up from there, averaging 120.3 points. Jones averaged 9.7 points and shot 5-for-9 from the 3-point line in the final three games, while Tim Thomas excelled on moving to the bench.\n\nSuns (again) can’t close out Rockets.\n\nWhat you remember: Who can forget the Mario Elie “Kiss of Death” shot that put Houston up, 113-110, in Game 7 of the series, effectively closing out Phoenix? What was worse for the Suns was that this series typified what they’d become in the wake of their 1993 NBA Finals appearance against the Bulls—a gang of good regular-season players who ultimately and consistently flopped in the playoffs. They’d lost to the Rockets the previous year after being up, 2-0, and had a chance to win this series with a 3-1 lead. But an overtime loss in Game 5—in which Charles Barkley scored three second-half points and missed two free throws with 17.9 seconds remaining in regulation—turned the tide and propelled the sixth-seeded Rockets to a championship.\n\nMORE: Must-see NBA playoff photos\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The A.C. Green guarantee. Holding the 3-1 lead, Green, a veteran Suns forward, was asked whether the Suns could possibly lose three straight. “It won’t happen,” he said. Asked if that was to be taken as a guarantee, Green said , “Take it however you want.” The Rockets certainly took it as a guarantee, and their anger helped fuel the comeback. Also fueling the comeback was the trash talk of Barkley, who had 18 points on 7-for-16 shooting with seven turnovers in the final game. Barkley had been needling Houston’s Chucky Brown all series. “Early in the series,” Brown said, “Charles told me I was too small for him, so I told him his behind was too fat.”\n\nThunder blow 3-1 lead, lose to Warriors in seven.\n\nWhat you remember: The argument could be made that it is difficult to choke against the defending champs, especially a team like the Warriors, who have a demonstrably deeper roster than the Thunder. But even with that caveat, the way the Thunder flamed out in the West finals has to be considered an all-time great flop job. It's not just that OKC had a 3-1 series lead against the Warriors, it's that in both Games 6 and 7, the Thunder held 13-point leads that they just could not protect in the face of a flurry of Golden State 3-pointers. As star forward Kevin Durant said, \"They beat us at the 3-point line. We beat them everywhere else.\"\n\nMORE: Conspiracy theorists will happily say this was rigged\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The Warriors were such popular NBA championship picks that they continued to be favored to win the title even while down 2-1 early in the series. Stephen Curry was coming off a knee injury that caused him to miss six total games in the Warriors' first two rounds.\n\nLakers ‘superteam’ loses to Pistons.\n\nWhat you remember: The Lakers were heavily favored in the series, giving one more run for the Kobe Bryant-Shaquille O’Neal-Phil Jackson trio with the ballyhooed addition of Gary Payton and Karl Malone before the season. But the Pistons had acquired Rasheed Wallace at the trade deadline and turned into a defensive monster, allowing just 78.2 points per game on 38.8 percent shooting in their final 24 games. They stymied Kobe Bryant (38.1 percent shooting in the Finals) and held the Lakers to 81.8 points, winning in five games.\n\nMORE: 9 potential candidates for the Lakers coaching job\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The Pistons’ victory not only aided the legacy of the Celtics at the time—keeping the Lakers from their 16th championship, which would have tied Boston’s total—but was aided by Celtics president Danny Ainge. At the trading deadline, the Pistons were desperately trying to find ways to add Wallace from Atlanta, to which he’d been traded 10 days earlier. The Celtics stepped in to facilitate the trade by taking on Chucky Atkins’ salary.\n\nLakers lose Game 7 vs. Celtics.\n\nWhat you remember: The Lakers led the series, 2-0, then led again, 3-2, before going to a Game 7 in Los Angeles. This was to be the last stand of the old-guard Celtics, with Bill Russell and Sam Jones heading into retirement, and Boston was certainly not expected to reach the Finals — they’d been fourth in the East with 48 wins, the last team in the conference playoff pool. But the Celtics surprised both the Sixers and Knicks to reach the Finals against the rival Lakers, who had won 55 games and were favored to win the championship. Though Boston was able to respond to the Lakers’ early challenges, few thought the Celtics could actually finish the job in Game 7. But Boston built a third-quarter lead and held off a late Lakers rally to win, 108-106.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: This was all about bad karma. After Game 7, the Boston Globe’s Leigh Montville reported that, in the Lakers’ locker room, “there were five cases of unopened champagne. There were eight unopened bags of balloons at the top of the Forum ceiling, and an unsliced victory cake in the Lakers press room.” As legend has it, the Celtics took notice of the balloons in the Forum rafters, waiting to be dropped in celebration. Lakers star Jerry West was none too happy about the presumptuous balloons, and his fear that it the premature celebration might tick off the Celtics was confirmed when Russell said to him during pregame warmups, “Those f-— balloons are staying up there.”\n\nSpurs blow Game 6 against Heat.\n\nWhat you remember: The Spurs held a 12-point lead with a minute to go in the third quarter, but coughed up the lead in the fourth quarter. They reversed that in the late stages, though, building a 94-89 lead with 28 seconds to play. As the clock ran down — and as hapless Heat fans filed out of the building — the Spurs led by three in regulation when Chris Bosh grabbed an offensive rebounds and found Ray Allen open in the corner. Allen knocked down the 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds to play, setting up Heat overtime win.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: It’s certain the Gregg Popovich has not forgotten this, but his decision to remove Tim Duncan from the game — twice — late in the fourth quarter might have cost the Spurs the championship. Because the desperate Heat were playing with five 3-point shooters, Popovich pulled Duncan defensively in favor of Boris Diaw with 28 seconds to play. On that possession, Heat guard Mike Miller grabbed an offensive rebound off a LeBron James miss, giving James another shot at a 3, which he made. And Allen’s shot, as clutch as it was, probably would not have happened if Duncan had been on the floor to secure a rebound off the James miss that preceded it with 10 seconds to go.\n\nMagic lose 3-1 lead to Pistons.\n\nWhat you remember: When Orlando got ahead after Game 4 of the series, Magic star Tracy McGrady — who had not, and never would, advanced beyond the postseason’s first round — famously said, “It feels good to get in the second round.” But the Pistons roared back, particularly by using long-limbed rookie Tayshaun Prince to guard McGrady. Detroit won the final three games of the series in blowouts.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: McGrady’s unfortunate quote sticks out from this series, but it’s easy to forget just how much he had to do in those games. McGrady averaged 31.7 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists against the Pistons, and got virtually no help from his teammates. Drew Godden averaged 14.0 points and 12.7 rebounds, but he was the only McGrady teammate to break double figures in scoring in the series. The other three members of the Magic’s primary starting five: Jacque Vaughn, Gordan Giricek and Andrew DeClerq.\n\nBlazers blow 16-point lead in Game 7.\n\nWhat you remember: The Lakers were on the ropes, having already blown a 3-1 series lead to even open the way for a Game 7. They trailed, 75-60, with 10:28 to play, and Lakers coach Phil Jackson would say, “I never … had a team that I thought had run out of gas as much as I thought they had in the third quarter.” But the Lakers got some spark together in the fourth quarter, going on a 15-0 run to tie the game, and taking an 85-79 lead on a memorable alley-oop pass from Kobe Bryant to Shaquille O’Neal that nearly blew the roof off the Staples Center.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: Portland actually led by 16 late in the third quarter, but a funny thing happened—Lakers guard Brian Shaw threw a wild shot at the rim to close the period, and it wound up banking off the backboard and in for a 3-pointer. That cut the lead to 13, but gave the Lakers a bit of life. After the game, Lakers forward Glen Rice told reporters, “Any time you can have a guy throw something like that and it goes in off the glass, you've got to realize that things are about to turn around for you.” Turn around, indeed.\n\nClippers blow 3-1 lead to the Rockets.\n\nWhat you remember: After a gut-check first-round series win over the Spurs, the Clippers had everything going, and seemed destined for the conference final showdown against the rival Warriors. They had a 3-1 lead over the Rockets, lost Game 5, then built a 19-point lead in the second half on their home floor in Game 6. But they shot 4-for-22 in a disastrous fourth quarter in which they were outscored, 40-15. After that heartbreak, the Clippers showed little fight in Game 7, and trailed by 20 early in the fourth quarter on their way to a 13-point loss.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The Rockets gave up virtually nothing for the two guys who wound up crushing the Clippers’ dreams of upsetting the Warriors. Houston had traded for Corey Brewer from the Timberwolves in December 2014, and he averaged 11.9 points in 56 games with Houston. The Rockets also picked up Josh Smith in December, after he’d been waived by the Pistons. In that critical fourth quarter of Game 6, Brewer and Smith combined to score 29 points on 9-for-13 shooting, making more than twice the shots the Clippers made in the quarter as a team.\n\nSixers blow 3-1 lead to Celtics.\n\nWhat you remember: The Celtics and Sixers had each won 62 games, and met in the Eastern Conference finals for the right to face the Rockets, who figured to be overmatched by either foe. In a series in which five of the seven games were decided by two or fewer points, it may seem harsh to say that the Sixers choked. But in what should have been a Game 5 clincher, the Sixers were outscored, 8-0, in the final 1:51 to set up the 111-109 loss. Then, the Sixers blew a 17-point lead in Game 6. Finally, in Game 7, Philly scored one point in the final 5:23, turning an 89-82 advantage into a 91-90 loss.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The turning point came in the third quarter of Game 6 in Philadelphia, with the Sixers holding a lead when a fan hurled an item from the Spectrum stands at Boston forward Cedric Maxwell, which infuriated Maxwell and caused a minor brawl. The Celtics were rejuvenated after that and came back for the win. A locked-in Maxwell guarded Julius Erving (23 points) and forced him into six turnovers in the finale. After the game, coach Bill Fitch said that if, earlier, he had suggested Maxwell would guard Erving in a postseason Game 7, two things would have happened: “One, Maxwell might have asked to be traded. The other is that somebody might suggest that I be shot.”\n\nTop-seeded Sonics lose to Nuggets.\n\nWhat you remember: The first-round series featured a 63-win Sonics team going against the 42-win Nuggets in what was expected to be a cakewalk, especially after Seattle took the first two games of the series by a combined 34 points. But led largely by the gutsy defensive performance of Dikembe Mutombo, who averaged 7.3 blocks and 14.7 rebounds in the last three games of the series, the Nuggets came back to win three straight games and become the first No. 8 seed to knock off a No. 1 seed. Mutombo grabbed the final rebound in Game 5 and fell joyfully to the floor, one of the NBA postseason’s most lasting images.\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: The Nuggets, after shocking the Sonics, nearly did the same to the Jazz in the conference semifinals. There, Utah leapt to a 3-0 series lead, the worn-down Nuggets unable to repeat the defensive effort they’d shown against Seattle — Utah averaged 105 points in the first three games. But Denver won three straight, including a Game 5 in double-overtime, to become the first team since 1951 to force a Game 7 after falling behind 3-0 in an NBA playoff series.\n\nNo. 1 Mavericks lose to eighth-seeded Warriors.\n\nWhat you remember: In the history of the NBA, 12 teams have won 67 games, and eight of those have won NBA championships. One was eliminated in the conference finals (1973 Celtics) and two others are playing now (2016 Spurs and Warriors). Only one failed to make it out of the first round, and it was the 2007 Mavericks. The Warriors were the eighth seed in the West, and had gone 16-5 to close the year, but after a heartbreaking Finals loss in 2006, the Mavs collapsed against the Warriors.\n\nMORE: Every team's biggest draft regret\n\nWhat you might have forgotten: If you think Warriors fans were ticked-off at TNT mouth Charles Barkley last year, when Barkley claimed a jump-shooting team like Golden State could not win a title, you should have seen the Barkley-bashing of '07. Barkley openly donned a Dirk Nowitzki jersey, called the Warriors, “little midgets,” said that after a Game 2 loss Golden State would not win another game and punctuated it by insulted the entire Bay Area with the quote, “Thank God they got that bridge to get the hell out of town. … The Bay Area sucks.”"
