        "text": "C Jack Sikma- Illinois Wesleyan\n\nUnlike many players on this list, Sikma was on many D1 radars coming out of high school. However, he signed with Wesleyan’s NAIA team to get immediate playing time. In his freshman year, coach Dennie Bridges helped him perfect the “Sikma move”, a reverse pivot face-up shot. In his career there from 1973-1977, Sikma averaged 21.2 points and 13.1 rebounds. “The Witchert Wonder” was picked up at #8 in the 1977 NBA Draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. He became a 7-time All Star and NBA Champion with the team. Over a 14 year career with the Sonics and Milwaukee Bucks, he averaged 15.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, and .9 blocks per game. Sikma was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019 and has his #43 retired by the OKC Thunder/Seattle Supersonics.\n\nPG Terry Porter- UW- Stevens Point\n\nPorter attended the University of Wisconsin, Stevens Point for 4 years. While there, Porter averaged 13.5 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 3.8 assists. He was the only NAIA player to be given a tryout with the USA Basketball Olympic team and made it into the top 20 roster before being cut. Porter was drafted 24th by the Trail Blazers in 1985. He went on to have a 17 year career highlighted by two All Star appearances . Porter created a formidable backcourt with Hall of Famer Clyde Drexler and the two went to the Finals in 1990 and 1992. For his career, Terry Porter averaged 12.2 points, 3 rebounds, and 5.6 assists. Porter’s number 30 was retired by the Trail Blazers.\n\nSF Duncan Robinson- Williams College\n\nDuncan Robinson committed to Division III Williams College in 2012 with only one scholarship offer from DII Merrimack College. He immediately made an impact on the team, as they went 28-5 as Robinson led the team in nearly every major statistical category. In his one year at Williams, he averaged 17.1 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. His groundbreaking season attracted the attention of many D1 teams, including the University of Michigan. U of M initially only wanted Robinson as a walk-on, but coach John Beilein eventually decided to offer the 6 foot 7 sharpshooter a scholarship. He became the first player in history to transition from Division 3 to Division 1 basketball on a full scholarship. In his time at Michigan, he appeared in a Final Four Championship and won two Big Ten Tournaments. Robinson’s averages of 9.3 points and 2.5 rebounds on 45.5% shooting were not enough to get him drafted in 2018. However, he was picked up by the Miami Heat and eventually earned a starting spot in 2019. Robinson drained two hundred and forty three 3-pointers in 65 games. He tied the Heat 3 point record with 10 in a game and broke the Heat record for 3 pointers in a season. He made valuable contributions to a Heat team that surprised the league with a 41-24 record. Robinson also participated in the 2020 NBA 3 Point Contest – most importantly he is a steadfast Blitzer\n\nPG Anfernee Simons- IMG Academy\n\nSimons came out of Edgewater High School in Orlando in 2017. He had averages of 23.8 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 4.2 assists in his senior year. Simons took a postgraduate year at the famed IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. While there, his stock skyrocketed and he became the 8th best player in the 2018 recruiting class. He ultimately decided on turning pro and skipped college entirely. Simons was selected 24th to the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2018 NBA Draft. Simons spent most of the 2018-2019 season in the G League, but dropped 37 points, 6 rebounds, and 9 assists in the final game of the year. In the 2019-2020 season, Simons has averaged 8.8 points and 1.5 assists in 65 games.\n\nPG Josh Magette- UA-Huntsville\n\nMagette attended the University of Alabama-Huntsville where he averaged 12.7 points and 8.9 assists as a senior in 2011-12. He holds the school and conference record in assists. Magette also contributed to 3 Gulf South Conference championships and helped the team to two Elite Eight spots in the DII National Championship. Magette went undrafted in 2012 and bounced around overseas and in the G-League. He made his NBA debut and scored his first points against the Dallas Mavericks on October 18th, 2017. In 18 games that season, Magette averaged 2.6 points and 3.2 assists. Magette signed a two-way contract in 2019 with the Orlando Magic and appeared in 8 games with averages of 1.5 points and .6 assists per game. He is currently with the Lakeland Magic, the team’s G-League affiliate."
