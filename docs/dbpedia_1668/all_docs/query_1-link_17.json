        "text": "10 NBA players who have played the most games without ever making the playoffs\n\nAll basketball players dream of hoisting the Larry O'Brien NBA Championship Trophy—an honor only attainable by conquering the league's arduous playoff path. For the 450 athletes who wear an NBA jersey each season, the chance of winning a title begins with the playoffs.\n\nThe NBA, established in 1946, has seen roughly 58% of all its players make the playoffs at least once in their career. The Sacramento Kings—a franchise that ended its 16-year playoff drought this 2022-23 season—has seen an abundance of its players not get that opportunity.\n\nJustWatch ranked the 10 NBA players who have played the most regular-season games without ever making the playoffs, using data compiled by Basketball-Reference.com.\n\nHalf of those players in the top 10 of this list played for the Kings, including when the team was located in Kansas City, Missouri; Cincinnati; and Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nThe NBA has only seen three of its 30 franchises not represented in the top 10: the Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks, and San Antonio Spurs. At least one of the 10 players spent a part of their career with the remaining 27 teams.\n\n#10. Geoff Huston\n\nGames played: 496\n\nYears active: 1979-87 (8 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 8.8\n\nRebounds per game: 1.4\n\nAssists per game: 5.1\n\nTeams played on: New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nGeoff Huston, drafted in the third round of the 1979 NBA draft by the New York Knicks, played 12,252 minutes during his NBA career without ever making the playoffs. The point guard was traded in 1981 from the Mavericks to the Cavaliers for Chad Kinch and a 1985 first-round selection despite leading Dallas in scoring and assists.\n\nHuston's inability to make an appearance in the NBA playoffs is partially due to those two teams and the trade. The Mavericks finished as the worst team in the NBA for the 1980-81 season with a 15-67 record. Huston's 1981-82 Cavaliers team was also the worst in the NBA at 15-67.\n\n#9. Doug Overton\n\nGames played: 499\n\nYears active: 1992-2004 (11 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 4.5\n\nRebounds per game: 1.3\n\nAssists per game: 2.1\n\nTeams played on: Washington Bullets, Denver Nuggets, Philadelphia 76ers, Orlando Magic, New Jersey Nets, Boston Celtics, Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThe point guard from Philadelphia had a unique journey to the NBA. He spent his first few seasons as a professional basketball player with the Rockford Lightning of the Continental Basketball Association and the Illawarra Hawks of Australia's National Basketball League.\n\nDoug Overton—one of two players in the top 10 of this list to have played for eight different teams—scored 2,253 points in his career and came close to an NBA playoff appearance during the 1998-99 season with the Philadelphia 76ers. Overton signed a 10-day contract with the team, but his deal culminated at the end of the regular season.\n\nHe also came close to the playoffs during the 2000-01 season with the Boston Celtics, who finished fifth in the Atlantic Division with a 36-46 record.\n\n#8. Eddy Curry\n\nGames played: 527\n\nYears active: 2001-13 (11 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 12.9\n\nRebounds per game: 5.2\n\nAssists per game: 0.5\n\nTeams played on: Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks\n\nEddy Curry, who made the transition to the NBA straight from high school, was selected with the #4 overall pick in 2001 by the Chicago Bulls—the highest draft pick in the top 10 of this list.\n\nThe 7-foot center scored a career-high 43 points in 2007 against the Bucks. In 2011, Curry was part of the three-team blockbuster trade that sent him to the Minnesota Timberwolves and saw the Knicks acquire Carmelo Anthony.\n\nThe following season, Curry became an NBA champion with the Miami Heat. He played in 14 regular-season games with the Heat during the 2011-12 season but was only active for one game during the team's 23-game playoff run. Curry did not log any minutes in that game.\n\n#7. Popeye Jones\n\nGames played: 535\n\nYears active: 1993-2004 (11 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 7.0\n\nRebounds per game: 7.4\n\nAssists per game: 1.3\n\nTeams played on: Dallas Mavericks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, Washington Wizards, Golden State Warriors\n\nMurray State product Popeye Jones was drafted in the second round of the 1992 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets but played one season of professional basketball in Europe for Italian franchise Aresium Milano before making his NBA debut in 1993 after his rights were traded to the Mavericks.\n\nJones had some of the best years of his career during his four seasons in Dallas, where he holds the team's single-game rebound record at 28.\n\nThe Mavericks failed to reach the playoffs during Jones' first three seasons with the team, including a 13-69 record in 1994. Jones was also part of the 2002-03 Mavericks team that finished 60-22 and went to the playoffs, but the power forward wasn't part of the team's playoff run despite 26 regular-season appearances.\n\n#6. Buddy Hield\n\nGames played: 548\n\nYears active: 2016-present (7 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 16.1\n\nRebounds per game: 4.4\n\nAssists per game: 2.6\n\nTeams played on: New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings, Indiana Pacers\n\nBuddy Hield—the only active NBA player on this top 10 list—has had individual success despite not having the opportunity to play in the playoffs. The Bahamian athlete has been at the center of several trades, which have prevented him from playing for contending teams.\n\nIn 2017, the former Oklahoma Sooner was traded by the New Orleans Pelicans to the Sacramento Kings, where he spent six seasons before being traded to Indiana in 2022. On Feb. 15, Hield made Pacers history against the Bulls, surpassing Reggie Miller for the most three-pointers made in a season at 230. Hield is also the second-fastest player to reach 1,500 career three-pointers in NBA history, behind the Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry.\n\nJosh Hart, who currently plays for the New Orleans Pelicans, is the next closest active NBA player without a playoff appearance with 371 games played.\n\n#5. Sebastian Telfair\n\nGames played: 564\n\nYears active: 2004-15 (10 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 7.4\n\nRebounds per game: 1.6\n\nAssists per game: 3.5\n\nTeams played on: Portland Trail Blazers, Boston Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nSebastian Telfair—one of two players in the top 10 of this list to have played for eight different teams—was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the #13 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft. The point guard was drafted from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThe cousin of former NBA player Stephon Marbury, Telfair had a tumultuous career marred by a series of trades and issues off the court. Telfair, who was part of six trades throughout his career, also had brief stints with several teams in the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nIn August 2019, the former Mr. Basketball USA was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison for illegal gun possession following a traffic stop in New York two years prior.\n\n#4. Omri Casspi\n\nGames played: 588\n\nYears active: 2009-19 (10 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 7.9\n\nRebounds per game: 4.0\n\nAssists per game: 1.1\n\nTeams played on: Sacramento Kings, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, New Orleans Pelicans, Minnesota Timberwolves, Golden State Warriors, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nPower forward Omri Casspi began his professional career with the EuroLeague's Maccabi Tel Aviv before being drafted in 2009 with the #23 overall pick by the Kings, making him the first Israeli player to be drafted in the first round.\n\nIn 2015, Casspi scored a career-high 36 points against the Warriors, a team he would play for two years later. The Golden State Warriors would be crowned NBA champions in 2018 after the team waived a then-injured Casspi right before their playoff run.\n\nThe Warriors would later honor Casspi with a championship ring for his contributions to the team that season. In 2021, Casspi retired from basketball after returning to Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n\n#3. Nate Williams\n\nGames played: 642\n\nYears active: 1971-79 (8 seasons)\n\nPoints per game: 12.0\n\nRebounds per game: 3.8\n\nAssists per game: 1.5\n\nTeams played on: Cincinnati Royals, Kansas City-Omaha Kings, New Orleans Jazz, Golden State Warriors\n\nNate Williams—the swingman who finished his career with 7,709 career points—is another player on this list who played for the Kings. The 6-foot-5 athlete played for the franchise during its tenure in Cincinnati; Kansas City, Missouri; and Omaha, Nebraska. Williams, a well-rounded player, proved productive, scoring a career-high 41 points for the Jazz against the Denver Nuggets in 1977.\n\nThe former Utah State Aggie was also durable during his career. Williams was the NBA league leader in games played for the 1973-74 and 1974-75 seasons.\n\nWilliams played 82 games for the Kings during the 1973-74 campaign and 85 games in 1974-75—his last season with the franchise."
