        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks aren't done just yet.\n\nOn the brink of being swept in the 2024 NBA Finals, the Mavs showed in Game 4 that they weren't ready for their season to be over.\n\nLuka Doncic and Co. extended the series with a 122-84 rout of the Boston Celtics at the American Airlines Center in Dallas on Friday. Dallas' 38-point victory marked the third-largest blowout in NBA Finals history.\n\nThe Mavs have now trimmed their series deficit to 3-1 as the series shifts back to Boston for Game 5 on Monday night. So, could that Game 4 blowout be the start of a historic series comeback?\n\nHere's a look at how teams have fared in the NBA playoffs after going down 3-0 in a series:\n\nHow many NBA teams have come back from being down 3-0 in the playoffs?\n\nAn NBA team has never come back from a 3-0 deficit to win the series in the playoffs. Teams that opened a 3-0 series lead in an NBA postseason series have gone 156-0.\n\nLocal\n\nThe latest news from around North Texas.\n\nThe Celtics nearly became the first NBA team to pull off the historic comeback just last season. After losing the first three games of the Eastern Conference Finals to the Miami Heat, Boston won the next three games before losing Game 7 at home.\n\nOnly one team has come back from a 3-1 series deficit in the NBA Finals to win the championship: the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers, who won three straight games to stun the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAs for other professional sports, the only Major League Baseball team to win a series after trailing 3-0 was the 2004 Boston Red Sox. Four National Hockey League teams have managed to do so: the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders, 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings.\n\nHow many teams have forced Game 6 after being down 3-0 in the NBA playoffs?\n\nOf the 156 teams to face a 3-0 series deficit in the NBA playoffs, only 15 managed to force a Game 6.\n\nHow many teams have forced Game 7 after being down 3-0 in the NBA playoffs?\n\nOnly four teams that went down 3-0 in an NBA playoff series forced a decisive Game 7:"
