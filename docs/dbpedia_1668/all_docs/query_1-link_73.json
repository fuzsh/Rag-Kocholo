        "text": "Chris Elise/Getty Images\n\n11. Golden State Warriors: JR Smith\n\nJR Smith never met a shot he didn't like, and his spacey decision-making sometimes cost his team dearly, but he made enough shots during a high-scoring career to earn a lottery spot.\n\nPrimarily a heat-check reserve until he joined the Cavaliers in 2014-15, Smith shot 37.3 percent from deep for his career and averaged double figures in 11 different seasons. His 1,929 career treys are easily the 2004 class' highest total, and let's also remember Smith had serious bounce in his younger days.\n\nThis reverse, wrong-footed finish on a tough lob illustrates the kind of \"get into the air and figure the rest out later\" athleticism that defined Smith's early career.\n\n12. Seattle SuperSonics: Tony Allen\n\nSmith's polar opposite, Tony Allen was among his era's greatest perimeter defenders. He earned six All-Defensive nods in his 14-year career (three first-team and three second-team) and was basically the first guy you'd pick to lock down an elite scoring guard or wing for the better part of a decade.\n\nUnfortunately, Allen was a complete offensive zero. He shot 28.2 percent from long range and could be schemed into irrelevance in playoff series. Down 2-1 in the 2015 Western Conference Semifinals, the Golden State Warriors had 7'0\" center Andrew Bogut \"guard\" Allen in Game 4. Bogut basically ignored his matchup and roved, knowing Allen couldn't beat the scheme by shooting threes.\n\nThough flawed on offense, Allen was an absolute terror on the other end. That's good enough to come off the board at No. 12.\n\n13. Portland Trail Blazers: Ben Gordon\n\nA brilliant shooter who would have been a much bigger star had he come into the league 10 years later than he did, Ben Gordon is this class' most accurate marksman from deep. At 40.1 percent, he's 12th all-time in three-point percentage among players who attempted at least 2,900 career triples.\n\nYou might think he and Kevin Martin should rank closer together, but Gordon was a dreadful finisher inside who rarely got to the rim and couldn't touch Martin as a foul-drawer. At 6'3\", Gordon was also a non-impact defender who often seemed disinterested in doing anything on that end of the floor.\n\nStill, Gordon could score, and he proved that with historic immediacy. He's the only rookie ever to win Sixth Man of the Year.\n\n14. Utah Jazz: Shaun Livingston\n\nIt's easy to get caught up thinking about what Livingston—a 6'7\" point guard with supreme length, terrific instincts and an indefensible close-range pull-up jumper—could have been if not for a devastating knee injury in 2007. But what he became in spite of that misfortune might be more impressive.\n\nEssentially out of the league for three full years, Livingston then bounced around for nearly a half-decade before reviving his career with the Brooklyn Nets in 2013-14, averaging 8.3 points and playing 76 games. He then signed with the Warriors and played a critical role on a team that reached five straight Finals.\n\nLivingston's career stats—6.3 points, 3.0 assists and 2.4 rebounds—don't leap off the page. But he was a vital locker room leader for a three-time champ, could guard four positions and contributed critical second-unit buckets with a devastating backdown game against smaller guards.\n\nScott Cunningham/Getty Images\n\n15. Boston Celtics: Dorell Wright\n\nFun trivia: When Dorell Wright led the NBA with 194 made treys in 2010-11, he also set the Golden State Warriors' single-season record for three-pointers. Better shooters have since come along to smash that mark, but it's still impressive that Wright held a franchise record (albeit briefly).\n\nA 6'9\" wing who jumped to the NBA straight from high school, Wright unsurprisingly needed a few seasons to get his bearings as a professional. Once established, he carved out a role as a three-and-D small forward who couldn't be left alone in the corners. In the best of his 11 seasons, Wright averaged 16.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.5 steals for the 2010-11 Warriors.\n\n16. Utah Jazz: Anderson Varejao\n\nInjuries prevented Varejao from delivering on his full promise as a high-energy center, limiting him to an average of 48 games per season. But when healthy, he was a force, as his All-Defensive honor in 2009-10 illustrates.\n\nThough it's tough to trust in such small samples, Varejao also averaged 10.8 points and 11.5 rebounds in the 25 games he logged in 2011-12, followed by 14.1 points and 14.4 rebounds in another 25-game season in 2012-13.\n\nSeveral per-minute metrics love his contributions. For example, he ranks second in his class (behind Howard) with .148 win shares per 48 minutes. Availability matters, though, which is why Varejao can't go any higher than the middle of the round.\n\n17. Atlanta Hawks: Beno Udrih\n\nUdrih spent the majority of his 831 career games as a reserve who could run the offense, hit threes with just enough consistency (34.9 percent) to keep defenses honest and, most importantly of all, nail pull-up jumpers in transition.\n\nIt was kind of his thing, which makes sense considering Udrih shot 50.0 percent from 10-16 feet for his career.\n\n18. New Orleans Hornets: Delonte West\n\nWest's best seasons came early in his career with the Celtics, where he got the majority of his time as a starting combo guard. He shot 38.5 percent from three in 2005-06 and averaged 12.2 points and 4.4 assists the following year.\n\nThe slick lefty had one last stellar season as a starter with the Cavs in 2008-09, shooting 39.9 percent from deep and averaging 11.7 points for a squad that reached the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHe's the only player in this class to average at least 3.0 assists and shoot over 37.0 percent from three for his career.\n\n19. Miami Heat: Kris Humphries\n\nIt's worth remembering Kris Humphries was a useful power forward for 13 seasons, even if he may now be better known for his brief marriage to Kim Kardashian.\n\nHe did his best work with the New Jersey Nets, averaging 10.0 points and 10.4 rebounds in 2010-11 and following up with 13.8 points and 11.0 rebounds in 2011-12. Those were his only seasons with double-digit scoring or rebounding averages, but they weren't out of step with his per-minute marks for most of his career: 13.5 points and 10.9 boards per 36 minutes.\n\nHumphries even dabbled with the three ball as he aged, shooting 35.2 percent from distance during his final NBA season in 2016-17.\n\n20. Denver Nuggets: Andris Biedrins\n\nAndris Biedrins caught a case of the yips from the foul line in his sixth NBA season, and that changed everything about the promising center's career. The left-handed big man from Latvia was one of only 12 players to average at least 10 points and 10 rebounds in the three-season span from 2006-07 to 2008-09, and he led the league in field-goal percentage in 2007-08 at 62.6 percent.\n\nQuick off the floor, capable of catching tough passes on the roll and skilled enough to punish defenders who didn't crowd him on the perimeter, Biedrins was on track to be a quality two-way center for a decade. But his foul shooting made him hesitant on offense starting in 2009 and quickly rendered him unplayable thereafter. In his final five seasons, his best free-throw percentage was 32.3 percent in 2020-11.\n\nScott Cunningham/Getty Images\n\n21. Utah Jazz: Josh Childress\n\nChildress joined Josh Smith to form an intriguing rookie tandem with the real-life Hawks, scoring 10.1 points and averaging 6.0 rebounds while starting 44 games in his first season. Funky shooting form rendered Childress a wildly inconsistent outside shooter (23.2 percent from deep as a rookie, 49.2 percent as a sophomore and 33.8 percent in his third year), but his length and athleticism made him an efficient scorer at closer range.\n\n22. New Jersey Nets: Chris Duhon\n\nDuhon might not have made this list if it wasn't for Mike D'Antoni. The innovative head coach put the ball in Duhon's hands and turned him loose in 2008-09, producing the point guard's best season. In 36.8 minutes per game that year, Duhon averaged 11.2 points and 7.2 assists with a 56.9 true shooting percentage, all of which were comfortably career highs.\n\nIn nine seasons split between the Bulls, Knicks, Magic and Lakers, Duhon totaled 2,690 assists and only 925 turnovers. Among picks who played significant minutes, he has the best assist-to-turnover ratio in the class.\n\n23. Portland Trail Blazers: Sasha Vujacic\n\nA 6'7\" guard from Slovenia best remembered as a bench fixture on a pair of Lakers title teams, Vujacic never started more than 25 games in a season. Though it wasn't his highest-scoring year, 2007-08 was Vujacic's best. He averaged 8.8 points in 72 games off the pine, hitting 43.7 percent of his threes. The Lakers didn't win a championship that season (they'd get the next two in order), but Vujacic sustained his performance into the postseason, putting up 8.1 points per contest and knocking down 39.2 percent of his shots from deep.\n\nThough he scored only 3,094 points across 10 seasons, Vujacic gets credit for producing on a winner. He's also quietly sixth in this class in career three-point percentage among players who logged at least one season in the league.\n\n24. Boston Celtics:Damien Wilkins\n\nLet's hear it for Wilkins, the first undrafted player to crack our new order.\n\nWilkins worked his way into a gig with the Sonics as a rookie, then played all but six games for the team over the next three seasons, topping out with averages of 9.2 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 2007-08. A 6'6\" small forward who didn't quite have his uncle Dominique's lift, Wilkins had a 41-point game in that standout 2007-08 season and played as recently as 2017-18 after a five-year stint overseas and in the D League.\n\nDon't make the mistake of thinking Wilkins traded on his recognizable name. He scrapped for every second of his 10-year career.\n\n25. Boston Celtics: Sebastian Telfair\n\nA nationally renowned high school prospect, Telfair was one of precious few point guards to make the preps-to-pros jump (joining Livingston in this class).\n\nUndersized at just 6'0\" and understandably lacking experience, Telfair struggled to survive early on despite getting ample opportunity to play. He started at least 26 games in each of his first five seasons.\n\nBall-handling and decent vision couldn't compensate for an unreliable shot (31.9 percent from deep) and mostly ineffectual defense, which is why Telfair never stuck with any one team for more than two years in a row. Traded six times, Telfair still managed to do enough to keep winding up on a roster in his 10 seasons.\n\nThis far down the order, that staying power is a noteworthy achievement.\n\n26. Sacramento Kings: Royal Ivey\n\nIvey is our last player off the board whose career lasted at least a decade. Ideally, you'd like more than 3.3 points and 40.6 percent shooting from the field at this spot, but everyone left unpicked either fizzled out quickly or made even less of an impact than the guard out of Texas.\n\nHe scored a career-best19 points in a Jan. 29, 2008 loss to the Nets.\n\n27. Los Angeles Lakers: Kirk Snyder\n\nSnyder had an NBA frame in college, and he might have wound up going 16th overall in the actual draft because of his role in a surprising NCAA tournament run. His Nevada Wolf Pack beat No. 7 Michigan State and No. 2 Gonzaga, advancing to the 2004 Sweet 16, and Snyder had plenty to do with it. He scored 19 points to beat the Spartans and had 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists against the Bulldogs.\n\nThe 6'6\", 225-pounder showed flashes of promise as a pro (he scored a career-high 28 points with the 2005-06 New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets), but he ultimately played only 211 games and was out of the league at age 24.\n\n28. San Antonio Spurs: David Harrison\n\nHarrison's block rate of 5.2 percent is the highest in the 2004 class among players who logged at least 2,000 career minutes. That's a small sample, but it's all we have from a center who hung around for only four seasons with the Pacers.\n\nSome trivia: Harrison was involved but not suspended for his role in the infamous Malice at the Palace brawl less than a month into his rookie year.\n\n29. Indiana Pacers: Robert Swift\n\nSwift's career is best viewed as a cautionary tale, as the 7'0\" teenager entered the NBA completely unprepared for the money and lifestyle that came with being a lottery pick out of high school. With that said, nobody left unselected played more than his four seasons (five if you count 2006-07, which he lost entirely to injury). It's also remarkable that a player at such an obvious strength and experience disadvantage averaged 6.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in his second year.\n\nThere was always potential in Swift's developing frame. Early immaturity and subsequent injury never gave him a chance to develop it.\n\nAll statistics via Basketball Reference unless otherwise noted."
