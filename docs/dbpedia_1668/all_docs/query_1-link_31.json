        "text": "Current and former L.A. Times staff members selected the 75 greatest Lakers players as the club celebrates its diamond jubilee.\n\nPlayers were judged on how they performed for the Lakers, with a minimum of 100 games played with the franchise.\n\nThose casting ballots were former columnists J.A. Adande and Mark Heisler, former staff writer Steve Springer, current staff writers Broderick Turner and Dan Woike, and assistant sports editor Dan Loumena.\n\nPoints awarded for each vote were 75 points for No. 1 descending to one point for No. 75. There were 47 unanimous selections, each among the top 49.\n\nAdrian Dantley at No. 43 and Luke Walton at No. 45 ranked highest of the 10 players who made five ballots. Eleven players were on four ballots, three on three ballots and two made the team with only a pair of votes: Trevor Ariza and Lou Williams.\n\n1. Magic Johnson (448 points)\n\nThe director of the Showtime era drew five first-place votes among the six panelists. The 6-foot-9 point guard was the conductor of no-look passes who averaged 19.5 points, 11.2 assists and 7.2 rebounds while shooting 52.3% from the field and 84.9% from the free-throw line in 13 seasons, winning five NBA titles. Known for his showmanship, the 12-time All-Star and 10-time All-NBA player was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n2. Kobe Bryant (445)\n\nThe other first-place vote went to this five-time NBA champion as a youngster skied above the rim and a veteran featured a well-rounded game. The 6-6 shooting guard averaged 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds and 4.7 assists while shooting 44.7% from the field and 83.7% from the line in 20 seasons. The 18-time All-Star was selected All-NBA 15 times and earned All-Defensive team honors 12 times. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2020.\n\n3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (438)\n\nThe NBA’s all-time leading scorer spent 14 seasons with the Lakers, also winning five NBA championships. The 7-2 center famous for the unstoppable sky hook, averaged 22.1 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.5 blocked shots for L.A.

Jerry West (432)\n\nThe Logo helped lead the Lakers to nine NBA Finals, winning one in the record-setting 1971-72 season, when the team won a record 33 games in a row. The 6-3 shooting guard was an All-Star in each of his 14 seasons with the Lakers as he averaged 27.0 points, 6.7 assists and 5.8 rebounds while shooting 47.4% from the field and 81.4% from the line. He was selected All-NBA 12 times and All-Defensive five. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1980.\n\n5. Elgin Baylor (423)\n\nOne of the NBA’s first high fliers, this 6-5 forward averaged 27.4 points, 13.5 rebounds and 4.3 assists in 14 seasons, the first two in Minneapolis and the last two appearing in only 11 games because of injuries. He shot 43.1% from the field and 78% from the line while helping the Lakers to eight NBA Finals. The 11-time All-Star was selected All-NBA 10 times. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1977.\n\n6. Shaquille O’Neal (422)\n\nThe most dominant big man of his era, he helped lead the Lakers to four NBA Finals appearances in five years, winning three in a row (2000-02). In eight seasons with the club, the 7-1 center averaged 27 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.5 blocked shots per game while shooting 57.6% from the field. A seven-time All-Star and eight-time All-NBA player with the franchise, he was All-Defensive three times. He was inducted into Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\n7. (tie) LeBron James (407)\n\nLikely to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer this season, he led the Lakers to a title in the second of his four seasons in L.A. The 6-8 forward’s averages with the club match that of his younger days: 27 points, 8 rebounds, 8.2 assists and 1.2 steals. He has been selected an All-Star and All-NBA player in each of his seasons with the Lakers as he’s played nearly every position from the point to small-ball center.\n\n7. (tie) George Mikan (407)\n\nThe NBA’s first dominant center at 6-foot-10, he led the Minneapolis Lakers to five NBA titles, including three in a row (1952-54). He became so dominant that rules were changed to limit his impact. In seven seasons, the four-time All-Star was a six-time All-NBA player, averaging 23.1 points, 13.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists (blocked shots were not recorded then). He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1959.\n\n9. James Worthy (405)\n\nEarning the nickname “Big Game James” for his stellar play in big moments, the 6-9 forward averaged 17.6 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3 assists and 1.1 steals during his 12 seasons, all with the Lakers. The seven-time All-Star won three NBA titles and was selected All-NBA twice while shooting 52.1% from the field and 76.9% from the line. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\n10. Wilt Chamberlain (402)\n\nDuring his five seasons with the Lakers, the 7-1 center averaged 17.7 points, an astounding 19.2 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 2.2 steals while shooting 60.5% from the field. He helped them win their first title in Los Angeles, where he was a four-time All-Star while twice making the All-Defensive team and an All-NBA squad. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\n11. Gail Goodrich (382)\n\nOvershadowed as a young player by Baylor and West, this 6-1 point guard was an elite scorer who led the Lakers in scoring for four consecutive seasons, including their championship season of 1971-72. In nine seasons in L.A., he averaged 19.0 points, 4.2 assists and 3.0 rebounds plus 1.5 steals once it became a statistic starting in 1973-74, when he was All-NBA. The five-time All-Star was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1996.\n\n12. Pau Gasol (379)\n\nThis future Hall of Famer helped return the Lakers to championship form with three NBA Finals appearances and titles in 2009 and 2010. In parts of seven season with L.A., he eclipsed his 18-year career averages with 17.7 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.5 assists while shooting 52.2% from the field and 78% from the line. The 7-foot forward/center was a three-time All-Star and All-NBA player with the Lakers.\n\n13. Vern Mikkelsen (372)\n\nThe 6-7 power forward teamed with Mikan to form a one-two punch in the frontcourt that led to four NBA titles. In 10 seasons with Minneapolis, he averaged 14.4 points, 9.4 rebounds and 2.2 assists. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n14.

In 11 seasons with L.A., including his first 10 when the team won three NBA titles, he averaged 15.1 points, 3 rebounds and 2.8 assists while shooting 49.0% from the field, including 37.3% from deep, and 83.3% from the line.\n\n14. (tie) Jamaal Wilkes (364)\n\nThis four-time NBA champion, including three with the early Showtime Lakers, was a 6-6 forward with a silky jumper who scored 37 points in the 1980 title-clinching win, when Magic Johnson had 42 points and played all five positions. In eight seasons in L.A., Wilkes averaged 18.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists while shooting 51.6% from the field and 75.4% from the line.\n\n16. Michael Cooper (347)\n\nThe rail-thin 6-5 guard played primarily off the bench during the Showtime era, helping L.A. win five championships. During his 12-year career, all with the Lakers, he was All-Defensive eight times while averaging 8.9 points, 4.2 assists and 3.2 rebounds. At the height of his career, he played in 82 games for five consecutive seasons.\n\n17. Slater Martin (334)\n\nThe 5-10 point guard played the first seven seasons of his 11-year career with the Lakers, winning four of his five championships with Minneapolis.

Anthony Davis (332)\n\nIn the first of his three seasons with the Lakers, the 6-10 big man helped deliver an NBA title alongside LeBron James. While struggling with injury issues the last two seasons, he’s still averaged 24.1 points, 9.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.1 blocked shots while making the All-Star team each season in L.A.\n\n19. Norm Nixon (330)\n\nThis 6-2 point guard played his first six NBA seasons with the Lakers, winning a pair of titles at the start of the Showtime era. A two-time All-Star, including in 1982 with the Lakers, he averaged 16.4 points, 7.9 assists and 1.8 steals in L.A. before he was traded to the Clippers.\n\n20. (tie) Derek Fisher (328)\n\nThe 6-1 point guard didn’t get a flashy nickname, but his steady play and several clutch performances helped the Lakers win five titles. In parts of 13 seasons with the Lakers, he averaged 11.2 points, 4.2 assists and 1.5 steals while shooting 37.7% from three-point range and 79.9% at the line.\n\n20. (tie) A.C.

The four-time All-Star — once with the Lakers when he was All-NBA in 1956 — was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\n22. (tie) Jim Pollard (325)\n\nThe 6-4 forward completed a frontcourt alongside George Mikan and Vern Mikkelson that was the best in the NBA. Pollard played on five title-winning teams while averaging 13.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.2 assists. The four-time All-Star and All-NBA player, nicknamed “Kangaroo Kid” because he could dunk from the free-throw line, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\n24. Happy Hairston (319)\n\nA 6-7 forward known for his rebounding prowess, he started for the 1971-72 Lakers that won 33 in a row and claimed L.A.’s first title. He joined the Lakers in 1969 and played parts of six seasons in L.A., averaging 15.2 points and 12.4 rebounds while shooting 48.2% from the field and 78.5% from the line.\n\n25.

In his six-plus seasons in L.A. following a trade from Phoenix in 1997, he averaged 6.3 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.2 assists while shooting 42.1% from the field, including 32.5% from three-point range.\n\n28. Rudy LaRusso (280)\n\nThe 6-7 power forward joined Elgin Baylor in the Minneapolis frontcourt in 1959 to form a dynamic duo, making three All-Star teams while helping the Lakers reach the NBA Finals three times. A five-time All-Star who made an All-Defensive team with the San Francisco Warriors, he averaged 14.1 points and 9.6 rebounds in eight seasons with the Lakers.\n\n29. Vlade Divac (279)\n\nOne of the early great Europeans, the 7-1 center from Serbia played the first seven seasons and the last of his 16-year career with the Lakers.

He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\n30.

His 57.4% shooting percentage in the playoffs ranks seventh.\n\n31. Jim McMillian (253)\n\nAlthough he only played three seasons of his nine-year NBA career with the Lakers, he replaced Elgin Baylor in the starting lineup during his second season. The 6-5 forward averaged 15.3 points and 5.4 rebounds with L.A., winning the NBA title in 1972, when the team had a record 33-game winning streak. After Wilt Chamberlain retired, he was traded to Buffalo for center Elmore Smith.\n\n32. Eddie Jones (244)\n\nThis 6-6 shooting guard made the All-Rookie team to start his Lakers career, which lasted until his fifth season, when he was traded to Charlotte in 1999, the year he made his second All-Defensive team. The three-time All-Star, including twice with L.A., averaged 15.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.1 steals for the Lakers.\n\n33. Rick Fox (242)\n\nAfter six seasons in Boston, this 6-7 forward fit into whatever role the Lakers needed for the last seven seasons of his NBA career, from starter to reserve, while helping the team make the NBA Finals four times in five years and winning three titles (2000-02).

In his seventh and final season with L.A., he was an All-Star and All-NBA selection. He averaged 11.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocked shots a game while shooting 56.6% from the field for the Lakers.\n\n35. Mychal Thompson (229)\n\nAfter several solid seasons in Portland after an All-Rookie start, the 6-10 forward/center was acquired from San Antonio in a pivotal trade that helped the Lakers secure their final two Showtime-era titles (1987-88) over the aging Boston Celtics and Detroit “Bad Boy” Pistons. In five seasons in L.A., primarily anchoring the second unit, he averaged 8.9 points and 5.4 rebounds while shooting 51.4% from the field.\n\n36. Metta Sandiford-Artest (221)\n\nKnown as Metta World Peace after changing his name from Ron Artest, he joined the Lakers at age 30 and played six of his last seven NBA seasons in L.A. The 6-7 forward was a one-time All-Star and All-NBA selection before becoming a Laker and an early version of a 3-and-D player, averaging 8.9 points and 3.6 rebounds while shooting 33.5% from three-point range in L.A. He was an All-Defensive selection four times.\n\n37. Nick Van Exel (209)\n\nThis 6-1, score-first point guard played five seasons of his 13-year career with the Lakers, leaving as the team’s all-time leader in three-pointers made (later surpassed by Kobe Bryant). After an All-Rookie start, he was an All-Star in 1998, his final season in L.A.

Sam Perkins (197)\n\nAfter a strong start to his career during seven seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, he rejoined North Carolina teammate James Worthy as a starter in the Lakers frontcourt for two-plus seasons before he was traded to Seattle in 1992. The smooth-shooting 6-9 forward/center averaged 14.6 points and 8.0 rebounds while knocking down 46.8% of his shots from the field and 82.1% of his free throws.\n\n39. Cedric Ceballos (186)\n\nThis high-scoring, 6-6 forward played four seasons with Phoenix before the Lakers acquired him via trade in 1994.

He averaged 10.4 points, 5.8 rebounds and 1.7 blocked shots while shooting 46.7% from the field for the Lakers.\n\n41. Dick Barnett (166)\n\nThis 6-4 shooting guard spent only three of his 14 NBA seasons with the Lakers but made an impact with his “fall back” left-handed jumper and quick wit. In the early 1960s, he averaged 16.8 points while shooting 44.8% from the field and 79.5% from the free-throw line. He went on to win two titles with New York, helping the Knicks defeat L.A. in the 1970 Finals.\n\n42. Kyle Kuzma (164)\n\nOnce the future of a rebuilding franchise, the lanky 6-9 forward averaged double digits in scoring in each of his four seasons in L.A. before he was traded in the Russell Westbrook deal. Kuzma, who won a title with the team in 2020, spent a majority of his time in the starting lineup, averaging 15.2 points and 5.6 rebounds while shooting 48.8% from the field, including 33.8% from deep.\n\n43. Adrian Dantley (153)\n\nWhile the high-scoring, 6-5 forward played only 116 games over two seasons with the Lakers in the late 1970s early in his career, he was productive.
