        "text": "Shaq and Kobe -- can they succeed without each other?\n\nWell, it's over. The Shaq-Kobe era that is after the rather, um, reckless trade of Shaquille to the Heat in exchange for \"spare change\" (all right Odom is a fine player, and Grant and Butler have their moments, but still).\n\nWe know that together the dynamic duo were at their best capable of winning championships (three no less, with a couple of near misses), but the question of the moment is how much did they rely on each other and how likely are they to succeed now they are playing for teams in different conferences and at opposite ends of the country?\n\nHere's a breakdown to consider for starters:\n\nShaquille O'Neal stat splits for the 2003-04 Regular Season\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Blk Pts Pts100 with Kobe 14.3 58.4% 4.9 3.0 3.2 3.9 12.7 3.1 21.6 100.0 without Kobe 17.8 59.8% 6.6 3.8 3.0 4.2 12.0 1.7 27.8 107.1\n\nStats shown on a per 40 minutes of playing time basis,\n\n\"PTS100\" is points per 100 possessions, ignoring offensive rebounds\n\nPredictably, Shaq's field goal attempts, free throw attempts and points per 40 minutes increase when he's playing without Kobe, and his overall offensive scoring efficiency increases by a hefty 7.1 points per 100 possessions. His FG% also improves without Bryant alongside. The only stat with significant dropoff is his blocks per 40 minutes, where for some reason he gets about half as many without Kobe.\n\nKobe Bryant stat splits for the 2003-04 Regular Season\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Stl Pts Pts100 with Shaq 17.2 45.5% 6.3 5.7 2.9 1.6 5.7 1.7 23.0 100.0 without Shaq 24.0 41.5% 10.3 4.6 2.7 2.0 6.3 2.2 31.6 100.4\n\nStats shown on a per 40 minutes of playing time basis,\n\n\"PTS100\" is points per 100 possessions, ignoring offensive rebounds\n\nWithout Shaquille, Kobe's field goal attempts increase by a whopping 40%, albeit at a cost in field goal percentage (and for you eFG lovers that adjust for three-point shots made, Kobe's eFG is .487 with Shaq, .443 without him).\n\nRemarkably though, Kobe's efficiency doesn't drop despite the lower FG% number, since he gets to the free throw line a whole lot more, but his scoring average zooms up to 31.6 points per 40 minutes, so yes he may well lead the league in scoring once the Diesel is no longer obstructing his way to the paint.\n\nIn other details, Bryant's assists drop slightly without Shaq, but his rebounds and steals move up a little. Most importantly, despite handling the ball more often his turnovers decrease, presumably because he's making less passes into the paint which carry the higher risk/reward equation.\n\nVerdict: from an individual stats standpoint, both players see increases in scoring when apart, with Kobe's efficiency staying steady while Shaq's points per 100 possession metric actually improves! To the casual fan, Kobe may be the winner in that he can light up the scoreboard, but Shaquille shows the best overall ability to shine away from his 'other half'...\n\nAh, but personal stats are only part of the picture -- we also want to look at how the team performs, individual defense (beyond those lightweight block/steal numbers), and how the surrounding teammates fare.\n\nPlus/Minus splits for Shaq-Kobe\n\nPlayer Situation +/- Off48 Def48 Net48 W L W% Shaq with Kobe +379 104.0 93.5 +10.5 45 10 81% Shaq w/out Kobe +57 95.0 91.2 +3.8 34 29 54% Kobe with Shaq +379 104.0 93.5 +10.5 45 10 81% Kobe w/out Shaq -67 94.7 99.3 -4.6 22 36 38%\n\nVerdict: the simple answer is that together Kobe and Shaq made for a dominant force in the NBA, even in the strife filled 03-04 campaign -- an 81% plus/minus game-by-game win rate when they were on the floor together is the second best player-pair in the league from last season, only topped by Tinsley-Artest who were 34-6 (85%) in their game by game plus/minus tallies.\n\nSplit up, Shaq proves to be the player that makes the most difference to winning and losing (at least with the 03-04 Lakers), by a considerable margin -- a raw +57 plus/minus without Kobe looks pretty good next to Kobe's -67 plus/minus without Shaquille, and on a per 48 minute basis it's +3.8 for Shaq alone to -4.6 for Kobe alone.\n\nStill, O'Neal's game-by-game +/- winning record was only 54%, although that's in part a function of limited minutes apart which makes for a more volatile (and thus close to 50%) statistic.\n\nFortunately, neither player will be stuck for next season on a roster matching the Lakers 03-04 crew without the two big dogs, and so we can expect that both players should fare reasonably well, although our money says the Heat will have a better record than the Lakers.\n\nKey Laker Players in 2003-04\n\nGARY PAYTON\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 12.8 49.4% 2.6 6.1 1.9 1.2 4.6 15.9 99.6 Shaq 15.2 45.4% 1.8 7.0 2.4 0.8 5.8 16.4 87.0 Kobe 15.4 46.4% 3.2 6.0 2.9 1.1 4.4 18.2 91.2 neither 18.6 43.8% 2.9 6.7 1.9 0.6 4.8 20.0 90.3\n\nPayton played more efficiently when both Kobe and Shaq were on the floor then when either one or both were on the bench. Not a shock of course, the theory being that Shaq and Kobe's presence makes for some open looks for the other players. More relevant is that with only Kobe Payton was not an efficient scorer (at only 91.2 points per 100 possessions), although he did put in more points per 40 minutes than with Shaq around.\n\nDEREK FISHER\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 10.0 32.0% 2.0 4.7 1.2 1.2 4.1 10.0 81.5 Shaq 11.7 38.5% 2.8 5.1 1.7 0.2 3.2 12.9 86.1 Kobe 13.5 28.7% 1.9 3.5 1.8 0.5 2.5 10.0 61.8 neither 16.0 38.2% 3.9 3.6 2.2 0.8 3.8 17.6 87.5\n\nWith Fisher you have to wonder why the Warriors were so eager to sign him to a six year deal given his poor shooting, low assists per 40 minutes (albeit with low turnovers) and general \"role-player\" standing. Hopefully it wasn't a case of that one clutch shot weighing too heavily in the analysis. The truth is that without Shaq but with Kobe, Fisher struggled mightily, which makes it a good thing for the Lakers perhaps that he's moved on.\n\nKAREEM RUSH\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 11.6 43.5% 1.0 1.8 0.8 0.8 3.0 13.2 99.6 Shaq 11.0 46.9% 1.0 1.9 1.7 0.4 2.5 12.7 95.8 Kobe 13.2 39.2% 0.5 1.3 2.1 1.0 2.6 12.4 80.3 neither 16.7 44.1% 1.1 2.1 1.5 0.8 3.7 17.3 91.2\n\nThis is sadly another warning signal for the Lakers in 2004-05: Rush playing alongside Kobe but without Shaq had big dropoffs in his performance, shooting a mediocre 39% from the field.\n\nRICK FOX\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 8.9 45.3% 0.6 4.3 2.4 1.3 4.8 9.5 81.1 Shaq 8.8 28.3% 1.3 6.1 1.2 1.7 4.4 6.7 62.9 Kobe 7.4 16.7% 2.5 3.7 3.7 1.2 4.3 5.5 45.0 neither 8.8 50.0% 2.6 3.5 3.5 0.9 7.9 12.3 92.1\n\nOops, another Laker who struggled with only Kobe out on the floor (for that matter without both of them it was tough pickings, and the \"neither\" class probably amounts to a fair amount of garbage time).\n\nDEVEAN GEORGE\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 10.9 47.4% 1.1 2.4 1.5 1.9 6.8 13.1 100.3 Shaq 11.5 34.5% 1.5 2.7 2.1 1.6 7.4 10.6 73.7 Kobe 12.5 34.9% 1.0 2.1 2.2 1.9 6.1 11.0 72.7 neither 12.7 40.3% 2.7 2.0 1.6 1.5 6.8 13.9 88.0\n\nYup, the pattern continues. With both Shaq and Kobe on the floor, George shoots an excellent 47.4% from the field (and an eFG of 54.9% since a lot of the shots are three-pointers), but with only Shaq or only Kobe it's a much different story, to the tune of sub-35%!\n\nLUKE WALTON\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 8.5 64.3% 1.5 7.0 3.0 2.7 7.0 14.3 117.5 Shaq 8.8 47.1% 2.3 6.2 2.6 2.8 8.5 11.3 90.9 Kobe 7.1 27.8% 0.4 4.0 2.4 0.8 5.2 4.8 46.9 neither 8.9 35.6% 1.9 6.8 2.2 2.1 7.0 8.6 70.6\n\nBroken record time. Walton with only Kobe is not a recipe for success, and never mind the scoring and shooting, most alarming perhaps is that his rebounds drop like a rock.\n\nBRIAN COOK\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 17.9 42.9% 1.3 2.6 0.0 3.8 10.3 16.7 87.8 Shaq 15.0 72.7% 2.7 2.7 1.4 2.7 8.2 24.6 140.6 Kobe 12.0 45.9% 1.9 1.9 1.3 2.9 7.8 12.9 92.2 neither 12.5 45.6% 1.9 1.6 1.9 2.7 10.0 13.3 85.5\n\nCook played well enough with only Kobe, and limited minutes makes some of the comparisons questionable.\n\nKARL MALONE\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 12.1 48.1% 4.4 4.8 3.0 1.4 9.9 16.0 91.8 Shaq 14.6 51.4% 7.5 5.1 4.3 3.5 14.2 22.4 99.0 Kobe 9.1 48.1% 6.8 3.8 2.3 2.3 11.7 15.6 105.2 neither 10.3 45.0% 2.6 6.7 2.6 2.6 13.5 11.9 81.6\n\nA silver lining perhaps? Malone's most efficient offensive production came when he was with Kobe and not Shaq, as he spent more time inside leading to a better FTA/FGA ratio, and solid rebounding. Interestingly though his assists fell, as he was no longer making the pass into the post to O'Neal.\n\nSTANISLAV MEDVEDENKO\n\nSituation FGA FG% FTM Ast TO OReb Reb Pts Pts100 w/both 15.5 39.3% 2.4 2.0 1.5 4.4 11.0 14.5 79.6 Shaq 14.6 37.1% 2.6 1.2 2.5 2.8 7.7 13.5 73.0 Kobe 14.1 45.6% 1.1 1.4 1.4 5.1 9.5 14.0 87.0 neither 14.7 52.5% 3.5 1.6 1.5 3.7 8.9 19.0 105.6\n\nMedvedenko also played better with only Kobe, suggesting perhaps that the bigger players fare all right in Shaq's absence since they get to take over some of his role. Of course, to say that Medvedenko can replace the Diesel would be laughable!"
