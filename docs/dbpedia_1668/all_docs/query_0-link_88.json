        "text": "The NBA is a star-driven league; that much we know. However, no one — or two or three — player can win a title on his own, and oftentimes, championship runs or playoff victories are decided by the other guys. Here, we detail 25 unsung heroes in NBA playoff history. Each of these players provided a surprising spark of energy and performance for his team when it needed it most, leading to success in the playoffs. The stars may get the glory, but these guys came up big when it mattered most.\n\n3 of 25\n\nMario Elie\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\nMario Elie was a key role player of the 1994 and 1995 championship Houston Rockets. Elie had a tendency to make clutch shots during his playing career, earning him the nickname “Super Mario.” His most heroic shot came in Game 7 of the 1995 Western Conference semifinals, in which he made a three-pointer with only seven seconds left in regulation to give Houston the win. The shot would later become known as the “Kiss of Death,” as after burying the shot, Elie made a kissing gesture toward Suns fans.\n\n4 of 25\n\nDerek Fisher\n\nJesse D. Garabrant/Getty Images\n\nSure, by the end his career we all knew Derek Fisher for the playoff hero that he was. Still, whenever he stepped up and hit a shot when his Lakers’ championship teams needed it most, he always seemed like the most unlikely player to do it. A career 8.3 point per game scorer, Fisher's most fondly remembered postseason moment is the “0.4” shot he hit against the San Antonio Spurs in the 2004 Western Conference semifinals.\n\n7 of 25\n\nGar Heard\n\nDick Raphael/Getty Images\n\nAt the time, it was perhaps most stunning shot in NBA Finals history. With one second remaining in double-overtime of Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals and the Boston Celtics ready to celebrate another championship, Phoenix Suns forward Gar Heard hit an improbable turn-around jumper at the buzzer to the send the game to triple-overtime. Although the Celtics would go on to win, Heard’s jumper makes him one of the NBA's unlikeliest postseason heroes.\n\n8 of 25\n\nGerald Henderson\n\nDick Raphael/Getty Images\n\n“To be honest, if it wasn't for that steal, we probably would have been swept.” This is what Boston Celtics forward Larry Bird said upon reflecting on the 1984 NBA Finals. The incident Bird is referring to is when teammate Gerald Henderson, with the Celtics down by two points and only seconds remaining, stole a pass for Lakers great Magic Johnson and made a layup to send the game to overtime. The Celtics would win in overtime and win the Finals in seven games.\n\n9 of 25\n\nRobert Horry\n\nBill Baptist/Getty Images\n\nNever an All-Star and only averaging seven points per game for his career, it's amazing how clutch Robert Horry was during his career. Whether it was for the Rockets as a youngster, the Lakers with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, or with Tim Duncan's Spurs, Horry nailed so many vital playoff shots that he earned the nicknamed \"Big Shot Bob.\" It's no wonder, given his heroics leading to seven NBA titles to his name.\n\n14 of 25\n\nJohn Paxson\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/Getty Images\n\nWould you rather have Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen take the shot to win an NBA Finals? In the 1993 NBA Finals, it was Chicago Bulls guard John Paxson who was that man. Up 3-2 in the series against the Phoenix Suns, it was the often overlooked role player Paxson who made the game-winning three-pointer with 3.9 seconds remaining to give Jordan and the Bulls their third straight NBA title.\n\n23 of 25\n\nSasha Vujacic\n\nLisa Blumenfeld/Getty Images\n\nAlthough he was often maligned and criticized during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers, guard Sasha Vujacic turned out to be an unlikely hero for the team in the 2010 Finals against the Boston Celtics. With just seconds remaining in Game 7 and the pressure on, Vujacic stepped up to the line and drained the two free throws that would guarantee the Lakers the title."
