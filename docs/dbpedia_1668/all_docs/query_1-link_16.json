        "text": "They are the best two words in sports: Game 7.\n\nThe win-or-go-home nature of a Game 7 is unmatched, especially in the NBA playoffs. After six back-and-forth matchups, many series come down to the deciding contest with the season – and sometimes a championship – on the line.\n\nBasketball has a storied history with Game 7s dating back to when the NBA was the BAA. How often do they happen, and which team is most successful with the series on the line?\n\nHere’s a look back at Game 7s in the NBA playoffs:\n\nHow many Game 7s have there been in NBA playoff history?\n\nThere have been 151 Game 7s in NBA playoff history from 1947 through the second round of the 2024 playoffs.\n\nHow often does the home team win Game 7 in the NBA playoffs?\n\nNBA\n\nHome teams are 112-39 (.742) all-time in Game 7s during the NBA playoffs.\n\nHow many times have the NBA Finals gone to a Game 7?\n\nNineteen NBA Finals have been decided by a Game 7.\n\nWhile history says a Finals series has around a one-in-four shot at reaching a Game 7, it was a more common occurrence in the early days of the league. Ten Finals needed a Game 7 from 1947 to 1970 compared to just nine since. Only four NBA Finals have needed a Game 7 since 1994, with the most recent instance coming in 2016.\n\nThe following Finals are the ones that needed a Game 7: 1951, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1984, 1988, 1994, 2005, 2010, 2013 and 2016.\n\nPostseason history says the Finals are less likely to reach a Game 7 than a second-round or conference finals series, but more likely than a first-round series. Here’s a round-by-round breakdown of how often a series required a Game 7:\n\nFinals: 19 Game 7s (24.7%)\n\nConference finals: 38 Game 7s (28.8%)\n\nConference semifinals: 63 Game 7s (27.6%)\n\nFirst round: 31 Game 7s (17.6%)\n\nHas an NBA Game 7 ever gone to overtime?\n\nSeven Game 7s have needed overtime to decide a series with one extending to double overtime.\n\nTwo of those overtime Game 7s came in the Finals. The Boston Celtics won the 1957 title with a double-overtime victory over the St. Louis Hawks and the 1962 title with an overtime win over the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nFour of the remaining overtime games happened in the conference semifinals and the other one happened in the conference finals. The most recent overtime Game 7 came in the 2021 Eastern Conference semifinals, as the eventual champion Milwaukee Bucks beat the Brooklyn Nets on the road.\n\nWhich NBA playoffs had the most Game 7s?\n\nThe 1994, 2014 and 2016 NBA playoffs hold the record for the most Game 7s with five apiece.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, two of those postseasons culminated with a Game 7 in the Finals. The Houston Rockets got a Game 7 win over the New York Knicks to win the 1994 championship, while the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Golden State Warriors in an epic Game 7 to clinch the franchise’s first title in 2016.\n\nBy contrast, all five of the Game 7s in the 2014 playoffs came in the first round.\n\nWhich NBA playoffs had the fewest Game 7s?\n\nThere have been 13 NBA postseasons without a Game 7, but it’s been a while since that last happened.\n\nThe most recent playoffs without any Game 7s was 1999, back when the first round had best-of-five series. Every playoff in the 21st century has featured at least one Game 7.\n\nOf the 13 playoffs without a Game 7, seven occurred when there were just three best-of-seven series each year. Prior to 1968, the division semifinals were best-of-five, leading into best-of-seven division finals and Finals.\n\nThe following playoffs are the ones without a Game 7: 1947, 1949, 1950, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1967, 1972, 1983, 1985, 1989, 1991 and 1999.\n\nWhich NBA team has played in the most Game 7s?\n\nThe Celtics hold the record for most Game 7 appearances in NBA history with 37. The Lakers have the next-highest total with 24, while the Philadelphia 76ers are in third place with 18.\n\nSpeaking of the Sixers, they have the most Game 7 defeats in league history with 12. Six of those came against Boston, with Celtics-Sixers being the most common Game 7 matchup historically with eight showdowns dating back to 1959, when the Sixers were the Syracuse Nationals.\n\nWhich NBA team has played in the fewest Game 7s?\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves, New Orleans Pelicans and Charlotte Hornets are tied for the fewest Game 7 appearances with two apiece.\n\nThe Timberwolves hold the record for the highest Game 7 win percentage in league history. Minnesota won its first Game 7, beating the Sacramento Kings in the 2004 second round and taking out the defending champion Denver Nuggets in the 2024 second round."
