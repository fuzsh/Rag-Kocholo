        "text": "The Dallas Mavericks were at risk of being swept by the Boston Celtics entering Game 4 of the 2024 NBA Finals on Friday. With their backs against the wall, the Mavericks delivered one of the biggest beatdowns in Finals history.\n\nThe Mavericks led by as many as 48 points in their 122-84 win over the Celtics at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. The 38-point differential marked the third-largest margin of victory in Finals history.\n\nAs the Mavericks look to become the first team in history to come back from a 3-0 deficit, many NBA fans may be wondering about another record that no one wants attached to their name: What's the biggest NBA Finals blowout? What’s the fewest points scored in the NBA Finals? We got you covered.\n\nNBA FINALS GAME 4: Celtics vs. Mavericks recap, highlights\n\nWhat is the biggest loss in NBA Finals history?\n\nThe biggest loss in NBA Finals history belongs to the Utah Jazz. Here's the six* biggest Finals losses:\n\n1. 1998 Finals, Game 3: Chicago Bulls 96, Utah Jazz 54\n\nMargin of victory: 42 points\n\nKarl Malone was the only Jazz player in double digits, recording 22 points and three rebounds. The next highest scorer for Utah was Shandon Anderson, who scored eight points off the bench. The Jazz were held to nine fourth-quarter points, the second-fewest points scored in the fourth quarter in Finals history. Meanwhile, Bulls superstar Michael Jordan had 24 points and Toni Kukoc added 16 points.\n\n2. 2008 Finals, Game 6: Boston Celtics 131, Los Angeles Lakers 92\n\nMargin of victory: 39 points\n\nBoston starters Kevin Garnett (26), Rajon Rondo (21) and Ray Allen (26) combined for 73 points in their series-clinching win. The Celtics outscored the Lakers 34-15 in the second quarter and the Lakers were not able to recover, despite 22 points from superstar Kobe Bryant. The Lakers' 38 turnovers also didn't help and led to 32 Boston points.\n\n3. 2024 Finals, Game 4: Dallas Mavericks 122, Boston Celtics 84\n\nMargin of victory: 38 points\n\nDallas used a 40-14 run over the first and second quarters for a 50-25 lead. It took a 61-35 lead into halftime and then extended its advantage to 88-52 with 3:18 left in the third quarter. Mavs star Luka Doncic rebounded from a substandard Game 3 and pointed criticism of his game, scoring 29 points (25 in the first half), delivering five assists, collecting five rebounds and registering three steals. Kyrie Irving added 21 points and six assists.\n\n4. 2013 Finals, Game 3: San Antonio Spurs 113, Miami Heat 77\n\nMargin of victory: 36 points\n\nEverything went in from deep for the Spurs in this one. They hit 50% of their 3-pointers (16-for-32) with seven coming from Danny Green and six from Gary Neal off the bench. A six-point game at halftime turned into a laugher as the Spurs outscored the Heat 63-33 in the second half.\n\n5. 1978 Finals, Game 6: Washington Bullets 117, Seattle SuperSonics 82\n\nMargin of victory: 35 points\n\nSeven Bullets scored in double figures, led by Elvin Hayes’ 21 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks and 19 points each from Bob Dandridge and Mitch Kupchak. Washington outscored Seattle 70-47 in the second half.\n\nT-6. 1985 Finals, Game 1: Boston Celtics 148, Los Angeles Lakers 114\n\nMargin of victory: 34 points\n\nKnown as the Memorial Day Massacre, the Celtics trounced the Lakers. Kevin McHale had 26 points, all five Celtics starters scored in double figures (Larry Bird had 19 points, nine assists, six rebounds, three steals), and Scott Wedman had 26 points off the bench. The 148 points remains a record for most in a Finals game.\n\nT-6. 1961 Finals, Game 1: Boston Celtics 129, St. Louis Hawks 95\n\nMargin of victory: 34 points\n\nTom Heinsohn had 26 points and 11 rebounds, Bill Russell had 15 points and 31 rebounds. It was the third of eight consecutive Celtics championships.\n\nWhat's the fewest points scored in the NBA Finals?"
