        "text": "This story has been updated from a previous version.\n\nNick Saban has achieved just about everything there is to achieve as a college football coach.\n\nSeven national championships, 10 conference championships (one MAC, nine SEC), an .884 career winning percentage, 12-time national coach of the year honors and a host of player-related trivia that would make the entire College Football Hall of Fame envious.\n\nBut one stat in particular comes up more often than perhaps anything else Saban has accomplished: his record against former assistant coaches.\n\nMORE: Nick Saban's next challenge? Dominate NIL era with same winning culture\n\nIt's a record that spans 12 seasons and has made victims of nine former assistants who went on to become head coaches at separate 10 teams. And Saban has beaten every single one of them — but two.\n\nTo be sure, it's not exactly a secret as to how Saban has achieved the feat. Just ask Ole Miss coach and Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, who has lost to Saban twice since leaving Tuscaloosa:\n\n\"He's undefeated vs. almost everybody,\" Kiffin said before Ole Miss' 2021 game at Alabama (via the Clarion Ledger). \"There's a reason he's the best in the history of college football. Even when people know how his place works, he's still undefeated, which is amazing.\"\n\nKiffin certainly isn't wrong in his summation of Saban's record against former assistants — especially when you contextualize that string of victories. With that, Sporting News takes a look at his record vs. assistants, including all-time record, margin of victory, series histories and more:\n\nWhat is Nick Saban's record vs. former assistants?\n\nSaban boasts a 28-2 record against his former assistants, a streak that started against Tennessee coach Derek Dooley in 2010.\n\nThat streak officially ended on Oct. 9, 2021 when Jimbo Fisher's unranked Aggies upset No. 1 Alabama in College Station, 41-38. It also broke Alabama's streak of 100 straight wins vs. unranked opponents.\n\nMORE: How long will Nick Saban coach Alabama? What contract extension means for college football\n\nWhat former assistants have coached against Saban?\n\nTo date, nine of Saban's former assistants have coached against him: Dooley, Kiffin, Fisher, Smart, Mark Dantonio, Jeremy Pruitt, Will Muschamp, Jim McElwain and Billy Napier. He has beaten Fisher the most, four times, coaching against him every year since 2017. He has a 3-0 record against five assistants; a 2-0 record against Dantonio; and a 1-0 record against Napier.\n\nBelow is where each of Saban's previous assistants served under him.\n\nMark Dantonio: Defensive backs (Michigan State,1995-00)\n\nJimbo Fisher: Offensive coordinator/quarterbacks (LSU, 2000-04)\n\nDerek Dooley: Tight ends (LSU, 2000-02); associate head coach/running backs (LSU, 2003-04); tight ends (Miami Dolphins, 2005-06)\n\nWill Muschamp: Linebackers (LSU, 2001); defensive coordinator (LSU, 2002-04); associate head coach (Miami Dolphins, 2005)\n\nKirby Smart: Defensive backs (LSU, 2004); safeties (Miami Dolphins, 2006); associate head coach/defensive backs (Alabama, 2007); defensive coordinator (Alabama, 2008-15)\n\nJeremy Pruitt: Director of player development (Alabama, 2007-09); defensive backs (Alabama, 2010-12); defensive coordinator/linebackers (Alabama, 2016-17)\n\nJim McElwain: Offensive coordinator/quarterbacks (Alabama, 2008-11)\n\nBilly Napier: Analyst (Alabama, 2011); wide receivers (Alabama, 2013-16)\n\nLane Kiffin: Offensive coordinator/quarterbacks (Alabama, 2014-16)\n\nSteve Sarkisian: Analyst (2016), Offensive coordinator (2019-20)\n\nHere is Saban's record against each of them (plus where they coached against him):\n\nCoach Team(s) Record vs. Saban Mark Dantonio Michigan State 0-2 Jimbo Fisher Florida State (0-1), Texas A&M (1-3) 1-5 Derek Dooley Tennessee 0-3 Will Muschamp Florida (0-2), South Carolina (0-1) 0-3 Kirby Smart Georgia 1-4 Jeremy Pruitt Tennessee 0-3 Jim McElwain Colorado State (0-1), Florida (0-2) 0-3 Billy Napier Louisiana 0-1 Lane Kiffin Ole Miss 0-3 Steve Sarkisian Texas 0-1\n\nMORE: Nick Saban's respect for Bear Bryant extends beyond national championship record\n\nNick Saban's margin of victory vs. former assistants\n\nOf the former assistants he's faced, Saban has scored the most points against Fisher (206) and surrendered the fewest to Dantonio (seven). He has the highest average margin of victory against Napier (42 points per game) and the greatest point differential against Dooley (93 points):\n\nCoach Point differential Margin of victory Mark Dantonio 87-7 (plus-80) 40 points per game Jimbo Fisher 230-147 (plus-83) 13.8 points per game Derek Dooley 122-29 (plus-93) 31 points per game Will Muschamp 127-54 (plus-73) 24.3 points per game Kirby Smart 162-132 (plus-30) 6 points per game Jeremy Pruitt 141-51 (plus-90) 30 points per game Jim McElwain 114-37 (plus-77) 25.6 points per game Billy Napier 56-14 (plus-42) 42 points per game Lane Kiffin 135-93 (plus-42) 14 points per game Steve Sarkisian 20-19 (plus-1) 1 point per game\n\nWhich assistants have beaten Nick Saban?\n\nFisher and Smart were the first Saban disciples to beat him, both in the 2021 college football season.\n\nThe Aggies upended No. 1 Alabama in College Station, 41-38. Following that, Smart rematched against Saban and Alabama in the College Football Playoff championship game after losing 41-24 in the SEC championship game. The Bulldogs won the second meeting 33-18 to win the national championship.\n\nHonorable mention goes to Kiffin, who gave Saban all he could handle in a 63-48 loss in Oxford, Miss. in 2020. Special consideration should also be given to McElwain, who coached his Gators to a 29-15 loss in the 2015 SEC championship game.\n\nMORE: All-time Nick Saban-coached team, from Tua Tagovailoa to DeVonta Smith\n\nNick Saban history vs. former assistants\n\nSaban vs. Derek Dooley\n\nOct. 23, 2010: No. 7 Alabama 41, Tennessee 10\n\nOct. 22, 2011: No. 2 Alabama 37, Tennessee 6\n\nOct. 20, 2012: No. 1 Alabama 44, Tennessee 13\n\nSaban vs. Jim McElwain\n\nSept. 21, 2013: No. 1 Alabama 31, Colorado State 6\n\nDec. 5, 2015: No. 2 Alabama 29, No. 18 Florida 15 (SEC championship)\n\nDec. 3, 2016: No. 1 Alabama 54, No. 15 Florida 16 (SEC championship)\n\nSaban vs. Mark Dantonio\n\nJan. 1, 2011: No. 15 Alabama 49, No. 7 Michigan State 7 (2011 Capital One Bowl)\n\nDec. 31, 2015: No. 2 Alabama 38, No. 3 Michigan State 0 (2015 Cotton Bowl semifinal)\n\nSaban vs. Will Muschamp\n\nOct. 1, 2011: No. 3 Alabama 38, No. 12 Florida 10\n\nSept. 20, 2014: No. 3 Alabama 42, Florida 21\n\nSept. 14, 2019: No. 2 Alabama 47, South Carolina 23\n\nSaban vs. Jimbo Fisher\n\nSept. 2, 2017: No. 1 Alabama 24, No. 3 Florida State 7\n\nSept. 22, 2018: No. 1 Alabama 45, No. 22 Texas A&M 23\n\nOct. 12, 2019: No. 1 Alabama 47, No. 24 Texas A&M 28\n\nOct. 3, 2020: No. 2 Alabama 52, No. 13 Texas A&M 24\n\nOct. 9, 2021: Texas A&M 41, No. 1 Alabama 38\n\nOct. 8, 2022: No. 1 Alabama 24, Texas A&M 20\n\nSaban vs. Kirby Smart\n\nJan. 8, 2018: No. 4 Alabama 26, No. 3 Georgia 23 (overtime) (College Football Playoff championship)\n\nDec. 1, 2018: No. 1 Alabama 35, No. 4 Georgia 28 (SEC championship)\n\nOct. 17, 2020: No. 2 Alabama 41, No. 3 Georgia 24\n\nDec. 4, 2021: No. 3 Alabama 41, No. 1 Georgia 24\n\nJan. 10, 2022: No. 3 Georgia 33, No. 1 Alabama 18\n\nSaban vs. Jeremy Pruitt\n\nOct. 20, 2018: No. 1 Alabama 58, Tennessee 21\n\nOct. 19, 2019: No. 1 Alabama 35, Tennessee 13\n\nOct. 24, 2020: No. 1 Alabama 48, Tennessee 17\n\nSaban vs. Billy Napier\n\nSept. 29, 2018: No. 1 Alabama 56, Louisiana 14\n\nSaban vs. Lane Kiffin\n\nOct. 10, 2020: No. 1 Alabama 63, Ole Miss 48\n\nOct. 2, 2021: No. 1 Alabama 42, No. 12 Ole Miss 21\n\nNov. 12, 2022: No. 9 Alabama 30, No. 11 Ole Miss 24\n\nSaban vs. Steve Sarkisian"
