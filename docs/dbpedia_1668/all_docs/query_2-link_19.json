        "text": "Key dates in NBA history:\n\nJan | Feb | Mar | April | May | June | July | Aug | Sept | Oct | Nov | Dec\n\nJune 1, 1979\n\nThe Seattle SuperSonics, who dropped the championship series opener, beat Washington 97-93 in Game 5 for their fourth consecutive Finals victory, capturing their only NBA Championship, as Gus Williams scored 23 points and Jack Sikma grabbed 17 rebounds.\n\nJune 1, 1993\n\nDan Majerle of Phoenix set a then-playoffs record by sinking eight 3-pointers during the Suns’ 120-114 victory over Seattle in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals. Majerle finished the game with 34 points.\n\nJune 1, 1994\n\nIndiana’s Reggie Miller drilled an NBA playoffs record five 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of the Pacers’ 93-86 win over host New York in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals. Miller finished with a game-high 39 points, shooting 6-for-11 from 3-point range. Five players have since tied Miller’s record of five 3-pointers in one quarter of a playoff game.\n\nJune 1, 2005\n\nThe original dominating big man and Hall-of-Famer George Mikan dies at 80.\n\nJune 1, 2011\n\nDallas Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki makes the tie-breaking layup with 3.6 seconds left, and the Dallas Mavericks roar back from 15 points down in the fourth quarter to beat the Miami Heat 95-93 and tie the NBA Finals at one game apiece. The Mavs outscore the Heat 22-5 down the stretch and pull off the biggest comeback win in an NBA Finals since 1992.\n\nJune 2, 1985\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Los Angeles Lakers became the all-time leading scorer in NBA playoff history, surpassing Jerry West’s total of 4,457 points, as the Lakers beat Boston, 136-111, in Game 3 of the NBA Finals — a series they would win in six games. Abdul-Jabbar was eventually passed for total playoff points by Chicago’s Michael Jordan.\n\nJune 2, 1996\n\nSeattle, led by 26 points from Shawn Kemp and 21 from Gary Payton, defeats visiting Utah, 90-86, in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, earning the SuperSonics a trip to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1979.\n\nJune 2, 2000\n\nThe New Jersey Nets name Rod Thorn, who had been serving as the NBA’s Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations, as the team’s new president. Thorn, who served as an assistant coach with the Nets between 1973-75 and then again between 1976-78, had been in professional basketball for more than four decades as a player, assistant coach, head coach, general manager and league official. He joined the league office in February 1986, and was in charge of all on-court operations, including scheduling, officiating, game conduct and discipline.\n\nJune 2, 2020\n\nWashington Bullets legend and Hall of Famer Wes Unseld dies at 74. Unseld was the NBA’s MVP and Rookie of the Year in 1969 and led the Bullets to an NBA title in 1978. One of the NBA’s Top 50 Players, Unseld retired in 1981 and moved into a front-office job with the Bullets and also coached the team for seven seasons (1987-94).\n\nJune 3, 1977\n\nPortland’s Bobby Gross scored 25 points while center Bill Walton controlled the boards with 24 rebounds, enabling the Blazers to defeat the Sixers, 110-104, in a crucial Game 5 of the NBA Finals at Philadelphia.\n\nJune 3, 1984\n\nMagic Johnson handed out an NBA Finals-record 21 assists as the Los Angeles Lakers beat Boston, 137-104, in Game 3 of a championship series the Celtics would eventually win in seven games.\n\nJune 3, 1992\n\nHost Chicago defeated Portland, 122-89, in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Michael Jordan, who finished with a game-high 39 points, set NBA Finals records for points scored in a half (35) and 3-pointers made in one half (six). After the sixth trey, Jordan turned to the midcourt TV camera and shrugged as if to say, “I guess everything’s going in.”\n\nJune 3, 1999\n\nUtah’s Karl Malone becomes the ninth player in NBA history to win the Maurice Podoloff trophy twice when he is named the league’s MVP for the 1998-99 season. He previously won the award for his play during the 1996-97 season.\n\nJune 3, 2018\n\nGolden State’s Stephen Curry nails nine 3-pointers in a 122-103 win in Game 2 vs. the Cleveland Cavaliers, breaking Ray Allen’s record for the most 3-pointers in an NBA Finals game.\n\nJune 4, 1976\n\nBoston’s Jo Jo White scored 33 points as the Celtics outlasted Phoenix, 128-126, in triple-overtime in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, at the time the longest Finals game ever. Phoenix forward Gar Heard, who set a then-Finals record by playing 61 minutes, hit a buzzer-beater to force the third overtime. Phoenix and Chicago went to triple-overtime in Game 3 of the 1993 Finals, a game won by the Suns, 129-121. Kevin Johnson of Phoenix broke Heard’s previous Finals record for minutes played with 62.\n\nJune 4, 1987\n\nThe Lakers shot a then-NBA Finals record 61.5% from the field and Michael Cooper set what was then a Finals record by sinking six 3-pointers in a 141-122 victory over Boston in Game 2 of their championship series — eventually won by the Lakers in six games. The Lakers’ field-goal percentage remains the second-highest in Finals history. Magic Johnson’s 20 assists were one shy of his own NBA Finals record, and the Lakers’ 44 assists tied the team single-game NBA Finals record set by another Lakers’ team on May 6, 1970.\n\nJune 4, 1995\n\nThe Orlando Magic advanced to the NBA Finals in only the sixth year of the franchise with a 105-81 win over visiting Indiana in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. Shaquille O’Neal had a game-high 25 points to lead the Magic and Dennis Scott set NBA playoff records for a seven-game series for the most 3-pointers attempted (65) and the most treys made (28).\n\nJune 4, 1997\n\nThe NBA announced that the Dallas Mavericks and the Houston Rockets would play an NBA regular-season game in Mexico on December 6, 1997. The event marked the first time the NBA has staged a regular-season game in Mexico, which joined Japan as the only two countries outside of the United States and Canada to host an NBA regular-season game.\n\nJune 4, 2000\n\nDown 15 points with 10:28 to go in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, the Los Angeles Lakers stage an epic comeback against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Lakers outscore the Blazers 29-11 down the stretch, clinching the victory off a Kobe Bryant-to-Shaquille O’Neal alley-oop with 40 seconds left. The win sends the Lakers to their first Finals since the 1990-91 season.\n\nJune 4, 2009\n\nRandy Smith, who played in a then-record 906 NBA games between 1972-82, dies at the age of 60.\n\nJune 4, 2020\n\nThe NBA Board of Governors today approves a competitive format to restart the 2019-20 season with 22 teams returning to play and a tentative start date of Thursday, July 30. The 22 returning teams were the 16 teams (eight per conference) in playoff positions and the six teams that were six games or fewer behind the eighth seed in their respective conferences. Those two groups comprise teams with the NBA’s 22 best records.\n\nJune 5, 1977\n\nThe phenomenon known as Blazermania reached a peak as Bill Walton blocked eight shots, a record for an NBA Finals game (since tied by three players), and Portland beat Philadelphia 109-107 in Game 6 to win its only NBA championship.\n\nJune 5, 1991\n\nMichael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls drove the lane against the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 2 of the 1991 NBA Finals. As he moved past Byron Scott with the ball in his right hand, Jordan took off for the basket intending to dunk. The Lakers’ Sam Perkins came over to try to contest the shot, but Jordan switched the ball into his left hand while in midair and gently flipped it in off the glass. The vintage Jordan effort helped the Bulls beat the Lakers 107-86 en route to their first title. Chicago set a Finals record for team shooting percentage at .617 (50-for-81). Bulls guard John Paxson also tied a Finals record by shooting 1.000 (8-for-8) from the field, tying Scott Wedman, who was 11-for-11 for Boston in Game 1 of the 1985 Finals against the Lakers.\n\nJune 5, 1992\n\nPortland defeated Chicago 115-104 in overtime in Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Danny Ainge was a key factor for Portland in OT, tying a Finals record set by John Havlicek (1974) and Bill Laimbeer (1990) by scoring nine of the Blazers’ 18 points in the extra session.\n\nJune 5, 1994\n\nNew York, led by Patrick Ewing’s 24 points and 22 rebounds, defeated Indiana 94-90 at Madison Square Garden in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, sending the Knicks to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1973.\n\nJune 5, 1996\n\nGlobal television coverage of the 1996 NBA Finals between Chicago and Seattle reaches a record 169 countries on six continents in 40 different languages. The Bulls’ 107-90 win in Game 1 at the United Center earns a 16.8 rating and a 31 share on NBC and is viewed in a record 16,111,200 homes.\n\nJune 6, 1946\n\nThe National Basketball Association was founded at the Commodore Hotel in New York. Maurice Podoloff was the league’s first president, a title later changed to commissioner.\n\nJune 6, 1982\n\nPhiladelphia held Los Angeles center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to his all-time playoff low of six points and trounced the Lakers 135-102 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.\n\nJune 6, 1989\n\nThe Pistons beat the Lakers 109-97 in Game 1 of the 1989 NBA Finals, snapping the Lakers streak for consecutive wins during one postseason at 11.\n\nJune 6, 1996\n\nAt a press conference in Chicago, NBA Commissioner David J. Stem announces plans for the “NBA at 50” celebration, which commemorated the league’s 50th anniversary during the first half of the 1996-97 season.\n\nJune 6, 1997\n\nScottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls tied an NBA Finals record when he made seven 3-pointers in Chicago’s 104-93 Game 3 loss to the Utah Jazz. Kenny Smith of the Houston Rockets had set the record with seven treys vs. Orlando on June 7, 1995.\n\nJune 6, 2000\n\nThe NBA announced that effective July 1, Stu Jackson, the NBA’s Senior Vice President of Basketball Operations, would assume the responsibilities previously held by Rod Thorn as head of the NBA’s Basketball Operations department. His duties were to include chairing the league’s Competition and Rules Committee, overseeing officiating, and imposing discipline for misconduct by players and coaches. It was announced Jackson would report to NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer Russ Granik.\n\nJune 6, 2000\n\nJoe Dumars, a six-time NBA All-Star and 1989 Finals MVP with the Detroit Pistons, was named the team’s President of Basketball Operations. Dumars was hired as Vice President of Player Personnel on June 14, 1999, and served in that capacity during the 1999-2000 season.\n\nJune 6, 2001\n\nFor only the second time in NBA Finals history, two opposing players scored 40 or more points in the same NBA Finals game. Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers (48 points) and Shaquille O’Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers (44 points) each surpassed the 40-point mark in Game 1 of NBA Finals 2001, a 107-101 Philadelphia win in overtime.\n\nJune 6, 2001\n\nIn the 2001 Finals, Philadelphia 76ers star Allen Iverson uses his trademark crossover dribble against Los Angeles Lakers guard Tyronn Lue. Iverson then stepped back and hit a fadeaway jumper as Lue fell down. After the shot went through, Iverson took an exaggerated step over the prone Lue on his way back up the court. That basket gave the Sixers a 105-103 lead in overtime as they would go on to win Game 1.\n\nJune 7, 1978\n\nThe Washington Bullets traveled to Seattle and defeated the SuperSonics 105-99 in Game 7 to win the NBA Championship. During this series, Washington coach Dick Motta famously proclaimed, “The opera isn’t over until the fat lady sings.”\n\nJune 7, 1990\n\nTerry Porter of the Portland Trail Blazers made all 15 of his free-throw attempts in Portland’s 106-105 overtime win over Detroit in Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Porter’s perfect performance set an NBA Finals record for most free throws made without a miss.\n\nJune 7, 1992\n\nIn Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Chicago and Portland combined to score only 31 points in the third quarter, the lowest-scoring third quarter in Finals history. The Blazers’ 94-84 loss was the ninth straight homecourt defeat suffered by a Western Conference club, dating back to 1989, also an NBA Finals record.\n\nJune 7, 1993\n\nNew Jersey guard Drazen Petrovic, a 1993 All-NBA Third Team selection and a member of the Croatian team that won a silver medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, was killed in an automobile accident in Germany.\n\nJune 7, 1995\n\nBolstered by the outside shooting of guard Kenny Smith, who set NBA Finals records for most 3-pointers made in a game (seven) and quarter (five), Houston overcame a 20-point first-half deficit and defeated host Orlando 120-118 in overtime in Game 1 of the ’95 Finals. Hakeem Olajuwon’s tip-in with only three-tenths of a second left in OT gave the Rockets their comeback victory and a 1-0 series lead. The teams also combined to fire up an NBA Playoff and Finals record 62 3s, with the Rockets hitting 14-for-32 attempts and the Magic 9-for-30.\n\nJune 7, 1998\n\nThe Chicago Bulls defeat the Utah Jazz 96-54 in the most lopsided game in the history of the NBA Finals. The 54 points by the Jazz is also an NBA record for fewest points in a game since the inception of the 24-second shot clock.\n\nJune 7, 2000\n\nShaquille O’Neal scores 43 points against the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of NBA Finals 2000, using a variety of dunks, spin moves and jump hooks. In doing so, he continued a trend established at the start of NBA Playoffs 2000. In the Lakers’ first game in the first round against Sacramento, O’Neal exploded for 46 points. In a second round series opener against Phoenix, he posted a 37-point effort. In the Western Conference Finals opener against Portland, he came out of the box with 41 points. In all, O’Neal averaged 41.8 ppg in the year’s playoff openers. O’Neal’s domination in Game 1 nearly landed him in the NBA Finals record book. He finished the night with 21 field goals, one shy of the NBA Finals mark of 22, co-held by Elgin Baylor and Rick Barry. O’Neal joins Baylor, Barry, Jerry West and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA Finals history to hit at least 21 field goals in a game.\n\nJune 8, 1979\n\nThe New Orleans Jazz moved to Salt Lake City, thus becoming the Utah Jazz.\n\nJune 8, 1982\n\nJamaal Wilkes scored 27 points and Magic Johnson posted three 13s — 13 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists — as the Los Angeles Lakers beat Philadelphia 114-104 in Game 6 of the Finals to win their second NBA title in three years.\n\nJune 8, 1984\n\nAs a courtside thermometer registered 98 degrees, Boston’s Larry Bird answered the challenge by shooting 15-for-20 from the field and scoring 34 points in Boston’s 121-103 Game 5 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. “I love to play in the heat” said Bird. “I just run faster and create my own wind.”\n\nJune 8, 1986\n\nLarry Bird’s 29 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds helped Boston beat Houston 114-97 in Game 6 to wrap up the Celtics’ 16th NBA title and Bird’s second NBA Finals MVP in three years.\n\nJune 8, 1999\n\nUtah’s Karl Malone is voted to an NBA record 11th All-NBA First Team.\n\nJune 8, 2001\n\nShaquille O’Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers tied the NBA record for most blocked shots in an NBA Finals game when he rejected eight shots in Game 2 of NBA Finals 2001, a 98-89 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. O’Neal tied eight block-performances by Bill Walton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing.\n\nJune 8, 2021\n\nDenver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic is named NBA MVP, becoming the first Nuggets player and the lowest-drafted player ever to collect the honors. He is also the first player from Serbia to be selected as MVP and, at the time, joined Dirk Nowitzki (Germany) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) as NBA MVP winners from Europe.\n\nJune 9, 1980\n\nRed Auerbach cemented his reputation as one of the greatest executives in NBA history with his second-most famous trade. Auerbach obtained center Robert Parish and a 1980 first round draft choice that would become forward Kevin McHale from the Golden State Warriors for a pair of 1980 first round draft choices that became Joe Barry Carroll and Rickey Brown. Parish, McHale and Larry Bird are considered by many NBA experts to be the greatest starting frontcourt in NBA history. The trio won three NBA titles in their first six seasons together.\n\nJune 9, 1985\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers beat Boston 111-100 in Game 6 to win the NBA Finals. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was unanimously voted NBA Finals MVP — at 38, the oldest player ever to gain that honor.\n\nJune 9, 1987\n\nMagic Johnson borrowed a weapon from Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to beat the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals. With the Celtics clinging to a one-point lead, Johnson got the ball on the left side and drove toward the middle, then lofted what he called a “junior junior sky-hook” for a 107-106 victory. The Lakers went on to win the series in six games.\n\nJune 9, 1991\n\nChicago (five) and the Los Angeles Lakers (10) combined for a then NBA Finals low 15 turnovers, in Game 4 at the Great Western Forum, a 97-82 win for the Bulls that gave them a 3-1 series lead. On June 19, 2000, the Lakers (5) and Indiana Pacers (9) broke the mark by combining for only 14 turnovers in the Lakers’ clinching 116-111 Game 6 victory.\n\nJune 9, 1995\n\nWith a 117-106 victory in Game 2 of the NBA Finals at Orlando Arena, the Houston Rockets set a then playoff record for a single season with their seventh straight road win. Hakeem Olajuwon’s 34 points and 11 rebounds, Sam Cassell’s 31 points off the bench and Robert Horry’s NBA Finals single game record seven steals lifted the Rockets to a 2-0 series lead.\n\nJune 9, 2000\n\nShaquille O’Neal spent a large portion of Game 2 of NBA Finals 2000 at the free-throw line, and spent that time shattering an NBA record for most free throws in a playoff game. His 39 free-throw attempts dwarfed the playoff record of 32 attempts by Boston’s Bob Cousy in a four-overtime game vs. Syracuse on March 21, 1953.
