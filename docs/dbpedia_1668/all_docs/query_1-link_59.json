        "text": "Statistical milestones in the NBA don’t hit with the same punch. That’s because, other than single-game totals, everything is seen in per-game averages. In the NHL, a player can score, say, 50 goals or have 100 points. In the NFL quarterbacks throw for 5,000 yards and pass rushers pick up 20 sacks. What do we do with the NBA? Well, averaging 30 points per game is a nice round number, and one that has not been hit by many players. In fact, only 36 players in NBA history have done it. There are those players, from the one-timers to the regulars.\n\n1 of 36\n\nJack Twyman (1)\n\nHy Peskin/Getty Images\n\nBy starting with the one-timers, and going chronologically, we were destined to start with one of those old-school names that pop up in NBA lists here and there. Fortunately, we would call Twyman the one player on this list that isn’t well-known, even among the old-timey guys. That being said, Twyman is in the Hall of Fame, and he made six All-Star Games. He also was the first player to average over 30 points per game, doing so for the Cincinnati Royals in the 1959-60 season. Do recall, this was before the three-point line as well.\n\n2 of 36\n\nBob Pettit (1)\n\nJack Zehrt/FPG/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nNow here is a name fans of reading NBA lists likely knows! Pettit shows up quite often as one of the best players from the early days of the NBA. He was a two-time MVP, and a two-time scoring champ. Neither came in the year he averaged 31.1 points (and 18.7 rebounds!) for the St. Louis Hawks in 1961-62. How could that be the case?\n\n3 of 36\n\nWalt Bellamy (1)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\nHere’s why Pettit wasn’t scoring champ in 1961-62! Bellamy, a rookie at that, averaged 31.6 points per game. If you want the feeling of a throwback, Bellamy was playing for the Chicago Packers, who became the Zephyrs, who became the Baltimore Bullets. And yet, the Hall of Famer didn’t lead the NBA in scoring either. We’ll get to that guy later.\n\n4 of 36\n\nNate Archibald (1)\n\nJames Drake/Getty Images\n\nUsually known as “Tiny” Archibald, in 1972-73, playing for the elegantly-named Kansas City-Omaha Kings the point guard led the NBA in points (34.0) and assists (11.4) per game. However, somehow, Archibald only finished third in MVP voting. Some voters, especially back then, cared about a team’s win-loss record, and the Kings finished below .500.\n\n5 of 36\n\nPete Maravich (1)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\n“Pistol Pete” has been back in the hoops chatter because Caitlin Clark just beat his collegiate points record, but while Maravich wasn’t quite the same level of unstoppable in the pros, he was still a great player. He made four All-NBA teams and mixed flashy passing with high-level scoring. Playing for the New Orleans Jazz in 1976-77, Maravich averaged 31.1 points per game to lead the NBA.\n\n6 of 36\n\nWorld B. Free (1)\n\nDavid Madison/Getty Images\n\nFree was more than just a guy with a notable name. Although, he was also something of an empty-calories scorer, and is the first guy on this list not in the Hall of Fame. Free only made one All-Star Game, and it came in 1979-80. He earned that spot in a season where he averaged 30.2 points per contest for the San Diego Clippers. This was the year the three-point line came to the NBA, but that didn’t play a role. Free made 0.1 threes per game.\n\n7 of 36\n\nMoses Malone (1)\n\nJames Drake/Getty Images\n\nMalone made history when he entered the NBA right out of high school, and he was a force on the floor. He won three MVPs, but Malone’s greatest skill was rebounding. Malone led the NBA in rebounds per game six times. One of those years, 1981-82, Malone did average 31.1 points per game alongside 14.7 rebounds for the Rockets. Yes, he won MVP.\n\n8 of 36\n\nBernard King (1)\n\nFocus on Sport/Getty Images\n\nNow, when King averaged over 30 points per game, he only played in 55 contests for the Knicks. He would miss the entire next season with a knee injury, and only play six games the season after that, so we’re willing to cut King some slack. Plus, in 1984-85, he averaged a robust 32.9 points per game. Had he played a full season, it’s not like he was going to drop below 30.\n\n9 of 36\n\nKarl Malone (1)\n\nJEFF HAYNES/AFP via Getty Images\n\n“The Mailman” always delivered, and what he delivered was 14 All-NBA teams, two MVPs, and, to date, the third-most points in NBA history. Oddly, he also only delivered one 30-point season. While the Jazz icon averaged 25.4 points per game in his 18 seasons with the franchise, his 31.0 points per game occurred in 1989-90. To be fair, he averaged 29 points per game the season before and the season after that.\n\n10 of 36\n\nTracy McGrady (1)\n\nTom Pidgeon/Getty Images\n\nAnother straight-from-high-school player, McGrady’s career started slowly. In fact, the only major award he won in his career was Most Improved Player. That occurred when he moved from the Raptors to the Magic and got a chance to spread his wings. He did that, in part, by twice leading the NBA in scoring. The first time T-Mac did that, 2002-03, he averaged 32.1 points per game.\n\n11 of 36\n\nDwyane Wade (1)\n\nWendell Cruz/USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe icon of Miami basketball, Wade was a winner, as his three rings indicate. He had a well-rounded game, making second-team All-Defense twice, for example. The guy could also get buckets. In 2008-09, Wade led the NBA in scoring with 30.2 points per game, while also finishing third in Defensive Player of the Year voting!\n\n12 of 36\n\nRussell Westbrook (1)\n\nJaime Valdez/USA TODAY Sports\n\nWestbrook’s greatest claim to fame is not only averaging a triple-double over a season, but doing it four times, effectively rendering what was once a remarkable occurrence almost blasé. The first year he did that, Russ also won MVP, even though the Thunder were far from a top team. That will happen when you pair your 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists per game with 31.6 points per contest. We know Westbrook has not always been the picture of efficiency, and that he was not afraid to chase stats. Even so, we’re overlooking how incredible his 2016-17 season was.\n\n13 of 36\n\nJayson Tatum (1)\n\nKen Blaze/USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe last one-timer, Tatum, did it in the 2022-23 season. Still in his prime, the Celtics star could do it again, but we shall have to wait and see. Tatum averaged 30.1 points per game, just eking it out. He’s already an all-star five times over, so all that’s missing is a ring, or some major hardware.\n\n14 of 36\n\nRick Barry (2)\n\nFocus on Sport via Getty Images\n\nNow, this is an NBA list, keep that in mind. Twice, Barry averaged over 30 points per game in the ABA, but those aren’t part of this tally. In fact, the first time he did it, 1966-67, Barry averaged a staggering 35.6 points to pace the NBA. That was with the San Francisco Warriors. After his sojourn in the competing league, Barry returned to the Golden State Warriors and a few seasons in put up 30.6 points per game in 1974-75. It was one of the six times he led the NBA in free-throw percentage. Long live underhanded free-throw shooting!\n\n15 of 36\n\nGeorge Gervin (2)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\n“The Iceman” also played in the ABA, but he rose to acclaim with the Spurs in the NBA. Gervin led the NBA in scoring four times, including his two 30-point seasons. In 1979-80 he averaged 33.1 points per game. Then, after “only” averaging 27.1 ppg the next season, he popped back up to 32.3 in 1981-82.\n\n16 of 36\n\nDominique Wilkins (2)\n\nFocus on Sport via Getty Images\n\nWilkins is not just the Dunk Contest guy, an “also ran” in a league dominated by a guy you will see later on this list (much later, in fact). Nique made nine All-Star Games, and he averaged over 30 a game twice with the Hawks. Also, once, cruelly, he averaged 29.9 points per contest. His 30.3 points a night in 1985-86 led the NBA, while his 30.7 in 1987-88 did not.\n\n17 of 36\n\nKevin Durant (2)\n\nEd Szczepanski/USA TODAY Sports\n\nEven with injury hampering his career, Durant is already in the top 10 in career points. He’s one of the best shooters of all time, a member of the 50-40-90 club, and a four-time scoring champ. Both of his 30-point seasons came when he was with the Thunder. KD averaged 30.1 points per game in 2009-10, and then 32.0 in 2013-14, his MVP season.\n\n18 of 36\n\nSteph Curry (2)\n\nBrad Penner/USA TODAY Sports\n\nDurant is one of the best shooters ever. Curry is the best, and few argue that at this point. Is it easier to average 30 points per game in the era of the explosion in three-pointers? Sure, but Curry was at the forefront of that evolution. He’s averaged 9.2 three-point attempts per game, but he’s made 42.6 percent of them, and is far and away the leader in career threes at this point. In his second MVP season, 2015-16, Curry was in the 50-40-90 club with 30.1 points per game (and a league-leading 2.1 steals per game as well). Then, tossing up a whopping 12.7 treys a night, the Warriors icon put up 32.0 points per contest.\n\n19 of 36\n\nDamian Lillard (2)\n\nJaime Valdez/USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor all his shooting skills, and clutch moments, Lillard is resigned to the shadow of Curry, a future Hall of Famer with a similar game to an all-time great. Six of his seven All-NBA appearances have been second or third team, but that’s still impressive. So is the fact he tallied an even 30.0 points per game in 2019-20 for the Blazers and then 32.2 in 2022-23, his final season with the franchise.\n\n20 of 36\n\nBradley Beal (2)\n\nRich Storry/USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf you average over 30 points a game in back-to-back seasons for the Wizards, does it make a sound? Washington was arguably the most-forgettable franchise in the NBA during Beal’s best years there. It also counts against him a bit that he played 57 and 60 games respectively in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons. Plus, you know, the pandemic. Even so, 30.5 and 31.3 points per game in back-to-back years is remarkable.\n\n21 of 36\n\nJoel Embiid (2)\n\nTrevor Ruszkowski/USA TODAY Sports\n\nEmbiid was on pace to be a three timer.. He averaged 30.6 points and 33.1 points in 2021-22 and 2022-23. Embiid was averaging a whopping 35.3 points per game in 2023-24…before suffering an injury after 34 games. He returned for the Sixers for a couple games before the playoffs and ended up averaging 34.7 points per game. Unfortunately, he also played in fewer than half the games in the season, so he did not qualify for the end-of-season leaderboards, and thus not for this list.\n\n22 of 36\n\nLuka Doncic (2)\n\nJerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports\n\nDoncic has joined this list with back-to-back seasons of averaging over 30 points per game in 2022-23 and 2023-24. The first time around, the Mavericks star put up 32.4 points per contest, which is impressive. Then, he kicked it up a notch. Doncic comfortably led the NBA in points per game in 2023-24 at 33.9, though an injury to Embiid that left him short of eligibility played a role in that.\n\n23 of 36\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo (2)\n\nDavid Banks/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAntetokounmpo is an all-time great, a Defensive Player of the Year winner, and did definitively put up 31.1 points per game in the 2022-23 season. Giannis followed that up with another 30 ppg campaign. Even with the addition of Damian Lillard, the Bucks were still built around Giannis, whether Adrian Griffin or Doc Rivers was the head coach. It wasn't easy, but Antetokounmpo did average 30.4 points per game in 2023-24.\n\n24 of 36\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander (2)\n\nGary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports\n\nDid you realize Shai was this good? That the Thunder star is has now put up back-to-back seasons averaging over 30 points per game in 2022-23 and 2023-24? This past season was his age-25 campaign! If SGA didn’t play in OKC, he’d be one of the biggest names in the NBA. He did slump a bit toward the end of the 2023-24 season, even though the Thunder earned the one seed in the West, but did just enough to average 30.1 points per contest.\n\n25 of 36\n\nElgin Baylor (3)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\nWe mentioned a couple of 30-point guys from the early ‘60s and noted they didn’t lead the NBA in scoring. Well, at the same time, Baylor was filling buckets at an incredible level. Three seasons in a row, 1960-61 through 1962-63, Baylor averaged over 30 with the Lakers. Specifically, he averaged 34.8, 38.3(!), and 34.0 points a night. And yet! Baylor also didn’t lead the NBA in scoring. Since we’re talking about the early ‘60s, you can probably guess who did.\n\n26 of 36\n\nBob McAdoo (3)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\nBob McAdoo: Kind of underrated! That’ll happen when your best seasons come with the Buffalo Braves. From 1973-74 through 1975-76, McAdoo averaged 30.6, 34.5, and 31.1 points per game. In that middle season there the Hall of Famer did win the MVP. Again, with the Buffalo Braves.\n\n27 of 36\n\nKobe Bryant (3)\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea/USA TODAY Sports\n\nKobe could be an unabashed gunner and stats padder, but he made 15 All-NBA teams and 12 All-Defense teams, so he was truly a great player. The lifelong Laker averaged 30.0 points in 2002-03, which didn’t lead the NBA. His next two 30-point campaigns, 2005-06 and 2006-07, he did. That first season he averaged 35.4 and the next he put up 31.6. Interestingly, it was the next season he won his MVP.\n\n28 of 36\n\nLeBron James (3)\n\nGary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe first-(or second-) best basketball player ever has done many remarkable things. One of them is the sheer length of time between his first and his third 30-point seasons. His first (31.4) came with the Cavaliers in 2005-06, his age-21 season. His last (30.3) came in 2021-22 with the Lakers. That was his age-37 season. In between, LeBron averaged 30.0 in 2007-08 to lead the NBA. Remember, this was at the end of an era when scoring was down in the league.\n\n29 of 36\n\nJames Harden (3)\n\nTroy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports\n\nTalk your trash about Harden, but the dude has led the NBA in scoring three times (and in assists) twice and is cruising into the Hall of Fame as one of the 10 best players of his generation. His three seasons that qualify for this list came in back-to-back-to-back years with the Rockets. Harden won the MVP averaging 30.4 points in 2017-18, took things to almost unheard-of levels with 36.1 points in 2018-19, and then went back down to a mere 34.3 points in 2019-20.\n\n30 of 36\n\nJerry West (4)\n\nFocus on Sport via Getty Images\n\nWest has long been known for his ornery personality (even before he wanted to sue a TV show for depicting him as…the kind of guy who would sue a fictionalized TV show). Maybe it’s because he never won MVP. Perhaps it is because he is a historical anomaly who won Finals MVP for a losing team. Or, it may be because he averaged over 30 points per game four times, but only led the league in scoring once. The Lakers legend spread his seasons out a bit: 1961-62 (30.8), 1964-65 (31.0), 1965-66 (31.3), and 1969-70 (31.2). That last one is when he led the NBA.\n\n31 of 36\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (4)\n\nJerry Cooke/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nAbdul-Jabbar and West overlapped in the league, but not playing together for the Lakers. While Kareem won three MVPs in L.A., here’s something fascinating: All four of his 30-point seasons came with the Bucks. He did it three seasons in a row from 1970-71 through 1972-73. He averaged 31.7, a whopping 34.8, and 30.2 points in those three campaigns. In his final season with Milwaukee, 1974-75, he averaged an even 30 points. Then, off to Los Angeles!\n\n32 of 36\n\nAdrian Dantley (4)\n\nFocus on Sport via Getty Images\n\nIs Dantley the most-underrated scorer in NBA history? Think about it. Did you imagine Dantley, even though he’s a Hall of Famer, was one of seven guys to average over 30 points per game at least four times? The wing scorer did it four seasons in a row with the Jazz. From 1980-81 through 1983-84, Dantley averaged 30.7, 30.3, 30.7, and 30.6 points per contest. So yeah, no massive seasons in the mix there, but that’s still a remarkable run.\n\n33 of 36\n\nAllen Iverson (4)\n\nRon Chenoy/USA TODAY Sports\n\nEven though he was undersized and played in a defensive-minded era where games featuring two teams that didn’t break 90 points were a regular sighting, Iverson racked up points with gusto. There’s a reason he was nicknamed “The Answer.” Iverson led the NBA in scoring four times, though the first of those times he didn’t hit 30 points. In 2000-01 he averaged 31.1 and the next season he put up 31.4. Then, in 2004-05 he led the NBA with 30.7 points per game. The next year Iverson had his best season, 33.0 points a night, but did not lead the NBA. Plus, the Sixers legend led the NBA in steals per game three times as well.\n\n34 of 36\n\nOscar Robertson (6)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\nWe skip over five timers. The top three guys on this list are true legends, and reasonable choices for the three best bucket getters in NBA history. Playing for the Cincinnati Royals throughout the ‘60s, Robertson led the NBA in scoring once, but that was a season where he averaged 29.2. His six, yes six, 30-point seasons never led the NBA. “The Big O” made a splash by averaging 30.5 points per game as a rookie in 1960-61. The next season: 30.8. After one season falling below the mark, Robertson picked it back up to average 31.4, 30.4, 31.3, and 30.5 points the next four years. By the way, Robertson was no gunner. He led the NBA in assists per game seven times, and before Westbrook, he was the guy who had averaged a triple-double. “The Big O” was one of the best players of all time.\n\n35 of 36\n\nWilt Chamberlain (7)\n\nBettmann/Getty Images\n\nMaybe it’s because it was a long time ago, or because the “ringz” crowd promote Bill Russell over Chamberlain, but Wilt’s numbers get underappreciated. For the first seven seasons of his career, 1959-60 through 1965-66, Chamberlain averaged over 30 points per game. He didn’t eke by the threshold, either. In that time Wilt never averaged under 33.5 points per contest. Once, he averaged 50.4 points per game. The era doesn’t matter. That is utterly incredible. Oh, and in all seven of those seasons he also averaged over 20 boards a game as well.\n\n36 of 36\n\nMichael Jordan (8)\n\nRick Stewart/Allsport/Getty Images\n\nWho else could it be? Nobody averaged over 30 points per game more than Jordan, and nobody ever will in our estimation. Seven seasons in a row, the NBA icon averaged over 30 points, ranging from 30.1 up to 37.1. That would have sufficed, and Jordan did retire after that seventh season. Then, Jordan returned. In 1995-96 he averaged 30.4 points per game, giving him an eighth season. He would lead the NBA in points per game two more times, but didn’t quite hit 30 again."
