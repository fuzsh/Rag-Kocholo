        "text": "This page features the complete list of players with 60-point games in the NBA, including the season and playoffs.\n\nHere you have the list of players who scored at least 60 points in an NBA game. Only 2 from a total of 91 performances of 60 or more points took place in the playoffs. Michael Jordan owns the playoff record with 63 points and Elgin Baylor the Finals record with 61.\n\nWilt Chamberlain was a scoring machine and he is at the top of the list with his legendary 100-point game. That number was thought to be completely out of reach for modern-era players until 2005-06 when Kobe Bryant scored 62 points in 3 quarters before sitting in the fourth and then, a month later, he climbed to the second place on this list by scoring 81 points.\n\nOnly ten players scored 70 points or more: Chamberlain (he did it 6 times), Kobe, Luka Doncic, David Thompson, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, David Robinson, Elgin Baylor, Devin Booker, and Joel Embiid.\n\nWhile for most players a 60-point game is a once-in-a-lifetime achievement, Chamberlain appears here 32 times. The other players who scored 60 or more multiple times are Kobe Bryant (6 times, including the final game of his career), Michael Jordan, Damian Lillard (5 times each), Elgin Baylor, James Harden (4 times each) Devin Booker and Stephen Curry (twice each).\n\nAfter almost 5 years of drought for this list since Kobe scored 61 in 2009, Carmelo Anthony (62) and LeBron James (61) joined this selected group in 2014. In 2016-17 Klay Thompson was the first to finish with 60 in less that 30 minutes (29). In 2017-18 James Harden had the first 60-point triple-double in NBA history. Luka Doncic got the second in 2022-23.\n\nIn 2019-20 Damian Lillard had three 60-point games. Chamberlain is the only other player with at least 3 such games in the same season, he had 15 in 1961-62 and 9 in 1962-63."
