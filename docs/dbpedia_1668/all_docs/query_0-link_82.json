        "text": "The postseason annals of the Los Angeles Lakers are already full of unfathomable shots that turned dying teams into title teams. On Tuesday in Game 2 of the N.B.A. finals, Kobe Bryant added to the collection.\n\nWith the surprising Detroit Pistons seemingly assured of going up by 2-0 in the four-of-seven-game series, Bryant hit a jump shot over Richard Hamilton from several feet behind the 3-point line to tie the score with 2.1 seconds left in regulation.\n\nThe shot saved the Lakers, stunned the Pistons, and restored order in the basketball world. Rejuvenated by Bryant's basket, the heavily favored Lakers went on to dominate overtime to win, 99-91, at the Staples Center.\n\n''As far as my pro career, that was probably the biggest shot I ever hit,'' Bryant said. ''As far as my career, I put it second to the shot I hit to beat Rip in high school,'' he said, referring to Hamilton.\n\nThe series is tied at a victory each, with Game 3 in Auburn Hills, Mich., on Thursday night.\n\nBryant, finishing with a game-high 33 points, scored 7 points in overtime and the final 47.8 seconds of regulation to lead a 16-2 game-ending run by the Lakers. Shaquille O'Neal scored the other 9 points in the spurt. Los Angeles outscored Detroit by 10-2 in the extra session.\n\nO'Neal ended with 29 points and 7 rebounds. No other Laker scored in double figures. The little-used reserve Luke Walton had 7 points, 8 assists and 2 blocks off the bench.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
