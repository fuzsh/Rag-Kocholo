What's up with all the changes in radio stations? I feel like I must have been living under a rock.... because I'm noticing that there have been so many changes in playlists and formats within the last few months I can't even keep up!

Out of curiousity, I'm wondering... what's your favorite radio station when you're:

1) at the beach

2) at work

3) driving (my favorite!!!)

Ha, yeah I have XM too and love it. Haven't listened to much "regular radio" in a few years.

However, my boat's stereo does not have XM and since the season began, I've been tuning in a lot more to NJ radio stations. Here's my lineup, in Ocean County:

1. Hit 106 (Top 40) 106.3/106.5

2. WJRZ (Oldies but with an uptempo rock focus) 100.1

3. The Hawk (Classic Rock) 105.7

4. WFAN (Sports Talk) 660AM

101.9 is a pretty good NYC rock station. Much better then 92.3 was in the few years before it died.

That and WFAN are what i usually listen to
