        "text": "The Backbeat is rock band from central NJ trying to recapture the sounds of the 60's along with modern influences, which in essence creates a style all their own. They are all seasoned musicians with the capacity to give you that sweet, melodic, catchy rock n' roll sound you've been searching for your whole life. Their charm and banter during their performances make any audience member feel as though they are right on stage with the group. The band was formed by Vinny Rugnetta and EJ Green in the Fall of 2006 with the central idea of bringing the classic rock sound back to the younger generation. In the Fall of 2007 the group was nominated for Best Pop/Rock Band at the Asbury Park Music Awards after only playing on the scene for less than a year. Their original song \"Girl From Montreal\" has been featured on numerous popular radio stations in the city of Montreal, while other songs of theirs have been played on numerous college radio stations, podcasts, and internet radio stations. Vinny and EJ performed together for sixteen years forming a true bond and love of music. EJ has since moved on to work for the prestigious MIT, leaving behind a legacy of wonderful music and fond memories. Vinny, now remains the nucleus of the group with different line ups bringing audiences great music at every performance.\n\nThese days the band mostly performs popular classic rock music of The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Doors, ELO, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Beach Boys, and Jimmy Buffett along with songs from many other popular classic rock acts. Though, the band is known to thrown in an original or two during a gig from time to time. The Backbeat has played many different rock clubs, bars, restaurants, and fairs in New Jersey and New York City. Vinny has even performed as far away as Virginia Beach, Montreal, and Los Angeles.\n\nThe band currently consists of Vinny Rugnetta at the helm on lead vocals, rhythm acoustic & electric guitars, and the Hofner bass guitar, performing as the core member of the band. The band also features Joe Lisa on lead guitar and violin/fiddle. His violin and guitar style naturally blends in with the tone of the band. Joe has had a very distinguished career so far performing with different acts as well as having studied under the top teachers in the country. The band is excited to have him as a featured member and looks forward to a bright future together. The band also showcases Ryan \"Bones\" Hackett of Hackett Custom Guitars on bass guitar. Ryan, has been playing bass guitar for decades and performs with top tribute bands and acts across the north east. Rounding out the band are revolving musicians; Michael Hogan on lead guitar, James Hallberg on drums, Rick Brunermer on saxaphone, Al Noboa on percussion and drums, and Erez Lirov on trumpet and keys."
