        "text": "Lead / Rhythm Guitar/Vocals\n\nI started primarily as a vocalist in a local rock band in my hometown of The Bronx, NY as an early teen, circa 1970. I played various instruments early on and then focused on guitar. In the beginning, I played mostly the then contemporary popular rock music of the late sixties and seventies. Thanks to being from a musical family, my influences went back a lot further, especially those of my older brother who exposed me to the music of the fifties and early sixties. This music was becoming known as “Oldies” and was making a major resurgence at the time. In 1972, my rock band and I were invited to back the recently reformed vocal group, The Regents of “Barbara Ann” fame. We went from the local high school dances to travelling the entire USA, playing everything from little clubs to major concert venues. Along the way, starting as The Regents band, we became an in demand backing unit. As a guitarist and vocalist, I was privileged to provide musical support to countless legends and stars of the early rock and roll era. I was fortunate to work with these artists while in their prime, especially the great vocal groups which were often still mostly intact from their golden era. Among them were The Platters, Moonglows, Coasters, Drifters, Cleftones, Duprees, Skyliners, Teenagers, Flamingos, Imperials, Del-Vikings ,Belmonts, Diamonds, Five Satins, Jive Five, Cadillacs, Dubs, Juniors, Diamonds, Tokens, Shirelles, Crystals, Marvelettes, Channels, Earls, Delrons, Impalas, Salutations, Elegants, Don & Juan, Starlighters, Contours and more. Other great artists include Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Lou Christie, Mark Lindsay, Andy Kim, Merrilee Rush, Little Anthony, Gary US Bonds, Bobby Lewis, Del Shannon, Ron Dante, Bobby Vee, Tommy Roe, Mitch Ryder, Pat Upton (Spiral Staircase), Joey Molland (Badfinger), Clem Curtis (Foundations), Freddy Cannon, Martha Reeves, Maxine Nightingale, Eddie Holman, Archie Bell, Dr. Elmo and Billy J. Kramer. I have shared the stage with these greats and have rubbed elbows with many more. As we are well into the 21st Century, many of these artists are not as active as they once were or have left performing completely. To me, The Cameos represent a fresh take on the best of the best of the music that I spent the better part of my life finding a career in. Although I was always pleased to provide an occasional fill in for them over the last few years, I am thrilled to have been asked join the group full time in 2015. I look forward to a new and long chapter sharing this legacy with The Cameos and their fans.\n\nBass Guitar and Vocals\n\nBorn and raised in the City of Newark, NJ, I began my musical career singing bass with the acapella group The Savoys. Our stage was the corner of the main entrance to the Stephen CraneVillage housing project where we lived. After a few years of performing at many events in the Greater Newark area, we became a self-contained vocal group. I started playing the bass guitar,while singing the bass/baritone vocal parts.\n\nIt wasn’t long before our newly packaged group was heard by Denny Randell and Charlie Calello, songwriter and music arranger, respectively, for The Four Seasons. They took the group into the recording studios of Columbia Records and Metro Media Entertainment, with Stephen Crane Village, their childhood home, as the group’s new name. Those sessions produced 5 records, one of which, “Hey Summer”, hit the Billboard Magazine charts at #40 with a red bulletin the first week of its release. (The song can be heard on YouTube, along with the other songs)\n\nI attended Jersey City State College as a Music Education major on the double bass, earning a Master of Arts as well as a MA Degree in Urban Education. Some of my most memorable experiences were playing double bass for various symphony orchestras in the Essex/Union County areas, and electric bass in the “pit” for many high school musical theatre revivals. Some of the well-known performers I have accompanied on the bass are the original Duprees, Shirley Alston Reeves of the Shirelles, The Coasters, and The Toys. I also toured with Bobby Valli and Jersey Dreams. The show was a tribute to The Jersey Boys. One of the highlights in my life was when I was a “roadie” for Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. During that exciting time, traveling all over the country as well as to England and Canada, I learned so much about what it takes to be a professional entertainer just by watching and listening to “my boys” on and off stage. The responsibilities are enormous, and the demands on the performers are never-ending. It is the true professional who lives up to the high standards required of the performer.\n\nAlso in my Performing Arts portfolio is my work as an actor, performing with The Actors Project NYC, as well as a screenplay writer. Working with my partner, Joe Stefanelli, 2nd tenor with the Savoys and Stephen Crane Village, we wrote a feature length script titled, “The Corner Boys”, which is the story of the group’s beginnings on the corner to their almost making it big as recording stars.\n\nIn closing, I want to say that I’ve been a fan of The Cameos for a long time now. Their blend of singers and musicians is 2nd to none. I also admire The Cameos for their solid work ethic, their respect for their fans, and their reverence for the music which they love to perform. As I mentioned earlier with regard to living up to the demands and responsibilities of the performer, the Cameos consistently maintain that high standard so necessary to be considered professionals, which they most certainly are. Last but certainly not least, I want to give a special shout-out to my dear friend John Basilone for making it possible for me to be a part of this exciting, dynamic show group."
