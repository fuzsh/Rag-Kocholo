        "text": "If you happen to be on Valley Road between Bellevue and Lorraine Avenues in Montclair anytime soon, be sure your car radio is tuned to 91.9 FM. As if by magic, the same song will mysteriously start playing, as it has every day for 13 years.\n\nThe song is “I’ll Make Love to You,” by the band Boyz II Men. This romantic interlude is the brainchild of music maven and tech-savvy guru George Louvis, a longtime resident of Montclair.\n\nThe idea began with brief, one-minute informative broadcasts in front of places such as car dealerships to help with sales, part of an advertising campaign he put together.\n\nOne day, Louvis decided to set up shop—in this case a transmitter—atop the Montclair Diner. It was a way that customers could always enjoy an entrée with a healthy side of music, guaranteed to repeat as long as you were sitting in or around that special spot.\n\nWhy that particular Boyz II Men song?\n\nLouvis says a friend borrowed his transmitter and returned it with that song, so he decided to leave it playing.\n\nAnd folks wanted to hear it—that’s why it’s still playing.\n\n[RELATED: The Story Behind Chester’s Abandoned Telephone Pole Farm]\n\nIn fact, an avid listener even made T-shirts to commemorate this unusual radio station, which Louvis points out is a legal, low-powered radio station, according to the FCC.\n\nLouvis says he’s tried to shut down the transmitter several times, but people always implored him not to. So how long will this local favorite keep on keepin’ on? Stay tuned!"
