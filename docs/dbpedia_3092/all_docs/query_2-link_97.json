        "text": "Thought I would give it a try after many years of different hobbies. Some people still remember me from 40 years ago. Is there a trucker channel in NJ STILL? Is there any locals in Sparta NJ? Haven't picked up anything but skip here. Please let me know the return policy is 7 days. Ron\n\nYes, CB is still alive and well in NJ, but you'll find them mostly on the Interstate highways and some local highways. It's not as popular as it was \"back in the day,\" but you'll still get to do the \"Breaker 1-9, radio check\" and get a big 10-4 out of it. Channel 19 is still active, as are a few of the others, depending on location.\n\nAnd don't forget: \"State Police Monitor CB Channel 9...\" (sarcasm intended)\n\ni don't go out of my way to listen to cb. a few time's i've received spectrumsweeper hit's on my base scanner. for the most part i lock them out. cb for the most part has become useless chatter.\n\nforget about any police dept. listening for a distress call, especially in n.j. i did hear at one time <i believe> that the uscg station's maintain a watch on cb ch. 9. anyone in the know, please chime in.\n\nCB radio now a days depending where you are, is mostly quiet however again it is all depending on ones location. Urban areas tend to use Ch 10, while Ch 19 still carries trucker traffic, it seems to be still popular with the truckers using echo special effects on their audio. Rare, however you do still find some areas with local chatter. As mentioned earlier, most activity is either in urban areas or along popular trucking roots.\n\nI fired up my old CB few months ago and after a day or two monitoring while going to and from work I disconnected it.\n\nMy main disappointment was when there was radio traffic it was loaded with profanity. Ever other word...Phew! I can understand if you hit your finger with a hammer or stub your toe. If the participants were trying to impress someone with their language..it was not me!\n\nMy 2 cents on CB in Jersey.\n\nThank you...\n\nI do know of one PD that still listens for emergency traffic on CB channel 9. That would be the Orange County Sherrif's Dept, in Orange County, Florida. If you ever call for them on channel 9, ask for Orange County Control. They will respond.\n\ni don't go out of my way to listen to cb. a few time's i've received spectrumsweeper hit's on my base scanner. for the most part i lock them out. cb for the most part has become useless chatter.\n\nforget about any police dept. listening for a distress call, especially in n.j. i did hear at one time <i believe> that the uscg station's maintain a watch on cb ch. 9. anyone in the know, please chime in.\n\nWell, checking around the band seems there is a nice group of guys using 39 lsb in the central jersey area. South Plainfield and surrounding towns, also heard Staten Island and some stations in Brooklyn.\n\nYeah, I heard some activity on channel 19 today. Somebody was loading a trailer at USA Container Corp or I think that's what It was called. Heard some obscenities used. But It was cool, since I never monitored CB before."
