        "text": "The last decade has seen the development of multiple unique, independent radio stations popping up in New York City. Here are our top 10.\n\nNew York City has always been known as the self-made city; and the pioneers of these independent radio stations are no exception.\n\nProviding platforms for independent artists of all genres, from across the city, these stations are both big and small, crucially giving artists of all levels access to the airwaves â the well-seasoned vets and the newcomers alike.\n\nThese NYC stations curate for the masses and most, if not all, operate right from the heart of your various neighborhoods.\n\n1. WFMU\n\nOne of the pioneers of free-form radio is WFMU ('free-form radio' means that the station allows DJs and hosts total creative freedom over their shows).\n\nAlthough WFMU technically operates out of Jersey City, NJ, the station broadcasts across the Hudson River to New York City, Rockland County, Hudson Valley, Lower Catskills, Western New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and Mount Hope, NY.\n\nBroadcasting on the airwaves, as well as maintaining an extensive online presence, WFMUâs programming encompasses a range of sounds:\n\nâFlat-out uncategorizable strangeness to rock and roll, experimental music, 78 RPM Records, jazz, psychedelia, hip-hop, electronica, hand-cranked wax cylinders, punk rock, gospel, exotica, R&B, radio improvisation, cooking instructions, classic radio airchecks, found sound, dopey call-in shows, interviews with obscure radio personalities and notable science-world luminaries, spoken word collages, Andrew Lloyd Webber soundtracks in languages other than English as well as country and western music.â\n\nTheir goals and distinguishable traits revolve around experimentation; allowing their free-form programming to be a solid place for independent artists to send their music in.\n\n2. Newtown Radio\n\nNewtown began in 2009 and is now based out of a community space in Bushwick.\n\nAs well as housing Newtown radio, the Bushwick location provides a free-form space for artists, radio hosts, musicians and DJs of every genre.\n\nThe site's project space for visual artists hosts openings every first Friday of the month, and becomes a backdrop for live sessions on many evenings in between.\n\nIf you want to play or have your music played on Newtown Radio, get in touch. Anyone can apply for their own show and/or submit their own music through their website.\n\n3. Rise Radio\n\nNestled in Williamsburg is Rise Radio Cafe. Rise serves as not only a broadcast station within the cafe, but as a community space for events and live DJ sets.\n\nRise has a consistent programming geared to highlight local talents, specifically in the DJ scene offering several open decks events.\n\nWhether youâre in the neighborhood or making the trip, the folks at Rise Radio are crucial to meet and connect with, especially as an independent artist within the city.\n\n4. The Lot Radio\n\nOperating out of a shipping container in an empty lot in Greenpoint, Brooklyn is The Lot Radio.\n\nThe Lot serves as an online radio station, streaming 24/7. Their website and online set up is reminiscent of a Boiler Room camera setup while the busy, sticker-filled room adds to the aesthetic of the show.\n\nThe Lot has already grown to be one of the most innovative and busy stations in NYC, despite only starting in 2016. The Lot team also host weekly concerts at the church across the street from the station, and promote exciting live events around the city.\n\n6. Radio-Free Brooklyn\n\nRadio Free Brooklyn is a nonprofit and non-commercial community internet station founded back in 2015, and their values haven't changed, placing a huge emphasis on local issues:\n\nâLocal music, local politics, LGBT rights, gentrification, gender issues, food, and more.â\n\nHighlighting original content made by Brooklyn and NYC natives, RBF differs in that it encourages âliveâ interactions with music rather than focusing on podcasts.\n\nStarting from a basement of a Bushwick bike shop with 17 shows, RBF now has over 120 members and over 75 shows; allowing them to stream 24/7 from an upgraded studio over in Williamsburg.\n\n7. Radio.Bonita\n\nOn the more underground side of online radio is Radio Bonita. Affiliated with the youth organization, Brujas, Radio Bonita is your:\n\nâGo-to source for music and politics from the streets.â\n\nHighlighting Latin American artists and DJs, Radio Bonita was founded in NYC and now also has satellite over in Mexico City. Their goal as a station is to transcend borders and remind the public that we are ungovernable.\n\nRadio Bonita differs from the other stations in its grassroots and revolutionary goal and platform; rooting its foundation in activism.\n\n10. Heritage Radio Network\n\nOperating out of Robertaâs Pizza, in a makeshift studio inside two shipping containers, is Heritage Radio Network.\n\nThe 24-hour, 7 days-a-week online station is a nonprofit media outlet that focuses on educational storytelling about food in attempts to build a more âequitable, resilient food system.â\n\nHRN has produced 84 podcast series (and counting) along with providing a 6-month internship program to college students about podcast production. HRN also hosts worldwide events geared toward their goal of food awareness and education. Listeners are encouraged to donate or even underwrite for HRNâs shows, allowing for their services to continue on."
