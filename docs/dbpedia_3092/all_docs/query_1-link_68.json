        "text": "As other reviewers have said, the current ap has much to be desired with respect to integrating commercials with programming. Iâve contacted the station a few times and was assured they were working on it. One small example is when I try to listen to the station before 6 am (I usually turn it on at 545) most of that time is filled with commercials. Each time I open the ap I have to listen to one of 2 really long commercials. Then at least 4 short commercials follow. This never changes. It wastes time and it wonât even let me blank out my screen because if I do it shuts down And I have to hear it all over again. Itâs frustrating and I find myself not wanting to tune in at all. Itâs probably time to move on. I donât need this first thing in the morning when all I want to hear is traffic, weather, and news.\n\nIâve been using this app every day since it came out and have loved it. I listen no matter where I go, even to Nicaragua! Like having a little bit of Jersey with me. But the app has become unbearable. I think itâs âshufflingâ of commercials has led to it becoming very unreliable. When I first started using the app I had no trouble, recently it needed minor prompting from me to keep going (opening the app and then it would get through itâs buffer). Now I hear one commercial and it gets stuck buffering. I canât listen anymore. Iâll keep checking back to see if itâs improved, but for now I guess Iâm off to another station..."
