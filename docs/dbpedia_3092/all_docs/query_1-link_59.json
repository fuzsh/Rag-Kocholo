        "text": "I don't know if they still do this anymore but Seton Hall University (WSOU - 89.5 - in South Orange) did play heavy metal once. But upon looking at their website, has leaned more on alternative rock.\n\nBTW, 92.3 K-Rock has come back to New York City...you can probably catch them down where you are.\n\nThere are pretty much no heavy metal FM radio stations. You'll need to listen to freeform radio. I actually host a metal show on Mondays from 8pm-10pm EST on my campus radio station. There's another metal show at the station and he's on RIGHT NOW AS I'M TYPING THIS 9pm-midnight on Sundays.\n\nThe summer schedule isn't up yet, but here is the station's website: www.wmucradio.com\n\nYou can stream the broadcast live from that website, so you don't even need to be in the College Park area to listen."
