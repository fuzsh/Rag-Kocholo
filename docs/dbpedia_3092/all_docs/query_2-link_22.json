I feel like I must have been living under a rock.... because I'm noticing that there have been so many changes in playlists and formats within the last few months I can't even keep up!\n\nOut of curiousity, I'm wondering... what's your favorite radio station when you're:\n\n1) at the beach\n\n2) at work\n\n3) driving (my favorite!!!)\n\nHa, yeah I have XM too and love it. Haven't listened to much \"regular radio\" in a few years.\n\nHowever, my boat's stereo does not have XM and since the season began, I've been tuning in a lot more to NJ radio stations. Here's my lineup, in Ocean County:\n\n1. Hit 106 (Top 40) 106.3/106.5\n\n2. WJRZ (Oldies but with an uptempo rock focus) 100.1\n\n3. The Hawk (Classic Rock) 105.7\n\n4. WFAN (Sports Talk) 660AM\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by tallguylehigh\n\nIt pains me that the NYC area has no real, modern rock stations left.\n\n101.9 is a pretty good NYC rock station. Much better then 92.3 was in the few years before it died.\n\nThat and WFAN are what i usually listen to"
