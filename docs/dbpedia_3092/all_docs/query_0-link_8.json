        "text": "Many of you have responded enthusiastically to our blog posts yesterday and Tuesday.\n\nI get it. The themes both days have been all about supporting young, fledgling broadcasters. We may have our differences about deregulation, voicetracking, programmatic, and other issues facing radio today. But one thing almost all of us agree on is the need to encourage young people to pursue radio careers.\n\nOver the last several years this aspiration has gone from a challenge to a heavy lift to a fool’s mission. Fewer young people actively listen to the radio as formats targeting teens and even twentysomethings have become rarities. In a world where 25-54 year-olds are the currency, teen-focused radio is a non-starter for virtually every U.S. company.\n\nSo while radio continues to focus on this 30-year adult target, Gen Z has gotten the message: precious little radio is geared toward them. And they know it. This isn’t the total reason why they’ve gravitated to Spotify, TikTok, YouTube, and videogames. But the radio industry has simple let them go, disinterested in stations that cater to Generation Z.\n\nThe demographics tell radio’s story vividly and persuasively. The population actively listening to the radio is aging, and the trend appears to be irreversible. There are no simple solutions.\n\nBut one thing that would decidedly be a step in the right direction is to encourage bright, young, educated people to seek careers in radio. Yesterday, I highlighted a wonderful example of what this looks like. The Globe, the radio station owned by Goshen College is doing it right – grooming and training young aspiring broadcasters for careers in radio. “The Breakfast Blend” hosted by Amelia Lee and an ensemble cast represents the best of college radio. The great news is there are more than 440 college radio stations in the U.S. and Canada where thousands of young people are learning the craft. They need support, encouragement, and financial assistance.\n\nThis has been a prominent topic on this blog, but I believe we’ve reached an inflection point. I’ve written about the value of supporting fledgling young radio wannabes. I talk about it every time I give a speech or presentation where I can weave it in.\n\nAnd earlier this year, I decided this isn’t enough. I need to walk the walk, the only way things truly get done.\n\nA few weeks later, I found the solution while reading a number of the industry trades. It was a press release from the College Radio Foundation, run by Dr. Rob Quicke and his wife, Lori. Rob is a college professor by day at William Patterson University in New Jersey, and a supporter of college radio 24/7.\n\nRob (pictured with some guy) has an impressive resume, graduating from Oxford, and has served both as talent and program director at radio stations in England, as well as in Chicago at WXAV, Saint Xavier University’s station.\n\nThe press release promoted “Vinylthon” on Saturday, April 23. It intentionally coincides with Record Store Day, a celebration of vinyl that began back in 2007. Seven years ago, the CRF began “Vinylthon,” a fundraiser that encourages college radio stations to play all-vinyl that Saturday. Rob’s press release announced an expansion of “Vinylthon” to include commercial radio stations – for a fee of $99.\n\nTo me, this made all the sense in the world, but in the ensuing days, I heard no one in commercial or public radio talking about it. When I brought up “Vinylthon” in conversations, awareness was foggy, at best.\n\nThat’s when I reached out to Rob, who I’ve interviewed on past College Radio Day celebrations. After speaking with him about his organization, its goals for “Vinylthon,” and his deep, long held commitment to college radio and the students who make it happen, Jacobs Media went all in.\n\nWe are now official partners with the College Radio Foundation for “Vinylthon 2022.” And we even have a board seat to bring whatever we can to this all-important table. Rob, Lori, and their mates are committed to this cause. And so are we.\n\nSo, here’s the ask.\n\nWe’re encouraging all music stations in the U.S. and Canada (as well as from around the world) to sign up for “Vinylthon.” This includes commercial, public, and Christian stations.\n\nOn the Jacobs Media website, we’ve listed several promotional tie-ins for Saturday, April 23. Of course, playing vinyl all day is the ideal – and the move that not only draws maximum attention to this great cause.\n\nWe’ve seen time and again that vinyl resonates with people of all ages. It is perceived as authentic and the original music format. We’ve seen it draw ratings for radio stations that play it for special features and weekends, as well as benchmark bits – like Pierre Robert’s “Vinyl Cut,” heard every day on WMMR in Philadelphia at 2:15 PST (Pierre Standard Time).\n\nIf you can’t drag a turntable or two into the studio next month or you’d rather just make a contribution on behalf of your station, you can do that, too. All funds raised go directly to Vinylthon Scholarship program, dedicated to helping students survive the high costs of higher education.\n\nVinyl, as you probably know, has been the music industry’s “comeback kid” these past several years. A new reveal from our yet-to-be-released Techsurvey 2022 shows that more than one in three (36%) respondents now own a turntable. And many more likely perceive vinyl as being cool. Thanks to liner notes and album art, vinyl has long served as the source of music storytelling, and an expression of one’s taste in music.\n\nBack when I worked with Dave Beasing at the Sound in L.A. with the “Backstagers” – our brand advocate group of loyal listeners – I always enjoyed this photo of the group holding up their favorite albums as an expression of their love for the music.\n\nYou get sign your station up at here.\n\nOur list of promotional tie-ins and other info is here.\n\nRob is a terrific interview. You can email him here.\n\nAnd if you have any questions or you want to chat about it, email me.\n\nYou haven’t heard the last from me about “Vinylthon” and why it matters not just to thousands of college kids and their student stations, but to the welfare and future of the radio broadcasting industry in the U.S., Canada, and beyond.\n\nNot enough Gen Z’s view radio as a viable career path, much less as a core entertainment and information source. By supporting the best, brightest, and highly motivated from this large group of young consumers, you’re making an important statement about what matters today – and for radio’s future.\n\nWe want to get commercial, public, and Christian radio involved, along with the music industry, of course.\n\nSign your station up for “Vinylthon” for that small fee of only $99 and be a part of it. Or if you’d rather just make a donation to the effort, you can do that, too.\n\nIt’s time to stop talking about why kids don’t care about radio.\n\nIt’s time to walk the walk."
