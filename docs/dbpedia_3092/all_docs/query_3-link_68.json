        "text": "Essential Question\n\nHow did Dewey Phillips and Hunter Hancock help bring Rhythm and Blues music to mixed race audiences?\n\nOverview\n\nThroughout much of the 20th century, African Americans engaged in the “Great Migration” moved from the rural South to points north, often urban centers. Their presence in cities from Memphis to Chicago and New York would have a profound impact on American culture in general, and on radio programming in particular.\n\nAfrican-American audiences were eager to hear music performed by African-American artists, particularly the new Rhythm and Blues sounds that had begun to emerge from earlier Blues and Jazz styles. In 1949, WDIA in Memphis hired a team of African-American disc jockeys and began gearing programming entirely toward African-American audiences, with R&B and Blues at its heart. In some cases, it was white disc jockeys who championed this music, playing it on radio stations that would bring together black and white audiences.\n\nThis lesson will focus on two of those DJs: Memphis’s Dewey Phillips, whose popular show “Red Hot and Blue” frequently featured music by African-American artists, and Los Angeles’s Hunter Hancock, widely regarded as the first DJ in the western part of the country to regularly play R&B on the air. Reaching both black and white audiences, these pioneering DJs played an integral role in bringing African-American music into the mainstream, a process that lay at the heart of the soon-to-come Rock and Roll revolution.\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nUpon completion of this lesson, students will:\n\nKnow (knowledge):\n\nThe cultural impact on 20th century American life of the Great Migration of African Americans to northern cities\n\nThe growing desire of radio stations to market programming to the new urban African-American population\n\nThe pioneering role of disc jockeys Dewey Phillips (Memphis) and Hunter Hancock (Los Angeles) in playing Rhythm and Blues on the radio\n\nBe able to (skills):\n\nUse a variety of sources to write an original script for a radio broadcast\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\n1. Distribute Handout 1 – Map of the United States, and display the map on the board. Ask if students can identify why some states are shaded in blue and others in red. (Note to instructor: This is a map reflecting the divisions of the Civil War era: the states in dark red seceded and became part of the Confederacy before April 15, 1861, and those in light red seceded and joined the Confederacy after that date; those in blue remained part of the Union; those in yellow were Union states that allowed slavery; and those in grey were territories that had not yet become states.)\n\n2. Using a classroom atlas or online research, ask students to label the following cities: Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; St. Louis, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Washington, D.C. Discuss as a class:\n\nIn what parts of the country are these cities located?\n\nWhich part of a divided country would they have been in during the Civil War?\n\n3. Ask students to describe life for African Americans in the American South after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and the end of the Civil War in 1865. Ask them to discuss the institutions of sharecropping and the culture of Jim Crow, in particular. If students are not firmly grounded in this material, guide them through these topics, offering explanation where needed.\n\n4. Distribute Handout 2 – African-American Population of Select Cities and display on the board. Make sure students understand that the table shows African Americans as a percentage of the overall population in 1920 and 1960. Discuss as a class:\n\nAs a general trend, what was happening to the African-American populations in these cities? How significant were the changes?\n\nWhere were these African Americans most likely coming from?\n\nWhat might have been some of the reasons they went to these cities? Why would they go to urban areas? (Note to instructor: You may again want to discuss both Jim Crow laws and customs and the lasting impact of sharecropping as aspects of Southern life affecting African Americans.)\n\nHow do you imagine the increase in the African-American population influenced life in these cities? How do you imagine it influenced popular culture in particular? (Note to instructor: Be sure to discuss briefly that even when they remained in the South, many African Americans relocated from rural to urban areas in this period. This point will be further emphasized in the readings.)\n\nProcedure:\n\nDivide students into pairs or small groups of 3-4. Explain that each group will work together to write a script for a ten-minute radio show that explores the impact of the growing African-American population on American cities in the 1940s and 1950s, focusing on radio programming. Their scripts will focus specifically on the influence of two disc jockeys in the late 1940s and 1950s — Memphis’ Dewey Phillips and Los Angeles’ Hunter Hancock — and the kind of music they played. In order to write their scripts, they will discuss a series of readings and short video clips.\n\nDistribute Handout 3 – Resources for This Lesson. (Required video: Roy Brown’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight,” Hunter Hancock’s “Huntin’ with Hunter,” Dewey Phillips’ “Red, Hot and Blue,” the radio interview “Dewey Phillips on Air with Jerry Lee Lewis,” and Ruth Brown’s “Teardrops from my Eyes.”) The readings include background on:\n\nThe Great Migration\n\nThe rise of Rhythm and Blues in the 1940s\n\nWDIA Memphis, the nation’s first African-American radio station\n\nMemphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips\n\nLos Angeles disc jockey Hunter Hancock\n\nAllow students sufficient time to review and discuss the material in the handout. If students do not have access to individual computers, play the videos for the class as a whole.\n\nDistribute Handout 4: How to Write Your Radio Script. Go over the instructions with the class as a whole.\n\nAllow students sufficient time to prepare their scripts, which will be turned in at the end of the class.\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nDiscuss:\n\nHow did the growing African-American population in American cities in the postwar period influence the kinds of music played on the radio?\n\nWhat is a disc jockey? Why do radio stations have them?\n\nWhat role can disc jockeys play in determining what music listeners hear?\n\nWhat specific role did Dewey Phillips and Hunter Hancock play in exposing white audiences to new kinds of music in the late 1940s and early 1950s?\n\nSome historians have suggested that the work of Phillips and Hancock and other DJs like them marked an important step in moving the country toward racial integration. Do you agree or disagree? Why?\n\nWriting Prompt:\n\nHow did the work of disc jockeys Dewey Phillips and Hunter Hancock reflect changes in American society in the 1940s and early 1950s?\n\nExtension:\n\nHave students perform and/or record their radio scripts. Play them for the class, or perhaps broadcast them on a school or local radio station.\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – Outline Map of the United States Handout 2 – African-American Population of Select Cities Handout 3 – Resources for This Lesson Handout 4 – How to Write Your Radio Script\n\nStandards\n\nNew Jersey State Standards\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Reading\n\nNJSLSA.R1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nNJSLSA.R7: Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats, including visually and quantitatively, as well as in words.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Writing\n\nNJSLSA.W3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\n\nNJSLSA.W8: Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources, assess the credibility and accuracy of each source, and integrate the information while avoiding plagiarism.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Language\n\nNJSLSA.L4: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Speaking and Listening\n\nNJSLSA.SL5: Make strategic use of digital media and visual displays of data to express information and enhance understanding of presentations.\n\nNew York State Standards\n\nNew York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards\n\nReading Anchor Standards\n\nKey Ideas and Details\n\nStandard 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly/implicitly and make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nIntegration of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 7: Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats.\n\nWriting Anchor Standards\n\nText Types and Purposes\n\nStandard 2: Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.\n\nStandard 3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective techniques, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\n\nResearch to Build and Present Knowledge\n\nStandard 7: Gather relevant information from multiple sources, assess the credibility and accuracy of each source, and integrate the information in writing while avoiding plagiarism.\n\nSpeaking and Listening\n\nPresentation of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 4: Present information, findings, and supporting evidence so that listeners can follow the line of reasoning.
