Students on the station’s executive staff hold the same professional positions as that of a commercial radio station.\n\n107.7 The Bronc now broadcasts two radio stations from our new, digital broadcast studios to provide more learning opportunities for our students. 107.7 The Bronc Retro WRRC2, is Rider University's super oldies student-run online radio station. We go back in the day, every day, playing classic hits from the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s!\n\nBroadcasting over the airwaves and online, Rider’s radio station, 107.7 The Bronc, provides a creative outlet for nearly 100 students each year and produces some of the campus’ biggest and most popular events such as the Halloween drive-in movie and trunk-or-treat Scream Screen, the car giveaway at graduation, Cruisin’ from Commencement, and the springtime Eggscellent Egg Hunt where students search on the Campus Mall for an egg containing a grand prize of a $1,000 gift card.\n\nThe station also sponsors the popular Rider Student Top Chef and Dessert Wars cooking contests and has broadcasted live from the Philadelphia Auto Show and the Philadelphia Flower Show. During men’s and women’s basketball games, the station’s Launch-A-Bronc charity promotion has raised more than $25,000 to-date for cancer-related charities."
