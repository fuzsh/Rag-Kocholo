        "text": "Surprised how many.\n\nBarry Manilow, Olivia Newton John and the Captain and Tennile come to mind. They were so omnipresent in my youth.\n\nAnd I think I have heard more young Americana artists sing \"A Change is Gonna Come \", than actually heard Sam Cooke on the radio in the last 10 years.\n\nHave oldies stations gone all classic rock then? Even the likes of Rare Earth and Grand Funk I tend to think of as classic rock instead of oldies. I think of oldies as being largely pop from the 1950s and 60s with a lot of pre-Beatles (Four Seasons, Buddy Holly, Motown, Beach Boys, Elvis, doowop, Petula Clark, Lesley Gore and the like), and classic rock being more rock and hard rock such as Led Zep, Boston, AC/DC and of course Eagles and Tom Petty. But radio station formats do change over time.\n\nIt's funny, when I was a kid in the mid-'80s, Billy Joel was having current hits on Top 40 -- and the big oldies station here played stuff from the '50s and early '60s. Strictly pre-Beatles stuff. Shortly before that same local oldies station went off the air in the early 2000s, I remember hearing \"Uptown Girl\" on it and being really freaked out.\n\nWe only have one solid oldies station that I can find, but it's a great one! Lots of 50's and 60's when I'm typically in the car. In the mid-oughts it even played 30's and 40's overnight, but I don't know if it still does. Owned by a local public school system 88.7 WFOS\n\nI wish someone would craft a “deep-cut oldies” station where you could hear, say, “That Makes It Tough” by Buddy Holly or “Western Ford Gateway” by Elton John, instead of hearing their top 3 hits for the zillionth time.\n\nMaybe there is one, and I just don’t know about it.\n\nWCBS-FM in New York used to play the best 50s music back in the 1980s. That was considered the definitive “oldies decade” for a long time.\n\nI loved listening to the Doo-Wop show on Sunday nights way back when. To me, that kind of music exemplified what oldies music was about. Nowadays I’m not sure where you can find that type of music on the airwaves.\n\nWhile we have a really good oldies FM station here in the Milwaukee area, the one SONG they\n\nnever play (and probably nowhere else) is Ray Stevens' \"Ahab The Arab\". But yet it's a hilarious\n\nrecording with Ray doing all of the voices. Of course, it's probably no linger considered PC,\n\nbut it should still get played. A perfect early sixties novelty record.\n\nWCBS screwed up when they fired all their legendary DJs for a computerized one, then when that didn't work they went to a boring generic \"all the hits from the 60s-80s\" format.\n\nAlso WMTR AM used to play all the crooner stuff from the 50s etc. but they too went generic.\n\nI'm glad to see Cousin Brucie return to WABC AM on Saturday nights, and WOR AM now has a program hosted by Joe Piscopo that plays Sinatra and Dean Martin songs on Sunday nights."
