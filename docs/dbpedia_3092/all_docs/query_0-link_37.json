        "text": "Over the years, officers have cultivated their own language, using phrases that only those in law enforcement would understand; check out our list to see if you’re current on your police jargon\n\nDo you ever wonder how coded police talk came about?\n\nWell, radios back in the day were anything but hi-fi, and few agencies had more than one channel to use. There were a lot of static and garbled transmissions. Air time was precious. In an effort to break through the interference, many agencies adopted brevity codes that were easily understood. Many codes started with a hard consonant, like “T,” to add punch to the spoken phrase. Some codes, such as “10-4,” made their way into the general lexicon through their use on TV shows like “Highway Patrol” and pop radio songs such as “Convoy.”\n\nAlthough there are now plenty of radio channels available, today’s officers still use these codes to keep communication succinct and somewhat secret to the public. Over the years, officers have also cultivated their own language, using certain phrases that only law enforcement officers would understand.\n\nBelow are some common phrases, acronyms and slang terms commonly heard throughout an officer’s career. And because we know each department’s terms differ, email us the ones we missed and we’ll add them to the list.\n\nA\n\nAB: Member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang\n\nAFIS: Automated Fingerprint Identification System, usually pronounced “Ay-fiss”\n\nAgency: Law enforcement officer’s generic term for the officer’s employer\n\nALPR: Automated license plate recognition system – a fixed or vehicle-mounted set of cameras and computers that records the license plates and photos of vehicles that pass by it, and compares the license plate numbers to a “hot list” of stolen vehicles and vehicles associated with a fugitive\n\nAmateur night: New Year’s Eve\n\nAnkle jerk: Foot patrol officer\n\nASP: Trade name that has become generic for an expandable baton carried on an officer’s duty belt\n\nATL: Attempt to locate – a directive or request to find a missing or wanted person\n\nAW: Aryan Warrior – a prison gang similar to the Aryan Brotherhood\n\nB\n\nBAC: Spelled out in conversation – the blood alcohol content of a person, usually an accused drunk driver\n\nBack up (two meanings): A unit assisting or “backing up” the primary unit on a call for service;
