        "text": "Radio station in Asbury Park, New Jersey\n\nWOBM (1310 kHz) is an adult contemporary AM radio station serving southern Monmouth and northern Ocean County, New Jersey. Licensed to Asbury Park, its studios are located in Toms River and its transmitter is in Tinton Falls. The station is owned by Townsquare Media.\n\nThe station began in 1926 as WDWM in Newark; it moved to Asbury Park as WCAP (for City of Asbury Park) in 1928.[2] In 1950, the station was purchased by the Asbury Park Press and renamed WJLK[2] as a sister station to WJLK-FM, which the newspaper placed on the air on November 20, 1947. The stations emphasized news coverage, using the paper's resources to produce 15-minute newscasts at the top of each hour, and a wide variety of programs including various types of music, talk and interviews.\n\nIn 1989, the newspaper sold the two stations to Devlin and Ferrari Broadcasting Company of New York for $12.5 million. The ownership changed again and during the time between the sale by the Press and the present day, various formats were tried, including oldies, big band music and country.\n\nThe station held the WJLK call sign until November 4, 1996, and was called WADB from that date until September 18, 2008.[3]\n\nOn June 25, 2007, WADB became a full-time ESPN Deportes Radio affiliate, broadcasting sports programming in Spanish. Six months later, in January 2008, it became a Fox Sports Radio affiliate and adopted the slogan \"National Sports with a Shore View\". WADB mostly broadcast Fox Sports Radio programming. The station also broadcasts Lakewood BlueClaws minor league baseball along with sister station WOBM.\n\nMillennium Radio renamed the station WBUD on September 18, 2008, before changing the name back to WADB on June 4, 2009.[3]\n\nOn September 3, 2010, WADB changed its format to oldies, simulcasting WOBM. Both stations continue to broadcast Lakewood BlueClaws minor league baseball and play-by-play of high school sports. On May 19, 2014, WADB changed its format news/talk.[4] On January 3, 2017, WADB returned to an oldies format, branded as \"Beach Radio\".[5]\n\nOn February 1, 2022, at 10 am, after playing \"Thunder Road\" by Bruce Springsteen, WADB changed its format from oldies to country, branded as \"Cat Country 96.7/104.1\", with the first song being \"Cold as You\" by Luke Combs. The \"Cat Country\" branding was shared with Atlantic City sister station WPUR.[6]\n\nOn July 10, 2023, WADB dropped the country format and began simulcasting the adult contemporary format of WOBM-FM, expanding that station's coverage of Monmouth County; the format change also ended the simulcast with WOBM AM, which began simulcasting WJLK.[7] The \"Cat Country Jersey Shore\" website was then redirected to the WPUR website.[8] WADB's call sign was changed to WOBM on July 31, 2023.[9]\n\nFacility details for Facility ID 14895 (WOBM) in the FCC Licensing and Management System\n\nWOBM in Nielsen Audio's AM station database\n\nFCC History Cards for WOBM\n\nFM translator"
