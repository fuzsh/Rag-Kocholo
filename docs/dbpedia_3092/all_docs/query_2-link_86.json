        "text": "Bert Baron\n\nThe RNJ Morning Program – Weekdays: 5:30AM – 10:00AM\n\nA native of northwest New Jersey, Bert returns to RNJ after more than 2 decades in Garden State radio, and he’s excited to be back home! In fact, RNJ was one of the first radio stations Bert worked at in the late 1990s. Since then, he has built a distinguished and celebrated career in broadcasting and media as a host, writer and producer. He has volunteered countless hours in support of numerous New Jersey non-profits and charitable organizations. For his efforts both off and on-air, Bert was inducted in the New Jersey Broadcasters Association’s Radio Hall of Fame in 2016, and was nominated for a prestigious MARCONI Award from the National Association of Broadcasters in 2017. He is the recipient of more than a dozen JERSEY Awards from the New Jersey Advertising Club, including “Best of Radio” in 2016.\n\nBert is also the host and co-producer of the B•Inspired Podcast Series which tells the story of exceptional people who have overcome tremendous adversity to inspire others to do the same.\n\nBert lives in Califon with his wife Karen and their 4 adopted shelter cats, Sunny, Merci, Samson and Nellie.\n\nClick here for Bert Baron Audio On Demand\n\nIn Memoriam – Chuck Reiger (1951-2023)\n\nFor 37 years, Chuck served as our Program-, Production- and Music Director.\n\nHe was the architect of our station’s unique sound and was a wizard in the production studio. Chuck’s expertise and on-air wit is sorely missed.\n\nGreta Latona\n\nRNJ Afternoon Drive – Weekdays: 3:00PM – 7:00PM\n\nIt’s Greta Latona and just like you, I love music, all music and I talk, to everyone. I’m a graduate of Felician University with a Medical Degree – which led me to a Broadcasting Career. I know that sounds odd, but after medicine I went back to study broadcasting with the intention that there was so much information and advances in health screenings and somehow that information needed to get to the public.\n\nSo with that, I got a job working on commercials, copy writing, and production and voicing community events, which lead to an ON AIR job. Now, I could guide people to blood drives, tell them about community fundraisers and fun events in the area and play great music along the way.\n\nThis is my American Dream. While working ON AIR at WGHT Radio and as the Assistant Program Director, I have implemented programs in the community that brought in 13 Crystal Radio nominations from the NAB. I have received awards from the Garden State Journalist Association for ON AIR Interviews with celebrity recording artists and our “call-in-contests” were recognized too. Rounding out a list of awards in my career included Marconi Award honors and a New York Air Award.\n\nI’ve had a Morning Café Show, a Big Band Show, a Christian Show, and for over 11 years a Co-host of a Morning Show in the NYC market. I’ve been both backstage and on-stage as an MC to some of the greatest events. I’m a musician, have a DJ entertainment company, and have read at every family’s wedding in the tri -state. I’ve done countless voiceover work in commercials for Cars, Broadway Shows, and the businesses in your hometown. I’m a dabbler. I love classic cars and long-drives in scenic areas. I’m just like you, I work, I shop, and I’ll roll up my sleeves to help when needed. I’m the easiest person on the planet to work or be around. Oh, and I love animals. I have a Chihuahua that’s 4.5 pounds named Dasher. Yes, after the Reindeer.\n\nDave Kelber\n\nSaturday Mornings – Saturdays: 5:30AM – 10:00AM\n\nWRNJ News – Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays & Weekends: 10:00AM – 7:00PM\n\nDave Kelber has been with WRNJ for over 25 years as a show host and newscaster.
