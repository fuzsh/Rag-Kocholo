All you do is tune in to your favorite station and your HD Radio receiver will automatically lock in to the HD1 signal for that station. One notch over on the dial and youâ€™re listening to entirely new content on the HD2 station. Additionally the digital signal provides on-screen information such as: album art, song info, traffic and weather."
