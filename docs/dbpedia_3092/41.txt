Hi everyone,

I'm curious what radio station, or other media, you obtain your traffic reports from for central and northern NJ? I've been using 101.5 for years but I can't really bear the broadcasting anymore. Anyone use any other station? 880 on the AM seems to be alright, but not as thorough. Any ideas?

Thanks!

511nj.org is the most comprehensive online service I've found. Between the Incidents List and the Bridge and Tunnel Times, along with the Cameras List, I prefer it to waiting for a reading of the same information.

If I'm stuck on the road, then I'll use Sirius 148 for NYC and 149 for Philadelphia.
