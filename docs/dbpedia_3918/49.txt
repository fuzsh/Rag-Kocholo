An eight-episode show, ‘Sweet Kaaram Coffee’ on an ‘unforgettable journey’ three women from different generations undertake, will stream on Amazon Prime Video from July 6. This new Tamil original series, which is billed as a ‘road trip drama’, stars actors Madhoo (‘Roja’ fame), veteran actor Lakshmi and Santhy.

Created by writer-producer Reshma Ghatala, (‘Neethaane En Ponvasantham’ and ‘Enai Noki Paayum Thota’), the series is about a road journey three women take and how it rekindles their love for life, and they discover the sweet-and-fulfilling scent of self-reliance and self-discovery.

Ghatala called ‘Sweet Kaaram Coffee’ a “fresh, lighthearted, urban family drama”.

“It befittingly exemplifies the real life bonds between members of a family; the disagreements, the affection, the disappointments and the reconciliations, that make it evermore relatable and truly entertaining,” she said.
