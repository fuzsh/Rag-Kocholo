        "text": "I wanted to put this up on New Year’s Day but what’s the point writing just for the sake of releasing on the day that you want to, rather than feeling nostalgic about it. Sometimes the full stop excites you more than a fresh start. Year end is something like that to me. Even though a part of me feels bad for getting older. I like the feeling of ticking off the lists in a stipulated time. It must be more of year end celebration than a New Year celebration.\n\nEver since rain and postponement of guitar exam my schedule was spoilt. I’m a man who lives by time table. It was very tough for me to cope up with six day week, to shift plans that I had for Saturdays and work pressure and personal problems etc.\n\nBut now when I’m writing this on a Saturday Jan the 2nd, a couple of days after watching Premam the second time and in a better frame of mind I feel content. In fact before I typed the word content I typed ‘happy’ but erased and made it to ‘content’. I guess I’ll never be happy again. Happiness has become more or less a myth to me. Like how I accepted the job that I don’t like, as my career and how I will accept the wife whom I’m going to marry as my better half even though I won’t like her, I’ll also get used to the fact that I can’t be happy anymore.\n\nThis could be one of my best articles. I could feel that. I just watched the part where Nivin Pauly cries for Malar. I used that scene as a catalyst to increase my emotion.\n\nI’ll jolt down the top 11 things of the year. Might be good or bad, I could even have left something very important but at this point this is what I feel like writing and this is how it goes.\n\n11. Guitar – The one thing I’m not at all able to master, let alone mastering, I’m not even able to play decently. Worst was the final intermediate exam was postponed. Otherwise I’d have at least been happy that I’m in advanced stage. But one good thing is I got distinction for the first time by scoring 91 in the 4th grade exam. What’s even better was I went to office that day as it was John’s last day so I didn’t even had to take leave. Even though things didn’t turn according to the plan the day went on well.\n\n10. Wishing friends on their birthday – I made it a point that I’d be wishing my best friends at the stroke of midnight by being with them. It so happened that I could go with liquor for both Lokesh and Arun’s birthday. Vimal being onsite wasn’t in my list but Jeeva I could have met even though he likes aging more than birthday. Happy 27 dude. Sorry that I couldn’t make it on your birthday.\n\n9. Lights On – Ever since the performance on stage by Tabula Rasa I was on a high. Start of year was epic for me. Lights On happened at that time. What I thought would take only me to function, crushed my ego and told me how important a team is. And what a team we are. Jeeva once said after observing in another group formed by some of the core members, “ennada elarum ipdi irukanga.” I was like, “epdi enga alunga. Tharu mara?”\n\n8. Short film – I wanted to make a short film and had taken a resolution that I wouldn’t watch a movie till I make one. I did the same. For first four months of the year I hadn’t watched a single movie. I made a short film, not something to be so proud of but quite curiously got more than 50 likes for the video. May be people felt pity for me or they liked it I don’t know. I should thank Ramya for accepting the role because it is close to real life and one way of indirectly proposing to her. I love all my heroines and she’s the first one. Hope my honesty doesn’t offend you.\n\n7. Tabula Rasa – When I thought that I’ve lost everything after Jeeva quitting company and going through a breakup phase this happened. We all bonded and like how? As much as I hate the name, I love the people in it. It has become our identity. And the way with which they respect me is phenomenal. Feels so good to be part of a gang where people think that you make sense. I’ve been the most honest and most brutal with this group. All the outings, be it OK Kanmani, Premam, Night outs, parties and especially Palakkad trip were special. There was a moment after Soma and I came out of water. Everyone were sitting around the pool and experiencing something. What I thought, to be something that people came out of my compulsion had become Nirvana to them. It was so happy to see them like that.\n\n6. Ladakh – What to say about is. It was two years of hard work. Pitch perfect planning, which is something that I could be proud of. Even though I had decided that I would go to Ladakh on 2015 I don’t know whether I would have been able to complete it without my fellow riders. Just like that while waiting for my Ghee Karam I met Bhuvanesh and told about this plan and he introduced me to Parthi who in turn pulled in his gang for the trip. Bhuvanesh had to drop out due to his exams but icing on the cake was John joining it. You need to have at least one best friend when you do a tour of your life time. He was my dream catcher in Ladakh. And what amazing people I met. Antoine became such a nice friend and I’m quite impressed with Siva, whom I thought to be a nagging girlfriend riding as Fahad’s pillion but when I see the quotes shared by her and the thoughts put up in face book in addition to her photography skills I look in awe. What a talent. There was a moment when Parthi lost his break shoes and felt bad about it. For me it was the moment of Ladakh. I like people who feel guilty. It was so human!\n\n5. Karthik concert with family – This has to go into the list. What I thought I’m going to do with my drama gang became a family outing thanks to the last minute cancellation of plan by Smitha. And boy how did they enjoy the show. I sat in the middle between by dad and mom. The way they were smiling and replying for the questions that he put up to the audience, I was flabbergasted. Ever since he gave a reprise of ‘Aha mella nada’ we never fail to miss it whenever it appears in TV. What a talent.\n\n4. Book, Review shared by Rajat Kapoor– I never thought this would go so down in my list. I think people who are reading or people who are at least interested to know the list and know me would have thought that this would be at the top of the list. I could put it at no.1 but who am I cheating. The book is a failure. It’s time to accept that. As soon as it got released I thought people would throng to buy it. I’ll collect profit within Infy itself. There was an article by my publisher about how to sell first 100 copies. I was laughing at it thinking. 100 copies would be a piece of cake. Now I know what it is to sell the book. There were things that I didn’t like which I did for the book. I didn’t like the way I persisted few to buy books, I didn’t like the way I talked about the book as soon as I said ‘hi’ to someone. I didn’t like the way many were compelled to buy the book just because I shouldn’t feel bad. Sorry I would keep that in mind while I publish my next book. I don’t want to be a guy who sells books like Tupperware next time. But above all when there are numerous people who still think, “I should write a book” or “I should have written a book”. Here I’m with a book with absolutely no compromise from cover to cover. How many can claim that? Like how Alex and Vimal said, “book elam ezuthirukae, ithelam ena china vishiyama.” It indeed is big.\n\nIn terms of writing there was a review by Ankhon Dekhi which Rajat Kapoor, the director himself starred and retweeted in his account. That was a lovely feeling.\n\n3. Women in my life – Now this is a curious topic. I thought I’d put up a whole new article about it on women’s day but as this year marked few memorable moments with my female friends I’ll jolt it down here. Before the year the only female friend whom I was close with was Sushrita. But this year I got Aruna, Smitha and Kavya to be my friends. The problem with me is that I fall in love with every women I befriend. It stayed true even here, at least one half in the list.\n\nSushrita – We lost touch post our Infy bench days but your marriage paved way for one more unplanned family trip of the year. It was even the more special as you made me travel on the day of my birthday.\n\nAruna – Even though you don’t let me sleep at least till Sholinganallur toll gate in the morning it was pleasure to ‘put scene’ in front of you talking about all my travel deeds and you would be so proud talking about me to someone else. As soon as I get philosophical you just nod, not understanding anything but still it was kind of sweet. I think I’m missing you the most in bus. Even though I could sleep more and read more I’m missing my confession moments in bus.\n\nSmitha – I think I’ve behaved as the most irritating bastard to you. I also think that you’ve got some very good moments with me. May be you might have had better moments than the best moments that we had together but still it qualifies as the best to me. In spite of having innumerable friends and treating me as a close friend made me special. For most part of the year, it was you on whom I took it on. Thank you for being my rag picker and sorry for how I’m behaving today.\n\nKavya – J I know you don’t like PDWA (Public Display of Wordly Affection). Sorry for tagging you. If I had done it on 31st I’d have been able to kept my promise of not disturbing you much this year but sorry for the delay. It’d be the last time that I’m tagging you. I’ll post the rest in your inbox. I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable. Ping me once you finish reading the article.\n\nI don’t think I have it in me to befriend anymore female friends for I don’t make friends, I become friends. I’m over and out with this aspect. Next is only going to my unhappy marriage.\n\n2. Rains and Politics – It not only wreaked havoc in Chennai. It wreaked havoc in my life too. Expect for the amazing food that Ramesh’s mother gave and the travel back home the next day, the after effects were a pretty too serious. I started hating politicians after watching few stupid interviews. There was one guy saying, “mazai vantha uyir poga than seyum, athunala ena pana mudiyum.” I felt like castrating him. Motherfucker. I have never been much involved in welfare or politics but this time it made me angry. Stopped watching the news channels post that. Don’t know it was because of the rain or because of my personal depression. That period was hell for me.\n\n1. Tennis – This is one thing I learnt new this year. I’m happy that I could do at least one new thing per year. But like you, even I didn’t expect this to be no. 1 but I can’t forget the moment. I’m naturally good when it comes to sports. Only football I missed to play. A couple of months back when we were playing a tough doubles match there was a powerful shot to the left of me. I ran in front and hit a backhand straight court shot with even more force and in motion. Whole court looked in awe. ‘What a shot’ claimed the coach. It was like the catch I took as a wicket keeper while defending 34 runs against big boys. I lost it there, I lost it here. I’m not very good in tennis but that one shot would summarize my year. If I make this year of mine into a film I’ll finish it with this like how Venkat Prabhu did with his Chennai – 28 where ball hits the screen. This is my fucking game. (Something totally unnecessary but felt like saying)\n\nEven though the year was quite productive it wasn’t an entirely happy one. I guess 2014 was. I hope some year down the line beats 2014 as the best year. For this year I have to complete a couple of exams in guitar and start playing songs, improve salsa, write the next book without self-publishing, shoot a better short film, shoot a song, increase skills in camera and learn post processing, complete the missed Tadiandamol trek and plan for Chadar. Life is busy and I like it that way. I don’t think I’ll make this year-end thing as a daily habit. I missed updating top 10 films, books list for the year which I always wanted to do. May be next year. Until then, Cya!\n\nIf Ladakh was there at the top of my all-time list of places to go. KP was at the top of my all-time list of treks to do. And I wanted to complete it by year end. To have achieved both by year end, I consider it phenomenal. Icing on the cake was with my trippers, for us this is our fourth trip together in four consecutive years. Everyone of it was a gem. If Tadiandamol had also happened I’d have been a happy man with respect to trips. But its fine, not everything we plan happens. Second lesson learnt after Spiti.\n\nDay 0 – Early check out, Day Train and Night Bus\n\nHow I love giving titles. For a second I feel like looking at the title and admiring myself. Thursday was just a formality in office. Raja and I went on by 10.50 AM train from Paranur. That’s when I switched on the net and gave last bit of instructions. Being the last trip of the year and not being in a good mood, it was quite a relaxing thing to start for the trip. Felt good giving last time instructions to others. That 1.5 hours in train just flew away. Raja as expected had packed too much of unnecessary items like bed sheets, pillow (yes believe it), formal shoes etc. and didn’t have any food items I had mentioned.\n\nBy the time we went to central it was 12.30 PM. Raja recommended to eat outside station and it was a wise choice. We had proper meals which would stay with us till night. Seena, Prasanna and Balaji, my regular trip mates were already there. Srinivasan whom I hadn’t known before that, too joined us. He was quiet for the most part.\n\nI made a conscious decision of taking no books, camera and headphones. We watched Padayappa in train, it was Sami last time when we travelled. With the trippers it’s like this. Once a year I text them asking whether they’d be okay for a particular plan and they’d be like ok or not ok within few hours. Whoever says ok doesn’t drop later. That’s quite a relief. With rest it’s not as simple as that, they get last minute plans, they have some errands to run etc. etc. but with this group, if it’s fixed its fixed.\n\nSo we caught up with all the untold stories, especially I got to hear their stories, I’m not quite a talker. Raja and Srini were getting quite bored but they managed well. We got to eat the Poori which Prasanna packed and slept and chatted and ridiculed and did everything that you do in a day train.\n\nOur train reached half an hour late, we quickly searched for restaurant to have dinner. I again had meals, rest of them had masala dosa, idly, veg biryani etc. One from Bangalore, Srikant had already reached the bus stand by 8.45 PM.\n\nOur bus was supposed to be at 10 PM and we reached the bus stand by 9.30 PM. Got info from Srikanth that Mohan and my friend Hari through which I knew the other two as well as Srini, too had got late. Bus started around 10.30 and luckily everyone reached, but after all the struggle.\n\nWhen we thought it was all over for the day, that’s when the real thing happened. Do you know how it feels to be on a roller coaster on road? No. you don’t know. But every one of us who were there in the bus would know it for sure.\n\nDay 1 – Lunch and lunch only\n\nWe reached the base camp on time, thanks to the maverick driver. I guess all expect Raja had a tough time sleeping. This time Raja beat me in sleeping. I’m the one who is known for sleeping long hours no matter what time it is or how difficult the position might be.\n\nAt 5.30 AM it was still dark, within half an hour we finished our morning ablutions, had tea (which is a must to start the day), brushed teeth, did warm up and went to temple (in the same order). Idly vada for rupees 35 per head at Neo Mysore Café took us through sun rise. One more reason to have had breakfast early morning was to have proper food because you never know what you get once you get into the woods.\n\nIdly vada gave us enough strength to do the initial bit of walking through the roads. Quite astonishing fact about this trek was none were too interested in taking photos. Yes there were selfies and snapshots but not photos. Thanks to the missing SLR, it saved a lot of time.\n\nAfter the initial 1.5 KM on road we entered the woods, the next 3 hours and around 6 KM were through woods. The group got split into two. Hari and Raja lead the first pack followed by Srikanth, Srini and Mohan. Balaji, Prasanna and Seena were in front of me. As I know these guys too like the back of my hand I was knowing what each one of them were going to do like how Tendulkar predicted an entire over before being bowled to Aamir Khan. As expected Prasanna was struggling initially. He has a starting problem. The first couple of hours it was very tough for him. But like always he managed to scrape through. Balaji was cheerful as usual, thanks to his sports shoes he didn’t have any problems initially. Seena was the surprise package this time. He started feeling dizzy after a while and threw up, thanks to electrol, which for me gave strength.\n\nOur first stop was at Bhatre Mane which we reached around 10.30. The first pack had reached there some half an hour before and had enquired details about not being allowed to pitch tents at the top. But I along with few went to forest office to confirm the same. Once confirming we decided that we’d spend the rest of the day there and pitch tent near the view point en route to forest office which was a splendid spot.\n\nOur initial plan was to pitch tents at KP top and do the descent next day. We could have done the same but as we weren’t allowed to pitch tents at the top we decided to stay at Bhatre Mane. Lunch was served at 11 AM. Rice, vegetable less sambar and I don’t know what to call it, water which you pour in the rice which doesn’t get over the previous day along with pickle. Best dish was water-which-you-pour-in-the-rice-which-doesn’t-get-over-the-previous-day.\n\nAs soon as we had food Hari and I got quite comfortable and started sleeping, that’s the advantage of travelling, all you need is a shade to sleep. After few minutes or hours or I don’t know how much time I slept. After a while, guys woke up saying they got space inside the hut to keep bags and sleep. Our next round of sleep started there which went for next two hours. We quite judiciously used the charger, multi plug of Good Samaritan to charge our phones. Around 2 PM we started getting bored and the only thing in my mind was, why not I eat again, after all I paid hundred rupees for lunch. I decided against it but had two glasses of water-which-you-pour-in-the-rice-which-doesn’t-get-over-the-previous-day.\n\nAt 3 PM Srikant said that people were settling near view point to pitch their tents. So Srikant and Hari went with their tent. As per forest officers advice we were allowed to pitch tents only post 6 PM but within an hour everyone started pitching their tents. By dawn the place was infested with tents. We went to view point to take few shots of sunset and went down to the hut for dinner by 7 PM thinking that the food would have got ready. To our horror we were informed that food would get ready only by 8.30 PM.\n\nSo we waited and waited and it became a commotion when we finally got our food. I filled my plate with ten cups of rice and five cups of sambar and what I thought to be water-which-you-pour-in-the-rice-which-doesn’t-get-over-the-previous-day was actually buttermilk by the end of the day. Only Raja, Seena, I and Prasanna were there to get that food. Rest all went back to their tents and settled with their bread and peanut butter.\n\nAfter satisfying dinner, did moon walk sometime followed by moon stare and moon sleep. Our plan was to get up at 4 AM the next day and start ascent by 5 AM. My aim was to reach Kumara Paravartha peak by 10 AM and start descent from there. Within an hour of sleep Balaji started complaining of lack of oxygen. But I wasn’t in a mood to answer. After a deep sleep I got up at 4 AM, only that everyone inside it were in different position compared to the previous night.\n\nDay 2 – Up, Up and Away\n\nThe scary second day began exactly at 4 AM. The fact that there was 6 more kilometers to climb and a 7 kilometer descent meant that we had to keep good pace. At 5 AM we started trekking in moon light and just like previous day the pack split into two. I had asked Hari and co to wait near Kallu Mantapa, our first official break point.\n\nThere were of course a lot of unprecedented breaks that we took but we reached Kallu Mantapa in about a couple of hours which was a decent pace but as soon as we reached the first group had started. I wanted to keep that as breakfast point but as the first pack had started it was us alone who gobbled up the cheese and bread and biscuits up there. Nothing like cheese in mountains. Of course Maggi is the best but unfortunately for us and fortunately for the nature there weren’t any shops.\n\nNext was the best part. From Kallu Mantapa our next designated stop was Shesha Paravartha peak which is considered the toughest trail in the trek. It was tough and steep alright but the factor which we didn’t consider was wind. Raja was right in saying that it was mentioned that we’ve to climb in certain degree but it hadn’t been mentioned that we had to walk in a slanted degree. It’s not funny when I type in English, it was when said in Tamil.\n\nDuring the mid-section of Shesha Paravartha was where we were literally crawling and in front of was Srini, sitting like dobby behind a rock asking us to go forward. Every time the wind got a bit less one by one got up and left to next rock. It was like soldiers trying to evade shells by passing from bunker to bunker.\n\nAt last there was only Srini left, he got up, wind came, he sat, again he got up, wind came and sat, finally he got up, wind was about to come and I shouted some random ailasa things and he went to the next rock. From then on, to the point where we all met up it we proceeded at snail’s pace.\n\nWe didn’t halt much at the end of Shesha Paravartha because it was only descent from there, that too through the woods which meant it was shadowy with less winds and steepness too wasn’t much. Except for a couple of boulders in route to Kumara Paravartha peak there wasn’t anything tough. We reached the peak at 11 AM. One hour later than my target but it was okay. We took photos, had food and relaxed for half an hour before the descent.\n\nIt was informed that from the base to Somwarpet the only bus was at 3.30 PM. We were trying for that and started from the peak at 11.30 AM. After a short detour of 100 meters we entered the path into forest for descent. This time Prasanna too joined Raja and joined the first pack. Seena had got fitter and expectedly Balaji had cramped his legs. It was a slow and relaxing walk from there on. There is a thing about this group. Generally when I’m around with people I tend to command a lot and have to think whether I said anything harsh but with them around I hardly think. I say what I want to say but I keep quiet for most of the time. It’s as if me walking alone. I think I should even thank them for slowing me down every time. Once I took a solo trek in Yelagiri and went to top in like some 1.5 hours. I was panting but I didn’t stop, I went on and on. That’s typical me. I don’t know when to control. Like how Sherlock needs a Watson to keep him sane, I need them to keep me calm, be happy.\n\nWe reached the base at 3 PM and got to know that from there to bus stop it was a four kilometer walk. We decided to take jeep ride after much thought. What was 1800 before got reduced to 1600 thanks to the bargaining skills of Raja.\n\nThe time waiting for jeep and in jeep were the best. We all had become friends, no regrets, no sad feeling. It was relaxing. I got a heavy feeling that Hari is going to join our travel gang from here on. I vazipari sold my books to the ones who hadn’t got. In jeep too I loved the ride sitting in front and then in back because it got Srikant dizzy.\n\nAs soon as we got down we had a heavy dinner at 6 PM in one of the so called good restaurant. We got to know that the first bus to Bangalore was at 8.30 PM. We decided to go by that after completing our evening ablutions. As Raja and Srini decided that they’d go by bus early next day I luckily was able to cancel tickets with my on and off net.\n\nDay 3 – Down, Down, Down\n\nI mean you don’t even have to read that. This is not going to give any knowledge if you are planning to trek or wouldn’t classify under any literary standard. But still I’ll write. I’m a selfish person who writes for me.\n\nAs we reached before sunrise we could sleep well. I took bath in warm water. What a pleasure it was to take a good hot shower and being in the wild for a coupla days. Had a good four hours sleep followed by awesome Kal Dosa Kara Kuruma in Military hotel.\n\nWe decided to go to ABC for its flavored beer but thanks to our luck there was some election that day so had to postpone it to evening. For lunch we again went to military hotel and feasted.\n\nPost our pub outing in the evening we went to station well in advance. Not before downloading at least five old movies of Rajni and Kamal from free Wi-Fi. Thanks to the late train we waited in station for half an hour and slept as soon as we got it.\n\nIt was a very satisfying feeling to have completed the trek which I always wanted to have got a potential travel partner and a group of friends. Thank you everyone who made this trip a wonderful experience. See you soon."
