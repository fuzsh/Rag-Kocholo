        "text": "From ideal to rebel to object‚Ä¶.. What‚Äôs next?\n\n‚ÄúI hate to hear you talk about all women as if they were fine ladies instead of rational creatures. None of us want to be in calm waters all our lives.‚Äù- Jane Austen\n\nDisclaimer: I am not one of the angry young Feminists üôÇ This is an end-to-end observation of the roles of Female Leads in Tamil Cinema by an objective film enthusiast!\n\nOver a period of time, Tamil movies have seen heroines take several stereotypical roles- it started with a princess falling for a poor disciple and a housewife whose world revolved around her family. Then with director Balachander at the helm we saw heroines becoming rebels, Bharathiraja turned them into village belles who in turn became social crusaders, and Balumahendra who was a master of complex relationships showcased women mixed with philandering partners/spouses. Then came the ‚ÄúBubbly Heroine‚Äù avatar, with the entry of fair skinned North Indian Heroines and their high pitched dubbed voices followed by the ‚Äòloosu ponnu‚Äô avatars with their love for rains, eating kulfi at midnight, and the hero falling at first sight of this loosu ponnu.\n\nWith the birth of Modern Woman, came a self-proclaimed feminist, who never stops questioning the wrong, confusing bold to smoking/drinking, and using profanity. She is unafraid to acknowledge the fact that physical intimacy/attraction does not equal love and clearly knows the distinction. She talks about her role not limited to procreating, but rather career oriented, and sometimes painted as man-hating, against marriages and labels, and finds men as untenable and so on.\n\nThe beginning:\n\nThe first film to focus exclusively and sympathetically on a woman‚Äôs liberation was Aval Appadithan (1978), directed by C. Rudhraiya which shook the Tamil Audience of its time and still remains a cult classic(esp with it starring both Kamal and Rajini). Manju is a young woman who works in an advertising company in Madras. As a result of an insecure childhood and early experience of betrayal in love, Manju is trying to fight her inner demons even while seeking a meaningful relationship with a man. Sexual roles, power struggle in family, workplace harassment, abuse, and consensual premarital sex were all discussed in a movie made four decades ago. The highlight of the movie is its climax where there is consistency in the character as she remains liberated, but also unapologetic about it. The final lines of the movie just serves as an irony in women‚Äôs liberation, even today. Manju asks another female character, ‚ÄúWhat is Women‚Äôs liberation,‚Äù and the character replies, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù for which Manju remarks, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you are happily married!‚Äù\n\nKB‚Äôs Era- Subversive yet Sacrificial\n\nAfter a wave of movies showing women as their ideal self- the Kannagis, or as someone who subordinated herself for the sake of her family, came the Balachander era that showcased the aspiration of women to be treated as individuals in their own right all the while struggling through their web of issues. KB‚Äôs Nootrukku Nooru(1970) dealt with sexual harassment, and movies like Aval oru thodarkathai (1974), Arangetram (1973), and Mandhil Urudhi Vendum (1987) dealt with the lead trying to support her large family at any cost. Arangetram handled a very sensitive subject of a Brahmin woman forced to take up prostituition and inturn,is shunned by her own family. Avargal (1977), Oru Veedu Iru Vasal (1992), 47 Natkal ( 1971), and Noolveli (1979) all dealt with women in abusive marriages.\n\nAlthough KB weaved strong women centric roles and created massive careers for those leading ladies and brought forward the topics that were a taboo and revolutionary at that time, his resoultions were: Compromise, Sacrifice, deemed not fit for marriage, suicide, or living alone. This makes me wonder, is this how KB saw women or is this how the society during that time wanted to see their women? Yes, KB gave all his leading ladies a profession, ‚Äúnimirntha nadai‚Äù, a woman of her own mind, intellectual independence, but do they all need to be sacrificial. I just wished KB gave wings to his heroines to fly and try to touch the sky‚Ä¶.\n\nMahendran‚Äôs Realism\n\nMahendran took center stage with trend setting movies like Mullum Malarum(1979) which showed an egoistic, over-possessive brother and how the lead settles in life without affecting her brother‚Äôs pride. Uthiripookal (1979) narrated a complicated psychological situation faced by a family and also the village and spoke about the sadistic lead torturing his wife, which remained a reflection of most women in rural India at that time. Metti (1982) is about a woman who has been abandoned by her husband, along with her two daughters. Metti presented the perspective of women who were unfairly subjected to expectations and the inequalities in the gender in society.\n\nAll the feminocentric movies of the 70‚Äôs and early 80‚Äôs presented the social issues, and the sufferings of the women with stark reality, however, they never interrogated the structure of the patriarchal society- the authority.\n\nBalumahendra‚Äôs Era- The intricacies between the female lead and the philanderer spouse/partner\n\nThe arrival of cinematographer-turned-filmmaker Balu Mahendra, beautifully packaged arthouse films in commercial format and explored complex relationships. Marupadiyum (1993), a remake of Mahesh Bhatt‚Äôs Arth(1982), is about a director leaving his very devoted wife, Thulasi (Revathi), for an actress. Thulasi at the wake of divorce befriends a very ‚Äònice guy‚Äô in every definition (Arvind Swami), who kick starts her life back. Husband goes through a realization, transforms, and comes back to Thulasi. She rejects him by asking, ‚ÄúIf I had an extramarital affair and then came back would you accept me?‚Äù Thulasi doesn‚Äôt accept the proposal of Arvind Swami either, stating she just wants to be Thulasi, and adopts a girl.\n\nSathi Leelavathi(1995) dealt with a similar theme, however, in this movie, Leela(Kalpana) schemes every possible way to win her husband back. While she utters the same dialogue as Thulasi, why does she desperately want to win back her husband who had an extramarital affair? Is it because Leela has 2 kids of her own,and she has to choose between the welfare of her children vs her own beliefs of right and wrong? It goes both ways to say that the society at large wanted to see a single mother‚Äôs partner to be only the ‚Äúfather of her children‚Äù and also how Balu Mahendra saw women. Philanderer is a common theme of Balumahendra‚Äôs movies Kokila (1977), Rettai Vaal Kuruvi (1987) and Olangal (1982) all dealt with extramarital affairs all have stronger women character arcs.\n\nBlurring the lines between subjective and objective views of Women Empowerment:\n\nDirector Ram‚Äôs Taramani‚Äôs(2017) main character Althea Johnson(Andrea) is a woman who is deemed single because her ex-husband realizes he is gay a little too late. Althea is a strong woman, a mother of a cute boy, holds a profession, has a mind of her own, smokes and drinks to forget her miseries, knows how to put the workplace sexual advances in its place by saying, ‚ÄúIts I who decides who I sleep with, not the man‚Äù, and clearly tells the protagonist that she is not looking into a life partner to direct her life. The hero Prabunath is from the opposite world of Althea, one moment he is as gentleman as he can be and says, ‚Äúnee sollala, naan kekkala‚Äù about her personal (past) life and the minute she is in a committed relationship with him, he becomes an anti-hero from KB days like Avargal, goes through her FB friends, questions her chastity, and she eventually breaks up with him. The guy in itself is shown to have several red flags like emotional abuse of women, rage issues, and commitment issues but towards the end, realizes his mistakes and comes back to Althea. To my surprise, she forgives him and takes him back.\n\nTaramani was every bit the new age of Aval Appadithan, she is unapologetic as to who she is and her choices. I was quite disappointed with the ending, why should a free-spirited, independent woman accept a man who is utterly flawed? I wished this movie had the ending of Marupadiyum, at the same time, if Balu Mahendra made Marupadiyum today, would he have let Thulasi unite with Arvind Swami?\n\nI discussed Taramani with a friend, and the discussion led to a debate üôÇ . At the end, my friend said, ‚ÄúYou know what your problem is, you are seeing the character from who you are and what you would do if you were that character. That is how you are approaching the movie. Maybe in Althea‚Äôs world this is the right decision for her and her child, her exposure or her life is not the same as what your life is made of.‚Äù\n\nWhether or not I was convinced with the ending is beyond the point, but what I did realize is both the audience and the makers of such films are caught in a bind. We want our women to emerge like a phoenix, she has to be liberated and she has to say and do the ‚Äòright things‚Äô according to her and according to society. She has to be Unique, yet be One of Us. All these movies we discussed here are of importance in today‚Äôs day and age, when women empowerment is defined as ‚Äúbreaking free‚Äù from things that bind her. What we need to realize is the very idea of breaking free is very subjective. It depends on the socio-economic conditions of the woman, and the definition of woman empowerment and entitlement is different for different women. One voice does not represent the entire womanhood, nor does one size fits all.\n\nFemale oriented scripts became a rarity in the 1990‚Äôs, leading ladies became an arm candy for the hero, there has to be an ‚Äúitem number‚Äù in every movie, and misogyny became an integral part of tamil cinema sometimes subtle, sometimes headlining. But there came Magalir Mattum(1994) as a comedy outing, but boldly discussed #MeToo before it was coined a term.\n\nMovies like 36 Vayadhiniley and Katrin Mozhi also had strong female roles at the expense of making the husband look like a villain. Then there were movies that turned heroines into a mass hero, pulling off unimaginable victories all the while resorting to violence. For example, the heroine avenges her dead husband by becoming a goddess Kali in Nee Engae en Anbe/Anamika(2014) or Imaikka Nodigal (2018). Should a woman empower herself by turning violent?\n\nIraivi, a movie touted to be feminist, spoke volumes about the helpless maleness. The movie is about troubled men, the women in their lives, and how the men are the devils and women are the Goddesses. The women in the movie can neither live with them nor leave them. One of the finest dialogues of the movie comes in the climax when one of the lead characters says, ‚ÄúPoruthukiradhukkum Sahichukiradhukkum naama enna pombalaiya, AAN, Aambala Mama, AAN- Nedil, Penn- Kuril, cha evvalavu kevalamana piravingalla naama?‚Äù\n\nPonni although ‚Äúadjusts‚Äù in the marriage, does not allow her husband to question her chastity. Yazhini tries her best to save the marriage for the sake of her daughter, but when she has had enough, she has had enough. The larger question here is: why do we always need a man as a utility to showcase female empowerment, or a female centric role? Iraivi, although is a fantastic movie discussing sensitive issues, still is viewed through the prism of the man.\n\nWomen in Mani Ratnam movies:\n\nAn analysis of Tamil Movies will be incomplete without Mani Ratnam! He sculpted solid female characters and broke the conventions through his leading ladies. Mani Rathnam heroines are beautiful, vivacious, strong, and flawed which only makes them endearing and life-like. Divya of Mouna Ragam is perhaps the beginning of ‚Äúbubbly character‚Äù of tamil cinema. But the soul of the movie wasn‚Äôt the conflict of the hero, it wasn‚Äôt a mass hero subject, but was about the conflicts of a stubborn, spirited, indecisive flawed woman finding clarity and eventually finding love. Ragini in Raavanan is a woman of self esteem and self respect, and when her husband questions her chastity, Ragini gets off the train, something Sita could have done in our mythologies.\n\nGVM‚Äôs Muse- Moving a step closer to Realism:\n\nGoutham Vasudev Menon has given us deep complex characters of an everyday woman who is independent, free-spirited, and has a mind of her own. GVM‚Äôs characters may be very Cosmopolitan but they are far more relatable to today‚Äôs Tamil Audience, and they have a significant role in the movie than just fading into the background. One of the most complicated characters written, Jessie, did drive us crazy with her duality and her elegance. Kakha Kakha gave us Maya, a smart, honest, and mystically beautiful Jyothika. Neethaane En Ponvasantham was a romantic flick, yet had Samantha who had so many layers to her. Her character evolved as she aged- as a teen she cries when Jeeva leaves, and takes a stand when she matures with more experience, just as your everyday woman who becomes wiser with age and experience. I loved how Trisha- Ajith‚Äôs relationship was portrayed in Yennai Arinthal. For however short-lived it was, a divorced woman with a child was getting married to a dashing man(who was not previously married) was a first in Tamil Cinema- I hope GVM did not kill off Trisha‚Äôs character to abide by social norms but to keep the story moving‚Ä¶ one can hope üôÇ ‚Ä¶\n\nPa. Ranjith- Your everyday woman who is a warrior within:\n\nPa. Ranjith is another director who etched female characters with a voice of their own. Puyal of Kaala, as an activist, chooses to pick up a stick instead of her pants and beat up the men who stripped her, screams strength and fortitude ahead of modesty. A simple housewife Selvi is shown as a strong-willed woman who can handle issues of her own just as you would see many moms around us. Kabali is as much about Radika Apte as much as its about Kabali. Kabali‚Äôs daughter is shown as a strong woman who knows how to put the man in his place and is shown to save Kabali however short-lived that was, before the heroism peeks up. It‚Äôs refreshing to see such layered roles for women in a Superstar‚Äôs movie and is a welcome move!\n\nSuper Delux is a movie that hit the nail on the head about women‚Äôs rights and the perception of women. The movie was as close to real life in the way it depicted the women and their lives just as much as men and their lives. The characters are all flawed in itself, but makes the audience think about objectification, gender identity without being preachy and explicit.\n\nWe are in a vicious circle- the roles the women play in tamil movies often times than not is what the director envisions, and this is based on the director‚Äôs value system, his beliefs, and morals along with what the director thinks his audience wants to see. What the audience wants to see is something that conforms to their beliefs, attitudes, and values which come from the social framework within which they live, which is the same social framework in which directors live.\n\nWe are in a golden era for Entertainment and women‚Äôs role with the advent of digital platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other digital channels paving way for new talent, cultivating out-of-the-box thinking. There is an unlimited scope for script writers, women directors, and younger male directors with a more conscious outlook for portrayal of characters on screen.\n\nConclusion:"
