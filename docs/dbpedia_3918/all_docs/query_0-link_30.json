        "text": "Contrary to what seems to be the popular opinion, I had a nice time watching this anthology. As is the case with most anthologies – some shorts works better than the others, and even the best ones do not quite get there – but at the end I was left with a warm, fuzzy feeling , which is what I wanted anyway.\n\n1- Ilamai Idho Idho by Sudha Kongara\n\nThis was my second-favourite short in this anthology. Written by Francis Thomas and Shruti Ramachandran, this is a story of two individuals who find love in the later part of adulthood. Rajiv (Jayaram) and Lakshmi (Urvashi) decide to spend a day in the company of each other, but an announcement by the Prime Minister at 8PM extends their time together by 21 days, during which they romance, bicker, make up and get in touch with the extent of their feelings for each other.\n\nAs the title indicates, this short depicts how being with the one you love can make you feel much younger, but the moment they interact with their children and others in their life or have to deal with a stressful situation, they immediately snap back to their older selves. Jayaram and Urvashi were lovely as always as the older Rajiv and Lakshmi, though I wish we got more of them. Kalidas Jayaram and Kalyani Priyadarshan were surprisingly good too. Kalidas had never impressed me post his stint as a child-actor, whereas Kalyani had only worked for me in Varane Avashyamundu. But here both of them were at their charming best and share great chemistry, even though Kalyani’s slurred dialogue delivery bothered me at times. And then of course, there is GV Prakash’s peppy retro music which is what really drives this segment. Overall, a nice, pleasant watch which left me with a smile.\n\n2- Avarum Naanum/Avalum Naanum by Gautham Vasudev Menon\n\nMy third-favourite in this anthology, this one gets the feels right. I have always liked the works of the GVM-Reshma Ghatala duo – be it Neethane En Ponvasantham which gave me a heroine I could relate very much with, or the web series Queen which had given us such a nuanced female lead. So naturally, my expectations for this short were somewhat high.And I was not disappointed, though not very impressed either.\n\nANAN tells the story of a young woman (Kanna, played by Ritu Varma), who is forced to spend the lockdown with her grandfather (Thaatha, played by MS Bhaskar), whom she bears a grudge against for refusing to accept her mother’s marriage with her father for wjat she believes are regressive and patriarchal reasons. However, as she spends more time in his company, she realises that people and their reasons for why they do what they do are not as black and white.\n\nWhat elevates the simple short are the performances. MS Bhaskar reminds us once again what a phonemenal actor he is. I remember how much he made me cry in Mozhi, and he almost acheives the same effect here too. And Ritu Varma – who looks like a painting – is just as wonderful, making me wonder yet again why it took so long for us to see more of her after Pelli Choopulu in 2016. I loved watching their interactions with each other, which exude love and warmth. And Govind Vasantha’s soulful score just adds to it all – especially the Kanna Thoodhu Po Da song which made me well up.\n\n3- Coffee, Anyone? by Suhasini Maniratnam\n\nThe weakest one in this anthology. Written by Maniratnam and Suhasini, this short is about three sisters who come together to celebrate their ailing mother’s 75th birthday, while struggling with problems of their own. The story is about how these few days and the challenges that come along with it make them grow closer as a family.\n\nFrom the very first scene, it becomes clear that the real struggle is going to be sitting through this whole thing without cringing. Over-expository dialogues, sugary-sweet-sounding conversations, OTT-acting from Suhasini and Anu Hassan, two sisters randmomly breaking into a song-and-dance routine and overstuffing of issues. The only thing I stayed with me at the end of it all was Shruti Hassan’s assured portrayal of Ramya, and her beautiful (though too short) rendition of Prabhu Mere. Otherwise, everything that can go wrong goes wrong in this short. Quoting Kanan Gill and Biswa Kalyan from Pretentious Movie Reviews – ‘the director over-directed, the screenwriter over-screenwrote and the actors over-acted’.\n\n4- Reunion by Rajiv Menon\n\nThis short was better than the previous one, though not by that great a margin. This one tells the story of two schoolmates whose paths cross after several years when one of their (Sadhana, played by Andrea Jeremiah) bike breaks down in front of the other (Vikram, played by Sikkil Gurucharan)’s house. Circusmtances lead to Sadhana staying with Vikram and his aged mother (Bhairav, Played by Leela Samson) during the lockdown period, during which the two have to deal with a possible case of COVID, addiction, challenges that come with following and choosing not to follow one’s dreams and unrequited love.\n\nOut the five shorts in this anthology, this is the only short that actually talks about COVID-19 as a contractible virus as sopposed to something that just caused the lockdown, and shows things like a doctor suspecting to have contracted COVID from a patient, self-isolating at home and so on. Which makes it amusing to see how carelessly they treat the whole thing. For example, why is Vikram not wearing a mask in the hospital? He even comes home and talks to his mother and a visitor at home without a mask (the visitor also walsk into the house without a mask BTW). And how does Vikram just casually invite Sadhana to stay over at his house when (a) He’s at high-risk (yes he is self-isolating but hello, basic human courtsey?) and (b) he has no idea where she’s come from or who she’s been in contact with, and he has an aged mother at home with whom she will be sharing a room. And all this, despite the fact that he is a DOCTOR an not an uneducated layman.\n\nThe way the substance abuse part was dealt with is also awry. (SPOILER) I liked how Sadhana was not judged for her vices, but I also laughed out loud at how Vikram thought the best way to help her deal with withdrawal symptoms was breaking into an impromptu rendition of Ooh La La La from Minsara Kanavu (don’t come at me citing music therapy now). I was also quite surprised by how unfazed Bhairavi was by the whole situation. Are even the coolest of moms that cool? (SPOILER ENDS)\n\nWhat I did like here were the uniformly pleasant performances by Andrea, Gurucharan and Leela Samson, who helped me look past some of these issues. I also liked the interactions between Bhairavi and Sadhana, especially the one where the former discusses her sex-life with the later.\n\n5- Miracle by Karthik Subbaraj\n\nThe best short in the anthology, without a doubt. I can’t talk about this short without giving away anything, and it’s better if you go into this one with absolutely no clue about it. All I’ll say is that this is the only short that looks beyond the upper middle-class elite families and tries to look at the struggles of others as well during the lockdown. Bobby Simha and K Muthukumar offers a lot of laughs. It was a fun ride with two small-time thugs, a godman and a young filmmaker.\n\nMy overall verdict of this anthology is that it is a pleasant, though not a great watch. I wouldn’t say you HAVE to watch it, but I liked it enough to feel like I didn’t waste two hours on it."
