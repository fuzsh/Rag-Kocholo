        "text": "@BR: I haven’t watched this movie. But unfortunately I’ve seen happen around me some of the behaviours/incidents you mentioned in your review as surprising to you.\n\n“The hero brings up the topic of virginity.” Someone I have the misfortune of knowing demanded an STD test of his girlfriend when he found out she wasn’t a virgin. Instead of dumping his ass, she consented and they are now married.\n\n“The heroine seems shocked when she realises guys watch porn.” This exact conversation once happened in my own life 🙂 I’ll leave it at that.\n\n“…why he’s chatting with other girls even after he’s with Nikitha. He says the reason is that if she leaves him or cheats on him, at least he won’t feel like a loser – because he has been “cheating” too.” This is unfortunately definitely a thing now. There is so much relationship/rejection anxiety now, coupled with an overload of choice, that a lot of young people keep their rolodex spinning even while they’re seriously dating someone. Just as a Plan B.\n\ntamil thanos: I don’t deny your points at all. Love in earlier generations was the same — because men and women are (respectively) emotionally wired the same way. It’s only the technology that keeps changing. That is why I have — in the first para itself — talked about older generation love/lust etc.\n\nIt’s a pity the movies, back then, enshrined love as something “pure” and not as something messy. So one should definitely appreciate Pradeep for getting into something tangled, and for showing how messy love can be.\n\nBut the film is unable to project a single POV. All its scenes are calculated not for the characters, but for the audience (will they laugh? will they cry?)… And makes the topic authentic, but the treatment inauthentic.\n\nI think the Tom-and-Jerry nature of the film is making people laugh, but I wanted more from something that calls itself “Love Today”.\n\nI think others should watch and weigh in on this. Will be very interesting to hear other POVs.\n\nYajiv: Actually, this may be the most important film of the year in terms of understanding young Tamil society. They have made this film a mega-hit, which means they are able to connect hugely with what it says.\n\nAbout your comment, the “hero brings up the topic of virginity” thing, or “the heroine is shocked her BF watches porn” thing:\n\nIt is not about general men/women, but about the urban/hip characters as written in this film. Neither aspect was convincing.\n\n” a lot of young people keep their rolodex spinning even while they’re seriously dating someone. Just as a Plan B” — now this is certainly odd in a film where the hero-heroine actually go to her father and ask for his permission to marry.\n\n@praneshp had I not watched komali I certainly wouldn’t have had so much derision towards this film.\n\nAs rangan has mentioned this guy is more like a ‘whistle generator’ director. In college functions or symposia, when you are doing adzap or small skits you intentionally insert some dialogs so that you generate the maximum amount of whistles from the audience and win the first prize regardless of whether you stick to the topic/theme of your skit or not. If you see Sullan one of Dhanush’s early movies, there will be absolutely needless dialogs about rajni and today’s girls and all because the director knows such scenes will elicit whistles and claps from the audience. The film itself will be made of such ‘audience pandering’ scenes.\n\nAnd komali was one hell of such a ‘publicity paithyam’ movie to describe in vadivel’s words. And if pradeep wants to do such a movie it is his right and I wouldn’t mind watching such a film too. But pradeep is someone who is so full of himself. He wants to be known among the masses not only as a funny person but also as someone who has “depth”. He wants to show to this world that a person who is so funny on the surface can also be really very intelligent and deep. He wants to floor the audience by being both. So the second halves of his movies are all damn too serious ones which have tons and tons of messages and life lessons for the apparently infantile audiences who visit cinema halls only to make notes and take instructions on how to live their complex and problem-filled lives.\n\nSo all his movies in my opinion like komali are exercises in feeding his ego. This is precisely what a film like Don too did. I would place both pradeep and cibi who did Don in the same category.\n\nI have seen people like them in college who like to portray themselves as “the most lovable” guys in the world without an iota of sincerity in what they are trying to be. If there are certain movies which I would like to stay away from even if questions from the film are going to be the syllabus for the next upsc exam , those from the stable of pradeep will be the ones that take the top spot.\n\nThese directors need to grow out of the cage of the ages where every instinct and behavioral aspect of you is sculpted and sharpened towards attracting girls or generating popularity so that you end up making movies atleast primarily if not wholly for the sake of satisfying your creative urge. Only then you shall start doing movies that are sincere, heartfelt and worth watching. The moment I saw the tagline for Love Today as ‘dedicated to the girl who left me’ it struck me that this film is also trying to use audiences to massage the film-maker’s already XXL-sized ego (just like how T Rajendar’s films/vanity projects used to be) I immediately decided to delete it from my watchlist.\n\nSpeaking of Don and Cibi Chakravarthy , he’s been signed to direct the next Rajinikanth movie following Nelson’s Jailer….\n\nIdk what kind of a movie is that gonna be?\n\nA Darbar kinda Rajinikanth moments compilation movie?\n\n(Petta too is one , but atleast it was sincere and Karthik Subbaraj wasn’t joking when he said he’s a huge Rajini fan)\n\nOr a movie whose sole purpose is to give Anirudh some reason to blast loud background scores?\n\nOr a movie where Cibi tries to make Rajinikanth appeal to today’s kids by making Rajini play PUBG , do instagram reels and start a youtube channel , make him talk stuff like 90s kids vs 2k kids or singles vs committed?\n\nWhile I’m happy that Kamal is gonna do movies with Mani , Ranjith , Vetrimaaran , GVM , Mahesh Narayanan and H Vinoth , I feel sad that his competitor , the greatest entertainer of all time won’t get a proper sendoff like him and he’s making ours and Baddy’s fears come true by acting in trainwrecks like Annaatthe.\n\nIs Annaatthe the kind of movie that Rajini wants his fans to remember in his final years as a star?\n\nIf Nelson and Cibi does good movies with Rajini , then fine , but I don’t think they would do so , considering the movies they did and I think they’d just use Rajini as a tool to grab our cash….\n\nAnd I wish Rajini collaborates with people who really understand his true potential as an actor like Ranjith ( I disliked Kabali , but admired Rajini’s performance , liked Kaala) and people who really gets what Rajinism is like Karthik Subbaraj to bid adieu on a high.\n\n“On the surface, Pradeep Ranganathan’s Love Today is about the apparent shallowness of… love today. ”\n\nI am going to take this first line of the review and expand on this a bit. Love, in the context of a relationship, is an emotion that we express towards another person and when the ‘love’ of today is shallow, apparently, then we are actually saying that today’s relationships are shallow. And by shallow, we are actually saying that the depth of feeling and emotion is absent or lower, evidenced by easy and frequent break-ups. As against this, when the love that blossomed between two individuals takes a linear and organic route and results in a marriage, we are ready to ascribe depth to that relationship. We do this because we see marriage as a commitment to a relationship for life, and hence deep and serious. However, this is an illusion. In truth, there have always been ‘arranged’ marriages which lacked depth of emotion and love, and couples stayed together either as their duty towards their children, or owing to pressure from the parents/close relatives, or because (in most cases) the woman did not have the financial independence to move out. Depth and love in arranged marriages must be in the exception category, rather than as a rule. Therefore, the problems in the relationship were hidden under the carpet of a marital relationship and all seemed well to the outside world, which has contributed heavily to creating this illusory sense of ‘depth’, ‘commitment’ and ‘seriousness’ to marriage. Even couples who had initially fallen in love and get married have run into a sense of disillusionment a few years down the line, and the relationship turns shallow in such cases too. Stephen Covey very rightly said that beyond a point, Love as an emotion has to transform to Loving as a verb and this is very crucial if a relationship has to survive the test of time. This is true for both ‘arranged’ and ‘love’ marriages as well.\n\nSo what’s eating today’s Love? I guess its simply the fact that the younger generation of today do not feel the need for a deep and committed relationship in order to traverse through life. So in that sense, it could be that their belief in the system of marriage to help people conduct their lives is not as high as it was with earlier generations. So the question is, does this approach or attitude make today’s Love shallow? And secondly, has only today’s Love become shallow? My final thoughts are that, shallowness or depth has to be defined from the context of what a person or a couple want from a relationship because this goalpost keeps moving from generation to generation. Earlier, the goals of a relationship were defined by the immediate family under the influence of the larger society, and hence had limited (if not none) scope for personal liberties. Whereas it is now being defined by the individuals concerned and hence will be only as shallow or deep as the individuals want it to be.\n\n@Chitra: Given the harshness of your response (even though I was broadly accepting my failings & agreeing with you), I feel like I need to respond to your accusations. Especially since you seem to have created your own feature-length screenplay from a one-line.\n\n“Otherwise you would reply straight instead of slyly commenting! ” Can I ask how I am not ‘replying straight’ right now? In this blog we @ people when we reply to them. That’s exactly what I did in response to you.\n\n“It’s not about staying with abusers or leaving. ” But it’s exactly that.\n\n“It’s about not imposing your opinion, however right it may be, on a grown up woman’s decision about her own life!” When someone’s getting regularly abused, both verbally & physically, (as is the case here) do you ask us (my partner & I) to just sit and watch?\n\n“If she had asked your opinion, you could have given it. ” She came crying to my then-fiancee/now-wife and I many times. We tried our best to help & counsel her. To leave the relationship & marriage.\n\n“But commenting about someone’s private life in a public forum is not in the calibre of a person who, in your own words, “is there”! ”\n\nI want to make a few things clear:\n\n1) This blog is mostly anonymous. No one knows who I am here. No one knows my name even. Only BR knows my email. There is absolutely no risk of this person’s identity being exposed.\n\n2) Absolutely no names were mentioned here. Other people have also mentioned similar stories that happened in their and their loved ones’ lives in this blog, in other threads. I can point you to the Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh comments for starters. Perhaps you were not aware of that.\n\n3) I mentioned this person’s story tangentially to illustrate a point of contention I had with BR’s review.\n\n4) What I mentioned happened a number of years ago. While we are in a different city from this person now, we are still in touch and we know that the marriage is now over and this person has used her own story to advocate for others to see red flags and leave relationships when they have to. In fact I messaged her asking if I could share her story (I even sent what I had initially written) to get her Okay before I did.\n\n@Chitra, I truly am sorry this triggered you as much as it did. Judgement sucks and as a society we are especially judgemental on women. Thats why I was and still am trying to be as empathetic as possible in the face of your outburst. But you don’t know me, you don’t know this person (that I had mentioned), you don’t know her full situation (both then & now), you don’t know the relationship between me and my spouse and her and you certainly don’t know what has happened since or what happened yesterday before I shared this story.\n\n“Hope you get there soon for your own sake!” Thank you, I hope I do. I truly hope you can process whatever past trauma fueled this as well. For your sake. God knows, I’ve had my own journey these past few years (in this regard).\n\nYajiv: ““Otherwise you would reply straight instead of slyly commenting! ” Can I ask how I am not ‘replying straight’ right now? In this blog we @ people when we reply to them. That’s exactly what I did in response to you.”\n\nAgain, sorry for my outburst, but look at it from my point of view if you can. Your comment is so short that it is very ambiguous. Hope you see that.\n\n““It’s not about staying with abusers or leaving. ” But it’s exactly that.” No, it’s not. I repeat, it’s about respecting an adult’s decision unless there is some clear violation in a public space.\n\n“When someone’s getting regularly abused, both verbally & physically, (as is the case here) do you ask us (my partner & I) to just sit and watch?\n\n“If she had asked your opinion, you could have given it. ” She came crying to my then-fiancee/now-wife and I many times. We tried our best to help & counsel her. To leave the relationship & marriage.”\n\nIf you had just told this in your first reply to my comment instead of a short, ambiguous reply, I would have understood and we could have moved on. Even interpreting your reply in a straight manner is misleading(you admitted to a mistake when there was none), given this piece of information.\n\nAnonymous or not, when you want to share information about a sensitive topic such as this for whatever reason, please be as much elaborate as possible,especially when someone raises a doubt as I did. Otherwise, not only me, others too might start imagining their own stories. Some may tell it out loud like me, others could keep it to themselves and their friends which is even worse, if you know what I mean. As you rightly said, I know nothing about you and you know nothing about me, so all the more reason to be clear in dealing with sensitive issues. I hope I have made myself clear. Sorry once again for dragging you like this. As you rightly guessed, there is a past for me that hurts, but for obvious reasons I don’t want to talk about it here. I will simply say that you couldn’t be more right when you said “Judgement sucks”.\n\nWith regards to ‘love’ in today’s youth, I am in my early 30s away from India and therefore can’t speak to that. But I will share one incident that is relevant here.\n\nMy friend and I (both women) recently got introduced to this male friend. He hit it off instantly with my female friend and my female friend showed interest in hanging out with him more and he reciprocated it as well. After a couple of hangouts, she looked him up on Instagram and found out that he had gotten married recently and that his wife is in another country. We asked him about this and he acknowledged his marital status, and we were both surprised that he didn’t reveal it himself while leading my friend on.\n\nAnd, slowly while we became friends with him, we got to know that when doing long distance relationship, he has a need for romantic banter with someone and sometimes also a sexual need. So, he often falls into a ‘semi-romantic’ relationship with women (that’s not his wife) while telling them that he has a wife (at some point, may not be initially) and that he will no longer continue this ‘relationship’ when his wife moves in with him. And, the wife doesn’t know about this. I have been trying to understand this and my moral compass tells me this is ‘shady’ because in polyamory, all parties involved know about the situation, but here, the wife doesn’t and the other women may get to know about his marital status much after they are involved with him.\n\nI am still unable to come to terms with this, and I must say that I am definitely judging this person with a grey light so far. Quite surprised that the movie shows things like this to be common.\n\nEnna koduka sir pera: my moral compass tells me this is ‘shady’ because in polyamory, all parties involved know about the situation\n\nExactly 🙂 What this film shows is a boy and girl who are together WHILE exploring other options or entertaining calls from exes who want to go to Pondy and see the sunrise (and lying about this to the boy). I mean, are you invested in this other person or not? Do you care about his/her feelings or not? If you just want him/her as arm candy or as an FWB, then no issues. But saying you are “in love” something else.\n\nI understand totally that movies have sanitised love to be this “pure” thing next only to god or whatever — and I love that this film exists, to show how it can fuck you up, give you trust issues in this smartphone era, etc.\n\nBut man, I just wish it had been written properly. This film is all “situation” and no “characterisation” — a very basic narrative arc but with practically no character arcs.\n\nIn a good screenplay (which is why I mentioned THIRUCHITRAMBALAM), the action comes from the emotion. What someone does or feels is the result of what someone is or what someone thinks. Here, we barely get into anyone’s head. One lecture at the end, and POOF! Everyone’s wiser and the whole problem goes away.\n\nAnd I really wish someone takes this same premise and makes a drama of it (as opposed to a ‘comedy’). That will be the VTV of this era.\n\nPS: Interestingly, for all this ‘progressiveness’, the girl is still a virgin 🙂 I’d like to live to the day when Tamil cinema crosses that bridge 🙂\n\n“A follow-up question. If words are pronounced differently by Americans and British, why is it wrong if Indians pronounce them in their way?” – I am sure you have kinda covered this when you did IELTS or any other language test for immigration but within the variety of accents, there is still a convergence of pronunciations that would be considered native English. Some of the Northern English or Scottish accents wouldn’t fit in this but Cockney, Southern English as well as most American, Canadian and Australian accents comfortably fit this converging pattern. So…the difference is, for eg, native speakers say pee-pul (and it’s almost a double l without being as emphatic as an Indian double l) while we Indians say pee-pal. I am not getting into how even the sounds are different, like our ‘t’ is very hard compared to theirs (and again, that stays constant across their accents – nobody pronounces a t in say ‘the’ or ‘time’ the way we do).\n\nAs to why it’s ‘wrong’, I think your ‘standard’ Prannoy Roy Indian accent isn’t wrong as such but the more pronounced South Indian and North Indian accents do veer too far from native English, this mispronunciation of love in the South being a typical example. I would address it with a counter question – do we enjoy listening to Udit Narayan’s pronunciation of Tamil? No we don’t, right? I don’t think it’s as dissimilar when you take a thick Indian accent (as opposed to a soft one a la Prannoy) and plonk it in a native English environment. It IS going to stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nAll the bullet points in my previous comment ended becoming a single paragraph. Let me try to break it down better\n\nJust finished watching the movie. It was quite entertaining despite some terrible writing in the second half. I am not surprised that the movie didn’t work for BR or his avid followers. I’ll try to explain why it worked big for the rest. Just to clarify, I am in my mid twenties and I am sort of familiar with the youth culture.\n\nMost of the jokes rely on how much you are a part of the tamil meme culture, and most youngsters today are. For instance, the character ‘Revi’ is based on the famous meme trope ‘boy bestie’ – a guy who is close friends with a girl and poses as a threat to her boyfriend(s). Sathyaraj is purposefully made as a staunch Brahmin, since meme culture hates brahmins. Jokes like these end up generating whistles in the theatre, and unfortunately this is the only way you are convincing people to come to theatres nowadays (apart from the auto-whistle generating Vijay and Ajith movies)\n\nMost youngsters are conservative, despite the facade of being cool and liberal. So premarital sex and porn watching will still be considered as taboo. Things are improving, but we are a long way ahead.\n\nI agree that there is insane pressure to be in a relationship nowadays, and movie does touch upon this aspect when the character Dinesh gets catfished by his classmates. I would blame this on movies, peer pressure, social media and porn. Arranged marriage is a ‘safe’ option for them, and they want to experience everything in a relationship before that.\n\nFolks who have options during relationships are those who use their relationship for their personal gains, not because they want to be with the other person. Some people use this as a status symbol and some use for financial reasons. I don’t think this is common, but this is getting prevalent. This is not polyamory, since this requires mutual understanding from everybody in the relationship. That doesn’t happen here.\n\nIn every friends group, there is always one guy that people make fun of , like the Yogi Babu’s character. I have seen such people, and no matter what they say or do, they will always be made fun of. Yogi Babu’s character resonated with a lot of people, even if it was written terribly.\n\nI liked the movie way better than thiruchittramabalam. This is basically Alaipayuthey in the mobile age. I took the movie seriously in the second half because the gritty absolutely embarrassing way in which the couple go at each other is so realistic. I am not even in that age group but I daresay there can’t be a couple who hasn’t had nasty fights as these two in that particular phase of the relationship. Pradeep’s acting also got solid in the second half. Ivana was super convincing as your regular 20 something while avoiding the regular glam heroine stereotype. Sathyaraj was sorta sticking out and over the top but Radhika with her phone nondaadha comments was superb. I know I sound like her with a teenager in the house.\n\nI don’t understand BR’s comments about the dichotomy of asking her dad for permission. The movie captures the reality today of the dichotomy between fairly normal/conservative regular lives and a porn driven, no bars, no limits digital life. This sorta thing is an issue for everyone – not just the youth. Our lives are just a bit more colorful/argumentive/sexy/polyamorous online. Sometimes digital life spills over I guess as with mamakutty! I thought this movie is brilliant in capturing these facets of the digital- social media era. They know each other’s 3d life – friends, family, expressions, smoking etc etc. It is just the digital kisses and delusions that were hidden .. are they real, are they not? I enjoyed it with it’s flaws and all.\n\nJay S: Okay, I did not word that well. I did not mean screenplay POV, but the way the characters are structured as people who behave a particular way JUST TO PUSH A BUTTON in the audience (whether that button is “laugh”, or “cry” or “feel senti”).\n\nTake the heroine. I love the scene where he asks her to send him a nudie pic, and she sends him one (of many). That’s a great moment where both the love is not treated as “pure” and “only from the heart”, also the woman is shown as someone who understands sexual desire.\n\nBut later, she’s horrified that he watches porn. (Cue: audience laughter.) Firstly, it’s hard to imagine a young woman of today not knowing that guys watch porn. But more importantly, she has been sending him those pictures. What did she think he was doing with them?\n\nSo there is no effort to present a consistent person (that’s what I mis-wrote as POV). Which is why I hesitate to call this a “screenplay”. It’s more like a series of skits/sketch comedy bits strung together.\n\nPS: I get it that this may not be a deal-breaker to many people, but a lot of things bothered me in this film (even as I was laughing at them). If my GF had said — for instance — that she was spending a day with family when she was actually spending the day with her ex, my first thought would certainly have not been “did you guys get a room have sex?” but “why did you lie to me?”\n\nThis sort of plot point is very tricky material because it is a dramatic plot point and you are treating it as comedy. Of course, everything can be treated in any way — but for me, this film did not find the right way to generate a joke from this situation. It took the instantly easy way out and slut-shamed the girl.\n\nI am not coming at all this from a “woke” viewpoint. I believe in free speech, which means I should even allow rape jokes, however much they may make ME want to vomit. My point is simply that these characters are hardly fleshed out as real “today’s people”. They are just “audience button-pushers”.\n\nI was talking to a female friend about this film (she is in her early 30s and a psychologist, I wanted to see what her reaction was). She said something interesting: that this film is really about boys who have never been around girls. These are boys who have only “guy friends”, who have studied in schools that either had no girls or that separated the boys and girls — so for the target audience, the “girl” is always the “other “, something exotic and unattainable. So they are confused about the Madonna/Whore conundrum.\n\n(From Google, for those who don’t know this term: The Madonna-Whore Dichotomy (MWD) denotes polarized perceptions of women in general as either “good,” chaste, and pure Madonnas or as “bad,” promiscuous, and seductive whores.)\n\nThese guys want to marry someone like their mother/Madonna, all virginal and all that, but until that point, their lust makes them view girls as objects as sexual desire.\n\nThis was the starting point of a long chat we had, and my first point was that she was being class-ist and judgmental, and also was generalising a whole male population. And then she got a lot more specific, and it was a very interesting conversation.\n\nFor instance, I learnt for the first time about the term “naan avala stalk panna poren” (one of her young male clients used that term). At first, I thought the guy was openly declaring that he was going stalk the girl PHYSICALLY, but what the guy meant was what she called “emotional stalking” — i.e., you see a girl in college and like her, but you can’t go up and talk to her, so you follow her in Insta and “stalk” her there.\n\nMy friend called this “benign stalking”. I asked if this could turn dangerous, but she said it depended on each individual and you cannot club this into a general behaviour.\n\nI wish I had recorded that conversation and put it out here, because I really would have loved to see what commenters have to say 🙂\n\nPS: Again, I am not judging the youngsters of today. My job is only to evaluate the film.\n\nAnd I know the majority is going to say “this is just a time-pass comedy film, why think so much about it?” But here’s the thing. I really think LOVE TODAY is hands down the most “important” film of the year. I am not saying “best” — but “important” in terms of how it tells us a lot about society, both in terms of how it represents Boy and Girl on screen, and how these representations have been embraced so whole-heartedly by the audience…\n\n“Since we weren’t allowed to talk with the girls , the boys automatically assume some really bad stuff about them or get scared when a girl comes and talks to them outside school.” – Wow, this wasn’t the case when I studied and I gave my SSC exam in 2001. I don’t think this is the case in schools and colleges in Maharashtra even today. I remember a few years back a guy who had just finished college joined our tennis group and his girl-friend tagged along. I hyphenate because she wasn’t his ‘GF’ but just a ‘friend who happened to be a girl’. I couldn’t think of anything more regressive than separating girls and boys. No wonder! This is a perfect explanation for the ‘poriki’ stalking the North Indian import trope and promising her dire consequences if she doesn’t give in.\n\nI just read the review. Something very fascinating struck me when I read this passage.\n\n“I was both shocked and saddened by this revelation. Is this what love today is like? Is this the immense pressure today’s youngsters find themselves under? Is this how they reassure themselves about their self-worth? Man, it must be insane to live like that – saying that you are in love and yet sensing that you may be dumped, and therefore pursuing other openings on the side!” – Well, I can kind of relate this to my corporate experience as well as that of my age-peers. Most of my friends and acquaintances left their first job after college long ago. But most people in my parents’/uncle-aunts’ generation changed very few jobs in their career.\n\nHere’s my take on what changed. I have attended a bunch of farewell functions of lifers at one of the old industrial behemoths of India. Towards the end, many of these farewells took place because these lifers were given VRS (it was dubbed CRS for that reason). A HR head we had – a very articulate one who writes for a business newspaper – pointedly told a long time employee that there’s no such thing as loyalty anymore. He even had the cheek to say he was more loyal because he did a lot for the company while he was with them (he was on notice at that point, just by the by). I mean, he’s not really wrong but there wasn’t really a need to rub it in except that this was par for the course coming from him.\n\nOur generation has come up in a time where it does seem that none of the old values have any currency anymore and that people who believed in them are the fools/lacked smarts. Smarts is an important word. I remember a very fascinating episode of Neeya Naana where Gopi prised out how the parents’ concern about their kids’ warped priorities actually originated from their own expectation of their kids. To a man/woman, every parent wanted their kid to be the smartest in town and not one wanted him/her to be a good person. Not one. There you go.\n\nAt least in my generation, we still have some of the old wooly-headedness to put it bluntly because we grew up in the analog age and watched it turn into a digital world (it’s probably why Gen Xers and Zers both taunt millennials while boomers only grumble in a in-my-time kind of way). It’s not surprising to me that those who have grown up post-00s would have a radically different worldview from what we were taught in our formative years. I am not saying that makes anybody from my or their cohort fools for wanting a stable relationship. I am devoted to my wife as she is to me and we do fervently believe in until-death-do-us-part. But I also know of at least three divorces from my friends-and-acquaintances circle, all within a year or two of marriage and I don’t know of ONE from my parents’ cohort. In their time, they hung on even in marriages that had long since gone sour. Nobody has the time for that today. Adutha opening-a pursue pannuvom, growth vennum, that’s the mantra today. Indha growth momentum nammala nuclear apocalypse-la kondu vidapordha nu theriyala.\n\nMadan: I am not sure you can compare professional life to personal relationships. In every generation, there are people who kept changing jobs vs people who sat in one steady job. No one ever said no to a promotion/extra money.\n\nBut looking for other jobs while in one job is one thing. Scoping for other people while in a relationship is quite another. And that is what I found fascinating.\n\nI would not be so intrigued with this film is they said Boy and Girl met just one month ago and he proposed — because that is hardly any time to get to know anyone beyond the surface. And then the phone-exchange happens and the world erupts. That premise I can buy.\n\nBut here, what it makes it queasy for me is the fact that the couple has been seeing one another for a while. And they seem to know nothing about each other, plus the guy is scoping out other women WHILE in the relationship.\n\nThat was new to me. I am not saying these boys don’t exist. I am just surprised that such a boy would want to marry the girl and go as far as asking her father — when he could have simply strung her along.\n\nThese are boys who have only “guy friends”, who have studied in schools that either had no girls or that separated the boys and girls — so for the target audience, the “girl” is always the “other “, something exotic and unattainable.\n\nWhile I never found girls unattainable in my student life (which was very aromantic, to be honest), I didn’t befriend many. It also helps that I am not a very good speaker – the thoughts in my head never fully translate into words, and I am still working on it. Only when I joined graduation college, I could befriend both women and LGBTQ+, some of them still in touch and who made me see what I was earlier blind to. I am still very imperfect, but then who isn’t?\n\nSo, while I don’t dispute the idea behind this, I find it fascinating from a cinematic standpoint. Aren’t our mainstream cinema’s female leads qualifying for this unattainability in, like, 9 out of 10 films? Not only the way they look, but also the way they are written. And the template expects the audience to cheer up when our male lead wins over a woman way out of his league – that’s star vehicle 101. I rarely see a star vehicle where the leads seem equal.\n\nBut does anyone know of a film where guy or girl commits to someone, WHILE checking out possibilities (or simply flirting) with others? This may be the first film…\n\nThere is no film like this one I can remember. But, I should acknowledge Soggade Chinni Nayana as it comes to my mind. Nagarjuna was happily married to Ramya Krishna in that film (until he was killed), and is a legendary figure in his village both for his philanthropy and for being a ladies man – every young female soul in that village (including Anushka Shetty in a cameo) had the hots for him. And he himself used to go after them (and it is up to the audience to decide where it ultimately lead to), which is a running gag in the film as Nagarjuna keeps ribbing at Ramya Krishna’s efforts to hide her age. Ironically, this ghost has to flirt with his son’s contemporaries (in a really lovely song), and the villagers still consider him as the inspiration for pursuing women in the nearby villages.\n\nThe sequel, Bangarraju, takes this to the next level, where Nagarjuna is shown flirting with the women in both heaven and hell, but the scope for fun is very restricted in that one.\n\n@BR: To answer your question as to “But does anyone know of a film where guy or girl commits to someone, WHILE checking out possibilities (or simply flirting) with others? This may be the first film…” I think my favorite BR recommend would count as one – July Kaatril where the guy falls for another girl while practically engaged with his girlfriend. I think the timing is a huge factor here and in most cases discussed here. The hero in July Kaatril even candidly admits that he got engaged to his fiance not because he was in love with her and wanted to have a future with her but because all his friends were getting engaged and married but he was still unattached. So while in college there is the peer pressure to get a girlfriend because you are thought as some kind of loser if you don’t have one and by the time you are in your mid-20s if you are still unmarried and don’t have a fiance/spouse you are again peer pressured into getting one. This makes most folks(I include guys/men and girls/women from all classes) scramble for the least offensive prospect in their circle and partner up all while wondering if they are actually in love with them and slyly test the waters on the side.\n\nSpeaking of films that explore today’s relationships , I would love for more films like Oh My Kadavule which explores the theme of friends of opposite sex marrying each other because there is pressure from both families to marry someone quickly. That trend has been on a swift upswing in real life but very few films rarely explore the after-marriage life of such couples well or at least from an interesting angle.\n\n@BR – he does say – ‘I don’t mind her having a mate for shuttle (badminton I guess) but I didn’t even know she played shuttle’ – why did you lie to me? basically. With that mamakutti he is just blinded by possessiveness that she actually spent time with her ex. It is not logical or anything but it’s reasonable since even in the US you don’t go around with your ex. This movie treated the heroine with way more equality than most other Tamil movies.\n\nJerking off with her photos is 1 thing, porn at odd times by itself is not a deal breaker but I guess it was just one more thing to tack on to him as she is pretty mad already.\n\nThat is the whole point of the movie – they are committed to each other. But they think they can do these other things just because they are digital interactions or a result of digital interactions. I feel people here are reading too much into this young couple or him ‘frying kadalai’ with other women. He is interacting with other women online in a way he thinks has nothing to do with his commitment for her. She thinks a drive with an ex is just a drive. Even married for many years couples’ exes are basically 1 ‘Hi’ away. Things become extremely messy online. That is the point of the movie.\n\nI find all this discussion straying very far from the simple love story this movie is. It is not good cinema but it is a good movie. Thiruchittrambalam took a beaten to death story and dressed it up with solid performances. This movie is an average presentation of a fresh thought process. When 2 people fight they are irrational. People who love can be mean to each other. It is a vulnerable time when puppy love gives way to family getting involved and things getting real and when phones are involved, ‘real’ gets messy.\n\nMy 2 cents ( for whatever it’s worth) 🙂\n\nI don’t see why the movie needs to be over analysed. It laid out in the open lot of things that typically happen in youngsters relationships and yes it can get messy. I have personally seen so much of what was depicted in this movie, the parallel flirting, doubts that creep in due to insecurities, all of them. If people are challenging the logic, then I reckon they may be out of tune with this generation. And damn , most of this I have seen happening back in the 2006-7 when I was all of 25 years old 🙂 no it didn’t surprise me but actually took me to the good old days of Yahoo messenger. And why do we have to search for movies that have shown this in the past? Why can’t this be the first time someone who has the courage and no baggage to call it out as it is. Well that’s why it’s titled Love Today 🙂 Looking at YouTube, every person coming out of the theatre saying that the movie reflects their lives whether we like it or not . I rest my case.\n\n@Jay S and Ashwin: I haven’t seen Love today yet(and frankly have no intention of watching it either) but what seems to irk most women is that the film only claims that its written from both the girl’s and boy’s POV but firmly sides with the boy’s POV making his monumental sins look on par with the girl’s mistakes. Are you really telling me a guy asking for pics from young women saying he is looking to cast them in a short film and misusing those pics ultimately is even in the same universe as a girl spending a day in secret with her ex? Seeing as the hero of this movie is also the director and was a short filmmaker himself, I’m horrified for all the girls who had actually auditioned for his earlier films or who expressed an interest in acting to him. What exactly did he do to them? Factor in the fact that they would easily have been minors when that would have happened and it positively makes his crimes absolutely revolting . That this film has been lapped up by today’s youth and has been the reality of many young and old folks alike is no reason for not calling out the fact that the world is a scary little hellhole for women.\n\n@brangan:\n\n“But later, she’s horrified that he watches porn. (Cue: audience laughter.) Firstly, it’s hard to imagine a young woman of today not knowing that guys watch porn. But more importantly, she has been sending him those pictures. What did she think he was doing with them?”\n\nI don’t think that the underlying indignation here is of the form “you have sexual thoughts? ewww”. Its likely more “I’m right here, and even send you pics. But you still need to look at other naked women? What gives?”. Of course, in real life, girls live with this and overlook such “infidelity” as inevitable. Its filled with such little contradictions that are swept under the rug.\n\nAs for couples still keeping an eye out for better options, I can’t think of it ever not being that way. Most people get in on the dating bandwagon mostly for the whole “girlfriend experience” that is constantly hyped up in popculture, just to try it out for themselves (and quell the “mujhme kya kami hai?” question that would pop up otherwise). Even if it does get serious, its mostly due to comfort levels and inertia, not some deiviga kadhal. In fact, romance as in the movies always seems like it was written by incels who have fetishized the idea of women but have never actually courted any.\n\n@rsylviana I personally have a rule to not comment/judge or otherwise get into a frenzy about things that I haven’t heard/seen myself be it Vetrimaran’s remark or a movie. I need to have heard the speech or watched the movie to contribute to public opinion for a few reasons. 1. I would never have any standing in a debate on such shaky grounds without the cause and context. 2. If I don’t have the time or motivation to consume the original content, I don’t have to waste time getting offended or supporting it’s aftermath. 3. The world will be a calmer place if we actually respected time and our own brain power when using it for public opinion forming activities.\n\nThat apart, if you saw the movie, you would understand this is not a hero glorification movie. This movie doesn’t celebrate either of these personalities. It just documents them leaving no doubt that these are flawed immature individuals. It is a fun debate to see whether the girl’s or guy’s offences are more offensive – something that I have indulged in even with Minnale – with friends who have also seen the movie 🙂\n\nI am signing out of this discussion as my quota for this movie is all done. This movie doesn’t deserve more.:)\n\nMy first ever comment on BR’s blog after reading his work since his Hindu days. (I started very young😉)\n\nThis whole comment thread is a terrific discussion, and as BR himself said, a reflection of and perspectives about relationships in the modern age. Watched the film yesterday on Netflix(tired of studying for UPSC😁). Being in my mid 20s, I could understand all the raised eyebrows from the ppl on either side of the 80s-90s threshold, as also what the movie is trying to convey.\n\nFound it to be a pretty decent watch except for the last MMS bit which seemed shoehorned. Acc. to me, apart from portraying relationships today, it also gives the mobile phone an important character, which is omnipresent, and how it gives people the space to be their very basal person, things that they can’t be in their real world(although this is not explored as a primary subject; as it’s huge by itself).\n\nI personally did not feel the female lead was painted in misogyny, though there were a couple ‘punch dialogues’ that were.\n\nI concur with BR that this film is a window to understanding Tamizh youngsters today, and the commentary and voice of these youngsters largely driven by single male boys(Which explains the largely male gaze in this film). Having studied in TN just before and after the Jio era, can see truth in the way youngsters in the film are engaging.\n\nRegarding them pursuing other ‘ventures’ alongside, this is pretty common, and my oldest and closest friend conceded after a fight with his very serious girlfriend that he’s compelled to talk to other girls in case things don’t work out b/w them, even if he wants it to. As a guy who’s never been in a relationship, I’ve experienced what ppl think about such a guy (been asked whether I was straight or not with much sincerity and concern😂) and the pressure to be hooked up seriously or otherwise is IMMENSE.\n\nUltimately, much of it is the lust and overflowing libido, what with all the overexposure to sexuality from a very young age. Never been on Insta, and from what my friends show me, there’s way too much sexuality in that app that disgusts me and makes me stay away.\n\nI have lots to write and share about this, will stop here. What if no one reads and responds to a comment on a blog thread that stopped conversation?😂 Hope for a response from BR, big fan sir.\n\nThat’s a lot of comments and very interesting takes, I just want to address from my perspective just one thing.\n\n@BR\n\n“Exactly 🙂 What this film shows is a boy and girl who are together WHILE exploring other options or entertaining calls from exes who want to go to Pondy and see the sunrise (and lying about this to the boy). I mean, are you invested in this other person or not? Do you care about his/her feelings or not? If you just want him/her as arm candy or as an FWB, then no issues. But saying you are “in love” something else.”\n\nAm in my 40’s partied with a very rich “elitist” group (that includes a few now famous actors even) in my 20’s and 30’s and the kind of shady shit that went on first boggled my mind and then I got acclimatised to it and finally just accepted it as “life is messy, don’t judge if it’s between consensual adults”.\n\nThis whole searching actively will being in an apparently committed relationship has nothing to do with Love Today but been a part of relationships across human history. As BR said we are wired the same now as we were in the late Chola era or even even we moved to a hunter gatherer stage.\n\nThe only difference is from the time we settled in cities a few millenia ago to maybe 30 years ago it was easier to get away with philandering and much much harder to “score” (gender agnostic here, women “score” as much as men do). That dynamic has just gone all topsy turvy with the advent of tech.\n\nIt’s much easier to find a partner accomodating of any of your requirements (depraved or otherwise), a 35 yo friend of mine, single, lovely lovely girl actively only looks for married men on Tinder and Bumble …why? Fuck knows why, and she is able to “score”.\n\nThe other dynamic change is, unless you use Jason Bourne level subterfuge being outed is not a question of if, but when. Gone are the days when a person could have a second marriage in the same city and hide it till they died (this unfortunately skews more towards the male as our society imposed a lot more patriarchal control till recently, still does but it is reducing imo), this dynamic is what’s driving this insecurity is my gut feel.\n\nAnother both positive and negative development (Schrodingers development?) Is that even in my gen ( I met my now wife when we were 17…at a party incidentally) there was this sense that you had to work to make.it stick. We had a fuck ton of fights till even our early 30’s till we found that particular equilibrium (she talks, I listen…. I jest) but I find my single friends these days break up more easily. Is the harem that’s available online thanks to right swiping apps or even offline driving this change? Possibly but it’s here to stay.\n\nTldr love today is the same as love 300bce, just made a bit Messier thanks to the ubiquitous smart phone.\n\nBR’s review captures most of what I felt about this film. And this line, especially:\n\nWhere does one draw the line between being young and foolish, and having some kind of inner moral code?\n\nIts one thing to have characters indulge in the foolishness of youth— in fact, I’d say it’s refreshing to see characters this messed up. But the problem for me was that it seemed like even the film writer is stuck in the foolishness of his youth.\n\nA girl who still has feelings for her ex? Thats great. A guy who wants to hedge his bets? Cool. Thats the kind of messy we dont get in our films. And it would have been great to see these characters actually deal with this, get over it, or get past it. Figure things out. But no, this film wasnt interested in dealing with the mess. Instead, it just wanted to cheaply dish out a message. Figuring things out requires talking things through, actually growing up. A message, on the other hand, just requires a speech, delivered by a grown-up (code for Mommy/Daddy).\n\nI am not even sure I got the message right. Its ok to have a secret life online, and if you love someone, you shouldn’t want to know about it, or question it? Keeping aside the morality of this or whatever, I dont think the film even earned this message. Yogi and Nikita were victims of online nastiness but Pradeep and his friends were perpetrators. And somehow the message puts them all on the same page?\n\nI thought that the “insta” tunnel was such a clever idea, and such a vivid take on how horrendous the online world is, especially for women. But that seemed to be the exact opposite reaction to what Pradeep’s character had in that scene. It made me wonder if cyber bullying is all normalized now, or if this is just good old victim-shaming.\n\nOr maybe it was just Pradeep’s acting which didn’t work for me at all. I wonder if he shopped around for actors and no one wanted to pick this up. In a film like this, chemistry between the leads would have made all the difference. But that requires better writing, and better directing. This film hardly had any dialogue. It was mostly people talking past each other, or speechifying. I kept thinking that if snapchats and tweets turned into a script, this is what it might look like. And maybe thats the point? Thats what Love Today is?\n\nWatched this movie over the weekend. In my evaluation, it’s a light entertainment or time pass stuff. While it had potential for layers both in the story and in the performances, I felt both areas came off half baked. Regarding acting, Pradeep would be better of staying behind the camera. Does not seem to have the ability to emote, some of his expressions seem to imitate Dhanush. The central theme which I seemed to gather out of the movie is that while young people today seem to be very frivolous and impulsive in their approach to relationships, good relationships are always built on the timeless values of trust and faith, as has been the case all the time. While this theme is all right, the problem with the movie is that there should have been a balance between the extremes of impulsiveness and that of faith and trust, and it is not there. The situations created to narrate the impulsive behavior are so extreme that it is difficult to also include faith and trust within the same behavioral bracket. This is where the immaturity of the director as a film maker is coming out. This imbalance is what is throwing up many questions, and the movie becomes a case of ‘could have been…’. The lead actors were just adequate and the veterans Sathyaraj and Radhika had very minimal scope. Overall, not bad but could have been made great!"
