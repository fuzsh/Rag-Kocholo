        "text": "After a mixed response to Enai Noki Paayum Thota, director Gautham Vasudev Menon is now back again with his next outing, Queen, a web series based on the life of Tamil Nadu’s former Chief Minister, J Jayalalitha. This web series is partly biopic (based on true events) and partly fictional and it is directed by GVM and Prasath Murugesan of Kidaari fame. The web series has released today (December 14) as already announced and all the 11 episodes are out now for public viewing.\n\nThe series will track down the life of Shakthi Seshadri, played by Anikha, Anjana Jayaprakash and Ramya Krishnan in three different time periods. The series is now streaming on MX Player platform and unlike other streaming platforms, this one can be used for free. The series is streaming in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and Bengali languages. The best language to opt is the English/Tamil version which has been shot originally.\n\nThe other versions have only been dubbed. Queen has been written by Reshma Ghatala, Gautham Menon’s close friend, who also penned the story of the director’s Neethane En Ponvasantham. The initial reports and reviews have been coming in favour of the series and we will have to wait for few more days to know how it is received by the audience.\n\nQueen has music composed by ENPT sensation, Darbuka Siva and cinematography by S.R.Kathir, Velraj, and Manikandan. For now, follow the link provided below the images to catch the full web series.
