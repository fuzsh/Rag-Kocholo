        "text": "With film, the director gave a sense of the unexpected satisfaction, he wrote more scenes and characters he had created to make fun of. I mean not only his usual skill and time to participate in the worship Ganesh Gautam equipped with a new one in the pictures, we did not see much until now, a feeling that the youth never gives up. His role in taking nee thane en ponvasantham songs forward the fight to ensure that the couple did not have enough time to sink the ship, now and then fit the puzzle. Keeping Ilayaraja songs, has already won the hearts. nee thane en ponvasantham songs but for those of you who are looking forward to the music videos, you can now reduce your expectations as well.\n\nGautham's effect kicks in, and the music is not really the dream sequences. The cost of sticking to the story, that does not mean much when watching his videos separately, the good and the bad ones. They are, in fact, from the nee thane en ponvasantham songs traditional music of a song you're going to be distracted. And sadly, you can enjoy the maestro's tunes, or when one or Gautham's describing. Another feature film and art direction helped suits, the camera becomes.\n\nOne always expects a bunch of close up shots of love, but it's far too MSPrabhu and Om Prakash camera to capture the emotions are not good. In some scenes, the actors actually breaks Gautam went without a long -term impact is not even the cameras are closing in on their faces. Also, nee thane en ponvasantham songs they show off their skills to the team for the exotic locations or eye -catching action, does a good job of making the most of what's available. Although the whole package seems very appealing, Gautam telling the story of a few features have been left on the block. All known hit -and-miss affair, but nee thane en ponvasantham songs a few things appear monotonous Figure Income.\n\nThe lyrics appear alongside each other, and quickly follow through. BGMs stand nee thane en ponvasantham songs out just fine, but in the latter half of the film, and quickly change the look absurd. Right at the very end, to the delight of spectators cheered and then there are many places, in some cases, a lack of logic, and some unconvincing dialogue, rather strikingly stand out and refuse to film with a happy ending. But, nevertheless, a lot of talking points about the film to the audience, and they have long chats about the real -life images can be helped draw bridges. Overall, the number of young people to be successful hits beads.\n\nIman, a name which is very popular with a lot of houses in Tamil Nadu today released to packed houses. Ilayaraja's score fell in love with nee thane en ponvasantham songs it after listening to this album got around to watching the trailer and making guesses. But, now that we are in the picture the green grass on the other side are going to find much in fact, it's finally here. Gautham Menon slowly toward love itself. Some fans even \" Love King nee thane en ponvasantham songs \" began to call him.\n\nIn his last vitivi out a similar picture, people got a wonderful response. Despite all the obstacles, he continued his films in earnest, and at any point of time can give spice. But truth be told, we nee thane en ponvasantham songs will probably see the new economic policy, and if you take a closer look at the day of his release, which led to the most profound and personal Gautham Menon film is very different. In all honesty, Iman 's biggest strength is the way it should be connecting fans. A story, lead actor, a passionate performer and some mind-blowing music - which we have seen in the past with little success formulas Gautam is movies.\n\nAt this time, he weaves the story a little differently, and ( Raghu ) varan and Nitya life takes us through three different life stages. Small details that lead you towards your fond memories, and make you laugh at least a few times in one way or the other. Love taking back in any way is always the nee thane en ponvasantham songs focal point, it's the ego clashes, melt quite a bit of the dialogue, or the story does not have the background. Whenever an idea he has been the star of a film director Gautham 's a ton of skills demands, requires a lot of skill. Jeeva, the shoe fits and does not look good this time around.\n\nSome of the songs, along with some common dialogue and a comedic sidekick actor, female fans are pretty fed up with male colleagues to push her ​​to bits and do not overdo. On the other hand, Samantha confuses the hell out of a textbook and the heroine herself, and her fans. That 's the pleasure of finding unity in their own lives the good news for the audience nee thane en ponvasantham songs becomes. A change, Nitya real heroines, and a lot more than his individual images should be credited back to Gautam screen. Varaitalilum adds extra weight to the role of his character."
