        "text": "When the trailer was out it was nothing less than interesting. It did look like an offbeat film but I was sure that Ranbir Kapoor going to give a performance par excellence in his deaf and mute character. And when the songs released, I immediately fell in love with the soundtrack. One of the best soundtracks released in Hindi in recent times (And also one of the finest work of Pritam I‚Äôd say).\n\nBarfi! That is the name of Ranbir‚Äôs character in this movie who was actually named as Murphy after the popular radio brand. And due to the fact that he is mute and deaf and he mispronounce (he tried actually) his name as Barfi. He is a guy who will make his surroundings happy with his cute antics. Despite his disabilities he do manage to live his life as happy as others. Later, he fall in love with Shruti who is on holiday at Darjeeling and her marriage is just three months away. Floored by Barfi‚Äôs antics and the way he live, Shruti also fall for him. That‚Äôs when the magical kiss happens. When Shruti‚Äôs mother came to the know of this, she somehow convinced Shruti to marry her fianc√©e and not Barfi. Barfi also, later, at a point sacrifice his love for the lady and let her marry her fiance, Ranjit so that she can lead a hppy and comfortable life. Heavy heartedly, the lovers parted to their own ways. Did Barfi find his love of life? Did Shruti marry her fiance? What do Jhilmil ( who was introduced in the middle of romantic scenes between Barfi and Shruti) has to do with this tale of triangle love? Answers to these questions unfold as the story moves on interestingly.\n\nApart from all the love sequences, the movie is high on comedy. The humor in this film is unforced yet you will laugh seeing the acts of Barfi. We‚Äôve may read that many stars say that comedy is very difficult but when Ranbir do it seems like comedy is his forte. Mind you, he has no dialogues yet he pull off the comedy scenes tremendously well. All the chasing scenes between Barfi and the policeman are sure to made one laugh out loud.\n\nPriyanka Chopra as Jhilmil Chatterjee. What a transformation she has undergone. Totally, de-glam role and a role she have never played before and she pulled it off super convincingly. Expect her to give tough competition to the likes of Vidya Balan (Kahaani) and Kareena Kapoor (Heroine).\n\nIleana D‚ÄôCruz as Shruti. Looks absolutely gorgeous and stunning. I find her to be sexy even when she‚Äôs clad in sarees üòâ Initially, I had an impression about her that she can‚Äôt act but then she was quite impressive in Nanban. In this movie she totally proved that she can ACT! She was brilliant as Shruti Sengupta. Her body language, expressions and emotions were perfect. In short, she is the best debutant of 2012 in Bollywood.\n\nAnd Ranbir Kapoor. Totally a charmer. World class performer he is. Emotions, romance and histrionics come easily for this guy. He is a rare talent. Surely, he will sweep all the awards for best actor category just like he did for the last year release, Rockstar.\n\nThe other supporting casts such as Rupa Ganguly, Ashish Vidhyarthi and Saurabh Shukla done a commendable job. All fit into their roles perfectly.\n\nThe music by Pritam is something very new from him. The songs already garnered overwhelming response from music lovers. The songs just sets the mood for the situations perfectly and they were pictures poetically. The background score has some international touch. It feels cold just like the climate of Darjeeling and Kolkata.\n\nThe film‚Äôs cinematography is poetic and very very beautiful. People may find themselves dislike many other aspects of the film (which is rare) but not the cinematography. Each frame looks beautiful and each scene shot aesthetically. Ravi Varman done a marvellous job.\n\nThe film is set in three different time phases, 1972, 1978 and present day. Hence, the screenplay moves to these different phases of time but it was never confusing as the editing process was neatly done.\n\nAnurag Basu who was much acclaimed for his earlier releases like Life‚Ä¶In A Metro and Gangster, done an extraordinary job. This directorial of him is a gem in Indian cinema. Kudos to him for making such film. He tries to weave in magic and happiness in all the scene.\n\nThis film is a noble attempt. Brilliantly directed by Anurag Basu and fantastic performances by the three leading actors this type of film rarely come out of Indian cinema. IT is a MUST watch and you‚Äôll leave the cineplex with a smile.\n\nBarfi! ‚Äì It is a sweet and magical film fuelled up with brilliant performances and miss it at your own risk.\n\nP.S.: Barfi! is India‚Äôs entry to Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nRight from the time the film was announced it was constantly in news. First, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was roped in to do this film. And later, she was dropped out of it due to her pregnancy. This news created great buzz for the film and later when Madhur Bhandarkar roped in Kareena Kapoor, his original choice for the film, there were great expectations for the film.\n\nMadhur Bhandarkar is a filmmaker who is known for his realistic films. His last outing, Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji, a romantic-comedy film bombed at box office and he‚Äôs back to what he does the best, realistic films. This time as the title suggests he chose to portray life of an actress and Bollywood as his platform.\n\nThis film is a fictional portrayal of Mahi Arora, who is a star and whose career is currently going downhill. She can‚Äôt take it when her popularity is slowly fading and newcomers start to steal the limelight. Additionally, her love affairs with a married superstar, Aryan Khanna and manipulations in the industry. All these and more, start to disturb her and she sought consolation in cigarettes and alcohol. What Mahi did to maintain her position of a star? Did she found the love of her life? Answers the these questions form the crux of the remaining plot.\n\nThe movie offers us so much of drama with high number of clich√©s. The film has gay designers, MMS scandals, affair of an actress with married superstar, bad mouthing attitude among heroines and cigarettes and alcohol addiction among the film industry. If this wasn‚Äôt enough there is a sequence where a film star and cricketer are in a relationship. All these are nothing that no one knows. Media keeps us up to date on such issues :p\n\nThe glam quotient in the film is extremely high. Be it Kareena or anyone else, there‚Äôs scope for skin show. But Kareena‚Äôs gracious skin show might be well received by her male fans. One can‚Äôt help but to compare it with last year hit, The Dirty Picture. TDP was equally balanced between glamour and entertainment but Heroine has excessive drama. The entertainment element quite missing in this latest directorial of Madhur Bhandarkar.\n\nKareena Kapoor. This film is all the way her show. She has never done a film like this. She sizzles throughout the film. Her looks in the song ‚ÄúMain Heroine Hoon‚Äù were spectacular. Full of glitz and glam. Yet, her performance was excellent too. She portrayed Mahi with sincerity. Towards the end, post MMS scandal her performance was a revelation. No dialogues but only expressions. Undeniably, one of the best work of Kareena. She‚Äôll give tough competition to Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra in award season next year.\n\nAnd there are supporting characters like Arjun Rampal who plays a married superstar, Aryan Khanna in affair with Mahi and their relationship is on-and-off. He was quite good but nothing to rave about his performance. Randeep Hooda as the vice president of Indian cricket team was impressive. Shahana Goswami who played a cameo as the Bengali actress, Promita Roy scorched the screen with her small presence. Ranvir Shorey was brilliant in his small portrayal of the Bengali film director, Tapanda. And there‚Äôs Helen as Shagufta Rizvi with who Mahi finds peace and motivation. Divya Dutta as the PRO is notable too. There were also many other actors who made small presence in the film as part of the film fraternity.\n\nThe music was nothing to write home about. The songs make for a pleasant listen and the much hyped item number, ‚ÄúHalkat Jawani‚Äù is the best offering of the soundtrack. As for the BGM it seems like Salim-Sulaiman duo recycled their work of Fashion.\n\nThe screenplay of the film is a bit slow, thanks to the excessive drama. Each frame of the film looks rich and full of glitz and glam.\n\nIn a nutshell, this film is totally belongs to Kareena and the lady worked hard for the film. This is easily one of her best works but not of Madhur Bhandarkar. He tries to deliver reality of film industry but shows us drama and clich√©s instead.\n\nHeroine ‚Äì Watch it for Kareena‚Äôs feisty performance.\n\nDisclaimer: I am no musician or a critic. This post is merely my personal opinion on this album.\n\nWhen the film was announced, there were strong speculations regarding the film‚Äôs music. It was said that A.R. Rahman would be the music composer for this film which was later proved to be false. Later, it was also said that Gautham Vasudev Menon will be joining hands with Harris Jeyaraj for this film. Even that news turned out to be not true. Finally, GVM himself announced that the film‚Äôs music will be composed by none other than Maestro Ilaiyaraja. Since then, there was great expectation among music lovers for this film‚Äôs soundtrack. It was released on September 1st and garnered overwhelming response.\n\nNow, my opinions about the soundtrack. I am no one to comment about Ilaiyaraja‚Äôs music or him but lately, I felt that his music is not mesmerizing enough like it used to be. So, when Maestro and GVM come together I was having great expectations on this soundtrack, given the fact that GVM‚Äôs films have great songs.\n\nSaayndhu Saayndhu.\n\nYuvan Shankar Raja and Ramya NSK rendered vocals to the song. It is undeniably a beautiful song. Yuvan‚Äôs vocals exude a feel of laziness but that is what worked big time in this song while Ramya provides a good company to him. A sureshot chartbuster.\n\nKaatrai Konjam\n\nA beautiful humming from a male voice leads to this song. Karthik enters the song, vocally, and make listeners fall in love with the song. The violin touch to the song is noteworthy. A typical Ilaiyaraja number.\n\nMudhal Murai\n\nThe rock touch in the beginning and throughout the song make you want to listen to this song again and again. Sunidhi Chauhan‚Äôs rendition is perfect. Perfect pitching, pronunciation and accent. We‚Äôve never heard such song from Sunidhi in Tamil. The ‚ÄúNeethane En Ponvasantham‚Äù bit is magical. MY pick of the album.\n\nVaanam Mella\n\nThe female harmony in the beginning is brilliant. The heavy orchestration is blissful to listen. Ilaiyaraja‚Äôs rendition is the highlight of this number. Bela Shende did a decent job in this song. Listen it for the orchestration and Ilaiyaraja‚Äôs singing.\n\nYennodu Vaa Vaa\n\nMaestro‚Äôs touch shines throughout the song. Easily overshadows Karthik‚Äôs rendition. Makes for a pleasant listen.\n\nPengal Yendral\n\nAnother song which begins with heavy instrumentation. A song which tells about a guy‚Äôs disappointment (or anger) on his lover. Something different from Ilayaraja‚Äôs usual composition. Yuvan lifts up this number with his powerful rendition.\n\nSatru Munbu\n\nThis song delivers the pain of the girl in love. Ramya at her best in this song. She got the feel of the song perfectly in her vocals. One might need to listen to this song repeatedly to fall in love with it.\n\nPudikkala Maamu\n\nA youthful number. Foot tapping number. Karthik‚Äôs portion moves into ‚Äòkuthu‚Äô style which somehow I felt odd.\n\nVerdict: Maestro‚Äôs back with a BANG and how!!! The best Tamil soundtrack by far of this year. Musical extravaganza.\n\nP.S.: The trailer of this film released on the same day. Watch it here.\n\nEver since the film announced, there was humongous hype among Ajith fans and movie buffs. Additionally, this film is the first ever prequel in Indian film industry. After the super grand success of Mankatha, Ajith fans‚Äô expectation on this film was sky high.\n\nStory of this film could be fit in one line. How David Billa became a don? This is the very story of this film which traces the root of David Billa, a common man turned to don. It was the screenplay that made this film more interesting and a success. The beginning credits, one of the highlights in the film. They‚Äôve applied the phrase ‚Äúa picture is worth a thousand words‚Äù in the beginning credits where we‚Äôre shown pictures of David Billa and his family and what later happened to him that led him to become a don.\n\nThis is clearly a one man show entirely belongs to Ajith. His expressions, voice modulation, and dialogue delivery shows his commitment to bring alive the character of David Billa on-screen. If anyone would watch this movie in theatres more than once, that would be possible only because of the impacts of Ajith‚Äôs acting.\n\nThe ladies in the film are totally wasted. Parvathy Omanakuttan‚Äôs much hyped debut was not an impressive one. She tries to emote when needed but that was not very convincing portrayal. Bruna Abdullah used in the movie to add up the oomph and fulfill the glam quotient in the film. To conclude, both Bruna and Parvathy suffer bad characterizations in the film and made forgettable debuts in Tamils.\n\nVidyut Jamwal was convincing as Dmitri and did a commendable job. Sudhanshu Pandey too did a good job but his character could be given much more footage to expose his villainous side. Rahman appear in just one scene and it is a blink-and-miss type of role. Other actors like Ilavarasu, Manoj K.Jayan, Yog Japee and others gave what required from them.\n\nMusic is one of the biggest strength for the film. Yuvan Shankar Raja done a brilliant job in this department, be it songs or the background score. R.D Rajashekar‚Äôs cinematography is laudable and Suresh URS‚Äôs did a very neat job in the editing department. Madurai Ponnu‚Äôs colourful picturization and the CGI effects in Unakullae Mirugam are visual treats.\n\nChakri Toleti directed the movie very well after debuted in critically acclaimed Unnaipol Oruvan. His effort to fulfill audiences‚Äô expectations and give a good end product is evident in the way he directed this prequel. Hardcore Ajith fans will be very much pleased by this film. In short, Billa 2 is stylishly made gangster flick with less substance.\n\nBilla 2 ‚Äì Ajith! Ajith! Ajith!\n\nThanks to the strategic marketing done by the production house, the film did create much needed hype before its release. Also, thanks to Habib Faisal‚Äôs critically acclaimed Do Dooni Chaar and brilliant performance of Parineeti Chopra in her debut film, Ladies v/s Ricky Bahl. Fans eagerly waited to see their next outing. This film marked the debut by Arjun Kapoor, Boney Kapoor‚Äôs son with his first wife, Mona Kapoor.\n\nIshaqzaade is a love tale between two people from different religion. Indian cinema is very comfortable with this subject. From Bombay to Ekk Deewana Tha this has been the main subject in the films. But, it is the director‚Äôs creativity that makes the audiences glued to their seats to the very end of the movie.\n\nZoya Qureshi is a Muslim college girl who aspires to become the MLA of her town, Almore, following the footpath of her father. Zoya who wish to be an MLA is a strong-willed girl who has no tolerance towards any kind of nonsense. Parma Chauhan is a rough and tough guy from Hindu origin who helps his grandfather in political campaigns to win the upcoming election against the Qureshis. Both are rebellious towards each other since their school. Starting with hatred, gradually, Zoya and Parma became fond of each other and fell in love. How their political and religion background affects their love and did the couple united in the end? Answers to these questions form the rest of the plot.\n\nArjun Kapoor is very convincing as Parma. It is a very good debut performance. His wicked laugh is the main attraction of his character. The way this city lad pulled off such rustic rural character is impressive. He is a talent to watch out.\n\nZoya seems like a role tailor-made for Anushka Sharma (the original choice for the role) but Parineeti Chopra did not disappoint at all. Parineeti Chopra is the star in this film. She is the lifeline of the movie and her portrayal of strong-willed Zoya Qureshi is super brilliant. She can emote very well. Be it sentimental or being mischievous it comes easily for her. Given proper roles she could be the in the line of actresses like Kajol and Vidya Balan.\n\nThe chemistry between the lead pair is magical that you would start to care for them. It is the main reason audience could easily relate to the love story of Zoya and Parma. Gauhar Khan and other supporting actors did their job well. Everyone gave what required from them.\n\nMusic plays an important part in this film. Songs like Pareshaan and Ishaqzaade are very much hummable and will be remembered by music lovers for long. Amit Trivedi has outdone himself in this section again. Background Score by Ranjit Baroth was loud just the way required by the storyline. Hemant Chaturvedi‚Äôs cinematography is very impressive and has brought out the rural panoramas alive on screen. Aarti Bajaj‚Äôs editing was very neatly done.\n\nHabib Faisal taken very clich√©d subject and gave it a new perception. It was something new to see that this love story of two people from different religion also woven with some political elements. Faisal brought out the best performance from all of his actors.\n\nIn short, Ishaqzaade is a rustic love story of two people from different religion and catered to audiences with different treatment. Watch it for the brilliant performances of the lead pair.\n\nIshaqzaade ‚Äì Parineeti Chopra‚Äôs show all the way.\n\nThe moment the above mentioned song gone viral in the net world, the expectation bar for the film was set high! After much hype, the Aishwarya‚Äôs directorial debut released on 30th March.\n\nThe movie starts with a scene where family members mourn over the dead body of a guy and eventually we got to know it is of Ram (Dhanush). So, there we know the ending, that the leading man would be dead but the question is how. From there we see the movie through Ram‚Äôs wife, Janani‚Äôs (Shruti Haasan) flashbacks about their life together. Their love story and what made Ram to be on the death-bed ( this part narrated by Sunder Ramu who played the character of Sendhil) forms the remaining plot of the movie.\n\nThe film‚Äôs leading man, Dhanush. He portrayed the character of Ram to near-flawless. Precisely, the character was tailor-made for him. You just could not imagine someone else in that character. After all, he is a National Award winner. From a school-going teen to a man with bipolar disorder, his performance was laudable. At a point, you‚Äôll start to feel care for Ram and that just shown how well Dhanush enacted the character.\n\nJanani, played by Shruthi Haasan. Simply amazing portrayal. Her eyes and tears did the most talking. We seen her crying more than smiling in this film but that was what she need to do. We cannot complain about that as she did not bore us with all that cries. Such maturity in her performance and she was super convincing as the school-going Janani. We can see she is really talented as an actor.\n\nThe supporting casts were absolutely good in their respective roles. Sivakarthikeyan was the humor factor of the film. Sunder Ramu, his character Sendhil was one of the most important character in the film and he pulled it off very well. Prabhu, Banupriya and Rohini appeared in character somewhat seemed like extended cameos but their job was commendable.\n\nOverall, no complaints in the acting department led by Dhanush and Shruti Haasan except the Mayakkam Enna hangover feeling in Dhanush‚Äôs characterization.\n\nMusic by the newcomer Anirudh Ravichander was super brilliant. The songs are already rocking the charts. His background score was an integral part of the film. This work of him will surely fetch him number of awards for Best Music Direction next year. The Idhazhin Oram background score needs a special mention.\n\nCinematography by Velraj was awesome. The picturization of the songs were fresh except for Kolaveri which was not up to the mark. Kola Baskar‚Äôs cuts were very neatly done and the product was a delight to watch.\n\nComing to the most important part, direction. Aishwarya chose a dark subject for her debut directorial venture and worked very hard on it. A student of Selvaraghavan she is, showed us the film in the way her guru would have done it. Despite dare to choose a dark subject, she could have handled it well and made the film to be really different. Some clich√©s could be avoided. For example, when the boy following, the girl would not fall in love but once she started to notice his absence she would fall in love with him. Another one is when Janani‚Äôs sister started to talk. Apart from those, one thing that was very unclear to me was why the leading pair got married in a pub? This is something I felt was too much, even if Maniratnam would have done it! Why the parents were not informed about Dhanush‚Äôs condition? Such things could have been done in a better way and this movie would have been the dream debut of any director. Yet, kudos to Aishwarya for the way she handled the subject being a new filmmaker and hoping for more quality products from her.\n\n3 ‚Äì Watch it for the performances and music."
