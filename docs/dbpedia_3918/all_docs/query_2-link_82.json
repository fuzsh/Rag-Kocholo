        "text": "It is a day to honour and cherish the everlasting and beautiful bond you share with your closest friends. Friendship has been one of the engrossing themes in various Tamil films that have captured the audience's attention. Friendship goals have been inspired by films, with cinematic bonds demonstrating how true friendship outlasts everything and overcomes all obstacles.\n\nOn the occasion of Friendship Day, let's take a look at some of the memorable Tamil films that celebrate friendship.\n\nSakuntalai (1940): This is one of the first films in Tamil cinema to focus on female friendships.
