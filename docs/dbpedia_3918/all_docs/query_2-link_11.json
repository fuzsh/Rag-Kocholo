        "text": "Reel on reel\n\nAt a time when single theatres are either closing down or being converted into malls or multiplexes, here comes director Saravana Jeevan’s film Parimala Thiraiyarangam . It is the story of running a theatre business and how if managed well single screens can survive the competition. Hero Vikas, who is a die-hard film buff, works as a projector operator in a decrepit theatre named after the owner’s (Kishore) sister — Parimala (played by Sanusha). Vikas is shocked when he discovers that Kishore has decided to close down the theatre. Vikas convinces Kishore to make one last ditch effort to save the theatre by renovating and modernising it, which the latter reluctantly agrees to. Parimala Thiraiyarangam is re-opened by actor Arya playing himself, to a tumultuous reception. In a parallel story, Vikas falls in love with Parimala only to be objected to by Kishore. Later, understanding his sister’s seriousness about the relationship, Kishore gives in but finds that Vikas has mysteriously disappeared. What happens next forms the climax of the movie.\n\nLove triumphs\n\nDirector Salangaidurai has based the theme of his forthcoming film Kandharvan on love as described in mythology. The lead pair, Kadhir and Honey Rose deeply love each other. Despite problems and squabbles their relationship remains strong. Talking about her role, Honey Rose says, “I play a college girl, who is brought up by her father and falls in love with a truck driver. I face terrible yet remain undeterred. The message is if your love is true it will always win.”\n\nChild star to a hero\n\nAs a child artiste Dilip Kumar did more than 30 films in Telugu. He has now graduated to playing the hero in Tamil films Mayyam Kondein and Vinnil Thonriya Natchatram . Niveda Reddy stars opposite him in the second film. Meanwhile, Dilip is excited about the trilingual Footsteps directed by Sasi Sankar (Perazhagan starring Suriya). “ Footsteps also features Rosin Jolly while Malayalam actor Dileep will appear in a guest role.” The shooting of Vinnil Thonriya Natchatram will commence shortly and Dilip plays a college student who goes abroad and falls in love with a girl who is also new to the country. There are the usual parental objections but we manage to remain in love,” says Dilip Kumar.\n\nFamily saga\n\nGautham Vasudev Menon’s tri-lingual film Neethaane En Ponvasantham is making brisk progress with simultaneous shooting in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi underway at a city location. Actors Jiiva, Nani and Aditya Roy Kapoor play the lead in the respective languages while Samantha plays the heroine in all three. The only other actor who is common to all three productions is Anupama Kumar who plays the hero’s mother, her husband is played by Kanwaljit Singh in Hindi and Ravi Raghavendra in Tamil and Telugu. Says Anupama about the film, “The hero is a carefree person and his parents are concerned about his lack of seriousness. The director has scripted the role of the parents very well to make it integral to the story. The father being a teacher is a disciplinarian and stresses on the sons being well-educated. Finally, it’s love and understanding between the parents that stand as an example to the children.”\n\nTime to smile"
