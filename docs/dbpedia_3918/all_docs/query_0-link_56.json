        "text": "âIt was a tribute to my fans in North Indiaâ - Anirudh\n\nRAAC Academy of Dance in Kilpauk was brimming with anticipation as the members of the dance studio and winners of Behindwoods’ Ethir Neechal contest who were given the opportunity to meet the young musical sensation Anirudh along with the leads of the film Siva Karthikeyan, Nandita and their director Senthil.\n\nFollowing an overwhelming response to the contest, only 10 lucky winners were shortlisted to be awarded with the chance to meet and greet the stars of the film. The lucky chosen ones could share their opinions about Ethir Neechal’s music with its creator and the film’s key members. The platform also provided them the opportunity to direct questions to the actors, composer and director.\n\nAfter being greeted by flowers the team of Ethir Neechal proceeded to interact with our contest winners. The lucky winners had quite a few interesting and quirky questions to ask all our special guests who responded to nearly all of them in the same jovial manner the questions were asked.\n\nOne of our winners boldly asked the film’s director, Senthil, if his Ethir Neechal was a remake of the yesteryear classic starring Nagesh, the director quickly responded by saying it was not a remake but it will bear resemblance to the core idea of the classic film in terms of how the protagonist overcomes his hardships. One winner asked Siva Karthikeyan if he would ever do an action role, and the TV anchor turned actor replied by saying that he’s not on the lookout for any particular roles and he will choose from the offers that he gets, based on his own limitations.\n\nOne lucky winner took the opportunity to present the beautiful actress Nandita with a rose and spoke to her at length about her aspirations in Tamil cinema. Many questions were posted to the film’s musical hero Anirudh, and most of the questions revolved around the title track. Anirudh replied by saying after the massive reach and success of the music of ‘3’, he decided to pay tribute to his fans in North India and hence the idea of roping in Yo Yo Honey Singh to contribute his rap portions.\n\nThe dance team at RAAC academy entertained the guests with their swift dance moves before the event’s special guests posed for pictures with the winners. If the day was not memorable enough for the winners, they each received a copy of Ethir Neechal’s music to remind them of their special day."
