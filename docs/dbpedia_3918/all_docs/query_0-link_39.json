        "text": "Gautham Menon and Prasath Murugesan have joined hands to direct a web series titled Queen, based on the novel of the same name written by Anita Sivakumaran. The web series consisting of 11 episodes in Season 1 stars Ramya Krishnan in the lead role.\n\nRamya Krishnan essays the role of Shakthi Seshadri, a school topper and sought-after heroine, who is pushed into politics. The role of the young Shakthi is played by Anikha of Viswasam and Yennai Arindhaal fame, while Anjana Jayaprakash plays Shakthi from 18 to 30.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, Queen has been making a lot of noise since even before it went on floors. Many reports said that it was based on the life of J Jayalalithaa, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The web series will be released on December 14 on MX Player. Ahead of the release, Gautham Vasudev Menon (GVM) and Ramya Krishnan (RK) speak to IndiaToday.in about the process and what Queen is all about.\n\nQ: You claim that Queen isn't a story based on J Jayalalithaa's life. How did the project happen?\n\nGVM: There is a book titled Queen, written by Anita Sivakumaran. The team of MX Player bought the rights and they approached us to make a web series on it. My partner and Neethane Pon Vasantham writer Reshma Ghatala adapted it into a screenplay, which I loved. It was a very inspiring story of somebody who is forced to quit studies and thrown into the film industry for survival and how she enters politics. That's how Queen happened.\n\nQ: Did you read the book? How much of it is adapted into the script?\n\nGVM: I haven't read the book. When Reshma decided she's going to write it and take it forward, I decided that I need not read it. The main character's name in the book is Kalai, I think, and it's got its moments.\n\nQ: It's got a strong resemblance to J Jayalalithaa. How do you tackle it?\n\nGVM: We have taken some inspiration from the book, and came up with the story. If you find the resemblance, then it's not my fault, I guess.\n\nQ: Ramya Krishnan plays the lead in Queen. Were there any other choices for the lead role?\n\nGVM: No, we were hoping that she would do it. The only doubt that we had was whether she will venture into the digital platform. We gave her a narration for two to three hours and convinced her with the writing. She immediately said yes.\n\nQ: What did you find the most fascinating about Shakthi Seshadri in Queen?\n\nRK: Someone who became stronger with each hurdle in her life. Every step of her life was full of hurdles and how she overcame them and became one of the strongest women you can ever see.\n\nGVM: Prasath Murugesan and I directed her equally. When I gave her the lines, she was either moved, surprised or in awe. I think the character hits you... since she was getting into the mood because she was affected by the lines. I could see that she was moved by some parts. It's a story that will resonate with a lot of people.\n\nQ: Two directors have directed 11 episodes. What did you do to keep the tone consistent?\n\nGVM: If you see the entire season, you will know that we have maintained a similar tone. There was a lot of work that went in into it. There were times that we were shooting simultaneously in different studios. I remember Indrajith Sukumaran (playing thr ole of GMR in the series) completing Prasath's shooting in the morning and coming to me in the evening. Reshma's script was written in English and hence we sat in the writing together and collaborated. Across both our episodes, we had one costume designer and one art director. Before we went on floors, we discussed a lot.\n\nQ: Talk about Prasath's contribution to Queen.\n\nGVM: Prasath is strong with the Tamil political angle and we discussed a lot about of the film. I couldn't spend time on directing all the episodes and hence I asked Prasath to step in. It was nice for two directors to sit and work together. I'm looking to be some Abbas-Mastan at some point of time. I had a lot of inputs regarding the writing and it was a great experience.\n\nadvertisement\n\nQ: Queen has a lot of resemblance to J Jayalalithaa. What would you say?\n\nRK: We cannot say that there is no resemblance to the political leader. But, the bottom line is that it is not her story. If you find the resemblance, I like it. I'm a big fan of hers and a huge admirer. Gautham asked me to be myself and react to what's present in the scene.\n\nGVM: It's largely a fictional show. Most of the portions in the series are just interpretations. When I read the story, I could only think of Ramya. I wanted her to be herself with no make-up and no prosthetics, and I knew that if we get into it, it won't look nice.\n\nQ: During the press meet, Gautham said that you hesitated for a while because it was your first web series. Why is that?\n\nadvertisement\n\nRK: Actually, I wasn't hesitating. And I very well know that web series is the future and this was being made by him with a powerful role for me to play. I didn't hesitate.\n\nQ: Why wasn't Queen taken as a full-fledged film?\n\nGVM: The first season of Queen will end with Shakthi Seshadri's entry into politics. And it's a story that could not be said in just two hours. The first season will chronicle her life from 12 to 44 years.\n\nQ: The sensibilities of Prasath and Gautham Menon are different. How did you manage to strike a balance?\n\nGVM: If I had written this, my sensibilities would have come into play. I am a very reluctant writer and I have always wanted to collaborate. I wanted to break out of my way and I think it happens to every filmmaker. There has got to be some sort of metamorphosis. The writing of Queen was staring me in my face and I came in to give it the visual imagery that it needed.\n\nQ: What did a female writer like Reshma bring to the table?\n\nGVM: Reshma went through a lot while writing the story and I knew she was crying. We were there to support her and when I read the script, I could see it. So could Ramya and Prasath. The writing affected her so much.\n\nadvertisement\n\nQ: How much of the book has been adapted?\n\nGVM: Honestly, I don't know. So, here's the thing: you read any material, and you are inspired by it. You take moments from the story as the chapter heads and build it from there.\n\nQ: Is Shakthi's character romanticised for the series?\n\nGVM: That's what I liked about the writing as it wasn't romanticising Shakthi at all. She goes through the lows and highs of life and she appears selfish at times. She's vulnerable, emotional and awful at times. If I had written it, I might have glorified it because I tend to do it.\n\nQ: Will you do a biopic on Jayalalithaa later?\n\nRK: I'm a big fan of hers and I feel bad that I never got an opportunity to meet her. It's my honour that people consider I can reprise her role.\n\nALSO SEE | Queen teaser out: Ramya Krishnan presents an interesting tale on J Jayalalithaa\n\nALSO SEE | Queen: Trouble for web series on Jayalalithaa"
