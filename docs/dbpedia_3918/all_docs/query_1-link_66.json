        "text": "Yearning For Yaan!\n\nAt ‘Hangout with Jiiva’, fans of the star got up close and personal with him\n\nWhen Anbu, a medical student, called Jiiva ‘Thalaivaa’, the actor turned back to see who he was referring to. And then,he smiled and said ‘Thank you’ before going on to answer the youngster’s question.\n\nAnbu was one of the ten lucky winners of a fun-filled event called ‘Hangout with Jiiva’ at Marrybrown, Ispahani Centre. Selected from a contest that used the Augray App, the ten fans got an opportunity for a fun tête-à-tête with the star.\n\nHis upcoming film, Yaan, was obviously on top of the fans’ minds. Jiiva said: “Ravi K Chandran, the director of the film, has worked with small actors before this. Small stars like Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan (laughs) and, of course, the smallest of them all, Amitabh Bachchan! He is making his directorial debut after years of experience as a cinematographer in the industry. He brought out the best in me.”\n\nThe trailer of the action thriller, which stars Thulasi in the female lead, has already been praised for its rich look. “I want to do glossy films,” he said. “I’d like youngsters to watch my work. I have a son and want him to watch me sing, dance and fight on screen. Kids love all that – I’m investing in them big time. Even Mugamoodi, which didn’t do well, was loved by kids. You’ll have all those elements in this too.”\n\nThe film has been shot in Mumbai and various other locations in the world. “We shot in Morocco; at the same place where Inception was filmed,” he revealed. “In fact, that road you see in the trailer is the same location where Leonardo Di Caprio canned a few scenes.” Also close to the actor’s heart is learning from the stunt choreographers he trained with in Morocco. “Just like Ravi sir, they’ve also worked with small actors. Like Matt Damon (laughs). I was happy that they liked my work in the action sequences. After the schedule there, one of them gifted me the action gear that Matt had used. That was overwhelming.”\n\nJiiva is overwhelmed by Bollywood praise for the film’s trailer and songs. With Ranbir Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan having a word of encouragement for the entire team, Jiiva is a happy man. “Bollywood watches Tamil films keenly. They respect talent a lot.” So, is Bollywood on the cards, asked a fan. “I am ‘Raghu Thatha’ only in Hindi,” guffaws the actor, referring to a popular Tamil film dialogue. “I’m interested, yes, but not as a mainstream hero. I’d like to do something offbeat or perhaps play the villain in a mainstream project.”\n\nA Megabyte of Jiiva\n\nAs actor jiiva gears up for his upcoming Christmas release, endrendrum punnagai on December 20, he chats nineteen to the dozen with south scope during this fun photo shoot.\n\nI can recall the first time I met jiiva at his office, super good films. back then he was a celebrity judge on a popular dance show telecast in a regional channel, even back then, despite his privileged and wealthy background jiiva, with his cheerful, pleasing demeanor, jiiva came across as a simple guy who had a firm head on his shoulders. Today, all of us at south scope are extremely happy to see his rise to commercial success.\n\njiiva arrives at the venue of the shoot on time. Amidst the flurry of activity all around to get the shot ready for him, he grabs a subway sandwich and starts chatting away. I ask him about his Christmas and New Year plans. \"frankly speaking, i have no plans for christmas i am not going to be here in town. i may be away in morocco most probably, on a film shoot. there is frnctic activity going on now. by the end of this year, i want to finish a lot of things - my house, for example. then, a couple of my project too. my film endrendrum punnagai releasing on december 20th. i feel the timing of its release is very good. i have been working with this team for the last 2 years and to approach the release now is a great feeling. in addition to this, we have been waiting for my film Yaan - we've been hunting for locations, in fact. Morocco has been finalised and we will be shooting a couple of songs there. I am hoping for a march or April release for Yana. I’ve shouldered a big responsibility, you know, with these two films.\"\n\nJiiva pleasantly surprises me by saying that he doesn't believe in New Year resolutions. “I don't have any resolutions, because I don't believe in resolutions at all. Every year is a new year. Every day is a new day. So why mark out one day of the year for resolutions and burden yourself with it? What you can do for New Year's Day, you can do on any other day, right?\" he reasons with a laugh.\n\nWell put, indeed. So what does it feel like, being a decade old in kollywood?\n\n“I am thrilled to say the least. There are lots of people who came and went out of the industry. I can only say those 10 years on, I am proud and I am happy. There is some sort of satisfaction but not complete. I am still learning the medium, when I see legends and doyens who have spent over 25,30 or 50 years in the industry and I get a chance to work with them, the decade I have spent seems too short a time period. But then again when you insolate it, it's a big thing indeed. As an actor I have had the privilege of visiting different parts of the world, working with talented co-stars and some great directors and technical crew who have taught me tons about cinema, acting and much more. These last two years have been rollercoaster ride for me in cinema. It is like riding a tide. It has its high and low points, but is constantly exciting. And at the end of the day, I am having a jolly good ride!\"\n\nSo what about 100 years of Indian cinema?\n\n\"I am very proud of the fact that I am a part of Indian cinema, in its 100th year. Not many get this opportunity and privilege 100 years is a century and that reminds me of sachin tendulkar,\" he says continuing,” I have grown up watching sachin tendulkar's cricket I couldn’t forget over that moment when he was bidding farewell. I was in tears and recorded his farewell speech. I am sure many others would have done it too.\n\nWith the next CCL season approaching soon, Jiiva is kicked up about the whole thing, “every year we wait for November, December and January. We have a whale of a time as a team. We are ourselves totally, not as actors, but are individuals who are a part of a team. That’s a great feeling indeed. We bond with Telugu actors, we bond with Kannada actors... this year, and I don’t think we will have new teams. “jiiva‘s closest buddies in cal are Aarya, vishal, vishnu and vikranth. And he says that since Jayam Ravi will be-busy with his film, he might not be able to play CCL this time.\n\nI ask him about the current trends in the film industry. “The flavor of the season is comedy and it seems good. But then again, there have been instances when even comedy films have bombed at the box office. So have some action masala films too. But the best part is that the new wave of films has brought new talents in to the industry today”\n\nJiiva has always had the image of a grounded family guy and doting husband. I broach the topic with him and he says, “We are four brothers in all. I am the forth one. My brothers are more like friends to me; I am very close to Ramesh and Jeevan is ten years elder to me. We have seen the good and bad of life together. And we share a very good rapport. My father is my boss. And for the last six years, I have been a husband and thereafter a father myself. All this completes my world.” Jiiva tied the knot with Supriya in 2007. And together they have a son named Sparsha, who is three years old. “I have tripped on love of every kind with supriya. Short distance love, long distance love, childhood love, dating, courtship. When I think of the time she was in Delhi and later on in the US for over six years, all those reliance plans for calling, and every other mode of communication rushes to my mind now. The beautiful thing is that when I see sparsha, I can see all the love that I showered to supriya. It simply reflects on his face,” he says. He adds, “I am a good son, brother, husband, and father. I only don’t know how good I am as an actor,” he laughs.\n\nAbout sparsha he says, “This time for sparsha’s birthday, we didn’t want to lavish money on parties. Instead we wanted children from orphanages to come home and celebrate the birthday with him. Even next year, I want sparsha to visit some orphanage and learn important life lessons..” about his leisure time with supriya and sparsha, he fondly remembers the time they spent touring seven countries in Europe and the 2-3 days they spent in kodaikanal. His street food restaurant, 1 MegaBite (MB) is doing fairly in the city. “Once, I got talking with a friend at the airport and that’s when we planned to do this. We thought it was a very good thing and opened it up.”\n\nWasn’t there a buzz a while ago about jiiva floating his own production house? When we ask him about it he clearly dismisses the rumour saying, “We have a very good production house right now – super good films. I don’t want to start another one. My dad is my boss. We have been in this industry as super good films for 25 years now, having done a hundred films.”\n\nSo what has been his role in this production of the Vijay- starrer Jilla? “Nothing actually. All I have done is tweeting. My brother Ramesh is the co-producer and he has been really busy with the film.” Jiiva is on three projects including a home production, production 86 as it is tentatively called, because the title they chose was already registered by someone else. He also has a project with Rajesh, which is slated to start later.\n\nJiiva accepts the fact that films are a fickle business. :Life is not only about doing a film, and depending on whether it is a hit or flop, you celebrate or sad. I am happy to be doing other things as well. Right now, I am eagerly looking forward to finishing up my Villa on OMR, which will be ready for occupation in about six months from now.”\n\nDecoding The magic carpet Ride..\n\nVersatility is his forte. Jiiva enjoys the challenge of experimentation, the high that trying out different roles gives, and has managed to have a fairytale-like ride on the film industry’s magic carpet. He has left a lasting impression on acclaimed directors through his impeccable acting skills. His presence on screen works like a charm, the film fraternity viewing him as a most bankable star. From psychopath to lover boy, he has donned a range of roles early in his career and is now set for the release of ‘Endrendrum Punnagai’ this November, a partnership he is forging with Mueenudin Ahmed and quite a few top notchers in the industry. In this tete-a-tete with DC, he opens up about this much-awaited film, his childhood and his journey so far in the film industry.\n\nBeing a man of dedication to his role, Jiiva never fails to grab the attention of critics as he juggles commercial scripts and cult films, balancing the seeming contraries perfectly. “I don’t crave to try out different characters and roles all the time, but things seem to fall into place just at the right time for me, which has resulted in many roles that are close to my heart,” Jiiva says. Now, he clarifies, “Unlike, my previous films, ‘Endrendrum Punnagai’ is a feel-good movie, with love, emotions, comedy, all the elements in a right balance. It’s not a run-of-the-mill script as the movie portrays a pleasant story in a clean and light way.”\n\nJiiva pairs up with Trisha for the first time in this film and going by the trailers they are most likely going to be a hit on screen, dancing to the music of Harris Jayaraj. The pairing would have happened 10 years ago as Trisha was likely to sign his second film, ‘Thithikudhe’, which was then grabbed by Sridevi Vijayakumar. “Trisha is one of the most dedicated and fun-loving persons to work with. Her passion for acting and her professionalism in her career has impressed me,” he says.\n\nWhile he is meticulous about carrying off his part, Jiiva keeps up an interest in many behind-the-scenes pursuits as well, such as graphic designing, cinematography or anything that paves the way for a greater knowledge of the silver screen.\n\nIf he had not become an actor, he claims that he would have been an ardent traveller as he enjoys adventure, but with filmmaking being in the family — his father R.B.Choudary’s Supergood Films has produced more than 70 films till date — it was not unusual at all for him to be interested in the production business.\n\n“When I completed my schooling, I never knew that I would become an actor. Instead, I sharpened my multimedia skills. I also had an adequate knowledge about producing a film as I would help my dad with the statements for our production house,” he says.\n\n“In fact, it’s only because of those experienced hands in the industry that I could handle difficult situations with ease and improve my acting. Also, I have quite a few friends in the industry, who have been very supportive. Actor Sangeetha and singer Krish are best friends of mine, from whom I take suggestions without giving it a second thought,” he says.\n\nJiiva played the role of a psychopath in the film, Katradhu Tamizh, which won critical acclaim. Also Ameer’s Raam earned him the Best Actor Award at the Cyprus International Film Festival in 2005, which turned out to be one of the biggest breaks in his career. “If any director were to ask me to pick five of my best films in which I have performed well as an actor, I would immediately ask them to watch Katradhu Tamizh and Raam, as they are my career’s best roles,” he says.\n\nJiiva seems to be a hero of sorts in real life too, managing to play with his son and spend time with his wife despite his busy schedules. “My son is three years old, and now, I am able to understand exactly the meaning of the old saying, ‘Life is a cycle’, as it calls forth all those moments when our parents made sacrifices for us. Also, when I feel low, a kiss from my son heals all my worries — as he drags me, pulls my legs and cuddles up with me,” he says.\n\nHis love story too is a fascinating one which reflects in reality the genre of his earlier film, Nee Thane Yen Ponvasantham. Wife Supriya was Jiiva’s childhood sweetheart and he married her when he was just 23. They are still the best of friends, which was the reason for them to bond strong in the first place. “Supriya is very special to me and I have no words to explain how she swept me off my feet,” he says with a smile.\n\nThe hero in real life also does his best for society as an environmentalist, having built a house in the city made of eco-friendly materials. “I don’t like to claim to be an environmentalist as there are many more people outside who dedicate their whole life to the welfare of society. But I do like to keep Mother Nature clean and unpolluted. Unless its Europe, Kodaikanal or any other hill station, it’s difficult to implement these things — though I have managed to set up a solar heater, solar lights and cooker for my new house,” he says.\n\nWhen asked about the bond that he shares with his elder brother, Jithan Ramesh, who is also in the film industry, Jiiva says, “We never interfere in each other’s career and personal life. But we do share all our secrets like best friends, and, in fact, during my school days, people never believed that he was my brother as we got along well. I still remember the days when we played cricket together, having a whale of a time on the ground. He has been my pillar of support till date. “\n\nControversies dog actors, and Jiiva has not been spared. He was in the news for a while for the wrong reasons. “It’s true that Simbu was approached first to don the lead role in the film Ko, even before me. In fact, the script was written for Ajith Sir, then it passed on to Suriya, then to Simbu, and finally, it came to me. The movie did well in the city, it was a box office hit. These issues happen in every other film. It’s only when a film becomes a hit that all these issues float on the surface in a more visible way, else it’s left unstirred. I still share a very good rapport with Simbu, and he is even now a very good friend of mine in the industry,” he says.\n\nAfter all, the most recent trend, in this 70 mm journey, is the Bollywood route. “I don’t have any Bollywood dreams, daydreams nor night dreams. If it’s a worthy script, I would definitely take up the offer irrespective of the language in which the movie is,” he says. “But I have a strong vision to work in Hollywood films, and I am sure that it will happen very soon,” he says with surety.\n\nReason to smile....\n\nVery few actors can pull off the role of an impoverished slum dweller and that of a suave metro-sexual with equal ease. This has been Jiiva’s speciality. In the trailer of his next release Endrendrum Punnagai, he is seen in designer clothes, driving a luxury car. “I play an ad-director,” he says, hinting that the film might sport the glossy look of a commercial. “The film is well-packaged. Young urban people will like it,” he adds.\n\nEndrendrum Punnagai is an important film for Jiiva who is standing at yet another crossroads in his career. “I am not in form, you know,” he says with a smile referring to his last two films — Nee Thaane En Pon Vasantham and Mugamoodi — which didn’t do well at the box office. The actor hopes that Endrendrum Punnagai will break the bad spell. “It has got great comedy and even a steamy subplot between Andrea and me. It should work with the current generation.”\n\nThis is the tale of every young actor in the industry today. Five or ten years ago, Jiiva would have done a ‘mass’ movie playing a roadside Romeo forced to fight injustice in his neighbourhood. “Not anymore. Those days are over,” he says, adding, “Films such as Katcheri Aarambam and Thenavattu will recover the money invested but won’t look good on my filmography.”\n\nTimes have changed. The new strategy involves catering to the young audience at cinemas and not succumbing to the dominant trend. The actor has the distinct advantage of having cultivated a ‘local boy’ image, which, while giving his films the quintessential local flavour, lets him do slightly more upmarket urban stories without alienating his audiences. This line of thought is reflected even in the trailer of Endrendrum Punnagai where a police official is heard saying that they (Jiiva and his friends) look posh but are actually ‘local’. “SMS (Siva Manasula Sakthi) was perhaps the first film in that mould, don’t you think?” he asks.\n\nThis new strategy would also involve finding young directors armed with fresh ideas which can touch a chord in today’s youth. “I have done my share of films with big directors. I would like to work with youngsters,” he says. The actor wants to collaborate more than just being contracted to utter his lines. “Young directors are more receptive to suggestions, debates and discussions. This doesn’t always happen when you work with established ones,” he says.\n\nThe actor no longer nods to half-written scripts, which seems to be the norm today. “It is a chronic problem. They (directors) narrate three scenes and a one-line idea based on which I will have to decide whether or not to do a film,” he says. His film under production, Yaan, being directed by Ravi K Chandran, had four script-reading sessions, he claims. “Yaan could be one of those ‘cult’ films,” he says.\n\nDoes he plan to get into filmmaking and production as well? “I would like to take over Super Good Films (his father R. B. Chowdry’s banner) once we breach the 100-film mark. I shoot a lot of videos when I travel. Let’s see,” he smiles.\n\nPaint My Love - Interview for Galatta cinema December 2011\n\nCrimson Passion\n\nI love so many things about cinema. You get to meet so many people and go to so many places. It opens up your mind to so many new ideas and gives you a whole new perspective on the world around you. Being in cinema means fame and fortune. You get pampered a lot! Everywhere you go, people love you and compliment you... Of course there are those who don’t like you too, but that’s part of the deal!\n\nFilmy Blues\n\nBeing in cinema means you lose your privacy. I know that’s part of the bargain. But what I really hate is people with mobile phones with in-built cameras who don’t have the common courtesy to ask your permission before taking pictures and videos. It really gets to me when I see videos of me having some private time with my family, all over the Internet. Just because we are public figures, people tend to think they own us. It’s just not fair. But I guess, that’s part of the deal too.\n\nGrey Matter\n\nDoing Ko is by far the best career move I’ve made. I was doing Singam Puli and working on a few other films too, but when Ko came my way and I heard the script, I was blown away. I just knew I had to do it. I made time for it and put in a lot of hard work. I’m really very grateful for the opportunity. I must thank my director and producer for giving me the chance to star in it. It was an amazing experience and of course, it looks great on my portfolio!\n\nSilver Lining\n\nWhen a movie like Ko releases and you become a big hit, people’s expectations shoot up. And that’s the reason why movies such as Vandhan Vendran and Rowthiram did not do well. These are movies I signed on before Ko and had they released earlier they would have done well. But the world does not end there and thankfully, people still have faith in me, that I will do bigger, better movies. And I’m sure my upcoming movies Nanban, Neethaane En Ponvasantham and Mugamoodi will live up to that belief.\n\nJIIVA INTERVIEW\n\nWhat strikes you instantly on seeing Jiiva is his much younger, leaner and cleanly shaven college boy looks (engineering to be precise) for Gautham Menon’s Nee Thaane En Pon Vasantham. This talented actor is certainly on a roll and is becoming an important force to be reckoned with in the industry with the multifarious roles, films and directors he associates himself with. His Vandhaan Vendraan is releasing today Jiiva about VV\n\nWhat is Vandhaan Vendraan all about?\n\nVV is a travel about beautiful relationships and love. And you also have some action sequences. VV will be a sleek film. There is a beautiful love story, a family sentiment and also a rivalry in VV which would apparently mean the film is a mass entertainer. At a time when it is rare for a film to be certified as U, VV has got a U certificate. We consider this a huge plus for the film\n\nHow is VV going to be different from other films?\n\nI don’t claim that my films or my characters as different. I would only say each of my character is interesting. Like a Ram or E or Ko or Katradhu Thamizh, I look for variety in the roles that I take up. As far as I am concerned, VV is a film with a strong content. Besides me, Taapsee, villain and comedian Santhanam, the first lead in the film is the story.\n\nVV Music\n\nWhen I first met music director Thaman for this film, it was very energetic. He is a music director for today’s and yesterday’s generation. He has given the best songs which include Anjana Anjana, Kanchanamala, Thiranden and Piriyude. You would find that all the songs are connected. Each song will be of different variety and you will not find the old format of commercial films. Each song would depict a different emotion as there is a beautiful duet, a good travelogue number and a ditty on celebration of success. When I first met Thaman for this film he said, ‘You please don’t give me salary for this film. You first listen to the tracks that I have scored and then decide”. He is such a personality who has immense confidence in his capability. It was a beautiful experience working with Thaman. In tune with Thaman’s music, visuals have also come out very well. I think we have done justice to his music.\n\n\"You please don’t give me salary\"\n\n\"Kannan was like a firecracker\"\n\nWorking with director Kannan\n\nDirector Kannan is a balanced personality. He is from Mani Ratnam’s school of film making and working with him has filled in the void that I had of not working in Mani sir’s film. Usually the unit would be very calm but Kannan would be like a firecracker bursting all over mainly to keep the artists cool so that they don’t get stressed. His approach to work was balanced, precise and content oriented. He had clear notion as to how much of an idea or thought should be conveyed and has a subtle approach. When you see his idea visually after editing, it takes on a totally different appealing hue. Kannan’s school of film making was very different to me and it was a great experience to have worked with him.\n\nHow was Taapsee to work with?\n\nFor Taapsee, VV is a second Tamil film but it would never appear so. I see a lot of interest and enthusiasm in her to learn new things. She has lengthy dialogues in VV and she being a North Indian girl, one would expect some kind of trepidation from her side but she totally floored me when she said that she has learnt the dialogues. I felt good and told her it makes it a lot easier to give the right kind of counter and it also brings the spontaneity out when your co-artist knows the dialogues. In that way Taapsee is a dedicated artist. .\n\n\"I see a lot of interest and\n\nenthusiasm in Taapsee\"\n\n\"Nandha’s role is much better and\n\nmore powerful than mine\"\n\nNandha in VV\n\nThere is no such thing as hero or villain in VV. Nandha’s role has negative shades and he has brought that shade in a very effective fashion. To be very frank, Nandha’s role is better, stronger, more commanding and powerful than mine. Nobody other than Nandha would have suited this role. He is sure to get a good name for his work in VV. We both have been very good friends. I have met him in earlier occasions in different places and we used to share our appreciation for each other’s work. So when we teamed up for a film, we had fun times. Nandha being a Coimbatore person, has a sharp sense of wit and there were times when we had roaring laughter sessions which even prevented us from getting into the shots. He is a very good human being and also a great performer. He is a properly trained actor. The films that he is doing also reveal different facets of his acting prowess. His line up of films is indicative of the fact that he has all the qualifications to be a front runner. I can very proudly say that I have worked with Nandha in VV.\n\nSanthanam\n\nEven while he speaks normally, Santhanam evokes laughter. In VV he has a shop that sells panipuri and he attempts to speak Hindi that is more terrifying. At the sets, Santhanam and I had great fun and did our scenes in a very lighthearted vein. Later I used to wonder if I had really done justice but when I saw those scenes, they had shaped up in an interesting manner. Technicians who were not at the sets, when they saw the film, they were all roaring in laughter. So I kind of knew that the comedy has worked out well. And when I saw the double positive, I was also very happy that it has turned out well. Ours is a good combination and Santhanam surely lights up the proceedings.\n\n\"Santhanam’s Hindi is terrifying\"\n\n\"Comedy has worked much\n\nbetter in Nanban than 3 Idiots\"\n\nHow has Nanban shaped up?\n\nNanban has shaped up well. It has more grandeur, better quality. And, as it is Shankar sir’s film, it has his touch all over. We did not want to spoil the essence of the Hindi original. We have filmed in such a way that people who have seen the Hindi original will not say it’s not as good as the Hindi. Comedy has worked much better in Tamil and emotions have been conveyed beautifully. I can confidently say that if this film has been taken by anyone other than Shankar, it would not have come out this well. I can say this as someone who has seen the finished rough version.\n\nIs there an influence of Sharman Joshi in your character portrayal in Nanban?\n\nOur aim was not to disturb the original character even in the minutest way. But I feel the Tamil version will be more entertaining. That’s what I felt when I saw the film as an audience. And the finer emotions involving friendship are well brought out. I am very positive about Nanban. I cannot say there is an influence (of Sharman Joshi). I have portrayed the role in my individual style.\n\n\"I have portrayed my role in\n\nNanban in my individual style\"\n\n\"Nanban would give you a feel of\n\nhaving eaten a full course meal\"\n\nNanban unit\n\nIt’s a great unit with Vijay sir, Sathyaraj sir, Srikanth, Ileana and Anuya, You would get the feel of having eaten a full course meal when you see Nanban. I am the youngest in the unit and Vijay sir is senior to me in age and in experience. It was a lively unit and we all had fun playing pranks on each other. We have all becomes good friends and I know Vijay from my childhood days when he has acted in some of our production ventures when I used to call him Anna. With this film, the bonding between me and Vijay has strengthened. And Srikanth and I have been friends for a long time. In this film, our travel has been more together and as there is no jodi for me and Srikanth, it was boring and since there was no other go, me and Srikanth have become the jodi of Nanban. It was good fun and also we had lots of travel in Nanban. We went to Andamans, Ooty, Coimbatore and Dehradun for the shoot.\n\nGautham’s Nee Thaane En Pon Vasantham and Mysskin’s Mugamoodi\n\nI have just begun Gautham sir’s Nee Thaane En Pon Vasantham under Rahman sir’s music. I am glad and proud that I have got such a project. Post Ko, more than the star status I am glad that I get opportunities to work under good directors.\n\nIn Mysskin’s Mugamoodi, it is a different dimension with a super hero subject. According to me both are different genres. When I heard the story of Mugamoodi and the envisaged treatment, I feel it will bring a different level of film making to the fore. Yes, for NTEPV, I had to lose a lot of weight as I have to sport a college student’s look. For this I had undergo some diet regimens and work out sessions. And I also had to take kungfu lessons for Mugamoodi.\n\nWhat is the special makeover that Gautham has given you in NEP?\n\nWhat you see in front of you now is the makeover of NTEPV. I don’t think you would have seen me in this kind of look anytime before, perhaps in Dishyum…After Ko and Rowthiram, it sure is a different look. And people have looked at me and asked if I am Jiiva’s younger brother but I don’t have a younger brother. I take this as an appreciation and this itself is the first success of NTEPV. There are three changeovers in NTEPV encompassing 15 years. It is going to be a different trip for me.\n\nThere are three changeovers in\n\nNeethaane En PonVasantham\n\nencompassing 15 years\n\nPresently you seem to be the choice for diverse roles. How did this happen?\n\nAs an actor I would like to trip on everything as that’s what an actor’s job is. And I feel lucky as I am in a different shoe every month. It is something very positive as I tend to meet a lot of people, new places and get the taste of new culture. If I do the same kind of films, then I tend to see the same kind of people again and again which is not interesting. It could be a safe trip but I also need to get entertained.\n\nSecondly, why is someone an actor? Only when I trip on various roles, I can bring about variety. I should take on the role of a beggar, a rich man, a college student, an old man, a photographer, an angry young man, an artistic personality, a slum boy and so on. I would like to do all kinds of roles and in this pursuit, I think I am doing a good job.\n\nYour take on your special camaraderie with Arya and Jeyam Ravi\n\nIt is not only Arya and Jeyam Ravi but also others like Vishal, Vikranth, Vishnu, Mirchi Siva, and Bharath. Cricket has made all of us closer and Ramana is the one who coordinates between all of us. We also get together and play in the nets. It is a very healthy trend. We all try to meet every weekend and catch up. Recently it was Vishal’s birthday and we all gave a surprise party. It is not only actors; I also bond well with actresses like Sangeetha, and Krish. We are all good friends.\n\nYour project with Arya under Rajesh’s direction\n\nIt is still in the stage of talks. Rajesh is also busy with OKOK and Karthi’s next project. Of course, he is doing a film with me next year. I am also starting my production company, although I am yet to finalize a name. As of now, Arya and I will be producing Rajesh’s film and we may also star in the film. Nothing has been finalized now. Talks are on and let’s see how things go.\n\nCompletely involved in all that he does, is how one can describe Jiiva. He is gearing up for the release of his ambitious super-hero filmMugamoodi. In this exclusive chat with us, he confesses that it was not easy playing super hero…\n\nHow was it playing a superhero?\n\nI play Anand, a character who is obsessed with Kung Fu and he is called Bruce Lee because of this. He is an ordinary guy who goes on to do extraordinary things as the movie progresses. Girish Karnad plays my father, a sort of loony scientist. It was not easy, (smiles) but it was fun.\n\nWhy was it not easy? What were the challenges?\n\nWell, it was a big responsibility to live up to playing out one of Mysskin's childhood dreams of a superhero. I hope I have lived upto it. In physical terms, it was challenging to wear the superhero costume every day. A lot of research went into making it with a costumer from Hong Kong, using the best materials. But it generates a lot of heat. At the end of the day I would be really tired and cranky and I must thank my make up man, costumer and hairstylist for standing by me and putting up with all my tantrums.\n\n‘I believe in making a mark’ – Jiiva\n\nIt’s exactly a decade since Jiiva’s first film, Aasai Aasaiyai, was released — on January 31 — under his father R. B. Choudary’s banner. Skeptical about the actor’s profession, he had wanted to be behind the camera, but was game to try acting too. He talks about the best part of the last 10 years in an interview with DC.\n\nTen glorious years\n\nMy first two films, Aasai Aasaiyai and Thithikudhe, were produced by my dad. I was just a teenager then and had my own doubts. But my first director, Ravi Mariya, helped me understand how everything worked, and discovered the talent I had.\n\nMy third movie, Raam, directed by Ameer, took almost two years to complete. I put in immense hard work. At the end of the day, I was glad that my efforts bore fruit. I consider Raam to be one of the milestones of my career, I am grateful for the fact that Ameer trusted me.\n\nI acted as a stuntman in Dishyum. I’m sure that the Dilamo Dilamo song lingers in music lovers’ ears. I bagged an opportunity to act with the legendary star, Mohanlal, for Keerthi Chakra which was great exposure. Kattradhu Thamizh is one of the best films of my career and to carry off the protagonist’s role, I went through a lot of pain and effort, but the film didn’t do too well at the box office.\n\nI got critical acclaim for Thenavattu and Siva Manasula Sakthi, but perhaps after Ko, I got to enter the big league and I acquired star status. Right after Ko, I started working with ace filmmakers like Mysskin and Gautham Menon. My hard work had paid off.\n\nThe future\n\nDavid is going to hit the screens and I’m indeed looking forward to that. But I’m not happy about what’s happening to Vishwaroopam. This kind of situation may happen to any of us. So that’s the bitter part of the whole thing. We did have some sort of confusion over the release of David, but considering all the other commercial aspects, the film is releasing. It was a pleasure to work with Vikram and Bejoy Nambiar.\n\nI used 25,000 ft of film for a song,\n\nDespite coming from a filmi background, getting into movies wasn’t Jiiva’s priority. The actor shares with TOI, on its fifth anniversary, how the film industry changed his outlook and why he’s a content man today…\n\nYou entered the industry when you were in your teens…\n\nYes, I was 18 then… I was aimless in life, and was into web designing. I was also toying with going to Canada for studies. The only reason I used to visit the shooting spots was to eat the samosa they served during breaks!\n\nSo, what was the first film experience like?\n\nI was brain washed into becoming an actor! The director (Ravi Mariya) asked me to be part of his project. My dad told me jovially that it was not every day that someone would be keen on casting my face! So, I decided to give it a shot. It was the most terrifying moment of my life. When I faced the camera, I started sweating. We were shooting in a temple in Thiruvotriyur and 200 people were watching me. It took me two days to get comfortable with the idea of acting. Just when I was warming up to delivering dialogues, they took me to Kodaikanal to shoot for Yeh Penne…! Usually, directors finish off movies in 55,000 ft; but it took my team 25,000 ft of film to finish shooting that one song! Only then I realized how much of money is involved in every project.\n\nBeing the son of a producer must have made things easy for you…\n\nI wish! I constantly heard people commenting that I looked like a north Indian. Many felt I was too fair, looked too young to play rough characters. So, I had to eat ‘pazhaya sadam’ to gain weight, and use makeup to look like a local guy. When my first few films flunked at the BO, I took a long break, read books, watched three films a day and decided that I will be totally dedicated to the next film I do. That’s when Raam happened.\n\nDoes failure deter you?\n\nI used to get frustrated initially. Those who didn’t know about movies would come up to me and advise me on what films I should take up. It was almost like a condolence speech for me. I’d listen patiently to them, and vow to myself to do better in the next film.\n\nYou’ve had your share of controversies, made friends, frenemies in the industry...\n\n(Laughs) Cinema gives you instant gratification. Success and failure in this industry teaches you everything quickly. I’ve learnt that being vengeful is going to serve no purpose. My motto in life is to ‘move on’!\n\nsource: TOI\n\n“Hope I get more female fans after my new film”- Jiiva\n\nTalented actor Jiiva is riding high on success.\n\nThough his last film Mugamoodi didn’t succeed as expected at the box-office, Jiiva has some very interesting projects on hand.\n\nNeethane Enn Ponvasantham, a trilingual directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon is one of them.\n\nWhile the Tamil and Telugu versions of the young love story are releasing this Friday, the Hindi version will release much later.\n\nIn this interview, Jiiva talks about the experience of acting in the film.\n\nWhat was your initial reaction to being asked to act as a school boy?\n\nI was very surprised. I had put on a lot of weight at that time — around 90 kilos — and I wondered how I was going to look like a school student.\n\nBut I was also aware that I would get to work with a director who knows his craft very well.\n\nI was shooting for Shankar’s Nanban at that time. When I met Gautham Menon, the first thing he told me was that I had to lose weight.\n\nLuckily, I started playing the CCL matches at that time. I also went on a strict diet and lost a lot of weight.\n\nWas it the toughest role you’ve had to play — a school student, then a college student, and then a young man in his 20s?\n\nNot at all. In fact, I would say it was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my career.\n\nI had a great time acting in the film. Pon vasantham means beautiful autumn and it was really a pon vasantham for me.\n\nWhat was the most enjoyable part?\n\nThough all the three parts were enjoyable, I think I liked the college portions the most. We shot the college days first and at that time, I was really fit and felt really good.\n\nWhen the first stills of the film were out, everybody was surprised to see your new and young look. Did you get a lot of compliments for the look?\n\nI am only 29 but people have seen me looking older and in ill-fitting clothes. I’ve played my age in a film for the first time.\n\nSo, I thoroughly enjoyed it. As an actor, this movie is a great exposure for me.\n\nWhat do you still remember about the school and college portions?\n\nI enjoyed delivering the funny dialogues. At 29, it was funny to talk like a 16-17-year-old!\n\nI haven’t been to college, but I enjoyed the college portions in the film. I could relate to what Varun did when he was 21-22.\n\nGautham Menon is very good at picturising romantic scenes. How was it doing the romantic scenes?\n\nHe made sure that I wasn’t uncomfortable normally I am a bit uncomfortable doing romantic scenes. But in this film, I didn’t feel that way.\n\nThe dialogues I had in the film, I might have said 10 years ago! Today, I am a married man with a kid!\n\nI had a great co-star in Samantha so the romantic scenes came out well. Before each scene, I used to crack a joke so that she felt comfortable.\n\nThe scenes were so well executed and the dialogues beautifully written, that as an actor I had no problem doing them.\n\nIs it not your first out-and-out romantic film?\n\nYes, it is. It is a pure love story. Like my life story. When Gautham narrated the story, I could connect to many of the situations. That made a big difference.\n\nAll three versions of the film were shot simultaneously. Did you watch how the others did the same scenes?\n\nNo, I didn’t stay back to watch others. There was no question of me comparing my acting with the others. I am not that kind of guy.\n\nI am not good at dancing, but Nani is. That didn’t make me jealous or uncomfortable. I enjoyed playing Varun Krishnan.\n\nI used to make fun of Samantha about the romantic scenes, as one after another, we were saying or doing the same thing to her!\n\nI was the one who gave Samantha a tough time, teasing her all the time. Nani is a silent guy, and the guy who did the Hindi version (Aditya Roy Kapoor) was more focused. So, I was the one who did all the fooling around.\n\nIf there was a kissing scene, I would tell Samantha that I was going to do the first kissing that day!\n\nHow much are you looking forward to the release of Nee Thane En Pon Vasantham?\n\nI am really looking forward to the release because everyone says I look young and smart in the film. I hope to have more girl fans after this film! (laughs)\n\nYou have come a long way from your Katrathu Thamizh days, when you had unkempt and unruly hair and an uncouth beard.\n\nYes, in those days girls looked at me with disgust (laughs). In the films that followed, I used abusive language and slept on the road. But many women liked me in Ko, which was not an out and out romantic film.\n\nVarun is one of the most memorable characters I have played in my career. I have never enjoyed myself so much playing any character.\n\nI really feel positive about the film.\n\nTough to ply a super hero\n\nCompletely involved in all that he does, is how one can describe Jiiva. He is gearing up for the release of his ambitious super-hero film Mugamoodi. In this exclusive chat with us, he confesses that it was not easy playing super hero…\n\nHow was it playing a superhero?\n\nI play Anand, a character who is obsessed with Kung Fu and he is called Bruce Lee because of this. He is an ordinary guy who goes on to do extraordinary things as the movie progresses. Girish Karnad plays my father, a sort of loony scientist. It was not easy, (smiles) but it was fun.\n\nWhy was it not easy? What were the challenges?\n\nWell, it was a big responsibility to live up to playing out one of Mysskin's childhood dreams of a superhero. I hope I have lived upto it. In physical terms, it was challenging to wear the superhero costume every day. A lot of research went into making it with a costumer from Hong Kong, using the best materials. But it generates a lot of heat. At the end of the day I would be really tired and cranky and I must thank my make up man, costumer and hairstylist for standing by me and putting up with all my tantrums.\n\nHow did you prepare for the stunt sequences ?\n\nI was lucky that I had learnt Kung Fu for five years, prior to even meeting Mysskin. So all that helped. But I went back to training with Sekar Master again for the film when Mysskin told me he would be using the art in the film. Sekar Master's earlier training is one of the reasons I didn't face too many difficulties while doing the stunts. Also, Tony master taught me a lot in the forty days that we trained together for the film.\n\nNarain plays the antagonist. Tell us about working with him.\n\nIts important to have a strong antagonist to make the film interesting so a lot of weightage has been given to his role and he's done an excellent job. It's a very powerful role. I interacted with him for 25 days during a fight combination scene. He is one of the most patient actors I know.\n\nHow is the chemistry between you and Pooja Hegde?\n\nWell, so far we have not done any romantic scenes as such. But we are heading to Switzerland for two songs and that's when I will know how the on screen chemistry works out! ( laughs). But she is fun on the sets.\n\nMugamoodi is my first real action film\n\nJiiva is one of the most talented and busiest young actors in Tamil cinema.\n\nStarting his career with the offbeat, award winning Ram, Kathrathu Thamizh and E, he moved on to successful commercial films, Dishyum, Ko, Nanban etc.\n\nHis last films, Ko and Nanban (the Tamil remake of Three Idiots), were huge successes, so expectations of the UTV production Mugamoodi, releasing tomorrow, are quite high.\n\nHere, Jiiva talks about the exhausting and exhilarating experience of acting as a superhero and his training in Kung Ku and other martial arts.\n\nWere you a fan of superhero comics when you were young?\n\nActually I was not. I was more of a Rambo, Commando fan and also a fan of superhero films.\n\nI enjoyed watching Superman, Batman and Spiderman films but I was not really interested in the comics.\n\nThen what exactly attracted you toMugamoodi?\n\nAs an actor, any new concept attracts me. Also, Mysskin's (the director) treatment has always been new.\n\nI have always wanted to work with him. But when he asked me to work in his second film, Anjathe, I felt I was too young to play a police officer. When I saw the film, I felt, oh God, I should have played it!\n\nSo, it was not the role but the director that made you accept the film?\n\nThat was the first attraction. Also, Mysskin had been tossing the idea about with me for quite some time.\n\nI was quite excited to hear about the treatment he was planning. The script was very interesting. Mugamoodi is each one of us, one of the public, not like the superhero films you have seen so far.\n\nHe is not a super hero in the real sense. He doesn't have any super powers; he uses his mental and physical powers.\n\nMany may have high thoughts but they may not execute them, but this is a man who believes in practising what he believes in. I would say all our Tamil heroes are superheroes!\n\nIn Hindi films, too, Salman Khan's Tiger is a super hero...\n\nRight. In front of Tiger, Mugamoodi is nothing! (laughs)\n\nThese days, Hindi films also want to have heroes like ours. Couple of weeks ago, I was in Mumbai shooting for Bejoy Nambiar's David, and all the Hindi film guys were telling me, 'What fights you people do in the south! Fantastic!'\n\nIt is true that all the fight masters are from here.\n\nInMugamoodi, you had a fight master from Hong Kong...\n\nYes, Tony Leung, a legendary action choreographer. He has worked with Bruce Lee! I call him Tony Master!\n\nMysskin told me that he asked you to train in martial arts and he was surprised to hear that you had been training for several years.\n\nNot several years. I trained in Kung Fu for four years -- from 1998 to 2002 -- under a master called Sekhar.\n\nI stopped after I joined the film industry and found that the fights in films have nothing to do with Kung Fu.\n\nWas it out of interest that you learnt Kung Fu?\n\n(Laughs) No. I liked to do only one thing when I was a teenager -- play cricket. The rest of the time, I used to sleep. It irritated my father (producer R B Chaudhary). So, he made me go jogging with him at six in the morning at the YMCA. I found it quite boring.\n\nOne day, I saw some kids learning some martial arts, and I told my father that I wanted to learn that. It was just to avoid jogging.\n\nMy father would wake me up in the morning to take me to the Kung Fu class. I must have been 16 or so. Looking back, I feel it was really nice of him to do that as those lessons have helped me immensely now.\n\nI didn't enjoy learning Kung Fu initially. I had to really stretch my legs and it hurt. But once my body got used to the regimen, I started enjoying it. My body structure changed; the way I stood, the way I walked, everything. My thin body developed muscles.\n\nThe changes were so motivating that I used to wake up on my own and go alone, and I became the best student. After some time, I also started learning gymnastics.\n\nWhy gymnastics?\n\nMy Kung Fu master Sekhar was a good friend of the gymnastics master Ali. Sekhar Master asked him to teach me gymnastics. My daily routine started with gymnastics and then Kung Fu. When you meet healthy people, you get influenced by them and that was what happened to me.\n\nSo, all those lessons have come handy in this film?\n\nYes. In some films I have fought like a Kung Fu guy and did somersaults but it never made any sense. But inMugamoodi, all those actions make sense.\n\nMysskin was initially surprised to hear that I had learnt Kung Fu. I think that was when he felt he had chosen the right guy to do the film!\n\nBut whatever I have learnt from Sekhar Master was not used in the film. What is shown in Mugamoodi is close combat. It is Win Chun, which I had not learnt before.\n\nDid you learn Win Chun for the film?\n\nIt is much more advanced than Kung Fu. I learnt the basics from Tony Master and the postures were quite tough. I wish I could go to Hong Kong and train for at least a couple of months. I didn't have that much time to do it, sadly.\n\nSo, in the film, I learnt only what was choreographed for the action sequences.\n\nHaving done the action sequences, do you feel like learning it professionally?\n\nIf there is a Mugamoodi 2, I will definitely go and train in Win Chun.\n\nThe problem here is, unlike in Hollywood, we don't do just one film at a time. So, it is impossible to be thorough in what you do. You just move from one set to another and one film to another.\n\nIf there is a part two, I will learn it professionally. I want to be the first actor who specialises in Win Chun, Kung Fu, etc. I want the fights in our films to look real like you see in the Chinese films.\n\nTony Master told me I had to make myself free for four weeks so that I can train. Then he wants me to take a break of two weeks and go back again for four weeks. And then again for another four weeks. He said after that, I could fight like a professional.\n\nIf there is a part 2, I will go through this routine and become a professional before I start acting in it.\n\nWasMugamoodiyour first action film?\n\nYes, it is my first real action film. It is an action film that has Indian sensibilities.\n\nKo also was an action film, but more of a defensive action film. This is different. Here, the guy goes and fights with the bad guys.\n\nI enjoy action films but I don't like anyone beating me up. I like to beat up the other guys! (laughs).\n\nHow exciting was it for you to get into the superhero costume?\n\nNot at all exciting. In fact, it was such a pain. The costume was so heavy that I couldn't eat, sit or stand properly. Everything was painful, though after some time, I got used to it like one gets used to the mad Chennai traffic!\n\nBut it was too stressful. I also developed neck pain from which I am yet to recover. The costume was a hindrance to action and also my day-to-day activities.\n\nStill, you are game forMugamoodi 2?\n\nThat is, only if they find a lighter and friendlier costume! That is my condition, and I have told Mysskin too!\n\nI must tell you, when you wear the superhero costume, you really feel powerful! At the same time, it made me so angry and irritated. It was like Jesus carrying the cross.\n\nMost of the shooting was at night and I felt so dehydrated and tired. It was one of the most strenuous and tough roles I have done. You need to have a strong mind and very good fitness level to do such a film.\n\nHow did you celebrate once the shooting got over?\n\nThe last bit was a song in Switzerland, and after the last day's shooting, I gave a huge party for everyone. I have quite a few friends there. I invited them too.\n\nI felt like screaming, 'Hurray, from now on, I don't have top wear the costume!' (laughs)\n\nYou also had sleepless nights during the shooting?\n\nYes, I had sleepless nights, and many sleepless days as I was shooting for Mugamoodi at night and for Gautham Menon's film in the day. I shot for 80 nights and my whole body clock went for a toss.\n\nAfter that, I went straight to Bejoy Nambiar's David and one day, my back was so bad that I couldn't move and I collapsed. I had to cancel two days' shoot.\n\nWhen do you plan to take a break?\n\nI am winding up Gautham Menon's Nee Thane En Ponn Vasantham. I have been working continuously, without a break, for the last one-and-a-half years.\n\nBefore I get a divorce notice from my wife, I have to take a break!\n\nWhat is the next film you have signed?\n\nI have signed a dozen films including Ravi K Chandran's first directorial venture.\n\nIt seems everybody wants a piece of Jiiva these days...\n\nI am so happy. I have waited for this day. I am so humbled and overwhelmed to get these offers.\n\nWhen you started with offbeat films likeRam,Kathrathu Thamizh, etc, did you expect this kind of a transition in your career?\n\nI wanted to do those kinds of films but it is not possible to do a Ram or a Kathrathu Thamizh all the time.\n\nAfter that, I tried masala films. I want to do all kinds of films. I don't want to do the same kind of roles again and again. It bores me and also the audience. I try to choose roles that are interesting to me.\n\nHow interesting wasDavid?\n\nDavid was super-cool and super-interesting. I like Bejoy's very urban way of telling stories. I will be working in his next film too.\n\ninterview with Jiiva\n\nToday, Jiiva has become the most apt for the term – ‘Director’s Actor’. It is true that there is a ‘Ko’ in Jiiva as we witnessed the beautiful photographs over his walls.\n\nHow did Gautham Menon sign you for Neethaane En Ponvasantham?\n\nFollowing ‘Nadunissi Naaigal’, Gautham Menon wanted to make a Life Size Film and after completing the script, he felt that I was apt for the role. The film reflected many of the incidents in my real life love story between me and my wife right from our childhood. The beautiful moments include the little clashes, sweet times, sharing each others’ happiness and worries. The film is so close to my heart and Neethaane En Ponvasantham will have more emotions than Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya. It will be one of the best romantic films of all times.\n\nVishal has said that you are the best actor of this year.\n\nThat’s his specialty and he is so innocent and good that makes him say so. Vishal has been my friend for past ten years. Not alone Vishal, Arya and Ravi, my friends are so happy about my success. If things are going well for all of us, it is all because of their kind heartedness. We don’t have any competition and jealousy over each other.\n\nYou say ‘All is Well’ in Life. How is it with Simbhu now?\n\nWe have no hard feelings and it might have happened due to some miscommunication. He appreciated my performance in Nanban and wished on my birthday. Yes, ‘All is Well’ between us.\n\nPlatinum pure Jiiva - Interview for Galatta cinema\n\nPlatinum Pure J\n\nJIIVA\n\nhe’s a rare person, that is for sure. jiiva is a star child - the son of one of tamil cinema’s biggest producers, an award-winning actor, a popular public figure and yet, extremely personable and down-to-earth. add to that our new discovery that he’s a wonderful, hands-on dad - and he gets our vote for favourite person at galatta! this month, we capture a very stylish jiiva in an exclusive shoot (clothed in basics life - we love their gear!) and we even glean a few new titbits of where he’s going in life... enjoy some zany, quicksilver, platinum action!\n\nNOT TIED DOWN BY CLICHES\n\n“It’s easy to be bogged down and then carried away by the demands of the industry - the danger on this path is that one can fall into the pit of mediocrity and i don’t like to be mediocre. i would rather be a great actor than a great star and if at some point these two meet, well, fabulous! i will always look at raam as the turning point of not just my career but also the way i looked at cinema and accepting roles and scripts. let me be honest: i do like the occasional commercial entertainer which may not be wholly realistic but hey! this is cinema. it’s an escape from reality most of the time; so my basic requirements in such movies would be simply that they are entertaining, wholesome and well made. for my serious challenges and creative satisfaction, i rely on my movies like raam and katradhu tamizh to give it to me. what this has done for me is so simple and so far-reaching - i am not slotted as any particular kind of “hero”. i don’t have to spend my life only vanquishing baddies single-handedly and winning over my heroines. i can be funny, real, a bad guy, a good guy, a physically challenged victim of circumstances, a buddy to the hero... whatever i want! that the people can see me as a chameleon of roles and still consider me a star is god’s grace and their desire to see my versatility!”\n\nSOUNDs OF SUCCESS\n\n“if you think that being a big producer’s son means easy roles and pots of success and money... think again. i had to work my butt off because at the end of the day, no matter how much money the producer pumps into your movie, it’s you who has to deliver on your role and if the people don’t like you, well, they simply don’t! in my case, i tried to find my footing for the first few years and when i finally figured out i can do it all, i am addicted to change and varied scripts! today i have under my belt, both an sms and a raam; both a ko and a rowthiram and soon, shankar’s remake of 3 idiots also. success to me is appreciation, critical accolades and personal satisfaction - fame and money will automatically follow!”\n\nUNPLUGGED\n\n“people are surprised how i kept my relationship with supriya for years before anyone but my closest buddies knew! (laughs) i think keeping the world out kept our focus in! today we’re blessed with sparsh, our beautiful son... and it’s such a heady feeling! like music that you just can’t help but enjoy and feel elated by... and dance to!”\n\nCover story: Rowthiram\n\njiiva’s roar of success\n\nWith the success of Ko, Jiiva is riding high on the wave of success. This K.V. Anand movie has brought him into reckoning as one of the top bankable stars at the box office. And with the amazing response to the Telugu dubbed version of the movie, Jiiva is geared up to reach the top. His next release is Rowthiram, produced under his home banner. Jiiva has worked very hard on this movie and is confident that the interesting storyline will bring in the audiences once again. And with Shriya as his heroine, it seems that the actor has another hit up his sleeve.\n\nRowthiram is about the daily issues that we read about in the papers but choose not to do anything about. Jiiva and Shriya play the lead roles in this action caper. Shriya plays a girl who looks at things from other people’s perspective. She is the hero’s inspiration and is his pillar of strength. The movie is not about seeing things, but actually looking at them.\n\nRowthiram marks the debut of director Gokul, a former associate of Telugu director Suriya Kiran. Rowthiram is Jiiva’s home production and the actor is leaving no stone unturned in making it a one of its kind venture. What does Jiiva have to say about Rowthiram? “I won’t call it a different movie, but it is indeed an interesting one. It is being made by our home banner and I am happy the way it has shaped up. There has been a lot of meticulous planning for the movie.”\n\nShriya while talking about the movie said, “This movie addresses an issue that we read about in the papers, but don’t really do. My role is about a girl who looks at things from other people’s perspective. She is the hero’s inspiration and is his pillar of strength. It is a film I am sure that people will remember for a long time to come. It is not about any particular issue, but it is a slice of life and it has been showcased like that. It is about being part of the society, it is about looking at things and not just seeing it. I know I might sound vague, but I don’t want to say anything further and give away the plot.”\n\nJiiva in rowthiram\n\nthe angry young man of tamil cinema\n\nMORE ABOUT ROWTHIRAM\n\n>> This is the first time that Jiiva is acting with Shriya Saran and their on-screen chemistry is said to crackling.\n\n>> This movie is about day to day issues which we usually do not care much about and choose to ignore.\n\n>> Shriya plays a law student in Rowthiram; she is confident that her role and the movie will be memorable.\n\nI would compare Rowthiram with the Hindi hit Sathya. I plays an angry young man and I am confident that I have done justice to the role. - Jiiva, Actor\n\nBanner: Super Good Films\n\nProducer: R.B.Chowdary\n\nDirector: Gokul\n\nCast: Jiiva, Shriya, Prakashraj Music: Prakash Nikki\n\nCamera: N. Shanmugachandra\n\nko More than just Journalism...\n\nCinematographer KV Anand is just two movies old, when it comes to direction, but he’s already made a name for himself. After the mega success he met with Ayan starring Suriya last year, expectations from him have only increased. Produced by Udhayanidhi’s Red Giant Movies KV Anand’s next movie is Ko. Starring Jiiva, Ajmal, Karthika, Piya and Jagan, the movie is an action thriller that follows a photo journalist who stumbles upon a scoop that makes him the prime target of a political conspiracy. “When you’re a photo journalist capturing a war, do you stop to help the wounded or take pictures first? It’s that sort of moral dilemma that we deal with in Ko,” informs KV Anand.\n\nHaving been a photo journo himself, the story has traces of his own experiences as well. “It’s a blend of things I have seen first-hand, that my friends have experienced and that which I have read about,” adds KV Anand. For Jiiva who has of-late been immersed in mass flicks, Ko is a refreshing change. An urban thriller where he plays the photo journo on a mission to expose the baddies come-what may. “Ko has been a wonderful experience. The entire team was so focused and committed to the movie, that it was truly inspiring. From travelling to scenic locales to shooting some high intense action sequences, this is a movie experience I will always treasure,” gushes Jiiva, the main man. Ajmal who plays a key part in the plot is as thrilled about the film as Jiiva. “It is indeed an honour to be a part of a film such as this. I have learnt so much from the movie. I am especially thankful to the writer duo Subha for the powerful lines they have given me in this movie,” says Ajmal.\n\nKarthika makes her Tamil debut with Ko. Daughter of yesteryear heartthrob Radha, Karthika has some high standards to live up to. “The moment I heard the story I agreed to do the movie. KV Anand sir assured me that this was not a typical commercial heroine role and that I would have quite a powerful role in the movie similar to that of Jiiva. And he kept to his word. I could not have asked for a better debut in Tamil cinema,” admits Karthika. Ko sure seems to have bowled over its main cast and promises to have us in raptures as well\n\nGalatta Express (Jan 20 - 26, 2012)\n\nJiiva celebrating friendship!\n\nJiiva has done it once more! Even vijay’s star light could not out shine his dazzle! Nanban adds to the plumage in jiiva’s cap!\n\nrising with the tide\n\nIf there’s one actor whose rise to the top has been quite a rickety ride in spite of Papa being Mr. Money-Bags, it’s Jiiva. And we love him all the more for it. His stardom has spread its wings further, but his feet are still firmly rooted to the ground.\n\n“Jiiva is at that point in his career, where he could have chosen not to do a movie with Vijay. With Ko, his standing has changed and he did not need a multi-starrer to boost his career. Yet he agreed to be a part of Nanban. He was never once insecure about his part in the movie. He lived the role and it was an absolute pleasure working with him. I must thank him for accepting the role and for working so hard at it,” says Shankar, the director of Nanban. Coming from a director who has worked with the likes of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, these words of praise will carry a long way.\n\nAnd true to Shankar’s words, Jiiva has done a great job of his role in the movie. Not once does he seem irked by the presence of the Ilayathalapathy. “I’ve always heard about what a quiet person Vijay is. That was my only concern when I went to the set the first day. I am the kind of guy who generally jokes around and chats up everybody. So I was wondering what sort of a rapport I’d have with Vijay. But I think our very first shot was the ice-breaker, when the camera started rolling and our pants had to go down! He may be a quiet guy, but when he laughs, he laughs with all his heart,” says Jiiva. Ask Vijay who the chatterbox on the set was and without a moment’s hesitation he points to Jiiva, but the smile on his face tells you just how much fun they had together.\n\n“It’s not only about playing the main lead. It’s about being a part of a movie that counts. Working with Shankar is an honour and that was something I did not want to miss. And since I got on well with the rest of the cast and crew, Nanban was an amazing experience,” adds Jiiva.\n\nComing up next for Jiiva are a bunch of interesting movies - two of which catch your eye immediately. First there is the Gautham Menon-directed celluloid romance Neethaane En Ponvasantham. The title alone speaks of mellifluous mushiness! Jiiva’s look in the movie is squeak-clean! He can almost pass off as a teen!\n\nThe other eye-catcher in his kitty is Mugamoodi. The movie is directed by Mysskin and is said to be a super-hero tale! Jiiva is understandably excited about the movie. The only other actor who came close to playing a super hero was Vikram, but Mysskin has gone all the way! Yep, Jiiva not only has a skin-tight, several kilos-heavy suit but he even comes with super powers! Jiiva went to special martial arts classes to get his moves correct and has been sweating it out at the gym, to get his cuts and grooves right! Jiiva is one of Galatta’s much adored stars and we sure hope his filmy future is encrusted in gold!\n\nAbout 'Keerthi chaakkra' first malayalam ?\n\n'We shot in Kashmir for more than 20 days. It was quite an experience in that hyper sensitive area. There were restrictions at times on account of security reasons.'\n\nJeeva believes that the film will help him impress viewers in Kerala. 'In fact, I was surprised when I was recognized by many while we were shooting for 'Keerthi Chakra' in Ottappalam,' he says with a smile.\n\nFROM AASAI AASAIYAI TO NEP, THERE'S NO STOPPING THIS YOUNG GUN\n\nWhen Jiiva started his career in Aasai Aasaiyai many would have thought that he is yet another producer's son who entered the film industry with ease. It seems people looked at him with the same notion in his second film \"Thithukithey\" too. But Jiiva proved otherwise and showcased his mettle as an actor with his Raam directed by Ameer. Jiiva did an excellent performance as a autistic youngster who was having an unconditional love towards his mother.\n\nCritics and people raved about his acting performance in Raam and it yielded him a strong recognition in Kollywood. The good thing with Jiiva is that he maintained the momentum by selecting good stories and different characters; he played as a stunt man in Dishyum which again garnered him many accolades.\n\nThe slum boy character in \"E\" and frustrated angry man character in \"Kattrathu Thamizh\" made him the first choice of directors who want to work with different plots. Meantime, Jiiva also was part of some commercial pot boilers like \"Thenavettu\" and \"Kacheri Arambam. Though they didn't do well at BO, Jiiva proved that he is a natural method actor even in commercial and comic films like \"SMS\" and \"Singam Puli\".\n\nEvery actor will have a turning point at the Box Office and Jiiva got it with KO. Yes, the film was unanimously accepted by the critics and audience and went on to become a blockbuster.\n\nAfter KO, any actor would have been reluctant and felt insecure in doing a multi starrer film that too with a big star like Vijay. But Jiiva did it with confidence and the film earned him more appreciation and fans.\n\nThough his \"Vandhan Vendran\", \"Mugamoodi\", \"NEP\" and \"Rowthiram\" didn't rake the box office moolah, his acting and hard work were appreciated and even Shankar said that Jiiva’s acting is accurate like a meter ie., he is a method actor.\n\nWe at cinemalead wish the actor all the success in his forthcoming projects like David,Yaan with Ravi K Chandran and Endrendrum Punnagai.\n\nFamily comes first...\n\nTamil actor Jiiva is choosy when it comes to his films. Popular for his romantic roles, Jiiva has now signed up for a dual role, for the first time in Singam Puli directed by debutant Sai Ramani.\n\nthe movie is very diffrent from anything Jiiva has done before. Till now we have seen him in the role of a hero, but in Singam Puli he is the hero and the anti-hero! The interesting thing about my anti-hero is that audiences will like him in spite of his negative qualities,” says Sai Ramani. Ask Jiiva about his experience playing the baddie and there’s an unmistakable twinkle in his eyes! “It was so cool and so much fun! Obviously playing a negative role is more challenging and I really enjoyed every moment of it,” gushes the star. Sai Ramani has taken pains not to differentiate one character played by Jiiva from the other. “As you watch the movie and get acquainted with the characters, you will be able to distinguish one from the other based on their characterization and body language,” explains Jiiva. “This is my first time in a double role. What attracted me to the story was the interesting way Sai Ramani has sketched the two characters. It’s not your usual dual role where you can easily spot the difference. It’s been a great experience for me!”\n\nPlaying the lady lead in the movie is Divya Spandana who has become exceedingly picky about her roles. “When I went to Bangalore to tell her the story I had no idea she’d want to hear the entire story! I thought it would suffice to tell her only about her part. But she listened to the whole story and almost immediately after that visit agreed to act in it. And I must say she has done a great job,” reveals director Sai Ramani. Producers Parthi and Vasan have taken care not to compromise on quality and have ensured that the CG work that went into the film was perfect. “Their support throughout the making of the movie has been tremendous. For a first time director to land producers such as this, is a blessing,” says a very grateful Sai Ramani.\n\nHis versatility had shone through E, Raam, Katradu Tamizh and Pori where he\n\nessayed different roles and played them all to a perfect T. Weekends are set apart for his family and Jiiva makes no compromises on that. He also makes sure he keeps pace with the latest in fashion.\n\nJiiva describes his experience of shooting for Nanban as ‘special’. “The film, though a remake, has loads of Tamil flavour packed into it. The humour and storyline have been changed to suit local tastes. We’ve just borrowed the soul of the original and worked around it,” says Jiiva.\n\nIn Ko, which translates to king in Tamil, Jiiva doubles up as a photojournalist. “It’s a role I have never really played before. I step into the shoes of a photojournalist, covering everything from elections to crime and more. I think I make for a pretty decent photographer,” he gushes.\n\nTalking about another of his projects Rowthiram, he draws a similarity between his role and that of Satya in Tamil and Hindi.\n\n“You’ll see an angry young man on screen. With these three films, I have slipped in and out of several characters. It’s great to be working back to back on projects and discovering a whole new side of myself,” he avers.\n\nBut Jiiva confesses that he has been missing his son who is barely a few months old.\n\n“I’ve been so busy after he was born. I recently flew my family down to Mumbai where I was shooting. We spent precisely four hours together before I took off to my next destination. Looks like my little one has brought me loads of luck,” he sums up.\n\nDiscovering new shades...\n\nChallenging Roles\n\nTamil actor Jiiva recently spent a good 15 days shooting in different parts of Bangalore. He loves the City but confesses that he hates the traffic here.\n\nHe says, in comparison to Chennai, here, it takes two or more hours to travel from one place to another. But in the midst of all this, he did manage to go to Forum Mall and watch Raavan with his wife. “It’s great to know that I have fans here as well but here people literally hound you. But back in Chennai people are so used to seeing me on TV and in the papers almost everyday that even if they see me on the streets, they just let me be,” he says.\n\nJiiva is currently shuttling between three projects. He’s playing a dual role in Singum Puli, a film that took him not less than a year to complete. Jiiva plays a lawyer on one hand and a fisherman on the other. “The lawyer is stylish and a born casanova who manages to attract a good number of women to his side but the fisherman wears tattered clothes and makes no compromise on his values. The movie brings out various emotions such as anger, love, joy and sadness. It’s been a challenge for me through and through,” he says.\n\nIn Ko which translates to king in Tamil, Jiiva doubles up as a photo journalist. “It’s a role I have never really played before. I literally step into the shoes of a photo journalist, covering everything from elections to crime and more. I think I make for a pretty descent photographer,” he gushes. Talking about Rowthiram, he draws a similarity between his role and that of Satya in Tamil and Hindi. “You’ll see an angry young man on screen. With these three films, I have slipped in and out of several characters. It’s great to be working back to back on projects and discovering a whole new side of you,” he says.\n\nWhile action and dark characters particularly interest him, Jiiva says he’d like to do more captivating roles. “I want people to remember me for the roles I’ve played,” he signs off.\n\nWith all communication with the actors expected to be routed through these managers, the latter are becoming more important than the former. And boy, they are good at putting up such a busy facade that they ensure that the stars remain inaccessible.\n\nActors who prefer to hire a manager, to deal with their itinerary for the day or for the month, reason that this helps them concentrate on their profession. However, there are also a few actors who have dispensed with the concept of a manager and prefer to handle all the calls and think direct communication is better than having a via media.\n\nMetrolife spoke to a cross-section of actors in the film industry on the good and bad of having a manager.\n\nA lot of actors from the Kannada film industry don’t have a manager. They believe in direct communication and reason that it adds a human element to the whole process.\n\nRamesh Aravind who has been in the industry for more than 25 years believes it’s always better to handle calls on a direct basis. He thinks legal and financial matters can be handled by a manager. “Talking to people directly could land you in trouble but the manager concept won’t work well unless you hire the right guy for the job. A manager must represent you in all respects. The right man in the right place makes all the difference and transparency is key,” reasons Ramesh who delegates a lot of responsibilities to his wife.\n\nThe Rajkumar clan has always maintained direct contact with the people of the state. Dr Rajkumar was fondly addressed as annavaru by the people and now his children too share the same rapport with the people. Shivarajkumar who recently celebrated 25 years with his fans sent out an open invitation to the people to come and celebrate with him. “My phone is on through the day and I make sure I answer the calls myself but I turn it off when I come home because that is family time. Personal contact with people gets you closer to them,” says Shivarajkumar.\n\nIt’s a different scene with actors in the other language industries. Most of them prefer to get things done through a manager. But they say they take time off to talk to people they know on a personal note. Tamil actor Jiiva thinks actors must be approachable but not necessarily reachable to everyone. “Actors are public figures and he or she can’t have all and sundry calling in. It’s always better to have someone take care of your things because it helps you focus on your work. An actor has boundaries he or she should never cross,” avers Jiiva.\n\nActors in Bollywood are perhaps the toughest to access and their managers are even tougher to get through to. They have the attitude and don’t think twice before flaunting it. Actress Raveena Tandon excels at multitasking but she thinks a manager would take off half the burden. “I can’t act, take care of my kids, manage my travel and chalk out my dates... seems like impossible to do all these things by myself. I would definitely talk to someone I know on a personal note but I think strangers must be kept at bay,” she signs off.\n\nSparsh- He is now exactly 19 months old and whenever I am with him, I take pictures and plenty of videos. Whenever I find time, I edit these pictures and make a collage, just for memory’s sake. We bathe together and even get into the pool once in a while,” says Jiiva excitedly and adds, “it’s great to come back to Sparsh after a stressful day at work.”\n\nRecollecting the time shooting for Mugamoodi, Jiiva says that they spent almost 90 days shooting only during night. “The director said that I had to learn kung fu. I had already learnt martial arts and only had to brush it up. I trained under a tough master during the shoot and he made sure I didn’t slip anywhere.\n\nI even injured myself during the shoot but now, all that trouble seems worth it,” he says.\n\nJiiva thinks the costume he wears is pretty wacky. “It is well designed and I didn’t have too much trouble slipping into it. There are no unreal moments in the film. I won’t be\n\nsurprised if all the kids start calling me Mugamoodi uncle after they watch the movie,” he laughs.\n\nhere’s an image changeover for me and I’ve really worked hard to perfect my martial art moves. The film will have an opening kung fu scene. There will be a martial art expert to supervise the scene,” explains Jiiva.\n\nJiiva sports a clean shaven look in Mugamoodi and he will continue with the same look in his next film Neethaane En Ponvasantham, where he will play three different characters — one of a school-going boy, then as a college-goer and later, a working professional. “I had to lose a lot of weight for this character and I lost 12 kgs in 45 days,” he informs.\n\nAfter this, he will switch to a political thriller with SP Jananathan’s untitled project opposite his close chum Jayam Ravi. “None of the films that I am working on this year are repetitive in character. It’s an enviable variety,” he opines.\n\nJiiva too, like a lot of actors, prefers to work on bilingual projects. Why? “Bilinguals bring in another set of audience, there’s more visibility and it definitely rakes in more business,” he observes.\n\nHe will also work with actress Trisha in Endrendrum Punnagai, which he says is another love story. And Jiiva thinks a good chemistry between co-stars matters a lot. So does he have any preferences when it come to his co-star? “I’ve always liked Tamanna’s work. I’ve never worked with her and would like to someday,” he signs off.\n\nGautham Vasudev Menon, Mysskin, S P Jananathan, Rajesh M: these are just some of the filmmakers in Tamil cinema who are working, or will soon work, with Jiiva.\n\n“I am indebted to the confidence shown by directors, producers as well as the audience. I have to work harder to match their expectations,” says Jiiva. Jiiva first appeared as a child artiste, acting in minuscule roles in a couple of films produced by his father, R B Choudry of Super Good Films. He then made his debut as a lead actor in 2003 with Aasai Aasaiyai, which was followed by Thithikudhe the same year. His subsequent release, Ameer’s mystery thriller Raam (2005) eventually gained some recognition in the film industry. Jiiva played an autistic teenager who is highly attached to his mother, but is suspected of having murdered her.\n\nRaam was followed by a string of films that spanned various genres such as Dishyum, E, Aran, Pori, Kattradhu Thamizh and Thenavattu. Among them, Katradhu Thamizh announced to the world that Jiiva wasn’t just any other run-of-the-mill actor, but one with substance and difference. The film, directed by newcomer Ram, featured Jiiva as a lower middle class postgraduate degree holder in Tamil literature, who gradually turns into a\n\npsychopath, frustrated by the inequality in the social structure.\n\nIn 2011, Jiiva’s Ko was one of the few blockbusters of the year. Directed by K V Anand, the film featured him in the role of a photojournalist who changes the fate of a state by bringing out a huge political change. Jiiva had a ball with the camera in Ko, and made sure his trademark effervescence is present at all times.\n\nIn 2012, after having essayed the role of the sole hero in films for close to a decade, the actor has most recently chosen to play the role of one of the three protagonists in the Shankar-directed Nanban. “Who will refuse an opportunity to work with Shankar? Also, 3 Idiots is one of the greatest films of Bollywood. Hence, acting in Nanban turned out to be doubly delightful,” Jiiva says.\n\nPerhaps for the first time in his career, Jiiva approached a director — Gautham Vasudev Menon — seeking a chance to work with him. Gautham Menon is currently working on Neethane En Ponvasantham with the actor. “I am a huge fan of Gautham and it was my desire to do at least one film with him. But somehow it did not materialise for a long time. So, I approached him instead and expressed my desire to work with him. That’s how Neethane En Ponvasantham happened.”\n\nJiiva is also playing an action-hero in Mugamoodi, a movie being helmed by Mysskin. Touted as the first superhero-film of Tamil cinema, Mugamoodi is being made at a whopping budget.\n\n“Yes, Mugamoodi will be grand in all aspects. It will be an action-entertainer with the Mysskin’s unique stamp,” admits Jiiva, who will be seen in a specially designed attire in this film.\n\nThe actor gains his biggest strength from wife Supriya, whom he married in late 2007. The couple have a son, Sparsha.\n\n“My world revolves around them. Whenever I find some time, I head straight back home,” says this caring husband and doting father.\n\nJiiva says he has never liked to restrict himself to a particular role. “I would like to trip on a lot of stuff. I don’t want to be typecast in a particular genre,” he says.\n\nI am an actor more than a star. For the people I would like to be a good actor and for the distributors and producers I am a star. They need their profit which is also an integral part of the film industry,” he points out.\n\nhe says. Ko was also remade in Telugu as Rangam. “The movie is doing well in the Telugu film industry. Earlier, I could roam around in the malls of\n\nHyderabad but now people there recognise me and I can’t walk that freely,” he laughs.\n\nJiiva has also played Sharman Joshi’s role in the Tamil remake of ‘3 Idiots’. “I loved ‘3 Idiots’ and I told the producer that I would like to play Sharman’s role in the Tamil version of the film. I can relate to that role and it’s a lot like how I am in real life,” he\n\nexplains.\n\nJiiva has his hands full with not a minute to spare but he has no complaints. “I have slipped in and out of several characters. It’s great to be working back to back on\n\nprojects and discovering a whole new side of myself,” he sums up.\n\nSouthscope-\"Playing the role of a photo journalist is quite interesting and what excites me more are new costumes and I can wear make-up. In my earlier fi lms like Katradhu Tamizh and Rameswaram I appeared dark, stained teeth, thick glasses, colour lungis and shattai. There were also few fi lms where I had no make-up! In Ko, I underwent a makeover of sorts with a snazzy guest and guess what? My character's name is Ashwin and it sounds so cool!\"\n\nQuiz him about working with K V Anand who delivered a hit fi lm Ayan with Suriya last year, Jiiva says, \"He is like a machine gun and I am happy to be a magazine in his gun!\" More chuckles later he explains, \"Anand sir works so fast I have trouble coping up with him! But I just love his style of working. I usually like working while I am hyper active on the sets and it helps me to deliver my best.\"\n\nSp- It is directed by Sai Ramanan who debuts and I have Divya Spandana and Soundarya as my heroines. It has been tough but great fun to switch from one character to another each so vastly different,\" he recalls.\n\nAsk him why he's decided to go commercial with a vengeance and he explains, \"Well, usually people do commercial films and then start experimental cinema. I was one guy who did the reverse! I feel people notice you when you do things differently and I was right because the fi lms like Raam and Katradhu Tamizh did get me accolades for my performance. But now I need to get on the commercial bandwagon to earn some money as well. Many of my past fi lms were good but some didn't make that much money. I don't want to become a serious guy. I don't want my audiences to get totally sad as soon as they see my face on the posters thinking sad films is all I do! I want people to relate to me, laugh, cry , enjoy and be thrilled when watching my films.\n\nLike Siva Manasule Sakthi was such a hit. People even today yell out' quarter sollu machi', a line from the fi lm, when they see me. Even my Kacheri Arambam did very well in B and C centres and Thenavattu was a hit too. So that's the way I want it to be from now on.\"\n\nSon of veteran producer RB Chowdary and with an established banner like Super Good Films behind him, is there any pressure to succeed high on this young man? \"Yeah sure,\" nods Jiiva. \"People expect a lot of things from me, that I should do good fi lms and have no controversies etc. I cannot equal my dad's achievements! He has been in the industry for thirty years and a producer for twenty five years after all!\"\n\nSo how is his equation with his dad? What happens when his experience collides with Jiiva's youth? Jiiva gets in to a serious tone, \"I count on my dad's experience and we discuss a lot of things. He values my opinion. I am like any other son with my dad. I ask him to listen to scripts but at the end of the day, I go with my gut feeling about a fi lm. I am pretty independent minded and you can see it in my choice of fi lms! But I show him the double positive of my fi lms for his opinion. We do have diff erences like in the case of SMS which he didn't like but I stuck to my gut feeling and it did well in the end. At the end of the day however I tell him I will make decision on my own risk. I am young and if I don't succeed and fail while making decisions, I will balance it out in my next fi lm.\" So what's the one advice dad has given him which he follows? \"He has told me to keep distributors happy and then the audience,\" reveals Jiiva.\n\nHaving born in to a fi lm family, does he think it helped him to grow? \"I am always asked this question !\" laments Jiiva. \"It is easy to enter the industry but diffi cult to sustain yourself. Everyday I have the pressure to live up to my father's success.\" Competition however doesn't bother him. \"Why do I have to bother about it? Films are my life and I enjoy doing them. I have no time to think about what others are doing!\"\n\nAnd friendships form a strong point in his scheme of things. Jiiva did a small guest appearance for good friend Arya in the recent super hit Boss Engira Baskaran in the climax. Speaking about it he says, \"Arya did a cameo in SMS and this time when director Rajesh asked me to do an appearance in Arya's fi lm I was more than happy to! We had a blast in both the fi lms and it was good fun. And I guess the audience liked it too!\" Besides films, Jiiva has loads of passions he religiously follows. \"Yeah I have a lot of hobbies that keep me busy when I am not shooting. I collect posters and Supriya and I have made this huge collage of fi lms at home together. I take pics with my Canon 7D camera and edit my home videos with my HD Cam. One day I want to make my own short fi lm on Chennai. On Sundays I chill out over a barbeque with my friends and on holidays I love trekking. Sketching abstract faces and painting furniture is what I do in my free time and the latest on my list is carving statues and odd shapes,\" he reveals.\n\nAnd Jiiva has one more sweet responsibility at home now. The couple are blessed with a baby boy on October 14 in Chennai and he is all set to turn a dotting dad.\n\nWith all that to keep him busy does he have time for the numbers game? \"Sure! I want to be a Number One someday ! I have the talent and the right attitude and aptitude to take me there!\" he signs off.\n\nJIIVA UNPLUGGED\n\nJiiva is going ‘mainstream’ with Ko , his upcoming film. Four of his projects – Ko, Singam Puli, Vandhan Vendran and the 3 Idiots remake, are soon in offing. This Valentine’s month, the actor talks about turning a dad three months back and being married to his childhood sweet heart. Rinku Gupta listens to him.\n\nHE’S looking leaner and meaner with his new haircut and toned appearance which he agrees, is for Ko. “The film is something I am really looking forward to. It will certainly be a big leap for me in my career graph since the expectations are high from this Jiiva - KV Anand combo.” Acting with Karthiga who debuts in Tamil and Piaa Bajpai, Jiiva plays an investigative photo journalist. Ask him about the experience and he says, “I was always interested in taking photos and even edited my own videos. I did a course in multi media before I became an actor. So when Anand sir gave me this 7D Canon camera for the film, I just grabbed the opportunity and clicked away to glory.” The homework he did for the role involved watching documentaries given by Anand to get the feel of the work of photo journalists and their body language.\n\nJiiva‘s current personal portfolio includes candid shots of kids with each picture speaking a thousand words. “I may have an exhibit someday,” he shrugs, clearly in love with his work. The music by Harris Jayaraj has taken them to exotic locales and the unit traveled to Norway for one song. “We had to trek for seven hours and return by 4 pm since the light was less. Once we even got caught in a blizzard! No one usually comes there to shoot and even people there were surprised! But the results are totally worth the trouble we took,” he reveals.\n\nOne terrifying experience during the shoot was jumping from the third floor of a building near Sowcarpet in Chennai. “There was a fire around me and I had to jump. It was the climax shot and I was really exhausted after a nearly round the clock shoot. I just did my shot and jumped and before I knew it, it was over. It was only later that I realized how dangerous it had been and the terrifying moments registered!”\n\nJiiva’s next is Shankar’s 3 Idiots and the actor is gung ho about the project. “I play the character played by Sharman Joshi in the original. Of course I am super excited since I loved the original and now I get to work on the project with Shankar sir!” concludes Jiiva.\n\nFEATURED ARTICLES\n\nGautham Vasudev Menon, Mysskin, S P Jananathan, Rajesh M: these are just some of the filmmakers in Tamil cinema who are working, or will soon work, with Jiiva.\n\n“I am indebted to the confidence shown by directors, producers as well as the audience. I have to work harder to match their expectations,” says Jiiva. Jiiva first appeared as a child artiste, acting in minuscule roles in a couple of films produced by his father, R B Choudry of Super Good Films. He then made his debut as a lead actor in 2003 with Aasai Aasaiyai, which was followed by Thithikudhe the same year. His subsequent release, Ameer’s mystery thriller Raam (2005) eventually gained some recognition in the film industry. Jiiva played an autistic teenager who is highly attached to his mother, but is suspected of having murdered her.\n\nRaam was followed by a string of films that spanned various genres such as Dishyum, E, Aran, Pori, Kattradhu Thamizh and Thenavattu. Among them, Katradhu Thamizh announced to the world that Jiiva wasn’t just any other run-of-the-mill actor, but one with substance and difference. The film, directed by newcomer Ram, featured Jiiva as a lower middle class postgraduate degree holder in Tamil literature, who gradually turns into a\n\npsychopath, frustrated by the inequality in the social structure.\n\nIn 2011, Jiiva’s Ko was one of the few blockbusters of the year. Directed by K V Anand, the film featured him in the role of a photojournalist who changes the fate of a state by bringing out a huge political change. Jiiva had a ball with the camera in Ko, and made sure his trademark effervescence is present at all times.\n\nIn 2012, after having essayed the role of the sole hero in films for close to a decade, the actor has most recently chosen to play the role of one of the three protagonists in the Shankar-directed Nanban. “Who will refuse an opportunity to work with Shankar? Also, 3 Idiots is one of the greatest films of Bollywood. Hence, acting in Nanban turned out to be doubly delightful,” Jiiva says.\n\nPerhaps for the first time in his career, Jiiva approached a director — Gautham Vasudev Menon — seeking a chance to work with him. Gautham Menon is currently working on Neethane En Ponvasantham with the actor. “I am a huge fan of Gautham and it was my desire to do at least one film with him. But somehow it did not materialise for a long time. So, I approached him instead and expressed my desire to work with him. That’s how Neethane En Ponvasantham happened.”\n\nJiiva is also playing an action-hero in Mugamoodi, a movie being helmed by Mysskin. Touted as the first superhero-film of Tamil cinema, Mugamoodi is being made at a whopping budget.\n\n“Yes, Mugamoodi will be grand in all aspects. It will be an action-entertainer with the Mysskin’s unique stamp,” admits Jiiva, who will be seen in a specially designed attire in this film.\n\nThe actor gains his biggest strength from wife Supriya, whom he married in late 2007. The couple have a son, Sparsha.\n\n“My world revolves around them. Whenever I find some time, I head straight back home,” says this caring husband and doting father.\n\nI want to be known as a good performer: Jiiva\n\nHe was seen as a young promising star before Ko happened. The K V Anand-directed movie was a blockbuster and Jiiva's stock rose to unprecedented levels and he was being considered one of the most bankable stars in Kollywood.\n\nIt has been a year since Ko happened and changed Jiiva's life as an actor. He has featured in a few films subsequently but success wasn't forthcoming before Shankar's multi-starrer Nanban came along.\n\nHis role in the movie starring Vijay and Illeana came in for praise and he certainly was on the rise.\n\nThough he hasn't had any release for some time now, Jiiva has a slew of prestigious projects on hand. He has almost completed work on Mysskin's Mugamoodi which is in the super-hero film genre and is part of Gautham Vasudev Menon's Nee Thaane En Ponvasantham and seems to be getting better as a performer. He has also begun choosing his movies with care.\n\nJiiva shared his thoughts on working in Mugamoodi, Here are a few excerpts from the interview.\n\nAre you happy with the way your career has panned out so far?\n\nYes, pretty much. It seems as if it was a long while ago. Having been in the industry for close to 10 years, I have learnt a lot and also enjoyed at the same time.\n\nOn the success of Ko and the subsequent journey…\n\nI was overwhelmed by the success of the movie and credit must go to the director (K V Anand) for shaping up the character and the movie so well. Things haven't been too bad after that but I would have loved to have added one or more hits. I am looking forward to Mugamoodi.\n\nTell us about Mugamoodi and working with Mysskin…\n\nI am so happy to be working with Mysskin, who is such a good film-maker. He has got the best out of me.Mugamoodi is a super-hero subject and I hope that it clicks with the audience. It is totally different from Ko but I loved doing it.\n\nYour commitment and professionalism came in for praise after a recent mishap while shooting. Your take…\n\nIt was tough but as a professional I needed to get back to work quickly. Also there were date issues so I returned to the shoot as soon as I could.\n\nYour future projects?\n\nAm pretty chuffed about the movie with Gautham, then I will be doing Endrendrum Punnagai with Ahmed. I am particularly looking forward to the movie with Gautham who is known for his high-quality and stylish film-making.\n\nFuture plans?\n\nFuture looks good and I want to be known as a good actor and want to do varied roles. Not that I haven't tried it so far but would love to do a mix of roles so that fans acknowledge me as a good performer.\n\nJiiva Rasigar Mandram Event at PlanetRadioCity\n\nWhen fans get a chance to meet their silver screen icons, joy and excitement fill the air. It couldn’t be any different when it was versatile actor Jiiva the handsome man from Neethane En Pon Vasantham, at an event conducted by Radio City, in Deccan Plaza on Saturday.\n\nRadio City has initiated a concept christened ‘Rasigar Mandram’ (fan club), an attempt by the radio channel to act as a platform by bringing together Kollywood and its indispensable asset — cinema lovers.\n\nBeing an actor of this era, people would expect young girls and guys to be a part of an event like this. But, it took many by surprise to see people of different age groups, from toddlers to elderly people, in the gathering, with each one having words of praise for the Ko actor.\n\nOne could not miss seeing small kids singing his song, young girls gushing about his smile, young guys admiring his sense of humour and old people praising his genuine acting. Satisfying Tamil audience and scoring among all age groups is a feat that’s almost impossible for an actor in today’s generation. But it was evident from the crowd that the actor did it with style.\n\nSensing this deep connection and bonding, Radio City started this concept with actor Jiiva and called it ‘Jeeva Rasigar Mandram,’ and made people take an active part in it by conducting various SMS contests.\n\nThe finalists who were selected, were given the chance to meet him in person. It was a delight for everybody who turned up, especially Devi, a final-year student from MOP, who could not hide her excitement to meet him. “I completely fell for him the moment I saw him in Neethane En Pon Vasantham,” she said.\n\nWhen everybody’s mind was rushing to question the long unanswered query about why Jiiva was made the first guest of the initiative, Radio City RJ Raja unveiled the mystery by sharing the channel’s long standing relationship with Jiiva and their valuable friendship.\n\nThe channel also took this as an opportunity to celebrate Jiiva’s successful 10 year-stint in the Tamil industry. Being the first of its kind, Radio City also promised to come "
