        "text": "“Yet all the adulation and accolade that came my way, for essaying the character of ‘Jessie’ in the Telugu hit ‘Ye Maya Chesave’, helped to make me more responsible and thoughtful when it came to choosing films. ‘Ye Maya Chesave’ was made in Tamil as ‘Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa’ with Trisha essaying Jessie’s role.\n\n“Trisha is my favourite heroine, and I never really got the jitters wondering whether I would be able to match her acting skills, thanks to my director Gautham Menon. I must give due credit to him as he never actually tells you what to do but gives you enough freedom and his calm and composed manner is a great help on the sets.\n\nCome to think of it, I never wanted to be an actress, or else I would not have burnt the midnight oil trying to ace my exams! Anyway, now that I am in films, I cannot think of any other profession, which would keep me as fulfilled.\n\nWorking with ‘Prince’ (Mahesh Babu), was a truly great experience. Oblivious to his superstar status, Mahesh Babu is totally dedicated to his craft and considers his director as god. His advice—of treating every film as your first film—I shall never forget. He has the talent and yes, looks too!\n\nAt present, there is one film that I am very excited about—the SS Rajamouli-directed film, ‘Eega’. I must admit that I have never before seen or heard such a story; it is a novel concept for sure. All I can reveal is that it is a love story, which then turns into a revenge saga. I do not want to limit myself by saying that I wish to work with so and so actor—they are all great and I would love to work with all of them. But having said that, I would love to work with Suriya.\n\nApart from ‘Eega’ and ‘Neethaane En Ponvasantham’, there are three other films that I am doing, but for sentimental reasons, would prefer not to disclose their names. Nowadays, I find that films have become an obsession with me. They have become my world. I guess I have fallen in love with them."
