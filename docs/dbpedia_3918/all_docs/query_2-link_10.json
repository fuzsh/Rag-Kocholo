        "text": "The relation of human being and nature, peace and war, the quest for mystic invisible world and women empowerment are the four key themes reflected in the cinema of Hayao Miyazaki. Mahatma Gandhi has also addressed these issues in his writings and speeches. Both of them inherit the ideas of Buddha to make their positions. They have similarities of certain level and differences as well. Keeping in view the socioeconomic cultural backgrounds of Japan and India, this paper will analyze the reasons, situations and factors of their similarities and distinct understandings of these issues. Japan is a capitalistic, technological advanced and rich country. India stands almost contrary to it. These situations have a great impact on the foundation of culture and the society of Japan and India. That is why Miyazaki becomes a fan of fighter planes and Gandhi advocates Charkha, a simple weaving-wheel machine. 'Hind Swaraj' is an important document to understand the troubles of modern civilization. Miyazaki too finally reflects a hidden regret about the 'misuse' of modern technologies, particularly of atom bombs and fighter-planes. Is there any contradiction in Miyazaki? This comparative study finds that Miyazaki, partially, failed to relate the technological advancement and its repercussions on nature and society. Gandhi was clearer. Both advocates democracy and pacifism, but this socio-cultural analysis shows that Miyazaki believes in 'utilization' of nature with the help of technology, whereas Gandhi emphasizes on 'co-existence' with nature. Technological advancements, for Gandhi, are always a threat to nature. Gandhi empowers their fellow revolutionaries with the help of spiritual energy. Miyazaki also does so equipping his characters with technical objects and gadgets. Miyazaki creates his movies and characters to express his ideas and positions. Mahatma Gandhi seems to be a hero, a protagonist of a movie in his actual life and achieves his goal with moral and spiritual power, questioning the relevance of technology.\n\nThis article first examines representations of women's desire in Tamil cinema, from highly implicit and non-transgressive representations of desire in an older movie to linguistically explicit and transgressive representations of desire in a recent hit movie. We then examine how such contemporary filmic representations are related to what we call a mode of realist spectatorship, and how this mode of spectatorship is linked to a particular social group (male youth) and to film form. We argue that the emergence of this mode of spectatorship, the films associated with it, and their connection to male youth are due to changes in the film market and to differential socialization by generation. Finally, we argue for realism in film as holding when film form and spectatorship are highly calibrated in the following way: some set of filmic representations are evaluated by viewers and filmmakers through culturally mediated classifications of \"real\" and \"unreal\" which are operationalized truth-functionally in events of evaluation; such representations presuppose these classifications, and by virtue of regular presupposition can entail an experience of \"reality\" for viewers.\n\nHistory of Modern India is ripe with examples of marginalization of Dalits', which is against empowerment / Self-respect. There are various factors that contribute towards the marginalization of these people some of them include Exclusion, globalization, displacements, disasters etc. In India, films started making an appearance around 1900s. As the films drifted from its close kin \" stage play \" , a different set of grammar was established and the hermeneutics of films started to evolve later. The new form struck the caste system, let in the oppressed people into theater and allowed for an equal treatment without discrimination. This started to irk the influential and pushed them to enter into the film industry. After which, films took a new form of stereotypical representation, glorification of caste and caste based differentiations, denigrations of the lower communities, portraying them as powerless etc. This study attempted to elicit the arbitrary meanings of both Dalit and Non Dalit filmmakers' texts and establish that they significantly contradict with constitutive meaning. A Semiotics analysis of Dalit and non-Dalit films underpins this study. In many instances the work of dalits seemingly fuel the campaigns being initiated by political parties, which instigate socio-political movement against Dalit instead of counter these movements.\n\nThe current study is a qualitative investigation on the identity and the personality of female gamblers portrayed in Chinese gambling movies. Eleven Chinese films produced from 2000 to 2017 were selected for this study. A qualitative content analysis was employed to understand the gambling motivation and the identity development of the characters in the movie. The findings indicate that women gamblers often gamble to escape from personal emotional problems. For a majority of these gamblers, their motivation for gambling is to please their partners and to win back a relationship. Further, on the movies produced prior to 2006, the identities of female gamblers are often depicted with a negative overtone. In many instances, they are described as individuals with little education and career development and having personal emotional problems. However, female characters in movies produced after 2008 demonstrate a more positive portrayal of the identities of women gamblers, in terms of career success and personal development. This shift of identity may be due to the fact that, since early 2000s, more women have become successful in their careers in business and the government services in Hong Kong. In many elite occupations such as medical doctors and lawyers, a lot of women are having the equal professional status as men do. Further, gambling, a traditional Chinese social disgrace, especially for women, is now more acceptable in the Chinese community. The current study highlights the important point that women in the Chinese communities are no longer marginalized, socially and psychologically, as housewives only-they can be successful business executives, medical doctors, lawyers, politicians and may be the \" Goddess of Gamblers \" as well."
