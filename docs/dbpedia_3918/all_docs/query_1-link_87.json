        "text": "ATTAKATHI (2012)\n\nDirector: Pa. Ranjith\n\nCasts: Dinesh, Nandhitha\n\nMusic: Santosh Narayanan\n\nLanguage: Tamil\n\nGenre: Romantic Comedy\n\nLove is an oft-beat subject in Tamil Cinema but looking from the unique promotions and coming from a Venkat Prabhu’s assistant, Pa.Ranjith, one could expect a fresh treatment in this film. Will Attakathi, a film containing full bunch of debutants, be able to join the list of sleeper hits of the year?\n\nSynopsis\n\nDinakaran alias, Dina is an average looking, tutorial student who comes from a middle class family. Dina or as his friends call him, ‘Attakathi’ (Cardboard Knife) does not have any ambitions or aspirations in life, but chasing for love behind any girls he sees. But when you expect him to dread over a one side love, he just moves on casually to another girl. Constant failures pushes him to give up on love. Life takes a turn when he enters collage where he is being hailed as ‘Route Thala’, translated from a wimpy young man to a rough and tough collage.\n\nBut what happens when his old crush, Poornima (Nandhita) joins the same college as him. Will love blossom again?\n\nStory – Screenplay\n\nThe film’s main strength is the casual characterization and mood which it travels from start to end. It diverts away from the tired and tested formula of portraying one side love and gives us a practical love story laced with lots of situational comedy.\n\nThe coming of age feel has been brought out by the director very convincingly. There are many relatable scenes such as Dina standing at the footboard of the bus singing to woo the girls. To add on, Attakathi also injects an important message so subtly about moving on from a one side love without degrading the nature of real love.\n\nOn the flipside, Attakathi’s nature of screenplay does get tiring at times as many scenes looks repetitive. But Pa.Ranjith compensates with an apt climax which will ensure a smile on your face\n\nIn overall, Attakathi is a practical and fresh love story.\n\nCasting & Performance\n\nDinesh as Dinakaran steals the show by such engrossing screen presence. Ten minutes into the film, he pulls the audience inside the film with such applicable portrayal. Be it Dina or ‘Route Thala’ he does it with finesse. No doubt, Dinesh is here to stay.\n\nNandhita as Poornima, has the perfect ‘girl next door’ look and she will definitely grow on us as the film progresses.\n\nThe entire bunch of newbies have been handled very well by the director which resulted in a fun fare entirely.\n\nTechnicality\n\nP.K. Varma’s cinematography (using DSLR) have captured the rural areas very beautifully with his earthy tones. The frames which are shot digitally looks and feels very realistic.\n\nMusic director, Santosh Narayanan’s unique sound is interesting to hear and he has his own distinctive style which stands out.\n\nT.Ramalingam’s set design is praiseworthy as he brings the different time period so subtly realistic. His work is definitely a boost in aiding the film’s content.\n\nEditor. Leo John Paul’s timing in cutting the comedy scenes brings out the situational wits effectively.\n\nIn overall, young bunch of new technicians, successfully give a different look and feel to a rural story.\n\nBottomline\n\nAttakathi is certainly a new age love story told in a very refreshing manner which will not be a surprise if it creates a new trend of love stories in Kollywood.\n\nVerdict: This ‘Attakathi’ will surely stick to your hearts\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nNEETHANE EN PONVASANTHAM FILM REVIEW\n\nNEETHANE EN PONVASANTHAM (2012) Director: Gautham Vasudev Menon Casts: Jiiva, Samantha, Santhanam Music: Ilayaraja Language: Tamil Genre: Romance Life gets defined by the mind altering moments which occurs at the most unexpected circumstances in life. Gautham Vasudev Menon continues to explore such moments in his distinctive style in Neethaane En Ponvasantham, where he refines the threads he already used in Vaaranam Aayiram and Vinnai Thaandi Varuvaaya . Neethane En Ponvasantham fits the bill perfectly as a so called ‘concluding’ part of the trilogy. Synopsis Gautham Menon experiments in a ‘moment’ driven story this time by surfacing through four chapters of Varun (Jiiva) and Nithya (Samantha), from the age of 8 to 23 years old. Childhood buddies, Varun and Nithya share an unconditional bond since school days. Even when tested by ego clashes and misunderstanding, destiny always brings them together at different stages of life. But what happens wh\n\nPULIKKUTHI PANDI (2021)\n\nCritic - No. 191 Director : M Muthiah Produced by: SUN Entertainment Casts: Vikram Prabhu, Lakshmi Menon, Samuthirakani, Vela Ramamoorthy, R.K.Suresh, Singam Puli, Dheena, Bala Language: Tamil Music: N.R. Raghunathan Genre: Action, Drama SYNOPSIS: Pulikkuthi Pandi (Vikram Prabhu), a ruthless youngster who fights for justice, transforms into a kind and humble husband for his wife, Pechi (Lakshmi Menon). But as fate turns brutal, his patience is tested. REVIEW: After a decent streak of 5 rural dramas, director Muthaiah has anchored his trademark and filmmaking voice within the genre. Out of his previous films, I liked his treatment for Komban (2015) and Marudhu (2016) where he has centered his story against relationship conflicts and stakes, in a very earnest manner. Despite being quite inconsistent in character building, Muthiah’s films typically work to tell a message in the end for the audience (fully convincing or not is another issue). Shot during the pandemic period, Puli\n\nKUMKI FILM REVIEW\n\nKUMKI (2012) Director: Prabhu Solomon Casts: Vikram Prabhu, Laksmi Menon, Thambi Ramaiah Music: D. Imman Language: Tamil Genre: Romantic Thriller After achieving a humongous success with the emotionally spellbinding Myna, Prabhu Solomon strikes back with a huge idea. With Vikram Prabhu (the grandson of legendary actor, Sivaji Ganesan) on board together with his National award gem, Thambi Ramaiah, Prabhu Solomon has invited all the eyes on his film. D.Imman’s soundtrack proving to be phenomenal hit, Kumki has raised its expectation bar to its highest. So will Kumki be able to repeat the success of its predecessor? Synopsis Kumki is a term used to describe specially trained elephants that safeguard the crops and chase away stray, violent elephants that lurk around the village, back to their forest. When Aadhi Kaadu village is terrorized by such rogue elephant, they request for a Kumki elephant to safeguard their village. However, when the r"
