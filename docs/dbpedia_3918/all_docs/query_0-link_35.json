        "text": "No! There are certain situations that are mine and there are a few others which are borne out of my imagination, a kind of extrapolation of my thoughts. When I had narrated the story to Jiiva, he felt it was his story. That’s how we arrived at the tagline ‘this could be your love story’. I put myself in hero’s shoes and handled it as realistically as possible. NEP is not entirely from my life, but yes, it has happened in my life.\n\nNo! NEP is not my story. It is my partner Reshma’s story. After numerous discussions, as a team, we had decided to make this into a film. We had sent the story to Ram (Telugu) as an email attachment and he favorably responded. That’s when we thought we can do this in Tamil as well and wrote the dialogues and Jiiva came in. Then Ram could not do and Nani stepped in. That’s how NEP came in. It is Reshma’s story which I turned into my style and wrote the screen play and dialogues.\n\nVery definitely! If such a script attacks me and I am able to plunge myself into it, I will definitely do a rural based subject. Although NEP did not happen in my life, I have gone deep into it and worked. If I get such a script, I will definitely do and I do have interest.\n\nHe made me feel comfortable. After I shot 40% of the movie, I went to him, showed him what I shot, discussed the script, explained the situations and then we took a joint decision to go to London to produce music there, recording just the voice here. After we finished the movie, we got a lovely background score. NEP is a musical and music drives the film. Raja has beautifully conveyed through music the feelings of two people in love.\n\nIt was the time when we were returning from Agra to Delhi after shooting the Hindi VTV where Samantha was playing a small role. It was also the time when ‘Ye maya chesave’ and a couple of Samantha’s Telugu films were big hits in Andhra. We thought she would be ideal for Telugu with Ram as co-star and gave the script of NEP to her. As I was talking to her I realized that there was something different about her from the Ye Maya chesave days. She looked more confident and appeared to know what she was talking. We took a joint decision of casting her in the Tamil version too.\n\nWhen we were shooting she got the language so right in Tamil and Telugu and got the characterization perfect and at that time, Hindi version was also there and we decided to rope her in Hindi too. It made sense to shoot one girl with three boys as to get three heroines on board would be chaotic logistically. Samantha seamlessly blended into the character and has worked so hard for the film. She has dubbed in Tamil and she is here to stay. With NEP, you can say that Samantha has put herself in the map.\n\nAfter 10-15 minutes into the film, you will forget Jiiva and Santhanam. You will only see Varun and Prakash. You would feel a chemistry between the boys. He is Jiiva’s friend and comes throughout the film. He plays a very sweet role and comedy is also in accordance with the script. There is no separate comedy track. Film starts with a bang and Jiiva and Santhanam are there in it. NEP is a love story and all of them take the scenes forward. Santhanam has got good lines in NEP and I like working with him.\n\nYou can’t call that a cameo, it is a disgrace to the word! It’s just a fleeting appearance. Santhanam asked me if I could come as directing Simbu in KLTA. He has helped us a lot in NEP adjusting dates when Samantha was unwell and I like him a lot. Many have asked me to appear in their films but I have refused. But I did it for Santhanam."
