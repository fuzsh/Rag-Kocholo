The publication is merely a conventional one, in- complete, imperfect, and presenting no innovations in taxonomy. Naturally the work is chiefly of local interest, as a high per- centage of the species described are confined to the Philippines. To the student of the Philippine flora, as such, and to authors of monographs and revisions of families and genera extending to the Philippines, it is important that the status of Blanco’s species be determined. However, as no botanical material rep- resenting Blanco’s species was preserved by him, or if pre- served, is no longer extant, the matter of determining the identity of very many of his species presents by no means a simple problem. The object of the present work is to record what I have been able to determine regarding the status of Blanco’s species and their relationships with those described by other authors, based on sixteen years experience in prosecut- ing botanical work in the Philippines. Hooker f. considered that, on account of the unsatisfactory nature of Blanco’s work, it was undesirable to devote time to the identification of his species; which, perhaps, well reflects the attitude of the botanists of the middle of the last century. No botanist, not primarily interested in the Philippine flora, was in a position to do much actual work on the status of Blanco’s species, and up to the immediate present data and material by which Blanco’s species could satisfactorily be deter- mined have not been available. Thus, in general, Blanco’s species were considered to be of little importance and, being difficult of interpretation to the average botanist working only with dried material, were frequently ignored or briefly discussed as unknown or imperfectly known ones by authors of various monographs. The necessity for a critical determination of the status of Blanco’s species and of their relationships with those described ‘Hooker, J. D., and Thomson, T. Flora Indica 1 (1855) Introductory Essay 56. | 5 6 SPECIES BLANCOANAE by other authors is a natural corollary of the general acceptance of the principle of priority in the selection of the names of species where synonymy is involved. The matter has already been discussed by me in connection with my detailed study of the species described in Rumphius’s Herbarium Amboinense,? from which the following passage (p. 43) is quoted: Up to the close of the last century comparatively little attention was given to the question of priority in the names of plants, and many authors accepted or changed generic and specific names at will. It is true that in a majority of cases names well established were generally accepted, but changes were often made for the most trivial reasons. In work prosecuted under these lax but easy methods of selecting names for plants, the exact identity of obscure species was a matter of relatively slight importance. With the establishment and general acceptance of the principle of prior- ity in selecting the name of species, it has become important, from the view point of stability of nomenclature, to determine so far as possible the exact status of the species described by older authors. It would admittedly be convenient if many of the names proposed by early authors could be dis- carded, but if we ignore a species of one author, any botanist at any time would be justified in likewise ignoring species proposed by any other author, which would result in a veritable chaotic condition in nomenclature. We can no longer look on the work of this or that author, no matter how incomplete or imperfect, as unworthy of consideration, nor can we accept Hooker’s dictum regarding species proposed by such authors as Blanco, that it was undesirable to devote time to their identification.

Bureau of Science, Manila (1917) 1-595. ee eee ee INTRODUCTION THE FIRST EDITION OF BLANCO’S FLORA DE FILIPINAS The first edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas * was printed in Manila in 1837. It is an octavo volume consisting of a pro- logue, a general introduction, and the systematic arrangement and description of about 903 species under binomial names. The work is written wholly in Spanish. The prologue briefly re- lates the circumstances under which the work was prepared and contains a review of the botanical work accomplished by Blanco’s predecessors in the Philippines; namely, Fathers Clain, Delgado, Mercado, and Santa Maria, but with no mention of the vastly more important work of Camel; and a brief mention of the work of Née and Pineda, of the Malaspina Expedition, but no mention of the more important explorations of Haenke, of the same expedition. The general introduction, occupying pages IX-LX XVIII, consists of an explanation of the terms used in descriptive botany and an explanation of the Linnean system of classification, with a list of the admitted genera arranged under their Linnean classes. The generic descriptions are greatly abbreviated, but the specific descriptions are usually long and detailed, although often general in nature; some of them are very short and im- perfect. To these are often added long or short discussions, giving data of economic importance, occurrence, time of flower- ing, native names, etc.; this supplementary data is often of more _ value in locating and interpreting Blanco’s species than are the descriptions themselves. The work is supplied with an alpha- _ betic index to generic names; one to native names, in which not all of the native names mentioned in the text are included; and a tabulation of the various genera screaming to the economic uses of the various species. In the text various species that Blanco was unable to refer to their proper generic positions are described under their native names. These are usually placed under the Linnean classes to which they pertain and cannot in any ‘sense of the word be * Flora de Filipinas. Segun el Sistema sexual de Linneo. Por el P. Fr. Manuel Blanco, Agustino Calzado (1837) LXXVIII +1-887. +* 8 SPECIES BLANCOANAE treated as genera, nor were they so considered by Blanco. They include descriptions of: e Alamag. Cunalon. Longayan. Apulong. Doctojon. Malulucban. Balibai., Ge-jua. Oyisan. Banago. Hinguio. Palindan. Binouang. Iloilo. Pandapanda, Bitlag. Inoyaban. Pasac. Calamansalai. Lanzones. Patdang buys Calicot. Lapolapo. Putian. Camotain. Loctong. Sangumay. Corong. In the present work no special attempt has been made to locate these species, except in those cases where Blanco himself or other authors have later made them the bases of binomials. With few exceptions none of the descriptions have any bearing on questions of nomenclature. The new genera proposed, all but three of which have proved to be invalid, as indicated by the reductions here given, are: Azaola (=Payena). Manungala .(=Samadera). Balingayum (=Calogyne). Palaquium. Calius (=Streblus). Quilamum (=Crypteronia). Cobanga (=Canscora). — Quilesia ( Sipser opeiamablle Enrila (=Ventilago). Soala (= Lumanaja (=Homonoia). Sulipa (= deca: Lunasia. Tala (=Limnophila). Malaisia. Tayotum ._(=Geniostoma). Mamboga (=Mitragyna). THE SECOND EDITION OF BLANCO’S FLORA DE FILIPINAS The second edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas‘ in plan is the same as the first. It was printed in Manila, and appeared shortly after Blanco’s death, which occurred April 1, 1845. In the publication of this work a subsidy of 500 pesos was granted by the local organization, La Sociedad econémica de anntigos del pais.® . In this edition about 1,132 species are described under ‘Late binomials, and 27 under their native names. Four species de- scribed in the first edition are excluded while 198 are_ added, making the total number of species described in the first and ‘Flora de Filipinas, segun el Sistema sexual de Linneo.

The SPP ns Islands 1493-1898, 50 tei 69; 52 (1907) 312. iss INTRODUCTION 9 second editions under binomial or trinomial names, about 1,136. Numerous changes in specific names occur, but these are dif- ficult to detect except by the tedious comparisons of descriptions, as when a name used in the first edition was altered in the second one, the fact was not stated; there are no references to the first edition. In many cases changes of names were purely arbitrary, while others were made in Blanco’s attempt to reduce his own species to those of other authors; most such changes are erroneous. The numerous typographical errors in the second edition are probably due largely to the fact that Blanco died before the work was printed, so that proof reading devolved on individuals with little botanical knowledge. In the second edition four of the generic names proposed by Blanco in the first edition were discarded for those of other authors, and the following new genera were described, all of which fall as synonyms: Elcana [=Cerbera], Legazpia [=Torenia], Salgada [=Cryptocarya], Llanosia [=Ternstroe- mia], Quirosia [=Crotalaria], and Salceda [=Thea]. Thus of the genera proposed and described by Blanco in the two editions of his work the only valid ones are Lunasia, Malaisia, and Palaquium, with Soala remaining as one of entirely doubtful status. THE THIRD EDITION OF BLANCO’S FLORA DE FILIPINAS The sumptuous third edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas * was prepared many years after Blanco’s death and is entirely the work of Fathers Celestino Fernandez-Villar and Andrés Naves. The Flora de Filipinas is included in the first three volumes and, with slight and unimportant changes, is an exact reprint of the second edition with the addition of Latin transla- tions of Blanco’s descriptions. The authors practically succeeded only in extending the contents of Blanco’s compact second edi- 2 _ *Flora de Filipinas por el P.

Sci. 12 (1917) Bot. 118-116.Ju 10 SPECIES BLANCOANAE tion through three bulky and unwieldy folio volumes without adding a single item to our knowledge of the Philippine flora. Unfortunately page references to the first and second editions are omitted. In consideration of the date at which it was printed, it is indeed a curious publication. The third edition follows the Linnean system of classification, one that had been obsolete for at least half a century. The only deviations from the second edition are the additions of a few species from the first edition, that Blanco himself eliminated from the second; and occasionally the substitution of the specific name given in the first edition for the one given in the second. The only praise that can be given in this glorified edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas is that the Latin translations made Blanco’s descriptions more available to botanists generally; yet nearly forty years before, Walpers* had published Latin translations of about 180 of Blanco’s diagnoses of new species, which is the part of Blanco’s work of most general interest to taxonomists. Two editions were issued, one the “edicién de lujo,” the other the “edicién econémica.’”’ The cheap edition differs from the edition de luxe in that it is printed on less expensive paper, and the plates are not colored. The plates differ further from those of the edition de luxe in that they are numbered. The cheap edition was sold at 1.25 dollars per fascicle in the Phil- ippines, and 1.75 dollars outside of the Philippines; while the edition de luxe was sold at 2.25 dollars and 2.50 dollars respec- tively, the prices in Mexican silver. Each fascicle was adver- tised to consist of sixteen pages of text and six plates. The cheap edition was to consist of numbered volumes; but the edi- tion de luxe was to be numbered, and the edition limited to 500 copies. The plan of numbering the volumes was apparently abandoned. The edition de luxe, while an expensive work, is by no means a rare one; but the cheap edition is exceedingly rare. I have seen but a single incomplete copy of the latter, consisting of a complete set of the text and about 140 plates. This copy is in the library of the Bureau of Agriculture, Manila. The fourth volume of the third edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas is by far the most important part of the work. It consists of three separately paged parts, of which the third, the Novissima Appendix, is the only one of real value. - \"Linnaea 16 (1842) Litt.-Bericht 1-68. INTRODUCTION 11 The first part * consists of a reprint of Llanos’s papers, with his Spanish diagnoses reproduced and also translated into Latin. It is convenient to have these descriptions reprinted, as Lla- nos’s chief publication, his ‘“Fragmentos,” is a rare book. The introduction consists chiefiy of biographical notes relating to Llanos’s life and botanical work; see p. 25. The second paper, a botanical curiosity, is that of Mercado ® originally written in the last third of the seventeenth century. It deals with the medicinal properties of various Philippine plants and the discussions of various species include a curious mixture of fact, superstition, and fable in many cases.1° The scientific names added by Fernandez-Villar are not always cor- rect. From a botanical standpoint the work is of very slight importance, but it contains some data of economic value and is of interest from a historical standpoint. The introduction con- tains biographical notes regarding Mercado, an interesting dis- cussion of the early botanical writings of various representatives of the religious orders in the Philippines, and a history of Mer- cado’s manuscript. The original illustrations, in color, were not reproduced when the paper was published. The 473 plates, illustrating the third edition of the Flora de Filipinas, are usually in two unbound volumes, but in some copies they are scattered through the four volumes of text. They are unnumbered in the edition de luxe, and their proper numbers can be determined only by reference to the text of the Novissima Appendix or to the list of illustrations usually found at the end of the Novissima Appendix or sometimes placed in the first volume of plates. This list consists of six pages numbered by the Roman system. The identification of the plates is the work of Naves, but there are numerous manifest errors, both in relation to Blanco’s species they are supposed to represent and to binomials of other *Fragmentos de Algunas Plantas de Filipinas no incluidas en la flora de las islas de la primera ni segunda edicién dispuestas segun el sistema -Linneano por el P.

A large number of them refer to species that were unknown to Blanco or at least to those that were not described by him. A very high percentage of the species figured are common and well-known ones of wide geographic distribution and include many of the common weeds and the various cultivated species, including the commonly cultivated ornamentals, some of which were introduced into the Philippines after Blanco’s time. No attempt was made to select the endemic species in the prepara- tion of the plates nor to confine the illustrations to those species not previously figured by other authors; but about 80 of the total of 473 species figured or less than 17 per cent, represent endemic species. In general the illustrations are good, but a few are unrecognizable with certainty beyond the genus. In some cases the color selections are very faulty. The detail draw- ings are usually insufficient, and many are poorly executed. In order to make the present work more completely a key to the Flora de Filipinas, I give below a list of the plates of the third edition that do not pertain to species actually de- scribed by Blanco; those illustrating forms described by Blanco or by Llanos are listed in the following critical discussion of their species. For convenience the sequence follows the system- atic list after the Bentham and Hooker arrangement as published by Fernandez-Villar.

THE NOVISSIMA APPENDIX The third and last article in the fourth volume of the third : edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas is the Novissima Ap- INTRODUCTION 15 pendix ** and it is wholly the work of Father Celestino Fer- nandez-Villar and Father Andrés Naves, but mostly the actual work of the former. Fernandez-Villar is the author of the treat- ment of the dicotyledonous and gymnospermous orders, pages 1 to 212, and of the monocotyledonous orders and vascular cryptogams, from Fimbristylis bispicata on page 307 to the end of the work. Naves is the author of the monocotyledonous orders from page 213 to Fimbristylis nutans on page 307. The date appearing on the title page is 1880, and the introduc- tion is dated December 12, 1880. The printer’s date for the last part, indicated on page 375, is June 15, 1883. From an examination of an unbound copy in which the original fascicle covers were preserved I find that pages 1 to 272 were issued in 1880; pages 273 to 336 were issued in 1882; and pages 337 to 375 were issued in 1883.* As indicated in the introduction to the third edition of the Flora de Filipinas,'* it was the intention of the authors that the fourth part of the third edition should form a new Flora de Filipinas, to include all the species described by Mercado, Blanco, and Llanos; all of those described from Philippine material by other authors; and the various undescribed species, arranged in their natural orders. The inference implied by the prospectus, issued in 1877, is that descriptions would be added, but this is not definitely stated. However, owing to various cir- cumstances the authors were obliged to abandon their original plan in part, as indicated in the introduction to the Novissima Appendix** The reasons given were the enervating effect of the climate, the impatience of the majority of the subscribers for the termination of the work, the lack of special training on the part of the authors, the lack of an herbarium, and the lack of botanical publications. Further they had no means of consulting the Philippine botanical material preserved in various European and American herbaria and had not seen a single Specimen of the large Cuming collection, on which up to that date most of the actual knowledge of the Philippine flora on * Naves, A. and Fernandez-Villar, C.

They state also that on account of local climatic conditions, ravages of insects, etc., nobody had succeeded in preserving herbarium material, that is in building up a general herbarium, and that consequently their studies had to be based largely on fresh specimens; that on their own part they preserved specimens only of plants that were secured with difficulty and that were necessary for their investigations. The Novissima Appendix then resolved itself into a merely systematic list with synonyms, with the descrip- tions of thirty-three species, these either proposed as new or redescriptions of species of other authors, chiefly of Blanco. Except in those cases where these new species were based on specimens in Vidal’s herbarium, no material representing them is extant. Such herbarium material as was preserved by Fer- nandez-Villar and Naves, apparently representing but a very small percentage of the species they admitted as Philippine, was destroyed with the burning of the Guadalupe convent near Manila, February 19, 1899.1* In the Novissima Appendix all but about ten or twelve of Blanco’s and Llanos’s species were accounted for to the full satis- faction of the authors, these being reduced without question and without discussion to species of other authors. In a high percentage of cases the reductions were made to species that were originally described from extra-Philippine material, and _ ‘ which do not occur in the Philippines. The generic reductions for the most part are correct, but in some cases they are wrong. — The material on which the Novissima Appendix was based was not preserved, or such specimens as were preserved are no longer extant. The enumeration is trustworthy only in so far as it was based on references in botanical literature that were in turn based on actual Philippine specimens. The Novissima Appendix is an excellent example of typo- graphical work, and allowing for inaccuracies in the treatment of species it is excellent from a bibliographical standpoint. Beyond this nothing can be said in favor of the work, as it is utterly untrustworthy in synonymy, as to the reduction of | 4 species proposed by Blanco and by Llanos, and gives an entirely _ erroneous impression of the status of the knowledge of the Philippine flora at the time in which it was written. A total of 4,479 species was admitted as Philippine, distributed into * Report U. S. War Dept. 1* (1899) 390. Merrill, E. D. Derenienks work in the Philippines. Philip. Bur. Agr. Bull. 4 (1908) 34. INTRODUCTION 17 1,223 genera and 155 families. Of these at least one family and 116 genera have no known representatives in the Archi- pelago; and about 1,948 species, or 44 per cent of the total, do not occur in the Philippines, or at least have not been dis- covered in the course of the extensive field operations that have been carried on since the year 1883. The net result of the publication of the Novissima Appendix has been the burdening of the Philippine botanical literature with the names of nearly 2,000 species that do not occur in the Archipelago and which for the most part can never be placed in the synonymy of actual Philippine species, as descriptions are lacking, and no herbarium specimens representing them are extant. I quote here two passages from a previous consideration of this work which covers the other points at issue:*’ The most striking example of this phase of Philippine botany—that is, the accrediting to the Archipelago of species that do not extend to the Philippines—is that presented by the “Novissima Appendix” to the third edition of Blanco’s “Flora de Filipinas,” for which Fathers C. Fernandez- Villar and A. Naves are responsible. It we take into consideration the comparatively recent date at which this work was prepared (1877-83), it is difficult to explain the great mass of inaccurate data that was compiled by | these authors. The errors of Blanco, working between the years 1805 and 1845, and of Llanos, working between the years 1850 and 1873, sink into insignificance when compared with those of the authors of the third edition of Blanco’s work. In spite of the more recent date at which Fernandez- Villar and Naves worked, their errors are caused primarily by the same circumstances that influenced the work of Blanco and of Llanos. These causes were essentially a lack of knowledge of the Indo-Malayan flora; a lack of knowledge of the Philippine flora as a whole, due to insufficient botanical exploration; a lack of botanical material, both Philippine and extra-Philippine; a lack of botanical literature; and an inadequate concep- tion of the principles of the geographic distribution of plants. Apparently neither author corresponded with European botanists, and they certainly sent no botanical material to Europe for identification or for comparison with types preserved in various public and private herbaria. In most cases an admitted species is followed by the indication that the authors had seen living specimens, usually with an indication of the island, province, and town in which the plant was alleged to have been seen, and frequently with the citation of native names. Some admissions are based on actual herbarium specimens from the collections of Vidal, but where these have been checked on Vidal’s specimens, the identifications are usually found to be wrong. It seems to be apparent that the authors in compiling the “Novissima Appendix” took the standard books that were available to them, various monographs, Miquel’s “Florae Indiae Batavae,” Hooker’s “Flora of British India,” so far as published, and credited to the Philip- ” Merrill, E.

In | almost no case is a reduction of Blanco’s species queried, nor is a specific identification qualified by the addition of a question mark. In the Novissima Appendix numerous new combinations ap- pear, these frequently being erroneously credited to Bentham and Hooker f. The new names are often difficult to detect, and about forty of them have not been included in Index Kewensis or its supplements to date. A list of these has been given elsewhere.'® Naves in his treatment of the Orchidaceae ad- mitted numerous nomina nuda from Boxall’s manuscript list supplied to him by Vidal. There is no way of determining the status of these names, and accordingly the few nomina nuda overlooked by the compilers of Index Kewensis have been ignored by me. The species described by Fernandez-Villar are few in number and for the most part fall as synonyms. Below is given a com- plete list of those described by him as his own species, as those of Vidal, or of Naves. The list includes redescriptions of Blan- coan species, for which Fernandez-Villar usually proposed new specific names, and the few of other authors, such as Presl, Laguna, and Hance.

Fernandez- Villar’s specific name is the correct one for this endemic species. Talauma gigantifolia F.-Vill. Novis. App. (1880) 4, non Miq. From the brief description the form Fernandez-Villar erroneously re- ferred to Miquel’s species is Talawma angatensis (Blanco) F.-Vill. Monocarpia blancoi F.-Vill. Novis. App. (1880) 6. This is nominally a new name for Macanea arborea Blanco and the description applies to the form Blanco described under this name. Mono- carpia blancoi F.-Vill. is a synonym of Alphonsea arborea (Blanco) Merr.; see p. 146. i Pittosporum fernandezii Vidal ex F.-Vill. Novis. App. (1880) 13, Cat. Pl. Prov. Manila (1880) 17.

It is apparently a valid species of Kayea. Ternstroemia toquian (Blanco) F.-Vill. Novis. App. (1880) 19. This is a redescription of Llanosia toquian Blanco, the species being certainly correctly interpreted by Fernandez-Villar; see p. 264. Kosteletzkya batacensis (Blanco) F.-Vill. Novis. App. (1880) 24. This is a redescription of Hibiscus batacensis Blanco, Blanco’s species being correctly placed by Fernandez-Villar in the genus Kosteletzkya. Fer- nandez-Villar saw no specimens but interpreted the species wholly from Blanco’s description; see p. 255. Connaropsis philippica F.-Vill. Novis. App. (1880) 33. Fernandez-Villar apparently had specimens of Connaropsis (Sarcotheca), his material being from the Island of Panay. No type specimen is extant, and no representative of the genus has appeared in our Philippine collec- tions to date.

There is no means of determining which author has priority. The species is a most characteristic one, now represented in various herbaria by a number of collections from various parts of Luzon. CONTEMPORARY OPINIONS REGARDING BLANCO’S WORK AND THE EARLY ATTEMPTS TO ELUCIDATE HIS SPECIES In the Philippines the work of Blanco was popularly sup- posed to be of a very high order, and locally he was ranked among the most eminent botanists of the world. The value placed on his work by the Augustinian Order, of which he was a member, was so high that in 1877-83, over thirty years after Blanco’s death, a sumptuous and very expensive third edition of his Flora de Filipinas was issued, in six volumes, folio, of which four volumes are text and two volumes are plates. This edition is fully discussed elsewhere; see p. 9. — In Europe, however, Blanco’s work was considered more as a curiosity than as a valuable contribution to our knowledge of systematic botany, ‘and no botanist familiar with the work is justified in giving it high rank in comparison with similar con- temporary works on other countries. The first mention of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas of which I have any record is the rather extensive review by George Toes Lay,’® who abstracts data regarding about fifteen _* Chinese Repository 7 (1888) 422-487. 22 SPECIES BLANCOANAE species and gives some additional information based on his own observations. The next review that appeared is by Lindley,?? who gives a brief summary of the contents of the first edition, estimating the number of species described at about eleven hundred, and enumerating the new genera proposed. Regarding the work in general Lindley states: ‘“‘A great proportion [of the species] are referred to Linnean plants, it is needless to say with but little probability of their belonging to them,” and closes his review with this statement: “For the opportunity of examining this curious work I am indebted to the Hon. W. F. Strangways, by whom it has been presented to the library of the Horticul- tural Society.” In 1842 Walpers”: published a comprehensive review of the first edition of the Flora de Filipinas, translating into Latin the descriptions of the new species proposed by Blanco. The consideration includes the first 447 species described, up to and including Vatica mangachapoi, page 401. About 180 de- — scriptions were translated into Latin. No new names appear in this work other than Bauhinia pinnata Walp. for what should be Bauhinia binata Blanco. The species, with this exception, appear under the names assigned to them by Blanco. The article closes with the statement “continuabitur,” but no more was printed as the “‘Litteratur-Bericht” was discontinued with volume 16 of Linnaea. Doctor J. K. Hasskarl *? in connection with his work of eluci- dating or interpreting the work of the pre-Linnaean authors Rumphius and Rheede, commenced the publication of a critical consideration of Blanco’s species, but the work does not extend beyond a discussion of the first thirty-three species of the first edition, pages 1 to 24, as far as Tetrandria, Monogynia. In attempting to elucidate the first thirty-three species described 2 by Blanco, Hasskarl proposed eleven new binomials, which, with one exception, fall as synonyms; so that it is perhaps fortunate that the work commenced by him was never completed, or at least never published. Hasskarl attempted to interpret Blanco’s species from the descriptions, had little knowledge of the Phil- _ ippine flora, and naturally made numerous errors in his deduc- tions and conclusions. * Bot.

Hooker ** characterizes Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas as follows: The ‘Flora de Filipinas’ of Father Blanco, published at Manila in 1837, ‘is a botanical curiosity, written in Spanish. The descriptions are inte!- ligible, but, from the author’s want of acquaintance with scientific works, so many well known plants are treated as new, that we consider it unde- sirable to devote time to their identification. Alphonse de Candolle,?> speaks of Blanco’s work as follows: Il est 4 regretter que ces révérends ecclésiastiques [Blanco and Loureiro] et méme le Pére Plumier, leur prédécesseur ne se soint pas contentés d’écrire des homélies. Bonnes on les aurait lues, mauvaises on les aurait mises de eété; tandis qu’ en histoire naturelle l’existence de certains noms et de certaines planches rend nécessaire de consulter indéfiniment les plus mau- vais ouvrages. While we must agree with these authorities regarding the value of Blanco’s work, yet it must be thoroughly understood ‘that Blanco made no claim to being a botanist. He definitely states ** that he had neither instructors nor herbaria, nor scarcely any books. On commencing his investigations his only botan- ical work was the Systema Vegetabilium of Linnaeus (the edi- tion not indicated), but later he secured other works of the same author, Jussieu’s Genera Plantarum, and other books. Regard- ing his work I translate Blanco’s own statement: _ It was never my intention to frame a treatise on plants that would be worthy of publication. Mere curiosity impelled me to write what I con- * This new combination, based on Mogoriuwm aculeatum Blanco, is credited by Hasskarl to Walpers in Linnaea 16 (1842) Litt.-Bericht, where it does not occur, the species being considered by Walpers as Mogorium aculeatum Blanco.

(1837) Prologo III. 24 SPECIES BLANCOANAE sidered interesting, but some persons who heard of my work urged me to publish it. This I have done after correcting many errors which were due to haste and want of attention when it was written. I have enlarged it as much as the circumstances in which I was placed permitted me, and, although still containing mistakes and being far from perfect, it will at least serve to give a limited knowledge of the great botanical wealth of this fertile and pleasant country, and at the same time stimulate others to proceed with the work. Considering the circumstances under which it was written, Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas even if it is a curious work is also a remarkable book in some respects. Few botanists in any country or in any time have labored under greater disadvan- tages, and Blanco must be credited with initiative, industry, and perseverance. Most of the facts recorded are the result of his own observation, and even if he did make numerous grave errors in interpretation of species, his descriptions, as such, on the whole compare favorably with those of his con- temporaries. In fact his descriptions in general, on account of their length, are distinctly superior to the very brief diag- noses appearing in the older botanical literature as a means of interpreting the species intended. The fact should not be overlooked that species proposed by the early European authors, frequently very imperfectly characterized, are more often inter- preted by an examination of the actual type specimens preserved in various public and private herbaria, than by the descriptions themselves; in fact a very high percentage of all species de- scribed are more or less unintelligible without access to the actual specimens, or duplicates of them, on which they were — : based. Unfortunately Blanco preserved no herbarium material, and accordingly his species must be interpreted solely by the published data. THE WORK OF LOCAL INVESTIGATORS ON BLANCO’S FLORA DE FILIPINAS In addition to Walpers’s attempt to make Blanco’s descriptions of new species more generally available by translating them into Latin, and Hasskarl’s abortive attempt to interpret the species described, the interpretation of Blanco’s species has been the subject of special work by Llanos, Fernandez-Villar and Naves, and myself. In addition to these special works, none of them satisfactory, species described by Blanco in various families have been generally considered, often with little suc- cess, by authors of various monographs of families, tribes, and genera in the past eighty years. : ing INTRODUCTION 25 LLANOS Llanos, who was Blanco’s immediate successor and who had supplied data to Blanco in the preparation of the second edition of the Flora de Filipinas, published a series of papers between the years 1851 and 1873,\" which are of relatively slight impor- tance and, so far as interpretations of Blanco’s species are concerned, are notoriously inaccurate. Llanos’s papers are reprinted by F.-Villar and Naves in the third edition of Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas,** the miscellaneous descriptions being in- cluded in the reprint of Llanos’s “Fragmentos,” with translations into Latin of all descriptions originally published by Llanos in Spanish. The second and third papers given in the footnote, are reprinted by F.-Villar and Naves under the title: “Appendix sive tentamen aliud novi supplementi ad Floram Insularum Philippinarum secundae editionis cum revisione aliquorum gen- erum quae in ea continentur.”’ ”° The “Fragmentos” consists chiefly of the descriptions of new species or of species of older authors credited to the Philippines by Llanos. Nearly all of the new species proposed fall as synonyms, while most of the interpretations of the species of older authors have been shown to be erroneous.

Llanos, however, realized the importance of preserving botanical material, which his predecessor, Blanco, and his immediate successors, Fernan- dez-Villar and Naves, failed to appreciate. He prepared and sent botanical specimens representing at least some of his species to the de Candolle Herbarium at Geneva, Switzerland, and to the Museum d’Histoire Naturelle at Paris, France, where they are still preserved. In his method of work he also showed superiority over his colleagues in the Philippines in that he cor- — responded with various European botanists. FERNANDEZ-VILLAR AND NAVES The work of Fernandez-Villar and Naves in interpreting Blanco’s species is fully treated under the Novissima Appendix, page 14. MERRILL In organizing the botanical work for the Philippine Govern- — i ment in 1902 it soon became apparent that a special effort must be made to locate and to determine the status of as many of Blanco’s species as possible. Preliminary work on the subject © : at once showed that the reductions proposed by Fernandez- Villar and Naves were very inaccurate. Accordingly, utilizing the work of Fernandez-Villar and Naves as a basis, work was commenced in 1903 in compiling data regarding Blanco’s species, and this work was completed the following year and published in April, 1905.*° Fernandez-Villar and Naves placed to their entire satisfaction all but about ten or twelve of the species described by Blanco, but an elementary knowledge of the Philippine flora showed — at once that a high percentage of their reductions was wrong, as in numerous cases Blanco’s species were reduced to those of other authors that were not known to occur in the Archi- — pelago. My work was compiled when my knowledge of the Phil- ippine Flora was exceedingly limited, when the local herbarium, the preparation of which was commenced in 1902, contained but a few thousand specimens, and when the library facilities available in Manila were very inadequate. . The species were arranged in the Bentham and Hooker se- quence of families, under each Blancoan species being given ‘the references to the first and second editions, the native names ” Merrill, E. D.

INTRODUCTION 27 cited by Blanco, and the reduction so far as such reduction could be determined. When necessary additional data were given, such as the locality in which Blanco observed the species, the time of flowering, and other brief notes. The species of uncertain status were indicated by an asterisk, these totaling two hundred and thirty-six. Too much dependence was placed on the generic identifications of Fernandez-Villar and Naves, which for lack of special knowl- edge of the problem I was obliged to accept, in whole or in part, in 1904. With a more intensive knowledge of the Philippine flora and a critical study of Blanco’s descriptions it has become clear that they were totally wrong in their reductions in numerous cases. Appended to the systematic enumeration was an index to Latin names used by Blanco in the first and second editions of the Flora de Filipinas, giving page references to my own work, to the first, second, and third editions of the Flora de Filipinas, and to the Novissima Appendix of Fernandez-Villar and Naves. A supplementary index to native names was also included for convenience in field work. The object of this work, which succeeding events justified, was thus stated: The present paper has been prepared in order to summarize in convenient form our present knowledge of the species of plants described by Blanco and to call especial attention to such as are at present unknown, in order that collectors in the future may have some guide in collecting material which may serve to clear up the identity of some of his unknown species *. .* *. For the. best interests of Philippine botany it is very essential that every effort be made to properly identify the large number of unknown species proposed by Blanco, as with so many in our flora a stable nomen- clature cannot be established until the majority are properly identified. From time to time various Blancoan species were discussed by me in miscellaneous papers on the Philippine flora, and one supplementary special paper was issued on the subject.** In this paper critical notes are given on forty-eight of Blanco’s species that were for the most part not definitely placed in my first paper on Blanco’s species. FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN INTERPRETING BLANCOAN SPECIES In the first and second editions of his Flora de Filipinas Blanco described a total of 1,136 plants under binomial or tri- nomial names; the trinomials for the most part occur under \"Merrill, E. D. Additional identifications of the species described in Blanco’s Flora de Filipinas Philip. Journ. Sci. 2 (1907) Bot. 429-436. 28 SPECIES BLANCOANAE i Oryza, all here proposed being properly reducible to Oryza sativa Linn., and under Musa, these being mostly cultural forms of Musa sapientum Linn. or M. paradisiaca Linn. Owing to changes in nomenclature in the second edition, the total number of names proposed by Blanco for his 1,136 species and varieties is about 1,386. A critical study of Blanco’s species has shown that he fre- quently described the same species twice, or sometimes three or even four times under different specific names, either in the i same or in different genera. In about 148 cases reductions have been made in this connection, so that the total number of dif- ferent species actually described by Blanco is but about 993 assuming that the fifty species, still of doubtful status, are really distinct from the forms otherwise described by Blanco. Fernandez-Villar and Naves reduced all but about ten or twelve of Blanco’s species, while in my previous consideration of the work, I indicated two hundred and thirty-six as of doubt- ful status. This number has now been reduced to about fifty, which for one reason or another I have been unable to interpret. In many cases these remaining doubtful species are those very briefly and imperfectly described, and there is little reason to believe that such species can be located. In other cases it is entirely probable that data and material may eventually be secured by which some of the species can be located and their ~ status determined. Blanco published about 686 new binomials and trinomials, of which approximately 195 supply the valid specific names for the various species under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Wherever Blanco’s names can be shown to be valid, they have been accepted by me, the ——_ being reduced in the following critical enumeration. © _ Six hundred and ninety binomials originally proposed by other authors were assigned by Blanco to Philippine species described by him, on the assumption in each case that the Philipine plant really represented the species originally described under the same binomial. Blanco’s percentage of error in interpreting species of other authors is remarkably high, which, however, was only the natural result of his methods of work. Over four hundred of these binomials, or about 60 per cent, were misapplied. I have invariably assumed that these misinterpreted binomials | are invalid, which is the only logical method of treating them. Hallier f.,°* however, takes a different view of this matter, as) ROE ST * Beihefte Bot. Centralbl. 34? (1916) 42. INTRODUCTION 29 indicated by his proposition to adopt Exacum albens Blanco (1837) non Linnaeus (1753) as the valid name for the Malayan plant commonly but erroneously referred to Exacum tetragonum Roxb. Eaacum albens Linn. is the name-bringing synonym of Sebaea albens R. Br., and as a synonym Hallier, like many other botanists, does not recognize that it invalidates the use of the same specific name for another species of Hxacum. If this prin- ciple be applied to all of Blanco’s misinterpreted binomials, his specific names would have to be adopted in numerous cases. I hold that the publication of a binomial, whether such binomial be valid or a synonym, invalidates the future use of the same specific name for any other species under the same generic name; any other method of treating such names merely adds to the chaotic condition of binomial nomenclature. In determining the status of Blanco’s species many factors must be taken into consideration. The supplementary data given by Blanco for his various species are not infrequently of greater importance in determining his species than are the descriptions themselves. Utilizing our vast amount of accumulated data on the Philippine flora and our fairly intensive knowledge of the flora of those regions chiefly explored by Blanco, and comparing our material and data with Blanco’s descriptions, it has been pos- sible to determine with a definite degree of certainty the identity of a high percentage of his species. This even applies in those cases where his descriptions are faulty or erroneous; short and very imperfect; and where they are based on material orig- inating from two different species or even from representatives of different genera or families. Much of the data necessary to a clear understanding of many of the species could, of necessity, be secured only by field work with special reference to the problem. Previous attempts to determine just what Blanco intended by many of his species have in many cases proved abortive. European botanists working only with dried specimens; with no knowledge of the Philippine flora from actual field work; with few or no notes accompanying their dried specimens; with no knowledge of the local names and uses of plants, their occur- rence, relative abundance, time of flowering or fruiting, and other factors, have naturally been unable in many cases prop- erly to interpret Blancoan species, and authors of various mono- graphs have accordingly been obliged to compile descriptions from the data given by Blanco and to treat numerous species as unknown or imperfectly known. Local botanists up to the ene of the ania century 30 SPECIES BLANCOANAE were handicapped by a lack of knowledge of the Philippine flora, due to insufficient exploration; by the consequent lack of her- baria; and by the lack of literature. Above all they were limited . by their lack of knowledge of the Indo-Malayan flora. The 4 work of Llanos, Fernandez-Villar, and Naves in interpreting . Blancoan species is noteworthily faulty, inexact, and not to be trusted. Their knowledge of the Indo-Malayan flora was gained entirely from a study of the scanty literature that was q available to them; they had no true conception of the principles ’ of geographic distribution of plants; and they failed to realize the very high percentage of endemism that characterizes the Philippine flora. While they may have had a fairly good knowl- edge of Blanco’s species as such, their reductions of them to a Indo-Malayan species that do not extend to the Philippines are 2 notoriously erroneous in a high percentage of cases. 4 While Blanco called his work a Flora of the Philippines, it is manifest that he did not intend it as a complete flora. It contains descriptions of not more than one-tenth of the species that actually occur in the Archipelago. He definitely states that he included what he considered to be of value or interest, and not infrequently discusses this or that species as being worthy of a place in his work. As noted elsewhere no exhaustive field work was undertaken, the vast areas of virgin forests were scarcely explored, and no attention was given to the rich and characteristic vegetation of the higher mountains. Large and critical families such as the Orchidaceae, Gramineae, and Cyper- aceae, and the Pteridophyta were largely ignored, only a few of the more conspicuous or common species of each group or those of economic importance being described. Thus among the few grasses described we find rice, Italian millet, maize, sugar cane, sorghum, a few bamboos, and a few of the more common and conspicuous or curious non-cultivated grasses. The same is generally true of all the larger families of plants. Cultivated — plants, ornamentals, and native species of economic importance © were given prominence. i Blanco, having no conception of the principles of geographic © distribution of plants, was influenced in his selection of generic and specific names by the limited literature at his command. He > made no attempt in the first edition of his flora to account for. species actually described from Philippine material by other — authors, but did attempt to interpret a few such species in the second edition. Many indigenous and endemic species he iden- tified with species of other authors, based on American material, yet on the other hand described as new various species of Amer- INTRODUCTION ‘Cae ican origin that had been introduced and were cultivated or naturalized in the Philippines. Many of the forms he described as new were based on material originating in the settled areas at low altitudes, species for the most part common and of wide geographic distribution, with the result that a high percentage of his new species must be reduced as synonyms of species previously described by other authors, as in general but about 12 per cent of the species found in the settled areas at low and medium altitudes in the Philippines are endemic. It is a well-known fact that Blanco did not permanently pre- serve botanical material,** although it seems probable that he did preserve temporarily some specimens, which in the course of time were destroyed, as their value was not realized. Most of his descriptions were based on fresh material collected by himself or brought to him by other persons; but some descrip- tions were based on dried specimens received from his various colleagues, notably from Azaola, and later from Llanos. From Blanco’s own statement * it is evident that he did not accomplish any great amount of field work, at least in the sense of botanical exploration as such. Further his botanical work was intermittent and extended over a period of many years. He definitely states ** that on account of the great difficulty in securing material and data he at times became so discouraged that sometimes entire years passed in which he added nothing to his notes. It is then natur- ally to be expected, that descriptions written at long intervals would scarcely be comparative, even within the same genus, especially in view of the fact that many of them were written as he had opportunity to examine plants in the course of his travels and when he naturally did not have access to his own notes. The fact that he preserved no material for purposes of future study and comparison explains many discrepancies in his descriptions, and the reason why he often described the Same species twice under different names in the same or in different genera. “ Botanical material preserved in the herbarium of the Jardin Botanico, Madrid, credited to Blanco by Colmeiro [Bosquejo Hist. Jard. Bot. Madrid 88], and by A. de Candolle [La Phytographie (1880) 395] has been shown by Vidal [Rev. Pl. Vasc. Filip. (1886) 14] not to have been collected or transmitted by Blanco. i “Fl. Filip. (1837) 728, sub. Quercus cerris, translation: For those who love the study of nature it is truly lamentable that neither prayers, supplica- tions, nor money will bring to the light of knowledge the precious things of the Philippine forests. “Fl. Filip. ed. 2 (1845) Prologo III. 32 SPECIES BLANCOANAE From his method of work errors were unavoidable. These errors consisted of faulty original observations which could not be later corrected by consultation of specimens on which the original descriptions were based; of descriptions, in some cases, of individual species based on material originating from entirely different plants, sometimes belonging in distinct families; of describing the same species twice under different genera, once from flowering specimens and once from fruiting specimens; and, from placing too much dependence on the Linnean system of classification, by describing the same species twice under different genera, in different classes, from flowering specimens. Thus Paliurus lamio Blanco is based on leaves and flowers of some species of Canarium of the Burseraceae, and a fruiting speci- men of Dracontomelum of the Anacardiaceae; Trichilia volubilis Blanco, a species of wholly doubtful status, is apparently based on leaf specimens of some species of Derris of the Leguminosae, perhaps on the fruits of some meliaceous plant, and as to the properties and native names ascribed to it, Albizzia saponaria Benth. ; Cedrela taratara Blanco is apparently based on the wood of Pterocarpus of the Leguminosae, and perhaps the leaves of some species of Dysoxylum or Aglaia of the Meliaceae; Illigera luzonensis (Presl) Merr. is described from flowering specimens as Gronovia ternata Blanco, and from fruiting specimens as Halesia ternata Blanco; Alchornea sicca (Blanco) Merr. is described both as Hxcaecaria sicca Blanco and as Croton drupaceum Blan- co; Sphenoclea zeylanica Gaertn. is described both as Pongatiuwm spongiosum Blanco and as Reichelia palustris Blanco; Plectronia glandulosa (Blanco) Merr. is described as Ixora glandulosa — Blanco and again as Polyozus bipinnatus Blanco. There are numerous other similar cases. In some cases species were named and described from the statements of others; that is, on hearsay evidence. Notable _ examples of this are Mangifera anisodora Blanco, which is mani-— festly nothing but a form of the common Mangifera indica Linn. and Musa paradisiaca var. ulnaris Blanco. In the case of this — banana Blanco states that it was known only to the Negritos of © Bataan, and that the fruits were a braza in length, that is about — two meters, that they were as thick as the calf of one’s leg, « and that the raceme was reduced to a solitary fruit. In all probability this relation was based primarily on the banana ~ locally known as tundoc, the largest one in the Philippines, the : fruits of which are about 30 centimeters in length. While Blanco correctly treated many of the genera proposed INTRODUCTION 33 by previous authors, numerous others were misinterpreted. In many cases his conception of the genus was very vague, and he often assigned to a generic name species that manifestly belong in entirely different genera or in entirely distinct families. Thus Paederia includes representatives of both Paederia and Psychotria; Ixora contains species of Ixora, Scyphiphora, and Plectronia; Sterculia contains species of Sterculia, Knema, and perhaps Myristica; Nauclea contains representatives of the closely allied Nauclea (Sarcocephalus) and Neonauclea, and also of the entirely distinct araliaceous genus Schefflera (§ Cepha- loscheera) ; Mimosa includes species of Acacia, Pithecolobium, Schrankia, Mimosa, Albizzia, Pterolobium, Adenanthera, and Parkia. This list could be greatly extended, but enough is given to indicate some of the difficulties encountered in dealing with Blanco’s genera. In various descriptions Blanco has misconstrued certain char- acters. Thus the distichous leaves on the branchlets of certain rubiaceous and myrtaceous plants are frequently described as pinnate or even as bipinnate leaves. On the contrary he some- times described leaflets of pinnate leaves as simple leaves. Thus it frequently happens that one must construe Blanco’s descrip- tions rather than to take his use of technical terms as always strictly correct. In a few cases galls have been described as fruits, a notable case being that of the echinate galls of Shorea guiso Blume; from such material Blanco described the species as Euphoria malaanonan Blanco, which is considered in the second edition as “Euphoria ? nephelium?” He realized from his specific name malaanonan that he was dealing with a dip- terocarpous tree; yet on account of its Nephelium-like “fruits” (really galls), he later placed it in the genus Euphoria of the Sapindaceae. In numerous cases Blanco gives the exact locality in which he observed the species described. His material was for the most part from Luzon, and chiefly from the provinces near Manila. The regions from which most of his material was se- cured are what is now Rizal Province, especially from the vicinity of Manila, Bulacan, Pampanga, Union, Ilocos Sur, and Ilocos Norte, and a few from other provinces such as Cavite, Bataan, Cagayan, Camarines, Tayabas, etc. Few species were from other islands than Luzon, such as Mindoro, Marinduque, Cebu, Negros, and Bohol, but none were from as far south as Mindanao. Most of his material was from the easily accessible regions at low altitudes, from the settled areas in the immediate vicinity 1518628 34 SPECIES BLANCOANAE of towns, second-growth forests and thickets, but little from the virgin forests, and none from the higher mountains. Even from medium altitudes but few species were described, the no- table ones being but four, Pinus taeda Blanco (=P. insularis Endl), Llanosia toquian Blanco (=Ternstroemia toquian F. Vill.), Blechnum colobrinum Blanco (=-Oleandra -neriiformis Cav), and Nepenthes alata Blanco. Naturally in searching for material to elucidate or represent Blanco’s species the actual field work must in large part be confined to low altitudes and to those regions from which Blanco received his material. : ‘As Blanco frequently mentioned the exact locality in which he observed many of his species, this factor has been of especial importance in the identification of them. It has thus been pos- sible to locate many of his species by field work in special local- ities. To illustrate this matter a few special cases will suffice: Borago indica Linn. = Trichodesma indicum R. Br. was cor- rectly interpreted by Blanco in the second edition of his Flora de Filipinas. Blanco states that he observed it in peanut plan- tations in the town of Parafiaque south of Manila. This annual weed has persisted in this locality, can now be found in practically every peanut plantation in Parafiaque, but has scarcely been detected elsewhere in the Philippines. Mimosa quadrivalvis Linn.=Schrankia quadrivalvis (Linn.) Merr. was correctly inter- preted by Blanco in the first edition of the Flora de Filipinas ; Blanco’s description applies unmistakably to this species, which was introduced from Mexico apparently at an early date. Up to the year 1907, no collector had found this species in the Phil- ippines, and I had about concluded that it had become extinct in the Archipelago when a single fragmentary specimen was received from Mindanao. Blanco’s specimens were from Mainit, Bauang, Batangas Province, Luzon, and exploration of this locality in 1915 showed that the species is now very abundant in the place where Blanco observed it some time before the year 1837. Thus Cynanchum viminale Blanco = Sarcostemma bruno- nianum W. & A. is still very abundant at Punta de Azufre, Batangas Province, Luzon, where Blanco observed it, but is known from but few other localities in the Philippines; and ( Adelia papillaris Blanco = Mallotus papillaris Merr., very in- adequately described by Blanco, can still be found in thickets in the neighborhood of Guadalupe, the type locality of the species. In other cases special species cannot now be found within © many miles of the localities mentioned by Blanco in his descrip- tions. In the more densely populated parts of the Philippines INTRODUCTION 35 the vegetation has suffered enormously in the past century. In Blanco’s time it is evident from his own statements that virgin forests existed in the immediate vicinity of the town of Angat, Bulacan Province, Luzon ; to-day one must travel for many hours from Angat before he can find any vestiges of the virgin forest. The original vegetation has been destroyed by the primitive prev- alent caingin system of agriculture; that is by felling: and burning the trees on a selected area, abandoning this area after one or two seasons, and clearing another one. The virgin forest thus destroyed is replaced by thickets and second-growth forests in aspect and in constituent species totally different from the original vegetation; by dense bamboo thickets; or by open grasslands characterized especially by the dominance of the cogon, or lalang grass (Imperata). It must be fully realized, in attempting to interpret: Blan- co’s species, that the Philippine flora is a very complex one: While very many of Blanco’s species are naturally of wide geo- graphic distribution, others are very local. It is not sufficient to base an interpretation of many of Blanco’s species on a specimen labelled “Philippines” as a high percentage of our species are strictly local, and very many are known from but a single locality. Whenever possible a Blancoan species should be interpreted by specimens originating as near as possible to the exact place indicated by Blanco, that is, by topotypes. In very many cases the native names cited by Blanco and by Llanos have furnished the first clue to the identity of their spe- cies. This is especially true in those cases where the descriptions are very incomplete, and where, due to misinterpretations of genera, species were wrongly placed. From the description of Rhamnus lando Lianos, for example, while it is evident that it applies to no rhamnaceous plant, no botanist would ever suspect that a species of Embelia of the Myrsinaceae was intended, and I believe that it would have been impossible for any botanist properly to interpret the species except for the clue supplied by the Tagalog name lando cited by Llanos; material received under this name agrees perfectly with Llanos’s description. Cases like this are very numerous, and it has thus been possible to secure data and material of the very greatest value in con: nection with this investigation by prosecuting field work in special localities with special reference to the native names of plants. Native names are naturally not always used correctly by Blanco, and in some cases we have never been able to find certain names cited bee him in use; these may now be obsolete. 36 SPECIES BLANCOANAE It is apparent that not all of the names recorded by Blanco were based on his own researches, but were copied from other authors, notably from the work of Clain.* THE EXSICCATA “SPECIES BLANCOANAE” In 1912 it occurred to me that, as Blanco preserved no botan- ical material, the preparation of an exsiccata to consist of speci- . mens that should represent the various species described by him, as these were understood by me after long experience in the field and a critical study of each individual description, would be very desirable. It was realized that the distribution of such an exsiccata to the larger botanical institutions would do much to fix the status of Blanco’s species, provided the work of selec- tion was critically done. By reference to the actual specimens other botanists would be able to check my conclusions and deter- mine individually the status and relationships of the various species, and the correctness or error in my conclusions in those cases where there is a reasonable cause for difference in opinion either in my interpretations of Blanco’s species or those of other _ authors where reductions have been made. In other words a critically prepared exsiccata would supply a fairly dependable series of specimens that to a large degree would take the place of Blanco’s “types” which were never preserved. In accordance with thisidea it was decided to prepare an exsiccata of sixteen sets, to be distributed to a selected list of botanical institutions in various countries, so that the specimens would become generally available to botanists concerned with the problems associated with the Indo-Malayan and Philippine floras, and with the preparation of monographs or revisions of various natural groups of plants. For this exsiccata the title “Species Blancoanae” was selected. In assembling material for this exsiccata, which contains more than 16,900 specimens, the original idea was to include only those species described by Blanco as new, and those interpreted | by Blanco under binomials of other authors where the actual plant described by Blanco did not pertain to the binomial under. which it was placed. As the work progressed it became evident that the plan must be modified as it was discovered that in some cases Blanco’s descriptions of species of older authors, where the species had been correctly interpreted by him, had been made the basis of new binomials. The plan was then changed *Clain, P. Remedios faciles para diferentes enfermedades (1712). 1-298. I have not seen the original edition of this work, but a second edition was — published in Manila in 1857, pp. XXXI + 1-638, index. INTRODUCTION 37 to include in the easiccata all species described by Blanco of which it was possible to secure specimens, whether proposed by him as new or whether correctly or incorrectly interpreted spe- cies of other authors. Still later it became apparent that the work of Llanos on the Philippine flora was logically to be treated in the same manner as that of Blanco. Llanos was a colleague of Blanco during the latter years of this author’s life, and was his immediate suc- cessor in matters pertaining to the Philippine flora. As, com- paratively speaking, Llanos’s work is of slight importance and scarcely worthy of separate consideration; as his species are even more obscure than are those of Blanco; and as his work is in the nature of a continuation of Blanco’s labors, it was later decided further to modify the original plan by including a critical consideration of Llanos’s species with those of Blanco. I have accordingly included in the exsiccata ‘Species Blancoanae” speci- mens representing Llanos’s species where their status could be determined with reasonable certainty, and where Petre rePy resenting them could be secured. The exsiccata “Species Blancoanae” includes 1,060 Bp dg the result of several years work on this problem. When the plan of securing this material was first adopted naturally mate- rial representing several hundred of the commoner and well- known species was quickly secured. After these were collected the work progressed very slowly, and toward the last resolved itself into special trips to specific localities, often at special seasons, to secure material representing individual species. Un- fortunately many of Blanco’s species were unknown, and the plan has further involved a critical study of all his descriptions of species of doubtful status, their identification, and then their collection. This has involved considerable special correspond- ence with various officials in many parts of the Philippines, special trips of exploration, and a careful survey of special localities mentioned by Blanco. It has not always been possible to secure the desired material, even when the exact status of a species was known. In some cases the species has not been found in flower or in fruit, and sterile material has of necessity been substituted. In other cases it has been very difficult to secure the desired material in suffi- cient quantity for a set of sixteen specimens. In the case of some rarely cultivated species, specimens have actually been grown from seeds or cuttings. Curiously some fairly well-known and widely distributed species have so far escaped collection in suf- ficient quantity for the exsiccata, although many have been re- 38 SPECIES BLANCOANAE ceived in current collections during the time the exsiccata has been in preparation, but without a sufficient number of dupli- cates. Naturally it has not been possible to secure material illustrating those species described by Blanco or by Llanos whose status is now entirely uncertain or unknown, but fortunately the list of doubtful species is now very greatly reduced. Most of the material utilized in the preparation of the exsic- cata “Species Blancoanae” has been collected by employees of the Bureau of Science, many sets by myself, some by Eugenio Fénix, but a much larger number by Maximo Ramos. I have had the cordial codperation of Doctor F. W. Foxworthy, of the Bureau of Forestry, and of other employees in that Bureau in securing specimens to represent special species. A few sets have kindly been supplied by Mr. C. A. Wenzel, of Jaro, Leyte; Mr. D. L. Topping and Mrs. Mary Strong Clemens, of Manila; by Doctor F. C. Gates, formerly of the College of Agriculture at Los Bafios, Laguna Province; by Mr. Rafael Lete, San Fernando, Union Province; and by Father M. Vanoverbergh, of the Belgian Mission, Mountain Province, Luzon. The assistance granted by these individuals, but for which the exsiccata must have been much more incomplete than it is, is gratefully acknowledged. — SYSTEMATIC ENUMERATION AND DISCUSSION OF THE VARIOUS SPECIES THALLOPHYTA ALGAE CHLOROPHYCEAE ULVACEAE ENTEROMORPHA Harvey Ulva intestinalis Linn.; Blanco Fl.

Blanco probably included in his conception of the species Gracilaria confervoides Grev. FUNGI HYMENOMYCETACEAE MARASMIUS Fries Conferva setosa Blanco FI. Filip. (1837) 844 (sp. nov.); ed. 2 (1845) 583; ed. 3, 3 (1879) 264=MARASMIUS sp. -Blanco’s description applies unmistakably to the characteristic horse-hair blight, Marasmius. It was observed by him attached to the leaves of trees on Mount Arayat, Pampanga Province, Luzon, and he states that he at first thought the specimens were horse hairs. PYRENOMYCETEAE XYLARIA Hill Sclerotium subterraneum Blanco FI. Filip. (1837) 845 (sp. nov.); ed. 2 (1845) 584; ed. 3, 3 (1879) 266—=XYLARIA NIGRIPES (KI.) Sacc. Blanco’s description applies unmistakably to the branched conidial form of Xylaria that can be readily cultivated from the comb of white ant’s nests, and which is apparently the conidial form of Xylaria nigripes Sacc. Blanco’s material was secured from the nest of the anay, i. e., the white ant. PTERIDOPHYTA CYATHEACEAE CYATHEA Smith Trichopteris falcata Llanos Frag. Pl. Filip. (1851) 111 (sp. nov.); F.-Vill & Naves in Blanco Fl. Filip. ed. 3, 4* (1880) 91—=CYATHEA IN- TEGRA J. Sm. Llanos’s species does not appear in Christensen’s Index Fil- icum. The description is short and rather vague, but among all the tree ferns known from the Philippines applies best to Cyathea integra J. Sm., the type of which was from Luzon; Llanos’s specimens were from the town of Calauan, Laguna 4? SPECIES BLANCOANAE Province, Luzon. It was reduced by Fernandez-Villar to Also- phila crinita Hook., a species that does not occur in the Philip- pines. The species is of wide distribution in the Archipelago, growing in primeval forests at medium altitudes. a Illustrative specimen from Cagayan Province, Luzon, January, 1912 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. F203; POLYPODIACEAE DRYOPTERIS Adanson Pteris sinuata Blanco Fl. Filip. (1837) 830, non Thunb., nec Wall.=Poly- podium adiantiforme Blanco op. cit. ed. 2 (1845) 573 (adianthiforme) (sp. nov.); ed. 3, 3 (1879) 245—=DRYOPTERIS DISSECTA (Forst.) O. Ktze. Blanco’s species was reduced by Fernandez-Villar to N ephrole- pts davallioides Kunze, a species that does not extend to the Phil- ippines and one to which Blanco’s description does not at all apply. The description is so very short and imperfect that it is practically impossible properly to interpret the species except by exclusion, and the present reduction is based primarily on that fern growing in the vicinity of Manila that best agrees with the description. Ss Illustrative specimen from Masambong, Rizal Province, Lu- zon, November, 1914 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 181). HEMIGRAMMA Christ Acrostichum simplex Blanco Fl. Filip. (1837) 826; ed. 2 (1845) 571; 3, 3 (1879) 241, non Sw.=HEMIGRAMMA LATIFOLIA (Meyen) Copel. in Philip. Journ. Sci. 2 (1907) Bot. 406. - Synonyms of this are: Hemionitis gymnopteroidea Copel., Polybotrya latifolia Meyen, Gymnopteris latifolia Presl, G. tac- caefolia J. Sm., G. trilobata J. Sm., G. subquinquifida Pres}, Dendroglossa latifolia Fée, D. taccaefolia Fée, Hemionitis zol- lingert Kurz, Leptochilus zollingeri Fée, L. subquinquifidus Fée, and Hemigramma zollingeri Christ. Meyen’s specific name is the oldest valid one, although Blanco’s description is much earlier. — Blanco’s Acrostichum simplex is not cited by Fernandez-Villar by — name, but from the page citations on page 342 of the Novissima Appendix it is evident that he intended to refer it to Acrostichum latifolium Sw.=Elaphoglossum latifolium J. Sm., a species con- fined to tropical America. Blanco’s description is very poor, and in respect to size does not apply to Hemigramma latifolia; “de la altura de una braza” * * * “estipites lampifios”, but otherwise there are few discrepancies. I do not know any Phil- ippine fern that agrees with Blanco’s description in all respects, — and consider it very probable that the description is based on POLY PODIACEAE 43 more than one species, or on detached fronds of Hemigramma. Hemigramma latifolia Copel. is widely distributed in the Phil- ippines at low and medium altitudes. - Tilustrative specimens from Antipolo, Rizal Province, Luzon, November, 1914 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 628); Mon- talban, Rizal Province, Luzon, February, 1916 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 984). OLEANDRA Cavanilles Blechnum colubrinum Blanco FI. Filip. (1837) 834 (sp. nov.) ; ed. 2 (1845) 576; ed. 3, 3 (1879) 252=0. NERIIFORMIS Cav. (Oleandra colubrina Copel.). I fail to see how this species can be distinguished from Olean- dra nertiformis Cav., the type of which was from “la insula de Mauban”, i. e., Mauban, Tayabas Province, Luzon. It is widely distributed in the Philippines occurring on most mountains above an altitude of 800 meters. Illustrative specimen from Mount Maquiling, Laguna Province, Luzon, March, 1914 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 490). NEPHROLEPIS Schott Pteris signata Blanco Fl. Filip. (1837) 830 (sp. nov.) =Polypodium signatum Blanco op. cit. ed. 2 (1845) 572 (comb. nov.) ; ed. 3, 3 (1879) 248—NEPHROLEPIS BISERRATA (Sw.) Schott. Polypodium serratum Blanco FI. Filip. (1837) 827; ed. 2 (1845) 572; ed. 3, 3 (1879) 243, non Willd. nec Aubl.=NEPHROLEPIS BISERRATA (Sw.) Schott. Blanco’s Pteris signata—Polypodium signatum is very im- perfectly described, and the species has been considered a very doubtful one. Fernandez-Villar reduced it to Polypodium albido- squamatum Blume, which is a species of the mossy forests, while Blanco definitely states that his specimens were from Manda- loyan, near Manila, a region where Polypodium albido-squamatum does not and cannot grow. Blanco’s description, so far as it goes, applies perfectly to Nephrolepis biserrata Schott which is abundant about Manila, many specimens of which present the | white dots on the upper surface mentioned by him. Blanco’s Polypodium serratum is certainly the same species, a form with- out the manifest white dots on the upper surface. Illustrative specimen from Mandaloyon, Rizal Province, Luzon, Oetaber, 1914 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 153). ATHYRIUM Roth Hemionitis incisa Blanco Fl. Filip.

Sm.). 44 SPECIES BLANCOANAE This species is common and widely distributed in the Philip- pines along streams and is universally known as paco; the tender shoots are much used as food. Illustrative specimen from Rizal Province, Luzon, December, 1912 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 592). ASPLENIUM Linnaeus Allantodia pinnata Blanco FI. Filip. ed. 2 (1845) 571 (sp. nov.); ed. 3, 3 (1879) 242—ASPLENIUM MACROPHYLLUM Sw. This species was reduced by Fernandez-Villar to Asplenium brackenridget Baker, which is a synonym of Diplazium (Athy- rum) bulbiferum Brack. Copeland in his revision of the Phil- ippine species of Athyrium, Philip. Journ. Sci. 3 (1907) Bot. 297, considering that F.-Villar was correct in this reduction of Allantodia pinnata, has adopted Blanco’s specific name, calling the species Athyrium pinnatum (Blanco) Copeland, and citing many synonyms. Fernandez-Villar was manifestly wrong in making this reduction for three reasons: first, Blanco’s de- scription does not apply to Diplaziwm bulbiferum Brack. ; second, Athyrium “pinnatum” of Copeland does not grow in or near Mandaloyon; and third, there is no valid reason for con- sidering that it ever did grow there. The species, as interpreted by Copeland, is one of the primeval forests and usually occurs at and above altitudes of 500 meters, although it has been found in Bataan Province at an altitude of about 75 meters; Manda- loyan, a suburb of Manila, is at sea level or nearly so, and Man- daloyan has certainly not supported any type of primeval forest within historical times. The only fern to be found on the entire Mandaloyan estate that at all agrees with Blanco’s description is Asplenium macrophyllum, and this fern is abundant in some parts of the estate, and moreover is a fern to which Blanco’s description certainly applies. Illustrative specimen from Mandaloyan, Rizal Province, Luzon, November, 1914 (Merrill: Species Blancoanae No. 7B). STENOCHLAENA J. Smith Diliman Blanco FI.

It is locally known as hagndaya, and in Manila as diliman. The tough climbing stems are brought to Manila in "
