        "text": "Bach Ma National Park (BMNP) is recognized as an essential biodiversity hotspot in Vietnam because of its diverse topography, high species richness and threatened and endemic species. This study updates the richness and distribution of vascular plant species in the BMNP by intergrading data from literature, field surveys, key-informant interviews and participatory observations. Our results showed that the park has a high diversity of vascular plants with 1,874 species belonging to 192 families, 6 phylums including Psilotophyta, Lycopodiophyta, Equisetophyta, Polypodiophyta, Pinophyta, and Magnoliophyta. It also indicates that 199 out of 1,874 vascular species in the BMNP are listed as endangered, precious and rare plant species of Vietnam. In particular, 55 species are part of the IUCN 2020 list, in which 9 are critically endangered species (CR), 15 are endangered species (EN), and 31 are vulnerable species (VU). According to the rankings of the Red List Vietnam (2007), 6 species of...\n\nThe survey which was conducted in the dry season (from February to April) in Cam Mountain, reported 49 plant species belonged to 45 genera and 29 families. These species include 10 big wood species (G) (20.4 %), 14 small wood species (g) (28.6 %), 7 bush species (17.2 %), 9 creeper species (18.4 %) and 9 herbaceous species (18.4 %). There are 33 species used for herbal medicines, 12 species for wood fire, 11 species for fruit, 10 species for household tools and 9 species for food. Pterocarpus macrocapus Kurz is the species that listed in Viet Nam Red Data Book (2007). The average value of Margalef (d) and Pielou (J’) indexes are 2.45 ± 0.37 and 0.94 ± 0.02, respectively. There are 54.5 % quadrates which (d) and (J’) indexes are higher than Margalef (d) and Pielou (J’) indexes. The Shannon – Weiner (H’) index of 63.6 % quadrats is higher than the average value of Shannon Weiner index (1.94 ± 0.19). The number of species at quadrats O1T1, O3T1 and O1T2 are more diverse than other quad...\n\nSix pteridophyte species of five families and 12 spermatophyte species of 10 families are reported from Bolaven Plateau, southern Laos, as new records to the flora of Laos. Moreover, two new species, Sterculia bolavenensis (Malvaceae) and Wikstroemia bolavenensis (Thymelaeaceae), are described. For each species, voucher specimens are cited, photographs are shown and additional information including geographical distribution, ecology and taxonomic notes are provided."
