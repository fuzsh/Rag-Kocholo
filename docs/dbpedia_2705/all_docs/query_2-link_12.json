Veldkamp Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity — Naturalis, Section National Herbarium of The Netherlands, Leiden University, P.O. Box 9514, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands veldkamp@nhn.leidenuniy.nl ABSTRACT. Georg Eberhard Rumpf, better known as Rumphius (1627-1702) was a Homo universalis and is the undisputed patriarch of Malesian botany, zoology, geology (including fossils!), colonial history; pharmaceutical, architectural, juridical (local and Western), ethnological, linguistic, historical, and religious matters, including astrology and magic. To botanists he is best known for his Herbarium amboinense (1741—1750), the first account and sometimes the only one of Malesian plants. This is a 7-volume folio work with extensive descriptions and discussions in Latin and Dutch of about 1200 species with 811 full-page illustrations. A brief account of his life and works is given. Keywords. Ambon, Dutch United East Indian Company, Herbarium amboinense, Malesia, natural science, Rumpf, Rumphius, VOC Introduction Many articles and books have been written about Georg Eberhard Rumpf (Georgius Everhardus Rumphius in Latin), better known as Rumphius (1627—1702) and his observations in the Moluccas (Fig. 1, 2), which have given him an everlasting place of honour in the history of natural science (see Appendix A for a selection). Only a few of these publications were in English, the last one by Beekman (1999), who translated d’Amboinschen Rariteitkamer (1705), the Amboinese Curiosity Cabinet. This deals mainly with animals, mineralogy, and geology, explicitly recognising zoological fossils. European scientists regarded these as remnants from before the Deluge, or were created by the Devil to confuse good Christians. Some modern Creationists still think so. Every taxonomist in Malesia has encountered species named after him: “rumphii’, “rumphianus”, or based on taxa first described in his works. Rumphius and Ambon Ambon island (Pulau Ambon) in the 17th century (Fig. 3) was the centre of the spice trade: cloves, nutmeg, mace, and pepper. These commodities were very much in demand in Europe and worth a fortune once there. At one time for a bag of pepper one could buy an imposing house in a major town in The Netherlands!

Bull.

Its settlements were the predecessors of the Dutch East Indies, but also of the Republic of Ghana, and of South Africa, with settlements in many places, of note in the Arabian coast, S India, Sri Lanka (think of cinnamon!), Malaysia, Japan, and through Taiwan with China (think of the introduction of China ware, silk and tea in Europe!). It is a sad thing that the identity of Rumphia amboinensis L. is unknown. Linnaeus based this on a plate in Rheede’s Hortus malabaricus for a species from South India, a place where Rumphius had never been and whatever the identity of the species, it surely is not Amboinese. It just shows how little Linnaeus knew about geography, sometimes his provenance “India” even refers to the West Indies... Other generic eponyms in zoology are the gorgonian Rumphella Bayer (1955), called ‘sea tree” by Rumphius, because at that time everything that moved was an animal, and what didn’t was a plant. Linnaeus, also, regarded sponges (Spongia L.) as algae... There are also the sea urchins Rumphia Desor (1846; Miocene to Recent of the Indo-Pacific), Neorumphia Durham (1954), and Rumphiocrinus Wanner (1924). However, the butterfly Rumphia Pagenstecher (1909) is a typographical error for oO 5 Sawer? vey an >) Db anda Mare, Ambon. Georgius Everhardus Rumphius 5 Ramphia Guinée (1852). The botanical journal Rumphia appeared between 1836 and 1849. There is even a Rumphius Range in the Lorentz Park in Indonesian New Guinea. Rumphius was born in at the end of 1627 in Wolfersheim, Hessen, Germany. His mother came from Cleve (Kleef) near the Dutch border, where at the time Dutch was spoken, which would explain his impeccable and even innovative command of that language. His father was an engineer, a builder of fortresses, and passed on this knowledge to his son. Georg had a good education and finished the Gymnasium, but did not go the University and did not get a degree in Medicine in nearby Hanau as was later suggested. As he said later he wanted to see something of the world and in 1646 enrolled as a soldier, thinking that he would go the East Mediterranean, but instead he headed for Barbice in the Guyanas where the West Indian Company (WIC) was involved in wars with the Portuguese and Indians. There is still a saying in The Netherlands: “going to the barbiesjes”, that is, to meet certain death. Fortunately for him (and us) he somehow landed up in Portugal, where he served as a mercenary soldier for three years after which he was dismissed, possibly because the Catholics there didn’t trust Protestants like him. He returned to Germany for two years. He may well have heard about the riches of the East Indies from his Dutch relatives and wished to see them for himself. And thus at Christmas 1652 he left from The Netherlands as an ade/borst (midshipman) with the VOC. Note that he would have had a much higher rank if he had had an academic education and, especially, when he had been a physician. These were very much sought after by the VOC in view of the high rate of injuries, diseases and deaths that plagued the fleets and garrisons. Later authors thought he was a medical doctor, but he denied this and in fact he was an amateur naturalist and a self-made man in the best sense of the word. By the end of 1653 he arrived in Pulau Ambon, never to leave the Moluccas again. His father’s education now proved fruitful in the planning and construction of fortifications. However, soon after 1657, he switched from the military to the civilian and was appointed as Junior Merchant (onderkoopman) at Larike, on the West coast of Hitu. There he married Susanna, a local woman, possibly Chinese, according to European marriage records. He named the orchid F/os susannae after her, now Pecteilis susannae (L.) Raf. “in memory of her who during her life was my first companion and assistant in the finding of herbs and plants, she was the first to show me this flower” (Fig. 4). Larike was a back-water dump and because he had so little to do he could devote a great deal of his time in the studies of the Treasuries of Nature. Rumphius sent specimens to Europe which are not recorded in the VOC archives. This is not so strange, as the VOC did its utmost to prevent exports and forbid private mailings. Of course, everybody circumvented these rules. Rumphius is commended by all for his honesty, but apparently he had his channels. You might say that he was less corrupt than the others... In 1701 he also smuggled out the manuscript of d’Amboinsche Rariteitkamer (Fig. 5) to the mayor of Delft, Hendrik d’Acquet. It is interesting to note that some drawings of shells were made by Maria Sybille Merian (1647-1717), who also hand 6 Gard. Bull. Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 Fig. 4. Flos susannae, Pecteilis susannae (L.) Raf. (Orchidaceae). Georgius Everhardus Rumphius 7 coloured a few now priceless copies (Fig. 6). Where Rumphius was the founder of zoology and botany in the Moluccas, she was that for Surinam. He was elected as a member of what is now the oldest science society in the world, the Academia naturae curiosorum of the German Roman Empire (founded in 1657, today still in existence as the Leopoldina). Members were given nicknames, his was “Plinius”, a most honorific title as it was after the Roman procurator (‘administrator’) Gaius Plinius Secundus (23-79 A.D.), killed in the eruption of the Vesuvius which buried Pompeii and Herculaneum, and who was one of the founders of European natural sciences. His influence lasted for 1500 years until the end of the Middle Ages. Actually, Rumphius was more than Plinius, as the latter compiled existing knowledge, while Rumphius did mention his sources, but added personal experience. Blume, the second Director of the Kebun Raya Bogor, and then the first Director of the Rijksherbarium, in his turn as a member, was called “Rumphius”, but although a Medical Doctor from the Leiden University, he was a scientist of an entirely different kind. Thirteen of Rumphius’s letters were published in the Society’s journal Miscellanea Curiosa. In 1682 he sent shells, sea animals, minerals, resins, fossils, and some parts of plants in a cabinet made from 56 different kinds of wood to the Grand- duke of Toscane, Cosimo III de’Medici (1639-1723). Unfortunately, the chest and its contents have been lost, as the original labels have probably been replaced. Some shells may be present in the State Museum in Vienna, and perhaps some fragments of palms in Florence. In 1660 he was promoted to Merchant (koopman) and moved to Hila, a much more civilised place, where he lived like a prince: daily fresh venison, plenty of fish, and sheep, geese, ducks, and chickens, horses with superb bridles, some of pure silver. He had a one-gun vessel with 40 rowers. His gardens yielded cabbages, endives, lettuce, parsley, Chinese radishes, etc. He even had a small zoo. Life was pretty good! In 1662 he became Senior Merchant (opperkoopman). He then earned the extra-ordinary salary of 24 rixdollars (60 guilders, or 1200 Dutch shillings) a month. In comparison, Jan van Riebeeck, the famous Governor of the Cape, got “only” 21. He stayed there for 10 years, rather exceptional, as VOC employees usually were translocated after about 5 years to prevent too good connections for graft and smuggling. This may well be due to the good opinion his superiors had of his honesty. In August 1663, he wrote a letter to the Board of the VOC in which he asked for permission to have books sent for his work on the plants and animals of the East Indies. This was granted, but only in 1666 did he receive them. One of his arguments was, that God in His wisdom had provided local herbs to cure local diseases, so a better knowledge of what was available would be beneficial to all. The medicines shipped from The Netherlands were ineffective and often spoiled. He noted that although many local recipes might be fables, superstitions, or old wives’ tales, they should be included as there might be some truth in them. Of course he lacked the occasion and time to try all medicines, but some he had “tested in mine own house, and with other families”. ; His accounts are not bone dry enumerations as was usual for herbals at the time, but every species got an extensive description, where it occurred, what it was 8 Gard. Bull. Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 used for, a recipe, anecdotes, and sometimes a joke. For instance, that newcomers (orang baru) were fooled with the resin of the pine Agathis, which they were told were lumps of sugar, with which they then went into hiding to quietly and privately enjoy the supposed delicacy. Of course he speaks much of diseases, health, birth, death, and D AMBOINSCHE RARITEITKAMER, Behelzende eene BESCHRYVINGE van allerhande z00 weeke als harde SCHAAL ViSsUBEe. te weeten raare KRABBEN, KREEFTEN, en diergelyke Zecdieren , als mede allerhande HOORNTYES en SCHULPEN, die men in d’Amboinfche Zee vindt: Daar beneven zommige MINERAALEN, CESTEENTEN, en foorten van AARDE, dic in d’ Amboinfche , en zom- mige omleggende Eilanden gevonden worden.

A lot about sex, for that is part of life, but in a quiet, unsensational way, sometimes with a chuckle on human foolishness. In 1666, he was temporarily appointed as Secunde (“second man’), a rank immediately under that of Governor, but was not confirmed in it. In compensation he was allowed to buy a piece of land. Here he created a Physic Garden, the first western type of botanical garden in Asia. He also had a forest garden long known as Dusun Rumphius. His contract with the VOC after having served 16 years, expired in 1668 and he was supposed to retire (at 41!) and go back to Europe. He was quite happy where he was and with what he was doing, so somehow he managed to extend his stay with retention of his salary forever. Life was good! Fig. 6. A rare coloured plate of the Rariteitskabinet by Maria Sybille Merian. Blindness and personal tragedy Things changed considerably when in April 1670, at 42, he turned incurably blind (glaucoma simplex), about the worst thing that can happen to a dedicated naturalist. With the aid of his son and some assistants provided by the VOC, he continued with his work. The original manuscripts were in Latin, but because his assistants didn’t know that language, he had to dictate them in Dutch. Here he showed his linguistic proficiency. Descriptive botany is a language by itself and in his time it had hardly 10 Gard. Bull. Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 evolved, certainly not in Dutch. Consulting literature will have been a problem, as these were of course in Latin and mainly dealt with the European flora. Works on Asian plants were by the Portuguese Garcia de Orta (1501-1568) published by Carolus Clusius (1567, 1582, 1593, 1605) from Goa 1n India, Hendrik Adriaan Rheede van Drakenstein’s (1633-1691) 12-volume Hortus malabaricus (1678-1692) on South Indian ones, and a medical textbook by Jacob Bontius (1592—1631) for plants in Batavia. Later, Burman very carefully translated it all back again into Latin. On Saturday, 17 February 1674, it was near the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. Rumphius didn’t attend, because, as he said, he couldn’t see anything. Suddenly, there was a huge earthquake followed by tsunamis, killing 2322 people. A falling wall killed Susanna, two of their daughters, and a maid. On Saturday, 11 January 1687, in Kota Ambon, where he now lived, he had another disaster. The town was razed by fire which destroyed his precious library, collections, and most of his manuscripts. Only parts of the Herbarium amboinense and about half of its plates were saved. Yet, undaunted by blindness and his awful losses, Rumphius dictated the lost chapters to his assistants again from memory and they managed to redraw the lost plates, probably under the supervision of his son Paulus. By the end of 1690 the first part of his magnum opus, six books of the Herbarium amboinense were sent to Batavia, where they were copied for safe keeping. Not without reason, for it was a long and hazardous journey back to Europe. Indeed, the Waterman that carried them in 1692 was sunk by the French. A second copy was made including three additional books that had arrived in the meantime, and by August 1697 everything was safely in the Netherlands. A year later, the final three books were received. Two additional appendices were shipped by 1704. On May 19, 1702, the Governor of Ambon wrote to the High Government at Batavia about Rumphius “nothing more was to be expected of that old gentleman, having lived his years”, and on June 15 he died, 75 years old, very old for a European in the tropics. No special mention is made in the missives from Ambon, but casually, under another heading it is noted that he left 4000 rixdollars (10,000 guilders, or 200,000 Dutch shillings), quite a fortune, about two million Euro at present rates, and various pieces of estate (land, houses), the savings of about 50 years of duty. Subsequent events If you think the VOC would have been quick to publish this magnum opus, you are very much mistaken. Such a publication would be very expensive and would not provide any profits, so the Board would allow it as long as it would not cost the Company a penny. But there were no takers. Thus the manuscripts were locked up in their vaults. Johannes Burman (1707-1779) was allowed by the VOC to prepare the manuscripts for publication in 1735. He meticulously translated Rumphius’s poetic and flowery Dutch back into Latin and had etchings made of the drawings and colour plates. Take, for instance, the comparison Rumphius made of the wine-producing palm Arenga pinnata Merr.: “and thus it resembles in its ugly and uncouth habit a drunken Georgius Everhardus Rumphius 11 Fig. 7. Arenga pinnata Merr. as in the Herbarium amboinense (left) and in the manuscript of the Leiden University (right). farmer as he jumps up from his sleep with mended rags and tussled hair. Indeed, this is the most ugly of all trees” (Fig. 7). It was a very expensive publication, only 500 copies were printed, the set costing about 100 guilders (2000 Dutch shillings, now Euro 20,000), about a third of the income of a physician in Amsterdam. The original drawings often are in colour, but the books were already so expensive, that printing with coloured plates would make them completely out of reach. Thus it may happen that when Rumphius speaks of several species it is not quite clear which one has been depicted. An example 1s Corona ariadnes punicea with red flowers and Corona ariadnes lutea with yellow ones, but the legend does not state with one is represented. The coloured plate in the Leiden University Library shows the flowers to be red, so after more than 260 years we now know that the plate represents the punicea form, a synonym of Hoya coronaria Blume (Fig. 8). Similar problems may well be solved so easily. Also, there have been only few attempts to recollect representative material. Most were only half-heartedly done, or the scientists died before arriving at the island. The most serious attempt was by Charles Budd Robinson (1871—1913), an American botanist sent there by Merrill, who made a large collection of Rumphian and non- 12 Gard. Bull.

Rumphian species, but was prematurely murdered. Merrill distributed 18 duplicate series and by these many Rumphian taxa can be identified and the names exclusively based on them, neo- or epitypified (when the type is the illustration). The series have been deposited in A, BM, BO, F, K, LMO, NSW, NY, US. The top set with the original labels are in US, so in typifications these should be designated as the holotypes. Anyway, these texts after so many years are still the only extensive source on the flora of Ambon. It is therefore remarkable that although there are various concordances, there has never been a reprint. Fortunately, the original texts can now be found on the internet, but unfortunately, very few have sufficient knowledge of Dutch and Latin to be able to read them. The good news now is that Monty Beekman (1939— 2008) just before his death was able to finalise a translation into English which was released to the public on 20 June 2011, but was on 4 and 5 February 2011 officially presented to his widow, Faith Foss, by the Yale University Press at the Fairchild Botanic Gardens in Florida. This will make this seminal publication available to the Anglophone public and thus it will be a very valuable addition to the knowledge of the past, present, and future events of the Flora Malesiana. Of course the work has been extensively data mined. You will find references in Heyne’s Useful Plants of the Dutch East Indies, sometimes as the only reference. From there they found their way to Burkill’s Dictionary of the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula and, more recently, into the publications of PROSEA. oS) Georgius Everhardus Rumphius ] Epitaph Monuments have been raised for Rumphius, the first destroyed by tomb-robbers, the second (erected in 1824) hit by an Allied bomb in 1944, and a third was built in a slightly different place (yard of the Xaverius Junior High School, Jl.

Group B1 consists of D. macroptera, D. mogeana and D. robusta. Group B2 consists of D. riedeliana and D. sarasinorum. An identification key to species and their descriptions are presented. Keywords. Calamoideae, Daemonorops, Palmae, phonetic analysis, rattans, Sulawesi Introduction The palm flora of Sulawesi is distinctive and combines elements in common with Sunda, Sahul, the Philippines, and the Papua New Guinea. In the case of Daemonorops, all seven species recognised are endemic to the island and their affinities are not yet clear — whether with Sunda, Philippines or East Malesia. The genus Daemonorops itself is not well collected and poorly represented further east. Until recently, five species of Daemonorops were recorded for Sulawesi. As a result of recent fieldwork, a further two species have been recognised and described (Rustiami 2009). The purpose of this study to investigate morphological variation within Daemonorops in Sulawesi using a phenetic analysis of morphological data taken from herbarium specimens. This is done as a precursor to a treatment of the genus for Flora Malesiana. The genus Daemonorops was described by Blume (1830), based on a single species which he named Daemonorops melanochaetes Blume. Daemonorops with more than 120 species is the second largest rattan genus after Ca/amus. It belongs to the subtribe Calaminae, tribe Calameae of the palm subfamily Calamoideae. Beccari (1911) divided Daemonorops into two sections based on the structure of the inflorescence, i.e., section Cymbospatha and section Piptospatha. Basically, the former have concave boat-shaped bracts which are at anthesis completely enclosed 18 Gard. Bull. Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 by the prophyll (the first bract) and splitting longitudinally to expose the flowers. In contrast, the bracts of the species in the latter section split to the base and only the lower part is enclosed by the prophyll. Of the 84 species identified, Beccari placed 32 species in the former section and 52 species in the latter. According to Furtado (1953) the bracts of section Piptospatha usually fall at anthesis and occasionally only the prophyll remains. The name Daemonorops is derived from the Greek language combining two words daemon (devil) and rops (bush or shrub). This name reflects the fearsome appearance of the plant with its very robust leaf sheaths densely armed with long, blackish brown or cream-coloured spines (Dransfield et al. 2008). Material and methods Field work was carried out in several areas of Sulawesi to collect herbarium material. Herbarium specimen preparation followed the standard procedure of Dransfield (1986). Data or information recorded from the field include location; general habitat; altitude; association with other plant; vernacular name(s); uses; habit (solitary vs. clustered); stem attributes (height, diameter with/without leaf sheath, internode length, colour); characteristics of the leaves (length, leaflet arrangement, number of leaflets, length and width of leaflets); inflorescence characteristics (length, number of rachilla, colour); flower attributes (colour, scented/not scented); and fruit and seed characteristics (length and width, colour). Field work data was combined with herbarium data for each taxon to obtain a more comprehensive set of morphological data. Morphological studies were carried out with specimens in several herbaria: Herbarium Bogoriense (BO), the Kew Herbarium (K) and the Leiden Herbarium (L). A total of 300 herbarium specimens were studied following Vogel (1987) and Rifai (1976), using comparative morphological data as the main source of evidence in developing the species concept (Dransfield 1999). Twenty seven morphometric characters were chosen (Table 1). These were scored using two simple states (absent — 0: present — 1). The data processing was carried out using the NT-Sys program 2.1 (Rohlf 1997). The descriptions of each species and identification key for Daemonorops were constructed based on the characters and character-states recorded. Results and discussion Fig. | shows the result of the phenetic analysis, in which seven species of Daemonorops are differentiated morphologically based on twenty seven characters. The specimens are Clearly divisible into two groups (A and B) with a coefficient similarity value of 0.51. This value means that these two groups only have morphological similarity of around 51%. Group A consists of D. takanensis and D. lamprolepis where these two Daemonorops in Sulawesi 19 Table 1.

Group B divided into two sub- groups, B1| and B2, with a coefficient similarity value of 0.59. From the phenogram we can see that D. macroptera and D. mogeana have a morphological similarity of around 81%. Those two species are close to D. robusta, with 67.4% similarity. In the other group we can see that D. riedeliana and D. sarasinorum have a similarity of around 77.4%. Daemonorops mogeana, D. macroptera and D. robusta clustered in one group. This is because they have some similarities in their leaf sheath armature and leaflet arrangement. However they do differ in their general morphological appearance. The stem of Daemonorops is covered by tightly sheathing, densely spiny, leaf sheaths. The diameter of the stem with the leaf sheaths can vary from a few mm to over 10 cm. Leaves consist of a tubular sheathing base, the leaf sheath, which arises from the node on the stem; at its upper end, the sheath narrows into the petiole that continues into the rachis or leaflet-bearing portion of the leaf. Although a petiole is usually present, it is sometimes very short or absent. In many species, the rachis is extended beyond the terminal leaflets into a barbed whip (cirrus) which acts as a 20 Gard.

Spine arrangement on the leaf sheath is remarkably diverse and frequently of diagnostic importance. Just below the petiole or leaf rachis, there is a marked swelling known as the knee. This character is also of some diagnostic importance, because some of the Daemonorops species do not have very obvious knees or the knee 1s only slightly developed. As with most rattans, Daemonorops are dioecious, that is, female and male flowers are borne on different plants. The main axis bears a basal bract or prophyll, which may be short and tubular, or large. Branches are borne in the axils of subsequent bracts. The branches in turn bear bracts, the lowermost of which is usually empty, subsequent bracts subtending branches, and so on. The ultimate flower-bearing branches are termed partial inflorescences. On each female flower, there is a bracteole which immediately surrounding the flower, known as an involucre and an outer bract known as the involucrophore. Flowers are borne in dyads with two bracteoles in the female and in the male flowers are solitary with one bracteole. Taxonomic treatment Daemonorops Blume in J.A. & J.H. Schultes, Syst. Veg. 7(2): 1333 (1830). Solitary or clustering rattans, acaulescent to high-climbing hapaxanthic (then always very short-stemmed) or pleonanthic, dioecious. Sheaths usually heavily armed with spines, the spines frequently highly organised. Flagellum absent. Knee frequently present. Leaves ecirrate in acaulescent species or longly cirrate. Leaflets variously arranged. Inflorescence male and female superficially similar, but within the genus of Daemonorops in Sulawesi 21 two basic types: one with all bracts enclosed within the outermost bract or prophyll, splitting along their length to expose the flowers (section Cymbospatha) or the other with bracts splitting along their entire length to leave no tubular portion and frequently falling (section Piptospatha). Bracts variously armed. Partial inflorescences longer than the subtending bract in section Piptospatha: bracteoles and “involucres” inconspicuous. Male rachilla bearing male solitary flowers, male flowers small, cup- shaped; calyx with three small lobes: corolla split to the base into 3 petals: stamen 6, slightly epipetalous; pistillode minute. Sterile male flower found with each female flower, as the fertile male, but stamens with empty anthers. Female rachilla bearing many flowers in dyads consists of one female flower and one sterile male flower. Female flower with calyx truncate or shallowly 3-lobed: corolla with 3 petals; gynoecium with 3 stigmas and with 3 loculi. Sterile flower smaller or at least more slender than the female ones, with well-formed calyx and corolla and 6 sterile stamens and an abortive ovary. Fruit variously shaped, tipped with stigmatic remains and covered with reflexed scales. Seed only one, covered by thin to thick, sweet or sour sarcotesta. Endosperm deeply ruminate. Embryo basal. Distribution. Based on Dransfield et al. (2008), the geographical distribution of Daemonorops is more restricted than Calamus. The centre of distribution of both are similar, from China, India to New Guinea, specifically Sumatra, Malaya, Borneo and Malay Peninsula. Daemonorops does not occur in Africa, Himalaya, Peninsular India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Habitat. Rather disturbed primary forest, on alluvial soil near rivers, flat to gently sloping terrain, ridge tops, lowland forest, and steep hill slopes in primary forest on volcanic soils. Uses. One species is recorded to have sweet, edible young shoot (Mogea 1991). Key to Daemonorops species in Sulawesi la.

Eight species of Pandanaceae (3 Freycinetia spp., 5 Pandanus spp.) were recorded from the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park and adjacent areas in the West and Central Kalimantan Provinces, Indonesia. Pandanus aristatus was recollected and the description improved. Pandanus motleyanus has been assigned to synonymy under P. yvanii. Pandanus yvanii and P. helicopus were found to occupy different niches in the peat swamps. Pandanus epiphyticus Martelli and P. pachyphyllus Merrill were recorded for the first time in Kalimantan. The doubtful presence of F’ sumatrana in Java is resolved. Two Eastern Malesian species, F, amboinensis and F; ceramensis are synonyms of F. sumatrana, thus the species is now an exceptionally widespread species in both western and eastern Malesia. Full descriptions of species are provided. Keywords. Borneo, Bukit Baka Raya, Freycinetia, Kalimantan, Pandanaceae, Pandanus Introduction The pandan flora of Borneo has been studied by Stone (1970a, 1993). Most of the species enumerated were from Sarawak and Sabah and little was known from Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, particularly from the southwestern part, where the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park 1s located. Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park is a protected area within the Schwaner Range on the border between the Indonesian Provinces of West and Central Kalimantan, with an area of approximately 181,090 hectares. Prior to this study, the latest pandan collecting activity in the vicinity was by Nieuwenhuis in the western and central parts of Kalimantan (Nieuwenhuis 1898, Steenis 1950). The pandan collections collected during the Nieuwenhuis expedition were identified by Martelli and later mentioned in his two enumerations (Martelli 1910, 1913). Merrill (1922) and Martelli (1929) also cited these expedition specimens in their accounts on the pandan of Borneo, in which 32 Gard. Bull. Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 many of the collections had been appointed as types. Although numerous publications have been produced since (see Kanehira 1938; St. John 1961, 1965; Stone 1967a, 1967b, 1970a, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1983b, 1993), the pandan flora of the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park and surrounding areas was hardly mentioned and still made reference to Martelli (1929). Only Pandanus aristatus was mentioned for the National Park (Stone 1993). The most recent expedition carried out within the National Park was the 1982—1983 expedition in Bukit Raya conducted by Reuler (1987), when no pandan was collected. This paper describes several species of the pandan flora in the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park and adjacent areas, including the Gunung Kelam Ecopark and Baning Protected Forest, based on the most recent expedition in 2006, as well as observations made with herbarium specimens kept in the BO Herbarium.

Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 Ap Among members of the section Polystachya in Borneo that have infructescences with 3 cephalia or more, FE. kartawinatae differs from F) kinabaluana in its terminal infructescences with 3-4 cephalia, compared to the lateral infructescences of F kinabaluana that have 5—6 cephalia per infructescence. Freycinetia kuchinensis also has reddish orange bracts, but differs in having 2—3 cephalia per infructescence (fide Martelli 1910) that are globose, compared to the 3-4 cylindric-elongate cephalia per infructescence in F. kartawinatae. Although it has similarly long (40-60 cm) leaves and also 3-4 stigmas, F) sarawakensis differs from F. kartawinatae in its lateral (not terminal) infructescences and scabrid (not glabrous) pedicels. A taxon from Sarawak would appear to have many similarities with F kartawinatae, especially in having orange bracts, terminal infructescences, and 3-4 cephalia per infructescence. This taxon was named F. andersoniana by Stone (1967c), but invalidly published. Specimens examined: Only known from the type. 2. Freycinetia sumatrana Hemsley, J. Linn. Soc. Bot. 30: 167 (1894).

In Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park commonly found at elevations lower than 500 m (Fig. 2). One specimen (F’H. Endert 3875, BO!) was collected from Mount Kemoel in East Kalimantan at 1200 m. Vernacular names. Rajak (Dayak, Balaban dialect). Uses. Leaves are used for baskets, mats and handicrafts. Notes. The differences between F) swmatrana and the taxa listed above in the synonymy are slight and merely in leaf dimensions, cephalia size, colour of bracts, appearance of auricles, pedicel surface, and stigma number. The possession of lobed auricles is a more important feature that distinguishes this species, as acknowledged previously by Stone (1968), who newly proposed the section, Auriculifoliae based on this character. A year later, Stone (1969) excluded F: loheri and F; vidalii from the section based on the fact that neither of these two species actually possessed lobed auricles. In the same publication Ff! auriculata was placed as a synonym of F) sumatrana. Finally, F) valida was included into synonymy (Stone 1970a). The present study supports Stone in placing F) auwriculata and F. valida as synonyms of F. sumatrana. Despite no information concerning bract colour and the relatively smaller size of the cephalium, there is no significant difference between F: auriculata and F) sumatrana. For F- valida, Ridley (1907; 1925) did not mention anything about the bract colour. Only a brief note on the female bract was given, which was described as leaf- like and not coloured. We interpret “not coloured” as white, so that is not different from F. sumatrana. Actually, Ridley (1925) himself noted that F) valida is very near to F) sumatrana. Regardless of the immature state of the cephalia, the observations made on the types indicate that there is no single decisive morphological character that can be used to distinguish F) amboinensis or F: lucida from F. sumatrana. The placement of F) amboinensis as synonym has a further consequence that F. sumatrana 1s now found in the Moluccas, particularly in Ambon and Halmahera 36 Gard. Bull.

Pandanaceae in Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park 37 Islands; thus new records of FE. swmatrana for the two islands. The presence of F: sumatrana in the Moluccas 1s also supported by the placement of F) ceramensis into its synonymy. Although F’ ceramensis possesses auricles with more pronounced spines (Fig. 3), this is insufficient for distinction from F. swmatrana. Observations made on specimens recently collected from Seram, an island within the Moluccas Archipelago just north of Ambon (Keim et al. 2008) indicate that the spines vary from minute to apparent even in the same branch. Auricles with minute spines are usually observed on younger leaves (1.e., the terminal part of the branch), whereas auricles with larger spines are found on older leaves. Prior to this placement F) ceramensis was known as an endemic of Seram Island; so now F. sumatrana is also newly recorded for the island. The placement of two Eastern Malesian species (F- amboinensis and F. ceramensis) into the synonymy of F) swmatrana has the consequence that the species is now recognised as one of the most widespread species of the genus in Malesia, occupying both western and eastern parts. The other such species is F. scandens. Stone (1970b) described the smaller overall dimensions and “entire auricle” as two important characters that distinguish F) /ucida from F- sumatrana. That description of the auricle does not agree with the protologue (Martelli 1910) that clearly described the auricle as with minute spines (original text: “ad margines crebre et minute fimbriato- denticulatis”). The present study is in favour of Martelli; thus, the possession of spiny auricles helps place F. /ucida in the synonymy of F) sumatrana. Stone (1970a) identified a specimen collected from the top of Mount Beratus (altitude 1200 m) in South Kalimantan, W. Meijer 904 (BO! with duplicate at L) as F. lucida. This specimen has now been determined as F- sumatrana, and marks the first record of F- sumatrana in the Indonesian part of Borneo (Kalimantan). The collections made in this present study support the identification of the species in Kalimantan. Previously F. sumatrana was only known from Sarawak and Sabah (Stone 1970a). As a consequence, Ff. sumatrana is now known to be more widely distributed throughout Borneo. A specimen (F’H. Endert 3875) was also collected from 1200 m, and in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, the species can still be found at an altitude of approximately 1828 m (Stone 1970b). The varietal status of F) swmatrana var. penangiana is not accepted as the slight differences in the shape and colour of the auricles mentioned by Stone (1970b) are regarded as insufficient distinction, based on observations from the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park. The specimens clearly show that auricles can vary from tapered to lobed even in the same shoot (Fig. 4). There is also variation in auricle colour from bright purplish pink to light brownish yellow. Actually the variation in the type of auricle in F. swmatrana is not unusual. An infructescence with 4 cephalia observed in one of the collections made for this study (4.P. Keim 764, BO!; Fig. 2) raises the possibility that this could be a member of the section Polystachya, which in Borneo is represented by a single known species, F. kinabaluana (Stone 1970a). However, the specimen clearly possesses a lobed auricle, a feature that is completely absent in F: kinabaluana. Freycinetia kinabaluana, on the other hand, has a lateral infructescence consisting of S—6 cephalia. Frevcinetia ard. bull. Singapore 63( 2) 20 38 Gard. Bull. Singapore 63(1 & 2) 2011 cu Fig. 3.

Pandanaceae in Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park 39 sumatrana always has terminal infructescences and has never been reported having more than 4 cephalia in one infructescence. Stone (1970c) notes that F. swmatrana in the Malay Peninsula has 3-4 cephalia per infructecence, and we know of at least one collection with 4 cephalia, Endert 3875 (BO! duplicate at L), which was collected from Sumatra.

Tapered (left arrow) and lobed (right arrow) auricles can be found in the same young shoot (auricles are purplish pink in fresh specimens, but on mature branches or stems, brownish yellow ones are more common). Photo: A.P. Keim, Rugayah & H. Rustiami. Numerous specimens from Java kept in BO that were previously labelled F: valida had been identified by Stone as F. sumatrana. Based on this, Stone (1972) suggested the presence of the species in Java. The same specimens have been re- identified in the present study as belonging to F. insignis based on the fact that none of those specimens actually has the distinctive lobed auricle and information from the fieldnotes clearly mentioned deep red or pale purplish red bracts, a feature that is characteris of F) insignis. The presence of the true auriculate F) swmatrana in Java was finally proven based on collections recently made in the Gunung Tukung Gede Nature Reserve in Banten, western Java (7. Djarwaningsih 1499; Djarwaningsih pers. comm., 2010; Fig. 5). This is expected, as the islands of Java and Sumatra are only separated by the 40 Gard. Bull.

Pandanaceae in Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park 4] relatively narrow Sunda Strait. Freycinetia walkeri shares many morphological similarities with F- swmatrana, particularly the lobed auricle and the number of stigmas. Indeed, other than the colour of the bracts, there is no substantial difference between this species and F. sumatrana. Stone (1975) mentioned that F’ walkeri differs from F) suwmatrana only in the smaller size of the cephalium (Stone wrote “fruits”) and red floral bracts. Solms (1878) did not mention bract colour and it was Stone (1969: 1975) who mentioned the red bract colour based on observations he made on several non-type specimens, particularly N. Wirawan 818. The BO Herbarium has two specimens identified by Stone (1975) as F. walkeri, N. Wirawan 818 (BO!) and Kostermans 24071 (BO!). Wirawan 818 is a staminate collection from the vicinity of Ratnapura, Ceylon in 1969, in which the bract colour is noted as bright red, while Kostermans 24071 (collected also in Ratnapura vicinity, Ceylon in 1973) is a pistillate collection with a fieldnote mentioning the fruit as dark red. Stone did visit Ceylon, but mostly worked in the Peradeniya Botanic Garden, thus he had never seen or collected F’ walkeri in the field and was apparently using only specimens and citing from fieldnotes. The result of this current study is not in accordance with Stone in recognising the two specimens as F. wa/keri. Neither has the distinctive lobed auricle, and the specimens are unlikely to be F) walkeri. Therefore, Stone’s description of the bract colour in F’ walkeri as red is considered doubtful. Until better specimens become available F- walkeri is regarded as a distinct species but closely allied to F sumatrana. Further study is still required. When the matter of bract colour is resolved, F- swmatrana is likely to become a synonym of F. walkeri based on the law of priority. Specimens examined: INDONESIA.

Unfortunately the only specimen collected in this current study (AK 769) is a sterile one. Identification of this material as possibly belonging to F- tenuis is based on the habit, leaf dimensions, and colouration of auricles, which are in accordance with the protologue (Solms 1879; see also Warburg 1900), particularly the distinctive deep purplish red leaf sheath and tapered auricles. Freycinetia tenuis is the smallest member of the genus in Borneo. The species was recorded for Borneo by Stone (1970a) in Sabah, North Borneo; thus, as in the case of F’ sumatrana, the presence of F. tenuis in Borneo strengthens the biogeographical link between Sumatra and Borneo (1.e., Sahulland).
