Reports and bulletins are sent free upon application to the Director.\n\nPREFACE.\n\nThis preliminary bulletin on Texas Honey Plants represents work of the Department of Entomology dating through the office tenures of Professors Mally, Newell, Sanderson and Conradi. They each have authorized and aided in the collection of the flora and data contained in this publication.\n\nTo Mr. Louis H. Scholl, of New Braunfels, Texas, Assistant and Apiarist from 1902 until 1906, the Department is directly indebted for the material contained herein, except as is otherwise designated.\n\nMr. Ernest Scholl, now Assistant and Apiarist, has furnished material as shown herein. He is now working on a continuation of the subject.\n\nMr. D. C. Milam, of Uvalde, formerly Foul Brood Inspector, has also contributed, as is shown.\n\nThe main body of the work, however, has been accomplished through the services of Mr. Louis H. Scholl, and much credit is due him, since he has done more in this Department, and perhaps more than any other person in helping to build up the Bee Industry of Texas. His data are followed by this mark *\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThis publication treats of many of the Texas honey plants in a brief technical manner. In addition, wherever possible, the common name is used in connection with the description.\n\nThe sequence followed by Coulter in his Botany of South West Texas is herein mainly followed. In some instances quotations from Small's Botany of Texas were used, as is shown in the publication. The plants are discussed by families.\n\nNot only is the honey producing qualities of the plants mentioned, but frequent mention is also made of the respective quality and yield of pollen and propolis. Data are included in many instances concerning the weather conditions and its effects upon the yield of certain plants.\n\nIt is hoped that this will be a great help to apiarists in selecting locations for bees, since the value of bees depends entirely on the environment under which they may be placed. Again it may help in selecting certain plants to be planted that might prove to be very beneficial to an established apiary.\n\nThe geographical distribution is given in a general brief way, so that one is less apt to be confused concerning the abundance in nature of certain plants. In this connection it must be remembered, however, that on account of extended cultivation in Texas, some of the common wild plants are becoming less numerous than formerly, while cultivated varieties are becoming more common.\n\nTwo indices are contained in this bulletin. The first contains all the common or vernacular names, and the second contains the latin or technical names. The latter is complete, since some plants are known only by the technical appellation.\n\nTRIPLE-LEAFED BARBERRY. Berberis trifoliata Moric.\n\nBarberry family.
