Retrospective cohort study. City of London and Middlesex County, Canada. Singleton live births, delivered at 34-41 weeks to London-Middlesex mothers following spontaneous labour. Data were obtained from a city-wide perinatal database on births between 2002 and 2011 (n = 17,678). Multivariable analyses used multinomial logistic regression. The outcome of interest was the occurrence of late preterm (34-36 weeks) and early term (37-38 weeks) birth, compared with full term birth (39-41 weeks). After controlling for covariates, there were associations between infection and inflammation and late preterm birth (aOR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.65, 2.60); between placental ischaemia and other hypoxia and late preterm (aOR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.88, 2.61) and early term (aOR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.13, 1.39) birth; between diabetes mellitus and late preterm (aOR = 3.89, 95% CI 2.90, 5.21) and early term (aOR = 2.66, 95% CI 2.19, 3.23) birth; and between other biological determinants (polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios) and late preterm (aOR = 2.81, 95% CI 1.70, 4.64) and early term (aOR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.32, 2.70) birth. Our findings show that delivery following spontaneous labour even close to full term may be a result of pathological processes. Because these biological determinants of preterm birth contribute to an adverse intrauterine environment, they have important implications for fetal and neonatal health.

This study investigated whether early spontaneous movements also have predictive value for the intellectual and behavioural problems that children born very preterm often experience. Spontaneous movement quality was assessed, using Prechtl's method, at 11 to 16 weeks post-term in 65 infants born at early movement quality and outcome. Spontaneous movement quality at 11 to 16 weeks post-term was significantly, positively associated with later intelligence. The number of normal postural patterns displayed contributed most strongly to the association, which was not mediated by neurological status. Fidgety movements, strong predictors of later neurological dysfunction, were not associated with intelligence. Spontaneous movement quality was not associated with internalising or externalising problems but showed a trend to an association with attention problems. These findings suggest that, in children born preterm, early spontaneous movement quality has clear prognostic value for neurological and intellectual outcome, and to a lesser extent, for attentional outcome. However, cognitive outcome was associated with the presence of specific, age-appropriate postural patterns, while neurological outcome has been associated with the presence of global movement abnormalities. The presence of specific, age-appropriate postural patterns may reflect the integrity of areas of the brain involved in cognitive processing and the\n\nEarly preterm delivery due to placenta previa is an independent risk factor for a subsequent spontaneous preterm birth\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground To determine whether patients with placenta previa who delivered preterm have an increased risk for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. Methods This retrospective population based cohort study included patients who delivered after a primary cesarean section (n = 9983). The rate of placenta previa, its recurrence, and the risk for recurrent preterm birth were determined. Results Patients who had a placenta previa at the primary CS pregnancy had an increased risk for its recurrence [crude OR of 2.65 (95% CI 1.3-5.5)]. The rate of preterm birth in patients with placenta previa in the primary CS pregnancy was 55.9%; and these patients had a higher rate of recurrent preterm delivery than the rest of the study population (p < .001). Among patients with placenta previa in the primary CS pregnancy, those who delivered preterm had a higher rate of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth regardless of the location of their placenta in the subsequent delivery [OR 3.09 (95% CI 2.1-4.6)]. In comparison to all patients with who had a primary cesarean section, patients who had placenta previa and delivered preterm had an independent increased risk for recurrent preterm birth [OR of 3.6 (95% CI 1.5-8.5)]. Conclusions Women with placenta previa, who deliver preterm, especially before 34 weeks of gestation, are at increased risk for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth regardless to the site of placental implantation in the subsequent pregnancy. Thus, strict follow up by high risk pregnancies specialist is recommended.

Consultation of the database Pubmed/Medline, Science Direct, and international guidelines of medical societies. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a dysbiosis resulting in an imbalance in the vaginal flora through the multiplication of anaerobic bacteria and jointly of a disappearance of well-known protective Lactobacilli. His diagnosis is based on clinical Amsel criteria and/or a Gram stain with establishment of the Nugent score. The prevalence of the BV extraordinarily varies according to ethnic and/or geographical origin (4-58Â %), in France, it is close to 7Â % in the first trimester of pregnancy (EL2). The link between BV and spontaneous premature delivery is low with an odds ratio between 1.5Â and 2Â in the most recent studies (EL3). Metronidazole or clindamycin is effective to treat BV (EL3). It is recommended to prescribe one of these antibiotics in the case of symptomatic BV (Professional Consensus). The testing associated with the treatment of BV in the global population showed no benefit in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (EL2). Concerning low-risk asymptomatic population (defined by the absence of antecedent of premature delivery), it has been failed profit to track and treat the BV in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (EL1). Concerning the high-risk population (defined by a history of preterm delivery), it has been failed profit to track and treat the VB in the prevention of the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (EL3). However, in the sub population of patients with a history of preterm delivery occurred in a context of materno-fetal bacterial infection, there may be a benefit to detect and treat early and systematically genital infection, and in particular the BV (Professional Consensus).

Preterm parturition is one of the âgreat obstetrical syndromesâ and is caused by multiple etiologies. One of the mechanisms of disease is the untimely decline in progesterone action, which can be manifested by a sonographic short cervix in the midtrimester. The detection of a short cervix in the midtrimester is a powerful risk factor for preterm delivery. Vaginal progesterone can reduce the rate of preterm delivery by 45%, and the rate of neonatal morbidity (admission to neonatal intensive care unit, respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, etc.). To prevent one case of spontaneous preterm birth <33 weeks of gestation, 12 patients with a short cervix would need to be treated. Vaginal progesterone reduces the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with a short cervix both with and without a prior history of preterm birth. In patients with a prior history of preterm birth, vaginal progesterone is as effective as cervical cerclage to prevent preterm delivery. 17Î±-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has not been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with a short cervix.

Prospective cohort study using data of the nationwide perinatal registry in The Netherlands. We studied 1,524,058 singleton pregnancies between 1999 and 2007. We developed a multiple logistic regression model to estimate the risk of spontaneous preterm birth based on maternal and pregnancy characteristics. We used bootstrapping techniques to internally validate our model. Discrimination (AUC), accuracy (Brier score) and calibration (calibration graphs and Hosmer-Lemeshow C-statistic) were used to assess the model's predictive performance. Our primary outcome measure was spontaneous preterm birth at <37 completed weeks. Spontaneous preterm birth occurred in 57,796 (3.8%) pregnancies. The final model included 13 variables for predicting preterm birth. The predicted probabilities ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 (IQR 0.02-0.04). The model had an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.63 (95% CI 0.63-0.63), the Brier score was 0.04 (95% CI 0.04-0.04) and the Hosmer Lemeshow C-statistic was significant (p<0.0001). The calibration graph showed overprediction at higher values of predicted probability. The positive predictive value was 26% (95% CI 20-33%) for the 0.4 probability cut-off point. The model's discrimination was fair and it had modest calibration. Previous preterm birth, drug abuse and vaginal bleeding in the first half of pregnancy were the most important predictors for spontaneous preterm birth. Although not applicable in clinical practice yet, this model is a next step towards early prediction of spontaneous preterm birth that enables caregivers to start preventive therapy in women at higher risk.

Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of preterm deliveries over a 10-year period, 2004â2013, including detailed review of 929 of 5,566 preterm deliveries to designate each delivery as provider-initiated or spontaneous. We dichotomized the time period into early (2004â2009) and late (2010â2013). We used log-binomial regression to calculate adjusted risk ratios. Results Of the 46,981 deliveries, 5,566 (11.8%) were preterm, with a significant reduction in the overall incidence of preterm delivery from 12.3% to 11.2% (P=0.0003). Among the 929 preterm deliveries analyzed, there was a reduction in the proportion of provider-initiated deliveries from 48.3% to 41.8% that was not statistically significant. The proportion of provider-initiated preterm deliveries among black, but not white, women declined from 50.8% to 39.7% (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.45â0.97). This coincided with a larger reduction in overall preterm deliveries among black women (16.2% to 12.8%) vs. white women (12.3% to 11.2%) (P interaction=0.038). By 2013, the incidence of preterm deliveries had decreased for both black (12.1%) and white women (11.4%) and the difference was no longer statistically significant (P=0.7). Conclusion We found a reduction in preterm deliveries after a policy targeted at reducing elective early-term deliveries in 2009 that coincided with reductions in the proportion of provider-initiated preterm deliveries, especially among black women.

Limited evidence suggests potential relationships between maternal sleep or vital exhaustion and preterm birth, yet the literature is generally inconclusive. We examined the relationship between maternal sleep duration and vital exhaustion in the first six months of pregnancy and spontaneous (non-medically indicated) preterm birth among 479 Peruvian women who delivered a preterm singleton infant (<37 weeks gestation) and 480 term controls who delivered a singleton infant at term (â¥37 weeks gestation). Maternal nightly sleep and reports of vital exhaustion were ascertained through in-person interviews. Spontaneous preterm birth cases were further categorized as those following either spontaneous preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. In addition, cases were categorized as very (<32 weeks), moderate (32-33 weeks), and late (34-â<37 weeks) preterm birth for additional analyses. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After adjusting for confounders, we found that short sleep duration (â¤6 hours) was significantly associated with preterm birth (aOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.11-2.19) compared to 7-8 hours of sleep. Vital exhaustion was also associated with increased odds of preterm birth (aOR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.79-3.23) compared to no exhaustion (Ptrend <0.001). These associations remained significant for spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. We also found evidence of joint effects of sleep duration and vital exhaustion on the odds of spontaneous preterm birth. The results of this case-control study suggest maternal sleep duration, particularly short sleep duration, and vital exhaustion may be risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. These findings call for increased clinical attention to\n\nCOMPLEMENT ACTIVATION FRAGMENT Bb IN EARLY PREGNANCY AND SPONTANEOUS PRETERM BIRTH\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLYNCH, ANNE M.; GIBBS, RONALD S.; MURPHY, JAMES R.; BYERS, TIM; NEVILLE, MARGARET C.; GICLAS, PATRICIA C.; SALMON, JANE E.; VAN HECKE, TRISHA M; MICHAEL HOLERS, V.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nObjective To determine if an elevated level of the complement activation fragment Bb in early pregnancy was associated with spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) at less than 34 weeks gestation or SPTB between 34 and 37 weeks gestation (late SPTB). Study Design Prospective study of 784 women enrolled at < 20 weeks gestation. Results Following exclusions, 13 women (1.7%) had a SPTB at less than 34 weeks gestation and 25 (3.2%) a SPTB between 34 and 37 weeks gestation. Women with Bb in the top quartile were 4.7 times more likely to have an SPTB less than 34 weeks gestation as compared with women who had levels of Bb in the lower three quartiles (95% CI 1.5 to 14, P = 0.003). There was no association between Bb and late SPTB (RR= 0.8, 95% CI = 0.3 to 2). Conclusions A significant relationship was found between an elevated Bb in early pregnancy and SPTB < 34 weeks gestation. These results suggest that inflammatory events in early pregnancy are part of the pathogenic mechanisms of this condition.

This was a prospective study of 784 women enrolled at less than 20 weeks' gestation. Following exclusions, 13 women (1.7%) had a SPTB at less than 34 weeks' gestation and 25 (3.2%) a SPTB between 34 and 37 weeks' gestation. Women with Bb in the top quartile were 4.7 times more likely to have an SPTB less than 34 weeks' gestation as compared with women who had levels of Bb in the lower 3 quartiles (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-14, P = .003). There was no association between Bb and late SPTB (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.3-2). A significant relationship was found between an elevated Bb in early pregnancy and SPTB less than 34 weeks' gestation.

We identified antenatal PTSD status and spontaneous preterm delivery in a retrospective cohort of 16,334 deliveries covered by the Veterans Health Administration from 2000 to 2012. We divided mothers with PTSD into those with diagnoses present the year before delivery (active PTSD) and those only with earlier diagnoses (historical PTSD). We identified spontaneous preterm birth and potential confounders including age, race, military deployment, twins, hypertension, substance use, depression, and results of military sexual trauma screening and then performed multivariate regression to estimate adjusted odds ratio (OR) of spontaneous preterm delivery as a function of PTSD status. Of 16,334 births, 3,049 (19%) were to mothers with PTSD diagnoses, of whom 1,921 (12%) had active PTSD. Spontaneous preterm delivery was higher in those with active PTSD (9.2%, n=176) than those with historical (8.0%, n=90) or no PTSD (7.4%, n=982) before adjustment (P=.02). The association between PTSD and preterm birth persisted, when adjusting for covariates, only in those with active PTSD (adjusted OR 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-1.61). Analyses adjusting for comorbid psychiatric and medical diagnoses revealed the association with active PTSD to be robust. In this cohort, containing an unprecedented number of PTSD-affected pregnancies, mothers with active PTSD were significantly more likely to suffer spontaneous preterm birth with an attributable two excess preterm births per 100 deliveries (95% CI 1-4). Posttraumatic stress disorder's health effects may extend, through birth outcomes, into the next generation.\n\nTreatment of abnormal vaginal flora in early pregnancy with clindamycin for the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: a systematic review and metaanalysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLamont, Ronald F.; Nhan-Chang, Chia-Ling; Sobel, Jack D.; Workowski, Kimberly; Conde-Agudelo, Agustin; Romero, Roberto\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine whether the administration of clindamycin to women with abnormal vaginal flora at <22 weeks of gestation reduces the risk of preterm birth and late miscarriage. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials of the early administration of clindamycin to women with abnormal vaginal flora at <22 weeks of gestation. Five trials that comprised 2346 women were included. Clindamycin that was administered at <22 weeks of gestation was associated with a significantly reduced risk of preterm birth at <37 weeks of gestation and late miscarriage. There were no overall differences in the risk of preterm birth at <33 weeks of gestation, low birthweight, very low birthweight, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, stillbirth, peripartum infection, and adverse effects. Clindamycin in early pregnancy in women with abnormal vaginal flora reduces the risk of spontaneous preterm birth at <37 weeks of gestation and late miscarriage. There is evidence to justify further randomized controlled trials of clindamycin for the prevention of preterm birth. However, a deeper understanding of the vaginal microbiome, mucosal immunity, and the biology of bacterial vaginosis will be needed to inform the design of such trials.

We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase. Data extracted from the articles and used for analysis included HPV prevalence, pregnancy outcome, geographical location, investigated tissue types, and HPV detection methods. The overall HPV prevalence in normal full-term pregnancies was found to be 17.5% (95% CI; 17.3â17.7) for cervix, 8.3% (95% CI; 7.6â9.1) for placental tissue, 5.7% (95% CI; 5.1â6.3) for amniotic fluid, and 10.9% (95% CI; 10.1â11.7) for umbilical cord blood. Summary estimates for HPV prevalence of spontaneous abortions and spontaneous preterm deliveries, in cervix (spontaneous abortions: 24.5%, and preterm deliveries: 47%, resp.) and placenta (spontaneous abortions: 24.9%, and preterm deliveries: 50%, resp.), were identified to be higher compared to normal full-term pregnancies (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001). Great variation in HPV prevalence was observed between study populations of different geographical locations. This review demonstrates an association between spontaneous abortion, spontaneous preterm delivery, and the presence of HPV in both the cervix and the placenta. However, a reliable conclusion is difficult to draw due to the limited number of studies conducted on material from pregnancies with adverse outcome and the risk of residual confounding.

Current knowledge on potential influences of probiotics in food on pregnancy complications caused by microbes is limited. Objective: We hypothesized that intake of food with probiotics might reduce pregnancy complications caused by pathogenic microorganisms and, through this, reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. Design: This study was performed in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort on the basis of answers to a food-frequency questionnaire. We studied intake of milk-based products containing probiotic lactobacilli and spontaneous preterm delivery by using a prospective cohort study design (n = 950 cases and 17,938 controls) for the pregnancy outcome of spontaneous preterm delivery (<37 gestational weeks). Analyses were adjusted for the covariates of parity, maternal educational level, and physical activity. Results: Pregnancies that resulted in spontaneous preterm delivery were associated with any intake of milk-based probiotic products in an adjusted model [odds ratio (OR): 0.857; 95% CI: 0.741, 0.992]. By categorizing intake into none, low, and high intakes of the milk-based probiotic products, a significant association was observed for high intake (OR: 0.820; 95% CI: 0.681, 0.986). Conclusion: Women who reported habitual intake of probiotic dairy products had a reduced risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.

The dose is not based on pharmacologic considerations. A therapeutic concentration has not been determined hampering any attempt to optimize treatment. This study evaluated the relationship between 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate plasma concentrations and the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with singleton gestation. A single blood sample was obtained between 25 and 28 weeks' gestation from 315 women with a spontaneous preterm birth who participated in a placebo-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical trial evaluating the benefit of omega-3 supplementation in reducing preterm birth. All women in the parent study received 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate and 434 received omega-3 supplementation and 418 received a placebo. Plasma from 315 consenting women was analyzed for 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate concentration. There were no differences between placebo and omega-3 supplemented groups in demographic variables, outcomes or in mean 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate concentration. Plasma concentrations of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate ranged from 3.7-56 ng/mL. Women with plasma concentrations of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate in the lowest quartile had a significantly higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth (PÂ = .03) and delivered at significantly earlier gestational ages (PÂ = .002) than did women in the second to fourth quartiles. The lowest preterm birth rates were seen when median 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate concentrations exceeded 6.4 ng/mL. Low plasma 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate concentration is associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. This finding validates efficacy of this treatment but suggests that additional studies are needed to determine the optimal dosage. Copyright Â© 2014 Mosby, Inc.

We examined risk factors for spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth, with a focus on socioeconomic position and clinical risk factors, in order to explain the observed inconsistency. Methods We carried out a retrospective population-based cohort study of all singleton deliveries in Nova Scotia from 1988 to 2003. Data were obtained from the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and the federal income tax T1 Family Files. Separate logistic models were used to quantify the association between socioeconomic position, clinical risk factors and spontaneous preterm birth and iatrogenic preterm birth. Results The study population included 132,714 singleton deliveries and the rate of preterm birth was 5.5%. Preterm birth rates were significantly higher among the women in the lowest (versus the highest) family income group for spontaneous (rate ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.25) but not iatrogenic preterm birth (rate ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.75, 1.19). Adjustment for maternal characteristics attenuated the family income-spontaneous preterm birth relationship but strengthened the relationship with iatrogenic preterm birth. Clinical risk factors such as hypertension were differentially associated with spontaneous (rate ratio 3.92, 95% CI 3.47, 4.44) and iatrogenic preterm (rate ratio 14.1, 95% CI 11.4, 17.4) but factors such as diabetes mellitus were not (rate ratio 4.38, 95% CI 3.21, 5.99 for spontaneous and 4.02, 95% CI 2.07, 7.80 for iatrogenic preterm birth). Conclusions Socioeconomic position and clinical risk factors have different effects on spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm. Recent temporal increases in iatrogenic preterm birth appear to be responsible for the inconsistent relationship between socioeconomic position and preterm birth.

We carried out a retrospective population-based cohort study of all singleton deliveries in Nova Scotia from 1988 to 2003. Data were obtained from the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and the federal income tax T1 Family Files. Separate logistic models were used to quantify the association between socioeconomic position, clinical risk factors and spontaneous preterm birth and iatrogenic preterm birth. The study population included 132,714 singleton deliveries and the rate of preterm birth was 5.5%. Preterm birth rates were significantly higher among the women in the lowest (versus the highest) family income group for spontaneous (rate ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.25) but not iatrogenic preterm birth (rate ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.75, 1.19). Adjustment for maternal characteristics attenuated the family income-spontaneous preterm birth relationship but strengthened the relationship with iatrogenic preterm birth. Clinical risk factors such as hypertension were differentially associated with spontaneous (rate ratio 3.92, 95% CI 3.47, 4.44) and iatrogenic preterm (rate ratio 14.1, 95% CI 11.4, 17.4) but factors such as diabetes mellitus were not (rate ratio 4.38, 95% CI 3.21, 5.99 for spontaneous and 4.02, 95% CI 2.07, 7.80 for iatrogenic preterm birth). Socioeconomic position and clinical risk factors have different effects on spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm. Recent temporal increases in iatrogenic preterm birth appear to be responsible for the inconsistent relationship between socioeconomic position and preterm birth.\n\nIdentification and functional analysis of microRNA in myometrium tissue from spontaneous preterm labor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTang, Yao; Ji, Hongjing; Liu, Haiyan; Gu, Weirong; Li, Xiaotian; Peng, Ting\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSpontaneous preterm labor is an important complication in perinatology characterized by early onset myometrium contractions leading to labor at preterm. However, the exact mechanism that maintain uterine quiescence and promote increased uterine contractility during labor were incompletely defined. MicroRNAs is a class of short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding the 3â untranslated region of target mRNAs and play an important role in biological process and cellular functions. We hypothesized we could find differentially expressed microRNAs in the myometrium of women in spontaneous preterm labor. Thus, a microarray analysis of miRNAs of preterm myometrium was performed. 18 out of the 2006 detected microRNAs were found to be significantly dysregulated in myometrium in labor verse not in labor at preterm. Biological validation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirms us a consistence rate of 83.3% (5 out of 6) with microarray analysis. The target genes for validated microRNAs were predicted by three algorithms (PicTar, TargetScan, and miRanda). Most of the potential targets of the miRNAs were relevant to positive regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy, reduction of cytosolic calcium ion concentration and relaxation of cardiac muscle as well as prostate cancer, adherents junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton and regulation and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption. Our result illustrates a characteristic microRNA profile in myometrium tissues and provides a new understanding of the process involved in spontaneous preterm labor.

Although several medical/social factors have been clearly identified, over 50% of cases are unknown or unclear; however, psychopathological components emerge as potentially important risk factors. To determine the relationship between the presence of stress during pregnancy and spontaneous preterm birth. Through a study of cases and controls in a level III hospital, with a sample of 360 patients during the period from March to November of 2013, where sociodemographic characteristics were collected. In addition, they were applied scales social adjustment, coping strategies and social support. Logistic regression models were developed; psychological, biological and social. Based on the significant variables in each of these generated a final one. The final model was found that stress during pregnancy increases the odds of spontaneous preterm birth 1.91 times (adjusted OR=2.91; 95%CI, 1.67-5.08; P<.05). Other significant variables were: history of preterm delivery, unplanned pregnancy, no emotional support, rural residence, inadequate prenatal care and non-stable partner. The findings support the hypothesis that stress during pregnancy is associated with spontaneous preterm delivery. Copyright Â© 2015 AsociaciÃ³n Colombiana de PsiquiatrÃ­a.

Searches were run on the following databases up to September 2005 inclusive: MEDLINE, EMBASE, DARE, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register) and MEDION. We also contacted experts including the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group and checked reference lists of review articles and papers that were eligible for inclusion. Two series of systematic reviews were performed: (1) accuracy of tests for the prediction of spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic women in early pregnancy and in women symptomatic with threatened preterm labour in later pregnancy; (2) effectiveness of interventions with potential to reduce cases of spontaneous preterm birth in asymptomatic women in early pregnancy and to reduce spontaneous preterm birth or improve neonatal outcome in women with a viable pregnancy symptomatic of threatened preterm labour. For the health economic evaluation, a model-based analysis incorporated the combined effect of tests and treatments and their cost-effectiveness. Of the 22 tests reviewed for accuracy, the quality of studies and accuracy of tests was generally poor. Only a few tests had LR+ > 5. In asymptomatic women these were ultrasonographic cervical length measurement and cervicovaginal prolactin and fetal fibronectin screening for predicting spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks. In this group, tests with LR- < 0.2 were detection of uterine contraction by home uterine monitoring and amniotic fluid C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement. In symptomatic women with threatened preterm labour, tests with LR+ > 5 were absence of fetal breathing movements, cervical length and funnelling, amniotic fluid interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum CRP for predicting birth within 2-7 days of testing, and matrix metalloprotease-9, amniotic fluid IL-6, cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin and cervicovaginal human chorionic gonadotrophin\n\nMaternal Circulating Lipid Profile during Early Pregnancy: Racial/Ethnic Differences and Association with Spontaneous Preterm Delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Xinhua; Scholl, Theresa O; Stein, Thomas P; Steer, Robert A; Williams, Keith P\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPrior reports on the association between altered maternal serum lipid levels with preterm delivery are inconsistent. Ethnic differences in serum lipids during pregnancy and their relation to preterm delivery have not been studied. We examined the relationships of six maternal lipids during early pregnancy with the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD). The design represents a case-control study nested within a large prospective, multiethnic cohort of young, generally healthy pregnant women. SPTD cases ( n = 183) and controls who delivered at term ( n = 376) were included. SPTD is defined as delivery at <37 completed weeks of gestation without indicated conditions. We found that African-American women had significantly increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), and lower triglyceride (TG) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels compared to Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasians combined. Elevated HDL-C and apoA1 concentrations were significantly associated with an increased odds of SPTD after controlling for potential confounding factors. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 1.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15, 3.20) for the highest quartile of HDL-C relative to the lowest quartile, and for apoA1 the AOR was 1.94 (95% CI 1.16, 3.24). When controlling for ethnicity, the results remained comparable. These data suggest that pregnant African-American women had a more favorable lipid profile suggestive of a reduction in cardiovascular risk. Despite this, increased HDL-C and apoA1 were both found to be associated with SPTD.\n\nCell-free fetal DNA and spontaneous preterm birth\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDavidson, Donald J; Norman, Jane E\n\n2018-01-01\n\nInflammation is known to play a key role in preterm and term parturition. Cell-free fetal DNA (cff-DNA) is present in the maternal circulation and increases with gestational age and some pregnancy complications (e.g. preterm birth, preeclampsia). Microbial DNA and adult cell-free DNA can be pro-inflammatory through DNA-sensing mechanisms such as Toll-like receptor 9 and the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway. However, the pro-inflammatory properties of cff-DNA, and the possible effects of this on pregnancy and parturition are unknown. Clinical studies have quantified cff-DNA levels in the maternal circulation in women who deliver preterm and women who deliver at term and show an association between preterm labor and higher cff-DNA levels in the 2nd, 3rd trimester and at onset of preterm birth symptoms. Together with potential pro-inflammatory properties of cff-DNA, this rise suggests a potential mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth. In this review, we discuss the evidence linking cff-DNA to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth, obtained from preclinical and clinical studies.

We hypothesized that decidual macrophages undergo a proinflammatory (M1) polarization during spontaneous preterm labor and that PPARÎ³ activation via rosiglitazone (RSG) would attenuate the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response, preventing preterm birth. In this study, we show that: 1) decidual macrophages undergo an M1-like polarization during spontaneous term and preterm labor; 2) anti-inflammatory (M2)-like macrophages are more abundant than M1-like macrophages in decidual tissue; 3) decidual M2-like macrophages are reduced in preterm pregnancies compared with term pregnancies, regardless of the presence of labor; 4) decidual macrophages express high levels of TNF and IL-12 but low levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) during spontaneous preterm labor; 5) decidual macrophages from women who underwent spontaneous preterm labor display plasticity by M1âM2 polarization in vitro; 6) incubation with RSG reduces the expression of TNF and IL-12 in decidual macrophages from women who underwent spontaneous preterm labor; and 7) treatment with RSG reduces the rate of LPS-induced preterm birth and improves neonatal outcomes by reducing the systemic proinflammatory response and downregulating mRNA and protein expression of NF-ÎºB, TNF, and IL-10 in decidual and myometrial macrophages in C57BL/6J mice. In summary, we demonstrated that decidual M1-like macrophages are associated with spontaneous preterm labor and that PPARÎ³ activation via RSG can attenuate the macrophage-mediated proinflammatory response, preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes. These findings suggest that the PPARÎ³ pathway is a new molecular target for future preventative strategies for spontaneous preterm labor/birth.

Preterm infants with a birth weight of <1500â¯g were recruited. We measured spontaneous antigravity limbs movements by 3D motion capture system at 3â¯months corrected age. Gross motor developmental outcomes at 6 and 12â¯months corrected age were evaluated using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS). Statistical analysis was carried out by canonical correlation analysis. Eighteen preterm infants were included. In the 6â¯months corrected age analysis, spontaneous movement had a major effect on Prone and Sitting at 6â¯months corrected age of AIMS. In the 12â¯months corrected age analysis, spontaneous movement had a major effect on Sitting and Standing at 12â¯months corrected age of AIMS. In preterm infants, better antigravity spontaneous movements at 3â¯months corrected age were significantly correlated with better gross motor development at 6 or 12â¯months corrected age.

A single previous pregnancy loss (termination or miscarriage) managed by cervical dilatation and curettage is associated with a greater risk of SpPTB. Miscarriage affects â¼20% of pregnancies and as many as a further 20% of pregnancies undergo termination. We utilized data from 5575 healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies recruited to the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study, a prospective cohort study performed between November 2004 and January 2011. The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth (defined as spontaneous preterm labour or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) resulting in preterm birth <37 weeks' gestation). Secondary outcomes included PPROM, small for gestational age, birthweight, pre-eclampsia and placental abruption. Women with previous pregnancy loss (miscarriage or termination) were compared with those with no previous pregnancy loss. There were 4331 (78%) women who had no previous pregnancy loss, 974 (17.5%) who had one early previous pregnancy loss, 249 (4.5%) who had two and 21 (0.5%) who had three or four losses. Women with two to four previous losses, but not those with a single loss, had an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (adjusted OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.55, 2.90) and/or placental abruption (adjusted OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.36, 3.89) compared with those with no previous pregnancy. A single previous miscarriage or termination of pregnancy where the management involved cervical dilatation and curettage was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth (adjusted OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.08, 2.50; 6% absolute risk and adjusted OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.35, 2.48; 7% absolute risk, respectively) compared with those with no previous pregnancy losses.

However, little is known about the melodic features of spontaneous cries in preterm infants, who have a higher risk of later language-related problems. Thus, the present study investigated how preterm birth influenced melodic features of spontaneous crying at term-equivalent age as well as how these melodic features related to language outcomes at 18 months of corrected age in preterm and term infants. At term, moderate-to-late preterm (MLP) infants showed spontaneous cries with significantly higher F 0 variation and melody complexity than term infants, while there were no significant differences between very preterm (VP) and term infants. Furthermore, larger F 0 variation within cry series at term was significantly related to better language and cognitive outcomes, particularly expressive language skills, at 18 months. On the other hand, no other melodic features at term predicted any developmental outcomes at 18 months. The present results suggest that the additional postnatal vocal experience of MLP preterm infants increased F 0 variation and the complexity of spontaneous cries at term. Additionally, the increases in F 0 variation may partly reflect the development of voluntary vocal control, which, in turn, contributes to expressive language in infancy.\n\nRandomized controlled trial of probiotics for the prevention of spontaneous preterm delivery associated with intrauterine infection: study protocol\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Spontaneous preterm deliveries that occur before the 34th week of gestation, and particularly before the 32nd week of gestation, have been strongly associated to intrauterine infection, ascending from vagina, and represent the largest portion of neonatal deaths and neurological problems. Bacterial vaginosis, characterized by a diminished or absent flora of lactobacilli and increased colonization of several anaerobic or facultative microorganisms, increases two times the risk of preterm delivery before the 34th week. Trials of antibiotics failed to show efficacy and effectiveness against spontaneous preterm birth related to bacterial vaginosis. Some studies indicate benefit from selected probiotics to treat genitourinary infections, including bacterial vaginosis. Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the early administration of selected probiotics to pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis/intermediate degree infection to reduce the occurrence of spontaneous preterm delivery and related neonatal mortality and morbidity. Methods/Design Women attending public prenatal care services in Rio de Janeiro will be screened to select asymptomatic pregnant women, less than 20 weeks' gestation, with no indication of elective preterm delivery. Those with vaginal pH > = 4.5 and a Nugent score between 4 and 10 (intermediate degree infection or bacterial vaginosis) will be randomized to either the placebo or the intervention group, after written informed consent. Intervention consists in the use of probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14, 2 capsules a day, each capsule containing more than one million bacilli of each strain, for 6-12 weeks, up to the 24th-25th wk of gestation. Ancillary analyses include quantification of selected cervicovaginal cytokines and genotyping of selected polymorphisms. The randomization process is stratified for history of preterm delivery and blocked. Allocation\n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics for spontaneous preterm labour: the ORACLE II randomised trial. ORACLE Collaborative Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nKenyon, S L; Taylor, D J; Tarnow-Mordi, W\n\n2001-03-31\n\nPreterm birth after spontaneous preterm labour is associated with death, neonatal disease, and long-term disability. Previous small trials of antibiotics for spontaneous preterm labour have reported inconclusive results. We did a randomised multicentre trial to resolve this issue. 6295 women in spontaneous preterm labour with intact membranes and without evidence of clinical infection were randomly assigned 250 mg erythromycin (n=1611), 325 mg co-amoxiclav (250 mg amoxicillin and 125 mg clavulanic acid; n=1550), both (n=1565), or placebo (n=1569) four times daily for 10 days or until delivery, whichever occurred earlier. The primary outcome measure was a composite of neonatal death, chronic lung disease, or major cerebral abnormality on ultrasonography before discharge from hospital. Analysis was by intention to treat. None of the trial antibiotics was associated with a lower rate of the composite primary outcome than placebo (erythromycin 90 [5.6%], co-amoxiclav 76 [5.0%], both antibiotics 91 [5.9%], vs placebo 78 [5.0%]). However, antibiotic prescription was associated with a lower occurrence of maternal infection. This trial provides evidence that antibiotics should not be routinely prescribed for women in spontaneous preterm labour without evidence of clinical infection.\n\nUmbilical cord CD71+ erythroid cells are reduced in neonates born to women in spontaneous preterm labor.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomez-Lopez, Nardhy; Romero, Roberto; Xu, Yi; Miller, Derek; Unkel, Ronald; C MacKenzie, Tippi; Frascoli, Michela; Hassan, Sonia S\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPreterm neonates are highly susceptible to infection. Neonatal host defense against infection seems to be maintained by the temporal presence of immunosuppressive CD71+ erythroid cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether umbilical cord CD71+ erythroid cells are reduced in neonates born to women who undergo spontaneous preterm labor/birth. Umbilical cord blood samples (n=155) were collected from neonates born to women who delivered preterm with (n=39) and without (n=12) spontaneous labor or at term with (n=82) and without (n=22) spontaneous labor. Time-matched maternal peripheral blood samples were also included (n=111). Mononuclear cells were isolated from these samples, and CD71+ erythroid cells were identified and quantified as CD3-CD235a+CD71+ cells by flow cytometry. (i) The proportion of CD71+ erythroid cells was 50-fold higher in cord blood than in maternal blood; (ii) a reduced number and frequency of umbilical cord CD71+ erythroid cells were found in neonates born to women who underwent spontaneous preterm labor compared to those born to women who delivered preterm without labor; (iii) umbilical cord CD71+ erythroid cells were fewer in neonates born to term pregnancies, regardless of the process of labor, than in those born to women who delivered preterm without labor; and (iv) no differences were seen in umbilical cord CD71+ erythroid cells between neonates born to women who underwent spontaneous preterm labor and those born to women who delivered at term with labor. Umbilical cord CD71+ erythroid cells are reduced in neonates born to women who had undergone spontaneous preterm labor. Published 2016.

High concentrations of FBb in maternal blood, as early as the first trimester, are associated with subsequent spontaneous preterm delivery <34 weeks of gestation. The study aim was to determine whether spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes (PTL), intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) or labor at term are associated with alterations in circulating maternal FBb concentrations. Method of Study This cross-sectional study included women in the following groups: 1) non-pregnant (n=40); 2) normal pregnancy (gestational age range 20-36 6/7 weeks, n=63); 2) women at term not in labor (n=70); 3) women at term in spontaneous labor (n=59); 4) patients with an episode of PTL who delivered at term (n=62); 5) PTL without IAI who delivered preterm (n=30); and 6) PTL with IAI who delivered preterm (n=67). Maternal plasma FBb concentrations were determined by ELISA. Results 1) Among patients with PTL, those who had a preterm delivery either with IAI (1.21 Î¼g/ml, IQR 0.77-2.16) or without IAI (1.13 Î¼g/ml, IQR 0.92-2.08;) had a higher median maternal plasma FBb concentration than those who delivered at term (0.86 Î¼g/ml, IQR 0.64-1.57; p=0.007 and p=0.026, respectively); 2) there was no difference in the median plasma FBb concentration between patients with and without IAI who delivered preterm (p=0.9); 3) in contrast, spontaneous labor at term was not associated with a significant change in the maternal plasma FBb concentration (p=0.8); 4) maternal plasma concentration of FBb did not differ significantly between normal pregnant women and the non-pregnant controls (p=0.8) and were not correlated with advancing gestational age (r â0.28, p=0.8). Conclusions 1) Preterm parturition is associated with activation of the alternative complement pathway in maternal circulation; 2) such activation is not detectable in spontaneous labor at term\n\nJerky spontaneous movements at term age in preterm infants who later developed cerebral palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanemaru, Nao; Watanabe, Hama; Kihara, Hideki; Nakano, Hisako; Nakamura, Tomohiko; Nakano, Junji; Taga, Gentaro; Konishi, Yukuo\n\n2014-08-01\n\nAssessment of spontaneous movements in infants has been a powerful predictor of cerebral palsy (CP). Recent advancements on computer-based video analysis can provide detailed information about the properties of spontaneous movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between spontaneous movements of the 4 limbs at term age and the development of CP at 3 years of age by using a computer-based video analysis system. We analyzed video recordings of spontaneous movements at 36-44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) for 145 preterm infants who were born preterm (22-36 weeks PMA with birthweights of 460-1498g). Sixteen of the infants developed CP by 3 years of age, while 129 developed normally. We compared 6 movement indices calculated from 2-dimensional trajectories of all limbs between the 2 groups. We found that the indices of jerkiness were higher in the CP group than in the normal group (p<0.1 for arms and p<0.01 for legs). No decline was observed in the average velocity and number of movement units in the CP group compared with to the normal group. Jerkiness of spontaneous movements at term age provides additional information for predicting CP in infants born preterm. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the influence of food with antimicrobial and prebiotic components on the risk of spontaneous PTD. A literature search identified microbes associated with spontaneous PTD. Subsequently, 2 main food types (alliums and dried fruits) were identified to contain antimicrobial components that affect the microbes associated with spontaneous PTD; they also contained dietary fibers recognized as prebiotics. We investigated intake in 18,888 women in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa), of whom 950 (5%) underwent spontaneous PTD (<37 gestational weeks). Alliums (garlic, onion, leek, and spring onion) [OR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.94), P = 0.005] and dried fruits (raisins, apricots, prunes, figs, and dates) [OR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.94); P = 0.005] were associated with a decreased risk of spontaneous PTD. Intake of alliums was related to a more pronounced risk reduction in early spontaneous PTD (gestational weeks 28â31) [OR: 0.39 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.80)]. The strongest association in this group was with garlic [OR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.25â0.89)], followed by cooked onions. Intake of dried fruits showed an association with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) [OR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.95)]; the strongest association in this group was with raisins [OR: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.92)]. The strongest association with PPROM in the allium group was with garlic [OR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.97)]. In conclusion, intake of food with antimicrobial and prebiotic compounds may be of importance to reduce the risk of spontaneous PTD. In particular, garlic was associated with overall lower risk of spontaneous PTD. Dried fruits, especially raisins, were associated with reduced risk of PPROM.

Intramuscular 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate injections reduce the risk of recurrent prematurity by approximately one third. Unfortunately, prophylactic 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not always effective, and one-third of high-risk women will have a recurrent preterm birth, despite 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate therapy. The reasons for this variability in response are unknown. Previous investigators have examined the influence of a variety of factors on 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate response but have analyzed data that used a fixed outcome of term delivery to define progesterone response. We hypothesized that the demographics, history, and pregnancy course among women who deliver at a similar gestational age with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth prevention differs when compared with those women who deliver later with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate and that these associations could be refined by the use of a contemporary definition of 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate \"responder.\" This was a planned secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study of women with â¥1 previous documented singleton spontaneous preterm birth at <37 weeks gestation. Data were collected at 3 prespecified gestational age epochs during pregnancy. All women who were included in this analysis received 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate during the studied pregnancy. We classified women as a 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate responder or nonresponder by calculating the difference in delivery gestational age between the 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate-treated pregnancy and her earliest spontaneous preterm birth. Responders were defined as those with pregnancy that extended â¥3 weeks later with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate, compared with the delivery\n\nPresentation to delivery interval in women with early preterm delivery presenting with preterm labor: the effect of gestational age.\n\nPubMed\n\nAshwal, Eran; Shinar, Shiri; Wertheimer, Avital; Reina, Luciena; Miremberg, Hadas; Aviram, Amir; Yogev, Yariv; Hiersch, Liran\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo evaluate the association between gestational age at presentation and interval to delivery in women with early spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD). A retrospective cohort study of women who presented with threatened preterm labor (tPTL) and intact membranes and had a spontaneous PTD <34 weeks in a university-affiliated hospital (2009-2015). The interval from presentation to delivery was compared between different gestational age subgroups. Of 67 550 deliveries during the study period, 252 met inclusion criteria. This cohort was divided to three gestational age subgroups at presentation: 24-28 6/7 weeks (nâ=â83), 29-31 6/7 weeks (nâ=â61) and 32-33 6/7 weeks (nâ=â108). Median time from presentation to delivery was 24.5âh. An inverse relation was observed between gestational age at presentation and admission-delivery interval (group A: 74.7âh, group B: 21.0âh, group C: 14.0âh, pâ<â0.001). Gestational age at presentation is inversely related to admission-delivery interval in women with tPTL and intact membranes.\n\nResidential Agricultural Pesticide Exposures and Risks of Spontaneous Preterm Birth.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaw, Gary M; Yang, Wei; Roberts, Eric M; Kegley, Susan E; Stevenson, David K; Carmichael, Suzan L; English, Paul B\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPesticides exposures are aspects of the human exposome that have not been sufficiently studied for their contribution to risk for preterm birth. We investigated risks of spontaneous preterm birth from potential residential exposures to 543 individual chemicals and 69 physicochemical groupings that were applied in the San Joaquin Valley of California during the study period, 1998-2011. The study population was derived from birth certificate data linked with Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development maternal and infant hospital discharge data. After exclusions, the analytic study base included 197,461 term control births and 27,913 preterm case births. Preterm cases were more narrowly defined as 20-23 weeks (n = 515), 24-27 weeks (n = 1,792), 28-31 weeks (n = 3,098), or 32-36 weeks (n = 22,508). The frequency of any (versus none) pesticide exposure was uniformly lower in each preterm case group relative to the frequency in term controls, irrespective of gestational month of exposure. All odds ratios were below 1.0 for these any versus no exposure comparisons. The majority of odds ratios were below 1.0, many of them statistically precise, for preterm birth and exposures to specific chemical groups or chemicals. This study showed a general lack of increased risk of preterm birth associated with a range of agriculture pesticide exposures near women's residences.\n\nLow dose aspirin in the prevention of recurrent spontaneous preterm labour - the APRIL study: a multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nVisser, Laura; de Boer, Marjon A; de Groot, Christianne J M; Nijman, Tobias A J; Hemels, Marieke A C; Bloemenkamp, Kitty W M; Bosmans, Judith E; Kok, Marjolein; van Laar, Judith O; Sueters, Marieke; Scheepers, Hubertina; van Drongelen, Joris; Franssen, Maureen T M; Sikkema, J Marko; Duvekot, Hans J J; Bekker, Mireille N; van der Post, Joris A M; Naaktgeboren, Christiana; Mol, Ben W J; Oudijk, Martijn A\n\n2017-07-14\n\nPreterm birth (birth before 37Â weeks of gestation) is a major problem in obstetrics and affects an estimated 15 million pregnancies worldwide annually. A history of previous preterm birth is the strongest risk factor for preterm birth, and recurrent spontaneous preterm birth affects more than 2.5 million pregnancies each year. A recent meta-analysis showed possible benefits of the use of low dose aspirin in the prevention of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. We will assess the (cost-)effectiveness of low dose aspirin in comparison with placebo in the prevention of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth in a randomized clinical trial. Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous preterm birth in a singleton pregnancy (22-37 weeks of gestation) will be asked to participate in a multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial. Women will be randomized to low dose aspirin (80Â mg once daily) or placebo, initiated from 8 to 16 weeks up to maximal 36Â weeks of gestation. The primary outcome measure will be preterm birth, defined as birth at a gestational age (GA)â<â37Â weeks. Secondary outcomes will be a composite of adverse neonatal outcome and maternal outcomes, including subgroups of prematurity, as well as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and costs from a healthcare perspective. Preterm birth will be analyzed as a group, as well as separately for spontaneous or indicated onset. Analysis will be performed by intention to treat. In total, 406 pregnant women have to be randomized to show a reduction of 35% in preterm birth from 36 to 23%. If aspirin is effective in preventing preterm birth, we expect that there will be cost savings, because of the low costs of aspirin. To evaluate this, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed comparing preventive treatment with aspirin with placebo. This trial will provide evidence as to whether or not low dose aspirin is (cost-) effective in reducing recurrence of spontaneous\n\nPredictive performance of PAMG-1 vs fFN test for risk of spontaneous preterm birth in symptomatic women attending an emergency obstetric unit: retrospective cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMelchor, J C; Navas, H; Marcos, M; Iza, A; De Diego, M; Rando, D; Melchor, I; Burgos, J\n\n2018-05-01\n\nTo compare the performance of the placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) and fetal fibronectin (fFN) tests for the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery in patients presenting to an emergency obstetric unit with threatened preterm labor, by conducting a retrospective audit of patient medical records from separate 1-year periods during which either fFN or PAMG-1 was used as the standard-of-care biochemical test. This was a retrospective cohort study based on chart review of electronic medical records of women with threatened preterm labor presenting at a level-III maternity hospital over two different periods: (1) the 'baseline' period (year 2012), during which the qualitative fFN test with a cut-off of 50âng/mL was used as the standard-of-care biochemical test for the risk assessment of preterm delivery, and (2) the 'comparative' period (year 2016), during which the PAMG-1 test with a cut-off of 1âng/mL was used as the standard-of-care biomarker test. Patients with a singleton pregnancy between 24â+â0 and 34â+â6 weeks' gestation with symptoms of early preterm labor, clinically intact membranes and cervical dilatation <â3âcm, who did not have a medically indicated preterm delivery within 14 days of testing, were selected for chart review and included in the analysis. Key parameters used for the analysis were biochemical test results, time of testing and time of delivery. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) for the prediction of spontaneous preterm delivery â¤â7 and â¤â14 days of presentation were calculated for the PAMG-1 and fFN tests. Four hundred and twenty patients were identified as having presented with threatened preterm labor during the baseline period, of whom 378 (90.0%) met the eligibility criteria. Of these, 38 (10.1%) were fFN positive and 10 (2.6%) had spontaneous preterm delivery â¤â7 days of presentation\n\nHigh-risk and low-risk human papilloma virus in association to spontaneous preterm labor: a case-control study in a tertiary center, Egypt.\n\nPubMed\n\nMosbah, Alaa; Barakat, Rafik; Nabiel, Yasmin; Barakat, Ghada\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis study aimed to detect the correlation between human papillomavirus (HPV) and spontaneous preterm labor in Egyptian women and its association to the human papilloma viral load and MPP2 gene expression. We performed an observational comparative case-control study in Department of Obstetric and Gynecology, Mansoura University Hospitals over women presented with spontaneous preterm labor, besides females admitted for giving birth at full term to detect conserved sequence in HPV-L1 gene (GP5/GP6) followed by genotype detection of high- and low-risk HPVs with quantification of the viral load and the MMP2 gene expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of HPV was 18.1% in preterm females, but only 4% in full-term women (pÂ valueâ=â0.019*). Twenty percent were PCR positive for HPV 16 and 40% for HPV 18 whereas none of the control was positive for any of the studied high-risk genotypes. Thirty percent were PCR positive for HPV 6 and 10% were positive for HPV 11. MMP2 gene expression was significantly higher in preterm than full term. Human papilloma viral load was found to be positively correlated to the rate of MMP2 expression and the gestational age was significantly related to the viral load and the rate of expression of MMP2 gene. Human pabilloma virus especially high-risk genotypes was correlated to spontaneous preterm labor in Egyptian females through increasing early expression of MMP2 gene. The time of occurrence of preterm labor was affected by the viral load and so the rate of expression of MMP2 gene.\n\nA randomised controlled trial of probiotics for the prevention of spontaneous preterm delivery associated with bacterial vaginosis: preliminary results\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery at less than 34 weeks of gestation. Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the early administration of selected lactobacilli strains (probiotics) to pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis/intermediate-degree infections to prevent spontaneous premature delivery and associated neonatal morbidity. Methods/Design Asymptomatic pregnant women at less than 20 weeks of gestation, with no indication of elective preterm delivery, with a vaginal pH â¥ 4.5 and Nugent score > 3 were randomly assigned to the placebo or intervention group (oral administration of selected lactobacilli up to the 24th to 26th week of gestation). The randomisation was stratified for the history of premature delivery (HPD) and blocked. The allocation was concealed, and the participating health professionals and patients were blinded. The primary outcome was preterm delivery (<34 to <32 weeks), and the secondary outcomes were associated neonatal complications. Results In total, 4,204 pregnant women were screened; 320 and 324 individuals were respectively randomly assigned to the placebo and intervention groups, and 62% finished the trial. None of the randomised patients were lost to follow-up. For the non-HPD stratum, the intent-to-treat relative risks of spontaneous premature birth at < 34 and < 37 weeks' gestation were 0.33 (0.03, 3.16) and 0.49 (0.17, 1.44), respectively, and they were non-significant (ns) with p = 0.31 and 0.14. The corresponding actual treatment figures were zero and 0.32 (0.09, 1.19), which were ns with p = 0.12 and 0.06. The intent-to-treat relative risk of spontaneous premature birth at < 37 weeks of gestation for the trial as a whole, including HPD and non-HPD participants, was 0.69 (0.26, 1.78), p = 0.30 (ns). The neonatal complications under evaluation occurred in only one infant (< 34 weeks; placebo group) who presented with respiratory distress\n\nThe value of oral micronized progesterone in the prevention of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nAshoush, Sherif; El-Kady, Osama; Al-Hawwary, Gehan; Othman, Ahmed\n\n2017-12-01\n\nProgesterone is becoming universally accepted for preventing recurrent spontaneous preterm delivery. There is, however, poor consensus on the effective types and doses of progesterone to be used. Despite the encouraging available research, the role of oral micronized progesterone has not yet been thoroughly investigated. We randomized 212 singleton pregnancies with past history of spontaneous preterm delivery at <37Â weeks, into a progesterone group (receiving 100Â mg oral micronized progesterone, six-hourly, starting at 14-18Â weeks until 37Â weeks or delivery) and an identical placebo group. The rate of spontaneous preterm delivery was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included gestational age at birth and admission to neonatal intensive care units. The progesterone group delivered at a later gestational age, and needed longer tocolysis-to-delivery intervals (35.4Â weeks vs. 33.9Â weeks, pÂ =Â 0.01, and 87Â days vs. 36Â days, pÂ <Â 0.001, respectively). The relative risk of spontaneous preterm delivery was 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.92, pÂ =Â 0.01), and the number needed-to-treat to prevent one case of spontaneous preterm delivery was 5 (95% confidence interval 3-20). The two groups had similar rates of operative delivery and postpartum complications. Progesterone was associated with mild maternal dizziness (29.1% vs. 9.8%, pÂ =Â 0.002), somnolence (41.6% vs. 19.7%, pÂ =Â 0.002), and vaginal dryness (20.8% vs. 8.7%, pÂ =Â 0.03), lower neonatal mortality rates (7.3% vs. 25.2%, pÂ <Â 0.001), and shorter neonatal intensive care unit admissions (pÂ =Â 0.008). Oral micronized progesterone is effective in preventing spontaneous preterm delivery. The additional advantages of oral administration, affordability, and high safety profile make it worth recommending, at least for further research.

This study characterizes differential protein profiles and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in first trimester maternal serum using a refined top-down approach coupling two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) to directly compare subsequent term and preterm labour events and identify marked protein differences. 30 proteoforms were found to be significantly increased or decreased in the sPTB group including 9 phosphoproteins and 11 glycoproteins. Changes occurred in proteins associated with immune and defence responses. We identified protein species that are associated with several clinically relevant biological processes, including interrelated biological networks linked to regulation of the complement cascade and coagulation pathways, immune modulation, metabolic processes and cell signalling. The finding of altered proteoforms in maternal serum from pregnancies that delivered preterm suggests these as potential early biomarkers of sPTB and also possible mediators of the disorder. Identifying changes in protein profiles is critical in the study of cell biology, and disease treatment and prevention. Identifying consistent changes in the maternal serum proteome during early pregnancy, including specific protein PTMs (e.g. phosphorylation, glycosylation), is likely to provide better opportunities for prediction, intervention and prevention of preterm birth. This is the first study to examine first trimester maternal serum using a highly refined top-down proteomic analytical approach based on high resolution 2DE coupled with mass spectrometry to directly compare preterm (<37â¯weeks) and preterm (â¥37â¯weeks) events and identify select protein differences between these conditions. As such, the data present a promising avenue for translation of biomarker discovery to a\n\nComparison of maternal omentin-1 levels and genetic variability between spontaneous term and preterm births.\n\nPubMed\n\nÅ plÃ­chal, ZbynÄk; ZlÃ¡mal, Filip; MÃ¡chal, Jan; LipkovÃ¡, Jolana; PavlovÃ¡, Tereza; HodickÃ¡, Zuzana; Ventruba, Pavel; VaÅ¡kÅ¯, Anna; BienertovÃ¡-VaÅ¡kÅ¯, Julie\n\n2018-07-01\n\nTo determine maternal omentin-1 levels and genetic variability in the omentin-1 gene in women with spontaneous term and preterm births (PTBs). Maternal serum omentin-1 levels and the role of the omentin-1 Val109Asp (rs2274907) polymorphism were evaluated in 32 women with spontaneous term birth (sTB) and 30 women with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) including women with (nâ=â16) and without (nâ=â14) preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Maternal omentin-1 levels were significantly lower in women with sPTBs compared to term births during the hospitalization period (pâ=â.015). However, maternal omentin-1 levels were similar in women with sPTBs with and without PPROM (pâ=â.990). Furthermore, the omentin-1 Val109Asp polymorphism was found to have no significant effect on omentin-1 serum levels. In addition, no significant differences in genotype distributions and allelic frequencies between sTB and sPTB were established. High omentin-1 levels in normal sTBs compared to PTBs without significant differences between cases with and without PPROM suggest that omentin-1 plays a potential role in the pathophysiology of PTB but not in the PPROM mechanism itself.\n\nPrediction models for the risk of spontaneous preterm birth based on maternal characteristics: a systematic review and independent external validation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeertens, Linda J E; van Montfort, Pim; Scheepers, Hubertina C J; van Kuijk, Sander M J; Aardenburg, Robert; Langenveld, Josje; van Dooren, Ivo M A; Zwaan, Iris M; Spaanderman, Marc E A; Smits, Luc J M\n\n2018-04-17\n\nPrediction models may contribute to personalized risk-based management of women at high risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. Although prediction models are published frequently, often with promising results, external validation generally is lacking. We performed a systematic review of prediction models for the risk of spontaneous preterm birth based on routine clinical parameters. Additionally, we externally validated and evaluated the clinical potential of the models. Prediction models based on routinely collected maternal parameters obtainable during first 16 weeks of gestation were eligible for selection. Risk of bias was assessed according to the CHARMS guidelines. We validated the selected models in a Dutch multicenter prospective cohort study comprising 2614 unselected pregnant women. Information on predictors was obtained by a web-based questionnaire. Predictive performance of the models was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots for the outcomes spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks and <34 weeks of gestation. Clinical value was evaluated by means of decision curve analysis and calculating classification accuracy for different risk thresholds. Four studies describing five prediction models fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Risk of bias assessment revealed a moderate to high risk of bias in three studies. The AUC of the models ranged from 0.54 to 0.67 and from 0.56 to 0.70 for the outcomes spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks and <34 weeks of gestation, respectively. A subanalysis showed that the models discriminated poorly (AUC 0.51-0.56) for nulliparous women. Although we recalibrated the models, two models retained evidence of overfitting. The decision curve analysis showed low clinical benefit for the best performing models. This review revealed several reporting and methodological shortcomings of published prediction models for spontaneous preterm birth.

Methods.âThe Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study network's Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities study is a US-based cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)âexposed uninfected children. We evaluated maternal ARV use during pregnancy and the risk of any type of preterm birth (ie, birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation), the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (ie, preterm birth that occurred after preterm labor or membrane rupture, without other complications), and the risk of small for gestational age (SGA; ie, a birth weight of <10th percentile for gestational age). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of ARVs and timing of exposure, while adjusting for maternal characteristics. Results.âAmong 1869 singleton births, 18.6% were preterm, 10.2% were spontaneous preterm, and 7.3% were SGA. A total of 89% used 3-drug combination ARV regimens during pregnancy. In adjusted models, the odds of preterm birth and spontaneous preterm birth were significantly greater among mothers who used protease inhibitors during the first trimester (adjusted odds ratios, 1.55 and 1.59, respectively) but not among mothers who used nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor or triple-nucleoside regimens during the first trimester. Combination ARV exposure starting later in pregnancy was not associated with increased risk. No associations were observed between SGA and exposure to combination ARV regimens. Conclusions.âProtease inhibitor use early in pregnancy may be associated with increased risk for prematurity.

World-wide, about 15 million babies are born preterm each year resulting in more than a million deaths of children. Preterm neonates are more prone to problems and need intensive care hospitalization. Health issues may persist through early adulthood and even be carried on to the next generation. Majority (70Â %) of PTBs are spontaneous with about a half without any apparent cause and the other half associated with a number of risk factors. Genetic factors are one of the significant risks for PTB. The focus of this review is on single nucleotide gene polymorphisms (SNPs) that are reported to be associated with PTB. A comprehensive evaluation of studies on SNPs known to confer potential risk of PTB was done by performing a targeted PubMed search for the years 2007-2015 and systematically reviewing all relevant studies. Evaluation of 92 studies identified 119 candidate genes with SNPs that had potential association with PTB. The genes were associated with functions of a wide spectrum of tissue and cell types such as endocrine, tissue remodeling, vascular, metabolic, and immune and inflammatory systems. A number of potential functional candidate gene variants have been reported that predispose women for PTB. Understanding the complex genomic landscape of PTB needs high-throughput genome sequencing methods such as whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing approaches that will significantly enhance the understanding of PTB. Identification of high risk women, avoidance of possible risk factors, and provision of personalized health care are important to manage PTB.\n\nEnrichment of clinically relevant organisms in spontaneous preterm delivered placenta and reagent contamination across all clinical groups in a large UK pregnancy cohort.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeon, Lydia J; Doyle, Ronan; Diez-Benavente, Ernest; Clark, Taane G; Klein, Nigel; Stanier, Philip; Moore, Gudrun E\n\n2018-05-18\n\nIn this study differences in the placental microbiota of term and preterm deliveries from a large UK pregnancy cohort were studied using 16S targeted amplicon sequencing. The impact of contamination from DNA extraction, PCR reagents, as well as those from delivery itself were also examined. A total of 400 placental samples from 256 singleton pregnancies were analysed and differences investigated between spontaneous preterm, non-spontaneous preterm, and term delivered placenta. DNA from recently delivered placenta was extracted, and screening for bacterial DNA was carried out using targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequenced reads were analysed for presence of contaminating operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified via sequencing of negative extraction and PCR blank samples. Differential abundance and between sample (beta) diversity metrics were then compared. A large proportion of the reads sequenced from the extracted placental samples mapped to OTUs that were also found in negative extractions. Striking differences in the composition of samples were also observed, according to whether the placenta was delivered abdominally or vaginally, providing strong circumstantial evidence for delivery contamination as an important contributor to observed microbial profiles. When OTU and genus level abundances were compared between the groups of interest, a number of organisms were enriched in the spontaneous preterm cohort, including organisms that have been previously associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically Mycoplasma spp., and Ureaplasma spp.. However, analyses of overall community structure did not reveal convincing evidence for the existence of a reproducible 'preterm placental microbiome'.

F.; Greenberg, James M.; Garfield, Susan S.; Thung, Stephen F.; Iams, Jay D.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectiveâThe objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact to the U.S. health care system by adopting a novel test that identifies women at risk for spontaneous preterm birth. MethodsâA decision-analytic model was developed to assess clinical and cost outcomes over a 1-year period. The use of a prognostic test to predict spontaneous preterm birth in a hypothetical population of women reflective of the U.S. population (predictive arm) was compared with the current baseline rate of spontaneous preterm birth and associated infant morbidity and mortality (baseline care arm). ResultsâIn a population of 3,528,593 births, our model predicts a 23.5% reduction in infant mortality (8,300 vs. 6,343 deaths) with use of the novel test. The rate of acute conditions at birth decreased from 11.2 to 8.1%; similarly, the rate of developmental disabilities decreased from 13.2 to 11.5%. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth decreased from 9.8 to 9.1%, a reduction of 23,430 preterm births. Direct medical costs savings was $511.7M (â 2.1%) in the first year of life. DiscussionâThe use of a prognostic test for reducing spontaneous preterm birth is a dominant strategy that could reduce costs and improve outcomes. More research is needed once such a test is available to determine if these results are borne out upon real-world use.

Infants are born preterm at less than 37 weeks' gestational age after: (1) spontaneous labour with intact membranes, (2) preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM), and (3) labour induction or caesarean delivery for maternal or fetal indications. The frequency of preterm births is about 12-13% in the USA and 5-9% in many other developed countries; however, the rate of preterm birth has increased in many locations, predominantly because of increasing indicated preterm births and preterm delivery of artificially conceived multiple pregnancies. Common reasons for indicated preterm births include pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Births that follow spontaneous preterm labour and PPROM-together called spontaneous preterm births-are regarded as a syndrome resulting from multiple causes, including infection or inflammation, vascular disease, and uterine overdistension. Risk factors for spontaneous preterm births include a previous preterm birth, black race, periodontal disease, and low maternal body-mass index. A short cervical length and a raised cervical-vaginal fetal fibronectin concentration are the strongest predictors of spontaneous preterm birth.\n\nNonresponse to 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate for recurrent spontaneous preterm birth prevention: clinical prediction and generation of a risk scoring system.\n\nPubMed\n\nManuck, Tracy A; Stoddard, Gregory J; Fry, Rebecca C; Esplin, M Sean; Varner, Michael W\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSpontaneous preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality among nonanomalous neonates in the United States. Spontaneous preterm birth tends to recur at similar gestational ages. Intramuscular 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate reduces the risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth. Unfortunately, one-third of high-risk women will have a recurrent spontaneous preterm birth despite 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate therapy; the reasons for this variability in response are unknown. We hypothesized that clinical factors among women treated with 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate who suffer recurrent spontaneous preterm birth at a similar gestational age differ from women who deliver later, and that these associations could be used to generate a clinical scoring system to predict 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate response. Secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolling women with â¥1 previous singleton spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks' gestation. Participants received daily omega-3 supplementation or placebo for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth; all were provided 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Women were classified as a 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate responder or nonresponder by calculating the difference in delivery gestational age between the 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate-treated pregnancy and her earliest previous spontaneous preterm birth. Responders were women with pregnancy extending â¥3 weeks later compared with the delivery gestational age of their earliest previous preterm birth; nonresponders delivered earlier or within 3 weeks of the gestational age of their earliest previous preterm birth. A risk score for nonresponse to 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate was generated from regression models via the use of clinical predictors and was validated in an independent population. Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. A\n\nAmniotic Fluid Eicosanoids in Preterm and Term Births: Effects of Risk Factors for Spontaneous Preterm Labor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMenon, Ramkumar; Fortunato, Stephen J.; Milne, Ginger L.; Brou, Lina; Carnevale, Claudine; Sanchez, Stephanie C.; Hubbard, Leah; Lappas, Martha; Drobek, Cayce Owens; Taylor, Robert N.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate amniotic fluid (AF) arachidonic acid metabolites using enzymatic and nonenzymatic (lipid peroxidation) pathways in spontaneous preterm birth and term births, and to estimate whether prostanoid concentrations correlate with risk factors (race, cigarette smoking, and microbial invasion of amniotic cavity) associated with preterm birth. METHODS In a case-control study, AF was collected at the time of labor or during cesarean delivery. AF samples were subjected to gas chromatography, negative ion chemical ionization, and mass spectrometry for prostaglandin (PG)E2, PGF2Î±, and PGD2, 6-keto-PGF1Î± (6-KPGF1Î±, thromboxane (TXB2), and F2-isoprostane (F2-IsoP). Primary analysis examined differences between prostanoid concentrations in preterm birth (n=133) compared with term births (n=189). Secondary stratified analyses (by race, cigarette smoking and microbial invasion of amniotic cavity) compared eicosanoid concentrations in three epidemiological risk factors. RESULTS AF F2-IsoP, PGE2, and PGD2 were significantly higher at term than in PTB, whereas PGF2 Î± was higher in PTB 6-KPGF1Î± and TXB2 concentrations were not different. Data stratified by race (African American or Caucasian) showed no significant disparity among prost"
