        "text": "4.1. Study 1: The Effect of Wash Solvent on Hair and Solvent Cortisol and DHEA Concentrations\n\nThis study aimed to identify whether isopropanol versus methanol as a wash solvent used to decontaminate swine hair impacted the concentrations of cortisol and DHEA extracted from the hair, the solvent, and the solvent–hair ratio. Unlike DHEA, cortisol was affected by the two different wash solvents, with methanol resulting in a lower concentration of cortisol detected in hair following three 3 min washes. The difference between the two solvents, however, was only 13%, and the physiological significance was not clear as it is not currently possible to associate hormone levels in hair with circulating physiologically relevant concentrations. However, it is also important to note that when sow and grower hair was analyzed separately, only sow hair had higher hair cortisol concentrations following three isopropanol washes. However, as there was no significant difference between the concentrations of hair cortisol concentrations between sows and grower, the data were combined. Furthermore, while there were no differences in solvent hormone concentrations following three isopropanol vs. methanol washes when the sow and grower hair was combined, when separate, there were opposing trends. Due to the difference between methanol and isopropanol in sows and when the groups were combined, methanol is suggested as the wash solvent due to the results in the sow hair; moreover, due to the desire to compare hair hormone concentrations between different subgroups and ages of pigs, it may universally offer a better choice of solvent.\n\nPrevious work has identified differences between the two wash solvents in rhesus macaque and bear hair. Specifically, Davenport et al. [25] determined that after three 3 min washes, methanol extracted cortisol from within the hair shaft, as indicated by an increase in solvent cortisol concentrations with successive washes. Thus, Davenport et al. [25] recommended two isopropanol washes for rhesus macaque hair. Consequently, the findings of Davenport et al. [25] have been followed for swine hair analysis [9,10,12,19,20,21,22,23,24]. In contrast, Kroshko et al. [26] found that, even after nine 3 min methanol washes, methanol did not extract cortisol from within the hair shaft in bear hair, as indicated by decreases or no changes in the cortisol wash solvent concentrations with increasing washes. Results from Kroshko et al. [26], thus, recommended three methanol washes prior to hair hormone analysis. It is thus possible that the ideal washing protocol is species-dependent; however, this has never been evaluated in swine hair. One possible reason for the difference between the two hormones found in the present study could be due to the differences in chemical structure, which in turn affects their solubility. While cortisol and DHEA share the same cyclopentanophenanthrene ring structure [30], cortisol is a larger molecule with a mass of 362.5 g/mol with an additional ketone group and two additional hydroxyl groups, compared to DHEA with a mass of 288.4 g/mol [31]. However, no other studies have examined the washing dynamics of these two hormones; hence, no studies are available for comparison. Furthermore, considering the knowledge that methanol is a more aggressive wash solvent [32], this could indicate that methanol is more effective in eliminating external contamination; thus, three washes with isopropanol may leave higher amounts of external contaminants remaining on the hair.\n\nThe reason for the difference between sows and grower pigs could be due to physical differences in the hair. The visual difference noted was that sow hair was longer and coarser than the grower hair, likely a result of the sows being older. While no studies exist comparing physical hair characteristics in swine or in hair cortisol or DHEA analysis in any species, forensic hair testing for drug analysis has determined that hair pigmentation, keratin content, permeability, moisture content, and hair damage impact the uptake and concentrations of drugs in the hair [33]. It is thus possible that one or more of these physical characteristics could cause certain pigs or groups of pigs to be affected differently by different wash solvents. This information should be regarded when considering a wash solvent, and the results of this study demonstrate the value of examining how the wash solvent affects the hormone concentration in hair.\n\nOne limitation to this study was the small amount of sow hair available. For this reason, sow hair was only used to analyze differences in cortisol concentrations between the two solvents. Thus, the sample size for the cortisol group was twice as high (n = 16, with n = 8 sows and n = 8 grow pigs) compared to the DHEA group. However, power analysis (two-tailed significance, with power of 0.8) revealed that a sample size of 374 would be needed to see a significant difference for hair DHEA concentrations; thus, no differences were expected with a sample size of 16.\n\nThis is one of three existing studies that measured DHEA levels in swine hair [9,10]. Previous published work showed great variation in measured DHEA levels. Bergamin et al. [10] obtained average values in barrows of 29.51 and 17.64 pg/mg in gilts at 36 weeks of age. In contrast, Trevisan et al. [9] found much higher values, with healthy pigs having levels of 387.7 ± 116.4 pg/mg and pigs infected with T. solium at 253.9 ± 82.3 pg/mg. The values found in the present study were closest in number to those seen by Bergamin et al. [10] with clean hair having an average of 36.29 ± 6.16 pg/mg. Studies that exist evaluating hair cortisol concentrations had similar values to those found in the current study. In the present study, DHEA concentrations ranged from 9.05 ± 1.06 pg/mg in contaminated hair to 17.47 ± 1.12 in clean hair. This is within the expected range, as other studies reported values ranging from 4.45 ± 0.335 [10] to 36.23 ± 18.97 [23].\n\n4.2. Study 2: The Effect of Contamination and Wash Number on Cortisol and DHEA Concentrations Measured in Hair and Methanol Wash Solvent, and the Solvent–Hair Ratio\n\nThe goals of this study were to determine if external contamination of the hair shaft with feces and urine and the number of washes impacted the concentration of hormones extracted from the hair, the solvent, and their ratio. Calculating the ratio of hormone concentrations from the solvent to that extracted within the hair was conducted as a method in evaluating washing efficacy as recommended by Tsanaclis and Wicks [28]. Our results consistently showed an increase in hair and solvent hormone concentrations, as well as their ratio, after one wash compared to five washes, suggesting that the majority of external contamination was removed following one wash. Despite the concentrations of DHEA being on average three times higher than those of cortisol within the hair shaft, the amounts detected in the wash solvent were consistently lower. This suggests that DHEA may be present in smaller amounts in swine feces and urine, or that DHEA may more readily become incorporated into the hair shaft compared to cortisol. However, to the authors’ knowledge, no studies to date are available regarding concentrations of DHEA in swine urine and feces.\n\nTsanaclis and Wicks [28] determined that taking the ratio of the concentrations of analytes washed off into the solvent to that extracted from within the hair was a valuable method in determining when hair was externally contaminated, as well as to assess the efficacy of the wash protocol. Specifically, ratio values less than 0.1 were suggested to indicate a noncontaminated sample, while values above 0.5 indicate the presence of external contamination, and values between 0.1 and 0.5 are uncertain. Our study found that the solvent–hair ratio for cortisol had a value larger than 0.5 following one wash, with values between 0.1 and 0.5 following three and five washes, suggesting that the hair is still contaminated following one wash, with possible contamination following three and five washes. However, DHEA consistently had values lower than 0.1, suggesting that, even after one wash, external contamination was not present in these samples. It is thus recommended hair be washed with methanol three times to reduce the risk of contamination, particularly for cortisol analysis. One limitation to our study was that the hair hormone concentration after two washes was not analyzed. The majority of pig research used two isopropanol washes [9,10,12,22,23,24], with the remaining studies using an unspecified number of isopropanol washes [20,21]; thus, future research determining differences between three methanol washes and two isopropanol washes would be beneficial for both cortisol and DHEA. While our study suggests that DHEA does not differ between the two solvents, it does clearly indicate a difference in concentrations with increasing wash numbers. Thus, it is possible that whereas the solvent did not affect DHEA concentrations, washing number still had a significant effect.\n\nThere was a nest effect for hair and solvent cortisol concentrations, which indicates an effect at the level of the individual pig, in addition to an interactive effect between the individual pig and the level of contamination for hair DHEA. Despite only eight grower pigs being used in this study, each pig was used as its own control to account for possible variations. As stated above, individual hair characteristics are also known to impact drug analysis in human hair; thus, it is likely that it could also affect the uptake of fecal and urinary contamination in swine hair, as well as the efficacy of the wash protocol.\n\nThe second study revealed that, after three washes, the uncontaminated group had higher concentrations of cortisol, but not DHEA, in both the hair and the wash solvent compared to the mild and severely contaminated groups, which did not differ. It is possible that this difference was due to hair in the contamination groups being left contaminated in feces and urine for 72 h. Previous studies have shown that water lowers hair cortisol concentrations in pigs [24] and rhesus macaques [34]. It is, thus, possible that moisture caused swelling of the cuticle of the hair leading to leaching of hormones from within the hair shaft. However, Otten et al. [24] reported that urine increased hair cortisol concentrations, suggesting the external cortisol may become incorporated over time. Otten et al. [24] contaminated hair continuously for 4 weeks by submerging hair in liquid contamination and rotating the hair for 2 h. In contrast, our study smeared a mixture of feces and urine on hair and left it for 72 h. This methodology was chosen as it should replicate what would be expected in commercial pigs. We chose this method in order to best replicate the manner of contamination seen in swine hair in the barn. It would be quite unlikely for hair to be completely submerged in urine and feces for 2 h a day for many weeks in a row, particularly for swine in a fully slatted system. Wang et al. [35] found that it takes somewhere between 1 and 5 days for external cortisol contamination (from cortisone cream) to become integrated into the hair shaft of human hair. Thus, it is possible that 72 h was not long enough for the external hormones to become integrated with the hair shaft, but perhaps long enough to damage the cuticle and cause leaching of hormones from within the hair.\n\nAnother factor that may have influenced the results is the type of contamination that was used. Otten et al. [24] determined that urine increased hair cortisol concentrations, whereas a mixture of feces and water decreased concentrations. Since water lowers hair cortisol concentrations, it cannot be certain that it was the feces lowering the concentrations in the previously mentioned study, since it was mixed with water. However, given the results from the current study, it is suggestive that this may be the case. While the current study used a mixture of feces and urine, the feces was collected from above the slats in a fully slatted system. For this reason, it is possible that much of the urine fell into the slurry prior to collection, resulting in the majority of the mass used to contaminate hair being feces. One limitation to this study is that the concentrations of the urine and feces mixture were not analyzed due to financial restrictions and no validation methods being available for DHEA in swine feces. Furthermore, had this been measured, it would still not have been possible to identify how much of the external contamination incorporated into the hair shaft. However, other studies have suggested that urine has higher amounts of cortisol compared to feces and hair on a mass/mass basis. Hair cortisol concentrations in this study varied from 5.40–31.07 pg/mg. Carlsson et al. [36] found feces to have a range of approximately 5–45 pg of cortisol per mg of feces. In contrast, Otten et al. [24] found an average urinary cortisol concentration of 324.6 ng/mL, which is the equivalent of 324,500 pg of cortisol per mg of urine. Given these numbers, it is likely that urine has a higher probability of impacting hair hormone analysis. Future research analyzing the difference in urine versus feces in a manner closely resembling real life contamination would be beneficial. It would also be of use to determine if the age of pig has an effect on contamination. Pig hair is quite fine as a piglet compared to when older, e.g., around 60 kg in live weight (personal observation). Furthermore, older pigs have a high percentage of damaged hair, which has shown to increase the integration of external contaminants in human hair externally contaminated with cocaine [37]. Thus, it is possible that older pigs with thicker and more damaged hair incorporate dirt more readily."
