        "text": "Set (4)progressed b NN 10 Aquarius 58 progressed c saturn10 Aquarius 30Rruler of c 5th house progressed b5 saturn10 Aquarius 36ruler of B Asc in c 5th house\n\nSet (4) does not have Angular influence, but it does show two more progressed saturn/5th influences.\n\nSumming Angle influences, Dr. Abraham had sun, mars, saturn, and neptune on Angles with influences to 5th houses. Mars/saturn/neptune represents siege conditions. Dying from cancer is a physical siege condition. (For more discussion of cancer and these significators, see the paper on Dr. Tom Dooley on this site. At the end of that paper I include an astrological breakdown showing similar siege conditions for Lois Rodden, founder of Astrodatabase, who died of cancer in June, 2003 after battling it successfully several times over the years. Siege conditions is my general term for when mars, saturn, and neptune are Angular. Another 7th chart siege condition, for instance, is represented by death in a concentration camp, with those planets influencing a 4th house.\n\nI have set forth my reasons for believing Abraham died of a sexually-related cancer. (I have not included progressions for his 7th chart, which should be done for this kind of death). If my speculations are correct, the truly tragic irony of Abrahams life was his loyalty to Freud. When Freud crushed Abrahams interest in childhood sexual trauma, he also annihilated Abrahams efforts toward liberating himself through the study of other sexually traumatized children (who become adults).\n\nWhy didnt Abraham throw down the gauntlet and assert his independence from Freud? Two reasons are immediately apparent.\n\nFirst, Abraham has his South Node in Leo conjunct his C Asc. That makes loyalty (Leo) a deeply ingrained (SN) part of his identity (Asc). However, as I have mentioned in other papers, when the South Node is on the Asc or MC, it is usually unfavorable for the life. It brings disapproval and misfortune. So, loyalty is usually a fine character trait, but even loyalty can be used badly in service of the wrong reason.\n\nSecond, in looking at his relationship to his father shown in his 4th chart (not shown here), we can see that Abraham had, (a) one set with b4 moon in Pisces conjunct c4 venus in Pisces, with no 5th house influence. It shows Abraham had a deep, painful love for his father. He was used to suffering (Pisces) for love of (venus) his father (4th chart). Continuing with his 4th chart, (b) his shell C MC and C Asc with its conjunction to c SN acquires b4 sun at 27 Aquarius 53, lighting that set which also includes b saturn (ruler of B Asc in c 5th) which is progressing closer to it. That indicates his father could have been instrumental in highlighting Abrahams sexual repression. Finally, (c) his c mercury at 27 Gemini 49 acquires two harmonics in this chart: c4 sun (ruler of c 12th house) is at 27 Gemini 53 conjunct it and b4 saturn (ruler of B Asc in c 5th house) is at 27 Pisces 33. Lighted saturn in Pisces always represents painful (Pisces) limitations (saturn) and vulnerabilities (saturn) in the chart they occur in. These latter two saturn sets (b and c) include two references to 5th houses and are both Angular in influence. Do I think his father molested Abraham? No, saturn is not usually a planet of sexual activity. There are other sexual traumas besides molestation. The suggestion is Abrahams father disapproved of him or withheld approval (both saturn), possibly because of his sensuality (SN in Taurus in 5th chart). The withheld love (or, missing blessing if you will) created in Abraham a lifelong deep and painful craving for its fulfillment.\n\nWhen Karl Abraham gave up his interest in childhood sexual trauma subsequent to Freuds disapproval, he buried his increasing intuition of its value for his own development. In so doing he chose loyalty to Freud over honoring himself.\n\nWe should take a look at one set in Dr. Abrahams 10th chart before moving on to other charts of doctors of the mind.\n\nKarl Abraham Partial Harmonic Chart for the 10th House\n\nPlacidus: c11--3Can, c12--4Leo, c2--21Vir, c3--20Lib b11--30Sco, b12--17Sag, b2--13Pis, b3--20Ari\n\nSet (1) above shows a conjunction of sun, venus, and jupiter in Aries--a golden benefic set. Sun co-rules (30 of 66°) b 7th, venus rules b 4th, 5th and 9th houses and co-rules (20 of 37°) b 8th. C10 jupiter co-rules (30 of 37°) c 4th house. This set has no Angular influence, reducing its power for beneficence. It is on the cusp of b 9th and c 3rd houses, indicating Abraham urge toward making his ideas (3rd) into a coherent philosophy (9th) as well as the invasion of religion into his ordinary thinking. The 3rd/9th overlap also likely promoted acceptance of Abrahams ideas (3rd) among psychoanalysts in foreign countries (9th).\n\nBoth Freud and Abraham had birth sun in Aries. Abrahams sun, however, was not in a set with uranus as was Freuds. Both had a forefront moon in Scorpio with 5th influence. Freud had b7 moon, ruling B MC, in Scorpio in c 5th house. Abraham had b5 moon in Scorpio conjunct B MC in his 5th chart. Both had golden benefics in their 10th charts. Only Freuds golden benefic influenced an Angle.\n\nThe chart of Anna Freud, psychoanalyst and daughter of Sigmund Freud, shows all the 7th chart significators for psychiatrists.\n\nAnna Freud Partial Harmonic Chart for the 7th House\n\nPlacidus: c11--14Lib, c12--4Sco, c2--28Sag, c3--12Aqu b11--2Aqu, b12--10Pis, b2--29Tau, b3--17Gem\n\nSet (1) above shows lighted pluto (in the set including C Asc, b sun, b and c plutos, c mercury, and c neptune) influencing C MC, 3rd, 5th, and 8th houses. Pluto is in c 7th house (conjunct neptune).\n\nAccording to a data note, the following individual was (is?) an American Jungian psychologist and analyst. I include his partial chart only to show the significators for psychiatrists.\n\nJ. Marvin Spiegelman Partial Harmonic Chart for the 7th House\n\nPlacidus: c11--13Lib, c12--7Sco, c2--2Cap, c3--10Aqu b11--8Aqu, b12--15Pis, b2--25Tau, b3--17Gem\n\nSet (1) above includes Asc/moon/mercury/mercury/mars/saturn/neptune/neptune/pluto. Saturn rules B MC . C neptune co-rules c 3rd house (15 of 35°). Although moon/mars/saturn falls in b 7th house and influences that 7th, this set has no other influence to a 7th, so it does not show lighted pluto influence to the 7th.\n\nSpiegelmans lighted pluto/7th influence is shown in Set (2). He has b and c pluto conjunct b NN in Gemini in c 7th house. By age 60, his pb NN was at 22 Gemini 43, moving closer to c pluto. Both plutos started out direct, so they were moving closer to pb NN. Since this set also falls in b 3rd house, it shows another lighted pluto influence to a 3rd house.\n\nWith a difficult set like Set (1) Angular one might wonder how Spiegelman accomplished anything. His C Asc was in a set with moon/venus/jupiter/node, with moon ruling c 8th, jupiter co-ruling b 8th, and venus ruling c 6th and c 11th. Likely some of the difficulty of his Set (1), which includes mercury, was represented by his patients (7th) and their talking (mercury) about their misfortunes (moon/mars/saturn).\n\nNote that Spiegelman, a Jungian, has his c sun (which repeats in all twelve charts) in a set with neptune (Jungian) and pluto (Freudian) as did Anna Freud. In his 7th chart Spiegelmans b sun, b harmonic sun, and c harmonic sun are in the same set with harmonic uranus, with uranus ruling c 3rd house. He has a uranian (innovative) mind but a neptunian (creative) approach.\n\nI want to finish this presentation of a series of charts of mental doctors with the partial chart of Richard Krafft-Ebing, neurologist, psychiatrist, sex researcher and author of Psychopathia Sexualis.\n\nRichard Krafft-Ebing Partial Harmonic Chart for the 7th House, Part I\n\nPlacidus: c11--29Gem, c12--1Leo, c2--19Vir, c3--18Lib b11--24Sag, b12--17Cap, b2--20Ari, b3--16Tau\n\nSet (1) above includes moon/moon/mars/saturn/uranus/neptune/pluto. There is a lighted pluto in it, but this set has no influence to an Angle or 3rd house. It influences c 7th house through c7 neptune, co-ruler ( 19 of 23°) of c 7th. His lighted pluto influence to a 3rd and 10th houses is through c7 pluto at 14 Gemini 41 (sign) lighted by b7 SN at 13 Virgo 34 conjunct c venus (ruler of C MC and c 3rd house) at 13 Virgo 10 and b7 venus (ruler of b 3rd house) at 15 Virgo 42.\n\nKrafft-Ebing was not much of a therapist, though he did talk with patients. His interests focused on research. To quote the data source:\n\nhis interests were wide-spread. He directed his investigations into the genetic and legal aspects of criminal behavior genetics as related to insanity and sexual aberrations epilepsy, syphilis, and paralysis the focus of his life was a systematic study into the lives of homosexuals, whom he believed were born normal but turned to homosexuality to indulge in perverted sexual thrills. He had an interest in same-sex eroticism, and collected hundreds of medical and court reports relating to sexual abnormalities. Although outwardly expressing pity, he often seemed morally revolted by his subjects Krafft-Ebings work formed the foundation that established the psychiatric viewpoint of homosexuality as an illness.\n\nSet (2) above shows the conjunction of two venuses in Virgo to b7 SN in 7th/1st houses. Astrologically, these are one source of his moral revulsion. They suggest he was coming from (SN) a place that emphasized discrimination (Virgo) in personal behavior (1st) and relationships (7th). Hygienic practices (Virgo) were probably exceptional. He was chained (SN) to prim, highly-defined (Virgo) attractions (venus). His prissiness would have helped him gain distance from those he studied-- I am not unfortunate, I am exceptionally clean. They (NN in Pisces in the other 1/7 combination, the 1st/7th) are the unfortunate (unclean, self-indulgent) ones.\n\nWhile NN in Pisces often means the individual who has it is investigating suffering through his own experience, in Krafft-Ebings case it also indicates he is investigating the suffering and the misfortune of others (his c 7th house).\n\nSet (3) above shows the conjunction (a wide one, but progressing c pluto is retrograde, so moving toward the moon) of c7 moon to c pluto in Pisces. This set, in 1st/8th, suggests an early interest (perhaps in self-defense) in the suffering represented by Pisces. A living representative may have been his mother (moon).\n\nWe had our clue about the main focus of Krafft-Ebings investigations in both Set (1) and Set (3). In Set (1), c moon co-rules (30 of 32°) c 11th house. In Set (2), c7 moon co-rules c 11th house. In addition, Krafft-Ebing has a 5th/11th and an 11/5th overlap. He investigates groups (11th) of sexual (5th) unfortunates (Pisces moon co-rules 11th).\n\nHis interests are further defined by the following.\n\nRichard Krafft-Ebing Partial Harmonic Chart for the 7th House, Part II\n\nPlacidus: c11--29Gem, c12--1Leo, c2--19Vir, c3--18Lib b11--24Sag, b12--17Cap, b2--20Ari, b3--16Tau\n\nSet (1) includes Nodes/mercury/venus/neptune/uranus with mercury and neptune (pulled into a conjunction by the nodes) in Scorpio in 3rd/8th houses. Mercury in Scorpio shows an intellectual interest (mercury and 3rd) in subjects such as sex, death, murder (Scorpio) and transformations (8th). Conjunct neptune in Scorpio it makes those subjects fascinating. He needs (node progressing toward mercury) to snoop (8th) in those areas. Venus rules b 3rd house (another 3rd influence) and b 8th house (another 8th--Scorpio/transformations) influence. Mercury rules c 2nd and c 11th. The 11th influence focuses his interests in these areas on select groups (11th). Neptune rules B MC (in c 7th house, focusing it on one-on-one relations with others) giving this whole set Angular influence.\n\nI want to finish Krafft-Ebings astrology with three sets from his 10th chart, the chart which contains information about the individuals social standing and career as well as the early influence of his mother. (Indeed, our relationships with our mothers profoundly underwrite our social development). One shows his success. Another further elucidates his interest in investigating the sex lives (8th and Scorpio) of particular groupings of individuals (11th). The third one shows a seriously afflicted 10th chart and helps us understand how, with sufficient benefic support, Krafft-Ebing turned his suffering into service.\n\n. Richard Krafft-Ebing Partial Harmonic Chart for the 10th House, Part I\n\nPlacidus: c11--29Gem, c12--1Leo, c2--19Vir, c3--18Lib b11--24Sag, b12--17Cap, b2--20Ari, b3--16Tau\n\nSet (1) above shows C MC in a set with nodes/moon/jupiter/mars/mars/saturn/-saturn/uranus, with the nodes and moon acting as lights. His shell chart showed C MC in a set with nodes/moon/saturn/uranus, with moon co-ruling (17 of 23°) b 5th and saturn ruling b 12th, co-ruling the 11th. That is difficult enough--it implies fated (nodes and 12th) or powerful (nodes) rejection (saturn) and/or lack of nurturing (saturn) or emotional scarring (saturn in Scorpio) of Krafft-Ebing in his early life (moon) through his relationship with his mother. This had a depressing or repressive (saturn) effect on his sexuality (5th). Harmonics for his 10th chart , however, added three more malefics--two mars and another saturn, confirming his early negative relationship with his mother. Influence of the set through rulers and co-rulers increased to b 2nd, 8th, and 9th (mars), c 3rd, 8th and 9th (mars), and c 5th (c10 saturn co-rules c 5th house, 30 of 32°). Jupiter in it is benefic, but it serves to link this set again to the 5th house (jupiter rules c 5th), negatively affecting his sexuality (5th) through poor early female models.\n\nIn working this out through his career he was known (10th chart) as an individual who studied (3rd) the sexual problems (5th) of groups (11th) of unfortunate (mars/saturn) individuals.\n\nRichard Krafft-Ebing Partial Harmonic Chart for the 10th House, Part II\n\nPlacidus: c11--29Gem, c12--1Leo, c2--19Vir, c3--18Lib b11--24Sag, b12--17Cap, b2--20Ari, b3--16Tau\n\nSet (1) above started out in the shell chart with c mars (4th and 9th ruler, 3rd and 8th co-ruler) and B Asc. Through harmonics it acquired moon/neptune/pluto, with neptune and pluto conjunct in Scorpio in an out-of-sign conjunction with b10 moon, co-ruler (17 of 23°) of b 5th house. C10 neptune rules c 8th. This set shows a fascination (neptune) with sex (5th) and sexual relationships (Scorpio/8th) and a deep need to investigate them (pluto) intellectually (3rd influence). But it is also a toxic set--containing as it does light/mars/neptune. It suggests the source of Krafft-Ebings lifelong investigation of aberrant sexual behavior and his fascination with same-sex eroticism. It was based on his own toxic relationship with his mother and the consequent aversion for females it caused. (I should add, Krafft-Ebing was married for 28 years and had 3 children.)\n\nI have discussed the 4th and 10th charts as representative of parental influence in other papers. In the Appendix I show two more charts. The first shows the 10th chart of a little girl, Elisa, sexually abused and tortured to death by her mother. The second shows the 4th chart of a little girl, Laurie, allegedly sexually abused by her father.\n\nGo to the Appendix\n\nDiscussion\n\nI had limited objectives in writing this paper. I wanted to show significators, that is, planets always associated with a condition, for psychiatrists. They begin with lighted pluto (in-depth investigation) influencing 3rd (mind), 7th (one-on-one personal encounters) and 10th (profession) houses in the 7th chart. That I did, accounting for missing significators according to type of psychiatry I understood each practiced. Dr. Karl Abrahams missing 7th house significator is an example.\n\nI wanted to show unique sets in charts in which the psychiatrist diverged from one-on-one therapy:\n\nThe heavy Gemini/10th emphasis (two moons in Gemini) in the chart of Dr. Progoff is one example. With that much Gemini, he was more prone to writing and communicating than to individual therapy. He might have satisfied the writing part of it by writing papers and books. He did satisfy it by inventing a journal method of self-analysis and even writing about his writing. The communication part of it he satisfied through extensive lecturing.\n\nIn the chart of Krafft-Ebing, his forefront mars/saturn (and sometimes mars/saturn/neptune) as well as Pisces reflect not so much his misery as that of his unfortunate (people with sexual diseases) patients. One could say they acted out his pain for him. His chart shows what can happen when an individual starts the service part of his path--some of his more difficult sets become descriptive of the individuals he works with.\n\nBecause psychiatry is heavily involved in the influence of parents on the development of the child, I showed or discussed several parent charts:\n\nKrafft-Ebings mother chart (10th) is especially heavily afflicted and he worked, in his time, with individuals considered heavily afflicted.\n\nI discussed some of Karl Abrahams father chart (4th) in trying to explain Abrahams self-annihilating as well as loyal relationship to Freud.\n\n.\n\nIn the Appendix I discussed both parent charts for two molested children. Elisa Izquierdo, who was sexually tortured and murdered by her mother has the most heavily afflicted mother chart. Laurie, who was allegedly sexually molested by her father has extra Pisces in the 5th house in both her 4th and 10th charts, but the malefic in Pisces (mars) is in her father chart (4th chart). In retrospect, I added another chart, that of a pedophile who also murdered one child. Both his parent charts were discussed but not as extensively as with the two little girls.\n\nAll of the above categories require much more research. However, because of the number of charts I have done of psychiatrists, I am certain about the solidity of those significators.\n\nUnique sets in charts of psychiatrists also need more research. Interpretations, however, of those I presented are solidly in line with standard astrological interpretation.\n\nFinally, I started this paper with an interest in examining Freuds chart from the perspective of his objectivity.\n\nFirst, I would like to say that Freuds conclusions about the importance of sex and death in human psychodynamics was based on a deep and continuous examination of those areas. He did not just have a few insights that somehow became historically viable. He dedicated his life to examining those areas. At the same time, however, and importantly for the duration of his ideas, those two areas have always been subjects of tremendous interest to mankind. They are profoundly imbedded in Mans being. Every mortal has to die. And the whole of creation is based on sex.\n\nMoreover, Freud's work took place during times there was considerable cultural sexual repression. Combined with limited life roles then available to women, it is not surprising the combination gnerated many pathological symptoms.\n\nAll of the above had to have combined to make it seem Freud's view of reality was \"spot on.\" Surely what he discovered was \"reality.\"\n\nHowever, in this paper, we saw numerous indicators in Freuds charts of his profession, his particular choice of emphasis on sex and a death urge, and his role as an innovator. All of these point to Freuds powerful predisposition to see these subjects as if they independently existed out there when in fact his ability to see them was conditional, i.e., based on his astrology. Moon (or sun) in Scorpio is a particularly strong indicator (shown in numerous charts in other papers) of an interest in sex and death, transformations, and merged identities. Sometimes these subject areas are combined in one individual, as is seen in the charts of serial murderers who torture sexually. Sometimes they take a much milder form as demonstrated, for instance, by the writing, and readers, of Stephen King. Or, for instance, by readers of pornography and S&M literature. Or, as one more example, is shown by members of spiritual groups for whom emotional group cohesion is important as the major vehicle of reminders to spiritual work.\n\nFreuds Scorpio moon set the parameters (sex and death) of his interests. Its conjunction to pluto set the depth. The same was true of Nietzsches moon conjunct pluto in Pisces, sponsoring his deep exploration (pluto) of suffering (Pisces). Depth combined with genius sponsors new (relative to those of us without those things) insights.\n\nWe can conclude that rather than seeing absolute reality, Freud saw a reality he was predisposed to \"discover.\" At least at the level of the ordinary mind, it appears we can (only?) examine that which we are astrologically predisposed to see. Our astrology, the sponsor of our self with a small \"s\", sets our parameters for being-in-this-world, seeing-in-this-world, and feeling-in-this-world. Without his predispositions, Freud could not have sponsored psychoanalysis. Because of his predispositions, as well as his cultural, familial, and epochal biases, Freud was far from free from bias. That does not deny him as a significant innovator.\n\nRose Twisted-Stalk (cropped)\n\nFrom Wildflowers of Michigan Field Guide, by Stan Tekiela\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) Readers might wonder if his 1st/5th overlap means Freud was sexually molested as a child. It is premature in my work to state he was or was not. I do not believe he was. In his 7th chart, the overlap does not contain any planets. But his 5th chart contains b5 venus, ruler of B Asc, at 24 Libra 15. His B Asc is conjunct c SN in Libra (a sign favoring appeasement) in c 5th house. These, along with other indications in his charts (to be discussed) are sufficient to indicate a very early interest in sexuality, possibly from past lives (SN). The question of the dividing line between interest in sexuality and being sexually molested can really only be decided after research has been done with individuals who fall into one or the other of the two groups.\n\n(2) The locations of Freuds progressed conception North Node for age 20, 40, 60, and 80 are 13 Aries 36, 12 Aries 19, 11 Aries 12, and 11 Aries 01, respectively. So, throughout his life his conjunction of pluto to NN in Aries became tighter.\n\n(3) Taken from website http://www.microtec.net/desgros/index.html.
