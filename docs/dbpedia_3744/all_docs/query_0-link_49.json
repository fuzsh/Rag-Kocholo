        "text": "on SHAME Blistering probes by state, city cast wide net of blame By RUSS BUETTNER Daily News Staff Writer From the day of her birth in 1989 until the day her battered body was found in her mother's lower East Side apartment, Elisa Izquierdo was failed by scores of social workers, hospitals, educators and court officials, separate state and city reports conclude. The scathing reports, released yesterday, portray a child welfare system incapable of preventing a child's death even when presented with the most profound warning signs. For the first time, officials have publicly released details of a child abuse case thanks to a change in state confidentiality laws directly inspired by Elisa's death. It is a horrific image of failure of half-hearted investigations, recordkeeping and followup monitoring, all working against the city's abused children. A month before Elisa was born, her two older half-siblings were placed in foster care after investigators determined their mother, Awilda Lopez, had left them unsupervised and admitted \"to crack use before and during the recent pregnancy,\" according to the state report .\n\n\"Interviews with the relatives established that the oldest children were left alone, unsupervised and unfed, for extended periods of time,\" the report said. Newborn Elisa who immediately tested positive for drugs was placed with a foster family. At age 5 months, she went to her father. But even in that relative stability there were signs of trouble. In March 1992, the father, Death part of a 'troubling' pattern By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS Daily News Staff Writer The city agency charged with protecting children from abuse and neglect has badly botched the vast majority of its cases, a blistering new state audit charges .\n\nThe audit, ordered by Gov. Pataki in the wake of the death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo in November, found violations of procedure in of 400 cases reviewed. Elisa's death, Pataki said, falls squarely within a \"deeply troubling\" pattern of \"incomplete, inadequate and unacceptable\" response by city caseworkers and supervisors. \"This is a systematic failure that we can no longer tolerate,\" Pataki said. \"We can no longer allow secrecy to shield the system's failures.\" The audit chronicles Breakdowns at ery step of the way in child abuse ELISA'S TRAGEDY WHERE THE BLAME LIES ROUGH JOB: Mayor Giuliani and new child welfare chief Nicholas Scoppetta MISHA ERWITT DAILY NEWS vow a new beginning .\n\ngations: failure of caseworkers to react swiftly to hotline reports of abuse, cases closed despite clear portents of future abuse, lost or missing records and failure to heed warnings about possible abuse from schools and hospitals. In one of five cases of suspected abuse or neglect, the city failed to make contact with the child within the required 24 hours. Fully half the investigations were not completed within the 60-day limit required by law. The most severe problems were in the Bronx, where caseworkers were ordered to close two cases for every one they opened. In the Bronx, of the records demanded by auditors were missing, compared with in the other boroughs .\n\nAlSo in the Bronx, 6f child 'abuse investigations Were completed on time fearful that Elisa was being abused while visiting her mother, requested that the court order supervision of those visits. But, according to the city report, that plea went unheeded. The city closed out its file on Elisa on Sept. 14, 1992, because the court had not ordered such supervision. Meanwhile, Lopez had regained custody of her other children .\n\nIn December 1993 the city investigated more allegations that she left them unattended. During the investigation, Lopez again tested positive for cocaine, which she admitted to having used for 10 years. Lopez began attending a drug program. In March 1994, she was hospitalized after a suicide attempt. Two months later she was kicked out of the drug program \"because of inappropriate behavior and sporadic attendance,\" the city report said .\n\nIn April 1994, the Lopez family moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan but their child abuse case file didn't follow them because the city failed to transfer it. As a result, the Child Welfare Administration had two open and incomplete cases on the family through November 1994, according to the state report. Things took a fateful turn for the worse when Elisa's father died in May 1994, Lopez petitioned the court to gain custody of the girl. A month after Lopez filed for custody, a cousin of Elisa's father did as well.
