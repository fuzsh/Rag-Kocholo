        "text": "Inside the chaotic emergency room at Bellevue Hospital, Frances Cave stared at the gaunt, listless figure of Elisa Izquierdo and knew that time was running out.\n\nIt was April 7, and Ms. Cave, a social worker with a nonprofit agency called Project Chance, had been watching the 6-year-old sink deeper into distress month by month. Ms. Cave and others at Project Chance were not sure why it was happening, and they did not then suspect that the girl's mother, Awilda Lopez, was abusing her.\n\nBut they knew Elisa needed help so badly that for months they had urged her placement in a psychiatric hospital. On this day, Ms. Lopez had finally agreed, but then changed her mind during the long wait in the emergency room.\n\n\"Look at her,\" Ms. Cave begged Ms. Lopez, motioning toward Elisa. \"She's dissolving in front of your eyes.\"\n\nIn that plea lay what was perhaps the last chance of rescue for Elisa. She was beaten to death seven months later in the apartment of her mother, who was charged with her murder.\n\nIn the end, the most disturbing aspect of Elisa's story is the number of similar chances that were lost. The Child Welfare Administration rejected, ignored or appears to have ineptly investigated at least seven formal reports of the girl's possible abuse or neglect, beginning in May 1994 -- the month her father died and she went to live permanently with her mother in the Rutgers Houses project on the Lower East Side.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
