        "text": "In all the ways that matter for children dependent on the city for protection, Elisa Izquierdo suffered a death foretold. Warnings of danger came not only from people who knew her personally, but from those who knew and criticized the system that failed her.\n\nYet even as Elisa's death has prompted a new investigation of that system, budget cuts appear to be compounding its chronic problems. The Child Welfare Administration is putting unprecedented pressure on its beleaguered caseworkers to close children's cases as quickly as possible -- even by a budget-driven formula.\n\nIn an internal memo dated Nov. 15, the agency's borough director in the Bronx warned child protection supervisors that they were opening too many new cases without closing old ones.\n\n\"It's extremely important that we do all we can to reverse this trend,\" wrote the director, Mayra Juliao-Nunez. \"Please encourage your workers to follow this simple mathematical equation (for every opening you should have two closings/transfers). If we do so the caseload levels will remain under control.\"\n\nAdvocates for poor children have long suspected that child protection workers labored under such pressure, but they said they were shocked by the nakedness of the written directive. They interpreted it as pushing workers not to be more efficient but to dispose of children's cases before their problems were resolved. It is unknown what effect the memo has had in the two weeks since it was issued.\n\nAsked about the memo, which was sent anonymously to The New York Times and then verified, the agency issued this one-sentence statement from a spokeswoman, Renalda Higgins: \"We encourage staff to move cases to disposition in accordance with agency procedure.\" Such mathematical equations, she added, are not part of agency procedure.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
