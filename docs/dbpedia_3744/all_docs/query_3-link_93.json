        "text": "THE ELISA TRAGEDY CRIES FOR Officials rebuffed girl and mother By RUSS BUETTNER and PAUL SCHWARTZMAN Daily News Staff Writers The city agency assigned to safeguard children from abuse apparently rebuffed pleas for help from both Elisa Izquierdo and the mother accused of beating her to death. The accounts of the Child Welfare Administration's alleged mishandling of the case emerged yesterday as the starkest examples yet in an apparent series of official lapses in the months before the 6-year-old's burned, beaten and lifeless body was found in the lower East Side apartment of her mother, Awilda Lopez. Teacher's aide Barbara Simmons said Elisa told a child welfare caseworker two years ago that Lopez hit her during weekend visits. But Elisa's complaints failed to stop the visits, Simmons said. Dr .\n\nBart O'Connor, a Brooklyn social service agency official, said Lopez turned to him for help in April after a city caseworker took no action when told that Elisa had defecated in bed and placed feces in the family refrigerator. The repeated requests for city intervention are strikingly similar to the accounts of relatives, teachers, would-be guardians and others who said they repeatedly raised suspicions that Elisa faced danger from her mother. The warnings began in 1989, when Elisa was born with signs of cocaine withdrawal. An aunt, Brunilda Rivera, told child welfare officials that Lopez was using drugs and abusing her children. Rivera said Elisa and two older siblings were taken from the mother .\n\nElisa spent much of the next four years living with her father, Gustavo Izquierdo. Even then, there were warnings. A Brooklyn Family Court chronology released yesterday shows Izquierdo complained in February 1992 that Elisa suffered bruises during weekend visits with Lopez. He filed a petition to stop the visits. The court instead let them continue, with the provision that Lopez not use physical punishment .\n\nWhen Izquierdo died in May 1994, Elisa was placed with Lopez. Phyllis Brice, an administrator at the YWCA Montessori School in Brooklyn, wrote a letter to Brooklyn Family Court Judge Phoebe Greenbaum saying she feared Elisa would be endangered by Lopez. Greenbaum said she could not recall the letter. Elisa's cousin Elsa Canizares said she, too, raised warnings in 1994 as she tried to gain legal custody of the lit- 88. 30A9 VJAG 332 .\n\nHELP tle girl. During her quest, Canizares said she voiced her fears to social worker Terry Danzig and city Child Welfare Administration caseworker Harriet Williams. Neither Danzig nor Williams could be reached yesterday. But Canizares quoted Williams as telling her that Elisa and her siblings appeared to be \"well taken care by Lopez. Even Prince Michael of Greece tried to intervene after he met Elisa at the Montessori School, which she attended before she was placed with Lopez .\n\nHe backed Canizares' custody bid and offered to pay Elisa's tuition to a private school through 12th grade. Greenbaum, however, awarded custody to Lopez, a decision that officials said was requested by Elisa and supported by a Legal Aid Society attorney serving as the girl's law guardian. Even then, the warnings to official agencies continued. O'Connor, who directs Project Chance, a Brooklyn counseling program, said Lopez turned to him in desperation in April after a Child Welfare Administration caseworker did not respond to her request for help after the feces incident. O'Connor said he called the caseworker, whom he identified yesterday from his notes as a Mr .\n\nNovolo. \"I called Novolo. I said I was recommending 24-hour, seven-days-a-week treatment for Elisa,\" said O'Connor, explaining he needed Novolo's approval before Elisa could get a psychiatric exam. \"He said, 'I'm busy, call me O'Connor said other Project SEE ELISA PAGE 28 ANDREW SAVULICH DAILY NEWS SOBBING Virgen Martinez hugs daughters (I.) outside funeral home where Elisa Izquierdo was waked.
