        "text": "Elisa Torrini is an Italian model. She was crowned Miss Universe Italy 2011 on 30 June 2011 at the Piazzale del Soccorso in Forio d'Ischia. She is 1.80 m tall, one of tallest Italian delegates ever in the history of the pageant. By winning the title, Elisa earned the right to represent her country at the Miss Universe 2011 pageant in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, on 12 September 2011. As part of her prize package, Elisa won a week-long stay in Caracas, Venezuela during the month of August to attend the prestigious Katty Pulido International Academy, where she will receive intensive training in all areas of competition to aid her preparation for the Miss Universe pageant. It is the first time an Italian representative is sent abroad to train for the international competition. This prize is part of a larger concerted effort by the new franchise holders of Miss Universe Italy to craft extremely competitive delegates in an attempt to snag the first Miss Universe crown ever for Italy, the country with the highest placements at the pageant never to have won the title. Other prizes for the winner include beauty kits, jewelry and a three-day stay at a luxurious hotel in Sardinia.\n\nElisa Pensler Gabrielli (born 3 July 1959) is an American actress, voice artist, and comedian, who played \"Pepper\" Potts in the animated movie The Invincible Iron Man, among other roles. Gabrielli also played the part of Miss Linley in The Brady Bunch Movie. In the 2005 animated film Madagascar, she was the voice of Nana, which became a breakout character that she voiced again in the 2008 sequel, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa."
