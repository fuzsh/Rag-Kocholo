        "text": "1. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s status as a second-term House member who doesn’t chair a committee belies her power as the standard-bearer for a continuing wave of progressive politicians. She is the archetype for a certain sound bite mastery and no-holds-barred intraparty conflict to the extent that being the “next AOC” has become both a coveted moniker for like-minded Democrats – and a bull’s-eye for conservatives taking aim at them. Prior to her 2018 upset win, Ocasio-Cortez had never held political office; now, the question is how high she can go?\n\n2. Robert Mujica\n\nState Budget Director\n\nA ubiquitous presence in Albany, Robert Mujica is one of the only high-level survivors of the Cuomo administration. He continues to oversee the state’s behemoth $220 billion budget for the Hochul administration in what many see as a mark of both sheer competence and influence. Raised in Brooklyn and Staten Island by Puerto Rican parents, Mujica also serves on more than 30 boards, including CUNY’s board of trustees and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, giving him purview over a huge swath of state government.\n\n3. Betty Rosa\n\nCommissioner, State Education Department\n\nThanks to her many years spent as a teacher, principal and superintendent in the Bronx, Betty Rosa has a deep understanding of the inner workings of public education in New York. Rosa took the reins of 731 school districts with over 4,400 schools on an interim basis in early 2020 – at the start of the coronavirus pandemic – and was given the role permanently last year. Prior to becoming commissioner, Rosa was chancellor of the state Board of Regents.\n\n4. Félix V. Matos Rodríguez\n\nChancellor, City University of New York\n\nFélix V. Matos Rodríguez became the first Latino steward of the citywide system of 25 campuses, including the “working man’s Harvard” of City College, in 2019. In addition to previously serving as Queens College president for almost five years, Matos Rodríguez spent four years working in the government of his native Puerto Rico. The longtime academic, who has prioritized expanding student access to growing industries, is dealing with problems ranging from funding needs to an alarming rise in antisemitic incidents at CUNY.\n\n5. Nydia Velázquez\n\nMember of Congress\n\nAround New York, it’s known that calling “Nydia” about an injustice to the Hispanic community will yield an immediate response. She arrived from her native Puerto Rico on a scholarship for a master’s degree at New York University in 1974 and got involved in politics in 1981. In nearly 30 years in Congress, Rep. Nydia Velázquez has risen to become the chair of the Small Business Committee and been a consistent sponsor of bills to encourage mom and pop commerce. In September, her favored candidate in the 10th Congressional District, New York City Council Member Carlina Rivera, fell short.\n\n6. Adriano Espaillat\n\nMember of Congress\n\nThe first formerly undocumented person in Congress, Dominican-born Rep. Adriano Espaillat’s 2017 primary victory was a referendum on the growing Latino power base forming in Upper Manhattan. Espaillat, a former member of the Assembly and state Senate, has long known how to build bridges with various constituencies. He was a consistent voice denouncing the Trump administration’s abuses of immigrants and holds leadership roles in the Hispanic Caucus, Progressive, and Latino-Jewish Caucuses. He has also elected a growing “Squadriano” of local allies, although his endorsements fizzled in September.\n\n7. Henry Garrido\n\nExecutive Director, District Council 37\n\nThere’s hardly a bigger union town than New York City, and few unions with more muscle than the public employee union District Council 37, which boasts 150,000 members working a wide array of jobs, from lifeguards and park workers to actuaries and city agency staffers. Dominican-born Henry Garrido, whose mother was a union garment worker, took over leadership at the end of 2014. He has recently been at the center of battles over retiree health benefits and the Adams administration’s insistence that all municipal workers return to the office.\n\n8. Eric Gonzalez\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney\n\nEric Gonzalez, who grew up in Bushwick and East New York in a Puerto Rican family, was thrust into the limelight when he became acting Brooklyn district attorney after the sudden 2016 death of reform-minded predecessor Ken Thompson. As a part of the office since 1995, Gonzalez was well-positioned to take charge. Gonzalez, who has since won reelection twice, has continued the office’s progressive legacy with initiatives including a policy to help noncitizens avoid disproportionate immigration-related consequences when facing low-level convictions.\n\n9. Gustavo Rivera\n\nState Senator\n\nState Sen. Gustavo Rivera survived an onslaught from the Bronx Democratic Party to vanquish primary challenger Miguelina Camilo in August. It’s just the latest uphill battle for Rivera, a reformer who knocked out the scandal-plagued Pedro Espada Jr. in 2010 to win his seat. Now, an elder statesman among Albany progressives, Rivera has long pushed for state-level single-payer health care – and assuming he continues as health committee chair, he’ll be taking the lead on health policy with longtime legislative partner Assembly Member Richard Gottfried retiring.\n\n10. Rafael Salamanca Jr.\n\nNew York City Council Member\n\nIn New York City, where few things come at a higher premium than land, City Council Land Use Committee Chair Rafael Salamanca Jr. wields considerable clout, which he often uses to try to secure more affordable housing from developers. Before winning a 2016 special election in a six-person race where he received the support of the Brooklyn Democratic machine, Salamanca served on Bronx Community Board 2 and as president of the 41st Precinct Community Council.\n\n11. Jessica Ramos\n\nState Senator\n\nQueens native state Sen. Jessica Ramos cut her teeth on local civic issues as a teenager before starting in politics as a New York City Council staffer during college. After taking on a variety of roles, including as district leader, Ramos, the daughter of Colombian immigrants, decided to run for the state Senate against a former Independent Democratic Conference member in 2018 as part of a movement angry at the IDC’s cooperation with Republicans. Her victory helped shift the balance of power in Albany – and she went on to champion worker and immigrant rights as the state Senate Labor Committee chair.\n\n12. Vincent Alvarez\n\nPresident, New York City Central Labor Council\n\nAs the first Latino president of the New York City Central Labor Council since 2011, Vincent Alvarez represents the collective interests of some 1.3 million workers across 300 unions in the city. This has put him in the middle of disputes as diverse as a strike of building doormen around the city and arguments over the operation of Staten Island ferries. Throughout it all, the former International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers member has become known for his ability to keep cool and negotiate truces.\n\n13. Ritchie Torres\n\nMember of Congress\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres became the youngest elected official in New York City history and the first openly gay legislator from the Bronx when he joined the New York City Council in 2013 at age 25 before jumping to Congress in 2021. He has attributed the achievement to his Afro Latino heritage, growing up with a Puerto Rican dad and African American mom. He has said that his focus on affordable and public housing stems from a childhood spent at the Throggs Neck Houses.\n\n14. Ydanis Rodriguez\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department of Transportation\n\nAmong the highest-ranking Latinos in the Adams administration, Dominican-born Ydanis Rodriguez arrived in the city as a fresh-faced 18-year-old and spent 15 years teaching before elected office. He then served for more than a decade in the New York City Council advocating for medallion owners, fighting to enact municipal noncitizen voting and chairing the City Council’s Transportation Committee. Now, as city Department of Transportation commissioner, Rodriguez oversees a billion-dollar budget and is aiming to make New York City more walkable and bikeable.\n\n15. Diana Ayala\n\nNew York City Council Member\n\nNew York City Council Member Diana Ayala was a top contender in the crowded contest to serve as speaker of the city’s legislative body, a position previously held by her mentor, Melissa Mark-Viverito. While she fell short, the Puerto Rico native was savvy enough to step aside and back the eventual speaker, Adrienne Adams, while landing a plum post as deputy speaker. Ayala also chairs the Committee on General Welfare, which has been scrutinizing the lack of shelter space for homeless people.\n\n16. Julia Salazar\n\nState Senator\n\nMiami-born Democratic Socialist state Sen. Julia Salazar has always been an activist and organizer, getting involved in campus organizing at Columbia University and later focusing on police reform. Salazar, who overcame a flurry of controversies about her upbringing and background during her 2018 Democratic primary race to handily defeat longtime incumbent Martin Malavé Dilan, is now chair of the state Senate Crime and Correction Committee, where she has been a notable supporter of sex worker rights.\n\n17. Nicole Malliotakis\n\nMember of Congress\n\nWhere others might be cowed by being the only Republican member of Congress from New York City, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis seems to revel in her outsider position. For example, she ran against then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2017 for his position as mayor in a race she was almost guaranteed to lose; she then defeated incumbent Democratic Rep. Max Rose the following year. Malliotakis, the daughter of a Cuban mother and Greek father, is a Trump supporter – but also voted in favor of Democrats’ recent infrastructure bill.\n\n18. Zellnor Myrie\n\nState Senator\n\nRaised by parents who immigrated to Crown Heights from Costa Rica, state Sen. Zellnor Myrie was part of the wave of young progressives who took down the Independent Democratic Conference in 2018, when he defeated incumbent Jesse Hamilton by a comfortable margin. Myrie knows his way around the technicalities of legislation, having served previously as a New York City Council legislative director. He has been a vocal defender against rollbacks to the controversial 2019 bail reform, of which he was a co-sponsor.\n\n19. Antonio Delgado\n\nLieutenant Governor\n\nThis time last year, no one expected then-Rep. Antonio Delgado to be named second-in-command of state government – including Delgado himself – but the sequence of Andrew Cuomo’s resignation as governor, Gov. Kathy Hochul’s elevation and former Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin’s own fall from grace had the domino effect of putting the Schenectady native on the primary ballot, which he won a month after his swearing-in. Delagado – whose Afro Latino roots came into question before he clarified that his roots include Cape Verde, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia – had represented Congressional District 19 since 2019.\n\n20. Nathalia Fernandez\n\nAssembly Member\n\nGrowing up largely in Rockland County with a Cuban father and a formerly undocumented Colombian mother, Nathalia Fernandez always felt more at home in the Bronx. In 2018, when her former boss Mark Gjonaj won a seat on the New York City Council, Fernandez, who had been working as then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s representative in the Bronx, ran a successful campaign for Gjonaj’s old Assembly seat. Now she’s on the move again, having won the pivotal Democratic nomination for an open state Senate seat.\n\n21. Antonio Reynoso\n\nBrooklyn Borough President\n\nAntonio Reynoso, the Williamsburg-born son of Dominican immigrant parents, hasn’t let what is often considered a semiceremonial role stop him from making his mark on Brooklyn, pledging to combat NIMBYism and improve maternal health. Prior to becoming Brooklyn borough president this year, Reynoso served two terms on the New York City Council, succeeding Diana Reyna – for whom he was chief of staff – where he wasn’t shy about taking controversial stances, as exemplified by the ultimately unsuccessful plan to rezone Bushwick.\n\n22. Kenny Burgos, Catalina Cruz, Maritza Davila, Erik Dilan, Jessica González-Rojas, Marcela Mitaynes, Phil Ramos, Karines Reyes, Jonathan Rivera & Amanda Septimo\n\nAssembly Members\n\nOnly 14 Latinos serve in the Assembly, exactly the same as a decade ago, and they make up just under 10% of the legislative body’s 150 seats – even as Hispanics account for nearly 20% of the state’s population. Despite this lack of representation, however, many of New York’s Latino lawmakers punch above their weight. Assembly Members Catalina Cruz, the sponsor of the Clean Slate Act, and Kenny Burgos, whose district includes Rikers Island, have been on the forefront of recent criminal justice reform efforts. Assembly Member Karines Reyes, who identifies as Afro Latina, championed the New York HERO Act, a worker safety measure, and is a proactive legislator on a number of fronts. Assembly Member Maritza Davila chairs the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force, which oversees the popular Somos conference. Assembly Member Jessica González-Rojas, who previously led the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, has sought to increase abortion access in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned. Another first-term lawmaker, Assembly Member Amanda Septimo, has pushed for greener transportation systems. Assembly Member Erik Dilan fended off a Democratic Socialists of America-backed primary challenger this year, but another DSA-backed Brooklynite, Marcela Mitaynes, is coasting to a second term. While Assembly Member Nathalia Fernandez is moving up to the state Senate, Assembly Member Phil Ramos of Long Island lost his state Senate primary bid to comeback candidate Monica Martinez. Another non-New York City incumbent, Jonathan Rivera, is making his mark in Western New York. Two other incumbents, Manny De Los Santos and Yudelka Tapia, won special elections but have served for less than a year, while longtime lawmaker José Rivera is on his way out after losing to primary challenger George Alvarez this year.\n\n23. Havidán Rodríguez\n\nPresident, University at Albany\n\nIn 2017, Havidán Rodríguez, who grew up shuttling between Puerto Rico and the Bronx, became the first Latino SUNY president when he was named to lead the University at Albany. The appointment was a homecoming of sorts for Rodríguez, who had been serving in an executive role at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Prior to coming to Albany, Rodríguez conducted significant research on topics like disaster preparedness and socioeconomic conditions among minority communities.\n\n24. Carlina Rivera\n\nNew York City Council Member\n\nFollowing the pipelines of both nonprofit executive and legislative staffer to elected official, Carlina Rivera put in her time as director of programs for nonprofit organization Good Old Lower East Side and as a legislative director for then-New York City Council Member Rosie Mendez. As chair of the City Council Criminal Justice Committee, she has sparred with New York City Mayor Eric Adams on his enforcement-focused approach to crime. And though she didn’t win, Rivera was a strong candidate in the newly redrawn 10th Congressional District’s Democratic primary.\n\n25. Luis Miranda Jr., Eduardo Castell & Catherine Torres\n\nFounding Partner; Managing Partner; Partner, MirRam Group\n\nLuis Miranda Jr., MirRam Group founder and partner, has worked as a representative of the Latino community in various political and cultural board positions. His company has become one of the most influential political consulting and strategic communications groups in New York, thanks in no small part to the contributions of Eduardo Castell and Catherine Torres, who are partners of the firm and have each previously worked as public servants dealing with the array of issues facing minority communities in New York City. MirRam Group has advocated for equal treatment for Puerto Ricans in the United States and is a supporter of the Unity March for Puerto Rico.\n\n26. José M. Serrano\n\nState Senator\n\nA recognizable family name can be both a blessing and a curse in politics, but onetime New York City Council member and longtime South Bronx state Sen. José M. Serrano is forging a path distinct from that of his father, Puerto Rico-born former Rep. José E. Serrano. As chair of the state Senate Cultural Affairs, Tourism, Parks and Recreation Committee, Serrano has been a champion for an arts industry that was heavily battered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n27. Shaun Abreu, Alexa Avilés, Tiffany Cabán, Carmen De La Rosa, Amanda Farías, Oswald Feliz, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Christopher Marte, Francisco Moya, Sandy Nurse, Pierina Sanchez & Marjorie Velázquez\n\nNew York City Council Members\n\nMost of the New York City Council’s Latino members are still in their first year in office. One exception is Council Member Francisco Moya, a veteran lawmaker who was New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ pick for council speaker but fell short. Council Member Oswald Feliz also took office before most of his colleagues, winning a special election in the spring of 2021. Other than Diana Ayala, Rafael Salamanca Jr. and Carlina Rivera, the rest of the legislative body’s Latino contingent took office this year. Among the notable members of the group are Council Member Carmen De La Rosa, a Rep. Adriano Espaillat ally who previously served in the Assembly, and Tiffany Cabán, a progressive who previously came close to winning the Queens district attorney race. Two Bronxites, Amanda Farías and Marjorie Velázquez, ran in 2017 and lost, but saw their respective rivals decline to seek reelection ahead of the 2021 race. Council Member Pierina Sanchez is in a key role as chair of the Housing and Buildings Committee, while Council Member Alexa Avilés chairs the Public Housing Committee, Council Member Jennifer Gutiérrez chairs the Technology Committee, Council Member Sandy Nurse chairs the Sanitation and Solid Waste Management Committee and Council Member Shaun Abreu – another Espaillat protege – chairs the State and Federal Legislation Committee.\n\n28. Adolfo Carrión Jr.\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development\n\nA former Bronx borough president and Obama administration official, Adolfo Carrión Jr. was selected by New York City Mayor Eric Adams to lead the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development as City Hall seeks to address the housing crisis and encourage more affordable housing construction. Carrión left his role as an executive vice president at Stagg Group, one of the Bronx’s largest affordable housing developers, to take the job.\n\n29. Louis Molina\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department of Correction\n\nIt is perhaps the least enviable task in New York City government to reform the Rikers Island jail complex, a crisis that has persisted for years. Louis Molina, the Bronx-born son of Puerto Rican parents and a former public safety chief of Las Vegas, was tapped by New York City Mayor Eric Adams to clean up the mess. In the months since, despite mounting criticism from numerous stakeholders, Molina has maintained his commitment to improving conditions and avoiding receivership.\n\n30. Ana Oliveira\n\nPresident and CEO, The New York Women’s Foundation\n\nEven after decades of advocating and providing services for women and LGBTQ people, The New York Women’s Foundation head Ana Oliveira’s work is never done, as typified by her springing into action to promote candidates committed to protecting abortion rights following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The São Paulo-born Oliveira led the Gay Men’s Health Crisis for seven years before taking over the foundation in 2006, where she’s overseen a significant expansion of its grant-making capabilities.\n\n31. Theo Oshiro, Arlenis Morel & Jose Lopez\n\nCo-Executive Directors, Make the Road New York\n\nIt might seem cumbersome for an organization to have three executive directors, but each has been working with the organization, Make the Road New York, for more than 15 years, advocating and organizing on causes from police reform to New York City’s sanctuary policies to medical care for immigrants. Theo Oshiro and Arlenis Morel are both themselves immigrants, having arrived in the city from Peru and Venezuela, respectively, while Jose Lopez hails from Bushwick. The trio took over last April, one year into a pandemic that both energized and strained community organizations around New York. Their organization, notched a victory in December when New York City legalized noncitizen voting, although the law was overturned this summer.\n\n32. Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department for the Aging\n\nPeople 65 years or older make up 16.4% of New York City’s population – and that number is projected to increase to 20% by 2035. New York City Department for the Aging’s Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez supports that growing population by leading the way on key initiatives like meal programs for the elderly, increasing the reimbursement rate for home-delivered meals to make the program sustainable and securing funding for vehicles to deliver food to older adults.\n\n33. Robert Rodriguez\n\nNew York State Secretary of State\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul nominated Robert Rodriguez, who previously spent 11 years as an Assembly member, to serve as the state’s secretary of state in 2021. With a background in finance, Rodriguez has been able to facilitate the state’s investing in housing projects that aided low-income and diverse communities. During his time in the Assembly, he was an advocate for affordable housing – and he continues to tackle discriminatory housing practices today.\n\n34. Julissa Gutierrez\n\nChief Diversity Officer, Executive Chamber\n\nWith more than two decades of experience working to improve diversity and civic engagement, Julissa Gutierrez was the natural choice to become the state’s chief diversity officer in 2020. She has since helped increase the registration rate of minority- and women-owned business enterprises in the state to 30.51% – the highest percentage in the nation. Her commitment to women and minorities is also exemplified by her past work with the Anti-Defamation League and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.\n\n35. Tonio Burgos & Elvin García\n\nFounder and CEO; Director of New York City Affairs, TBA\n\nTonio Burgos has long been one of New York’s most influential Latino lobbyists, having built TBA into a powerhouse. His firm, formerly known as Tonio Burgos & Associates, operates in the tri-state area, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico and has clients in such sectors as energy, transportation, health care and education. Burgos served in the Mario Cuomo and Hugh Carey administrations before launching TBA over three decades ago. Elvin García came on as the firm’s director of New York City affairs a little over a year ago after stops at the Open Society Foundations, the Hispanic Federation and as Bronx borough director for City Hall.\n\n36. Manuel Castro\n\nCommissioner, New York City Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs\n\nAs the Adams administration’s top immigration official, Commissioner Manuel Castro is dealing directly with the influx of undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers being bused to the state from Texas. Castro, a Mexican immigrant himself, has been welcoming them with open arms – in fact, City Hall’s efforts to educate and provide services to these newcomers is dubbed “Project Open Arms.” Castro previously spent more than six years leading New Immigrant Community Empowerment, an organization supporting immigrant workers.\n\n37. Annabel Palma\n\nChair and Commissioner, New York City Commission on Human Rights\n\nReappointed this year as commissioner and chair of the New York City Commission on Human Rights by Mayor Eric Adams, Annabel Palma leads the civil rights legislation of New York City. Palma worked to ensure all New York City residents were vaccinated against COVID-19 and to increase access to vaccines as the chief equity officer of the Test & Trace Corps. In addition to her work with the city, Palma has been an influential organizer for inclusion and unionizing.\n\n38. Frankie Miranda\n\nPresident and CEO, Hispanic Federation\n\nActing as a de facto umbrella organization for Hispanic-focused nonprofits nationwide, the Hispanic Federation, which is led by President and CEO Frankie Miranda, is a leading voice on the issues affecting Hispanic communities in New York and around the country. Having risen through the organization’s ranks since 2006, Miranda has helped increase its national presence by managing expansion in Florida and Puerto Rico. He now oversees operations that run the gamut from disaster relief to improving health outcomes.\n\n39. José A. Pagán\n\nBoard Chair, NYC Health + Hospitals\n\nNo municipal agency or department was spared the monumental impact of COVID-19, including the city’s sprawling public hospital system at the center of the pandemic, with emergency rooms overflowing and health care providers at grave personal risk. Pagán, who has served as NYC Health + Hospitals’ board chair since 2019, isn’t a medical doctor but a health economist, which has helped in his efforts to change how New Yorkers can get better access to coronavirus-related health care.\n\n40. Fernando Delgado\n\nPresident, Lehman College\n\nIn 2021, Fernando Delgado became the fourth president of Lehman College, an institution that serves the Hispanic community in the Bronx and the surrounding region. Delgado, who has 20 years of public college administrative experience, was the first in his family to go to college. Among his other accomplishments, he has done extensive research on Latino identity and culture. This year, under his leadership, the first public business school in the Bronx and Westchester was created at Lehman.\n\n41. Cesar Perales\n\nVice Chair, SUNY Board of Trustees\n\nThe foundation of Cesar Perales’ career has been his early work to represent poor New Yorkers, which led to the establishment of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, an organization devoted to defending the human and civil rights of Latinos. He also previously served as the secretary of state for New York from 2011 to 2016. As the vice chair of the SUNY board of trustees, Perales works to create more equality and equity in New York.\n\n42. Guillermo Chacón\n\nPresident, Latino Commission on AIDS\n\nA fierce advocate of educating people about the effects of HIV, sexually transmitted infections and hepatitis on Hispanic and Latino communities, Guillermo Chacón has served as the president of the Latino Commission on AIDS since 2010. He led the commission’s founding of the Hispanic Health Network, which is dedicated to fighting the disparities in health for Hispanics. Chacón has also served on the state COVID-19 Vaccine Equity Task Force.\n\n43. Roberto Lacayo\n\nNews Director, Spectrum Noticias NY1\n\nNY1 is must-see TV for New York politicos, and for New York City’s many politically engaged Spanish speakers, the station’s affiliated NY1 Noticias is equally essential. Lacayo took the reins in 2014 after working as a reporter for Univisión Channel 41 and at Telemundo Channel 52 in Los Angeles. His encouragement of reporters to integrate themselves into communities left the station well-positioned to effectively cover the pandemic’s impact on residents around the city.\n\n44. Sonia Ossorio\n\nPresident, NOW New York\n\nThis year has already seen a nationwide shortage of baby formula, the overturning of Roe v. Wade and an alarming rise in violence against women in New York City. Advocating for the rights of women in this fraught climate is Sonia Ossorio. Most recently, Ossorio has been pushing to get the federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act – which would prevent people from being fired for being pregnant or not being provided adequate medical support – passed with bipartisan support.\n\n45. Teresa Gonzalez, Prisca Salazar-Rodriguez & Keyla Espinal Antigua\n\nPartner; Partner; Vice President of Government Affairs, Bolton-St. Johns\n\nTeresa Gonzalez and Prisca Salazar-Rodriguez are partners at Bolton-St. Johns, the public relations firm that serves a wide range of public- and private-sector organizations. Keyla Espinal Antigua is the organization’s vice president of government affairs. Prior to joining Bolton-St. Johns, each of them gained experience in helping the residents of New York City and having positive impacts on the community: Gonzalez served as deputy press secretary at the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs during the Bloomberg administration; Salazar-Rodriguez worked as director of executive operations and scheduling for then-New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, among other positions; and Espinal Antigua was assistant director of public policy at Children’s Aid, one of the oldest and largest nonprofits in New York City.\n\n46. Grace Bonilla\n\nPresident and CEO, United Way of New York City\n\nSince she succeeded New York City Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright as president of United Way of New York City this summer, Grace Bonilla has made sure her organization remains at the forefront of advocacy for low-income New Yorkers, through the implementation of programs designed to increase economic mobility, improve grade-level reading and strengthen access to workforce development programs. She brings an extensive background in politics to her work, including stints at the New York City Human Resources Administration, where she worked to increase access to food and benefits for low-income communities.\n\n47. Michael Nieves\n\nPresident and CEO, Hispanic Information Television Network\n\nAs president and CEO of HITN, Mike Nieves has played a crucial role in generating Spanish-language content for Hispanic audiences on key issues like the 2016 election, when he produced the program, “Tu Momento,” in which he explained the complex U.S. electoral process. Nieves has worked as a strategic adviser to local politicians and unions such as Transit Workers Union Local 100, and he also serves as secretary of the Somos Puerto Rico conference, one of the most important political events for Latinos.\n\nEditor’s note: Michael Nieves is a member of City & State’s advisory board.\n\n48. Paloma Izquierdo-Hernandez\n\nPresident and CEO, Urban Health Plan\n\nAt the helm of Urban Health Plan is Paloma Izquierdo-Hernandez, who has been a key figure in shaping the health center’s evolution. In 1974, Urban Health Plan was a community group practice for Hispanic and impoverished residents in the Bronx.
