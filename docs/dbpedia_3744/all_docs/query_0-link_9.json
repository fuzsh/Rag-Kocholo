        "text": "When Awilda Lopez took her first hit of crack cocaine on the hardscrabble streets of Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 1988, she crossed the shadowy divide that separates tough urban poverty from mind-numbing neglect.\n\nIn a matter of months, Ms. Lopez lost everything to the drug, according to the accounts of several friends and relatives. First, she lost her junior high school sweetheart, then her rundown apartment on Knickerbocker Avenue and finally her three oldest children, Rubensito, Kasey and baby Elisa. Now, Ms. Lopez, 29, stands charged in the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa, who died last week from blows so severe her brain hemorrhaged. Elisa will be buried on Wednesday.\n\nDrugs took her away from us,\" Brunilda Rivera said of Ms. Lopez, her sister. \"She entered into another world.\"\n\nMs. Lopez, a native of Puerto Rico and one of 13 children, grew up in the heart of the inner city, always one misstep away from falling prey to her neighborhood's worst temptations, friends and relatives said.\n\nEarly on, her mother, Matilde Collazo, held out some hope that Ms. Lopez would break the cycle of welfare and dashed hopes at home and in the neighborhood. Her little girl came home from Public School 145 with honors certificates and good attendance awards, paper trophies Ms. Collazo cherished. The girl was curious, sociable and well adjusted.\n\nWhen Ms. Lopez entered Intermediate School 111, she put aside her childish airs and jumped headlong into adolescent dating rituals. Eager for a taste of full-fledged adulthood, she fixed her eye on Ruben Rivera, a schoolmate she envisioned as the father of her children. Soon, he became just that.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
