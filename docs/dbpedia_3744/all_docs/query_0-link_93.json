During her quest, Can-izares said she voiced her fears to social worker Terry Danzig and city Child Welfare Administration caseworker Harriet Will ianis .\n\nNeither Danzig nor Williams could be reached yesterday. But Canizares quoted Williams as telling her that Elisa and her siblings appeared to be \"well taken care of by Lopez. Even Prince Michael of Greece tried to intervene after he met Elisa at the Montessori School, which she attended before she was placed with Lopez. He backed Canizares' custody bid and offered to pay Elisa's tuition to a private school through 12th grade Greenbaum, however, awarded custody to Lopez, a decision that officials said was requested by Elisa and supported by a Legal Aid Society attorney serving as the girl's law guardian. Even then, the warnings to official agencies continued .\n\nO'Connor, who directs Project Chance, a Brooklyn counseling program, said Lopez turned to him in desperation in April after a Child Welfare Administration caseworker did not respond to her request for help after the feces incident. O'Connor said he called the caseworker, whom he identified yesterday from his notes as a Mr. Novolo. \"I called Novolo. I said I was recommending 24-hour, sev-en-days-a-week treatment for Elisa,\" said O'Connor, explaining he needed Novolo's approval before Elisa could get a psychiatric exam .\n\n\"He said, 'I'm busy, call me O'Connor said other Project v-v hi iu -y i i By RUSS BUETTNEH and PAUL SCHWARTZMAN Daily News Staff Wrrters The city agency assigned to safeguard children from abuse apparently rebuffed pleas for help from both Elisa Izquierdo and the mother accused of beating her to death. The accounts of the Child Welfare Administration's alleged mishandling of the case emerged yesterday as the starkest examples yet in an apparent series of official lapses in the months before the 6-year-old's burned, beaten and lifeless body was found in the lower East Side apartment of her mother, Awilda Lopez. Teacher's aide Barbara Simmons said Elisa told a child welfare caseworker two years ago that Lopez hit her during weekend visits. But Elisa's complaints failed to stop the visits, Simmons said. Dr .\n\nBart O'Connor, a Brooklyn social service agency official, said Lopez turned to him for help in April after a city caseworker took no action when told that Elisa had defecated in bed and placed feces in the family refrigerator. The repeated requests for city intervention are strikingly similar to the accounts of relatives, teachers, would-be guardians and others who said they repeatedly raised suspicions that Elisa faced danger from her mother. The warnings began in 1989, when Elisa was born with signs of cocaine withdrawal. An aunt, Brunilda Rivera, told child welfare officials that Lopez was using drugs and abusing her children. Rivera said Elisa and two older siblings were taken from the mother .\n\nElisa spent much of the next four years living with her father, Gustavo Izquierdo. Even then, there were warnings. A Brooklyn Family Court chronology released yesterday shows Izquierdo complained in February 1992 that Elisa suffered bruises during weekend visits with Lopez. He filed a petition to stop the visits. The court instead let them continue, with the provision that Lopez not use physical punishment When Izquierdo died in May 1994, Elisa was placed with Lopez .\n\nPhyllis Brice, an administrator at the YWCA Mon-tessori School in Brooklyn, wrote a letter to Brooklyn Family Court Judge Phoebe Greenbaum saying she feared Elisa would be endangered by Lopez. Greenbaum said she could not recall the letter. Elisa's cousin Elsa Cani-zares said she, too, raised warnings in 1994 as she tried to gain legal custody of the lit til SEE EUSA PAGE 28 HOWARD SIMMONS OAILV NEWS i HQ fb eass -1 lisiiiii vo, who died of cancer in May 1994. After that, she went to live with her mother in Manhattan where she was killed last week. Yesterday, those who knew the child and those who were touched by her tragedy streamed through the Ponce Funeral Home on Central Ave .\n\nin Brooklyn for a second day to say farewell. \"Elisa: We shall forever miss you. Forgive us for we were not there,\" read one note left in her coffin. Mayor Giuliani joined the mourners last night, briefly in CD A priest who will preside at Elisa Izquierdo's funeral urged yesterday that her mother not be judged too harshly. \"The mother could be seen by some as a monster, a beast,\" the Rev .\n\nGianni Agos-tinelli said of Awilda Lopez, who was indicted yesterday in 6-year-old Elisa's slaying. Agostinelli, pastor of St. Joseph's Patron Church in Bushwick, Brooklyn, said, \"There must be some room for hope for the mother. We cannot just condemn her. There must also be room for conversion and repentance.\" Elisa once lived in Bushwick with her father, Gusta- S3 HOWARD SIMMONS DAILY NEWS to a tn a iiittuiig wiui xuim FORGIVENESS: The Rev .\n\nGianni Agostinelli says there must be 'room for conversion and repentance\" for Awilda Lopez. ."
