        "text": "The inattention and ineptitude of child welfare workers that led to the death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo was far from unique, but was echoed in hundreds of cases of other abused children in the same period, according to a New York State report released yesterday.\n\nThe state audit, prompted by the beating death last year that generated vast publicity and an overhaul of New York City's child protection agency, offered new evidence of a persistent failure by the system to perform even the most rudimentary responsibilities.\n\nIn one out of five cases reviewed by state auditors, the report said, caseworkers failed to conduct face-to-face interviews with all the children in a home. In two out of five cases, the caseworkers failed to check past child abuse reports. And in 10 percent of the cases, the agency did not begin to investigate an initial report within the 24-hour period required by its rules.\n\n\"In the aggregate, these findings represent an incomplete, inadequate and unacceptable child protective response,\" the State Social Services report stated. Last year, the city's Child Welfare Administration handled 47,000 cases, and the state audit reviewed 369 at random from the last three months of 1995.\n\nThe audit was released as the city and the state issued two exhaustive reports chronicling the death of Elisa and the system's failure to protect her from harm.\n\nTime after time, the reports showed, Elisa's case came to the attention of city caseworkers, teachers, doctors and other social workers, but the system broke down repeatedly and opportunities to protect her were squandered.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
