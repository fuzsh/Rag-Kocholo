Girl's monster is everywhere here's no way to forget in how her the coffin little in girl a looked pretty white First Communion dress. Elisa didn't look like a little girl anymore. she looked like a wooden statue, her face in pancake makeup permanently affixed into a horrible grimace. There was no resemblance to the girl she used to be .\n\nIt was the best they could do with the small. battered face. Maybe Elisa's terrible expression was the same just before her mother. Awilda Lopez. allegedly killed her for being possessed by the Devil .\n\nI tried not to. but couldn't help conjuring images of how my own daughter looked when she received her First Communion. She. too, had on a white dress. with flowers in her hair a child loved beyond reason .\n\nwhich is the only. way. really, to love a child. Some people in Elisa's short life understood this.

They wouldn't let me help her.\" she screamed in Spanish. Brunilda followed the miniature coffin out of the funeral parlor cursing Awilda Lopez .\n\n\"She mustn't She's right. But a monster like this should have stopped living long ago. A monster who is accused of allowing a child to be sexually abused. who herself allegedly sexually abused a little kid with a hair- LINDA STASI brush should simply not be walking among us. A monster who does crack while pregnant knowing that her baby will be born with the same addiction that she can't .\n\nor won't. kick herself should never have custody of that child. Ever. People like this never seem to die of their addictions soon enough. But who are we kidding? This kind of abuse goes on every day in every borough, in every city, in every state .\n\nKim Doino, a pediatric emergency room nurse at Bellevue Hospital. told me about a crack addiet father who brought his 2- month old daughter into the emergency room a few years ago after trying to have sex with her. \"He was so high he didn't have any idea of what he was doing or what he'd done.\" she said. The cops got called in and the filthy pig was arrested. They were able to do that because he was so stoned .\n\nChild Welfare always takes it from there. Too often. especially with budget cuts. they take it nowhere. One mourner at Elisa's funeral who's trying to take it somewhere is Enrique Lugo, director of the Instituto Nacional de Proteccion al Menor .\n\nan organization he formed to stop child abuse in the Latin American community. \"I myself am a survivor of abuse.\" he said. something like, this happens. everybody goes crazy, and then some politician has a an affair and everybody forgets all about it. \"I've told the authorities about 6 to 12-year-old children who are adopted in the Dominican Republic and brought here for child prostitution and pornography .\n\nNobody gives a damn maybe because I'm not a politician.\" ou'd think he just but another then angry another advocate, child dies of abuse and we all remember that right now, right this second. another kid in another part of the city is screaming in terror and nobody is listening. Maybe we should all be forced to hang out in a pediatric emergency room for a while. Then we can see who the devils really are. ."
