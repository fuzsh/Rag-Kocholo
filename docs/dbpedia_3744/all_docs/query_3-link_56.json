        "text": "The context does not provide sufficient information about an abuse and murdered case of a child named \"ild.\" However, it does mention several cases of child abuse and murder.\n\nFor instance, Elisa Izquierdo, a six-year-old Puerto Rican-Cuban-American girl, was murdered by her mother, Awilda Lopez, in 1995. Lopez physically, mentally, emotionally, and sexually abused her daughter for months before causing a fatal brain hemorrhage [1] [2].\n\nIn another case, Taylor Schabusiness is on trial for the murder and necrophilia of Shad Thyrion, a 25-year-old man who was killed and dismembered in his mother's basement in February 2022 [3].\n\nAdditionally, the context lists several other cases of child abuse and murder, such as the Sharpe family murders, the murder of Laree Slack, the death of Kelsey Smith-Briggs, the murder of Harriet Staunton, the death of Lisa Steinberg, the Joel Steinberg case, the murder of Malachi Subecz, the Sugamo child abandonment case, and the JonBen√©t Ramsey case [4]. However, the details of these cases are not provided in the context.\n\nInformation is missing on the specific case of a child named \"ild\" and the results of the abuse and murder case."
