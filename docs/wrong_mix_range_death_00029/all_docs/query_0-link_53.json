        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs always, greetings to all readers of \"Daltons in History\"!!\n\nI am writing this from Calgary in Canada where Kate and I have just arrived towards the end of this year’s North American travels. Our son James lives and works in Calgary and we arrived here on 17 June. Two days later we set off on a 3,000 mile round trip over the Rockies to Vancouver, down to Portland, Oregon and then on to Crater Lake National Park in the south west corner of Oregon. From there we travelled east across Oregon and Idaho to Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, and then back to Calgary via Glacier and Waterton Lakes National Parks on the USA/Canadian border. Here in Calgary we are enjoying the famous Calgary Stampede, which this year celebrates its centenary. Although the trip has not included anything specifically connected with Dalton family history, I am including a few photographs to show you some of the highlights of the trip.\n\nChinatown in Portland, Oregon\n\nTotem poles in Stanley Park, Vancouver\n\nCrater Lake, Oregon\n\nwhich is 8,000 feet above sea level\n\nand where 8 inches of snow had fallen\n\nthe night before we were there on 26 June, 2012!\n\nA mural in Klamath Falls,\n\nin the south west corner of Oregon,\n\ndepicting the arrival of the railroad in the west in 1909\n\nA bald eagle in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming\n\nPetrified tree at the Craters of the Moon\n\nNational Monument in Idaho\n\nThe famous Old Faithful geyser\n\nin Yellowstone National Park\n\nA grizzly bear crosses the road right in front of us\n\nin Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta\n\n..... and finally the start of the Calgary Stampede\n\nCentenary Parade watched by 150,000 people\n\nlining the streets of downtown Calgary\n\nBy the time you read this we will be back home and concentrating on the 2012 DGS Gathering which, of course, takes place at the end of July.\n\nAs always, you will find below all the latest news about DGS events and activities, together with other updates to keep you fully informed about what we are doing.\n\nThe 2012 DGS Gathering in Yorkshire\n\nThe 2012 Gathering and AGM in Yorkshire over the weekend of Fri/Sat/Sun 27th/28th/29th July 2012 is now, as I write, in just three weeks time. The venue for this event is the Mercure Hull West Hotel, situated between Hull, with a number of interesting Dalton connections, and Beverley with its Minster and excellent Record Office. The arrangements for the 2012 gathering have been published and they can be found in the “Forthcoming Gatherings\" section of this website or just click here. These include the planned programme for the weekend, together with full details about costs, registration and booking. This has proved to be a popular event for both UK and overseas members, and officially our final deadline for registration has now passed. However, if you still wish to join us and have not already registered, it may still be possible to fit you in. Anyone still interested in attending either the whole of the event or parts of it should contact me immediately by email (michaelndalton@aol.com) and I will do my best to assist in securing accommodation for you and adding you to the attendance lists for the various events during the weekend.\n\nI am most grateful to Howard Dalton of Pickering for taking on the task of Gathering Organiser. Howard is a past DGS Treasurer and well known to many DGS members. He organised previous DGS Gatherings in Scarborough in 1992 and in Pickering in 2002. In April Howard and I finalised the arrangements with the hotel and checked out each element of the programme for the weekend. There was a report in the May 2012 issue of \"Daltons in History\" on a number of exciting details that have now been confirmed. This was part of a series of articles about Yorkshire Daltons and the County of Yorkshire, which have been published month by month in the lead up to the event itself. All these articles can now be found in the \"Forthcoming Gatherings\" section of this website and they include the following:\n\nJan 2012 – \"The link between the Dalton of Thurnham Line and the Yorkshire Daltons\". This article originally appeared in the very first issue of the DGS Journal back in 1970.\n\nFeb 2012 – \"The Dalton Jamboree – 9th May 1982\". This appeared in DGSJ Vol 11 No 1 published in July 1982 and tells of a gathering of the descendants of an 18th century Dalton, who was a blacksmith in Garton-on-the-Wolds where we will be visiting over the weekend. The Jamboree was organised by Howard in the village 30 years ago.\n\nMar 2012 – \"Yorkshire Daltons\". This article was written by the late Major General John Dalton, a descendant of the Daltons who were Mayors of Hull in the 16th Century. It was first published in 1974 in DGSJ Vol 5 and it traces the line from Hull to the present day with many a story of the trials and tribulations of the family through 500 years.\n\nApr 2012 – \"David Hockney and the Yorkshire countryside\". Here Kate Dalton takes up the theme of the recent Hockney Exhibition at the Royal Academy in London, which concentrates on David Hockney’s native Yorkshire and the prolific studies he has made of the Yorkshire countryside.\n\nMay 2012 – \"Yorkshire Dalton Places\". This describes the visit that Howard and I made in April, referred to above.\n\nJun 2012 – \"2012 Annual General Meeting – Agenda\". The DGS AGM will take place on the Saturday morning as part of our conference and the formal agenda for this meeting can be found by clicking here.\n\nEverything is in place for what we hope will be an exciting, interesting and informative weekend. For those of you who are attending we very much look forward to welcoming you to Hull at the end of the month. Individual details of your bookings and other information about the programme, including joining instructions, are due to be emailed to all delegates shortly. If these have not been received by 15 July, please let me know. For those who are unable to be with us, we will of course be reporting on the Gathering here in the August 2012 edition of \"Daltons in History\", and in the DGS Journal.\n\nFuture DGS events\n\nFor 2013 we are returning to Ireland. We will be based in Dublin, as we were in 2005, and the event will take place over the weekend of Fri/Sat/Sun 26th/27th/28th July 2013. It is planned that we will stay at the Ashling Hotel, where we were accommodated in 2005. Since then the hotel has been considerably refurbished and I am confident that we will be very well looked after. You can see more about the Ashling Hotel on www.ashlinghotel.ie. Ciaran Dalton, our Irish Secretary and Chieftain of Clan Dalton, and I are now working to put a detailed programme together, and further details will be provided at our Hull Gathering, on this website and in the DGS Journal. In the meantime please reserve the dates in your diary. We will hope to see many DGS members there and particularly those with Irish Dalton ancestry.\n\nFor 2014 and beyond we have a number of suggestions already. But, if you have any particular thoughts about where you might like to meet, or a particular Dalton theme you think we should incorporate, we would really like to hear from you with your ideas.\n\nThe Dalton International DNA Project (DIDP)\n\nWe are indebted to our DNA consultant, Chris Pomery for all his assistance with the project over the past six years, which includes the preparation of three issues of the very comprehensive project progress report, and most recently a series of six reports covering individual genetic families. He has also given informative presentations at our annual gatherings on three occasions. We now have approaching 180 participants in the project, and well over 80% of these are members of one of the 15 identified genetic families. The latest DIDP update was published in February and can be found in the \"Dalton DNA Project\" section of this website or just click here. This reviews the current status of the project and looks ahead with our plans for further work in 2012.\n\nThe DGS Journal\n\nVolume 56 of the DGS Journal for June 2012 is due to be published shortly and will be posted out to members as soon as available. Any member who has not received their copy by the end of August should contact their local secretary in the first instance.\n\nA list of the contents of Volume 56 will be found below as part of this issue of \"Daltons in History\". As always this latest volume of our award winning Journal contains much of interest and, if you are not a DGS member, please think about joining the Society. This will entitle you to receive the Journal regularly, and much more. Full details are in the \"Join the DGS\" section of this website, or just click here.\n\nJohn always welcomes articles and other items for publication in the Journal. Any material for publication should be sent to him as early as possible, so that he can plan the content of future issues. John is happy to advise and assist contributors and, if you have any questions or need help, please contact him by email at johndalton78@hotmail.com.\n\nBack issues of the DGS Journal continue to be available. On this website you can access the \"DGS Journal Index\" from the homepage or by clicking here. Here you will find a full synopsis of the contents of the Journal of the Dalton Genealogical Society commencing with Volume 1 published back in 1970 through to Volume 41 published in December 2004. Lists of contents are given for Volumes 42 to 56 and the full synopses will be uploaded in due course. Copies of all back numbers are available for purchase and these can be obtained through your local secretary using the order form that you will find on the link above. Details of prices, including postage and packing, will be found there as well.\n\nWe are most grateful to DGS member Mrs Pat Robinson, who holds stocks of back numbers for the Society and arranges for their distribution in response to requests from the local secretaries (address: Mallards, 3 High Street, The Green, Barrington, Cambridge CB2 5QX, UK email: gandprobinson@waitrose.com.)\n\nConclusion\n\nEnjoy this month’s issue of \"Daltons in History\", your regular monthly update on everything that is happening in the world of Dalton family history. We will be back again in August 2012 with a full report on the Yorkshire Gathering.\n\nThank you for your attention\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nMichael Neale Dalton\n\nChairman and Honorary Life President of the Dalton Genealogical Society\n\nFrom Maureen Collins our Australian and New Zealand Secretary\n\nThe Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies\n\nThe School of Family History\n\nwww.ihgs.ac.uk\n\nNewsletter No. 131– July 2012\n\nWelcome to our latest Newsletter!\n\nNext Open Courses:\n\nGrow Your Family Tree\n\n6th August 2012 - Residential Course\n\nThis residential course welcomes beginners to the subject of family history but even the experienced will benefit.

Summer is a great time to work on genealogy research. Here are some ideas for seminars and web sites that may help.\n\nMember Cathy Negrycz in Florida has forwarded an announcement for a seminar that will be held in August at the Allen County Public Library in Indiana.\n\nReaders of \"Daltons in History\" may recall that Cathy submitted an article on the Melungeons in the March 2012 issue.\n\nYou can go to the \"Daltons in History\" archive to reread the article. This seminar may be of interest to those with Dalton roots in the Appalachian Mountain area. Here is a link to the article http://www.daltongensoc.com/diharchive/15_3_March_2012/text.html#4 And, here's the announcement:\n\n\"Saturday, 4th August, 2012, Roberta Estes is returning to the Allen County Public Library with a number of her colleagues for a day-long seminar on DNA and Melungeons. The DNA work that has been done with Melungeon populations is truly remarkable, and answers age-old questions about their origins. Now, before you say that you don’t have any Melungeon ancestors, let me hasten to tell you a bit more about the day. The seminar will begin with a general introduction to DNA and genealogy. Ms. Estes does an excellent job with this presentation. So, if you have been wondering about how DNA findings work with genealogical research, this is a must-attend session, Melungeon or not. In addition, the question and answer period at the end of the day will likely cover DNA findings as they relate to African Americans and Native Americans. Even more good news is that the seminar is free. Attend the whole day or just sessions of particular interest - it's totally up to you\".\n\nDavid has been following several genealogy groups on Facebook, and has offered a host of genealogy web sites that you may not be familiar with. Here is his list:\n\nAs a result of doing some social media (Facebook Groups) research, here are a few interesting generic (non Dalton-specific) genealogy research sites:\n\nhttp://freeirishgenebooks.blogspot.co.uk - The availability of FREE eBooks and eJournals on the internet seems to be growing by the day. This site lists (with links to open the books) over 4,000 free Books and Journals on the topic of Irish, Irish-American, Irish-Australian and Irish-Canadian Genealogy which can all be read online - most of them can also be downloaded to a reading device such as Kindle, iPad, Tablet, etc. (check the host site for available formats). Many of these books are 'out of print', rare or otherwise unavailable in paper format. Some of the family histories were printed for 'Private Circulation' in fewer than 100 - 200 copies but are now available to anyone online.\n\nhttp://www.digitalnz.org/ - Digital New Zealand - A collection of text, images, audio and video relating to New Zealand genealogy.
