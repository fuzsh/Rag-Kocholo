There was also an individual, James W. Donahue, who had once lived in Pe Ell, patented different logging hand tools in c.1913, and is buried in the St. Joseph Catholic Cemetery, of Forest Lawn, Pe Ell Cemetery. I have heard the building that once housed the Champion company was torn down in the last 10-20 years? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nDenise Stocking 20 Nov 2010\n\nNeed your help in finding information on my uncle's biological family. His name is IRVIN WENDELL HURLBURT, he is 87 yrs. old and WANTS to find his family roots!. He was born May 23, 1923 at the MINNIE IPE Maternity Home in Centralia. What he was told by his adopted mother, was that \"he came from a good home\" and that his bio mother was about 16 yrs. old and from Pe Ell. We are uncertain if these are facts or comments made up. His adopted family is the HURLBURT/BRANT family. We feel that there could be a birth connection somehow with the IPE/MASON family. Please if you have any information please contact me, as my uncle is looking for any information that might bring some closure to this mystery. Thank you in advance.\n\nJohn Ashworth 14 Nov 2010\n\nJulius Plett, age 42, was killed in an industrial accident at the Union Mills Camp, Hannaford Valley, Lewis County, Washington, on 10th November 1920.

On the reverse is inscribed Compliments of Centralia. Wash. June 22-25, 1915. What was this medallion for?What was the event which caused it to be made? Just for the heck of it, does it have any value?\n\nWilliam G.

I graduated from Vader Grade School as did my two older brothers. My father Arlyn K. Cullom (known by everyone as PEE WEE) lived with my mother, Lorene for 55 years by the school and owned the gas station, a saw mill. My grandfather had a machine shop that my father took over and ran in town. He was good friends with all the Finns, on Finn Hill and used to drag a big sleigh behind his truck, with flares and bales of hay to sit on and all the kids in town would go sleighing and singing carols when it snowed enough to get out the sled. This was when the HWY would be closed and we kids would get hot chocolate at the barber shop, bon fires lit the route and the whole town would come out and sled down the hill from the top of the hill at Red Hollingers place down to the old bank bld. opposite my Dad's 2 business on opposite corners across from the post office. I hate to lose all this old Vader history, even the photos of KKK marching in our May Day Parade. Yep! My father was the justice of the peace and volunteer fireman, an active Mason and a good , well liked man. A town senior, one might say. He logged and fished to support our family until beginning work in Longview in his later years. for most of the 55 years in town. He and his father owned a lumber yard where the \"the Litttle Crane Cafe\" stood when I was a child there.Long story short... I have old photos, artifacts, etc. that may be of interest. My grandfather, Otto J. Cullom and his wife Mae were pioneers there. My father owned several businesses and employed many folks there. I moved to Vader ( was born there) in 1954. My Grandparents and parents were considered \"old timers\" back then...I am dying and in the process of moving to CA. in the next few weeks. If there is a historical society with items on display I would like to donate many years of photos of Vader, boy scouts, Maypole dances on disc, my mother recorded 55 years of Vader history and my Grandmother longer than that. If there is a way to honor them by donating some wonderful old photos, films and whatever as we keep unpacking, I would love hearing from someone there.Thanks you.\n\nKirk Lutz 23 Jul 2010\n\nI am researching my mother's family the Grandos.

I have never seen a picture of Morgan. Does anyone have one? Please. Thank you so much for your time.\n\nRebecca McCartney 17 Apr 2010\n\nIn 1920 Census I located Joe W. Pine living in Morton and working as a physician in general practice. He is part of a family tree my mother's cousin and I are working on. In the 1920 census Joe is still listed as single. The only other information I can locate is that in 1930 he was an \"inmate\" at Camp Fremont, US Public Health Service Hospital #24, San Mateo, California. I don't know what happened to place him there. The 1930 census indicates he is married but his age at first marriage is marked \"unknown.\"I realize that could be a mistake; I looked through the marriage records linked to on your site and did not find any record.I wonder if there is any other mention of Joe that you might have access to. Might the arrival of a new doctor in Morton have merited mention in a newspaper of the time?Joe's background was not in Washington. He was born in January, 1890, in Eureka, Humboldt County, CA to Norton H. Pine and Jennie L. Pine. His only sibling was Ruby Pine, born about 1898, his adopted sister (1900 census). By 1910 Joe's father had passed away and he was working as an \"undertaker,\" probably in the Sanders Funeral Home in Eureka owned by his Uncle, Robert J. Sanders. We have a picture of Joe in uniform which is labeled, \"Joe Pine in France, 1916.\" Since the US had not officially entered WWI at that time he may have been a volunteer; there were a number of volunteer ambulance drivers in France, then, though many of them hailed from Harvard and I don't know how a humble mortician from Eureka might have become an ambulance driver in France. Joe's 1917-1918 WWI draft registration lists him as a medical student at the osteopathic college in Los Angeles, CA with a financially dependent mother and no previous military experience (though volunteer service might not have counted). After the 1930 census I can find no record of Joe at all. I did not check cemeteries in your area because his family was all in Humboldt and Sonoma Counties in California.Thank-you for your consideration and input.\n\nEvedene Bennett 10 Apr 2010\n\nLARSEN cousins are coming from Denmark in Aug/Sept & hope to recontact Larsen descendants of brothers Ole Christian (Charlie) who settled 1888-90 in the Harmony area & Lars (Louis) settled in Chehalis. I am from the Louis line, & met these kinfolk in Denmark in 1983, but I have lost contact with the Charlie descendants who these Danes hope to meet as they met Alma Mullens when she took Charley back to Denmark before he died. The brothers married Core sisters & so Cores there would probably know of them. Alma Larsen MULLENS' 2 children are James; & Elizabeth who md John BRENNON & had Alfred Michael & Nelda Sharlee Brendon.Charley & Lizzie's other ch.b 1900-1914 who had children @1930s-1950s were:Alvin Carl md a Pearl & had 1-Lloyd had several ch in Prineville OR, 2-Donald Hamilton had Rob, Cathy, Doug, Debra & Greg; 3-Bonnie md a CULLEN & had Connie, Candie, Kevin, Charles & Shane Cullen, 4-Jack had Lee & Todd, & 5-Joe had Jill & Roy LARSEN.(These later generations b 1950s-70s.Laura Leona md Charles E.

Albert is brother to Theodore W Harms. Searching for more information on Henry August Harms and wife Louis Godheart and their other children.\n\nRobert F. Phillips 2 Apr 2010\n\nMy great grandfather, John W. Phillips was originally buried in Riffe Cemetery. The records indicate that when Riffe was flooded, he, and, I believe his daughter A.M. Phillips were both moved to Doss Cemetery in Mossyrock. A.M. Phillips is listed as buried there, but J.W. Phillips isn't listed. I do not live close enough to research this, but would like to know if he is buried at Doss Cemetery. Thanks.\n\nDonald W. LeBaron 2 Apr 2010\n\nMy research on Clarence and Evangeline (Eva) LeBaron has hit a wall. Census records, (obituaries), and news paper documents reveal that they had 5 children (4 living)in 1900. My grandfather Ivan was born in Centralia in 1901. Eva died on 3/15/43 and Clarence died 7/27/31. The 5th child (not listed in any of the census records) died after only a few days/weeks and is buried at the downtown cemetary (across from Edison elementary school). The marker for this baby is a small slab (6\"x10\") engraved \"BABY\". The records for this cemetary are at Centralia Parks Dept. The information shows 4 plots. Three family members intered there: Clarence/Eva/Baby Eva. It would appear that the baby's name was Eva, but some thought the baby was a boy. My father passed in 1995 and had hoped to place a marker for this baby. Thank-you for your time and consideration.\n\nMel Fuller 25 Mar 2010\n\nI am looking for a contact to see if the Bozarth Family reunion is being held.

He mentioned Maude Swartz--a cousin?Any information will be greatly appreciated. I have grandchildren now and would like to leave as clear a picture of their ancestry. Thank You.\n\nPatience Northern 29 Jan 2010 (updated 20 Feb 2010)\n\nLooking for connections to Durin Davis, Mark Davis and Lanny Davis. Going back to those generations they are connected to my Coomes family as Amanda Davis married James T. Coomes. Particularly interested in information on the Coomes family from Grayson Co., Va.\n\nIn reply to Colette Sexton (Query #443): We are searching for information to verify our connection to Durin Davis of Lewis Co., Washington. Several families of Grayson Co., Va. moved to Grays Harbor, then to Lewis Co., Washington. Our James and Bealy Coomes were 2 heads of families who made the move. Jameses mother was Amanda (Davis) Coomes. We feel that she may be the sister of Durin Davis and that they may be the children of John and Sidney Davis. Also in 1870 James Tucker Coomes and wife Amanda (Davis) Coomes were careing for John Davis. According to the placement in the census they were living in John Davis' home and were listed as head of household instead of John. Sidney Davis was dead. Sidney was not listed so supposed dead. Also living there was an older Lydia Davis. We would like to know who she was and her connection with the family. John and Sidney Davis raised Amanda's first 2 daughters, Elizabeth b 1852 and Edna b 1854. Amanda married James T. Coomes in 1857.Any help to untangle this family will be more than welcome.\n\nTina 20 Feb 2010\n\nI am trying to find information on an ancestor. the name is Pauline (Bieniek) Gronka. she was born in 1857 and died in 1929. her family lived in Lewis County. I am trying to find an Obituary or something with her parents names. I am researching my family history. any information will help. Her husband was Martin Albert Gronka.\n\nJean Morrison 20 Feb 2010\n\nI am searching for someone who descends from the family of Eva Trout Stover who was in the 1930 Lewis Co. census with her 2nd husband Louis Maynard and her children, Fredierick Stover, Raymond R. Stover, Elaine H. Stover, Majorie B. Stover and Eda Stover or for someone who knows more about this family.\n\nKatie Montanez 5 Feb 2010\n\nMy great-aunt, Elizabeth Gilbert Stone Santhuff, came to Adna on Oct. 7, 1911 to run the Plymouth Hotel. She and L.E. Young, a blacksmith in Adna, had been corresponding for a couple of years and he had arranged for her to lease hotel. The next night there was a fire that destroyed the Plymouth Hotel, the Adna Hotel, which was next door; the Field general store, and the homes of Henry Allen, Ed Harris, B.W. Blake, M. Bodine and L.B. or W.H. Smith. She was unable to escape from the burning building and she died. L.E. Young, who also was staying at the hotel, was able to escape. He originally denied that he had been at the hotel that night and to bolster this claim he told people that Elizabeth had left Adna on the evening train to go back to Tukwila. When her body was discovered it was thought she had been murdered and the fire set to destroy the evidence. L.E. Young was arrested and charged with her murder. However, eventually all charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. He said he lied about his whereabouts that night because he wanted to protect his previously good reputation with the people of Adna. So, what I'd like to know is: Does anyone have any photographs of the Plymouth Hotel before the fire or any Adna street scenes circa 1911? Does anyone have any family stories or histories about this fire? I'd love to hear what people might have written or said about this event. Does anyone know anything about L.E. Young? Apparently he'd only been in Adna for about 4 months prior to the fire. I haven't even been able to find out his first name. I've read some newspaper articles in the Centralia Weekly Chronicle and the Chehalis Bee Nugget about this fire plus some legal documents pertaining to the inquest that was held and I think that Elizabeth was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't believe L.E. Young had anything to do with her death, he just made the mistake of not telling the truth to begin with. Any help would be very greatly appreciated and thank you in advance for any information -- big or small! I'd also be glad to help with any postage or copying expenses.\n\nNicki Luth 29 Jan 2010\n\nLooking for living ancestors of Mark Floyd Davis...His great Aunt Amanda Davis is my gggrandmother (I think).

My GGGrandfather, Nicholas Barr, was a brother of Lawrence Barr, who lived in Centralia, 1891 - 1911, conducted a mercantile business, with his son, William Lawrence Barr as partner. Lawrence Barr was also one of the organizers of Farmers & Merchants Bank. In 1909 he wrote a family history, about his family's coming to America from Germany, which has been passed down in my family line, and which I will gladly share. In 1911 he was shot & killed by a bank robber in Centralia. Anyone else researching this family is welcome to contact me.\n\nCarol Stephens 6 Sep 2009\n\nI am doing some research and need a little help.

In 1922, my husband's grandmother, Frances Evelyn Jennings, and grandfather, Orlando Emerson Howell, eloped to Centralia, Washington. They were both from Marysville, Washington.

John was born 1887 in Wisconsin d. 1957 Centralia. He married Florence Ellen Wisner b. 1900 d. 1961 Lewis County, WA. They had 3 children: Eugene, Merwin, and Thelma. His father's name was Henry Williams b. abt 1860? Wisconsin; his mother Margaret Jane Bulloe b. abt 1869 Canada and immigrated to US in 1879. (Margaret remarried George Vernier and Andrew Colleen following the marriage to Henry but I do not have specific dates). I am specifically looking for details on Henry and his ancestry.

Clarence, who died as an infant; John Henry (above); Eva, who married a guy named Lowe and different guy named Peterson (they had only one child which was adopted named Celestine); and Everett who lived in Onalaska (I found him on the 1920 census in Lewis County) and married Myrtle Snyder.

His grandson or great grandson was Ulysses Grant Ford who was my grandmother's father, her name and that of her sisters: Grace Ford, Phyllis Ford and my grandmother Emily Alice Ford. He passed away when my grandmother was one year old in 1905. I have seen his grave and that of a baby boy Joseph Ford, age 7 months who was my grandmother's baby brother who died of ? causes. I would like all the information I can find and am trying to locate as much family as I can. I know that the Waunch family is part of the Ford, perhaps Sidney Jr., or one of the other sons of Sidney Sr. The direct Ford name to me is of course via my grandmother who married Oscar H. Hanby October 10, 1922. They had twin sons, Ray and Roy Hanby, Roy Hanby is my father. In one of the census Sidney is listed, both Sr. and Jr., and for some reason an \"e\" is attached to the end of the Ford name, hence \"Forde.\" I don't know how to correct that, but I can tell by the children's names and the rest that these ARE INDEED MY RELATIVES but the name is incorrect and should be shown as just FORD.\n\nTK 28 Aug 2008\n\nI am looking for any information on Martin Gronka family.

They homesteaded on Jones Road in Winlock, and are the namesake for that road. Gabriel died in November, 1912 (obituary in the Lewis Co. Advocate, Nov. 15, 1912; on file at the Lewis County Museum). A posting in the Chehalis Advocate (Nov. 27, 1924) reported Gabriel Jones receiving a land patent on Feb. 24, 1892 (Book 2, #166) for 73 acres, plus another 160 acres at Lake Creek. At one of the family reunions the owner of the Family Bible handed me a photo copy of the family page, hand written records of the births, weddings and dealths of the imediate family. Children were: Robert, Lottie, Agnes (my great-grandma), William (Bill), Francie, Clara, Clarence. Seven Children born here \"Near Winlock\" which is correct; to this day Jones Road is not inside the city. I also have a copy of the Cramer family bible records. [Editor's note: this Gabriel Jones appears to be unrelated to the Gabriel Jones who emigrated to the Oregon Territory with the Michael T. Simmons party in 1844.]\n\nSandra Wakkuri 26 Mar 2008\n\nIn reply to a listing by Julie Parrish Barth: A World War 1, 1917-1918, registration card for Samuel E.

Edward and Minnie were married about 1886. He was born in Valparaiso, Indiana in October, 1866. She was born in August,1865 in Illinois. Their first child Elsie was born in Illinois, two more boys Elba E. and Q. Lester followed, born in Aberdeen, WA and Otto was born in Aberdeen or Morton. The family farmed in Morton between 1910 and 1920. By 1930, both Elsie (who had married John Jones) and her three children and Elba, his wife and two children were living in Chehalis. There is a death record for a Minnie Chapman in 1944, Pacific County but I don't know if that is the correct person. Charles Edward Chapman moved to BC where he married again and died in 1933. I'd be grateful for any information.\n\nJulie (Parrish) Barth 17 Mar 2008\n\nI have just begun to search for my family. My great-grandfather was named Samuel E. Parrish.

I know that his dad was named James Parrish. James Parrish was born in Ohio. His mother was named Emma Roddis(Maiden) Parrish and she was born in England. They were married in Illinois in 1884. Some time between 1884 and 1891 they moved to your state.\n\nThe Lewis County 1900 census has not been fully entered online. I wonder if it is possible to know if the people I am looking for are on the census. I live in central Illinois, so it isn't possible for me to come there myself.

I have a photo, of their house with the four Pistemaa's on their porch. I also have other photos that were taken in the Veness/Winlock area.

Sexton 5 Mar 2007 (Updated 24 Mar 2007)\n\nWe are looking for information on my husband Richard Allen Sexton's great-grandfather, Frank Doty Sexton aka F.D. Sexton. Our cousin received today F.D. Sexton's death certificate and from it his date of birth 5 September 1850. He died in Chehalis 7 March 1938 at age 87 years 7 months and 2 days. He is buried at Fern Hill. Per certificate name of father still Unknown and per informant name of mother unknown. He was born in PA or Kentucky, as some census state Pennsylvania other Kentucky. His mother was Betsy J. Wiley and step-father James L. Wiley this information from the Lewis county 1880 census. He was married to Lena Farr born in Canada. F.D. & Lena had 3 children; Frank E. (my husband's grandfather) Born in Lewis county 15 June 1882 (per his Teamster Registration Card), Grace L. Born in Lewis county 20 July 1884 died 20 Aug 1892 and Edna Violet born in Lewis county 1887 and we believe she married Golden Temple. Lena died in Lewis county 2 Mar 1888 at age 27.

Katie b 1870 & died at age 40 16 Mar 1910. We do not know where Katie is buried. Sometime after Katie's death F.D. remarried a lady named Minerva and moved to San Juan County @ Friday Harbor WA, where he was the Town Marshall and street commissioner. We went to Fern Hill in 2004 and there was a headstone F.D.Sexton with no dates, so we do not know if he is buried there or not. His mother, step-father, and half-sister Mary Katherine \"Wiley\" Dean are buried there as well as his son Frank E. and daughter in-law Effie \"Fiscus\" Sexton. The Stockand's were half-brother to Lena \"Farr\" Sexton.\n\nWe would really like information other than census on F.D. and his children, also his date of birth and death. His father's name and place of birth would be very helpful.\n\nMy husband's other grandfather George K. Miller was married to Laura Elizabeth Davis of the Mark Floyd Davis family and I know that there is a lot of information already available for them.

As a preschooler Evelyn Townsand (Mrs. Orval Lee Black) was our housekeeper for a short time after the death of my father in 1929. After her marriage to Orval, they moved to Ryderwood. My brother and I spent a few weeks one summer with them (they lived in a 'skid shack'. In 1940 we visited for the summer and remained for that school year. A repeat stay occured in 1942-43. I recall a visit to Orval's dads farm for harvesting hay. Great corn on the cob. His dad seemed like a nice older man. In '42 a coouple of friends & I went to that farm area by the bridge over the Chehalis river to see if we could get some work for a little spending money. A nearby farmer offered us a job helping bring in the hay. We slept in the field with the admonision not to smoke. Breakfast was huge! We finished the work in one day and were paid and unemployed. Hitchiked to Chehalis, a movie and back to the farm area ending up asking Orval's dad if we could sleep at his place. He let us sleep in the hayloft (no smoking!). Sleeping was ruined by a hayfight, we retired to the barnyard and slept on the ground. Orvals dad looked out the window in the morning and was stuned to see us sleeping on the ground with the cows walking all about us. How we missed steping in the cow pies is a mystery. Orval and Evelyn came to Mt. View after Ryderwood closed and became a school custodian my brother got him the job). I visited Evelyn in the Morton Nursing Home twice, once taking her on a ride to revisit Ryderwood, then to the old farm area, Centralia and back to Morton. Orval told me he left school in the 3rd grade after throwing an ink bottle at the teacher (it missed) He went home to his grandfather's and said he wasn't going back. Orval had a stammering problem but got it under control as he grew older. We called him Uncle Orval and he was a great fellow with a swell voice for 'My Wild Irish Rose'. Perhaps someone in the family tree will find this information interesting. I certainly appreciated the Black influence in my life.\n\nTina 5 Oct 2006\n\nI recieved a letter over 30 years ago from my great grandmother (she's still alive)...while doing a school project..with all my family history in it from that side of my family. It was put away and recently I came upon that letter. I'm now doing searches via internet on my family history comparing with this letter and have found that the Bassetts (James, Catherine, Temple, James, Stewart, Esther and Homer) and the Alexanders (Margaret and Robert) as in my letter are listed in the 1910 Lewis Co. Census. I'm very interested in finding out more information and have also found both of my great great grandparents (James and Catherine Bassett and Margaret and Robert Alexanders) are buried at Fern Hill Cemetery.\n\nRita Parker 1 Oct 2006\n\nAm looking for any information on the Rhodes family: George, Wiley and Melvina who immigrated to Lewis County around 1912 from Pike County, Kentucky.
