        "meta_description": "Frederick II of Brandenburg-Prussia (1712-1786), also named &lsquo;the philosopher king&rsquo;, played a crucial role in the development of German Enlightenment thought. Recent research, both from a philosophical (Lifschitz) and a biographical (Blanning) point of view, has highlighted Frederick&rsquo;s contribution to the Enlightenment, as well as his interactions with the great figures of eighteenth-century European philosophy (such as Wolff and his school, D&rsquo;Alembert, Maupertuis, Voltaire, Du Ch&acirc;telet). To be sure, his reforming approach decisively influenced the cultural politics and intellectual life of his time, as evidenced by his role in the reorganisation of the Berlin Academy and in the development of the reflection on the freedom of thinking within the framework of enlightened despotism, to name but two points. A fascinating if sometimes controversial figure, both a significant scholar and a central political actor, Frederick played an undeniable role in the elaboration and actualisation of the enlightened ideas of his time. He contributed through essays, discourses, epistolary and literary texts to the Prussian and European philosophical debates. His early admiration for Wolff&rsquo;s thought was outshined by a predilection for French and British enlightened ideas and a long-lasting interest in Marcus Aurelius and ancient philosophy more generally. Frederick&rsquo;s philosophical preferences as well as his idiosyncrasies had a compelling impact on the development of Enlightenment thought during his reign, not only owing to the speculative philosophy class of the Berlin Academy he created, but also thanks to the translations and European movements and views he encouraged. His accomplishments as a king did sometimes contradict or threaten to undermine his intentions and ambitions as a prince, and outstanding successes were undoubtedly interwoven with more controversial or conflicting statements and actions &ndash; all of which deserve a novel consideration nowadays.\r\nOur conference aims to scrutinize Frederick the Great&rsquo;s role and influential contribution to the philosophy of the Enlightenment in the light of recent research on his writings (see the English edition of his philosophical writings by A. Lifschitz 2020), on the philosophical endeavour of the Berlin Academy, and, more generally, on the German Enlightenment.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgramme\r\nAll times are Bucharest times (UTC/GMT +2 hours)\r\n&nbsp;\r\nFriday, November 3rd\r\n09:45 &ndash; Coffee and Opening\r\nChair: Tinca Prunea-Bretonnet\r\n10:00-11:00 &ndash; Avi Lifschitz (University of Oxford), Frederick the Great at the limits of Enlightenment\r\n11:00-11:15 &ndash; Coffee break\r\n11:15-12:15 &ndash; Sorana Corneanu (University of Bucharest), &ldquo;To be in error is our lot in life&rdquo;: Frederick and the controversy over prejudices \r\n12:15-14:15 &ndash; Lunch break\r\nChair: Sorana Corneanu\r\n14:15-15:15 &ndash; Henny Blomme (University of Brussels), Frederick on the innocence of errors of the mind\r\n15:15-15:30 &ndash; Coffee break\r\n15:30-16:30 &ndash; Tinca Prunea-Bretonnet (University of Bucharest/Romanian Academy), &ldquo;En le faisant raisonner lui-m&ecirc;me&rdquo;: Frederick on the autonomy of reason and the philosophical spirit\r\n16:30-16:50 &ndash; Coffee break\r\n16:50-17:50 &ndash; Stephen Howard (University of Leuven), Frederick, Kant, deception, and Enlightenment \r\n19:00 Conference dinner\r\nSaturday, November 4th\r\nChair: Alexandra Bacalu\r\n09:30-10:30 &ndash; Fran&ccedil;ois Duchesneau (University of Montreal), Maupertuis&rsquo;s last memoir to the Berlin Academy: epilogue to a scientific controversy \r\n10:30-10:45 &ndash; Coffee break\r\n10:45-11:45 &ndash; Fritz Nagel (University of Basel), Frederick the Great, the Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler.
