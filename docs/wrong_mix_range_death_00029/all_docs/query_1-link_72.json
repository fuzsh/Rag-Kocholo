        "text": "Day 1: Arrival.\n\nFly London to Berlin and drive to Osterfeld where we check-in to our hotel for 2 nights. Introductory talk before dinner. (D)\n\nDay 2: Rossbach.\n\nDespite being outnumbered nearly 2:1, in November 1757 Frederick won one of his greatest victories at Rossbach. We will see the ground used to hide his flanking manoeuvre and over which he rapidly moved in oblique order to achieve complete surprise. In the nearby village of Reichardtswerben there is a wonderful diorama of the battle itself. (B,D)\n\nDay 3: Kesselsdorf.\n\nAt Kesselsdorf (December 1745), a victory at which Frederick was not present, we examine the weak position outside the town where the outnumbered Prussians were initially repulsed and we see where they finally triumphed over an impetuous Austrian counter-attack to capture this important town. This afternoon we visit to the Bundeswehr Military Museum, one of the finest in Europe and which showcases the evolution of German military technology. Check-in to our Dresden hotel for 4 nights. (B,D)\n\nDay 4: Hochkirch.\n\nTo the east of Dresden just outside of the historic city of Bautzen we find the battlefield of Hochkirch (14 October 1758), considered one of Frederick’s greatest blunders. We explore the open fields, visit the distinctive church with extant cannonballs embedded into its walls and walk down the ‘Blutgasse’, the scene of bitter close quarter combat. (B,D)\n\nDay 5: Maxen.\n\nAt Maxen (November 1759),where once again Frederick was not present, we see where an entire Prussian corps became isolated and forced into humiliating surrender. This afternoon you are free to explore Dresden and dine at your own expense. (B)\n\nDay 6: The invasion of Saxony.\n\nDrive out to Lobositz (1 October 1756), the opening battle of the Seven Years War, a narrow victory for Frederick force dubiously declared as a victory. Thence to the fortress of Pirna, successfully besieged by Frederick in 1756, resulting in the surrender of the Saxon army within a month. At the majestic and towering Saxon fortress at Konigstein, we take the lift to the inside of its walls where we find a wonderful museum with a fine display of military hardware, explore its many period buildings and gain magnificent views over the Elbe valley. We finish the day at the Lilienstein to discuss the Saxon surrender and enjoy stunning views of the Koenigstein fortress. (B,D)\n\nDay 7: Torgau.\n\nheck-out of the hotel and drive to the vital River Elbe bastion of Torgau where we explore much of its existing fortifications. Thence to the battlefield which, in November 1760, saw one of the bloodiest battles of the Third Silesian War. We consider Frederick’s turning movements, appreciate how the extant forest served to disorientate the Prussian forces and determine whether indeed Frederick’s plan was simply too ambitious. Check-in to our hotel for 1 night. (B,D)\n\nDay 8: Potsdam and Charlottenburg.\n\nThis morning we visit Sanscouci Palace, home to the Hohenzollerns and favourite of Fredrick, where amidst its grand terraced gardens we find his simple grave to pay our respects. After lunch ist the wonderful Charlottenburg Palace and, in particular, the ‘New Wing’ which houses a permanent exhibition on the great monarch. Early evening we will take a stroll along Frederick’s Unter den Linten and admire his magnificent statue. (B,D)"
