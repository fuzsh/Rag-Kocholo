Lett, a successful general agriculturist of Sodus Township, Berrien County, Mich., has with efficiency discharged the duties of office, and as Deputy Sheriff of the county for two years gained a wide acquaintance and the high respect of all with whom he came in contact. Mr. Lett was born in Muskingum County, Ohio, November 5, 1837. His parents, James and Margaret Lett, were thrifty and industrious people, and trained their family to habits of sturdy self-reliance. Our subject, the eldest child, early began the struggle of life, and enjoyed but little opportunity for regular schooling, his education being gained mostly from the private instruction of his father. Remaining at home until he had attained his majority, George Lett then decided to try the farther West, and journeyed to Michigan, remaining a short time in Berrien County, but soon returning to Ohio, where he then engaged in farming upon his own account. About five years after, he again came to Michigan, and here enlisted in the service of the Government, in 1864 joining Company I, On Hundred and Second Michigan Infantry, under the command of Col. Chipman.\n\nThe regiment went from Detroit to Beaufort, S. C., and from there afterward proceeded to Gray's Island, relieving another regiment placed in charge. At the end of eight months, the One Hundred and Second Michigan Infantry was ordered to march, and made their way to Savannah, Ga., guarding that point until the regiment took part in the Georgetown raid. Their next movement was to Charleston, S. C., then to Orangeburgh, S. C. and from the latter point to Columbia. Finally the regiment went into camp in North Carolina, but was again ordered to Charleston, where the troops disbanded, and the soldiers of each regiment were honorably discharged. Our subject had passed through many perilous scenes without suffering a wound or imprisonment, but on his way to New York encountered an unexpected danger, which, however, terminated without serious disaster to him. Upon the way to New York the vessel became disabled, and the troops were cast adrift in Delaware Bay, but by keeping close to the shore Mr. Lett and a number of others were saved from imminent death.\n\nAs soon as mustered out, our subject returned to Sodus Township and entered upon the land purchased for him by his father when he was twenty-one years old. The acres were all in a wild state, and without loss of time Mr. Lett began clearing and cultivating the fertile soil, which has since yielded so abundantly. Sixty acres, finely improved and containing a comfortable house, barns and other buildings, attest the industry and energy of their owner. In the month of March, 1864, George W. Lett and Miss Diley Ann West, daughter of Henry West, or Kentucky, were untied in marriage. Five children have blessed the union. James W. is at home; Martha Ann married Isaac Reed, and lives in Berrien Centre; Franklin is with his father on the home farm; Cora married Herman Holiday and resides in Sodus Township; and Letha married John Goans and lives on the old homestead. Our subject is a member of the Christian Church, and also holds the official position of Deacon, and has ever been a liberal supporter of the cause of religion and especially interested in the extension and influence of its good work. Politically a Republican, Mr. Lett is well posted on the issues of the day, local and national, and is as loyal and true a citizen as when, so many years ago, he gave himself to the service of his country. He has for many years been a prominent factor in the progressive enterprise of his locality, and is ever ready to do his part in all matters pertaining to the public good.\n\nSpouse: DILSEY ANN WEST\n\nBirth Place: KY\n\nReligion: CHRISTIAN CHURCH\n\nSpouse Father: HENRY WEST\n\nMarriage Date: 12 Apr 1864\n\nMarriage Place: VAN BUREN\n\nChildren: JAMES W.\n\nMARTHA ANN-MI\n\nFRANKLIN\n\nCORA-MI\n\nLETHA-MI\n\n1.3.2.1.1 JAMES W.
