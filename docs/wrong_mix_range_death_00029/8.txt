“The finest day of life is that on which one quits it. The mountain is passed; we shall be better now”

King Friedrich II – or Frederick the Great, as he was better known as – reigned over Prussia for 46 years between 1740 and his death on 17 August 1786. Frederick united the disconnected lands under the rule of of Prussia, first by invading Silesia and later Poland. He transformed Prussia from a backward state into a major power as well as being interested in music and philosophy.

Rather than speaking on his deathbed, Frederick died in an armchair in his study at the Palace of Sansscouci.
