        "text": "ðŸ’¥ ðŸ“£ Calling current University Staff! TPXimpact | B Corpâ„¢ and Blue Marble on behalf of the Department for Education are conducting research to understand how a Digital Support Hub could best support education settings in England to progress with sustainability. We want to make sure that the opinions of people who work in progressing sustainability in Higher Education play a part in the design. To help us do this, we would like to invite you to take part in a 30 minute Google Meet call with us to: ðŸ’¡ Understand where your organisation is currently at with progressing sustainability initiatives (it doesn't matter if you haven't started) along with exploring the challenges and opportunities. ðŸ’¡ Get your thoughts on how the Digital Support Hub could work best for you. If you would like to get involved use this link to book a time slot: https://lnkd.in/gq49Gk9e Alternatively if the dates or times don't work for you, you can sign up to get involved in this research project in the future: https://lnkd.in/geWmaXGC\n\nInclusive living, agile ageing, technology, and meaningful activity are vital components of a society that values the well-being and fulfillment of all its members. Inclusive living fosters environments where individuals of diverse backgrounds, abilities, and ages can thrive together, promoting social cohesion and reducing disparities. Agile ageing emphasizes the importance of adapting to the evolving needs and capacities of older adults, enabling them to maintain independence, autonomy, and quality of life as they age. Technology plays a transformative role by providing tools and solutions that enhance accessibility, communication, and health management, empowering individuals to lead more fulfilling and connected lives regardless of age or ability. Meaningful activity, whether it's through work, volunteering, or creative pursuits, enriches lives by fostering a sense of purpose, accomplishment, and community engagement. Together, these elements contribute to a society that values inclusivity, embraces diversity, and supports the well-being of all its members across the lifespan.

Here's a glimpse of what we've achieved: ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF SOCIAL INNOVATION ACTORS IN INNOVATION ECOSYSTEMS: Intense intersectoral and interdisciplinary co-creation: - 8 in present events (KoM, regional study visits, ColÂ·laborathons, OLLDays) - online on the INTEGER platform (https://lnkd.in/dJJgwZgp): 138 users (120 validated) +60 institutions 5 working channels 11 digital co-creation spaces (e.g. ColÂ·laberâ€™s corner, INTEGER Model Core group, Letâ€™s Hack Together Model Event) 18 projects +80 contents WIDER ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF FINANCING SOCIAL INNOVATIONS: - 100+ partners (e.g. #Phillips, #Kuideo, Ship2B Foundation, #ClusterAMBIT, etc.) - Participation of social innovators and business innovators in real co-creation spaces: 11 virtual, several in presence at each of the regions (3 Collaborathons using mixed criteria social: 150+ partners from Hamburg, Krakow Catalonia - 1 INTEGER ColÂ·laborathon with the 3 finalists, Awarded with recognition of winner and finalists TESTED INNOVATION MODELS WITH POTENTIAL OF SCALING UP AND REPLICABILITY AVAILABLE FOR WIDESPREAD USE - Co-creation of the 1st draft of the INTEGER 4H Comprehensive Model - Presentation and contrast of model with international peers at several EU and international events: (NET4Age-Friendly, ISIRC 2023 in GuimarÃ£es / ENoLL (European Network of Living Labs) Open Living Lab Days in Barcelona) - Constitution of the EU INTEGER ColÂ·laboratory on Health and Wellbeing, Public signature of the Terms of Reference for establishing the EU INTEGER ColÂ·laboratory on Health and Wellbeing https://lnkd.in/dPYn_PWa #INTEGERProject #Innovation #Collaboration #JagiellonianUniversity #SocialInnovation #DigitalEntrepreneurship #ResearchExcellence European Commission, European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA), #HorizonEurope ðŸš€\n\nSensing in those darkest moments there may still be rays of light, or feeling those faintest hints of possibility, of the more beautiful regenerative world? Maybe you wish to evolve your participative capabilities to care for, share and grow those slivers of possibility? Then you might wish to consider my latest course Co-Creating Regenerative Cultures. This short video offers an overview of my core design intentions for the course. Plus I also explain a little about the multi-sectoral learning cohort that is already forming. Some of the learning design elements that I have crafted for the course include: - Coherent integrated design balanced between intellect heart and soul - Carefully curated match between topics presenters and explored themes - Cumulative learning trajectory each session seamlessly unfolds into the next - Accessible practical action oriented materials applicable right now in each participants daily life Early bird ENDS midnight Friday 29/03/2024 https://lnkd.in/dfRsX3VX Free preview session April 3rd 2024 18.30-19.30 CET online* * EU/GMT springs forward and hour the previous weekend PLACES are FILLING up as course numbers of attendees will be strictly limited to 20 people so it will be important to reserve your place quickly! So BOOK your early bird place now, before the end 29/03/2024 https://lnkd.in/dfRsX3VX Co-presenters included Curtis Ogden, Sophie Wisbrun-Overakker, Michelle Holliday, Lorenz Sell and Graham Boyd #regenerative #culture #learning #participative #cocreation\n\nI participated in a two-day Masterclass on Inner Developmental Goals (IDGs) with Renee Lertzman, PhD. This class resonated with me particularly because in my work with youth on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), I pay attention to creating spaces to reflect on the question: Who am I becoming by doing what I'm doing? Is this being aligned with the world I would like to co-create? Because of the fast pace of academic/life calendars and operating in product-oriented cultures, it is easy to fall into the trap of focusing on getting the results we want on SDG (youth) projects. While these results do matter, our most significant impact on the world is the beings we become. We will take that footprint wherever we go, whoever we interact with, and whatever project we work on. A project might fail or achieve (un)intended results, but we might miss the point if we do not see it as a tool to evolve into higher versions of ourselves to serve ourselves, each other, and nature. The potential I see with Inner Development Goals is that it might give a common language to unpack what we mean by 'higher versions' of ourselves. This requires deep inner exploration. In this masterclass, I had the opportunity to practice that by reflecting on the questions: 1. What kind of a change maker am I? 2. What is my theory of change? 3. How do I relate to the beings I co-create with? 3. How can I become a guide for sustainability/regeneration? constantly inviting myself to observe how I am showing up. Learning with creatives from different sectors and cultures also allowed me to notice and unpack my blindspots in my understanding of the nature of change. I'm leaving two resources and information on the next IDG Summit here that you might find interesting to explore. I'll be participating in the summit online. Hope to connect there. https://lnkd.in/duaXaPS3 and https://lnkd.in/d49AjNjG"
