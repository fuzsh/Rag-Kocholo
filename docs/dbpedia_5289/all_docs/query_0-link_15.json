It shows the family before they migrated, living at Thriplow, Royston, which has shifted between Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, right on the borders with Essex. It seems that Buttons moved in this area because the same landowners held manors or estates in that corner of all three counties, and offered single men and women work on their other properties when they were old enough to leave home. With a bit more research we would probably find that Rebecca's parents asked their master to find a job for Rebecca, and they sent her to a property in Thriplow where she met Thomas. Also, note that the census labels Thomas as an agricultural labourer when he was, in fact, a shepherd, as were his sons. Probably many of the Button men who are described as \"ag lab\" in these later census records were also shepherds, given the long tradition in Button/Burton families.\n\nThomas was a shepherd, as were many if not most of the Button/Burton men and boys. The following is about conditions in Cambridgeshire for farm workers and agricultural labourers. No wonder they emigrated, and found better lives in Australia. For many it was the first time they ate meat.\n\nAfter that is an article about the role of shepherds in Australia. Thomas and his sons would have done this sort of work on Victorian sheep stations. See below.\n\nAGRICULTURAL LABOURERS Researched by: Chris Champion Last Update: 4 February 2004 For most farm worker households in England it was necessary for the whole family to work to provide an adequate subsistence to live on, rather than simply rely on the efforts of a single breadwinner. The labourer's wife was usually a working woman and children also were put to work at an early age. Wives would help on the farm, often up a couple of hours before their husbands, milking cows and then coming home to prepare breakfast. They would also leave work a couple hours before their husbands came home, to prepare the evening meal. Children would start working about 7:00am plaiting straw for several hours in the early morning, scaring crows, or weeding and picking stones from the fields. The girls were expected to work alongside their mother in a variety of handicrafts and household chores, including lacemaking, sewing, weaving and feeding hens. The boys, from about the age of seven, as they became stronger, would be working beside their father 10 or 12 hours a day, doing a full day's hard work contributing to the family budget. Throughout the 18th Century, through to the mid 19th Century, Agricultural Labourers would be seen wearing smocks, which had elaborate embroidered patterns to denote locally their occupation, and quite often they wore hats which had an emblem (e.g. a simple feather), which also helped to identify their occupation. It was also quite common to see Ag. Labs wearing Top Hats (‘Billy Cocks’), which were extended in height the longer they were in service. However by the 1860s, smocks became impractical for identification of an individuals skills. Dress code changed, waistcoats, shirts and trousers replaced smocks, although hats still formed part of their dress code to identify individuals skills. There were three types of employment; Ag Labs employed on an annual basis because they often moved around; General Labourers who were married and either lived in tied cottages on the farm because they were born or brought up on the farm and continued living there, or lodgings in a nearby village; and Farm Servants usually unmarried and under the age of 25, who worked on the farm and often employed for a year at a Mop Fair or hiring fair. Labourers were either employed on a regular basis for a weekly wage or hired on a day to day basis as ‘casual wage labourers’. The average weekly wage in the 1860s was 8s 6d, if they did not work then they did not get paid. Servants were hired by the year for board, lodging and wages that were given to them at the end of the year. Most Ag Labs couldn’t afford boots (avg weight 7lb), or couldn’t afford to pay a shoe repairer to repair them, so they saved old pieces of leather to carry out their own repairs on their shoes. Foot odour was a problem then and to combat this at the end of a long working day they would use dry grass to absorb the odour. Document: Agricultural Labourers Page 1 of 1 Author: Chris Champion At harvest time work was plentiful, but their working days were long, between 12 to 15 hours of hard physical work. A farm worker had, for the most part, to rely on the strength of his body and perhaps a horse if he was fortunate enough to have access to one. Ploughing, sowing, weeding or harvesting, or tending to sheep, cattle or other livestock were all labour intensive. Most families lived in small villages or hamlets, and they depended on the land to support them. Their dependence was mainly due to their rights of access to common land where they could raise a cow or two, or some pigs or sheep at no cost at all. They also enjoyed the privilege of gathering fuel, by cutting bracken, turf, peat or brushwood. The hedgerows provided berries that could be eaten or turned into wine or pies, and nuts that could be gathered and stored. Rabbits, fish and birds could be taken, sometimes by poaching, all of which added to the limited resources of the agricultural labourer. Even where common land rights did not exist, most people had a small garden where they could grow potatoes, beans and cabbages, or keep a pig, or a few chickens or geese which could be fed on almost anything. Before machinery was introduced women and children would collect loose grain left in the fields after the harvest was gathered in (known as ‘Gleaning’ dating back to Biblical times). The grain gathered provided enough for a few loaves of home-made bread and some straw for bedding. Farmers didn’t have a clue how much was going to waste, and this was a kind of perk for labourers, but this eventually stopped as mechanism became more dominant and eventually Ag Labs reduced and moved onto new jobs and learnt new skills. Self sufficiency was the order of the day. Nothing was wasted. Old pieces of leather were saved to repair harnesses, shoes etc. Old nails were put to one side and straightened to be used a second or third time. Rugs were made from old pieces of clothing (preferably from wool, which was more hard-wearing than cotton) which were cut into strips and hooked into pieces of sacking. Anything that could perhaps find a use in the future was put to one side and saved. It was a hard existence, the family home would probably be a small rented cottage, with no water supply at all, other than a single pump situated on the farm or in the nearby village, serving the whole community. Cottages were often old, dilapidated and damp because they were built below ground level. Dwellings had out side privy’s comprising a wooden box with a hole cut out on top, placed over a cesspit, which had to be mucked out frequently by the occupiers. If the cottage was rented on a farm then more often than not you would find a pig sty at the rear. A typical cottage layout was very basic, downstairs would be the main living room where everyone would wash, where meals were served, and where a variety of household chores were carried out. Some cottages also had a small room to the rear where they would store food, wood for fires, hang clothes to dry and place their boots etc. Upstairs you would find two rooms, one small size room, which tended to be for the parents, and a larger room for the children often sub divided by curtains or blankets. Rooms generally were damp, the only form of heating came from the fireplace in the main living room on the ground floor.\n\nThe average size family was 10, infants would sleep with parents, and younger children would be segregated according to sex. Older children would often be sent to live with extended families in the immediate area or found boarding accommodation with friends or fellow worker families on the farm where their parents were employed. Schooling was almost unheard of for the labouring classes, and the few who were fortunate enough to receive any education, would at most only get three or four years education in elementary reading. It was not until 1870 that compulsory education for five to 13 year-olds became law in England. However, as the children worked beside their parents, they would learn about the weather, the seasons, the names of the animals and birds, and they could recognise the varieties of hedgerow berries and which were good food and which were poisonous. They also learned how to tend and take care of the farm animals and the land. Washing clothes was a communal activity for wives and daughters in a village, but it was also common for this activity to take place in the main living room area of their cottage. Hygiene and cleanliness were little understood, so illness and injury took their toll. Many children died before they reached the age of five. Slight injuries became infected and often crippling, simply because medicine and cures were, largely, unknown. Disease spread rapidly often devastating whole communities. In the 18th century, and to the early part of the 19th century, travel was usually neither desired nor undertaken by the labouring classes, except for an occasional journey of a few miles to a nearby village or market town. Parish records show that many would be born, married and die within the confines of their parish. There was little or no social life, often they were in bed by 8:00pm. If they did go out it was more often or not to a local pub to play cards, dominoes, skittles etc, or to see travelling entertainers. Labourers would have scant knowledge of the events of the time in Britain or the world outside. It might be months or years later that news of events filtered through to them. They often listened to Misssioners or ‘Penny Readers’ who read the latest news and charged 1d for the privilege, because few agricultural Workers could read or write. However, as more and more learnt to read and write so the Penny Readers slowly died out.

He was hired by John Raven near Geelong for 6 months at 40pounds and rations. Thomas had a difficult time. His wife, Rebecca, died at sea of \"consumption\" (tuberculosis) and in childbirth with Sarah or with twins.\n\nHe wrote (1852) in glowing terms to people back in England about the lifestyle and opportunities available to working people in Australia. He wrote this only 3 months after arriving in the colony. Thanks to Brian W for the transcript. See letter in documents Thomas is an example of a family whose migration was partly funded by their neighbours in England, and possibly employers who no longer had work for them. In 1852 he is a shepherd at Mr Raven's out station near Geelong, where Timothy is shepherd to 1559 sheep with a good dog to work them, and Thomas stays home with the young children. Peter goes out with some more sheep for 2/- a day and rations.\n\nFrom descendants \"when he arrived in australia he was Bonded to a Mr John Raven of Geelong where he was to work for a period of six months for 40 pounds.\n\nGeelong Advertiser 5 Nov 1847 EMIGRATION.-By the Oratavea one hundred working men will leave this port: the list of passengers contains the names of one hundred and three. These men, of the active, able bodied\" description, have been engaged by Mr Craulfrd for the Hunter's River Steam Navigation Company. Mr Raven advertises for fifty men for Port Phillip; and the Messrs, Henty for one hundred to proceed to Portland Bay : very probably four times that number may be required. This great demand for labour has arisen in some measure from the circumstance of flockmasters having increased their possessions, owing to the remunerating price of wool, If security of tenure were guaranteed to the squatter, this colony would be drained of its free working population. It must be felt that this emigration is greatly in favour of the home government’s resolution, to convert this into a purely penal colony, for at the present rate it will soon make the agriculturist entirely dependent upon probation labour. -Laundeston Examiner.\n\nJames Raven is ship owner and merchant of Melbourne.\n\n[1847 27 Aug Raven’s shepherd fired for negligence\n\n7 Oct 1846 Samuel Cherry charged by Mr Raven's overseer with absconding after; having secured a pretty stock of clothing in the shape of blue shirts, &o. was sentenced one months' imprisonment; at the end of which time he must be prepared to give some-account of himself, as suspicion has been excited that he is illegally at large]\n\nThomas was a member of the Wesleyan Church.

'\n\nGEELONG ADVERTISER & INTELLIGENCER 13 JAN 1853 BREACH OF SCAB ACT. Mr. Lawrence Trewin, of Waurn Ponds, appeared to answer an information laid against him, for depasturing scabby sheep at Raven's Creek. Thomas Mansfield, shepherd to Mr. Raven, deposed that upon Sunday, the 2d January, he found nine sheep infected with the scab, upon his master's property. His boy Peter drove them down to the home station, and believes he delivered them to Mr. McKenzie. Did not examine the sheep himself, but was informed that they were inspected. Does not know to whom the nine stray sheep belonged. Mr. Kenneth McKenzie being sworn, stated that he was overseer upon Mr. Raven's station, at Raven's Creek. That on Tuesday, the 4th January, he received from Peter Mansfield, son of the last witness, nine scabby sheep. Mr. Trewin came to the home station on the next morning, Wednesday, and witness pointed out and caught one of the nine sheep, and observed to the defendant that it was scabby. The defendant replied, \"that it was in the way of get ting better, and wanted ointment\" Mr.Trewin then drove the nine sheep in question away. Witness has all his life been accustomed to sheep, and has had frequent occasion to give his evidence touching the infection of sheep. By the Bench. - The 9 scabby sheep had intermixed with Mr. Raven's flock, they had to be separated. Knows the diseased sheep to belong to Mr. Trewin, he took the delivery of them, and drove them away. Cross examined by Mr. Harwood. – Knows that they were Mr. Trewin's sheep by their ear mark. Mr. Raven's flock are differently marked, so are the sheep on the intervening run between Trewin's and Raven's. Has been summoned before this Court on account of possessing scabby sheep himself. Has never threatened Mr. Trewin in return. Examined the whole of the nine sheep, cannot say that they were all infected, is sure that one was, which was enough, when the scab is getting loose it is a sign that the sheep are improving, but that they may be capable of causing contagion. Swears that a healthy flock might become infected by allowing the one he pointed out to the defendant to intermix. As soon as the boy drove the flock up, witness separated the diseased ones and kept them in a shed separate from the others. Mr. Raven's sheep have not joined with any infected sheep in the neighbourhood. By Mr. Sandford - It is about 3 years since he was summoned before this Court by defendant. Donald Buchanan, stated that was shepherd to Mr. Hindhough. That one day last week, Mr. Trewin pointed out to him a sheep, which he said Mr. McKenzie called scabby, could not catch this sheep, it was about 5 or 6 yards off when observed by them. Cannot say that the sheep was or was not scabby, it was very white in its wool. Has been shepherding in his own country about 20 years. Cross examined by Mr. Harwood. - This conversation took place upon Mr. Trewin's own run. At the request of defendant, witness endeavoured to catch the sheep and see whether it was or was not scabby, but did not succeed. Mr Harwood contended that there was no evidence whatever to show that the nine sheep in question were the property of the defendant. He also objected to the wording of the information, which set forth that certain sheep were affected by the scab, whereas, at most, only one had been proved to be so affected. The Bench overruled both objections. The defendant called Stephen Young, who deposed that he was a carrier, but had tended sheep for Willis, and also for Dr. Hope, for upwards of seventeen years; considers himself well able to detect the scab in sheep ; was at Mr Trewin's last Friday when a particular sheep was pointed out for him to examine. The Bench objected to receive this as evidence as it was deemed impossible to satisfy the Court that this sheep was the identical one alluded to in the former evidence. A person of the name of Day deposed to having examined, about four or five days ago, the whole of Mr. Trewin's sheep, and after overhauling the flock could not discover scab amongst them. They appeared to have had the scab some time ago, but cannot say that the sheep are properly cured, although they are now all healthy and clean. Another witness deposed to the same effect as the last. Wm. Coulson, shepherd, belonging to the defendant, swore that no appearance of scab had been seen by him in his master's flock during the last two months. John Dempsey stated that he examined the defendant's flock a few days ago, and found it free from scab. Mr Harwood again addressed the Bench for the dismissal of the case and Mr Sandford urged on the prosecution, when Mr Strachan observed that the observation made by Mr Trewin to Mr McKenzie that \" the sheep were getting better,\" convinced him that the case had been fully borne out against the defendant, and fined him in a penalty of 10/-, and the costs of the Court. Mr Strachan also observed to Mr Trewin that if any doubt remained in his mind as to the cleanliness of his flock, he would advise him to be on his guard, as to the new Scab Act, which was much more severe in its operations, would come into force upon the 1st of February next.\n\nIn 1858 Thomas was a shepherd on \"Forest Station\" run by Mr Hindhaugh when his two sons, Timothy Thomas 18 yrs and Samuel John, 10 yrs, died in accidental drowning. See documents\n\n- from Wikipedia Australia\n\nlynmcalpine \"From Cambridgeshire, England - to Geelong, then Cohuna.: Thomas and family departed England from the port of Plymouth in 1852. During the voyage his wife Rebecca died giving birth to their daughter Sarah and the tiny infant died about two days after birth. Thomas, Timothy Thomas, Peter, Mary Anne, Samuel John and William arrived at Point Henry, Geelong, Victoria on the 31st March, 1852. Thomas was employed as a Shepherd at Jan Juc (Geelong). In 1858 John (Samuel John), age 10, was playing around the Merrijig Creek at Jan Juc and either fell into the water or got out of his depth. Eighteen year old Timothy rushed to save his brother but unfortunately he was not a swimmer and both he and John drowned.\n\nSome time after completing his employment as a Shepherd, Thomas went droving cattle. He purchased a property suitable for farming near Horton (Cohuna, Victoria) and lived there until his death in 1886. His place of death is recorded as Box Creek. Life was not all sadness for Thomas. There were many happy times that included the establishment of house and grazing land, family marriages and grandchildren.\"\n\nEuropean exploration led to the spread of sheep around the world, and shepherding became especially important in Australia and New Zealand where there was great pastoral expansion. In Australia squatters spread beyond the Nineteen Counties of New South Wales to elsewhere, taking over vast holdings called properties and now stations. Once driven overland to these properties, sheep were pastured in large unfenced runs. There, they required constant supervision. Shepherds were employed to keep the sheep from straying too far, to keep the mobs as healthy as possible and to prevent attacks from dingoes and wedge-tailed eagles. Lambing time further increased the shepherd's responsibilities. Shepherding was an isolated, lonely job that was firstly given to assigned convict servants. The accommodation was usually poor and the food was lacking in nutrition, leading to dysentery and scurvy. When free labour was more readily available others took up this occupation. Some shepherds were additionally brought to Australia on the ships that carried sheep and were contracted to caring for them on their arrival in the colony. Sheep owners complained about the inefficiency of shepherds and the shepherds' fears of getting lost in the bush. Typically sheep were watched by shepherds during the day, and by a hut-keeper during the night. Shepherds took the sheep out to graze before sunrise and returned them to brush-timber yards at sunset. The hut-keeper usually slept in a movable shepherd's watch box placed near the yard in order to deter attacks on the sheep. Dogs were also often chained close by to warn of any impending danger to the sheep or shepherd by dingoes or natives. In 1839 the usual wage for a shepherd was about AU₤50 per year, plus weekly rations of 12 pounds (5.4 kg) meat, 10 pounds (4.5 kg) flour, 2 pounds (0.91 kg) sugar and 4 ounces (110 g) tea. The wage during the depression of the 1840s dropped to ₤20 a year. During the 1850s many shepherds left to try their luck on the goldfields causing acute labour shortages in the pastoral industry. This labour shortage leads to the widespread practice of fencing properties, which in turn reduced the demand for shepherds. Over 95% of New South Wales sheep were grazing in paddocks by the mid-1880s. An 1890s census of fencing in New South Wales recorded that 2.6 million kilometres of fencing had been erected there with a contemporary cost of A$3 billion. Boundary riders and stockmen replaced shepherds working on foot, who have not been employed in Australia since the start of the 20th century.\n\nDEATH & BURIAL Name: Thos Mansfield Death Registration Year: 1886 Death Registration Place: Victoria, Australia Mother Maiden Name: Burton Spouse: Rebecca Burton Reference Number: 5622 Thomas died at Wee Wee Rup April 1886, and was buried at Pyramid Hill. See documents.\n\nRiverine Herald 30 April 1886 It is with regret I have to mention the death of one of our neighbors, Mr Thomas Mansfield, aged 77 years, through dysentery and senile decay. I understand that his remains are to be conveyed to the Pyramid Hill cemetery, and there intered.\n\nHis son, Peter, was farming in the Wee Wee Rup/Gunbower district at that time so it is likely Thomas spent his last years with Peter and Esther."
