        "text": "Reporting on an inquest can be one of the hardest types of stories a journalist can write.\n\nMore often than not, they are emotionally charged proceedings attended by grief-stricken people who are desperate for answers.\n\nSometimes, inquests can seem quite clinical due to a coroner’s need to remain impartial and level-headed so that they can draw a conclusion from desperately sad events.\n\nAs painful as these proceedings are for those who have lost a loved one, the lessons that can be learned from inquests can go a long way to saving others’ lives.\n\nFamilies are often surprised - and sometimes angry - when they see a reporter in attendance.\n\nUnderstandably they worry the nature of their loved one’s death will be sensationalised and that a news story will forever tarnish their memory.\n\nResponsible and ethically minded journalists will do what they can to report inquests sensitively, while not shying away from the often upsetting facts.\n\nIt is vital that the public don’t forget that inquests are a type of judicial inquiry; they are after all held in a coroner’s court.\n\nThe press has a legal right to attend inquests and has a responsibility to report on them as part of their duty to uphold the principle of ‘open justice’.\n\nBut in doing so journalists must follow the guidance provided by the Independent Press Standards Organisation and set out in Editors’ Code of Conduct.\n\nIt’s a journalist’s duty to make sure the public understands the reasons why someone has died and to make sure their deaths are not kept secret.\n\nAn inquest report can also clear up any rumours or suspicion surrounding a person’s death.\n\nBut most importantly of all, an inquest report can draw attention to circumstances which may stop further deaths from happening.\n\nInquests are not criminal courts - there is no prosecution or defence - they are fact-finding tribunals which seek to answer four key questions:\n\nWho is the person who died?\n\nWhere did they die?\n\nWhen did they die?\n\nHow did they die?\n\nThey do not apportion blame.\n\nOnce these questions are answered a coroner will be able to record a conclusion.\n\nThe wider lessons that can be learned from an inquest can have far-reaching consequences - but if journalists do not attend them how can the public be made aware?\n\nThe harsh reality is they can’t. Coroners often do not publish the results of an inquest.\n\nShould journalists shy away from attending inquests then an entire arm of the judicial system - and numerous others who need to answer vital questions - is not held to account.\n\nInquests can often prompt a wider discussion on serious issues, the most recent of these being mental health and suicide.\n\nEditors actively ask and encourage reporters to speak to the family and friends of a person who is the subject of an inquest.\n\nTheir contributions help us create a clearer picture of the person who died and also provides the opportunity to pay tribute to their loved one.\n\nOften families do not wish to speak to the press and of course that decision has to be respected.\n\nHowever, as has been seen by many brilliant campaigns run by newspapers and websites up and down the country, the input of a person’s family and friends can make all the difference in helping to save others.\n\nWithout the attendance of the press at inquests questions will remain unanswered, debates unargued and lives lost."
