        "text": "I found the company very helpful and…\n\nI found the company very helpful and easy to deal with and have no complaints as to the sound and practical advice offered. I certainly would have scored five stars but for the fact that after our video link consultation, we waited for weeks and heard nothing. When i contacted, i was informed the person dealing with me had left the practice and nobody had picked up on the fact that i was waiting and waiting for something to happen!\n\nDate of experience : August 16, 2022\n\nEmma was amazing!\n\nEmma was very friendly, helpful and very quick to complete the work. She always replied quickly to emails. As first time buyers we used Emma for a declaration of trust and wills. She explained everything clearly in a way we could understand. She would answer any questions we had over confusing legal terms in a simple way. In all honesty we wish we had someone like Emma for the full conveyancing process buying a property. It felt as though she actually really cared about her clients! Something we didnt experience with other solicitors\n\nDate of experience : November 13, 2019\n\nAt a time when I was fraught with worry…\n\nAt a time when I was fraught with worry and questions (and after many frustrating calls to other companies!) Emma Howlett from Thomas Mansfield returned my call and within 30 minutes had clearly explained my options and calmed me down with her professional expertise. That was followed by one face to face meeting where all the paperwork was dealt with thoroughly and the procedure explained. The invoice has arrived and was less than feared.\n\nI would recommend without qualification. Thank you Emma\n\nDate of experience : May 21, 2020\n\nBrilliant solicitors\n\nEmma has been so helpful with all of our dealings with a property transfer as has Molly. We can't thank them enough for their patience and understanding as the process started as a simple transfer then, through no fault of theirs, became more complicated . They have been wonderful and would recommend Thomas Mansfield without hesitation.\n\nDate of experience : February 09, 2022\n\nA very professional service\n\nThe whole process could not have been easier. When I first contacted Thomas Mansfield it was suggested that it was all done on the phone or zoom. My wife and I wanted a personal contact and this was quickly arranged. There were long and sometimes obscure forms to complete, but we did these and then had a meeting with Emma Howlett.\n\nShe was/is charming, efficient and a lovely person to deal with. Most professional.\n\nIn all an excellent experience.\n\nDate of experience : September 22, 2021\n\nQuick, helpful, and clear advice\n\nMy mother in laws will had a trust written into it, that was enacted upon her death, and I needed some guidance on whether this counted as an exemption for IHT purposes. Having contacted Thomas Mansfield, I was very impressed with thier helpful and speedy response. Emma Howlett responded to my query professionally and helpfully, with some clear advice, which in the end proved all I needed. Such a refreshing change to most solicitors who only want to squeeze as much money out of you as possible.\n\nDate of experience : June 16, 2021\n\nExecutor for 2 estates\n\nI had the estates of two relatives to deal with, complicated by my lack of expertise and knowledge. I received excellent advice throughout the time it took to sort these matters out - and all through the Covid-lockdown period too.\n\nFrom the outset I knew I could make contact by phone or email to get questions answered or things clarified and these were all dealt with in a very timely way.\n\nDate of experience : February 10, 2022\n\nThey were prompt and efficient in…\n\nThey were prompt and efficient in dealing with my request . Also did not try to complicate or try to sell unnecessary services.Also good value in comparison with other quotes. But most importantly , due to the nature of the service they were providing ( due to a bereavement) they were kind , respectful & compassionate in their correspondence with me . Would not hesitate to recommend. Thank you\n\nDate of experience : September 14, 2021\n\nI found Toby communicated what my wife…\n\nI found Toby communicated what my wife and I needed, why we needed it (for the children), and the best means to deliver the outcome we required. We also discussed other matters I was not even aware of and am very grateful he bought these topics up as they are very relevant and important. Would recommend without hesitation.\n\nDate of experience : June 24, 2019\n\nExceptional Service\n\nAfter the death of my beloved wife Jill. I needed help with locating her Will which was stored with the probate office in London. Unfortunately the office in London had closed down and the record’s were distributed to various other offices around the UK. The lawyer and especially her secretary worked tirelessly in tracking it down. Once I had instructed them to have the Will released they were able to apply for a Grant of Probate so that I could sort out her estate. Without their relentless assistance and perseverance I would have struggled to to have resolved this on my own. With their help and support it has been a much less stressful experience. I would highly recommend this company as they really do care about their clients and as I said earlier in this review they really work hard at trying to achieve what they are instructed to do.\n\nDate of experience : June 14, 2021\n\nReply from Thomas Mansfield Wills & Probate\n\nDear Steve\n\nDealing with the death of a loved one is incredibly stressful and we are very appreciative to you for taking the time to leave us such a positive review. I am glad we could be of assistance and wish you the very best for the future.\n\nClaire - Client Care at Thomas Mansfield\n\nClear and easy to deal with\n\nSpoke to Emma Cocker regarding an employment matter, who was lovely. She put you at ease and was easy to speak to. She explained things clearly and set everything out in writing afterwards.\n\nDawn, who is one of the paralegals, is wonderful! She was the first the person I spoke to at TM and made me feel like I had contacted the right firm and she dealt with and arranged everything quickly. She is a lovely person.\n\nDate of experience : March 06, 2021"
