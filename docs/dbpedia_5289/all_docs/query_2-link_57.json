        "text": "A Mansfield middle school teacher is charged with three counts of aggravated assault after police say he assaulted his wife before he shot his sleeping son and stepdaughter Tuesday night.\n\nAccording to the Mansfield Police Department, officers were dispatched to 3 Arabian Court shortly before 11 p.m.\n\nPolice said when officers arrived, they determined that the incident began as a domestic dispute during which the husband argued with his wife and proceeded to assault her.\n\nThe husband then went and grabbed his gun and went into his 13-year-old son’s bedroom and shot him while he was sleeping, police said. He then went into his 21-year-old stepdaughter’s bedroom and shot her.\n\nPolice said the man's wife was able to escape the home and his stepdaughter called 911.\n\nAccording to police, both victims were transported to Medical City Arlington by Mansfield paramedics. Both victims have undergone surgery and are currently listed in serious but stable condition, police said.\n\nPolice said the husband, identified as 52-year-old Thomas Boykin, was taken into custody without incident and was transported to the Everman Jail. He was charged with three counts of aggravated assault/family violence involving serious bodily injury. It's not clear if Boykin has obtained an attorney to speak on his behalf.\n\nBoykin is an eighth-grade science teacher at Linda Jobe Middle School in the Mansfield Independent School District, administrators confirmed in a statement to NBC 5. Boykin is currently on leave and the superintendent is moving forward with his termination, pending the school board's approval.\n\n\"Mansfield ISD does not condone this type of behavior in our schools or community. Our thoughts and support are with the victims,\" the district said.\n\nCounselors were being made available for students and staff who may need support.\n\nThe investigation into this incident is ongoing, and detectives are still trying to determine what led up to the shooting, police said."
