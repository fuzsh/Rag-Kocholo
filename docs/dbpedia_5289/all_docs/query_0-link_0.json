        "text": "Thomas Mansfield’s Employment team has once again been recognised by The Legal 500, a leading legal directory which analyses and ranks law firms across the UK on the quality of their expertise, client service and standing in the market.\n\nThe achievement comes as the team, led by Angie Crush and Meredith Hurst, continues to grow rapidly and has recently appointed three new partners – Alex Kiernan, Jenna Ide and Julie Goodway – in response to increased client demand. Thomas Mansfield’s 17-strong Employment team advises individuals and companies on all aspects of employment law, and includes experienced litigators, who frequently represent clients in courts and tribunals, as well as specialists focused on resolving conflict through workplace mediation.\n\nThe directory describes the team as “a well-oiled machine when it comes to client care and service” and “willing to work during unsocial hours and around busy schedules, to ensure matters are dealt with promptly”. The Legal 500 highlights the team’s work for FTSE 100 executives and its expertise in deferred compensation schemes, LTIPs, STIPs, option agreements and multi-faceted remuneration packages.\n\nRankings are based purely on merit and reflect feedback provided to the directory from a broad cross-section of clients, lawyers within competitor practices, and other professionals.\n\nHead of Employment, Angie Crush, said: “I am exceptionally pleased to see the team continue to be recognised by The Legal 500 as one of the best employment law firms in the UK. The last 18 months have marked a period of considerable growth with an increasing number of employers choosing Thomas Mansfield as their trusted employment law adviser. We work hard to achieve the very best results for our clients so achievements such as this, and the positive feedback we receive from our clients, is very satisfying.”"
