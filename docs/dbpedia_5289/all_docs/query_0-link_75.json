        "text": "The widow of a \" fit and healthy\" dad who died of caffeine poisoning after downing too much of his pre-workout drink has paid an emotional tribute to \"the love of my life\".\n\nPersonal trainer Thomas Anthony Mansfield, 29, was left with lethal levels of caffeine in his blood after miscalculating how much was in his workout supplement.\n\nWriting on social media, Suzy, who had two children with Thomas, that her \"world has been ripped apart\" by the tragedy.\n\nShe said: \"My world has been ripped apart and my kids have lost their daddy. I've lost the love of my life.\n\n\"Tom passed away at the hospital, the family tried so hard but it wasn't enough.\n\n\"He was my whole life I'll never get over this.\n\n\"You were my life Tom.\n\n\"I'm missing you so much and trying so hard for the kids keep it together, I love you more than I could love anyone , I'll always love you.\"\n\nThomas, who worked as a security guard and a personal trainer, had ordered a packet of caffeine powder from Blackburn Distributions, a UK-based sport supplement company.\n\nHe mixed the powder with water and drank it shortly after it arrived on January 5 last year, an inquest heard at Ruthin County Hall yesterday.\n\nThe recommended serving displayed on the packet was 60-300mg twice per day, Liverpool Echo reports.\n\nThomas, who used a digital scale to measure the powder, started with 2g - already several times the maximum serving size.\n\nJohn Gittins, senior coroner for North Wales east and central, heard that Mr Mansfield was \"likely aiming for a mid range serving\" when attempting to measure the powder but instead consumed too much of the supplement.\n\nIn a statement, his widow, Suzy, said her late husband was \"really healthy\" and would normally drink no more than two cups of coffee a day.\n\nShe said that her husband \"necked the remainder of the drink\" after taking a sip and began \"clutching his chest\" shortly afterwards before lying down on the sofa.\n\nMoments later, she saw him frothing at the mouth and ran out of the house in order to seek help from her neighbours and family members who lived nearby.\n\nAn ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes and the crew used a defibrillator due to the 29-year-old's \"grossly abnormal\" heart rhythm as he had gone into cardiac arrest.\n\nHe was then taken to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd where resuscitation attempts were eventually stopped at 4pm and he was pronounced dead.\n\nFollowing a post-mortem examination, a medical cause of death of caffeine toxicity was given as Mr Mansfield was found to have 392mg of caffeine per litre of blood, the coroner heard.\n\nCaffeine toxicity can be caused by levels at 78mg per litre of blood or higher.\n\nIn his conclusion, Mr Gittins recorded Mr Mansfield's death as misadventure due to the unintended result of his own actions in consuming the caffeine powder.\n\nMr Gittins added that he has since been \"massively reassured\" that action has been taken to help prevent similar cases from occurring in the future with this brand of caffeine powder due to the provision of a scoop and an A4 instruction sheet in all new packets.\n\nHad these scoops been provided at the time, Mr Mansfield would likely still be alive today, the coroner said in his conclusion.\n\nThe instructions and warnings on the caffeine powder packet was not in breach of regulations at the time, the coroner heard."
