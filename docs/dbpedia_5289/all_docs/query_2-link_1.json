Mansfield Family Genealogy?\n\nTHOMAS[1] MANSFIELD, the progenitor of the Mansfield Family of Jefferson County, Ohio, was born, 1757, in Maryland. Nothing definite is known of his parents or their birth place. It is tradition that his parents were English and emigrated from York, England, coming to Maryland in the Colonial days.\n\nOf the family, Thomas, and his two brothers, Samuel and Edward, started west. They stopped in Pennsylvania for a short time, possibly a year and then came to Jefferson County, Ohio, in the year 1797.\n\nThe oldest brother, Samuel, enlisted in the War of 1812 and is supposed to have been killed as he never returned. Later his widow and children moved to Hookstown, Pa.\n\nThe younger brother, Edward, later moved to \"Connatton, Ohio\".\n\nThomas married his first wife, Jane SHAW (b. Abt 1760 in MD) Abt 1780. She died prior to 1790.\n\nThomas was married to his second wife, Mary HILL, when he came to Ohio. They were married in MD/PA? Abt 1790. She is believed to be of Scotch Irish stock. Thomas was a farmer and located on what was supposed to have been Government land - a quarter section which was afterwards known as the Dorsey “Flats” near the Bloomfield-Smithfield road and about three miles from Bloomfield (Bloomingdale), Jefferson County, Ohio). After living there about a year he discovered there was some doubt as the title to that land, he moved to other land nearby, where he lived until his death. Of his marriage to Jane Shaw there were born six children, all but one, Thomas[2] Jr. dying in infancy.\n\nOf his marriage to Mary HILL, there were born fifteen children. Four of these children were born before coming to Ohio, to wit; Sarah, Jane, Catherine and Mary. Mary Hill Mansfield was born, 1764, in Maryland. She died, 1851, aged 87 years.\n\nBurial in Long's Methodist Episcopal Cemetery, Wayne Township, Jefferson County, Ohio. Thomas Mansfield died, 1843, aged 86 years.
