        "text": "I was a 2-sport college athlete for all 4 years competing in both football and track & field at the Division I and Division III levels of the NCAA. I played at the Division I level for 1 year at Colgate University in Hamilton, NY and for 3 years at the Division III level at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. I set school records at both universities including both the indoor and outdoor all-time pole vault school records at Carnegie Mellon, the single game receptions and receiving yards record at Carnegie Mellon, and the freshman all-time pole vault record at Colgate. Some of my accolades included being an all-conference wide receiver, 2x all-region and all-conference in track & field, all-conference academic honor roll in both sports, and a 3-year starter on the football team at CMU.\n\nMy session plans will primarily focus on 3 main skillsets: speed/agility, route running, and catching (hand-eye coordination). With most of my playing career being as a wide receiver, punt returner, and kick returner and therefore, most of my expertise being on those positions, I will primarily focus on coaching the skills and abilities that will enable the athletes to excel at those positions. An example of a standard session at a high level would look something like this:\n\n-Warm up, dynamic stretching drills, partner static stretch\n\n-Agility cone drills, 3 sets of 3\n\n-Standing catching drills (tennis ball drills, distraction catching, quick reaction catching i.e. drills to improve hand eye coordination)\n\n-Agility ladder drills, 3 sets of 3\n\n-Route running - pick 3 routes from the route tree to focus on and perfect\n\n-Breaking at the top of the route + coming out of the break\n\n-Finish with a drill to work on making difficult catches\n\nNote: sessions will vary depending on age/skill level. For high school and college level athletes, I will mainly stick to the receiver position and sessions will be similar to what is mentioned above. For younger or more beginner level athletes, I am comfortable coaching any position or skillset and will focus more on the fundamentals of the sport or positions."
