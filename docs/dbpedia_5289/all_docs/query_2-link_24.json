        "text": "Life as an employee has become much more complex. These days you’re more likely to find yourself in dispute with your employer. Or perhaps you’ll need to negotiate a set of employment terms and conditions that suit you. Whatever your circumstances, you need professional advice that takes your situation into account sensitively, vigorously protects your interests, and provides good value for money.\n\nWe can help. A leading nationwide firm of solicitors specialising in employment advice, we are ranked highly in the major independent UK legal directory, Legal 500. So whether you need help with unfair dismissal, discrimination, harassment, employment contracts, bullying or other employment issues, then you can trust us to provide the best advice.\n\nWe are proud that clients value us for both our approach and our results and recent client feedback has included:\n\n“Brilliant, so helpful with an urgent issue. Really helpful and reassuring.”\n\n“This was the perfect service – efficient, timely and ultimately helped me resolve my issue to my advantage.”\n\n“It was the first time I had ever had to deal with anything legal and my lawyer was absolutely brilliant – friendly, good communication… and a fantastic attitude.”\n\n“Contacting ThomasMansfield was the best thing I did in my redundancy – they were excellent; 100% recommend them to any other redundant employee.”\n\nWe would be delighted to meet you in person, but we understand that this can be difficult. So, providing we have access to all the relevant documentation, we can set up a telephone conference at a convenient time to discuss your case. Following the initial discussion, we will normally be able to let you know your rights, the merits of your claim and likely costs. We can then provide ongoing advice and support, act on your behalf in discussions with your employer and represent you at tribunal or in court."
