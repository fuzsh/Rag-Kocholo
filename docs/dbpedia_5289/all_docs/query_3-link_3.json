In living organisms goal-directed action is seldom conscious and it is evident in the wild when animals stalk to take on their prey. The survival of living organisms is conditional. In order to maintain its existence, every living organism must take on specific actions to fulfil its needs. If it does not, it dies. I am happy to share that I will be speaking on the topic GOAL SETTING in a Career Growth Masterclass organized by Africa Impact Alliance Leadership Institute (AIALI). #goalsetting2023 #leadership #learning\n\nI hope you will join me and fellow speakers, the time zones may work; the cost minimal. I opted out of public presentations many years now, but BIOSS Southern Africa emerged from our first company, Third Foundation Systems, so I felt obliged to step up. I chose this topic because over an almost four decade career, themes that drive business, people and communities have in my view, stayed relevant and I don;t see them going away. #leadership #capability #sustainablebusiness #youthleadership\n\nMentorship as a relationship Professional development aspects such as training and coaching are more transactional. This is because it happens in a specific duration with minimal or no follow-up. It does not maximumly recognize the uniqueness of the individual receiving the training or the coaching. Nonetheless, mentorship is a relationship between a mentor and a mentee. In this setting, the chemistry between the two is essential for success. When running mentorship programs, one ought to pay key attention to the relationship formed, as a mismatch may result in poor mentorship outcomes. More importantly, it is right for mentors and mentees to set clear expectations as they kickstart their relationship. In this relationship, the mentor's role is to pave the way forward for the mentee. The mentor needs to realize that the mentee has a unique journey, bearing in mind that what worked for the mentor may not necessarily work for the mentee. The mentor should allow the mentee to make their own decisions as they grow. This relationship should focus on the mentee‚Äôs development goals. It should be a future-facing bias. Another key aspect of mentorship relationships is that they should be voluntary and not paid for. With all these considerations, the mentee is the key driver of this relationship. #ELFImpact #Mentorship"
