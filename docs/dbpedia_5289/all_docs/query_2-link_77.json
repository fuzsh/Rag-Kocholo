        "text": "Facts: Having applied for compensation in Oct 2008, the applicant was authorised to bring the proceedings under consideration by the respondent in July 2011. In March 2009, the applicant had retired from the Garda Síochána with the rank of sergeant. He brought these proceedings for compensation in respect of personal injuries loss and damage, suffered and sustained by him as a consequence of a republican terrorist attack, perpetrated on the 16th December, 1983.\n\nHeld by Justice Barton in light of the submissions made and the evidence presented to the Court, including medical reports that the applicant was suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the opinion of the Court it was accepted that based on the evidence that it was the resulting symptoms of the applicants PTSD, which led him to retire early. It was further accepted that whilst the principle cause of the applicant”s PTSD were the events of the 16th December, 1983, the subsequent traumatic events which he had also witnessed constituted in law a contribution to the initial injury caused by the events of 1983. It was further determined that the reliving of events through his viewing of a training video in 2007 was the “straw that broke the camel”s back”. Taken as a whole, Justice Barton apportioned 75% of the causation to the events of 1983 and 25% to the other events for which the respondent was not responsible and in respect of which no claim was made. In the opinion of the Court the figure appropriated to compensate the applicant for the entirety of the PTSD and its consequences was set at €150,000. With regard to the applicants claim in respect of special damages the court allowed the full amount of the non-loss of earnings special damages agreed in the sum of €1,580. The parties also agreed the sum of €73,918 in respect of the applicant”s claim for loss of earnings but without prejudice to the respondent”s case that there was no liability on the part of the respondent to meet that claim or that if there was such a liability it was only to meet an apportioned amount of that claim. Determining that the applicant”s decision to retire early was influenced and affected by symptoms of his PTSD, Justice Barton further found as a fact that the applicant would at that time have been entitled to make an application to retire early on health grounds. Consequently, he was also entitled to recover in respect of his claim for loss of earnings but subject to the apportionment as to causation. Consequently, it followed that the amounts to be awarded to the applicant by way of general damages and in respect of his claim for loss of earnings were required to be reduced by 25% resulting in a net award for general damages of €112,500 and a net award in respect of loss of earnings in the sum of €55,438 which when added to the sum of €1,580 agreed in respect of non-loss of earnings special damages amounted to a total award of €169,518."
