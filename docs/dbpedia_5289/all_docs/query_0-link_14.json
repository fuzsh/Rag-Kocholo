        "text": "MANSFIELD - Preserving the sturdy, brick Daisy Thomas house at 89 Wood Street will be a truly historic endeavor, taking residents and visitors back to the arrival of the first African-American settlers in Mansfield.\n\nSarah Daisy Barker Thomas — her full, formal and married name — was born in this historic house at the corner of Wood and First streets. She was an active woman who taught piano to countless children and participated in activities at the First Congregational Church. She was part of the group that founded the Mansfield Branch of the NAACP. The house she called home was built by her father and has been identified as a critical piece of Mansfield's African-American history.\n\nThe parcel where the house stands was purchased in 1874 by ex-slave George Barker, who thus became the first African-American to purchase a Mansfield lot. The current house, with its three-brick-thick walls, was built by Barker in 1875. Again, Barker made history by becoming the first African-American to build a house in Mansfield. A detailed history of the house and property has been put together by Scott Schaut, curator of the downtown Mansfield Memorial Museum. Schaut has combed public property records and has reviewed materials donated to the museum from the Daisy Thomas estate.\n\nHe gets excited when talking about such important history. \"This history is so significant for African-American residents and all Mansfielders. The house is such an important structure. It is as solid as a tank, and had to be built that way to last this long,'' Schaut said.\n\nThe museum has a Daisy Thomas display from her estate. It will be available for viewing when the museum on Park Avenue West re-opens for the season in the spring of 2018. Daisy was born in 1877 in the iconic home. She lived in the house until her death in 1973. The building had a couple of other owners, but has been boarded up for about 25 years.\n\nThe future of the house has taken a turn for the better since it was acquired last fall from the Richland County Land Bank by the Urban Minority Alcohol and Drug Abuse Outreach Program. This program has existed since 1990 and currently has seven houses in the Bowman Street area on Mansfield's north side. These houses have been renovated by the agency and are homes to recovering substance abusers. Some of these houses are former drug dens, according to Dennis Baker, director of the outreach program. The agency also has a community center in the old Stadium School and a medical facility on Wood Street, across from the Daisy Thomas house.\n\nBaker said plans call for the Daisy Thomas house to be repaired and converted into a community center and museum that focuses on the accomplishments of local African-American citizens. He said improvements to the house could begin this spring.\n\nAccording to the historical information Schaut has put together, Barker was a slave in Parkersburg, Virginia. Of course, Parkersburg is now part of West Virginia. Barker was freed by his slave master and father in 1860 as the Civil War was beginning. He came to Mansfield and worked as a cook in three hotels along Main Street in downtown. Schaut suspects Barker may have spent time in the northern army, although he has no evidence of that. His suspicion is driven by Barker being a cook, explaining that is one of only three professions that could get an ex-slave into the army. The other two were barbers and boot blacks.\n\nBarker and his wife, Harriet, joined the First Congregational Church, then located on Park Avenue West downtown. They joined the church because of its abolitionist position and because of Mansfielder Aunty Bradford, an African-American woman who belonged to the church.\n\nSchaut said there is evidence that the Barkers entertained acquaintances and visitors on a regular basis. He said it appears the addition of bedrooms to the second floor was done to provide space for visitors. He said the house served as a sort of community center for African-Americans.\n\nDaisy had an older brother, who later died in a drowning accident in North Lake Park. The Barker family had no other children. George Barker died in 1918, passing the house along to Daisy.\n\nAccording to Schaut, Daisy was very interested in music and received a $50 gift from Aunty Bradford to study music at The Oberlin Music Conservatory. Daisy attended Oberlin for three years and returned to Mansfield to teach piano to children for many more years. Upon her death, Daisy willed $110,000 to the Richland County Foundation to be used as music scholarships for African-American children. That fund still exists at the foundation.\n\nDaisy married Capt. Walter Thomas, who was an officer in the Ninth Ohio Colored Infantry in the Spanish American War. Schaut said that particular military affiliation by a former Mansfielder would be the subject of future research on his part.\n\nDaisy was also a bit of an entrepreneur. Schaut said she had purchased nine lots in Idlewild, Michigan, a resort created by African-Americans in response to segregation experienced in the entertainment industry. Daisy played the piano there in the company of such notables as Louis Armstrong and Count Basie.\n\nMansfield Attorney Ed Corley remembers visiting Daisy with his mother, Dorothy Corley. Dorothy was close friends with Daisy and ultimately served as the executrix of her estate. Dorothy was the wife of James R. Corley, one of the first two African-Americans to set up legal practices in Mansfield. James Corley began work in 1952 and maintained the practice until his death 50 years later. Ed Corley remembered and chuckled a bit when he said Daisy used to make dandelion wine from plants in her yard. He also remembers asking Daisy about the three seemingly permanent place settings he would see on her dining room table every time he visited. He said Daisy told him they were for the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nSchaut said George Barker and Daisy Thomas are important people in Mansfield's overall history. He believes that the Mansfield Memorial Museum downtown and the new center that is planned for the Daisy Thomas house on Wood Street will be able to collaborate and better tell the under-told story of the contributions to Mansfield history by African Americans.\n\nAbout this article\n\nTom Brennan is a member of the Mansfield In Bloom steering committee and is the retired editor of the News Journal.
