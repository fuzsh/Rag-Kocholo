        "text": "Michael Thomas needs a break.\n\nAfter 15 years as the artistic director at the Renaissance Theatre, where he has directed nearly 100 productions, he is taking a step back.\n\nThomas is taking on the role of artistic consultant. His final show as artistic director was \"Hello, Dolly,\" which wrapped up last weekend.\n\n\"I'm 63, and I've had it,\" he said. \"I overdid it a little bit this year with 10 shows in 11 months. One by one, it doesn't seem that bad, but this last one, I was sort of crawling to the finish line.\"\n\nThe New London native emphasized he will still be at the Renaissance and will occasionally direct shows.\n\nHe talked about his decision to take a step back.\n\nThomas wants the Renaissance Theatre to have a new voice\n\n\"The primary thing, in addition to being old, is I felt like I wanted to have someone with a new voice, a fresh voice, to come in and share their experiences,\" Thomas said. \"It is time for somebody else to come in and share their experiences.\"\n\nThat person is Angela Iannone, who will start with a one-year contract. She and Thomas went to the same college and have been friends for more than 40 years.\n\n\"I vetted her,\" he said. \"She's such an amazing and talented person, not only as a theater artist but also as an educator. I thought that would be a good fit.\"\n\nThomas was a good fit from the beginning.\n\n\"Michael Thomas has been a driving force behind the Renaissance's artistic journey,\" said Chelsie Thompson, Renaissance president and CEO. \"His dedication and creative brilliance have been invaluable in shaping our organization into the beacon of creativity it is today, and we are so grateful to him for choosing to share his talents here in Mansfield.\"\n\nThomas is an alum of the Conservatory of Music at Oberlin College and Wright State University.\n\nLater in Chicago, Thomas co-wrote the long-running “Hamlet: The Musical” with Jeff Richmond, performed with The Second City and also received three coveted Joseph Jefferson Awards for his theater work, including “With or Without Wings,” which was named Best New Play of 2001.\n\nRichmond was essential to the recent run of \"Hello, Dolly.\" He is the husband of Tina Fey, best known for her work on \"Saturday Night Live,\" \"30 Rock\" and \"Mean Girls.\"\n\nThomas' productions at the Renaissance include ”Assassins,” \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder,” “Once,” \"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Mamma Mia\" and “Dreamgirls.\"\n\nFrequent collaborator raves about Thomas\n\nColton Penwell has performed in 22 of Thomas' shows.\"Michael has not only been a wonderful artistic collaborator, but he has also become a very dear friend,\" Penwell said. \"I was never formally trained in acting or musical theater, so I have mostly learned by doing, and I could not have asked for a better teacher than Michael Thomas.\n\n\"His experience and expertise in this field is second to none. His contributions to the Ren are insurmountable, and I am so excited to see what he has planned next.\"Thomas premiered several of his original works at the Renaissance, including \"At Last: An Evening with Etta James,\" “Hot Mess: A Lethal New Musical,” “Twilight Gardens” and “The Last Act.”\n\nAs artistic consultant, Thomas hopes to offer some of those shows to other theaters around the country.\n\n\"I've never been able to do anything with them because I have no time,\" he said.\n\nSpreading the word about the Renaissance is essential, Thomas added.\n\n\"Being recognized nationally is really important. It's important for us to grow,\" he said.\n\nTheater was going through tough times when Thomas arrived\n\nWhen Thomas started at the Renaissance 15 years ago, the theater was not growing and was, in fact, in danger of closing. There were some major outstanding bills, something Thomas attributed to \"sins of the past.\"\n\n\"When we did 'Chicago,' they were ready to lock the doors,\" he said. \"We did that show on a $300 budget.\"\n\nIn those days, the Renaissance did not offer original works or have an education program. It now does its shows in-house.\n\n\"We have a theater that the people of Mansfield can really claim,\" Thomas said. \"You're going to see your own neighbors.\"\n\nHe said the local talent was here. The key was convincing the local actors that they had worth.\n\n\"Mansfield has always had low self-respect,\" Thomas said. \"There's always going to be haters. There are haters here as well. You can be collaborative, or you can be a hater.\"\n\nHe also is proud of Theatre 166, which allows locals to put on edgier fare than what is offered at the Renaissance.\n\n\"These are shows that we couldn't produce on the big stage, that wouldn't draw the audience,\" Thomas said.\n\nWill focus on Emerging Artists program\n\nThomas was instrumental in establishing the Emerging Artists program, spearheading this initiative and fostering new works for the stage and film, showcasing the Renaissance's commitment to innovation and nurturing upcoming talent, and bringing national recognition to the theater's artistic programming.\n\nHe looks forward to devoting more time to that endeavor.\n\n\"We haven't really been able to put a lot of attention to it. When it popped up, we did it,\" Thomas said. \"It needs to make a more profound statement, a more profound footprint.\"\n\nIn Emerging Artists, playwrights submit their work. About three or four plays are chosen for a stage reading.\n\nPlaywrights from all over the country — and beyond — have shown interest. One submission came from New Guinea.\n\nJason Painley, chairman of the Renaissance Board of Directors, recognized the scope of Thomas' work.\n\n“The artistic excellence that defines the Renaissance bears the signature of Michael Thomas,\" he said. \"His talent, leadership and network have brought the national spotlight to our community and to 138 Park Avenue West. His contributions, like our gratitude, will be enduring.”\n\nThose contributions will just be a bit different now.\n\n\"I'm excited to be able to step back and take a look at us rather than being in the weeds with everybody,\" Thomas said. \"It'll give me the time to really kind of hone what we're doing here to make this place even better than it is, and I think it's pretty darned good right now.\"\n\nmcaudill@gannett.com\n\n419-521-7219\n\nX (formerly Twitter): @MarkCau32059251"
