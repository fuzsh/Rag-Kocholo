        "text": "October 18, 2023\n\nThis novella is so good and gets straight to the point. Silas is absolutely crazy, which I love, and Hawthorne was just perfect for him. This book is very dark and twisted, with masked men, and murder. Make sure you check your trigger warnings before you read it, it’s not for the faint of heart.\n\nOctober 18, 2023\n\n“All I want is to live my life exactly how I choose. Unhinged and free.”\n\nI have goosebumps. This was so dark and delicious. Silas is 🥵🤤 and I loved how Hawthorne embraces his darkness. The spice- PHENOMENAL. It tickled all the dark corners of my brain. This is a dark twisted story of living your life exactly how you choose… and of course that way being unhinged and free. I am struggling to find words because it was so freaking good. I started it and had to go hide away in a corner of my house to read it entirely in one sitting. Absolutely jaw dropping. I need more.\n\nI have the immense pleasure of ARC reading this, thank you to M.P. Bates for having me on her ARC team.\n\nOctober 28, 2023\n\nI enjoyed this, it was dark and twisted. I would have loved a full length book, but it is what it is.\n\n🖤 \"All I want is to live my life exactly how I choose.\n\nUnhinged & Free.\" 🖤\n\nThis story gets straight to the point, showcasing obsessed masked stalkers. It was deliciously spicy and trigger warnings galore 😈 I loved it!\n\n🖤 \"All I want is to live my life exactly how I choose: Unhinged, free, and loved.\" 🖤\n\nOctober 17, 2023\n\nThis was so goooood! So dark and twisted and gory and sexy and everything I expected and more!\n\nSilas was just pure madness and I ADORED it. Some bits of this were tough to read, of course, don't take the CWs lightly. There is no morally grey here, just pure madness.\n\nHawthorns was submissive goodness, he just needed someone on his team for a change and, well, he got that 😂\n\nI loved Parker too, I really hope he's going to have his own book!\n\nI love this world, should I? Probably not. But I do. I still need to read book 2 and did plan on reading that before this one but I was too excited. I had to start this as soon as the download hit and I couldn't put it down!\n\n~I received an ARC from MP Bates and this is my honest review~\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nI liked the other one in this series better but I liked this one all the same. It all happened a little to fast which is to be expected since it's insta love but that's fine too. Silas was so dark and twisted, loved him. And the way Hawthorne was drawn to him pulled me in too. They were a little f*cked up but they loved each other and their messes just mashed so that was good\n\nFebruary 16, 2024\n\n“You can call me doctor, little dove.” 😧🤤😵\n\nthis was kinda hot up until 50% where it just fell off.. it was “dark” in a repulsing way. not a fan. LOVED the aesthetics but weird as fuck. not for me.\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nＳＩＬＡＳ • ＨＡＷＴＨＯＲＮＥ\n\nSilas would do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, for Hawk and I was eating it up. Yall better be treating our bean right is all imma say. Unhinged, bloody ride. 🔪🔥\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝘿𝘼𝙍𝙆 𝙈𝙈 𝙍𝙊𝙈𝘼𝙉𝘾𝙀\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝙋𝙇𝘼𝙂𝙐𝙀 𝘿𝙊𝘾𝙏𝙊𝙍\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝙃𝘼𝙇𝙇𝙊𝙒𝙀𝙀𝙉 𝘾𝘼𝙍𝙉𝙄𝙑𝘼𝙇\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝙊𝘽𝙎𝙀𝙎𝙎𝙄𝙑𝙀/𝙎𝙏𝘼𝙇𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙂 𝙈𝘾\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝘽𝙇𝙊𝙊𝘿/𝙆𝙉𝙄𝙁𝙀 𝙋𝙇𝘼𝙔\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝙈𝘼𝙎𝙆 𝙆𝙄𝙉𝙆\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝘿𝙐𝘼𝙇 𝙋𝙊𝙑\n\n⊰⚔⊱ 𝙀𝙉𝘿𝙎 𝙄𝙉 𝘼 𝙈𝙈 𝙃𝙀𝘼 𝘽𝙐𝙏 𝙃𝘼𝙎 𝙈𝙈𝙈 𝙎𝘾𝙀𝙉𝙀𝙎\n\n⊰⚔⊱⊰⚔⊱⊰⚔⊱⊰⚔⊱⊰⚔⊱\n\n* 𝙰𝚁𝙲 𝚁𝙴𝚅𝙸𝙴𝚆 *\n\n🔥 𝑨𝒗𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 - 𝑶𝒄𝒕. 31𝒔𝒕 🔥\n\n‼️ 𝙲𝙷𝙴𝙲𝙺 𝙲𝚆 + 𝚃𝚆 𝙿𝙴𝚁𝚂𝙾𝙽𝙰𝙻𝙻𝚈 ‼️\n\nOctober 29, 2023\n\nRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nSpice:🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️\n\nExcuse you !! Spice index!!! I love it !!!\n\n“Don’t worry, little dove. I was aiming at your shoulder. I could have easily patched you up and made you good as new.”\n\nThis was so dark and I devoured it completely! The spice was everything! It was short and to the point with a lot of details. It is a dark and twisted story and I’m here for it. Silas and Hawthorne love story is everything.\n\nSilas was playing the long game with Hawthorne stalking him every year he went to the carnival until he decided it was time to take his little Dove. He wanted his Dive to come play and boy when he took him, Hawthorne knew exactly how to play along, but was he playing just to escape Silas? Or was he going to like the games Silas played?\n\nAhhhh let’s just say chapter 11 the double stuffed was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🌶️🌶️🫣🫣 I was there for it!!\n\nNovember 4, 2023\n\nThis is not for me. 🫥\n\nIt's not bad written or something, I just don't get the vibe. The killings and lust weren't justified in my mind, the steamy scenes were not so steamy but almost creepy.\n\nI somewhat liked/understood the pov of Silas because he is an actual psycho so it sounded reasonable from his side.\n\nHawk side tho... not likely. Like he should run for his life, it should take more than 30 minutes to be turned from the sweetest boy to a sadist.\n\nSo I don't know, I feel like I'm reading Den of Vipers again, only this time it ended in 100 pages.\n\nNote to self: don't ever begin this genre of book again, it's hopeless. You need easy cliché romance or some deep delve into the psyche of your murderers !!!!!!\n\nOctober 20, 2023\n\nCarnal Carnival\n\nI first heard this title back in March of this year\n\n& from that point on - I was so excited for it\n\nI did get the honor of reading the first few chapters & I knew immediately that this one was going to be amazing.\n\nMP did so great with this horror novella\n\nFrom the scenes in the carnival to the behind the scenes with Doctor and Little Dove\n\nDoctor isn’t a good guy and he makes it known\n\nThis MM keeps the spice and shows the meaning of being on edge\n\nLittle Dove truly turns into a Hawk by the end & gets the freedom he has needed since coming to the small town\n\n& honestly - this whole trio of Killer Boys still ranks so high on my list\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\nOctober 2023\n\nKindle edition\n\n3 stars because of the plague doctor costume. The grossest thing in this book was the open mouthed golden shower. Nice little tie in with the first book there. I liked the MMM but there wasn't much of it given the shortness of the book. I'm curious what will become of Parker. The idea of an entire murdery carnival gave me chills. Another insta-love serial killer but is what it says on the tin.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\n5/5 - Midnight Black Romance 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nThis is how I like my dark romance books: bloody, violent, unhinged, and explicitly hot.\n\nIf you have trigger warnings check out the synopsis for the majority of the list. Actually if you have any triggers prob shouldn’t read this book.\n\nOctober 22, 2023\n\nwooooohooooo! “Carnal Carnival” was everything I was expecting and more! The only it wasn’t… was long enough because I wanted so so so much more! Silas and Hawthorne? 😵 Um. What a pair these two make. This is my first Bates book and I promise it will not be the last!\n\nI am very much a trope and aesthetic reader and like to go into books sorta blind and I made sure I did that with “Carnal Carnival” and I am so glad I did because I was surprised the entire way through the book. Bates has this way of writing some INTENSE things that will make you cringe but hey, if it’s what you’re looking for in a book, THIS IS IT! Look no further.\n\nBates combined all of my favorite tropes into this novella and I would have done anything for it continue on and on for hundreds of paper. That’s how deep I was in this story. If you’re on the hunt for a very messed up, bloody, steeeeeeamy, stalker romance with a splash of a room of mirrors and haunted houses, “Carnal Carnival” is the book for you. Check every single trigger warning and just know this book is not for the faint of heart!\n\nRating: 4.5/5⭐️\n\nSpice: 2.5/5🌶️🥵\n\nOctober 29, 2023\n\nThis book was exactly what I expected from MP and then some! The deranged activities mixed with some gruesome behavior, made me question whether I should seek psychiatric treatment or these events were normal. I have always loved how they don’t sugarcoat the violence of their torture, giving us explicit details about their crimes.\n\nNow, Silas is by far my favorite character yet! His demeanor, how he carries himself with so much confidence and leads others with the same energy, melted me into a puddle of sweat and spicy blood, waiting for him to come save me from the cold. And, “little dove”! Yeah, that did it for me, then Hawk’s, “little psycho” just threw me to the wolves for the night.\n\nEven throughout all the deranged and questionable mentally, Silas just knew exactly what Hawthorne needed (or didn’t need in his case). Their connection was instantaneous, with chemistry exploding into obscurity and only understood between them. I need more of this couple, or maybe a few cameo’s in the future!\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nIf you’re a fan of the fiercely protective, sadistic, mask wearing, obsessive, un@living type of man then Silas might just be your type. And don’t forget he’s also extremely dedicated, patient, st@lker type too.\n\nSilas definitely had an unconventional way of wooing Hawthorne. It does show how far Silas will go to protect what is his. (Alright - this is starting to sound a little too much like how Silas thinks 😂). He’s unapologetically honest, blunt, dark, and twisted.\n\nThe Halloween carnival is what brings Hawthorne and Silas together. But like most spooky carnivals there’s more to them what meets the eye. The violence in this book does get graphic and intense; be sure to check TW/CW.\n\nI��ve read a little bit of everything for romance this Halloween season, from sweet fall festivals to gruesome horror 🔪🩸☠️ nights. This book is one of a kind and stands in its own category. It’s a dark, insta-lust romance, with horror elements (torture and violence), k!nks, spice, and a t0xic relationship with a HEA. It blended all these elements into a captivating read.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nYou should be afraid, my sweet little dove. I'm the big bad man who's been haunting you for years. I know more about you than you'd ever tell yourself and I could end you just as quickly as I did your shitty friend over there.\n\n🌟 Star Rating - 5/5\n\n🔥 Spice Rating - 5/5\n\nWhat To Expect:\n\n🖤 MM Romance\n\n❤️ Blood and Knife Play\n\n🖤 Halloween Carnival\n\n❤️ Plague Doctor\n\n🖤 Mask Kink\n\n❤️ Stalking\n\nThere's no one I want more than him until the day I'm six feet under. Even once I'm in the ground, I'll probably try to get back to him in the afterlife.\n\n𝑨𝑹𝑪 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒅 𝒊𝒏 𝒆𝒙𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒆 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒏 𝒉𝒐𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒓𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒆𝒘\n\nThis is one of the darkest books I've read and oh my goodness how I loved it! It was grungy and gory and spicy and delicious! Everything about it was amazing and I want more from these boys. They are deranged in the best way and Silas is complete and utterly insane! It was not a typical romance but it was beautiful in its own way. I am sad it was only a novella because I could have done with a 900 page book, that's how much I loved it! I felt excitement and dread at times and I never knew what was around the corner! Overall another amazing book by MP Bates and I can't recommend it more!\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nI adore this book, this whole series!\n\nCarnal Carnival is the perfect dark romance that keeps the readers on edge till the end.\n\nThe storyline is unique, and the characters are well-crafted, making the reading experience immersive. Silas and Hawthorne are so easy to fall in love with, even if they are slightly unhinged and depraved.\n\nThis is written in an engaging style that captures the reader's attention from the very first page. The settings are vividly described, making the readers feel like they are a part of the story.\n\nOverall, Carnal Carnival is a captivating novel that is a must-read for anyone who enjoys their romance with a healthy dose of triggers warnings. <—this is your reminder to check the trigger warning list.\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\n\"All I want is to live my life exactly how I choose. Unhinged and free.\"\n\nAnd unhinged you are my good sir! I can't get enough of these crazy psychos. Dark, dirty, disturbed and deranged, the perfect amount of D's to describe the \"performers\" of the Carnal Carnival. Silas is every haunted house goers nightmare, the creep behind the mask, one who enjoys his job WAY too much and crosses the line between pretend and life altering reality. And then you have Hawthorne, who comes to the carnival with his horrible friends only to get lost and then found by one of the people he should run from. If you are in the mood for some blood and gore, hot smexy times, being double stuffed and just a terrifyingly good scare then step right up folks.\n\nOctober 26, 2023\n\nARC REVIEW ..... Well I never thought I would see the day where the Plague Doctors mask did it for me but here we are lol I devoured this so quickly, I didn't want to put it down it pulls you in and has your heart pounding from the start. Silas is completely unhinged and Hawthrone is perfect for him. This book is dark, twisted and filled with masked men, which we all love ;) and the edging was just top, my god. This is a short fast-paced insta lust/love book that gets straight to the point with all its gruesome spicy fun. If you're looking for a sexy horror read for spooky season or just any time, then this is one I would definitely recommend <3\n\nOctober 30, 2023\n\nWho else want's to now call Silas \"Doctor\"? This book was a rollercoaster ride that I loved and has made me want to get a plague doctor mask now. For anyone who hasn't read this book yet, read it the first chance you get and you'll get why. From Silas and his dedication/obsession for Hawk to the way their relationship just shines through the entire time. Yes, it is maddening and please read the trigger warnings before reading.\n\nIf you like spice and primal play/kinks, this book here needs to be on next up list.\n\nI had the pleasure and joy of being able to read an ARC of this book and am glad I got the chance to and to leave a review.\n\nOctober 31, 2023\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n🌶️🌶️.5\n\n~All I want is to live life exactly how I choose: unhinged, free and loved~\n\nThis little novella takes no time getting straight to the point! It pulls you in right away and you can’t get enough of it. Silas is so unhinged you crave more and can’t wait to see what he comes up with next. Hawthorne is just a man trying to get his feet under and find his place in the world. Little did he know he was just as crazed as Silas.\n\n“I wouldn’t call myself a murderer per se. More like a connoisseur of dark things that don’t always end well for the victim.”\n\nDefinitely check those trigger warnings though because mental health matters 🫶\n\nNovember 26, 2023\n\nRead the Trigger Warnings!\n\nIf you are looking for a very dark read, this is your book.\n\nI’ve read all the Killer Boys books and they are getting better and better. This one is dark, violent, gorey and hot AF.\n\nSilas is a very dark, dominant, deranged, twisted stalker. He is very possessive and obsessed with Hawthorn. Hawthorn is a sweet submissive boy who is used by everyone. He feels like he's been stalked by the plague doctor for years but he's also drawn to him. This year Silas will take what is his.\n\nI love how their relationship grows and how Hawthorn discovers more and more of his dark side. The HEA made me cry hard.\n\nOctober 19, 2023\n\nThis book is my favorite in this series. I devoured it so fast that I started and finished it in one sitting. It is just what I needed...creepy carnival, two engaging characters, and lots of spicy scenes!\n\nWhen Silas called Hawthorne his \"Little Dove\", I might have melted some. Yet as the story progresses and Hawthorne spends ore time around Silas, he becomes more than just a \"dove\". Yet, he will still always be \"Little Dove\" to Silas.\n\nSilas knowing just what Hawthorne needed! He had him on his knees. These two together are great. need more of them. Glad they got a HEA.\n\nOctober 22, 2023\n\nThis book is a quick hit of unhinged erotic horror, and I loved every second of it.\n\nSilas is absolutely crazy and is definitely proud of that fact. He has set his sights on Hawthorn and will stop at nothing to find out everything he can about him and make him his.\n\nHawthorn just takes all of Silas' unhinged crazy tendencies in stride and finds he actually qui3 likes them!!\n\nThis is a fast-paced insta lust/love book that gets straight to the gruesome spicy point. If you're looking for a super hot horror read for spooky season or just any time, then this is the one for you.\n\nNovember 1, 2023\n\nPlease check your trigger warnings before you start to make sure this book is right for you. We don’t want or need any one getting triggered. This is our dear Bate's darkest book yet which I am totally here for! There one is on page torture and murder…mixed into spicy scenes that leave you questioning your sanity in the best of ways! This is a insta lust that progresses quickly but still fulfills the HEA. I’m not going to spoil it but if dark and twisted is for you then please enter the carnal carnival…if you dare…. You won’t be disappointed I promise you that. *inserts evil laugh*\n\nNovember 2, 2023\n\nCarnal Carnival is the third book in the Killer Boys series and is an MMM romance.\n\nIt was a quick read, but be aware of the triggers. I didn’t think I had any, but reading this book, I sometimes had to put it down a few minutes and let everything sink in. It is a very dark book. Silas is dark, doesn’t back off for anything or anyone. And Hawthorne embraces his dark side. He may have needed a minute to process things.\n\nOctober 17, 2023\n\nThis book was so friggin good. It wrecked me in the best way possible. The chemistry between the doctor and his little dove has me weak. The ending was perfect. I am obsessed and will be reading it more before Halloween then ordering a copy. So. So. Good. If you like dark twisted things and romance and gay. Read this\n\nOctober 22, 2023\n\n5⭐️ 4🌶️\n\nI love this series. This is book 3 in K*ller Boys series. And each book gets better than the last. Silas character was everything. He was so deliciously unhinged🥵 And I was here for it 🫠 Hawthorne was the sweetest and he was just as dark as the Doctor. I couldn’t get enough of this book. It’s definitely a must read!!\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nThis is dark mm novella. Silas is crazy and has been stalking Hawthorne for years. Since the first time he sees him at the carnival, he becomes obsessed with him. Hawthorne has this dark side that is just waiting to come out. And Silas is just what he needs. They are perfect for each other. This is one you don’t want to pass up."
