        "text": "Delaware Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the killing of a 16-year-old boy who was shot just outside a carnival at Concord Mall earlier this month.\n\nZykier \"Zye\" Flowers was one of two shot in the May 11 incident. A 17-year-old boy is recovering after being released from the hospital.\n\nAccording to police, first responders were called to the mall about 10:45 p.m. for reports of the shooting. There, troopers learned that a fight had broken out near the carnival entrance and someone fired several shots.\n\nThe suspect then ran. The carnival had been slated to run until 11 p.m.\n\nThe carnival was temporarily shut down the following day due to weather, though organizers had planned to reopen in subsequent days once the weather cleared, posting on Facebook about various price deals.\n\nBACKGROUND: Concord Mall carnival closes after fatal shooting. Will summer carnivals go away completely?\n\nHowever, organizers decided on May 13, two days after the shooting, to close the event for the season âˆ’ following in the footsteps of other carnivals in the area that have closed in recent weeks due to fights and other incidents.\n\nAt the time, those on social media applauded the decision to shut down the carnival.\n\nDelaware State Police has not provided suspect information in the shooting, though anyone with a tip is asked to contact Detective Brian McDerby by phone at 302-741-2821 or email him at brian.mcderby@delaware.gov. Tipsters can also provide information to Delaware Crime Stoppers at 800-847-3333.\n\nGot a story tip or idea? Send to Isabel Hughes at ihughes@delawareonline.com.
