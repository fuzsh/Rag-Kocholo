        "text": "Overview of the events of 2023 in film\n\nList of years in film\n\n+...\n\n2023 in film is an overview of events, including award ceremonies, festivals, a list of country- and genre-specific lists of films released, and notable deaths. Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Studios celebrated their 100th anniversaries this year. The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Barbie were the only movies that made $1 billion in 2023.\n\nA huge number of the year's films significantly underperformed at the box office, attributed to high budgets, low marketing due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, and superhero fatigue.[1]\n\nEvaluation of the year\n\n[edit]\n\nIn his article highlighting the best movies of 2023, Richard Brody of The New Yorker said, \"Though a year in movie releases is a small and arbitrary sample size, it’s nonetheless clear that, at the moment, the art of cinema is in good shape in the United States. The overwhelming commercial success of two of the year’s strangest big-budget films, Oppenheimer and Barbie, released on the same day this summer, is an obvious sign of the vigor of the cinemascape. But the more crucial indicator of vitality preceded their release by several years—namely, the moments when these projects got the green light from their respective studios. One has blown far beyond the billion-dollar mark, and the other is approaching it, at precisely the moment that the superhero-industrial complex seems to be tottering. However, the studios are hardly the artistic center of the American cinema; they’re just one element in an environment that is fostering ongoing artistic progress. Deep-pocketed streaming services that can afford to compete with the studios—and even outbid them—have an incentive to prove themselves as purveyors not just of quantity but of quality, including by competing for awards. As for independent production companies, they can—and must—take chances on inexperienced filmmakers with big ideas and on audacious projects by acclaimed filmmakers with the name recognition to help sell them.\"[2][excessive quote]\n\nThe year saw an unusually large number of high-profile, big-budget films which subsequently under-performed at the box office, leading to the coining of the term \"flopbuster.\"[3] Several of the most prominent tent-pole films of 2023 which under-performed include Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,[4] Shazam! Fury of the Gods,[5] Fast X,[6] The Little Mermaid,[7] Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,[8] The Flash,[9] Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,[10] Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One,[11] Blue Beetle,[12] and The Marvels.[13] Many reasons have been given for the phenomenon, with one of the most common being the high budgets, low marketing due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes, and thus increased thresholds for breaking even and making a profit, all in addition to superhero fatigue.[14]\n\nHighest-grossing films\n\n[edit]\n\nHighest-grossing films of 2023[15][16] Rank Title Distributor Worldwide gross 1 Barbie Warner Bros. $1,445,638,421 2 The Super Mario Bros.

This marks the first time that actors have initiated a labor dispute since the 1980 actors strike. With the concurrent WGA strike, this becomes the first time that actors and writers have walked out simultaneously since 1960.[52][53][54][55] Film projects produced by these American studios but made outside the U.S. may also be affected by the strike.[56][57] However, actors represented by another union, such as Equity in the UK, may instead be required to continue working on projects.[58]\n\nJuly 21 – The Barbenheimer phenomenon occurs as Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer are released in theaters on the same day.
