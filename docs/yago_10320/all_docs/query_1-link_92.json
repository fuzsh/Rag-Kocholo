Those were two very evil men so I thought the title was fitting!!!

I hope you like it, I wanted a lot of variety on the new album, this is just a taste.\"\n\n\"Carnival Of Killers\" was recorded and mixed by Tomek Spirala of Studio1134 with the exception of drum tracks as he recorded them at Kiwi Audio with the help of Mark Walker.
