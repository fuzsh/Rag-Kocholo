        "text": "SASKATOON — Singer-actress Sandy Kaur, now based in Los Angeles pursuing her music and acting career, reflects on her enriching collaboration with American music legend Sheldon Reynolds, who sadly passed away at 63 in May. Kaur expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to work with Reynolds, hailing him as a role model and a creative genius.\n\nKaur's journey in the music industry began when she moved to Canada from India at three, her family settling first in Golden Prairie and Maple Creek before eventually settling in Saskatoon at 10. She grew up attending Evan Hardy Collegiate and the University of Saskatchewan there.\n\n“He [Reynolds] is a Hall of Famer and an icon. He is a role model, an amazing musician and a creative genius bringing lots of talent with his work,” Kaur, who is now based in Los Angeles due to her acting and music career, told SASKTODAY.ca.\n\n“He is creative with his craft and a lot of fun to work with. He is very professional and took things very seriously. He bought a lot of feelings and is meticulous with his work. He brought a lot of healing and help to people through his music.”\n\nLooking back, she fondly recalls her time working with Reynolds on their pop-jazz single \"Island Breeze,\" a feel-good song with a bossa nova flair that exudes joy and happiness. Additionally, she released another single titled \"You Belong\" in the pop genre.\n\nReynolds, a Hall of Famer and an iconic figure in the music world impressed Kaur with his vast musical experience from his time with legendary bands like The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire.\n\nShe emphasizes that collaborating with him was an enriching experience, highlighting his professionalism, meticulousness, and passion for bringing healing and help through his music.\n\nThe two artists crossed paths thanks to Jesse C. Moore Jr., who serves as the business manager for both Kaur and Reynolds. Moore's introduction led to a creative collaboration between Kaur and the music legend.\n\nKaur comes from a musical family deeply rooted in performing popular songs from East Indian films, sacred music, and classical pieces. Over the years, her family's musical talents have graced churches, private parties, folk festivals, community functions, and weddings.\n\nReynolds left a remarkable legacy in the music world, having been a member of The Commodores for four years before taking the lead vocalist and guitarist roles in Earth, Wind and Fire for another 14 years. His contributions earned him a place in the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame as part of Earth, Wind and Fire.\n\nDespite the passing of the music legend, Kaur cherishes the memories and experiences she shared while working with Reynolds, and she continues to pursue her artistic journey with fondness and appreciation for the opportunity to have collaborated with such an iconic figure in the music industry."
