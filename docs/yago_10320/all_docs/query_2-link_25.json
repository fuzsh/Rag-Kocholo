        "text": "Before you read further, there will be a few plot spoilers, but with this movie, it is barely a concern – the story is well known, and it is not the mechanics of the plot which matter, so much as the beautifully wrought character portraits of both people and the zeitgeist of America her bloody self.\n\n…….\n\nSitting in a beautifully disheveled movie theater in San Francisco’s Japantown, waiting for the three and a half hour experience which is Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, I looked around me at the rapidly filling cinema, and the faces filing in. The crowd was mostly older, white and came in two by two, like some pale Noah’s ark. A single Black American young woman sat near us and smiled. A few Asian families found their seats, but there was not one single face from America’s indigenous roots that was not hidden beneath generations of caucasian dilution. I sat there with my mixed race son, as he steadily made his way through his box of candy and smiled at me. People chattered, shifted in their chairs, and laughed loudly at the mostly inane trailers for action movies and Marvel thrill ride trashy experiences. I was here to see what Scorsese had to say about the roots of our beautiful country, and the brutal carnival of violence that ensued.\n\nScorsese is not so much as a director as a conjuror, who summons up the essence of the past. He is a dreamworker in celluloid and broken dreams. Killers of the Flower Moon immediately immerses the audience in 1920s America. The vapors of the pioneer era are still made solid and real, despite the signs of the dismantling of the bloody building blocks of the country, the papering over of the skeletons hidden in the walls, and the thin vestiges of civilization and justice starting to grow over the graveyards of the dead Native, Black and Asian bodies that built the wealth of America.\n\nIt are these vignettes of 1920s mid western reality, out in Oklahoma, that immerse the audience in the era. We have a sense of movement and vitality. Trains come in, a little man gives out pamphlets, photographs are taken in ridiculously out of place settings. The Osage are rich due to the ‘headrights’ to the oil on their land, but they are not free. Many have to answer to the white man to get access to their own money and account for every single cent and as to why they want it. We are moving away from the past, but nowhere near quickly enough. Still in 2023 we have not built up enough speed.\n\nPeople do the dances of their people. They do the hillbilly step, they waltz and move. They celebrate the flower moon as the drums try to heal the hurt and bring in understanding and empathy. Peace pipes are laid to rest as Osage are murdered at every turn, with white society feeling utterly invulnerable. It is continually impressed upon us that the Osage are not seen as fully human. They are not included in the list of ‘civilized tribes’. Their black gold good luck turns to blood in their hands, and the blessing from the Great Spirit becomes like grave dust in their mouths.\n\nThe audience around me was immensely interesting. Scenes which were anything but funny, were met with raucous white boomer laughter. A white man asks if he adopts the half Osage children of his dead wife (whom he has already murdered), that if they die (and it is made very clear that he means if he kills them), would he get their headrights and therefore their money. The lawyer elucidates, asking the man if he means if he murders the children would he get their money. The white man replies in the affirmative, saying he won’t bother if he would not inherit the headrights. The elderly white couple in front of me collapsed in raucous laughter. Scorsese held up a mirror to the audience to see who were are through the lens of his movie. Will be bristle, screaming ‘white guilt movie!’ Or will will own up, will we feel shame? Will we laugh at the dehumanization and murder of human beings that this country truly belongs to, or will we sit in outrage and heartbroken empathy. Guilt and remorse is the only human decent response to wrongdoing.\n\nAs the white relatives of Ernest call his Osage-mothered children ‘savages’ and ‘half breeds’, judging them as if you would judge livestock, categorizing them by the color of their skin, the visibility of their Osage heritage, there was audible laughter from the older white audience members. The couple sitting in front of me was virtually clutching their sides in grotesque laughter. Ernest is a bad man who could have been good had he made different choices. He chose to indulge his grosser instincts for money and pleasure. He is literally rotten, a point which Scorsese emphasizes by the constant motif of flies buzzing around Ernest, bothering him throughout the movie. The white men seek to marry and have children with Osage women but fetishize their native-ness. You would think this was a comedy by the reaction of many of the audience. This is no Clint Eastwood western matinee flick. This is a work of art and repentance. It would be bad enough if it was a fairy tale, but instead as a faithful exposition of a shameful historical event, their laughter was just proof of the vestiges of inhumanity. They are no better than Ernest and his uncle.\n\nDeNiro is a triumph as the archetypal villain, William Hale. He is the white man who speaks with the forked tongue, the easy smile, the fake words and the false handshake, while he seeks no more than to get to know and infiltrate the target of his murderous plans for money and riches that do not belong to him. William Hale was a bad man who hid under a fasacde of respectability. He pretended to be a friend to the Osage, and was their biggest enemy. DeNiro makes his William Hale an overblown villain, a snake in the grass, yet he is infinitely watchable, as charming as he is disgusting. I would put bets that some audience members are not even disgusted by him. “It was a different time!” I hear them say. This is DeNiro’s genius. He is a tool for Scorsese to paint his picture of society: a society that had been raised on being told they could simply take and take and own and conquer, had no concept of being told no. They had such pure entitlement to things which were not theirs, whether it be oil or labor or people, or land, that it was seen as merely a way to take what should rightly be theirs. A purely transactional logic, that was rooted in blood, torture and murder, even of their own families.\n\nScorsese clearly knew that not everyone who watched the movie would really see it and the easy laughter of the San Franciscan audience around me at the white men’s crimes against their Osage neighbors and spouses, and even children was at least as shocking as the movie. The ending trope of taking us out of the story and pitching us as the audience of a 1920s radio show, complete with old analogue sound effects and a string section. Showing us a 1950s audience sitting in a theater, was reflecting our own past back at us, the audience sitting watching now. It broke the 4th wall. Scorsese who started the movie by introducing us to it, and then who reappeared in the final scene to finish telling the story, drew together the pieces, to help us see that this is not a story, not a movie, not some horror flick, but instead a real history. The last images of cast drumming with Osage dancers forming a flower moon from their modies as they moved, was a gesture of respect, remorse and healing. True justice might not have been done at the time, but this loving retelling of the story of the attack on the Osage people and the murders is a gesture of repentance.\n\nThe movie is shot beautifully. Images and sequences within Killers of the Flower Moon are closer to fine art than they are to a mere movie. The shots of the ranch burning, figures silhouetted against the flames are in themselves moving expressions that stand alone as stories of great aesthetic beauty telling tales of suffering and loss and unfairness. The town sequences showing the wide world that these events are set in, with the slightly slowed down speed, calling to mind the stuttering old movies with few frames per minute of the past, both draw together the history of cinematography and the history of this country. They are perfect vignettes of Americana. The men shooting at the bell in the town square, the hustle and bustle are moving art. This is cinematography. This is the motion picture as an art form. This deserves to win every Oscar that will rightly be hurled its way.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is a deeply beautiful movie about a beautiful people, that deals with terrible and horrific events. It finds the love and the goodness, even within Ernest, who is given the benefit of the doubt of a measure of willful dumbness as well as extreme greed. He is shown to love his wife (whom he is complicit in trying to murder) and his children. When one of his children dies, presumably murdered at the behest of this uncle, his grief is real and total and his reaction is to finally stop being a coward and choose the side of right and truth…except it is too late. The scene where Ernest honestly believes his wife will forgive him for the murders of her sister and her sister’s family in the bomb attack, for the murder of her fun-loving other sister in such a brutal way, for her own poisoning, if he only tells the truth and apologizes, is perfectly wrought. The interplay between DiCaprio’s Ernest and Lilly Gladstone’s Molly, is both confident and understated. The inappropriate laughter from the audience in the theater I was watching the movie in chilled me to the bone, but showed how successful DiCaprio was in portraying a man who did not see the murder of Osage people as the murder of human beings, despite his wife being Osage and his children being Osage.\n\nThe theme of dehumanization runs through the movie right to the rotten core of the white men who murder and steal from the Osage people. As soon as we stop seeing each other as fully human, then we are capable of doing horrific things to each other. Not only that, given half a chance people find suffering funny. There was nothing funny about this movie. DiCaprio and De Niro laughed at the suffering, in character, and some members of the audience laughed along with the monsters portrayed. This is the sad state of humanity in 2023. Given half the chance a lot of people would revert to their old ways, their worst demons, their basest instincts. This is the genius of Scorsese. He holds up the mirror, the gorgeous mirror, the beautifully shot, the perfectly timed, the utterly nuanced mirror, and asks us who we are. He asks the question so skillfully, we are mostly not aware that he is even asking us. Who are you? Will you laugh at the murders and the abuse of the Osage? Or will you let your eyes get lost in the beauty of our nation, in the glory of the motion picture in all its power and cry a tear for the Osage people and the suffering wrought upon them.\n\nIt does not get any better than this. It deserves every award it will rightly get. De Niro and DiCaprio are a triumph. Lilly Gladstone’s Molly is the benchmark for female actresses. She becomes Molly, distilling the essence of her soul and spirit, summoning her very spirit back from the grave. The Molly who thought the best of people. The Molly who loved so totally. The Molly who fought to survive and to drag her children through to survival as well. The Molly who saw the owl bring death and shut the door in its face. Beautiful Molly is given new life, a story that will never die. DiCaprio and De Niro are the terrible twosome. Their chemistry is so powerful that they cease to become who they are, the actors, and take on the wicked mantle of their respective roles.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon is a triumph of cinematography. It is also heroic storytelling of a tale of both the America of the past and the roots of our present struggles with who we are as a people. More importantly it is Big Medicine from our own shaman, Scorsese, who summons up our past sins and bad deeds, and makes his own intricate apology. It is not enough, and importantly Scorsese knows this, putting his own hand on the drum, wrecking the ending to his beautiful movie to make his amends, taking us out of the story and the world so lovingly built and risen up from the dead, smashing that fourth wall, and pinning his own colors to the mast of freedom, repentance and love. It might be the best thing Scorsese has ever done, it is definitely the saddest. Film as national therapy, as art, as historical document has never been so enticingly rendered.\n\n10/10. Bravo!"
