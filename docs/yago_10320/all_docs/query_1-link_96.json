She got a co-writing credit on the song.\n\nWaiting For The Break of Day: Three Classic Songs About All-NightersSong Writing\n\nThese Three famous songs actually describe how they were written - late into the evening.\n\nGraham ParkerSongwriter Interviews\n\nWhen Judd Apatow needed under-appreciated rockers for his Knocked Up sequel, he immediately thought of Parker, who just happened to be getting his band The Rumour back together.\n\nJohn WaiteSongwriter Interviews\n\n\"Missing You\" was a spontaneous outpouring of emotion triggered by a phone call.
