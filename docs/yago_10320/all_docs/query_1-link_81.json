        "text": "Shipping Terms:\n\nOrders usually ship within 2 business days.\n\nUK Orders: Shipping costs are based on books weighing 2.2 lb, or 1 kg. If your book order is heavy or oversized, we may contact you to let you know extra shipping is required. If you are buying a small paperback or another small book then the postage and packing will generally be reduced by £1.50 and I will reduce the charge before processing your order.\n\nEuropean Orders: Shipping costs are based on books weighing 800g. For European orders I have only quoted a price for air mail. Not all European countries have been added so your shipping may appear high. Please note that I will adjust the charge I make if this is the case and postage to Europe will be lower than the rest of the world. If you are buying a small paperback or another small book then the postage and packing will generally be reduced by £1.50 and I will reduce the charge before processing your order.\n\nOther overseas orders: shipping costs are based on books weighing 800g. I will generally use whatever method is covered by the standard postage charge but if you specifically wish to have it sent surface or airmail or anything else please ask and I will amend the charge accordingly. Please only choose the cheaper surface mail option if you do not mind waiting - the suggested upper time limit for this form of delivery is 60 days and it can take that long - and sometimes a bit longer. If therefore you wish to receive the book in 2-3 weeks then please opt for the more expensive postage option which will guarantee airmail delivery. If you are buying a small paperback or another small book then the postage and packing will generally be reduced by £1.50 and I will reduce the charge before processing your order.\n\nBooks are usually wrapped in bubblewrap and then in cardboard. Please ask if you have any particular requirements."
