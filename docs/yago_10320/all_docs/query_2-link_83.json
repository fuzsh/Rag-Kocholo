        "text": "Now that Immortals has taken the top spot at the box office this past weekend, it's clear that director Tarsem Singh can open a movie, even if Mirror, Mirror looks like it's going to get stomped to the curb by Snow White and the Huntsman. Now the director has another film in his future as Deadline reports Singh is attached to helm Killing on Carnival Row, a unique serial killer thriller from Travis Beacham (Clash of the Titans, Pacific Rim) that takes place in the future within a city called Burgue that resembles 18th century London. However, creatures and humans inhabit the city and there's a serial killer is on the loose.\n\nApparently the film has been in development for a little over six years, and it almost got off the ground with Guilermo del Toro and Neil Jordan involved, but it never actually happened. Producers Anne and Arnold Kopelson are behind the project and while they're currently in talks with a studio start production next June in New Orleans, we're not sure where the fantastical noir-like thriller is being set up. Still, Arnold says, \"I am thrilled that Tarsem will direct Carnival Row. His extraordinary visual sense and use of light and color can be compared to that of the great 16th Century Italian painter Michelangelo Caravaggio.‚Äù Singh's visuals are stunning, but his work in telling a story that doesn't rely on just striking visuals needs some work, and once again, Mirror, Mirror looks silly, silly. What do you think?"
