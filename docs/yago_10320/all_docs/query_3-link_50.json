        "text": "Jim Parsons is weighing in on the possibility that there could be more of Sheldon Cooper in the future if a sequel to The Big Bang Theory ever materializes.\n\nThe actor was recently asked in an interview what it would take for him to reprise the role of Sheldon Cooper.\n\n“Reincarnation,” he said in an interview with E! News. “Next lifetime.”\n\nHe continued, “Never say never to anything. Life is long, God-willing, but I don’t think so.”\n\nParsons portrayed Sheldon in 12 seasons of the CBS sitcom. He recently reprised his role in the Young Sheldon series finale, a prequel to The Big Bang Theory.\n\n“It was very special to do that,” he said. “The feeling today is kind of odd. It’s the second time now because when we ended The Big Bang Theory it felt like this too, a little bit different, but you shoot that final episode and it’s wrapped for you. And then a couple of months later it wraps for the rest of the world and it’s a very weird feeling to flood over you again like that.”\n\nParsons narrated Young Sheldon throughout the show’s lifetime. Following the finale of the single-camera sitcom, executive producer Steve Holland discussed the idea of bringing back Parsons and Mayim Bialik.\n\n“I think in the back of our minds, it was always the thing we wanted. Certainly Jim, because he’d been narrating the whole thing,” Holland told Deadline in an interview. “As we got to the finale, I think Chuck Lorre had pitched the idea of bringing back Mayim and Jim, which was really exciting and so much fun.”\n\nHe continued, “But then it was like a balancing act for us. We wanted to make sure that we honored this cast and not let adult Sheldon and Amy dominate the last episode. I’m really happy with the balance we found. I think that Jim and Mayim are in it a great amount, but I think the Cooper family still gets their moment to shine.”"
