        "text": "Earth, Wind and Fire guitarist and co-vocalist, Sheldon Reynolds, has died aged 63.\n\nThe revered musician's bandmate, Philip Bailey, confirmed the news on Wednesday.\n\nThe cause of death is not known at this time.\n\nPhilip, the legendary R'n'B group's lead singer, recalled how former frontman Maurice White - who died in 2016 aged 74 - was wowed by Sheldon's vocals, as he hailed him an \"excellent addition\" to the group\n\nIn a touching tribute, he wrote on Facebook: \"This news of Sheldon Reynolds transition is very sad for all of us who knew and worked with him. Sheldon vocally had Reese down. Thatâ€™s what Maurice said when he hired Sheldon to share vocals and play guitar. Sheldon was an excellent addition to the band, a great writer and producer, and a genuinely kind and loving person. He will be missed. Our condolences to his family.\"\n\nSheldon started learning the guitar when he was eight, and by the age of 12 was considered a prodigy.\n\nAfter studying at The University of Cincinnati, he set his sights on music.\n\nHe first toured with the singer Millie Jackson, before joining the R'n'B group Sun, with whom he recorded three albums.\n\nHe's also known for his four-year stint in The Commodores, which began in 1985.\n\nSheldon sang on their 1985 LP 'Nightshift' and played guitar on their 1986 album 'United'.\n\nThen started his tenure with Earth, Wind and Fire.\n\nHe featured on four of their albums, starting with 1987's 'Touch The World', and ending with 1997's 'In The Name of Love'.\n\nWith his bandmates, Sheldon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1995.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated band also received a nod for Best R'n'B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for their 1993 classic 'Sunday Morning'.\n\nAs a solo performer, Sheldon featured on Maurice's 1985 self-titled album and Philip's 1989 LP Family Affair'.\n\nHe also appeared on Smokey Robinson's 1990 LP 'Love'.\n\nSheldon was previously married to Janie Hendrix, the adopted sister of guitar icon Jimi Hendrix, between 2001 and 2006."
