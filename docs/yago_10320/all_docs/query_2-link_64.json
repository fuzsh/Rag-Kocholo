        "text": "My 3rd Paul Naschy flick, and quite possibly my favourite so far, is a bizarre exploitation film unlike anything I've seen before. Feeling somewhat like Bruno Mattei directed a moody mash-up of a grimy crime thriller, sleazy giallo, and The Beguiled, this in turn delivers an addictively strange and sensational experience.\n\nI almost don't even want to explain the plot as part of the joy is following its somewhat irreverent twists but I'll just say it starts with a heist gone wrong, then stays mostly in Eurosleaze melodrama territory with some gory kills, and then ends on a superbly powerful note in total WTF territory.\n\nI should point out that I watched this with the English dub (the previous 2…\n\n| The short version: Human Beasts is a grunting genre grinder containing a yakuza start-up wash-up, (black) staff/lover whipping role (fore)play, a Nazi doc, Superman & Napoleon sharing a vet-fed macabre banquet. Meanwhile Naschy gets systematically roofied’n raped (in his sleep) by a teenager, resulting in a catfight over who gets sloppy seconds.\n\nListen, next time I come to vaccinate the pigs, I'll get you too. I'll give you a shot!\n\n{I can testify this is exactly what European flirtation sounds like!}\n\n| The slightly less short version: Let's be honest. The only possible justification of this maddening (yet surprisingly entertaining) equivalent of genre corn curdles wildly and randomly popping around, would be director/writer/executive producers/leading man Paul Naschy, hatched an economic…\n\nHuman Beasts, is a Paul Naschy movie that is a jumbled adventure in nonsense, which keeps blatantly hinting at cannibalism, but we're never quite sure, even up to the very end when there's a bunch of talk of stew, delicious, delicious stew. Who doesn't love a big bowl of stew with a glass of red wine? Reprehensible humans! Your worse than pigs! There are also references to pigs eating human flesh, Hannibal style. Does this really happen? Are pigs really the man eating sharks of the barnyard?\n\nThis begins a kind of jewel heist revenge film and then segues into a most nonsensical Giallo, involving a secluded mansion, a strange family with attractive daughters, and a zoned out Naschy who…\n\n“You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm.” – Brick Top, Snatch\n\nThe opening credits to this are amazing with a pan across a few Hieronymus Bosch paintings and some kind of sludge rock song that feels like ABBA getting the “Chipmunks on 16 Speed” treatment. So, I’m vibing pretty hard right out the gate. The movie wastes no time establishing my man Paul Naschy as a career criminal who burns the Yakuza for a briefcase full of diamonds. That’s certainly a choice and not what I’m used to seeing from Naschy, but I’m definitely down for a bit of a Peckinpah jaunt with…"
