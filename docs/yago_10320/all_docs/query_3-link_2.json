        "text": "SHELDON REYNOLDS At the age of 8, Sheldon Reynolds picked up the guitar, not knowing that his early musical interest would lead to an illustrious career. By the age of 12, the Cincinnati, Ohio born prodigy had become a serious guitarist with dreams of one day being famous. Today, Reynolds resume reflects the realization of that dream. During the early stages of his professional career, Reynolds toured with blues performer Millie Jackson and later played and produced music for Capital Recording artists, Sun. He went on to join the Commodores in 1983 and remained with the group for 4 years. Reynolds is most widely known as former lead guitarist and vocalist with the legendary Earth, Wind, and Fire. During that era, he also recorded with the group Chicago. His tenure with Earth, Wind, and Fire lasted 14 years, up until Reynolds joined Experience Hendrix, the family company of Jimi Hendrix, realizing yet another life-long dream of being involved in the musical legacy of the greatest guitarist of all time. Also to Reynolds°Ø credit are his work as writer and performer with a number of well-known artists, such as the Pointer Sisters, Stephanie Mills, Paula Abdul, Howard Hewitt, Patti La Belle, Maze, Bonnie Raitt, Buddy Miles, Billy Cox, and a host of others. Reynolds°Ø vocal work includes the musical soundtrack from the motion picture °?Glory°±, as well as the theme music for the hit television shows °?Who°Øs The Boss°± and °?Chicago Hope°±. His voice is also featured in various television commercials. Sheldon received an Image Award for Lifetime Achievement while a member of Earth, Wind, and Fire. In the mid-90s he was nominated for a Grammy award for the popular song °?Sunday Morning°±, which Reynolds wrote and recorded with EWF. In 2004, he was the producer of a talent packed project, °?The Power Of Soul: A Tribute To Jimi Hendrix°±. The project included top artists such as Prince, Lenny Kravitz, Musiq, Carlos Santana, Robert Randolph & The Family Band, Sting, Chaka Khan, Earth, Wind, and Fire, and a host of music greats. His proudest project to date is the formation of his own group, °?Devoted Spirits°±, which includes former members of EWF Larry Dunn and Morris Pleasure. The group toured in 2004 to sell out crowds during the Jimi Hendrix Tribute Series. In February 2005, the group released a critically acclaimed CD, °?Devoted Spirits: A Tribute To Earth, Wind, and Fire°±. The group°Øs highly anticipated, highly personal second effort, °?Devoted Spirits: The Answer°± promises to be meticulously produced and passionately performed. Reynolds currently resides in Los Angeles, California. ----------------------------------------------- Devoted Spirits preview The Answer with funk-rock single “This Generation” popular at iTunes and attracting radio’s attention While Devoted Spirits are in the lab working on the next generation of music from the rock/R&B/funk band, the first single, “This Generation,” is now available on iTunes. The original song, penned by the band’s Sheldon Reynolds along with Earth, Wind & Fire’s Ralph Johnson, has swiftly attracted the attention of online and terrestrial radio stations at home and abroad. The track, which will appear on the band’s second album, The Answer, will be released in January in Japan by B-Emotion followed by a U.S. release. Produced by Reynolds, “This Generation” features an anthem-like arena rock chorus, jazzy scat vocals, a funky groove and inspirational lyrics calling for social responsibility. Reynolds deployed fiery guitar riffs, keyboardist Larry Dunn laid down a smokin’ solo and Rhonda Smith (from Prince’s band) thumped the bass. Devoted Spirits is Producer, Reynolds (guitars, vocals, keyboards, drum programming), Dunn (keyboards) and Morris Pleasure (bass, keyboards, trumpet, flugelhorn). All three are former principal members of Earth, Wind & Fire, with Dunn being an original member. Last year, Devoted Spirits debuted with the critically acclaimed A Tribute To Earth, Wind & Fire (Thump Records Classic R&B/Experience Hendrix), a 21-song salute to their roots comprised of imaginative interpretations of the legendary R&B/pop group’s hit songbook along with one original composition (“Rhythm Of Love”). This amazing cd is now available on Itunes. Contributing to the album was a stellar cast including EWF founder and leader Maurice White, Norman Brown, Gerald Albright, Sounds of Blackness, original EWF guitarist Johnny Graham, Ronnie Laws, Bobby Watson (Rufus), and Teri Lynn Carrington. The Answer is expected to contain mostly original songs. Like the first album, expect the sophomore outing to be meticulously produced and passionately performed. Devoted Spirits hope to soon announce concert dates that are expected to begin in February. For additional information and to hear the music, visit myspace"
