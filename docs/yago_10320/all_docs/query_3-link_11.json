        "text": "SHELDON Reynolds, former vocalist and lead guitarist for the iconic band Earth, Wind & Fire, has died at age 63.\n\nReynold's death was announced by his former Earth, Wind & Fire bandmate, Philp Bailey, on Wednesday on social media.\n\n\"This news of Sheldon Reynolds’ transition is very sad for all of us who knew and worked with him,” Bailey wrote in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Sheldon vocally had Reese down. That’s what Maurice said when he hired Sheldon to share vocals and play guitar,\" Baily said, referring to Maurice White, founder and co-lead singer of the band.\n\n\"Sheldon was an excellent addition to the band, a great writer and producer, and a genuinely kind and loving person. He will be missed.\"\n\nConsidered a young prodigy at age 12, Reynolds began his musical career immediately after graduating from the University of Cincinnati.\n\nHe embarked on his first tour with singer Millie Jackson and later joined the R&B band Sun, with whom he recorded three albums.\n\nIn 1983, Reynolds' career reached new heights after joining the funk and soul band The Commodores.\n\nHe was featured on their 1985 album Nightshift and their 1986 album United.\n\nAfter four years with the Alabama-founded group, Reynolds joined Earth, Wind, & Fire as their lead guitarist and co-vocalist.\n\nReynolds performed in four of the band's albums, including Touch The World, Heritage, Millennium, and In The Name of Love.\n\nHe earned a Grammy nomination with the group in 1994 for the song Sunday Morning, which was up for Best R&B Performance by a Duo/Group With Vocals.\n\nAs a member of Earth, Wind & Fire, Reynolds was inducted into the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame.\n\nReynolds descended on a solo career after he departed from the band, working on projects with artists such as Barbara Weathers, Smokey Robinson, Joey Lawrence, Urban Knights, and Take 6."
