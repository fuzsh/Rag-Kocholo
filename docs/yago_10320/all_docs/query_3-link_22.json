        "text": "Former vocalist and lead guitarist for Earth, Wind & Fire Sheldon Reynolds has died at the age of 63.\n\nThe late musician's death was announced by his former bandmate Philip Bailey on social media this week. He shared the news alongside a photo of the acclaimed group.\n\nAlongside the photo, Philip spoke about his late bandmate Sheldon - who was also a member of the group The Commodores during his career - and said that he \"will be missed\".\n\nPhilip wrote: \"This news of Sheldon Reynolds' transition is very sad for all of us who knew and worked with him. Sheldon vocally had Reese down. That's what Maurice said when he hired Sheldon to share vocals and play guitar.\"\n\n\"Sheldon was an excellent addition to the band, a great writer and producer, and a genuinely kind and loving person. He will be missed,\" he further commented in his post.\n\nSheldon is said to have begun his musical career after graduating from the University of Cincinnati. He first toured with singer Millie Jackson and later joined the band Sun.\n\nHe was subsequently the lead guitarist for The Commodores from 1983 until 1987. He featured on the albums Nightshift (1985) and United (1986) before leaving the band.\n\nHis bandmates had included William 'WAK' King, Walter Orange and James Dean 'J.D.' Nicholas, who remain in the group. Sheldon hadn't been in The Commodores with Lionel Richie.\n\nIt was following his departure from The Commodores that Sheldon joined Earth, Wind, & Fire as lead guitarist and co-vocalist. He was in the group from 1987 until around 2002.\n\nDuring his period, they earned a Grammy Award nomination for the song Sunday Morning in 1994 and as a member he was inducted into the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame.\n\nSheldon is said to have worked with numerous other artists over the course of his career in the music industry including Maurice White, Smokey Robinson and the band Chicago.\n\nThe news of his passing has prompted tributes, with fans expressing condolences. One person wrote: \"A talented man with great principles in life. We will miss him\".\n\nAnother said: \"Sheldon was an innovator and an inspiration\". Whilst another person wrote on social media: \"[He] was a great player and singer. I was impressed by his versatility\".\n\n\"Rest in Heaven. Your mark and contributions to [Earth, Wind & Fire] will live on,\" commented another person following the news. Whilst another wrote: \"Gone but not forgotten.\"\n\nHe was described as a \"phenomenal musician\" and a \"kind soul\" by others recently, whilst one person said that he had been an \"amazing\" addition to Eart, Wind & Fire."
