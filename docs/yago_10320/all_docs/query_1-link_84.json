        "text": "The darker side of Stan Lee is getting its own cinematic universe, Deadline reports, with Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) steering the ship!\n\nThe “new cinematic universe” from Bekmambetov’s Bazelevs and ZQ Entertainment, Deadline notes, is “based on the unexploited horror works by Stan Lee.”\n\nThe first two films as part of the deal will be Carnival of Killers and Sawbones.\n\n“Some fans may not know this, but Stan Lee wrote several horror comicbook series in the 1940s and 1950s before superhero comics became big in the 1960s,” Gill Champion, POW! Entertainment’s president explained in a statement. “Stan relished revisiting the genre a few years ago when he wrote these stories, and we are excited to bring them to life with a director as visionary as Timur Bekmambetov. We think fans will be surprised to experience a darker side of Stan Lee that they’ve never witnessed before!”\n\n“Carnival of Killers, set amid the Dust Bowl storms that ravaged the American Great Plains in the 1930s, centers around a young girl with psychic abilities who senses that the traveling carnival she and her mother sought refuge in is ground zero for a looming alien invasion.”\n\n“Sawbones follows a frail 12-year old, Alex Covin, who reads a mysterious comic book and is transported into the comic’s terrifying world: a haunted Juvenile Detention Center overrun by demonic forces led by Sawbones, a homicidal entity who preys upon the troubled inmates. Has Alex gone insane? Or is this nightmarish world his new reality? If he is to escape, Alex must find a way to defeat Sawbones, but he quickly comes to realize that Sawbones is the keeper of his darkness and the personification of all his fears.”\n\nStarry Eyes and Pet Sematary filmmakers Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer are on board to write Carnival of Killers, while Matt Greenberg (1408, Pet Sematary) will write Sawbones.\n\nStan Lee’s POW! Entertainment will executive produce the movies.\n\nThe events of Alien: Romulus take place between the events of Ridley Scott’s Alien and James Cameron’s Aliens, with Rain and friends encountering the Xenomorphs approximately 20 years after Alien and roughly 30 years before Aliens. Ellen Ripley does not actually appear in Alien: Romulus, but you might be wondering what the iconic character was up to at that time.\n\nAs you may recall, Aliens revealed that Ripley was in stasis aboard an escape shuttle (known as the Narcissus) for 57 years after the events of Alien, which would mean that Ripley is very much still floating around out there during the events of Alien: Romulus. Her journey to the Sulaco is still far from over during the events of Alien: Romulus, if these timelines all line up.\n\nAlien: Romulus does mention that there was one survivor of the Nostromo nightmare, that survivor of course being Ellen Ripley, and we do get a brief glimpse of the wreckage of the USCSS Nostromo at the start of Fede Alvarez’s new movie. That’s the beginning and ending of the Ripley connections in Romulus, at least as far as we noticed on our first watch.\n\nIn a chat with the ReelBlend Podcast, however, Alvarez seems to indicate that the whereabouts of Ripley are hinted at in some kind of Easter egg many fans have yet to find.\n\n“I wouldn’t say it’s impossible,” Alvarez told the podcast when asked if it was on the table for Ellen Ripley to be worked into the Romulus storyline. He continued, “Because no one knows exactly what happened in all those years that she’s been drifting away. I cannot say more. I think for legal reasons, I cannot say more. I would say it’s not impossible. I think it’s totally possible that it could’ve been a part of this story somehow.”\n\n“There’s a few things that I’ve hid in that movie that is the answer to this question,” Alvarez elaborates a little bit further. “It’s just very well hidden. But they’re kind of hiding in plain sight.”\n\nHe goes on to refer to those Easter eggs as “a few clues I’ve planted in the movie,” while noting that “it kind of defeats the whole purpose” if he spills the beans at this stage in the game.\n\nThe website AvP Galaxy speculates that the Narcissus escape shuttle may in fact appear in Alien: Romulus, which could very well be one of the Easter eggs that Alvarez is referring to.\n\nDid you spot any other signs of Ripley in the movie? Sound off below!\n\nIn Alien: Romulus, “While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.”"
