        "text": "Carnival of Death is a quest available in Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines.\n\nAcquisition[]\n\nThe quest is received by reading one of several newspapers. The first one can be found right after the tutorial in the hallway of the Pawnshop Lodgings.\n\nWalkthrough[]\n\nBrief[]\n\nHead for the Santa Monica Pier\n\nGo up the ramp and down the pier to inspect the corpse\n\nDo the A Bounty for the Hunter quest in order to get the Mudd Hunt quest\n\nHead Downtown (only possible after completing a major part of Explosive Beginning)\n\nEnter the Skyeline Apartments\n\nListen to the answering machine on the second floor\n\nLeave the building\n\nHead down the street until you reach the Last Round\n\nEnter the warehouse across the street\n\nAsk the bum what happened 1 (optionally use a social feat for Masquerade Redemption)\n\nCollect the keycard next to the corpse\n\nHead for Hollywood (only possible after completing Patron of the Ancient Arts)\n\nEnter the Luckee Star Motel\n\nOpen the door to the last room on the left side using the keycard\n\nPick up the business card on the dresser\n\nGo back to Santa Monica\n\nEnter the Brothers Salvage junkyard\n\nTraverse the junkyard until the conversation with the killer begins\n\nEither sympathize with the killer and persuade (7) him to stop murdering people for a Humanity Gain or simply engage and kill him 2\n\nQuest Complete\n\nDetailed[]\n\nAfter first obtaining the quest by reading the newspaper found in the hallway of the Pawnshop Lodgings head for the beach through the staircase parking garage. Once there enter the pier by going up the stairs and follow it all the way down until you reach the crime scene. Next pick up and complete the A Bounty for the Hunter quest from Arthur Kilpatrick in order to get the Mudd Hunt quest which is heavily intertwined with Carnival of Death.\n\nOnce enough story progress has been done, specifically after blowing up the warehouse during Explosive Beginning, take the cab in order to reach Downtown. Once there head for the Skyeline Apartments (which will also hold a haven if the fledgling is in good standing with the prince). Enter Muddy's apartment on the second floor either by picking the lock (lockpicking level 5 required) or entering it through the vents which can be both accessed from the ground floor or any other apartment. Once there, listen to the answering machine to hear a message from an eerie caller. The caller told Muddy to meet him at a warehouse across some bar. The bar in question is the Last Round, so leave the building and head all the way down the street to the left until you reach it, then turn right to find an abandoned warehouse just across the street. Enter it to discover the scene of another brutal murder. First ask the bum what happened. 1 Optionally use a social feat or dominate him to convince him to keep the things he just witnessed to himself for a Masquerade Redemption. Next climb up the boxes to reach the upper floor without touching the fire. Approach the mutilated corpse and pick up the keycard lying next to it.\n\nOnce enough story progress has been made, specifically the completion of Patron of the Ancient Arts, use the cab to reach Hollywood. Once there, enter the Luckee Star Motel, head through the double doors, up either stairs and reach the last room on the left side. Enter it using the keycard found before and witness Muddy's brutal murder. Pick up the Brothers Salvage business card on the dresser.\n\nNext head back to Santa Monica by using a cab and enter the Brothers Salvage junkyard located next to the oil tank where Bertram Tung is hiding. Carefully traverse the junkyard, avoiding the wrecked cars and other objects thrown by the killer. When the killer sets a large area on fire avoid it by squeezing between the wall and some stacked cars on the right side. A few moments later you finally meet the killer in person and a conversation begins. Either be sympathetic towards the killer and persuade (7) him to stop murdering people for a Humanity Gain or engage and kill him to complete the quest, earning 2 either way.\n\nQuest Log[]\n\nQuest Log Updated: Upon receiving quest.\n\nGruesome remains were found on the Santa Monica pier. Perhaps you should look into this.\n\nQuest Log Updated: After going to the pier:\n\nYou saw the murder scene on the pier, but weren't able to find out anything significant about the killer, except that the killing was very brutal, vicious and beast-like.\n\nQuest Log Updated: Upon viewing Milton's body.\n\nYou talked to a bum inside an abandoned warehouse, the scene of the latest grisly murder. The bum witnessed the killing and told you the killer grew claws and ripped the victim apart while saying something about \"revenge\".\n\nQuest Log Updated: Picked up the card in the Lucky Star motel:\n\nYou found a business card from Brothers Salvage in Santa Monica at the latest murder scene.\n\nQuest Log Updated: Upon completion (if the serial killer is destroyed):\n\nYou have killed the killer, thus ending his reign of terror. And protecting the Masquerade to boot.\n\nQuest Complete\n\nQuest Log Updated: Upon completion (if the serial killer is convinced to stop):\n\nYou have convinced the serial killer to give up his quest for vengeance now that the killers his family are all dead.\n\nQuest Complete\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe serial killer, tagged as the Southland Slasher, can be found and spoken to at the Surfside Diner in the initial portion of the game, although none of his dialogue options yield any useful information or rewards.\n\nThe 2 experience points earned by witnessing Muddy's murder at the Luckee Star Motel are actually a reward for completing Mudd Hunt rather than progress in the Carnival of Death quest.\n\nIt should be noted, that even if the Southland Slasher can't be persuaded to stop killing, simply attempting to convince him will net the Fledgling a Humanity gain, even if he refuses to change his ways.\n\nNavigation[]"
