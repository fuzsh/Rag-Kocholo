        "text": "Jim Parsons is opening up about what it was like reprising his Big Bang Theory role for the series finale of Young Sheldon.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actor, who already filmed his scenes, said it was beautiful going back to his beloved character, Sheldon Cooper, which he played for 12 seasons on the hit sitcom.\n\n“It was even more beautiful than I expected it to be,” Parsons said. “One of the reasons I was excited to do it is because what they wrote is so sweet and I think they worked Mayim [Bialik] and I into that show so beautifully. I hope everyone agrees.”\n\nHe continued, “But also for us the way that they tape — because they’re a single-camera show and we’re multicamera — the whole look of the show was a really special experience. To get to go with Mayim, in a world we’re really guests and revisit these characters a little older, just a completely different circumstance.”\n\nBialik is also reprising her role as Amy Farrah Fowler in Young Sheldon‘s series finale, which is set to air May 16 on CBS. The episode will be the first time Parsons and Bialik reunite onscreen since The Big Bang Theory ended in May 2019.\n\n“We’re older and we haven’t seen these people,” Parsons added. “It just felt different, but it felt really, really sweet.”\n\nThough the Spoiler Alert actor has been a part of Young Sheldon as the show’s narrator and executive producer for its seven-season run, he admitted to ET that it took some time to get back into his former character’s headspace before filming.\n\n“Well, yes and no. We finished our first read-through, we didn’t tape it. We just went in and felt around the set, and Mayim nailed it when she walked back and said, ‘Uh, I thought I’d feel a lot more confident than this.’ I said, ‘Me, too,'” Parsons recalled. “I really thought it’d be like putting on a pair of old shoes and then eventually it was, but not for about an hour or so. And I was like, ‘Do I still know how to talk like this?’ It was weird.”"
