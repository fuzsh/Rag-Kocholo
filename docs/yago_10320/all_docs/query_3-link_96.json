        "text": "It’s official: The Big Bang Theory franchise will live on — not on CBS, which currently airs Young Sheldon, but on HBO Max, where a second spinoff from executive producer Chuck Lorre is currently in active development.\n\nThe news comes nearly four years after Big Bang wrapped its 12-season, 279-episode run. At the time, Lorre told TVLine that a solid spinoff conceit failed to materialize before the multi-cam completed production. “Unless there was a creative reason to do it — a wonderfully, wonderfully creative reason to do it — than the only reason [to do it] is economics, and that’s not good enough,” he explained. “This is hard work. And if you’re going to do it, you gotta love what you’re doing; you’ve gotta be passionate about it. And if you’re just chasing money, that’s not enough.”\n\nThat leads us to believe that Lorre & Co. must have a pretty spectacular idea in mind now. Might it involve one or several returning cast members from the mothership? Or will they go the prequel route again, telling the origin story of another OG character? Perhaps it’ll be neither of those things, but rather a sequel with loose ties to the mothership — anything’s possible!"
