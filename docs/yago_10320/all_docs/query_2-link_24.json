        "text": "I'll admit right out of the gates that I have not known about Macabre for very long. I first discovered them when this album came out. Being extremely new to the band I did not have any expectations for the album. The album art caught my attention and that was enough for my first listen. Straight away I was not impressed. The somewhat awkward style of having a mix of death vocals and clean vocals was very off-putting. I didn't understand what the band was trying to do. It sounded almost childish to me.\n\nA few more listens through later and it dawned upon me. I finally realized I was listening to a truly great and enjoyable album. Before I go on let me go over how I feel about Macabre. After listening to this album a handful of times I went back and poured over their past discography. Macabre was practically the only thing I listened to for a few weeks. Their past albums gave me the conclusion that my favorite era of Macabre is the early 2000s with Dahmer and Murder Metal. I know Sinister Slaughter is the classic but the Dahmer and Murder Metal just clicked with me more. I believe it's because both are more polished and goofy than Sinister Slaughter. That being said Carnival of Killers reminds me greatly of the early 2000s period.\n\nThe one emotion that comes to me most while listening to this album is joy. The songs may be about terrible people but they all manage to put a smile on my face. I can't get over how easy to listen to some of these songs are. I believe there are two main categories of songs here. There's the songs that are extremely upbeat and playful. These are the ones that also mainly have clean vocals. There's also the songs that are quite heavy and rely a lot more on solid death metal than jokes. For the first category the songs Them Dry Bones, Joe Ball Was His Name, and Warte, Warte come to mind. All are very playful and utilize clean vocals greatly. These are the songs that make me sing along. For the other type of songs, the tracks The Murder Mack, Tea Cakes, and Your Window Is Open come to mind. These rely on the bands ability to create tight and somewhat intricate death metal. All have tremendous playing from all members, especially Dennis the Menace on drums.\n\nOverall I was extremely impressed by this album. I know some like to drag this album and complain that the band sounds the same as it always has but I'm completely fine with that. There's no other band that sounds just like them so why should they stop making their unique style of music. The musicianship is top notch and the songs are catchy and fun. There's nothing more I want from an album like this.\n\nMacabre finally releases a new album after 9 years. The hype was quite big, since the band's previous album (Grim Scary Tales) was rather disappointing. \"Carnival of Killers\" is the name of the band's new album and honestly I think it's a good album but could have been a lot better.\n\nThe album starts with circus/carnival music, nothing new for Macabre since they have been doing it since the Dahmer album. It's kinda fun, not annoying at all since it has a short length. Then the first official track starts (Your window is open) and I have mixed feelings about it. The track's fastness reminds me of old Macabre but I didn't like the chorus because of the clean vocals. Most of the tracks here feature clean vocals so It's kind of similar to \"Grim Scary Tales\". Also the influence of children's music and nursery rhymes is notable. Some tracks work with this like \"Joe Ball was his name\" or \"The wheels on the bug\" but some other tracks don't work and fail to deliver some entertainment like \"Stinky\" or \"Warte, Warte\". There are tracks that prefer the aggressive side of things like \"The Lake of Fire\" or \"Tea Cakes\" which are really good because, they drop the nursery rhyme influence and go full death/thrash metal.\n\nI also have mixed feelings about the album's production. On one side, it sounds really clean and the drums sound polished and great. The same goes for the bass but on the other side, the screamed vocals sound too polished and the clean vocals are too robotic. The guitar sounds overproduced and the production style almost ruins some of the songs.\n\nTo conclude, I feel the hype for this album was too high. I felt that the album was good but disappointing at the same time, but at least it's not \"Grim Scary Tales 2.0\".\n\nFavorite Tracks: Joe Ball Was His Name, Abduction, Richard Speck Grew Big Breasts, Slaughter House, The Lake of Fire, Now It's Time to Pay, The Wheels on the Bug, Corpse Violator.\n\nWorst Track: Stinky\n\nIt's undeniable that there are a few gems to be found within Macabre's earlier discography, but Carnival of Killers will not be joining their ranks. This is the sound of a band that has so over-flaunted their signature sound that they've actually trapped themselves in a stylistic corner, so to speak, with nothing left to write but dumb gimmicky songs with no real value whatsoever. While this album definitely shares most of its elements with Macabre's albums dating back to Dahmer in 2000, its execution is by far the weakest in the band's lengthy history.\n\nWhile on Dahmer, arguably Macabre's last worthwhile release, there were certainly plenty of silly folkish melodies and singalong sections, that album was defined by its more pure death metal moments. Tragically, even those have been significantly watered down on Carnival of Killers; even the heaviest songs are literred with poorly executed clean vocal passages that ultimately render them all irritating.\n\nA factor that bothers me personally is that I know for a fact that this power trio is comprised exclusively of talented musicians. The jaw-droppingly tight drums and frantic shredding that filled albums like Sinister Slaughter immediately cement Macabre's members as some of the most underappreciated musicians in all of metal; yet on Carnival of Killers, the drum parts sound extremely sloppy and little to no effort is put into impressive or catchy guitar work. There are moments where a song's tempo changes and the band spends the next measure or so totally out of sync with each other.\n\nThe production is also godawful. The guitar tone is probably the worst I've heard on any major-label metal release from the past decade or so. It's flat, thin, and lifeless, blending in all too comfortably with the dominating yet otherwise boring bass parts. The frantic shrieks of Corporate Death have been run through a decent amount of artificial distortion, most likely to cover up the fact that his screaming ability has dissipated as he has aged. The drums sound quite artificial, which just makes it even more annoying that they aren't even playing on beat much of the time.\n\nCompared to a couple of Macabre's earlier albums, I think Carnival of Killers is a total waste of time. Low-quality production does little to hide the diminishing talents of aging band members, and the songs don't have the same punch the band used to pull off so well. If this were just a low point in an otherwise-extensive catalogue, maybe it wouldn't be such a letdown; but considering that this is only Macabre's sixth full-length (not to mention the first in nearly a decade), there isn't really any excuse for the disappointing quality found here, and I know they could have done better one way or another.\n\nBest song: \"Lake of Fire\""
