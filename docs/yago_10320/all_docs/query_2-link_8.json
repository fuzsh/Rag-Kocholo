        "text": "Meet the Characters from The Killer Carnival\n\nChandra the fortune teller was the matriarch of the carnival. She wielded secret magical powers that she used to keep the carnival mysterious and successful. When she died her last request was to be entombed in a fortune teller machine so that she and her magic would always be with the carnival.\n\nWithout Chandra the popularity of the Carnival began to decline. As the ticket sales slowed the carnival entered a state of disrepair.\n\nEventually the members of the carnival discovered that Chandra’s magic was contained in her mysterious fortune teller machine. Each member of the carnival attempted to use the magic to advance their own specific talents and trades. Unfortunately since they didn’t know how to use the magic and because they were using the power for selfish reasons they took it to dark places.\n\nThe display of second rate oddities was affected by the magic first. One of the displays called Spidora was of a woman’s head attached to the body of a spider. Previously patrons questioned whether it was an unethical form of taxidermy or a shoddy wax figure. But after being touched by the magic it was undeniable that Spidora was now alive in the most unnatural way.\n\nDr. Scott was a scientist and doctor that was expelled from his professional community when it was discovered that he was performing unorthodox experiments on his patients and coworkers. By traveling with the carnival Dr. Scott was able to continue his gruesome experiments under the disguise of a traveling display of science similar to something from the 1939 NY worlds fair. One day the doctor’s experiments began to work, he was able to reanimate a headless body and even communicate with it. Unbeknownst to him, it wasn’t the result of his scientific prowess, it was Chandra’s magic taken to a dark place.\n\nThe Carnival didn’t have animal acts like the larger traveling circuses, but they did have a collection of smaller wild animals. Dolph was a stable boy with aspirations to work the center ring of the largest circus but this was a position reserved for those born to prestigious circus families. Without any formal training to communicate with the animals Dolph wished for a way to be one with the beasts that he wanted to command. But even though Dolph git exactly what he asked for, wish granting is often tricky. Under a full moon Dolph now becomes a hungry vicious wolf. The transformation is a sight to behold, as long as the stable cage holds Dolph in.\n\nNick always wanted to be a magician and work in majestic theaters, but dreams don’t always work out. He did find a place in the carnival introducing the various acts while occasionally performing some of his mediocre magic. When Chandra’s real magic was released, Nick’s acts became a lot more spectacular. He went from performing hack card tricks to daring escapes and mind reading miracles. He had a rabbit named Jack but he escaped.\n\nWhen Jack escaped and became enchanted by the magic, he grew into a hybrid man rabbit. While he doesn’t speak much, he tries to replicate the magic he's seen, like cutting a person in half with a chainsaw.\n\nDevlin was a carnival ride mechanic/operator that was horribly disfigured in an accident involving a ride malfunction. He was able to continue the maintenance of the rides out of the public’s view so that they wouldn’t judge the way he looks. Devlin didn’t want this life though, he wanted to make people laugh and smile, he wanted to be a clown. No amount of makeup would cover his scars so he was never allowed on the midway. But if Devlin couldn’t go out to be with the people, he would bring the people to him. Devlin diverted the mirror maze in the funhouse to bring the patrons to his lair where he could play all of his sick jokes on them. After years of being hidden away, he no longer wants to make people laugh, he wants to hear them scream."
