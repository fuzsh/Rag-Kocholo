(WRDW/WAGT) -- Drew Exposition Carnival, sometimes called \"America's Amusement Park on Tour\", says an accused serial killer never worked for them.\n\nhas been arrested in Virginia for the deaths of three women, including a Cobb County teen.\n\nAccording to a press release from the company, Wright was never and has never been an employee of theirs. He hasn't worked for any of their affiliated companies either. Drew Expositions says Wright worked \"from time to time\" with someone who owns a livestock show called \"Pony Express\" in Blountville, Tenn. Those animals never came to their events\n\nThe owner of \"Pony Express\" says Wright stopped working for him last year.\n\nThe company says they have been told Wright was working on a trash truck when the murders happened and had previously been working at a McDonald's restaurant. He was allegedly working as a \"bundler\" at a building supply company when he was arrested.\n\nIn closing, Drew Exposition says they \"will pray for the families of the victims and continue to work with law enforcement.\""
