        "text": "Jim Parsons is teasing how filming the Young Sheldon series finale was for him reprising his role from The Big Bang Theory.\n\nThe actor is set to play the role of Sheldon Cooper in the final episode of the spinoff prequel series set for May 16 alongside Mayim Bialik.\n\nWhile being interviewed on Today on Friday, May 29, Parsons called the experience “very weird. Also very beautiful.”\n\n“Big Bang Theory was always a live-audience show and Young Sheldon is a single-camera show, and I got to do it with Mayim — we both played Sheldon and Amy from the series — and to do it in that situation, it was just different enough that it wasn’t creepy,” Parsons said on the NBC morning show. “Like going like, ‘What are we doing here again?!’ Instead, it was really sweet. It felt like the nicest little coda to the whole experience, and I was very grateful that they asked us to do it.”\n\nParsons played Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory throughout its 12-season run. The actor narrated Young Sheldon through all seven seasons, which starred Iain Armitage as the younger Sheldon Cooper. The show also starred Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, Annie Potts, Matt Hobby, Wyatt McClure, and Emily Osment.\n\nCBS recently ordered a Young Sheldon spinoff starring Jordan and Osment. The series will follow Georgie (Jordan) and Mandy (Osment) as they raise their young family in Texas while navigating the challenges of adulthood, parenting and marriage.\n\nWatch Parsons’s interview on the Today show in the video below."
