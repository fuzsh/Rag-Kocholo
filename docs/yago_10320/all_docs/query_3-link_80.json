        "text": "Open Questions\n\nShould We Think of Our Children as Strangers?\n\nA new line of inquiry asks us to imagine them as random individuals who just happen to live in our homes.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nHow Gena Rowlands Redefined the Art of Movie Acting\n\nThe actress, who died last week, at the age of ninety-four, changed the history of cinema in her collaborations with the actor and director John Cassavetes.\n\nBooks\n\nIs A.I. Making Mothers Obsolete?\n\nHelen Phillips’s new novel takes place in a dystopian world where humans have outsourced their best selves to tireless, empathetic robots.\n\nQ. & A.\n\nThe Latest Presidential Polls, and What They Might Be Missing\n\nNate Cohn, the New York Times’ chief political analyst, breaks down Kamala Harris’s performance in the battleground states.\n\nEpisode 1: The Green Grass\n\nA man in Haditha, Iraq, has a request for the In the Dark team: Can you investigate how my family was killed?\n\nEpisode 2: I Have Questions\n\nA trip to a Marine Corps archive reveals a clue about something that the U.S. military is keeping secret.\n\nEpisode 3: Sounds Like Murder\n\nWe travel around the U.S. to find the Marines who were on the ground in Haditha on the day of the killings.\n\nEpisode 4: What They Saw\n\nTwo conflicting stories about what happened that day emerge—one from the Marines involved in the killings, and another from a very different perspective.\n\nEpisode 5: Four Brothers\n\nWas it a face-off with insurgents or the murder of four innocent brothers? We investigate what happened in the final house the Marines entered that day.\n\nEpisode 6: The Full Picture\n\nStartling new information emerges from deep within the investigation files. Then the In the Dark team gets a big break.\n\nCan MAGA Be Multicultural?\n\nMaking sense of Trump’s appeal to nonwhite voters.\n\nDonald Trump’s Got Troubles\n\nHis campaign is careening, his poll numbers are slipping, and, after a summer lull, he is due for several confrontations in court.\n\nTaylor Swift and Her Fans Are in Their “Fearless” Era\n\nFollowing a terrorist threat targeting her concerts in Vienna, the tour continues.\n\nThe Warped World of the U.K. Rioters\n\nA wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant violence raises the possibility that, while the U.K. has become more multicultural, it has also become more racist.\n\nLetter from Biden’s Washington\n\nKamala Harris’s Best Campaign Surrogate Is Donald Trump\n\nThe ex-President’s tired old show is a great advertisement for his new rival.\n\nThe Sporting Scene\n\nPaul Skenes Is a Heroic Figure in Baseball’s Antiheroic Age\n\nThe tall, young, mustachioed pitcher throws hard—so hard that his team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, is doing everything it can to be careful with him.\n\nFault Lines\n\nWhat Makes Nancy Pelosi So Appealing Now\n\nHer ruthless pragmatism and reliance on subtext are refreshing after years of lefty infighting and Donald Trump’s endless blather.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nPopping the Bubble of Noise-Cancelling Headphones\n\nA new Japanese-designed device promises to “unmute the world,” as if it were no longer possible to do so simply by uncovering your ears.\n\nThe Current Cinema\n\nWith “Close Your Eyes,” a Legendary Filmmaker Makes a Stunning Return\n\nIn his first feature in more than two decades, the Spanish director Víctor Erice tells a story haunted by the ghosts of cinema past.\n\nPhoto Booth\n\nThe Outback Observed, and Transformed\n\nFor “Big Sky,” the Australian photographer Adam Ferguson went in search of his own country, and found a place he both did and didn’t know.\n\nA Critic at Large\n\nAre Bookstores Just a Waste of Space?\n\nIn the online era, brick-and-mortar book retailers have been forced to redefine themselves.\n\nThe Front Row\n\nJacques Rozier’s Inspired Improvisations\n\nA retrospective of the great director’s rarely screened movies reveals his extraordinary vision of ordinary life.\n\nUnder Review\n\nA Frank Account of an Unequal Art-World Friendship\n\nOrlando Whitfield’s memoir of his fifteen-year friendship with the disgraced art dealer Inigo Philbrick gives a momentous relationship its due, with unusual directness.\n\nCritics at Large\n\nCharli XCX, Chappell Roan, and the Unstable Hierarchy of Pop\n\nThis summer’s releases have breathed new life into the genre—and underscored the challenges of staying relevant in a cutthroat music landscape.\n\nWhat Tweens Get from Sephora\n\nKids are mimicking the semi-professionals they see on their phones, imbibing ideas about beauty rooted in deep desires and capitulations.\n\nAn Ode to Old Bay\n\nThe condiment is a spice-and-herb mix that’s super salty and slightly sweet, a perfect culinary simulation of late summer and early fall. Marylanders put it on everything; everybody should.\n\nHow a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters\n\nA mysterious neurological condition makes faces look grotesque—and sheds new light on the inner workings of the brain.\n\nHow Christian Fundamentalism Was Born Again\n\nNearly a century ago, a single trial seemed to shatter the movement’s place in America. It’s returned in a new form—but for old reasons.\n\nThe Story That “Hillbilly Elegy” Doesn’t Tell\n\nLike many memoirs, J. D. Vance’s book misses a few details, some of which complicate the story upon which he has based much of his politics.\n\nThe Ghosts of the Cuban National Ballet\n\nDiana Markosian’s images of a once great institution have an aura of decay and pose a question about what motivates the dancers who remain."
