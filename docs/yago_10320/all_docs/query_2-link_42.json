        "text": "Decadence and murder found on the dark side of the big city pales in comparison to the freak show found by undercover US narcotics agent Bob Clark in The Carnival of Death.\n\nClark’s investigation begins with cocaine and leads to cold-blooded murder—the discovery of one, and then another, headless corpse. Who is behind the slaughter? Are the killings tied to the drug traffic? Or is a deeper, darker, and even more sinister conspiracy unfolding in the carnival?\n\nThere are plenty of distractions—bright lights and beautiful girls—but Clark better find the murderers of the midway fast. Because the next head that rolls could very well be his own.\n\nAlso includes the mystery “The Death Flyer,” in which a man and woman find themselves trapped on a ghost train and bound for a deadly crash … unless they can find a way to derail fate and cheat death—on the fly.\n\n“Roars to life.” —Library Journal\n\nSAMPLE\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nIn 1934, while living in New York, the heart of the publishing industry, L.
