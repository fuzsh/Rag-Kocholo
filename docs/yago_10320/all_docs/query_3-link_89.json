        "text": "+ Where are you from?\n\nLos Angeles.\n\n+ Where do you live now?\n\nBrooklyn.\n\n+ Do you have any pets?\n\nA very stupid cat named Gigi who seems to constantly forget who we are and is terrified of us. We love her anyway.\n\nAnd Libba Bray has a dog and I'm the god mama so it sleeps over at my house sometimes.\n\n+ Why do you write books?\n\nBecause it is cheaper than therapy.\n\nAnd because you guys read them. Thank you for reading them. Without you, I couldn’t do this.\n\n+ Have you always been a writer?\n\nI started writing as soon as I learned my letters. If you want to know when I started writing professionally, that took a bit longer. It wasn’t until after college, when I became a journalist. If you want to know when I started writing novels, not until the ripe old age of 34. There is a hidden message in here, oh 14-year-old-panicking-about-not-publishing-a-book-yet: It’s not a race. It’s a marathon… or some non-sports-related metaphor of your choosing.\n\n+ Are you a musician?\n\nNot even a little bit, but if you think I am because of my books, I’m so glad because it means I did a good job of fooling you.\n\n+ What's your favorite band?\n\nThis is as impossible a question as, \"Who is your favorite author?\" But a selection, in no particular order: Velvet Underground. Sonic Youth. The Pixies. Nirvana. The B-52s. The Go-Gos. Magnetic Fields. Beat Happening. U2. The Waterboys. The Rolling Stones. Bikini Kill. Mumford & Sons. The Modern Lovers. The Clash. Heavens to Betsy.\n\n+ I'm writing a paper about you. Can you help?\n\nNot really—I'm busy writing! But I would recommend that you read through this FAQ (the page you're on right now), and also check out this page for more information about me.\n\n+ What was the inspiration for If I Stay?\n\nIf I Stay came from a very personal place. I go into a lot of detail about the story behind the story in the extra bonus material in the paperback, but in a nutshell, here is the deal:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a family: a mom, a dad, a little boy like Teddy and another little boy, just a baby. And once upon a time, there was a snow day. And a drive in a car. And a mysterious car accident. And an unfathomable tragedy. Once upon a time, one of those family members held on a little longer, though by the time the news reached me, all the way across the country in New York City, the devastation was complete. The whole family had died. But that little boy’s act of tenacity, followed by his surrender, it haunted me. Did that one little boy know what had happened to the rest of his family? Did he choose to go with them? It was out of the fog of that persistent question that one day, almost seven years after the fact, this total stranger popped into my consciousness. Her name was Mia. She was 17 years old. And a cello player. And she had no relation whatsoever to the people I knew. But the minute I met her I knew she was going to take me on a journey, to answer that question that had been living in me for years: What would you do if you had to choose?\n\n+ Was If I Stay based on true events?\n\nThe car accident was based on personal events, the rest of the story, and the characters of Mia and Adam in particular, came from my imagination. I’ve never been in an accident like that. Never had an out-of-body experience. I don’t play the cello (or any instrument) nor has a ever asked me to play him like a cello, either. Novels are an interesting stew, a bit of real life might provide a premise or a need to explore certain terrain. And then these fictional people show up on the scene to help you do what you need to do.\n\n+ What was the inspiration for Where She Went?\n\nAnswer contains SPOILERS for If I Stay. Okay, here’s the deal: I never intended to write a sequel. After finishing IIS, I had an entirely different book I planned to write but Adam and Mia…well, they had different ideas. Even though I’d ended IIS on a hopeful note, I’d left Adam and Mia in a pretty rocky spot—I warned you about spoilers! Adam had made this enormous promise, with serious consequences for both of them. And Mia had made this enormous decision, with serious consequences for both of them. Turns out, my unruly characters were not content to sit out there, in limbo. They started banging on this drum in my head. Hey lady, you put us through that to leave us here? So, they sort of bossed me into writing the sequel.\n\n+ Was Where She Went based on true events?\n\nBits of personal events always filter into your stories but Where She Went is probably the least connected to my life of all of my stories. I’m not a 21-year-old angst-ridden rock star, though I do share Adam’s superstitious side and some of his conflicts about when creative and commercial intersect. I am not usually recognized, except by my children’s friends and that’s only to be identified as so-and-so’s mom. The New York City you travel through in Where She Went, however, is very much my city. And the way grieving is dealt with in Where She Went, that too is something I grappled with. So I suppose the emotions are real, but the events are made up.\n\n+ In Where She Went, Adam borrows an iPod. Does he ever return it?\n\nDO NOT FRET! Adam returns the iPod AND he sends Nick a new one (fictional Nick, that is). In some earlier draft, you saw him go back to Manhattan and pack his bags and do this but that was all kind of draggy so I cut it. But OF COURSE he returns the iPod. COME ON. This is Adam we are talking about.\n\n+ Will there be a third Adam/Mia book?\n\nOkay. Just to make this crystal clear. And don’t read this if you haven’t read If I Stay and Where She Went because it’s a spoiler. But I keep getting asked if there is a third book for Mia and Adam. And if you have finished Where She Went, I have to ask you to ask yourself this:\n\nReally?\n\nDo you really want a third book?\n\nI am so flattered that you ask. Am so flattered that you want to spend more time with the characters. But think about the ways books work. They operate on conflict. A third book would either be Adam and Mia in boring middle age. YAWN. Or I’d have to introduce some new conflict. You know, like give someone cancer. Would you want me to do that to them? Have they not been through enough already???!!!!\n\nI love you all for asking. I love you all for wanting to be with them. You can always be with them in the pages of If I Stay and Where She Went or in your own imaginations. But the only reason I even wrote Where She Went was because Adam and Mia were banging in my head, telling me that they weren’t happy where I’d left them. They’re happy now. They’re quiet now. I’m happy for them now.\n\n+ Will there be a Where She Went movie?\n\nI have no information to share at this time about another movie. If I have any news in the future, I will be sure to share it.\n\n+ Will you read this thing I wrote?\n\nWhile I’m very honored that you asked me to read your writing, if I said yes to all such requests, I’d never have time to do my own writing. But your instinct for feedback is a great one. It’s incredibly helpful to have other people read and comment on your work. One thing you might do is form a critique group. Another option is to join an online forum where other users can read and respond to your work.\n\n+ Can I interview you for my school paper/blog/thing?\n\nI’m so flattered you asked!! Unfortunately, I’m taking a break from interviews between books.\n\n+ Can you help me with my homework assignment/unpublished manuscript?\n\nI wish I could but I can barely keep up with my own work, never mind my laundry.\n\nBut here is what I can do: I can offer you this selection of my blog posts on writing and publishing.\n\nWriting a school paper on If I Stay and need some tips? Click here.\n\nIf you want to try your hand at writing a novel, I point you toward NaNoWriMo’s awesome curriculum guides.\n\nIf you want to take an online class to workshop your book with a professional, I highly recommend Mediabistro. They have all kinds of publishing classes, offered in several cities, as well as online.\n\nOkay, now who wants to help fold laundry?\n\n+ How do I find an agent/get published?\n\nThat can be a long and complicated process. My overall piece of advice is to create the most amazing thing you can write first. Then worry about finding an agent/publisher. Horse first, then cart. If you have already finished your manuscript and want information on what to do next, here is a selection of resources about publishing.\n\n+ If you send me a book, I'll review it on my blog.\n\nHooray for you and your blog! I am so grateful to book bloggers fighting the good fight! I’m not in charge of my books, however. You can reach out to Penguin and request a review copy."
