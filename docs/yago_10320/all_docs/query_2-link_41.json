        "text": "An old-time Ferris wheel, fully lit, turns against a sinister sky. The ride is part of a traveling carnival, seemingly set up in the middle of nowhere, and a storm is coming in the form of Stan Carlisle.\n\nIs he man or beast?\n\nCome closer and find out. As the sideshow barker shouts, his voice competing with rollicking carousel music, “Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!”\n\nThis is “Nightmare Alley,” a lavish noir thriller from Guillermo del Toro that arrives exclusively in theaters on Dec. 17. Bradley Cooper plays the insatiable Stan, by turns damaged drifter, aw-shucks country boy, conniving killer, society charlatan, fast-disintegrating alcoholic and primal scream. The carnival cast includes Willem Dafoe as Clem, that rasping sideshow proprietor; Rooney Mara as sweet-hearted runaway Molly, who performs as the high-voltage Electrified Girl; and Toni Collette as the weary Madam Zeena, a phony fortune teller. The action eventually moves to the upper echelons of a city, where Cate Blanchett awaits in Art Deco splendor as the bone-chilling psychologist Dr. Lilith Ritter.\n\nEveryone is conning someone, some more treacherously than others. “The carnies know they’re carnies,” del Toro told me. “They don’t try to be anything else. It’s the people in the city who pretend they are judges and philanthropists and industrialists. True rot comes when you con yourself.”\n\nFor Searchlight Pictures, which has taken the top prize at four of the last eight Oscar ceremonies, including in 2018 for “The Shape of Water,” del Toro’s previous film, “Nightmare Alley” represents a breathtaking risk. It is an ultra-dark period movie that cost roughly $60 million to make, the most the studio has ever spent on a single film in its nearly 30-year history.\n\nBut for me, “Nightmare Alley” is something much different. Del Toro’s carnival is a vivid reminder, good and bad, of my childhood.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
