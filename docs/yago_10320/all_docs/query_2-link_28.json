He appeared to various inhabitants of the town of Everlock and enticed them by granting their wishes or dreams. However, his apparent \"generosity\" always resulted in the manipulation or twisting of what they desired and ended in them transforming into the guardians of his artifacts. While he was beginning to perform the curse that would destroy Everlock, he, along with all of Everlock, was frozen in time by the Society Against Evil members Jael, Ryu, and Calliope.\n\nThe Carnival Master was later freed by Mortimer and raised an army of the undead to attack Joey Graceffa and his friends. He was killed after Jael and Ryu were resurrected. His soul was then brought to the Museum of the Dead by The Collector and unleashed on Joey once more.
