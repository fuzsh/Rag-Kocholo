        "text": "Q: Tell us about a project you worked on you are especially proud of and why. What was your role?\n\nA: This may sound odd, but I have to say I am most proud of my own project that I’ve been developing for about 3 years because it is my accumulated voice.\n\nQ: What are you working on at the moment?\n\nA: A book, a script, and finishing my own project.\n\nQ: Is there anyone on SoundBetter you know and would recommend to your clients?\n\nA: I would have to look around the site a little bit more, but I am totally not opposed to sending a client to another player that I feel would make them happy.\n\nQ: Analog or digital and why?\n\nA: Both. Analog is warmer/natural sounding, and digital has brighter clarity and together they just work better.\n\nQ: What's your 'promise' to your clients?\n\nA: I am confident that you will completely enjoy the contribution you allow me to make to your song. I will make sure you are happy.\n\nQ: What do you like most about your job?\n\nA: I get to help people with their song, help them realize the best possible version of that song. Help them to grow from the experience as much as I will.\n\nQ: What questions do customers most commonly ask you? What's your answer?\n\nA: How long have you been playing keyboards? My answer is; longer than you. Lol!\n\nQ: What's the biggest misconception about what you do?\n\nA: Most people either have a misconception of the role of the keyboards on their track, and many don’t have a role defined.\n\nQ: What questions do you ask prospective clients?\n\nA: Tell me what you feel the role for the keyboard or hammond organ is for your song. Then give me song examples, also artists styles help greatly.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?\n\nA: First I would respectfully ask that you listen to the music I’ve made over the years and get a feel for my musical voice to be sure that you feel we are a great match. If we are, you will most definitely not be disappointed.\n\nQ: If you were on a desert island and could take just 5 pieces of gear, what would they be?\n\nA: A Hammond B3, a 122 Leslie, a Kronos, an acoustic piano, and an expresso machine.\n\nQ: What was your career path? How long have you been doing this?\n\nA: My career path has been extremely diverse and would fill up a big book. Pentecostal church revivals, black gospel, R&B, Rock, and years of blue eyed soul. I’ve been playing keyboards professionally since I was 16, that’s a little over 40 years. I really love what I do.\n\nQ: How would you describe your style?\n\nA: Soulful, smooth and emotional.\n\nQ: Which artist would you like to work with and why?\n\nA: Rascal Flats & Babyface all on the same song.\n\nQ: Can you share one music production tip?\n\nA: Bring an empty palette and let the client track lay down the first color, and then following that vibe, color, and emotion.\n\nQ: What type of music do you usually work on?\n\nA: Indy Pop, Indy rock, soul Pop, R&B, gospel, and some hip hop.\n\nQ: What's your strongest skill?\n\nA: The Hammond B3 and my ear, my feel and my desire to floor the client with the best possible emotion for their song.\n\nQ: What do you bring to a song?\n\nA: Chord and color support to create the soul of the song. That’s the beauty of the Hammond organ.\n\nQ: What's your typical work process?\n\nA: I first listen to the clients track maybe 3 or 4 times, then I record a first impression take and let myself stay loose with it and let it lead me. I save that take, and then begin listening intently (many times in a relaxed mind set) to all aspects of the current chord colors/voices, the vibe, and the emotion in the singers voice. I let the song speak to me. Then I began a methodical start by sections of the song. If I lose my way, I play back my first initial impression track of the entire song for inspiration.\n\nQ: Tell us about your studio setup.\n\nA: My studio is more like a custom cutting room set up with analog mics and preamps for recording the B3 directly to DC utilizing Logic Pro X software on Mac with Yamaha HS8i studio Monitors.\n\nQ: What other musicians or music production professionals inspire you?\n\nA: Over the years I have been inspired by many many artists, session players and producers. It’s very difficult to name them all, but Steely Dan, Billy Preston, Stevie Wonder, Tower of Power, Joe Sample, AWB, EWF, come to mind."
