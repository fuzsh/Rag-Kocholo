He never leaves the fort. Gallant confronts him with the message that all the legionnaires are from different bavkgrounds, and now live happily together, \"the war's been over for ten years.\"\n\nSchmidt joins Sgt Duvalon a trip into town, the cafe, which Schmidt used to visit during ze war. He knows Jeannine, now the proprietor, but he is soon picked on by her unpleasant brother Johnny who had been wounded in the hostilities. \"I'll not have a German as a brother-in-law.\" Schmidt leaves.\n\nBut the couple are soon kissing, \"I will come again tomorrow.\" But he is found by a dead body, and is accused of killing Marcel, Johnny's father, and is put in the legion jail. Cuffy provides a useful lead, for a friend had discovered a key ring by the corpse. It turns out to belong to Marcel. It opens the door of the cafe. The bartender Makko is guilty. He has fled, taking Jeannine with him, maybe by force.\n\nGallant gives chase in his jeep, deep into the desert, and catches up with the pair.

As Long as There are Arabs - Bennet (Arthur Hanson) is accused of killing The Wise Man by angry Arabs led by Wise Man's less wise son. Gallant steps in to save the wretch who swears his innocence, though \"the evidence against you is very strong.\" Bennet shows his thanks by bashing Gallant on the head.

He's come to sort out a security leak, but unable to spot any traitor, he takes the drastic step of leading his unarmed men into the desert to flush out the villain. He's easily caught, the ambush thwarted and naturally Gallant is a hero\n\n2.3 The Long Night - \"I don't like it,\" remarks The Colonel, when Mrs Drexel, Cuffy's aunt, demands to take Cuffy home with her. \"I won't go,\" cries the lad in an unusually emotional tale, complete with violin music.

The ending is rather a poignant one\n\n2.21 Dr Legionnaire - Two scouts lead Gallant's expedition into a trap, though natives only want a doctor to treat a sheik who seems terminally ill. Cure him, or be killed, the sheik's brother pronounces. \"We'll have to operate immediately.\" Gallant prevents the wicked brother from trying to ensure the operation fails\n\nEuro Crime Series\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
