He then later changed his story and said that she had fallen overboard.\n\nKaren was only 5’3 so it was almost impossible for her to fall over the high railing.\n\nShe was 26 years old and had only been married to Scott for 9 days before the accident took place.\n\nKarens body was found and it was determined that she was unconscious, but not dead when she hit the water.\n\nEpisode Guide – SHELLY\n\nWhat Happened? – Murder of Yang Wenjuan\n\nYang Wenjuan was cruising with her husband Wang Weilie onboard the MV Macau Success in 2010.
