        "text": "The family of a musician who was fatally stabbed at the Notting Hill Carnival say they will not give up the fight until his killer is found.\n\nFather-to-be Takayo Nembhard, 21, from Bristol, was attacked in Ladbroke Grove, at about 20:00 BST on 29 August 2022.\n\nFive people have been arrested since his death, but no one has been charged.\n\n\"We're angry, we're frustrated, we're heartbroken. We need an end to this,\" said his mum Sandra.\n\nCrimestoppers are offering a Â£20,000 reward to help convict Mr Nembhard's killers.\n\nNotting Hill Carnival returns this weekend, with over two million people expected to attend.\n\nMet Police officers will be at the event to make fresh witness appeals.\n\nMr Nembhard, who performed under the name TKorStretch, had been at last year's carnival with his sister and friends.\n\nHe was in a large crowd underneath the Westway flyover when he was fatally wounded.\n\nMrs Nembhard and husband Vincent hope the incentive of the reward will encourage witnesses to come forward.\n\n\"I believe we will get justice. It's only a matter of when. I know it's been a while, but I still have faith,\" said Mr Nembhard.\n\n\"I hope somebody comes forward with any evidence they've got and [help] put these people away. Because we can't have these people walking around the streets.\"\n\nTakayo's girlfriend, Oshian Edwards, gave birth to his baby nine weeks after he died.\n\n\"I don't want Takayo's child growing up knowing that person is still out there,\" said Mrs Nembhard.\n\n\"Just come forward and say what you know. Just put an end to this knife crime. If you keep protecting these people, they're just going to keep doing it.\"\n\nPolice believe there were many witnesses since several hundred people were in the area when the fatal attack took place.\n\nDetectives want to hear from anyone who may have taken photos or filmed relevant footage at the time.\n\nThe five suspects in the case have been bailed as police investigations continue.\n\nMr Nembhard's parents would like to see more measures to protect people from knife crime at the carnival.\n\n\"My suggestion is to have stab kits. Either police need to carry them or they need to be dotted around the area, in case something like this happens again,\" said Mrs Nembhard.\n\n\"If we can't stop it, at least try and save someone's life."
