        "text": "keylan said:\n\nI too am on the fence about this movie. I must say that I really love playing the game, and I hope they do a good job of it. I am still playing the Two Thrones. I only have the original XBOX, no money for buying a new gaming system.\n\nKeylan I see absolutely no reason to harbor fear regarding Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.\n\nJerry Bruckheimer has proven over and over again that he can deliver a well told and high quality story that appeals to all ages.\n\nNational Treasure and Pirates of Caribbean along with Bruckheimer's lesser known work The Count of Monte Cristo are perfect examples of his God-given talent. When Jerry Bruckheimer and Walt Disney unite to create a production you can rest assured that it will be more than marvelous.\n\nAs far as I'm corcerned I believe that Disney's/ Bruckheimer's Prince of Persia: Sands of Time will be just as (if not more) successful as the first Pirates of the Carribean film was and I would not be surprised if two more Prince of Persia films will follow. Why else would Disney launch Prince of Persia comics and a LEGO Prince of Persia toyline and rumored video game (Travelers Tales) if they didn't know it'd be a success?\n\nLets not go through the same valley of doubt that we journed through in the days before the release of JJ. Abrams Star Trek XI.\n\nThe trailer for Prince of Persia is more than exciting and I simply marvel at the sequence where Dantas is scaling the city wall at night and the arrow is shot at him, it reminds me of the night siege in Narnia rince Caspian when the Pevensies attack Miraz's castle.\n\n[There be spoilers below. Ye have been warned.]\n\nBaron von Bruckheimer brought his roadshow to San Francisco today, and graced Wonder Con attendees with the first glimpses of the finished film! To all the skeptics, allow me to say that I was impressed, damn impressed. It has that great swashbuckling feel combined with top notch effects (both practical and otherwise), and takes it self seriously. The post-modern winking and nodding at the camera is non-existent.\n\nOne especially nice bit of knowledge: 75% of what you see on the screen physically exists; either the production crew built it, or the location scouts secured it for filming. Production artists were unleashed across India to illustrate architectural details, and then brought back to implement in the set design!\n\nBut back to movie. It turns out our prince isn't really a prince -- at first. Impressed by his bravery, the local ruler adopts the intrepid youth and raises him as his own flesh and blood. Fast forward many years later and The Prince has grown into Jake Gyllenhaal. His father and brothers are marching on Altimont at the head of their army, and being the youngest, The Prince has been left in the rear with the gear.\n\nHe, of course, isn't having any of it.\n\nUnder the cover of darkness, The Prince, the crafty Sheik Amar, and a handful of Chosen Men sneak up on the rear of the city attempting to sneak in through the back way. A pair of crossbowmen fire enormous bolts into the city walls that The Prince uses to scale the walls and infiltrate the city. At the top of the wall, The Prince waits as a guard passes, and just as he does, grabs his head and smacks it against the battlements rendering him unconscious.\n\nThe rest of The Prince's Posse scale the wall, and onto the parapet. An archer takes out one guard, then another, and just before the last guard can be overcome, he manages to raise the alarm! Guards come rushing out; swords flash; and mayhem ensues. But The Prince must get the gate open, and sets off to raise it amid the chaos.\n\nThe gate, of course, is jammed. The Prince must get it open before the rest of the enemy army comes to destroy them. Leaping, bounding, and climbing to the top of the tower, The Prince wraps the guide rope throughout the structure, looking for leverage. Once the jam is free, the gate begins to rise. However, the scaffolding around the tower is compromised. It begins to fall apart, unhinging a large cauldron of oil! Just as the enemy reaches his position, The Prince leaps downward into the fray and throws a burning torch into the oil.\n\nEnemy soldiers burst into flame, and the scene concludes with one-on-one combat between The Prince & a guy who looks similar to the Indian guy in Lost. During their fight, the dagger falls into The Prince's possession.\n\nMore to come...\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nI played a demo of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in the distant past, and the graphics were stunning, just like these posters.\n\nI don't know a lot about the PoP game series, but there have been some good conversions to film based on games - like Silent Hill. As long as the game had strong characters and themes that can be extracted, the conversion should work. I think this genre fails due to lazy writing, as happened with the Tomb Raider movies.\n\nWell actually I think that Prince of Persia will perform far better than Tomb Raider could have ever hoped to have done; mainly because this is Disney for one thing and also because of the fact that it has the prestige of Bruckheimer and friends who've made a name for themselves with and acclaim of world wide success of Pirates of the Caribbean and National Treasure proving that you can have a (PG-13) film franchise that appeals to the entire family without showing excessive blood, gore, sexually offensive content and strong language and yet manage to be a large cash cow at the box office. Plus, Disney knows that all the gentlemen and teenage boys who sit at home Prince of Persian-ing on their XBOX 360's and PSP's will no doubt turn out in great numbers simply because this is an adaption of one the most well known video game franchises.\n\nNevertheless this film will have it's critics and dis-satisfied customers but I trust that they will settle down after the film's release the same way us Trekkies did after we saw J.J. Abrams had not ruined our beloved Star Trek. Well ah, he did mess up Uhura and Spock by making them slight love birds. Come on, Spock is a Vulcan and Vulcan's don't stumple over females Mr. Abrams! Alas, that's a whole differ ball game.\n\nStill I don't think Dastan has much to fear when he sandstorms the theaters this summer. After all Alice in Wonderland had a spectacular performance at the box office and still performed well even after DreamWorks sent Dragon clovens in with \"How To Train Your Dragon\". Sometimes almost everything Disney touches turns to gold with the exception of Hannah Montana and that also is a whole different ball game.\n\nBTW Montana have you seen the Prince of Persia Sands of Time Prequel comic? Mind you the current cover for the comic is not so easy on the eyes.\n\nThis is the story from Dastan's perspective:\n\nNow if only LEGO and Traveller's Tales would confirm a LEGO Prince of Persia Video Game so that I can go to Game Stop and reserve it...\n\nRedeemedChild said:\n\nWhat more did you expect Nurachi?\n\nI'm not all that concerned with actually casting East Indians or people of Arab descent even though it would be nice, because I know the movie companies are not going to actually go out on a limb to do so; especially Disney and Universal Studios.\n\nI certainly hope Prince of Persia won't reignite those foolish racial arguments that the theme Arabian Night's started when Disney released Aladdin.\n\nLet us not get all sand picky about the actors, I mean let's enjoy the film for what it is.\n\nThese films are usually vehicles for spectacle, and for that only the exotic location and period is required. It's the alien made palatable for a mass western audience.\n\nIf the connection were made too strongly that Perisa is now Iran, would American audiences be cheering on a darker skinned lead actor, or nervously checking for suspicious packages under their seats?\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nThese films are usually vehicles for spectacle, and for that only the exotic location and period is required. It's the alien made palatable for a mass western audience.\n\nIf the connection were made too strongly that Perisa is now Iran, would American audiences be cheering on a darker skinned lead actor, or nervously checking for suspicious packages under their seats?\n\nAnd that is exactly what sets a fiery anger within me. The West, namely us here in what USED to be the good ole USA and England look at everyone else as if they were some strange alien's from Mars. We act as if we are righteousness and everyone else was a dark Sith Lord or some unintelligent stragler out of the woods.\n\nIs it any wonder Karzi is upset and refuses to cooperate with our leaders? Is it strange that Afghanistan and Iraq's citizens want us out and off of their turf?\n\nHow would we feel if some military force were to land over here and occupy our land (which we stole from the Indians) for many, many years? Put yourself in the shoes of these people and then stop to think. Are we being brain-washed by our media? Are we really such a noble people as we pretend or deceive ourselves into thinking we are?\n\nWe've murdured helpless Indians (the real Americans), slain civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and persucuted Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, kill babies everyday in the name of abortion, kill animals for food when we could be vegans, ignore the pain and suffering in the poor regions of Africa and mocked the religious community in the name of Charles Darwin and yet we think that we are right and everyone else is wrong? We foolishly tell other nations what to do and how to live and our media misrepresents Muslims and makes it out like Islamic people are all to be feared and abhorred.\n\nPeople what is wrong with this picture? I mean, seriously WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?\n\nEverything is wrong! When we well learn?\n\nWash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; Learn to do good; Seek justice, Reprove the ruthless, Defend the orphan, Plead for the widow.\n\nIsaiah 1:16-17 KJV, NASB\n\nSeriously James Cameron's Avatar is a very good thought provoking movie."
