        "text": "This article is about Hourglass in The Sands of Time. You may be looking for Sandglass of Time in the Sands of Time Film.\n\nThe Hourglass of Time (commonly known as the Hourglass) is an Artifact of Time, present in the Sands of Time Trilogy series. It contains the Sands of Time.\n\nOfficial Description[]\n\n\"Long ago, in the age of myths, the Sands of Time were sealed away within an impregnable Hourglass. When the Prince commits the unimaginable sin of unlocking the Hourglass, releasing the Sands, the reason for this precaution becomes evident.\"\n\nâ€”Instructional Manual[2]\n\nAbilities[]\n\nThe Hourglass acts as a containment device for the Sands. The Hourglass can be used in conjunction with the Dagger of Time, which aids in the release and recapture of the Sands.[3] In appearance, it is similar to that of a standard hourglass, only of a more grand design.\n\nHistory[]\n\nCreation[]\n\nThe creation of the Hourglass of Time is never specified within the Sands of Time Trilogy. Though its origin is the Island of Time[1], the assumption is that it, along with the Dagger, Staff and Medallion of Time, was created by Kaileena prior to her death. This is never confirmed in The Sands of Time, Warrior Within or The Two Thrones.\n\nRelocation to India[]\n\nAt some unspecified point in time the Maharajah of India traveled to the Island of Time with an entourage of men. On the island he found the Hourglass and the three artifacts that accompanied it. Returning to India he placed the Hourglass and Dagger of Time inside his treasure vault. The Medallion was given to his daughter; the Staff fell into the possession of his Vizier.\n\nThe Sands of Time[]\n\nFollowing the sacking of the Maharajah's palace and the acquisition of the artifacts of time by the Persian army under King Shahraman and his son, the Maharajah's Vizier tricked the Prince into releasing the Sands of Time with the Dagger. The Vizier used the Sand Creatures haunting the palace of Azad to transport the Hourglass transported to the Sultan's treasure vault at the top of the Tower of Dawn.[3]\n\nEventually, the Prince and Farah arrived at the Tower of Dawn. When Farah instructed the Prince how to insert the Dagger inside the dome of the hourglass, the Prince hesitated, questioning her motives. His delay allowed the Vizier to drive them out of the Tower, and the first attempt at performing \"Grand Rewind\" was a failure. Farah would later attempt to complete the task herself, before sacrificing herself to save the Prince from the Blue Sand Generals.[3]\n\nThe Prince, grief-stricken at the loss of his family and Farah. He rejected the Vizier's offer of immortality and struck the Hourglass with the Dagger, recapturing the Sands and triggering the Grand Rewind. The events undone, the Hourglass remained locked away in the treasure vaults undisturbed.[3]\n\nWarrior Within[]\n\nThe Hourglass was present when the Prince traveled to the Island of Time. In the past, the hourglass was still active, as Kaileena had yet to be killed.[4] The hourglass was set to mark how much time before the empress created the sands of time.\n\nThe Hourglass was a constant reminder of the Empress' eventual fate to die at the hands of the Dahaka. After the Prince destroyed the Dahaka, the empty hourglass remained on the Island of Time.[4]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Hourglass appeared in Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones, during the Prince's fight with the Dark Prince inside of his mind.[1]\n\nGallery[]\n\nThe Sands of Time[]\n\nPromotional[]\n\nScreenshots[]\n\nSee Also[]\n\nDagger of Time\n\nSands of Time\n\nMedallion of Time"
