        "text": "Ubisoft's troubled development of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake isn't a secret.\n\nIt was first announced over three years ago, and ever since the game has been pushed back time and time again. In May 2022, it was announced that the game would be moving from Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai to Montreal, with the game's latest update from Ubisoft stating that it had passed an 'important milestone'. Official details on what the 'important milestone' entails are unclear, but Insider Gaming has learned several details on what to expect from the game.\n\nFirst, forget everything you've seen or heard from the reveal trailer, as the remake has beenâ€¦ remade from scratch. Ubisoft's official announcement on the change of developers said that Montreal would be \"building upon\" the work already done by Ubisoft Mumbai and Pune, but from what we've been able to gather; it's been completely redone. Footage sent to Insider Gaming under the condition that it does not go public shows the game is somewhat still in an early stage (missing textures, assets, etc.) and is, unfortunately, likely a ways off from release.\n\nPrince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake's overhaul also includes a more \"realistic approach\", said one source. Everything has been buiilt from the ground up, which includes a complete graphical overhaul, new animations and mechanics for combat and parkour, and much more. Starting from scratch has meant that the game has been rewritten, recaptured in mocap, and more.\n\nOne of the most noticeable changes for long-time Prince of Persia fans is that Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind The Prince in the original, will no longer be reprising his role, despite him doing so in the original reveal trailer and during the remake's original development. It's not entirely clear why Lowenthal is no longer on the project.\n\nSeveral sources have suggested that the company could give a more prominent update on the project soon, but what that looks like and when it will be is unclear.\n\nEXCLUSIVE - Forget Everything You Know About Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake\n\nForget everything you know about Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, because everything has been redone from the ground up.\n\nAt least we have Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and its upcoming Season Pass, I guess. Given the how much this project has been through, I'm sort of glad they're giving this game a complete overhaul and the time it needs cause the first reactions to that first trailer wasn't good at all and its been exchanged from one studio to another over the last couple of years. It sucks that this game is very clearly a ways out but at least they're figuring out the right approach and at least it seems like Ubisoft is trying to get back to where they were quality and expectation wise. Lets hope this plays out for the better.\n\nI have to wonder what's up with Ubisofts management. They just seem to not really care about the performance of some of these studios. Had the Mumbai studio struggle with this remake and the Skull and Bones studio having endless trouble with that game. It honestly seems they don't really care how the studios that aren't in France or Canada perform.\n\nI know in the case of S&B there was some tax incentive but is it the same with the studios that worked on this originally? It just doesn't really make sense to me. Even with tax incentives the investments are meaningless if they're not managed well.\n\nA change for more \"realistic\" graphics wouldn't be a bad thing. I like how the original looks but it always felt more like a product of the time rather than the artstyle they fully wanted (Especially looking at Warrior Within and Two Thrones).\n\nWith that said, no amount of better graphics will save it if they botch the gameplay. PoP:SoT might not be deeply complex but it can be a lot of fun and definitely doesn't need to be simplified to current parkour standards or the autoness of PoP 2008\n\nI really wouldn't be surprised if RE4make (and some other recent remakes) might be playing a part in how the game is progressing. Just in the sense that PoP:SoT has a lot of those trappings of \"Game that perfectly encapsulates being on an adventure\"."
