        "text": "It's rather hard to refer to this review as a snap judgment, as I've played through Ubisoft Montreal's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as many as ten times now. I originally had it on the Nintendo GameCube, and it was literally my favorite game of that generation. Even though the sequels that followed were not nearly as charming or compelling, that whole trilogy is special to me because it made me start taking video-game storytelling seriously. Admittedly, The Sands of Time certainly isn't the tour de force that The Last of Us is, but I consider this game to be an important early step in game narrative. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the whole trilogy received a high-res makeover, which made this entry palatable to play on my HDTV; sadly, the in-game cinematics were not remastered and are still SD, an unsightly sore thumb in an otherwise crisp-textured if still low-polygonal port. The amusing thing about this is that I clearly remember thinking that those very cinematics were so much better looking than the actual game back in 2003; some eleven years later, the reverse is now true.\n\nWhat has stood up well is how beautiful scored the game was; the music somehow builds from being playful to being serious and desperate by the end of the game, and its progression feels completely natural. This is truly one of the biggest achievements I've seen in this regard. Also impressive is the general voice work, especially Yuri Lowenthal's portrayal of the Prince; while not always perfectly delivered, he and Joanna Wasick, the voice of Farah, had a wonderful and playful chemistry in the game. There's cheesiness to be sure, but given the game's storybook-style tale, their interplay really works.\n\nThe gameplay isn't quite the lofty standard it once was, given its age, especially with regard to the combat mechanics. Nevertheless, I still remember The Sands of Time as an incredible achievement in the early part of last decade, even if gaming, voice acting, and graphics have gotten considerably more refined since then. I very much enjoyed pursuing the Platinum Trophy in this game, too, and it's worth every penny of the $14.99 it retails for on the PSN. A\n\nP.S. Every time I see an Assassin's Creed game from Ubisoft Montreal, I get a little angry because I feel like that series stole PoP's birthright this last generation. Even though we did get two entries in the franchise since The Sands Trilogy, it still feels like it has languished quite a bit. Here's hoping for a bright return in this new generation of hardware; I would love to see an open-world entry, a la the Assassin's games."
