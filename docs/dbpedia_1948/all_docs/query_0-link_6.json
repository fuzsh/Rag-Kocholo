        "text": "What is Prince of Persia\n\nPrince of Persia is a series of action adventure games starring the Prince of the country of Persia now known as Iran in real life. The series began with the first game that was created by Jordan Mechner in 1989 on the Apple II and was renowned for it's groundbreaking use of rotoscoped sprites to simulate more fluid movement with it's mix of platforming and swordplay. The sequel Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame stayed true to the first games formula and was also positively received. These two games were ported on a wide variety of consoles including the NES, Master System, MS-DOS, SNES and many others. The series however went into hiatus after the next game Prince of Persia 3D received mixed reception and significantly worse sales.\n\nHowever this hiatus set in stage the boom the series was about to receive after the rights went to Ubisoft and the Montreal team created the critically acclaimed reboot Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time which released in 2003. This game became highly influential with it's tight platforming and traversal mechanics, the ability to turn back time to undo mistakes and it's free flow combat which inspired combat in the following generation of games such as the Batman: Arkham series. The game went on to sell 14 million in it's lifetime and naturally this led Ubisoft to pursue a sequel. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within was released in 2004 and while it's drastic change in tone to something more edgy and violent was divisive among critics and fans, the improvement to the combat and the non linear level design was highly praised. The final game in the core Sands of Time trilogy, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones was released in 2005 and innovated the series with it's implementation of the Prince's darker alter-ego ; The Dark Prince who uses a chain like weapon for combat and traversal.\n\nUbisoft was working on a spinoff to the series in 2007 known as Prince of Persia: Assassins centred around an assassin who is tasked with protecting the prince. Eventually the concept was moved to become a little IP known as Assassin's Creed which is Ubisoft's biggest franchise to date.\n\nIn 2008 the series received yet another reboot simply named \"Prince of Persia\". This game utilised the Prince's new companion Elika to explore it's trademark blend of platforming and combat in brand new ways. While the art direction and use of Elika in gameplay was highly praised the lesser difficulty due to the inability to die was divisive. The popularity of the series led to a film adaptation being greenlit and primed to release in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Ubisoft was also planning to release a new mainline game alongside the film which took place in between Warrior Within and the Two Thrones with the subtitle the Forgotten Sands. The film received mixed reviews from critics and Forgotten Sands underperformed thus the series entered another hiatus.\n\nAfter only receiving a mobile spin off based on the classic 8-bit Prince of Persia games in 2018 Ubisoft has been attempting to revive the series with a Prince of Persia theme For Honor event, an escape VR room and a remake to the most successful game in the series, Sands of Time slated to be released in January 2021. Overall the franchise has sold over 20 million copies combined\n\nWho is the Prince\n\nThe Prince is the protagonist of the Prince of Persia franchise created by Jordan Mechner and currently owned by Ubisoft. There are many iterations of the Prince however the one that will be used in Smash will most likely be the iteration from the Sands of Time trilogy and it's related games. He's the son to the Persian king Sharaman and is a highly skilled and acrobatic warrior. After discovering the dagger of time and unleashing the sands of time he sets in place the events for his series of games to commence.\n\nWhat will he bring to Smash (Full Moveset coming soon)\n\nWith his ability to duel wield weapons, the dagger of time giving him time based abilities and the implementation of the Dark Prince, the Prince is more than capable to give a fun moveset that truly represents his games.\n\nPrince of Persia Music:"
