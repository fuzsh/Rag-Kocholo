        "text": "This article is about the civilization in Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. For the civilization in Age of Empires, see Persians (Age of Empires).\n\nCivilization Technology tree Strategy\n\n“ Emerging from inner Persia, the House of Sasan toppled feeble Parthia, establishing a dynasty capable of challenging their Roman neighbors to the west. Even after the Muslim conquest, the Sasanian legacy lived on in the structure of the medieval Persian states. Stun your enemies with a stampede of mahouted War Elephants and hails of arrows thick enough to blot out the sun while your Savaran ride them down, or field an army of gunpowder units worthy of the great Safavid Empire. Nothing is beyond your grasp! ” —Description[1]\n\nThe Persians are a Middle Eastern civilization in Age of Empires II based on various Persian states such as the Safavid dynasty, Sasanian Empire, various Sogdian city-states, and the Samanid Empire. They focus on cavalry.\n\nThe Persians received a rework with the release of The Mountain Royals, making them the second civilization to receive one (the first being the Indians). Unlike the Indian rework, the Persian one was not a civilization split, but rather a rework to some of their core gameplay mechanics.\n\nCharacteristics[]\n\nUnique units[]\n\nWar Elephant: Slow but extremely powerful cavalry unit.\n\nSavar: Unique upgrade of the Cavalier, replacing the Paladin.\n\nUnique building[]\n\nCaravanserai: Building which heals and speeds up nearby allied Trade Carts.\n\nUnique technologies[]\n\nKamandaran: Archer-line cost changed from 25 wood, 45 gold to 60 wood.\n\nCitadels: Castles +4 attack, +3 against rams, +3 against infantry, and receive -25% bonus damage.\n\nCivilization bonuses[]\n\nStart the game with +50 food, +50 wood.\n\nTown Centers and Docks have double hit points and work 5%/10%/15%/20% faster in the Dark/Feudal/Castle/Imperial Age.\n\nParthian Tactics available in the Castle Age.\n\nTeam bonus[]\n\nKnight line has +2 attack against archers.\n\nOverview[]\n\nThe Persians are a cavalry civilization. They have access to fully upgraded Hussars and Heavy Camel Riders and, despite not having access to Paladins, they can upgrade their Cavaliers to Savars, which, in comparison with Paladins, have more armor and are cheaper to upgrade. Their Knight line is great with +2 anti-archer damage, which is very helpful given the prevalence of the Crossbowman line during the Castle Age. Their unique unit, the War Elephant, is a situational but incredibly strong unit with great attack and durability.\n\nTheir Halberdiers are fully upgradeable. Thanks to Kamandaran, their Archer line costs no gold: this makes Persian Crossbowmen cheap disposable units that pair well with cavalry, as the Crossbowmen can counter Camel Riders and Halberdiers. In addition to trash Crossbowmen, they also have perfectly serviceable Hand Cannoneers. They also have access to Siege Rams and Bombard Cannon at the Siege Workshop, but they lack Siege Engineers, which overall averages out.\n\nTheir economy is simply excellent; they get all economic upgrades, as well as a head start with +50 food, +50 wood given at the start of the game. All of this is further bolstered by their faster working Town Centers and Docks, which also gets them Villager and Fishing Ship leads over their opponents, furthermore, translating into economic, and military production advantages. The bonus on their Docks also gives them a solid early-game navy. In the Imperial Age, they can build the Caravanserai, an economic building which heals and speeds up nearby allied Trade Carts.\n\nHowever, the Persians have some weaknesses. Their heavy infantry, viz. the Militia line, is abysmal in the late game on account of lacking the Two-Handed Swordsman upgrade. Their Archer line is poor in combat without Bracer or Arbalester. The lack of Bracer also hurts their Skirmishers, Cavalry Archers, Castles, and Galleons. The latter is also hurt by a lack of Shipwright, giving them a poor late-game navy.\n\nPersian defenses are a rather mixed bag. While they do get access to Architecture, Heated Shot, Hoardings and the unique technology Citadels, which makes their Castles very strong, they lack Keeps, Arrowslits, Bombard Towers, and even Fortified Walls.\n\nThe Persian Monks are among the weakest of all civilizations, without Redemption, Sanctity, or Illumination. The lack of Heresy is unfortunate, as the Persians rely on expensive heavy cavalry units that are prime targets for conversion: the Savar and the War Elephant. Because of this, it is important to mix in Hussars along with the heavy cavalry.\n\nOverall, the Persians have a wide selection of strong cavalry units and supported by economic advantages.\n\nChangelog[]\n\nThe Conquerors[]\n\nMahouts introduced.\n\nThe Forgotten[]\n\nBoiling Oil introduced.\n\nThe African Kingdoms[]\n\nArrowslits added.

It had been reassembled following the conquest by Alexander in the fourth century BC and the subsequent breakup of his empire in later centuries. The Persians had been fighting the Romans since the third century AD. ”\n\n“ The Persian Empire stretched from Mesopotamia to India and from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, encompassing the modern nations of Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. They fought the Romans, and later the Byzantines, for control of modern Syria, Turkey, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and Arabia. The capital of the Persian Empire was Ctesiphon, called Baghdad today.\n\nDuring the third and fourth centuries, the Romans made several attempts to subdue the Persians. In 364 a peace treaty was signed between the two that allowed the Persians to consolidate their power to the east and north. Beginning with the sixth century, the Persians began attacking the Byzantine Empire in Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and modern Turkey. The war between the two powers went back and forth. In 626 the Persians besieged Byzantium itself without success, and the Byzantines were able to invade Persia the following year. Peace was made between the two exhausted empires in 628.\n\nThe Persians were unprepared for the fury of the Islamic Arabs in the seventh century. The Sassanid dynasty of Persia ended in battle in 636. The Persians did not have a capital with defenses comparable to those of Constantinople. Muslim conquest of Persia was complete by 651. ” —[1]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Persian civilization's icon is based on a simurgh depiction, a fantastic creature from Persian mythology with the wings of a bird, the head of a dog, and the claws of a lion.\n\nThe user interface image in the Definitive Edition displays the Faravahar symbol, a major symbol of Zoroastrianism, an ancient Iranian religion beginning around 15th Century BC and declining after the Arab conquest of Persia in the 7th century AD. It is also used by their civilization equivalent in Return of Rome. The artwork before the Definitive Edition depicted a hexagonal tile with a Persian poem engraved in it, such as one found at the Sırçalı Medrese in Turkey.\n\nWith The Mountain Royals, the Persians and Saracens became the first civilizations to have both of their original unique technologies changed.\n\nBefore Citadels replaced Mahouts, the Persians were the only civilization whose Castle Age unique technology costs more than the Imperial Age one.\n\nThe Persians are the only civilization that cannot upgrade the swordsman line past the Long Swordsman.\n\nThe Persians and the Romans are the only two civilizations lacking the Two-Handed Swordsman, with the latter instead having the Legionary replacing the Champion.\n\nIn update 95810, the Persians received several major changes. The developers felt that despite the Persians' historical use of heavy cavalry being represented by the game, the European-styled Paladin felt unfaithful to the civilization, and thus the Paladin was replaced by the Savar. The rationale behind the earlier access to Parthian Tactics is the first attestation of the Parthian Shot at the Battle of Carrhae, and the continuation of Parthian legacy by the Sasanian Empire well into the early medieval period.[2]\n\nBefore Rise of the Rajas, the Persians were the only civilization with access to all Stable units and technologies. They are still the only civilization with fully upgraded Hussar, Paladin-equivalent (Savar), and Heavy Camel Rider.\n\nThe Byzantines also have said units, but they lack Bloodlines and Blast Furnace. Coincidentally, both civilizations have cavalry unique units.\n\nThe following heroes available in the Scenario Editor are themed on the Persians: Khosrau and Ismail (whose older form is Shah Ismail). In addition, the Scenario Editor unit, Sogdian Cataphract, are associated with the Persian civilization in the Bukhara scenario, due to the Persians being the closest civilization to represent the Sogdian city-states in-game.\n\nAfter the Byzantines were changed to the Mediterranean building set in the Definitive Edition, the Persians became the only Middle Eastern civilization with access to the Halberdier and one of only two non-European civilizations with access to the Paladin (the other being the Cumans), before the Paladin was replaced with the unique Savar upgrade.\n\nThe Persians share similar characteristics with their first game's counterpart where they have an expensive army consisting of heavy cavalry and War Elephants with lackluster heavy infantry and average everything else. More importantly, both versions of the Persians lack the last range technology for their Archery Range units and miss an important upgrade or unit in their Archery Range (in this case, the Persians in Age of Empires II lack the Arbalester while their first game's counterpart lack the Chariot Archer). Like their first game counterpart, the Persians are a solid choice in both water and land maps due to having bonuses for their cavalry and their navy (in this case, the Persian Docks have increased work rate).\n\nBefore The Mountain Royals, The Persians were tied with the Poles (this excludes the latter's unique building) for the civilization with the fewest civilization bonuses, with two.\n\nThe former extra 5% work rate for Town Centers and Docks in the Dark Age at release of the Definitive Edition boosted Persians to be one of the \"top tier\" civilizations on nomad and hybrid maps, to the point that most of the match-ups at higher levels of competitive games were Persian mirrors. Following update 36906, they lost the extra work rate in the Dark Age and are not considered the strongest in those settings, thus no longer being highly picked in non-hybrid and non-nomad maps. Instead, they became one of the least popular civilizations on land maps in most settings. In addition, their identity as a cavalry civilization became overshadowed due to the presence of other prominent cavalry civilizations and cavalry unique units. Because of all this, many changes were done to the Persians in The Mountain Royals to make them more popular and viable, viz a new unique unit, two new bonuses, a new building, a new Imperial Age unique technology, the comeback of the extra work rate in the Dark Age, and the improvement of the War Elephant.\n\nThe Persians are the only civilization with access to only two Castle Age Monastery technologies. They, the Britons, and the Vietnamese are the only civilizations with access to more Imperial Age Monastery technologies than Castle Age ones.\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
