        "text": "Squad needs an Iran team!\n\nSo Offworld (and dear modders), you have the Canadian army as an official part of your game. But you and everybody else knows for a fact that the closest thing to a war the Canadians are ever going to experience in their foreseeable future is a goose attack! It's time for squad to include countries that are more likely to be in a war more specifically west Asian countries as official playable teams. And to do that, what better choice than to pick Iran. The most militarist country in the region by far with the most active number of personnel in the region. Alright so let's say hypothetically that you want to do this. I'll tell you how you can go about it. Iran has 2 armies. One is the conventional army called \"Artesh\" with about 600,000 active members and 310,000 reserves. The other one is the \"IRGC\" with around 200,000 active personnel and it also mothers a paramilitary branch called \"Basij\" which according to some claims has about 23,000,000 registered members! Yeah you read that number right. But all of these guys are under the umbrella of \"The Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces\" so that's the title you want to use to avoid all confusions. For infantry uniforms and overall look use this picture as reference: https://images.app.goo.gl/r6wFQkYfSnvABnVX8. The most prominent gun used in the Iranian army (Artesh) is the Iranian made version of the G3. After that the good old AKM and also the special forces use the Iranian made version of AK 103. The sniper is the SVD and the MG is the PKM with optics. The MBT Iran has the most number of is the T-72S (480 T-72s in general). But the national tank is an Iranian made one called \"Zulfiqar\". It's a frankenstein type mash up of several other tanks including the T-72, M48 and M60 but it looks nothing like any of those as you can see in its Wikipedia page and looks definitely more like an Iranian Abrams! The one you want to use is the Zulfiqar 3 as it is the newest version. The APC Iran has the most is the BMP-2 (400). The logistics truck,,,,well this was the one that got me. Because in Iran we transport soldiers by busses and not by trucks. And there is no one specific type of truck that takes care of carrying around ammo and etc. But after a little bit of search I concluded that the truck you should use is the \"Mercedes-Benz LP 608\". For the light transport vehicle you have the Iranian made \"Fath Safir\" which usually comes with an 12-tube 107mm rocket launcher. For ATGMs you have the Iranian licensed made version of the Kornet called \"Dehlavieh\".\n\nPS: After researching and writing all this I realized that this is just the middle east coalition team with Iranian uniforms and camo so before you guys attack me I should defend myself by saying WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ didn't they just call it Iran instead of that stupid ass name that doesn't mean anything? Coalition? What did they mean by a Coalition everybody here wants to kill each other!"
