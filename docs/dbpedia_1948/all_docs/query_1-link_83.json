I just played the whole trilogy that way, which although they require a few quick fixes, seem to be the best way to experience the games at the moment to me, as I played them all at 4K60.\n\nThe HD releases for gen 6 were pretty rough. Lots of bugs.\n\nIs xbox controller supported? I might play all 3 then.\n\nWhat was so buggy about the HD release on ps3?\n\nIs xbox controller supported? I might play all 3 then.\n\nWhat was so buggy about the HD release on ps3?\n\nYup - I played with DS4 windows which maps to an Xbox controller, but with steam input it should be fine. (Maybe now I'm recalling some stuff I had to trouble shoot, but it got sorted).\n\nRe: the HD releases, mainly a lot of audio bugs. Also the bloom lighting was basically missing, which removed a lot of the atmosphere. The 60fps makes a big difference with these games too, in terms of both combat and platforming.\n\nPersonally, the remake is very much wait and see at this point for me. I'm a huge series fan and I'm really not sure that dev is up to the task.\n\nThe original is very dated so I think you should wait for the remake.\n\nI hadn't played it since it first came out so I tried playing it again last year and I gave up after 30 minutes. The controls are bad, the camera is bad and the combat is really boring.\n\nFrom the trailer the combat seemed about the same qhite frankly\n\nThe PSP version is 16/9, but I am lost about naming and editions, so dunno if content is strictly on par with home consoles.\n\nAfaik the PSP versions of WW and TTT are pretty much the same game as the original versions, but have some added extra content.\n\nThe Forgotten Sands is very different from the PC/home consoles version (I actually beat the one on PSP, I think, while I stopped playing the main (PC) version mid game).\n\nAlso no tSoT on PSP.\n\nSands of Time ran flawlessly on PC (both Steam and GOG) for me.\n\nWarrior Within ran okay, with occasional crashes.\n\nTwo Thrones was a real PITA, as there were several documented un-fixed bugs that would stop progression where the Prince just wouldn't make the required jumps. Had to dig through late 2000s Ubiforum threads to look for fixes.\n\nThis was 3 years ago, I think.\n\nTwo Throne is known for being a buggy game on every platform. It's my least favorite\n\nIt depends on how the gamecube version was compare to ps2. I've never played the gamecube version\n\nThey're basically the same? I think it was a little sharper looking on GCN but I don't recall significant visual differences (others may need to correct me on that). Either way, the PS2 and GCN emulators will eliminate a lot of the visual differences if there were any. So I'd suspect the PS2 version running on PCSX2 and the GCN version running on Dolphin won't look that radically different from one another."
