However, after a period of silence, Ubisoft now says that the remake \"has passed an important internal milestone and development is progressing.\"\n\nWhile a release window for the remake remains a mystery, a new Prince of Persia game is coming early next year. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a new action-adventure platformer from Ubisoft that is \"inspired by the Metroidvania structure\" and launches for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One on January 18.\n\nWritten by Sean Carey\n\nAvid Xbox and achievement fan, Sean has committed to playing the best RPGs, racing games, and first-person shooters Xbox Game Pass and his precious free time will allow.
