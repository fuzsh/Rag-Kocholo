        "text": "The marketing for ‘Star Wars: Outlaws’ sells it as the first open-world Star Wars game in history. And with multiple planets in a galaxy far, far away, that opens up the possibilities of how far we can travel as Kay Vess in this highly anticipated adventure. To that end, Julian Gerighty, the game’s creative director, recently talked about what players can expect regarding the size of the game’s map (or maps?).\n\nWhat can we expect from the size of Star Wars Outlaws?\n\nIn an interview with IGN, Gerighty talked about what it was like to pitch the game to LucasFilm Games and “how, excuse the pun, massive it is to build a game like this.” It was important to the studio that the game be open-world because “the outlaw fantasy really needs that to live and breathe.”\n\nAs with any open-world game, exploration is extremely important and something that fans of the Galaxy created by George Lucas will want to explore. ‘Star Wars Outlaws’ tries to take advantage of the players’ curiosity, because every time you reach a new world, “you’ll have a map where you can see mountains over there and stuff, but discovery is what gives you more information.” This is where the size comes in, as each planet and moon we visit in the game will vary in size and what we can traverse.\n\n“It was less about how big, but more about how long in terms of traversal with the speeder it would be,” Gerighty reveals. “[Toshara takes] four or five minutes nonstop, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but once you’re committed it’s a fairly large amount, and you are always going to be distracted. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, which was one of the games that we were looking at while creating this, you have different zones on the map [...][Toshara is] two or three of those put together.”\n\nSomething that is mentioned in this interview is that in addition to the size of the planets, we have to consider the huge amounts of space around each planet, which allows for different areas of exploration while in orbit around the planet you are going to visit."
