        "text": "It is. And, not that I wanna speak for other cultures, I'd argue it's also offensive to other cultures too. PoP is like making a game about \"Asians\" from as White a perspective as possible by mixing Japanese, Chinese, and Korean cultures into one game, without particularly respecting any one of those, calling the game \"Tiger of Tibet\", and then have him be from Vietnam, voiced by a Black person.\n\nThis is the level of absurdity that Prince of Persia is at in terms of its cultural identity.\n\nThe disappointing this is that the game is made in India by Ubisoft Pune and Ubisoft Mumbai.\n\nSo it's brown people themseleves who are doing this to other brown cultures.\n\nCertification and disc printing do not happen mid december because of the holidays etc...\n\nRealistically it has to be done by November, bar some exceptions.\n\nThis comes out in January.\n\nIt's literally impossible that what they showed is \"an alpha\". And I don't mean an actual Alpha because we know Alphas look even more barebones, I mean marketing \"alpha\" as in \"it looks bad but we're trying to optimize\", optimizing isn't going to fix the horror in this case.\n\nthis i dont understand. Why make a trailer with alpha assets or showing the game in this stage. I dont think that the game will ship on 21 jan.\n\nI was always curious about where the POP property is supposed to land in terms of its cultural influences.\n\nIt's a western property but obviously draws from Middle Easter and Asian culture. \"Persia\" in the title obviously means Iran, but Sans of Time is set in the palace of a Maharaja which I think is the title of an Indian monarch. Two Thrones specifically names Babylon as the Prince's home city.\n\nI've only ever played the post-Sands games so I don't know if the history of the franchise goes into greater detail on this.\n\nCompletely unrelated, but I'm also curious about this. I was under the assumption (admittedly just from reading Wiki) that Urdu and Hindi are actually just two standardized varieties of the same language, and that Farsi is a completely different language from both of them though part of the same umbrella language family. Or has Urdu just been way more influenced by Farsi over the years due to geographic proximity to Greater Iran?\n\nEdit: I looked up some shit on Reddit that seems to suggest the historical relationship between Farsi and Urdu is kinda like that between French and English.\n\nHindi developed in India as an offshoot of Sanskrit (a mother language like Latin).\n\nPersian influence created a new language Urdu, when Farsi mixed with Hindi. However, Urdu words have entered into everyday Hindi vocabulary and all Hindi speakers use a smattering of Urdu words, but Urdu and Hindi are different languages with the Hindi writing script based on the Devnagri script (Sanskrit used Devnagri) and Urdu writing script based on Farsi and Arabic. Most Hindi speakers cannot read Urdu.\n\nIt's worse. The two main staff members shown in the dev commentary part after the trailer, the director and the producer of this game, only seem to have had experience working on Just Dance before this game according to their MobyGames pages.\n\nOn one hand, it's super nice for them that they get to learn by remaking a great game like this, and that this will be their debut as a \"main\" Ubisoft studio.\n\nOn the other hand, it is absolutely correct of the majority of posters in this thread to assume that this is Ubisoft treating Prince of Persia as a little side game, almost like a mobile game. In fact, judging from the games they have made, Ubisoft Pune seems to be a studio that yes, helps for Ubisoft's big games, but has never put out something that they are the main developers for... except mobile games, like the (pretty shitty) Prince of Persia: The Shadow and the Flame remake in 2013. Considering the fact that these people have worked on a few PoP titles already, it's likely that the only reason this remake is happening at all is that there are a few PoP fans at that studio, and not because Ubisoft wanted to make it.\n\nMy god what is this awful shit. I had forgotten Ubisoft had also remade POP2 and never checked it out. Why does the Prince look like his Warrior Within self? lol\n\nWell for such a \"PoP fan\" he clearly missed the plot about the original game taking place in... India, not Persia.\n\nAnd as we all know there is no way to have any representation of a culture if the game isn't set in that country. Just look at Ghost of Tsushima. They had zero representation of Mongols culture and traditions, right?\n\nIt's not like that in the game's story this take place after Persia had conquered India, so it wouldn't be out of place if some Persian artifacts, literature, notes, letters, equipment, etc, were found in the environment.\n\nIt's not like Prince could wear a more Persian style clothing.\n\nIt's not like Prince himself is supposedly from Persia so it would make perfect sense for him to say some small Farsi sentences whenever he is frustrated that he couldn't make a jump in platforming or messed up in combat.\n\nIt's not like Ubisoft mixed up the Arabic and Persian culture so much in the first game that they had Arabic inscriptions on Prince's sword in the original release but now they've taken that out and instead of maybe adding some Farsi inscriptions in there to you know, have a small nod to the fact that Prince is supposed to be from Persia, they've decided to just have no inscriptions at all.\n\nIt's not like Ubisoft did a behind the scenes video right after the announcement which they could've used to at least acknowledge the fact that this Prince of Persia game, is gonna have some representations of Persian culture as well, but instead they didn't even mentioned Persia or Persian culture even once outside of saying the title of the game.\n\nYes, you are absolutely right. The game takes place in India (just the beginning of it, then it goes to the fictional land of Azad) so there was no way for Ubisoft to have any Persian representation. Silly me.\n\nHe helped with it, but not directly, read here for info: http://jordanmechner.com/sands-of-time-remake/\n\nI like to think that he didn't know the game would end up looking like this 4 months away from launch. I'm still shook by that trailer, there's no words to describe how shit Ubisoft is for treating one of their masterpieces like this.\n\nOh I see, so he is aware of it.\n\nI hope he did not know, I am pretty sure he never wanted his creation to be something like this I can imagine.\n\nI am on the same page, especially you would never think this would look so low budget, from a huge game company.\n\nYou know for me it's even the name that stinks of low effort. At least some of the other studios throw out wanky names like \"Reimagined\" or \"Origins or \"Revisited\"\n\nThis?\n\n\"Prince of Persia Remake\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It's a remake of Prince of Persia.\"\n\n\"... shall we think of another title?\"\n\n\"Nah. Print it.\"\n\nalso, PoP Sands of Timer was already a remake of the original game, and there was another, more faithful, 2.5d remake for Xbox 360 in 2007.\n\nAnd there was PoP 2008 which could be considered a remake of the original as well.\n\nSo this is the fourth remake.\n\nWhat really sucks is I would LOVE to replay a remastered Sands of Time at 60 fps on PS4 over this trash.\n\nI haven't played it in like 15 years\n\nthere is the port on PS3 and the original is playable in 960p/1920p on Xbox One.\n\nA Persian PoP fan's take on the remake.\n\nThe remake isn't authentic to Persian culture as it features an Arabic prince with an Indian princess in Indian based lands/world.\n\nThe story is set during a Persian invasion of India, and the princess is Indian.\n\nThe story is set during a Persian invasion of India, and the princess is Indian.\n\nThat's not an excuse for not having any Persian representation:\n\nAnd as we all know there is no way to have any representation of a culture if the game isn't set in that country. Just look at Ghost of Tsushima. They had zero representation of Mongols culture and traditions, right?\n\nIt's not like that in the game's story this take place after Persia had conquered India, so it wouldn't be out of place if some Persian artifacts, literature, notes, letters, equipment, etc, were found in the environment.\n\nIt's not like Prince could wear a more Persian style clothing.\n\nIt's not like Prince himself is supposedly from Persia so it would make perfect sense for him to say some small Farsi sentences whenever he is frustrated that he couldn't make a jump in platforming or messed up in combat.\n\nIt's not like Ubisoft mixed up the Arabic and Persian culture so much in the first game that they had Arabic inscriptions on Prince's sword in the original release but now they've taken that out and instead of maybe adding some Farsi inscriptions in there to you know, have a small nod to the fact that Prince is supposed to be from Persia, they've decided to just have no inscriptions at all.\n\nIt's not like Ubisoft did a behind the scenes video right after the announcement which they could've used to at least acknowledge the fact that this Prince of Persia game, is gonna have some representations of Persian culture as well, but instead they didn't even mentioned Persia or Persian culture even once outside of saying the title of the game.\n\nYes, you are absolutely right.

The game takes place in India (just the beginning of it, then it goes to the fictional land of Azad) so there was no way for Ubisoft to have any Persian representation. Silly me.\n\n^^^\n\nI swear some people on here are literally bashing people for demanding a somewhat more respectful representation of Persian culture in a game called fucking Prince of PERSIA. Like what?\n\nJesus Era.\n\n🙄🙄🙄\n\nSands of Time was created as a remake and marketed as a remake. When I'ìm home I will link some sources from the day.\n\nIt is absolutely not a remake. It may have been marketed as so, but that does not make it a remake as we understand it today. Everything about the game is absolutely completely different from the original, how is that a remake? Imagine if the Final Fantasy 7 remake had completely different characters and setting for example, would it even still be a remake?\n\nThat article makes me wonder, why use Anvil at all? Why not just use, you know, Unreal, if Anvil was hard to use for the type of game Sands of Time is?\n\nOnly Ubisoft can assign to a small/support/mobile studio a Remake of one of their biggest games of early 2000s and instead of building it with Unreal Engine they used AnvilNext.\n\nHow can Ubisoft be so out of touch is beyond me.\n\nThe project has been in development for the last two and a half years. We have had at peak 170 members working on this project and not to mention other investments in infrastructure and set up to make a modern game. No there have not been any cutback in budget or timeline for the game.\"\n\n170 devs & 2.5 years and they managed to make a game that looked this bad? Wow\n\nIt is absolutely not a remake. It may have been marketed as so, but that does not make it a remake as we understand it today. Everything about the game is absolutely completely different from the original, how is that a remake? Imagine if the Final Fantasy 7 remake had completely different characters and setting for example, would it even still be a remake?\n\nThere is a Prince, there's the evil vizir, there isa Princess and there are dungeons. The fondamentals of the original 1989 game.\n\nBefore the Remake Police came into town when the term \"remaster\" became a thing, remakes were often very different game from the originals. They just need to tell the same basic story.\n\nFor example Tomb Raider Anniversary, Space Quest, REmake, etc... the same Resident Evil 2 is deeply different from the original, and everybody used the term \"remake\".\n\nAnd as we all know there is no way to have any representation of a culture if the game isn't set in that country. Just look at Ghost of Tsushima. They had zero representation of Mongols culture and traditions, right?\n\nIt's not like that in the game's story this take place after Persia had conquered India, so it wouldn't be out of place if some Persian artifacts, literature, notes, letters, equipment, etc, were found in the environment.\n\nIt's not like Prince could wear a more Persian style clothing.\n\nIt's not like Prince himself is supposedly from Persia so it would make perfect sense for him to say some small Farsi sentences whenever he is frustrated that he couldn't make a jump in platforming or messed up in combat.\n\nIt's not like Ubisoft mixed up the Arabic and Persian culture so much in the first game that they had Arabic inscriptions on Prince's sword in the original release but now they've taken that out and instead of maybe adding some Farsi inscriptions in there to you know, have a small nod to the fact that Prince is supposed to be from Persia, they've decided to just have no inscriptions at all.\n\nIt's not like Ubisoft did a behind the scenes video right after the announcement which they could've used to at least acknowledge the fact that this Prince of Persia game, is gonna have some representations of Persian culture as well, but instead they didn't even mentioned Persia or Persian culture even once outside of saying the title of the game.\n\nYes, you are absolutely right. The game takes place in India (just the beginning of it, then it goes to the fictional land of Azad) so there was no way for Ubisoft to have any Persian representation. Silly me.\n\nPreach. It's ridiculous how brown cultures just get mish mashed together as if there is no difference, and of course there would be a crowd here who would excuse that shit.\n\nThere is a Prince, there's the evil vizir, there isa Princess and there are dungeons. The fondamentals of the original 1989 game.\n\nBefore the Remake Police came into town when the term \"remaster\" became a thing, remakes were often very different game from the originals. They just need to tell the same basic story.\n\nFor example Tomb Raider Anniversary, Space Quest, REmake, etc... the same Resident Evil 2 is deeply different from the original, and everybody used the term \"remake\".\n\nAh yes, the same basic story of using magical sands and a dagger to rewind time and sand monsters, yes, I do remember that from the original game. It's true, the fundamentals are there, but everything is so completely different that is disingenuous to call it a remake, even today.\n\nREmake is basically the same game. Resident Evil 2's gameplay is more like Resident Evil 4, but you can still recognize everything else as RE2. Same for Tomb Raider Anniversary.\n\nAt the end of the day, I feel like this is a semantics discussion. Not really productive, I guess it depends on what your definition of remake is, as muddy as it is today."
