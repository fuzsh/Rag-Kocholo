        "text": "The objective of the study is to analyse popular video games with historical content and their influence on the reception and formation of historical knowledge and understanding. The key features of video games are: their hybrid nature, the significant impact on the young population, and, unlike other audiovisual media, the incitement to action and experiential engagement with history. Research will be undertaken in two parts. Five popular video games will be analysed; this will then be followed by an examination of commentary, discussions and disputes of players in specialized internet forums. More specifically, the survey results will relate to: 1) Decoding of the game ideology, 2) examination of their influence on the players’ historical knowledge and culture and, 3) examination of significations of historical thinking.\n\n\"This piece deals with the significance of computer games in the modern teaching process. The author identified the main challenges for the teachers that are related to problems created by electronic entertainment. The second part of the text focuses on the positive impact of video games exemplified by popular „mods” based on actual historical events. In conclusion, the author stated that it will still be many years before computer games are used by researchers in the process of teaching the academic youth, however they do have the potential to become something more than just pure fun.\"\n\nCultural and historical heritage is a precious, unique and irreplaceable asset for every place in the contemporary world. This spots the responsibility on modern society to safeguard and preserve it, as well as to convey it to the next generations. The ability of digital games to act, as virtual learning environments, and as tools for the dissemination of cultural heritage, has already been extensively documented, but their use in this scientific area remains limited. This study concerns the evaluation of two digital games of historical and cultural content. These are “Secrets of the past DION” designed by “Culturplay” and “Ancient Greek Temple” developed by the “Department of Information and Education of the Acropolis Restoration Service (YSMA)”. The games were randomly selected and are addressed to adults and children. The first was designed for mobile devices and PCs and includes views of high-quality 3D reproductions of ancient Greek artefacts and the second is a free online educational digital application about the architecture of the ancient Greek temple. In order to assess these two games we used the four criteria of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model. The criteria were: Reaction, Learning, Behavior, Results. We found that the specific digital games meet the above mentioned criteria. In conclusion, it seems that digital games of cultural historical content, can be used as an intriguing learning alternative, and should be considered as useful tools for the dissemination of the cultural-historical heritage of a country.\n\nThis book explains how designing, playing and modifying computer games, and understanding the theory behind them, can strengthen the area of digital humanities. This book aims to help digital humanities scholars understand both the issues and also advantages of game design, as well as encouraging them to extend the field of computer game studies, particularly in their teaching and research in the field of virtual heritage. By looking at re-occurring issues in the design, playtesting and interface of serious games and game-based learning for cultural heritage and interactive history, this book highlights the importance of visualisation and self-learning in game studies and how this can intersect with digital humanities. It also asks whether such theoretical concepts can be applied to practical learning situations. It will be of particular interest to those who wish to investigate how games and virtual environments can be used in teaching and research to critique issues and topics in the humanities, particularly in virtual heritage and interactive history.

The game was designed to combine clear pedagogical principles of teaching History with the best of contemporary digital gaming technology. The intention of the game is to engage players in an immersive virtual environment where their interactions with characters, artefacts and historic events through a series of puzzles will develop their understanding of the historical importance of the island of Iona and spark curiosity to learn more about the past. A Design-based Research (DBR) approach was used in this study and the data was collected on a trial day of the prototype of the game. The data was collected from a small sample of players (aged 10-14 years), using methods of questionnaires, interviews and Video Commentary Capture Model (VCCM) to record gamep...\n\nThis article approaches games from the perspectives of design and analysis in order to describe how games might employ pedagogical strategies that capitalize on their strengths as interactive media while avoiding the pitfalls of traditional learning games. Specifically, it draws attention to how games employ world building through lore-such as through item text descriptions-as well as affective game design aesthetics to create a learning experience closer in similarity to touring a museum than reading a textbook. Describing this phenomenon as the interactive museum, the article discusses how the concept operates through an analysis of the game Valiant Hearts: The Great War. The article first addresses games as teaching tools, including their potential to teach about historical wars, while paying close attention to the ethical dilemma of producing an entertaining game that also aims to teach. The design analysis begins by examining item text descriptions, lore and historical world building before describing the affective aesthetic of the interactive museum. The article concludes with a discussion on games' potential use of tangential learning as a method to teach through interactivity."
