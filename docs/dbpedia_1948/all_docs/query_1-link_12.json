        "text": "Prince of Persia is a long adventure that takes you throughout the massive confines of the Sultan's palace. PoP is not broken into chapters or easily divisible sections within the game itself. There are, however, 39 Save Points throughout the 10-hour quest and each Save Point has a name. For the purposes of this walkthrough, we have separated each section by Save Point. The section details everything that takes place from the moment you leave one Save Point until you reach the next. If you want to find out what to do next, look at the name of the Save Point when you load your game and go to that section.\n\nBelow is a list of all 40 sections (including the beginning, where there is no Save Point). Look for the name of your current Save Point in the list below and click the corresponding section to jump to the correct page."
