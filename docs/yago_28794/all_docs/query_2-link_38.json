        "text": "The controversial writer Michel Houellebecq has been awarded France's highest honour.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron presented him with the Légion d'honneur at the Elysée Palace in Paris, with former president Nicolas Sarkozy attending.\n\nA polarising figure, Mr Houellebecq has been hailed as France's greatest living writer for his sharp observations of modern society.\n\nBut his critics accuse him of misogyny, racism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"It seems to me today he makes the most of other peoples' hatreds in his books,\" Guardian Books editor Sian Cain told the BBC. \"Whether that's talent or opportunism, I don't know.\"\n\nWho is Michel Houellebecq?\n\nThe 63-year-old was born Michel Thomas on France's Indian Ocean island of Réunion in 1956.\n\nHe moved briefly to Algeria until going to live with his grandmother in Paris at the age of six, after his mother moved to Brazil to live with a new boyfriend. His pen name, Mr Houellebecq, was his grandmother's maiden name.\n\nThe author is a friend of many of French society's movers and shakers, having met both Mr Macron and his predecessor Mr Sarkozy. Carla Bruni-Sarkozy once recorded a song version of one of Mr Houellebecq's poems.\n\nFrance's former first lady posted a picture on Instagram of the writer and his new wife Lysis on their wedding day last year and thanked him for \"letting us share your happiness\".\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

But mosques throughout France and the country's Human Rights League criticised the writer.\n\nFor his 2010 work La Carte et le Territoire (The Map and the Territory) he was awarded the prestigious Prix Goncourt, but his sixth novel, Soumission (Submission), proved to be his most controversial.\n\nSet in 2022, it depicts France under Sharia (Islamic) law without gender equality and a protagonist who eventually decides to convert to Islam and to practise polygamy.\n\n\"Certainly a feminist is not likely to love this book,\" Mr Houellebecq told the Paris Review ahead of the book's release, saying he did not consider himself a misogynist.\n\nHe also told the interviewer that \"we have extended the domain of 'racism' by inventing the crime of Islamophobia\", while saying the Koran \"turns out to be much better than I thought\".\n\nBut its release date, 7 January 2015, was also the date of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo terror attacks in Paris.\n\nThe satirical magazine featured a cartoon of Mr Houellebecq on its front cover on the day of the attack, and the writer was placed under round-the-clock police protection in its wake.\n\nWhat has he been up to lately?\n\nMr Houellebecq's latest work Sérotonine (Serotonin) was released in January and is seen as a novel about France's \"gilets jaunes (yellow vests)\" protests, even though it was written before the demonstrations began.\n\n\"He has a knack for speaking to the political moment,\" The Times' deputy book editor James Marriott told the BBC, adding that he is not a fan of the author but \"interested in him\".\n\nHe has broadly refused media appearances since the Charlie Hebdo shooting, although Mr Houellebecq recently published an article for Harpers magazine calling US President Donald Trump \"one of the best American presidents I've ever seen,\" although \"pretty repulsive\"."
