        "text": "Â When best-selling and famously reclusive novelist Michel Houellebecq disappeared during his book tour in 2011, the rumors that spread regarding his whereabouts ran the gamut from suicide to, as the title suggests, a kidnapping. So endless was the speculation that we now have a perfectly perplexing film about it. Partly based on real-life events and starring Houellebecq himself, this fascinating and, despite its ominous-sounding title, wildly funny film blurs the line between fiction and documentary.\n\nÂ\n\nAn elegant prankster, enfant-terrible, intellectual, provocateur, and a free and non-conformist person will always find his way of any situation, even the most absurd one. And will not only find his way of, but will stay true to himself â drink wine, love women, discuss and go into debates. His ideas, way of thinking and behaviour will turn the story in an unexpected way, and it does not really matter that his ânewly-madeâ friends and a spectator expected something different. And yet you wonder how much it is truly documentary, however. V. L..\n\nAwards\n\nTribeca Film Festival â Best Screenplay (2014)\n\nÂ\n\nGuillaume Nicloux\n\nÂ\n\nFrom experimental cinema to film noir triptych, from comedy to political film, passing by drama, Guillaume Nicloux explores different genres and weaves complex but inseparable links between each of his films. He is also a novelist and has taught at la FÃ©mis for the past ten years.\n\nÂ\n\nSelected Filmography\n\nÂ\n\nThe Nun / La religieuse (2013)\n\nThe Key / La clef (2007)\n\nThe Flying Children / Les enfants volants (1991)\n\nÂ Â"
