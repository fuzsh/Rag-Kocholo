With this plot it is logical that the Lanzarote scenes were shot in Timanfaya. More than thirty films have been set in this volcanic area of the island.\n\nThe idea of using Timanfaya as a setting in which to illustrate other planets has been seen before (Mine Enemy, Mission Stardust, Krull and Stranded, among other films), but this burnt volcanic landscape has also given rise to the recreation of post-apocalyptic worlds on Earth itself: Operation Ganymed ( 1977), Beyond the End of the World (1978), Human Animals (1983) as well as this film entitled The Possibility of an Island ( 2008).\n\nThe Timanfaya National Park is one of the great jewels of the island’s impressive geology (Lanzarote is recognised by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve and Geopark). The quality and aesthetic uniqueness of its volcanic landscapes is further enhanced by the chromatic tones brought out by the sunlight at sunset and sunrise. Although it receives almost a million tourists annually, visits to Timanfaya are very controlled and only a few routes can be reached by bus or camel, as there are areas of great geological fragility where no human has set foot for decades."
