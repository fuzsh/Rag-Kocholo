        "text": "Things start out well but as time passes, the film loses its intrigue and becomes too self-indulgent. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Nov 2, 2022\n\n... moves between fiction and documentary; between the density of drama and the lightness of comedy... [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Dec 12, 2017\n\nThe Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq is on one hand a rather ingenious take on the artist documentary, on the other, a tabletop comedy of manners, closer to something by Gianni Di Gregorio or Hong Sang-soo than to Houellebecq's own work.\n\nFull Review | Dec 7, 2015\n\nThere's something undeniably comic about this combination of the cultivated and the infantile.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jun 5, 2015\n\nHilarious, full of humor that is understated, wry and dependent on familiarity with interests as wide as Houellebecq's own.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Mar 25, 2015\n\nAt first, the movie is offbeat enough to be entertaining anyway; but like the title character, it quickly outstays its welcome.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Mar 25, 2015\n\nThis is pretty much the opposite of a contemporary American comedy: rather than broad, \"The Kidnapping of Michel Houllebecq\" is an exemplary example of narrow.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Mar 25, 2015\n\nThe Houellebecq we see on screen is obviously rooted as much in fiction as in fact, yet what makes his performance so fascinating is the mischievous glee he takes in sending up his own persona.\n\nFull Review | Mar 24, 2015\n\nEven though the film takes on a more overtly fictive aesthetic after he's kidnapped, Michel Houellebecq's understated presence lends the proceedings a factual quality throughout.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Mar 23, 2015"
