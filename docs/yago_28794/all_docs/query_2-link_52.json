        "text": "Starring Michel Houellebecq. In French, with English subtitles. Rating unavailable.\n\nPoet, essayist, and author of such novelistic provocations as The Elementary Particles, Michel Houellebecq was a polarizing figure in European political culture long before the infamous Charlie Hebdo attacks, which came right after he published Submission, a satirical novel about the imposition of Shariah law in France.\n\nPlaying himself here, he’s a gnomic cross between Roman Polanski and Mr. Bean, chain-smoking his way through discussions of the finer points of Mozart and Janis Joplin with his sister (The Mother and the Whore’s Françoise Lebrun), decrying Le Corbusier’s “totalitarian mindset”, and following daily rituals that include frequent church visits. (“Funerals,” he tells a friend, “never weddings.”) Then he’s shoved into a box and carted off to a distant junkyard, for reasons his captors never explain, or seem to understand themselves.\n\nWritten and directed by Guillaume Nicloux, best known for French crime thrillers, The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq was shot mockumentary-style and feels largely improvised. Houellebecq did disappear briefly, in 2011, under mysterious circumstances, and this movie answers no questions, raising perverse questions instead. At one point, a radio voice is heard, acknowledging his absence and wondering whether to blame “al-Qaeda, psychotic delusion, or identity crisis”.\n\nIt’s all very French, then, and probably too inside for many viewers. This is a place where you argue with a gang of would-be criminals about H.P. Lovecraft’s writing cushion, answer questions from a bodybuilder (former Mister Universe Maxime Lefrançois) about the need for writerly “style” in fiction, challenge someone to a poem-off, and squeeze in some downtime with a local prostitute called Fatima. Houellebecq confesses that he can’t hear the name Mallarmé without thinking of being “poorly armed”.\n\nHouellebecq’s vague annoyance is consistent, whether the subject is as small as how to drink wine in handcuffs or as large as all of Europe. “I’m against it,” he explains, just before the burly head kidnapper (Luc Schwarz) hands him the keys to a shiny new car, as his “cut” of a ransom that never arrives. The implication is that a writer’s (or any public figure’s) relationship with the media is always a kind of hostage standoff—one in which everyone loses before it’s over. But it’s still better to be in the driver’s seat."
