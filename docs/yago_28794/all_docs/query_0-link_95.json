        "text": "In recent years, the research on Schopenhauer has shown a change in the interpretation of his main work, The World as Will and Presentation, from (1) a normative and linear instruction which guides the reader from idealism to mysticism, pessimism and nothingness to (2) value-free and independent descriptions of the world with all phenomena (like idealism, mysticism, nothingness etc.) in it. Thus Schopenhauer’s main work has become an empirical or baconian approach—something like a «philosophical cosmography»—. this fundamentalchange of interpretation radically puts into question what Schopenhauer means by characterizing his main work as an «organic system». The present paper attempts to give an answer to this question, reviewing the self-reflexive, methodological and metaphilosophical hints which Schopenhauer gives in the first volume of his «World» («as Will and Presentation»).\n\nThe Wirkungsgeschichte of Schopenhauerism is a complex mixture of events, encounters, influences and transformations. In order to orient oneself concerning such an articulated phenomenon, it is necessary to have valid hermeneutical tools at hand. In this contribution, I propose a reading of the Wirkungsgeschichte of Schopenhauerism through new and effective historiographical categories that resulted from the research conducted by the Interdepartmental Research Centre on Arthur Schopenhauer and his School at the University of Salento. On the one hand, I will refer to Domenico Fazio’s studies on the Schopenhauer-Schule and, on the other, to Fabio Ciracì’s research on the reception of Schopenhauer’s philosophy in Italy. This approach will reveal how the formulation of the socalled “two souls” of Schopenhauerism, the romantic and the illuministic, allows us to unravel the multifaceted panorama of the Wirkungsgeschichte of Schopenhauerian philosophy, in line with the subdivision within t...\n\nFirst published in 1818, The World as Will and Representation contains Schopenhauer's entire philosophy, ranging through epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind and action, aesthetics and philosophy of art, to ethics, the meaning of life and the philosophy of religion, in an attempt to account for the world in all its significant aspects. It gives a unique and influential account of what is and is not of value in existence, the striving and pain of the human condition and the possibility of deliverance from it. This new translation of the first volume of what later became a two-volume work reflects the eloquence and power of Schopenhauer's prose and renders philosophical terms accurately and consistently. It offers an introduction, glossary of names and bibliography, and succinct editorial notes, including notes on the revisions of the text which Schopenhauer made in 1844 and 1859. • A new accurate translation providing the reader with an up-to-date version of the text • Contains substantial introduction, editorial notes, bibliography, chronology and glossary for aiding those new to the subject and also for highlighting the connections between Schopenhauer and other philosophers and philosophical issues • Full editorial notes within the text provide a useful resource to higher level scholars\n\nThis fine volume is a welcome addition to my shelf of Rüdiger Safranski's biographies of the great German thinkers. I enjoyed his biographies of Nietzsche and Heidegger, as well as his Romanticism, a German affair, which could be called a biography of an era. I look forward to reading his Goethe biography. In these brilliant works Safranski has brought what is now opaque to modern clarity. Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) is mostly remembered for having introduced Buddhist concepts to Western philosophy. While true, in a sense, that tag misleads, since Schopenhauer could hardly have been described as having a Buddha nature. To the contrary, this table tyrant of the Englischer Hof, a Frankfurt tavern, was an irascible, cantankerous monster, as anyone with the temerity to approach him soon found out.\n\nThe World as Will and Representation is the major achievement of Schopenhauer’s life, and the backbone of his intellectual career. In 1844 he published a revised and extended edition of it, and now added a whole second volume of ‘supplementary’ essays. It is this second volume, even longer than the first, that we have here in translation. In 1859, the year before he died, Schopenhauer revised both volumes for a final time, making many further additions.\n\nI attempt to present a more holistic and more detailed account of Schopenhauer's pessimistic philosophical premises and their implications. The discussion begins with Schopenhauer's claim that the world is representation and with the discovering of the Will. It continues by examining the implications of the Will, which leads to the argument against existence itself. KEYWORDS METAPHYSICS, THE WILL, SUFFERING, JUSTIFICATION, PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE RESUMEN Intento presentar una descripción más holística y detallada de las premisas filosóficas pesimistas de Schopenhauer y sus implicaciones. La discusión comienza con la afirmación de Schopenhauer de que el mundo es representación y con el descubrimiento de la voluntad. Continúa examinando las implicaciones de la voluntad, las cuales conducen al argumento contra la existencia misma."
