        "text": "In the future there will be no sex, intimacy or love. Desire and passion will endure only in the typed word. Forget about laughter and tears. People no longer will be humans, but rather \"neo-human\" clones, looking back on their originators' past trying to understand all that has been lost.\n\nThat's the grim future envisioned by French literary provocateur Michel Houellebecq in his latest novel \"The Possibilite d'une ile\" (\"The Possibility of an Island\", in French. 485 pages. Fayard) and judging by the initial French sales, it's a world that hundreds of thousands of French readers find convincing. The book contains elements that have helped turn Houellebecq's previous works into best sellers: a quirky fascination with science, joyless but explicit sex, a clear relish or Western society's decadent decline and a selfish antihero who offers a jaded but honest look at a dehumanized society even as he sinks into hedonism. It's a cautionary tale for a society that doesn't realize that is doing the same.\n\nPublishers smell a gold mine. \"Island\" is being translated into 36 languages, including Icelandic, Korean and Albanian. In Europe, hopes are exceedingly high; Houellebecq's last book, \"Platform,\" sold 50,000 copies each in Spain and Italy and more than 200,000 in Germany. His new novel is in the shortlist for the Goncourt, France's top literary prize, as well as the distinguished Renaudot. The respected conservative daily \"Le Figaro\" has called Houellebecq \"the emblematic writer of his generation\". In late October, an international colloquium of \"Houellebecq specialists \" will spend two days analyzing his oeuvre in Edinburgh, offering up speeches on such topics as: \"Nature in Michel Houellebecq's work\" and \"Phallus,\" examining Houellebecq's heavy sexual content. \"Houellebecq speaks of the contemporary world\", says the writer Josyane Savigneau, former editor of Le Monde's literary supplement. \"In France there are too many narcissistic little novels. People want to about society and what it is becoming \".\n\n\"Island\" is a surprising readable talk of a fascinating, if pathetic, universe defined by the malaise of modern western civilization. The main voice belongs to Daniel1, a provocative performer and filmmaker with a striking similarity to Houellebecq. Daniel1 dumps his wife for a 22-year-old woman, a quarter of century younger than him, whom he discovers while scouting actresses for his sex-laden film, \"The Highway Swingers.\" Interspersed among Daniel1's tales are those of his future clones, Daniel24 and Daniel25. They look back on their human originator's writings and try to find the remaining shreds of their humanity. It is a bleak commentary on modern society, but for all its harshness, there is a profound longing when Houellebecq writes about a world \"that has forgotten how to love.\"\n\nThough Fayard launched \"Island\" with a publicity campaign worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster, Houellebecq is his own single best promotion tool. Early on, the author and his handlers recognized the challenges of standing out in France's cluttered literary market, where 663 books are slated to come out this season -- double the number six years ago. To that end, Houellebecq goes out of his way to provoke, charm or offend. In television interviews, he speaks in a barely audible monotone, coming across as someone struggling with painful shyness. But he mixes his sharp social commentary with seeming calculated diatribes on sex, women and religion. He regularly offers up remarks blasting Islam -- he's called it the world's \"dumbest\" religion -- and promotes the sex trade, among others. In France, that's taken by some as challenging traditional thinking.\n\nHouellebecq's combination of panache and provocation makes him the most influential writer of France right now. He wrote \"Island\" during the off-season at a Spanish resort, where it is easy to picture him smirking while typing up his musings on modern society. If the future does not turn out to be barren of laughter, it will be because Houellebecq had the very last laugh."
