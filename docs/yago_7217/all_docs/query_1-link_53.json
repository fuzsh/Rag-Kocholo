In May 1881, she married Crown Prince Rudolph of Austria, shortly before her 17th birthday.\n\nTheir marriage was an unhappy one.

When Rudolf infected her with a venereal disease, which made further pregnancies impossible, they reportedly discussed divorce.\n\nIn 1889 Rudolf was found dead at Mayerling, with his mistress, the seventeen-year-old Baroness Mary Vetsera, apparently the result of a suicide pact. Her husband's death destroyed Stephanie's hopes of ever becoming the future Empress of Austria, as the scandal resulting from his death and her widowhood isolated her even further from the court in Vienna.\n\nIn 1900 she married Count Elemer Lonyay, a Hungarian diplomatist. She settled with her new husband in his castle Oroszvar - Rusovce in western Hungary, today's Slovakia, until the advancing Red Army forced them to flee their estate.
