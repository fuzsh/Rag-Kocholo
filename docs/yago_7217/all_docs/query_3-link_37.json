        "text": "1835\n\nOn 9 April, birth in Brussels of Leopold, Louis, Philippe, Marie, Victor, son of Leopold I and Louise-Marie.\n\n1853\n\nPrince Leopold entered the Senate, of which he was a member by right. On 22 August, he married Marie-Henriette of Habsburg-Lorraine, Arch-Duchess of Austria. They had four children: Louise-Marie (1858-1924), Leopold (1859-1869), Stephanie (1864-1945), Clementine (1872-1955).\n\n1865\n\nOn 17 December, Leopold took the constitutional oath.\n\n1876\n\nOn 12 December, the King Palace convened an international conference in Brussels of scientists, geographers and explorers, focusing on the discovery of the centre of Africa. This resulted in the setting up (1877) of an \"association for the civilisation and exploration of Central Africa\".\n\n1878\n\nLeopold II set up, with the cooperation of the British explorer Stanley, the Study Committee on the Upper Congo, converted in 1879 into the International Association of the Congo.\n\n1885\n\nThe Berlin Conference recognised the independent state of the Congo, of which Leopold II became the Sovereign. That same year, the Belgian Parliament authorizes the King to be the Head of State of Congo.\n\n1890\n\nIn July, during the Brussels International Conference, a treaty was signed against African slave trade and slave smuggling. This treaty forms the basis of a campaign against slavery in Africa.\n\n1902\n\nOn 19 September, Queen Marie-Henriette died in Spa.\n\n1904\n\nFollowing the excesses committed by the Europeans in Africa, Leopold's reputation and his overseas venture were questioned. The King set up an International Commission of Inquiry, which recognised the merits of the royal action in Congo, while pointing out abuses and shortcomings.\n\n1908\n\nThe law of 18 October made the independent State of the Congo a Belgian colony."
