        "text": "The match with Baudouin (I think) was in order/hopes that Clémentine would be/was her dad's heiress (to his private estate) and thus keep all that lovely money in Belgium. ICR the full-story though\n\nAhhh I see\n\nEveryone handles their depression / anxiety differently, so it's feasible. Some people need meds, some people don't; some people get far lower than others, some people's periods last longer than others. I don't know about handling it with work - it might just be that he's still able to function during a low period, particularly if he has less severe but longer term depressive periods (if that makes sense).\n\nLeopold wanted Clementine to marry Baudouin to keep his line on the throne - since it wouldn't be his son inheriting, he was planning on his grandson eventually inheriting. So no, he's probably still going to be stuck on that match. Baudouin was a good man, for what it's worth.\n\nYeah I get you, hmm that could be an interesting-is that the right word?- thing to explore, seeing how Stephan and Rudi contrast with how they handle their depressive spells. Compared with their mother.\n\nAnd ah I see, hmm, now there's another thought I'd not considered, keeping Baudouin alive and married to Clementine, or having Leopold's own survive (is it possible with a pod in 1868)"
