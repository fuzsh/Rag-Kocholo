On the same subject, does anyone know who the waiter is in the Australia advert - the 'so where the bloody hell are you' one.

He's the one that says 'dinner is served' or something similar.

I know I've seen him in a soap, but I can't work out who he was.

I thought he was married to someone in Home and Away and I read that somewhere thinking that is ironic a husband and wife working in ruval soaps but I can't,fo the life of me,remember which character it was.
