        "text": "When we think of the famous names from Aussie soap Neighbours, hers isn't one that comes to mind. In fact we don't actually remember her name at all, but seeing that round face and jet black hair it all comes flooding back to us.\n\nBrianna 'Bree' Timmins was a fictional character with a bad attitude in Ramsay Street, and we're pretty sure she was Neighbours' first ever goth.\n\nShe was involved in some decent storylines during her two-year stint from 2005 to 2007, including trying to look like Paris Hilton before switching to Goth, and finding out her mother was not her real birth mum.\n\nHowever, fast forward nine years and the cuddly young teenager has disappeared and been replaced with a curvy blonde woman.\n\nThe actress who played Bree, Sianoa Smit McPhee, is now a singer hoping to take the music world by storm, even though she's still been acting steadily for the past few years.\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking the younger McPhee and the current one are different people, as Sianoa has undergone a massive transformation and looks completely different to her Goth days.\n\nEven compared to her young-self out of character, Sianoa shows no resemblance of her former days having grown her hair long and slimmed down.\n\nWhile still appearing in a few feature films, she now wants to concentrate on music and said: \"I want to be iconic, not in an ego way, but I want to make classic pop music like Michael Jackson or Madonna.\"\n\nShe continued telling the Telegraph: \"When I see photos of myself between the ages of like 10 and 17, I guess I went through this teen awkward phase, I was totally comfortable [back then] but it doesnâ€™t vibe with me now.\"\n\nSianoa is currently based in Melbourne where with her American hubby she's been busy writing and recording new music.\n\nShe added: \"Whatever acting comes up, I am going to be more particular about what I do because right now I am focusing on music.\""
