        "text": "Swim registration is moving back online! Timmins Recreation Online launches January 2 - one website where you can book ice time, register for swimming lessons, view the availability of the City's rental spaces, request a booking, make payments, and more. You can create your personal or family account today and start to familiarize yourself with the site before it goes LIVE! Why? Because the next registration for private swim lessons is coming up in February and it's first come first serve ... and it can go fast. Save time and be ready to register! Here's the link: https://lnkd.in/gjSmQPmp Organizations, hockey associations, and sports teams will continue to register as usual. You do not need to make an account at this time. #timminsrecreationonline #timmins #registeronline #account\n\nMYTH â€” mostly. While swimming pools are a great investment for your family's fun and entertainment, historically they have not been the best value add when it comes to increasing your home's value. However, since the pandemic, this is not always the case! You may be able to recoup your money, it really depends on the community, what you built, and of course who you contracted to build it. Follow us for more seller tips. ðŸ˜‰ #countoncooley #callthecooleys #realestatetexas #TheFranklinTeam #eXpRealty #RealEstateTips #MythOrrFact #Pool #RealEstateMythOrFact #HomeSellerTips\n\nThe numbers aren't adding up for many swimming pools at the moment. The number of people coming through the door continues to drop, prices continue to rise, and many operators are caught between a rock and a hard place. Private swimming classes are not something thatâ€™s open and accessible to everybody, but at a time when the industry is struggling badly, doesnâ€™t it make sense to diversify where we can? By using just a small portion of the pool for private classes, run by trained individuals working for themselves, operators can unlock a new, highly profitable income stream that can be used elsewhere.

I've written PRESS DAY in capitals because thatâ€™s how it looms in the calendar each month. Itâ€™s the day we upload Outdoor Swimmer to the printer. Once itâ€™s done, we have a brief moment to celebrate and relax, but the work isnâ€™t over. Here are a few things we do, as well as getting started with the next issue: - create and upload the files for our digital editions - create marketing assets for the new issue - upload premium content to our website - prepare our weekly email newsletter - continue marketing activity for our current issue Last Thursday was PRESS DAY for our January issue (see below), which is being printed now and should be posted next week, hopefully arriving between Christmas and New Year. It seems strange to be thinking about January before Christmas, but thatâ€™s what we have to do. The issue looks great, BTW.\n\nFishing, boating, sunshine, swimming, baseball, long evenings, camp-fires, road-trips, family picnics.

Today, I have five fish in the chlorinated pool. So they are like super mutant fish. Tomorrow, my Board member's kids are going to go fishing - in my pool.
