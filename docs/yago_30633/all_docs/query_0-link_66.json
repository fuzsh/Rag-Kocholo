        "text": "Casting\n\nDamien Bodie had previously made two appearances in Neighbours as Charlie Moyes in 1996 and Liam Rigby in 1999, before securing the role of Dylan Timmins in 2005. Bodie did not think he would be cast as a series regular due to his looks, saying \"Being pale and skinny, I never thought I'd be a long term Neighbours regular. I wasn't tanned or beachy. I thought that would never happen.\"\n\nIn October 2006, it was announced that Bodie had decided to leave Neighbours.\n\nStorylines\n\nAfter arriving in Erinsborough, Dylan goes to the Community Hall and berates a man who was being cruel to a dog. Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) and Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher) witness this and are impressed. Dylan goes to Susan Kennedy's (Jackie Woodburne) house, where his brother Scott (Ben Nicholas) is living. Dylan tells Susan and Serena that he had just been released from juvenile detention. When Stingray returns home, he punches his brother. Dylan claims that he has been violent towards Stingray in the past and Susan convinces Stingray to give Dylan another chance. Susan invites Dylan to stay with her and gets him a place at Erinsborough High. On his first day, Dylan takes his car and convinces Serena and Stingray to take the morning off school. Stingray later tells Susan what they had done.\n\nDylan observes a local dog-catcher and releases all the dogs from his van. He tries this a second time, but is prevented by Stingray.

When Susan finds out she tells him that they are on their final chance, though she is grateful to have Audrey back. Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney) returns to Ramsey Street and Dylan moves in with her.

Paul is livid, but realises that Dylan had acted within his best interests. Sky and Dylan begin a relationship.\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of Lassiter's, Paul asks Dylan and his daughter Elle (Pippa Black) to come up with competing celebration ideas. Dylan wins with his plan for an extravagant 40s-style joy-flight from Melbourne to Tasmania. Roo reappears and kidnaps Stingray and threatens violence against him unless Dylan robs a service station at gunpoint. Following the robbery Roo makes an anonymous tip-off to the police. Paul agree to help Dylan as they set off on the joy-flight, but warns him he might never be able to return. However, a bomb, that had been planted on the plane, explodes over the Bass Strait. Dylan is washed up the shore along with Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey). Dylan decides to fake his own death and escape prison. The pair live rough in the bush for some time.\n\nDylan finds a newspaper about the plane crash, and that Sky has survived.

He takes Kerry to a hotel, but Elle finds them and returns Kerry. Sky, Dylan and Stingray decide to have a DNA test and it is announced that Dylan is Kerry's father.

Dylan trashes the Scarlett Bar and he is discovered by Boyd. Kim coaxes Dylan into attending the funeral. Steiger tells Kim to take Dylan away from Erinsborough to regain his mind. Dylan claims he is angry all the time and that he could not laugh or cry or share stories about Stingray. Kim convinces him that it would be better for all if he goes away to regain his composure, so he can return and be a proper father to Kerry. Dylan says his goodbyes, though only Bree realises what is happening and begs him to stay. Dylan promises to return when he gets better.
