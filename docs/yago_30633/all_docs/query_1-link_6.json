One such occasion occurred when Kim married bogan Janelle Rebecchi, when Alwyn threatened to cut off his sons inheritance if he went ahead with the union. Kim called his fathers bluff and walked away from the money, going on to have five children with Janelle. In the years the followed, Alwyn and Loris softened towards Kim and his brood, and again made an offer  this time and job and a roof over his familys head, and he could stay with Janelle. Still furious about them cutting off his inheritance, pride prevented Kim from accepting, which caused a massive rift between him and Janelle. Alwyns marriage to Loris was also on shaky ground  his health was faltering and she had found out that he had a long-term, much younger, mistress, who he opted to spend his final days with, while Loris went to Erinsborough to try to patch things up with her family.\n\nBiography by Steve"
