        "text": "They are quite similar. Sheila does remind me a bit of Janelle and both families do come from quite a rough background it has been implied. Not to mention they both lived at the same house, which is ironic really as both are meant to be of a lower social standing yet number 26 was always meant to be the largest and most desirable house on Ramsay Street. Although having said that neither family owned the property the Canning's are renting from Paul I believe and Lyn owned the house when the Timmins lived there.\n\n0\n\nNo, I don't think the two families are similar at all, other than sharing a bogan background. The Timmins dynamic came from Janelle's permissive parenting, her kids reckless behaviour and the contrast between them and their more 'grounded' Neighbours. They were usually always involved in some crazy, comedy-based stuff.\n\nThe Canning's are far more 'normal' and only really get into the lighthearted stuff when Sheila is being controlling/ interfering.\n\n0\n\nYes, which makes even more sense, as theres no way that posh woman would have raised Janelle like that.\n\nWasn't it just that Janelle went off the rails young and her mum disowned her for years? Would love to see Janelle back full time but not with a contrivance like this. Although not sure why she would come back otherwise really.\n\n0\n\nFor Lous funeral?\n\nWe're they close though? I guess I'm over thinking it. It will be great to have her back. Thinking about it it might actually be good if she turned out to be Sheila's daughter. They would make great sparring partners. However Naomi already covers that role.\n\n0\n\nI remember Loris Janelle's posh mother-in-law who lived in a mansion and tried to seduce Ned The storyline with Loris swapping her baby granddaughter was quite similar to Kathy Carpenter giving Paige away which came out this year. Just like Kathy Loris was very wealthy and spoilt her remaining grandchildren out of guilt for what she had done to their sibling. Both granny's were also very remorseful and tried to right their mistakes. I remember Loris also dated Harold for a brief period when they bonded over Kerry, their shared great-granddaughter. There was a very odd set up at one point as Harold was dating Loris and at the same time Lou was dating Janelle.\n\n0"
