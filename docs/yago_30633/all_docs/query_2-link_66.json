        "text": "Violet H. Sweet OBITUARY\n\nVIOLET H. SWEET, 87, OF NAZARETH Violet H. Sweet, 87, of Nazareth, PA, formerly of Madison, NJ, died Sunday at Moravian Hall Square, a retirement community in Nazareth where she had resided for twelve years. She was born in Timmins, Ontario, on March 27, 1925, the youngest of seven children of the late Scammon and Natalie Hoyt. She grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and, as a young woman, worked as an instructor at Arthur Murray Dance Studios. One of her students was Howard O. Sweet. The two fell in love and married at her home in Manhattan on June 7, 1947. The couple moved to the Washington, DC, area, where they started a family and lived for 15 years. In 1962, the family moved to Madison, NJ. After raising five children, Mrs. Sweet worked in accounting for a number of years. She was also a member of the United Methodist Church in Madison. In 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Sweet moved to Moravian Hall Square. Violet was a devoted, loving mother, who thoroughly enjoyed her children and loved spending time with her family. She cared deeply for those less fortunate than her, as evidenced by her generosity to causes related to child and animal welfare, as well as her volunteer work at Pine Acres nursing home in Madison, where she often chose to spend time with residents who had no other visitors. Violet was known for her love of music and her beautiful singing voice, which she freely shared until her final weeks. In addition to her husband, who died in 2006, Mrs. Sweet was also predeceased by her siblings, Margery, Deming, Bob, Teddy, Barbara and Donald Hoyt. She is survived by her five children, Barbara Stein, Clarks Green, PA; Judith Sweet Bryant, San Francisco, CA; Carol Sweet, Gloucester MA; Meribah Reitz and husband, Merle, Pottstown, PA, and Howard H. Sweet and wife, Elizabeth, Charlotte, NC; also 11 grandchildren, Matthew and Michael Stein; Tamika, Naima, and Liana Bryant; Janelle, Bevan, Grant, and Lauren Reitz; Mercy and Oscar Sweet, and a great-grandchild, Isaiah Bryant-Martinez. A memorial service will be held in Kortz Hall at Moravian Hall Square in Nazareth, Saturday, Nov. 3, at 3 p.m. Arrangements by Bartholomew-Schisler Funeral Home, 211 East Center St, Nazareth. Memorial contributions may be made to Safe Horizon at www.safehorizon.org. Online condolences may be left at www. schislerfuneralhomes.com/obituaries.htm."
