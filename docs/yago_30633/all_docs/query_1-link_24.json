        "text": "Riley Strain age 22 passed away on March 22, 2024, in Nashville, Tennessee. Born in Springfield, Missouri, on January 2, 2002, Riley’s vibrant spirit and loving nature touched many lives.\n\nRiley was a proud graduate of Kickapoo High School and later attended the University of Missouri Columbia, majoring in business and financial planning. Riley’s ambition led to a promising internship at Northwestern Mutual, where he demonstrated a natural acumen for the industry.\n\nRiley’s commitment to service was evident through the prestigious Presidential Medal for Volunteering, earned by dedicating over 500 hours to the Wonders of Wildlife. This commitment showcased Riley’s deep care for the community and the environment.\n\nRiley embraced outdoor adventures, whether it was hunting, fishing, or simply enjoying the serenity of the lake. Riley’s competitive spirit shone through in tennis matches and his budding interest in the discipline of Jiujitsu. Above all, Riley cherished time spent with family, creating lasting memories.\n\nRiley had a passion for good food, from the comfort of his mom’s chicken Parmesan to the zest of fajitas at local favorites like El Rodeo in Bolivar and El Charro in Nixa and took particular pride in grilling a steak to perfection.\n\nRiley’s warm heart extended to a beloved trio of pets—Miles the golden doodle, Cooper the red heeler, and the German shepherds, Vikka and Vin. They brought Riley joy and companionship.\n\nRiley was preceded in death by his grandfather, Floyd “Ray” Strain. He is survived by his parents Michelle and Chris Whiteid, Ryan and Milli Gilbert, siblings, Brooke Dunbar and Brock Hale; and grandparents: Rosa Lee Strain, Wayne and Eilene Whiteid, Debra Gilbert, Robert and A.J. Gilbert, and Clarence and Rosie Graves. Riley also leaves behind an extended family of uncles, aunts, and cousins that he was very close with and that love him very much. He was very close to his 10 year old niece Henly and cousins Jake and Chelsea plus a 2 year old 2nd cousin Cooper.\n\nA visitation will be held on Friday, March 29, 2024, from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm at Greenlawn Funeral Home East 3540 E. Seminole Springfield, MO 65809 and a Celebration of Life will follow at 2:00 pm. A private burial will be held at a later time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations in Riley’s honor can be made to the Missouri Department of Conservation, with details available at the funeral home.\n\nRiley often quipped, “Green makes you look good.” In that spirit, we ask attendees to wear something green and dress comfortably to honor Riley’s love of life.\n\nRiley Strain’s presence will be profoundly missed, but his joyous approach to life and the happiness he brought to those around him will forever be remembered.\n\nPlease click the link below register to join Livestream."
