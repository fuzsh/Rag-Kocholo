        "text": "Eve Morey (Sonya Rebecchi) and Jonothan Dutton (Tad Reeves) are married.\n\nWhat is the age difference between them as im sure the actor who played Tad is younger than her\n\nI've always thought that too! Not sure to be honest.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia Jonathan was born in 1982 and Eve in 1983 (Ryan who plays Toadie was born in 1979). So, in real life he's actually older.\n\nAs far as the characters go, I think Tad was a couple of years younger than Jonathan (given Tad was around 4-5 years younger than Toadie who is the same age as Ryan) and Sonya is older than Eve (she had Callum at 16 and he was born in 1997, putting her birth year as 1981). That has to affect our perceptions of their ages.\n\nWell, that and Tad died young, so most people unless they've googled him recently still picture the 19-20 year old who died in 2002 forgetting that that was 15 years ago.\n\nAlso Neighbour's Natalie Blair (Carmella Cammeniti) is married to David Hoflin (Oliver Barnes). Their characters actually dated and had a baby together before moving to Sydney and later invited Rebecca and Declan to live with them.\n\n1"
