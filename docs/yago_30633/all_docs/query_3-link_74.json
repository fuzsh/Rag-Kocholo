The structure of Le Devoir was changed in January 1993 by creating a new publisher, “Le Devoir inc. \". The Imprimerie populaire ltée is the majority shareholder, which ensures the independence of the director, as Henri Bourassa wanted. The arrival of new shareholders, including the Quebec Workers' Solidarity Fund, the Desjardins Group, readers and employees, allowed the injection of capital essential to relaunch the newspaper.\n\nBrian Myles, Le Devoir general manager, says the foundation for the publication’s success has come down to strategic choices made over the last several decades. Le Devoir was ahead of the curve in terms of paywalls – it put up its first paywall 25 years ago, long before the likes of The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star made it a standard. Content was free except for a few top stories that were locked. If you wanted to unlock the stories, you had to pay for the content and subscribe.\n\nIn 1908, Henri Bourassa founded \"La Publicité Limitée\", the company behind Le Devoir . The first number appeared on January 10, 1910. Henri Bourassa, who ran the newspaper until his departure on August 3, 1932, surrounded himself from the start with brilliant journalists, including Olivar Asselin, Jules Fournier, Omer Héroux and Georges Pelletier among others. The successive departments of Le Devoir have always favored the primary vocation of the institution: an independent opinion journal. This independence has often had an economic price: loss of advertising revenue, of subscribers.\n\nIn 1913, a significant deficit led to the creation of a new company: the L'imprimerie Populaire Limitée. She succeeds the publishing company La Publicité Limitée. The newspaper survives on fundraising.\n\nIn order to preserve the independence of the newspaper and avoid its takeover by sale or inheritance, Henri Bourassa creates a structure that is unique by its originality. On December 31, 1928, before a notary, the shareholders of the Imprimerie Populaire Limite (IPL) signed a deed of agreement and trust. This results in two trusts.\n\nThe first trust consists of three members and controls 2,501 IPL voting shares, which is half plus one. This trust and the IPL board of directors jointly appoint the director. Consequently, the director is entrusted with this block of actions for the duration of his mandate. He cannot be placed in a minority on the board of directors. A second trust is entrusted with 951 voting shares of IPL. To make certain legal acts concerning the company, the director will need the support of this trust. This is another bulwark ensuring the independence of the newspaper.\n\nLe Devoir does receive undisclosed payments from Google News Showcase along with The Globe and Mail, TorStar, VillageMedia, Black Press Media, SaltWire Network, The Winnipeg Free Press, Glacier Media, Narcity and MétroMédia, a program that pays publishers to curate and package stories that appear in Google’s news products, reported by Torstar, Octobeer 2021.

His claim on his site, \"mainstream media pretends to be impartial, but they increasingly behave like political parties.\"\n\nIn fall 2021, Levant won a major Supreme Court case: A judge in the Federal Court of Canada has ruled the Leaders’ Debates Commission incorrectly denied Rebel News Network accreditation to French-language and English-language competition between the major party leaders. Levantt. His network is funded by donations.\n\nA key argument in Canada's media emerged during the Supreme Court case. Former governor general, President of Waterloo University and debates commissioner David Johnston, in a letter filed in court, cites Rebel News’s fundraising campaigns to raise money to oppose policies, including COVID-19 vaccine passports, a federal bill to amend the Broadcasting Act, the federal government’s quarantine hotel requirements and to constitutionally challenge Saskatchewan’s lockdown law. “Based on the review of the above, Rebel News is actively involved in campaigns about stories it covers. It becomes an actor in these stories. This conduct is a conflict of interest,” Johnston concluded in a letter to the organization denying them access. “In particular, the Commission has interpreted high journalistic standards to mean that journalists should not have a conflict of interest in the story that they are covering,” the commission said in a court filing.\n\nAs we did the research on these media companies in Canada, there are others whose funding mechanisms and mission driven focus may challenge such an interpretation Johnston offers above, but we leave you the readers to decide.

The society has a founding board of 4 directors that are volunteers and don't have any funding or employment relationship to The Tyee and they are hoping to receive Registered Journalism Organization status (RJO) which allows news orgs to be exempt from paying income tax, eligible to claim the Canadian journalism refundable labour tax credit and digital subscribers may be eligible to claim the digital news subscription tax credit. From 2018-2021 The Tyee was owned and operated by a private company owned by Eric Peterson. He's donated the assets of this company to the new nonprofit society and is remaining involved as a major donor, but he is not on the board.\n\nWith a progressive bent, the Tyee does not make a profit and every dollar they invest in journalism.

Their demands of The Tyee are journalistic excellence and independence. They exert zero influence on editorial decision-making. The Tyee received 9% from government funding, 5% from advertising and 2% from grants and contracts. Reader subscription is growing as in 2019, their budget was 29% reader contributions and 56% core steward contributions. This was all per emails with Jeanette Ageson and David Beers.\n\nThe Tyee transparently notes on its web site that it had accepted money in the past from major US environmental foundation, Tides Canada. It published public interest journalism that was produced by other parties who received support from charitable organizations in two ways:\n\nFellowships: The Tyee promoted to its readers the Tyee Investigative and Solutions Fellowships. The money was contributed by donors directly to Tides Canada and an advisory board of experts, arms-length from The Tyee, recommended bursaries to individual journalists who applied for these fellowships. The journalism produced by these fellowship recipients was published by the Tyee.\n\nFee-for-service: The Tyee Solutions Society, a separate non-charitable non-profit was formed in 2009 to produce solutions-focused journalism in the public interest. Its reporting was published on The Tyee and made available free of charge for publication elsewhere. The Tyee Solutions Society secured funding to produce these projects from a variety of Canadian foundations including the Vancouver Foundation, the Real Estate Foundation, Tides Canada, The Catherine Donnelly Foundation, and the McConnell Foundation. The Tyee Solutions Society ceased to exist in 2018.\n\nThe Tyee produced a media backgrounder that includes some info on media funding:\n\nIn 2020, The Tyee received funding from Heritage Canada through the Local Journalism Initiative to support two local reporting beats.
