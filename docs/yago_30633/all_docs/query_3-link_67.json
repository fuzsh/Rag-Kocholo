        "text": "Copenhagen is expensive there is no denying that. But foods food and girls gotta eat. Almost every blog I read prior to coming to Copenhagen mentioned Papirøen so naturally, this was something firmly on the ‘to visit’ list. There had to be something behind the hype.\n\nPapirøen (Paper Island) is a small island in the harbour and once was where the Procurement Association of the Danish Process used to keep their paper storage. So the name Paper Island is rather fitting! With these big halls empty over the years the concept of the Copenhagen Street Food came into fruition in 2014. And what an awesome idea it was. In the last few years, a bridge has been built linking Paper Island to both Christianshavn and Central Copenhagen.\n\nIt’s a beautiful spot in the harbour opposite The Royal Playhouse and Nyhavn and next to the Opera House. It’s in very good creative company. Within the old halls and smaller buildings, there is a creative space which has a current exhibition from Yoko Ono, offices, cafes and The Copenhagen Street Food. Whilst the Street Food opened in 2014 and they had to wait till 2016 for the bridge linking it to central Copenhagen to be completed. The bridge like most of Copenhagen has a cycle lane so make sure you are walking in the right place so you don’t get mowed down by the cyclists!\n\nThe main pull for Paper Island is the street food and trust me it’s well worth a visit. The place is huge! There is a substantial selection of food covering all cuisines from the four corners of the globe. You can get main meals, selections of sides, the naughtiest of sweet treats, great beers, cocktails and juices.\n\nThere is a nice outdoor section which would be bliss on a beautiful sunny day overlooking the harbour. The beaches and tables outside are all communal and there are shipping containers which double as eating areas and seating platforms. Some of the seating areas are also positioned around huge fire pits which on the day we visited were much needed! Even being a chilly day with the sky threatening to rain the outside areas were packed with tourists and locals alike. It is the place to be.\n\nAs soon as you walk into the big factory shed it’s like walking into a travel food heaven. There is more communal benches inside and even some ‘restaurant’ style set ups with tables that you actually book in advance. We opted for the communal benches and some poor chaps had us staring (sorry salivating) at their food while we were trying to decide if we go Chinese, Thai or Mexican. Playing on the industrial feel there were rooftop style areas built upon shipping containers, benches and tables made out of old oil drums and milk cartons, some handy work was made with pallets and they were fashioned into tables and benches. Danish Architecture at its finest.\n\nAll of the food stalls had such brilliant designs. My favourite was this pancake stall. The roof was made of old egg cartons! All of the designs worked well together to create fabulous space.\n\nSome of what we eat and drank included below and spoiler alert it was all DELICIOUS\n\nChicken Penang\n\nChicken pad Thai\n\nPizza slices\n\nNachos\n\nBurrito\n\nRaspberry mojito, passion fruit mojito and strawberry mojito- maybe we had a few too many mojitos\n\nWhisky sour\n\nApple cider and beers\n\nDecadent chocolate mousse\n\nAnd the things at the topped it for the boys was .. a delicious creme brûlée doughnut. They are still talking about how amazing it was!\n\nThe easiest way to reach is across the Inderhavnsbro bridge at the end of Nyhavn or if you are in Christianshavn then it’s only a short walk from the canals.\n\nIf you’re not hungry (and trust me you will be once you get there and the smells hit you) it’s still worth a visit to see what it’s all about and take in the views around the harbour. We didn’t find it overly pricey but it’s still Copenhagen so expect to pay more than you would in the UK.\n\nMore details including opening times and the specific food stalls can be found here\n\nI’ve long been a fan of Sarah and her wife’s blog Sarahpluslaura. Not only are they ridiculously cute and super loved up but they also have been to and blogged about some amazing places! Recently they have been exploring in the US and pictures have been so wanderlust worthy!! The Grand Canyon is high on my to visit list!\n\nThey are a cross-national couple with Sarah from Britain and Laura from the US. They have lived and travelled all over the world and as I have learned from the below they were also the first all-female couple to marry at Westminster on the day the gay marriage became legal in the U.K. Yas Girls!!\n\nI love their take on their adventures in that they travel when they can and they just love exploring and seeing the world together.\n\nMy favourite post is one from their recent travels and is all about the Neon Museum. This place looks insane! So many huge neon signs. I’d never really wanted to go to Vegas but this post and these pictures have created some serious travel inspo!! You can find the link here . You’ll find lots on their blog from travel to lifestyle to super cute pictures of their dog Bisbee.\n\nSarah has said that their blog is a storybook of their lives and I’m so glad that they have allowed us all into their world..\n\nLet me hand over to the lovely Sarah from Sarah Plus Laura.\n\nI’m Sarah and I blog with my wife Laura. We met in 2009, moved to Australia in 2010, we were the first all female couple to marry in Westminster on the day gay marriage became legal in 2014, we then held a wedding celebration in Idaho, USA, Laura’s hometown in June that year. Since being together we have travelled the UK, Europe, Australia and a fair few places in between. Living and loving life.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about travelling?\n\nFinding something new. It’s inspiring, rejuvenating and makes me feel alive.\n\nWhy do you think travelling is important?\n\nWithout it, your world view is so limited. Media only tells one side of a story to understand the world, the people, the reality you need to see it for yourself. I love the quote ‘the world is a book, if you never leave your home you will only ever read one page’\n\nWhat is your favourite photograph from your travels?\n\nWhich is your favourite type of travel/holiday- sun, snow, sea, city, mountains, country?\n\nCan I say all? My current order is mountains, sun, country, snow, sea, city but that’s today. Tomorrow it may be something different 🙂\n\nWho do you usually travel with?\n\nMy wonderful wife and when we can our cockapoo dog, Bisbee\n\nIf you were to give one piece of travel advice what would it be?\n\nPlan. Maybe not everything but having key things to see helps make sure you don’t miss out. We plan our must see’s by following the hashtag for the place on Instagram. We added the Neon Museum to our must do list for Vegas because of the pictures.\n\nTell us the funniest story or a mishap from one of your adventures?\n\nThe mishap was when Laura got bitten by a dog on our 2nd day in Thailand. The whole story is here. The story itself leads to some funny moments among the panic though – me holding on for dear life as some poor Thai child took me on a moped to clear out my bank to pay for the treatment. Or the Jekyll and Hyde character I played in the Thai hospital – swinging between being a dutiful girlfriend checking Laura was okay to have a full on argument with the medical staff who were trying to charge us for everything and the kitchen sink. I managed to argue the bill down from over £4,000 to nearer £1000!\n\nWhere is your favourite place that you’ve been to?\n\nNew Zealand. I had to think long and hard as Santorini is a close second, but for out of this world experiences, New Zealand has it. We climbed a glacier, helicoptered over a glacier, sailed a fjord, bungee jumped and drove our camper van for days seeing only sheep, the occasional person and no traffic lights. Total escapism.\n\nWhere was one place that didn’t live up to the hype?\n\nSingapore. What we were expecting was Asian beauty, what we got was a hot, sticky and overwhelmed in the crowds. I’m sure if you had a local guide it is full of amazing experiences but we won’t rush back.\n\nTell us one place/experience on your bucket list?\n\nI think right now I’ll pick the Florida Keys, or maybe Florida as a whole. I want to do the theme parks and drive the Keys. See the long, beautiful beaches, azure sea and make a road trip to the islands. Laura (my wife) on the other hand is desperate to do a trip to the North Pole on an ice-cutting boat. At a cool $20k for 3 weeks at sea, she’ll need to find another travel buddy for that 😊\n\nWhat is the one thing you wouldn’t travel without?\n\nMy phone, but more for camera and map purposes (I appreciate that Google Maps allows you to see where you are on a map without using WIFi or data – super useful when trying to find which direction you need to go.\n\nWhat can readers find on your blog?\n\nAn interesting mix of travel, lifestyle and opinion pieces, and some LGBT stuff thrown in and if you go back a few years tonnes about our wedding, What we Love Wednesdays and Fun Fact Fridays posts. We started our blog 5 years ago to share our experiences with Laura’s faraway family but since then it has grown into a storybook of our life.\n\nTo find more from Sarah get clicking on these links.\n\nBlog\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nPin for later\n\nIf you visit New Zealand it’s almost criminal if you don’t experience the Geothermal wonders this beautiful country has to offer and the home of geothermal activity is Rotorua. Bubbling mud pools, a thick smell of sulphur in the air, Geysers shooting up in the sky and some of the most out of this world landscapes you could ever imagine.\n\nWhile we were in Rotorua we visited two Geothermal ‘theme’ parks Waiotapu Thermal Wonderland and Te Puia. I’ve previously posted about Waiotapu and you can find it here. I’m glad we made it to both of them as they had such different offerings.\n\nTe Puia was slightly different to Waiotapu as it had not only a greater number of geysers but more active geysers. It was also hugely informative about New Zealand’s Maori culture, architecture and even had some Kiwi Birds so you had the chance to get up close to the native wildlife.\n\nWhat you need to see while you are there..\n\nPōhutu Geyser\n\nThis was the first geyser we saw on our trip and it was truly spectacular. The natural world really is so intriguing sometimes. It is also the largest active geyser in the Southern Hemisphere and can erupt up to at least 2 times every hour. You would have to be really unlucky to go and see it and not see it erupt. Fun fact its name means ‘constant splashing’ which is exactly what it does. Whether you are up close or standing on a platform on the other side of the park the plume of water and steam really does make you stop and watch.\n\nTe Tohu geyser\n\nTe Tohu is located next to Pohutu and erupts just before Pohutu does. Another name for this geyser is Prince of Wales Feather as its plume was said to resemble the Prince’s coat of arms. Seeing the two geysers going off is a glorious sight. They are said to only erupt for a few minutes at a time but due to the frequency of their eruptions, it feels like they have a continuous plume of water and steam.\n\nDormant Geysers\n\nThere is at least two dormant geyser at the park. Papakura and Te Horu. They both used to erupt frequently however they have been considered dormant now since the 70’s. There are signposted showing where you can see them and maybe they will spring back to life in the future. Te Horu has been said to be bubbling at the moment but eruptions so far.\n\nNgāraratuatara\n\nThis is a cooking pool which they still use to this day. In the past, these types of pools would be used for not only cooking but also washing and bathing. I’m guessing it is like an ancient hot tub but I’m pretty sure the water would be a whole lot hotter than a modern day hot tub. Just imagine the wrinkles if you stayed in too long! At Te Puia, you can sample this unique cooking experience along with another traditional Maori cooking style called a hangi. The Hangi is a large pit in the earth with the hot rocks placed at the bottom. The geothermal heat in both of these methods cooks the meat and infuses the food with a unique flavour and how often can you say you’ve eaten food cooked by geothermal heat.\n\nSee a Kiwi up close\n\nDisappointingly we didn’t get to see a kiwi in the flesh as they were all either sleeping or hiding when we were visiting. However, we did buy a soft toy Kiwi if that counts. They have a big enclosure with natural trees and plants for the Kiwis to feel at home. The kiwi egg is also HUGE! So was really interesting to see one of these on display. It would have been amazing to have seen one but as we didn’t it’s another reason for us to return to NZ one day soon.\n\nMaori Buildings and Carvings\n\nThere are lots of traditional Maori buildings on the site in the Pikirangi Village for you to walk around, go into and explore. Being able to touch the building and see the materials used, and the intricate carving was a real insight into the past. Such pride was taken in decorating these buildings and it’s such a different style of building from what I’ve seen before.\n\nAlong with this village of the past, there is also more modern buildings which are used for concerts and gatherings. We did get to see a performance which was fascinating to watch. At first, I thought they were doing the haka but I think it may have been a slightly different welcome call. Either way, it was amazing to watch!\n\nThere is also lots of carved statues and artwork dotted around the park. Like the house’s they are carved with such amazing detail.\n\nWe went into the park on a standard day ticket and spent a day marvelling at this interesting place. There is also a whole host of different experience options that you could opt for both during the day and in the evening. One of these experiences includes a meal cooked within a Hangi and hot pool. It was easy to walk around on your own (without a tour guide) and the points of interest within the park are all signposted with information. It is a big park so expect to do a lot of walking and whilst the paths are all easily accessible it’s sensible to wear decent shoes.\n\nWe loved visiting this place and couldn’t recommend it enough if you are visiting New Zealand. The insight into Maori history, the dramatic landscapes and captivating geysers is something we would never have been able to see anywhere else and is so far removed from the green fields of our home in Britain and the dry paddocks of our Australian home.\n\nIt really will leave you in awe of the natural world.\n\nTo find more information on Te Puia you can find details here http://www.tepuia.com/\n\nIf you wanted to see some of our other posts from New Zealand the click away below\n\nMartha Mine\n\nGlowworm Caves\n\nWaiotapu\n\nWaiheke\n\nAuckland\n\nWant to pin this post for later..\n\nImagine being able to give up the daily grind and head off travelling with your other half, well that is exactly Vicky and Thomas from The Wander of Two have done. Lucky sods. I’m always in awe when people do this. It must be so amazing, experiencing new places, new sights, new smells and a newly found appreciation of the world with your best friend.\n\nTheir blog is full of travel guides from Chester to Cape Town to Thailand and many places in between, hints and tips travelling as a couple and go pro videos to make you feel like you are right there. I love the mix of stories, videos, facts and tips its such a great mix and everything you need to get you in the wanderlust mood. One of my favourite posts was this one https://thewanderoftwo.com/2017/05/03/survival-guide-to-travelling-with-your-other-half/ . It’s so true about whilst it’s brilliant to be with each other you also need your own time and that compromises have to happen just like they would at home.\n\nTheir Instagram page shows they are currently on route to Vietnam and I cant’ wait to see what they get up to next. Vietnam has long been on my list so hoping I’ll get some top tips on places to go and things to see. If you have been dreaming about leaving the ‘normal’ world or if you like me love reading about people that do this then make sure you check out the links below to their blog and social pages. So as per every Sunday let me pass you over to this week’s Globetrotters..\n\nHi, we’re Vicky & Thomas. We are currently suffering from wanderlust so much so that we are looking to quit the 9 – 5 and fulfil our dreams of travelling full time. Originally from Cumbria we love the outdoors and exploring, we have recently started our travelling blog The Wander of Two where we will document our adventures. You can follow our journey as we travel and find out what we have been getting up to and what mishaps we have encountered along the way as we are sure there will be a few.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about travelling?\n\nWe love exploring new places, discovering beautiful sights and experiencing different cultures. Every place we visit has something magical about it and we love finding out what that is. Travelling gives you the feeling of being free, it allows you to meet other like-minded people and build friendships that will last you a lifetime.\n\nWhy do you think travelling is important?\n\nTravelling captures your soul, it opens your eyes and heart to new possibilities. We would rather see something once ourselves than hear about it a thousand times over. Travelling allows you to see the world from a new perspective and fill your life with experiences.\n\nWhat is your favourite photograph from your travels?\n\nWhich is your favourite type of travel/holiday- sun, snow, sea, city, mountains, country?\n\nEvery one of the above. It depends on what we want at the time, sometimes we love to just chill on a beach, with the sand between our toes. Other times we enjoy trekking through the rainforests and being at one with nature. If we are really looking for adventure though we might decide to go skiing over the winter season.\n\nWho do you usually travel with?\n\nWe usually travel as a couple but the best thing about travelling is you always meet other travellers along the way.\n\nIf you were to give one piece of travel advice what would it be?\n\nWe are still quite new to travelling so we are not experienced travellers by far but if we had to give one piece of advice it would be to keep your luggage to a minimum. This is something we learnt first-hand as when we took our first trip to Thailand, Vicky packed far too much and couldn’t even carry her own bag!\n\nTell us the funniest story or a mishap from one of your adventures?\n\nWe had booked a day trip to Gibraltar and ended up getting on the wrong tour bus. Half an hour into our Journey we found out we were on the Polish speaking tour! We spent the next 3 hours on the bus to Gibraltar listening to the tour guide talk away in a language we didn’t understand as we just nodded and laughed along.\n\nWhere is your favourite place that you’ve been to?\n\nAt the moment we would both have to say Krabi in Thailand, with its stunning back drop’s and surrounding Island’s it captured our hearts. This will probably change though the more we travel.\n\nWhere was one place that didn’t live up to the hype?\n\nPersonally, we would say Koh Phi Phi. We know a lot of people love this island but for us, it wasn’t as beautiful as some of the other places we have seen and didn’t live up to our expectations.\n\nTell us one place/experience on your bucket list?\n\nThe Philippines, we have seen so many photos and vlogs which have left us wanting to visit here, it looks so magical and peaceful.\n\nWhat is the one thing you wouldn’t travel without?\n\nOur Go Pro, we invested in one of these last year and now we honestly don’t know what we would do without it. It comes on every trip with us and is so easy to use.\n\nWhat can readers find on your blog?\n\nOur blog is a mixture of travel guides and tips, how we cope travelling as a couple and stories of our adventures. Hopefully, readers will find it insightful and give them inspiration for their own journeys.\n\nTo find more from The Wander of Two please see the below\n\nBlog\n\nInstagram\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nToday it was hot in the UK. Like really hot. The late 20s /early 30s hot. The papers tomorrow will declare it a heat wave and come Monday everyone will be returning to work completely sunburnt. Then by the end of the week, it will be wet and rainy for two weeks because it’s Glastonbury weekend so of course, it’s going to be wet. I would never have known what that meant 10 years ago.\n\nWelcome to a British summer.\n\nAs an Aussie living in the UK, I find it hilarious every year how excited/crazy we get when the temperature peaks for several days straight you’d have thought I’d have I come to adapt to it. Nope! Now every year I get just as excited as everyone else. I wrote a similar post last year you can find it here.\n\nThe most surprising thing for me today was I got in my car to go to the gym (yes just popping that in there as a big pat on the back to myself) and the steering wheel was too HOT to touch!! Yes, you heard right to hot to touch. This has never happened to me here. Australia yeah sure this is a daily occurrence but never in the UK. I actually almost called my mum to tell her as I was so shocked. Thankfully I didn’t choose to wake her up at 3 am with the news and instead started to think about all the things that are different between my two homes in the summer time …\n\nEurope\n\nSummer in the UK more often than not means a summer holiday to the continent. Spain, Portugal, Italy, France are all on your doorstep and only 2-3 hours flight away. Some of the deals available make it a more cost effective option than staying in the UK and you are guaranteed sun. In Australia, you pretty much stay in Australia but maybe just venture to another state. If you did want to go abroad Bali or Fiji are only 3-4 hours away.\n\nRespect the sun vs worship the Sun\n\nI have moles on my body and have always been protective of my skin. In Australia, you are brought up respecting the sun. At school, you can’t play outside unless you have a hat and there are always campaigns about Slip, Slop, Slap- Slip on a shirt, Slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat. We don’t spend all day everyday sunbathing in the sun and we have Skincare centres everywhere to check on any changes in our skin. This is so different to my friends in England who worship the sun and will sit out all day in to get some colour. Even if that colour is red. Even going on holiday in Europe you always see ‘brits abroad’ who have sunburn on sunburn but still will sit out catching the rays. In Australia, it is rare to buy sunscreen under factor 15 or 30 whereas in the UK you can get factor 4 or factor 8!!\n\nSummer is longer and hotter in Australia\n\nSummer last forever in Australia especially if you live inland or in Northern parts of the country. Every day of summer is almost guaranteed to be warm and if by chance it is cooler it’s still early 20’s. It can also get super hot so you can’t touch your steering wheel, the road looks like it is melting and God forbid if you try to sit on a leather seat.\n\nBut…Summer days are longer in the U.K.\n\nWhilst we don’t have as many hot days in the UK we do have more daylight hours. Summer evenings in the UK go up to 9.30/10pm. I love this and found it so confusing when we were on the Gold Coast last year and it was almost pitch black at 6 pm in the middle of summer. Summer days need long summer nights as well.\n\nBeaches\n\nAccording to Australia.gov.au there over 10,500 beaches in Australia. There is nowhere near that many in the UK. Whilst I love a beach wherever it is I do prefer the beaches of home. The white squeaky sand that burns the soles of your feet, crystal blue ocean and bush that always separates the beach from the rest of the world. They will always hand down beat a pebbled, muddy British beach.\n\nIce lollies/Ice creams\n\nNo ice lollies/ice creams in the UK will ever compare to a Paddle Pop, Zoopa Doopa or a Bubble-o-bill. Not ever..\n\nSummer will always feel like Christmas\n\nAs soon as it starts heating up I’m waiting for the Christmas carols, the Christmas tv and Santa to be driving round the streets on a fire truck. Summer for me means Christmas no matter how many years I have away from home- this will never change.\n\nRain\n\nObviously, rain was going to pop up somewhere in this post. However, it might not be in the way you would expect. In the UK we hate it raining when its supposed to be summer and in Australia, they long for it to rain in summer. Summers in Australia are long and hot. Summer heat on top of a long-standing drought affects crops, farms, bush and the general landscape. We have bushfires every year and part of the reason they spread so quickly is that everything is so dry and crisp. My grandpa always asks me to bring the rain with me when I come home at summer.\n\nGreen vs Beige\n\nLeading on from the above, I have lost count how many times this last month I have said to my other half ‘It’s soo green! It’s never this green at home in the summer’. This is partly due to the rainfall we have. Everything grows so quickly. We didn’t mow our lawn for a month and it looked like a meadow. The countryside in the UK during the summer is beautiful luscious greens, bluebell forests, yellow rapeseed fields and wildflowers on the side of the road. Just beautiful.\n\nSport\n\nBig on both sides of the equator in the summer. Wimbledon, The Australian Open, Boxing day test the list is endless. Both nations love watching sports and getting out and being active in the sunny days.\n\nAnimals\n\nI grew up in the country and going for a walk in summer meant you always needed to keep an eye out for snakes and your back is always covered in flies. Going for a walk in the UK just means midgies and that’s only if you are near water. Its pretty much a snake free zone and is 100% a fly free zone. The UK wins purely for just not having flies!\n\nShirts off at the pub\n\nI don’t think I have ever seen Aussie men at the pub with their shirts off in the summer. In England, one little slither of sun and half the men are there with their tops off showing off their Adonis bodies. Most places in Aus will have a no shirt no service rule and we love a drink so the shirts stay on. We are more a nation of vest/singlets, baordy and thong (flips flop) wearing men than a rip your top off at the first sign of sun nation.\n\nHappiness\n\nOne thing that remains the same in both places is that summer = happy. Everyone has a spring in their step, more social and just happier. The vitamin D does something magical to us all. We smile, we play, we eat alfresco, we relish the days spent outside.\n\nSummertime is great not matter what side of the world you are on. There will always be good and less good points no matter where you are. You just need to get our and enjoy it.\n\nWhat is your favourite thing about summer? Have you experienced summer in two countries that are different? I’d love to hear from you so let me know in the comments below.\n\nMelbourne is my favourite city in Australia. Always has been always will be. It feels less touristy than Sydney, buzzier than Canberra, bigger than Brisbane and then I’ve not visited the other capital cities so sadly can’t validate my love for Melbourne against them. But I’m pretty sure Melbourne would always win.\n\nGrowing up in a VERY small country town I loved when we would go to Melbourne in the summers. We’d go to the Australian Open and MCG, shop in ‘cool’ shops, eat out in fancy restaurants, wander along the Yarra, travel by tram, shop the at the Queen Vic markets, marvel at the Crown Casino decorations and spend far to much time getting myself lost in the captivating Melbourne side streets. One suburb of Melbourne we would always visit and still always visit is St Kilda. A trip to Melbourne isn’t complete without it.\n\nSt Kilda is around 5kms out of the city centre and is easily reached by tram or bus. It’s on the coast so if you are feeling brave you can even go swimming in the crisp Port Philip Bay water. There are key points of interest there as well as the amazing cafe culture that will keep you feed and watered on your adventures around Melbourne. The boutique and vintage shops offer a great shopping experience and the beach and pier just help to slow down the pace of the city life. With the beach, esplanade and parks there is plenty of places to get active on and off the water. We once stayed just off the esplanade and with my new roller blades I decided that was the only way I was going to get around. This was of course back when roller blades were cool. If you grew up in the 90s in Australia you would also know St Kilda frequented heavily in The Secret Life of Us. I LOVED this show and alway used to wander part the Espie Hotel imagining I was in the show hanging out with Deborah Mailman. Yes 16 year old, rollerblading me was soo cool.\n\nAlas, I digress. I love St Kilda a lot it’s my favourite suburb in my favourite city so here are my 7 favourite things to do in St Kilda\n\n1)St Kilda Beach & Sea Baths\n\nThis is the most famous beach in Melbourne and whilst Melbourne doesn’t always get the warmest of weather all year round you can swim in the beach year round. But you may freeze. There is also the sea baths located just off the beach which have the history of the area and pier shown through pictures so you can see it back in its heyday. There are lots of activities available both on water and land by the beach from windsurfing to beach volleyball and as you can imagine it’s a hugely popular with locals and tourists alike enjoying the beach lifestyle\n\n2)St Kilda Pier\n\nYou can’t to St Kilda and not walk along the historic Edwardian pier. You really can’t. The pier was built in the 1850’s and is cloaked in history. It also feels very British- the Brits do love a pier and you can tell from the piers of Britain were a good influence on this build. There is a kiosk at the end of the pier which is a lovely spot for a cuppa and cake. There is also a colony of penguins at the breakwater but they aren’t always out to play so you could be lucky in seeing them. Visiting this pier is just a lovely change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\n3)The Melbourne SkyLine\n\nI love a city skyline and standing out on the pier looking back over the city you get a gorgeous panoramic view of the Melbourne Skyline. I don’t think there is anywhere else in the city you would get views like this. It’s also particularly beautiful at sunset so have an early evening stroll along the pier and look back over this striking city.\n\n4)Luna Park\n\nThe big (slightly creepy) smiling face of Luna Park is a firm favourite in St Kilda and Melbourne alike. It’s been there since 1912 and is one of two Luna Parks operating in Australia (the other being in Sydney just under the Harbour Bridge). It doesn’t cost anything to go in and walk around but if you did want to go on any of the rides there is a charge. I’m not one for roller coasters ( I’m a bit of a scardey cat) but I do love walking around the park. It’s all very old world theme park with street performers, funny mirrors and old school games. https://lunapark.com.au/\n\n5)Acland Street & Fitzroy Street\n\nFood and drink in St Kilda is amazing! From the restaurants with all cuisines covered, bohemian/hipsta bars, trendy cafes and coffee shops to the bakeries stocked with the most lust-worthy cakes and sweet treats. I get about 10 pounds heavier just looking at the menus and shop windows in these streets.\n\n6) Esplanade Markets\n\nWe always try and get to St Kilda on a Sunday to see these iconic markets. They are full of wonderfully creative items and you can always pick up some real gems for presents and souvenirs. For more details on the stall holders check here http://www.stkildaesplanademarket.com.au/index.htm\n\n7)Palais Theatre\n\nI’ve sadly never been to a concert in this beautiful Art Deco theatre but I do have a huge appreciation for the facade of this grand building. Even if you don’t go in its one of those places where you need to stop and stare. Just off the ESplande and next to Luna Park it’s a beautiful juxtaposition of old world class vs the bright lights of the theme park. We also met Janelle Timmins from Neighbours circa 2007 on our neighbour’s tour there so obviously a very dear place in our hearts. Haha!\n\nHave you been to St Kilda and love it also? Anything I’ve missed off the list? Do let me know in the comments below.\n\nEmer from Emer There & Everywhere is one gutsy girl. Packing up her London life to book a one-way ticket to Asia is a huge jump. And as you’ll read below it’s one she’s never looked back on. I don’t blame her. It’s every wanderlust (actually probably every persons) ultimate dream. I love reading about people who have followed their itchy travel feet and gone in search of a long term adventure. Although technically I’ve done the same I always feel a bit of a cop out as the English culture isn’t really that dissimilar to the Aussie culture, but for Emer going from Cork to London to then Asia must have been a huge culture shock. Reading her posts and looking at her photos on Instagram she’s embraced it all and seen so many sights and experienced things that many of us only dream of. This is what life is all about. Taking risks, doing what you need to do, having fun and seeing the world.\n\nI’ve been following Emer’s adventures for some time now and one of the posts I loved of hers is this one. Two reasons why- 1) there is an AMAZING photo of the sun setting by Red Mountain Winery. Looking at this picture I feel completely transported to sitting on the hill drinking wine watching the sun set over the beautiful landscape. The atmosphere of that moment oozes out of the screen and 2) Inle lake sounds like a great place to explore. I’ve never heard of it before and is now one place I’ll be putting on my list.\n\nShe is now down in my neck of the woods at the moment, in New Zealand and I am loving her pictures on Instagram. New Zealand is a truly spectacular country and with Emer’s style of writing, it’s going to make for awesome reading when she uploads her posts. Reading her posts really feels like you are listening to a friend tell you their stories of their travels and once you know Emer is Irish just try not reading it in your head in an Irish accent. Here blog is a great find and I’m so glad I get to share it with you all.\n\nSo here is Emer from Emer There & Everywhere.\n\nI’m originally from Cork, Ireland. I’ve always loved travel, but up until this year, I mostly travelled in relatively short bursts, as I’ve been living and working in London for the past 8 years. Having saved up a bit of money over the years, last year I decided maybe it was time to look at buying a flat in London because it just seemed like the next step. Only when I got to the point of viewing places did I realise that instead of feeling excited about the whole thing, I just felt worn out and stressed. Then I worked out that maybe the answer to not feeling 100% settled where I was in life was to make a change, not dig in deeper. So, I quit my job, packed my bags and booked a one-way ticket to Singapore. Nearly 5 months later I am in New Zealand with just my backpack and I haven’t looked back!\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about travelling?\n\nI love the variety. I like always having something new to do and see, people to meet, places to go. It’s a great way of getting out of your routine and doing something different.\n\nWhy do you think travelling is important?\n\nI think travelling is something wonderful and fun you can do for yourself, which is important for everyone to do from time to time. Aside from that, I think travelling helps us to learn a bit more about the world we live in. Travel gives you a chance to see things and meet people you never would otherwise, and maybe even view and understand the world in a different way.\n\nWhat is your favourite photograph from your travels.\n\nBagan. There are so many moments I’ll never forget about this particular trip, but seeing the sunrise and the balloons over the temples of Bagan was very special. I’d been fascinated by Myanmar for a long time, and it was wonderful to be able to go there. There is something about Bagan in particular that makes me feel calm and awestruck all at once, and this photo reminds me of that feeling.\n\nWhich is your favourite type of travel/holiday- sun, snow, sea, city, mountains, country?\n\nOh, that really depends… I absolutely love the mountains – give me a map and point me in the direction of a hiking trail and I am happy. But for me, you just can’t beat being near the sea. Whether it’s sunbathing on white sands with the waves lapping on the shore, scuba diving on a coral reef, or strolling along a windy seafront, the ocean just does it for me.\n\nWho do you usually travel with?\n\nI mostly travel alone! Sometimes I travel with family or friends, but I love the freedom and flexibility that solo travel gives you. I first took a trip on my own about 5 years ago before starting a new job. I had a few weeks off, really wanted a holiday and none of my friends were free, so I just took off to Hungary, Croatia and Barcelona and had the best time. Since then I’ve taken several short trips alone, but this current trip is the longest. I’ve been travelling for just over 4 months. I’m rarely on my own for long though; I’ve met lots of great people along the way and made some friends for life.\n\nIf you were to give one piece of travel advice what would it be?\n\nTry to do as much as you can on your own steam. Tour companies make their money by taking a commission and passing on extra costs to you for organising something you can often do yourself. Also, for every agency or tour operator involved, the provider of the service gets less of the overall fee. So if you book a hike and a homestay with a tribal family from an agency, through your hostel, with pickup from a bus company, that’s three parties getting a cut before you even speak to your host family.\n\nSometimes there is no choice – e.g. If you want to climb a glacier or go diving on the Great Barrier Reef, you probably need a tour company to get you there. But, usually, there is a simpler and cheaper way for you to do it on your own, and generally, you’ll be rewarded with a more memorable, enjoyable and authentic experience.\n\nTell us the funniest story or a mishap from one of your adventures?\n\nI’ve been fortunate enough to have avoided any major mishaps or misadventures so far, thankfully. Although, I did manage to drop my phone down a toilet in a hostel in Cairns recently. I was flying to NZ that day so didn’t have much time to dry it out. I was staying with a friend in Auckland, and when I arrived she offered me a bag of rice to stick the phone into dry it out. As I attempted to do this, I managed to spill most of the bag of rice all over her kitchen counter and floor. What a dream house guest!\n\nWhere is your favourite place that you’ve been to?\n\nThat’s a really hard one. Just to pick somewhere NOT from this particular trip, I’m going to say Barcelona. It’s a city I’ve been to a few times, and I’ve always had a great time. It’s got beautiful architecture, great food, the sunshine, wine, a beach, hiking and fabulous music festivals. What more could you want?!\n\nWhere was one place that didn’t live up to the hype?\n\nI feel like your time in each place is what you make of it, and I try not to listen to the hype and just go and enjoy my time as best I can.\n\nHowever, I will say that the one place that is totally different in photos compared to reality is Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Every time you see a photo of Angkor Wat at sunrise and think what a serene and wonderful moment that must be, know that there are about 500 other people surrounding the photographer, jostling for the perfect shot.\n\nTell us one place/experience on your bucket list?\n\nNot really one place, but I’d like to spend some time travelling in South and Central America. I’ve only been to Argentina, so there’s a lot more to see! I don’t think I’ll get there on this trip, but I look forward to planning it when I get back…\n\nWhat is the one thing you wouldn’t travel without.\n\nA decent pair of running/walking shoes. I walk a lot when I’m travelling, and I try to get out for a run from time to time too. I find it’s a great way of keeping fit for free while travelling. Oh and a face cream with a high SPF.\n\nWhat can readers find on your blog?\n\nIt’s a personal account of my travels so far, with plenty of pictures and tips along the way. As a solo traveller, I think a lot of the posts will probably resonate most with people travelling alone, or thinking about it, but hopefully here’s something for anyone with a bit of wanderlust.\n\nTo find more from Emer please check the links below\n\nBlog\n\nIG\n\nTwitter\n\nThe world is a challenging place at the moment. Whilst terrorism is not new it is becoming more and more prevalent in our lives. My first awareness of terrorism was September 11. I remember being so naive in thinking it was an accident and that people wouldn’t want to cause that level of harm. Now though, there is barely a month that goes by without an attack or incident somewhere in the world and everyone is doing their best to stay strong, not to be afraid and not to let the terrorists win. But it’s hard.\n\nI woke up to a group text message from my best friends at home in Australia saying ‘ok, ok enough is enough. I think you should come home now to live’\n\nI know it was out of care and love but I replied that I wasn’t going to live in fear and move home because some shitty people have acted in an inhumane way. If we are afraid, if we are angry, if we change our lives based on their behaviour then they have won and I will not let that happen.\n\nI spent the morning watching the news unfold about the attack in London last night, interviews, footage from phones and powerful people from all over the world condem the actions of these terrible people and praise the stories of heroics. Not superheroes but people from the general public standing up and helping, caring, showing love for people they have never met. The speed at which the police acted and their bravery of running into the action when most people run away from it. I’ve then spent this evening watching the outpouring of strength, togetherness and love at the One Love concert in Manchester. Most of the people in the audience had been at the Manchester bombing, They had experienced the fear first hand, they maybe have been recovering from their injuries, they most likely know someone who was injured or worse had their life taken but they still came out to show their love and support for their city and the victims.\n\nThere was some brilliant artists performing but one song really stuck out for me. The Black Eyed Peas came out and sang Where is the Love and listening to the words (and then googling them to make sure I heard right) they are just as relevant now as they were back in 2003.\n\n‘Yo’, whatever happened to the values of humanity\n\nWhatever happened to the fairness and equality\n\nInstead of spreading love we’re spreading animosity\n\nLack of understanding, leading us away from unity’\n\n‘But if you only have love for your own race\n\nThen you only leave space to discriminate\n\nAnd to discriminate only generates hate\n\nAnd when you hate then you’re bound to get irate, yeah’\n\nIt’s scary that words written in 2003 are still so appropriate some 14 years later and scarily enough maybe still relevant in another 14 years.\n\nThis isn’t something we’ll solve alone, we need to do it together. I always believe that love will beat hate. Yes, I appreciate this sounds a little idealistic but let’s leave the political issues to the politicians, the crime fighting to the amazing police and armies across the world whose sole job is to protect the general public, the healing and rehabilitation to the doctors and nurses. What we can do ourselves is not share stupid memes/facebook rants, not turn our hurt to anger and misdirect it at a whole religion instead of the radicalised ones, not change our daily habits, keep doing the things we love, go to concerts, travel, go out for dinner and drinks, visit tourist areas or just get on plane to travel the world. I for one refuse to be scared. We’ve all only got a short time on this beautiful planet and I’m not going to let these misdirected people ruin it for me.\n\nThe more they try to pull us apart the more we need to stick together. The more destruction they cause the more courage we need to show. The more they try to hurt us the more love we need to give.\n\nWe will not let them win.\n\nWe need to spread the love like wildflowers.\n\nFull lyrics of Where is the Love if you are interested\n\nWhat’s wrong with the world, mama\n\nPeople livin’ like they ain’t got no mamas\n\nI think the whole world addicted to the drama\n\nOnly attracted to things that’ll bring you trauma\n\nOverseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism\n\nBut we still got terrorists here livin’\n\nIn the USA, the big CIA\n\nThe Bloods and The Crips and the KKK\n\nBut if you only have love for your own race\n\nThen you only leave space to discriminate\n\nAnd to discriminate only generates hate\n\nAnd when you hate then you’re bound to get irate, yeah\n\nMadness is what you demonstrate\n\nAnd that’s exactly how anger works and operates\n\nMan, you gotta have love just to set it straight\n\nTake control of your mind and meditate\n\nLet your soul gravitate to the love, y’all, y’all\n\nPeople killin’, people dyin’\n\nChildren hurt and you hear them cryin’\n\nCan you practice what you preach?\n\nOr would you turn the other cheek?\n\nFather, Father, Father help us\n\nSend some guidance from above\n\n‘Cause people got me, got me questionin’\n\nWhere is the love (Love)\n\nWhere is the love (The love)\n\nWhere is the love (The love)\n\nWhere is the love, the love, the love\n\nIt just ain’t the same, old ways have changed\n\nNew days are strange, is the world insane?\n\nIf love and peace are so strong\n\nWhy are there pieces of love that don’t belong?\n\nNations droppin’ bombs\n\nChemical gasses fillin’ lungs of little ones\n\nWith ongoin’ sufferin’ as the youth die young\n\nSo ask yourself is the lovin’ really gone\n\nSo I could ask myself really what is goin’ wrong\n\nIn this world that we livin’ in people keep on givin’ in\n\nMakin’ wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends\n\nNot respectin’ each other, deny thy brother\n\nA war is goin’ on but the reason’s undercover\n\nThe truth is kept secret, it’s swept under the rug\n\nIf you never know truth then you never know love\n\nWhere’s the love, y’all, come on (I don’t know)\n\nWhere’s the truth, y’all, come on (I don’t know)\n\nWhere’s the love, y’all\n\nPeople killin’, people dyin’\n\nChildren hurt and you hear them cryin’\n\nCan you practice what you preach?\n\nOr would you turn the other cheek?\n\nFather, Father, Father help us\n\nSend some guidance from above\n\n‘Cause people got me, got me questionin’\n\nWhere is the love (Love)\n\nWhere is the love (The love)?\n\nWhere is the love (The love)?\n\nWhere is the love (The love)?\n\nWhere is the love (The love)?\n\nWhere is the love (The love)?\n\nWhere is the love (The love)?\n\nWhere is the love, the love, the love?\n\nI feel the weight of the world on my shoulder\n\nAs I’m gettin’ older, y’all, people gets colder\n\nMost of us only care about money makin’\n\nSelfishness got us followin’ the wrong direction\n\nWrong information always shown by the media\n\nNegative images is the main criteria\n\nInfecting the young minds faster than bacteria\n\nKids wanna act like what they see in the cinema\n\nYo’, whatever happened to the values of humanity\n\nWhatever happened to the fairness and equality\n\nInstead of spreading love we’re spreading animosity\n\nLack of understanding, leading us away from unity\n\nThat’s the reason why sometimes I’m feelin’ under\n\nThat’s the reason why sometimes I’m feelin’ down\n\nThere’s no wonder why sometimes I’m feelin’ under\n\nGotta keep my faith alive ’til love is found\n\nNow ask yourself\n\nWhere is the love?\n\nWhere is the love?\n\nWhere is the love?\n\nWhere is the love?\n\nFather, Father, Father, help us\n\nSend some guidance from above\n\n‘Cause people got me, got me questionin’\n\nWhere is the love?\n\nSing with me y’all:\n\nOne world, one world (We only got)\n\nOne world, one world (That’s all we got)\n\nOne world, one world\n\nAnd something’s wrong with it (Yeah)\n\nSomething’s wrong with it (Yeah)\n\nSomething’s wrong with the wo-wo-world, yeah\n\nWe only got\n\n(One world, one world)\n\nThat’s all we got\n\n(One world, one world)\n\nAnyone who describes landing in a new destination like a child under a Christmas tree waiting to unwrap presents is a kindred spirit in my eyes. It’s possibly the best way I’ve heard the excitement of visiting somewhere new explained!\n\nThis weeks Globetrotter is Dody from travel and photography blog Retrato NZ. I thought I really loved photography and then I met Dody. He loves sounds just obsessed as I am maybe even more so. You 100% need to check out his blog, the images are outstanding.\n\nNot only does Dody have amazing photographs on his site but the blogs about his personal travels are full of wondrous words and wanderlust-inducing images. I’ve always wanted to see the wildlife and landscapes of Africa and whilst I’ve not quite got there this post is pushing me to book a trip. I absolute adore the ‘watercooler Giraffe chat’ photograph. Seeing those animals in their natural habitat going about their business must have been spine tingly awesome.\n\nI’ve loved reading about Dody’s thoughts on travel and photography and I am sure you will too. The passion for travel and photography jumps out of the screen and it’s infectious. I adore that he doesn’t have a favourite place and that there is nowhere that hasn’t lived up to the hype as he’s just immersed himself into every place and experience.\n\nLet me pass you over to Dody from Retrato NZ and as usual, I’ve included links below so once you’ve had a taster you can check out more. Dody likes to spend more time behind the camera than in front so his bio pic seems extremely appropriate\n\nI like my photos to be as uncomplicated as my subjects. Except for very minimal adjustments, I don’t enhance my images in any way. Preferring to make use of available light (no flash) and the basic rules of composition sans any photo-enhancing software, my resulting portraits capture my subjects in unguarded moments, their personalities pixelated for eternity.\n\nMy love of photography was influenced by photo essays in books and magazines I read as a child. I daydreamed of far-off lands and exotic cultures, hoping to document them through a camera someday. I want to capture people and places as my eyes see them, without ‘rose-tinted glasses’. Doing this means I have to think fast sometimes – evaluate light, or stoop, crouch, or bend in the most uncomfortable way to get the right composition. I like doing all the work before I click the shutter, not after.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about travelling?\n\nWhen I’m headed to a place I’ve never been before, it’s the moment the plane begins to descend. The wonder and excitement are unreal, almost similar to when I was a child sitting under the Christmas tree and knowing that a whole new experience awaits me.\n\nWhy do you think travelling is important?\n\nTravelling is not just about visiting ancient ruins, historic places, or mega-cities. It’s about encountering foreign cultures and people, learning how they live, understanding their language. Although social media and the internet have brought people closer in a virtual sense, to me they’ve degraded travel to an ordinary and routine experience. We leave for far-off places and pose for selfies, yet come back with no significant change. The important thing about travelling is to come back with a deeper knowledge of others and of ourselves.\n\nWhat is your favourite photograph from your travels?\n\nI took this photo when I was in the Sahara Desert in Morocco last year. It’s one of my favourites not only because of the unusual combination of colours and shadows, but because this was a candid shot of a Bedouin who walked along the sand dunes barefoot, totally unaware I was taking his photo. I didn’t crop or edit this image in any way. One in a collection of photos in my photo book, my Morocco adjectives, I titled this ‘undulating’ because the desert looked to me like undulating sea waves.\n\nWhich is your favourite type of travel/holiday- sun, snow, sea, city, mountains, country?\n\nAll of the above.\n\nWho do you usually travel with?\n\nMy partner enjoys travelling as much as I do. She’s wary of mainstream tourist spots and loves off-the-beaten-track destinations. She’ll pick rainforests over cities, camping over hotels, and when it comes to food, can rival Bourdain’s courage. She’s amazing. [She insisted on answering this specific question too, so it could be exaggerated.]\n\nIf you were to give one piece of travel advice what would it be?\n\nDon’t expect too much but be open to anything that comes your way and live for the moment. I suppose you could say that of life too.\n\nTell us the funniest story or a mishap from one of your adventures?\n\nIn Botswana, I joined a 100-metre race. Those who joined were men younger than me, fit and lean. I knew I couldn’t outrun them but thought it would be fun to run alongside them. After a few strides, I fell, then I got up, then ran, then fell again. So it turned out, I didn’t run alongside, I ran behind. I finished the race though, albeit limping a bit.\n\nWhere is your favourite place that you’ve been to?\n\n‘Favourite’ means one preferred over all the others. I don’t have a favourite because every place I’ve been to is special to me.\n\nWhere was one place that didn’t live up to the hype?\n\nI always immerse myself in a place, therefore to me, it always lives up to the hype.\n\nTell us one place/experience on your bucket list?\n\nAntarctica. It’s the only continent I haven’t been to. I dream of lying in the snow watching the aurora.\n\nWhat is the one thing you wouldn’t travel without?\n\nMy camera. And my lovely partner. [She typed that last bit.]\n\nWhat can readers find on your blog?\n\nIt’s about my travel experiences and a collection of my photos from these travels. I try to narrow the focus of my posts so that each piece is specific to my own experience. For example, I wrote about the Paekakariki trail here in Wellington, a little narrow 10-km path that I took despite my fear of heights. It’s vertigo-inducing, but I made it.\n\nTo find more please check out the below links\n\nBlog\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nWhen I left Australia in 2006 there was no Facebook. Yes NO FACEBOOK! No, Twitter, No Instagram, no Pinterest, no snapchat. Well, they may have been in existence in the US but it was early days. I don’t even think smartphones were a thing. Pretty sure we were all still rocking the flip phones.\n\nGosh, I sound really old.\n\nI remember New Years Eve 2006 my friends were talking about this new website which was coming to England and It was set to be better than Myspace. That you could upload photos to, find friends (but better than friends reunited which let’s be honest wouldn’t be hard) and to send messages to friends over the internet with no charge. There wasn’t even an app it was just a website. I also remember when I first signed up and no one I knew in Australia was on it. I remember wondering if it would even catch on.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot recently just how different living away from my family was only 11 years ago to how it is now. Which in itself has had drastic changes. Then I was thinking about when my parents moved our family to England in 1992 and just how different and hard it was for them. The world has changed a lot in 25 years!\n\nFor me, in 2006 I probably spoke to my parents on the phone (always on a landline!) once a month as it was extremely expensive to call. I would have emailed a few times a month but would be completely out of the loop as to what was going on at home with the family or with friends. I wouldn’t see pictures of my family as again picture messages were very expensive and it was just a bit difficult to get photos from a camera to a computer to then email. Even sending an email I would need to go to the library to use the internet there. I always felt quite disconnected with the goings on at home and it made it really tough emotionally. I always would get jealous of my friends who would go home to see their parents at the weekend and I wanted Australia to be just that little bit closer so I could pop home for a weekend break.\n\nIn 1992 my parents must have felt like they were on the other side of the universe rather than on the other side of the world. The contact with their parents, friends and family was few and far between. International phone calls cost the same as a small car, there was no Skype, cameras still primarily used film, mobile phones were still bricks and could only keep 10 text messages at a time and you were charged by the number of letters. Areograms were written and received often, postcards of all the places we went were sent back and took like a month to get there. Nothing was instant. To get information on either side of the globe took time and for that year they were only able to get snippets from back home. For all the amazing experiences they had they couldn’t really share them with their parents or if they were missing home they just had to suck it up and wait till they were back on Aussie soil. They wouldn’t have even been able to see their own parents faces for a whole year!\n\nFast Forward 25 years and now I can face time and speak to my parents face to face and even better I can feel like I’ve been home (especially when my parents walk me around the house or perch the iPad up at the breakfast table like I’m there in the flesh), I have a group chat group with my parents and sisters and with my besties so we can share the goings on in our lives as it happens. I can be on the other side of the world and still feel like I’m only an hour down the road from them. I couldn’t tell you the last time I wrote a letter or postcard home but I could tell you where in Tasmania my mum has just been, through her Instagram and blog or i could tell you what my sister did after she finished work today. I can keep up with their fitness through runkeeper, I can see what my sister is planning for her wedding from her Pinterest board and I can know town gossip at the same time if not before my mum knows. It really has made those thousands of miles in between us seem so much smaller.\n\nIt’s not only changed keeping in touch with home but it’s also hugely changed how I view travel. I can now go on a website and find the best flights for my travels and not rely on a travel agent. I can stay in someone’s home on Airbnb rather than a hotel room. If I am going somewhere new I can look on Instagram to see what it looks like or the best places to visit. I can get a guide of what to see in any given country from Pinterest. We can read reviews on trip advisors or learn from other people through their blogs about their experiences and the good, bad and the ugly parts of destinations. We can get annoyed at the Begpackers on social media asking people to pay for their ‘journey of self-discovery’ , we can tag ourselves into places on facebook to show just how fabulous and awesome our travels are. I mean can you imagine how only 10 years ago we couldn’t upload the standard ‘my Monday is better than yours’ status update accompanied with a picture of a beach or beautiful view. The horror! We get an endless supply of wanderlust worthy travel photos on Instagram and that those hidden gems of destinations are just not as hidden as they once were. It’s opened up the world both for the good and the bad.\n\nI’ve read about how social media can make people actually more lonely than if they were interacting with ‘real’ in the flesh people. One website even said this was higher in expats as they are in a new place, still making friends and getting used to adjustment and changes in their life. I can see how this could be true especially if you don’t know ANYONE or if there is a language barrier but I’ve never felt like that. If anything it’s given me a greater connection with home which has allowed me to interact more in my day to day life as I’m not sat around missing home. I used to get massive FOMO as I never really knew what was happening at home whereas, with technology and social media the way it now it feels like I’m closer to home, I can get involved in family activities by face timing, social media or just a simple WhatsApp message. I’ve met and maintained new relationships and I’ve had friends in similar situation help me through the tough parts of living abroad as they have done it themselves. So whilst I agree the rise of social media and new technology does have its negatives and downfalls I’d much rather have it as it is now than what it was like in 1992 or even 2006.\n\nI can’t even begin to imagine what it will be like in another 10 years. I’m hoping for teleportation pods but we’ll see…..\n\nHave you noticed how social media and technology has changed for you either travelling or living abroad? Would love to hear your thoughts!\n\nLike me? Wanna pin me?"
