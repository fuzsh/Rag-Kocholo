It has been nothing short of life-changing.Choosing to invest in sleep training for our daughter has been the best decision we've ever made. Witnessing her joy and playfulness during wake windows is priceless, and the newfound time my husband and I have for each other, friends, and family is beyond amazing.Pam's expertise is unparalleled. She tailored a sleep plan specifically for us, and her availability and genuine passion for what she does make her an absolute gem. The one-on-one sessions were invaluable, and daily feedback provided the confidence and capability we needed.Since completing the training, our baby girl goes to sleep easily! The gentle and kind approach felt loving. It's as if we've given our daughter the gift of sleep that will benefit her for a lifetime. Pam has not only transformed our daughter's sleep patterns but has given us the gifts of date nights, more time, and eradicated nap time and bedtime anxieties.I wholeheartedly recommend Pam's teaching to anyone seeking a positive, effective, and loving approach to sleep training. Thank you, Pam, for making our lives immeasurably better!Gratefully,Dana, Nick and baby Alex\n\nCarly O.\n\nWith so many professionals cautioning us about “sleep training” before the age of 5 months, I was skeptical about starting so early with the Newborn Package. But with my husband returning back to work out of town, we decided take a leap of faith and get started with Pam when our daughter was 5 weeks old. Let me tell you…it was the best investment we have made! As first-time parents, Pam helped navigate us through the newborn stage by implementing gentle sleep habits for our daughter. Pam’s newborn approach still allows you to feed on demand, but provides you with a plan and routines for establishing good sleep habits for your baby. We immediately had success after getting started; our daughter was sleeping for longer stretches throughout the night. Before she was four months old, she was sleeping for 12+ straight hours in her crib, in her own room and we had ditched the pacifier! She was putting herself to sleep on her own both at night and for naps. Having a plan and Pam as our confidant was crucial to our daughter learning the skill of sleep - and also helped keep our minds at ease. I highly recommend Pam and that you consider getting started sooner rather than later - you won’t regret it. You cannot put a price on the gift of good sleep for everyone in your home!\n\nLeanne N.\n\nI am 5 months out from starting our now 9 month old's sleep training journey with Pam Nease, and in the process of preparing for daylight savings time with...\n\nCarly O.\n\nA must have for all parents!\n\nBrittany O.\n\nWould you recommend my services to another family? I would absolutely recomment Pam's services to another family! She was vital in helping Charlie learn healthy sleep habits. I have so many friends of 3 1/2 month olds who are still waking up multiple times a night to feed and their sleep being so inconsistent. By 2 1/2 months, Charlie was a super sleeper and 95% of the time only waking up once a night to feed! She's given us a ton of direction and help on helping him establish nap routines/schedules as well that we are working to conquor and I know with time we will!What would you say about teaching your newborn to sleep? It is definitely a process and every baby is different. But Pam has dealt with so many different situations that no matter what questions I had, she always had tailored answers to help Charlie establish great sleeping habits.How would you describe it to Jackie? Or your brother? Or a stranger on the street? I would describe her services as a must especially for first time parents who don't know what they're doing. I have no idea where I would be right now without her help and guidance. Definitely not where I am now. Hiring Pam was the best decision we could have made for our baby.What can I do to improve for the next client? Nothing! Pam was a god-send!!!\n\nFrancesca V.\n\nI worked with Pam with my first baby for sleep training. The experience was easy and beyond helpful from the first phone call to the last. She really cares about helping each and every child (and parents) she comes across. Her passion for the importance of sleep and teaching this skill has not only helped my baby sleep through the night, but has also taught me how beneficial and important it is. 10/10 recommend for anyone who is having trouble with a sleeping baby or wants the knowledge on the magic of sleep!\n\nAnna M.\n\nMoms and dads- if you have any doubts on whether the investment in Pam is worth it, it is ABSOLUTELY worth it. We desperately needed help with my 2 year old. She slept in our bed, required a bottle at bedtime and in the morning, and was very attached to her pacifier. In one night, after following all of Pam’s instructions and guidance to prepare for that evening, my daughter slept alone in her crib with no soothers! We were in complete disbelief. She had NEVER slept in her crib before and never slept without any soothers. Over the course of a couple of weeks, our two year old who would barely allow me to leave the bed to use the bathroom, was sleeping independently like a big girl. We did have some rough nights here and there when my daughter tried to test us, but Pam was so supportive and helped tweak our sleep plan as necessary. She even provided step by step guidance when we had a Disney trip planned in just the beginning weeks of sleep training. Thanks to Pam, our trip didn’t even phase my daughter and we did not have to deal with the re-training backlash I so very much dreaded. My daughter is in bed by 7 and my husband and I have regained our evenings. This has been invaluable. We can’t thank her enough. If you stick to the plan and follow her lead, I promise you will wish you called Pam sooner.\n\nSpirered\n\nFive Stars!!!! Pam is not only a professional, but she is deeply personable and has comfort and concern attuned to the needs and wants of your baby. Our lil guy would only sleep on our chests for the first 4 months. Yelled everytime he laid him on his back. We trusted the process and now he is a supersleeper. Orion now has 12 hr night 🌙 sleeps without crying, and we can finally rest at night. And he is also napping throughout the day. We noticed a great improvement in his attitude and he can sleep in his own crib and room without us. All this to say that the program and Pam's sleep method is totally worth the time and the money! Invest in sleep training, it definitely gave us ability as parents to rest easily again instead of being up all night with him. Also Pam never leaves you in the dark, her check ups, calls, and emails give you the support you need to change your baby's life for the better. Don't waste anymore time, Pam Nease Sleep is the way to go.\n\nCarrie W.\n\nLiterally life changing. My six month old baby was waking every 90 minutes at night, for six weeks straight. I was going crazy. Our first night sleep training, he woke three times. On the second night he slept for 10 hours straight. I cannot recommend Pam Nease Sleep enough. I always say it is the best money I’ve ever spent! I used all of the practices on my second baby and she is an even better sleeper than my first!\n\nFarhad Y.\n\nTo be honest, if anybody would have told me that our son would be able to sleep for more than 5 hrs continuously at night, I would not have believed them 2 months ago. I thought maybe other babies can do that, but not our son. He used to wake up every 30 mins to 1 hr from month 3 to month 9. I thought this is how he will forever be (or at least until he is 2 yrs old according to some friends). My hope with sleep training was to reduce the number of our wakings at night from more than 10 to less than 3. However, with Pam's help, we are now at zero waking at night and he goes to sleep without crying most of the time...This is unbelievable!!! He is also a lot more content during the days. I think the past 2 months with the sleep training has been transformational for all of us in so many ways! He trusts himself/us more and we trust him more! We were very nervous when we started this process. It took us a few weeks to finally say yes. We also questioned it several times during the first week (but we stuck with the plan). We all cried several times. However, I think we made the right decision to do this for our family and I am so happy that we decided to do this with the help of someone so passionate, knowledgeable, and caring! Thank you Pam for changing our lives. I am known for having high expectations from people who I have hired before. Pam, you are the first person who surpassed my expectations by far. I would happily and strongly recommend you to anybody who wants to go through this process.\n\njessica K.\n\nHey Pam, thanks for changing our lives.I only wish we had reached out sooner.Your work makes dreams happen for babies and dreams come true for parents.\n\nSeanna L.\n\nWhen I started looking for a sleep trainer I honestly felt slightly discouraged and unsure if it was going to be the right choice for my family. I knew I wanted to sleep train our son but didn’t feel like I was hearing confidant information on how it can be done. I talked to multiple sleep consultants and just kept hearing “wellll we could try a few different methods” and “it might take a while to ween out the night feeds.” Until I spoke with Pam. Right away she made me feel so comfortable, and told me our goals for our sons sleep were absolutely achievable in 3 nights or less. Pam took the time to get to know our family and on our first call I could see her jotting down little things about us (like our dogs name) because to Pam, the little things matter! She wants you to feel 100% comfortable with her so you can feel confident when you start the journey to better sleep together! Pam has invested so much time and effort into her company, and truly wants to help families get full nights of sleep.My only regret is not finding her sooner - and I can’t wait to try her newborn program with our second baby some day!\n\nMichael B.\n\nLife changing! Within days of starting to work with the Pam Nease team, our 10 month old was sleeping longer (which meant we slept longer!) and had transitioned off her soother. Now that my child is 3, we still benefit from the skills we learned, as she is still sleeping through the night.\n\nAmy P.\n\nHuge thank you to Pam and her staff of sleep angels! We had the pleasure of having Pam herself and then Jessica with our second baby. Was such a relief having someone to coach us through the process offering support and advice! We have two super sleepers and thank them for helping us teach the skill of sleep for our babies. Will continue to refer Pam Nease to anyone interested ❤️\n\nAlannah H.\n\nWe have used Pam's sleep training method twice - for both of our sons. It really works! We started sleep training when each of our sons was around 4-5 months and almost instantly, our sleep (and sanity!) turned around. Our sons were sleeping through the night within 5 days and their naps improved soon after as well. When there were some bumps in the road Pam and her team were also quick to respond and help us. Overall we cannot imagine our lives without having done this training - we still get compliments on how our 2 year old is an amazing sleeper. Thank you Pam!\n\nKylie S.\n\nOh, how I could go on and on and on about my experienceS with Pam. Let me start by saying that I HATE being sleep-deprived. I am not a person who functions well on little sleep. It makes me start to literally lose my mind. We first used her program with our daughter in 2019 when she was 4.5mo old. I was desperate. I reached out to some friends and said “I NEED someone to tell me how to get her to sleep and not have to give her her pacifier 15 times at night and do not tell me to let her cry it out because I won’t do that…” and someone said “call Pam Nease!” She sent me her info and I was hesitant because I thought “do I really need a coach to help me with my kid? Will it even work? It seems like a waste of money. Long story short…. It was NOT. A waste. It was LIFE-CHANGING! She was sleeping within 2 nights and was taking good naps throughout the day. Literally within 48hrs of starting the program. Fast-forward to this year. She is now 3.5yrs old and is still an incredible sleeper. Through sicknesses, teething, traveling, etc. she just SLEEPS. She’s also just a wonderful, smart, well-behaved child which we credit A LOT to her sleeping. We also now have a son! We started Pam’s program with him at 4mo of age and wouldn’t you know it! He was also sleeping *mostly* through the night within a few days as well! He was a bit more challenging than our first, but even so, we were all getting MUCH BETTER sleep within a couple of nights and just a couple of weeks into the program were getting FULL nights of sleep. We were lucky enough to work with Katrina in round 1 and Pam, herself, in round 2. We could not be any happier with our experience. Pam’s program is one of the best things we have ever done for our family. We are forever grateful and will continue to use either her or one of her amazing sleep angels with every kid we have in the future. (Also, I should note that Pam is the only reason I’m even open to having more children because i know that she will be able to help me help them to sleep hahahah. I always say that if babies came out of the womb sleeping, I would have 10. And with Pam, they pretty much do!) If youre desperate for some sleep like we were, JUST DO IT! You will NEVER regret it!!\n\nAnnick C.\n\nI don’t know what we would have done without Pam and her expertise. She helped my daughter go to sleep with ease, throughout the night, no matter if she was teething or regressing! We were up with our daughter up to five times a night for months and trying other sleep training techniques on our own. And now sleep isn't something we worry about. She also naps like a dream! We started sleep training at the same time as we were moving, and honestly, I'm so glad we didn't wait. Being a nurse and working shift work, my sleep was vital. Pam gave us tips and tricks on how to make our sleep schedule work for our life. This is hands down the best money I've ever spent. I recommend Pam to everyone I know because her help is the reason we're doing so well today!\n\nKatie M.\n\nMy experience with Pam was nothing short of life changing. When we finally agreed that we needed help, we had exhausted every other tool, from sleep training books, to rigid routines, to accepting the sleepless nights. As we exhausted all our options, we became exhausted. Our son was 20 months and hadn’t slept through the night more than a handful of times. Pam met us where we were at and created a gentle sleep plan to help our son learn to sleep through the night and in addition, she encouraged his big brother to join in the fun (they were both part of the learning as a fun game) and helped them both improve their sleep habits. It changed all of our lives and all of our kids are strong sleepers. Pam gave us tools that were gentle and we are so grateful that we can all rest better because of it.\n\nElma F.\n\nWhen you’re sleep deprived and you feel like nothing is working, don’t hesitate, talk to Pam. She will take your hand, guide you and explain how the process works. Within a few days our little one sleeping independently. We used the Masterclass and it was wonderful. Thank you Pam, your support and guidance was worth everything!\n\nDan L.\n\nHiring Pam was our last ditch effort to figure out something close to a regular sleep pattern with our son. Our 7 year old is nonverbal, autistic, and has a moderate intellectual disability. He does not understand the basic concepts of reward and punishment. He also takes several different drugs to mitigate seizures. All this means that it has been 7 years of hell trying to figure out why he won’t sleep and how we can get him to participate in a routine that does not involve waking up at all hours and making a fuss.We were very skeptical that Pam could actually help us with our intellectually disabled child, since our situation was so much different than neuro-typical kids. However, we were at the end of our rope and decided to give it a go and made sure that we followed through with all of Pam’s instructions.Pam was very positive about our chances (more positive than us!) and she gave us several techniques to try to get our son to staying in bed. We did everything she told us to do and we were amazed at the results. Several techniques worked and eventually we started to see him staying in his bed until his pre-defined wake up time. Life with our special needs child has improved dramatically. Thank you Pam!\n\nMichelle B.\n\nWe are so grateful to Pam Nease for helping our family, not just with our first child, but with our second as well. My husband and I regularly say to each other- thank goodness for Pam Nease. I don't know how other families can manage with sleepless nights for years on end. I could hardly last 3 months! Although parenting involves various other challenges, thankfully sleep is not smthg we have to think about or worry about or spend extra time fussing over. Our kids sleep great, are sharing a room, and bedtime is our favourite time of day!\n\nDarcy D.\n\nPam provided a full rundown of her process, what to expect and strategies that provided the foundation for success. Sure, some nerves on our end prior to beginning and for the first couple days but I found sleep training with our 13 month old a breeze to be honest. Her first night she woke up and cried three times (the same as she would do prior to starting Pam’s program, no big deal), then the next night NO wake ups, the following two nights had only ONE wake up and now 2 months after Pam's programs she sleeps soundly throughout the night. If she does wake-up, she has the ability to put herself back to sleep very quickly without help from mom or dad. The sleeping training process with our 13 month old made me so proud of her, watching her learn a new lifelong skill and completely change her behavior during the day. Pam’s daily follow-up phone calls were immensely helpful and comforting, answering all of our questions and providing reassurance and strategies to navigate our unique situation. Our lives are completely (read: COMPLETELY!) different, even after the first week. She’s getting sleep, we’re getting sleep and even our rescue pup is now getting a full nights rest. It has been totally life changing, thanks to Pam and efforts of baby and mom. I would recommend Pam’s services to absolutely everyone who wants a good night’s sleep and do it in a way that makes both parents feel comfortable. I loved hearing Pam’s stories of other clients and their experiences, it was comforting to know we’re not in this alone and the path to better sleep for all can be tackled with a little effort, consistency and support from an expert.\n\nLaura R.\n\nSleep training our babe with Pam Nease was honestly the best thing we ever did! Charley sleep trained at 5 months, and is still a rockstar sleeper 2 yrs later! We can travel and go places knowing that wherever we set her up, she'll have a great sleep. Plus we can't complain for a full night's sleep either!So, how did the process start? We attended a REALLY helpful seminar where Pam went through the basics. From there, we knew Pam was a great fit for us, given our values and opinions towards different methods of sleep training. It was nice to be able to get a \"Taste\" of what the process would look like before buying!Once, we decided to move forward, we went with the full on \"hold my hand\" package. No regrets here. It was awesome to message the team anytime with all our crazy questions! The process felt easy. (Especially because this is a BIG change for our little ones! There were many \"what do I do now oh gosh\" moments, so it was nice to feel supported through the crazy adjustment.)After just 10 days, Charley was sleep trained. We'll definitely be back for baby #2!\n\nMichele A.\n\nPam review:FTM mom here who works from home and had deadlines stacking up. I was in denial of needing help but got Pam's help as an amazing gift from my MiL.Now, my 6 month old has turned from a 45 min-*only in a swing after being nursed to sleep while being bounced*-napper into a 1.5-3 hr crib napper.She's now able to fall asleep independently after a short routine and can sleep for longer stretches at night, thanks to Pam's guidance and support.I feel very well equipped with the tools that have been taught to us.Pam got us through some tough nights with a lot of sympathy and encouragement. Her communication was personal, kind and practical.I would highly recommend working with Pam and her team if you're ready to commit and get yourself a predictable routine and rest back. (Get the text support, it is 👏worth 👏it if you have sleep-deprived mom brain like I did).Also, all my feeding issues got resolved after her sleep fell into place. Who would've thought?!\n\njanelle K.\n\nPam is a wonderful, very experienced sleep consultant. She speaks with confidence and a has a wealth of knowledge on the topic but most importantly, she...\n\nCrystal C.\n\nBEFORE Pam Nease Sleep : Sleep, enjoying parent hood was almost non-existent with our 4.5 month old. She would only sleep while nursing. It was draining. I would wake up shaking due to exhaustion and lack of proper sleep. My husband and I thought this was just normal part of being new mom and dad. Husband and I were on edge more, quick to snap and did not have quality time.Someone mentioned Pam Nease Sleep to us and we were skeptics even though we read all the positive reviews! But we were so desperate we tried.AFTER Pam Nease Sleep: Our baby girl sleeps so well now! We couldn’t believe it! Sleeping through the night and 2 naps a day. Our baby is growing so much better with all this needed sleep she is now getting. There is less chaos in our house due to a very cranky baby. I can sleep, dad can sleep.Working with sleep expert, Sophie was amazing. Even though it was some work and committment - Sophie made us feel at ease, and made the process fun as best as she could. We loved loved loved working with Sophie.We entered this sleep training as skeptics, and finished as believers! It works , it really really works! 100% worth it! Wish someone told me earlier!\n\nAlison R.\n\nHighly recommend. Saved our family's sleep and sanity and 7 years later, our 'baby' still sleeps like a champ, and loves bedtimes. Best money ever spent.\n\nAllison S.\n\nOur little guy was 6 months old, co-sleeping and waking every few hours in the night to breastfeed. He would only nap ON me and never for longer than 30-45mins. The fractured sleep had caught up to me and I was a shell of a human. So exhausted. Sleep training had been recommended to me to get our LO sleeping in his crib in his own room. I had SO many sleep training programs shared with me from friends and friends of friends but found it difficult to navigate them and was unsure what the right method was. I was afraid of the crying, unsure if sleep training would work for us and also so desperate to get more than a 3 hour stretch of sleep. I interviewed a few different sleep trainers and landed on Pam for many reasons but mainly my gut.Within 3 nights, our LO was sleeping through the night. Honestly, I hardly believed it myself. Naps took a little longer to come around. Pam was an incredible support for me AND my husband. She catered the program specifically to our baby and to us. She was so knowledgable, so patient, SO compassionate.Our baby is now almost 8 months old and thriving. Sleep is everything. For us as parents and for our babe. We'll be forever grateful to Pam for the gift of sleep. This was truly the best money I ever spent.THANK YOU!\n\nDavid H.\n\nWe just completed sleep training for our second baby with Pam Nease Sleep, it's been 5 weeks of life changing sleep and we couldn't have done it without Sophie our sleep consultant.Our eldest is now 5 and sleeps like a rock, we had Sophie guide us through her sleep training back in 2017, since then we''ve travelled the world and moved internationally, she hasn't missed a beat with her sleep.Sophie quickly got to the heart of what changes we needed to make, and guided us through the tough first weeks to help cement a solid sleep skill for our children. With the benefits of self soothing, and unbroken rest our little ones are growing into bright, kind happy people. Thank you Sophie! and thank you Pam Nease Sleep 🙂\n\nJenna S.\n\nOur twins were just over a year old when I found out I was expecting again. Although the thought of two toddlers and a newborn was entirely overwhelming, we held out hope that maybe the new baby would be a good sleeper... Guess what, he wasn't! We called Pam and she delivered. Her approach was compassionate, skilled, and showed us that there was light at the end of the tunnel! The value of a good night's sleep is gold, and improved the quality of every aspect of our lives at a time when we had been feeling completely out of gas.Pam is very experienced in her field, and we felt very comfortable in her capable hands. I highly recommend Pam Nease Sleep!\n\nSmitha N\n\nI have a 2.5 yr old son who co-sleeps with us as he was waking up multiple times a night for milk. I was desperately trying to find a way to stop him from waking up because that means our sleep is disrupted. While googling, I came across an article on Pam's bottle fairy technique. I read many good reviews on it too and decided to give it a try! All it took was 3 nights and now my boy sttn!!! I am so glad I gave it a shot and I'm so happy it worked! Definitely engaging Pam again for all future sleep training needs. Thanks for the article Pam!\n\nAmanda P.\n\nBefore Pam nease sleep. I didn't know what sleep was. My baby would sleep next to me in bed (he hated his crib and is high needs) and would wake up every 30 mins-1 hour all night long I was so exhausted and sleep deprived. I had tryed everything I could think of to try and get my baby to sleep and nothing was working. After talking with Pam and working with sleep angel Sophie my baby was sleeping in his crib and sleeping up to 11 hours in a matter of a couple days. I didn't think this was possible, yes at first it is hard but it is so worth it. I wish I had found Pam sooner. I was hesitant at first because I thought there is no way my baby is going to sleep in his crib but if you stick to the schedule and listen to the sleep angel and follow all the advice it will work! Both my baby and myself are getting the much needed rest we both deserve now. Thank you Pam and sleep angel Sophie! ❤️The service I received was awesome and everyone was so friendly and caring, which is exactly what I was looking for. It made the hard times much easier. I highly recommend Pam Nease sleep. You won't be disappointed!\n\nKate D.\n\nWe started with our baby at 3.5 months of age and it was definitely one of the best decisions and hardest decisions I have made yet. Definitely not easy, but in the grand scheme of things did not last as long as it feels in the moment! My baby was a big contact napper in order to get longer than 20-30 minutes sleep. I would rock him to sleep (took about 10-15 minutes to fall asleep) transfer him and he would wake around 35 minutes later and in order to get his full amount of sleep during the day I would have to hold him to extend the nap for an extra hour. At the beginning this wasn't so bad as I could sit and watch TV while he slept, but as he got older it basically meant I was his room, in the dark alone rocking him for an additional hour. As much as I loved the snuggles, it was a long time doing nothing. At night he would get transferred 3-4 times within the first 30-40 minutes before night sleep would \"stick\" and he would sleep through the night. Bed time was so stressful as we knew we would have to keep trying to transfer until he was settled.This program changed his sleep for the better! Now we put him down awake, he falls asleep on his own, so theres no extra time spent stressing to get him down or trying to stress to extend the nap and at night he is a champion by sleeping a full 10-11 hours unassisted! Even with his new rolling skills! My consultant Jess was amazing and would answer my million e-mails through the day with one concise response (mostly just securing my thoughts were valid and helping my own trouble shooting). She was absolutely lovely and seemed to care for my baby as her own. She listened and was empathetic during the hard times and was so excited and joyful in the good times! And I can tell you, there were some epic crying moments that I thought we would not get through, but with hard work and effort, our baby no longer cries and falls asleep on his own within 4-6 minutes every single time.I would highly recommend this program to anyone going through a stressful infant sleep period. My little guy is happy easy going babe with his proper night sleep, and now mom is too!\n\nSanna B.\n\nBefore pam, we were struggling to put our 8months baby to sleep. At first, we thought, her night wakes could be because of teething or crawling. As per our family and friends, this phase will pass and she will be back to her sleep routine. However, her night wakes got worst. Naps were also lasting 15-30mins and in the night she started getting up every 1.5hrs which was effecting her day activities and ofcourse our routine was upside down too.We are so glad that we chose Pam nease. The first couple of days of training were challenging as she used to fall asleep in my arms before transferred her to crib or sometimes nurse to sleep. By the end of training, she started falling asleep on her own with time frame less than 10mins.she is sleeping through the night and Nap is getting better too now.We are so happy as she is content and active during day.It was wonderful experience working with Jessica.highly recommend Pam nease.\n\nGina N.\n\nBefore sleep training, we struggled with putting our baby down for naps and bedtime. We had to constantly rock our baby to sleep and she would only nap in our arms or in a swing. I knew we couldn't sustain this so we contacted Pam's team for help and started the sleep training process with Natalie when our baby was 4 months old. Our daughter slept for 8 hours straight the first night and her naps drastically improved the next day. Our daughter is now sleeping through the night and most importantly, she is able to fall asleep on her own. It was a pleasure working with Natalie and I would highly recommend Pam and her team!\n\nHeather S.\n\nMy husband, myself and our nine month old son were bone-tiered, overwhelmed and frustrated with our sleep situation. Our son needed to be nursed to sleep and if he woke up he needed to be nursed back to sleep, many, many, many times per night. Naps were the same and often were short or didn't happen at all. We had read all the books and did Google searches and still we weren't sleeping. Feeling defeated and at our wits-end we reached out to Pam Nease Sleep for a consultation and were introduced to Jessica. Jessica worked with our family dynamic, our parenting style and made sure to involve our other two children (5 and 10 years) in the plan she created for us. She addressed and validated our fears of being \"stuck\" at home in a ridgid, lengthy sleep routine. By day three our son was sleeping 12 hour nights and taking two 1.5 hour naps. He is now able to go from fully awake to sleeping all on his own without any tears or fussing. We have even had these amazing results when we put him to sleep at a family memebers home. No matter where you are in your sleep journey it is never too late to start. Jessica has made all of our lives so much better and we can never thank her enough. We highly recommend Pam Nease Sleep and her team and only wish we had done this sooner.\n\nNavneet D.\n\nPrior to this sleep training , planning my day or trying to get things done was really tough. Not knowing what time she was going to nap, I couldn’t organize when I could do this or that. Furthermore, when it came to bedtime, it was like praying to the gods, hoping that it would be not horrible getting her down. Every night when it was bedtime , the anxiety and panic would kick in because it was so tough. HOWEVER, after sleep training , life is so much better. I can confidently get things done knowing my baby is sleeping and WILL be sleeping for x amount of time. And bedtime is easy peasy now. There’s no anxiety or fear anymore when the clock ticks closer to bedtime. It’s actually fun now ! And she goes down quickly and easily — with no tears !!!! No rocking !!!! No pacifier !!!! I’m so happy we went through this sleep training process. Super grateful for Sophie and the team. Disclaimer: sleep training itself was tough. Hearing the baby crying , is painful to hear. But you have to stay strong and stick through it. You will see the reward !!!! But again, you have to stay strong and power through the little cries. This is not for light hearted. All in all, it was a roller coaster of emotions going through this , but now that we’re at the end, I’m so happy we did it !\n\nTara K.\n\nDefinitely agree with all of the other reviews! I was skeptical at first but we were at the end of our rope and desperate to try anything. So glad we did! Our 12 month old was waking up ready for the day between 4-6 am for months and often waking up every couple of hours during the night. We thought we had tried everything (moved bedtime later, earlier, changed nap schedule, stopped night feeds, cry it out, pat back to sleep, white noise... and the list goes on)! We were constantly sleep deprived and irritable. Within a couple of weeks of working with sleep angel Katrina he was sleeping through the night and past 6am most mornings!! It has literally changed our lives and we highly recommend to anyone struggling with sleep issues with their little ones! Best money we have spent in a long time!\n\nSamantha G.\n\nIf there were 10 stars they'd get 100! I was up every 45mins-1.5hrs with our son & was really starting to feel the effects of sleep deprivation, I kept...\n\nKatie F.\n\nJessica at Pam Nease Sleep is incredible!

Our son spent the first 6 months of his life literally sleeping ON me and never slept more than 3...\n\nAlannah R.\n\nThis was the best investment we made for our baby! We first contacted Pam Nease Sleep and worked with Katrina when our little one was 3 months old, in other words after 3 months of no sleep in our house, and almost a year later we have a quiet/calm house from 7pm to 7am! We loved that we had so many follow up convos so we could ask questions and also so Katrina could keep us on track in the beginning because it’s hard to stick to a plan when you’re that tired. She was great, Pam was always available as well and being part of the Pam Nease Sleep Family is something that we’ll appreciate forever! Plus, the absolutely best part of it is that we have a happy child who gets the sleep she needs at night and naps which means more time for family and fun! 🙂\n\nBettie J.\n\nMy baby went from waking up 3 to 4 times a night to sleeping 12 hours without a peep! And he take 1.5 to 2 hour naps! This was the best thing that my...\n\nKarissa S.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED! We decided to sleep train our first at about 10 months after witnessing the miracle of a friend putting their little one down for a nap within 5 min and proceeding to tell us that they also sleep through the night! I was suffering from lack of sleep or being a Momzombie, and needed help. Jessica was our sleep trainer for our first and made everything so relaxed and straight forward. When we had our second in January we knew we would get him sleep trained with Jessica asap. I cannot say enough how truly thankful I am for this service and Jessica. She is kind, knowledgeable, patient and just a truly special person who really helped us as a family! Forever grateful <3\n\nDani G.\n\nAll of the positive reviews are bang on - this really does work and is SO worth the money! Our situation was a bit different as our daughter is 6 but had bad sleep habits since she was 3, including coming in our bed in the middle of the night every night, not going to sleep on her own, and often waking up in the evening and needing an adult in her bed to get back to sleep. Now we tuck her in and leave - no evening wakes and no coming in our bed!!! Thank you so much to Sophie for eliciting such a positive change for our family. Highly recommend and worth the cost!\n\nAshley F.\n\nGame. Changer. We were in a rough place with our 6 month old not sleeping well. She constantly needed us to rock her to sleep and eventually would only sleep in our arms. Pam and Natalie were incredibly helpful and got our daughter to sleep through the night and self sooth within two nights. It's pricey but it was the most beneficial purchase. Couldn't recommend more!\n\nmike W.\n\nWhere do we even begin? How do you put a price on your sleep and ultimately your health? Sophie, our little sleep angel, has made all the difference on our little guy's sleep habits, and our own. My wife went from waking up 4-5 times a night, 1.5-2 hour stretches, nursing him back to sleep each time, to 10-12 hours throughout the night, uninterrupted, at 4 months old. If that isn't a miracle I don't know what is. Not only are his sleep habits at night incredible, his schedule throughout the day is like clockwork, making scheduling/errands/appointments, etc. much easier to manage. This has single handily been the best decision we have made as parents yet, and would do it again without hesitation for baby no. 2 if necessary.Thank you Pam Nease + Sophie!Mike, Kelsey + Milo Wahler\n\nMegan W.\n\nMy husband and I are first time parents and had no idea what to expect after the birth of our son. We had all the help we needed in the birthing centre but...\n\nJamie C.\n\nI would highly recommend using Pam Nease Sleep. I had been contemplating using them for months and I wish I would have done it sooner!! Naps and bedtime used to make me anxious and now I enjoy our nap and bedtime routines, our daughter went from being up multiple times a night to sleeping through the night within the first week of using Pam Nease Sleep. It was definitely money well spent!Natalie was our sleep trainer and she was a delight to work with, she was very relatable and easy to talk with. If you’re thinking about hiring someone to help with sleep - this is the company you want and you’d be lucky to end up with Natalie!\n\nJennifer F.\n\nWe turned to Pam Nease Sleep when our daughter was 5 months old. At the time, our daughter would only nap if she was sleeping on me. I knew we couldn't sustain this. As first time parents, we needed help changing course. With Natalie, our super star Sleep Angel, we learned sleep is a skill, and learning the skill is a journey of 10 days, give or take. The cost of the program gave us pause. But we went for it, and I'm so glad we did. Unexpected surprises will pop up: She's teething! What about fevers? What if..? We wanted more individualized support than a book can provide, and Natalie was always ready with a calm, steady, reassuring hand. The sleep journey can be a lonely one for a parent, especially if the responsibility falls primarily on one of you. With Natalie, I never felt alone. Our baby girl needed the expertise of Pam Nease Sleep, and I needed the moral support and reassurance. Thank you Natalie and Pam Nease : )\n\nJoanna C.\n\nI really thought my kids (2 and 6) were going to stump our sleep consultant, Jessica.

Getting your child good sleep is not a want – it’s a necessity, for everyone! You will regret you didn’t do it sooner. Trust me. I had some initial reservations but having Pam and her team give easy executable tasks and support during the process took all of the guessing and friction out of our sleep deprived lives and allowed my wife and I to be better parents and partners.\n\nAndrei G.\n\nWe worked with Jessica for both of our kids and she is great! For our first, we were in a really bad cycle of him waking up at 3-4am every morning, and so...\n\nKaren K\n\nI recognized Pam while I was walking with my son (so he would nap!) -- I quietly yelled \"I need you!\" while I was trying to get away from loud dogs fearing they would wake my son early... I had fallen into the habit of having my son either on me, beside me or walking with me for him to sleep. He was 9 months old and this had started on the second night! I didn't think it would happen to me! I was underweight, fatigued, fearful, and dissatisfied with the relationship I had with my son since I worked while he was awake instead of being with him. I had become so desperate and confused researching all the various sleep approaches out there. Enter Pam: she was kind, warm, accepting, trustworthy, genuine and encouraging. She patiently took all my phone calls (there were many!) and then gently and confidently guided my husband and I through the process which was 100% effective and relatively easy since our son had a content sleep on the first night! It instantly changed and improved our lives. I could never have done it without her. I am so grateful for her help and the incredible dedication and passion she has about sleep and other issues! She and her team are definitely people you can turn to to learn the life changing skill of sleep. Thanks Pam!\n\nA.J H.\n\nGents, this is the best money you are gonna spend. How do you put a price on sleep? What's the cost of being a useless SOB in your career because you're sleep deprived? Our lil babe is sleeping from 7pm to 630am everynight now and wifey and I get some adult time everyday. No BS, Pam could 10x her price and I'd still say it's great value.\n\nJenn H.\n\nWe were so fortunate to have worked with Natalie of Pam Nease Sleep. I’m sure many parents going into this process feel nervous, and unsure if they are making the right choice for their child, as we were. From the beginning, she made us feel less anxious going into the process of sleep learning. Natalie gained our trust and respect very quickly and having her share her own experiences made us feel more at ease. Natalie made us feel supported and she was there every step of the way to help our little one learn to sleep. She was professional and yet very warm with her approach. She was very quick to respond to any questions that we had and gave thorough answers making sure that we had all of the information that we needed. She made us feel proud of ourselves and of our baby for doing all of the hard work. To top off our very positive experience, at the end of our time together, Natalie still reached out to make sure that we had what we needed to go forward as our little one grows and changes before our final goodbyes. I would highly recommend working with Pam Nease Sleep and count yourself very lucky if you work with Natalie.\n\nAmanda M.\n\nBest investment I've made as a parent! My little girl was NOT a good sleeper in any way! My sleep Angel Jessica went above and Beyond to make sure the program was exactly what she needed! She is now 12 weeks and last night she slept 14 hours without waking up and independently goes to sleep every. Single. Time. the best part about it is she did it on her own!! If your reading reviews your most likely a tired family! CALL! Believe me you won't regret it!\n\nErin L.\n\nEvery time is try to write this I run out of space!!!! I want to be brief- but with 2 littles, I don’t have time for brevity... and also have too many amazing things to say.We taught my now almost 5 yr old to sleep (with Pam’s help) at 4 mo. My husband travelled constantly for work- kept wild hours... we needed this and he was on board. She took to it immediately. Currently she still does a one hour relax in her room at nap (it’s her quiet/reading/create things in her room time) and it’s magical. She loves it. She goes to bed at 630/7pm ... so so happily....and wakes at 630/7am. It’s been the best tool for time change, travel, illness, teething... all of it. She’s always slept in cars, planes.. on beaches in the sun and noise... actually unreal.So naturally, we ended up doing the newborn approach with our second. Working with angel Jessica ♥️ Um. Wow. Is all I can say. She tailored this specifically to us. It worked for us... and we had some revisions due to complications with health.. which we bounced right back from. (I swear because of the sleep she learned- and loved). My little wild one is now almost 2... and she lives for naps and nights!! We kept the night feed in until 9 mo (probably more my push than hers since I knew she was my last) but since the early weeks- she put herself down for naps and nights... so easy for having two kids!At this age I have have a (basically) 5 and 2 yr old who rest from 12-130/2... and sleep from 7-7 (though the 2 yr old typically does more like 13 hr nights.)Ok. My kids are actual Pam Nease Super Sleepers (tm) :)Parents: we have a marriage!!!!! We have time for intimacy... and the desire for it...because we’re rested and not resentful of each other :)We have time to veg on silly shows and have a glass of wine at 630 when the sun is still up... because the kids are down! We know we can (wellllllll you know) during naps because we know they’ll be safe and sound in their rooms for 1+ hrs...I mean. Honestly. Marriage saver. Sanity saver. All of it. If you’re reading this it’s because you’re considering it. Let me help you. Just do it. Invest in your family- in every way.\n\nSuzanne H.\n\nWe hired Pam Nease Sleep over 2 years ago to help with our kid's sleep (ages 7 and 9 at the time), and the transformation has been amazing! Before Pam, our 7 year old son (who has ASD and ADHD) would regularly stay awake until 11pm or later (despite being put to bed at 8am). As a result, he would be exhausted in the morning and hard to get out of the house in time for school. We had resorted to using melatonin to get him to sleep, which really didn't help that much anyway.Working with Pam Nease Sleep was a wonderful experience. Pam wrapped our family in love and taught my husband and I simple, yet effective, techniques to get our children to sleep. The best part of the whole process were the regular check-ins with Pam to make sure we were on track and help us re-direct our efforts when necessary. I honestly believe the accountability was key to our success.After only a few weeks of working with Pam Nease Sleep, we were able to stop giving melatonin to our son! Both our kids sleep consistently through the night...even 2 years later. Plus, we no longer dread bedtime as we know the kids will stay in bed once the lights are turned out!!Hiring Pam Nease Sleep was one of the best investment we ever made! Highly recommend this amazing company!\n\nJessica S.\n\nI cannot even begin to express how grateful we are for Pam Nease Sleep and their amazing team. My daughter was a mediocre sleeper but it was manageable but by the time my son was almost 3 I truly didn’t think I could survive anymore without help. I had tried a variety of different sleep training methods with him over the years and just could not make it work for us.We were matched with Sophie and not only is she a Sleep Angel she is an angel in general. She was kind, funny, supportive, firm, and basically I want to be friends with her now haha! She never made me feel like I was taking up too much of her time on the phone and if she didn’t have an answer to a question (which really only happened once) she made sure to check in with the team to find the best answer!If you were ever on the fence about hiring help and you have the option to, hop off that fence and get in Contact with Pam Nease Sleep now. I promise you, you will not regret it! I have TWO super sleepers now for the first time in five long years. THANK YOU!!!!!\n\naman R.\n\nPam Nease is a life saver! We sleep trained our eldest son with her 2.5 years ago and we just sleep trained our second guy. He was waking up every 45min all night long and we were exhausted emotionally, physically and mentally. He needed to be bounced back to sleep every hour. I wanted to wait until he 5.5months like our eldest was but we could barely make it to 5months. We had hit our breaking point.It has been completely different journey with our second guy and we were so thankful for the amazing love and support from our sleep angel Jessica!He definitely took longer and needed more trouble shooting but he is now a super sleeper!!Sleeping 11-12hours a night and 2 naps of 1hr 30min!We could not have done this on our own even though we went through it with our eldest. Each baby is different and unique in their personalities and this guy was definitely more spirited!Thank you so much for heading such an amazing movement Pam! Making a difference in people’s lives and teaching babies the most important skill of sleep!You have changed our lives is such a short amount of time! The best investment we made! It’s a life long skill!\n\nCraig C.\n\nWe now have a 3 1/2 year old girl and a new 5 month old boy. Sleep training for both. Happy babies, happy parents, just do it.\n\nJames M.\n\nWhen our daughter’s sleep pattern changed abruptly leading to 3+ hour bedtimes, we decided that we needed help, and fast! We had heard nothing but great things about Pam Nease Sleep from our friends, so we decided to reach out to see if they could help us. We weren’t sure about it, but once we had our first phone call, we were all in. The team was nothing short of amazing, showing us the light at the end of the tunnel. Complicating things, we had a vacation planned shortly after we started. They helped us through it all, airports, red eye flights, time change, and more. Before Pam Nease, I wouldn’t have believed that our daughter would sleep 11hrs uninterrupted. We’re two years on and so thankful. For any other dads thinking about sleep training...don’t hesitate.\n\nTheresa D\n\nPam Nease Sleep is such a valuable asset to families and children. I have highly recommended them to families who had a rough sleeper and they were thrilled with the help and assistance from their sleep.angels. The gift of sleep is truly one of the greatest gifts. Thank you to Pam and her angels.\n\nTiffany M.\n\nOur little girl is 2.5 years old and is a happy, strong and resilient sleeper because of Pam Nease Sleep. We called Pam Nease when our girl wasn’t sleeping and when we couldn’t cope anymore. Pam’s team coached us, supported us and encouraged us-and, trust me, our baby was described as a “spirited” personality. We weren’t easy clients. But, we stuck with the program because we knew our girl needed it. And it works. She sleeps at daycare, she sleeps for the babysitter and she easily does overnights with her grandparents. Having our child learn how to sleep well has positively impacted all our lives and relationships with each other, too. My husband and I even have our own nights away and we’re each confident that bedtime will go smoothly for the other spouse. Even now, with a toddler, we have Pam’s support as some of her sleep habits have changed. The whole experience has been worth it and I feel like a happier parent. The investment is worth it-it was sleep training or driving lessons (eventually) and I feel pretty happy with my choice!\n\nChrissy F.\n\nNine years ago a sleep deprived mom walked out of Toys R Us (in Kelowna, BC) literally looking for a sign of how to help her 16 week old baby sleep. Searching for the right resources around the city was proving daunting. That is when I saw an SUV with the face of an angel on it. She was with two children and the sign read: Pam Nease. Infant Sleep Consultant. With tears in my eyes, that is where our beautiful journey began. Having Pam in our home to design a plan, to give our daughter her greatest gift; of sleep, was our best investment in time and money yet. At the forefront was a caring plan for my then 17 week old daughter. But what made the greatest impression was her attention to how all of this would effect the rest of our family and life. She took in account our toddler son and his needs. She showed compassion for the demands of my husband's job as a professional hockey player and she made sure to let me know I was never going to be in this alone. The experience of working with Pam was a wonderful one. A true gift. She was always prepared. Available. And equipped with so much fascinating knowledge. I have recommended her services to many friends. And she has provided the same exceptional guidance and success to them. My daughter is now 9 years old and is and has always been a dream sleeper. Through teething, illness, moves, and bumps in the night-she loves her bedroom. She values her sleep and she will let you know it!! Thank you, Pam from the bottom of our hearts.Chrissy and Vernon Fiddler\n\nBrigitte D.\n\nI’ve known Pam now for nine + years as we have had mutual clients over the years. Wow! Pam Nease Sleep has helped so many moms, dads & kids sleep better and longer than imaginable. Pam’s unique sleep plan and support is unparalleled to any other service available. Pam and her sleep angel team are professional and offer so much value even after you are done working with them one on one. I am thankful to have been introduced to Pam Nease Sleep and so will you!\n\nLee M.\n\nI cannot say enough great things about Pam Nease Sleep and our amazing and wonderful sleep angel Katrina. We knew our little man had the ability to sleep longer stretches at night and sometimes could fall back asleep but with Katrina’s help and guidance he is able to independently fall asleep consistently every night and every nap (which use to be on me).When we first started Katrina gave us detailed instructions and prepared us for our sleep learning journey but after the first night, we were ready to pull the plug and stop. Looking back, we are so thankful we didn’t. Without her guidance, we would not have had found out our little man is a super sleeper after all. Katrina was always encouraging, kind and supportive, she was knowledgeable and answered all my questions.Recently we celebrated the Christmas holidays and our sleep angel gave some advice on how to honour our little man's sleep while enjoying time with family. And he slept through it all (loud singing, lots of games, children's excitement) as well as fell back asleep when we got home later!We are so grateful for the gift Katrina gave our whole family. I am a better mom and partner and most importantly we know our little family is finally getting the rest we need!\n\nJulia G.\n\nPam Nease Sleep saved my sanity! We worked with sleep angel Sophie when our daughter turned two weeks old. Due to some complications with breastfeeding we decided to wait a little bit before starting the sleep learning. Sophie gave us a few things we could work on to make the transition easier when the time came. Sophie was so kind and knowledgeable. We even met up with her for coffee when we traveled to Saskatoon to visit family! At exactly 3 months we started the program. The second night our daughter slept 13.5hrs with one wake up to eat! We could not believe it! We loved that the program has guidelines on when to feed, when to do bedtime, when they can wake up for the day and when to cap naps. All these guidelines take the guess work out of it and make baby sleep so much less stressful. Sophie also recommended some great products that have helped our baby girl sleep comfortably. It’s been a month since we sleep trained and our daughter happily goes down for naps and sleeps 11-13hrs every night with one wake up to eat. There were a few tough nights but Sophie had prepared us for that and the pay off is so worth it for everyone. Our daughter has made it through traveling, her first cold, false teething and the ‘4 month sleep regression’ with barely even a hiccup. Our daughter went from being a cranky baby that only napped when being held to the happiest smiliest baby who sleeps in her crib every nap and all night long. It didn’t take long to realize she was as exhausted as we were she just didn’t know how to put herself back to sleep when she would wake up. We are happier, more patient parents that get to enjoy each other’s company in the evening while our baby sleeps peacefully in her crib. This was the best money we have ever spent and we could not be happier with the results! Thank you Sophie and Pam!\n\nCindy F.\n\nSleep is priceless! Worth every penny - I'd even pay double. Emma (our daughter) was already a pretty good sleeper but this solidified it. I recommend...\n\nKarlee G.\n\nWhen I reached out to Pam Nease to begin sleep training, things were pretty rough in our house. Our baby (4.5 months old at the time) had been sleeping well at night, but almost never taking a nap, and it would take sometimes 90 minutes to get her to fall asleep... only to have her wake up 7 minutes later! It got to the point that all naps had to take place in my car or on my chest. We had put in effort to sleep train her on our own, but after she got sick and then reacted poorly to her vaccinations back to back, all the training went out the window. When we tried to do it again she would be crying as we headed to the stairs to go to her room. After a couple of night working with Sleep Angel Beth our daughter was easily putting herself to sleep at night, and taking 3 naps a day - though they were still short. After 2 weeks of sticking with the program, more than half of her naps were 75 minutes or more, and always falling asleep in under 10 minutes. Within the month we were on a two nap schedule, allowing me to make plans with friends and actually leave the house!!!! She has been so much happier since getting the sleep she needs. Watch out for the test days and just stick with the plan... sleep training is worth every penny. Pam and her team really care about your baby and will give the attention required to get them sleeping well... no matter how challenging of a little sleeper you have!\n\nChantelle P.\n\nIn spring 2012 I reached out to Pam as my then 18 month was an awful sleeper! I was being woken up between 5-10 times per night. We had created some really bad habits for our second child by the time Pam came to our rescue and I literally didn't know what to do. Something I really appreciated about Pam was there was NONE, like ZERO judgement regarding our parenting choices that caused this non-sleeping tyrant of a toddler - we were just doing the best we knew how and thank goodness for people like Pam who know better than us and are just here to help! Within just a few sessions of working with Pam and following the program, we all slept better, like A LOT better! She saved us when I literally thought there would be no saving. Pam allowed us to actually function normally again and I am forever grateful for that. My daughter learned excellent life long sleeping habits. She is now 9 and has slept amazing well ever since Pam's professional advice and caring support.\n\nDemi Y.\n\nWhen our daughter was 5 weeks old, we started the newborn sleep training with Jessica. At the time we started, our daughter was sleeping incredibly late (midnight to 2am) and would have nights where she would cry and cry but we couldn't figure out the reason. Jessica had set the expectation that newborn sleep training was a slower and more gradual process but the upside is that there aren't tears involved. We were fine with it taking longer and excited that we wouldn't have to let her cry. Right when we started, it was helpful to have a plan that we could follow and we did notice our daughter's sleep gradually getting better and better. She started sleeping earlier and having a routine and guidelines of when to pick her up, put her down, etc was very helpful. After a few weeks, we decided to give up the sleep training due to my breastfeeding situation, which does not reflect on Jessica at all whatsoever. She was very supportive of our decision and what we felt was best for us at the time. Jessica suggested that we save the remaining support we had left for when we were ready to begin the baby (3mo+) sleep training package. She was very kind to stay in touch during this time and answered my emails with updates and questions regarding when would be a good time to restart the baby sleep training. I'd also like to mention that during my initial consultation, the Pam Nease representative I spoke with recommended waiting until our breastfeeding situation was solid, but my husband and I went ahead and decided to start anyway.When we felt ready to start the baby sleep training approach, our daughter was just a little over 4 months. This went much more smoothly than we could've imagined! Jessica spent a lot of time with us on the phone walking us through all the scenarios and what we should expect. The follow up calls/emails were very helpful as well as she answered all of the questions that came up. Within days, our daughter's sleep improved drastically. Before the sleep training, she was sleeping around 12-13 hours a day, after the first night of sleep training she was sleeping 15+ hours a day. She also started sleeping earlier at approximately 8pm-10pm instead of 11pm or later. Now she consistently sleeps 11-13 hours a night straight through!I would (and already have) highly recommend Jessica to anyone who wants to sleep train their child. Our daughter has gotten better and longer sleep and my husband and I finally have some time to ourselves and are getting better sleep ourselves as well! It's definitely worth hiring a professional for, because a lot of the questions I had for Jessica I wouldn't have been able to find readily available online. Thank you to Pam Nease Sleep and Jessica!\n\nDemi Y.\n\nWhen our daughter was 5 weeks old, we started the newborn sleep training with Jessica. At the time we started, our daughter was sleeping incredibly late...\n\nLindsay-Anne D.\n\n**Best investment** that pays off over the long term. We hired Pam in 2013 to help our first child with her night waking. Things went so well and the program was so easy to follow that we took all of our know-how and applied it to baby #2 three years later. He took to it like a champ. We felt so confident going in the second time - what a relief. Both kids are still good sleepers to this day. They value and enjoy a good night's rest (and mommy and daddy do to). THANK YOU Pam!!\n\nKatie N.\n\nIt's a miracle! My baby sleeps thru the night every night now! Jessica from Pam Nease Sleep helped coach my husband and I from being \" barely getting by...\n\nWendy P.\n\nEmily S.\n\nPam's team was amazing. They helped me with my first child. Naps and bedtime were no longer a nightmare. I have had family members comment what a amazing sleeper my child is now.\n\nStacey Y.\n\nPam Nease and her team are so wonderful. I cannot stress enough how well their plan taught my son how to sleep. Although Jessica was our sleep angel, Pam continues to stay involved with her clients, and really listens to all of the sleep issues being faced. Pam takes the time to speak with me, and reassure me throughout the hard, but rewarding process. Props to Pam and her angels for being so optimistic, upbeat, and gracious when dealing with this sleep deprived, cranky mama!Sleep training is money well spent! I recommend Pam Nease Sleep to anyone who has young children, but hasn't quite mastered the arts of getting a solid nights sleep.Thank you Pam Nease Sleep!!\n\nKaline C.\n\nWe were lucky to work with Pam directly with one of her nanny packages. It was truly an amazing experience. I was so incredibly nervous about sleep training. However, I was absolutely desperate for a change. Pam was so kind, patient and gentle. She gave my husband and I the confidence to see it through and was so gentle with our daughter. I now truly believe that sleep training is the kindest thing you can give to your little ones. It’s an absolute must. I would recommend Pam and her team one hundred percent. She has been our amazing guiding light in all things related to our daughter’s sleep. We couldn’t be happier.\n\nAimee L.\n\nWorking with Jessica at Pam Neese Sleep was one of the best things I've done as a new mom. My husband and I were overwhelmed with all of the books and advice on infant sleep and decided to call the experts once our baby started taking short naps and was becoming an unpredictable sleeper. After working with Jessica for a few days, our 4 month old was falling asleep independently with little to no crying and her nap length started improving every day. It is fun to watch her settle herself to sleep!Now, at the end of our two week program we are confident in what to do for every possible situation and our baby is sleeping 12-13 hours at night! The best part (aside from the excellent sleep) is the confidence it has given us as parents! The program truly works!\n\nAshlyn A.\n\nWe were lucky to work with both Pam and Sophie in 2016 when our twin girls were 10 months old. Our only regret was not finding them sooner. I was an exhausted mama up 5-6 times a night and had literally resorted to sleeping beside the girls' cribs with a pillow on the floor. Pam's loving, gentle, fun and educational approach really spoke to us, and by night 3 our girls started sleeping through the night. Within just a few days we were seeing huge changes in the girl's moods, attentiveness, and engagement in play during awake times, let alone getting more rest ourselves (and our sanity back). Consistent napping followed within a few weeks, and since then I can literally count on one hand the number of rough nights we've had with our now 2.5 year old twin tornadoes who keep us running all day long, but sleep like champions at night. Our girls love their bedtime routine full of giggles, singing and snuggles! We cannot recommend Pam and her team enough, and have already referred several friends and family!\n\nhollip\n\nWhen you're expecting your first child, people tell you about how tired you're going to be and what you should expect. Right... Fast-forward to having a child and discovering what it's like to be a new parent with a child who doesn't sleep anywhere but on mom or dad's chest for the first 5 months of their life. When I contacted Pam I was in full survival mode, having not slept for more than a few hours at one time since the birth of our daughter. The thing friends and family don't tell you about having a child is that your sleep habits as a parent can change dramatically as well. It turns out while my baby girl wasn't sleeping, I had also forgotten how to sleep. Sounds kind of silly, but it's true! Anyway, we knew we didn't know how to help baby girl sleep and I reached out for help! On that first phone call with Pam, my hope soared and my fears decreased and I thought \"Okay, there's help and we're going to figure this out before mommy loses her mind!\" Pam was very lovey and helpful and set us up with on of her sleep consultants. We started sleep training when baby turned 5 months. By night two, baby was well on her way to sleeping through the night. By night three, she was sleeping through the night for 10-12 hours and has been every since! She is 11 months old now. Naps were trickier, but we eventually got the hang of those as well and our daughter has not slept on us or with us since we started. She sleeps happily and contently in her crib or in her playpen at grandma's no problem! Sleep training is a process, but Pam's team is with you every step of the way. They guide you through the process and are there to listen with any of your concerns. The process is challenging, no doubt, but it is so worth it.Seriously. We went from not sleeping (!!) to sleeping through the night. After a while, I even learned how to sleep again too. Our child is happy and healthy and sleeps through teething and illness, with only a few minor hiccups (I mean, she is a baby). I recommend Pam! She saved my sanity and our little family!!\n\nStephanie C.\n\nHiring Pam was the greatest decision I made in regards to my son. 3 years later and he is still super easy to put to bed and such a happy and energetic boy. I was so thrilled with the results that I have hired her again for our newest addition.\n\nChristopher B.\n\nSo glad we hired Pam Nease Sleep to help us! Jessica was more than helpful, more than flexible and more than understanding. We received an attentive, custom plan that fit our schedule and comfort levels. I have already recommended her to many friends and will continue to do so!\n\nSara D.\n\nKimberly Hui (.\n\nLindsay H.\n\nI'm not sure why it took me so long to write this review. I think it's because I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it NEVER did. I called Pam when our babe was nearly three months old. It was clear to me then that I just wasn't sure what to do next for my little one's sleep as all the \"old tricks\" weren't working anymore and both of us were getting more and more tired. I won't say that our experience was always easy, because it wasn't, but it worked. His night sleep was great from night one. He started sleeping through with one night feed immediately, and by 5.5 months had dropped the night feeding on his own. However, the little guy didn't want to make it too easy, so he fought his naps pretty hard for a while. He may be some sort of record-holder, but I'm sure a few more are up there with him.The thing is we completed our little one's sleep learning when he was four-months old. Has there been some ups and downs? Sure. Was it always easy? No. Is he an AMAZING sleeper? Absolutely. He's not just an amazing sleeper \"some of the time\" he is an amazing sleeper all of the time. He sleeps through sickness (more than I sleep when he's sick), teething and believe it or not, the fire alarm in his room (yes I set it off once after he was asleep). The thing that amazes me most is that even when he has little blips (because who doesn't?) He always gets back on track easily due to his strong sleep skills. I think I have finally come to accept this. Sophie and Pam always told me he'd be fine and get back on track, but now I really, truly believe it. In addition, since day one of daycare he has napped at least 2.5 hours every day. He still goes to bed before the other kiddos because he always sleeps the longest so needs more time!This is a little boy who loves his bed. So much so that he learned the word \"bed\" shortly after he turned a year. When we say \"time for bath and bed\" he actually crawls his little bum full-speed to his bedroom looking for his nighttime penguin buddy (most of the time)! He is such a happy, well-rested little guy, and that makes my heart so incredibly happy.If you just aren't sure, want guidance or are desperate for sleep then get your 15-minute follow-up phone-call and hire a Pam Nease Sleep Angel. You won't regret it. This changed our life and gave us all the beautiful gift of sleep. Entirely worth every penny. You will receive kind, gentle, reassuring support no matter what.\n\nNatalia H.\n\nI am so glad I hired Pam Nease and her team to get my little one ‘across the finish line.’ I have confidence every night when he goes to sleep that everyone in the house will have a full night’s sleep. We are so grateful for the tools we acquired that help us sleep at home, travelling or in different time zones. My little guy knows what to expect and has a positive relationship with sleep. This is so helpful for the health of our baby, but also for the whole family. We highly recommend Pam Nease Sleep!\n\nKyla W.\n\nPam's program saved my sanity and gave us all the greatest gift. SLEEP!\n\nCarla W.\n\nWe had Pam come and help us when our twins were 5 months old with a 4 day Nanny Package. It was the best thing we ever did for our family and worth every single penny. It's been a year and we still thank our lucky stars every day that we found Pam - our lives were a sleepless misery. I hate to even think about how unhappy we all were. But a year later, our girls are still champion sleepers, they are happy and thriving and we have our evenings to do whatever we like and never worry about night wake-ups. It's likely the smartest thing I've done since becoming a mom. The skills Pam taught them (and us) about a sleep routine and VALUING sleep will last their whole lives. Could not recommend Pam more and would happily give a sleep package with her to every family member who has a baby in the future.\n\nAshlee G.\n\nMelinda T.\n\nHiring Pam Nease was a life-changing experience. There isn't a day that goes by that my husband and I don't marvel at our two little super sleepers and wonder what our lives would be like if we hadn't taken the leap and hired Pam. I co-slept with my first daughter from birth until 5.5 months. It was not working for our family anymore. I was miserable and so so tired. After learning about Pam through a friend we decided we had nothing to lose. I was skeptical but willing to try anything. The process of teaching our baby to sleep was a lot of hard work and dedication but the pay off was priceless. Our first is now 3.5 years old and still sleeps 11-12 hours straight every night through sickness, travel, time changes, anything. We worked with Ashley L with our second daughter and again the pay off was immense. At 8 months old she is sleeping 12 hrs at night and 4 hrs of napping. The support and encouragement we receieved from Pam and her team was invaluable. We never felt alone and always felt like we were given the tools and knowledge to tackle each hurdle as it came. We know now that we have taught our kids to sleep and this wonderful skill will follow them their whole lives! Thank you Pam Nease Sleep.\n\nMeaghan A.\n\nAshley has been a huge help and support. She fully listened and honoured my family's needs, and helped us teach my little one to rest easier at night. Such a blessing when done with love. Thank you Pam and Ashley and Team!!\n\nJanine C.\n\nWe worked with Pam with our first when we were completely lost and getting up every 1.5-2 hours a night to rock our baby girl back to sleep. We were desperate for things to change and Pam came recommended by a friend. We got in touch and immediately felt surrounded by love, comfort, and understanding. The plan was easy to follow and the email support was all we needed to create a #supersleeper. Our girl got it in only 2 nights and tested us very few times over the next few years (She's now 4 and still goes 12 hours a night!). Having your evenings back to yourself and knowing that your baby is getting the sleep he/she needs is PRICELESS. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Pam and her team of Sleep Angels to anyone. It's never too early or too late to get help!\n\nMegs\n\nHiring Pam Nease Sleep and her team was by far the best investment we have ever made! We came to Pam sleep-deprived and anxious after dealing with a colicky baby for the last 4 months who refused to fall asleep when she wasn't bounced, shh'd or walked around the house. Naps were non-existent and night sleeps were going nowhere. We longed to have a happier, more well-rested baby and we missed having evenings to ourselves to recharge and prepare for the craziness that comes with having two children! We called Pam out of desperation and immediately felt a strong connection to her. During the free 15-minute consultation, we felt a sense of hope. We were put with her Sleep Angel Sophie and within the first night, we had our baby sleeping nearly 12 hours straight. We had constant support and encouragement and never felt like we were alone in the process. It was a gentle, yet effective, approach and our daughter completely changed as a result of finally getting some rest! She was happier and even took feedings better! She fought off illness quicker and even made it through teething without much interruption! It's been nearly 2 years since then and we are still super fans of the Pam Nease Sleep team and truly consider them part of our family. We recommend her to all parents, new or veteran, because you're never too old to get the gift of sleep!\n\nAll in all, this process of sleep training (right from our bedtime routine practice at 4 weeks old) has been challenging at times – but overall we are just amazed at how [our daughter] has learned the skills we have taught her. Watching her soothe herself and calm down in the crib, alone is so beautiful. Seeing her wake from a nap and wait patiently for us with little owl eyes aimed at the door is comical and wonderful. Matt and I have reclaimed our evenings together when she goes to bed- we have time to talk, eat dinner, laugh about our parenting trials and go to bed together IN THE SAME ROOM! No more divide and conquer at all hours of the day and night. Likewise, the last week of my maternity leave, with 4 naps a nap, structure and a light routine, have been the most enjoyable of my whole time off. When Millie is awake she is happy and fun. When she sleeps, I get to have a shower or a hot coffee. It really has been a game changer for us.\n\nMatt and I also found that having an objective third party (you!) involved from the start prevented us from blaming each other, or taking out our emotions on each other, or even resenting our baby. It wasn’t an easy process, and having you involved was healthy for our family to simply take guidance and not wonder if we were ‘doing it right’.\n\nSo THANK YOU for your time and guidance and patience with us. We feel like we discovered the holy grail of infant parenting, lol.\n\nLiz Matt and Millie\n\nElizabeth Golesic\n\nNine years ago a sleep deprived mom walked out of Toys R Us (in Kelowna, BC) literally looking for a sign of how to help her 16 week old baby sleep. Searching for the right resources around the city was proving daunting. That is when I saw an SUV with the face of an angel on it. She was with two children and the sign read: Pam Nease. Infant Sleep Consultant. With tears in my eyes, that is where our beautiful journey began. Having Pam in our home to design a plan, to give our daughter her greatest gift; of sleep, was our best investment in time and money yet. At the forefront was a caring plan for my then 17 week old daughter. But what made the greatest impression was her attention to how all of this would effect the rest of our family and life. She took in account our toddler son and his needs. She showed compassion for the demands of my husband’s job as a professional hockey player and she made sure to let me know I was never going to be in this alone. The experience of working with Pam was a wonderful one. A true gift. She was always prepared. Available. And equipped with so much fascinating knowledge. I have recommended her services to many friends. And she has provided the same exceptional guidance and success to them. My daughter is now 9 years old and is and has always been a dream sleeper. Through teething, illness, moves, and bumps in the night-she loves her bedroom. She values her sleep and she will let you know it!!\n\nThank you, Pam from the bottom of our hearts.\n\nChrissy and Vernon Fiddler\n\nChrissy & Vernon Fiddler\n\nI wanted to write and tell about my experience with Pam Nease Sleep & Ashlyn Ayers. First, a little bit about my babe and our situation before sleep learning… My baby Kate had a very strong sleep association of nursing to sleep. She sure loved being nestled into my chest to fall asleep. I loved it too until the sleep deprivation was starting to take its toll. She started only sleeping in her own crib for 45mins before needing to nurse to sleep again which would take anywhere from 45mins – 3 hours. I resorted to just sleeping upright in my rocking chair. My husband does shift work, so I was getting pretty bogged down with trying new things on my own and resorting back to nursing to sleep for all sleep – naps & bedtime. I finally just gave in and nursed her to sleep on my lap in the living room for her 1-2 hour naps and from about 4-5am onward. I felt trapped and started to feel like I’d never do things for myself again. I had heard there was a sleep consultant in Kelowna so I searched it up! I’m new to the area last year and didn’t really know anyone to ask around. After reaching out to Pam Nease, I was immediately drawn to her positive attitude and empathetic support. After meeting with Ashlyn, she had the same spirit and I knew this was the right choice for me. My husband was hesitant to spend the money, but I ensured him it would be well worth it in the end. After a couple of long nights, Kate started figuring things out and was only taking 10 or so minutes to fall asleep, and some of those she shed no tears! After night 3 she was sleeping through the night with a couple of self-soothed wakes. She is now, after 3 weeks, consistently sleeping 12-13 hours a night (with no wakes) and her naps are 45mins – 2 hours. I said to my husband after the first week – “I feel like myself again for the first time since Kate was born”. I am able to get out of the house and do the things that I’ve been needing and wanting to do. I knew if I were to continue on the path I was on before, i was headed to dark place. THANK YOU PAM & ASHLYN! I recently had my parents visit for a few days and my mom is pretty old school. Rocking and nursing babies to sleep was all she knew and she was very hesitant to what I had done, even though I ensured her that this wasn’t “close the door and let her cry for hours” she was still nervous for night time to arrive and had to sit outside. After 30 mins of intermittent mantra cries (which was abnormal for her), Kate was sound asleep and didn’t wake until morning. The next day Kate was going down for her naps in less than 5 mins and most without any protest! My mom finally realized how amazing this program was and admitted “I wish I had a Pam when I had my babies”. She saw the positive outcome and could see the life back in me! I loved the support from Ashlyn and it actually made my accountable for what I was doing. I know I could have tried similar approaches on my own from a book, but I don’t know that I would have been successful. I didn’t have anyone for support and to let me know what I was doing was right. It was also really nice to have had her been through the same process and have amazing success. Thank you so much for all of your help and guidance. I am excited to be part of the support facebook page to continue receiving and giving support from and to all the moms that have taken this big step!\n\nSarah Hammond, Lake Country, B.C.\n\nSarah Hammond\n\nHi Jessica! It’s been a while since you trained us to sleep train Roger (earlier this year). I was inspired to write you tonight after looking at my sleeping son and feeling an overwhelming sense of gratitude for your help.\n\nYou see, in the last 2 weeks we have flown from Vancouver to Toronto to St. John’s (NL – the other side of Canada!!) to Toronto to Vancouver – all the while Roger was cutting 3 new teeth and even fevering!\n\nThanks to your help he has been sleeping like a champ. Even on the day we flew all the way from St. John’s to Vancouver – a 15 hour travel day and a 4.5 hour time change – he still slept.\n\nWe can’t thank you enough. What a difference to have our evenings to hang out, exercise, work – and yes – SLEEP ourselves!\n\nCheers,\n\nJen, Tim, and Roger\n\nJen, Tim, and Roger\n\nHey Pam,\n\nIt’s been a year since we started our journey with C and his developmental delays. He’s done absolutely amazing this past year for catching right up. He was however diagnosed with ASD a few weeks back. It’s very mild with him. We did notice however when he goes to bed later or wakes up earlier… he has a lot of struggles with his behaviour and communication. He has days where he is rested and our family doc seen him. She wondered why he got a diagnosis. Then there are days where he hasn’t had as much rest.. and it’s quite noticeable. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster of emotions since they put the label on him. Either way he’s still the same sweet little boy he always has been. Both James and I have been talking about how teaching C to sleep at such a young age was probably the best thing we could have ever done for him. One of the main questions when doctors ask about him, is does he sleep? Most kids with ASD struggle with sleep. I couldn’t imagine where he would be right now with his learning if he wasn’t sleeping. So thank you for helping us out when he was 5 months old 🙂\n\nTara D.\n\nKelowna B.C.\n\nTara D.\n\nWhen Pam told us we would be working with Sleep Angel Ashlyn, we were thrilled! We knew we would be in good hands. We are honored to be the first family you have helped on their journey to FINALLY getting a good night’s sleep.\n\nMany months of sleep deprivation were definitely taking a toll on us. We were exhausted and cranky. Well-meaning folks would tell us that it was just a “stage” and that Luisa would eventually sleep through the night. Their advice boiled down to just accepting our sleep-deprived state. To be honest, if we continued on that way, we would likely have punched the next person who offered us that advice. Thank you for showing us another way (and for preventing bodily harm to individuals such as those mentioned above…).\n\nThank you for showing us that this is not just a “stage,” and that babies do have the capability to sleep well and on their own. Yes, it may have involved a bit of crying, but you were right…the crying didn’t last very long, it didn’t cause permanent baby damage, and in the end Luisa learned some invaluable self-soothing and sleeping skills.\n\nThank you for all the support that you gave us during our two-week sleep journey. Your responses to all our questions were incredibly informative (even the ones that weren’t sleep-related). With your help, we went from having a baby that was waking up several times a night (to cry, party or have midnight babble-fests) to one that can sleep for 10-11 hours straight. That’s nothing short of a miracle for our family.\n\nOur sleep journey continues (we still have to work on those darn naps), but this so much easier to do now that all of us in our family are finally getting some rest at night.\n\nWe couldn’t have done this without you!\n\nBig hugs,\n\nGustaaf, Julia and Luisa\n\nBurnaby, B.C.\n\nGustaaf, Julia & Luisa\n\nI’m not sure why it took me so long to write this review. I think it’s because I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it NEVER did. I called Pam when Cooper was nearly three months old. It was clear to me then that I just wasn’t sure what to do next for my little one’s sleep as all the “old tricks” weren’t working anymore and both of us were getting more and more tired. I won’t say that our experience was always easy, because it wasn’t, but it worked. His night sleep was great from night one. He started sleeping through with one night feed immediately, and by 5.5 months had dropped the night feeding on his own. However, the little guy didn’t want to make it too easy, so he fought his naps pretty hard for a while. He may be some sort of record-holder, but I’m sure a few more are up there with him.\n\nThe thing is we completed our little one’s sleep learning when he was four-months old. Has there been some ups and downs? Sure. Was it always easy? No. Is he an AMAZING sleeper? Absolutely. He’s not just an amazing sleeper “some of the time” he is an amazing sleeper all of the time. He sleeps through sickness (more than I sleep when he’s sick), teething and believe it or not, the fire alarm in his room (yes I set it off once after he was asleep. The thing that amazes me most is that even when he has little blips (because who doesn’t?) He always gets back on track easily due to his strong sleep skills. I think I have finally come to accept this. Sophie and Pam always told me he’d be fine and get back on track, but now I really, truly believe it. In addition, since day one of daycare even he has napped at least 2.5 hours every day. He still goes to bed before the other kiddos because he always sleeps the longest so needs more time!\n\nThis is a little boy who loves his bed. So much so that he learned the word “bed” shortly after he turned a year. When we say “time for bath and bed” he actually crawls his little bum full-speed to his bedroom looking for his nighttime penguin buddy (most of the time)! He is such a happy, well-rested little guy, and that makes my heart so incredibly happy.\n\nIf you just aren’t sure, want guidance or are desperate for sleep then get your 15-minute follow-up phone-call and hire a Pam Nease Sleep Angel. You won’t regret it. This changed our life and gave us all the beautiful gift of sleep. Entirely worth every penny. You will receive kind, gentle, reassuring support no matter what.\n\nLindsay Skelton,\n\nKelowna, B.C.\n\nLindsay Skelton\n\nWe had originally done CIO with our first daughter, Mila, and it worked (not as well as the Pam Nease method for sure), but with our daughter Ella, I couldn’t bear the thought of letting her cry it out. She was born with reflux, which led to her crying for 8 hours every evening in infancy (leading to rocking, bouncing, shh-ing and constant babywearing. That coupled with my postpartum depression and anxiety meant that every time that baby cried, I nearly had a full blown panic attack. Even now (she is nearly 2), I still bristle when she whines or gets upset (I am learning to toughen up though, as that toddler sees this weakness in me and uses it to her advantage – LOL). I am convinced that I have some sort of PTSD from the amount of crying that baby did, so when it came time to sleep train, I knew we couldn’t do it the same way we did last time. I am so grateful that we chose Pam and her team to help us get our Ella to sleep in the most gentle and effective way possible – leading to a lot less stress and tears from both baby and mama! Every time I refer a friend (or a stranger – I have multiple friends of friends of friends reach out to me because I pretty much wear an I <3 Pam Nease t-shirt at this point with all the times I talk about our sleep training journey), I tell them how gentle and caring the approach is. That usually is one of the biggest things deterring them from taking the leap to hire a sleep consultant and reassuring them that their baby won’t be left to cry turns them into believers!\n\nI truly do consider the Pam Nease Sleep team to be as instrumental as my doctor and my counsellor in terms of my postpartum recovery. Sleep is my biggest anxiety trigger so having that support really helped me and continues to help me to this day!\n\nMegan Stratikopoulos\n\nKelowna, BC, Canada\n\nMegan Stratikopoulos\n\nPam, it’s coming to the end of our 14 day sleep training schedule here, and I just want to thank you for all your help. Jessica has been a complete delight to work with!!! Thet, Madee and I cannot believe the change in his sleep patterns and we have Jessica to thank for that!! I really didn’t expect such a drastic change so quickly. We really cannot believe it!!! I don’t want to jinx ourselves, but Jack is sleeping well and is much happier!!! Thank you for giving us the tools to start this journey. It has been a great experience, albeit difficult at times, but so worth it!! Thank you!! Jessica really is an awesome and intelligent woman and you are very lucky to have her with you!\n\nDave Friedman\n\nCovina, California, USA\n\nDave, Thet & Jack\n\nSorry it has taken me so long to sit down and write a Thank You letter… I just didn’t know where to begin, there’s so much to be thankful for!\n\nOur life before sleep training was extremely stressful. Our son would only fall asleep after being nursed and rocked by me. My husband could not put him down or he would cry hysterically. I kept thinking things would get better with time but they only got worse… he started resisting naps so much that I could spend my entire day trying to get him to nap. And at 5 months old he was still waking every 2-3 hours at night too. I was exhausted and on the verge of asking my doctor for antidepressants. Turns out I wasn’t depressed, I was sleep deprived. And so was our son!\n\nWe called Pam and within days Sleep Angel Ashley was working with us! The very first night our son SLEPT THROUGH THE NIGHT!!! And he’s been doing it no problem ever since! Now he is napping 1.5-2 hours twice a day with zero fuss and sleeps 11 hours at night. We just took him on a 5 day trip which included car naps, a new location and sleeping in the playpen and he did amazing! He is still blowing us away at every turn. And he is soo much HAPPIER!! The best part for our family is that anyone can put him down now. Which means the world to my husband as he desperately wanted that bond with our son and to be able to help me.\n\nWe can’t thank you enough! We could have read all the books in the world and still not felt confident to sleep train him on our own. You gave us the knowledge, but mostly the peace of mind and encouragement we needed. Life changing!\n\nThank you,\n\nShawna & Kyle Hallet\n\nKelowna, BC, Canada\n\nShawna & Kyle Hallet\n\nThank you for your wonderful support over the past couple of weeks. It was the best decision we’ve made in awhile. Our lives are incredibly different now that Alec is sleeping through the night.

You played a huge part in it Pam Nease! Last Wednesday my mom and I left Houston and headed to my sister’s in Calgary. This was to be the true test of the sleep teaching in my mind. Our old trips involved sleepless nights, sleeping in the truck, driving around at all hours of the night and lots of tears and short patience. Night one: Jasper. Both girls go to sleep in their playpen. And they sleep! Kaylee was a rock star and didn’t deviate, April got up a bit earlier than usual (like an hour) but she slept. This is exciting. Next night: Calgary! This time April was so overtired and overstimulated we didn’t have a great night but we didn’t have to drive anywhere so we made progress! Then the next night. Put her down at the appointed 5:30pm and she slept until 8:15am! Hallelujah! The she does a normal 2 hour nap. Then she goes to bed the next night at her 7pm and sleeps till 7 am! She is sleeping the same away in a playpen as she did at home. Something I thought would never happen! So because they sleep, momma sleeps and when momma sleeps that means fun things can be done. We went to the zoo today! We have been to the park, for walks, played and made so many memories. Thank you for taking my “vacation fear” and empowering us to explore, travel and not plan our lives around bedtime issues! Every morning my I think of you with gratefulness!\n\nAmanda Tobin\n\nHouston, BC, Canada\n\nAmanda Tobin\n\nHi Ashley and Pam,\n\nI feel the need to express my absolute delight with your service already! We are less than 24 hours in and I’m sure we are having unusual early success (I still expect challenges to come), but my son is completely blowing us away! I can’t believe he had this in him and we didn’t know it! He’s doing so well already! Last night was the best sleep I’ve had since he was born over 5 months ago! But what is really getting me with this whole thing is my husband… he’s been asking me for months how he can help me get more sleep but nothing we’ve come up with has really made a difference. So to have him dive into this head first with enthusiasm and to see him feel successful and develop a closer bond with our son brings me to tears! Not to mention the weight that has been lifted off my shoulders. I already know that this is going to be successful long-term for us as well, so THANK YOU!\n\nShawna Hallet\n\nKelowna, BC, Canada\n\nShawna Hallet\n\nEric, myself and Risa went away this past weekend. My aunt and uncle had Marshall and Lyvi. All they kept saying was Pickle(my nickname), Marshall he is so good going to bed he pretty well puts himself to bed lol. You rock!!! forever grateful for your great advice and support❤❤❤\n\nKim Klawitter\n\nHouston, BC, Canada\n\nKim Klawitter\n\nThe sleep revolution has happened! Both girls in bed at 8pm. April woke at five thirty but went back to sleep, Kaylee got up at four for feeding and back to sleep. I am up, showered, kitchen cleaned, laundry started, plants watered (they were very grateful), ate breakfast and am now enjoying a cup of coffee. Still kid free!!! That is almost 13 hours of adult downtime!!! Thank you Pam Nease! I can not believe we have come this far in two weeks! From April up once or twice a night and Kaylee up every 1-2 hours to this!!! Glorious sleep!!! You have joined the superhero ranks for me with Batman, Superman and the Hulk! ❤ This is one of my happy little girls thank to you!\n\nAmanda & Devon Tobin\n\nHouston, BC, Canada\n\nAmanda & Devon Tobin\n\nSo, I am finally writing my testimonial for this amazing team of people. Yes, I say “team” because that is what it takes sometimes when your child doesn’t sleep. They have worked miracles for us. Our son Adrian didn’t sleep well from the moment we brought him home from the hospital. Although he had a difficult birth, even after seeing an osteopath, chiropractor and getting more comfortable, he still didn’t sleep. My husband and I read things, talked to people, even doctors and tried many things on our own, but no luck. I had even talked to Pam while Adrian was younger, but we decided to try longer on our own."
