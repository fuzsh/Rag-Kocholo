        "text": "Template:Infobox television\n\nNeighbours is a long-running Australian television soap opera, running daily episodes of 25 minutes, time excluding commercials. Originally aired on the Seven Network in Australia in 1985, it was shifted to Network Ten early in its life and has remained popular with its core teenage audience ever since. However, rival Australian soap Home and Away still consistently rates better in its home country and has done for over a decade now. The show was created by Reg Watson and is produced by his production company, Grundy Productions.\n\nThe series follows the daily lives of several families who live in the fictional Ramsay Street, Erinsborough - although in fact it is restricted to the small cul-de-sac of six houses at the end of the street - and includes the usual soap staples of births, deaths, and marriages. The show features a regular turnover of attractive young actors mixed in with the more stable cast of older people. Though it is not commonly mentioned so as to not alienate viewers in other Australian cities, Erinsborough (a pseudo-anagram of 'neighbours') is undoubtedly supposed to be a suburb of Melbourne. The show is filmed in Melbourne, and for street scenes uses Pine Oak Court in Vermont South, a suburb in eastern Melbourne. Erinsborough is often contrasted with the neighbouring, and equally fictitious, suburb of Eden Hills. Other locations often mentioned (and sometimes seen) in the show include West Waratah and Waratah Heights.\n\nMany successful Australian actors and singers had some of their earliest work on Neighbours, including Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe (brief extra appearance), Natalie Imbruglia, Jason Donovan, Holly Valance, Mark Little, Delta Goodrem. Actor Alan Dale who had previously starred in The Young Doctors, played the central character of Jim Robinson for the show's first seven years and is now a recognisable star in US series such as 24 and The O.C.. One of the most enduring characters currently on the show is Harold Bishop, played by actor Ian Smith who has also written many of the scripts for the show.\n\nNeighbours is currently celebrating its 20th Anniversary in 2005.\n\nContents\n\nNeighbours internationally\n\nThe show is also popular in the United Kingdom where it quickly gained a cult following after it began to be broadcast there in 1986. BBC One began by screening it at lunchtime, but it was soon given an early evening repeat slot by controller Michael Grade on the advice of his daughter. In the late 1980s it regularly had a UK audience in the tens of millions and was sometimes watched by more people than the population of Australia at that time. The episodes in the UK are now generally shown between one and three months after they are seen in Australia, as the BBC often removes the show from its schedule during major sports tournaments such as Wimbledon and bank holidays in order to take into account the fact that the show usually takes a four week break over the Christmas/New Year in Australia for the Southern Hemisphere summer.\n\nThe show has also been sold to networks in many other countries. Episodes from 1999 were aired for a six-week trial basis on the American channel Oxygen in March of 2004. At first, it was shown in the afternoon opposite higher-rated American soaps such as The Young and the Restless and All My Children, which gave the show anemic ratings from the first airing; the people who would be most interested in the show were watching other, more established serials. After a couple of weeks, the show moved to a late-night time slot and eventually left the air entirely. It was the sixth Australian soap opera to be aired in the United States (The Sullivans, Prisoner, Home and Away, Paradise Beach and Pacific Drive are the other five).\n\nStorylines\n\nIn the beginning, the show mainly focused on two families, the Robinsons and the Ramsays (after whom \"Ramsay Street\" is named) who were as the name of the show suggests, neighbours. The show initially gained notoriety for its depiction of the teenage romance of Scott Robinson and Charlene Ramsay. Their Romeo and Juliet style romance culminated in a wedding was keenly anticipated by viewers and is still fondly regarded today as being one of the high points of the series. Another popular couple in the show's early days was the pairing of Des Clarke and Daphne Lawrence, a couple who also lived on Ramsay Street alongside the Ramsays and the Robinsons. Daphne's death in 1988 is still considered as one of the most emotional moments on the show.\n\nBoth the Ramsays and the Robinsons have been written out of the series with the sole exception of the Bishop family who are related to the Ramsays through the marriage of Harold Bishop to the late Madge Ramsay. Also, one of the original characters, Paul Robinson, made a return to the show in the final episode of 2004 and has become a recurring guest character in 2005. Today the show revolves around the Scully, Hoyland, Bishop and Timmins families, along with several other residents who live in Ramsay Street.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Neighbours gained the reputation as being a somewhat conservative soap with topics such as sex generally not being included in the storylines due to its early evening timeslot in Australia and the United Kingdom (Earlier storylines involving controversial topics such as incest and teenage sex were often censored by the BBC in the UK, which may account for the reluctance on the part of producers to depict controversial issues). In the past two years this has started to change, with the show now regularly featuring its teenage characters discussing issues such as sex and contraception in a manner which has not been seen on the show since the mid 1990s. Most recently, the show has depicted a lesbian storyline involving Sky Mangel and Lana Crawford. The character of Sindi Watts has also been involved in storylines involving stripping and more recently prostitution. The break up of long time married couple Karl and Susan Kennedy and soon after Joe and Lyn Scully has also been a great source of interest to viewers, especially since it has led to a long running storyline in which Izzy Hoyland duped Karl into believing that he was the father of her unborn child and is still continuing the charade today, despite the fact that she tragically miscarried in November 2004.\n\nCurrent characters\n\nSpoiler warning: This list is based on the Australian cast, and will sometimes reflect arrivals and departures which have not been broadcast in the UK.\n\nThese are the current main characters, who each appear in two or three episodes every week, apart from fairly rare breaks for the actors' other real life commitments. (The actors all get a month off at the same time for their main holidays). Most main characters feature for at least two years, but only a fairly small minority last for more than five years.\n\nBishop family\n\nHarold Bishop (Ian Smith) (1987-1991, 1996, 1997 onwards) - former coffee-shop owner (before it burned down), General Store co-owner, devout Christian, Salvation Army member, tuba player, slightly naïve, often comic relief, widower of the late Madge Bishop, father of David and Kerry Bishop, grandfather of Sky Mangel and Serena Bishop.

Harold Bishop also disappeared and was presumed dead, and shortly after Lou Carpenter arrived to move in on Madge.\n\n1992: This year saw the death of Todd Landers after he was hit by a bus while trying to stop his girlfriend Pheobe from having an abortion. New families the Martins and the Allesis arrived in Erinborough as well, as well as the departure of Paul Robinson on fraud charges.\n\n1993: 1993 is often seen as one of the darkest and most dramatic seasons of Neighbours. Micheal Martin tries to make his step-mother Julie Robinson's life a living hell, including drugging her and almost drowning her, and is then sent off to a detention centre. Long running character Jim Robinson died of a heart attack, and his girlfriend Fiona Hartman then stole all his money and fled Erinsborough.\n\n1994: The Willis family left in 1994, and were replaced by the Kennedy family. Julie Robinson also died from falling of a tower at the \"Murder Mystery Weekend\". In the season finale Mark Gottlieb jilted Annalise Hartman at the alter and announced he had decided to become a preist.\n\n1995: 1995 is seen as one of the worst season's in Neighbours' history, with most of the fans finding the storylines very dull. That said, the season still had some memorable moments, including Susan Kennedy confessing to Brett Stark that she performed euthanaisia on her mother when she was younger.\n\n1996: Many fans herald 1996 as a new beginning for Neighbours, with the departures of many longrunning characters and the return of Harold Bishop, who was presumed dead, and his wife Madge. 1996 also saw the arrival of the Wilkinson family, and the death of Cody Willis and Cheryl Stark.\n\n1997: Helen Daniels, the longest serving cast member on Neighbours and the last original resident on the street, died in 1997 in her sleep. Ruth Wilkinson's son Ben Atkins had a crash in the season finale, and Karl Kennedy cheated on Susan with Sarah Beaumont.\n\n1998: The most memorable moment of 1998 would most proabably be when Susan Kennedy found out about Karl's affair and slapped him. 1998 was also the arrival of Joel Samuels and Drew Kirk, and the departure of the Atkins family.\n\n1999: 1999 saw the departure of one of the most long running families, the Martin family, who were replaced by the Scully Family. Sarah Beaumont also got married to Peter Hannay and left Erinsborough, and the season ended with a Millennium Party where the Scully House caught on fire.\n\n2000: 2000 had some of the least amount of cast changes in the whole series, with the only arrivals being Dione Bliss and Darcy Tyler, and the only departures being Amy Greenwood, Bill Kennedy and Anne Wilkinson. Tad discovered he was adopted, and found his real mother just before she died. A mess up in the schedule meant the proper season finale (involving Joe Scully being caught in a fire) was aired two weeks beforehand, and the season finale ended up being a normal, mediocre episode.\n\n2001: Another new family arrived this season, the Hancocks, and Madge Bishop died of pancreatic cancer. Libby Kennedy became pregnant, and gave birth to her baby in the season finale.\n\n2002: The Hancock family left after being in the show for less than a year, and were shortly replaced by the Hoyland family. Steph Scully got engaged to Marc Lambert, but he cheated on her with her sister Flick, and then stood her up at the alter. 2002 saw many cast changes, with the arrivals of Taj Coppin, Boyd Hoyland, Max Hoyland, Rosie Hoyland, Summer Hoyland, Lori Lee, Connor O'Neill, Stuart Parker, Jack Scully and Nina Tucker, and the departures of Elly Conway, Emily Hancock, Evan Hancock, Leo Hancock, Maggie Hancock, Matthew Hancock, Drew Kirk, Tad Reeves, Joel Samuels and Felicity Scully.\n\n2003: 2003 would be most remembered for the death of Dee Bliss on her and Toadie's wedding day. Darcy Tyler was also arrested for robbing the Kennedys, Jack Scully and Nina Tucker had an affair, and Lyn Scully gave birth to her fifth child, Oscar. At the end of this season the Bishop family arrived, as well as the return of Sky Mangel.\n\n2004: 2004 is considered by many to be one of Neighbours' best seasons, with many solid storylines and lots of guest stints by past characters, such as Darcy Tyler, Darren Stark, Michelle Scully, Nina Tucker and Mal Kennedy. Libby also returned to the main cast, but then left about six months afterwards. 2004 also had very few cast changes, with the only new characters being Scott \"Stingray\" Timmins and Sindi Watts, and the only departures being Joe Scully, Taj Coppin and Jack Scully.\n\nNoteworthy episodes\n\nPlease note: All dates are the original Australian airdates.\n\n1985 - The first episode involving Des Clarke's bachelor party.
