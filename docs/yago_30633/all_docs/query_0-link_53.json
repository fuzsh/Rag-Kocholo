        "text": "Janae Timmins (also Hoyland) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Eliza Taylor-Cotter. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 April 2005. The character was created by executive producer Ric Pellizzeri as part of the new Timmins family, joining the established character Stingray Timmins (Ben Nicholas). Janae is characterised as a feisty character who is unafraid of physical confrontation. She has low self-esteem due to her father Kim Timmins (Brett Swain) being absent during her childhood. Janae is featured in various storylines including having her drink spiked with rohypnol, a HIV scare and the victim of an attempted sexual assault."
