        "text": "Neighbours' Stingray looks almost unrecognisable 15 years later. Ben Nicholas left the Australian soap opera in 2007.\n\nNow 34-years-old, he first appeared on the show as rebellious teen Scott Timmins - AKA, Stingray - in 2004. Stingray was the son of Janelle and Kim Timmins and had a string of several siblings including Dylan Timmins.\n\nBen played a part in several storylines during his time on Ramsay Street and his character had a turbulent relationship with Serena Bishop. Since leaving the soap, he has stayed in the entertainment industry and recently became a father.\n\nREAD MORE: Neighbours' Hannah Martin actress looks totally unrecognisable over 20 years since leaving the soap\n\nScott earned his nickname whilst staying with his cousin, Toadie, who decided to give him a fish-themed name to help him fit in. Stingray ended up having an on-and-off again relationship with Serena before she sadly died in a airplane crash. Others may also remember his storyline of being diagnosed with ADHD.\n\nWith a criminal record, he even slept with his brother Dylan's ex-girlfriend Sky Mangel, who fell pregnant. Stingray began to have problems with alcohol and ended up at AA. He later kidnapped Sky's baby, Kerry Mangel Jnr and it was also eventually revealed that she was Dylan's daughter. Nevertheless, Stingray and Sky dated again and he even became a donor for Kerry before he sadly died of a brain aneurysm in March 2007 - marking the end of Ben's time on the soap.\n\nBen's first acting move after Neighbours was in UK Christmas pantomimes - something he began before his departure from the soap in the 2006 festive season at he Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury. Between then and 2009 he performed in Cinderella and several times as Jack in Jack and the Beanstalk in other British theatres. The Aussie even played Jack Scott in the staged version of High School Musical in London in 2008.\n\nIn 2015, Ben wrote and starred in an Australian spoof game show, titled Footballer Wants A Wife. Remaining in the industry, the Aussie now runs Wedid Productions, a content creation agency in one of Melbourne's suburbs back down-under.\n\nHe looks very different to the rebellious teen who caused numerous problems for the residents of Ramsay Street. All grown-up over 15 years later, he's swapped out the short spiky hair for a more relaxed grown-out quiff and facial hair.\n\nThe former Neighbours actor recently welcomed a baby boy, Jesse, with partner Stephanie Lilja on June 23, 2022. Fans have loved the adorable snaps with his \"eternal wingman\", as they write: \"Stingray is a literally dad now I’m crying.\"\n\nDo you have a story you think we should be covering?
