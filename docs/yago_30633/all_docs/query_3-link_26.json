        "text": "The machine-readable finding aid for this collection was created by the Collections Management staff, Utah State Historical Society.\n\nUtah State Historical Society\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah\n\nCopyright, 2004, Utah State Historical Society. All rights reserved.\n\nReproduction, storage or transmittal of this work, or any part of it, in any form or by any means, for commercial purposes, is prohibited without prior authorization of the Utah State Historical Society. This work may be used for scholarly and other non-commercial use provided that the Utah State Historical Society is acknowledged as the creator and copyright holder. About a dozen Utahns founded the Utah State Historical Society in 1897 at the Templeton Hotel in Salt Lake City. Jerrold Ranson Letcher, a transplant to Utah from Missouri, pushed its formation as a society that would balance prominent Mormons with non-Mormons, and involve government officials and women. Letcher had four goals for the Historical Society: to explore and investigate prehistoric artifacts and monuments; to collect and preserve papers, manuscripts, and documents; to hold scheduled meetings to share research and ideas; and to involve all parts of the state to contribute to furthering Utah history. At the first meeting on 22 July 1897, Governor Heber M. Wells appointed Letcher as chairman of the Society. The Utah State Legislature granted a large sum of money to the Society, allowing the Society to establish the Utah Historical Quarterly in 1928. Early issues were devoted to printing primary sources, especially edited versions or translations of journals or diaries. However, because of limited resources during the Great Depression, the Society suspended publication of the Quarterly from 1933 to 1939. Under the direction of Arlington Russell Mortensen beginning in 1950, the Society began its transformation into a more academic, scholarly society. The first person to fill a management role with any training in history, Mortensen had earned a Ph.D. in history and brought his training to the society and especially the Quarterly. During the 1950s, the Quarterly attracted more scholarly authors. Mortensen also used special issues of the Quarterly to appeal to a wider audience, selling these special issues at public newsstands and supermarkets magazine racks. The modernized typography and format, special topics interesting to tourists, and colorful pages of these special issues appealed to a broader interest."
