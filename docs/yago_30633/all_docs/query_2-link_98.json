        "text": "Creation and casting\n\nThe character was created along with her family, which initially included husband Joe (Shane Connor), eldest daughter Stephanie (Carla Bonner), second eldest Felicity (Holly Valance), and youngest daughter Michelle (Kate Keltie). The Scullys were introduced on 20 October 1999 following the departure of the Martin family. The Scullys were the first new family to be introduced to the show since 1996. Former Prisoner actress Janet Andrewartha was cast as the family matriarch Lyn. A year prior to her casting, she told her agent that she wanted an acting job that would keep her working in Melbourne. Six months later, her agent contacted her to ask whether she would take a role on Neighbours. Andrewartha talked with the producers and did a screen test, before accepting the part of Lyn.\n\nCharacterisation\n\nNetwork Ten publicity describe Lyn as going under something of a transformation since first arriving in Erinsborough. Commenting that in her early days Lyn was a suburban earth mother who ran a home, a hairdressing salon and helped husband Joe out with his business. Then stating that she turned into a woman determined to seek revenge after being hurt by her former lover Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). When Lyn returned in 2009 she had changed dramatically, she became less passive and more willing to put up a fight. Andrewartha commented on these changes stating: \"She's less passive than she was, which is a good thing. She always gives something a go and that impresses me. Although she's making enormous mistakes since coming back to the street, she's always well intentioned.\" She was also impressed by the way they changed her over the period of time she was off-screen stating: \"I quite like the way they've done that. As happens in life, one meets people one hasn't seen in a few years, and they perhaps have a harder edge to them and life has treated them rather roughly. You see a world weariness about them and more fight than they had.\"\n\nLyn also gained tendencies that mirrored Paul's personality and she became more feisty and willing to fight her enemies. \"Certainly some of his toughness and his more brittle attitude to life have rubbed off on Lyn [...] there's more worldliness about her. She's not quite as gullible as she was. She's much more feisty and willing to fight. I think that all started with her falling in love with Paul and admiring those qualities in him.\" Andrewartha has stated that if Lyn could choose to be with any of her previous men, she would choose Joe Mangel (Mark Little).\n\nDuring an interview on the BBC website, Andrewartha was asked if she was happy with her character's dramatic changes in clothing style and she stated that: \"We had a change of designer and I couldn't have been more thrilled. I feel a little bit more comfortable in her gear now. I love the way she's constantly changing. I believe one of the really main essences of soap is change and we shouldn't be afraid to alter things. I'm all for change.\"\n\nDeparture and returns\n\nAndrewartha left Neighbours in August 2006, with Lyn's on screen departure occurring 7 December 2006. Andrewartha made two returns to the show, one in January 2008 and shown in May of that year. In 2009, Neighbours' script editor Pete McTighe teased of a potential return: \"Watch this space. You'll see an old favourite return to the street in the second half of 2009. Who I've missed like mad!\" It was later announced that Andrewartha had agreed to return originally contracted for three months, this was later extended to six months. She was later contracted further meaning she would be appearing on a long-term recurring basis. In March 2010, Andrewartha told Channel Five's Holy Soap website that she would be staying with the show for another year as a series regular.\n\nIn April 2011. TV Week revealed that the character was to leave Neighbours. Of her decision to leave, Andrewartha said \"I originally came back in a guest role and ended up staying for nearly two years, so the extra time has been a bonus. It's been tremendous fun and I'll miss it, but it's time to try some new things.\" Andrewartha added that she originally came back for a guest role and called the rest of her stay a \"bonus.\"\n\nReturn (2016)\n\nAndrewartha reprised her role again in late 2015. Andrewartha had returned to the theatre following her 2011 exit, and she admitted that she had not thought about Neighbours until she was asked to come back. She stated, \"It's always lovely catching up with older cast as we have shared so many story lines. However, it is also lovely to work with the new cast as well, including my new grandson and of course reconnecting with my daughter Carla [Bonner]. She still calls me 'Mamma'!\" Lyn returned to Erinsborough during the episode broadcast on 1 February 2016. She came to see Steph, who had moved back to the town after a stay in a psychiatric hospital. She also wanted to help Steph reconnect with her son Charlie Hoyland (Xander McGuire).\n\nWhile Steph was pleased to see Lyn again, Lyn's former husband Paul was not, as he had recently lost all his money and assets. However, when he discovered that some shares he had given to Lyn for their wedding were now worth a small fortune, he tried to charm her. Andrewartha told an Inside Soap reporter, \"Lyn's on to him right away – she's learned from the past.\" The actress also said that there would be \"turbulent time ahead\" for Lyn and Steph, explaining that Steph often finds that Lyn \"barrels in\" to fix things quickly without thinking of the consequences.\n\n1999–2006\n\nLyn and her family move into Ramsay Street just minutes after the Martin family leave. Despite trying to be polite, Lyn manages to insult her new neighbours. However, she finds a good friend in Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) when their husbands become rivals. Lyn finds work in a hair salon and she briefly becomes a Beauty Tree Saleswoman. Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) takes over the salon and despite sacking Lyn, they become friends. Lyn and Joe's son Jack (Jay Bunyan) moves in and Lyn's aunt, Valda (Joan Sydney) makes a brief visit. Felicity and Michelle both leave for New York and Lyn falls pregnant.

When she prints a story about Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine), Susan is shocked and angry at her friend. Lyn accidentally gives the Deb Ball attendees food poisoning and she is fined $2000 and Store is closed temporarily. Lyn and Rebecca compete in a Christmas competition and Lyn wins. She then watches Paul marry Rebecca and she tells Susan that she still loves Paul. Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) returns from boarding school and Lyn invites her to move in.

Charlie's step-mother Philippa Hoyland (Wendy Bos) also comes to Ramsay Street, after noticing Charlie's phone location is in Erinsborough. Lyn explains to Philippa that Steph plans to go into business with Paul, despite his attempts to gaslight her, giving Philippa ammunition for the upcoming adoption hearing. Steph later tells Lyn that she is not giving up her fight for Charlie.\n\nReception\n\nAfter scenes involving the character fighting with Rebecca aired, Darren Rowe of entertainment website Digital Spy praised the scenes and branding it \"one of the best episodes of 2009\". Also stating: \"It is a classic scene and quite simply Neighbours at its absolute best!\".\n\nIn 2010 to celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Lyn is on the list and they make light of how her interfering ways pushed her family away, stating: \"Hairdresser by day and low-quality mother by night, Lyn has spent much of the last decade pestering daughter Steph, what with the rest of her family having fled. Joe sensibly left Lyn (well, the actor was sacked), and Lyn has since remarried Paul, presumably as some kind of karmic punishment for all his misdeeds over the years. Having become good again, Paul escaped her clutches, but Lyn still rattles around. Say what you like about her: she's got staying power.\"\n\nRuth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture criticised Lyn during her monthly review on the popularity of soap opera characters, she branded her 2009 return as unsuccessful, stating: \"This is the most shoe-horned in and unwanted return in the soap for some time. There's no place for Lyn here anymore. If they want to replace Miranda, they could introduce a new couple/family rather than bringing back Lyn. She appears to have completely forgotten about poor Oscar as well, not to mention having turned into even more of a deranged harpy than she was the first time round. Bad, bad storyliners.\""
