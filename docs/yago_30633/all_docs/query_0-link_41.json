        "text": "She spent two years playing the young Bree Timmins on Neighbours but Sianoa Smit-McPhee is barely recognisable since leaving Ramsay St almost 15 years ago.\n\nThe Adelaide-born actor joined the iconic TV show in early 2005 when she was just thirteen years old and has since shrugged off her soap star image.\n\nBree Timmins: Where is she now?\n\nSianoa, 31, has reinvented herself as an edgy singer-songwriter in the years following her most recent on-screen role as Molly Zane in the 2016 teen fantasy flick, Fallen.\n\nAfter releasing several EPs, the Aussie star produced a full-length hip-hop/rap album, Peachy Keen in 2018 which included two songs featuring Ohio rapper, Lil Johnnie.\n\nAccording to Instagram, the pair met on the set of the music video for the song, \"Pull Up\" in mid-2018 and have \"talked every day since\".\n\nSianoa and Lil Johnnie, who features heavily on her Instagram and TikTok accounts, teamed up again for the 2021 single, \"Waves\".\n\nShe performed the track \"Take a Bite of My Heart\" from the 2013 horror-comedy film, All Cheerleaders Die which she also starred in.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHome and Away star reveals impact of sudden fame: ‘Difficult to process’\n\nChrissie Swan shows off transformation after quitting alcohol: 'Gorgeous!'\n\nMarried At First Sight's Jess Power called out for Photoshop fail: 'Oh dear'\n\nSianoa has embraced a goth-inspired look to go with her new music career, wearing lots of black clothes and adding a scattering of tattoos.\n\nThe phrase \"Baby girl I love you to infinity and beyond,\" appears across her collarbone and the name 'Johnnie' on her neck.\n\nIt might be a case of life imitating art, as Sianoa's character Bree explored 'emo' culture after the death of her brother, Stingray who was played by Ben Nicholas.\n\nSianoa made her final appearance on the long-running soap in July 2007, explaining to The Age at the time that she decided to leave to 'do something different'.\n\n\"I didn't want to stay (on Neighbours) any longer and if I'd stayed there more than that I would be known as just Bree and I wanted to do something different,\" she said.\n\nShe added that she discussed the matter with her father, actor and former professional wrestler, Andy McPhee before making the final decision.\n\nThe showbiz gene runs in the family, as Sianoa's younger brother, Kodi is also an actor with credits alongside Hollywood heavyweights Viggo Mortensen in The Road and Eric Bana in Romulus, My Father.\n\nKodi, 25, played Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler in two X-Men films and most recently starred with Kirsten Dunst and Benedict Cumberbatch in The Power of the Dog.\n\nSianoa was often seen with her brother and dad on the red carpet, such as for the premiere of Kodi's animated kids film, ParaNorman in 2012.\n\nAfter Neighbours, Sianoa went on to star in the Disney Channel series As the Bell Rings and from 2009 to 2011, she appeared in the HBO series Hung.\n\nShe returned down under to play Chloe Holloway in the critically acclaimed mini-series, The Kettering Incident in 2016.\n\nThese days, it appears as though Sianoa calls Los Angeles home, where she devotes a lot of her time to working on her music in the recording studio.\n\nNever miss a thing.
