        "meta_description": "In 1452, Sos was a small village in Aragon on the border of the kingdom of Navarre. Juana Enríquez went to the Sada family’s palace in Sos to give birth to her son Fernando, of noble Aragonese lineage. Thus, in this small town, a child was born who would later be known as Ferdinand the Catholic and would reign over half the world. Together with Isabella the Catholic, they would form the most influential royal couple in the history of Spain and America.\r\n\r\nToday, the palace and part of its fortifications still stand in this small village, known as Sos del Rey Católico. It forms part of the Cinco Villas region of Zaragoza. Fernando was born in a turbulent period marked by conflicts between kingdoms and wars of succession. The whole region is peppered by fortresses, towers and castles from the period. As well as Sos del Rey Católico, you can visit Uncastillo, Castiliscar, Luesia and Biel villages, the latter of which is the start and end point of this Collection.\r\n\r\nI propose linking these enclaves by bicycle in a four-stage circular route, totalling 207 kilometres (128 mi) and 4850 metres (16,500 ft) of elevation gain. You ride to each fortress and through the beautiful landscapes of the Pre-Pyrenees of Zaragoza. It’s a route full of contrasts. In these lands you find extensive valleys cultivated with cereals and fruit trees, as well as mountain ranges of up to 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) in altitude. An example of this is the Santo Domingo and Pui Moné mountain ranges, covered with pine and oak trees between spectacular limestone ridges. From their peaks, there are captivating views of the Huesca Pyrenees to the north, and the imposing Moncayo to the southwest. Along the way, you also pass through some abandoned villages – vestiges of better times.\r\n\r\nI’ve designed the four stages so that you can find accommodation in the impressive, fortress-crowned, cobbled villages of Biel, Uncastillo, Sos del Rey Católico and Undués Pintano. In this pre-Pyrenean territory, spring and autumn are mild so these are the best seasons to visit. Winter and summer have more extreme temperatures. Even so, I recommend bringing a swimming costume in case you want to take a dip when you go to the Pígalo pools.\r\n\r\nIt’s advisable to use sun cream, despite the stretches through forests. Take enough food and water too because, although the stages aren’t long, the area is very unpopulated and it can be difficult to fill your bottles outside of the main towns.\r\n\r\nThe route starts and ends in Biel, a village that has plenty of tourist services and can be reached by private vehicle or by Alsa bus. It’s important that you check the conditions for transporting your bike on the company's website.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for me to wish you enjoyment on this great adventure, as you ride your bike through the lands once dominated by Ferdinand the Catholic.",
