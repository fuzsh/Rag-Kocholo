        "text": "5. RESERVE YOUR PLACE\n\nIf your application has been accepted, you will be able to reserve your place at Abat Oliba CEU University. This reservation guarantees a place at the UAO CEU while waiting to pass the EVAU or other entrance requirements*, whether it be passing the PAU, obtaining the CFGS certificate or any other established requirement.\n\nThe reservation fee is €1,500, which is deducted from the total amount of the tuition fee for the first year. You will be able to pay to reserve your place online, on the Prospective Student Portal. You can also pay by credit card, or by bank deposit, using a self-settlement form that can be presented at any CaixaBank or Banco Santander branch.\n\n*The reservation fee may be refunded if the student does not meet all the requirements established by current legislation for entry into the Spanish university system.\n\nCANCELLING YOUR PLACE AFTER RESERVATION\n\nStudents have until 30 June to cancel their reserved place. This means you can book now and cancel if your circumstances change later on.**\n\n**Deadline subject to changes in the official registration calendar\n\nFee\n\nThis service is not optional and is paid together with the reservation of your place. The package costs 500 euros and includes all the services mentioned above. Once the service has been paid for, the fee can no longer be refunded*.\n\n*If you cancel the service before June 30 you will receive a 30% refund..\n\n**If your visa application is rejected, you will receive a 50% refund. You must present a certified document showing that your visa application was rejected.\n\n- If the fee has not been paid and the receipt of the homologation application has not been provided, the €500 fee will be refunded..\n\n- In case the homologation fee has been paid, but the application process has not been registered, 290 Euros will be refunded. - When the homologation application process has been registered, a refund of 120 Euros will be made. In addition, the homologation credential will be sent to both the university and the student as soon as it is issued.\n\n- In the event that the visa is refused, but the homologation has been applied for, the refund will be 120 euros. The homologation credential will be sent to the university and to the student after issuance.\n\n- If the visa is refused and the approval has not been applied for, the €500 fee will be refunded..\n\nHow can I sign up to this service?\n\nIf you are interested in accessing the Hospitality package, you must first start the admission process in your degree of interest and successfully complete it. Once you have been pre-admitted, you can pay for it together with your reserved place in a single payment. Our Academic Information and Guidance service will then contact you.\n\nLocated in the north-east of Spain, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia and Spain’s leading economic area. The city’s population is more than 1.5 million inhabitants, while the number of inhabitants in Catalonia as a whole is more than 7 million.\n\nThanks to its location on the shores of the Mediterranean, it enjoys a gentle climate , with pleasant temperatures all year round.\n\nBarcelona is a modern, cosmopolitan city with lots to do. The city is just the right size, and is very people-friendly.\n\nAbat Oliba CEU University is located in the upper part of Barcelona, in a district that offers plenty of quiet spaces, perfect for learning and studying. The city is home to other universities, as well as plenty of other facilities and green areas close to the Collserola mountain range.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nIf you are a student from a European Economic Area country (EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and you are entitled to social security in your home country, you must apply for a European Health Insurance Card (which replaces the E-111 or E-128 form). This form is issued by the public health authorities in your country and entitles you to healthcare benefits in Spain.\n\nIf you are a student from a country that does not belong to the European Economic Area, you will need to find out if there is a medical agreement between the social security system of your country and the Spanish one (this is the case of some Latin American countries). If such an agreement exists, you will have to contact the public health authorities in your country to apply for the corresponding document and thus be entitled to healthcare benefits in Spain.\n\nIf you are a student who does not fall into any of the above categories, you will need to take out private health insurance to cover you during your stay in Catalonia. We recommend that you ask your insurance company for a document (if possible in Spanish, Catalan, English or French), stating this policy coverage."
