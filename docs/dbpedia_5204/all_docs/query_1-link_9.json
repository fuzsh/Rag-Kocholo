In the north, it is bordered by Sigüés, Artieda and Mianos belonging to Jacetania county.\n\nPintanos valley has a beautiful landscape highly populated by a series of lush forests of pines, oaks and other local species such as quejigo.

Its north face is part of the so-called \"Middle Depression\" formed by Aragón River.\n\nIn the area converge two different climatic regions. The Mediterranean region is located on the south face of these sierras whose vegetation includes the holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia) together with a dense juniper underbrush that is the origin of the name “Sarda”. On the north face of these sierras, the so-called Atlantic region, vegetation includes other species such as oak (Quercus faginea) and Scots pine (Scots pine) as well as an underbrush consisting mainly of boxwood.\n\nThis area is located in the north of the so-called outer Sierras.
