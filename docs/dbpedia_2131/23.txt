#1 - Sebastian Darke: Prince of Fools

Sebastian Darke has the world on his narrow shoulders. The son of a human father and an elvish mother, he is deperately trying to become the family breadwinner and has taken on his late father's job - celebrated jester, Prince of Fools.

Trouble is, Sebastian can't tell a joke to save his life. Dressed in his father's clothes and accompanied by his talking (and endlessly complaining) buffalope, Max, he sets off for the fabled city of Keladon, where he hopes to be appointed court jester to King Septimus. On the way he encounters a tiny but powerful warrior called Cornelius; the beautfiul Princess Kerin; blood-thirsty Brigands and enough perils to make him wonder why he ever decided to leave home.

A hilarious and swashbuckling adventure!

#2 - Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates

Sebastian, Max and Cornelius are ready for another adventure and heading to the bustling port of Ramalat. Once there they intend to embark on a perilous sea journey in search of the fabled lost treasure of the pirate King, Captain Calinestra.

But first, they must make it through the dark and mysterious forest of Geltane and survive an encounter with Leonora; a powerful enchantress, with a terrifying secret and a magical hold over Sebastian's senses.

And as if that wasn't bad enough, when they finally reach Ramalat, a feisty female sea captain; an infamous young pirate; ravenous sea creatures, giant lizards; furious sea battles and breathtaking action await them.

Will they discover the lost treasure? Will Sebastian live to tell the tale? Will Cornelius be beaten in armed combat? And will Max EVER stop moaning?
