Synopsis

Sebastian Darke has the world on his narrow shoulders. The son of a human father and an elvish mother, he is deperately trying to become the family breadwinner and has taken on his late father's job - celebrated jester, Prince of Fools. Trouble is, Sebastian can't tell a joke to save his life. Dressed in his father's clothes and accompanied by his talking (and endlessly complaining) buffalope, Max, he sets off for the fabled city of Keladon, where he hopes to be appointed court jester to King Septimus. On the way he encounters a tiny but powerful warrior called Cornelius; the beautfiul Princess Kerin; blood-thirsty Brigands and enough perils to make him wonder why he ever decided to leave home. This book is a hilarious and swashbuckling adventure!

Review

"This story zips along with plenty of jokes, outrageous moments of melodrama and odd spots of violence of the type that never really seems to hurt. A sequel involving pirates is promised soon; readers who enjoy this book, and there should be many, can start looking forward to it now" (Times Educational Supplement)

"In this delightful first book in a new series Philip Caveney has created a colorful and fascinating collection of characters . . . Wonderfully written with plenty of humor, this is a highly entertaining title for intermediate readers" (Through the Looking Glass)

"A rip-roaring adventure that will have you laughing out loud" (Waterstones Books Quarterly)
