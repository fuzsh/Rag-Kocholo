        "text": "Introduction\n\nLooking for young adult novels for boys or just YA books that have male main characters? Here are 10 YA books for teen boys or just anyone who loves a good story. (And check out the link at the bottom of the post for MORE young adult books with male protagonists!)\n\n1. The Boy Most Likely To by Huntley Fitzpatrick\n\nTim is known for being wild, so when he falls in love with the smart, perfect Alice Garrett and she falls in love with him, no one really thinks Alice is making the right choice–including Alice herself. When some of Tim’s past actions catch up with him, the situation gets even trickier, but he and Alice just might be able to find a way to make their relationship work.\n\n2. Eragon by Christopher Paolini\n\nWhen a simple farm boy stumbles across a dragon egg, a thing long thought to have disappeared from the world entirely, he accidentally becomes a legendary Dragon Rider and becomes embroiled in political schemes more fraught than he could have ever imagined.\n\n3. The False Prince by Jennifer A. Nielsen\n\nConnor, a nobleman in a kingdom on the brink of civil war, has created a plan to hold his country together. He gathers boys from orphanages across the land, seeking for the perfect boy to present to the court as the long-lost prince, the rightful heir to the throne. Although Conner presents his motives as pure, Sage is skeptical. His tongue is as sharp as his mind, but he finds he may have to compete for the role of prince as keenly as the other boys if he intends to come out of the plot unscathed.\n\n4. Hatchet by Gary Paulsen\n\nWhen Brian’s small plane crash lands on its way to Canada and Brian is the only survivor, he finds himself fighting for his life in the wilderness as he waits for a miracle rescue.\n\n5. I Am Number Four by Pitticus Lore\n\nWhen the planet of Lorien was destroyed by the Mogadoriens, nine children were sent to Earth to live with their guardians until they could grow up, develop their powers, defeat their enemies, and reclaim their home. But until adolescence, when they begin to develop their legacies, the children are defenseless, protected only by anonymity, constant moving, and a charm that says they can only be killed in order of their numbers. One, Two, and Three were killed. John Smith is Number Four.\n\n6. Marina by Carlos Ruiz Zafon\n\nAfter Oscar vanishes from his Barcelona boarding school and witnesses a strange ceremony where a nameless woman bears a rose to a nameless grave, he and his new friend Marina embark on a wild journey that will take them across the city and even beneath the city streets.\n\n7. The Maze Runner by James Dashner\n\nThomas wakes up in an elevator remembering nothing but his first name. When the doors open, he finds himself surrounded by a pack of boys who call themselves the Gladers, and who all arrived in the same place just as he did. They formed a community within the four walls that protect them from the surrounding Maze and the monsters it contains—giant mechanical horrors known as Grievers. Each day the boys send out a series of runners into the Maze in the hopes that they will find a way out. When a girl arrives in the elevator, however, bearing the message that she is the very last, the boys realize that they only have a few days to decode the secret of the Maze and find their way home—or they will all perish.\n\n8. Prince of Fools by Philip Caveney\n\nWith his father, a famous jester, dead, Sebastian determines to carry on the family business to support his mother. To do so, however, he has to travel to the court of King Septimus, said to be a wealthy ruler. On the way, Sebastian and his talking buffalope Max meet an incredible fighter named Cornelius and rescue King Septimus’s niece Princess Kerin from brigands. It’s unfortunate for Sebastian’s career plans, however, that Septimus wanted Kerin dead.\n\n9. Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson\n\nTen years ago Calamity appeared in the sky and gave men superpowers. Called Epics, they quickly used their powers to claim dominion over the Earth. Dave watched an Epic named Steelheart kill his father. And now he will do anything to end Steelheart’s rule. His plan: to join the Reckoners, a group of ordinary men and women who dare to fight back. Because he thinks he can give them the one thing they need: a clue to Steelheart’s weakness.\n\n10. Yvain: The Knight with the Lion retold by M. T. Anderson\n\nIn this graphic novel retelling of Chrétien de Troyes’s classic medieval story, the knight Yvain must balance his desire for winning glory in battle with fulfilling his promises of loyalty to his new wife and the land he has sworn to protect.\n\nMore Recommendations!\n\nClick here to read our second list of ten more YA books with male protagonists."
