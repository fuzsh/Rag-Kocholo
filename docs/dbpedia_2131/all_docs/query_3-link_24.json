        "text": "Reviewed by James Singleton, age 10\n\nReviewed by Euan Boyle, age 13\n\nReviewed by Lauren Bailey, age 14\n\nTo begin with I couldn’t really get into this book, but as I kept reading it got better and better and I just couldn’t put it down.\n\nI felt that this book seemed as if it understood teenagers and their thoughts. I liked it because it focused on the more socially awkward teenagers, rather than popular teenagers, which made the book funnier.\n\nI also liked the contrast of the nerdy Colin and his funny best friend Hassan, as this difference in personalities compliment each character, and made me want to continue reading to see what they get up to next.\n\nThis book had comedy in it and the storyline wasn’t very complicated, making it easier to follow along. I find it a simple, but effective storyline. The book also has clever aspects added into it, like the relationship graphs, which really emphasises Colin’s nerdiness.\n\nI think this book would be very good for teenagers as some parts could be very relatable, however I also think that young adults would also enjoy it. Overall, this book is very interesting and quirky, just like Colin, but a very good read that will definitely make you smile.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nUpside Down Magic | Sarah Mlynowski, Lauren Myracle and Emily Jenkins\n\nReview by Poppy Morris, age 11\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Hit | Melvin Burgess\n\nReview by Alex Neave, age 14\n\nA new drug is out-Death. Take it and the rest of your life will be amazing. The catch- one you take it you can only live another week. It’s the ultimate high. Adam is tempted. His girlfriend left him, his brother is gone. So what has he got to lose. Everything as it turns out.\n\n‘The hit’ by Melvin Burgess is about a new drug called death. Take it and you get to live your dream life but you only get one week to live. I didn’t really like this book and it took me a while to get into it, however if you are into books about crime then this might just be for you.\n\nOverall, this book was okay even though it took a while to get into it. I think this should be aimed at 13+ year olds as it is quite confusing and the plot has a lot of twists. I would probably give it a 2 out of 5 stars as I didn’t really enjoy it but it was a good plot. If you are looking for something a bit different, I would definitely recommend reading this book!\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nI actually really enjoyed this book! It follows the tale of two girls called Lottie and Ellie, two very different people, who are roommates at the prestigious Rosewood Academy…\n\nCharlotte Pumpkin is a pretty much regular girl (apart from being super smart), that lives in Cornwall with her stepmother. Her mother had passed away, and her dying wish was that Lottie should get into the elite Rosewood Academy. Therefore Lottie worked extremely years and managed to gain a bursary to attend the school.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Eleanor Wolfson of Maradova wants to go to Rosewood rather than Aston Court, the school that all the previous rulers of her country had attended for the past 100 years. There is a big reason for this; Ellie is a bit of a rebel princess. She dyes her hair, sneaks out to concerts, argues about politics and refuses to attend Royal Functions, to name a few. If she attends Aston Court, she will no longer be able to do this…\n\nEventually, Eleanor’s father gives in and allows her to attend Rosewood under the alias ‘Ellie Wolf’- however rumours are soon spread around the school that the Princess of Maradova going there undercover… but the suspicions fall on Lottie! Her surname, Pumpkin, seems too fake for the students, and she misheard another girl’s question and said she was from another country. And then the supposed princess gets bunked with the real princess! As the rumour spreads Lottie is offered a highly unusual, and possibly dangerous, opportunity. Will she take it? Read the book to find out!\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Baby | Lisa Drakeford\n\nReview by Rebecca Maver, age 13\n\nFive very different characters all linked together by one thing – the baby.\n\nIt’s Olivia’s seventeenth birthday party and everything seems to be going well. Her\n\ncontrolling boyfriend seems happy, one of her best friends is dancing and laughing and her little sister is staying in her bedroom. But in the exciting chaos of the party Olivia seems to have lost sight of her best friend, Nicola – is that her moaning in the bathroom?\n\nThe last thing that she expects to happen is to find Nicola giving birth on her bathroom\n\nfloor. At seventeen Nicola isn’t ready to be a mum, but will the people around her help her when they’ve got their own problems to deal with?\n\nOne of the most interesting and original factors of this book is the way that each character has their own section. I think this works really well because you get to see the story progress through the eyes of different characters, and I like how the writing style is slightly different for every character, so you really feel as though you are in their heads, sharing their point of view and seeing their emotions.\n\nThe story tells of the struggles of being a young mum, and how difficult it is – especially when the people around you don’t know how to handle the situation properly.\n\nI really enjoyed this book, as I think that it is true to life – and talks about something that is not often talked about. It also has an unexpected ending – which I thought was really good. It is in a genre that I really enjoy reading, a bit romantic, but also realistic.\n\nI would recommend this book to people my age or older.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nMaresi: The Red Abbey Chronicles | Maria Turtschaninoff\n\nReview by Lauren Bailey, age 13\n\nReview date 04/08/201\n\nMaresi was a very interesting book and a pleasure to read. I don’t think I have ever read a book quite like Maresi . It is set in such a different world yet it seems so familiar and that is what drew me further into the book.\n\nI read this book really fast because I was so drawn into it, I really couldn’t put it down. The book had so many secrets and mysteries and throughout the book they gradually all spill out , this is what makes the reader want to carry on. There is such a dark side to this story and it is very upsetting, but it shows that events like this used to happen and the book tells us how teamwork and sisterhood can help solve these problems by working together.\n\nMaresi really is a good book and would teach people lots about the world and the unpleasantness in it, but with the help of people close to you , you can make a difference.\n\nThis book is probably for ages 13+ and I really would request reading it. I can’t wait to read the other one: Naondel !\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nSecrets| Bali Rai\n\nReview by Alexis Fradley, age 13\n\nReview date 04/08/2017\n\nSecrets is an overall enjoyable read. It is split into two distinct sections from different narrative viewpoints, one by a boy called Jit and the other by a girl called Suky.\n\nJit is having a hard time with his Mum’s boyfriend, Mickey, who abuses him when his Mum’s back is turned. This leads to him sometimes being locked out with no food, and he eventually resorts to skiving off school. Then a whole lot of trouble comes up, and he is threatens with exclusion from school. Jit and his friends need to get rid of Mickey, and fast!\n\nSuky has two boyfriends. Well, that is, one real boyfriend and one fake boyfriend. Her real boyfriend, Imi, is Muslim, and she is Sikh. This should be fine, but Suky is worried about her strict parents disapproving, and she keeps her mystery boyfriend’s identity secret. So, when her parents ask to see her boyfriend, she gets Jit, one of her Sikh friends, to come instead. But what will happen if her parents find out the truth..?\n\nIt was fun to read this book, as it was different to what I usually read. I would recommend this book for ages 10+.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nValentine Joe | Rebecca Stevens\n\nReview by India Davies, age 14\n\nReview date 04/08/2017\n\nRose is going to Belgium with her grandad, for a much-needed\n\nholiday, so she can escape the horrors of her past. But whilst she is\n\nthere she discovers something unimaginable.\n\nOne night, Rose hears the sound of marching outside and wakes up\n\nto discover that the city of Ypres is alive with ghostly figures from the\n\npast. As she is transported into the horrifying world of soldiers, guns\n\nand trenches, she feels closer to the past than ever before…\n\nThe book is based around true events and gives the reader an insight\n\ninto life in WW1. It shows the pain that the soldiers experienced and\n\ninforms us about boy soldiers. This book may be fictional but\n\nteaches the audience about true events that happened in history.\n\nI would recommend this to children who enjoy books based around\n\ntrue stories and war. It is similar to books by Michael Morpurgo (if\n\nyou are a fan of his work you will enjoy this book).\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed reading ‘Valentine Joe’ and thought it was well\n\nwritten and portrayed the characters well. My favourite part of the\n\nbook was when Rose finds her present from Joe and realises he\n\nwasn’t just part of some dream but did really exist. I thought this\n\nmarked the centenary of WW1 really well and would give it a 4/5\n\nstar rating.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Monstrous Child | Francesca Simon\n\nReview by Alex Neave, age 13\n\nReview date 17/07/2017\n\nThis is Hel’s story. The story of how she became Queen of the dead.\n\nHel’s mother is a giantess and her father is a God. Her brothers are Fenrir the wolf and Jormungand the snake. In short, they are not an ordinary family.\n\nHel never wanted to be Queen, but she couldn’t be a normal teenager either. The top part of her body may look normal, but her legs are those of a deceased human. Black and crippled, making everyone around her feel sick.\n\nWhen the Gods come and kidnap her and her mother from their cave, and throw her snake brother into the ocean, she can do nothing about it. Soon, the Gods sentence her to a lifetime of ruling over the dead, and there is no way she can escape. They chuck her into Hell and never let her back up to Earth. She is forced to become leader of the dead.\n\n‘The Monstrous Child’ is such a great book! I really enjoyed reading it. The storyline is very original and I’ve never read a book like this before.\n\nI recommend this book for 12+ because it was a bit difficult to understand at times but it was a very enjoyable read.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Monstrous Child | Francesca Simon\n\nReview by Lily Theakston, age 14\n\nReview date 17/07/2017\n\nThe Monstrous Child is a book by Francesca Simon, the author of Horrid Henry. It is her first book aimed at children aimed 12+. I didn’t realise until after I had finished the book that it is actually part of a series- the Mortal Gods Series. However, since it was a prequel to the series, it could be read easily as a stand-alone book.\n\nThe book is about Norse Mythology. Hel (the narrator) is the daughter of Loki and has the legs of a corpse. She has two brothers: a snake and a wolf. It was foretold that one of her brothers would end the reign of the gods. Because of this, the gods imprison Hel’s siblings and banish her to Niflheim (the Underworld) to be Queen of the Dead.\n\nI liked the Norse Mythology side of it as I haven’t read much about Norse myths and the tale was told from a unique perspective. I also loved the illustrations at the start of chapters and the front cover art. However, I thought that there wasn’t enough of a plot and Hel was a bit too whiny. Well, you would be whiny if you had been exiled to the Underworld, but the complaining started to get boring after a couple of pages. I also thought that despite the target audience of 12+, this book was a bit too young for me.\n\nOverall, this book was good. I would probably give it 3 out of 5 stars; I liked the mythology but not the narrator. If you are looking for a book about mythology with a modern twist, Percy Jackson books are the best you can get, in my opinion. But, if you are looking for something a bit different and told from an unusual point of view, I would recommend this book.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nOksa Pollock, the Last Hope | Anne Plichota and Cendrine Wolf\n\nReview by Rebecca Maver, age 13\n\nReview date 11/5/2017\n\nThis book is about a young French girl, called Oksa Pollock, who moves to England with her mother, father and grandmother. The move from France is very sudden, but Oksa’s best friend, Gus Bellanger, comes with her, making her feel more comfortable. Moving to her new school is intimidating – and even more intimidating when she meets a physics teacher who seems to despise Oksa as soon as she walks through the door. Why? What has she done wrong? Is there more to this physics teacher than meets the eye?\n\nUnfortunately, evil physics teachers aren’t the only people in Oksa’s life that aren’t telling her everything. Oksa soon discovers that she can do extra-ordinary things, things that a normal thirteen year-old girl from Paris could never imagine.\n\nThen, all at once, the truth is revealed, showing Oksa who she truly is, and where she truly belongs. She must learn to control her amazing powers, or she will risk endangering herself and those around her. But is Oksa ready to be trusted with a sacred secret? Will she defeat an evil that threatens everything she is fighting for? After all, she is the last hope…\n\nI would recommend this book to preteen readers, who enjoy different fantasy books. The book is intriguing and action packed, and although it wasn’t my favourite genre, I still thought the characters were good and it had an imaginative story line, which was easy to follow. I’m sure that 10-12 year olds would find it even more gripping than I did!\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nClover Moon | Jacqueline Wilson\n\nReview by Daisy Edwards, age 12\n\nReview date 27/04/2017\n\nThe story of Clovermoon , written by Jacqueline Wilson, is about a girl who is stuck in the alleys with very little happiness, except for when she goes to see Mr Dolly who is a local doll-maker and would do anything to help Clovermoon.\n\nShe lives with her evil stepmother who refuses to let Clover be who she wants to be. But after Clover loses someone close to her and her father doesn’t seem to care about her anymore, what will she do? Who will be with her? What happens to Clover Moon?\n\nI thought that this book was really good and once I started I couldn’t stop. I think that this book is great for girls around the age of 10.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nInk | Alice Broadway\n\nReview by Alexis Fradley, age 13\n\nReview date 27/04/2017\n\nInk is a fascinating and intriguing book that was a pleasure to read, although it wasn’t quite my cup of tea. It is written very well, although it took me a while to get into.\n\nLeora is a girl living in a world of people that are marked with tattoos. These tattoos show a summary of all the major things in their lives, good or bad, so that their souls are unburdened and free. Everyone has birth marks, as well as marks to show their jobs; there are also marks that can deem people as ‘forgotten’ where their names are never spoken and they are no longer remembered.\n\nSome people can read about others and their lives easily by just catching glimpses of their skin. They have the gift of reading, and can use this as a job. Leora and her mum both have this rare, special gift, which her mum uses as her job. However, Leora has always dreamt of being an inker instead, someone who gives people their precious tattoos. Will she accomplish her dream?\n\nUnfortunately, in the society, there are people called blanks, who have no tattoos at all. They are considered untrustworthy, and unsuitable for living in their society. There are many tales that go back a long time, telling them of the blanks and their evil deeds. But is all as it seems?\n\nOverall, this book was interesting and good to read. I quite enjoyed it!\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nEmerald Secret | Susan Moore\n\nReview by Lauren Bailey, age 13\n\nReview date 14/04/2017\n\nThis book was a very interesting book, although at first it was a little bit confusing but this may be due to the fact that I hadn’t read the first book. I started really enjoying the book after the first three chapters and found that after this the next chapters were full of excitement and adventure. Some chapters felt as if they maybe drifted apart, but the next chapter pulled the story back together and explained the previous chapter better.\n\nThis book was a very adventurous book and made me want to keep reading to find out what would happen next. In fact when the book was coming to an end I really wanted to keep reading and didn’t want it to end. Some parts of this book were very emotional and as I really got into this book I felt as if whatever happened to Nat happened to me.\n\nThis really is a good book and I feel it is a book to be read by girls and boys. I loved the extra touch of a mini dictionary at the beginning. By adding this it made me wonder how these words would be relevant in this story. So this would be a lovely book to add to your bookshelf for boys and girls.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAlone | DJ Brazier\n\nReview by Alex Neave, age 13\n\nReview date 14/04/2017\n\nSam was supposed to be on the trip of a lifetime, but when the small plane that was carrying him and his dad back home crashes in the jungle, Sam is alone. And terrified.\n\nSam is growing weaker each day and with no sign of rescue, he needs to find the courage that is required to stay alive in this desolate place. Wild animals, starvation, storms. Sam needs to overcome these problems and find a way home.\n\nHe has nothing to live for. No-one is coming to rescue him, there is no way to get off the island. Shark-infested seas surround the terrible jungle. It is only when he meets a giant otter cub that he finds the will to live. But with disaster never far away, Sam must face the hardest decision of his life. Can he save his friend and make it out of the jungle alive?\n\n‘Alone’ is an adventure filled book about a boy and his struggles to get off an island and save his friend. I really loved this book and it was very exciting. The characters were interesting and it didn’t take me long to get into the book. There was lots of unexpected twists and you never knew what was going to happen next. The plot was amazing and not like anything I have read before.\n\nOverall I would give this book a 10/10 and I would definitely recommend it to everyone! The time spent on reading this book was not a waste of time and I will definitely read this again. I think it is mostly aimed at 9+. Altogether, this book is a great read.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Baby | Lisa Drakeford\n\nReview by India Davies, age 13\n\nReview date 09/03/2017\n\nIt’s Olivia’s seventeenth birthday party. Her sister is in bed, her parents are out for the night, her friends are all having a good time – what could go wrong?\n\nIt’s a perfect picture. However, underneath the canvas, Olivia’s boyfriend is an abusing control freak; Her sister is lonely and socially-awkward; Her friend, Ben is hiding secrets;\n\nStrange groaning noises are coming from the bathroom and as Olivia opens the door the last thing she expects to see is her best friend, Nicola giving birth. The unexpected event upturns everybody’s world and Nicola needs Olivia’s support now more than ever but is Olivia prepared to forgive and forget in order to help her best friend when she needs her most?\n\n‘The baby’ is a drama-filled book about family and friends. I really enjoyed reading it because it was very entertaining as there were lots of unexpected twists in the story. The author used real life issues and portrayed different members of society through the characters, which some readers would be able to relate to. I also liked how the book was split into five different parts and each part was from a different character’s point of view.\n\nI would recommend this book for teenagers (age 13+) with a love for drama and reality shows/books.\n\nIn my opinion this book should get a 4.5/5 rating.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRiverkeep | Martin Stewart\n\nReview by Lily Theakston, age 14\n\nReview date 10/02/2017\n\nRiverkeep is a book about a 15-year- old boy called Wulliam, who, on his 16 th birthday, is set to take over from his father as Riverkeep- something that Wull is not looking forward to.\n\nThe Riverkeep basically tends to the river: fishing out corpses, melting ice and lighting lanterns on the riverside. However, before this can happen, his father is possessed by a dark spirit. When Wull hears of the mormorach (a mighty sea beast) and the possibility that it may offer a cure to his father’s condition, he knows that he must journey to find it to save his father.\n\nI thought that this book contained many good elements. For example, the plot was unique, the world created was diverse and the description was wonderful; I could picture it all. The characters were also good; very individual and likeable. I enjoyed this book, but I wouldn’t say it was amazing. It was a little slow at times, but overall, it was okay. I would give it 3/5 stars. I would recommend this book to someone looking for something unlike anything they’ve read before.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nRed Queen | Victoria Aveyard\n\nReview by Lily Theakston, age 14\n\nRed Queen is set in a world where people are separated by blood colour; the Silvers are the ruling elite and the Reds are their inferiors. The book follows Mare, a Red girl, who believes she will be conscripted into the army like her brothers and be forced to fight a war for the Silvers. However, Mare soon discovers that she has an ability of her own…\n\nWorried that this discovery could mean a shift in power, the Silvers pretend that Mare is a long lost Silver princess. She must use her newly acquired position to aid the rebels- and get justice for the Reds. And of course, there is a love triangle.\n\nI really enjoyed this book because the characters were so surprising and kept me guessing what was going to happen until the very end. There were so many unexpected twists and betrayals! In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I have read it more than once. I found it hard to find any fault with this book, although perhaps more description about the war and the other countries in the Red Queen world would have been good. I think that the message of this story is one of equality and also of being careful of who you trust.\n\nSo far in this series there are 3 books: Red Queen, Glass Sword (the sequel) and Cruel Crown, which is a book containing 2 novellas from the point of view of characters in the main books. The 3 rd book, King’s Cage, is set to be released in February this year. I will be one of the first to buy it! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and is looking for something exciting, unpredictable and unique.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Hypnotist | Laurence Anholt\n\nReview by Rebecca Maver, age 13\n\nBeing a young person of coloured skin in the 1960s isn’t easy, especially in the deep south of America, where unfair laws make life very difficult. Pip is a coloured boy with great expectations, but he is an orphan with hardly any education, so his expectations were never that high. If being sold to a stranger isn’t scary enough, or working in a place called Dead River Farm, he soon begins to learn that not everyone may be as accepting of his background and skin as old Zachery and Lilybelle.\n\nAlthough Martin Luther King is making history, with his infamous ‘I have a dream’ speech, some people are still lynching and burning and blowing up black communities. Particularly the members of the Klu Klux Klan, whose strongest member is closer to Pip than he might realise.\n\nIt is impossible for any person that does not meet the specifications of the Klan (male, white, born in the United States) to feel truly at home in the deeply segregated USA, especially for people like Dr Jack Morrow, a young Irishman who will set about to change the lives of the Dead River Farm residents forever.\n\nI enjoyed reading this book because I agree with the message that the author is telling. I also like the character Jack Morrow, who is sort of the hero of the story, although he doesn’t make it obvious.\n\nAlthough it isn’t my favourite genre, this book still manages to touch your heart, as you follow Pip in his adventure.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Goldfish Boy | Lisa Thompson\n\nReview by Leo Duncan age 11\n\nThis book starts in a pleasant little cul-de- sac in the city. There lives a nice community with old and young but there is one boy who never leaves the house. People regard him as a weirdo and a freak. He was nicknamed Goldfish Boy (by the neighbour’s evil grandchild). This boy never misses a thing. He knows all of the neighbour’s routines and where they go each day and he writes it down in his precious note book but, one day it starts to go wrong…\n\nThe goldfish boy is a story about a boy who never leaves home, a girl who visits the graveyard every day and a missing baby\n\nAll in all I would rate this book 4.5 out of 5 for its outstanding uniqueness. What I loved about the story is the hero wasn’t brave and heroic like all those stereotypes in fairy-tales.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe story begins when 15-year-old Aoife is getting ready to go to her classmate Sinead’s birthday party.

One day he wakes up with a hard lump on the side of his neck which quickly evolves into another human head.\n\nRicky is a dirty-mouthed rebel who isn’t afraid of what other people think and is prepared to spill Richard’s darkest secrets. Together the two heads bicker and fight all the time but when it comes to football they work amazingly together, and when the time comes they are prepared to save each by going to the extremes…\n\nI really enjoyed this book as it was a really original idea and included lots of action and excitement. The author also used death and illness in the story to make it more heartfelt and emotional, which worked well because it made you feel sorry for the characters and the reader could relate to these situations. However, I think the story was a bit slow at the start and the introduction a bit too long.\n\nI think this story is good for older children at primary school and younger children at secondary school (9-12) because it is easier to relate to the character and there is a bit of violence.\n\nOverall I think the story was well written and that is deserves a 3.5/5 rating.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe One Memory of Flora Banks | Emily Barr\n\nReview by Immy Nieper age 14\n\n29/12//2016\n\nThis book is about a girl called Flora Banks who has anterograde amnesia (she knows how to make a cup of tea but doesn’t remember anything that happens such as a conversation with her parents). One day she remembers kissing a boy on a beach so she decides to chase her memory by going to the Artic where the boy now lives. She manages to live by writing notes on her hands and arms, she also has a notebook which tells her story and reminds her who she is and how old she is. While she is away she gets in contact with her older brother who she hasn’t seen for many years he reveals some truths about Flora’s life. Flora along with her best friend Paige have some big decisions to make specially when Flora becomes an adult.\n\nI would recommend this book to girls aged 12-16, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Holding up the Universe and A Fault in our Stars as it is very similar.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nBook of Storms | Ruth Hatfield\n\nReview by Alex Neave age 12\n\n29/12//2016\n\nEleven-year-old Danny O’Neill had never been a very adventurous person but when he wakes up one morning and discovers that his parents have gone missing, he has no choice but to set out on an epic journey.\n\nIt was the morning after the storm and the house was so silent, you could hear a pin drop. He goes into his parents’ bedroom, only to realise that they have disappeared mysteriously. He wanders outside, finding that the huge tree that stands on his garden, has been shattered into thousands of pieces of burnt bark. A huge lightning bolt had struck it.

Danny is in a race against time to rescue everything he loves most. The only problem is, Sammael stands in his way. Can Danny battle the storms and face the demonic Sammael who controls them?\n\nI found this book very interesting, but also very confusing. I had to re-read quite a few chapters because they were very puzzling. Even though it was a bit perplexing, I still think it was a good read and worth the time spent reading it! Overall, I would give this book a 9/10. I would recommend this book to people aged 11+ because it has something in it for everyone! After reading this excellent book, I would definitely recommend it to all my friends.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nValentine Joe | Rebecca Stevens\n\nReview by Lauren Bailey age 12\n\n11/11/2016\n\nI found this book amazing ! The whole story just got better and better. At the end of each chapter Rebecca left it on a bit of a cliff hanger which I found really good because you just want to keep reading on , but you know you have to stop at some point . The ending was jaw – dropping. It really brought the story to life as if you were living in Rose’s world . The characters were put together well and had a moderate role in the story . Also each character had a reason for being in the story.\n\nRebecca has made it better by using real history to bring the story to life. The topic of war is a good topic to choose . It helps people connect to the story more and you actually feel everything that Rose feels. All of her emotions. Having a dog in the story makes it even better. The fact that the dog helped Rose through everything.\n\nOn the whole this was a great book , with a great use of figures of speech , like onomatopoeias and metaphors. So this is a great book to be read by many people.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nAlfie Bloom and the secrets of Hexbridge Castle | Gabrielle Kent\n\nReview by Egan Derrick age 14\n\n3/11/2016\n\nAlfie Bloom lives with his farmer (a poor inventor whose inventions are always almost useful) in a small flat. His life is lonely and boring until he mysteriously dodges a car crash and meets a strange man called Caspian Bone. This man informs him that he has inherited a spooky castle in the countryside near his cousins house that has been closed for centuries. Soon after he moved there with his dad, it was clear that there was something strange going on; Alfie and his cousins discover the remains of an old woman who had been eaten, along with some of her sheep, by a large animal that nobody can identify.\n\nDeep below the castle lies a dark secret that Alfie must discover and protect or risk having everything taken away from him by the two evil headteachers from his new school. The writer manages to convey the importance of strong friendships throughout this book and eventually it is this that manages to help Alfie overcome any problem he comes up against. This book has a little of everything, time-travel, magic, mystery and some evil sisters.\n\nThere are lots of plot twists in this gripping tale and it is so well written that it will not let the reader stop reading and put it down. It is a satisfying story of good versus evil and little verses big that will resonate with young readers. The characters are adventurous and the well-paced story-telling will keep you hooked right to the end. It would be a good book for fans of J.K.Rowling and Enid Blyton and I would highly recommend this book and cant wait till I read the sequel. I think this book targets readers aged 10 – 14 and I would rate it a 4.5/5\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nClose Your Pretty Eyes | Sally Nicholls\n\nReview by Lauren Bailey age 12\n\n20/10/2016\n\nThis book is breath taking. It is an interesting, scary book. Sally has done a very good job because the more I read the more intense I found it and just couldn’t put it down. The title even brings suspense. I really like how she got history behind the story. Using Amelia Dyer, who is a real baby farmer, brought the story to life. The characters were used wisely and this made it an amazing book . This is really a must read book. It’s fabulous !\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Power of the Dark | Robin Jarvis\n\nReview by India Davies age 13\n\n20/10/2016\n\nIn the darkest depths of Whitby, Lil and Verne get caught up in the middle of ancient forces of nature. Mysterious figures return from the past causing the whole town to be put in trance. Lil and Verne must team up with the whimsical witch of Whitby, Cherry Cerise, in order to save the coast from peril.\n\nI thought this was a really imaginative book and helped portray the idea of ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’ because Lil and Verne are outsiders and not considered as ‘cool’ but they end up saving everybody’s lives. My favourite part of the book is when Lil went to Cherry Cerise’s house and she used her magic to change the colour of her house; I wish decorating was that easy! I would recommend this book for 8-12 year olds because it is hard to get bored of as lots happens and it is very thrilling. I would give it a 3.5/5 star rating.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThe Unlikely Adventures of Mabel Jones | Will Mabbitt\n\nReview by Daisy Edwards age 11\n\n25/08/2016\n\nYoung Mabel Jones is sat in bed; it is the dead of the night. The room is filled with a suspicious silence. All of a sudden she is snatched up by pirates but these are no ordinary pirates these are animal pirates. When Mabel is on board the Feroshus Maggot the pirates realise that she is a girl so they decide to make her walk the greasy pole of certain death but they later decide to let her live. The crewmates are on a mission to find the missing pieces of the x which unlocks a portal to our world. The leader of the ship is not one to trust and poor Mabel Jones has to decide whether to put her trust in him…\n\nThis book is good – it has an exciting plot, not for those who enjoy easy reading. This book is good for 8-11 year olds. This book has you gripping onto very word and when you’ve finished it leaves you lying in bed, the room filled with a suspicious silence…\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nShine | Candy Gourlay\n\nReview by Rebecca Maver aged 12\n\nMeet Rosa. She is a young girl who lives in the country of Mirasol, which, by all accounts, is the worst place possible for someone like her to live. This is why she has spent all her life in hiding. You would be hiding if everyone ran screaming from the sight of you, wouldn’t you? Although, Mirasol may not be the best place for her, Rosa believes that she has so much more to discover about her past, and that Mirasol is the only place her questions could be answered.\n\nAt a young age, Rosa experienced a terrible loss, the story of which is filled with strange and mystical doings, which has confused Rosa for the majority of her life. She makes a friend online and she soon discovers that she may not be alone. But as her life on the computer blossoms, in her real-life life she realises that maybe her father hasn’t been entirely truthful about her past. Her head whirring with questions which a familiar stranger, who she has never met before, may be able to answer.\n\nI really enjoyed reading this book; I finished it in one sitting. I love the story and the message, telling that although you may be different, it doesn’t mean that you should feel, and be treated like, a monster. I also like the way the chapters are structured – the way that the main story is told, then a background story afterwards. The story is heart-warming and well told, making it one of my favourite books so far.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nMy Brother Is A Superhero | David Solomons\n\nReview by Alex Neave Aged 12\n\nThis amazing book will have you laughing at shouting at it!\n\nMy brother is a superhero is about two brothers who are as opposite as the North and South pole! Luke loves comics and hates school but Zack loves school and hates comics. One fateful night, they are sat in their treehouse but Luke needs a wee. While he is on the toilet, Zorbon the Decider- an alien from a parallel universe- gives Zack superpowers! When Luke gets back, he’s as mad as a charging bull. Zack has to save two universes! But someone needs to make sure Zack does it right- especially as he won’t even wear a cape!\n\nThis is an entertaining story that I thoroughly enjoyed! I think this book is mostly aimed towards 9-14 year olds. After reading this book I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends!\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\nThis enjoyable and funny book, written by a winner of the Nestlé Smarties book prize, is part of an exiting new book series.\n\nIt all begins on a ship, stuck in the ice plains of the Arctic whist on a mission to reach the North Pole. The main character, Mel, is trapped aboard this very vessel. It seems as if all crew will die there. But, suddenly, while trying to clear a path in the ice, a gigantic body is found, preserved in the ice…\n\nMeanwhile, in London, Britain is ruled by Queen Victoria (or so it seems…) but the country is in complete pandemonium. An evil chief butler is discovering monsters, and many have had to go into hiding. The government no longer exists, and has been replaced by Burlington (the butler) and his MP’s, also known as Monster Patrolmen!!!\n\nThe hunt is on! Will Mel and his giantess friend, Eve, escape Burlington and his allies and find safety? Or will they be captured and taken away? Read the book to find out!\n\nI would recommend this book for 8-11 year olds.\n\n– – – – – – – — – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –\n\nAnd I Darken is a carefully thought-out novel by Kiersten White. It focuses on the idea of having a strong female main character in a society where women are discriminated against. It is set in 15th century Ottoman Empire, based on the historical figure of Vlad the Impaler. The main character, Lada, was created to be a female version of him.\n\nIn the book, Lada and her younger brother, Radu, have never been loved by their father. Radu accepts this but Lada is always trying to prove her worth. When he gives them to the Sultan as part of a peace bargain, the children try to forget about their father. Lada and Radu become friends with the Sultan’s son, Mehmed. Mehmed manages to take his new friends to a place where they can all be free from the Sultan. Mehmed later becomes the Sultan and relies on Lada and Radu to advise him. The three of them manage to stay friends despite war between the countries of their empire. Lada and Radu also have conflict between them after they both fall in love with Mehmed.\n\nI think that this book is very good for young people because it shows some of today’s issues in society and how to cope with or overcome them.\n\nMy favourite character is Mehmed because he tries to do what is best for his empire at the same time as being kind to his friends. I like Lada’s way of coping with her problems and trying to keep who she has left in her life with her.\n\nI would have liked the story to focus more on Radu because I feel like he had bigger problems. I suppose the author made Lada the main character because most popular teen fiction books have a female lead character.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this book and can’t wait for the next book of the series to be released.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nWrecker Jack | G. Fleming\n\nReviewed by Elise Roberts, age 14\n\nWrecker Jack is based around the adventures of 14 year old Jay and new friend Den Crowle. Jay moves to Cornwall and experiences the same nightmare; dark night, raging storms, a ship strung on the rocks and two dark mysterious men quarrelling in a cave all from hundreds of years ago.\n\nJay makes friends with Den, an enthusiastic boy who lives at the local Inn nearby, and learns that he has ancient blood leading back to the infamous pirate Wrecker Jack. Den soon shows Jay a secret passage used by Jack and Matt Crowle- Den’s ancestor- the passage leads to the same cave that Jack and Crowle argued in 200 years ago.\n\nJay meets Den’s dad, but hears knocking from behind the bar. Knocking and screams for help. Knocking that no one else can hear and there is no one on the other side of the bar. Jay finds a belt buckle out on the moors, the buckle belonging to Wrecker Jack. Jay and Den ask a local witch about the dreams and she gives them a potion that when put under the pillow with the belt buckle, will mean that the sleeper will be in the dream. They are also given a crystal to smash as his only means of returning.\n\nThings soon go wrong when the boys encounter Wrecker Jack themselves. Jay’s little sister Katie is also in danger as she slips into the dream- will they all wake up alive?\n\nThis is an engaging book with lots of exciting twists and turns along with colourful and mysterious characters. Unfortunately the book is written slightly simply and lacks engaging language, however the brilliant storyline makes up for this. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves pirates and terrifying adventures.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nFinding Audrey | Sophie Kinsella\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 14\n\nBy best selling author Sophie Kinsella, this book is one of those perfect books to snuggle down with on a rainy day.\n\nAfter an incident in school, 15 year old Audrey has been left with various social anxiety issues- even at home, she never takes off her dark glasses. Narrated by her, the story launches straight into the action of a busy household.\n\nOne of the reasons the book is so engrossing is not only the witty, relatable manner in which the story is told, but also the depth of the characters; Audrey’s mum, a worshipper of the Daily Mail and opposer of electronics, is desperately attempting to save Audrey’s brother, Frank, from what she sees as the demonic grasp of the video game world. With a “Land of Conquerors” international online competition coming up, Frank invites his friend Linus round to practice- the floppy haired boy with the ‘orange segment smile’ who played Atticus Finch in the last school play. After Linus unwittingly stumbles into Audrey’s room, she is frozen with panic and runs away from him. Thinking he offended her, Linus sends a note to apologise, instigating the first conversation with an ‘Outsider’ she’s had in months, and Audrey soon becomes closer and closer to Linus.\n\nTogether, they work on ‘Project Starbucks’- to overcome her illness and finally leave the safe shadows of her home, and Audrey soon realises that Linus might just be bright enough to bring her out of the dark…\n\nI really enjoyed this book. Perfect for (pre)teens, it really did make me laugh out loud with the hilarious, relatable plot.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Oathbreaker’s Shadow | Amy McCulloch\n\nReviewed by Egan Derrick, age 13\n\nThe Oathbreaker’s Shadow is set in the magical land of Darhan where promises are the most important things in life; if someone breaks a promise they are physically scarred for life with a tattoo, followed around by a shadow and cast out into the desert.\n\nThis book is about a boy called Raim who is a warrior, traitor and saviour. Raim becomes a warrior, breaks a promise he didn’t know he had made and then makes it all up at the end. This book is full of exotic lands, magic and adventure as you join Raim on his adventure through Darhan. During this book you will meet lots of different characters such as the wandering desert nomads, the tribes people and the exiled Chauk people.\n\nIf you like books about adventure and fighting this is just the book for you. I particularly liked the scene where Raim is introduced to the other Chauk as there is lots of brilliant description that really makes the reader create an image in there heads however I would have liked the author to spend more time in the main city as I feel that Raim could have had another adventure before he was banned from the city. This could have made for a more interesting start to the book as the ball didn’t really start rolling until he left the city. This was a gripping novel that I would recommend to people that like the Spooks series and I cannot wait for the sequel.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………\n\nMind Games | Teri Terry\n\nReviewed by Bella Ettery, age 12\n\nMind Games is a fantastic book about a dystopian world where people are judged not just by their intelligence but by how rational they are. In this world, everyone over the age of 10 has an implant and the streets of London are empty because everyone is ‘plugged in’. There are ‘addicts’ wandering the streets who can’t stop playing on their implants.\n\nLuna, the main character, is a refuser – someone who doesn’t want to be educated through implants – and she’s always behind everyone else in her school, so it comes as a surprise when she’s invited to a testing centre to see what university she could go to. The only trouble is that something very mysterious is going on in the testing centre – can Luna figure out what is going on before her time runs out?\n\nI love Mind Games because most dystopian novels are very similar, but this one is less predictable and has a great twist at the end. The descriptions gave me a very clear picture of what the characters were going through and the characters were also very well constructed.\n\nAt times, the book linked back to certain moments which give you small clues to what is going on. I would give this book 9/10 because I would prefer the middle a little more fast paced because it had a lack of action. I look forward to some of her other books!\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………\n\nStone Rider | David Hofmeyr\n\nReviewed by David Kirkham, age 12\n\nIn a not too distant future, the earth has been ruined. The only work is mining the mysterious Voddenite, which will probably lead to sickness and death, or ride on mysterious “bio-mechanical” bykes, that have “echoes” of every other person who has rode it.\n\nIf you ride in the races, you get base points which, when you get enough, mean you can go and live on Sky Base; three human made space stations that orbit above earth, where only the rich and wealthy live. It is in this world that Adam Stone survives. His brother Frank was crippled for life in the infamous Blackwater race, where the rider who comes first is automatically sent to Sky Base. His father and mother dead, Adam works feeding the oldest man in town’s pig. He is saving up to ride in the Blackwater, where he will ride to victory and Sky Base.\n\nHowever everything changes when an Outsider, Kane, shows up and befriends Adam. Together they go to buy their tickets for the race, at the byke shop, where the beautiful Sadie Blood works. While still there, a gang of bykers, the Scorpions, show up and try to take Adam’s money. Kane stands up to them and protects Adam. This brings shocking consequences that practically force Adam to ride in the Blackwater.\n\nWith twist after twist and its dystopian imagery, Stone Rider is perfect for teenagers, David Hofmeyr sums up the post-apocalyptic world perfectly.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………\n\nAll The Wrong Questions: Shouldn’t You Be In School? | Lemony Snicket\n\nReviewed by Elise Roberts, age 13\n\nThis is the third novel in Snicket’s ongoing series entitled All The Wrong Questions. The storyline is based upon the peculiar and occasionally unfortunate happenings in Snicket’s own fictional teenage years.\n\nIt could be said the book has a restricted audience because of the unusual style in which it is written. However, once the reader is used to Snicket’s use of language the novel is extremely enjoyable.\n\nRevolving around dark mysteries and shady characters this book is brilliant at spurring the imagination.\n\nI would recommend that any reader of this book reads the first two in the series before embarking on the third.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time | Mark Haddon\n\nReviewed by Ruby Buckley-O’Sullivan, age 13\n\nUpon receiving this book I became very excited to write this review because I had read this incredible book before. Written from the point of view of the main character, Christopher Boone is a teenager with Asperger syndrome. One day he discovers his neighbour’s dog, Wellington has been killed so he plays detective and uses his high level of intelligence to work out who killed Wellington, while uncovering secrets along the way.\n\nThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time offers insight to what life might be like if you are autistic, it is honest and inspiring and most certainly a page-turner. Because Christopher has Asperger syndrome, emotion is not described or used, but this actually made the book more moving and it allowed me to empathise with Christopher.\n\nI knew that the story would lack in emotion from experience with AS, which I thought would be the book’s downfall but it made it more accurate and offered a different perspective to that which I had read before. The most enjoyable part of the book however, was not the mathematics problems, or the insert of Christopher’s schedule, but the ending. I won’t spoil it, but often with books I find that I enjoy most of the book and the build up to the ending, then I’m disappointed. But with this I was truly shocked and impressed.\n\nAn excellent piece of literature Mark Haddon, gripping, moving, honest and impressive.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nThe Maze Runner | James Dashner\n\nReviewed by Alix Stacey, age 14\n\nThe Maze Runner is set, as you would guess, in a maze. In a dystopian future where the Earth is riddled with a catastrophic disease called the ‘Flare’ which has ravaged the earth and it’s inhabitants, W.I.C.K.E.D or ‘World In Catastrophe Killzone Experiment Department’ has filled the maze with teenagers, and placed them all under rigorous testing in hope of a cure.\n\nThe protagonist, Thomas, wakes up in a strange metal box, void of all memories except one, “My name is Thomas.” When the box finally opens to the mysterious world of the Glade, he is overwhelmed. Trying to adjust to this life was hard for Thomas, and the mysterious arrival of the girl Glader who he can somehow communicate with telepathically makes it no easier. Next, Thomas’ unexplained dream to become a runner is soon realised, and he becomes devoted to finding an exit. Not long after, Minho (the keeper of the runners) and Thomas find out how their enemy the ‘Grievers’ enter the maze, through the Griever Hole. Could this be the exit they have been searching for? But how many lives will this small hope of an exit cost, and are they willing to take that chance?\n\nThe overall theme of this book is ‘civilisation vs savagery’, both in the glade and in the real world. The theme is especially shown in how the Gladers punish Ben, a friend of Thomas. The Gladers’ treatment of Ben and his sentencing and punishment bring about feelings of intense guilt in Thomas and highlights the savage rule of law that governs the Glade. Thomas does not feel that it is ethical or humane, and that it reflects the mindset of a culture bent on survival by any means necessary. This shows that while these sorts of punishments uphold their civilisation, they are also savage and almost inhumane. This savagery is also expressed by the Creators themselves. They have subjected these children to a horrific experiment, though they believe their intentions to be good.\n\nThis book fits into three main genres; post apocalyptic fiction, science fiction, and young adult fiction. I believe the most prominent of these to be post apocalyptic fiction, as the ‘apocalypse’ is the reason for the use of the maze trials. In contrast to The Hunger Games, another book from the post apocalyptic genre, the Gladers fight together for their lives and their freedom, whereas the tributes of The Hunger Games fought against each other, each fighting for their life and their life alone. It is this sense of camaraderie and fighting towards a common goal that made me empathise with these characters, and developed a great reader-character relationship as I felt I could identify with them on a more personal level.\n\nI really liked this book because not only is it from one of my favourite genres (science fiction) but also has continuous themes of friendship and trust, which brought me to really bond with these characters. I have not yet read any more works by this author simply because I have not yet had time. However the next book on my ‘to read pile’ is ‘The Scorch Trials’, the second book in this series, and I will most definitely go on to read more of Dashner’s work. I would definitely encourage others to read this book.\n\nI would recommend this book to both reading-fanatics and first-timers who haven’t yet taken to reading, as it has a rich and interesting plot line plus follow up books if you wish to continue the series, and at the same time its short chapters make for a perfect non-committal read.\n\nJames Dasher’s other works include another series called the Mortality Doctrine series, this series is also science fiction and young adult fiction, showing a common theme in his work, however it is not post apocalyptic, contrasting to The Maze Runner.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nDandelion Clocks | Rebecca Westcott\n\nReviewed by Ella Nieper, age 15\n\nDandelion Clocks is a well written emotional book that follows Liv’s life for six months.\n\nAs Liv doesn’t know what is about to happen in her life you want to keep reading, as you are also in the dark as to what will happen until it happens.\n\nThe book starts with Liv’s mum trying to do everything with her like having her ears pierced, whilst her little brother Isaac gets more and more confused at the difference in Mum and Dad.\n\nLiv overhears an argument between her Mum and Dad which confirms something in her mind, that her parents are getting a divorce and they just don’t know how to tell her and Isaac. Life steadily gets harder for Liv and the comfort she has are her Mum’s diaries which she has given to Liv so she doesn’t feel alone.\n\nUntil one day everything changes.\n\nLiv is the narrator in this simple style of writing as she tells the story of her life during this six month period. This book is similar to ‘The Fault in Our Stars` so I recommend it to those who loved that, as they both tell an emotional and personal story.I also recommend it to those who like to read a diary.\n\nI found the book very well written as after reading it you feel like your family has gone through the same thing.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Darke Academy: Secret Lives | Gabriella Poole\n\nReviewed by Immy Nieper, age 13\n\nThe Darke academy tells the story of Cassie Bell, who is the first scholarship girl at the academy since the previous one mysteriously died.\n\nThe academy is a unique school that moves to a new city every term.\n\nAll the pupils are rich and beautiful; Cassie however, stands out from the crowd, as she has a poor background. She begins to try and find out how Jess Johnson, a scholarship girl died? And what else is her brother, Jake, hiding? She becomes close friends with her dormmate Isabella Caruso, who desires to be part of “The Few,” a group of students who are Sir Alric’s favourites. Cassie is about to find out that knowing too much can be deadly.\n\nBut who is the mysterious person roaming the corridors at night? And what are the poisonous stares of “the Few” hiding?\n\nThis is a book full of trust, love, betrayal and sacrifices. I would recommend it to people who enjoy tense and mysterious books. I could not put this book down until I finished it; it was such a good read!\n\nI immediately bought the next book in the series, Darke Academy: Blood Ties, which was as fascinating as the first.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nA Little In Love | Susan Fletcher\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 14\n\nUpon reading the first page, I was automatically drawn into the magical world of 19th century Paris, seeing both its squalor and beauty through the eyes of Éponine Thernardier, the tragic heroine of Les Miserables.\n\nA Little In Love is the story of her life before the well known section of the characters life told in Les Miserables, where she grew up in to a world of lies and theft, when all she really wanted was love. A time before the influence of her family’s lies and cruelty manipulated her to reject her only friend Cosette. Many years later, fate brings both girls to Paris, yet the squalor and poverty is quite different to the fairytale city Éponine had in mind.\n\nHowever when she meets the man of her dreams, an opportunity still remains for her to leave the cruel life she hates, to make amends with the friend she lost, and prove that love can extinguish or restore their friendship.\n\nThe book is a relaxing escape from everyday life, presenting a chance for Les Miserables fans to delve further into the classic story, and even for those who have never heard of the original book, it will still prove a good read.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Messenger of Fear | Michael Grant\n\nReviewed by David Kirkham, age 11\n\nImagine waking up in a field full of dead grass, surrounded by a sickly yellow mist.\n\nThen imagine that you don’t know that this isn’t normal, you just have a feeling this isn’t what usually happens. You can remember nothing apart from the fact that your name is Mara.\n\nIf you have imagined this you will no doubt understand what an unsettling experience that would be, and for those who couldn’t be bothered to imagine it, it is an unsettling experience. Now imagine that the mist clears and there is a church. At least you think it’s what you think a church is. Except this church doesn’t invite you in, it repels you, silently screaming at you to get away from here, as far away as possible. But despite this silent alarm you feel drawn to the church and enter it. Inside is a young man dressed in a long black coat, a black shirt and black trousers, with all his buttons replaced by tiny skulls. This is an even more unsettling experience than waking up knowing nothing, if it’s possible to be more unsettling than that. You can stop imagining now.\n\nMara is then launched on a journey that tests her very understanding of reality, pushing her to her physical and emotional limits. She discovers the terrible fate that awaits her, and even worse she discovers why she has chosen that fate.\n\nIt’s an interesting, but not exactly cheerful book. It’s also rather brilliant.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nSpook’s: Alice | Joseph Delaney\n\nReviewed by Egan Derrick, age 11\n\nThe penultimate book of the Wardstone chronicles is entertaining because it gives you an idea of what life is like for Alice.\n\nIt achieves this, as, unlike the other books in the series, Alice is the one who is speaking in first person, and not Thomas Ward. It shows her opinion on things and how she feels about finding the weapon that will end her life.\n\nThis is interesting as it makes you guess at what will happen in the final book of the series; will she have enough courage to bring back the weapon or will she leave it behind and save herself. It introduces the reader to lots of new interesting monsters and evil beings, and a lot of the questions that they had from reading the previous book. It makes you wonder about a lot of things and there is a surprise around every corner.\n\nInside the book is a magical other land called the Dark which has lots of secrets and is completely different to the normal world and has different rules and beings. More knowledge about witches and Pendle is given in this book because ghosts of Alice’s past before Chipenden (literally) come back to haunt her. The biggest question is will Alice go over to the Dark completely or will she stay good.\n\nMost of the book is about Alice and her past however it includes lots of interesting information about other characters. It carries on perfectly from the other books in the series even though Tom doesn’t feature that much.\n\nAll in all this book is the perfect 12th book for the Wardstone chronicles and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Joseph Delaney or just wants to try a new book. It could be read without reading the books before it but I think it is even better if you have read all the books in the series.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nNoughts and Crosses | Malorie Blackman\n\nReviewed by Elise Roberts, age 13\n\nNoughts and Crosses is an exciting, fast-paced novel that revolves around the lives of its two protagonists; Callum, a Nought who is looked down upon by the ruling Crosses, and Persephone (Sephy). She is the daughter of Kamarl Hadley – one of the most powerful Crosses.\n\nThe forbidden friendship between Callum and Sephy quickly grows into a passionate love affair. However, after Callum’s dad is arrested, Sephy decides to escape her world of opinions and divides. They are separated. Sephy tries to fight for equality for the Noughts without violence, however Callum joins the Liberation Militia; a terrorist group that fights for justice.\n\nAfter rising through the ranks of the Liberation Militia, Callum is given an almost impossible mission; and soon after an even harder decision.\n\nThis is not the usual genre of book that I would choose to read, but it quickly pulls you in with many shocks and surprises throughout the novel. I really enjoyed reading this and couldn’t put it down. I would highly recommend reading this book to any readers above 12.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nRemembrance | Teresa Breslin\n\nReviewed by Ruby Buckley-O’Sullivan, age 13\n\nThis is a very moving novel set in World War One about the lives of five young friends.\n\nAt first, I was unsure about this book, purely because it is not a genre I would personally have chosen and the first couple of chapters were quite hard to get into.\n\nHowever, soon it became a fast paced, emotion packed book which was really well-written. What I particularly liked was the way the characters were explored so well and their opinions and reactions were shown and described.\n\nTake Francis, one of the characters from the richer of the two families. He had really strong views on the war and why he thought it was so wrong to fight the Germans which I really liked because it was unexpected. Also his sister was one of my favourite characters, Charlotte; a strong, determined girl whose story mainly focused on her love for another character and her will to be a success as a nurse. Though I still didn’t entirely enjoy the war element I preferred it greatly to some of the other books I have read with that theme.\n\nAltogether, a wonderful read and a book which I will continue to recommend, however, I think some of the language could be quite difficult for young children to understand so maybe this is an over the age of eight book.\n\nIf I had to rate it, 8/10.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nScorpia | Anthony Horowitz\n\nReviewed by David Kirkham, age 12\n\nScorpia finds the teenage super-spy Alex Rider on a quest to find the real identity of his dead father.\n\nWith only the words of an assassinated assassin to go to Venice, he is determined to find the truth. So when an invitation on a school trip to the floating city comes along, he could hardly refuse!\n\nAlex will then become entangled in a criminal organisation, a school of death and a plan that will endanger the lives of millions of British school kids.\n\nBut will Alex be able to save the lives of almost every schoolchild in Britain, resist the tantalizing temptations of a terror cell and finally learn the truth about his father?\n\nI guess you’ll have to read it to find out.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nJust Like Fate | Cat Patrick & Suzanne Young\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 14\n\nThis book is brilliant, it is going straight on to my favourites shelf!\n\nIt is about a teenager called Caroline.\n\nTraumatised by her parents divorce, she found herself on the doorstep of the only person who truly understood her. Her Grandmother. Years later, her Grandmother is taken in to the hospital; the one where no one comes back out. On the same night is a huge party, where her dream boy and friends are waiting. Caroline has two choices- STAY by her Grandmother’s side, where she could sew herself back into the family she left, or GO to the party and meet her dream man, leaving her torn family and her loving Grandma to start again.\n\nThe book is split into alternating STAY/GO chapters, where we follow her possible paths of fate and see how the book would continue if she went to the party or stayed behind. I did find this a little hard to grasp at first, but soon becomes a simple structure to follow.\n\nThe book features love, regret, friendship, and family. Caroline learns lessons, meets people, and goes through relationships in both futures, losing and gaining friends and family.\n\nIn the end, Caroline’s choice isn’t given away, leaving us fulfilled, but still free to decide for ourselves which future we would have chosen. Just as you think you know which path she will choose, a dramatic twist opens a new door. It keeps us glued as she uncovers sorrows of unwelcome truths, family relationships, and the comedy parts where we are reminded that all paths can cross…\n\nThis book is probably not suitable for anyone under the age of 10, due to the complicated structure, however an advanced young reader may still enjoy it.\n\nThe book really illustrates how choices shape our fate, as well as being an entertaining novel. It definitely has the ‘un-put-down-able’ factor, with all the right features to make it a must-buy!\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Forbidden Library | Django Wexler\n\nReviewed by Victoria Bowler, age 12\n\nEver heard about someone “getting deeply involved in a story book?”\n\nWell that’s exactly what happens to Alice, when she enters The Forbidden Library.\n\nAfter Alice becomes an orphan, she goes to live with “her Uncle Jerry,” in his large house. She is told the house rules, including never to enter the library. But that is just what she decides to do.\n\nShe never expected though, to find such weird and wonderful things. Cats that can talk, fairies, bird-like creatures, a tree sprite and even a dragon!\n\nWhenever Alice looks into one of the magical books, she gets drawn in and has to beat the creature inside. If she can capture it she can then use it for her own purposes.\n\nAlice wonders who she can trust as all the other Readers seem to have hidden agendas.\n\nWho would have thought reading a book could be so dangerous!!\n\nI found the book quite hard to put down, as i wanted to see which book and magical creature she was going to see next.\n\nI give the book 4 out of 5 stars.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nLockwood and Co. ~ The Screaming Staircase | Jonathan Stroud\n\nReviewd by Ella Nieper, age 13\n\nI found this book gripping and… truthfully, I didn’t want to turn my light off after reading this book, the ghosts really got me. I felt ghost-touched after reading it!\n\nLucy Carlyle, the narrator, arrives in London in search of a career in Psychic Investigations. She finds herself joining the smallest and the worst-off agency, but she doesn’t know that yet, run by Antony Lockwood and his co-founder, George Cubbins, without any adult supervisor. While charismatic, Lockwood and Lucy end up in a bush after one of their cases goes horribly wrong. Lockwood & Co. face extinction, until one huge chance arrives (unfortunately it involves them staying in the most haunted house in England, Combe Carey Hall), trying to escape alive.\n\nWill Lockwood and Co. live to see another day after being presented with the horrors of The Red Room and The Screaming Staircase?\n\nThis book is written in a humorous way. I really liked how we got to know Lucy first and the agency second or she might have been overshadowed by the other two characters – it provided me with a reason to care about what happened to her in the important case that Lockwood draws her into.\n\nThis should be read by children who love a tense and gripping book, I read it in under a week at school! Don’t get put off by the size of it!! I wanted it to be bigger! The only thing I could wish for is for the sequel to hurry up and come out sooner, I can’t wait until September.\n\nThis book I really could not put down, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nThe Amazing Maurice & His Educated Rodents | Terry Pratchett\n\nReviewed by Sophie Bowler, age 11\n\nThis book is about a boy (Keith), a cat (Maurice) and a gang of clever rats.\n\nThe cat & rats have eaten nuclear waste products and can now think and speak as a human. They meet up with an orphan boy (Keith) and decide to con money out of different towns, by getting Keith to act as a modern-day Pied Piper.\n\nThey hit trouble, when they enter Bad Blintz, a town with their own dodgy rat catchers. Danger is all around as they try to find out what really happened to the town’s rat population. Poison, traps, strange noises are about and they have to avoid them or end up being taken by the Bone Rat; The Grim Squeaker!!\n\nWill they find out the towns secrets and will all the rats survive the adventure?\n\nThe book starts well, but I thought it dragged on a bit in the middle.\n\nI give this book 3 ½ stars out of 5.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nEveryone A Stranger | Victor Watson\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 14\n\n1945 – At last a light can be seen from the tunnel of war. Soon all will return to normal; families will be reunited, peace will be made, life will return to as it was. Surely nothing could be wrong?\n\nMolly and Abigail have been friends forever in their little town of Great Deepening. Everyone has learned to live with strangers. Abigail’s cousin Ivy from London unexpectedly arrives to become a new permanent member of the family, and Molly’s father returns from the frontline, not expecting to find their evacuee friend Adam still in his house. Although knitted back together, things begin to fall apart.\n\nNot a soul has was left unchanged by war, and now everyone’s different vision of the future instigates controversy. Even close to the heart new people are vanishing as fast as appearing. When Adams precious pictures disappear, and others soon follow, it becomes clear that nothing is hidden or safe. As a mysterious stalker appears near Abigail’s house, and Ivy becomes even more clandestine, it seems no one is entirely trustworthy, and strangers may not be so strange at all…\n\nI found this book interesting. It was never too slow moving or confusing and was very enjoyable. I would probably deem it appropriate for age 9- 14.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nI, Coriander | Sally Gardener\n\nReviewed by Ruby Buckley-O’Sullivan, age 12\n\nCoriander Hobie has the most wonderful life; she has loving parents and beautiful clothes, a big house on the River Thames and plenty of friends.\n\nHowever, when a pair of silver shoes arrive with the letter ‘C’ embroidered into their soles, Coriander’s world gradually begins to tip upside down. Her mother becomes anxious and stressed, barely letting Coriander out of her sight. Then one day, a strange event occurs and her mother falls ill… this sickness kills her. Her father remarries to a woman with strong religious beliefs, who hates children – though has a child of her own.\n\nA truly gripping tale of love, loss, fear and hatred. Coriander must battle her way through her new life and learn to fight for everything that is still good. She is tossed through many strange events that all link together, including being forced to change her name by her stepmother, being pulled to another world and finding out a secret that has been kept from her all her life by her parents.\n\nSet in the 17th century, this moving tale had me hooked from the beginning and I am forever recommending it to all of my friends. I advise anybody who is eleven and over to read this book and they too can fall in love with Sally Gardener’s way with words. The only downside for me was the fact that some events were quite difficult to understand. So, I give this marvellous story, a 9 ½ out of 10.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Soc13ty of Thirteen | Gareth P. Jones\n\nReviewed by Ella Nieper, age 13\n\nThis book starts with Lord Silas Ringmore on the stage. He finds a book with mysterious symbols on the cover, and inside. He gathers together some friends; Sir Augustus Tyrell – MP, Harry Clay – magician, Mr John Symmonds – linguist, Mr G. Hayman – novelist. They form The Soc13ty of Thirteen searching for the magic hidden in the book.\n\nTom and Esther are orphans; they have been employed by Lord Ringmore to run errands for The Soc13ty of Thirteen.

They can disappear and can catch someone falling from a window high up using only their magical staff.\n\nRingmore and his society want to catch them in order to discover the secrets of the magic in the book. The chase is on. Who will survive the magical powers of Tom and Esther?\n\nThis book is a thrilling magical mystery. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy book that they cannot put down.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nOksa Pollock: The Last Hope | Cendrine Wolf & Anne Plichota\n\nReviewed by Sophie Bowler, age 11\n\nThis is a brilliant book, full of magic and very imaginative creatures and plants. I was gripped into the book after the very first paragraph! I read it as if I was Oksa and going on her adventures.\n\nOksa Pollock and her best friend, Gus, start a new secondary school in London, only to discover a totally horrible teacher who seems to hate them and does everything possible to upset them. Oksa goes home filled with anger and without warning she throws a fire ball across the room.\n\nBewildered by what she has just done, she is left curious, wondering what else she could do. When Oksa is at shool she is a totally different person, coping with stress typical of secondary school. When she realises she has powers, that any normal school girl hasn’t, school suddenly becomes more enjoyable.\n\nI was disappointed when I had finished the book as I was left wanting more of this magical tale.\n\nI would give it 5/5 because I really liked it and when you read it, I hope you do too.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nSpook’s: Slither’s Tale | Joseph Delaney\n\nReviewed by Egan Derrick, age 10\n\nThis is an interesting book filled with imaginary creatures and lots of fighting.\n\nWhen Slither shows Nessa her father’s will, she and her two sisters are forced to make a long journey. On their journey to safety they meet a witch assassin, who helps them survive the trial against the Haggenbrood… but she is full of tricks.\n\nWill she betray them? This is a very good book that I couldn’t put down and has inspired me to read the whole series.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone interested in scary stories probably aged 11-13.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nWARP ~ The Reluctant Assassin | Eoin Colfer\n\nReviewed by Rosalie Barrett Lawton, age 14\n\nWARP, the Reluctant Assassin, is the first in Eoin Colfer’s new series.\n\nHe describes it as a cross between ‘The Matrix’ and ‘Oliver Twist’. What he means is it’s partly about a victorian orphan, Rielly, and involves government secrets. It is set partly in Victorian London and partly in the modern day. The two protagonists are, Rielly, who is ‘The Reluctant Assassin’ and Chevie who is 16 and is working for the FBI. They are forced to work together to escape and ideally capture the notorious villain Garrick.\n\nWhile I was reluctunt to start reading this book, as adventure is not a genre I usually read, when I did start reading I found the plot engaging and surprising and found it difficult to put it down.\n\nEoin Colfer fans will not be disapointed with this series, because his writing is as funny and unique as always. As well as current fans, some other readers will also enjoy this more than his other works as it focuses more on science fiction.\n\nFor me this was an enjoyable read, however it is not something I would read again. Despite this, I can see that other readers will enjoy this more than I did. Therefore I would recommend this book.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nLockwood and Co. ~ The Screaming Staircase | Jonathan Stroud\n\nReviewed by Timothy Hand, age 15\n\nLockwood and Co. is a scary, exciting and intelligent book by Jonathan Stroud. It follows the adventures of Lockwood, a psychic investigator, and his assistants, Lucy and George, who must deal with paranormal occurrences in a world overrun by dangerous ghosts.\n\nAfter a disastrous case against the ghost of a murder victim, which threatens to destroy both Lockwood’s finances and reputation, Lockwood, Lucy and George are desperate to find a way to save their business. So, when they are offered a small fortune for staying overnight in a house, Lockwood jumps at the chance. The only drawback is that the house in question is a terrifying death trap that has led to the deaths of far more experienced psychic agents. Can the trio possibly survive?\n\nI thought Lockwood and Co was a great read. The characters are well developed and the spectres were extremely chilling (the scene in the ‘red room’ stands out especially). The story has a gripping mystery that runs throughout it, and has a very clever climax at the end. My only criticism is that like his previous books, Stroud struggles to decide what kind of world the book is set in. I found it difficult to decide whether the book was set in the present day or in Victorian times! Apart from that, the book is absolutely great! Highly recommended!\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nThe Summer of Telling Tales | Laura Summers\n\nReviewed by Bryony Adshead, age 13\n\nThis thought-provoking book will have you crying, laughing and shouting at it.\n\nThe Summer of Telling Tales is about two sisters – Grace and Ellie – their mum and their abusive dad. Grace, Ellie and their mum run away from their dad because he hits them and runs their lives. However, he has controlled the girls’ lives for too long and this has had serious effects on them. Ellie, for example, is a liar. When people ask her about her family she lies…and lies…and lies. Grace is silent; when people ask her about anything, she doesn’t say a word. Grace won’t speak to anyone, except Ellie. She won’t even speak to her mum.\n\nHowever, being away from their dad has positive effects on them. However slowly, they are definitely becoming ‘normal’.\n\nJust as the sisters are beginning to rebuild their lives, an unwanted visitor arrives to tell them that they can never escape him, however hard they try. Will Grace and Ellie be strong enough to tell someone who can help the one thing no one will believe – the truth?\n\nThis is a great story that I really enjoyed. I would recommend it to all my friends and hope that, after you have read it, you will recommend it to all of yours!\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nBedlam | Ally Kennen\n\nReviewed by Ella Nieper, age 13\n\nBedlam is the third chilling teen novel by Ally Kennen. It is a very exciting and tense novel, and because I loved it so much, I now would like to read the two books before it.\n\nThis thrilling tale follows Lexi, and her time spent at her Mum’s house. Lexi’s Mum has got a new boyfriend who has just proposed to her and Lexi’s mum has agreed, so wedding plans are happening. Lexi does not get on with Owen (her mum’s fiancé) or her Mum that much, so she goes to her house with a plan to get closer to her Mum.\n\nWhen Lexi’s Mum and Owen have gone to work, Lexi lets their dog, Tyson, outside, but he doesn’t come back. That same night, Owen and Lexi go out looking for him in the nearby woods and she finds herself being bitten by dogs, then almost drowning, but all of a sudden, someone comes to Lexi’s aid and saves her. When Lexi wakes up, she finds herself wrapped in a blanket with some food beside her. At once Lexi is determined to find whoever saved her and thank them.\n\nOn her hunt to find her saviour Lexi discovers that there was once an old asylum in the woods, so it seems to Lexi that her saviour came from the mental asylum, but this does not deter Lexi, as she is still determined to find them.\n\nLexi then finds something out about her Dad, so it seems to her that she will be staying a little longer. Lexi gets a job in the kitchens of the hotel her Mum works in, and meets a girl named Ella and a boy named Jak, who from then on become Lexi’s companions.\n\nWhen Lexi meets her saviour it then becomes a chase of life and death.\n\nThis is a truly thrilling book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a tense, adventure book. I read it in two days as it was so good, I could not put it down!\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nFearless | Cornelia Funke\n\nReviewed by Rosalie Barrett Lawton, age 14\n\n‘Fearless’ is the second and latest book in the ‘Mirrorworld’ series. In ‘Reckless’, the first book in the series, we are introduced to the fantasy world behind Jacob’s father’s mirror. Now, in ‘Fearless’, Jacob battles to save his own life.\n\nIn a world full of mystery, magic and menace, treasure-hunter Jacob Reckless faces his fear of death. With only two months before a fairy’s supposedly unbreakable curse will kill him, he and Fox, his shape-shifting friend and companion, search desperately for a way to save his life.\n\nHaving read ‘Reckless’ already, I was ecstatic to hear of the sequel. ‘Reckless’ ends on a massive cliffhanger and I was desperate to find out what happened next. I adored ‘Reckless’ and ‘Fearless’ did not disappoint. The high standards set by the fist book were matched, if not raised.\n\nI love the way this book delves more into the history of the mirrorworld, as well as introducing more characters and magical creatures. I found the detail and back-stories extremely interesting, and while there was a lot of explanation it never distacted from the plot.\n\nThe mirrorworld truly does mirror our own. There is no clear enemy. No black and white. Even in a world full of magic the people still shun its natural wonders in favour of new technology and progression. The way she outlines these issues is subtle, yet effective.\n\nThe plot has many surprises, especially toward the end. You will never know what to expect next. The ending is perfect, complete and satisfying, yet will leave you longing for the next book.\n\nWhile ‘Fearless’ does make sense on its own, I would recommend reading ‘Reckless’ first, simply because it is such an amazing book.I would recommend ‘Fearless’ to any teenager, especially fantasy fans and I’m sure you will enjoy it as much as I did!\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nDear Scarlett | Fleur Hitchcock\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 12\n\nMy first impressions of this book was – wow, what an engrossing first chapter!\n\nIt is exactly the sort of book I am drawn to.\n\nIt starts with eleven year old Scarlett, who is well known throughout the village for her father- the notorious jewel thief Richard McNally. But her Dad has been dead for five years now. Scarlett leads a normal life until shortly after her birthday, when a solicitor turns up with a mystery box for her. A gift from her Dad. Inside is a book, fragments of special memories, postcards, all with secret clues … Revealing that he may not have been a criminal after all…\n\nWith her new friend, Ellie, she sets about on a treasure chase. Will their prize will be the rumoured diamonds?\n\nAfter the suspicious arrival of the new mayoress and her brother, things start to become arduous.\n\nWill they solve the trail of clues and find the truth before its too late?\n\nThis is my new favourite book, and I genuinely have no criticism for it and couldn’t put it down! I would consider it best for children aged around 9-15.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nA Month With April-May | Edyth Bulbring\n\nReviewed by Bryony Adshead, age 13\n\nThis book really wasn’t my cup of tea, although I’m sure the realistic characters and their crazy exploits will appeal to many readers.\n\nI found the main character, April-May, annoying, because she always seemed to make the wrong decisions and end up hurting someone. She is nasty to the people who are nicest to her, and nice to the people who are nasty to everyone else! April-May does get into some very amusing circumstances though, such as losing her entire wardrobe to a hobo, then having to wear lost property school uniform, and thinking the school’s bad boy is Edward, the vampire from Twilight, her favourite book. Mrs Ho, a teacher at Trinity College (April-May’s school), hates her and tells her she has the wrong bag, the wrong socks, uniform, book, friends…do I need to say April-May hates her? So what should she do when Mrs Ho and her dad get together? And should April-May stay friends with loser Melly? Will she get expelled from Trinity College? Although I didn’t like the book, others may, so read away!\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Feathered Man | Jeremy De Quidt\n\nReviewed by Ella Nieper, age 13\n\nThe Feathered Man is set in a German town, where, Klaus, is a tooth-puller’s boy. The tooth-puller, Kusselmann, takes a diamond from a dead man’s mouth. It is not Klaus’s fault that he sees his master take this rare beauty. Unfortunately for Klaus, he finds the diamond in his pocket, and also finds out that there are several people after it. A Jesuit Priest and his companion are looking for it, also a Professor of Anatomy takes an interest. There is even a young girl looking for it, to give it to her mistress, Frau Drecht.\n\nThere is something else that the Professor and the Priest both seek. An object that is centuries old, dead and still alive. This mysterious object is the connection between the living and the dead.\n\nThe Feathered Man is an exciting story about an ancient curse, science and murders. This is a tense read that I would recommend highly to anyone who likes an adventure and a lot of suspense!\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nThe Great Galloon | Tom Banks\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 12\n\nThe opening of this fantasy book is quite confusing; it is difficult to grasp who the characters are. I was tempted to put it down, but it soon gets very exciting! Stanley and Rasmussen live on the Great Galloon, a giant hot air ship manned by Captain Anstruther. The story begins on Captain Anstruther’s wedding day. After his brother makes a retreat with his darling bride, the crew is left in the hands of a coward, Able Skyman Abel. Soon after, ear-wrenchingly loud, mysterious noises arise from somewhere in the ship. Stanley knows that Skyman Abel will not solve it, so he and Rasmussen set of into the depths of the Galloon to investigate…\n\nMeanwhile, a swarm of deathly behemoths attack the vessel, chewing through the hearty structure of the ship. Can Stanley and Rasmussen solve the mystery in time to save the Galloon from destruction?\n\nI would recommend this adventurous book for 8 – 13 year olds.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nInsignia | S.J. Kincaid\n\nReviewed by Timothy Hand, age 14\n\nInsignia is an exciting and original novel set in a brilliantly-imagined alternative future world, where wars are fought by giant machines in space to avoid casualties. It’s full of interesting and realistic characters, thrilling scenes set in the virtual world and some hilarious moments.\n\nThe story follows the adventures of Tom Raines, a homeless boy who is forced to spend his time using his expertise at video games to win money to look after his father, a bankrupt gambler. When the US government learn of Tom’s quick reflexes and killer instinct, he is offered the chance of training at the Pentagonal Spire, and contribute to the war effort. While training at the Spire, Tom learns about Medusa, the leader of the opposition’s forces, and becomes obsessed with finding a way to do what no-one else has managed to do… defeat Medusa.\n\nInsignia was a great read. Tom and his group of quirky friends were easy to get to know, and other characters, like the odious Dalton Prestwick, the rich boyfriend of Tom’s estranged Mum, were absolutely hateful! The future world that the story was set in was very interesting and the author’s idea of wars being run by rich companies instead of countries and fought in space was really original. Despite the heartbreaking ending (read it if you want to find out) I thought Insignia was a good book, and I think you should consider reading it!\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nWitch Crag | Kate Cann\n\nReviewed by Ella Nieper, age 13\n\nWitch Crag is an exciting book, full of drama about Kita’s perilous journey to Witch Crag and the dangerous battle that follows.\n\nKita, Raff and Quainy originally lived with the Sheepmen where basic survival is the only priority. There are four tribes: the Sheepmen, the Horsemen, the Witches and the Farmers. In the beginning Kita, Raff and Quainy travel through the woods using Kita’s powers to guide them. Everyone at Hill Fort (the Sheepmen’s home) believed that Witch Crag across the valley is full of terrifying witches.

The tribes must somehow overcome their prejudices and join together if they are to win a war that threatens to destroy everything they hold as good.\n\nI would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good tense read and if you love The Hunger Games you will certainly love this book.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nThe Look | Sophia Bennett\n\nReviewed by Bryony Adshead, age 13\n\nThe Look is a moving story about Ted and her sister, who is dealing with cancer.\n\nTed is ‘like a lampost: tall and skinny, with frizzy, bush-like hair…definitely not model material. Ava, her sister, on the other hand, is drop-dead gorgeous. She looks like a movie star: shiny, dark hair, pretty, average height, slim…definitely model material. So when Ted gets spotted by a model scout, Ava and her both think it must be a scam. They forget about it until Ava is diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAva wants Ted to be a model…but can Ted be a model and a model sister, or will she have to choose between the two?\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nWhere She Went | Gayle Forman\n\nReviewed by Charlotte Lightwood, age 12\n\nWhere she went is the astounding sequel to the book If I Stay. It is an amazing follow-up and, dare I say it, I do believe I prefered this book to If I Stay. It follows Mia and Adam’s story, as did If I Stay, but this time in Adam’s point of view. Even though it was in Adam’s point of view, instead of Mia’s, it was a very similar perspective and writing style, which I really enjoyed. There are some things different to this book though, as there is less about death and dying, which is probably one of the many reasons why it’s more enjoyable.\n\nIn this book it explores Adam’s thoughts and emotions about Mia, but unlike most love stories, it does not develop over a long period of time, as Mia and Adam only have the night to “catch up” and make some decisions… which you’ll have to read the book to find out about.\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nThe Great Escape | Megan Rix\n\nReviewed by Amy Punchard, age 12\n\nI have to admit, when I started this book I was a little doubtful of how good it was, however the further you read the more gripping it gets.\n\nRose, Tiger and Buster are just normal pets; Playing fetch with Robert, burying Mr Edward’s slippers, and curling up on Lucy’s bed at night. When war is announced in 1939, Mr and Mrs Edwards leave the house to help with the war effort. Their children, Robert and Lucy, are sent to stay with their mad Gran in Devon. The pets are sent down the road to stay with Mr and Mrs Harris. But along with 400,000 other pet owners Mr Harris takes them to be put down. Sensing death, Rose leads Buster and Tiger on a long and dangerous journey to the Devonshire farm she grew up on.\n\nVarious encounters split them up along the way- Rose is taken on a gypsy barge, Buster is taken as a search and rescue dog, and Tiger spends a few days with Cat-loving Winston Churchill!\n\nWill they find their way back to each other?\n\nWill the family be reunited once more…\n\nThis book is emotionally enthralling and I really enjoyed this book.I would consider it suitable for kids aged 10-13.\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nThe Worst Thing About My Sister | Jacqueline Wilson\n\nReviewed by Bryony Adshead, age 12\n\nThe Worst Thing About My Sister is a funny, moving tale about two sisters who are as opposite as the North and South Pole. Some parts of it will have you laughing-out-loud and some will have you in tears, but why would you expect anything less when it’s written by Jacqueline Wilson? This isn’t my favourite story by her, but I still really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a sister they don’t get on with!\n\nMarty, the main character, is sick and tired of her perfect, prissy, pink, Barbie-doll sister, Melissa. When their Mum’s dressmaking business takes an unexpected turn, the sisters are forced to share a room. Needless to say, it just makes them hate each other even more, something their parents didn’t even think was possible! However, when a devastating accident occurs, Marty and Melissa need to overcome their differences and be friends…or the consequences could be dire!\n\n………………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nGods & Warriors | Michelle Paver\n\nReviewed by Hannah Cherry, age 14\n\nThis book is set in the Mediterranean Bronze Age, with the main character being Hylas, an ‘Outsider’ to the mountains of Lykonia, where he lives and works as a goatherd. The story begins with Hylas and his sister Issi (also an Outsider) having just been split up following an attack on their camp from a group of black, fierce warriors that Hylas names the Crows. He quickly learns that the Crows are after outsiders, but we don’t learn why until further on in the book. After this attack, Hylas is forced to flee the mountains in an attempt to escape the Crows and find Issi. This is portrayed to be Hylas’ main goal throughout the book. Whilst running from the Crows, Hylas meets a Keftian man, who gives him a bronze dagger, and tells him to go to the sea, which he does.\n\nLater on in the book, the story focuses on another important character, Pirra, the daughter of The Keftian High Priestess, who is very rich and wealthy. Pirra comes from Keftiu, and she and Hylas are opposite ends of the spectrum, not just in lifestyles, but also in personalities. Both characters eventually end up on a island together, and it turns out that they are both attempting to escape something (Pirra is trying to runaway from an arranged marriage for the benefit of Keftiu and Hylas from the Crows). This means both characters have to adapt and work together to survive in the somewhat harsh conditions they have been thrown into.\n\nPirra and Hylas become friends as the story progresses, meeting a dolphin, an odd stranger, and find shelter in a not so welcoming cave. Eventually comes a clash with the Crows, which was my favourite part. I really enjoyed this book, and I would definitely recommend it to teenagers. At first I thought I wouldn’t be able to understand the plot because it was set in a different time period, but actually this didn’t make any difference to how much I liked reading this book. The book has a brilliant ending too, which really gets you wondering what you would do in a certain character’s situation. A very good read, and in all honesty I don’t think I could pick fault with it.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………\n\nThe Emerald Atlas | John Stephens\n\nReviewed by Rosalie Barrett Lawton, age 12\n\nThe Emerald Atlas is the first book in a series by John Stephens.
