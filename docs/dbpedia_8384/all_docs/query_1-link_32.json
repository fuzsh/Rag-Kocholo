        "text": "Kant’s Dreams of a Spirit Seer has puzzled most of its readers since its publication in 1766. Herder complained in general terms about the lack of unity and coherence of the book as well as Kant’s dialectical method of presenting both sides of a problem without offering his own solution. Mendelssohn was in doubt about whether Kant wanted to ridicule metaphysics or make a case for Swedenborg’s visions. Another exegetical puzzle has not been noted yet: Dreams discusses not one, but three different versions of a ‘metaphysics of spirits’. All of them are mutually incompatible. In other words, the two versions of a metaphysics of spirits that Kant criticises in the first part of the book are both of them different from Swedenborg’s own claims, as they are discussed in the second part. And the two versions discussed within the first part are not homogeneous, either: the metaphysics discussed in the first chapter of the first part (the ‘tangled knot’) and those that seem to form the foundation for the second chapter of the first part (the ‘fragment of occult philosophy’) are again incompatible. And neither of them fits with what Kant analyses as Swedenborg’s metaphysical position in the second part: The position of the ‘tangled knot’ can tentatively be labelled as ‘crypto-materialist’. Swedenborg’s own position is characterised in the text as ‘idealist’. The ‘fragment of occult philosophy’ in contrast is probably best described as ‘dualist’. If this diagnosis is correct, it reinforces Herder’s complaints about the lack of coherence of Dreams as well as Mendelssohn’s worry about its targets. And it adds the additional challenge to explain how there can be a ‘crypto-materialist’ metaphysics of spirit-seeing. I propose to weaken the impact of these problems by identifying a second target of Kant’s scorn in Dreams – a metaphysical position Kant could be sympathetic with as far as its fundamental intentions are concerned, but that draws his ire because of an equally comprehensive failure in the realisation of these intentions. This target is Georg Friedrich Meier who published the second edition of his metaphysics in 1765, one year before the publication of Dreams.\n\nThis article surveys the different ways in which Kant scholars have read and interpreted Dreams of a Spirit-Seer. While the anti-metaphysical reading and the self-critical reading have come to dominate interpretations of the text, I contend that both readings misrepresent the context in which Dreams of a Spirit-Seer was written and the structure of Kant’s arguments. When these factors are considered, it becomes apparent that Dreams of a Spirit-Seer is closely related to another work Kant was preparing at the time, which he called The Proper Method of Metaphysics. Instead of being an attack on metaphysics or a repudiation of Kant’s pre-critical philosophy, Dreams of a Spirit-Seer is a cautionary tale about how not to do metaphysics, which was supposed to complement the positive account of the correct approach to metaphysics that he still hoped to publish in the late 1760s.\n\nThe decline of mythopoeic thought, and in the widest sense 'religious' thought, is clearly traceable in the period we name as the Enlightenment, or more exactly the European scientific Enlightenment, roughly from the middle of the 17 th to the end of the 18 th centuries. The decline has been put down to a variety of cultural and economic determinants. It depends on no single body of proofs or disproofs, and no single line of historical explanation appears satisfactory, but from the point of view of a concern with mythopoeic thought we observe that amongst the educated elite there occurs a transformation of attitude to the supernatural and the spiritual. God may still be the absolute author of the scheme of things, but has been removed from day-today involvement in his creation. Christianity survives, but is valued increasingly for its moral and ethical revelation, beyond its catalogue of miracles. There is a turning away from magical explanations for natural phenomena, and an increasing confidence in mankind's own rational powers of invention, encouraged by 'the triumph of the mechanical philosophy.' 1 Underpinning the development of the new attitude is a reorientation in the validation of thought itself. Freed from the shackles of traditional religious authority, an objectivist mode that is at once empirical and analytic is given pride of place. This reorientation may be seen in the context of a renaissance debate that may be traced back to classical antiquity, but it becomes a defining component of the scientific revolution. One of its primary tasks is to complete the overthrow of the authority and meaningfulness of symbolism, relegating it to subjectivity and an epistemologically secondary status. 2 1 Keith Thomas (1978) p.769; but see also Tambiah (1990). This observation from Thomas is certainly pertinent to Kant's philosophy, which is to a significant degree moulded by his admiration for the scientific method of his day, epitomised in Newtonian physics. Discussing the decline of magic and divination in England, Thomas (pp.791-2) observes that 'the change which occurred in the seventeenth century was thus not so much technological as mental.' It involved 'the emergence of a new faith in the potentialities of human initiative.' Tambiah (pp.18-24) gives a useful summary of criticisms of the Kuhnian 'paradigm shift' interpretation proposed by Thomas; the fact remains that something quite remarkable and unprecedented happened in European culture such that, in terms of educated opinion, the possibility of a divinatory mode of symbolic interpretation becomes open to widespread derision by the time of Kant where it would be open to consideration at the time of Ficino. Astrology is a bellwether of the changing intellectual climate; the social and political dimension of the decline of educated astrology in England in the latter part of the 17th century is extensively discussed in Curry (1989). 2 The declining authority of symbol is a principal theme in Vickers (1984)."
