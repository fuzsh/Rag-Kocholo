Dr. George Dole\n\nThe Universe and I: Where Science & Spirituality Meet offers scholar and theologian George F. Dole's thought-provoking insights on the dynamic nature of the ongoing science and religion debate. Why are we here? Where are we headed? Dole argues that to understand these questions, we need not only the grounding of science but also the insights of spirit.\n\nAs experts continue to work out the relationship between cosmology and human evolution, Dole, who has spent a lifetime making sense of the spiritual world, joins the conversation with a clarity that only he can provide. Shaped primarily as a response to the scientific community, he engages with a wide spectrum of thinkers, including Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins, and eighteenth-century polymath Emanuel Swedenborg, just to name a few.\n\nAccessing a wealth of knowledge from across a wide variety of disciplines--philosophy, religion, biology, physics, and more--Dole presents his own model for our physical and spiritual existence. Starting with what we don't know and what we can observe about the fundamentals of existence, Dole explores \"the creative tension between differentiation and integration\"--the drive to be individual and yet be united to a greater whole, a tension whose persistent progress since the Big Bang has brought about such gifts as the emergence of life and consciousness.\n\nDole not only presents us with the empirical evidence of science but also provides us with a first-person understanding of the spiritual dimension and how it might inform the way we consider those grand speculations on the meaning of the universe and of life. Reflecting on how life began leads to questions of how we will continue to advance humanity and goodwill for all--both as a species and as individuals striving for personal growth.\n\nAsking the question \"How can I, infinitesimal I, have the gall to regard myself as significant in the context of the universe?\", Dole embarks on a journey that spans the life of the universe itself, making every effort along the way to answer this question--for all of us.\n\nSwedenborg's Secret, a biography by Lars Bergquist\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was one of the greatest figures of the Enlightenment. A member of Sweden's ruling elite, he was also an innovative philosopher and scientist, making a thorough study of human anatomy and physiology. As an inventor his discoveries ranged from a method of finding terrestrial longitude to new ways of constructing docks and even designs for the submarine and airplane. In 1743, he underwent a dramatic spiritual awakening; thereafter his studies were increasingly directed towards what he had seen and heard among spirits and angels. It is these experiences that inspired a host of prominent writers, poets and artists from William Blake to Ralph Waldo Emerson and to August Strindberg, to name a few. \"Swedenborg's Secret\" is the first definitive, full-length biography in the past fifty years.\n\nThis immensely readable and authoritative work sets Swedenborg in the context of the declining power that was 18th century Sweden. In a fresh, lucid account, packed with insights and a detailed exploration of Swedenborg's core ideas, Lars Bergquist reveals how this 'man of two worlds' not only played an active part in the political life of his nation, but also set out in works such as Heaven and Hell, The New Jerusalem, and The True Christian Religion, a stunning vision of human destiny.\n\n'...Swedenborg is the wonderful Restorer of the long lost secret'. And what was this secret? It is the opening of the gate. It is the sure knowledge that nature and the material world are the vessels of eternity. - Peter Ackroyd, \"Blake.\"\n\nThe Arms of Morpheus: Essays on Swedenborg and Mysticism, edited by Stephen McNeilly\n\n\"Somewhat surprisingly, given the length and detail of his visionary experiences, the name of Emanuel Swedenborg has remained largely absent from the mystical tradition,\" writes editor Stephen McNeilly.\n\n\"R.W. Emerson, in 1850, was the first to offer a positive analysis–situating Swedenborg, via Paracelsus, Madame Guyon and Jacob Boehme, in a long line beginning with the Church Fathers–but apart from this, very few discussions can be found within the tradition itself.\n\nW.H. Auden, in his essay 'Four Kinds of Mystical Experience', mentions him briefly as 'rather hard to swallow,' whilst notable writers and editors such as Evelyn Underhill, William James and Richard Woods overlook him. Perhaps most crushingly, Immanuel Kant dismissed him altogether as the 'arch visionary of all visionaries' and his work as the ravings of an 'enthusiast.'\n\nKant's attack has cast a long shadow over Swedenborg's reputation and influence, of which 'the mere invocation of the name of Immanuel Kant is sufficient to permit complete dismissal of the viewpoint, experience and reasoning of Emanuel Swedenborg.\"\n\nThe essays in this book by Czeslaw Milosz, Ariel Hessayon, Gary Lachman, Richard Lines, Reuben Bell, James Wilson, and Jose´Antonio Anton Pacheoco situate Swedenborg more clearly in the mystical tradition, drawing parallels with other mystics and esoteric movements.\n\n10 Commandments:The Secrets of Spiritual Growth Found in God's Principles for Living\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg states unequivocally that the Ten Commandments are the most important part of the Bible. Encapsulated in ten simple statements is everything we need to know about how to live, love, and grow as spiritual people.\n\nOne of the fundamentals of Swedenborg's theology is the concept that underlying the literal text of the Bible is an inner spiritual meaning. Using this method of interpretation, Swedenborg peels back the layers of the Ten Commandments to reveal a cohesive set of teachings with both practical applications and far-reaching spiritual implications.\n\nAlthough Swedenborg discusses the Ten Commandments in many places throughout his writings, he wrote four extended commentaries on the subject in four separate volumes: Secrets of Heaven, True Christianity, the short work Life, and the posthumously published Revelation Explained. Those four commentaries are now being combined in a single volume for the first time, allowing the reader to compare and contrast Swedenborg's approach across a seventeen-year span.\n\nThis book offers a new insight for spiritual seekers and students of Swedenborg alike, illuminating what is at once a familiar set of biblical teachings and one of the cornerstones of Swedenborg's system of personal growth.\n\nThe Lord by Emanuel Swedenborg\n\nSince the dawn of Christianity, there has been debate about the true nature of Jesus Christ. Was he a divinely inspired person or the incarnation of God on earth?\n\nIn his short work The Lord, Swedenborg presents an answer to the time-honored question of how Jesus and God are related: he argues that they became in every way one and the same. Throughout his works Swedenborg uses the term “Lord” to refer to Jesus as the embodiment of God. In this work he emphasizes that the traditional trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit should be thought of not as three separate divine Persons that have always coexisted but as three aspects now present within one divine Person—Jesus in his resurrection.\n\nThe Lord also touches upon key themes in Swedenborg’s theology: the spiritual reasons why the Lord came to earth; the significance of the death and resurrection of his human form; and the ways in which his coming was foretold in the Old Testament. Throughout the book, Swedenborg provides extensive biblical references to support his arguments. He concludes with a brief chapter describing the New Jerusalem, a reference to both the city described in the book of Revelation and the new spiritual age that is now unfolding.\n\nThe Lord is part of the New Century Edition of the Works of Emanuel Swedenborg (NCE), an ongoing translation series. The NCE series incorporates the latest scholarship and translation standards for a more accurate and accessible rendering of Swedenborg’s works. Traditionally titled The Doctrine of the Lord, this short work is often published together with three other short works—Life, Faith, and Sacred Scripture—under the title The Four Doctrines. The Swedenborg Foundation will publish these four titles together in the forthcoming NCE hardcover annotated volume The Shorter Works of 1763.\n\nSince the dawn of Christianity, there has been debate about the true nature of Jesus Christ.
