        "text": "Swedish philosopher, theologian, chemist, anatomist, and mystic, fluent in eleven languages. Emanuel Swedenborg devoted the first half of his life to scientific investigations. Thereafter he turned his full attention to theology, metaphysics and started to explore mystical experience. Among Swedenborg's most popular books are Heaven and Hell and Earths in Universe. His spiritual writing influenced Emerson, Goethe, Henry James Sr., Dostoevsky, and William Blake. During his career, Swedenborg published over 50 works. His books have been translated into some thirty languages.\n\n1. There are two worlds, a spiritual world where angels and spirits are, and a natural world where men are. 2. In each world there is a sun, and the Sun of the spiritual world is pure love from Jehovah God, who is in the midst of it; and from that Sun proceed heat and light, the heat proceeding from it is in its essence love, and the light is in its essence wisdom; and these two affect the will and understanding of man, the heat his will, and the light his understanding. But the sun of the natural world is pure fire, and therefore its heat and light are dead, and serve as clothing and aids to spiritual heat and light, by which they may be conveyed to man. (from The True Christian Religion, containing The Universal Theology of the New Church by Emanuel Swedenborg,, London: Swedenborg Society, 1932, p. 87)\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg was born in Stockholm, the second son of Jesper Svedberg (1653-1735), a Lutheran bishop and hymn writer, and Sara Behm. Both families had acquired wealth in the mining business. Swedenborg's mother died in 1696 and his father married again. Because of his sermons against abuse of power, Jesper Svedberg was feared by the royal court, and loved by people who believed he had powers as an exorciser.\n\nFrom the age of eleven to twenty-one Swedenborg studied mechanics, geography, astronomy, and mathematics at the University of Uppsala. It has been said that about the age of eighteen, while he was visiting the University of Lund, Swedenborg was initiated for the first time into the mysteries of Freemasonery. Upon graduation he travelled to Holland, Germany and England. The English authorities believed that plague had broken in Sweden, and his ship was obliged to wait offshore for six weeks. Swedenborg went ashore anyway, was caught and very nearly hanged. He lived in England from 1710 to 1713, and formed a lasting love for its culture. \"But as the English are not very talkative, he fell into the habit of conversing with devils and Angels,\" said the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges (The Book of Imaginary Beings, 1969). During his stay, Swedenborg acquired knowledge of Kabbalistic and esoteric \"sciences,\" which influenced his mystical-spiritualistic thought.\n\nIn 1716 King Charles XII of Sweden named Swedenborg special assessor to the Royal College of Mines. He worked in several scientific fields from mathematics and physics to geology, and twice attempted to marry. Swedenborg's career also included extensive service in the upper house of the Swedish national legislature. Moreover, he possibly participated in secret political, diplomatic, and Masonic affairs. In 1716-1718 Swedenborg edited the scientific magazine Daedalus Hyperboreus, which published texts in Swedish.\n\nMost of his own books Swedenborg published in Latin. The Principia (1934) explained the universe from a mechanistic viewpoint, Opera Philosophica et Mineralia (1734) was about metals; in Regnum Animale (1744-45) Swedenborg examined the mysteries of soul; De Cultu et Amore Dei (1745, Worship and the Love of God) dealt with the birth of the world; and Arcana Coelestia (1749-1756) was a commentary on Genesis. In his spiritual diary Swedenborg mentions the German Pietist theologian and alchemist Johann Konrad Dippel (1673-1734) several times. \"It was thought that Dippel possessed the ability of seeing things accurately . . . Upon being examined, however, it was found that he was unable to see any truth, nay, the reality of anything, and that he was only skilled defaming others.\" (Documents Concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg: Volume 2:1-2 by Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel, 1877, p. 1139) Swedenborg even called him \"the wickest of demons.\" Dippel claimed in his dissertation, Vitæ animalis morbus et medicina: Suæ vindicata origini (1711), published under the pseudonym Christiano Democrito, that he had discovered the Elixir of Life. With the the pigment merchant Johann Jacob von Diesbach, he invented a new blue pigment, 'Prussian Blue,' which became the favorite of a number of artist. It can be seen, among others, in Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night' (1889).\n\nAs an inventor Swedenborg produced a dry dock of new design, a machine for working salt springs, and a system for moving large boats overland. In biology he supplied the first accurate understanding of the importance of the cerebral cortex. But the conflict between Swedenborg's scientific and mediumistic sides deepened and he started to record his dreams, anticipating Jungian psychoanalysis in his self-analysis.\n\nLike Leonardo da Vinci, Swedenborg made plans for a flying machine, in spite that there was nobody to build it. Swedenborg launched his idea in the fourth issue of The Northern Inventor (1717): \"But if we follow the living nature, examining the proportions that the wings of a bird holds to its body, a similar mechanism might be invented, which should give us hope to be able to follow the bird in the air.\"\n\nA turning point in his life was, when he began to have visionary experiences in 1743-45. Swedenborg then devoted himself to prophesy and spiritual investigations. On the morning of October 1743 he noted in Amsterdam that \"such dizziness or deliquium (a swooning away) overcame me that I felt close to death.\" In a dream a roaring wind picked him up and threw him on his face. A hand clutched his own clasped hand and he saw Christ. Vicious dogs turned up frequently, and his dead father appeared to him, praising his son's theological work. In 1744 on Easter Monday Christ asked the astonished visionary, whether he had a health certificate.\n\nSwedenborg described in De Telluribus his trip around the Solar System, which is seen as having a spiritual significance. The book also contains some scientific speculation about the planets. Swedenborg became convinced that he had been designated by God as a spiritual emissary to explore higher planes and to report his findings to humankind. He entered ecstatic trances, visiting heaven and hell. However, contemporaries found him sane and sensible.\n\nIn modern analysis Swedenborg's trances have been explained by his repressed or transcended sexuality. The American psychologist and writer Wilson Van Dusen has claimed that Swedenborg's descriptions of angelic and hellish spirits match the hallucinatory experiences of schizophrenics. Van Dusen spent sixteen years treating the hallucinations of his patients as realities, and published his findings in The Presence of Other Worlds (1974). According to Van Dusen, \"All Swedenborg's observations on the effect of evil spirits entering man's consciousness conform to my finding.\" Of the inhabitants of Venus Swedenborg said: \"They are of two kinds; some are gentle and benevolent, others wild, cruel and of gigantic stature.\" Of the Moon he revealed that the inhabitants are \"small, like children of six or seven years old; at the same time they have the strength of men like ourselves.\"\n\nIn 1747 Swedenborg was nominated for president of the Royal College of Mines. Communication with spirits led to his resignation from his government job. Later on he wrote to the landgrave of Hessen-Darmstadt: \"Because the Lord had prepared me for this from childhood, he revealed himself in person to me, his servant, and ordered me to perform this work. This happened in the year 1743, and afterward he showed me the face of my spirit and thus led me into the world of the spirits and allowed me to see heaven and its wonders, and at the same time to see hell as well, and also to speak with angels and spirits, and this has gone on continually for twenty-seven years.\"\n\nSwedenborg retired on a half-pension. He became ascetic and added theological writings to his already lengthy list of scientific and philosophical works. His talents also included clairvoyance. On the evening of July 19, 1759, he was visiting Göteborg. At a party, he suddenly \"knew\" that a fire raged in Stockholm, almost three hundred miles away, and threatened his own house. Next day his account of the disaster was fully confirmed.\n\n\"When, for instance, the vision arose in Swedenborg's mind of a fire in Stockholm, there was a real fire raging there at the same time, without there being any demonstrable or even thinkable connection between the two. I certainly would not like to undertake to prove the archetypal connection in this case. I would only point to the fact that in Swedenborg's biography there are certain things which throw a remarkable light on his psychic state. We must assume that there was a lowering of the threshold of consciousness which gave him access to \"absolute knowledge.\" The fire in Stockholm was, in a sense, burning in him too.\" (Carl Jung in Synchronicity, 1960)\n\nIn 1762 Swedenborg went into a trance and described the assassination of the Russian Tsar Peter III. His publications from this visionary period include Worship and the Love of God, Arcana Coelestia, an exposition of the spirit teachings he received, and Heaven and Hell (1758), description of the afterlife. Arcana Coelestia was personally funded by the French King Louis XVI. In Earths in the Universe Swedenborg claimed that the moon is peopled by a race which speaks through its stomachs – the sound is like belching.\n\nContemporaries took Swedenborg's psychic powers seriously: he impressed Queen Louisa Ulrica, sister of Frederick the Great, by delivering a private message from her dead brother, Augustus William. He believed he had the ability to slow down his breathing. \"I became so completely accustomed to this type of respiration,\" he once said, \"that I sometimes passed an entire hour without taking a breath. I had breathed in only enough air so that I could think.\" Occasionally he conversed with such prominent figures as Abraham, Solomon, and the apostles.\n\nHis later years Swedenborg spent mostly in England, remaining a bachelor. His writings, which influenced William Blake (1757-1827), paved the way for the Romantic movement. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) criticized Swedenborg in Dreams of a Spirit-Seer, Illustrated by Dreams of Metaphysics (1766), and wanted to place him in a madhouse. His last work, Vera Christiana Religio (1771) was a summary of his religious views. Swedenborg died in a lodging house on March 29, 1772 – precisely at the time he had predicted – in London, and was bried in the Swedish Church in Prince's Square. Swedenborg's cranium had an adventurous afterlife: it was stolen by a phrenologist, John Didrik Holm, and later it was passed in the possession of William Blake's friend, Charles Augustus Tulk, a member of the parliament. Rosicrucian claimed that Swedenborg had discovered the elixir of youth and still lived in some hidden place of the world.\n\nSwedenborg's remains were moved to Uppsala in 1908. His followers founded the New Jerusalem Church in England in 1778 and in the United States in 1792. James Glen formed in 1784 a Swedenborgian reading circle in Philadelphia. The Swedenborg Society was established in 1810. During the 19th century Swedenborgians enjoyed a considerable vogue, but in the 20th century the interest has decreased.\n\nSwedenborg believed that God created humankind to exist simultaneously in the physical world and in the spiritual world, which belongs to the inner domain. It has its own memory, which is what survives after death. Swedenborg's hell has no Satan; heaven is populated by the spirits of the dead that carry on lives and habits much the same as they did on earth. Jesus' crucifixion did not atone for the sins of humankind; we make our own heaven and hell. He believed that there is a correspondence between natural and spiritual levels; each person lives in both realms at once. Eternal life is an inner condition beginning with earthly life; gradual redemption occurs through personal regulation of spiritual states. Practical love is a necessity in every relationship.\n\nAfter one of his consultations with angels, Swedenborg declared that the end of the world was to arrive in 1757. He never doubted his insights and afterwards, rejecting traditional doctrines of the Trinity and Atonement, Swedenborg insisted that the Last Judgment had really occurred in 1757 in the heavens, along with Christ's second coming as a triumph over rebellious spirits.\n\nFor further reading: Swedenborg Rite: and the Great Masonic Leaders of the Eighteenth Century by Samuel Beswick (1870); Emanuel Swedenborg.

See also: W.B.Yeats; Ralp Waldo Emerson, in his lecture of 1845, chose Swedenborg as the prototype of the mystic - Henry James was attracted to Swedenborgian ideas. His father, theologian Henry James, Sr., was Swedenborgian and William James, son of Henry James, showed in his philosophical works understanding of Swedenborg. Note: Jorge Luis Borges was interested in Swedenborg's thoughts and wrote a sonnet about him starting with the words:\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg\n\nTaller than the rest, that distant\n\nMan would walk among men, faintly\n\nCalling out to angels, speaking\n\nTheir secret names. What earthly eyes\n\nCannot see he saw: the burning\n\nGeometries, the crystalline\n\nLabyrinth of God, the sordid\n\nWhirling of infernal delights.\n\n(...)\n\nSelected works:\n\nPrincipia Rerum Naturalium, 1734\n\n- The Principia, or the First Principles of Natural Things (tr. 1846)\n\nOpera Philosophica et Mineralia, 1734 (3 vols.)\n\n- Swedenborg’s Treatise on Copper (tr.
