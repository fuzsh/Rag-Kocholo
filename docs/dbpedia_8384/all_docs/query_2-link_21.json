        "text": "Introduction to the Key Elements of Emmanuel Swedenborg’s Thought\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772) was a Swedish scientist, philosopher, theologian, and mystic whose works have profoundly impacted various fields of knowledge. His ideas and writings encompass multiple topics, including philosophy, theology, spirituality, and exploring the afterlife. I’ll briefly explain Swedenborg’s key ideas and shed light on his significant contributions.\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg, a prominent 18th-century intellectual, had a profound impact on various fields of thought, including theology and philosophy. His ideas, particularly his exploration of the spiritual realm and the interconnectedness of all things, challenged traditional religious doctrines and sparked debates among intellectuals. His concept of a spiritual world parallel to the physical world influenced philosophers like Immanuel Kant and Arthur Schopenhauer, shaping their own philosophical theories. Swedenborg’s emphasis on personal experience and direct communication with the divine resonated with Enlightenment thinkers who sought to reconcile reason and faith. His ideas also inspired artists and writers to explore the realms of the unconscious and spirituality. His ideas laid the foundation for various spiritual movements and philosophies, such as theosophy and New Thought. His emphasis on the interconnectedness of all things and personal spiritual experience resonated with individuals seeking alternative perspectives outside traditional religious institutions. His belief in love and compassion as transformative forces in society continues to inspire individuals and organizations working towards social justice and equality today.\n\nTHE WORLD OF SPIRIT\n\nOne of the central aspects of Swedenborg’s thought is his exploration of the spiritual world. He claimed to have had numerous mystical experiences that allowed him to gain insight into the realms beyond the physical. According to Swedenborg, the spiritual world is intricately connected to the physical world, influencing and shaping one another. This concept of interconnectedness presents a unique perspective on the relationship between the seen and unseen aspects of reality.\n\nTHE DIVINE\n\nAnother critical element of Swedenborg’s thought is his understanding of the nature of God. He posited that God is Love itself and that divine love permeates all aspects of existence. According to Swedenborg, the purpose of human life is to align oneself with this divine love and to live in harmony with it. This perspective offers a distinct view on the nature of divinity and the role of humans in the grand cosmic scheme.\n\nTHE AFTERLIFE\n\nSwedenborg’s thought also encompasses a comprehensive exploration of the afterlife. He claimed to have received visions and revelations about the spiritual realms, providing detailed descriptions of heaven, hell, and spiritual growth after death. His writings on the afterlife offer a unique perspective on the nature of the soul and the journey it undergoes beyond earthly existence.\n\nCORRESPONDENCES\n\nSwedenborg’s concept of correspondences is a core element of his writings. Based on the idea that everything in creation reflects something of the divine, he believed there is a symbolic relationship between the physical and spiritual realms. Emmanuel Swedenborg’s theory of correspondences is a philosophical and theological concept that suggests a relationship between the spiritual and physical realms. According to Swedenborg, there is a correspondence or connection between the natural and spiritual worlds, where everything in the physical realm has a corresponding spiritual counterpart.\n\nSwedenborg believed that the physical world reflects or manifests the spiritual world. He argued that the spiritual realm is the ultimate reality, and the physical world is a lower, more limited expression of that reality. In this theory, the spiritual realm is seen as the source of all existence, and the physical world represents or symbolises the spiritual truths and principles. Swedenborg’s idea of correspondences bears a strong resemblance to the much older alchemical concept of ‘as above so below’. Swedenborg was not an alchemist but many alchemists including Philip James de Loutherbourg were strongly influenced by Swedenborg.\n\nAccording to Swedenborg, this correspondence between the spiritual and physical realms can be observed in various aspects of life. For example, he suggested that particular objects, events, and phenomena in the physical world have symbolic meanings and represent spiritual concepts. He believed that the natural world is filled with symbols and correspondences that can be interpreted to gain insights into the spiritual realm.\n\nSwedenborg’s theory of correspondences has influenced various fields, including philosophy, theology, and art. It has been used to interpret religious texts, understand the symbolism in art and literature, and explore the relationship between existence’s physical and spiritual dimensions.\n\nFurthermore, Swedenborg’s thought deeply analyses the human mind and consciousness. He believed the human mind consists of three distinct levels: the natural, the spiritual, and the celestial. Each level corresponds to a different aspect of the human experience and has its own characteristics and functions. Swedenborg’s understanding of the human mind provides valuable insights into the complexity of human consciousness and the potential for spiritual growth.\n\nSome examples of Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondences:\n\nLight and Darkness: Swedenborg believed light and darkness corresponded spiritually. Light represents truth, wisdom, and spiritual enlightenment, while darkness symbolizes ignorance, falsehood, and spiritual blindness. This correspondence can be seen in various religious texts and metaphors, where light is often associated with divine presence and understanding.\n\nWater: Swedenborg says water corresponds to knowledge and truth. Just as water nourishes and sustains physical life, knowledge and truth nourish and sustain spiritual life. Water is often used symbolically in religious rituals, such as baptism, to represent purification and spiritual rebirth.\n\nTrees: Swedenborg saw trees corresponding to the human mind and its spiritual growth. Just as trees grow from a seed and develop branches, leaves, and fruits, the human mind grows and develops through acquiring knowledge, understanding, and virtues. Trees are often used symbolically in religious and mythological contexts to represent wisdom, strength, and spiritual connection.\n\nBread and Wine: Swedenborg believed that bread and wine correspond to the spiritual nourishment of the soul. Bread represents the spiritual sustenance of truth and understanding, while wine symbolizes the spiritual sustenance of love and charity. These correspondences are particularly significant in Christian sacraments like the Eucharist, where bread and wine are seen as symbols of Christ’s body and blood, providing spiritual nourishment to believers.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how Swedenborg’s doctrine of correspondences can be applied to interpret symbolic meanings in various aspects of life.\n\nLOVE AND SEX\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg’s concept of conjugal love, also known as marital or conjugial love, is a central theme in his theological and philosophical works. According to Swedenborg, conjugal love is a deep and spiritual love between a husband and wife in a committed and monogamous marriage.\n\nSwedenborg believed that conjugal love reflects the divine love and unity between God and humanity. He saw marriage as a sacred institution that mirrors the relationship between the Lord and the church, with the husband representing the Lord’s love and the wife representing the church’s wisdom.\n\nIn Swedenborg’s view, conjugal love is not merely a physical or emotional attraction between partners, but a spiritual bond that encompasses both the physical and spiritual aspects of their being. He emphasized the importance of mutual love, respect, and understanding between spouses and the cultivation of spiritual virtues such as kindness, loyalty, and selflessness.\n\nAccording to Swedenborg, true conjugal love is characterized by a deep and lasting friendship between partners, a shared commitment to each other’s spiritual growth, and a desire to support and uplift one another. He believed this love extends beyond the earthly realm and continues in the afterlife, where married couples can experience even more profound levels of spiritual union.\n\nSwedenborg’s concept of conjugal love has significantly influenced discussions of marriage and relationships, particularly within the context of spirituality and the search for deeper meaning and fulfillment in intimate partnerships.\n\nSWEDENBORG’S DREAM BOOK\n\nThe private Drömbok (Dream Book or Dream Diary) covers July 1743 to October 1744, when Swedenborg transitioned from scientist and mining engineer to “revelator” and seer.\n\nIt begins as a factual travel diary, describing how he left Sweden to travel to Germany and the Netherlands His purpose in travelling to the Netherlands was to finish and deliver to his printer in Amsterdam the manuscript of his book Regnum Animale which explained the soul from an anatomical perspective.. Swedenborg describes a vision of Christ he received in Delft. He went to London in late May and joined the Fetter Lane Moravian Church congregation.\n\nSwedenborg documented 150 dreams, which involved both spiritualy and science. Some of his dream imagery includes an anthropomorphic dog, Kings, an executioner with his collection of heads, dragons, a talking ox, and an abstract rectangular world, together with numerous ladies and erotic dreams.\n\nIn vivid dream no. 171, Swedenborg is in bed with a woman. She touches his penis and he gets the biggest erection ever. He penetrates her, thinking a child must arrive, and writes that he got off. Swedenborg argues in paragraph 172 that this dream depicts the ultimate love of the holy and that semen ejaculation denotes wisdom. Worldly Reason thinks this is unclean, but it’s pure. Swedenborg would argue in later publications, especially Conjugial Love, that sensual love is divine, even if humans corrupt it for selfish, evil purposes.\n\nIn another dream, he cannot control his desire for a woman and visits brothels with his friend. He lies with an ugly woman who pleases him in a fantastic dream but her vagina has teeth when he touches it. The vagina dentata (vagina with teeth) reappears in no. 261 when he sees a furious coal fire representing the ‘fire of love’. Then he wants to penetrate a woman, but her teeth hinder him. We know that many folktales from around the world feature the vagina dentata. Of this tradition, Camille Paglia notes that “The toothed vagina is no sexist hallucination: every penis is made less in every vagina, just as all mankind, male and female, is devoured by Mother Nature”.\n\nSwedenborg, who was likely unaware of the folklore story and unfamiliar with modern psychology, dreamed of the toothed vagina spontaneously.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Victorian translators of the Journal of Dreams were horrified by its erotic content and either omitted it or hid it from the uneducated and likely prurient reader. Even today, Swedenborg commentators will downplay those paragraphs in the Journal and elsewhere. For us today, these passages depict Swedenborg’s awareness of his sexual interests, as the stern scientist and seer get ‘humanized’ by them. Given Swedenborg’s later emphasis on sexual love between men and women, an analysis of his visions’ sensuality at a pivotal period in his life seems appropriate.\n\nINFLUENCE\n\nSwedenborg’s concept of correspondences has significantly influenced later artists and writers, particularly those interested in exploring the symbolic and spiritual dimensions of their work.\n\nSwedenborg’s concept of correspondences heavily influenced the Symbolist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Symbolist poets and artists sought to convey deeper spiritual and symbolic meanings through their work, using symbols and metaphors to represent abstract ideas and emotions. They believed the physical world could be a gateway to the spiritual realm, and Swedenborg’s ideas provided a framework for exploring these connections.\n\nThe first major movement that owes much to Swedenborg is Romanticism: Swedenborg’s concept of correspondences resonated with the Romantic movement, which emphasized the importance of imagination, intuition, and the spiritual aspects of human experience. Whether they understood him well or only passingly, many of the Romantics read Swedenborg and incorporated his ideas into their work. Charles Baudelaire for example, wrote his great poem Correspondences which was strongly influenced by Swedenborg (although Gary Lachman believes that Baudelaire’s influence was less directly from reading Swedenborg than from reading Balzac and other writers who definitely read Swedenborg). Romantic poets and artists often used nature as a symbol of the divine and sought to capture the transcendent and mystical qualities of the world. Swedenborg’s ideas about the symbolic significance of natural elements and their correspondence to spiritual truths aligned with the Romantic sensibility.\n\nThe Surrealist movement, which emerged in the early 20th century, was also influenced by Swedenborg’s concept of correspondences in its exploration of the subconscious and the dreamlike realm. Surrealist artists sought to tap into the hidden depths of the mind and create works that revealed the underlying connections between the physical and spiritual realms. They often used symbolic imagery and juxtapositions to evoke a sense of mystery and the irrational, drawing inspiration from Swedenborg’s ideas about the symbolic nature of reality. Carl Jung was likewise an avid reader of Swedenborg and was influenced by all of these ideas in his own development of the concept of the unconscious.\n\nMany writers and poets have drawn inspiration from Swedenborg’s concept of correspondences in their works. For example, William Blake, though he was never a Swedenborgian, would certainly have met people who knew Swedenborg personally. He did incorporate his own versions of Swedenborgian ideas into his visionary and mystical poetry, exploring the connections between the physical and spiritual worlds. Other writers, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, were influenced by Swedenborg’s ideas about the interconnectedness of all things and the presence of divine wisdom in nature. Aldous Huxley, Balzac, Hoffmann, Rimbaud, Verlaine and the French Symbolists were all directly or indirectly from these ideas.\n\nOverall, Swedenborg’s concept of correspondences has provided a rich source of inspiration for artists and writers seeking to delve into the symbolic, spiritual, and metaphysical dimensions of their creative endeavours.\n\nFEMINISM\n\nWhile Swedenborg did not explicitly address feminist issues, his theological and philosophical ideas have been interpreted and applied in ways that have influenced feminist thought. Many early feminists and activists for women’s emancipation were followers of Swedenborg or read him avidly. Indeed, Swedenborg’s ideas have intersected with feminism in several ways.\n\nSwedenborg’s concept of spiritual equality and the idea that both men and women have a spiritual nature and potential has resonated with feminist thinkers. His belief in the importance of mutual love and respect in marriage and his emphasis on the spiritual growth and development of both partners can be seen as aligning with feminist ideals of equality and partnership in relationships.\n\nAdditionally, Swedenborg’s approach to interpreting religious texts, including the Bible, was been used by Christian feminists to challenge traditional patriarchal interpretations. His concept of correspondences and symbolic meanings has allowed for alternative readings of biblical stories and characters, highlighting the agency and significance of women in religious narratives.\n\nSwedenborg’s emphasis on an individual’s spiritual and inner qualities, rather than external appearances or societal roles, has resonated with feminist ideas of empowerment and self-determination. His belief in cultivating virtues and spiritual qualities, such as love, wisdom, and compassion, can be seen as aligning with feminist values of personal growth and empowerment.\n\nAlso, Swedenborg’s mystical experiences and exploration of the spiritual realm have inspired feminist thinkers to explore alternative ways of knowing and experiencing the divine. His emphasis on intuition, imagination, and the inner spiritual journey has resonated with feminist spirituality and the exploration of women’s unique spiritual experiences. His ideas underpin much of the feminist undercurrents of Theosophy and new age feminism.\n\nSwedenborg’s ideas have been interpreted and applied in various ways by different feminist thinkers. While some have found resonance and inspiration in his concepts, others have critiqued aspects of his theology and its potential limitations in addressing feminist concerns. Overall, Swedenborg’s influence on feminism is a complex and multifaceted subject.\n\nMusic\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg’s influence on music and music composition is not as well-documented or widely recognized as in other fields. However, there have been some connections and interpretations of his ideas concerning music. Messiaen, Scriabin and Debussy were known to be interested in Swedenborg.\n\nSwedenborg’s theory of correspondences, which suggests a connection between the spiritual and physical realms, can applied to music, Since music can convey symbolic meanings and represent spiritual concepts through its structure, harmonies, and melodies. This approach sees music as a language that can express and communicate spiritual truths.\n\nSwedenborg’s mystical experiences and exploration of the spiritual realm can resonate with composers interested in expressing spiritual and transcendent themes in their music. Drawing inspiration from Swedenborg’s writings and ideas, it’s possible to create compositions that evoke a sense of the divine, the mystical, or the otherworldly.\n\nSwedenborg’s emphasis on the inner spiritual journey and cultivating virtues and spiritual qualities can inspire composers who seek to express personal and introspective experiences through their music. They may draw on Swedenborg’s ideas to explore themes of personal growth, transformation, and the search for meaning and enlightenment.\n\nHis concepts of correspondences, spirituality, and the interconnectedness of all things lend themselves to musical composition and performance to express deeper spiritual and symbolic dimensions.\n\nSwedenborg had many followers who were musicians – one of them Jean-Hippolyte Batrthelemon, composed hymns for the Swedenborg New Church as well as stage music and light operas.\n\nOccultism\n\nThere is a link between Emanuel Swedenborg and occultism. However, it is important to note that Swedenborg did not identify as an occultist. “occultism” refers to the study and practice of hidden or esoteric knowledge, often associated with mystical, spiritual, or supernatural phenomena. While Swedenborg’s work primarily falls within theology and philosophy, his ideas and experiences have been interpreted and incorporated into occult and esoteric traditions. Here are a few key points regarding the link between Swedenborg and occultism:\n\nSpiritualism and Mediumship were profoundly influenced by Swedenborg and by the practitioners who followed him. Swedenborg’s experiences of communicating with spirits and his exploration of the spiritual realm have influenced the development of spiritualism, a movement that gained popularity in the 19th century. Spiritualism involves the belief in communication with the spirits of the deceased, often through mediums. Swedenborg’s experiences interacting with spirits and his writings on the afterlife have been cited as precursors to spiritualist practices.\n\nSwedenborg’s concept of correspondences, which suggests a symbolic connection between the physical and spiritual realms, has been interpreted and applied in various esoteric and occult traditions. His ideas have been used to interpret religious texts, explore symbolic meanings in art and literature, and delve into reality’s hidden or mystical aspects.\n\nHis writings and ideas have influenced several prominent occultists and esoteric thinkers. For example, Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, drew inspiration from Swedenborg’s concepts of correspondences and the spiritual realms in her own teachings. Aleister Crowley, a prominent occultist of the 20th century, also referenced Swedenborg’s works in his writings.\n\nSwedenborg’s ideas have been incorporated into various occult societies and orders. For instance, though Swedenborg was not himself a Mason, the Swedenborgian Rite was a Masonic rite incorporating Swedenborgian teachings and symbolism. Some occult groups and esoteric organizations have also drawn on Swedenborg’s concepts and writings as part of their spiritual and philosophical frameworks.\n\nIt is important to note that the interpretation and application of Swedenborg’s ideas within occultism can vary significantly. Not all occultists or esoteric practitioners incorporate his teachings into their work. The link between Swedenborg and occultism primarily lies in his ideas’ influence on esoteric traditions and the incorporation of his concepts into occult practices and philosophies.\n\nAngels\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg’s concept of angels and angel communication is central to his theological and mystical writings. According to Swedenborg, angels are spiritual beings who reside in the spiritual realm and serve as intermediaries between God and humanity. Here are some key elements of Swedenborg’s understanding of angels and angel communication:\n\nSwedenborg described angels as individuals who were once human beings but have transitioned into the spiritual realm after death. He believed that angels possess a higher level of spiritual consciousness and wisdom than humans and are engaged in continuous spiritual growth and development. He proposed a hierarchical structure of angels, with different orders or societies of angels having specific roles and functions. He described three main heavens, each with multiple sub-levels, and suggested that angels in higher heavens possess greater spiritual insight and wisdom.\n\nSwedenborg claimed to have had direct and frequent communication with angels, both through visions and spiritual experiences. He asserted that angels communicate with humans through spiritual means, such as dreams, visions, and inner perceptions. According to Swedenborg, angelic communication is a form of spiritual enlightenment and guidance, providing insights into divine truths and the nature of the spiritual realm. Swedenborg believed that angelic communication serves several purposes. It can comfort and reassure individuals, offer guidance and insights into spiritual matters, and help humans in their spiritual growth and development. Angelic communication is seen as a means for humans to gain knowledge and understanding of divine truths and to align their lives with spiritual principles.\n\nSwedenborg emphasized that angels are motivated by love and goodness. He believed that angelic communication is grounded in a genuine desire to assist and uplift humanity, promoting love, compassion, and spiritual growth.\n\nIt is important to note that Swedenborg’s claims of direct communication with angels and his detailed descriptions of the spiritual realm are considered highly subjective and have been met with skepticism by many. However, his writings on angels and angelic communication have significantly impacted spiritual and mystical traditions, and his ideas continue to be explored and interpreted by individuals interested in the intersection of spirituality and the supernatural.\n\nDemons\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg’s concept of demons and demonic communication is integral to his theological and mystical writings. According to Swedenborg, demons are spiritual beings who have chosen to turn away from God and embrace evil and selfishness. To Swedenborg, demons don’t cohere to the image that you see above. Here are some key elements of Swedenborg’s understanding of demons and demonic communication:\n\nNaSwedenborg described demons as once human beings who have become spiritually corrupted due to their choices and actions. He believed that demons are driven by self-centeredness, hatred, and a desire to harm others. Unlike angels, who seek to promote love and goodness, demons are motivated by negative and destructive impulses. Swedenborg suggested that demons can influence human thoughts and actions. He believed demons seek to tempt and deceive individuals, leading them away from spiritual truths and promoting evil and selfishness. However, Swedenborg also emphasized that humans can resist demonic influence through their choices and by aligning themselves with divine principles.\n\n3Swedenborg claimed to have encountered demons and experienced their attempts to communicate with him. He described demonic communication as deceptive and manipulative, aimed at leading individuals astray and promoting negative behaviors and beliefs. Swedenborg believed demonic communication often involves false and distorted ideas, designed to confuse and mislead. He emphasized the importance of spiritual growth and cultivating love and goodness to resist demonic influence. He believed that by aligning oneself with divine principles and seeking spiritual enlightenment, individuals can overcome the temptations and deceptions of demons.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Swedenborg’s accounts of direct encounters with demons and his detailed descriptions of their nature and influence are highly subjective and have been met with skepticism by many. His writings on demons and demonic communication are primarily understood within the context of his theological and mystical framework. While his ideas have influenced some spiritual and mystical traditions, they have not gained widespread acceptance or recognition outside Swedenborgian circles.\n\nKabbala\n\nEmmanuel Swedenborg’s connection to the Kabbalah and Kabbalist studies is a subject of debate and interpretation. While Swedenborg did not explicitly mention the Kabbalah in his writings, some scholars have identified potential connections and influences between Swedenborgian thought and Kabbalistic concepts. Here are a few points to consider:\n\nCorrespondences and Symbolism: Both Swedenborgian thought and Kabbalah emphasize the idea of correspondences, which suggests a symbolic connection between the physical and spiritual realms. Swedenborg’s concept of correspondences, as outlined in his work “Arcana Caelestia,” shares similarities with the Kabbalistic notion of the Tree of Life and its symbolic associations.\n\nDivine Names and Attributes: Swedenborg’s writings often discuss the divine names and attributes, exploring the various aspects of God’s nature. This focus on the divine names and attributes resembles the Kabbalistic practice of analyzing and meditating on the divine names and their mystical significance.\n\nMystical Experiences and Spiritual Realms: Swedenborg and Kabbalistic teachings delve into the mystical and spiritual realms. Swedenborg’s accounts of his spiritual experiences and interactions with angels and spirits share similarities with the Kabbalistic emphasis on mystical encounters and ascents through the different realms of existence.\n\nInfluences from Jewish Mysticism: It is probable that Swedenborg may have been – directly or indirectly – influenced by Jewish mystical traditions, including the Kabbalah, through his exposure to Jewish thinkers and texts during his time in Amsterdam.\n\nWhile connections between Swedenborgian thought and the Kabbalah are not universally accepted, we do know Swedenborg was in London at the same time as Rabbi Falk, known as the Ba’al Shem of London, and in fact, the men were neighbours! It is highly likely they had a close acquaintance and they shared many of the same followers. Certainly they shared mystical and esoteric traditions however broadly. The exact nature of Swedenborg’s connection to the Kabbalah and Kabbalist studies remains a subject of ongoing discussion and exploration within academic and theological circles.\n\nSwedenborg and Sufism (Islamic esotericism)\n\nThere is something intriguing about exploring the potential connections between Swedenborgian thought and Islamic mysticism, particularly Sufism. While Swedenborg’s writings are deeply rooted in Christian theology and mysticism, there are intriguing points of convergence with Sufi teachings that cannot be overlooked. Both traditions place a profound importance on mystical experiences and direct communion with the Divine, each sharing a common pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and deeper connection. The resonance between Swedenborg’s Divine Love and Wisdom and Sufi principles is tantalising.\n\nMoreover, the similarities extend to the realms beyond the physical world, as both Swedenborgian thought and Sufism contemplate multiple spiritual realms and the potential for soulful growth in the afterlife. This parallel is nothing short of fascinating and underscores the universality of spiritual exploration.\n\nIt is equally compelling to explore the inclusive and universalistic approach to spirituality associated with Swedenborgian thought, which resonates with the Sufi emphasis on the unity of all religions and the shared wisdom across spiritual traditions. The potential for shared spiritual truths is an enchanting concept that further binds these two profound teachings.\n\nWhile these connections are indeed intriguing, it is important to approach them with sensitivity and to recognize that they do not imply direct influence or engagement between Swedenborgian thought and Sufism. Rather, they serve as a testament to the richness of mystical and spiritual traditions, each offering unique insights into the nature of the divine."
