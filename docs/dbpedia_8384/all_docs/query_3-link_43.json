        "text": "January 22, 4:00 p.m.\n\nCollege Center at Bryn Athyn College in Bryn Athyn, PA and livestreamed\n\nFeaturing Speaker Vincent Roy-Di Piazza\n\nThe influence of Emanuel Swedenborg on the early abolitionist movement is well known and largely documented. However, until recently very little scholarship had investigated Swedenborg’s own views about slavery, provided context about his views on African superiority, or even attempted to find if he possibly knew living African individuals.\n\nThe Institute for Swedenborg Studies at Bryn Athyn College is pleased to welcome you to hear Vincent Roy-Di Piazza talk on his recent discoveries on the subject: we learn that Swedenborg was the first prominent Swede to condemn slavery; we delineate the corpus of his writings on both temporal and spiritual slavery, track the emergence of his beliefs in African superiority, and analyze his statements against colonial intrusion in African lands. In doing so, we find that Swedenborg’s corpus on slavery not only appears much wider and richer than previously acknowledged: we also see that his position creatively drew upon ideals of noble savagery, in a striking counterexample to the tropes’s decline in the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nRefreshments will be served Bryn Athyn's College Center, room 201. This event is free.\n\nAbout Vincent Roy-Di Piazza\n\nVincent Roy-Di Piazza is a historian of science and religion. He recently obtained his PhD at the University of Oxford, with a dissertation on Swedenborg and the soul-body problem. He is currently a postdoctoral associate at Oxford, a research fellow at the Karolinska Institute, and a lecturer at the University of Stockholm. He has published on various aspects of Swedenborg’s life and thought.

Swedenborg’s contribution to spirituality has captured the attention of many important thinkers since his writings first revealed his contact with the spirit world in the late eighteenth century. The concept of spirituality he laid out, at once mystical and profoundly pragmatic, continues to have rippling implications in many fields. Papers will address a variety of topics, including the following:\n\nRelationships between spirituality and religion\n\nRelationships between spirituality and religious traditions\n\nMystic, devotional, or spiritual practices\n\nInterpretive models and practices\n\nRelationships between psychological models and the spiritual mind\n\nSwedenborg’s metaphysics and physics\n\nSeminar participants may attend in person or remotely.\n\nKeynote\n\nThose who wish to attend the keynote portion only may do so in person or virtually. Tickets available at the door starting at 7:15 p.m.\n\nJim Lawrence, A Daily Spiritual Practice Based on Swedenborg’s Rules of Life\n\nRev. Dr. Jim Lawrence grew up an every-Sunday kid in a Disciples of Christ church in Houston. During college he majored in developmental economics for impoverished countries due to an overwhelming concern for suffering in the world. It was also during these young adult years that he lost his faith due precisely to the world’s massive misery index. He concluded the universe is heartless and pointless. That perspective changed, however, through a spiritual renewal that opened up a new sense for meaning and purpose. Becoming immersed in the post-Reformation scientist and theologian Emanuel Swedenborg provided one impetus toward interpreting life as meaningful again. His vision shifted toward spiritual renewal as the world’s greatest need, so after rapidly finishing his degree in economics at the University of Texas, he dove into studies at a Disciples of Christ seminary. The “Swedenborg bug,” however, would not go away, and so he committed what many of his colleagues felt was professional suicide by jumping ship to the Swedenborgian seminary in Boston. After graduation and ordination, he found tremendous satisfaction working during the next 17 years in the congregational leadership in three church ministries spanning small town, suburban, and urban settings. During these years he also earned the Doctor of Ministry degree focusing on the performative practice of writing as a communications ministry strategy. To date he has been author, editor, contributor, or publisher of more than 150 bound works and author of dozens of ministry and spirituality articles for the lay public. In 2001 he was called to return to the academy, complete a Ph.D. degree in Christian Spirituality, and become Dean of Convention’s theological school, for which he led the effort to relocate to Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley as the Swedenborgian House of Studies, which in 2015 became a Center of Distinction at the Graduate Theological Union as the Center for Swedenborgian Studies, where he is still Dean. He has remained on the faculty at Pacific School of Religion directing the Doctor of Ministry degree program. He is currently President-Elect of the Swedenborgian Church of North America.\n\nSchedule\n\nSaturday, April 23, 2021 9:00 am\n\nSession 1\n\nModels of Spirituality\n\nSpirituality, Religion, and Swedenborg | Dan Synnestvedt\n\n‘One God’ and the ‘Love of God’: Swedenborg’s influence on Balzac | Saori Osuga\n\nA Swedenborgian Theology of Social Justice | Shada Sullivan\n\n10:30 Break 11:00 Session 2\n\nRealms of Spirituality and Science\n\nHow is quantum physics really connected to consciousness? | Ian Thompson\n\nSwedenborg’s Prism and Goethe’s Theory of Color | Angela Rose\n\nSwedenborg, Space Humanities, and Exoplanets | Vincent Roy-Di Piazza\n\n12:30pm Lunch Break 1:30 Session 3\n\nConcepts of Psychology and Spirituality\n\nLearning to Hear Again: James Fowler, Paul Ricoeur, Emanuel Swedenborg, and the Stages of Faith | Ray Silverman\n\nMetaphor and Spiritual Meaning | Stephen D.
