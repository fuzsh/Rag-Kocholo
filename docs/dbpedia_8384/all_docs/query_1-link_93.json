        "text": "November 30, 2022\n\nDreams of a Ghost-Seer Explained by Dreams of Metaphysics, 1766\n\nKant’s 1766 “Träume eines Geistersehers, erläutert durch Träume der Metaphysik” is directed towards the \"charlatan\" metaphysicians of his day, using Swedenborg's claims of spirit-visions as the central example. It is a cynical, scathing, and mocking criticism of Swedenborgian metaphysics, while simultaneously undermining the faulty Epistemology of Leibniz. Kant addresses “Mr. Schwedenberg” directly and analyzes his works methodically. This is one of his most obscure manuscript, and for good reasons. It is a winding work which pulls the reader into multiple directions and was criticized by Kant himself. Schopenhauer published a similar work in 1851 titled \"Versuch über das Geistersehen und was damit zusammenhängt\" (Attempt on ghost seeing and what is connected with it) where he mentions that this obsession over communicating with the beyond is in the Zeitgeist of the 17th and 18th century\"\n\nThe ghosts, which were not banished as well as outlawed everywhere in the super-smart, past century, in spite of all earlier ones, have been rehabilitated in Germany, like magic before, during these last 25 years. Perhaps not unjustly. For the proofs against their existence were partly metaphysical, which, as such, stood on uncertain ground; partly empirical, which proved only that, in those cases where no accidental or deliberately arranged deception had been uncovered, there was nothing present that could have acted on the retina by reflection of the light rays, or on the tympanum by vibration of the air.\n\nSchopenhauer largely agrees with Kant, but tries to provide more room for the experience of magic than Kant does. Even here in a small, anonymous early work, Kant is laying the foundation of his position as the “Newton of Morals”, splitting reality into two subdivisions between Form and Sense-Perception; an ontological divide between a Numinal and Phenomenological world. He creates a broader vision of Swedenborg's cosmological worldview and deconstructs it as ridiculous according to Enlightenment rationality, and even worse, immoral. He manages to make his critique of Swedenborg's anti-Humic in his statement that a real image of Metaphysics relies on living a moral life. Without this, there is no transcendent realities to be experienced. Schopenhauer, in his odd nesting of Phenomena within Noumena, denies the external existence of Ghosts, but allows for their existence within consciousness.\n\nMore broadly, he is sketching out the left and right delineators in his response to the Aristotelian metaphysics of Hume while trying to upload the Scientific advances of the Enlightenment. He uses Occam’s Razor against Swedenborg, using pure Enlightenment reason to deconstruct his claims which at points sounds Humic. But at the same time, he begins to back against a pure Newtonian mechanical, deterministic worldview: “For in the relations of cause and effect, of substance and action, philosophy serves at first to resolve the intricate phenomena and to bring such to simpler conceptions.” It is certainly his least anti-Enlightenment out of all of his works.\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg was not a mere charlatan spiritualist. He was a dedicated scientist for many years, ran a scientific publication, and was an important advisor on geometry, chemistry, and metallurgy to the royal family of Sweden. He was the first know scientist to understand the concept of Neurons in the brain and charted the first ideals of Synaptic relays. His anatomical and physiological studies were decades ahead of his time. Much later in life, in his 50's, he began to have dreams and visions. He recorded these in dream journals. Later in life, he dedicated himself entirely to Biblical and Theological studies but strayed from Christian Orthodoxy into heavily mystical, spiritualist, and pluralistic lines of thought. He developed an entire theory of the relationship between the material and spiritual world and saw no conflict between believing in both.\n\nKant did not immediately discount Swedenborg's clairvoyant claims. He acquired Swedenborg's entire enigmatic Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Arcana or Heavenly Mysteries) and studied the whole thing before we have any record of his opinions. Written in Latin, Arcana Cœlestia is an inaccessible exegesis of scripture and a defense of his metaphysical view of Correspondence, or \"simultaneous\" levels of existence. Swedenborg claimed that this whole idea was revealed to him, in a similar fashion to Kant's claim that absolute morality is a factor of common sense, not a unique idea of his. Kant considered Swedenborg a serious scholar and academic, which might be why he published this criticism of his theories anonymously. Kant himself did not hold his Dreams of a Spirit-Seer in high esteem and criticized his own arguments against Swedenborg in his correspondence with Moses Mendelssohn years later. Perhaps this is why this work is nearly entirely unknown- it is sloppy and an immature version of Kant's dialectics.\n\nThroughout Carl Jung’s philosophic substructure of Analytic Psychology, he used Kant’s dichotomy of the Neo-Platonic subdivision of the Numinal and Phenomenological world to support his mystical-scientific concept of Synchronicity, which Swedenborg’s Correspondence theory is a shoddy echo, and specifically cites Dreams of a Spirit-Seer:\n\nThe effective (numinous) agents in the unconscious are the archetypes. By far the greatest number of spontaneous synchronistic phenomena that I have had occasion to observe and analyze can easily be shown to have a direct connection with an archetype. This, in itself, is an irrepressible, psychoid factor… when, for instance, the vision arose in Swedenborg’s mind of a fire in Stockholm, there was a real fire raging there at the same time, without there being any demonstrable or even thinkable connection between the two… we must assume that there was a lowing of the threshold of consciousness which gave him access to “absolute knowledge”. The fire in Stockholm was, in a sense, burning in him too. For the unconscious psyche space and time seem to be relative; that is to say, knowledge finds itself in a space-time continuum in which space is no longer space, not time time.\n\nWe can see how Jung is combining Hegel and Kant with the idea of “absolute knowledge” and the dichotomy of the Numinal and Phenomenological. Kant was the first recorded philosopher (pre-dating newton by just a couple years) in his statement that gravity can act at a distance, foreshadowing Quantum Entanglement and Jungian-Einsteinian iteration of Panpsychist this experiment resurrected. There is an oceanic tautology between Kant and Jung's psychology in relation to the sophistry of Subject-Object perception. Jung misunderstands Kant’s criticism of the event as evidence for it: “This case is well authenticated. See report in Kant’s Dreams of a Spirit seer” even though the entire point of this work is to discredit the whole idea of interaction with a spirit world directly. Jungian philosophy is heavily influenced by German Idealism, and continued Kant’s work of making religious beliefs acceptable to a materialistic metaphysic.\n\nHowever, both Kant, Hegel and Jung all articulate at different points that Rationalizing faith is a foolhardy attempt as the human psyche does not ultimately operate on presuppositional rational axoims, but Symbolism. Kant speaks of Archetypes guiding the pneumatic world long before Jung did:\n\nThe soul's world is not a world of spirits, but a world of archetypes, which are accompanying ideas of those of the other world, and therefore, what I think as a spirit is not remembered by me as a human being, and vice versa, my state as a human being does not come into the idea of myself as a spirit at all\n\nUltimately, Kant sees these questions of synchronicity, spiritualism and mysticism broadly (eventually he would include simple prayer in this category, which would get him in trouble with the Lutheran church) as useless to the primary task of human life, which is to live moral lives according to God’s Rational purpose:\n\nLet us therefore leave to speculation and to the care of idle minds all noisy doctrinal statements of such remote objects…. They are, in fact, indifferent to us, and the momentary appearance of reasons for or against may perhaps decide the applause of the schools, but hardly anything about the future fate of the righteous.\n\nThe Metaphysician of Konigsburg\n\n1755 General Natural History and Theory of Heaven: https://bit.ly/3FbUrcK\n\n1764 Observations on the feeling of the beautiful: https://bit.ly/3uf7XWJ\n\n1766 Dreams of a Ghost-Seer: https://bit.ly/3XIPFut\n\n1783 Prolegomena to any future metaphysics: https://bit.ly/3uewAD0\n\n1785 Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals: https://bit.ly/3XGObRt\n\n1786 Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science: https://bit.ly/3GUz4Ob\n\n1787 Critique of Pure Reason: https://bit.ly/3gMJ0i9\n\n1788 Critique of Practical Reason: https://bit.ly/3UdFBGZ\n\n1790 Critique of Judgment: https://bit.ly/3FdzkGK\n\n1793 Religion within the Limits of Mere Reason: https://bit.ly/3FdEL8E\n\n1795 Toward Eternal Peace: https://bit.ly/3ioyLRH\n\n1797 Metaphysics of Morals: https://bit.ly/3gNkddY\n\n1798 The Dispute of the Faculties: https://bit.ly/3AVMVQO"
