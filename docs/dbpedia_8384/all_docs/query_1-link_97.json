        "text": "Kant was also the second to propose that the Milky Way was a disk of the stars sustained against collapse to a single object by rotational motion (i.e., angular momentum) just as the Solar System is so sustained. The first for Milky Way speculation was Thomas Wright (1711--1786) (see Wikipedia: Thomas Wright: Astronomy) whose book Kant had seen a review of. The third was Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728--1777) who claimed to have come to his speculations NOT knowing of those of Wright and Kant. See No-404--407."
