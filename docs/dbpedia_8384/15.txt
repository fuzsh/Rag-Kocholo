Description

German philosopher Immanuel Kant had a complicated view of the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg. Although Kant wrote a book that was harshly satiric of Swedenborg’s ideas (Traume eines Geistersehers, or Dreams of a Spirit-Seer in English), later in life he appeared to reverse this opinion. Florschütz discusses this tension in Kant’s thought in this short monograph.
