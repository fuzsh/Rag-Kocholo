Newton Running is a brand that specializes in designing and manufacturing running shoes. Their products focus on promoting a more natural running form and enhancing overall performance and comfort for runners.

Introduced in 2007, Newton Running was founded by Danny Abshire and Jerry Lee.

The brand was inspired by the principles of Sir Isaac Newton, particularly his third law of motion which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Newton Running introduced their signature technology - Action/ReactionTM, which provides cushioning and responsiveness by using highly responsive lugs in the midsole.

The brand quickly gained popularity among runners looking for a shoe that encourages proper running mechanics and reduces the risk of injury.

Newton Running has since expanded its product range to include various models for different types of runners and terrains.

The brand continues to innovate and improve their designs to offer runners the best possible running experience.
