        "text": "The Good\n\nThomas: I have been a Newton Running fan for a long time, so I was a little worried about whether or not I would like some of the the changes they were making to the shoe. I was ready to pan the 5 lug models if they were a let down from the previous 4 lug models. I have worn and reviewed the Energy, the MV2 and MV3 so I knew the 5 lug worked on those models. The Gravity, Motion, and Distance had a history the other shoes did not. From the first run in these I knew there was something special about the Motion III. The upper fits both narrow and wide feet with an open throat at the bottom of the laces you can adjust for the width of your foot. No hot spots in the shoe for me. The cushioning on the shoe is just about perfect. Soft enough to keep your feet happy, firm enough to feel speedy. The 5 lug configuration is IDEAL. It made me wonder why it took Newton so long to move to the 5 lug set up. In trying to figure out what shoe to wear in my upcoming marathon, I kept trying on different shoes that I like a lot, like the Mizuno Hitogami and the Skechers GOrun Speed. I even thought about going back to the Adidas Adios Boost. After a 19 mile training run in the Newton Motion III, I realized the lugs act like a launch pad for my stride, I can feel them land, grip, and rip. They really help me feel like I can push when my legs get tired. Another benefit to the 5 lug set up is the wear on the shoe seems to be more even and less severe. Based on the ride and feel of the Motion III I picked up a pair of Distance III. I have already had one great run in them and haven’t been this excited for a marathon shoe in awhile. Review to come.\n\nMeaghan: The Newton Motion III is a versatile shoe; you can take them out for a quick 3 miles or a slow 20 miler (I’ve done both) and feel comfortable. Like several new models from Newton, the Motion III’s feature five prominent forefoot lugs, known as the POP 1 platform. Although they take a little getting used to, the rubber lugs feel awesome underfoot. They give you that trampoline-like return which seems to help with faster miles. Even with the extra rubber along the outsole, this is a light shoe (Newton’s website says 7.8 oz, but I weighed them right at 7). They’re comfortable straight out of the box and have the perfect amount of padding around the collar/tongue. The rest of the upper is made with a light, breathable mesh and a few overlays. A strip of reflective material wraps around the entire shoe which is nice for those dark, early morning runs.\n\nThe Bad\n\nMeaghan: There’s not much I don’t love about this shoe. I did have some issues with the laces staying tied. On several runs I had to stop and re-lace. If I end up wearing these for a race I’ll probably swap in some lock laces.\n\nThomas: The Motion III has a lot of overlay coverage and the materials seem less breathable than other Newton models.\n\nThe Overall\n\nThomas: Newton says “Our stability Mileage Trainer is for runners wanting a daily training shoe that can also function brilliantly as a faster tempo pace run or race shoe. We’ve added our Extended Medial Bridge (e.m.b) to the outsole to provide more functional support for runners requiring a greater surface area on the medial side due to pronation or a flatter arch. The Motion III combines our highly responsive P.O.P.1 platform with enough structure for high mileage. Stability and performance wrapped into one, we created the perfect mate.” I’d just say this is a really good everyday trainer. You can run them fast or slow in comfort. If you are someone that cares a lot about drop the Motion III are 3mm. I care more about the weight. The Motion III are in the middle, not too light and not too heavy at 9.5 oz for a men’s 10.5. The extra weight is the main reason I got the Distance III for the Marathon. I would recommend the Motion III for the runner that wants more stability than the Gravity III or the Distance III offer. If you like Newton running shoes as much as I do you will love the new line up.\n\nMeaghan: I can’t seem to get enough of this shoe. Run after run, I find myself lacing them up. I already have over 100 miles on them. They’re comfortable, light, fast and perfect for all sorts of running. Whether you’re heading out for a speed workout, or an LSD (long slow distance) run, the Motion III is a solid go-to shoe.\n\nNewton Motion III were provided by Newton Running for this review."
