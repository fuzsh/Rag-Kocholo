        "text": "So I’m watching NFL on NBC and I see Cam Newton postgame looking like a damn pimp.\n\nAnyways, from my limited NFL knowledge I keep hearing that this guy is the best athlete.\n\nSo exactly how athletic is he. Lebron/Westbrook level?\n\nAnd is that how NFL players dress these days?\n\nI’m American and I hate American football. I mean hate it.\n\nCam is probably 6’4\" or 6’5\" and anywhere between 230 – 250 lbs probably.\n\nLebron is 6’8\" and realistically, probably 275 lbs. Can run faster, jump higher, move quicker. Stronger, bigger faster.\n\nFor a quarterback Cam is an elite athlete, but I don’t think he would even be top 20 in his respected sport.\n\nCam is crazy athletic. I’ll never forget him front flipping over a player for a touchdown and landing on two feet…in football pads.\n\nIt’s hard for me to imagine Lebron doing that…although he probably could. Westbrook I’m more confident could do something like that just because he’s smaller.\n\nLebron and Westbrook are also both crazy fast, and it’s hard to compare Cam to them when he’s running in pads. But Cam is REALLY speedy.\n\nEither way…they’re all insane. I’m sure if you compared their combine numbers and adjusted them slightly since NBA is different than NFL, they’re all equally mind boggling.\n\nLeBron is one of the single greatest athletes in modern sports history- a 6’8, 275 pound freight train of lean muscle mass. He is simultaneously one of the strongest guys in the league whilst being one of the fastest and most agile. In the body of what most power forwards are. It is hard to compare anyone to him\n\nI believe Lebron is the superior athlete. I can’t really think of anybody in professional sports more athletically gifted than LBJ. To be that big, strong, agile, fast and quick is just not fair. Cam is an elite athlete in his own right, but not better than Lebron. I think when it is all said and done, Lebron will be considered the greatest \"athlete\" of all time…\n\nYeah, I would say that Terrelle Pryor is the best athlete in the NFL. 6-5, 240 lbs, 4.3 speed in the 40. Could have been an NBA pro if he had chosen that route. Great college QB and after making a position change looks like he’s on course to become a possible pro bowl WR in the next few years.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nQuestion number 1 – Cam is a great athlete, especially for his position. But he isn’t comparible to Lebron. Even putting aside his consistency in being athletic (which is probably the most impressive trait), he’s still (at 31) miles ahead of Cam.\n\nTo answer question number 2 – How is Cam’s attire any more surprising to you than Westbrook’s?\n\nI believe ESPN ran an article comparing LeBron and Calvin Johnson’s athleticism a couple of years back. Listed at 6’6 235 with 4.3 speed and the catch radius of a garage door, he was easily the best athlete in the NFL, but still can’t hold a candle to LeBron IMO.\n\nAs for Cam, he’s probably the best athlete to ever play the Quarterback position. Tough call between him and Vick in his prime, but even then, not nearly on LeBron’a level.\n\nBoth are freaks of nature. Fast, strong, built like tanks. Lebron in a vaccum is by far the better athlete though.\n\nHowever I think their \"athletic advantage\" in their sport are roughly the same. I think its fair to say Cam is as equal as a freak of nature as Lebron compared to the average NFL QB. I mean Cam is the size of Ben Rothesburger with the speed of a full back and strength of a middle line backer, at QB. We have never seen a QB like him, and he is likely more athletic than the 2nd most athletic QB than Lebron is than the 2nd PF, SF.\n\n(FYI including size as an advantage in \"best athlete\" thats why Lebron> prime Nate Robinson, Cam>Vick)\n\nIf LeBron wasn’t 3 inches taller I would say this was a toss up, but the extra heighth is a deciding factor for me. Though I think Newton may win out in strength and agility tests. They apparently both run around a 4.6 40 yard dash, LeBron’s being an untrained 40, and Newton’s no step vertical is 36 so who knows what his max vert is(the way they test it at the NBA combine). On a whole NFL players are more athletic than NBA players, but I’ll give the slight edge to Bron here. I don’t think he is as decisively more athletic as the other posters though."
