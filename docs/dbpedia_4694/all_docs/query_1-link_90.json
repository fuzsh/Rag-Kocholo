        "text": "The Newton MV3 is my favorite Newton running shoe since Aug 2013 when I wear tested it. I like it so much that I even used it for training and competing in track and field events: 400m and Triple Jump. Newton has not released a follow-up to their MV3 model for 2014 but they did change the uppers and launched the Newton Tri Racer last month.\n\nThe Newton Tri Racer (MSRP $125 USD) is designed for sprint and International distance triathlons and perfect for athletes looking for speed in a short distance zero drop racing flat – 5K to 10K racing or speed work on the track. The one-piece seamless upper secures the foot with elastic speed lacing for fast transitions and a sleek and responsive ride.\n\nFor a triathlete, when you are transitioning from cycling in competition or from anything else when training, you don’t need socks or have time to tie your shoe laces, the Tri Racer speed lacing system and heel tab is no problem.\n\nThe uppers is made of a lightweight breathable quick-drying mesh with 360 degree reflectivity. There are seamless overlays that are anatomically placed to provide a secure fit. It also includes metatarsal stretch panels in the forefoot stretch to reduce irritation.\n\nThe outsole is identical to the Newton MV3 – high traction 5-lug midfoot pattern with high density rubber in the heel and toe area. There are met-flex grooves in the forefoot allow the foot to flex naturally. Additionally, like in the MV3, there are drainage holes in the forefoot to allow water to drain out the bottom of the shoe.\n\nSo how did the Newton Tri Racer perform?\n\nMy pair (US Size 10.5) of Newton Tri Racer weighs in at 6.6 ounces, is zero drop, and has a stack height of about 16mm at midfoot (assuming lugs are flat on foot strike). The first time I put the Tri Racer on, they feel a little tight around the top of my foot and ankle area – the sock-like fit from the one piece upper is a little narrow and I recommend sizing up by a half-size. The length and toe box width are both fine though.\n\nIf you like the Newton MV3, this feels exactly the same – ride, breathability, comfort, and running gait. The speed lacing (or lace-less) system and heel tab makes it easy to put the shoes on and off so you can also use it for other purposes like running errands!\n\nOne noticeable difference between the Newton MV3 and Tri Racer is the additional seamless overlays in the toe box area for the Tri Racer. Even though there are metatarsal stretch panels in the forefoot stretch to reduce irritation, the toe area felt more snug than the MV3 – no hot spots or blisters though. My preference is towards the MV3 since I have a 2E width foot…\n\nNow that I have started cycling more, I’m thinking as to why you need two different shoes and have to change into and out of them during a triathlon or Ironman event. Why can’t I wear the Newton Tri Racer for cycling and running? I’ve been doing all my cycling in a Topo Athletic Sante minimal shoe. I usually run a 5K or 10K, hydrate, and then ride for 15 to 25 miles – all wearing a single shoe for both running and cycling. I would not normally run with the Sante as it is a cross fit shoe – too much structure, heavier, and bulkier. But if I can efficiently run and cycle with the same shoe like the Tri Racer, I don’t have to buy an expensive cycling shoe or carry extra baggage or have to change in and out of them. Just thinking outside the box a bit…\n\nThe Newton Tri Racer is currently available in a single colorway for men and for women:\n\nThe Newton Tri Racer is now available for purchase at: Zappos\n\n*Product provided by Newton.
