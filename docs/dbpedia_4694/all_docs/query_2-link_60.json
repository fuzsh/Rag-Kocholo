        "text": "Q: Tell us about your high school career and what the recruiting process has been like thus far.\n\nA: Throughout my high school career, I’ve played Varsity and started as a running back and linebacker. I’m the captain of my team. I’ve had JMU and W&M coaches attend my high school to visit me, and I have been asked to attend several Junior days and spring practices. I attended VMI, Columbia, UPenn, W&M, UVA, JMU, ODU and have several summer camps planned. In addition, I’ve attended combine camps. I recently won fastest man with the fastest 40 (4.6) and MVP RB at a Richmond, VA VTO camp. I was also 2nd with the vertical jump 32.9 inches and 5th at bench press with 16 reps of 185 lbs. I have a recruiter who is a contact for me (Aaron Brady, 717-881-8918) in addition to my high school coach (Chad Ceisel, 312-286-9383))\n\nQ: What would you consider to be your biggest accomplishment in your sports career so far?\n\nA: I was proud of my junior year season my stats were: 2023 Season Highlights – 193.4 Rushing Yards Per Game – 30 Rushing Touchdowns – 1934 Total Rushing Yards – 11.9 Yards Per Carry\n\nQ: What do you consider to be one of the more important things you learned from the coaching staff while playing at your school?\n\nA: My coaching staff has been very supportive of me and my career. They have taught me that winning is in the preparation and that we don’t have to be the biggest team to win championships. We have a lot of grit.\n\nQ: What would your current teammates say about you and your qualities?\n\nA: My teammates have chosen me to be the captain of the team. They were interviewed by the local news when I won Falcon Club player of the week. They talked about me being tough and fast but also a good teammate and thanking them for blocking for me and supporting them.\n\nQ: What has been one of the most memorable plays of your career so far?\n\nA: The most memorable play for me in my career was the winning touchdown for the state championship of my sophomore year. I’ve never felt that feeling before and embracing my teammates after that came brought so much emotion.\n\nQ: What has been your biggest challenge and how do you manage it?\n\nA: I play both ways, so it takes a lot of stamina. I take a lot of hits and it can feel like I don’t have anything left towards the end of a game, but I have to dig dip and find it. I’ve learned what nutrition and training helps and how to stay in the right mental zone.\n\nQ: If you could compare yourself to a collegiate or pro athlete, who would that be and why?\n\nA: I would compare myself to Christian McCaffrey. He isn’t the biggest guy on the field but he’s tough, he’s a fighter, he’s fast and he sees the field.\n\nQ: What is your biggest strength and why should college coaches & scouts consider you?\n\nA: I’d want them to see my toughness, strength, speed/agility, that I’m a versatile player and a good teammate. My season results and results in my combines have shown that I am a MVP in my state, among the schools in my area, and at combines I attend. I just need coaches and scouts to watch me play and give me a shot.\n\nQ: If you could play in college, what would you choose to major in? What are your plans if football doesn’t work out?\n\nA: I plan to major in computer engineering. I plan to do this whether I play football or not.\n\nQ: Are you involved in mentoring, a charity or do you “give back”/”pay it forward” in your community?\n\nA: I’m involved in community service activities through my school. In addition, to playing multiple sports, maintaining a 4.2 I also work for my dad’s moving company. We assist many elderly people through this work.\n\nQ: What are your goals for the 2024 season?\n\nA: I plan to maintain my 4.2 GPA, have a great senior season with stat goals of enter the stats you hope to obtain, receive college football offers, and end with a great basketball season as well.\n\nQ: What would be your ultimate achievement?\n\nA: I would like to get college offers at schools that will help set me up for future success both academically and athletically.\n\nQ: What do you enjoy doing when not playing football? Do you play other sports?\n\nA: I have also played baseball and basketball since I was little (Allstate, All Central VA in those and captain of basketball also). This year I took baseball off to focus on football recruiting and training since this is my most important spring.\n\nQ: Who is or has been the most influential person in your life?\n\nA: My older brother has had a lot of influence in my life since we shared a room growing up. I watched him play sports. He is now a computer engineer and I also have an interest in that field, so we have a lot in common. Seeing his successes and how he has made his way (and competing with him) has helped drive me.\n\nQ: What is something unique about you that people would find interesting?"
