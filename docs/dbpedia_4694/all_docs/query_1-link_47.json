        "text": "Read about: Newton Unveils its 2013 Line\n\nNewton uses a unique forefoot technology that makes the most out of your stride. With a new technology comes a little more time to harness it’s functionality. The technology takes advantage of the natural mid-foot landing and uses the forefoot wedge to give an added push to each of your stride. I started training with Newton, in particular Newton Gravity a few months ago. It rewards powerful strides and natural mid-foot landing though it took me a lot of time to get used to it. Slowly but surely, running felt more natural with Newton and by then I decided to take it on a debut race.\n\nNewton Gravity\n\nDesigned for neutral runners, the Newton Gravity can be used as a daily training shoe for faster-paced tempo runs, interval sessions, and as race shoe. The Gravity features Action/ReactionTM technology in the midfoot and heel, a biomechanical metatarsal sensor plate, and enhanced midfoot flexibility. The open air mesh upper is extremely breathable and quick drying. A high density outersole and carbon heel promote excellent durability for even the highest mileage runners. The Newton Gravity weighs 9.1 ounces and has a heel-to-toe drop of 3mm.\n\nI really like flashy shoes and the Superman colorway of the Newton Gravity is just perfect for me. 9.1 ounce is lightweight enough for a race shoe. Among the 2013 Newton Running shoes, it has the highest heel-to-toe drop of 3mm, which gives the strongest push of the toes for each stride. This rewards those with powerful strides and the harder you push yourself, the more powerful your stride will be. This is probably the reason it’s called Gravity since it uses the drop to power the forefoot wedge for the next stride.\n\nThe debut race for my Newton Gravity was the 16.8 kilometer Adidas King of the Road Distance. All I can say, it was an efficient race with me taking advantage of the mid-foot, push of the toe from the forefoot wedge technology. The movement felt more natural and rhythmic and it develops the natural running mid-foot landing so the longer you use the shoes, the more you are adept to the natural running technology. I also like how the forefoot wedge helps when it comes to hills by being a ladder that pushes you uphill and a cushion that protects your feet downhill. The shoes is also breathable which reduces excessive heat in the feet from continuous running and pounding. I also used my Newton Gravity on my indoor duathlon and the traction of the shoes with the treadmill was just perfect.\n\nIn a nutshell, here’s why I like Newton Gravity\n\nFlashy colorway\n\n9.1 ounce lightweight\n\n3mm forefoot wedge makes the most out of your stride\n\nbreathable shoes\n\ngreat for hills\n\nperfect traction with treadmills\n\nNewton Distance\n\nDesigned for more efficient runners, the Newton Distance is a lightweight neutral performance trainer ideal for interval sessions, tempo sessions, and even for racing. Featuring a highly breathable, quick drying open air mesh, minimal anatomical support strapping, Action/ReactionTM technology in the midfoot, biomechanical metatarsal sensor plate, and Met-flex enhanced midfoot flexibility. The Newton Distance weighs 7.8 ounces and has a heel-to-toe drop of 2mm."
