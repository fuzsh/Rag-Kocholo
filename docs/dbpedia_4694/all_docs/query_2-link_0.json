        "text": "Newton Running has always been a community as much as it has been company - and anyone who has given (or received) an, “I like your Newton’s!” comment while out for a run knows what we mean! Our sponsored Athletes and Ambassadors’ accomplishments exemplify this sentiment. Deeper than an any age-group win, social media post or even World Championship title - they’re adventurers and philanthropists, record breakers and local heroes.\n\nSo, it’s no surprise when the craziness of 2020 hit the Newton 2020 Ambassador Team rose to the challenge. Ambassadors began thinking outside the box as they adapted and overcame obstacles. Professional athletes, whose races were suddenly canceled, began looking for records rather than finish lines to break. As we close out the year, we’d like to give recognition and remind everyone of some of the amazing accomplishments from this 2020 Ambassador Team.\n\nStand-Out Stories:\n\n12. Doc Golden walks 38 miles for her 38th birthday - uniting a community while doing so.\n\n\"I was SO happily surprised at the outpouring of support of my friends, family, teammates and followers! 92 of my friends participated, on 5 continents and in 14 US states!!! Unbelievable. So much fun and it was seriously, like the best and biggest birthday party ever!\" - Doc Golden, shoe of choice: the Gravity\n\n11. Justin Daniels completes the Goggin 4x4x48 challenge (twice) - running 4 miles every 4 hours for a total of 48 miles within 48 hours.\n\n“When I set out to complete the Goggins 4x4x48 Challenge I wanted to test my mind, body and soul. What I found was that I could go further and harder than my brain was telling me to. After completing it the first time, I ended up getting 5 other groups started out so they could see how tough they were. With the goal and the right friends talking to you, I've realized that you are able to do anything you set your mind to no matter how tough it is.\" -Justin Daniels, shoe of choice: the Distance\n\n10. Triny Willerton wins USA Triathlon's Tri-ing to Inspire Award. This award honors a woman who has overcome adversity through dedication to multi-sport, and has used it to inspire other women.\n\n\"I believe that life gives us opportunities and it is up to us what we choose to do with them. There is not one day that goes by that I don’t think about how fortunate I am to be here. This is what drives me every day to work as hard as I can to change things. There is a lot of work to be done and it takes a village but I know that we will make roads safer together.\" -Triny Willerton, shoe of choice: the Gravity\n\n9. JT Peebles runs his 8th consecutive Boston Marathon virtually, qualifying for his 9th!\n\n\"Although my 8th consecutive Boston Marathon was virtual it was a thrill to complete at an actual BQ race. The Wabash Marathon didn’t disappoint and the 3:03:26 earned me a spot at Boston for my 9th year in a row! What a blessing! I look forward to rocking my Newtons once again and hope we can all safely run an in person event later in 2021.\" -JT Peebles, shoe of choice: the Distance\n\n8. Jackie Hering wins Ironman 70.3 Campeche\n\n“Smooth transition (to the run) and off I went feeling just fine and in 2nd)… so I doubled down on my plan to just run hard.” – Jackie Hering, shoe of choice: the Distance\n\n7. Harvey Lewis sets a Fastest Known Time, breaking a 29-year-old record, running 146 miles from Death Valley (276 ft below sea level) to the summit of Mt. Whitney Summit (14,505 feet)\n\n“At mile 122 I felt completely inept of energy, like the desert had taken all of my resources. If you had asked me then I would have said my chances were less than 1%.” – Harvey Lewis, shoe of choice: the BOCO AT\n\n6. Chris McDonald breaks the World Record of summiting the most 14,000 ft mountains in 24 hours - 10 in 21 hours and 50 minutes.\n\n“His (Chris) dedication took on a deeper meaning after the senseless murder of my little cousin, Nathan Garza... Our family took a baseball from Nathan’s practice bag and wrote messages of love on it. Chris carried the baseball for the entire 21 hours and 50 minutes, leaving it on top of the last summit”. – Erkia McDonald (Chris’ Wife), shoe of choice: the BOCO AT\n\n5. Bear Optiz a Colorado Wildland Firefighter bravely battles the frontlines of the largest forest fire in Colorado history.\n\n“Wildland firefighting is measured in a ‘two more chains’ mindset, which usually means the end isn’t near… training should be geared towards endurance and durability.” -Bear Optiz, shoe of choice: the Gravity AW\n\n4. Brent and Kyle Pease of the Kyle Pease Foundation run the NYC Marathon, virtually.\n\n“The New York Marathon was more than I could have imagined…it more than satisfied our quench. Just being out on the road together. Cheering and pushing ourselves made us feel like we ran the boroughs! Can’t wait for the real thing.” -Brent Pease, shoes of choice: the Distance-Elite and Distance\n\n3. Lyndy Davis competes at the 2020 Olympic Marathon Trials.\n\n“Consistency, keep laying a big foundation of work and mileage. Your legs don't forget what fast feels like!” - Lyndy Davis, shoe of choice: the Distance S\n\n2. Brian Hackenburg climbs 343 flights of stairs to honor the fallen heroes of 9/11.\n\n\"The stair climb to me was about honoring the real heroes of 9/11: the firefighters, law enforcement, and the courageous stories of citizens helping each other out that day. It's our way to never forget. As long as I am able to, I will be climbing theses stairs every 9/11 and thinking about the families of the fallen heroes. I spent 2002 in Washington DC for the fallen firefighters memorial, and to see the procession of bus after bus of the families of the fallen was heart wrenching and something I'll never forget.\" -Brian Hackenburg, shoe of choice: the Gravity\n\n1. Jorge Garcia-Birke completes his 105th marathon while Kelsie Boren conquers her first!\n\n\"Marathon #105 was such a fun race for me! We got to visit a friend that we met while running in Antarctica, I got to run several miles with a buddy from home that just happened to be there, I got to see my Boo a few times on the out and back course, and I enjoyed the amazing views running along the beach of the Pacific Ocean. And now, in retrospect, this was the last race I got to run before the pandemic, so I'm holding on to those memories! I'm looking forward to seeing where my Newtons will take me next!\" -Jorge Garcia-Birke, shoe of choice: the Fate\n\n\"It was a great first experience! It’s soo different from the half marathon or any other distance. I’m ready for more!\"-Kelsie Boren, shoe of choice: the Kismet\n\nLast, but not least. Katie Spotz runs 137 miles nonstop across the state of Maine to raise over $30,000 for Life Water International, a non-profit organization helping 2 million people gain access to clean water and sanitation.\n\n“I didn't make the attempt because I had the confidence that it would be possible, but instead had the curiosity to find out.” - Katie Spotz, shoes of choice: the Motion & the Distance"
