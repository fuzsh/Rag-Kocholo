        "text": "World Triathlon Corporation announced today that Newton Running of Boulder, CO is the new official footwear and run course sponsor of Ironman, replacing Westlake Village, CA based K-Swiss who held that position for the last 3 years.\n\n\"Ironman is extremely pleased to join forces with Newton Running,â said Andrew Messick, Chief Executive Officer of World Triathlon Corporation. \"We truly believe in the product Newton Running offers, as they have certainly had a valuable impact on Ironman competition. We look forward to sharing Newtonâs vast running expertise with the IRONMAN community during our partnership.\"\n\nAccording to the press release, Newton Running will serve as the Ironman community's resource for healthy running and is supporting Ironman events across the country starting with the 2013 Accenture Ironman 70.3 California in Oceanside, CA on March 30. Newtonâs plans for full event activation, designed to elevate the athlete experience on and off the race course, will begin at the Memorial Hermann Ironman Texas triathlon on May 18.\n\n\"Newton Running was 'born' at Ironman when we sold our first pair of Newton Running shoes at the Ironman 70.3 California event in 2007,\" said Newton Running CEO Jerry Lee of the 3-year partnership. \"Triathletes were the first to embrace our innovative technology and gave us the start we needed to become the running-shoe brand we are today. This sponsorship is a celebration of our heritage in triathlon and our desire to support the sport and the athletes who believed in us from the beginning.\"\n\n3-time Ironman World Champion Craig Alexander, Tim Berkel, Rachel Joyce and Chris McDonald are among the Pros who are currently running in Newton shoes and quite a few celebrities have been spotted in these very distinctive colorful running shoes.\n\nIt is not clear at this time though if K-Swiss will retain the official apparel sponsorship of Ironman, a title they had held in addition to the footwear and run course sponsorship."
