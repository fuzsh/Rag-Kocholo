Newton beat out such star athletes as American League MVP Josh Donaldson, Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones and WBC heavyweight boxing champion Deontay Wilder, who won last year.\n\nNewton was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player and offensive player of the year by The Associated Press. He set team records with 500 points scored and 59 touchdowns.\n\nNewton became the first player in league history with at least 30 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns in a single season. His 45 total touchdowns were more than any other player in the NFL last season."
