        "text": "BOULDER, Colo., March 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Running evokes many different feelings. Ask any runner and the answer will be different. But ask those who wear Newton Running® shoes and their responses may be very similar. To be able to feel the ground beneath them and to connect to their surroundings, but with the ability to go as far as they desire. To feel free, alive, empowered and a part of something. It's all about the FEEL.\n\nNewton Running, the Boulder, Colorado-based leader in performance running shoes, is partnering with Timex® to ask runners nationwide to express how running makes them FEEL by spelling out words with their run routes, launching a first-ever initiative on this scale.\n\nInspired by Newton's new FEEL Campaign and an emerging trend among runners, which has seen a romantic runner in Hampshire, UK propose to his fiance by spelling the words \"will you marry me\" with an elaborate running route, The Run It, FEEL It, Spell It Challenge will encourage runners to track their run routes using GPS devices. Runners will then submit GPS map screen grabs – and the words therein – through Twitter and Instagram using the hashtags #RunningMakesMeFeel and #promo to win prizes including a lifetime supply of Newton Running shoes and the opportunity to be featured – with their words – in a 2015 national print ad campaign.\n\n\"There is something special about the feeling you get when you join a group of like-minded people who encourage you to rise up and run,\" said Mike Nesladek, vice president of marketing for Newton Running. \"We at Newton Running exist to make every stride better so runners can tap into the incomparable feeling of connecting with their run. Now we are asking runners around the country: how does running make you FEEL?\"\n\nThe Run It, FEEL It, Spell It Challenge kicks off March 18 and will run until May 1, 2015. The challenge is open to all runners and running enthusiasts in the U.S. To learn more about The Run It, FEEL It, Spell It Challenge including rules and prizing, as well as a tutorial video on how to participate, visit www.NewtonRunning.com.
