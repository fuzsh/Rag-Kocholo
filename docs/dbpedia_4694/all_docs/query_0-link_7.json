        "text": "Newton Running Shoes: A Leader in Sustainability\n\nCommitted to sustainability, Newton Running helps promote a sustainable future. In recent years, sustainability has become a central focus of the brand, as they recognized that the consumption of running shoes leads to a significant amount of waste.\n\nIn an effort to increase the sustainability of their shoes, Newton Running looked at each component of the shoe and identified opportunities for improvement. The soles of running shoes are traditionally made from petroleum products, which can take over 50 years to biodegrade. Newton Running innovated the traditional running shoe design by incorporating an additive called EcoPure into its sole, which works to accelerate the biodegradation process. They also use compostable shoe boxes and craft every single pair of running shoes with an upper thatâ€™s made from recycled bottles! This means that a pair of Newton Running shoes can take as little as 10 years to biodegrade.\n\nShop Newton Running shoes today at Newsole Running and discover performance-oriented running shoes that are sustainable and designed for runners by runners!"
