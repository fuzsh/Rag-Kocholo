        "text": "Newton Running’s Mission is to be the world’s leader in natural running shoe technology and form. Maybe this is why they are founded under the man’s name who stated, “For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”\n\nSir Isaac Newton’s third law means that in every interaction, there is a pair of forces acting on the two interacting objects. The size of the forces on the first object equals the size of the force on the second object. The direction of the force on the first object is opposite to the direction of the force on the second object. Forces always come in pairs – equal and opposite action-reaction force pairs.\n\nThis theory could be why Newton Running developed their patented Action/Reaction™ technology providing dynamic shock absorption, energy return, ground feel, minimal heel-to-toe drop, and lightweight comfort. Newton’s patented technology and the company as a whole is based on three founding principles:\n\nThey love runners.\n\nNewton loves running. They eat, dream and sleep running. Marathons, ultramarathons, 5Ks, triathlons, trail runs, group runs, track workouts – you name it, they are there.\n\nThey love teaching,\n\nThey love helping people who want to improve their running form, efficiency and performance. They recommend several small run technique tips that can unlock big improvements, and compliment the Newton ride.\n\nThey want to make a difference\n\nNewton Running believes strongly in the adage “To whom much is given, much is required.” Newton is proud to sponsor several local organizations and charities including Soles 4 Souls, Trickle Up, and One World Running\n\nNewton Styles We Carry\n\nNewton Fate 6 – Neutral\n\nIn Stores Now Price: $140 Weight: 8.8oz Men / 7.2oz Women Stack: Unlisted, 4.5mm offset\n\nBrand new to the RWS family, the Newton Fate 6 is a responsive and lightweight trainer that is packed full of unique technologies that separate it from any other product we carry. The most notable feature unique to Newton is the Action/Reaction membrane in the forefoot, which is a set of 5 lugs that create a “trampoline-like” cushioning system for quicker bounce-back and minimal energy loss as compared to a traditional foam running shoe. The membranes are tuned specifically by gender, as well as the men and women’s Fate having unique lasts. The Fate 6 features a seamless 3-D Air Mesh upper with a moderately padded tongue and heel counter, and is plush when compared to previous models. The low offset combined with responsive cushioning make the Fate a fantastic pull for customers that enjoy shoes like the Saucony Kinvara, Altra Escalante, and On Cloudflow.\n\nMain Talking Points\n\nAction/Reaction membrane provides an underfoot sensation truly unique to Newton\n\nGender-specific lasts and membranes tune the ride specifically to the wearer\n\nMesh upper combined with padded tongue and heel collar ensures a secure and comfortable lockdown\n\nLow-drop construction enables a natural gait cycle\n\nNewton Kismet 6 – Guidance\n\nIn Stores Now Price: $140 Weight: 9.2oz Men / 7.8oz Women Stack: Unlisted, 4.5mm offset\n\nThe Newton Kismet is a sister shoe to the Newton Fate, featuring the same technologies as the Fate, but with an added dual-density medial support for the overpronator. The same webbed Action/Reaction membrane is seen in the forefoot, giving the Kismet a trampoline-like ride that is reminiscent of the Fate, but with an added splash of stability. Also brought over from the Fate are the gender-specific tuned membrane and last. The Newton Kismet is best pulled for people seeking a stability shoe that is lightweight and nimble, and is comparable to the Brooks Ravenna.\n\nMain Talking Points\n\nGender-specific last and tuning for a personalized ride\n\nThe same Action/Reaction membrane as the Fate, unique to Newton\n\nLightest-weight stability shoe at TRWS\n\nLow-drop enables a more natural gait cycle"
