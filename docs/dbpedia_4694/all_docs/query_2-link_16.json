        "text": "BOULDER, Colo. –\n\nSince 2007, Boulder-based Newton Running has been at the forefront of running shoe technology with its patented Action/Reaction Technology. It focuses on optimal or natural running gait, promoting impact on the forefoot instead of the heel. According to Newton Running, this change along with the use of their shoes will keep the runner running more efficiently, thus saving energy, keeping them injury-free, and running faster.\n\nWith the help of newly appointed President Stephen Gartside, Newton Running recently opened its first retail store of its own. After a year of simply partnering with other shoe stores around the country and around the world, Newton Running opened the Newton Running Lab on 1300 Walnut St. in downtown Boulder.\n\n1. What makes Newton Running shoes different from other running shoes?\n\nIt’s the first shoe line designed for natural running. When you take your shoes off and run barefoot you run on the balls of your feet but when you put your shoes back on you tend to strike in other areas. The technology in every shoe is in the mid-foot/fore-foot section; the four lugs (on the bottom of the shoe) are the secret sauce. As they recess into a chamber when pressure is applied, it cuts down on pressure absorbed by 44 percent over the average running shoe … and by coming back out they give 28 percent greater energy return; soft land and repulsion.\n\n2. What do you see as the future of Newton Running?\n\nNewton Running has had a lot of success, we are here to stay. We have a sustainable market in triathlons as well as endurance running. We have a future for all types of runners of every experience level … We are looking to be successful in the United States as well as globally.\n\n3. There are a lot of athletes that wear your shoes in competitions and training. Is this sponsorship or did they approach you?\n\nWe have many top athletes that have tried and loved the shoe and wrote about it in their blogs. Those aren’t through sponsorship. Craig Alexander, reigning Ironman World Champion, and Josh Cox, nationally recognized U.S. marathoner, are sponsored athletes. They came to us after trying the shoes and wanted a sponsorship.\n\n4. What is the concept behind opening the Newton Running Lab?\n\nWe wanted a place where we could have our own retail store and see what works well in the retail environment. We let people put on any Newton shoes and demo them before purchasing. They can come in and try a pair on and then take them for a run on the Boulder Creek Trail.\n\n5. How often do you run and what shoes do you wear?\n\nI run seven days a week and have raced six times in the past three months…including the Bolder Boulder … I only run in Newton shoes. I had a profound experience in these shoes that after 30 years (of running in other shoes) it really felt different than others and helped me run faster."
