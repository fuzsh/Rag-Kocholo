        "text": "Tokyo 2020 Olympics silver medallist Nicola Olyslager headlines a 75-member Australian athletics team for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nThe Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) named an additional 55 track and field athletes on Monday, adding to the 20 selected earlier this year.\n\nThis is the second largest Australian athletics team to be sent to an Olympic Games after Sydney 2000. They will compete in 39 of the 48 athletics events in Paris.\n\nOlyslager, who won the silver medal in women’s high jump at Tokyo 2020, will compete in her second Summer Games. The squad also includes Tokyo 2020 javelin throw bronze medallist Kelsey-Lee Barber and decathlon bronze winner Ash Moloney.\n\nWhile Moloney will also be competing in his second Olympics like Olyslager, Kelsey will become a three-time Olympian in Paris. Only Genevieve Gregson and Kathryn Mitchell will be taking part in their fourth Summer Games from the Australian athletics squad.\n\nThe squad announced on Monday also includes world champion pole vaulter Nina Kennedy and world championships medallists pole vaulter Kurtis Marschall and javelin thrower Mackenzie Little.\n\nRising sprinter Torrie Lewis will make her Summer Games debut in the 200m and 4x100m relay events after a wonderful year that included winning a Diamond League event and helping the women’s 4x100m qualify for Paris.\n\n“After having such an amazing year getting the official selection is just a relief,” the 19-year-old Torrie said. “I’ve always thought I could make an individual event, but actually getting the call is so exciting.\n\n“Ever since watching the London 2012 Games it’s been something I’ve wanted to do, originally for gymnastics but now for running. After Tokyo is when I really started having Paris in my sights,” she added.\n\nAustralia will contest the heptathlon for the first time since Beijing 2008 with Camryn Newton-Smith and Tori West.\n\nMeanwhile, Connor Murphy will make his Olympic debut in men’s triple jump, following in the footsteps of his father and coach Andrew who contested the event at three Games.\n\nNational record holder Matthew Denny too will make his third Olympic appearance in the discus throw. He is the reigning Diamond League and Commonwealth Games champion.\n\nPeter Bol and Michelle Jenneke are also part of the Australian athletics squad.\n\nThe Australian squad includes both the men’s and women’s 4x100m relay squad – the first time both have been part of an Australian Olympic Team together since Sydney 2000.\n\nThe athletics events at Paris 2024 will be held between August 1 and 11. Track and field events, to be held at the Stade de France, are scheduled between August 2 and 10.\n\nRace walking will be held at Trocadero on August 1 and 7 while the men’s marathon (August 10) and the women’s marathon (August 11) at Hôtel de Ville (start) and Invalides (finish)."
