        "text": "More than 30,000 runners are running from Hopkinton to Boston today, April 15, for the 128th running of the Boston Marathon.\n\nWith the four elite races complete, Helen Obiri of Kenya, Sisay Lema of Ethiopia, Eden Rainbow-Cooper of England and Marcel Hug of Switzerland won their respective races. The Bank of America Boston Marathon Official Charity Program features 168 non-profit organizations with a goal of raising $50 million around this year’s race.\n\nThe BAA Racing App will also host the race's leaderboards and unofficial results for runners as they cross the finish line. The BAA website will offer the ability to search for athletes during the race and view leaderboards in real time.\n\nEnjoy Patriots' Day and head out to the course to cheer the non-professional runners on.\n\nHow did the heat affect the runners\n\nBoston had its warmest day of 2024 on Marathon Monday with a high in the low 70s. As of 6 p.m. Monday, 77 athletes had been transported to local hospitals.\n\nThis was a dramatic increase over the 2023 Boston Marathon when the high was in the 50s and it was raining.\n\n2024 Boston Marathon Para Athletics Division winners\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association announced the winners of the seven para athletic divisions, which are separate from the professional wheelchair division.\n\nT11/T12 (Vision impairment) – Irwin Ramirez, 3:24:21 / Joyce Cron, 4:27:46\n\nT13 (Vision impairment) – Andrew Thorsen, 3:02:23 / Lisa Thompson, 4:00:58\n\nT45/T46 (Upper-limb impairment) – Atsbha Gebremeskel, 2:54:14 / Adrienne Keane, 4:44:26\n\nT61/T63/T43 (Lower-limb impairment) – Adam Popp, 3:11:56 / Tatsiana Khvitso-Trimborn, 4:00:04\n\nT62/T64; T42/T44 (Lower-limb impairment) – Marko Cheseto Lemtukei, 2:46:45 / Kelly Bruno, 3:31:30\n\nT35-T38 (Coordination impairment) – Joseph Drake, 4:32:44 / Cristina Burbach, 3:41:17\n\nT20 (Intellectual impairment) – Thomas Cantara, 2:35:23\n\nWhen is the 2025 Boston Marathon\n\nThe 2025 Boston Marathon will be on April 21, which will also be the celebration of the 250th anniversary of Battles of Lexington and Concord – the first battle of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nWhat are the Boston Marathon charities\n\nIn September, the Bank of America Marathon Official Charity Program announced the 160 approved organizations. Charity runners comprise about 10% of the total field, according to the Boston Athletic Association. Here is their list:\n\nMarcel Hug crashed wheelchair in Newton at Fire House turn while setting a course record\n\nOn his way to winning the 2024 Boston Marathon, Switzerland's Marcel Hug took a turn too quickly in his wheelchair. He crashed into the barriers and the crowd but was able to get back on the course.\n\n\"I just had too much, way too much, pressure on the steering,\" Hug said in an interview with WCVB after the race. \"It was my fault.\"\n\nHug finished the race in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 32 seconds, which broke his own previous course record set last year. His time in 2023 was 1 hour, 17 minutes and 6 seconds.\n\nWhat to know about the Boston Marathon After Party\n\nFor runners and fans who still have energy, Boston-based Samuel Adams is sponsoring an afterparty on Boston's City Hall Plaza. The event called \"Mile 27 Post-Race Party\" will begin at 5 p.m.\n\nThe event includes a crowning of the champions and will be hosted by Des Linden and Kara Goucher. Tickets are $15 per person. Registered athletes received an email in February with a unique code for a discount. Children under 12 will be allowed in for free but must be accompanied by an adult.\n\nTickets are on sale online.\n\nWhen will the roads reopen?\n\nAs most of the runners have passed the early part of the course, the course is starting to be returned to regular roads.\n\nFramingham and earlier points of the course have resumed regular traffic.\n\nHere’s when roads are expected to open:\n\nRoute 135 in Natick, 3 p.m.\n\nRoute 135 in Wellesley, 3:40 p.m.\n\nRoute 16 in Wellesley, 4:30 p.m.\n\nRoute 16 in Newton 4:45 p.m.\n\nCommonwealth Ave to Brighton, 5:20 p.m.\n\nChestnut Hill Ave., 5:45 p.m.\n\nCleveland Circle, 6 p.m.\n\nOther roads in Boston will open through 7 p.m.\n\nBoston Marathon bombing: Remembering the victims on the 11th anniversary\n\nApril 15 marks the 11th anniversary of deadly bombings at the finish line of 2013 Boston Marathon. Before the runners started, wreaths were laid at the site of both explosions as city and state leaders held moments of silence on Boylston Street and Taps was played.\n\nThree people were killed in the bombings --- Martin Richard, 8, Krystle Campbell, 29; and Lu Lingzi, 23, and more than 200 people were injured.\n\nMIT police Officer Sean Collier, 27, was killed days later during the manhunt for the bombers. Boston police Officer Dennis Simmonds died one year after responding to the shootout with the bombers.\n\nZdeno Chara crosses finish line\n\nGood work, Big Zee.\n\nRetired Boston Bruins player Zdeno Chara finished the 2024 Boston Marathon in 3 hours, 35 minutes and 9 seconds.\n\nThis is a marked improvement for the former hockey star, as last year, he finished in 3 hours, 38 minutes and 23 seconds.\n\nChara retired from the NHL in 2022. While many athletes wind down after their retirement, Chara ended up running in the 2023 Boston Marathon.\n\nSince then, he has been on a tear, running five more marathons, a 50-kilometer race and a triathlon in 2023.\n\nSince he has finished Boston, he is expected to run in the London Marathon on April 21.\n\nDespite hanging up his skates, Chara still has his running shoes on.\n\nA very good dog: Jimmy cheers for runners on Marathon route\n\nAuthor and journalist Barbara Walsh wrote a children's book about Spencer, a golden retriever who inspired thousands of Boston Marathon runners as they made their way down West Union Street (Route 135) in the early stages of the race.\n\nSpencer died in February 2023, at the age of 13. Last month, a statue was placed near his familiar Marathon post at 11 Frankland Road in Ashland. Several runners veered off course to check it out.\n\n\"I never met Spencer – I first read about him when The New York Times published an article about him, and I thought to get your obituary published in the New York Times you have to be pretty important, let alone as a dog,\" Walsh said. \"I watched videos of him and read about how special he was, and it was so inspiring to see the kind of hope he gave to people.\"\n\nMeanwhile Spencer's former owner, Rich Powers, was on the Marathon route in Ashland with his new dog, Jimmy. Jimmy is 1 year old, and is currently training as a therapy dog.\n\n\"Jimmy has done really well, considering his age,\" Powers said. \"He's been a good boy holding his stick and greeting people. I'm not sure Spencer would have done any better at the same age. It's been a hectic day, it's been so nice to see people stop by and say hello and get their photo taken with Jimmy and with the Spencer statue. There has been a great turnout here in Ashland, the place is packed.\" – Jesse Collings\n\nNew statue of Spencer cheers on runners\n\nA bronze good boy sits vigilantly, silently cheering on Marathon runners.\n\nThe golden retriever Spencer, who was a fixture of the Boston Marathon by holding Boston Strong flags in his mouth to greet runners passing by, died in February of last year.\n\nHowever, his likeness was cast in bronze and unveiled last month to honor his legacy.\n\nSpencer’s bronze statue can be found at 11 Frankland Road and was made by sculptor Buccacio Sculpture Services in Canton.\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association recognized Spencer in 2022 as the official dog of the 126th Boston Marathon.\n\nThe people living at 11 Frankland Road have dedicated a space on their property for Spencer’s statue, which the public is welcome to visit.\n\nCJ Albertson and Emma Bates: Top American finishers in the 2024 Boston Marathon\n\nHere are the top three American finishers in the Boston Marathon, men and women.\n\nCJ Albertson, of Fresno, California, was the fastest American man, placing seventh overall. He finished fifth in the U.S. Olympic Team Trials with a time of 2 hours, 10 minutes and 7 seconds. In this year’s Boston Marathon, he passed the finish line with a time of 2 hours, 9 minutes and 53 seconds.\n\nNext was U.S. Army technician and runner Elkanah Kibet, who finished with a time of 2 hours, 12 minutes and 32 seconds.\n\nRyan Eiler, of Boston, was the third American finisher, in 2 hours, 14 minutes and 22 seconds.\n\nBoston resident Emma Bates is a standout American runner competing. A Boise State NCAA champion in the 10,000-meter run and finished fifth last year, she finished the 2024 Boston Marathon in 2 hours, 27 minutes and 14 seconds.\n\nSara Hall, who remains the second-fastest American woman to run the half-marathon, finished the Boston Marathon with a time of 2 hours, 27 minutes and 58 seconds.\n\nAmerican runner Desiree Linden finished with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes and 27 seconds.\n\nHelen Obiri of Kenya wins the women’s division of the 2024 Boston Marathon\n\nHellen Obiri wins the women’s professional race after breaking away from the group during the final miles of the Boston Marathon.\n\nObiri is 34 years old and from Kenya.\n\nThis is her second win in Boston. She also won the 2023 Boston Marathon.\n\nShe is the first back-to-back winner since fellow Kenyan Catherine Ndereba won in 2004 and 2005.\n\nShe ran the Marathon in 2 hours, 22 minutes and 37 seconds.\n\nSisay Lemma wins Men’s Division of Boston Marathon\n\nSisay Lemma wins the men’s elite race for 2024 Boston Marathon of 2 hours 6 minutes 17 seconds.\n\nThe 33-year-old from Ethiopia. Lemma led the Professional Men’s Division through the whole 2024 marathon.\n\nThis is his third time running the Boston Marathon. He did not finish the race last year but completed it in 2019 with a time of 2 hours, 22 minutes and 8 seconds.\n\n“Lemma is coming off a memorable win at the Valencia Marathon in 2:01:48, making him the fourth fastest marathoner in history,” according to the Boston Athletic Association. “He was champion of the TCS London Marathon in 2021 and leads a field of 20 men whose personal bests are below 2:10:00.”\n\nHe is the first Ethiopian to win the race since 2016, according to ESPN.\n\nCJ Albertson is top American, coming in 7th with a time of 2:09:53.\n\nWhat are the different Boston Marathon bib colors?\n\nThe Boston Marathon bibs are color coded based on what start wave the runner was in. According to the Boston Athletics Association, \"Red bibs (numbers 201 to 7,800) are assigned to Wave 1 (10:00 a.m.). White bibs (numbers 8,000 to 15,999) are assigned to Wave 2 (10:25 a.m.). Blue bibs (numbers 16,000 to 23,999) are assigned to Wave 3 (10:50 a.m.) Yellow bibs (numbers 24,000 to 32,999) are assigned to Wave 4 (11:15 a.m.).\"\n\nWhat it's like watching the Boston Marathon at Mile 11\n\nThe Boston Marathon is just another manic Monday for those living along the route. Seemingly stuck at home, while thousands run past, gleaming with sweat, and breathing heavily.\n\nThe first cyclists zoom by to a flurry of shouts from the neighborhood, but as the Elite runners from both the men and women categories saunter past, those cheers slowly begin their day-long crescendo.\n\nSure, there is a break in the constant \"woo,\" \"you got it,\" and \"keep going,\" but the break is filled with the sound of thousands of sneakers pounding the pavement.\n\nAs the runners continue to make their way past mile 11 or so, exhaustion begins to creep across their faces, every foot forward is an unimaginable effort.\n\n\"Keep going,\" \"You got it,\" and another round of \"woo\" to keep them going, isn't that what living along the route is all about? – Sarah Barnacle\n\nWhat it is like watching the Boston Marathon on Ashland\n\nRobin Hicks, who lives on Frankland Road in Ashland, provided a few audience members with an exclusive view of the Marathon course.\n\n“It’s a great event, I do this every year,” Hicks said. “We own 16 acres of what used to be a Christmas tree farm, and it's right on the route. It’s amazing to see so many runners, of all ages.\n\n\"I’m 70 and I tell my wife, Cynthia, I’m going to run this when I am 75.”\n\nHow much does the winner of the Boston Marathon get as prize money\n\nRecognition isn’t the only thing athletes compete for; there’s the prize money after all.\n\nThe Boston Marathon is offering five- to six-figure rewards for the top finishers in the competition, with a $50,000 bonus for those who set new course records in the open division and wheelchair division.\n\nIn the open division, the first-place prize is $150,000, the second-place prize is $75,000 and the third-place runner receives $40,000.\n\nIn the wheelchair division for T53/54/34 competitors, the first-, second-, and third-place prizes are valued at $40,000, $25,000 and $12,000.\n\nTo get the $50,000 course record bonus, open division male runners will have to beat Geoffrey Mutai’s record time of 2 hours, 3 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\nOpen division female runners will have to beat Buzunesh Deba’s time of 2 hours, 19 minutes and 59 seconds.\n\nMale wheelchair athletes will have to beat Marcel Hug’s record of 1 hour, 17 minutes and 6 seconds, while female wheelchair athletes must beat Manuela Schär’s 1 hour, 28 minutes and 17 seconds to get the bonus.\n\nTo learn more about the prize money rewards for master division, para athletes and more, visit here.\n\nWhere is Heartbreak Hill?\n\nHeartbreak Hill is the name of a long incline on the marathon racecourse from miles 18 to 21 on Commonwealth Avenue in Newton.\n\nIt’s called Heartbreak Hill because it’s where many runners “hit the wall” and become suddenly fatigued. The hill part comes from the fact that it’s the last of the four Newton Hills.\n\nThere is a deeper story, however.\n\nHow did Heartbreak Hill get its name? A RI marathon legend was at the heart of that story\n\nIn the 1936 Boston Marathon, Narragansett athlete Ellison Myers Brown, known as Tarzan Brown, got a hot lead in the race until competitor John Kelley overtook him on the last Newton Hill, giving Brown a pat on the back before passing him.\n\nBrown would then win the 1936 marathon, breaking Kelley’s heart. A journalist would later coin the name Heartbreak Hill.\n\nMarMon tradition\n\nAs the first group of runners passed Wellesley College, senior Parker Phillips said it's bittersweet that she's attending her last \"MarMon\" -- what Wellesley students call Marathon Monday.\n\n\"Right now the feeling hasn't hit me yet,\" she said. \"But my friends and I usually head into Boston, and that's when the sadness will start for me because it's our last Marathon.\"\n\nEden Rainbow-Cooper wins women's wheelchair\n\nQualifying time for the Boston Marathon\n\nNot just anyone can compete in one of the biggest marathons in the country.\n\nTo qualify for the Boston Marathon, you must achieve a qualifying time depending on your gender and age group.\n\nFor men ages 18 to 34, they must complete a marathon in 3 hours or less. For women and nonbinary people, they must complete a marathon in 3 hours and 30 minutes or less.\n\nBeyond the age of 34, qualifying times increase by increments of five minutes with each age group, which are separated by four-year divisions. For example, one age group is 35 to 39, another is 40 to 44, etc.\n\nOnce a person has obtained their qualifying time, they must submit a qualifying application. After that they will receive an acceptance or rejection email concerning their application.\n\nDue to field size limitations, achieving the qualifying standard does not guarantee entry, only the opportunity to apply.\n\nJohn Anderson, sports anchor covering Boston Marathon, announces ESPN exit\n\nJohn Anderson, longtime sports anchor, has announced that he will be leaving SportsCenter and ESPN.\n\nAnderson, a veteran journalist of 25 years, will be leaving when his contract expires at the end of June. He said this on a March 28 episode of the Inside Wisconsin Show.\n\n\"I'm going to get to do a couple of track-and-field things,” he said. “I'm going to get to do the Boston Marathon and the New York Marathon.\"\n\nAnderson called the 2023 Boston Marathon and is covering this year’s Boston Marathon with another veteran sports journalist Hannah Storm.\n\n“It’s been a good run,” Anderson said.\n\nMarcel Hug of Switzerland wins men's wheelchair for the seventh time\n\nSmashing his course record for the second year in a row, Marcel Hug of Switzerland has won the men's wheelchair division. The new course record is 1:17:06.\n\nBoston Marathon leaderboard: Here's how to see who's ahead\n\nIf you're looking to track who's in the lead during the 128th Boston Marathon, there's no better way to do that than the leaderboard on the Boston Athletic Association's website. See who's leading the race here.\n\nBoston Marathon wheelchair times: How fast they go\n\nEvery year, wheelchair athletes are some of the fiercest competitors participating in the Boston Marathon. This year is no different.\n\nThe current high-performance standard for male wheelchair athletes is less than 1 hour and 31 minutes. For female wheelchair athletes, it’s less than 1 hour and 52 minutes.\n\nThe expected front-runners for the women in wheelchairs are course record holder and four-time Boston winner Manuela Schär, five-time winner Wakako Tsuchida and Paralympic gold medalist Madison de Rozario.\n\nSchär holds a record time of 1:28:17.\n\nOf the men’s division, Marcel Hug of Switzerland is an expected front-runner, as he set a time of 1:17:06 and won last year in Boston, his sixth win in the city.\n\nHug will have to face off against Daniel Romanchuk, two-time winner in Boston.\n\n'Scream Tunnel' is already making noise. What is it?\n\nA 9:30 a.m., students were already screaming at the course's halfway point at Wellesley College. \"Scream Tunnel\" is a Wellesley tradition where students scream for Boston Marathon runners -- and maybe even offer a kiss.\n\nSaid first-year student Julia Reste: \"There's no other college that that has a tradition that's baked into its campus (like this one).\"\n\nScores of Wellesley College students line up on route 135 and scream encouragement at runners, wave signs and offer high-fives and kisses to participants passing through, as the marathon’s halfway point is the Wellesley campus.\n\nThe idea is for runners to hear the screams of support from a mile-away, emboldening them to continue to see the excited crowds of students watching the marathon.\n\nThe signs vary from comedic to celebratory, but they’re usually all in the spirit of cheering on the marathon runners.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic put a pause on the kissing aspect of the tradition, but now it’s back in full force.\n\nAdded first-year student Teddy Hughes, who had landed about 15 kisses: \"I've got a bit of 'beard burn,' but it's great. I've been looking forward to this all year.\"\n\nCelebrities running the Boston Marathon 2024\n\nBoth the professional men and women started the race.\n\nIn addition to the professional athletes, a handful of celebrities run the race of every year. Here are some of the names from the Boston Athletic Association of people you might want to watch.\n\nMeb Keflezighi, 2014 Boston Marathon champion (most recent American men’s open division champion) – Bib 2014\n\nAmby Burfoot, 1968 Boston Marathon champion – Bib 1968\n\nZdeno Chara, former Boston Bruins captain – Bib 3333\n\nNicolas Kiefer, former tennis world No.4, Olympic silver medalist in men’s doubles – Bib 2004\n\nDaniel Humm, Michelin Star award-winning chef and restaurateur – Bib 6757\n\nMatt Wilpers, fitness coach and well-known trainer – Bib 30066\n\nChris Nikic, first person with Down syndrome to complete the Hawaii Ironman; also an Abbott Six Star Finisher – Bib 7796\n\nDave McGillivray, Boston Marathon race course director – Bib 100\n\nEvans Chebet is hoping to defend his title\n\nHistory is on the line in the 2024 Boston Marathon on Monday.\n\nThe Patriots' Day tradition will see 35-year-old Kenyan Evans Chebet attempt to defend his back-to-back titles and become only the fifth man in the race's more than 125-year history to win in three straight years.\n\nHellen Obiri, who completed the other half of a Kenyan sweep, will defend her title from a women's field that race organizers described as \"historically fast.\" Obiri will likely have to outlast a trio of women with personal bests under 2:18, including 2019 champion Worknesh Degefa.\n\nBoston Marathon 2024 what to expect from the runners and weather\n\nWith temperatures in the mid-40s and and no rain in sight, it's looking like it's going to be a beautiful race day for the 128th Boston Marathon this morning.\n\nAfter an inconsistent spring of sleet, rain and cold, today is expected to be mostly sunny according to the National Weather Service, with a near high of 67 degrees.\n\nIn the morning, when the race begins, the temperature is expected to be around 50 degrees, hitting that high temperature of 67 in the midafternoon.\n\nWhile this is great news for the people watching, those running in the marathon itself might not be as thrilled.\n\nHotter weather has been found to worsen runners’ performance. Marathon runners tend to favor cooler temperatures and cloudy skies, as those conditions minimize the risk of heat exhaustion.\n\nRunners will have to fight through that midafternoon temperature high if they want to finish well.\n\nBoston Marathon race start time\n\nHere are the start times for the different groups.\n\nMilitary March: 6 a.m.\n\nMen’s Wheelchair: 9:02 a.m.\n\nWomen’s Wheelchair: 9:05 a.m.\n\nHandcycles and Duos: 9:30 a.m.\n\nProfessional Men: 9:37 a.m.\n\nProfessional Women: 9:47 a.m.\n\nPara Athletics Division: 9:50 a.m.\n\nRest of Field Rolling Start Begins: 10 a.m.\n\nRest of Field Rolling Start Ends: 11:15 a.m.\n\nWhere is the Boston Marathon start line? Finish line?\n\nThis is the 100th anniversary of the Boston Marathon starting in Hopkinton. When the Marathon was founded in 1897, runners started from Metcalf’s Mill in Ashland, but the starting line was moved to Hopkinton in 1924.\n\nHopkinton start line: 'It all starts here' Boston Marathon, Hopkinton celebrate starting line milestone\n\nThe final stretch of the Marathon is on Boylston Street, where the runners Mile 26, knowing they're nearing the finish line.\n\nThe Boston Marathon finish line itself is at 655 Boylston St, Boston.\n\nHow long is the Boston Marathon?\n\nThe distance is 26.2 miles, as it is for all marathons. You can find the full course map on the marathon website.\n\nBut when you ask how long is the race, that brings up the question of time.\n\nAnd the answer to that question varies as widely as the legends surrounding its origin.\n\nThe fastest any human has ever completed the Boston Marathon is 2 hours, 3 minutes and 2 seconds. That mark was set by Geoffrey Mutai in 2011. The fastest female finisher was Firiya Sultanova-Zhdanova who finished in 2:27:58 in 2002.\n\nHow to get to the Boston Marathon via the MBTA Green Line\n\nThere are multiple spots people can safely watch from, depending on what time they get there and what part of the race they want to see, according to the Boston Marathon website.\n\nThe best and easiest places to observe the marathon are Newton and Brookline. Both are accessible via the MBTA; make sure to remember that Copley station is closed for Marathon Day.\n\nTo get to Newton on the MBTA, take the Green Line D line and get off at the Woodland stop, which is near the 17-mile mark on the south side of the racecourse. You’ll be able to see the 35-kilometer split from there and watch runners take on Heartbreak Hill.\n\nTo watch the race from Brookline, get on either the B, C, or D trains to the Cleveland Circle area. You’ll be able to watch the 38-kilometer split in the late morning.\n\nFrom there, you can either try to keep up with the runners and join them at the finish line at Boylston Street in Boston or enjoy the fine amenities the city has to offer.\n\nWatch the Boston Marathon Live: How to steam, watch on television\n\nIf you’re looking to watch on television, WCVB Channel 5 has the exclusive rights to locally broadcast the marathon.
