        "text": "The RW Takeaway: The Fate 5 is a lightweight and responsive neutral daily trainer that serves as a great entry point to the Newton forefoot lug design.\n\nNew open-weave mesh upper breathes well in hot weather\n\nForefoot lugs offer a propulsive feel and aid traction\n\nFavors an efficient midfoot strike, but easily accessible to all gaits\n\nPrice: $140\n\nWeight: 8.6 oz (M), 7.2 oz (W)\n\nType: Road\n\nMore Images\n\nTake a peek into your running crystal ball—are there big finish lines looming in your future? Of course, you already know that getting there doesn’t happen by fate. (You’ll need a solid training plan and some killer motivation, for starters.) But you can get some help from a shoe of the same name: the Newton Fate 5.\n\nThe Fate 5 is a lightweight and dependable pick that makes it the ideal gateway shoe into Newton’s line. It still sports the brand’s well-known forefoot lugs for swift, efficient toe-offs, but the edges are beveled for a slightly more relaxed ride than the Gravity. The Fate also eases up with a slightly higher 4.5mm offset, making it more accessible to low-drop newbs. But the onfoot sensation remains zippy and responsive—even with added cushioning through the heel and midfoot. Top it all off with the 5’s new breezy, open-weave mesh, and you’ve got a shoe that will have your next PB set in the stars.\n\n“The breathable upper was my favorite design feature,” one tester said. “And it wouldn’t be a Newton without the lug system on the bottom, which almost seems to propel you forward!”\n\nMidsole Theory\n\nThe apple doesn’t fall far from the tree when comparing the Fate 4 midsole to the 5. The shoe still has a P.O.P. 2 (short for Point Of Power) distinction—which describes the level of cushioning and responsiveness—that Newton uses to split its offerings into two platform categories. Both P.O.P. 1 and P.O.P. 2 use five rubber lugs that are fused to a hollow chamber with an elastic membrane in the forefoot, but the second offers lugs with tapered edges for a slightly toned-down experience. These are the lugs you’ll find on the Fate, which make it a great place to start if it’s your first time lacing up in Newtons.\n\nA full-length bed on Newtonian foam gives the Fate 5 ample cushioning, and the latest model actually weighs in a little lighter than the Gravity. That said, the ride on the Fate is soft enough according to our testers, but far from plush. It’s a shoe that likes to go fast, and feels springy rather than squishy.\n\nAll Grip, No Slip\n\nThe outsole on the men’s Fate 5 looks like the tread on a car tire, and this rugged aesthetic isn’t just for show. That same handful of energy-returning lugs doubles for traction in the forefoot, while additional rubber pads on the heel grip at every point of contact with the road. Our testers found the Newton sole secure on gravel and trails as well, with solid control and durability in wet conditions. “These shoes have held up well and I never slipped on the pavement on rainy days,” one tester said. “There is definitely more rubber on the sole compared to all the other running sneakers in my closet.”\n\nBuilt For Summer Heat\n\nA new open-weave mesh fleshes out the Fate 5’s upper. The construction breathes much better than the material used by its predecessor, and a stretchier panel in the forefoot is more accommodating for toes to flex and spread. (It’s also great for those of us who have feet that really tend to swell on hot runs, or often get a blow in the toe box when a pair is creeping up on that 500-mile mark.) Combined with the shoe’s sturdy lacing, our testers were already foreseeing comfortable feet when the temps soar this summer.\n\nWear Tester Feedback\n\nLisa G., tester since 2017\n\nArch: Flat | Gait: Neutral | Footstrike: Heel\n\n“I know people who live and die by Newtons and these did not disappoint! They are extremely comfortable and will be a great shoe for hot summer runs. Give yourself the opportunity to adjust and you will enjoy the feel of the lugs and how they help push you to your finish line!”\n\nTrevor V., tester since 2017\n\nArch: Medium | Gait: Neutral | Footstrike: Midfoot\n\n“I had never been willing to try a Newton running shoe because of nervousness about the elevated forefoot platform and the unique mechanics of the shoe. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the feel and experience both comfortable and ‘normal.’ The P.O.P. element on this Fate 5 was smooth and seamless. I like the lightweight and responsive ‘pop’ that [it] provides.”"
