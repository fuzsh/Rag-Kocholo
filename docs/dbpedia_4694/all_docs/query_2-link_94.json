It’s no wonder some of the most well-known professional athletes are choosing to wear and endorse Under Armour gear and clothing. With a growing number of sporting stars choosing their quality gear, Under Armour is set to become one of the leading sporting brands in the nation. Here is a list of which Professional Athletes Wear Under Armour:\n\nSteph Curry – Point Guard, Golden State Warriors.

The Under Amour ‘Curry’ series is one of Under Armour’s best selling shoes.\n\nTom Brady – Quarterback, New England. With 5 Super Bowl rings, 12 Pro Bowls, 2 league MVP’s Tom Brady will go down as one of the greatest football players in history.
