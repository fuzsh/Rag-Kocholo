Then the function $$g(x) = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^x f(t)\\ dt$$ should look like a sigmoidal smooth transition function, as it does in Desmos, but taking the integral again got stuck: $$h(x)=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^x g(t)\\ dt$$\n\nI am expecting something that looks like $$s(x) = \\ln(1+e^x)$$ or $$r(x) = \\dfrac{x}{1-e^{-2x}}$$\n\nand verify how much it deviates from them, but I have not able to do it yet."
