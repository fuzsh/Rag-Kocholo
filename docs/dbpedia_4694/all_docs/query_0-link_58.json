        "text": "Dear Izzy, Max, and Kate,\n\nMy first experience with Newton running shoes was with the “Motion”. It’s a shoe that I’ve come to love. It’s light. It’s fast! And I look a little like Superman when I wear them.\n\nI recently tried out another shoe from the Boulder, CO (love that place) based company. Most of my running shoe collection is made up of light weight, minimal shoes – best used for fast workouts and racing. So I wanted something sturdy and somewhat heavier to use for slower training days and long runs.\n\nMy friends at Backbone Media suggested I try the Terra Momentum. Not because it’s “slow”, but because it makes a great all around shoe for different training paces and terrain. I was skeptical because it’s listed as an “all terrain” shoe. I do all of my trail running in the fall and winter, so I wasn’t sure this shoe would suit my needs this summer. But trusting the experts, and being somewhat smitten with the shoe’s appearance, I decided to go with it. They ensured me that it would be great for road running and would transition nicely to trails when fall comes around.\n\nHere’s how Newton describes the Terra Momentum:\n\nThe Momentum is designed for all runner types looking for a versatile, everyday base-training shoe for roads, urban paths and technical mountain trails. Like all Newton Running shoes, the Momentum offers highly responsive cushioning and ground feel, with a more level platform and lighter weight.\n\nThe Momentum weighs in at 11.2 oz, so it’s not a “super light” shoe, but that is to be expected with trail ready shoes. For an all around shoe 11.2 qualifies as light. Because of Newton’s patented forefoot lugs and “trampoline effect” the shoe feels much lighter on your feet.\n\nBesides the shoes great looks the first thing I noticed is the softness of the uppers. It’s the softest upper in my extensive shoe collection and wraps around your foot as you pull the laces tight. Love this feature. For me, the softness here is what sets the Momentum apart from other shoes I own.\n\nMy most successful and comfortable running has come in shoes with minimal heel to toe drop lately. The Momentum scores there as well with 4.5 mm drop.\n\nMore details from Newton:\n\nUPPER\n\nHighly-breathable closed mesh keeps out debris\n\nNon-stretch upper and webbing provides lateral stability\n\nSlip-proof laces with heel-securing double eyelets\n\nLightweight flexible molded P.U. support frame\n\nReinforced toe cap\n\nReflective logo and heel tab\n\nGusseted tongue\n\nMIDSOLE\n\nTuned Action/ReactionTM technology in the midfoot and heel\n\nBiomechanical metatarsal sensor plate\n\nTuned firm high-rebound EVA\n\nMidfoot/rearfoot support chassis for added stability\n\nETC anti-friction, anti-bacterial sockliner\n\nAccommodates most orthotics\n\nAfter running in the Momentum for over a month now, both long and short, I can vouch for the shoe being a great road shoe – despite it’s label. The thing that makes the Momentum different from Newton’s signature “Sir Isaac” shoe is the somewhat “nobbier” sole.\n\nBesides the shoes support and ride there are a few other nice little details that make a difference: I enjoy the heel and tongue loops, both of which make putting your shoes on easier. The reflective heel, side, and toe cap accents are also a nice touch for early morning and evening runners.\n\nI like the Momentum so much that I brought them to the beach with me. Now, that’s saying something.\n\nI love you,\n\n– Daddy\n\nI was given this product for purposes of this review. However, I was under no obligation to provide a favorable review. My opinions are my own."
