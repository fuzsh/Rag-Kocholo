        "text": "A keen mind. Quick feet. A good eye. These are just a few of the traits that define NBA executive Milt Newton. Newton got his start in the world of basketball during his college years, playing for the University of Kansas from 1985 to 1989. He played for multiple teams and in multiple locations around the world before hanging up his jersey in the early 2000’s.\n\nBut, he wasn’t done with the world of basketball - not by a long shot.\n\nAfter stepping off the court, Newton decided to apply his business expertise to the world he’d come to love so much. He spent several years working as a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers and as the Assistant Director of USA Basketball. Since then, he’s joined the NBA Front Office, where he played a crucial role in launching the NBA Development League. Milt also had stops with the Wizards and Timberwolves.\n\nCurrently, he is the Assistant General Manager of the Milwaukee Bucks. A long-time friend, I reached out for his thoughts on the BlackBerry brand.\n\nDaley: Thanks for taking the time today Milt. Do you remember how we first met?\n\nNewton: I think when I was with the Timberwolves? We met at a game, if I’m not mistaken. With us sharing a Caribbean background, we really hit it off, and have kept in touch ever since.\n\nWe both love basketball, and we spend a lot of time talking about prospects and things like that. You mentioned you work for BlackBerry, and you’ve helped me stay up to date on the latest news, upcoming product releases, stuff like that ever since.\n\nDaley: Tell us a bit about yourself.\n\nNewton: I’ve been involved in pro basketball since 1993. I’ve always really loved the game. I played on the University of Kansas National Championship Team in 1988, coached by Larry Brown. I’ve also played professionally in Belgium, Australia, and the U.S. Continental Basketball Association.\n\nAside from basketball, I’ve loved sports my whole life.\n\nDaley: Tell us a bit more about your relationship with BlackBerry.\n\nNewton: Ever since 2000, all I’ve used is a BlackBerry Smartphone. I’ve had opportunities to choose other devices, but they never stuck with me. I always ended up giving them away and going right back to BlackBerry.\n\nDaley: What was it BlackBerry had that these other phones didn’t?\n\nNewton: It’s all in the keyboard. For some reason, other phones that I’ve tried, I always seem to mistype. I think I’m typing an 'H' but I’m typing a 'J' or whatever. With a BlackBerry, I know when I press the button, that’s what I’m getting. Just omitting and avoiding those mistakes, that was the selling point for me.\n\nI’ve honestly just gotten used to the phones. As other models came out, I still found myself getting new BlackBerry Smartphones. It makes my life easier where I don’t have to worry if I typed the wrong word or wrong letter.\n\nI don’t have to go back and omit or erase anything - I’m pretty picky about that.\n\nDaley: What BlackBerry are you using now?\n\nNewton: Right now, I’m talking on the KEYone, but I’ve got the KEY2 at home.\n\nDaley: Was Android a big adjustment for you?\n\nNewton: Not really. I think Android just gives you a few more bells and whistles, but I haven’t noticed that much. I know it has the capacity to do all these things, but I didn’t buy it for that.\n\nI like the security of BlackBerry Smartphones, and I’ve always liked them for exactly what they are - smartphones, not toys.\n\nI use my camera every now and then, but I like taking pictures with my real camera. I just like the feel of my KEYone. I liked my previous BlackBerry Smartphones a lot too, because of the form factor and how they fit into my hand.\n\nA lot of my friends make comments about how they didn’t know I still had a BlackBerry, and I just ask them when they’ve ever known me to have anything else.\n\nDaley: Walk us through a typical day - how does BlackBerry play in?\n\nNewton: I’m on my phone throughout my waking hours. It never really leaves my side. I’ll always be looking up something on the Internet, sending text or BBM messages or speaking on the phone with personnel, players, or colleagues.\n\nIf I’m not using my phone, it’s always in my back pocket, because when it rings I need to be able to pick it up right away - it’s something I use for both my job and my life outside my job as well.\n\nDaley: Any words for someone who might be thinking of picking up a BlackBerry Smartphone?\n\nNewton: They’re smartphones, not gimmick phones. The BlackBerry brand is about security and about getting things done, and that’s what I like about it.\n\nAbout the author: As a Channel Account Manager at BlackBerry Mobile I work with sales executives from Canada’s major carriers, directly with enterprise customers and with passionate brand advocates from the sports industry. My entrepreneurial spirit keeps me active in the real estate market as a landlord, investor and developer. I also spend time coaching basketball and mentoring youth.\n\n#NBA #basketball #BlackBerryMobile #KEY2 #AnIconReborn #TeamBlackBerry #Android #CedricTalksSports\n\nThis is a personal blog.
