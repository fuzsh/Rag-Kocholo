        "text": "A few months ago I was contacted by Newton Running regarding attending an event they were hosting in New York. I let them know that unfortunately I no longer lived in New York so I wouldn’t be able to attend, but if they ever had events in the Boston area to let me know!\n\nI also mentioned that Newton had attended our local run club a few weeks earlier and I had gotten a chance to run in a pair of their sneakers and I really loved them! (We have vendors that come to run club each week and we often get to test out products, it’s a great way to discover new things!)\n\nMuch to my surprise they asked if I’d be interested in receiving a pair of sneakers to test out and review – ummm, yes please!\n\nNewton offers several different categories of sneakers:\n\nSpeed & Mileage Trainers (P.O.P 1) – fast & responsive\n\nCore Trainers (P.O.P 2) – peppy & smooth\n\nGateway Trainers (P.O.P 3) – soft & lively\n\nAll Terrain\n\nI chose the Newton Kismet, which is a stability core trainer – good for “every day training and racing, an all around go-to shoe”.\n\nKismet details:\n\nweight – 8.2oz\n\nplatform – P.O.P 2\n\nheel to toe drop – 4.5mm\n\nextended medial bridge\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Newton, the first thing you’ll likely notice is their patented “lugs” on the bottom of the sneaker.\n\nThe lugs are the “secret” to Newton’s distinctive “P.O.P” sensation you’ll experience when running – it’s like adding a little spring to your step! (There’s a great animated graphic on the Newton Running “Inside the Ride” page that demonstrates exactly how this works!)\n\nThe lugs come in 3 different heights or P.O.P’s (point-of-power) that each provide their own unique feel or ride.\n\nThe design of the Newton sneaker with the lugs up front and a low heel to forefoot drop (4.5mm for the Kismet) helps to promotes a natural running stride.\n\nWhen I received my sneakers I immediately wore them to my track club workout that night and it was love at first run!\n\nI really did feel springy and speedy when I was running in them and they didn’t need any “break-in” time, they felt like they belonged on my feet as soon as I put them on.\n\nAfter a few great speedwork sessions and short runs in them I decided to use the Kismet’s for my last long run before my most recent half marathon and unfortunately I had a little bit of a different experience.\n\nI’m not sure if I was just having a bad day, but this was a tough run. After about mile 8 my feet started to really hurt and by the time I got to mile 12 I actually couldn’t wait to get my shoes off! I have yet to run a long distance in the Newton’s again, but I think it may have just been a combination of a not stellar round of training leading up to that point, and the Kismet’s maybe having a) a little less cushioning than I’m used to doing long distances in and b) a lower heel to toe drop than I’m used to running long distances in.\n\n(*I DO plan on building up some distance in these sneakers and giving them another shot on a long run though!)\n\nThat being said the Newton Kismet’s are still the sneaker I reach for when I’m headed out for a short 3-5 mile run or when I’m heading to a track workout, they just make me feel speedy!\n\nI also love supporting a company that’s active in the running community and believes in giving back and Newton does both!\n\nNewton is the first running company to be B-Corp certified (this means that they are recognized as a company that uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems)\n\nNewton has donated over 6,000 shoes to One World Running\n\nNewton employees volunteered over 1600 hours in 2014\n\nNewton diverted over 78% of waste from their distribution enter to recycling\n\nDuring Boston Marathon weekend, Newton also distributed sneakers at a Boston area Boys and Girls Club!\n\nIf you’re looking for a little something different in your running shoe I’d definitely encourage you to check out the Newton Running website and maybe stop by your local running store and try out a pair!\n\nDo you run in one brand/ style of sneaker\n\nor do you switch depending on the run/ workout?"
