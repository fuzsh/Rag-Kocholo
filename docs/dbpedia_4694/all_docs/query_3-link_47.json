        "text": "Thomas: I was sent the Kismet which is the sister shoe to the Newton Fate. Meaghan will be reviewing the Fate. The difference between the shoes is that the Kismet is Newton’s stability version of the Fate. I don’t need stability so I wasn’t sure how I would like the shoe. I reviewed the Motion III and liked that stability shoe from Newton. My understanding is that Newton makes the shoe wider in the throat to create the extra stability and does not use posting or stiffer materials to compensate for pronation. Let’s face it, if you are running the way Danny Abshire wants you to, you don’t really need extra stability.\n\nThe Good\n\nNewtons have style. I have always liked the way they use colors and shape to make a shoe that looks and feels fast. At first I wasn’t sure about the Kismet’s color scheme, but they really grew on me. They remind me of Star Wars, like they could have been designed for the movie. The woven upper is slick and has held up well on the almost 100 miles I have put on them. The shoes have 360º of reflectivity. Between that and the bright colors, nobody will miss you. The big feature in the new line of Newtons is the P.O.P levels. The Kismet and Fate are designated P.O.P. 2, a less aggressive feel to the lugs than P.O.P. 1 and more than P.O.P. 3. I like the P.O.P. 1 feel and thought I would miss something in the P.O.P. 2. I found the 2’s to be noticeable when I put them on, but quickly disappeared once I started running. When I concentrated on the lugs I could feel them and work on my form. I ran in the Distance III (P.O.P. 1) to see if I could notice a difference in the levels. It is a noticeable difference. The Distance lugs are firmer and more pronounced throughout the run. I did several runs in these shoes including 20+ milers and my feet always felt about as fresh as they can after that many miles. I also did some track work in the Kismet. At 9.35 oz. (size 10.5) they feel light enough for fast days too.\n\nThe Bad\n\nLive by the sword, die by the sword. Lugs are Newton’s sword. Some feel that Newton is giving up what made them special by watering down the lugs to different levels. I have been convinced by the models I have worn that Newton is making some top notch trainers; but there will be some dissenters.\n\nLike tall grass, anything that sticks out gets cut down. The lugs have some wear (see pic) but it isn’t enough to have an effect on the feel of the shoe. The price point on Newtons is also a point of contention. The Kismet, at $129, doesn’t seem too far out there as other shoe companies have raised their prices. It’s still $40-50 more than some good competitors.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nIt seems like I get shoes in waves, a few great followed by a few mediocre, and then some lemons. The Kismet fall into the the shoes I love to run in category. I look at the rack in the morning and I reach for them first. I have other shoes lined up for review but I will go with the Kismet for my long run today. As of now, the Kismet are my favorite new addition to the Newton line up. They feel lighter and less stiff than the Motion III, and have just the right amount of more shoe than the Distance III. This may be harrassey to some die hard Newton lovers out there, but I like the P.O.P. 2 ride as well. I am very curious to see if I would like the Fate over the Kismet.\n\nFrom Newton\n\nThe Newton recipe for success: one part determination and one part Kismet. Kismet? Destiny. This 5 lug P.O.P 2 Core Trainer is the everyday go-to shoe for a runner needing the extra bit of functional stability found in our broad and stable e.m.b platform. Responsive, comfortable and stable with a 4.5 mm drop – this shoe is the entry into our open-chamber Action/Reaction technology. It’s easy to put on and impossible to take off. It’s love at first stride. It’s Kismet.\n\nWeight • 9.7\n\nPlatform • P.O.P 2\n\nHeel-to-toe drop • 4.5 mm\n\nUpper\n\nSeamless engineered mesh upper • 360 degree reflectivity • Heel lace lock\n\nOutersole\n\n5-lug P.O.P 2 platform • Action/Reaction technology in the forefoot and heel • Biomechanical metatarsal sensor plate • Open ground surface EVA in mid-stance • Durable s.h.a.r.c (super high abrasion rubber compound) outsole composite in forefoot • e.m.b extended medial bridge for additional stability\n\nAdditional disclosure from Believe in the Run:"
