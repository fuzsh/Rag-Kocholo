SEATTLE -- The University of Washington Friday named Bob Bender of Illinois State as its new head coach.

Bender, 35, guided the Redbirds to a 60-57 record the past four years in his first head coaching stint.

His teams won two Missouri Valley Conference regular-season titles and earned a trip to the NCAA Tournament in 1990.

'Bob Bender is an impressive young coach who will bring enthusiasm and energy to the Husky men's basketball program,' Washington director of athletics Barbara Hedges said. 'He's coming to the university as one of the most highly regarded young coaches in America.'

Bender takes over for Lynn Nance, who resigned after this past season

The son of an Illinois high school coach, Bender was a reserve guard at Indiana during the 1975-76 season when Bob Knight's Hoosiers won the NCAA Championship. He transferred to Duke and played three seasons for the Blue Devils. Duke's trip to the 1978 NCAA Finals allowed Bender to become the first player in NCAA history to appear in the title game with two different teams.

Washington State's Kelvin Sampson and George Washington's Mike Jarvis also were candidates for the vacancy but withdrew their names from consideration this past week. Southern Methodist Coach John Schumate also was named as a candidate.

Illinois State athletic director Rick Greenspan said he would begin a national search to fill Redbirds' head coaching vacancy.

'Bob and I have stayed in contact regarding this opportunity over the last few days,' Greenspan said, 'and although disappointed to lose a great young coach, we're pleased that this presents new opportunities and challenges for Bob.'
