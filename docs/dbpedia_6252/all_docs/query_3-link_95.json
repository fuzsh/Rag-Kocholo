        "text": "Ewing, NJ…College of New Jersey inducted five former student-athletes and a former coach into the Alumni Athletic Hall of Fame on June 18. The list of honorees for the 2006 class include football quarterback Robert “Flip” Faherty (Ewing, NJ), All-America field hockey and women’s lacrosse player, Cathy Swezey (Formerly of Moorestown, NJ and now of Nashville, TN), former women’s swimming and women’s tennis coach Brenda Campbell (Formerly of Ewing, NJ and now of Kure Beach, NC), former football and track athlete, Tibbot Csik (Rancho Cucamonga, CA) and All-America wrestler, Scott Puzia (Randolph, NJ).\n\nAdditionally, The College will be recognizing two athletic teams for their outstanding accomplishments as “Teams of Distinction.” They are the 1981 field hockey team that won the NCAA’s first Division III women’s championship and the 1979 baseball team that earned the College’s first NCAA tournament appearance in the sport.\n\nThis year’s event will take place on Sunday, June 18 with the induction ceremony at 10:30 on campus in the Music Building Concert Hall and will be followed by a brunch in the main dining area of Eickhoff Hall at 11:30 a.m. The cost is $30 per person. For further information on the Hall of Fame or to RSVP for the Hall of Fame dinner, please call TCNJ’s Athletic Department at 1-609-771-2238.\n\nCathy Swezey ‘93, Lacrosse and Field Hockey\n\nCathy Swezey has parlayed a tremendously successful athletic career at then-Trenton State College into success on the sidelines as a collegiate coach. Swezey’s coaching career began at her alma mater, TSC, where she served as the graduate assistant coach for both the field hockey and lacrosse teams from 1994–96. During that time, the lacrosse team earned two NCAA Division III championship titles, and the field hockey team earned the title in 1995. While coaching under her mentor, Sharon Pfluger, Swezey earned her master’s degree in teaching with a health education specialization.\n\nThe three-time All-American had a rare two-sport career at the College, earning stardom in both field hockey and lacrosse. Swezey started for TSC’s national championship lacrosse teams in 1991, 1992, and 1994, and for the 1990 national runner-up squad. Swezey missed her 1993 season with a knee injury, but returned to the field the following year. In field hockey, she was selected as the team’s co-captain as a senior and earned a selection to the CFHCA All-America team. She helped the Lions appear in the NCAA championship game three times during her time on the field hockey team, twice winning the NCAA title in 1990 and 1991, as well as the runner-up title in 1992 and a semifinalist finish in 1993. In 1990 as a sophomore, she scored the game-winning goal in the NCAA Championship game—a 2-1 win over Bloomsburg—her first collegiate goal. Over the course of her field hockey career, she compiled 12 goals and 15 assists, while starting 49 of 61 games played in the backfield and anchoring the Lions’ defense. As a senior, she was named the NJAC’s Defensive Player of the Year in 1992 and earned NCAA All-Tournament honors as well as a spot in the North-South Senior All-Star game.\n\nAs a member of the Lions’ lacrosse team, she earned All-America honors in 1992 and 1994. Swezey was also named to the NCAA All-Tournament team in 1992 and 1994, and earned the Attack Player of the Year award from the South Jersey Lacrosse Club her senior season. She became a member of the United States lacrosse squad upon graduation in 1994–95. Over the course of her collegiate career, she racked up 135 goals and 43 assists, for 178 total points, which currently ranks 17th all-time in school history and, during her career, ranked fifth.\n\nNow in her ninth season at Vanderbilt University, Swezey has been building a tremendously successful women’s lacrosse program for the Division I Commodores. Vanderbilt’s most successful season came just two years ago, when Swezey led the team to the NCAA semifinals and their second American Lacrosse Conference title in three years.\n\nFor guiding her team to its highest ranking ever, No. 8, and its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament in 2002, Swezey earned Coach of the Year honors from the American Lacrosse Conference and InsideLacrosse.com. Swezey is married to Scooter Gross. The couple has one son, Jack.\n\nRobert “Flip” Faherty ‘83, Football\n\nRobert “Flip” Faherty certainly left his mark on the College’s football program. A two-year letterwinner in 1982 and 1983, Faherty led the team as the quarterback and guided the teams to a 9-1 and 8-2 record, respectively. The prolific passer helped rewrite most of the College’s football records during his time here, many of which still stand today. Not only did he receive acclaim for his play, but he helped elevate the level of the team as the 1982 squad captured the NJAC Championship. In 1982, Faherty broke six school passing records while helping the Lions also establish new team marks as well. On the campaign, the team put together a record nine straight wins and upheld the consecutive scoring streak, which spanned from 1980–84. Among the Lion football records bearing Faherty’s name are most passes attempted in a game (45), season (239), and career (467); most passes completed in game (22), season (118), and career (235); as well as passing yards in a season (1,931) and career (3,606). Faherty also surpassed marks for most touchdowns in a season (32) and career (48). In many cases, he broke his own records set in 1982 the following season with another stellar performance under center. Faherty still holds many of these records some 20 plus years after he wore the blue and gold uniform, including the record for most pass attempts in a game, season, and career touchdown passes.\n\nThe 1982 Lions broke the record for most team pass attempts (283), most passed completed in a season (144), while also surpassing the mark for most yards gained in a season through the air (2,104) and total team yards (3,602).\n\nAs a follow-up act to his Lion debut, Faherty led the nation statistically as he was first with 32 touchdown passes and finished second in pass efficiency (148.7). He also finished second in touchdown passing for all collegiate football players in all NCAA divisions, behind Steve Young of BYU and ahead of the players such as Bernie Kosar, Jeff Hostetler, Boomer Esiason, and Randall Cunningham. The Lions finished ranked 15th in Division III in scoring offense with a 27.9 ppg average, while ranking 17th in total offense, and 25th in passing offense (196.7 yards per game).\n\nFaherty has served as the commissioner of Babe Ruth League, Inc. since 1988. In 1994, he received TCNJ’s Football Alumni Citation and has been active as a member of the College’s Homecoming Committee as well as an avid supporter of the football program in his role as a member of the Gridiron Group. He also was named the recipient of the Wade Watkins TCNJ Football Alumni Award in 1997.\n\nHe remains active in the community and serves on the board of the Delaware Valley Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame, while also holding membership in other various youth organizations. A certified volunteer for the Angel’s Wing, Incorporated, which provides emergency care for the abused and neglected children at the St. Francis Medical Center, Faherty was also named to the Mercer 2000 commission by former TCNJ President Harold W. Eickhoff.\n\nScott Puzia ‘77, Wrestling\n\nA standout on the wrestling mat for the Lions, Scott Puzia left his mark on the program as a two-time All-American competing at 118 pounds. He garnered those honors in 1976 and 1977, finishing fourth at the NCAA Division III Championships as a junior and second as a senior, helping the Lions to a 15th-place team finish. In his senior year, Puzia also qualified for the NCAA Division I Championships, where he finished in the Top 16. Throughout his final two years, he was consistently ranked among the elite in his respective weight class in all three NCAA divisions.\n\nPuzia capped his career on the mat with a career mark of 110-20 and an impressive 47-7 record in dual meets. During his time as a Lion, Puzia captured three Metropolitan Conference championships as well as numerous individual titles during the regular season. That impressive list includes two championships at the C.W. Post Tournament as well being a Sunshine Open, East Stroudsburg Open, New Jersey Collegiate, Delaware Invitational, and Central Jersey champion. His title at the Sunshine Open in 1975 earned him the Outstanding Wrestler Award for the tournament.\n\nHis effort on the mat and in the classroom earned him several honors in his senior year, including the Varsity-T Award as the College’s best scholar-athlete. Puzia also was presented the “Senior Award” at the 1977 Metropolitan Championships and was The Signal Athlete of the Year. As a Dean’s List student, he graduated in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration.\n\nPuzia is currently the president of Pharmaceutical Direct, Inc. in Dover, NJ. He also remains active in the sport of wrestling: he has been a NJSIAA high school official for the past 17 years (including five as a chapter officer), has officiated on the college level, and coaches the Randolph Township Recreation program.\n\nBrenda Campbell, Coach—Women’s Swimming and Tennis\n\nBrenda Campbell came to TCNJ in 1969 and served in many roles before taking the reins of the women’s tennis and women’s swimming programs in 1970. During the course of her career at the College, she amassed a combined coaching record of 562-182-4.\n\nA 1965 graduate of Lenoir-Rhyne College, Campbell served as the head women’s swimming and diving coach at TCNJ for 31 years. After a successful career coaching both swimming and tennis, including an NCAA National Championship tennis team in 1986, Campbell devoted all of her energies to the swimming program in 1995. Campbell guided 18 different individuals to All-America status in 46 events.\n\nCampbell’s swimmers and divers have not only been recognized for their achievements in the pool, but also for their achievements in the classroom and their work within the community. The team was also recognized almost yearly by the National Swim Coaches’ Association for its high overall team grade point average. Nationally, the Lions had a Top 20 finish on four different occasions during Campbell’s career, while producing a 227-103-4 record in dual meet competition.\n\nAs the Lions’ swimming coach, Campbell also guided the team to five NJAC Championships, two ECAC Championships, six Metropolitan Conference Championships, and produced 65 NCAA Division III qualifiers, 53 All-Americans in 26 events, 17 NCAA Division III medal winners, and one NCAA Division III National Champion.\n\nIn addition to her accomplishments as the Lions’ swimming coach, Campbell served as head coach of the women’s tennis program for 26 seasons, where she compiled a career record of 335 wins and 79 losses. In addition, she helped the team go undefeated in NJAC play from 1982 until 1994 as they compiled an amazing 68-0 mark in league matches. She led her team to the 1986 NCAA Championship as the 1985–86 Lions became the first team in NCAA history from a Northeast college or university to win the NCAA Championship at any Division (I, II, or III). The Lions went 24-1 that year and defeated Occidental to capture the 1986 NCAA crown.\n\nShe guided 17 women’s tennis players to All-America honors, while two others received recognition with the Honda Award, Kathy Mueller in 1978 and Debbie Daniel in 1986. Mueller would become TCNJ’s first recipient of the Honda Award and went on to win the Broderick Cup as the Outstanding Collegiate Female Athlete in the nation that year.\n\nActive professionally, Campbell also served as a member of the Honda Selection Committee and was a member of the ASCA and the College Swim Coaches Association. In the fall of 2004, she joined the athletic hall of fame at her alma mater, Lenoir-Rhyne.\n\nTibbot Csik ‘54, Football and Track\n\nA winner of six varsity letters while at Trenton State College, Tibbot Csik won four of those as a member of the football team from 1950 to 1953. While on the gridiron, he was a “Little All-American” nominee in 1951 and the following year quarterbacked the program to its first undefeated season. Then in 1953, Csik was selected to serve as one of the team’s co-captains.\n\nHe was also a member of the track team in 1951 and 1952 prior to his graduation from Trenton State College in 1954.\n\nAfter graduation, Csik served in the military where he was a commissioned officer in the United States Marine Corps and served during the Korean War as a member of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\nOnce his tour of duty was over, Csik returned to New Jersey where he became the athletic director at Florence Township High School, where he also served as the football and baseball coach. He guided Florence to a pair of Burlington County Championships in addition to the South Jersey Group I Championship in 1958.\n\nCsik returned to the military in 1959, when he re-entered the Marine Corps. He served as a commanding officer at various posts during his tenure and during the Vietnam War was the recipient of Individual and Unit Citations and Meritorious Commendation. He retired from the military on June 1, 1978, as a colonel.\n\nCsik then became a naval science instructor and math teacher at Pasadena High School in California, eventually moving to nearby Occidental College to become the senior department assistant for facilities and equipment in the physical education and athletic department in 1980.\n\nTEAMS OF DISTINCTION\n\n1979 Baseball\n\nIt was a breakthrough season for the Lions on the diamond in 1979, as the team garnered the program’s first trip to the NCAA Division III Tournament while at the time setting a record for most wins in a season. TSC entered the NCAA Southeast Regional as the fifth seed, but advanced to the final round of the regional, capping its very successful season with a record of 27-17-1.\n\nIn addition to finishing second at regionals, the Lions also finished second in the New Jersey State Athletic Conference South Division as well as second in the conference tournament. The team also garnered national attention by being ranked among the Top 20 teams in Division III during the course of the year.\n\nWith the success of the team, numerous individual honors were bestowed upon the Lion players. Dan Franchetti led the charge as the second baseman was named an All-American First Team, New Jersey College Baseball Writers College Division Player of the Year, NJCBW College Division All-State First Team, NJSAC First Team, and All-District II Division III First Team. Franchetti topped the Lions in a host of offensive categories including batting average (.396), hits (65), triples (6), stolen bases (26) and was second in runs scored (40) and home runs (4).\n\nPitcher Drew Feinhals and outfielder Chuck Spinella also reeled in all-conference first-team honors, with third baseman Ron Scartocci being named to the second team. Feinhals led the team in wins with seven, while Spinella collected 45 hits and 28 runs batted in. Spinella also was named NJCBW College Division First Team honors, while Guy Chiarello was tabbed All-District II Division III as a first baseman.\n\nTwo other players who were vital components of the team’s banner season were pitchers Gene Coltelli and Paul Patsko. Each hurler collected six victories, tying them for second on the team.\n\nThe honors weren’t limited to the players as head coach Gary Hindley was named NJCBW College Division Coach of the Year after guiding the team to its best season in school history.\n\n1981 Field Hockey\n\nThe field hockey team in 1981 became not only the first women’s athletic team at the College to win an NCAA Division III Championship, but due to the timing of the tournament became the very first college to garner a women’s NCAA Division III Championship overall. The Lions went 20-0 that year and beat Franklin & Marshall College 2-0 in the title game which was held on the campus of Westfield State College.\n\nSharon Goldbrenner and Dina Ayres were the Lions’ co-captains of the team in the fall of 1981 and led a squad comprising five seniors that “made everything click,” said head coach Melissa Magee. During the year, the team posted 10 shutout wins and outscored their opponents by a 62-11 margin. Ayres, the Lions’ goalie, earned All-America honors for her play in net, while Repy Hattersley and Diane Smith also were cited as All-Americans. Donna Aromando tallied 26 goals for the Lions and was named to the NJAIAW All-Conference Team, as were Susan LaPierre, Debbie Schimpf, Goldbrenner, and Ayres.\n\nCoach Magee guided the team to a first-place finish in both the Trenton State Invitational and the Virginia Tech Invitational. In the Virginia Tech tournament, the Lions posted 2-1 wins over Virginia Tech, Clemson University, and Appalachian State College. By year’s end, the Lions had also captured the NJAIAW Conference Championship as well as the NCAA Division III Championship after a perfect campaign.\n\nAmong the other players on the team that season were Pam Bookman, Margaret Casey, Bonnie Donovan, Lori Jung, Carolyn McGowan, Liz McNamara, Nancy Murphy, Bridget Roun, as well as junior varsity performers Brenda Adams, Judy Bender, Sue Brinkerhoff, Chris Coach, Debbie DeVivo, Kate DiSciullo, Claudie Fulshaw, Tina Heinemann, Gail Kawczak, Betsy Kerlin, Barb Lansing, Mary Anne Lucidi, Andrea Newman, Lisa Palmisano, and Cheryl Tano. Magee’s assistant coaches that year were Beth Bozman and Kim Thorne, while Beth Keneelly served as the manager and Cindy Savino served as the scorekeeper.\n\nCriteria for Nomination to the Hall of Fame\n\nThe Hall of Fame honors those individuals whose athletic achievements have been extraordinary and whose support of the College has been significant as well.\n\nFOR ATHLETES\n\n• Nominee must be a graduate of the College.\n\n• Eligibility for admission begins the 11th year after the nominee’s graduation from the College.\n\n• Nominee must have demonstrated sustained commitment to the College since her or his graduation.\n\n• Nominee must have had significant impact in her or his sport (defined as being at least an all-conference performer or equivalent).\n\nFOR COACHES\n\n• Nominee must have been an outstanding coach at the College for five or more years.\n\n• Must be retired from college coaching duties for at least one year.\n\n• Coaching achievements must be officially recorded in the athletics office.\n\n• Coach/team(s) must have been cited at the state/regional level\n\n(example: conference championship).\n\n• NCAA regional coach of the year or beyond.\n\n• Nominee must have been an employee in good standing during tenure.\n\n• Nominee must have continued to be a citizen in good standing.\n\nfor consideration by the Veteran’s Committee\n\n• Nominee must have graduated from the College at least 30 years prior to the year in which he/she is being considered for induction.\n\n• Nominee must have been an outstanding athlete or coach at the College.\n\n• Nominee must have demonstrated sustained commitment to the College since her or his graduation.\n\n• Nominee must have continued to be a citizen in good standing.\n\nOTHER HALL OF FAME CANDIDATES\n\nIn extraordinary cases, by vote of the Hall of Fame Selection Committee, TCNJ community members and former athletes may be admitted to the Hall of Fame without satisfying the stated requirements.
