        "text": "February 13, 1956 — July 6, 2019\n\nRobert (Bob) E. Bender Jr. was born on Feb. 13, 1956 in Groom, Texas to Robert Bender Sr. and Shirley Joann Bender. He spent his childhood growing up in Sennfeld, Germany and throughout the United States. Bob attended Lampasas High School and graduated in 1974.\n\nBob joined the air force after he graduated where he was on the flight line as an air craft mechanic. After the air force, he began working for Brown and Root as an equipment operator and project foreman. He then moved on to be a superintendent for Price Construction. His love of machinery and attention to detail continuously moved him further and further up the chain of command where he became the Vice President of Bay Maintenance Company in the early 1990’s. Bob’s love of dirt work and highway construction eventually led to the opening of his own highway and utility construction company, MB Bender Co in 1999. From the time he began his career he was continuously recognized for his work, receiving many awards, his most proud coming from the Texas Department of Transportation.\n\nDuring his time running MB Bender Company, he was also heavily involved in his community serving on the Kingsland Water Board as well as the Llano School Board. He was even given the honor of presenting his youngest daughter Kourtni her high school diploma at her graduation.\n\nThrough the years, Bob left the highway construction field and moved into oil and gas where he returned to Price Construction to be a manager for the energy division. Bob had found a new love of pipeline construction and went on to earn his NACE I as well as a Pipeline Welder Inspectors certification. Bob later became the chief inspector for the BridgeTex pipeline spanning over 45 miles.\n\nBob was looked up to by many and was always known for his stories and jokes. He was an amazing husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend to many.\n\nBob is survived by his wife of 30 years, Mary Beth; father, Robert Bender Sr.; sons, Robert and Kelly Bender; daughter, Kourtni Ince and husband Justin; granddaughters, Ashley Bender, Jazzy Bender, and Maisyn Ince; as well as his sister, Shirley Willis and husband Jack; along with nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nBob is preceded in death by his mother, Shirley Joann Bender; daughter, Kristi Bender; as well as his beloved aunts, Nancy Thompson and Donna Cotter."
