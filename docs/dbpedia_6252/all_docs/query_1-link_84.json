        "text": "Former Atlanta Hawks coach Bob Weiss is returning to Atlanta as an assistant coach and consultant on coach Larry Drew's staff.\n\nWeiss was the Hawks' coach from 1990-93. He was also head coach with San Antonio (1986-88), the Los Angeles Clippers (1993-94) and Seattle (2005-06).\n\nThe Hawks on Tuesday also announced former Knicks assistant Kenny Atkinson has joined Drew's staff as assistant coach for player development.\n\nIn addition, former Hawks general manager Rick Sund has been named a senior adviser for basketball operations.\n\nWeiss and Atkinson will join assistants Lester Conner and Bob Bender, and player development instructor Nick Van Exel on the Hawks' bench.\n\nAtkinson was a Knicks assistant the last four years. He previously was Houston's director of player development.\n\nHall of Fame: Don Nelson never knew just how much he would love retirement. In the Maui plantation town of Paia, he is far from the pressures of the fast-paced NBA lifestyle in which he thrived to become the game's all-time winningest coach.\n\nThese days, he's Nellie, the entrepreneur. From his new shaved ice stand, to coffee plants and koa trees, to all his rental properties and a wedding venue in the works right off the beach, the 72-year-old Nelson is about as far removed from his old basketball life as he could be.\n\nExcept for the fact he is finally a Hall of Famer, to be enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on Sept. 7 in Springfield, Mass. After years being left off the list, Nelson was surprised it happened.\n\nObituary: Art Heyman, who was drafted by the New York Knicks in 1963 and played eight seasons in the NBA and ABA, has died at age 71.\n\nAt Duke, Heyman led the Blue Devils to a 69-14 record from 1960-63 and averaged 25 points and nearly 11 rebounds. He was the most outstanding player of the 1963 Final Four."
