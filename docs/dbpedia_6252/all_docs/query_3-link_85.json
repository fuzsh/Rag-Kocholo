        "text": "Jim Thomas joined Boise State as the head soccer coach in 2013. He has led Boise State to three of its most successful seasons in program history in 2017, 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe 2018 season saw Thomas guide the Broncos to their first Mountain West regular season title in program history and the No. 1 seed at the conference tournament, and in 2019 he coached Boise State to its first ever Mountain West Championship, winning the conference tournament in front of the home fans.\n\nThomas was named the 2018 Mountain West Coach of the Year, marking the first conference coach of the year honor for any Bronco head coach in program history. The 18 wins in 2019 set the program record for most wins in a regular season while the eight Mountain West wins (8-3 record) set the program record for conference regular season wins.\n\nThomas oversaw the unprecedented accomplishments of Raimee Sherle, who finished 2018 as the No. 1 goal scorer in NCAA Division I with 20 goals and rose to finish her career as the program's all-time leader in goals (61), points (138) and assists (16). The 2017 and 2018 Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year rightfully earned national acclaim as Sherle was twice named a United Soccer Coaches Second-Team All-America honoree (2018 and 2019), becoming the first All-America recipient in program history. Sherle and the Bronco offense was especially prolific in 2019, as the team scored 46 goals – the most in single-season school history.\n\nThomas took over the Bronco program Dec. 13, 2012, after spending five years as an assistant at Washington. He immediately found success in 2013, as the Broncos led the conference in goals with 33 in 23 games, along with goals-against-average (0.78). With their attacking style of play and solid defense, Boise State went undefeated against Pac-12 schools in 2013 for the first time in program history. The team made it all the way to the championship game at the conference tournament in Thomas’ first season, coming up just short of a bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Broncos returned to the conference tournament in 2014 after stringing together four-consecutive shutout victories to end the regular season, including an upset victory at San Diego State. The wins propelled the team to sixth place, clinching the final tournament berth on the final day of the regular season. Boise State and then-freshman goalkeeper Janelle Flores posted a shutout streak of 433:42, spanning the final six games of the year. The strong finish helped Thomas and the Broncos finish with a 9-9-3 record.\n\nBrooke Heidemann finished her career in 2015 as the third player in Mountain West history to make the all-league first team each of her four seasons. Heidemann also became the first Bronco to be named all-region, when she was honored by the NSCAA.\n\nThe 2016 season saw Thomas lead one of the best in-season turnarounds in the country. The Broncos went 5-3-3 in Mountain West play to make the conference tournament. The record-setting conference season came on the heels of a 1-7-1 nonconference mark, with all seven losses coming by one goal. Boise State posted five shutouts in Mountain West play, en route to a school-record eight league results. Sherle – a freshman at the time – led the team in every offensive category as she garnered Mountain West Newcomer of the Year and All-MW First Team honors. Flores became the first goalkeeper in Boise State history to be named first-team all-conference.\n\n2022 saw Thomas lead the Broncos to its most successful defensive season in program history. Boise State recorded nine-consecutive shutouts, the longest shutout streak in program history. The Bronco defense did not allow a goal for 927:06, which also set a program mark. Boise State shut out the opponent in eight of its 11 MW matches, allowing just 30 shots on goal during conference play (2.7 per). The eight shutouts by the Broncos tied San Jose State (2018) for the most in a single season in MW history. Despite missing out on the conference tournament, Boise State finished the season with a 8-5-7 record and six all-conference selections.\n\nThomas broke the record for most wins by a head coach in Bronco program history in the 2-1 victory over Nevada on Oct. 19, 2023. That marked his 112th win at Boise State.\n\nUnder Thomas, the Broncos have garnered 38 all-conference selections and 16 all-tournament honors.\n\nPrior to Boise State, Thomas helped Washington to a 50-28-11 record since 2008, turning the program around after the Huskies went 12-43-5 during the three years prior to his arrival. During his five seasons in Seattle, Washington made four NCAA Tournament appearances including a run to the Elite Eight in 2010. Thomas' duties with the program included the coordination of recruiting some of the nation's elite youth talent as well as leading on-field training sessions.\n\nThomas has seen success at various levels in the soccer arena, spending time as head coach at the community college, high school and club levels. Over the past decade, he has spent time with both the Crossfire Premier Soccer Club and the Northwest Nationals Premier Soccer Club, garnering four State Championships.\n\nPrior to joining the staff at Washington, Thomas headed the men's team at Edmonds (Wash.) Community College from 2005-07 and served as head coach of Seattle's Roosevelt High School boys' varsity team from 2000-05.\n\nThomas hails from Bangor, Wales and graduated from Glamorgan University where he was a member of the college team which advanced to the sweet 16 of the National Cup. He was a starting forward for three seasons, two of them as the team's top scorer. He lives in Boise with his children Kingsley and Windsor."
