        "text": "SoCalHoops College Basketball News\n\nCollege Coaching: A Summer Recap--\n\nWho's Where & What Happened--(Aug. 27, 2000)\n\nThree have been at least 46 major D-I coaching changes (among head coaches, that is) which is about 15% of the entirety of Division I. And taking into account some of the assistant coaching changes, and the hundreds of other moves, contract extensions, hirings and firings in all the divisions, (including D-II, D-III and NAIA, not to mention the JC level), there's a lot that happened this summer that we're even now just catching up on. We don't know about every single coaching change, but we've been able to track more than a few. We've also noted some significant passings, and the occasional hirings of assistants where we either know about it or where it's significant. And since we haven't posted individual articles for each of the changes as they've occurred , we thought it would be useful to write ust one gigantic summary, a sort of \"Everything you wanted to know\" type of deal, with every coaching change of note that we heard about since the end of the last college season. To our knowledge, these don't predate the end of the regular season in February, and most of the changes took place after the conclusion of the Final Four.\n\nWe may have missed some, including even some SoCal coaching changes, but we've tried not to overlook any. Here's what we know:\n\nAIR FORCE-- Reggie Minton resigned on March 13, and was replaced by Joe Scott, a former assistant at Princeton. Scott, 34, took over for Minton who was fired after the Falcons completed an 8-20 season. Minton, the third basketball coach since the Academy began playing basketball in 1957, was 150-295 in 16 seasons. In eight seasons as an assistant at Princeton, Scott worked under Hall of Famer Pete Carril and his successor, Bill Carmody. Princeton was 163-61 over that stretch. Minton was this season's co-Mountain West coach of the year.\n\nALABAMA--A memorial service in May for Robert \"Rah Rah\" Scott, an Alabama assistant men's coach, attracted friends, co-workers and former teammates and players to Coleman Coliseum. Scott, an assistant basketball coach at Alabama, died of stomach cancer in early May. He was 42. \"He was a friend, a co-worker and for the last couple of years he was a teacher to me because of everything that happened,\" Alabama head coach Mark Gottfried said. \"He cared as much about people as anybody I've ever been around. Scott was diagnosed with cancer in September 1999 but missed only two regular season games last season. He played on a state championship team at Birmingham's Parker High School. After his Alabama career, he was picked in the fourth round by Golden State in the 1980 NBA draft and played professionally overseas for six years.\n\nALBERTSON COLLEGE--Named Mark Owen men's basketball coach.\n\nAMERICAN UNIVERSITY-- Art Perry resigned in March, and was replaced by Jeff Jones, 39, who left Virginia under difficult circumstances two years ago. The Eagles haven't had a winning record since 1990-91, when they went 15-14. This season, they finished 11-18 under Art Perry. Jones guided Virginia to five NCAA Tournaments in eight seasons, including a surprise run to the final eight in 1995. But the program then went 41-47 over three years. Jones was forced to resign March 15, 1998, finishing with a 146-104 record and had not had a head coaching job since then.\n\nAPPALACHIAN STATE--Promoted Houston Fancher to replace Buzz Peterson as head coach.

Layer, a 41 year old assistant at Colorado State the last two seasons, was promoted to men's head basketball coach after coaching at Queens College in Charlotte, N.C., for nine years, leading his team to five winning seasons and two trips to the NCAA Division II Tournament while compiling a 168-87 record.

Donovan signed a five-year, $6 million deal which brings him even with football coach Steve Spurrier ($2 million per year) in the million-dollar category. The deal also brings him even with Kentucky coach Tubby Smith as the highest-paid basketball coach in the Southeastern Conference. Donovan's contract is among the richest for basketball coaches. Duke's Mike Krzyzewski earns about $1.6 million a year.\n\nFLORIDA INTERNATIONAL-- Donnie Marsh, an assistant basketball coach at Virginia Tech the past three years, took over as head coach at Florida International in early May.

During seven years at Ball State, McCallum took the Cardinals to the NCAA Tournament twice, including last season. Drexler had retired from an All-Star NBA career two years ago to take over at his alma mater. School officials hoped to return Houston to its basketball prominence of the early 1980s, when Drexler and the rest of the \"Phi Slama Jama\" teams went to the Final Four three straight years. Drexler's teams, however, went 10-17 and 9-22.\n\nHOWARD UNIVERSITY--Hired Frankie Allen as men's head basketball coach.

Gardner, elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984, died after a long illness. Best known for putting the \"run\" in \"Runnin' Utes,\" Gardner's teams employed a revolutionary fast-break style during an era when many teams still relied on set shots. Gardner's teams routinely scored in the 70s or higher, capitalizing on the talents of players like All-America Billy McGill, who led the nation in scoring in 1961-62 at 38.8 points a game.\n\nKENNESAW STATE-Named Tony Ingle men's basketball coach.\n\nKENTUCKY STATE-Named Winston Bennett men's basketball coach.\n\nKINGS POINT-Named Joseph Conefry men's assistant basketball coach.\n\nKUTZTOWN-Named Bernie Driscoll men's basketball coach.\n\nLA VERNE-- Gabe Duran, an assistant coach for the past two seasons, has been named head coach of the University of La Verne men's basketball team.

Miami then hired former Tulane coach Perry Clark as head basketball coach after Rick Pitino turned the school down. Pitino decided to stay with the Celtics.

He had a stroke on Oct. 28, 1999 and had been hospitalized off and on since. Musselman, fiery, intense and always bounding from his sideline seat, was a basketball vagabond, coaching at all levels of the game. He held 14 head coaching jobs over 35 years and had been an assistant with the Portland Trail Blazers since 1997. He became coach of the Timberwolves in 1989 and coached them two seasons. He also coached the Cleveland Cavaliers for two seasons and had a record of 233-84 as a college coach at Ashland, Minnesota and South Alabama.\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE-Named Phil Cunningham men's assistant basketball coach.\n\nMISSOURI-KANSAS CITY--Dean Demopoulos, a top assistant under John Chaney at national power Temple, was hired as the new head coach at Missouri-Kansas City Bob Sundvold, former UMKC head coach was unexpectedly fired earlier in June by the school.\n\nNEBRASKA--Danny Nee was replaced by Barry Collier as the new men's head coach on April 5.

The Huskers went 11-19 this season, matching the school's worst loss total. Nebraska has made the NCAA tournament six times but has never gotten past the first round. Nebraska's interest in Collier increased when Bill Self chose to remain with Tulsa (he later quit Tulsa to take the Illinois job). Collier coached Butler for 11 seasons, compiling a 196-132 record.

Nee was fired in March at Nebraska despite winning more games than any basketball coach in school history. The Colonials rarely draw more than 1,000 for home games, despite making five NCAA tournament appearances since 1983. However, the Colonials now have two well-known coaches in Nee and football coach Joe Walton, the former New York Jets coach. Robert Morris also began making recruiting inroads under Boone as rivals Pittsburgh and Duquesne stumbled to a succession of losing seasons.\n\nRUTGERS--Extended basketball coach Kevin Bannon's contract by three years through 2005-2006.\n\nSALISBURY STATE-Named Steve Holmes men's basketball coach.\n\nSAMFORD-Extended the contract of Jimmy Tillette, men's basketball coach, from 7-to-10 years, through the 2010 season.\n\nSIENA--Hired Louis Orr, 42, former Syracuse asssistant as men's head coach.

Zion Christian Academy.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA STATE--Signed Cy Alexander, men's basketball coach, to a contract extension through 2004.\n\nSOUTHEAST MISSOURI STATE--Like St. Bonaventure coach Jim Baron, SE Missouri State men's coach Gary Garner talked with the Colorado State folks, but decided to stay at Southeast Missouri State and not accept the basketball coaching job at Colorado State. Garner considered Colorado State, saying he was intrigued about coaching against Utah's Rick Majerus and other coaches in the Mountain West Conference.

They lost to Louisiana State in first-round NCAA Tournament action.\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA--Henry Bibby received a three-year extension that puts him under contract through the 2004-05 season.

Bibby's record at USC is 57-57, and his teams have had three winning records in his four seasons there. The Trojans were 9-9 in the Pac-10 and 16-14 overall last season. Bibby's 2000-2001 team returns all five starters -- Brian Scalabrine, Sam Clancy, David Bluthenthal, Jeff Trepagnier and Brandon Granville.\n\nSOUTHWEST TEXAS STATE-- Dennis Nutt was hired on April 10 to replace Mike Miller (geez, how many of them are there out there?) who resigned after six years on March 20 to become assistant head coach at Kansas State.

He also played for the Dallas Mavericks from 1986-88.\n\nST BONAVENTURE-- Head basketball coach Jim Baron was given permission to talk to Colorado State about the head job there after Ritchi McKay resigned to take the Oregon State job following the termination of Eddie Payne, but decided to stay at St. Bonaventure.\n\nSTEPHEN AUSTIN--Derek Allister resigned in February and was replaced by Danny Kaspar.\n\nST.

On March 31, Self told Tulsa that he had decided to accept \"an enhanced deal\" and withdraw from consideration for the Nebraska job, which he had been considering, thus paving the way for Nebraska to hire Bobby Collier. At the time, Self cited the community's support in deciding to stick with the Golden Hurricane, which finished with its first appearance in an NCAA tournament regional final. Self reportedly chose between a deal worth $800,000 to $1 million at Nebraska and a Tulsa compensation package enhanced by a fund-raising drive among corporate leaders, which was estimated to have increased his yearly compensation from $350,000 to $650,000. Evidently it wasn't enough and Self took the Illinois job rather than stay at Tulsa.\n\nTUSKEGEE-Named Oliver Jones men's basketball coach.\n\nUC-IRVINE-- Pat Douglass, who guided UC-Irvine's basketball team to a 14-14 record last season, received a contract extension through the 2003-04 season.
