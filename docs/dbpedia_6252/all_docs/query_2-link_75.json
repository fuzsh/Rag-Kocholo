        "text": "Robert “Bob” Bender passed away peacefully in Colorado on Thursday, September 6th, at the age of 82. Bob is survived by his five daughters: Alyssa, Ashanna, Jessica, Miranda, and Phoebe. Bob was born on “The Ides of March”: March 15th, 1936, in Chicago, Illinois, to Edith and Alex Bender. He was a Shakespearean scholar and spent the majority of his professional career teaching and mentoring students at the University of Missouri in Columbia. He held a lifelong love for cooking and baking (especially bread), opera, dogs, children, the outdoors, and travel. Anyone who knew or had the opportunity to speak with Bob knows that he was an excellent storyteller and seemed to always remember every detail. His daughters have chosen to hold a private gathering in the mountains of Colorado to celebrate his memory and life."
