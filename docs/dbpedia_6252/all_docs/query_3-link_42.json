        "text": "The winningest coach in Boise State men’s basketball history, Leon Rice has guided the Broncos to eight postseason appearances and 10, 20-win seasons in his 13 years at the helm.\n\nEntering the 2023-23 season, Rice owns a career record of 268-155, including a 141-88 mark in conference games. Rice ranks second in Mountain West history in career victories and career conference victories, trailing only former San Diego State coach Steve Fisher in both categories.\n\nRice’s efforts in the 2022-23 season culminated in a bid to the NCAA Tournament for the second straight season. It is only the second time Boise State has reached March Madness in back-to-back seasons, and the first since 1993-94. The Broncos went 24-10 (13-5 MW) during the season to finish second in the Mountain West, defeating three Power-5 teams (Washington State, Colorado, Texas A&M) in the process for the first time in program history.\n\nDespite the established track record, Rice and the Broncos raised the bar yet again during the 2021-22 campaign. Boise State set program bests for total wins (27), conference wins (15) and consecutive wins (14) on its way to winning the Mountain West regular-season title outright and capturing the Mountain West Tournament crown - both firsts for the program. Rice was named the Mountain West Coach of the Year for his efforts, his second time claiming the award.\n\nThe dream season culminated with a trip to the NCAA Tournament. Boise State earned the number eight seed in the West Region - the highest seed in program history and the first time the Broncos have been the better seed in a tournament game. The tournament appearance was Rice’s third with the Broncos, following the first two at-large bids in program history in 2013 and 2015.\n\nRice became Boise State’s all-time wins leader during the 2020-21 season, passing Bobby Dye with his 214th victory. Now with 10, 20-win seasons, Rice owns more than half of Boise State’s 20-win campaigns. He has also orchestrated seven of Boise State’s 18 all-time postseason tournament trips, including three of the school’s eight NCAA Tournament bids. He and Dye are the only Bronco coaches to make multiple trips to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nRice’s success transcends Boise State basketball history. His resume since taking over stacks up with some of the nation’s elite.\n\nDuring college basketball’s most recent decade (2010-11 through 2019-20), Boise State was one of 33 Division I schools nationwide to amass eight 20-win seasons and one of only 17 to do so with the same head coach leading the way:\n\nArizona (Sean Miller)\n\nBaylor (Scott Drew)\n\nBoise State (Leon Rice)\n\nCreighton (Greg McDermott)\n\nDuke (Mike Krzyzewski)\n\nFlorida State (Leonard Hamilton)\n\nGonzaga (Mark Few)\n\nIona (Tim Cluess)\n\nKansas (Bill Self)\n\nKentucky (John Calipari)\n\nMichigan State (Tom Izzo)\n\nNorth Carolina (Roy Williams)\n\nOregon (Dana Altman)\n\nSaint Mary’s (Randy Bennett)\n\nVillanova (Jay Wright)\n\nVirginia (Tony Bennett)\n\nWichita State (Gregg Marshall)\n\nBoise State joined the Mountain West Conference during Rice’s second season as head coach and has been a model of consistency for the conference ever since.\n\nBoise State has won at least 11 Mountain West games in eight of the last nine seasons. In the 11 years Boise State has been a member of the league, only the Broncos and San Diego State have eight seasons with at least 11 conference wins. Boise State has won at least 12 conference games in five of the last eight seasons, tied with the Aztecs for the most 12-win campaigns during that span of any Mountain West school.\n\nThe Broncos stood alone atop the conference in 2021-22, going 15-3 in league play. It is the most conference victories and best conference winning percentage in program history. The feat included a school-record seven conference road wins. Boise State has won 42 Mountain West road games since joining the league prior to the 2011-12 season, the second most in the Mountain West over that span.\n\nThe success carried over to the conference tournament. Boise State entered the championship as the top seed for the second time as a member of the Mountain West and went on to not only reach the title game for the first time, but hoisted the trophy at the end of the week with a 53-52 win over San Diego State - Boise State’s third win against the Aztecs this season.\n\nThe win also made the 2021-22 Broncos the fifth team in Mountain West history to win an outright regular-season championship and the tournament title in the same season.\n\nBoise State accomplished the feat without a single first-team all-conference performer. It is the first time in Mountain West history that a team has won the regular-season title outright without a player named to the all-conference first team.\n\nTwo Broncos were named to the Mountain West All-Tournament Team - Abu Kigab and Emmanuel Akot. Kigab collected Most Valuable Player honors.\n\nBoise State’s first Mountain West title came under Rice’s guidance in 2014-15. After starting conference play with three losses, the Broncos reeled off 14 of their next 15 to claim a share of the crown and the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament. Rice picked up his first conference coach of the year award.\n\nHis personal accolade was one of many postseason honors for Boise State that season, which also boasted MW Player of the Year Derrick Marks and MW Newcomer of the Year James Webb III. Marks became the first All-American in school history, making the Associated Press honorable mention team. Marks was also named first-team all-league and United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) All-District, while Webb added second-team all-league and All-Defensive Team honors.\n\nRice was also named USBWA District VIII Coach of the Year, the first Boise State head coach to earn the distinction. He added the NABC District 17 Coach of the Year honor as well.\n\nBoise State also cracked the top 25 in the Associated Press Poll for the first time in school history in 2014-15, checking in at No. 25 in the March 9, poll.\n\nThat team won 25 games, which was tied for the school record before this season, and was selected as an at-large team to the NCAA Tournament. The bid was Boise State’s second in three years.\n\nThe NCAA Tournament at-large selection in 2012-13 - the first in school history - was a product of 21 impressive wins. Included were a school-record 12 nonconference victories. The Broncos also posted two wins over ranked opponents on the road in 2012-13, more than Boise State had combined to win in school history (one). Boise State finished tied for fourth in the Mountain West - the top-rated conference in the country per the RPI.\n\nThe Broncos led the MW in scoring average (73.2) in 2012-13, and were also one of the top 3-point shooting teams in the country, ranking 11th-nationally (.391) from beyond the arc. Boise State was also 25th-nationally in free throw percentage (.747).\n\nUnder Rice, Boise State has appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) three times and the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) once. The Broncos have won four games across those four tournament appearances - more than half of Boise State’s seven all-time postseason victories.\n\nIn addition to the wins, Rice’s head coaching tenure has also been marked by player development. Among the highlights: the two highest NBA Draft picks in Boise State history (Chandler Hutchison and Justinian Jessup); the program’s first All-American (Derrick Marks); Boise State’s second all-time leading scorer (Anthony Drmic); the first Bronco to leave early for the NBA Draft (James Webb III); and a walk-on turned all-league performer and NBA G League standout (Derrick Alston, Jr.).\n\nThose names are all among the 24 Broncos to play under Rice and go on to have a professional career. The development can also be seen on the sidelines. Four Boise State assistants under Rice have left to become head coaches, including fellow 2022 NCAA Tournament participant Jeff Linder at Wyoming.\n\nRice became Boise State’s seventh head coach March 26, 2010, and wasted no time making his mark on the program. In 2010-11, Rice put together the finest campaign for a Boise State first-year men’s basketball head coach, one that culminated in an appearance in the Western Athletic Conference tournament championship game. After falling one game short of the NCAA Tournament, Boise State was selected to play in the CBI, and advanced all the way to the semifinals.\n\nThe Broncos went 22-13 (.629) in his debut season, making Rice the winningest first-year head coach in school history. The Broncos also reached the semifinals of the College Basketball Invitational and surpassed 20 wins for just the ninth time since becoming a four-year institution (1968-69).\n\nThe 22 victories were tied for the fifth-most in school history, and signified the fifth-largest turnaround all-time at Boise State.\n\nRice was one of 54 first-year head coaches nationally, only 14 of which reached the 20-win plateau. Five of the coaches to accomplish the feat at their respective institutions were in their first years as Division I head coaches, but of those five, only Rice inherited a team with a losing record.\n\nRice joined the Broncos after spending the previous 11 seasons at Gonzaga, where he had served as the associate head coach with the Bulldogs from 2007-10. In his final season with the Bulldogs, Rice helped lead Gonzaga to its 10th-consecutive West Coast Conference regular season title with a conference record of 12-2 while finishing 27-7 overall.\n\nAt Gonzaga, Rice worked under head coach Mark Few and played a major role in the Bulldogs’ NCAA Tournament appearances in each of his seasons in Spokane. Gonzaga earned Sweet 16 berths in 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2009; and reached the second round in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2010.\n\nRice helped lead the Bulldogs to five top-10 appearances in the final Associated Press Poll, including a No. 3 ranking in 2004. Gonzaga also finished fifth in 2006, sixth in 2002 and 10th in both 2005 and 2009.\n\nThe Bulldogs went 291-73 in Rice’s tenure on the Gonzaga staff, including a school-record 29-4 mark in both 2002 and 2006.\n\nRice joined the Bulldogs from Yakima Valley College, where he served two seasons as an assistant coach and one as co-head coach with the legendary Dean Nicholson. He then served as head coach for the 1998-99 campaign. YVC went from worst to first in the debut season of the Rice-Nicholson partnership, and in 1999 YVC went 31-2 en route to capturing its fourth-straight Northwest Athletic Association of Community Colleges (NWAACC) Eastern Region title. The 31 wins were a school record and came four seasons after Rice and Nicholson inherited a program which had gone 3-20 overall during the 1994-95 season. YVC went a perfect 12-0 in the NWAACC in 1999 and Rice earned his second-straight Eastern Region Coach of the Year honor.\n\nThe duo guided YVC to a 103-26 overall record and 40-8 league record in four seasons. Rice coached 18 student-athletes who went on to play basketball at four-year schools, including the Bulldogs’ Quentin Hall who was a 1999 Gonzaga senior. YVC had six players from the 1999 squad who joined four-year programs.\n\nRice received his bachelor’s in physical education from Washington State in 1986 and his master’s in athletic administration, management and program development from Oregon in 1991. After one year of high school coaching, he began his collegiate career as a graduate assistant coach at Oregon in 1989, and then served two seasons as a full-time assistant coach for the Ducks. He was the head assistant coach at Northern Colorado in Greeley for three seasons prior to going to YVC.\n\nRice and his wife, Robin, have three sons: Brock, Max and Kade.\n\nRice Coaching Timeline\n\n1987-88 Pasco High School (Wash.)
