        "text": "By David Williams of The Commercial Appeal\n\nThe Grizzlies announced Wednesday the hiring of Bob Bender as an assistant coach and Bob Thate as shooting coach. The moves complete new head coach David Fizdale's staff.\n\nBender was a scout last season for the Brooklyn Nets. Previously, he spent nine seasons (2004-13) as an assistant with the Atlanta Hawks, working alongside Fizdale for the first four seasons. He also has NBA assistant stints with the Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nBender began his coaching career as an assistant at Duke under Mike Krzyzewski (1983-89) and later served as head coach at Illinois State (1989-93) and Washington (1993-2002). He won conference coach of the year honors in both head coaching jobs.\n\nBender is the only person to play for two different schools in NCAA Championship games â€” as a freshman on Bob Knight's undefeated 1976 Indiana team and as a point guard for Duke in 1978. The Virginia native was drafted by the San Diego Clippers in the sixth round of the 1979 NBA draft but didn't play in the NBA.\n\nThate is a veteran NBA shooting coach, having spent four years in that role with the Los Angeles Clippers (2012-16), and before that three years with the Nets. He worked with such players as Blake Griffin, who shot 52.1 percent from the foul line during the 2011-12 season but has shot better than 72 percent the last two seasons."
