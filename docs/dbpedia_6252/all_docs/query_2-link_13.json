        "text": "Bob was born July 9, 1939, in Warren, to the late John and Ida Bender.\n\nHe attended Warren G. Harding High School and left to join the Army Reserve.\n\nUpon returning, Bob married Elaine Crum, on Feb. 4, 1961. Bob became a father that following year, when his daughter, Kirsten, was born. A few years later, his son, Robert Jr. “Rob,” was born. Shortly after, they built their family home in Champion, where they lived for many years.\n\nBob enjoyed working in retail and met many people during his career. Bob would always get recognized when out and about from working at Turney’s, Handyman and DIY. There was almost nothing that Bob enjoyed more than creating, rebuilding and repairing anything that he could find or that others found for him. Later, he and his wife moved to Howland, where Bob continued to tinker outside and in his shed. He enjoyed just sitting on his porch, listening to country music and waving to passersby.\n\nBob leaves to cherish his memory, his wife, Elaine; children, Kirsten Harford (Ray Garretson) and Robert Jr. (Melissa) Bender; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and two great-great-grandchildren.\n\nBesides his parents, Bob was preceded in death by his brother, Jack.\n\n“I am ready to meet my Maker. Whether my Maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is another matter.” — Winston Churchill\n\nAt Bob’s request, there will be no memorial services held.\n\nCremation arrangements have been entrusted to the Peter Rossi & Son Memorial Chapel and Sinchak & Sons Funeral Home.\n\nRob and Melissa would like to say a special thank you to Patriot Homecare.\n\nFamily and friends may visit www.peterrossiand\n\nsonfh.com, to view this obituary, sign the guestbook and send condolences to the Bender family.\n\n(special notice)"
