        "text": "2/1/2023 4:10:00 PM\n\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (February 1, 2023) - St. Thomas University (STU) Football welcomed its newest members to the Bobcat Family on the Wednesday morning as thousands of student-athletes across the country put ink to paper to further their academic and athletic careers. The Bobcats had recruits commit from all over the tri-county of South Florida staying true to the roots while also adding parts from Tampa, St. Petersburg, Bradenton, and Orlando area.\n\nThis is the fifth recruiting class in program history since its launch in Fall 2018. The program celebrated its first senior class bearing farewell to \"Bobcat1\" who built this program from the ground up. The class of 2023 will flip the page to the next generation of Bobcats.\n\n\"Today we added a bunch of talented guys that are a great fit for our program and University, that are ready to compete. The competition that we can create within our program will help us work towards our championship goals,\" stated Head Coach Bill Rychel.\n\nSt. Thomas had another successful season in 2022 going 9-2 and achieving the highest ranking in program history at 15th. In another incredible year STU only fell short twice in late battles to Division I Butler and NAIA National runner-up, Keiser. The Bobcats have had three of four winning seasons, going 18-4 in the last two, while garnering their first AP All-Americans in Rontavious Farmer, Jayce Collins, Sidney Porter and Nicholas Engler.\n\nMeet the 2023 Class\n\nName: CONNOR TRIM\n\nPosition: LB/RB\n\nHigh School: CHARLOTTE HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: CORY MENTZER\n\nSenior Stats: 98 TACKLES, 8 TFL'S, 3 FF, 2 FR, 1.5 SACKS, 6 QB HURRIES\n\nParent's Name: KELLY JONES, GARY TRIM\n\nHometown: PUNTA GORDA, FL\n\nIntended Major: SPORTS MEDICINE\n\nName: KWALI PETERSON\n\nPosition: WR\n\nHigh School: AMERICAN SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: DEMETRIUS JACKSON\n\nSenior Stats: 500 YARDS, 15 RECEPTIONS, 2 TOUCHDOWNS, 1 INTERCEPTION, 1 FF, 10 TACKLES\n\nHometown: CAROL CITY\n\nIntended Major: BUSINESS MANAGEMENT\n\nName: KAMERON SCOTT\n\nPosition: DB\n\nHigh School: SUNCOAST HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: TIMOTHEUS GRANGE\n\nSenior Stats: 900 AP, 35 TACKLES, 3 INTS, 8 PBU'S\n\nParent's Name: YUKIA PARKER\n\nHometown: WEST PALM BEACH, FL\n\nIntended Major: CRIMINAL JUSTICE\n\nName: WALTER PARRISH\n\nPosition: WR\n\nHigh School: MONARCH HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: CALVIN DAVIS\n\nSenior Stats: 25 CATCHES, 400 YARDS, 7 TD, 4 EXTRA POINTS\n\nParent's Name: SHADRANIQUA RAWLS, WATER PARRISH\n\nHometown: POMPANO BEACH, FL\n\nIntended Major: SPORTS\n\nName: ISAIAH FITZPATRICK\n\nPosition: DB\n\nHigh School: WIREGRASS RANCH\n\nHead Coach: MARK KANTOR\n\nSenior Stats: 3 INTS, 52 TACKLES\n\nParent's Names: TIFFANY RIVERS\n\nHometown: TAMPA, FL\n\nIntended Major: SPORTS MANAGEMENT\n\nName: JOSHUA GACHELIN\n\nPosition: CB\n\nHigh School: SANTALCES HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: HECTOR CLAVIJO\n\nSenior Stats: 13 PBU, 1 FF, 1 FUMBLE RECOVERY, 16.5 TACKLES\n\nParent's Name: MARIE GACHELIN, WILLEM GACHELIN\n\nHometown: MIAMI, FL\n\nIntended Major: CRIMINAL JUSTICE\n\nName: CONNOR KISIAH\n\nPosition: OLB, SS\n\nHigh School: BRADENRIVER HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: CURT BRADLEY\n\nSenior Stats: 55 TACKLES, 2 PBU, 5 TFL, 1 FF\n\nParent's Name: CHRISTINA DEENEY, ERIC DEENEY\n\nHometown: BRADENTON, FL\n\nIntended Major: SPORTS MANAGEMENT / BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION\n\nName: TYLER HUNT\n\nPosition: OL/DL\n\nHigh School: WESTERN HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: ADAM RATKEVICH\n\nSenior Stats: 22 PANCAKES\n\nParent's Name: TOSCA BAIN, CARLTON ENGRANAM\n\nHometown: HOLLYWOOD, FL\n\nIntended Major: SPORTS MANAGEMENT\n\nName: KODEE SOTO\n\nPosition: OL\n\nHigh School: HOLLYWOOD HILLS HIGH SCHOOL\n\nHead Coach: BRANDON GRAHAM\n\nSenior Stats: BCAA ALLSTAR\n\nParent's Name: ANGEL SOTO\n\nHometown: HOLLYWOOD, FL\n\nIntended Major: CRIMINAL JUSTICE\n\nName: ALEX CAMARCA\n\nPosition: TE / LB\n\nHigh School: CANTERBURY SCHOOL FT.
