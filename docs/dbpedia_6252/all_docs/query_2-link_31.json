He attended Philadelphia public schools, graduating from the magnet Central High School and received his bachelors in economics from Temple University in 1960. After basic training from his enlistment in the Army reserves, Bob went to Washington DC to work for Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), then moved to Newark, New Jersey to become state ADA director. In Newark, he joined the Congress Of Racial Equality and met Patty Ganley. They were married in 1963, after what Bob describes as \"a picket line romance\" complete with organizing buses to the March on Washington. In 1964, the couple moved to Plainfield while both were in graduate school at Rutgers and Patty directed the Greater Plainfield Senior Citizens Center. Bob completed his coursework in the graduate program, but left school to focus on anti-war and civil rights activism. Bob enjoyed singing. He was a founder member of the Solidarity Singers of the Industrial Union Council, providing \"street heat\" for labor and social justice pickets and rallies. He was a member of the Clearwater Walkabout Chorus, focused on environmentalism, with Pete Seeger. In the living room with friends and family, he tinkered on the piano. In 1972 Bob and Patty helped found a progressive, community school-Children of the Rainbow-where they would send their children for several years. Professionally, Bob worked in anti-poverty non-profit community organizations including the New Jersey Puerto Rican Congress, the Spanish Community Organization of Plainfield and Model Cities. His last 14 years of work were as Executive Director of Accountants for the Public Interest New Jersey, providing non-profit accounting services to non-profit organizations and needy individuals. He had been an active member of many New Jersey groups including New Jersey Peace Action, the Ethical Culture Society of Maplewood, and the New Democrats of Plainfield. He served as the Democratic Third Ward leader in Plainfield. After moving to Florida in 2005, Bob organized the labor outreach committee of Occupy Fort Lauderdale, then became active with the Broward Black Lives Matter Alliance, most recently working to repeal Florida's racist stand your ground legislation. He participated in the Unitarian Universalists Congregation of Fort Lauderdale and sang in the choir. Bob started an email list serve for years with events for progressives in South Florida, before being blacklisted from gmail for repeated violations of the spam policy.Google was not the only entity that found fault with Bob's activities. The feds were also involved. He was arrested in Los Alamos, New Mexico protesting against nuclear weapons (with Patty and actor Martin Sheen) in the 1990s and in Georgia (again with troublemaker Patty and comrade Ed Lewinson) calling for closure of the Fort Benning \"school of assassins.\" Bob enjoyed swimming and water aerobics at Century Village. He and Patty traveled to Cuba and Nicaragua, China, London and Alaska. They visited with Patty's relatives in Canada. For the past several decades, Bob and Patty spent time during the summer at World Fellowship in New Hampshire. He is survived by his wife Patty Ganley Bender, sister Annette Bender, sons Nat and Daniel, daughter-in-law Gita DasBender, grandsons Deven and Reyen, nephew Matthew Schrot, niece Rebecca Schrot and grandnephew Ryan.\n\nReturn to the Table of Contents\n\nHistorical Information\n\nThis collection documents several local organizations in Plainfield, NJ with which Robert Bender was affiliated either as a member, an employee or a consultant.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a non-profit organization that focuses on legislative lobbying. Its stated mission is “to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" The ACLU has local affiliates and chapters, and it is the Union County Chapter with which Bob Bender was affiliated.\n\nThe 3rd Ward Democratic Committee is the local county branch of the NJ State Democratic Committee. It is composed of democratic council members, committee members, and ward/district representatives.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination. Founded in 1909, the NAACP is the nation's oldest, largest and most widely recognized grassroots–based civil rights organization.\n\nThe Plainfield Block Association, specifically the West 7th / Hobart / Monroe Block Association, is a neighborhood association in which a group of local home owners advocate for or organize activities for this specific neighborhood. Two important concerns during the time of these papers were a local drug dealing operation and a house being used as a bordello. Members would meet regularly at each other’s homes to discuss block issues. Often, members of law enforcement would attend the meetings and share knowledge about investigations or safety measures.\n\nNJ SANE / Peace Action were founded in 1957 as SANE (Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy). It is currently the nation’s largest peace organization. New Jersey Peace Action (NJPA), based in Bloomfield, was a founding chapter and has always been among the nation’s most active. Several local groups throughout northern New Jersey are affiliated with NJPA. Today, there are more than 35 Peace Action state affiliates across America. Peace Action has a national office which lobbies for legislation in Washington, DC.\n\nAmericans for Democratic Action is an independent liberal lobbying organization. It was founded in 1947 by Eleanor Roosevelt, economist John Kenneth Galbraith, and former Senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey.\n\nThe Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1942 as the Committee of Racial Equality by an interracial group of students in Chicago, many of whom were members of the Chicago branch of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), a pacifist organization seeking to change racist attitudes. The founders of CORE were deeply influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's teachings of nonviolent resistance. The National Headquarters is located in New York City.\n\nThe Education Law Center is a non-profit agency founded in 1973 by Rutgers law professor, Paul Tractenberg. It advocates on behalf of public school children for access to an equal and adequate education under state and federal laws. ELC's work is based on a core value: if given the opportunity, all children can achieve high academic standards to prepare them for citizenship and to compete in the economy.\n\nAmeriCorps VISTA is the national service program designed specifically to fight poverty. Founded as Volunteers in Service to America in 1965 and incorporated into the AmeriCorps network of programs in 1993, VISTA has been on the front lines in the fight against poverty in America for more than 40 years.\n\nThe Plainfield Area Draft Information & Counseling Center was formed to assist young men in making a decision about the draft for the war in Vietnam.
