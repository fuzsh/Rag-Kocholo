        "text": "This is a zoned, neighborhood school that also offers a separate gifted & talented (G&T) program. To see if your address is zoned for this school use our Elementary School Guided Search. For more information about how zones work, visit our New to NYC page and see the \"Zoned schools and other options\" section.\n\nWhy might this school be a good fit for you? If it's your zoned school, it's close to home. If you can walk to it, that means an easier commute. It's also more convenient to arrange playdates and to get involved with the school. You can share pick-up and drop-off duties with other families. Most of all, you are guaranteed to get in except in rare instances of overcrowding.\n\nEven if this is your zoned school, you are not guaranteed a spot in the G&T class. You will need to apply to that separately. Read our Gifted and Talented page for more details.\n\nWondering \"What to Look For\" in your school selection process? Check our suggestions here.\n\nIf you are a parent or staff member at this school, please tell us more about it in the Comments Section below.\n\nRead more"
