        "text": "News Releases\n\nPresident Somerville Highlights College Successes, Presents Top Teaching Award\n\nPosted on August 12th, 2024\n\n2024 Owens Community College State of the College Address\n\nDr. Dione D. Somerville began her fourth academic year as president on Monday, August 12 by sharing highlights of the Owens Community College strategic plan for faculty, staff and community guests, including Ohio Association of Community Colleges president and CEO Avi Zaffini.\n\nShe also recognized this year’s Presidential Teaching Award recipient, professor of English Cory Hoover, who leads the innovative Open Educational Resources (OER) program which has helped save students more than $2 million the past three academic years. She began teaching at Owens in Fall Semester 2000. A recipient of the TRIO Champion Award (2021), Hoover has been active at Owens, including helping launch the Center for Teaching and Innovation, developing numerous presentations, workshops and events and serving as a lead Honors Program advisor (2012-2021).\n\nThe address was held twice, at the Findlay-area Campus in the morning and again on the Toledo-area Campus in hybrid format in the afternoon.\n\nSince taking over the Owens presidency in June 2021, Somerville has prioritized engaging community leaders. More than three dozen community leaders attended the two presentations.\n\nZaffini began his tenure leading the state’s 23 community colleges in mid-July. Speaking briefly at both presentations, he said Ohio community colleges continue to adapt and collaborate in varied partnerships to meet Ohio’s workforce needs.\n\nSomerville focused her Owens address on the strategic plan adopted in 2023.\n\n“Last year, in the first year of our plan, we worked to put a framework in place that would enable our success moving forward,” Somerville said. “We are kicking off our second year and looking forward to continued momentum.”\n\nShe utilized the plan’s six objectives to showcase what the academic year will feature, including:\n\nBuilding a community of belonging\n\nThe year-long, college-wide Big Read program features author Sara Novic’s book, “True Biz”\n\nMen’s soccer returns to Owens Express sports, led by former Express player and Owens alumni Nate Baer\n\nThe Center for Campus and Community Connections continues to be a model for serving students’ basic needs, at institutions in Ohio and beyond\n\nExpanding partnerships\n\nOwens is positioned to provide relevant education and training as the only community college partner in the Northwest Ohio Innovation Consortium’s new $31.3 million Glass Centre of Excellence project\n\nThe Water Workforce Coalition, a collaborative effort with TMACOG and the City of Toledo, continues with a second cohort of students this semester\n\nJill of All Trades returns in October during National Manufacturing Month with a goal of tripling the exposure to the trades for young people in the community\n\nDeveloping an agile framework\n\nThe president applauded the faculty’s engagement to an initial assessment workshop created as a follow up to the Higher Learning Commission’s mid-cycle review site visit last October\n\nThe first cohort of the new cardiac sonography associate degree is full in anticipation of meeting local labor demands\n\nTrellis Strategies is studying the transportation challenges of college students as a follow up to the City of Toledo feasibility study\n\nIn Findlay and throughout Hancock County, Trellis Strategies is beginning a study focused on enrollment patterns and future enrollment opportunities for the Findlay-area Campus\n\nDeepening employee engagement\n\nThe president’s leadership team welcomed new Human Resources vice president, Dr. Leslie Erwin over the summer. She will lead employee engagement opportunities.\n\nLed by the Owens Foundation and a committee of alumni, the College’s inaugural Alumni Hall of Fame class was announced last spring.\n\nEnsuring a sustainable organization\n\nThe president outlined the fiscal year 2025 budget and noted a few additional funding resources supplementing state capital funds, including the state’s community investment funding and grants\n\nPhase 1 of the $31.3 million Healthcare Education Center will open for Fall Semester. After Phase 2 is completed next spring, a grand opening will be staged in March 2025.\n\nTelling our story\n\nMore than a half-million people have attended Owens for credit since the College opened in 1965, according to college research\n\nSince the 2013-14 school year, 37 percent of Owens students have transferred to and graduated from a four-year college or university\n\nThe College’s 60th anniversary will be celebrated during the 2025-26 academic year\n\nOwens Culinary Arts Program Earns Top Review, Reaccredited for 7 Years\n\nPosted on August 9th, 2024\n\nThe Owens Community College Culinary Arts Program has received a seven-year Accreditation with an Exemplary identifier from the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation Accrediting Commission.\n\nThe Culinary Arts Program has an associate degree plus two short-term certificates, including one in Baking and Pastry.\n\nThe Exemplary identifier symbolizes the highest education standards recognized by the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation Accrediting Commission. Owens is one of eight accredited Culinary Arts Programs in Ohio, and one of only three to receive the Exemplary identifier. This program is also the only accredited Culinary Arts Program within a 75-mile radius in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan.\n\nThe Culinary Arts Program is led by Robert Wagner, program director. Chef Amy Morford is an assistant professor.\n\n“We are grateful to the American Culinary Federation Education Foundation accrediting commission for affirming the work our dedicated faculty and staff are doing preparing students to succeed as professionals,” said Denise Smith, vice president of Academic Affairs and Provost. “I want to especially congratulate Bob, Amy, Steve Williams and all the Culinary Arts faculty and staff for their tireless work on the accreditation renewal.”\n\nSmith also credited Nathan Lute, the culinary operations and labs manager, for his work during the Accreditation tour.\n\nAccording to Wagner, Chef Amy creates an engaging and challenging environment in the classroom, replicating industry scenarios. She challenges her students’ skills to work at a fast pace while multitasking, both routine conditions in culinary work.\n\nStudents are assigned up to three different baked items and at least one accompaniment on most days. Chef Amy helps with troubleshooting, correcting recipes and improving time management and critical thinking.\n\n“Chef Amy maintains a student-centric approach to teaching,” Wagner said. “She’s a vital part to the success of the Food Nutrition & Hospitality Department as a whole.\n\n“In the beginning, these high standards seem daunting; however, students appreciate the level of difficulty that motivated their learning and retention of the techniques presented,” he said.\n\nStudents in the Culinary Arts program complete management, nutrition and menu design courses and fundamental, intermediate and advanced culinary skills. Students receive hands-on experience during the co-operative work experience and the student-run restaurant, the Terrace View Cafe.\n\nUpon graduation, students are eligible to receive the Certified Culinarian credential from the American Culinary Federation. Graduates find job opportunities as Chefs and Sous Chefs, Supervisors of Food Preparation Workers, Food Service Managers, Chefs in Healthcare Facilities and as Private Chefs.\n\nOutside of the classroom, Chef Amy is the Program Coordinator with an open-door policy for her students. She also reestablished the Culinary Arts Association student group.\n\n“Chef Amy’s commitment to Owens and our department, and most importantly our students reflect our dedication to provide students with the highest levels of training and preparation, allowing them to be successful professionals in all areas of the food service and hospitality industry,” Wagner said.\n\nFor more information about the Culinary Arts program and degrees, go to owens.edu/business.\n\nOwens Expands Partnership With Goodwill Industries of Northwest Ohio to Better Serve Workforce Needs\n\nPosted on August 6th, 2024\n\nOwens Community College and Goodwill Industries of Northwest Ohio are partnering to provide enhanced training options for people seeking to improve their workforce training opportunities.\n\nThrough a new customized website, individuals working with Goodwill will have access to learning experiences at Owens that connect directly to job success. The training courses are possible thanks to both organizations’ premium partner status with ed2go, a national network of online courses taught by experts from a variety of fields.\n\nExpert navigators at Goodwill will work directly with community members to find learning experiences tailored to their individual goals. Courses range from employability through customer service, conversational Spanish, business writing and leadership skills, to specific occupational preparation like interior designer, sign language interpreter and maintenance technician. More new courses are added regularly.\n\nAll courses are available entirely online, self-paced and available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week to meet the needs of busy adults juggling family and job responsibilities. As Goodwill navigators and individuals arrive at specific educational goals, Owens will enroll them and support their journey to completion.\n\n“Owens Community College is excited to work with Goodwill Industries of Northwest Ohio and expand access to education that benefits the local workforce and area employers,” said Charlene Page, executive director of Workforce and Economic Development at Owens. “The need for a highly-skilled workforce is clear to everyone. We are always looking to improve higher education access for adult learners and help them acquire the skills they need.”\n\nOwens and Goodwill have a history of collaborating with a focus on workforce development.\n\n“The opportunity to lift up members of our community by working closely with Owens is a natural fit for Goodwill’s Job Connection Centers, where we believe in the power of work,” said David Takats, chief mission officer at Goodwill Industries of Northwest Ohio. “Working helps eliminate barriers and provides opportunities to improve peoples’ lives.”\n\nFor more information about the ed2go classes, visit www.owens.edu/goodwill.\n\nContact:\n\nOwens Community College\n\nAndy Woodard\n\nStrategic Marketing and Communications\n\n(567) 661-7149\n\nandrew_woodard@owens.edu\n\nGoodwill Industries of Northwest Ohio\n\nDavid Takats\n\nChief Mission Officer\n\n(419) 255-0070 Ext. 3201\n\ndtakats@goodwillnwohio.org\n\nOwens Offers Student Registration Event with Expanded Hours, Opportunity to Win Scholarship\n\nPosted on August 1st, 2024\n\nEvent: Owens Community College One Day Registration\n\nWhen: Monday, August 5 from 10 a.m.-7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Owens Community College\n\nToledo-area Campus\n\nAdmissions Office in College Hall\n\n30335 Oregon Road, Perrysburg 43551\n\nWhat: With Fall Semester 2024 classes beginning Monday, August 19, Owens Community College is offering an expanded-hours One Day Registration.

The scenario-based videos cover mental health, domestic violence, school violence, the teen brain, suicide prevention and irate families. They last 8-12 minutes each and serve as standalone topics.\n\n“Training helps officers better understand and respond to situations as they occur and the new VR goggles will only enhance decision-making and problem-solving,” said Mark King, manager of OPOTA training at Owens. “Training is vital for officer success. Officers continue to train throughout their careers to ensure their safety, their partner’s safety and the safety of the community they serve.”\n\nOwens’ instructors spent two days learning how to utilize the VR goggles.\n\nOPOTA was founded at Owens in 1970 in cooperation with the Ohio Peace Officers Training Commission (OPOTC) and certified by the Ohio Attorney General’s office. In 2022, Owens was named a Close to Home regional advanced training site for current law enforcement professionals. More than 80 agencies in northwest Ohio also form the Law Enforcement Consortium and utilize 600 continuing education training hours annually.\n\nThe VR goggles will provide a low-cost, standardized training foundation for all officers in Ohio, according to the Attorney General’s office.\n\nThe training videos were produced by Ohio State University and Ohio University in cooperation with the Athens Police Department and Athens County Sheriff’s Office. The Attorney General’s office is already producing more scenario videos, tentatively scheduled for completion in summer 2025.\n\n“Our cadets pass their state certification at nearly 100 percent right now,” King said. “This new technology will only enhance their training and further prepare them for when they are on the job.”\n\nOwens Wins Lumina Foundation’s Instagram Challenge, $50,000 Award\n\nPosted on July 17th, 2024\n\nOwens Community College has been selected as one of seven winners in Lumina Foundation’s mini-grant opportunity and first Instagram challenge, resulting in a $50,000 award to enhance digital outreach and marketing efforts.\n\nLumina Foundation received more than 100 entries from public, accredited two-year institutions nationwide.\n\nJoining Owens as winners were:\n\nOhlone College, CA\n\nOcean County College, NJ\n\nCommunity College of Beaver County, PA\n\nState University of New York (SUNY) Niagara, NY\n\nChaffey College, CA\n\nJefferson State Community College, AL\n\nThe Owens’ Instagram reel was created and produced by the college’s Strategic Marketing and Communications office. Watch it here.\n\n“We are thankful to Lumina Foundation for recognizing the quality and engaging work our office does on social media interacting with our students,” said Tasha Hussain Black, Owens vice president of strategic initiatives, marketing and communications. “Our goal is to increase access to high-quality educational opportunities for the nearly 190,000 people aged 25 or older living in key parts of the City of Toledo who have attained a high school diploma or some college but who do not have a college degree. The $50,000 will help us connect with this market.”\n\nThrough the grant, Lumina wants community colleges to share stories and highlight the diverse and profound impact of a community college education.\n\n“For the past two years, Lumina has engaged in a national conversation about understanding and strengthening community college brands,” said Mary Laphen Pope, Lumina’s strategy officer for participation. “While discussions often focus on challenges such as enrollment declines, success stories about community colleges and their students are rarely highlighted. We aim to change that.\n\n“We were excited to offer this mini-grant opportunity and are so impressed by all the outstanding video reels we received. We hope this initiative will help shift the narrative around community colleges and all that they offer,” added Laphen Pope.\n\nFor more information about the mini-grant, visit Lumina’s Challenge Page.\n\nAbout Owens Community College\n\nOwens Community College has served Northwest Ohio since 1965 as an accredited two-year, state-assisted institution of higher education with an open-door admission policy.

The tour included three diverse locations in the Center for Campus and Community Connections, the new $31.3 million Healthcare Education Center and the Center for Emergency Preparedness.\n\nLed by Owens President Dr. Dione D. Somerville, her presentation highlighted several recent developments at Owens, including the letter of intent signed in February 2024 for a new microsite partnering with Toledo Public Schools and the University of Toledo at Scott Park in the City of Toledo.\n\nA year-long feasibility study, conducted by Trellis Strategies, revealed nearly 190,000 adults ages 25 and older, specifically in the City of Toledo, have attained a high school diploma or some college, but no degree.\n\nSomerville said the microsite, when opened, will increase student access, enhance adult student flexibility, promote collaboration with existing partners and, most importantly, address workforce needs supporting local economic development. Owens continues to consider additional microsite locations.\n\n“Owens is the triple crown powerhouse of this region,” Somerville said. “First, our mission is to serve the workforce needs of this region by being nimble and agile. Second, we are a critical part of the educational attainment of northwest Ohio based on the many ways students complete their education at Owens. And third, we are built to immediately respond to the needs of returning learners.\n\n“For all of our students, you need to look at the level of support provided by our wraparound services to understand why we are so passionate about what we do,” she added.\n\nThe tour commenced in the Center for Campus and Community Connections, an office focused on student resource stability initiatives that served nearly 1,600 students from its food pantry in the 2023-2024 academic year. The Owens Food Pantry was the first one established at an Ohio community college and functions as a model for other institutions.\n\nOwens is supporting the hunger-free campus bill to establish the Hunger-free Campus Grant Program and designation and to make an appropriation. House Bill 590 is in review.\n\n“Trellis showed that our student barriers include child care, transportation and the lack of immediate cash or credit,” Somerville said. “Our staff works to help resolve barriers that exist so that students can engage in education.”\n\nA focal point for students and staff over the past year, the north end of the new Healthcare Education Center will open for half of the School of Nursing and Health Professions programs in Fall 2024. The entire center is on schedule to be completed and opened for classes by Spring 2025.\n\nOffering 22 degrees and certificates across 11 healthcare disciplines, Owens averages more than 400 healthcare graduates annually, including 230 nurses.\n\nIn 2009, the Center for Emergency Preparedness was the crown jewel of campus buildings for public safety training. The center prepares new first responders for duty and also provides existing public and private safety professionals with advanced continuing education and “train the trainer” education opportunities.\n\nBolstered by realistic, scenario-based training props and equipment, the center is the home for the State of Ohio’s Ohio Peace Officer Training Commission Close to Home regional advanced training program as well as Toledo Police Academy and Toledo Fire Academy.\n\nWith training occurring daily, the Center for Emergency Preparedness will require significant investments for upgrades in the near future to meet the next generation of first responder training needs, the elected officials and representatives were told. Much of the original training equipment was donated when the center opened and is aging due to excessive use.\n\nOwens Hosts Open House Monday, June 10\n\nPosted on June 7th, 2024\n\nWhat\n\nOwens Community College Open House\n\nWhen\n\nMonday, June 10\n\n10 a.m.-5 p.m.\n\nWhere\n\nOwens Community College\n\nToledo-area Campus\n\nVeterans Hall Events Center (Room 201)\n\n363 Depot Road\n\nPerrysburg, OH 43551\n\nMore Information about the Open House\n\nThe admissions application fee will be waived for students who attend Open House and fill out the application at the event.

Butler and ODOT’s Rob White spent time reviewing the project schedule, how a diverging diamond interchange (DDI) works and the interchange’s benefits, which include increased capacity, efficiency and safety.\n\nChuck Bills, the former Owens Board of Trustee member who is president and CEO of Findlay’s Tall Timbers Ohio Logistics, was among the audience members to ask questions.\n\nTim Mayle, the executive director for the Center to Advance Manufacturing, a unique partnership created by Owens, the University of Findlay and Bowling Green State University, also addressed the audience as a member of ODOT’s Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC). The council approves the development and construction of major ODOT projects such as I-75/County Road 99 exchange.\n\nHe said to look at the project through the lens of enhancing safety, providing more traffic capacity and increasing the investment for businesses after completion.\n\n“This is important to the county,” Mayle said.\n\nFor more information, visit ODOT’s project site: https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/projects/projects/102375\n\nOwens Expands Healthcare Offerings in Findlay with New CPR Class\n\nPosted on April 15th, 2024\n\nOwens Community College is expanding its healthcare offerings on the Findlay-area Campus with a new American Heart Association Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers CPR class.\n\nThe first 4-hour class will be offered Thursday, April 25 in the Education Center at 3200 Bright Road, Findlay.

Sponsored by the BIG Read, the event is free and open to the public.\n\nHall described gun violence in America as “a club that no one wants to belong to, but it’s starting to get a large membership.”\n\nShe said losing Carlisle created multiple gaps for her family.\n\nHer son, Jermaine Byrd, and Carlisle had a daughter, Tashayla, who celebrated her 18th birthday a week before her mother’s death. Hall also noted Byrd and Carlisle had been working on getting back together, which is why Hall said she still calls Carlisle her “daughter-in-law”.\n\n“For my son, his half-brother was killed just a year before. It’s all of this inner-city living,” Hall said. “I hate for it to happen to anyone. If it’s not me, it’s somebody I know that it’s happened to. It’s such a shame. It’s destroying lives – just like drugs.”\n\nThe panel also includes:\n\nMalcolm Cunningham, Director of the Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, City of Toledo\n\nBrysen Davis, Violence Interrupter with Save Our Community\n\nJudy Harbaugh, local leader for Moms Demand Action\n\nSherin Henley, a gun violence survivor\n\nRebecca Facey, Toledo City Prosecutor\n\nMary Kruger, a gun violence survivor\n\nOwens Community College Hosts College & Career Preview Night\n\nPosted on February 28th, 2024\n\nHigh school students and their parents, as well as prospective students of all ages, are invited to meet with representatives from colleges, universities, industries and the military at the area’s premier college night event from 6:30 – 8 p.m. Wednesday, March 6 in the Student Health and Activities Center (7315 Championship Dr., Perrysburg, OH 43551).\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has made sweeping changes to the FAFSA starting with the 2024-25.

Somerville said. “With partners at Scott Park, we can build a foundation to address the needs for today’s students and workforce development.”\n\nBryan Ashton of Trellis Strategies presented the feasibility study research summary, which identified nearly 190,000 people aged 25 or older in key parts of the City of Toledo with only a high school degree or some college. Nearly 75 percent of the City of Toledo’s residents who are high school graduates did not enroll in college at graduation. Today that translates to more than half of the City of Toledo’s residents age 25-plus, or 55 percent, being college-ready.\n\n“The University of Toledo is proud to strengthen our long-standing partnerships with Owens Community College and Toledo Public Schools in our shared commitment to ensuring all members of our community have an opportunity to achieve their educational and career goals,” said UToledo President Gregory Postel. “By working together, we can help close the educational attainment gap in Toledo to celebrate both individual successes of earning a college degree and also the community benefit of strengthening the workforce and economic prosperity of our region.”\n\n“This new initiative with Owens Community College and the University of Toledo allows TPS to continue providing new and exciting educational opportunities for our students,” said Dr. Romules Durant, CEO/Superintendent of Toledo Public Schools. “We are excited that the future of the Scott Park Campus includes not only TPS students but adult learners who are ready to expand their education as they plan for their future.”\n\nWith the completed letter of intent signing, the educational leaders will now collaborate on what programming will be offered at Scott Park as well as a start date. No timeline has been established.\n\nKristi Clouse, JobsOhio, Senior Managing Director, Talent and Rosalyn Clemens, City of Toledo, Housing and Community Development Director also participated in the announcement. JobsOhio shared with Trellis Strategies its research related to workforce development for the advanced manufacturing sector in northwest Ohio. The City of Toledo provided financial support for the study.\n\nTrellis Strategies is a non-profit, Texas-based higher education research firm with expertise in program evaluation and workforce outcomes, and identifying transportation barriers and enrollment deserts.\n\n“We are thankful for the support and partnerships we have with the University of Toledo, Toledo Public Schools, the City of Toledo, JobsOhio and Trellis Strategies,” Somerville said. “We look forward to fulfilling our mission and providing quality higher education access at Scott Park.”\n\nDetails about the feasibility study and the Scott Park location will be added to https://www.owens.edu/feasibility/.\n\nOwens Community College, Partners to Announce Feasibility Study Results\n\nPosted on February 26th, 2024\n\nOwens Community College and its partners will announce the results of a year-long feasibility study assessing the need for a physical Owens presence in the City of Toledo.

The National TRIO Day Celebration was a collaborative event of the 11 northwest Ohio TRIO programs from Owens Community College, Bowling Green State University, Lourdes University, Northwest State Community College and the University of Toledo.\n\nThese programs are the catalyst for educational post-secondary attainment for first-generation and low-income individuals in the area.\n\nKnox, a first-generation college student who already earned a music business certificate from Owens 10 years ago, told the TRIO audience he was “sharing his heart.” In answering an audience question, he said it was in the past year, just turning 40 a week ago, that he began to master time management.\n\n“I come from YouTube University. I know I’m a hustler and I can’t sit still,” he said. “(To get an education) you have to make up your mind you’re going to stop and do the work.”\n\nKnox is part of the TRIO Student Support Services program.\n\nMore than 100 students and TRIO leaders attended the celebration, which began with the keynote presentation from Dr. Jessica R. McClain, Visiting Research Scientist at Indiana University. She spoke about resiliency and thriving by sharing her life story, which was inspired by the untimely passing of her father, Rev. Steve R. McClain.\n\nOwens President Dr. Dione D. Somerville also addressed the TRIO students, along with Northwest State President Dr. Todd Hernandez and State Rep. Michele Grim, State Rep. Josh Williams and Austin Serna, congressional assistant for U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur.\n\nWilliams shared his story of transitioning from a homeless high school dropout who considered suicide to attorney, college professor and elected official.\n\nThe closing speaker was a TRIO alum, BGSU graduate Myles Johnson, who started his entrepreneurship journey by selling cookies in the Atlanta airport at age 13. He talked about college challenges as well as building relationships on his way to returning to his teen-age home of Lansing, Michigan and winning the Ingham County Commissioner election at age 25.\n\nBetween speakers, the students participated in a service project, packing more than 100 bags of donated health and hygiene items for each college to donate to its respective food pantry or student resource office for student use.\n\n“Today has been very positive and inspiring,” said Lisa Robinson after helping pack the bags. She’s a 56-year-old Army veteran from Toledo who’s part of the Owens Veterans Upward Bound TRIO program. “I heard about resilience. I really liked how the first speaker talked about education.”\n\nThe event was led by Brandon Gaddy, Owens TRIO programs director, and a committee of representatives from the TRIO programs at the other colleges and universities. It was the third time Owens hosted the National TRIO Day celebration.\n\nOwens Community College Hosts 6th Annual Northwest Ohio TRIO Day Celebration\n\nPosted on February 20th, 2024\n\nAbout National TRIO Day\n\nThe National TRIO Day Celebration is a collaborative event of the Northwest Ohio TRIO programs including Owens Community College, Bowling Green State University, Lourdes University, Northwest State Community College and the University of Toledo.\n\nWhen\n\nSaturday, February 24, 2024\n\n10 a.m.-2 p.m.\n\n9:15 a.m.—Doors Open\n\n10 a.m. – Opening/Welcome\n\n10:30 a.m. – Keynote Speaker (Sponsored by: TRIO Educational Opportunity Center)\n\nDr. Jessica R.

It reinforces that we are part of a bigger community as a public college in Ohio that really understands and supports mental health.”\n\nOwens Community College Counseling Services offers consultation, mental health assessment, crisis support, outreach and linkage to community resources. The services are available at no charge to all students enrolled in six or more credit hours.\n\nHeck hopes the grant will elevate the support provided to the community at Owens. “This support allows us to continue to think broadly and creatively about how to best serve our students.

Baer played for the Express men’s soccer team, led by Art Johnson in the fall of 2006 and 2007. He brings a wealth of experience and success having previously served as head coach for two prominent high school soccer programs in both Mason and Ottawa Hills high school.\n\n“As an alumnus, Coach Baer understands the integral pieces of a successful program and the important balance of athletics and academics. He has the experience as a player and a coach to help lead this team as we re-establish men’s soccer in our sports offerings,” said Shelley Whitaker, Express Athletic Director.\n\nBaer will be tasked with restarting the men’s program that last competed in the fall of 2015.\n\n“I couldn’t be more excited to be chosen to lead the restart of Owens Community College men’s soccer program. First off, I would like to thank the athletic administration,” said Baer.\n\nOwens holds a significant place in Baer’s journey as a student-athlete, person and now coach. “I look forward to the connection, opportunities and impact Owens men’s soccer will bring to the northwest Ohio soccer community,” Baer said. The program will provide a platform to compete at the next level while creating a pathway for additional opportunities at 4-year institutions. “I am excited to pave the way and restore the tradition of competing at both the regional and national levels,” he added.\n\nMost recently, Baer spent three years as head coach at Mason High School achieving a record of 37-13-9 including a league record of 22-3-2 while earning two conference titles, three sectional titles and two district titles. His 2021 & 2022 finished as the No. 1 team in the city (Cincinnati).\n\nPrior to coaching at Mason, he served as head coach at Ottawa Hills High School for eight seasons. Under his leadership, the Green Bears compiled a record of 112-34-6 including a league record of 58-2 while winning eight league titles, eight sectional titles, four district titles, two regional titles and making one state final appearance. He earned what is considered the highest award high school soccer coaches can receive when he received the 2019 National Federation of State High Schools Coach of the Year. The NFHS award resulted from Baer having been named Ohio soccer coach of the year for 2018 by the Ohio High School Athletic Association.\n\nBaer has been named the league Coach of the Year from 2013-2021 between both high school programs. His coaching licenses include: USSF National E License, USSF National D License, Futsal Level 3/4, and TOVO methodology. Baer has also gained experience via the youth club soccer platform with Toledo Celtics, Pacesetter Soccer Club and Ohio Elite Soccer Academy.\n\nAfter his time at Owens, Baer went on to captain the Lake Erie College men’s soccer team while earning a bachelor’s degree in Marketing. He currently is the founder and principal consultant of a Data Analytics Consulting Startup.\n\nBaer resides in Perrysburg with his wife, Sam and daughters, Quinn, Brinnly, Rian and Logan.\n\nFor recruiting information, email nathan_baer@owens.edu\n\nOwens Community College to Award 343 Associate Degrees at 43rd Fall Commencement ceremonies\n\nPosted on December 12th, 2023\n\nOwens Community College will award 343 associate degrees Friday, December 15 at the 43rd Fall Commencement ceremonies at the Center for Fine and Performing Arts Theatre on the Toledo-area Campus in Perrysburg.\n\nA total of 39 students from the Findlay-area Campus will join the 304 Toledo-area Campus graduates for the Commencement ceremonies scheduled at 9 a.m. for the School of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; 12 p.m. for the School of Business, Hospitality Management and Public Safety, School of Liberal Arts and the Health Professions graduates from the School of Nursing and Health Professions; and 3 p.m. for the nursing graduation and pinning.\n\nThe graduating class features 88 students graduating with honors (3.5 grade-point average and above) as well as outstanding academic program graduates.
