While with the Bobcats, he developed offensive strategies and game plans. FSU would set program records for goals, assists, and points in a single season during the 2023 season. The Bobcats were tied for the highest assists per game average in the nation and were second in the country for points per game.\n\nThis led Frostburg State to an ECC Tournament championship game appearance along with six Bobcats earning All-ECC recognition and a USILA Honorable Mention All-American. Off the field, FSU earned a USILA Team Academic Award and one student-athlete was named a Scholar All-American.\n\n\"I would like to thank Tony Draves and the search committee for the opportunity to lead this program into the future,\" said Pearlman. \"We have everything we need to be successful as a program and I am excited to see the culture we can create. I have been very fortunate to have a lot of great mentors and supporters at Frostburg State University and in the lacrosse community. I am excited to give back and help this program grow.\"\n\nPrior to Frostburg State, Pearlman served as an assistant coach at Washington & Jefferson College and was a defensive coordinator at Stevenson High School, his alma mater. During his one season as a President, a shortened 2021 campaign due to CoVID-19, he served as a recruiting liaison and developed scouting reports for both the offense and defense. W&J had five all-conference award winners that season with one All-PAC First Team pick.\n\nPearlman also spent time as a head coach at the 6 Points Sports Academy where he was tasked with developing the fundamentals for youth players.\n\nHe played collegiately at Beloit College for four seasons and earned two MLC All-Academic Team selections. Pearlman was a long-stick midfielder who played in every game during his time as a Buccaneer. In his junior season, he helped lead the Buccaneers to a 10-6 record, just the second winning season in program history, with the Buccaneers claiming a share of an MLC Championship after going 7-1 in conference action.\n\nPearlman earned a bachelor's degree in applied chemistry from Beloit College in 2018 and then a master's degree in business administration from Frostburg State in 2023.\n\nYear Record Win Percentage Conference Record Win Percentage Postseason Awards 2024 3-10 .231 2-6 .250 2 NACC All-Conference Totals 3-10 .231 2-6 .250"
