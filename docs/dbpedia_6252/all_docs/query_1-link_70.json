        "text": "\"Krzyzewski\" redirects here. For the Polish family name, see Krzyżewski.\n\n\"Coach K\" redirects here. For the record producer, see Quality Control Music.\n\nMichael William Krzyzewski (US: shizh-EF-skee, Polish: [kʂɨˈʐɛfskʲi]; born February 13, 1947), nicknamed \"Coach K\", is an American former college basketball coach. He served as the head coach at Duke University from 1980 to 2022, during which he led the Blue Devils to five national titles, 13 Final Fours (the most of any coach in men's basketball), 15 ACC tournament championships, and 13 ACC regular season titles. Among men's college basketball coaches, only UCLA's John Wooden has won more NCAA championships (10). Krzyzewski is widely regarded as one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time.\n\nKrzyzewski has also coached the United States national team, which he led to gold medals at the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympics. He was the head coach of the U.S. team that won gold medals at the 2010 and the 2014 FIBA World Cup, and an assistant coach for the \"Dream Team\" at the 1992 Olympics.\n\nKrzyzewski was a point guard at Army from 1966 to 1969 under coach Bob Knight. From 1975 to 1980, he was the head coach for his alma mater. He is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in 2001 for his individual coaching career and in 2010 as part of the collective induction of the \"Dream Team.\" He was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006, and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009 (with the \"Dream Team\").\n\nOn November 15, 2011, Krzyzewski led Duke to a 74–69 victory over Michigan State at Madison Square Garden to become the coach with the most wins in NCAA Division I men's basketball history. Krzyzewski's 903rd victory set a new record, breaking that held by his former coach, Bob Knight. On January 25, 2015, Duke defeated St. John's, 77–68, again at Madison Square Garden, as Krzyzewski became the first Division I men's coach to reach 1,000 wins.\n\nEarly life\n\nKrzyzewski was born in Chicago, the son of Polish American parents Emily M. (née Pituch) and William Krzyzewski and was raised as a Catholic.\n\nHe was captain of the Army basketball team in his senior season, 1968–69, leading the Cadets to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) at Madison Square Garden in New York City, where West Point finished fourth.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1974, Krzyzewski served as an officer in the U.S. Army and directed service teams for three years. In 2005, he was presented West Point's Distinguished Graduate Award.\n\nEducation\n\nKrzyzewski attended St. Helen Catholic School in Ukrainian Village, Chicago and, later, Archbishop Weber High School in Chicago, a Catholic prep school for boys.\n\nHe later graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1969. He comes from a working-class family and is the first in his family to attend college and is a first-generation college student.\n\nCoaching career\n\nIndiana and Army\n\nHe was discharged from active duty in 1974 with the rank of captain, and started his coaching career as an assistant on Knight's staff with the Indiana Hoosiers during their historic 1974–75 season. After one year with Indiana, Krzyzewski returned to West Point as head coach at age 28; in his five seasons, he led the Army Cadets to a 73–59 (.553) record and an NIT berth in 1978.\n\nDuke\n\nOn March 18, 1980, Krzyzewski was named the head coach at Duke University after five seasons at Army. After a few rebuilding seasons, he and the Blue Devils became a fixture on the national basketball scene with 35 NCAA Tournament berths in the past 36 years and 24 consecutive from 1996 to 2019, behind Kansas which has appeared in the tournament in 30 consecutive seasons. Overall, he has taken his program to postseason play in 36 of his 39 years at Duke and is the most winning active coach in men's NCAA Tournament play with a 100–30 record for a .769 winning percentage. His Duke teams have won 15 ACC Championships, been to 13 Final Fours, and won five NCAA tournament National Championships.\n\nKrzyzewski had surgery to repair a ruptured disk in his back in October 1994, but insisted on returning to the sidelines for the 1994–95 season, using a special stool to keep him off his feet. However, the pain became so debilitating that he went several days without sleeping early in the season. By the start of ACC play, the pain had progressed to a point that he could not continue. Shortly after the first game of ACC play, Krzyzewski told his players and coaches that he was taking a leave of absence, with longtime assistant Pete Gaudet serving as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. He had actually planned to resign, but athletic director Tom Butters persuaded him to take a leave of absence instead. Per longstanding NCAA guidance, Duke only credits the first 12 games of the season to Krzyzewski and credits the remainder of the season to Gaudet. Years later, Krzyzewski said that he probably would have been out of basketball if he had not endured that season, since it made him realize he needed to manage his time better and delegate more responsibility.\n\nOn February 13, 2010 – his 63rd birthday – Krzyzweski coached in his 1,000th game as the Duke head coach. On March 20, 2011, Krzyzewski won his 900th game, becoming the second of three Division I men's basketball coaches to reach 900 basketball wins, the other two being Jim Boeheim at Syracuse and his head coach at Army, Bob Knight. On November 15, 2011, Krzyzewski got his 903rd win passing Knight's record for most Division I wins. In an interview of both men on ESPN the previous night, Krzyzewski discussed the leadership skills he learned from Knight and the United States Military Academy. Knight credited Krzyzewski's understanding of himself and his players as keys to his success over the years.\n\nOn January 25, 2015, Krzyzewski won his 1,000th game, when Duke defeated St. John's in Madison Square Garden. He is the first men's coach to win 1,000 NCAA Division I basketball games.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, Krzyzewski won his fifth NCAA championship, when Duke defeated Wisconsin in the title game.\n\nWinning against Yale in the 2016 NCAA tournament on March 19, Krzyzewski became the all-time winningest coach in the NCAA Division I tournament with 90 total wins.\n\nOn November 11, 2017, Krzyzewski won his 1,000th game with the Duke Blue Devils, making him the first head coach to win 1,000 games with one NCAA Division I men's basketball program.\n\nOn March 17, 2018, Krzyzewski won his 1,099th game in his career, passing Pat Summitt for most wins by a Division I coach, male or female.\n\nOn February 16, 2019, Krzyzewski won his 1,123rd game to become the winningest coach in college basketball history at any level (men's or women's), passing Harry Statham of Division II McKendree University. However, on January 21, 2024, Tara VanDerveer became the winningest head coach in college basketball history at any level, men's or women's, upon passing Krzyzewski with her 1,203rd win.\n\nOn June 2, 2021, Krzyzewski announced that he would retire at the conclusion of the 2021–22 season. Krzyzewski coached his final home game on March 5, 2022, against rival North Carolina, where Duke lost 94–81. Krzyzewski reached his 13th Final Four appearance, passing John Wooden for the most Final Four appearances as a coach, where Duke lost 81–77 to North Carolina in his final game on April 2, 2022. He ended his career at Duke with a 1,129–309 win-loss record.\n\nOn April 5, 2022, former Duke player Jay Williams theorized that Krzyzewski could return for another season, but Krzyzewski quickly put that theory to rest when he said he was not going to \"pull a Tom Brady\" on ESPNU Radio.\n\nNational team\n\nKrzyzewski's teams won three consecutive gold medals in the Olympics with him as head coach of the USA men's national team. His other international coaching accolades include a silver medal at the 1987 World University Games, a bronze medal at the 1990 FIBA World Championship, a silver medal at the 1990 Goodwill Games, a bronze medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, and gold medals at the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, the 2010 FIBA World Championship, and the 2014 FIBA World Cup.\n\nHe was also an assistant coach for USA teams that won gold medals at the 1984 and 1992 Olympics, 1979 Pan American Games, and 1992 Tournament of the Americas.\n\nIn 2005, he was appointed coach of the national team through the 2008 Olympics. In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, the USA won the bronze medal after losing in the semifinals to Greece, then beating defending Olympic gold medalist Argentina for third place.\n\nOn August 24, 2008, Krzyzewski's U.S. team won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. \"The Redeem Team\" finished the tournament with a perfect 8–0 record. He coached the U.S. team for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and led Team USA to a perfect 9–0 record, defeating host Turkey in the gold medal game, 81–64. His team won a second Olympic gold in London, defeating runners-up Spain, 107–100. Krzyzewski has amassed a total record of 75–1 (.987) as head coach of the USA National Team.\n\nIn February 2013, Krzyzewski stepped down after seven years of coaching the national team, but Team USA in May announced that he would return as head coach from 2013 through 2016.\n\nNBA coaching offers\n\nDuring his long tenure at Duke, Krzyzewski has been given the opportunity to coach in the NBA at least five times. The first time came after the 1990 season when he led the Blue Devils to their third straight Final Four appearance. The Boston Celtics offered a coaching position to Krzyzewski, but he soon declined their offer. The next season, Krzyzewski proceeded to lead the Blue Devils to the first of two straight national championships. In 1994, he was pursued by the Portland Trail Blazers, but again he chose to stay with Duke. In 2004, Krzyzewski was also interviewed by the Los Angeles Lakers following the departure of high-profile coach Phil Jackson. He was given a formal offer from Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak, reportedly for five years, $40 million and part ownership, but again turned down the NBA. In 2010, the New Jersey Nets were reportedly willing to pay Krzyzewski between $12 million and $15 million per season to coach the Nets. Krzyzewski again declined the offer and stayed at Duke. In 2011, Krzyzewski was offered the vacant coaching position for the Minnesota Timberwolves, but he again declined the offer and chose to stay at Duke.\n\nPost-retirement\n\nAlthough Krzyzewsk retired as Duke's basketball coach in 2022, he maintained a position at Duke University and continued to use his office in the Schwartz-Butters Athletic Center. As of 2023, he said he talked to successor coach Jon Scheyer on a near-daily basis. According to The Athletic, Krzyzewski's post-retirement focuses included charity work for The V Foundation and the Emily Krzyzewski Center, speaking gigs, and time with family. He made his first post-retirement appearance at a Duke game on February 14, 2023.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nNCAA\n\nFive-time NCAA Champion – 1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, 2015\n\nThree-time Naismith College Coach of the Year – 1989, 1992, 1999\n\n13-time ACC Regular Season Champion – 1986, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2010, 2022\n\n15-time ACC Tournament Champion – 1986, 1988, 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017, 2019\n\nFive-time ACC Coach of the Year – 1984, 1986, 1997, 1999, 2000\n\nTwo-time United States Sports Academy Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching Award winner – 1991, 2008.\n\nBasketball court at Cameron Indoor Stadium named \"Coach K Court\"\n\nUSA Basketball\n\nFive-time coach of Olympic Gold Medal winning teams – 1984, 1992 (assistant coach); 2008, 2012, 2016 (head coach)\n\nTwo-time FIBA World Cup Gold Medal winner – 2010, 2014\n\nTwo-time FIBA World Cup Bronze Medal winner – 1990, 2006\n\nHalls of Fame\n\nTwo-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee – 2001 (individual career), 2010 (with the \"Dream Team\")\n\nCollege Basketball Hall of Fame inductee (class of 2006)\n\nUnited States Olympic Hall of Fame inductee (class of 2009 – with the \"Dream Team\")\n\nFIBA Hall of Fame inductee (class of 2017 – with the \"Dream Team\")\n\nUnited States Military Academy Sports Hall of Fame inductee (class of 2009)\n\nNational Polish American Sports Hall of Fame inductee (class of 1991)\n\nMedia\n\n2001: Time/CNN America's Best Coach Award\n\n2011: Sports Illustrated \"Sportsman of the Year\"\n\nOther\n\n2013: Chicago History Museum Making History Award\n\nAward presented at the United States Military Academy named the \"Coach Krzyzewski Teaching Character Through Sports Award\"\n\nInducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2014 in the area of sports.\n\nReceived the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1995.\n\n2023: North Carolina State Board of Transportation voted to name three miles of North Carolina Highway 751 \"Coach K Highway\".\n\nFamily and charity\n\nKrzyzewski married his wife, Carol \"Mickie\" Marsh, in the Catholic chapel at West Point on the day of his graduation in 1969. They have three daughters and ten grandchildren. According to The Wall Street Journal, she was the only person who could persuade him to step down during the 1994–95 season when he was suffering from a ruptured disk. She actually went as far as to give her husband an ultimatum–if he wanted to come home on what would prove to be his final day of coaching that season, he needed to skip practice and go to the doctor. His grandson, Michael Savarino, was a walk-on player at Duke for the 2019–20 season.\n\nKrzyzewski and his family founded the Emily Krzyzewski Center, a non-profit organization affiliated with Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Durham, which was established in 2006 and named in honor of Krzyzewski's mother. The mission is to inspire students from kindergarten to high school to dream big, act with character and purpose, and reach their potential as leaders in their community. The center's K to College Model serves academically focused students in out-of-school programming designed to help them achieve in school, gain entry to college, and break the cycle of poverty in their families. Krzyzewski and his wife, Mickie, have also been active for years in fundraising and support for the Duke Children's Hospital, Children's Miracle Network, the V Foundation for Cancer Research. In all of those entities they have both served as chairs and/or led major fundraising efforts. In addition, the Krzyzewskis have been major donors to Duke University in supporting a number of areas, including establishing scholarship endowments for students in North and South Carolina as well as a Duke student-athlete every year. He also serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military services organization.\n\nIn 2012, Krzyzewski received the U.S. Basketball Writers Association's Wayman Tisdale Humanitarian Award honoring his civic service and charitable efforts in making a significant positive impact on society.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nCollege\n\nSeason Team Overall Conference Standing Postseason Army Cadets (NCAA Division I independent) (–1980) 1975–76 Army 11–14 1976–77 Army 20–8 1977–78 Army 19–9 NIT first round 1978–79 Army 14–11 1979–80 Army 9–17 Army: 73–59 (.553) Duke Blue Devils (Atlantic Coast Conference) (1980–2022) 1980–81 Duke 17–13 6–8 T–5th NIT quarterfinal 1981–82 Duke 10–17 4–10 T–6th 1982–83 Duke 11–17 3–11 7th 1983–84 Duke 24–10 7–7 T–3rd NCAA Division I Round of 32 1984–85 Duke 23–8 8–6 T–4th NCAA Division I Round of 32 1985–86 Duke 37–3 12–2 1st NCAA Division I Runner-up 1986–87 Duke 24–9 9–5 3rd NCAA Division I Sweet 16 1987–88 Duke 28–7 9–5 3rd NCAA Division I Final Four 1988–89 Duke 28–8 9–5 T–2nd NCAA Division I Final Four 1989–90 Duke 29–9 9–5 2nd NCAA Division I Runner-up 1990–91 Duke 32–7 11–3 1st NCAA Division I Champion 1991–92 Duke 34–2 14–2 1st NCAA Division I Champion 1992–93 Duke 24–8 10–6 T–3rd NCAA Division I Round of 32 1993–94 Duke 28–6 12–4 1st NCAA Division I Runner-up 1994–95 Duke 9–3 0–1 1995–96 Duke 18–13 8–8 T–4th NCAA Division I Round of 64 1996–97 Duke 24–9 12–4 1st NCAA Division I Round of 32 1997–98 Duke 32–4 15–1 1st NCAA Division I Elite Eight 1998–99 Duke 37–2 16–0 1st NCAA Division I Runner-up 1999–00 Duke 29–5 15–1 1st NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2000–01 Duke 35–4 13–3 T–1st NCAA Division I Champion 2001–02 Duke 31–4 13–3 2nd NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2002–03 Duke 26–7 11–5 T–2nd NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2003–04 Duke 31–6 13–3 1st NCAA Division I Final Four 2004–05 Duke 27–6 11–5 3rd NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2005–06 Duke 32–4 14–2 1st NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2006–07 Duke 22–11 8–8 6th NCAA Division I Round of 64 2007–08 Duke 28–6 13–3 2nd NCAA Division I Round of 32 2008–09 Duke 30–7 11–5 T–2nd NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2009–10 Duke 35–5 13–3 T–1st NCAA Division I Champion 2010–11 Duke 32–5 13–3 2nd NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2011–12 Duke 27–7 13–3 2nd NCAA Division I Round of 64 2012–13 Duke 30–6 14–4 2nd NCAA Division I Elite Eight 2013–14 Duke 26–9 13–5 T–3rd NCAA Division I Round of 64 2014–15 Duke 35–4 15–3 2nd NCAA Division I Champion 2015–16 Duke 25–11 11–7 T–5th NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2016–17 Duke 28–9 11–7 T–5th NCAA Division I Round of 32 2017–18 Duke 29–8 13–5 2nd NCAA Division I Elite Eight 2018–19 Duke 32–6 14–4 3rd NCAA Division I Elite Eight 2019–20 Duke 25–6 15–5 T–2nd No postseason held 2020–21 Duke 13–11 9–9 10th 2021–22 Duke 32–7 16–4 1st NCAA Division I Final Four Duke: 1,129–309 (.785) 466–193 (.707) Total: 1,202–368 (.766)\n\nNational champion Conference regular season champion Conference tournament champion\n\nConference regular season and conference tournament champion Conference division champion\n\n*The 2020 NCAA tournament was canceled due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCoaching tree\n\nAssistant coaches under Krzyzewski who became NCAA or NBA head coaches\n\nPete Gaudet – Army (1980–82)\n\nChuck Swenson – William & Mary (1987–1994)\n\nBob Bender – Illinois State (1989–1993), Washington (1993–2002)\n\nMike Brey – Delaware (1995–2000), Notre Dame (2000–2023)\n\nTommy Amaker – Seton Hall (1997–2001), Michigan (2001–2007), Harvard (2007–present)\n\nTim O'Toole – Fairfield (1998–2006)\n\nQuin Snyder – Missouri (1999–2006), Austin Toros (2007–2010), Utah Jazz (2014–2022), Atlanta Hawks (2023–present)\n\nDavid Henderson – Delaware (2000–2006)\n\nJeff Capel – VCU (2002–2006), Oklahoma (2006–2011), Pittsburgh (2018–present)\n\nJohnny Dawkins – Stanford (2008–2016), UCF (2016–present)\n\nChris Collins – Northwestern (2013–present)\n\nBobby Hurley – Buffalo (2013–2015), Arizona State (2015–present)\n\nSteve Wojciechowski – Marquette (2014–2021)\n\nNate James – Austin Peay (2021–2023)\n\nJon Scheyer – Duke (2022–present)\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: Mike Krzyzewski para niños"
