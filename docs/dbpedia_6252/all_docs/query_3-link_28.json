        "text": "BUIES CREEK, N.C. – Campbell Director of Athletics Hannah Bazemore officially announced Chris Marx as the Fighting Camels' next head baseball coach.\n\n\"I am excited to welcome Chris Marx back to Campbell as our head baseball coach,\" said Bazemore. \"A member of the Brotherhood that helped establish Campbell as one of the most successful programs in the country, Coach Marx has a proven track record of identifying, recruiting and developing talent both on the mound and at the plate, and most importantly, investing in student-athletes to help them succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community. I look forward to watching Coach Marx lead and continue the success of our great program.\"\n\n\"Myself, Niki and the boys are thrilled to be coming back to Buies Creek,\" said Marx. \"I want to thank Hannah Bazemore and Dr. Creed for their belief in me to continue the legacy of this program. I also want to thank Bob Roller and Justin Haire for allowing our family to begin this Campbell journey 10 years ago. I am very aware of the magnitude of the task at hand. There will be several challenges and there will be even more doubters, but that has fueled the fire of Campbell players and coaches for years and we welcome the challenge with open arms. I will work tirelessly to uphold the standard that has been set, and to make the faithful proud. May the BROTHERHOOD live on. Roll Humps!\"\n\nAn introductory press conference has been set for July 10 at 11:00 a.m. on campus in the Pope Convocation Center lobby. The public is invited to attend.\n\nThe former Campbell assistant brings 17 seasons of collegiate coaching experience, becoming the ninth NCAA Division I era head coach for the Camels, following Justin Haire, who departed for Ohio State after guiding Campbell for 10 seasons.\n\n\"Coach Chris Marx is no stranger to Campbell University, as he played a vital role as an assistant coach in building our successful baseball program,\" said Campbell University President Dr. J. Bradley Creed. \"His coaching experience in a Power Five program at Purdue University has given him additional opportunities for leadership and development as a coach. He is highly respected in our community and is the right person to carry on our winning tradition. I look forward to welcoming Coach Marx and his lovely family back home to Campbell University.\"\n\nMarx joins Campbell from Purdue, where he was the lead assistant and pitching coach for another former Campbell head coach, Greg Goff (2008-14), since 2020. Before the 2023 season, Marx transitioned to coaching position players while continuing to assist with the pitchers and recruiting.\n\nIn 2023, Marx helped guide the Purdue offense to a 6-2 Friday record during Big 10 play. Four different batters had 20-game on-base streaks, and the Boilermakers led the Big 10 in stolen bases (99) through the end of the conference tournament.\n\nIn the 2022 season, the Boilermakers set team records for strikeouts (479) and strikeouts per nine innings (9.57), also recording a program record for strikeouts in a four-game series in 2021 against Nebraska (46).\n\nPrior to Purdue, Marx served as Haire's lead assistant at Campbell for five seasons (2014-2019), directing the Camels' recruiting efforts and guiding the CU offense before transitioning to pitching coach duties.\n\nThe Camels compiled a 72-47 record (40-13 Big South) from 2018 to 2019, winning at least 35 games each year while sweeping Big South Pitcher of the Year (Allan Winans, Michael Horrell) and Freshman of the Year (Logan Bender, Ryan Chasse) awards in both seasons.\n\nMarx served as Campbell's hitting coach from 2015-17. The Camels won 32 games in 2015 and posted the program's top home run total since 2010, with Cole Hallum (12 homers) collecting Big South Player of the Year honors, and future MLB All-Star and Silver Slugger Cedric Mullins recording 80 hits. Right-hander Heath Bowers and catcher Steven Leonard joined Mullins as draftees in the 2015 MLB Draft.\n\nIn 2017, Drew Butler led the nation with 39 stolen bases, as Marx guided Campbell's aggressiveness on the base path.\n\nMarx recruited and/or coached numerous MLB Draft picks during his time in Buies Creek, with three to date, Mullins, Winans and Angels' shortstop Zach Neto, have made their MLB debuts.\n\nThe 2019 MLB Draft saw a record four Camels selected, led by 40th overall selection Seth Johnson, Campbell's highest ever draft pick at the time, followed by Matthew Barefoot (OF, Houston Astros), Michael Horrell (RHP, Houston Astros) and Tyson Messer (RHP, Chicago White Sox).\n\nMarx joined the staff at Arkansas-Little Rock prior to the 2012 season. That year, the Trojans hit a program-record 66 home runs, leading the nation in home runs per game and leading the Sun Belt in nine statistical categories.\n\nMarx's coaching career began in 2007, when he was a graduate assistant at Southern Indiana, helping guide USI to the 2010 NCAA Division II national title.\n\nA native of Evansville, Ind., Marx played collegiately at Olney Central College (2004-05) and Ouachita Baptist University (2006-07) under future coaching partner Haire. OBU climbed to No. 1 in the NCAA DII rankings in 2007 while winning 50 games.\n\nMarx earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Southern Indiana. He is joined in Buies Creek by his wife, Niki, and their three children, Clayton, Maddox and Everett.\n\nMARX'S COACHING CAREER BY SEASON\n\nCampbell (head coach) – Hired June 2024\n\nPurdue (assistant coach) – 2020-24\n\nCampbell (assistant coach) – 2015-19\n\nLittle Rock (assistant coach) – 2012-14\n\nSouthern Indiana (assistant coach) – 2008-11"
