        "text": "56 John Milton: Paradise Lost (Books 1-3)\n\n“Watercolor Illustration to Milton’s Paradise Lost” by William Blake, 1807. Wikimedia Commons.\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Emma Fendesack\n\nParadise Lost was written by John Milton, who is considered to be one of the greatest English poets of his or any age. It is an epic poem in blank verse; the first version, published in 1667, consists of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in the manner of Virgil’s ; Aeneid) with minor revisions throughout (“Paradise Lost”). It is considered to be Milton’s major work, and it helped solidify his reputation; the poem concerns the biblical story of the Fall of Man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. By 1652, Milton was completely blind and wrote Paradise Lost by reciting it to his daughters in their home in England (“SparkNote on Paradise Lost”). Milton believed that all poetry served a religious purpose and wrote his epic poem to help people become better Christians (“Paradise Lost in Popular Culture.”). Paradise Lost influenced many authors throughout history, including John Steinbeck, C.S. Lewis, and Mary Shelley.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res (Latin for in the midst of things), the background story being recounted later.\n\nMilton’s story has two narrative arcs, one about Satan (Lucifer) and the other following Adam and Eve. It begins after Satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or, as it is also called in the poem, Tartarus. In Pandæmonium, the capital city of Hell, Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organize his followers; he is aided by Mammon and Beelzebub. Belial and Moloch are also present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to corrupt the newly created Earth and God’s new and most favoured creation, Mankind. He braves the dangers of the Abyss alone in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus or Aeneas. After an arduous traversal of the Chaos outside Hell, he enters God’s new material World, and later the Garden of Eden.\n\nAt several points in the poem, an Angelic War over Heaven is recounted from different perspectives. Satan’s rebellion follows the epic convention of large-scale warfare. The battles between the faithful angels and Satan’s forces take place over three days. At the final battle, the Son of God single-handedly defeats the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishes them from Heaven. Following this purge, God creates the World, culminating in his creation of Adam and Eve. While God gave Adam and Eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation, he gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death.\n\nThe story of Adam and Eve’s temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. Adam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another – if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong.\n\nAfter eating the fruit, Adam and Eve have lustful sex. At first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience guilt and shame for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination.\n\nMeanwhile, Satan returns triumphantly to Hell, amid the praise of his fellow fallen angels. He tells them about how their scheme worked and Mankind has fallen, giving them complete dominion over Paradise. As he finishes his speech, however, the fallen angels around him become hideous snakes, and soon enough, Satan himself turns into a snake, deprived of limbs and unable to talk. Thus, they share the same punishment, as they shared the same guilt.\n\nEve appeals to Adam for reconciliation of their actions. Her encouragement enables them to approach God, and sue for grace, bowing on supplicant knee, to receive forgiveness. In a vision shown to him by the Archangel Michael, Adam witnesses everything that will happen to Mankind until the Great Flood. Adam is very upset by this vision of the future, so Michael also tells him about Mankind’s potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls “King Messiah”).\n\nAdam and Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find “a paradise within thee, happier far.” Adam and Eve also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden).\n\nLiterary Style\n\nParadise Lost is an epic poem written in blank verse, in the style of Homer and Virgil, meaning it doesn’t rhyme. It is also written in iambic pentameter, meaning that a line consists of a stressed syllable and then an unstressed syllable and so on and so forth until the next line. Milton was very much inspired by Virgil and his epic, Aeneid. This poem has many Latin characteristics, specifically where syntax is concerned, which makes it somewhat hard to understand because the word order is often reversed (“Paradise Lost Writing Style”), allowing Milton greater creative expression. This poetic style was popularized and later on became known as “Miltonic Verse” and was very influential for future English poets.\n\nThemes\n\nThis epic has many themes, but the main one that is consistently used throughout the poem is our obedience to God. The story of Adam and Eve is widely known, so the buildup and detail in this poem isn’t for suspense, but is to show how terribly Adam and Eve have sinned. It is described so that the reader is aware of how great the consequences that exist for those who disobey God’s law. “Paradise” and “Lost” represent the two different paths that one can take: “Paradise” could represent the redemption of Adam and Eve, one rooted in loyalty to God alone. “Lost” could represent the path of sin that Satan takes and one that anyone can take if they sin.\n\nControversies\n\nMilton also suggests that women were always the weaker sex through his characterization of Eve, who is portrayed as vain and easily swayed. Although accused of being sexist, Milton always denied it and suggested that he loved women. Eve was convinced to eat the fruit because Satan flattered her, suggesting that women care more about appearances than God’s word. Immediately after eating the fruit, she convinces Adam to eat it too so she won’t be alone in death. This, quite blatantly, suggests that women only care about themselves and that they are to blame for the fall of mankind.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Paradise Lost,” Wikipedia, 23 Oct. 2020. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost Accessed 24 Oct. 2020.\n\n“Paradise Lost in Popular Culture.” Wikipedia, 14 Apr. 2019, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost_in_popular_culture.

Which action past over, the Poem hasts into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels now fallen into Hell, describ’d here, not in the Center (for Heaven and Earth may be suppos’d as yet not made, certainly not yet accurst) but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest call’d Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning Lake, thunder-struck and astonisht, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who next in Order and Dignity lay by him; they confer of thir miserable fall. Satan awakens all his Legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded; They rise, thir Numbers, array of Battel, thir chief Leaders nam’d, according to the Idols known afterwards in Canaan and the Countries adjoyning. To these Satan directs his Speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new World and new kind of Creature to be created, according to an ancient Prophesie or report in Heaven; for that Angels were long before this visible Creation, was the opinion of many ancient Fathers. To find out the truth of this Prophesie, and what to determin thereon he refers to a full Councel. What his Associates thence attempt. Pandemonium the Palace of Satan rises, suddenly built out of the Deep: The infernal Peers there sit in Councel.\n\nOF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit\n\nOf that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast\n\nBrought Death into the World, and all our woe,\n\nWith loss of Eden, till one greater Man\n\nRestore us, and regain the blissful Seat, [ 5 ]\n\nSing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top\n\nOf Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire\n\nThat Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,\n\nIn the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth\n\nRose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill [ 10 ]\n\nDelight thee more, and Siloa’s Brook that flow’d\n\nFast by the Oracle of God; I thence\n\nInvoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,\n\nThat with no middle flight intends to soar\n\nAbove th’ Aonian Mount, while it pursues [ 15 ]\n\nThings unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.\n\nAnd chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer\n\nBefore all Temples th’ upright heart and pure,\n\nInstruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first\n\nWast present, and with mighty wings outspread [ 20 ]\n\nDove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss\n\nAnd mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark\n\nIllumin, what is low raise and support;\n\nThat to the highth of this great Argument\n\nI may assert Eternal Providence, [ 25 ]\n\nAnd justifie the wayes of God to men.\n\nSay first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view\n\nNor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause\n\nMov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,\n\nFavour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off [ 30 ]\n\nFrom thir Creator, and transgress his Will\n\nFor one restraint, Lords of the World besides?\n\nWho first seduc’d them to that foul revolt?\n\nTh’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile\n\nStird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d [ 35 ]\n\nThe Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride\n\nHad cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host\n\nOf Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring\n\nTo set himself in Glory above his Peers,\n\nHe trusted to have equal’d the most High, [ 40 ]\n\nIf he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim\n\nAgainst the Throne and Monarchy of God\n\nRais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud\n\nWith vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power\n\nHurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie [ 45 ]\n\nWith hideous ruine and combustion down\n\nTo bottomless perdition, there to dwell\n\nIn Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,\n\nWho durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.\n\nNine times the Space that measures Day and Night [ 50 ]\n\nTo mortal men, he with his horrid crew\n\nLay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe\n\nConfounded though immortal: But his doom\n\nReserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought\n\nBoth of lost happiness and lasting pain [ 55 ]\n\nTorments him; round he throws his baleful eyes\n\nThat witness’d huge affliction and dismay\n\nMixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:\n\nAt once as far as Angels kenn he views\n\nThe dismal Situation waste and wilde, [ 60 ]\n\nA Dungeon horrible, on all sides round\n\nAs one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames\n\nNo light, but rather darkness visible\n\nServ’d onely to discover sights of woe,\n\nRegions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace [ 65 ]\n\nAnd rest can never dwell, hope never comes\n\nThat comes to all; but torture without end\n\nStill urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed\n\nWith ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:\n\nSuch place Eternal Justice had prepar’d [ 70 ]\n\nFor those rebellious, here thir Prison ordain’d\n\nIn utter darkness, and thir portion set\n\nAs far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n\n\nAs from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.\n\nO how unlike the place from whence they fell! [ 75 ]\n\nThere the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d\n\nWith Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,\n\nHe soon discerns, and weltring by his side\n\nOne next himself in power, and next in crime,\n\nLong after known in Palestine, and nam’d [ 80 ]\n\nBeelzebub. To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,\n\nAnd thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words\n\nBreaking the horrid silence thus began.\n\nIf thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d\n\nFrom him, who in the happy Realms of Light [ 85 ]\n\nCloth’d with transcendent brightness didst out-shine\n\nMyriads though bright: If he Whom mutual league,\n\nUnited thoughts and counsels, equal hope\n\nAnd hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,\n\nJoynd with me once, now misery hath joynd [ 90 ]\n\nIn equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest\n\nFrom what highth fall’n, so much the stronger prov’d\n\nHe with his Thunder: and till then who knew\n\nThe force of those dire Arms? yet not for those,\n\nNor what the Potent Victor in his rage [ 95 ]\n\nCan else inflict, do I repent or change,\n\nThough chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind\n\nAnd high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,\n\nThat with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,\n\nAnd to the fierce contention brought along [ 100 ]\n\nInnumerable force of Spirits arm’d\n\nThat durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,\n\nHis utmost power with adverse power oppos’d\n\nIn dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,\n\nAnd shook his throne. What though the field be lost? [ 105 ]\n\nAll is not lost; the unconquerable Will,\n\nAnd study of revenge, immortal hate,\n\nAnd courage never to submit or yield:\n\nAnd what is else not to be overcome?\n\nThat Glory never shall his wrath or might [ 110 ]\n\nExtort from me. To bow and sue for grace\n\nWith suppliant knee, and deifie his power,\n\nWho from the terrour of this Arm so late\n\nDoubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\n\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath [ 115 ]\n\nThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\n\nAnd this Empyreal substance cannot fail,\n\nSince through experience of this great event\n\nIn Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,\n\nWe may with more successful hope resolve [ 120 ]\n\nTo wage by force or guile eternal Warr\n\nIrreconcileable, to our grand Foe,\n\nWho now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy\n\nSole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.\n\nSo spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain, [ 125 ]\n\nVaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:\n\nAnd him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.\n\nO Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,\n\nThat led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr\n\nUnder thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds [ 130 ]\n\nFearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;\n\nAnd put to proof his high Supremacy,\n\nWhether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,\n\nToo well I see and rue the dire event,\n\nThat with sad overthrow and foul defeat [ 135 ]\n\nHath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host\n\nIn horrible destruction laid thus low,\n\nAs far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences\n\nCan perish: for the mind and spirit remains\n\nInvincible, and vigour soon returns, [ 140 ]\n\nThough all our Glory extinct, and happy state\n\nHere swallow’d up in endless misery.\n\nBut what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now\n\nOf force believe Almighty, since no less\n\nThen such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours) [ 145 ]\n\nHave left us this our spirit and strength intire\n\nStrongly to suffer and support our pains,\n\nThat we may so suffice his vengeful ire,\n\nOr do him mightier service as his thralls\n\nBy right of Warr, what e’re his business be [ 150 ]\n\nHere in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,\n\nOr do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;\n\nWhat can it then avail though yet we feel\n\nStrength undiminisht, or eternal being\n\nTo undergo eternal punishment? [ 155 ]\n\nWhereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.\n\nFall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable\n\nDoing or Suffering: but of this be sure,\n\nTo do ought good never will be our task,\n\nBut ever to do ill our sole delight, [ 160 ]\n\nAs being the contrary to his high will\n\nWhom we resist. If then his Providence\n\nOut of our evil seek to bring forth good,\n\nOur labour must be to pervert that end,\n\nAnd out of good still to find means of evil; [ 165 ]\n\nWhich oft times may succeed, so as perhaps\n\nShall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb\n\nHis inmost counsels from thir destind aim.\n\nBut see the angry Victor hath recall’d\n\nHis Ministers of vengeance and pursuit [ 170 ]\n\nBack to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail\n\nShot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid\n\nThe fiery Surge, that from the Precipice\n\nOf Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,\n\nWing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, [ 175 ]\n\nPerhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now\n\nTo bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.\n\nLet us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,\n\nOr satiate fury yield it from our Foe.\n\nSeest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, [ 180 ]\n\nThe seat of desolation, voyd of light,\n\nSave what the glimmering of these livid flames\n\nCasts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend\n\nFrom off the tossing of these fiery waves,\n\nThere rest, if any rest can harbour there, [ 185 ]\n\nAnd reassembling our afflicted Powers,\n\nConsult how we may henceforth most offend\n\nOur Enemy, our own loss how repair,\n\nHow overcome this dire Calamity,\n\nWhat reinforcement we may gain from Hope, [ 190 ]\n\nIf not what resolution from despare.\n\nThus Satan talking to his neerest Mate\n\nWith Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes\n\nThat sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides\n\nProne on the Flood, extended long and large [ 195 ]\n\nLay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge\n\nAs whom the Fables name of monstrous size,\n\nTitanian, or Earth-born, that warr’d on Jove,\n\nBriareos or Typhon, whom the Den\n\nBy ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast [ 200 ]\n\nLeviathan, which God of all his works\n\nCreated hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:\n\nHim haply slumbring on the Norway foam\n\nThe Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,\n\nDeeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, [ 205 ]\n\nWith fixed Anchor in his skaly rind\n\nMoors by his side under the Lee, while Night\n\nInvests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:\n\nSo stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay\n\nChain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence [ 210 ]\n\nHad ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will\n\nAnd high permission of all-ruling Heaven\n\nLeft him at large to his own dark designs,\n\nThat with reiterated crimes he might\n\nHeap on himself damnation, while he sought [ 215 ]\n\nEvil to others, and enrag’d might see\n\nHow all his malice serv’d but to bring forth\n\nInfinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn\n\nOn Man by him seduc’t, but on himself\n\nTreble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d. [ 220 ]\n\nForthwith upright he rears from off the Pool\n\nHis mighty Stature; on each hand the flames\n\nDrivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld\n\nIn billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.\n\nThen with expanded wings he stears his flight [ 225 ]\n\nAloft, incumbent on the dusky Air\n\nThat felt unusual weight, till on dry Land\n\nHe lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d\n\nWith solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;\n\nAnd such appear’d in hue, as when the force [ 230 ]\n\nOf subterranean wind transports a Hill\n\nTorn from Pelorus, or the shatter’d side\n\nOf thundring Ætna, whose combustible\n\nAnd fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,\n\nSublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, [ 235 ]\n\nAnd leave a singed bottom all involv’d\n\nWith stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole\n\nOf unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,\n\nBoth glorying to have scap’t the Stygian flood\n\nAs Gods, and by thir own recover’d strength, [ 240 ]\n\nNot by the sufferance of supernal Power.\n\nIs this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,\n\nSaid then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat\n\nThat we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom\n\nFor that celestial light? Be it so, since he [ 245 ]\n\nWho now is Sovran can dispose and bid\n\nWhat shall be right: fardest from him is best\n\nWhom reason hath equald, force hath made supream\n\nAbove his equals. Farewel happy Fields\n\nWhere Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail [ 250 ]\n\nInfernal world, and thou profoundest Hell\n\nReceive thy new Possessor: One who brings\n\nA mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.\n\nThe mind is its own place, and in it self\n\nCan make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n. [ 255 ]\n\nWhat matter where, if I be still the same,\n\nAnd what I should be, all but less then he\n\nWhom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least\n\nWe shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built\n\nHere for his envy, will not drive us hence: [ 260 ]\n\nHere we may reign secure, and in my choyce\n\nTo reign is worth ambition though in Hell:\n\nBetter to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.\n\nBut wherefore let we then our faithful friends,\n\nTh’ associates and copartners of our loss [ 265 ]\n\nLye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,\n\nAnd call them not to share with us their part\n\nIn this unhappy Mansion, or once more\n\nWith rallied Arms to try what may be yet\n\nRegaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell? [ 270 ]\n\nSo Satan spake, and him Beelzebub\n\nThus answer’d. Leader of those Armies bright,\n\nWhich but th’ Onmipotent none could have foyld,\n\nIf once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge\n\nOf hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft [ 275 ]\n\nIn worst extreams, and on the perilous edge\n\nOf battel when it rag’d, in all assaults\n\nThir surest signal, they will soon resume\n\nNew courage and revive, though now they lye\n\nGroveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, [ 280 ]\n\nAs we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,\n\nNo wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.\n\nHe scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend\n\nWas moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield\n\nEthereal temper, massy, large and round, [ 285 ]\n\nBehind him cast; the broad circumference\n\nHung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb\n\nThrough Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views\n\nAt Ev’ning from the top of Fesole,\n\nOr in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, [ 290 ]\n\nRivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.\n\nHis Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine\n\nHewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast\n\nOf some great Ammiral, were but a wand,\n\nHe walkt with to support uneasie steps [ 295 ]\n\nOver the burning Marle, not like those steps\n\nOn Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime\n\nSmote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;\n\nNathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach\n\nOf that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d [ 300 ]\n\nHis Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t\n\nThick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks\n\nIn Vallombrosa, where th’ Etrurian shades\n\nHigh overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge\n\nAfloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm’d [ 305 ]\n\nHath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew\n\nBusiris and his Memphian Chivalry,\n\nWhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d\n\nThe Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld\n\nFrom the safe shore thir floating Carkases [ 310 ]\n\nAnd broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown\n\nAbject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,\n\nUnder amazement of thir hideous change.\n\nHe call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep\n\nOf Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, [ 315 ]\n\nWarriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,\n\nIf such astonishment as this can sieze\n\nEternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place\n\nAfter the toyl of Battel to repose\n\nYour wearied vertue, for the ease you find [ 320 ]\n\nTo slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?\n\nOr in this abject posture have ye sworn\n\nTo adore the Conquerour? who now beholds\n\nCherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood\n\nWith scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon [ 325 ]\n\nHis swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern\n\nTh’ advantage, and descending tread us down\n\nThus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts\n\nTransfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.\n\nAwake, arise, or be for ever fall’n. [ 330 ]\n\nThey heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung\n\nUpon the wing, as when men wont to watch\n\nOn duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,\n\nRouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.\n\nNor did they not perceave the evil plight [ 335 ]\n\nIn which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;\n\nYet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd\n\nInnumerable. As when the potent Rod\n\nOf Amrams Son in Egypts evill day\n\nWav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud [ 340 ]\n\nOf Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,\n\nThat ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung\n\nLike Night, and darken’d all the Land of Nile:\n\nSo numberless were those bad Angels seen\n\nHovering on wing under the Cope of Hell [ 345 ]\n\n‘Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;\n\nTill, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear\n\nOf thir great Sultan waving to direct\n\nThir course, in even ballance down they light\n\nOn the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; [ 350 ]\n\nA multitude, like which the populous North\n\nPour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass\n\nRhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons\n\nCame like a Deluge on the South, and spread\n\nBeneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands. [ 355 ]\n\nForthwith from every Squadron and each Band\n\nThe Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood\n\nThir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms\n\nExcelling human, Princely Dignities,\n\nAnd Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; [ 360 ]\n\nThough of thir Names in heav’nly Records now\n\nBe no memorial blotted out and ras’d\n\nBy thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.\n\nNor had they yet among the Sons of Eve\n\nGot them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, [ 365 ]\n\nThrough Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,\n\nBy falsities and lyes the greatest part\n\nOf Mankind they corrupted to forsake\n\nGod thir Creator, and th’ invisible\n\nGlory of him that made them, to transform [ 370 ]\n\nOft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d\n\nWith gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,\n\nAnd Devils to adore for Deities:\n\nThen were they known to men by various Names,\n\nAnd various Idols through the Heathen World. [ 375 ]\n\nSay, Muse, thir Names then known, who first, who last,\n\nRous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,\n\nAt thir great Emperors call, as next in worth\n\nCame singly where he stood on the bare strand,\n\nWhile the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? [ 380 ]\n\nThe chief were those who from the Pit of Hell\n\nRoaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix\n\nThir Seats long after next the Seat of God,\n\nThir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d\n\nAmong the Nations round, and durst abide [ 385 ]\n\nJehovah thundring out of Sion, thron’d\n\nBetween the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d\n\nWithin his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,\n\nAbominations; and with cursed things\n\nHis holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d, [ 390 ]\n\nAnd with thir darkness durst affront his light.\n\nFirst Moloch, horrid King besmear’d with blood\n\nOf human sacrifice, and parents tears,\n\nThough for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud\n\nThir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire [ 395 ]\n\nTo his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite\n\nWorshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,\n\nIn Argob and in Basan, to the stream\n\nOf utmost Arnon. Nor content with such\n\nAudacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart [ 400 ]\n\nOf Solomon he led by fraud to build\n\nHis Temple right against the Temple of God\n\nOn that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove\n\nThe pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence\n\nAnd black Gehenna call’d, the Type of Hell. [ 405 ]\n\nNext Chemos, th’ obscene dread of Moabs Sons,\n\nFrom Aroar to Nebo, and the wild\n\nOf Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon\n\nAnd Horonaim, Seons Realm, beyond\n\nThe flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, [ 410 ]\n\nAnd Eleale to th’ Asphaltick Pool.\n\nPeor his other Name, when he entic’d\n\nIsrael in Sittim on thir march from Nile\n\nTo do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.\n\nYet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d [ 415 ]\n\nEven to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove\n\nOf Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;\n\nTill good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.\n\nWith these came they, who from the bordring flood\n\nOf old Euphrates to the Brook that parts [ 420 ]\n\nEgypt from Syrian ground, had general Names\n\nOf Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,\n\nThese Feminine. For Spirits when they please\n\nCan either Sex assume, or both; so soft\n\nAnd uncompounded is thir Essence pure, [ 425 ]\n\nNot ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,\n\nNor founded on the brittle strength of bones,\n\nLike cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose\n\nDilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,\n\nCan execute thir aerie purposes, [ 430 ]\n\nAnd works of love or enmity fulfill.\n\nFor those the Race of Israel oft forsook\n\nThir living strength, and unfrequented left\n\nHis righteous Altar, bowing lowly down\n\nTo bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low [ 435 ]\n\nBow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear\n\nOf despicable foes. With these in troop\n\nCame Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call’d\n\nAstarte, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;\n\nTo whose bright Image nightly by the Moon [ 440 ]\n\nSidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,\n\nIn Sion also not unsung, where stood\n\nHer Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built\n\nBy that uxorious King, whose heart though large,\n\nBeguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell [ 445 ]\n\nTo Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,\n\nWhose annual wound in Lebanon allur’d\n\nThe Syrian Damsels to lament his fate\n\nIn amorous dittyes all a Summers day,\n\nWhile smooth Adonis from his native Rock [ 450 ]\n\nRan purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood\n\nOf Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale\n\nInfected Sions daughters with like heat,\n\nWhose wanton passions in the sacred Porch\n\nEzekiel saw, when by the Vision led [ 455 ]\n\nHis eye survay’d the dark Idolatries\n\nOf alienated Judah. Next came one\n\nWho mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark\n\nMaim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off\n\nIn his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, [ 460 ]\n\nWhere he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:\n\nDagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man\n\nAnd downward Fish: yet had his Temple high\n\nRear’d in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast\n\nOf Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon [ 465 ]\n\nAnd Accaron and Gaza’s frontier bounds.\n\nHim follow’d Rimmon, whose delightful Seat\n\nWas fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks\n\nOf Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.\n\nHe also against the house of God was bold: [ 470 ]\n\nA Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,\n\nAhaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew\n\nGods Altar to disparage and displace\n\nFor one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn\n\nHis odious off’rings, and adore the Gods [ 475 ]\n\nWhom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d\n\nA crew who under Names of old Renown,\n\nOsiris, Isis, Orus and their Train\n\nWith monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d\n\nFanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek [ 480 ]\n\nThir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms\n\nRather then human. Nor did Israel scape\n\nTh’ infection when thir borrow’d Gold compos’d\n\nThe Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King\n\nDoubl’d that sin in Bethel and in Dan, [ 485 ]\n\nLik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,\n\nJehovah, who in one Night when he pass’d\n\nFrom Egypt marching, equal’d with one stroke\n\nBoth her first born and all her bleating Gods.\n\nBelial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd [ 490 ]\n\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\n\nVice for it self: To him no Temple stood\n\nOr Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee\n\nIn Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\n\nTurns Atheist, as did Ely’s Sons, who fill’d [ 495 ]\n\nWith lust and violence the house of God.\n\nIn Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\n\nAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\n\nOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\n\nAnd injury and outrage: And when Night [ 500 ]\n\nDarkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\n\nOf Belial, flown with insolence and wine.\n\nWitness the Streets of Sodom, and that night\n\nIn Gibeah, when the hospitable door\n\nExpos’d a Matron to avoid worse rape. [ 505 ]\n\nThese were the prime in order and in might;\n\nThe rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,\n\nTh’ Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held\n\nGods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth\n\nThir boasted Parents; Titan Heav’ns first born [ 510 ]\n\nWith his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d\n\nBy younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove\n\nHis own and Rhea’s Son like measure found;\n\nSo Jove usurping reign’d: these first in Creet\n\nAnd Ida known, thence on the Snowy top [ 515 ]\n\nOf cold Olympus rul’d the middle Air\n\nThir highest Heav’n; or on the Delphian Cliff,\n\nOr in Dodona, and through all the bounds\n\nOf Doric Land; or who with Saturn old\n\nFled over Adria to th’ Hesperian Fields, [ 520 ]\n\nAnd ore the Celtic roam’d the utmost Isles.\n\nAll these and more came flocking; but with looks\n\nDown cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d\n\nObscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief\n\nNot in despair, to have found themselves not lost [ 525 ]\n\nIn loss it self; which on his count’nance cast\n\nLike doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride\n\nSoon recollecting, with high words, that bore\n\nSemblance of worth, not substance, gently rais’d\n\nThir fainting courage, and dispel’d thir fears. [ 530 ]\n\nThen strait commands that at the warlike sound\n\nOf Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard\n\nHis mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d\n\nAzazel as his right, a Cherube tall:\n\nWho forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld [ 535 ]\n\nTh’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t\n\nShon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind\n\nWith Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,\n\nSeraphic arms and Trophies: all the while\n\nSonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: [ 540 ]\n\nAt which the universal Host upsent\n\nA shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond\n\nFrighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.\n\nAll in a moment through the gloom were seen\n\nTen thousand Banners rise into the Air [ 545 ]\n\nWith Orient Colours waving: with them rose\n\nA Forest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms\n\nAppear’d, and serried shields in thick array\n\nOf depth immeasurable: Anon they move\n\nIn perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood [ 550 ]\n\nOf Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d\n\nTo hight of noblest temper Hero’s old\n\nArming to Battel, and in stead of rage\n\nDeliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d\n\nWith dread of death to flight or foul retreat, [ 555 ]\n\nNor wanting power to mitigate and swage\n\nWith solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase\n\nAnguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain\n\nFrom mortal or immortal minds. Thus they\n\nBreathing united force with fixed thought [ 560 ]\n\nMov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d\n\nThir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now\n\nAdvanc’t in view, they stand, a horrid Front\n\nOf dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise\n\nOf Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield, [ 565 ]\n\nAwaiting what command thir mighty Chief\n\nHad to impose: He through the armed Files\n\nDarts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse\n\nThe whole Battalion views, thir order due,\n\nThir visages and stature as of Gods, [ 570 ]\n\nThir number last he summs. And now his heart\n\nDistends with pride, and hardning in his strength\n\nGlories: For never since created man,\n\nMet such imbodied force, as nam’d with these\n\nCould merit more then that small infantry [ 575 ]\n\nWarr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood\n\nOf Phlegra with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d\n\nThat fought at Theb’s and Ilium, on each side\n\nMixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds\n\nIn Fable or Romance of Uthers Son [ 580 ]\n\nBegirt with British and Armoric Knights;\n\nAnd all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel\n\nJousted in Aspramont or Montalban,\n\nDamasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,\n\nOr whom Biserta sent from Afric shore [ 585 ]\n\nWhen Charlemain with all his Peerage fell\n\nBy Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond\n\nCompare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d\n\nThir dread commander: he above the rest\n\nIn shape and gesture proudly eminent [ 590 ]\n\nStood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost\n\nAll her Original brightness, nor appear’d\n\nLess then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess\n\nOf Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n\n\nLooks through the Horizontal misty Air [ 595 ]\n\nShorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon\n\nIn dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds\n\nOn half the Nations, and with fear of change\n\nPerplexes Monarchs. Dark’n’d so, yet shon\n\nAbove them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face [ 600 ]\n\nDeep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care\n\nSat on his faded cheek, but under Browes\n\nOf dauntless courage, and considerate Pride\n\nWaiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast\n\nSigns of remorse and passion to behold [ 605 ]\n\nThe fellows of his crime, the followers rather\n\n(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d\n\nFor ever now to have thir lot in pain,\n\nMillions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t\n\nOf Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung [ 610 ]\n\nFor his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,\n\nThir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire\n\nHath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,\n\nWith singed top thir stately growth though bare\n\nStands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar’d [ 615 ]\n\nTo speak; whereat thir doubl’d Ranks they bend\n\nFrom wing to wing, and half enclose him round\n\nWith all his Peers: attention held them mute.\n\nThrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn,\n\nTears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last [ 620 ]\n\nWords interwove with sighs found out thir way.\n\nO Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers\n\nMatchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife\n\nWas not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,\n\nAs this place testifies, and this dire change [ 625 ]\n\nHateful to utter: but what power of mind\n\nForeseeing or presaging, from the Depth\n\nOf knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,\n\nHow such united force of Gods, how such\n\nAs stood like these, could ever know repulse? [ 630 ]\n\nFor who can yet beleeve, though after loss,\n\nThat all these puissant Legions, whose exile\n\nHath emptied Heav’n, shall fail to re-ascend\n\nSelf-rais’d, and repossess thir native seat?\n\nFor mee be witness all the Host of Heav’n, [ 635 ]\n\nIf counsels different, or danger shun’d\n\nBy me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns\n\nMonarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure\n\nSat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,\n\nConsent or custome, and his Regal State [ 640 ]\n\nPut forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,\n\nWhich tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.\n\nHenceforth his might we know, and know our own\n\nSo as not either to provoke, or dread\n\nNew warr, provok’t; our better part remains [ 645 ]\n\nTo work in close design, by fraud or guile\n\nWhat force effected not: that he no less\n\nAt length from us may find, who overcomes\n\nBy force, hath overcome but half his foe.\n\nSpace may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife [ 650 ]\n\nThere went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long\n\nIntended to create, and therein plant\n\nA generation, whom his choice regard\n\nShould favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:\n\nThither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps\n\nOur first eruption, thither or elsewhere: [ 655 ]\n\nFor this Infernal Pit shall never hold\n\nCælestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abyss\n\nLong under darkness cover. But these thoughts\n\nFull Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, [ 660 ]\n\nFor who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr\n\nOpen or understood must be resolv’d.\n\nHe spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew\n\nMillions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs\n\nOf mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze [ 665 ]\n\nFar round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d\n\nAgainst the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms\n\nClash’d on thir sounding Shields the din of war,\n\nHurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.\n\nThere stood a Hill not far whose griesly top [ 670 ]\n\nBelch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire\n\nShon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign\n\nThat in his womb was hid metallic Ore,\n\nThe work of Sulphur. Thither wing’d with speed\n\nA numerous Brigad hasten’d. As when Bands [ 675 ]\n\nOf Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm’d\n\nForerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,\n\nOr cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on,\n\nMammon, the least erected Spirit that fell\n\nFrom heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks and thoughts [ 680 ]\n\nWere always downward bent, admiring more\n\nThe riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,\n\nThen aught divine or holy else enjoy’d\n\nIn vision beatific: by him first\n\nMen also, and by his suggestion taught, [ 685 ]\n\nRansack’d the Center, and with impious hands\n\nRifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth\n\nFor Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew\n\nOp’nd into the Hill a spacious wound\n\nAnd dig’d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire [ 690 ]\n\nThat riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best\n\nDeserve the precious bane. And here let those\n\nWho boast in mortal things, and wond’ring tell\n\nOf Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings\n\nLearn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, [ 695 ]\n\nAnd Strength and Art are easily out-done\n\nBy Spirits reprobate, and in an hour\n\nWhat in an age they with incessant toyle\n\nAnd hands innumerable scarce perform.\n\nNigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d, [ 700 ]\n\nThat underneath had veins of liquid fire\n\nSluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude\n\nWith wondrous Art found out the massie Ore,\n\nSevering each kind, and scum’d the Bullion dross:\n\nA third as soon had form’d within the ground [ 705 ]\n\nA various mould, and from the boyling cells\n\nBy strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,\n\nAs in an Organ from one blast of wind\n\nTo many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.\n\nAnon out of the earth a Fabrick huge [ 710 ]\n\nRose like an Exhalation, with the sound\n\nOf Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,\n\nBuilt like a Temple, where Pilasters round\n\nWere set, and Doric pillars overlaid\n\nWith Golden Architrave; nor did there want [ 715 ]\n\nCornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,\n\nThe Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon,\n\nNor great Alcairo such magnificence\n\nEqual’d in all thir glories, to inshrine\n\nBelus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat [ 720 ]\n\nThir Kings, when Ægypt with Assyria strove\n\nIn wealth and luxurie. Th’ ascending pile\n\nStood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores\n\nOp’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide\n\nWithin, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth [ 725 ]\n\nAnd level pavement: from the arched roof\n\nPendant by suttle Magic many a row\n\nOf Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed\n\nWith Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light\n\nAs from a sky. The hasty multitude [ 730 ]\n\nAdmiring enter’d, and the work some praise\n\nAnd some the Architect: his hand was known\n\nIn Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,\n\nWhere Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,\n\nAnd sat as Princes, whom the supreme King [ 735 ]\n\nExalted to such power, and gave to rule,\n\nEach in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright.\n\nNor was his name unheard or unador’d\n\nIn ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land\n\nMen call’d him Mulciber; and how he fell [ 740 ]\n\nFrom Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry Jove\n\nSheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn\n\nTo Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,\n\nA Summers day; and with the setting Sun\n\nDropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, [ 745 ]\n\nOn Lemnos th’ Ægean Ile: thus they relate,\n\nErring; for he with this rebellious rout\n\nFell long before; nor aught avail’d him now\n\nTo have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape\n\nBy all his Engins, but was headlong sent [ 750 ]\n\nWith his industrious crew to build in hell.\n\nMean while the winged Haralds by command\n\nOf Sovran power, with awful Ceremony\n\nAnd Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim\n\nA solemn Councel forthwith to be held [ 755 ]\n\nAt Pandæmonium, the high Capital\n\nOf Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d\n\nFrom every Band and squared Regiment\n\nBy place or choice the worthiest; they anon\n\nWith hunderds and with thousands trooping came [ 760 ]\n\nAttended: all access was throng’d, the Gates\n\nAnd Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall\n\n(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold\n\nWont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair\n\nDefi’d the best of Paynim chivalry [ 765 ]\n\nTo mortal combat or carreer with Lance)\n\nThick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,\n\nBrusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees\n\nIn spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,\n\nPour forth thir populous youth about the Hive [ 770 ]\n\nIn clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\n\nFlie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,\n\nThe suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,\n\nNew rub’d with Baum, expatiate and confer\n\nThir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd [ 775 ]\n\nSwarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n.\n\nBehold a wonder! they but now who seemd\n\nIn bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons\n\nNow less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room\n\nThrong numberless, like that Pigmean Race [ 780 ]\n\nBeyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves,\n\nWhose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side\n\nOr Fountain some belated Peasant sees,\n\nOr dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon\n\nSits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth [ 785 ]\n\nWheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance\n\nIntent, with jocond Music charm his ear;\n\nAt once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.\n\nThus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms\n\nReduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large, [ 790 ]\n\nThough without number still amidst the Hall\n\nOf that infernal Court. But far within\n\nAnd in thir own dimensions like themselves\n\nThe great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim\n\nIn close recess and secret conclave sat [ 795 ]\n\nA thousand Demy-Gods on golden seats,\n\nFrequent and full. After short silence then\n\nAnd summons read, the great consult began.\n\nBOOK 2\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\nThe Consultation begun, Satan debates whether another Battel be to be hazarded for the recovery of Heaven: some advise it, others dissuade: A third proposal is prefer’d, mention’d before by Satan, to search the truth of that Prophesie or Tradition in Heaven concerning another world, and another kind of creature equal or not much inferiour to themselves, about this time to be created: Thir doubt who shall be sent on this difficult search: Satan thir chief undertakes alone the voyage, is honourd and applauded. The Councel thus ended, the rest betake them several wayes and to several imployments, as thir inclinations lead them, to entertain the time till Satan return. He passes on his journey to Hell Gates, finds them shut, and who sat there to guard them, by whom at length they are op’nd, and discover to him the great Gulf between Hell and Heaven; with what difficulty he passes through, directed by Chaos, the Power of that place, to the sight of this new World which he sought.\n\nHIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far\n\nOutshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,\n\nOr where the gorgeous East with richest hand\n\nShowrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold,\n\nSatan exalted sat, by merit rais’d [ 5 ]\n\nTo that bad eminence; and from despair\n\nThus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires\n\nBeyond thus high, insatiate to pursue\n\nVain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught\n\nHis proud imaginations thus displaid. [ 10 ]\n\nPowers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,\n\nFor since no deep within her gulf can hold\n\nImmortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,\n\nI give not Heav’n for lost. From this descent\n\nCelestial vertues rising, will appear [ 15 ]\n\nMore glorious and more dread then from no fall,\n\nAnd trust themselves to fear no second fate:\n\nMee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n\n\nDid first create your Leader, next free choice,\n\nWith what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, [ 20 ]\n\nHath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss\n\nThus farr at least recover’d, hath much more\n\nEstablisht in a safe unenvied Throne\n\nYielded with full consent. The happier state\n\nIn Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw [ 25 ]\n\nEnvy from each inferior; but who here\n\nWill envy whom the highest place exposes\n\nFormost to stand against the Thunderers aim\n\nYour bulwark, and condemns to greatest share\n\nOf endless pain? where there is then no good [ 30 ]\n\nFor which to strive, no strife can grow up there\n\nFrom Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell\n\nPrecedence, none, whose portion is so small\n\nOf present pain, that with ambitious mind\n\nWill covet more. With this advantage then [ 35 ]\n\nTo union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,\n\nMore then can be in Heav’n, we now return\n\nTo claim our just inheritance of old,\n\nSurer to prosper then prosperity\n\nCould have assur’d us; and by what best way, [ 40 ]\n\nWhether of open Warr or covert guile,\n\nWe now debate; who can advise, may speak.\n\nHe ceas’d, and next him Moloc, Scepter’d King\n\nStood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit\n\nThat fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair: [ 45 ]\n\nHis trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d\n\nEqual in strength, and rather then be less\n\nCare’d not to be at all; with that care lost\n\nWent all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse\n\nHe reck’d not, and these words thereafter spake. [ 50 ]\n\nMy sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,\n\nMore unexpert, I boast not: them let those\n\nContrive who need, or when they need, not now.\n\nFor while they sit contriving, shall the rest,\n\nMillions that stand in Arms, and longing wait [ 55 ]\n\nThe Signal to ascend, sit lingring here\n\nHeav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place\n\nAccept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,\n\nThe Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns\n\nBy our delay? no, let us rather choose [ 60 ]\n\nArm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once\n\nO’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way,\n\nTurning our Tortures into horrid Arms\n\nAgainst the Torturer; when to meet the noise\n\nOf his Almighty Engin he shall hear [ 65 ]\n\nInfernal Thunder, and for Lightning see\n\nBlack fire and horror shot with equal rage\n\nAmong his Angels; and his Throne it self\n\nMixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire,\n\nHis own invented Torments. But perhaps [ 70 ]\n\nThe way seems difficult and steep to scale\n\nWith upright wing against a higher foe.\n\nLet such bethink them, if the sleepy drench\n\nOf that forgetful Lake benumm not still,\n\nThat in our proper motion we ascend [ 75 ]\n\nUp to our native seat: descent and fall\n\nTo us is adverse. Who but felt of late\n\nWhen the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear\n\nInsulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,\n\nWith what compulsion and laborious flight [ 80 ]\n\nWe sunk thus low? Th’ ascent is easie then;\n\nTh’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke\n\nOur stronger, some worse way his wrath may find\n\nTo our destruction: if there be in Hell\n\nFear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse [ 85 ]\n\nThen to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d\n\nIn this abhorred deep to utter woe;\n\nWhere pain of unextinguishable fire\n\nMust exercise us without hope of end\n\nThe Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge [ 90 ]\n\nInexorably, and the torturing hour\n\nCalls us to Penance? More destroy’d then thus\n\nWe should be quite abolisht and expire.\n\nWhat fear we then? what doubt we to incense\n\nHis utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d, [ 95 ]\n\nWill either quite consume us, and reduce\n\nTo nothing this essential, happier farr\n\nThen miserable to have eternal being:\n\nOr if our substance be indeed Divine,\n\nAnd cannot cease to be, we are at worst [ 100 ]\n\nOn this side nothing; and by proof we feel\n\nOur power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,\n\nAnd with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,\n\nThough inaccessible, his fatal Throne:\n\nWhich if not Victory is yet Revenge. [ 105 ]\n\nHe ended frowning, and his look denounc’d\n\nDesperate revenge, and Battel dangerous\n\nTo less then Gods. On th’ other side up rose\n\nBelial, in act more graceful and humane;\n\nA fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd [ 110 ]\n\nFor dignity compos’d and high exploit:\n\nBut all was false and hollow; though his Tongue\n\nDropt Manna, and could make the worse appear\n\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\n\nMaturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; [ 115 ]\n\nTo vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds\n\nTimorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the ear,\n\nAnd with perswasive accent thus began.\n\nI should be much for open Warr, O Peers,\n\nAs not behind in hate; if what was urg’d [ 120 ]\n\nMain reason to persuade immediate Warr,\n\nDid not disswade me most, and seem to cast\n\nOminous conjecture on the whole success:\n\nWhen he who most excels in fact of Arms,\n\nIn what he counsels and in what excels [ 125 ]\n\nMistrustful, grounds his courage on despair\n\nAnd utter dissolution, as the scope\n\nOf all his aim, after some dire revenge.\n\nFirst, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d\n\nWith Armed watch, that render all access [ 130 ]\n\nImpregnable; oft on the bordering Deep\n\nEncamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing\n\nScout farr and wide into the Realm of night,\n\nScorning surprize. Or could we break our way\n\nBy force, and at our heels all Hell should rise [ 135 ]\n\nWith blackest Insurrection, to confound\n\nHeav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy\n\nAll incorruptible would on his Throne\n\nSit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould\n\nIncapable of stain would soon expel [ 140 ]\n\nHer mischief, and purge off the baser fire\n\nVictorious. Thus repuls’d, our final hope\n\nIs flat despair; we must exasperate\n\nTh’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,\n\nAnd that must end us, that must be our cure, [ 145 ]\n\nTo be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,\n\nThough full of pain, this intellectual being,\n\nThose thoughts that wander through Eternity,\n\nTo perish rather, swallowd up and lost\n\nIn the wide womb of uncreated night, [ 150 ]\n\nDevoid of sense and motion? and who knows,\n\nLet this be good, whether our angry Foe\n\nCan give it, or will ever? how he can\n\nIs doubtful; that he never will is sure.\n\nWill he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, [ 155 ]\n\nBelike through impotence, or unaware,\n\nTo give his Enemies thir wish, and end\n\nThem in his anger, whom his anger saves\n\nTo punish endless? wherefore cease we then?\n\nSay they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, [ 160 ]\n\nReserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe;\n\nWhatever doing, what can we suffer more,\n\nWhat can we suffer worse? is this then worst,\n\nThus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?\n\nWhat when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook [ 165 ]\n\nWith Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought\n\nThe Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d\n\nA refuge from those wounds: or when we lay\n\nChain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.\n\nWhat if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires [ 170 ]\n\nAwak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage\n\nAnd plunge us in the flames? or from above\n\nShould intermitted vengeance arm again\n\nHis red right hand to plague us? what if all\n\nHer stores were open’d, and this Firmament [ 175 ]\n\nOf Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,\n\nImpendent horrors, threatning hideous fall\n\nOne day upon our heads; while we perhaps\n\nDesigning or exhorting glorious warr,\n\nCaught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d [ 180 ]\n\nEach on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey\n\nOf racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk\n\nUnder yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;\n\nThere to converse with everlasting groans,\n\nUnrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, [ 185 ]\n\nAges of hopeless end; this would be worse.\n\nWarr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike\n\nMy voice disswades; for what can force or guile\n\nWith him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye\n\nViews all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth [ 190 ]\n\nAll these our motions vain, sees and derides;\n\nNot more Almighty to resist our might\n\nThen wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.\n\nShall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n\n\nThus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here [ 195 ]\n\nChains and these Torments? better these then worse\n\nBy my advice; since fate inevitable\n\nSubdues us, and Omnipotent Decree\n\nThe Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,\n\nOur strength is equal, nor the Law unjust [ 200 ]\n\nThat so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,\n\nIf we were wise, against so great a foe\n\nContending, and so doubtful what might fall.\n\nI laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold\n\nAnd vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear [ 205 ]\n\nWhat yet they know must follow, to endure\n\nExile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,\n\nThe sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now\n\nOur doom; which if we can sustain and bear,\n\nOur Supream Foe in time may much remit [ 210 ]\n\nHis anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d\n\nNot mind us not offending, satisfi’d\n\nWith what is punish’t; whence these raging fires\n\nWill slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames.\n\nOur purer essence then will overcome [ 215 ]\n\nThir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,\n\nOr chang’d at length, and to the place conformd\n\nIn temper and in nature, will receive\n\nFamiliar the fierce heat, and void of pain;\n\nThis horror will grow milde, this darkness light, [ 220 ]\n\nBesides what hope the never-ending flight\n\nOf future dayes may bring, what chance, what change\n\nWorth waiting, since our present lot appeers\n\nFor happy though but ill, for ill not worst,\n\nIf we procure not to our selves more woe. [ 225 ]\n\nThus Belial with words cloath’d in reasons garb\n\nCounsell’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,\n\nNot peace: and after him thus Mammon spake.\n\nEither to disinthrone the King of Heav’n\n\nWe warr, if Warr be best, or to regain [ 230 ]\n\nOur own right lost: him to unthrone we then\n\nMay hope when everlasting Fate shall yeild\n\nTo fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife:\n\nThe former vain to hope argues as vain\n\nThe latter: for what place can be for us [ 235 ]\n\nWithin Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream\n\nWe overpower? Suppose he should relent\n\nAnd publish Grace to all, on promise made\n\nOf new Subjection; with what eyes could we\n\nStand in his presence humble, and receive [ 240 ]\n\nStrict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne\n\nWith warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing\n\nForc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits\n\nOur envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes\n\nAmbrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, [ 245 ]\n\nOur servile offerings. This must be our task\n\nIn Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom\n\nEternity so spent in worship paid\n\nTo whom we hate. Let us not then pursue\n\nBy force impossible, by leave obtain’d [ 250 ]\n\nUnacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state\n\nOf splendid vassalage, but rather seek\n\nOur own good from our selves, and from our own\n\nLive to our selves, though in this vast recess,\n\nFree, and to none accountable, preferring [ 255 ]\n\nHard liberty before the easie yoke\n\nOf servile Pomp. Our greatness will appeer\n\nThen most conspicuous, when great things of small,\n\nUseful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse\n\nWe can create, and in what place so e’re [ 260 ]\n\nThrive under evil, and work ease out of pain\n\nThrough labour and indurance. This deep world\n\nOf darkness do we dread? How oft amidst\n\nThick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire\n\nChoose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d, [ 265 ]\n\nAnd with the Majesty of darkness round\n\nCovers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar\n\nMust’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?\n\nAs he our darkness, cannot we his Light\n\nImitate when we please? This Desart soile [ 270 ]\n\nWants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;\n\nNor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise\n\nMagnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?\n\nOur torments also may in length of time\n\nBecome our Elements, these piercing Fires [ 275 ]\n\nAs soft as now severe, our temper chang’d\n\nInto their temper; which must needs remove\n\nThe sensible of pain. All things invite\n\nTo peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State\n\nOf order, how in safety best we may [ 280 ]\n\nCompose our present evils, with regard\n\nOf what we are and were, dismissing quite\n\nAll thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise.\n\nHe scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld\n\nTh’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain [ 285 ]\n\nThe sound of blustring winds, which all night long\n\nHad rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull\n\nSea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance\n\nOr Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay\n\nAfter the Tempest: Such applause was heard [ 290 ]\n\nAs Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas’d,\n\nAdvising peace: for such another Field\n\nThey dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear\n\nOf Thunder and the Sword of Michael\n\nWrought still within them; and no less desire [ 295 ]\n\nTo found this nether Empire, which might rise\n\nBy pollicy, and long process of time,\n\nIn emulation opposite to Heav’n.\n\nWhich when Beelzebub perceiv’d, then whom,\n\nSatan except, none higher sat, with grave [ 300 ]\n\nAspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d\n\nA Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven\n\nDeliberation sat and public care;\n\nAnd Princely counsel in his face yet shon,\n\nMajestic though in ruin: sage he stood [ 305 ]\n\nWith Atlantean shoulders fit to bear\n\nThe weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look\n\nDrew audience and attention still as Night\n\nOr Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.\n\nThrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n [ 310 ]\n\nEthereal Vertues; or these Titles now\n\nMust we renounce, and changing stile be call’d\n\nPrinces of Hell? for so the popular vote\n\nInclines, here to continue, and build up here\n\nA growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, [ 315 ]\n\nAnd know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d\n\nThis place our dungeon, not our safe retreat\n\nBeyond his Potent arm, to live exempt\n\nFrom Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League\n\nBanded against his Throne, but to remaine [ 320 ]\n\nIn strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d,\n\nUnder th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d\n\nHis captive multitude: For he, be sure\n\nIn heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign\n\nSole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part [ 325 ]\n\nBy our revolt, but over Hell extend\n\nHis Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule\n\nUs here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n.\n\nWhat sit we then projecting peace and Warr?\n\nWarr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss [ 330 ]\n\nIrreparable; tearms of peace yet none\n\nVoutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n\n\nTo us enslav’d, but custody severe,\n\nAnd stripes, and arbitrary punishment\n\nInflicted? and what peace can we return, [ 335 ]\n\nBut to our power hostility and hate,\n\nUntam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow,\n\nYet ever plotting how the Conqueror least\n\nMay reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce\n\nIn doing what we most in suffering feel? [ 340 ]\n\nNor will occasion want, nor shall we need\n\nWith dangerous expedition to invade\n\nHeav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,\n\nOr ambush from the Deep. What if we find\n\nSome easier enterprize? There is a place [ 345 ]\n\n(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n\n\nErr not) another World, the happy seat\n\nOf some new Race call’d Man, about this time\n\nTo be created like to us, though less\n\nIn power and excellence, but favour’d more [ 350 ]\n\nOf him who rules above; so was his will\n\nPronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,\n\nThat shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.\n\nThither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn\n\nWhat creatures there inhabit, of what mould, [ 355 ]\n\nOr substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,\n\nAnd where thir weakness, how attempted best,\n\nBy force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,\n\nAnd Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure\n\nIn his own strength, this place may lye expos’d [ 360 ]\n\nThe utmost border of his Kingdom, left\n\nTo their defence who hold it: here perhaps\n\nSom advantagious act may be achiev’d\n\nBy sudden onset, either with Hell fire\n\nTo waste his whole Creation, or possess [ 365 ]\n\nAll as our own, and drive as we were driven,\n\nThe punie habitants, or if not drive,\n\nSeduce them to our Party, that thir God\n\nMay prove thir foe, and with repenting hand\n\nAbolish his own works. This would surpass [ 370 ]\n\nCommon revenge, and interrupt his joy\n\nIn our Confusion, and our Joy upraise\n\nIn his disturbance; when his darling Sons\n\nHurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse\n\nThir frail Original, and faded bliss, [ 375 ]\n\nFaded so soon. Advise if this be worth\n\nAttempting, or to sit in darkness here\n\nHatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub\n\nPleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d\n\nBy Satan, and in part propos’d: for whence, [ 380 ]\n\nBut from the Author of all ill could Spring\n\nSo deep a malice, to confound the race\n\nOf mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell\n\nTo mingle and involve, done all to spite\n\nThe great Creatour? But thir spite still serves [ 385 ]\n\nHis glory to augment. The bold design\n\nPleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy\n\nSparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent\n\nThey vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.\n\nWell have ye judg’d, well ended long debate, [ 390 ]\n\nSynod of Gods, and like to what ye are,\n\nGreat things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep\n\nWill once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,\n\nNeerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view\n\nOf those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms [ 395 ]\n\nAnd opportune excursion we may chance\n\nRe-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone\n\nDwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light\n\nSecure, and at the brightning Orient beam\n\nPurge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, [ 400 ]\n\nTo heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires\n\nShall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send\n\nIn search of this new world, whom shall we find\n\nSufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet\n\nThe dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss [ 405 ]\n\nAnd through the palpable obscure find out\n\nHis uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight\n\nUpborn with indefatigable wings\n\nOver the vast abrupt, ere he arrive\n\nThe happy Ile; what strength, what art can then [ 410 ]\n\nSuffice, or what evasion bear him safe\n\nThrough the strict Senteries and Stations thick\n\nOf Angels watching round? Here he had need\n\nAll circumspection, and we now no less\n\nChoice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, [ 415 ]\n\nThe weight of all and our last hope relies.\n\nThis said, he sat; and expectation held\n\nHis look suspence, awaiting who appeer’d\n\nTo second, or oppose, or undertake\n\nThe perilous attempt; but all sat mute, [ 420 ]\n\nPondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each\n\nIn others count’nance read his own dismay\n\nAstonisht: none among the choice and prime\n\nOf those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found\n\nSo hardie as to proffer or accept [ 425 ]\n\nAlone the dreadful voyage; till at last\n\nSatan, whom now transcendent glory rais’d\n\nAbove his fellows, with Monarchal pride\n\nConscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.\n\nO Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones, [ 430 ]\n\nWith reason hath deep silence and demurr\n\nSeis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way\n\nAnd hard, that out of Hell leads up to light;\n\nOur prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,\n\nOutrageous to devour, immures us round [ 435 ]\n\nNinefold, and gates of burning Adamant\n\nBarr’d over us prohibit all egress.\n\nThese past, if any pass, the void profound\n\nOf unessential Night receives him next\n\nWide gaping, and with utter loss of being [ 440 ]\n\nThreatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.\n\nIf thence he scape into whatever world,\n\nOr unknown Region, what remains him less\n\nThen unknown dangers and as hard escape.\n\nBut I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, [ 445 ]\n\nAnd this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d\n\nWith splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d\n\nAnd judg’d of public moment, in the shape\n\nOf difficulty or danger could deterr\n\nMee from attempting. Wherefore do I assume [ 450 ]\n\nThese Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,\n\nRefusing to accept as great a share\n\nOf hazard as of honour, due alike\n\nTo him who Reigns, and so much to him due\n\nOf hazard more, as he above the rest [ 455 ]\n\nHigh honourd sits? Go therefore mighty Powers,\n\nTerror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,\n\nWhile here shall be our home, what best may ease\n\nThe present misery, and render Hell\n\nMore tollerable; if there be cure or charm [ 460 ]\n\nTo respite or deceive, or slack the pain\n\nOf this ill Mansion: intermit no watch\n\nAgainst a wakeful Foe, while I abroad\n\nThrough all the Coasts of dark destruction seek\n\nDeliverance for us all: this enterprize [ 465 ]\n\nNone shall partake with me. Thus saying rose\n\nThe Monarch, and prevented all reply,\n\nPrudent, least from his resolution rais’d\n\nOthers among the chief might offer now\n\n(Certain to be refus’d) what erst they fear’d; [ 470 ]\n\nAnd so refus’d might in opinion stand\n\nHis Rivals, winning cheap the high repute\n\nWhich he through hazard huge must earn. But they\n\nDreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice\n\nForbidding; and at once with him they rose; [ 475 ]\n\nThir rising all at once was as the sound\n\nOf Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend\n\nWith awful reverence prone; and as a God\n\nExtoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:\n\nNor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d, [ 480 ]\n\nThat for the general safety he despis’d\n\nHis own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d\n\nLoose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast\n\nThir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,\n\nOr clos ambition varnisht o’re with zeal. [ 485 ]\n\nThus they thir doubtful consultations dark\n\nEnded rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:\n\nAs when from mountain tops the dusky clouds\n\nAscending, while the North wind sleeps, O’respread\n\nHeav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element [ 490 ]\n\nScowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;\n\nIf chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet\n\nExtend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,\n\nThe birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds\n\nAttest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. [ 495 ]\n\nO shame to men! Devil with Devil damn’d\n\nFirm concord holds, men onely disagree\n\nOf Creatures rational, though under hope\n\nOf heavenly Grace; and God proclaiming peace,\n\nYet live in hatred, enmity, and strife [ 500 ]\n\nAmong themselves, and levie cruel warres,\n\nWasting the Earth, each other to destroy:\n\nAs if (which might induce us to accord)\n\nMan had not hellish foes anow besides,\n\nThat day and night for his destruction waite. [ 505 ]\n\nThe Stygian Counsel thus dissolv’d; and forth\n\nIn order came the grand infernal Peers:\n\nMidst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd\n\nAlone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less\n\nThan Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, [ 510 ]\n\nAnd God-like imitated State; him round\n\nA Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d\n\nWith bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.\n\nThen of thir Session ended they bid cry\n\nWith Trumpets regal sound the great result: [ 515 ]\n\nToward the four winds four speedy Cherubim\n\nPut to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie\n\nBy Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss\n\nHeard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell\n\nWith deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim. [ 520 ]\n\nThence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d\n\nBy false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers\n\nDisband, and wandring, each his several way\n\nPursues, as inclination or sad choice\n\nLeads him perplext, where he may likeliest find [ 525 ]\n\nTruce to his restless thoughts, and entertain\n\nThe irksom hours, till his great Chief return.\n\nPart on the Plain, or in the Air sublime\n\nUpon the wing, or in swift Race contend,\n\nAs at th’ Olympian Games or Pythian fields; [ 530 ]\n\nPart curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal\n\nWith rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.\n\nAs when to warn proud Cities warr appears\n\nWag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush\n\nTo Battel in the Clouds, before each Van [ 535 ]\n\nPrick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears\n\nTill thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms\n\nFrom either end of Heav’n the welkin burns.\n\nOthers with vast Typhœan rage more fell\n\nRend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air [ 540 ]\n\nIn whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.\n\nAs when Alcides from Oechalia Crown’d\n\nWith conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore\n\nThrough pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines,\n\nAnd Lichas from the top of Oeta threw [ 545 ]\n\nInto th’ Euboic Sea. Others more milde,\n\nRetreated in a silent valley, sing\n\nWith notes Angelical to many a Harp\n\nThir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall\n\nBy doom of Battel; and complain that Fate [ 550 ]\n\nFree Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.\n\nThir Song was partial, but the harmony\n\n(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)\n\nSuspended Hell, and took with ravishment\n\nThe thronging audience. In discourse more sweet [ 555 ]\n\n(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)\n\nOthers apart sat on a Hill retir’d,\n\nIn thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high\n\nOf Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate,\n\nFixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, [ 560 ]\n\nAnd found no end, in wandring mazes lost.\n\nOf good and evil much they argu’d then,\n\nOf happiness and final misery,\n\nPassion and Apathie, and glory and shame,\n\nVain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: [ 565 ]\n\nYet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm\n\nPain for a while or anguish, and excite\n\nFallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest\n\nWith stubborn patience as with triple steel.\n\nAnother part in Squadrons and gross Bands, [ 570 ]\n\nOn bold adventure to discover wide\n\nThat dismal world, if any Clime perhaps\n\nMight yield them easier habitation, bend\n\nFour ways thir flying March, along the Banks\n\nOf four infernal Rivers that disgorge [ 575 ]\n\nInto the burning Lake thir baleful streams;\n\nAbhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate,\n\nSad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;\n\nCocytus, nam’d of lamentation loud\n\nHeard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton [ 580 ]\n\nWhose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.\n\nFarr off from these a slow and silent stream,\n\nLethe the River of Oblivion roules\n\nHer watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,\n\nForthwith his former state and being forgets, [ 585 ]\n\nForgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.\n\nBeyond this flood a frozen Continent\n\nLies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms\n\nOf Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land\n\nThaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems [ 590 ]\n\nOf ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,\n\nA gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog\n\nBetwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,\n\nWhere Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air\n\nBurns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire. [ 595 ]\n\nThither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d,\n\nAt certain revolutions all the damn’d\n\nAre brought: and feel by turns the bitter change\n\nOf fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,\n\nFrom Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice [ 600 ]\n\nThir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine\n\nImmovable, infixt, and frozen round,\n\nPeriods of time, thence hurried back to fire.\n\nThey ferry over this Lethean Sound\n\nBoth to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, [ 605 ]\n\nAnd wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach\n\nThe tempting stream, with one small drop to loose\n\nIn sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,\n\nAll in one moment, and so neer the brink;\n\nBut fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt [ 610 ]\n\nMedusa with Gorgonian terror guards\n\nThe Ford, and of it self the water flies\n\nAll taste of living wight, as once it fled\n\nThe lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on\n\nIn confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands [ 615 ]\n\nWith shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast\n\nView’d first thir lamentable lot, and found\n\nNo rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile\n\nThey pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,\n\nO’er many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, [ 620 ]\n\nRocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,\n\nA Universe of death, which God by curse\n\nCreated evil, for evil only good,\n\nWhere all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,\n\nPerverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, [ 625 ]\n\nAbominable, inutterable, and worse\n\nThen Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,\n\nGorgons and Hydra’s, and Chimera’s dire.\n\nMean while the Adversary of God and Man,\n\nSatan with thoughts inflam’d of highest design, [ 630 ]\n\nPuts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell\n\nExplores his solitary flight; som times\n\nHe scours the right hand coast, som times the left,\n\nNow shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares\n\nUp to the fiery Concave touring high. [ 635 ]\n\nAs when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d\n\nHangs in the Clouds, by Æquinoctial Winds\n\nClose sailing from Bengala, or the Iles\n\nOf Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring\n\nThir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood [ 640 ]\n\nThrough the wide Ethiopian to the Cape\n\nPly stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem’d\n\nFarr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer\n\nHell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,\n\nAnd thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, [ 645 ]\n\nThree Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,\n\nImpenetrable, impal’d with circling fire,\n\nYet unconsum’d. Before the Gates there sat\n\nOn either side a formidable shape;\n\nThe one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair, [ 650 ]\n\nBut ended foul in many a scaly fould\n\nVoluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d\n\nWith mortal sting: about her middle round\n\nA cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d\n\nWith wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung [ 655 ]\n\nA hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,\n\nIf aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb,\n\nAnd kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d\n\nWithin unseen. Farr less abhorrd than these\n\nVex’d Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts [ 660 ]\n\nCalabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:\n\nNor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d\n\nIn secret, riding through the Air she comes\n\nLur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance\n\nWith Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon [ 665 ]\n\nEclipses at thir charms. The other shape,\n\nIf shape it might be call’d that shape had none\n\nDistinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,\n\nOr substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,\n\nFor each seem’d either; black it stood as Night, [ 670 ]\n\nFierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,\n\nAnd shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head\n\nThe likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.\n\nSatan was now at hand, and from his seat\n\nThe Monster moving onward came as fast [ 675 ]\n\nWith horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.\n\nTh’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,\n\nAdmir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except,\n\nCreated thing naught valu’d he nor shun’d\n\nAnd with disdainful look thus first began. [ 680 ]\n\nWhence and what art thou, execrable shape,\n\nThat dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance\n\nThy miscreated Front athwart my way\n\nTo yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,\n\nThat be assured, without leave askt of thee: [ 685 ]\n\nRetire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,\n\nHell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav’n.\n\nTo whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d,\n\nArt thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,\n\nWho first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then [ 690 ]\n\nUnbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms\n\nDrew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons\n\nConjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou\n\nAnd they outcast from God, are here condemn’d\n\nTo waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? [ 695 ]\n\nAnd reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,\n\nHell-doom’d, and breath’st defiance here and scorn\n\nWhere I reign King, and to enrage thee more,\n\nThy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,\n\nFalse fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, [ 700 ]\n\nLeast with a whip of Scorpions I pursue\n\nThy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart\n\nStrange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.\n\nSo spake the grieslie terror, and in shape,\n\nSo speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold [ 705 ]\n\nMore dreadful and deform: on th’ other side\n\nIncenst with indignation Satan stood\n\nUnterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,\n\nThat fires the length of Ophiucus huge\n\nIn th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair [ 710 ]\n\nShakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head\n\nLevel’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands\n\nNo second stroke intend, and such a frown\n\nEach cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds\n\nWith Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on [ 715 ]\n\nOver the Caspian, then stand front to front\n\nHov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow\n\nTo join thir dark Encounter in mid air:\n\nSo frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell\n\nGrew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; [ 720 ]\n\nFor never but once more was either like\n\nTo meet so great a foe: and now great deeds\n\nHad been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,\n\nHad not the Snakie Sorceress that sat\n\nFast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, [ 725 ]\n\nRis’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.\n\nO Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,\n\nAgainst thy only Son? What fury O Son,\n\nPossesses thee to bend that mortal Dart\n\nAgainst thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom; [ 730 ]\n\nFor him who sits above and laughs the while\n\nAt thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute\n\nWhat e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,\n\nHis wrath which one day will destroy ye both.\n\nShe spake, and at her words the hellish Pest [ 735 ]\n\nForbore, then these to her Satan return’d:\n\nSo strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange\n\nThou interposest, that my sudden hand\n\nPrevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds\n\nWhat it intends; till first I know of thee, [ 740 ]\n\nWhat thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why\n\nIn this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st\n\nMe Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son?\n\nI know thee not, nor ever saw till now\n\nSight more detestable then him and thee. [ 745 ]\n\nT’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;\n\nHast thou forgot me then, and do I seem\n\nNow in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair\n\nIn Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight\n\nOf all the Seraphim with thee combin’d [ 750 ]\n\nIn bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,\n\nAll on a sudden miserable pain\n\nSurprisd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm\n\nIn darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast\n\nThrew forth, till on the left side op’ning wide, [ 755 ]\n\nLikest to thee in shape and count’nance bright,\n\nThen shining Heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d\n\nOut of thy head I sprung; amazement seis’d\n\nAll th’ Host of Heav’n back they recoild affraid\n\nAt first, and call’d me Sin, and for a Sign [ 760 ]\n\nPortentous held me; but familiar grown,\n\nI pleas’d, and with attractive graces won\n\nThe most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft\n\nThy self in me thy perfect image viewing\n\nBecam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st [ 765 ]\n\nWith me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d\n\nA growing burden. Mean while Warr arose,\n\nAnd fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind\n\n(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe\n\nCleer Victory, to our part loss and rout [ 770 ]\n\nThrough all the Empyrean: down they fell\n\nDriv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down\n\nInto this Deep, and in the general fall\n\nI also; at which time this powerful Key\n\nInto my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep [ 755 ]\n\nThese Gates for ever shut, which none can pass\n\nWithout my op’ning. Pensive here I sat\n\nAlone, but long I sat not, till my womb\n\nPregnant by thee, and now excessive grown\n\nProdigious motion felt and rueful throes. [ 780 ]\n\nAt last this odious offspring whom thou seest\n\nThine own begotten, breaking violent way\n\nTore through my entrails, that with fear and pain\n\nDistorted, all my nether shape thus grew\n\nTransform’d: but he my inbred enemie [ 785 ]\n\nForth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart\n\nMade to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out Death;\n\nHell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d\n\nFrom all her Caves, and back resounded Death.\n\nI fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems, [ 790 ]\n\nInflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far,\n\nMee overtook his mother all dismaid,\n\nAnd in embraces forcible and foule\n\nIngendring with me, of that rape begot\n\nThese yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry [ 795 ]\n\nSurround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d\n\nAnd hourly born, with sorrow infinite\n\nTo me, for when they list into the womb\n\nThat bred them they return, and howle and gnaw\n\nMy Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth [ 800 ]\n\nA fresh with conscious terrours vex me round,\n\nThat rest or intermission none I find.\n\nBefore mine eyes in opposition sits\n\nGrim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on,\n\nAnd me his Parent would full soon devour [ 805 ]\n\nFor want of other prey, but that he knows\n\nHis end with mine involvd; and knows that I\n\nShould prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,\n\nWhenever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.\n\nBut thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun [ 810 ]\n\nHis deadly arrow; neither vainly hope\n\nTo be invulnerable in those bright Arms,\n\nThough temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,\n\nSave he who reigns above, none can resist.\n\nShe finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore [ 815 ]\n\nSoon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.\n\nDear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,\n\nAnd my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge\n\nOf dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys\n\nThen sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change [ 820 ]\n\nBefalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know\n\nI come no enemie, but to set free\n\nFrom out this dark and dismal house of pain,\n\nBoth him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host\n\nOf Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d [ 825 ]\n\nFell with us from on high: from them I go\n\nThis uncouth errand sole, and one for all\n\nMyself expose, with lonely steps to tread\n\nTh’ unfounded deep, and through the void immense\n\nTo search with wandring quest a place foretold [ 830 ]\n\nShould be, and, by concurring signs, ere now\n\nCreated vast and round, a place of bliss\n\nIn the Purlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t\n\nA race of upstart Creatures, to supply\n\nPerhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d, [ 835 ]\n\nLeast Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude\n\nMight hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught\n\nThen this more secret now design’d, I haste\n\nTo know, and this once known, shall soon return,\n\nAnd bring ye to the place where Thou and Death [ 840 ]\n\nShall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen\n\nWing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d\n\nWith odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d\n\nImmeasurably, all things shall be your prey.\n\nHe ceas’d, for both seem’d highly pleasd, and Death [ 845 ]\n\nGrinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear\n\nHis famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe\n\nDestin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d\n\nHis mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.\n\nThe key of this infernal Pit by due, [ 850 ]\n\nAnd by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King\n\nI keep, by him forbidden to unlock\n\nThese Adamantine Gates; against all force\n\nDeath ready stands to interpose his dart,\n\nFearless to be o’rmatcht by living might. [ 855 ]\n\nBut what ow I to his commands above\n\nWho hates me, and hath hither thrust me down\n\nInto this gloom of Tartarus profound,\n\nTo sit in hateful Office here confin’d,\n\nInhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born, [ 860 ]\n\nHere in perpetual agonie and pain,\n\nWith terrors and with clamors compasst round\n\nOf mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:\n\nThou art my Father, thou my Author, thou\n\nMy being gav’st me; whom should I obey [ 865 ]\n\nBut thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon\n\nTo that new world of light and bliss, among\n\nThe Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign\n\nAt thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems\n\nThy daughter and thy darling, without end. [ 870 ]\n\nThus saying, from her side the fatal Key,\n\nSad instrument of all our woe, she took;\n\nAnd towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,\n\nForthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,\n\nWhich but her self not all the Stygian powers [ 875 ]\n\nCould once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns\n\nTh’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar\n\nOf massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease\n\nUnfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie\n\nWith impetuous recoile and jarring sound [ 880 ]\n\nTh’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate\n\nHarsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook\n\nOf Erebus. She op’nd, but to shut\n\nExcel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood,\n\nThat with extended wings a Bannerd Host [ 885 ]\n\nUnder spread Ensigns marching might pass through\n\nWith Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;\n\nSo wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth\n\nCast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.\n\nBefore thir eyes in sudden view appear [ 890 ]\n\nThe secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark\n\nIllimitable Ocean without bound,\n\nWithout dimension, where length, breadth, & highth,\n\nAnd time and place are lost; where eldest Night\n\nAnd Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold [ 895 ]\n\nEternal Anarchie, amidst the noise\n\nOf endless Warrs, and by confusion stand.\n\nFor hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce\n\nStrive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring\n\nThir embryon Atoms; they around the flag [ 900 ]\n\nOf each his faction, in thir several Clanns,\n\nLight-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,\n\nSwarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands\n\nOf Barca or Cyrene’s torrid soil,\n\nLevied to side with warring Winds, and poise [ 905 ]\n\nThir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere,\n\nHee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits,\n\nAnd by decision more imbroiles the fray\n\nBy which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter\n\nChance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, [ 910 ]\n\nThe Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,\n\nOf neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,\n\nBut all these in thir pregnant causes mixt\n\nConfus’dly, and which thus must ever fight,\n\nUnless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain [ 915 ]\n\nHis dark materials to create more Worlds,\n\nInto this wild Abyss the warie fiend\n\nStood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while,\n\nPondering his Voyage: for no narrow frith\n\nHe had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal’d [ 920 ]\n\nWith noises loud and ruinous (to compare\n\nGreat things with small) then when Bellona storms,\n\nWith all her battering Engines bent to rase\n\nSom Capital City; or less then if this frame\n\nOf Heav’n were falling, and these Elements [ 925 ]\n\nIn mutinie had from her Axle torn\n\nThe stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes\n\nHe spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak\n\nUplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League\n\nAs in a cloudy Chair ascending rides [ 930 ]\n\nAudacious, but that seat soon failing, meets\n\nA vast vacuitie: all unawares\n\nFluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops\n\nTen thousand fadom deep, and to this hour\n\nDown had been falling, had not by ill chance [ 935 ]\n\nThe strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud\n\nInstinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him\n\nAs many miles aloft: that furie stay’d,\n\nQuencht in a Boggy Syrtis, neither Sea,\n\nNor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, [ 940 ]\n\nTreading the crude consistence, half on foot,\n\nHalf flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.\n\nAs when a Gryfon through the Wilderness\n\nWith winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,\n\nPursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth [ 945 ]\n\nHad from his wakeful custody purloind\n\nThe guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend\n\nOre bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,\n\nWith head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,\n\nAnd swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: [ 950 ]\n\nAt length a universal hubbub wilde\n\nOf stunning sounds and voices all confus’d\n\nBorne through the hollow dark assaults his eare\n\nWith loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,\n\nUndaunted to meet there what ever power [ 955 ]\n\nOr Spirit of the nethermost Abyss\n\nMight in that noise reside, of whom to ask\n\nWhich way the neerest coast of darkness lyes\n\nBordering on light; when strait behold the Throne\n\nOf Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread [ 960 ]\n\nWide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d\n\nSat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,\n\nThe Consort of his Reign; and by them stood\n\nOrcus and Ades, and the dreaded name\n\nOf Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, [ 965 ]\n\nAnd Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,\n\nAnd Discord with a thousand various mouths.\n\nT’ whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers\n\nAnd Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,\n\nChaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, [ 970 ]\n\nWith purpose to explore or to disturb\n\nThe secrets of your Realm, but by constraint\n\nWandring this darksome Desart, as my way\n\nLies through your spacious Empire up to light,\n\nAlone, and without guide, half lost, I seek [ 975 ]\n\nWhat readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds\n\nConfine with Heav’n; or if som other place\n\nFrom your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King\n\nPossesses lately, thither to arrive\n\nI travel this profound, direct my course; [ 980 ]\n\nDirected no mean recompence it brings\n\nTo your behoof, if I that Region lost,\n\nAll usurpation thence expell’d, reduce\n\nTo her original darkness and your sway\n\n(Which is my present journey) and once more [ 985 ]\n\nErect the Standard there of ancient Night;\n\nYours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.\n\nThus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old\n\nWith faultring speech and visage incompos’d\n\nAnswer’d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, [ 990 ]\n\nThat mighty leading Angel, who of late\n\nMade head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown.\n\nI saw and heard, for such a numerous Host\n\nFled not in silence through the frighted deep\n\nWith ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, [ 995 ]\n\nConfusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates\n\nPourd out by millions her victorious Bands\n\nPursuing. I upon my Frontieres here\n\nKeep residence; if all I can will serve,\n\nThat little which is left so to defend [ 1000 ]\n\nEncroacht on still through our intestine broiles\n\nWeakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell\n\nYour dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;\n\nNow lately Heaven and Earth, another World\n\nHung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain [ 1005 ]\n\nTo that side Heav’n from whence your Legions fell:\n\nIf that way be your walk, you have not farr;\n\nSo much the neerer danger; go and speed;\n\nHavock and spoil and ruin are my gain.\n\nHe ceas’d; and Satan staid not to reply, [ 1010 ]\n\nBut glad that now his Sea should find a shore,\n\nWith fresh alacritie and force renew’d\n\nSprings upward like a Pyramid of fire\n\nInto the wilde expanse, and through the shock\n\nOf fighting Elements, on all sides round [ 1015 ]\n\nEnviron’d wins his way; harder beset\n\nAnd more endanger’d, then when Argo pass’d\n\nThrough Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks:\n\nOr when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd\n\nCharybdis, and by th’ other whirlpool steard. [ 1020 ]\n\nSo he with difficulty and labour hard\n\nMov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee;\n\nBut hee once past, soon after when man fell,\n\nStrange alteration! Sin and Death amain\n\nFollowing his track, such was the will of Heav’n, [ 1025 ]\n\nPav’d after him a broad and beat’n way\n\nOver the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf\n\nTamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length\n\nFrom Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe\n\nOf this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse [ 1030 ]\n\nWith easie intercourse pass to and fro\n\nTo tempt or punish mortals, except whom\n\nGod and good Angels guard by special grace.\n\nBut now at last the sacred influence\n\nOf light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n [ 1035 ]\n\nShoots farr into the bosom of dim Night\n\nA glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins\n\nHer fardest verge, and Chaos to retire\n\nAs from her outmost works a brok’n foe\n\nWith tumult less and with less hostile din, [ 1040 ]\n\nThat Satan with less toil, and now with ease\n\nWafts on the calmer wave by dubious light\n\nAnd like a weather-beaten Vessel holds\n\nGladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;\n\nOr in the emptier waste, resembling Air, [ 1045 ]\n\nWeighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold\n\nFarr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide\n\nIn circuit, undetermind square or round,\n\nWith Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d\n\nOf living Saphire, once his native Seat; [ 1050 ]\n\nAnd fast by hanging in a golden Chain\n\nThis pendant world, in bigness as a Starr\n\nOf smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.\n\nThither full fraught with mischievous revenge,\n\nAccurst, and in a cursed hour he hies. [ 1055 ]\n\nBOOK 3\n\nTHE ARGUMENT\n\nGod sitting on his Throne sees Satan flying towards this world, then newly created; shews him to the Son who sat at his right hand; foretells the success of Satan in perverting mankind; clears his own Justice and Wisdom from all imputation, having created Man free and able enough to have withstood his Tempter; yet declares his purpose of grace towards him, in regard he fell not of his own malice, as did Satan, but by him seduc’t. The Son of God renders praises to his Father for the manifestation of his gracious purpose towards Man; but God again declares, that Grace cannot be extended towards Man without the satisfaction of divine justice; Man hath offended the majesty of God by aspiring to God-head, and therefore with all his Progeny devoted to death must dye, unless some one can be found sufficient to answer for his offence, and undergo his Punishment. The Son of God freely offers himself a Ransome for Man: the Father accepts him, ordains his incarnation, pronounces his exaltation above all Names in Heaven and Earth; commands all the Angels to adore him; they obey, and hymning to thir Harps in full Quire, celebrate the Father and the Son. Mean while Satan alights upon the bare Convex of this Worlds outermost Orb; where wandring he first finds a place since call’d The Lymbo of Vanity; what persons and things fly up thither; thence comes to the Gate of Heaven, describ’d ascending by staires, and the waters above the Firmament that flow about it: His passage thence to the Orb of the Sun; he finds there Uriel the Regent of that Orb, but first changes himself into the shape of a meaner Angel; and pretending a zealous desire to behold the new Creation and Man whom God had plac’t here, inquires of him the place of his habitation, and is directed; alights first on Mount Niphates.\n\nHAil holy light, ofspring of Heav’n first-born,\n\nOr of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam\n\nMay I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,\n\nAnd never but in unapproached light\n\nDwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, [ 5 ]\n\nBright effluence of bright essence increate.\n\nOr hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,\n\nWhose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,\n\nBefore the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice\n\nOf God, as with a Mantle didst invest [ 10 ]\n\nThe rising world of waters dark and deep,\n\nWon from the void and formless infinite.\n\nThee I re-visit now with bolder wing,\n\nEscap’t the Stygian Pool, though long detain’d\n\nIn that obscure sojourn, while in my flight [ 15 ]\n\nThrough utter and through middle darkness borne\n\nWith other notes then to th’ Orphean Lyre\n\nI sung of Chaos and Eternal Night,\n\nTaught by the heav’nly Muse to venture down\n\nThe dark descent, and up to reascend, [ 20 ]\n\nThough hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,\n\nAnd feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou\n\nRevisit’st not these eyes, that rowle in vain\n\nTo find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;\n\nSo thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, [ 25 ]\n\nOr dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more\n\nCease I to wander where the Muses haunt\n\nCleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,\n\nSmit with the love of sacred Song; but chief\n\nThee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath [ 30 ]\n\nThat wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,\n\nNightly I visit: nor somtimes forget\n\nThose other two equal’d with me in Fate,\n\nSo were I equal’d with them in renown,\n\nBlind Thamyris and blind Mæonides, [ 35 ]\n\nAnd Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old.\n\nThen feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move\n\nHarmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird\n\nSings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid\n\nTunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year [ 40 ]\n\nSeasons return, but not to me returns\n\nDay, or the sweet approach of Ev’n or Morn,\n\nOr sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,\n\nOr flocks, or heards, or human face divine;\n\nBut cloud in stead, and ever-during dark [ 45 ]\n\nSurrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men\n\nCut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair\n\nPresented with a Universal blanc\n\nOf Nature’s works to mee expung’d and ras’d,\n\nAnd wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. [ 50 ]\n\nSo much the rather thou Celestial light\n\nShine inward, and the mind through all her powers\n\nIrradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence\n\nPurge and disperse, that I may see and tell\n\nOf things invisible to mortal sight. [ 55 ]\n\nNow had the Almighty Father from above,\n\nFrom the pure Empyrean where he sits\n\nHigh Thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye,\n\nHis own works and their works at once to view:\n\nAbout him all the Sanctities of Heaven [ 60 ]\n\nStood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv’d\n\nBeatitude past utterance; on his right\n\nThe radiant image of his Glory sat,\n\nHis onely Son; On Earth he first beheld\n\nOur two first Parents, yet the onely two [ 65 ]\n\nOf mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t,\n\nReaping immortal fruits of joy and love,\n\nUninterrupted joy, unrivald love\n\nIn blissful solitude; he then survey’d\n\nHell and the Gulf between, and Satan there [ 70 ]\n\nCoasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night\n\nIn the dun Air sublime, and ready now\n\nTo stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet\n\nOn the bare outside of this World, that seem’d\n\nFirm land imbosom’d without Firmament, [ 75 ]\n\nUncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.\n\nHim God beholding from his prospect high,\n\nWherein past, present, future he beholds,\n\nThus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.\n\nOnely begotten Son, seest thou what rage [ 80 ]\n\nTransports our adversarie, whom no bounds\n\nPrescrib’d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains\n\nHeapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss\n\nWide interrupt can hold; so bent he seem"
