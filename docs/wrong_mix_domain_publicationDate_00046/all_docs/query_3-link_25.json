        "text": "The audiobook for Flames of Stone (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 3) is now available for preorder!\n\nSome select reader reviews to entice the soul:\n\n“For fans of the Arinthian Line and Fury of a Rising Dragon, the third installment of Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone delivers on questions that have spanned across multiple series.”\n\n“… the Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone doesn’t feel like a prequel and can stand alone as someone’s first introduction to Sever Bronny’s work.”\n\n“Wonderful continuation of the series that sets up Arcane while still leaving enough untold to allow Mrs. Stone to feel mysterious and private when introduced despite knowing so much of her life from this book. Finished reading it in three days because I couldn’t put it down”\n\n“These books like the others are so incredibly well thought out to even the tiny details that pop up books later. I would really recommend any of the books by this author although I’d rather say read them all. Probably one of the most profound worlds I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading again and again.”\n\n“A powerful conclusion to a series that reignites my love of learning”\n\n“Strap in for an emotional ride”\n\n“All i can say is that i am grateful to have read this masterpiece”\n\nThe launch is April 30th! You can snag Flames of Stone here.\n\nTwo big pieces of news to share, including something amazing a fan has done.\n\nNews item #1: The trio’s long-awaited return—with a twist.\n\nThe Arinthian Line and Fury of a Rising Dragon have earned some serious fans. That’s why I’m thrilled to announce that I am writing a whole new saga of Augum, Bridget and Leera’s adventures—except I’m doing it from each of their points of view!\n\nThat’s right, you’re going to read what it’s like to be a water warlock through Leera’s eyes, and an earth warlock through Bridget’s. Above all, you’re going to experience three people struggling with the power to summon the dragon.\n\nThe first of the series will launch in December. I’m applying everything I learned writing and finishing Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone—and let me tell you, I am having a total blast writing it.\n\nNews item #2: A fan’s dedication\n\nThis is just awesome. A fan from Seattle named David has tattooed a certain motto from the Fury of a Rising Dragon series on his forearm. Isn’t that just amazing?\n\nHere’s a quiz: do you recognize the motto, and what it means? Post your answer in the comments\n\nAll the best,\n\n–Sever Bronny\n\nInternationally bestselling author of:\n\nThe Arinthian Line series\n\nFury of a Rising Dragon series\n\nChronicles of Anna Atticus Stone series\n\nI am honored and excited to announce that Flames of Stone (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 3) has launched! The paperback is live, and the audiobook is coming April 30th 2024.\n\nIt’s hard to express the feeling of getting this book out there, as it’s been a long road. I am proud of the three years of work it took to get here. Thank you so much for your amazing letters and support.\n\n-Sever\n\nP.S. The ebook for Prodigy of Thunder, the first book in the saga, is on sale for only $0.99 until December 14th. If you know someone who you think might enjoy the trilogy, consider sending them the link. Thank you\n\nP.P.S. For those wanting to support my work on social media, I place at your disposal the media kit to Flames of Stone (especially check out the cool animated GIF). Consider posting the image featuring the entire trilogy. (I do my own social media and am not very good at it, so your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.)\n\nThings are progressing nicely with Anna Atticus Stone’s third book. Super exciting to write her during a critical period in her life, when she’s forty-nine years old, has just been offered the job of Headmistress of the Academy of Arcane Arts, juggles an unruly teenage daughter with little motivation and a big secret, a distant husband, and villains chasing after her scion—all while solving old mysteries that just might lead her to an ancient place. Book title announcement coming soon.\n\nOnce Anna’s third book is out, I plan on delving back into the trio: Augum, Bridget and Leera. I have grand (epic!) plans for their next escapade, and have missed writing them greatly. But in the meantime, writing Anna is a privilege, a challenge, and a true joy.\n\nSome more book news: for those into audiobooks, Prodigy of Thunder (Anna’s first adventure) is on sale on Audible until Mar 16th.\n\nHope you have been well,\n\nSever\n\nP.S. Advance Reader Team is open once again, with limited slots available.\n\nI’m thrilled to announce that The Arcane Artist (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 2) is finally out! You can snag it here. Get ready for new spells, new lands, and a whole new side to Anna you have never seen before.\n\nAlso, Prodigy of Thunder (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 1) will be on sale in the USA and Uk for 99 cents for one week. And as always, ALL my work is available for Kindle Unlimited subscribers.\n\nThank you to everyone for your amazing support over the years. This is my eleventh(!) book, which boggles my mind. Yet my career as an author could not have been possible without you. So, yeah, thank you ;)\n\nWarlock Anna Atticus Stone is on her final year at the academy. As head of student council, academic prodigy, and champion arena dueler, she seems the perfect pupil.\n\nIn reality, Anna is grieving, overwhelmed, and so lonely she talks to herself. Above all, she fears assassination if people find out her father’s dying gift to her was a scion. Only seven of these powerful artifacts exist, one in each kingdom—a precarious balance that maintains peace.\n\nThat peace shatters when a kingdom steals a second scion and invades its weaker neighbor. Anna feels compelled to act, but that would mean facing her crippling fears, a quest into the unforgiving wilds, and risking her kingdom becoming a target of war.\n\nDriven by the memory of her father, she must find the one thing eluding her thus far . . . courage.\n\nC O M I N G D E C E M B E R 2\n\nPREORDER HERE\n\nThe paperback should be available on release day.\n\nThe audiobook is scheduled to launch April 11th, 2023. The preorder for it will be available any day now.\n\nI can’t wait for you to experience Anna’s epic new adventure!\n\n—Sever\n\nP.S. The Advance Reader Team will receive a separate email imminently\n\nA family of warlocks . . . torn by an ancient secret.\n\nFourteen-year-old Anna Atticus Stone is a prodigy.\n\nA warlock prodigy.\n\nThe youngest to ever wield lightning, Anna burns with ambition, dreaming of attending the prestigious Academy of Arcane Arts.\n\nBut her life’s a mess.\n\nShe’s friendless, her father barely lets her out of the house, and her older sister keeps knocking her teeth out.\n\nAnd her parents fight. Constantly. Mostly over her father illegally training the sisters in the old way, as it’s forbidden to learn so far ahead.\n\nNow Anna readies to take the academy entrance trials. A pass will mean friends, warlock tournaments, and exploring a thousand-year-old academy. Typical teenage warlock stuff.\n\nExcept her sister is bent on sabotaging her. And there’s a reason for that sabotage—and for the illegal training . . . their father carries a dangerous secret.\n\nA secret for only one daughter.\n\nAnd Anna is about to find out what her sister is willing to do to claim it.\n\nPersonal thoughts from the author:\n\nThe day has finally come! After a long year of writing and editing Anna’s story, Prodigy of Thunder has launched. I cannot wait for you to experience the beginning of her journey. You have been requesting her story ever since reading about her in Arcane (The Arinthian Line, book 1). It gives me great honor to deliver on that request.\n\nIt was a tricky endeavor for me to write a book about an already established character. For that challenge, I searched deep into who Anna was whilst asking myself what sorts of things would she have gone through as a child and as a teenager. Writing the answers into the book was immensely enjoyable for me, even though Anna went through serious trials.\n\nAnna’s strengths come from her independence, her compassion, and her ambition. But she has always suffered from loneliness too. This story partly aims to explain why and how that loneliness took root. I find her to be a complicated soul with an epic story, one I look forward to fleshing out in subsequent books.\n\nNote that both the paperback and ebook versions have a map and Anna’s full academy class schedule. Also, I hope you’ll consider sharing the launch on social media (or even sharing my Facebook post about it).\n\nThank you all for your amazing support over the years, and feel free to email me your thoughts when you’re done reading.\n\nEnjoy the book!\n\nAll my best to you and those you love,\n\n-Sever\n\nP.S. Extra special thanks to the ART team, as well as the wonderful souls who participate on this website. You know who you are :)\n\nI cannot tell you how excited I am to finally reveal the name of the book about Anna Atticus Stone’s origin story. In Prodigy of Thunder (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 1), I explore Anna’s tumultuous relationship with her family, a family slowly destroyed by an ancient secret. There will be adventure, exploration of the Academy of Arcane Arts’s Shoptown, and plenty of arcanery. Above all, you will get to know Anna.\n\nAnd she is ambitious and brave and reckless and kind and empathic and brilliant.\n\nI’m on schedule to launch early December. Further, I’d like to proudly announce I signed a three-book audiobook deal with Podium. The book is currently in the casting phase, and you will not have to wait long for it to launch (three months or so?).\n\nHope you’ve been well,\n\nSever\n\nP.S. Anyone will be able to read this saga, even if they have not read The Arinthian Line or Fury of a Rising Dragon, making it safe to give as a holiday gift."
