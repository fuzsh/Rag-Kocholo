Click on the name at the top of the page to take you to the section or just scroll down the page.\n\nINTERZONE issue 214 Feb 2008 by\n\nINTERZONE isnât the magazine it was when it started. It seems to have lost all of the literary pretensions and is now going for a younger market. It isnât trying too hard to do so. Thereâs a Christopher Priest story that shows some signs of the old literary qualities. Thereâs a film review column that is either the worst of its kind Iâve ever seen or deliberately trying to alienate anyone who hasnât spent a lifetime reading fantasy novels/comics. I would say that this is a magazine written for its subscribers that doesnât really care about anyone else.\n\nThe best part of the magazine is the fiction. All of the stories are fairly good although the Christopher Priest and the Award Winner arenât really up to the rest.\n\nThereâs an interview with Iain Banks thatâs just the usual âIâve got a new book outâ plug. There are pictures that seem to be backgrounds or characters from the stories. Some look like theyâd be good in colour but arenât so good in black and white. None of them are anything special. There are book/DVD reviews and an old copy (December?) of Ansible.\n\nSo what does this magazine really need? It needs to sell the stories. They are its strong point and all that they give on the contents page is author and title.\n\nThe image presented with the story doesnât really say anything about whatâs in it.\n\nThey really need to put in a teaser for each and action rather than character/background pictures. If theyâre not going to go for colour on the inner pages, they should probably consider line drawings for illustration.\n\nIf they want to attract a younger market, they should try harder on the media product. Thereâs no media news and the reviews are of product that has closed in the cinema or has just reached DVD. It should be possible to get interviews with relevant personalities if only by phone or email questionnaire. If they want to run a film review column they have to get reviews of films that wonât hit the cinema until after the magazine is on the shelves. It should be possible to get some idea of what is coming to UK TV and â in some cases â review from internet versions.\n\nReviewed by William McCabe Mar-2008\n\nReturn to top\n\n(film review)\n\nBIG FISH\n\n(dir:Tim Burton) starring Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Albert Finney, Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nI had been feeling a bit let down by my favourite director. Burton had last been seen producing the rather scarily formulaic re-make of PLANET OF THE APES (which I still think was an OK film if you donât consider who directed it, and worryingly bad if you do). So I needed to come and see something to reconfirm my feelings, and I was not let down.\n\nBIG FISH bears rather a resemblance to SECONDHAND LIONS, as in old man tells tales (true or false) about his childhood, and it is up to the other characters (and audience) to work out if he is telling porkies. Another film this bears a strong resemblance to, with its flashbacks and strong tongue-in-cheek atmosphere, is PRINCESS BRIDE. Though in that latter film, the ârealâ story interlapping the tale is not so strongly drawn - here Burton brings in the right amount of pathos to make the present-day stuff worth watching too, though nothing can beat the ta ll tales (or is it the truth) that Albert Finney tells of.\n\nBasically it is about a father who after a long life is dying, though we are never told what of exactly. His son, after years of feeling resentful, decides to try to get to know his father, who has always seemed to hide away behind tales of magic and witches and big fish, tales that while wonderful in the telling, the straightforward son just cannot accept as truth. Thus through the fatherâs stories, we too have to decide for ourselves what is true and what isnât.\n\nThis is a clever film. The stories are such th at, even if partly fabricated, you can see what might be the truth behind them. And th ey are never too far-fetched to believe, they just might be true. I was slightly disappointed by the ending, as it seemed to give rather too many answers - it would have been nice to be kept partly guessing. And as it is the obligatory happy ending, it is almost too slushy. But let this not detract - it is a heart-wanning, inspiring story, and Burton is back on form. Great performances from the leads - although the two main actors are so well known at tunes it is hard to be able to imagine one as the younger version of the otherâ¦ Still despite its few and far between disadvantages this rates as one of the best films I have seen for the past few months.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Apr-2004\n\nReturn to top\n\nDISTRICT 9\n\nAn interesting film that is about a race of aliens who appear over South Africa and get forced to live in slum-like conditions. Many years later the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population. The person in charge of this, Wikus van der Merwe is then exposed to a strange alien chemical. The film is gritty and realistic, and none of the actors particularly famous, which makes a refreshing change.\n\nI remember the advertising being comprehensive for this film â posters all over the place, such as on phone boxes, and a rather good trailer, thus leading to quite a lot of hype. I expected a bigger budget film but this has been done on a relative âshoestringâ compared to most modern movies. The aliens are very realistic and believable with no bad CGI in sight. It starts off being shot as a documentary-style film then becomes more conventional later as the plot and action picks up. Wikus is a believable pathetic character as he is forced by circumstances to change his view towards the aliens and even come to rely on them.\n\nBe warned, this is a gritty film which doesnât shy away from violence, but it is nonetheless a very good film which leaves a strong impression in terms of the way it is filmed and the strong themes present throughout. Recommended.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Stock Jun-2010\n\nReturn to top\n\nFORBIDDEN PLANET: 50TH ANNIVERSARY TWO DISC SPECIAL EDITION\n\nSometimes in life you see bargains and pass them by, later regretting your error, and sometimes there are bargains that you just *cannot* pass by and you go for. Seeing the DVD of the 1956 classic FORBIDDEN PLANET - one of my alltime favourite SF movies (there are only a handful of SF movies worth watching once let alone twice) - advertised on Amazon for the ridiculously low price of Â£3.97 post free was such a time. The 50th Anniversary two disc version with extras including âlostâ scenes cut from the released version! How could I resist? My VHS tape was looking very grainy and faded so a couple of clicks later I sat back, having ordered it and looked forward to sitting down in a few days time to rewatch a great movie though I puzzled somewhat over what was going to fill 2 discs.\n\nThe disc duly arrived 3 or 4 days later and I sat down about midnight with a bottle of Shiraz looking forward to enjoying the movie once more. Ah! Problem! Which disc has the movie and which one has the extras? Well, letâs just start with one of them. A black and white clip started off the disc â excerpts from THE INVISIBLE BOY, a movie made a year or so after FORBIDDEN PLANET that Iâd heard of because theyâd used Robbie the Robot in it. Oh, well, worth watching the bits with Robbie in it I supposeâ¦. But, no, it was the complete movie based on a story by Edmund Cooper!!!. I hadnât switched it off in disgust so it couldnât have been that bad. To be perfectly honest, there were a few excruciatingly embarrassing bits. Next up was something called âWatch the Skiesâ which turned out to be a TCM Special on SF movies featuring George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron to name just three, talking about SF movies â surprisingly very sensibly!. A fascinating documentary that lasted an hour. Oops, still more âextrasâ but it was now nearly 3am and time for sleep. And I still hadnât seen FORBIDDEN PLANET!\n\nEvening two, Shiraz 2 and disc 2 â good old Will Shakespeareâs only SF movie! Well, no, he didnât actually write it â Irving Block and Allen Adler wrote the story but Will sometimes gets unwarranted credit for it despite the fact that he didnât even know what a robot was.\n\nAlthough the sound was mono, it is now remastered into 5.1 Dolby Digital and the picture was 2.40 widescreen â almost the way it was shown in cinemas (originally 2.55). Superb picture and how glad I was to throw out my VHS tape! One slight disappointment â the version originally shown in cinemas was 98 minutes long according to Imdb â this DVD is 94 minutes. Whatâs missing?\n\nMy third session at this DVD revealed a complete episode from the TV series THE THIN MAN. This episode, âRobot Clientâ from February 1958 also features our old friend Robbie the Robot but plotwise it was transparent and the whole thing was very dated. But it was nice to see it. Other extras were THE MGM PARADE TV series, âExploring the Far Reaches of FORBIDDEN PLANETâ plus several cinema trailers of THE TIME MCHINE and other SF movies of the 50s. And donât forget the âlostâ scenes and extra footage!\n\nAll this for Â£3.97????? Go buy!!!\n\nReviewed by Rog Peyton Jun-2010\n\nReturn to top\n\nHANCOCK\n\ndirected by Peter Berg, starring Will Smith, Charleze Theron, Jason Bateman.\n\nThis is an anti-superhero movie. From the start we see Hancock is a heavy-drinking, supremely strong layabout who doesnât apparently care who he hurts or what he damages when chasing bad guys. A world away from cleanshaven, pants over trousers superheroes though, like them, he can fly, lift trains and all the other superhero stunts you would expect. The plot thickens though as he saves a businessman from impending danger, and soon his life is taken onboard by this guy who is determined to change his image and lifeâ¦ Hancock then meets his wife and son and his life is soon to be changed completelyâ¦.\n\nThe first and second halves of the film are rather different in tone as Hancock discovers and reveals more about himself and his background, and whether he is the only one of his kind. There are plenty of action set-pieces in amongst the introspection. Thereâs no real bad guy, just a few rather stereotypical villains who I found were a bit too two-dimensional. Smith does a great job as Hancock though â at least in the early part of the film - he is vastly different to the joking, comic characters we see in his other films. Theron as the wife is ok, but doesnât have a lot to do to begin with, and I found her rather bland.\n\nBateman is the only other actor with a lot to do as the businessman who takes a strong interest in Hancockâs image and he does a good job, being believable even as his own life irreparably changes.\n\nCGI are prominent in this film (they do love tearing up famous American cities these daysâ¦) and there are some nice darkly humorous scenes. Pacing is good and the film not too long for the plot. Worth a watch.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Oct-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (2005) directed by Garth Jennings\n\nThis is, of course, the film version of the popular Douglas Adams books of the â70âs, brought a little more up to date and with just a little bit of poetic licence. It keeps the musical themes so memorable from the radio and TV series, keeps the quirky humour of the characters and set-pieces, and is quite an enjoyable journey. Arthur Dentâs ordinary life is thrown into disarray when first developers appear to tear down his house and secondly his best friend Ford appears to be an alien warning of impending doom. They escape and meet many colourful characters, including the incomparable President of the Universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Arthur goes on a quest to find himself and true love, as well as the âmeaning of lifeâ.\n\nMartin Freeman plays Arthur well. He is a bit younger than I had imagined Arthur â in slightly trendier pyjamas and not so much of a stereotypical Brit â hopeless and nerdy. The love triangle between Trillian, Arthur and Zaphod is padded out a bit more in this version. I was not sure about this - it worked ok but at times seemed about to turn the film into a bit of a romantic slush and probably wonât appeal to traditionalists. It also meant Zaphod was in effect reduced to a jealous love rival. Sam Beckett plays Zaphod well enough â zany and over the top, but I remember him being a stronger, more adventurous character in the books. The two heads were a bit odd, more like two faces so there was no interaction between them, and the fake one looked incredibly bad. I was also not too happy with Ford Prefect â he is thoroughly modernised in his look and behaviour here, and he becomes a bit hopeless and not as outgoing or with all that much to do. I enjoyed his carefree style from previously, and felt he was just not as strong a character here. There are lots of famous voices and cameos in this who are all rather amusing â the choice of Stephen Fry in particular to add his velvet tones to the narrator was inspired, and his part helps along those not so familiar with the premise.\n\nVisually, I found the film excellent. The scene-changing mechanisms are good, the effects and characters work together well and make this overall an enjoyable film. There is a good sense of the magic that made the books and series so popular. Things do date over time so some might say that the modernising was necessary, for instance using so much CGI. I am a bit of a traditionalist myself in some things, but I can understand that, in these days of LORD OF THE RINGS/ Harry Potter, HGTTG had a lot to do to keep up within the genre.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Mar-2006\n\nReturn to top\n\nI AM LEGEND\n\n(dir: Francis Lawrence) Starring Will Smith and Alice Braga This is the third adaptation from the 1954 Richard Matheson novel. This one stars Will Smith as Robert Neville, a scientist left alone when a disease-destroying drug turns every other person on the planet into crazed monsters. With an aversion to UV light, they hide away by day and come out at nightfall. The film follows his actions by day with the whole city to himself and follows his emotional journey as he faces loneliness, depression and internal as well as external demons. He also strives to discover a cure for the virus, using lab rats and later a captive. This leads the Alpha male of the other beings to seek him out, leading to a final stand-off.\n\nThe film leaves out much which made the book so memorable and different to the norm, which to my mind is a real shame. Matheson explored the idea of two types of âinfectedâ â depending whether they lived or died - and the former being more human and less âcrazedâ are able to communicate and develop. It is a shame the film never delves into this idea. The âI Am Legendâ which refers to the scientist being a sort of âbogeymanâ himself to the more developed âinfectedâ is changed utterly. Smith is âlegendâ due to his inexplicable immunity to the virus, which is airborne as well as through contact. The film, like the book, introduces a female protagonist but without giving too much away, she is dealt with completely differently here.\n\nOverall though, I enjoyed the film. The latter part of the film, as the action picked up, did not affect me but I was really struck by the depiction of the main character in the middle of this world-changing event. He was not just a macho tough guy blasting zombies - you could really feel for him. Iâd say purists of the book might not like the omissions and changes, and unfortunately some people did not like the film because it was too slow, but I, not usually a fan of this sort of film, appreciated the more thought-provoking aspects and that the monsters were not just plain zombies but evolved into a sort of semi-vampire, semi-monster. CGI being what it is nowadays, they were surprisingly less gruesome than I expected. Worth watching. In order to compare, weâve just ordered THE OMEGA MAN and LAST MAN ON EARTH (the two other film versions of this book) to watch too.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Feb-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nI, ROBOT (dir: Alex Proyas)\n\nThis was much better. I had heard various grumbles about this film nicking the three laws of robotics and the title of one of Asimov's books and not a lot else, but when I came to watch it, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThere is the decidedly techno-phobic hero with a little secret of his own.\n\nThere is the huge TERMINATOR-style cybernetics firm which wants to produce one robot per household, with the prim and proper female scientist who you just know is going to end up helping the hero out. And then the robots rebelâ¦\n\nSome scenes ended up looking suspiciously like TERMINATOR, as robots clambered effortlessly up buildings and chased vehicles. There are lots of big booms and action scenes, but amidst all this, there are some morals to be told too.\n\nRobbie (sorry, Sonny) the Robot just wants to understand the human way of things, and the three laws are frequently called upon, as everyone struggles to understand how they can be apparently broken. The climax is well done and resolved, leading to an ultimate satisfaction with the film. Hit of the summer, definitely!\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Sep-2004\n\nReturn to top\n\nIRON MAN\n\ndirected by Jon Favreau Starring Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow. Tony Stark is the heir to a weapons manufacturing dynasty. Handsome, suave, charming, he captures the public imagination and adds glamour to the industry. He enjoys his fame and lavish lifestyle. However on a promotional trip to Afghanistan, he is captured by enemy soldiers after suffering near-fatal injuries, who fix him up but in such a way that his life will never be the same againâ¦ The story takes a while to get going to the Iron Man bits â there is quite a slow build up before the action scenes get going. I found the film overall a little long and with too many storylines for one film â it seems to feature the story of him escaping from enemy hands, then launches into another plotline featuring enemies closer to home. It doesnât take a genius to work out the bad guys either but then comic book stories can be predictable â that can be part of their appeal.\n\nHowever, Robert Downey Jr. is great in the lead role, in one of his first major roles for a few years. Gwyneth Paltrow is also good if not given a tremendous amount to do as his loyal assistant, Ms Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges steals scenes as the partner in his business. There is a good amount of humour as well â the themes in the film are quite dark and the comedy therefore quite black, but it was kept light by, for instance, the banter between Stark and his assistant. The CGI is also good â it backs up the real armour suit made for the film, rather than replacing everything, which adds a good amount of realism and looks more impressive. I also felt emotionally for the characters â they had real feelings and seemed like real people. This was impressive for a film made from a comic book â Spider-man went along the same vein, trying to make the audience emote with the characters, and this is a factor I liked in both these films.\n\nInterestingly, Marvel made this film themselves rather than farming their characters out to other studios. Despite the over-long plotline and the rather slow build-up, I think theyâve done a good job and would recommend the film.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Apr-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nLeague of Gentlemen: Apocalypse (2005) directed by Steve Bendelack\n\nThe three series of this television comedy show, League of Gentlemen, have been a huge hit, and inevitably of course, the makers turned their thoughts to a film adaptation. With popular TV shows this sometimes works, sometimes falls flat on its face. LOG; APOCALYPSE is surprisingly quite successful. The novel plot of the characters taking their makers hostage is a plus point as their world starts to fall apart once the creators have turned their attention to other worlds, in this case a historical romp. Things gradually disintegrate into a war between characters from the relevant shows as the creators try to make sense of what is going on and resolve things.\n\nThe film has more of a constant structure than the TV series, which worked as a series of sketches, albeit with ongoing storylines, and the film also is at times darker, even more serious than its TV counterpart. The TV series did grow darker in tone as it progressed so this could be seen as a natural progression.\n\nWhat was surprising to me was that they didnât depend on the popular wellknown characters, such as Tubbs etc. The stars here are the not so well-known Geoff Tipps, Herr Lipp and Hilary Briss Still, they are âbrought to lifeâ and their characters developed to good effect, which I appreciated â there are even quite poignant moments in the film such as Herr Lipp coming to terms with himself.\n\nAs I have found in later days of the TV series though, it is hard to distinguish whether it is comedy or horror, which means laughing feels uncomfortable!\n\nThe common problem of appealing to fans and non-fans is evident here.\n\nThere are plenty of references for the film fan to pick up on, such as THE SHINING, etc. While many films tend to put these references in, to get a cheap laugh for instance, it is done with considerably more style here and didnât feel too cheesy. The film also does what plenty of others have done before - used lots of cameo appearances from various TV stars. These things would appeal to nonfans of the series, thus presumably widening the appeal of the film.\n\nOverall then, as a fan I enjoyed it, but found it getting too dark to be laugh-out-loud. I am not sure a non-fan would enjoy it, though if they enjoy a film with lots of cameos and film-references, there will be no problem. I would recommend they try the TV series first to get a sense of the premise.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Mar-2006\n\nReturn to top\n\nPlanet of the Apes quintet (â68-75-ish) - Franklin J. Schaffner etc\n\nThis is a classic series of films â every one has elements to be recommended in it, and none is a complete dud.\n\nThe first in the series is the original film, PLANET OF THE APES, in which Taylor (Charlton Heston) lands on a planet and gradually starts to realize that things are not all as they seem, with apes in charge and humans subordinate.\n\nThis is far superior to the modern version which came out a couple of years ago, if only for the greater emotions shown in this older film (wonder, anger, awe, all shown by Heston to great effect). The scene at the end is one of the most famous movie sequences in history, but watching it for the first time in its proper context means it lost none of its intended power.\n\nThe next film is BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES following on from the first film as the underground survivors fight back against the apes.\n\nThings start to become more sinister now. A good film but I did not enjoy it as much as a couple of the others.\n\nESCAPE FROMâ¦ tells the tale of how the apes started their path to power as they travel back in time to when humans were the superior race, while CONQUEST OFâ¦ carries on this story as the apes (taking over from cats and dogs as pets) fight back against their masters. Intellectual and exciting, but again this was one of the weaker ones. I just got a bit bogged down by all the dark subject matter â not much light-heartedness here.\n\nEverything gets more aggressive still in BATTLE FORâ¦ where the apes battle each other as well.\n\nIt was interesting, in ESCAPE FROMâ¦, to see the apes as the protagonists and the ones who capture the audienceâs affections, which is rather different to the two films preceding. The constant excellent imagery in the films appealed to me. For instance in the second film, BENEATHâ¦, the mutant humans are dwelling in the ruins of New York City which becomes slowly apparent to the watcher as well as the characters. The third film introduces the idea of a circular time line, where the apes Cornelius and Zira go back in time to set the stage for the ape conquest of Earth. By the end of the fifth film we have got back to how things were at the start of the first film - apes in charge, humans defeated.\n\nUsing the same actor Roddy MacDowell, as Cornelius and then Caesar his son, who leads the ape rebellion, lends a continuity effect to the series. He does a terrific job in the series, keeping the audienceâs sympathies although he is destroying their race. I watched this series over a short space of time as I was interested in how the story develops, and I would definitely recommend it. The first is the famous one but they all have interesting elements.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Nov-2006\n\nReturn to top\n\nSPIDERMAN 2 (dir: Sam Raimi)\n\nThis follows the same sort of lines as the first one - Peter Parker is still beset by personal teenage-style problems as he fights various nasty criminals as his alter ego. Meanwhile this time the villain of the piece is one Doctor Octopus, i.e. a scientist whose disastrous attempt at a scientific breakthrough leaves him welded to four powerful steel arms. Also cropping up is the son of the Green Goblin, who is out for revenge for the death of his father.\n\nAll in all, however, I was mildly disappointed. While the action scenes are very well done, with the effects of Spidey swinging across the city far more believable than before, the scenes where he is trying to woo, and then not woo, Mary-Jane are far too long and drawn-out, and just detract from the rest of the film. The more interesting bad guy really has very little screen time in comparison, indeed he disappears from much of the middle section. Granted his story isn't all that long anyway, but maybe they could have had another bad guy, like the Green Goblin #2 to liven things up?\n\nWorth catching if a fan, but if not, beware as this may put you off any more in the series.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Sep-2004\n\nReturn to top\n\nSTAR TREK\n\nHaving grown up with the Star Trek franchise and various films, thereâs always a little sense of excitement, rather like with a new Bond film, when they release another movie, and this looked to be a real refresh of the franchise.\n\nIt features the beginning of the story of the characters from the original Star Trek series - Kirk, Spock, Bones et al - how they met and ended up doing what they do. The film kicks off with the birth of Kirk set against the demise of his father, and then shows him entering Starfleet twenty years later and being known as a trouble maker. At this point he is under Spockâs command, and they are not on friendly terms, but as disaster strikes on Vulcan the film starts pulling itself together, with the help of a familiar face from the future.\n\nThe plotline was ok. Iâve read a few reports about gaping plot holes here, bad science there, but this *is* Star Trek, so who expects anything to be perfectly explained? What I liked about this film is the reimagining of the characters. I felt the young actors who played the famous roles (especially Chris Pine as Kirk, and Zachary Quinto as Spock) were outstanding. The movieâs visuals and CGI effects were well done, which was to be expected considering the rather huge budget â a big step away from the effects used for the original series (it does look odd when the SF bits look more futuristic in their younger years than when they are established). Abrams, the director, had a tough job on his hands having to please the hardcore fans, general public and the studio, but I think he has done well here with what is a watchable, even appealing film with well-drawn characters and good performances from the young actors, and plenty of visuals and action scenes to be getting along with.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Stock Jun-2010\n\nReturn to top\n\nSTAR WRECK: IN THE PIRKINNING (IMPERIAL EDITION)\n\nSome of you who were at this year's Eastercon might well have seen this already, or at least seen the rather spectacular poster. If not â well, there are good reasons why you might well seek this out. This is a Star Trek spoof, started by two guys in a back bedroom somewhere in Finland. The first STAR WRECK was a home-made computer animation in the style of SOUTH PARK. It was posted on the Internet, and attracted enough attention to inspire the makers to repeat the exercise. By the time they reached this film, the sixth in the series, they had gathered enough support to make a live-action professional film, with CGI effects that are the equal of almost anything you have seen on television â and possibly on the cinema screen too.\n\nThe plot is a mad version of Trek's âmirror universeâ plot strand. Marooned in early 21st-century Finland, Captain Pirk, his loyal Plingon officer Commander Dwarf and his android companion Commander Info, force Russian scientists, anxious to rebuild the Soviet Union, into building a replacement space fleet with which to re-invent their future.\n\nYes, you read those names right. In an effort to avoid legal copyright complications, all the characters and some of the plot devices have been renamed with some of the stupidest alternative names you can think of.\n\nBut that is the real marvel of this film. Forget the names; look at the visuals. They are as good, and as inventive, as anything that Paramount has given us. Indeed, some of them look suspiciously as if they themselves were copied for the most recent Star Trek film: the building of the USS Enterprise â sorry, CPP Kickstart â and the âmaggot holeâ anomaly appears almost unchanged in the ârealâ Star Trek. There are few signs that this is an amateur production: the producers only built two main sets for the spaceship interiors, plus some generic corridors. The rest is filmed location work, clever CGI using stock footage, and even a short sequence of fake black-and-white newsreel which is delightful.\n\nIn the course of the film, Pirk and his crew invade an alternative universe which itself is a parody of Babylon 5; this takes longer than it ought to as the action has to stop at regular intervals for the station commander to make a pretentious speech. Watch out for the truth behind the mystery of the Vorlons!\n\nThis is no GALAXY QUEST. Sophisticated comedy it is not. The Finns are revealed in this film to have a similar sense of humour to the Germans; rather literal and unsophisticated, yet at the same time having a good sense of wordplay â though it loses quite a bit in the translation and some of the subtitles are less than grammatically perfect English. The visual style of comedy is also rather German, in that it owes more than a little to the overcranked style of the late Benny Hill.\n\nThere are some extras, including a Director's Commentary (the language of which is not specified; it'd better not be in Finnish!), a blooper reel, and perhaps the biggest disappointment of the whole package. This is a documentary called TOWARDS THE IRON SKY, and it consists of a series of interviews with the production team, and others, talking about their next production, IRON SKY. Unfortunately, that's all they do â talk about it, in considerable detail. This 30-minute (or possibly 45-minute) documentary was filmed, for some reason, in an anechoic chamber; and believe me, 30 minutes of talking Finnish heads can easily seem like 45 minutes. Or longer. Much longer.\n\nWhich is a shame, because IRON SKY will be well worth seeing.\n\nThe strapline for IRON SKY is: âIn 1945, the Nazis fled to the Moon. In 2018, they're coming back.â The producers took a show-reel to Cannes in 2007; they remade it completely, using professional studio facilities and full-scale bluescreen techniques with live actors, to take back to Cannes in 2008 in their search for funding. The overall style is rather like Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW â sepia retro technology â but this is is extended to Albert Speer's GERMANIA ON THE MOON, complete with subsurface flying saucer hangars.\n\nIRON SKY is in production now, with release dates variously quoted as 2010 or in the first quarter of 2011. But unless you research this on the Internet (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Sky or the official site, www.ironsky.net), you won't see any of it as Revolver Pictures didn't bother to check what extras they were getting when they bought the rights to UK DVD distribution!\n\nThis DVD is now available in limited quantities through the UK retail trade and may well be available from major online retailers; or you can buy online direct from the producers via the address above â though in that case, you will be ordering the original Finnish DVD (with subtitles, fortunately).\n\nIf you can cope with the broad comedy, I can recommend this for the sheer, jawdropping chutzpah of the producers in making this film and punching way above their weight in the effects department. You will come away from this asking yourself âHow have they avoided getting sued?â And they deserve support simply for what they are going to do next.\n\nReviewed by Robert Day Aug-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nSTARDUST\n\nWhen I was younger I loved the film called THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Irreverent, funny, firmly tongue-in-cheek, it was great. I still enjoy it today. STARDUST is along the same lines though maybe not with quite the same stroke of genius.\n\nTristan lives in a village by a wall leading to a fantasy world. He ventures through this one day to seek a fallen star for his one true love. Also featuring in the chase for the fallen star are three sons of a dead king, and the leader of a gang of witches hunting for eternal youth. He learns as he goes about his true heritage and what true love is.\n\nThis is one of those films where famous names appear throughout, which for the main part donât distract too much, though it has to be said I didnât think the scenes featuring the comedian Ricky Gervais were completely smooth and plot-relevant, and he did sound rather like his TV alter-egos, but other appearances were brilliant, particularly Robert De Niro, who sent himself up yet again as a pirate. The main actors did a sterling job â Michelle Pfeiffer as the lead witch, covered in make-up, hammed it up delightfully and was a pleasure to watch, as was Charlie Cox, not as famous but able to hold centre stage onscreen admirably. I wasnât so convinced by the two female leads â Sienna Miller as his first love was a little bit too two-dimensional, and I found his second true love, Claire Danes, a little irritating which really probably wasnât meant to be intentional, and not thoroughly convincing.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Apr-2008\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE DAY THE WORLD ENDED\n\nDirected by Terence Gross (2001) Story by Brian King; teleplay by Max Enscoe & Annie deYoung\n\nThis low budget made-for-TV movie tries to combine some of the more traditional ideas of alien invasion/impregnation and telekinesis. Not a particularly well known cast either, apart from Randy Quaid who can be seen in films such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, KINGPIN and even DAYS OF THUNDER, who does a good job as the âspecialâ boyâs father. Not a remake of the 1958 film of the same name but named after it as the boy is seen watching it on video!\n\nIt starts off with a new face moving into a small âlocal townâ - a psychiatric doctor played by Nastassja Kinski who is coming in to work at the local school. One of the first discoveries the new doctor makes is of a boy who doesnât seem to fit in with the rest of the locals. This is the son of the townâs medical doctor. The child shows some sign of having some powers that manifest when he is angry or upset - one of the bullies in the playground develops a nosebleed as he gives them a âlookâ.\n\nAs the film goes on, we learn more about the boyâs past and how his real mother mysteriously disappeared a few years before when he was just four years old. But not before she has managed to convince him that his real father is an alien who will return when he needs him most! This leads him to an unhealthy obsession with alien films and comics. As the boyâs turmoil rises, the alien descends and goes on a bloody killing spree. The film then goes towards a climax, which leads to the question of whether the alien is real or a figment of the boyâs imagination.\n\n9 The film is quite entertaining in parts but lacks real creativity and is full of clichÃ©s. Not a movie to read much into but not too bad if you leave your brain at home.\n\nReviewed by Tim Stock Oct-2003\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE HAPPENING\n\n(dir: M Night Shymalan) Starring Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel THE HAPPENING is the latest offering from M.Night Shymalan and involves a family caught up in the midst of a strange spate of apparent suicides. As the number of casualties grow, we share the main characterâs confusion and growing fear at this event they cannot comprehend, and as they try to work out why it keeps happening. Badly rated on first release, we found it an interesting film. It doesnât easily slot into any particular genre, with elements from science fiction, horror and drama, which may confuse the more mainstream audience.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Feb-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE ILLUSIONIST\n\n(dir: Neil Burger) Starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel.\n\nNow to a completely different film. Starring Edward Norton, THE ILLUSIONIST features a magician who can apparently summon up spirits of the dead, shocking the 19th century populace. The plot thickens when he falls in love with the fiancÃ© of a prince. The film leaves you to consider whether or not these spirits are real. The ending implies not, but the question is never explained fully. Most of the film is from the viewpoint of Inspector Uhl - Paul Giamatti (excellent) as he learns more about the magicianâs tricks and we share his surprise and shock at new developments. Quiet, interesting film leaving you with questions unanswered.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Feb-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE INVASION\n\n(dir: Oliver Hirschbiegel) Starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig THE INVASION is INVASION OF THE BODYSNATCHERS brought up to date. Again we found it was better than critics would suggest; again it was badly panned on first release. It loses some of the older filmâs originality and suspense but is still watchable. Nicole Kidman does a good job as usual and there are suitably poignant scenes as she battles with herself as well as the external aliens. The original film (1956) strongly referenced Communism and it would be hard to attract a modern audience in the same way but the change of method of infection to an alien flu-like virus was, if a bit predictable, a good way to do that.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Feb-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE SWARM\n\nDirected by Irwin Allen (1978) Story by William Herzog\n\nWow, I thought to myself, a Michael Caine movie! Must be good! And look at the other stars in it - Katherine Ross, Richard Chamberlain, Richard Widmark, Olivia DeHavilland, Henry Fonda, Slim Pickens AND Fred McMurray.\n\nIt had to be good! Now I rather enjoy good silly monster movies from time to time (I enjoyed JURASSIC PARK 3, silly but true), so happily settled down to this one while Tim was playing with his alien movies.\n\nThe plot is as follows: Huge swarms of killer bees seem to be randomly gathering and attacking people. When entomologist Brad Crane (Caine) discovers this he has his work cut out trying to stop them reaching Houston, and trying also to stop General Slater (Widmark) from using military tactics against them.\n\nAnd that's it. Not exactly mind-bending stuff. The trouble is, this film just doesnât do the idea justice. The acting is terribly wooden, even from th is batch of stars. The storyline is sloppy (though the idea that the survivors of the stings âseeâ mammoth bees in front of them, is worth a giggle) and the script stilted. It doesnât help that it all looks a bit dated, with the bees shot from afar in swarms and the train scenes especially, appearing incredibly unrealistic and faked. It is hard to warm to the characters, even Michael Caine, who usually injects a reasonable warmth into his characters.\n\nThe trouble is you are never entirely sure what category to put it in - 70âs disaster film, in which case it is a definite failure for reason of just being too silly, or SF monster flick, which it just about gets away with.\n\nAt the end of the day surely a big jar full of boiling water and some jam smeared around the rim would have sufficed. Hard to warm to and a bit of a struggle to believe.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Oct-2003\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE TIME MACHINE (2002 version)\n\nIf you ignore the title, have a couple of drinks first and suspend a lot of disbelief, you will probably enjoy this film. Set around about 1900, it is about a rich American teacher who, after witnessing the murder of his brand new fiancee, contacts his friend Albert Einstein and picks his brain about his forthcoming Theory of Special Relativity. He then commences to build a time machine out of bits of an old lighthouse, so that he can go back in time to save his fiancee.\n\nHe discovers that, unfortunately, the past cannot be materially changed.\n\nHe is unable to rescue his loved one. So he decides to go forward in time to find someone with the answer.\n\nThe film is advertised as being based on the novel by H G Wells. It isnât - itâs lifted from the 1960s film starring Rod Taylor, which WAS based on Wellsâ work. Just as a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy becomes progressively less like the original, so this film has less in common with its namesake. The Time Traveller is there, as is Mr Filby, Mrs Watchett the housekeeper, Weena, the good Eloi and the bad Morlocks; but what, where and how they do tilings are all different from the book. The 1960s film did it much better, keeping more or less to Wellsâ plot although it did add a few things to appeal to the cinema-going public. Unfortunately, itâs these additions that the latest film has expanded at the expense of the original story.\n\nYou could do worse than spend a happy hour or so picking out the bits borrowed from other films and cringing at the occasional piece of PC. And itâs even more fun if youâve both read the book and seen the original film. Just donât expect Wells.\n\nReviewed by Vernon Brown Jul-2002\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE VILLAGE (dir: M Night Shymalan)\n\nThis runs on the same lines as the director's previous efforts. I am a fan so I enjoyed it, but some may find it a bit slow and predictable. Basically it is a bit of a love story among some remote villagers, who live in fear of the mythical creatures living in their backwoods. The film is full of suspense and little jumpy bits, which works well - although it did not live up to the expectation of the mounting tension. The 'twist' wasn't quite as outstanding as I had been expecting.\n\nAnother 'like it or loathe it' film from this talented director.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Sep-2004\n\nReturn to top\n\nTRANSFORMERS\n\ndirected by Michael Bay Starring Shia LaBoeuf, Megan Fox. Now this is a film that far exceeded my expectations! I grew up around the same time as the cartoon series was showing on television, and the first animated film came out during my youth, but I was never completely entrancedâ¦I was not quite sure therefore how I would get on with this filmâ¦ Teenager Sam Whitwicky lives in a remote American town, growing up like any normal lad, but little does he realise that his unreliable car is not quite what it seems. He is drawn into a battle between two extraterrestrial clans over a talisman called the Allspark.\n\nThe excellent cinematography (you can really feel the heat in the desert town they live in, and the scenery is gorgeous), and excellent CGI used to create the immense Transformers combine to create a film worth watching for visual effects alone. The acting is fairly standard (this sort of film is never going to make many demands on an actor, being for the most part full of car chases and CGI battles), and the robots are characterised for the most part well enough that by the end of the film youâve got to know and can distinguish them well.\n\nDonât expect it to be a childrenâs movie â it was far more grown-up than I was expecting. Beware also â it is loud and with various car chases and battles throughout, so donât watch if you are expecting a quiet, thoughtful film! But Iâve watched it twice now and it does grow on you. I think I appreciated the comic timing and the acting from the two leads the most â they stood up well against the CGI and portrayed their characters well, so you could sympathise with them.\n\nTransformers fans may feel a little let down by the storyline â for the sake of the movie theyâve removed a lot of the back-story built up for many years by the Transformer cartoons, and changed some things (one example was that the humans are much more capable of defeating the bad guys than in the original cartoon where they were basically helpless and had to rely on the good guys). But, as a non-devotee of the original, this didnât particularly affect me, and overall I enjoyed it as a good piece of escapism. Films number 2 and 3 are coming out soon, so I may watch to see how they progress the idea further.\n\nReviewed by Vicky Cook Apr-2009\n\nReturn to top\n\nWESTWORLD and FUTUREWORLD (1973/1976) Michael Crichton / Richard T. Heffron\n\nThese films first came to my attention when mentioned in a BSFG meeting about a year ago, so I watched WESTWORLD to see what all the fuss was about. It features a âfuturisticâ amusement park where people can choose to live in Roman World, Westworld or Medieval World, where they live in a kind of virtual reality, surrounded by other characters played by androids. They eat, sleep, fight, etc., as if the world was real. However, as tends to happen with anything involving robots, something goes wrong and the robots start to run amokâ¦ It is clear to see the influences on such films as JURASSIC PARK (another âtheme park gone wrongâ, and by the same author!) and TERMINATOR. The bad guy of the film is a gunslinger robot, played by the excellent Yul Brynner (of MAGNIFICENT SEVEN fame, and famously spoofing his character in that film here), who stalks his victim in a way just like TERMINATOR years later, with fixed gaze and determined walk. The two heroes of the film are interesting in the way they develop â the hopeless naÃ¯ve newcomer (Richard Benjamin) really comes into himself during the course of the film as he learns how to evade the murderous robots.\n\nFUTUREWORLD is set a few years later as the theme park (Delos) reopens to the public. Two reporters (played by Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner) are among the first in, to report on the park. But they find themselves playing detective to uncover the sinister secret plot going on, to work out what exactly is going on behind the scenes at Delos.\n\nThis film suffers slightly from the sequel syndrome â the pacing and tension of the first film are gone â it has changed from a sinister SF movie into more of a detective story. The two leads are fair enough, but the script is not that great, and they always look slightly bemused. Yul Brynner features again, but in a gratuitous cameo, seemingly designed more to appeal to his fans than to feature him in any real sense. Still, I did enjoy the film, it plays on the idea again of âa theme park gone wrongâ, and the sort of theme of a conspiracy featuring a big corporation rears its head too. The idea of shooting and using robots as you wish to, is played on lots too.\n\nThese two films play on the attraction of escapism â you can escape form the real world for a bit, shoot everyone to our hearts content (real people cannot die in this world) and play cowboys and Indians or whatever appeals. The plots are a little loop-holey â it is best to ignore any obvious errors in the thinking behind the theme parks, and let the film carry you along. The suspense at the end of WESTWORLD is brilliant, as the gunslinger stalks his victim, and this is definitely the better overall of the two films. Both heartily recommended. Vicky Cook\n\nReviewed by Nov-2006\n\nReturn to top\n\nBen Aaronovitch\n\nBROKEN HOMES by Ben Aaronovitch\n\nThe fourth volume in the acclaimed Rivers of London series continues the story of PC Peter Grant, apprentice wizard, as he becomes involved in a series of mysterious cases.\n\nA death in an unexplained car crash leads to the discovery of a mutilated body ineptly hidden in nearby woods and there is an apparent suicide on the Underground which may not be as straightforward as it seems. Then the discovery of a stolen eighteenth-century German grimoire is followed by the obviously sorcerous death of the suspected thief. Investigations soon reveal that these cases are probably linked to each other and to the twisted magician known as the Faceless Man who has already played a major adversarial role in the previous books in the series. There is also a connection to a German architect who was responsible for a peculiar municipal housing development in Elephant and Castle which appears to be the focus of attention. Events build to a suitably near- apocalyptic climax with a surprising twist to finish.\n\nOn the way, a number of characters from the previous books show up from time to time, playing parts of greater or lesser importance. Chief amongst these is, of course, the Faceless Man. Although he suffers a serious setback here he is not finished yet and it is becoming confirmed as increasingly obvious that the series can only end with his downfall and the revealing of his identity. So this is very much an episode in an ongoing opus and the occasional references to people and incidents from previous episodes limit slightly the extent to which it can be viewed as a standalone story.\n\nWhether deliberately or not, the writing style seems to have changed since the beginning of the series. Although the somewhat light-hearted turn of phrase, particularly when referring to police procedure, still remains, the overall style is less jokey as though a more serious style is intended to reflect the more serious turn which events are beginning to take. Be that as it may, it remains a readable and immensely entertaining book with a complex yet tidily constructed plot and no loose ends â well, perhaps one. Or even two.\n\nOf course, anyone already familiar with the Rivers of London will need no encouragement to continue following events: others may find here an introduction to the whole series which will attract their attention to the preceding instalments. Michael Jones\n\nReviewed by Sep-2013 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nMOON OVER SOHO by Ben Aaronovitch\n\nThis is the second book of the series that began with RIVERS OF LONDON published in January of this year. Although it's not absolutely necessary to read the first book in the series before you start, it does help a great deal. Many of the characters that have carried over from that book are in situations as a result of that story that aren't explained here. That said, many of the new characters aren't very well developed here either. Taken as a classic police/detective novel with a fantasy twist, this works fairly well but there isn't any more to it.\n\nPhillip Grant is a Detective Constable and apprentice wizard in the Metropolitan Police. He investigates cases that have supernatural causes and deals with incidents among the more magical citizens of London. His father was a famous jazz musician to those aficionados of the Soho scene of the 40s and 50s. He made a few records that are highly prized and hard to find nowadays: so when Philip investigates a series of deaths of jazz musicians that just stepped off stage, he can recognize the tune from the 40s that lingers in the air. The search through the jazz clubs of Soho also reveals a bizarre trade in hybrid people/animals that make Dr. Moreau look wholesome.\n\nThere's a lot that doesn't work properly here.\n\nThe characters that were built in the first book seem to have disappeared into a fog of background or just been left out altogether. Some of this is explained by injuries sustained but they are still trotted out to explain bits of plot or take Grant to somewhere he needs to go to keep the story running. The only attempt at a new character is Simone who seems to be there only to give Grant a sex life and âspice upâ the story in that way. There are many others, including Grant's parents, who seem to wander in and out of the story without really leaving a mark. It could be that these characters will persist and be expanded upon later. There's an evil wizard who, at the moment, is just someone in a mask but looks likely to become a series villain.\n\nThe odd thing is that there were so many functional characters in the first book that it makes this look like someone else wrote it. I hope the series picks up after this but, judging by this entry, I'm not going to count on it.\n\nReviewed by William McCabe Jul-2011 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nRIVERS OF LONDON by Ben Aaronovitch\n\nThis is the first novel of a series of fantasy/detective novels set in present day London. On one hand it has an apparently realistic version of the Metropolitan Police Force with its procedures and politics and on the other there is a view of London that drifts between the surreal and the fantastic. The author manages to pull this off mostly by having as little connection between the recognisable everyday members of the force and the weird stuff as possible.\n\nThis is the story of Peter Grant, a newly promoted Detective Constable, and Chief Inspector Nightingale his new boss. Nightingale is also a wizard. He deals with minor deities and monsters on a regular basis. Here he takes on some of the more surreal aspects of community policing including peace negotiations between Father and Mother Thames over who runs which part of the river. He is also teaching Grant the basics of magic. There are vampires and ghosts to deal with and, of course, since this is a detective novel, there are also a series of bizarre and grisly murders to solve.\n\nIt's not a matter of whodunnit so much as who made them do it and how and why. The answer comes in the form of an easily recognisable and generally unexpected figure.\n\nOn the whole this works. The pace is good enough but the various plot threads are a little too distracting. The river dispute plot doesn't really impact on the murders and vice versa. In such a short novel the central plot and the situation/character building should take up more of the story. It makes me wonder if the writer could manage more novels in this series without the plot becoming too fragmented.\n\nReviewed by William McCabe Jan-2011 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE HANGING TREE by Ben Aaronovitch\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with this popular and wonderfully humorous series, it is an urban fantasy set in London. PC Peter Grant is a serving officer in the Metropolitan Police Force but he is also a trainee wizard, the first in fifty years. He and Inspector Nightingale (his mentor) are expected to deal with any crimes the Met reluctantly accepts may have a âsupernaturalâ element. Some of the magical beings in London are incarnations of the various rivers of London (hence the series title).\n\nIn this book, a suspicious death of a rich young woman in an expensive apartment in Hyde Park would not normally concern PC Grant. However, he owes a favour to Lady Tyburn (one of the more powerful Rivers) and as her daughter was present, Lady Ty wants her daughter protected. As Peter digs further into the case it becomes clear that the death links back to an old enemy, the Faceless Man and Peter is in grave danger as he tries to solve the case.\n\nAfter book 5, which took place in the countryside, this is a welcome return to London where PC Grant (and it seems also the author) is back in his comfort zone. PC Grantâs âvoiceâ â his hilarious and wry observations of the supernatural Londoners and the conventional police who have to grudgingly accept and deal with them is one of the great joys of this series. In particular, the characters of DC Guleed and the long-suffering DCI Seawoll are excellent and amusing. The story rattles along at a fast pace and plot strands from previous novels are brought nicely back into this narrative, so the overall series story arc progresses as well as the individual case in this book. I also like that there are some interesting new characters introduced who are clearly going to be important in the future books and who nicely expand the possibilities for story development.\n\nThe author also has allowed Peter Grant to grow, both personally and magically. He has gained power and experience although he clearly is not strong enough to take down the Faceless Man by himself. That confrontation is clearly intended to ultimately involve his master, Inspector Nightingale. Here however, is the one niggle I had with this book as I definitely felt that the author kept contriving unlikely circumstances just to keep the Faceless Man and Nightingale apart. That being said, for the many fans of this series, this is an excellent addition. If you havenât tried this series before, it is well worth trying. Fans of Jim Butcher or Benedict Jackaâs Alex Verus novels will definitely find much to like.\n\nReviewed by Carol Goodwin Jan-2017 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nWHISPERS UNDERGROUND by Ben Aaronovitch\n\nThe latest instalment in the popular and successful series about police constable and apprentice wizard Peter Grant effectively begins with the discovery of the body of an American student on the platform of Baker Street Underground station. He had apparently been stabbed to death on the tracks somewhere between there and the next station along. And the fact that he is, or was, the son of a US Senator is not going to help matters, with an FBI Agent, sent over to keep an eye on things, who must be kept from discovering any inconvenient truths.\n\nOne thing leads inevitably to another, in this case to the discovery of a secret community living below the streets of London, in and around the tunnels of the Underground and Bazalgetteâs sewers, and employing magic to stay hidden. The crime is solved and the murderer caught: meanwhile, there is a tantalising, brief, but significant contribution from the Big Bad Guy who first showed up in the previous book and will presumably provide a major ongoing story arc in subsequent volumes.\n\nLike the previous books in the series, this one begins on a relatively light-hearted, almost jocular note.\n\nThen, as things start to get serious and events look as though they might spiral out of control, there is less time for jokes although the irreverently humorous style never completely goes away.\n\nThe deployment of magic as an art with a firm scientific foundation is consistent and logical and is almost seamlessly integrated into the more conventional aspects of the murder investigation.\n\nThere is, however, a slight feeling that the overall planning of the story is on occasion somewhat forced. This, coupled with the fact that publication of this book was delayed some six months beyond the date originally announced, suggests that it ended up as a bit of a rush job. Also, it would have benefitted from better proofreading. However, neither of these solecisms need be allowed to detract from the overall success of what is definitely a Good Book and a worthwhile follow-up to the previous two. Further instalments are eagerly awaited.\n\nReviewed by Michael Jones Aug-2012 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top After the predominance of urban fantasy novels set in America, it is good to see a number emerging that use London as their background. Suzanne McLeodâs series about spellcracker Genny Taylor has a London populated with traditional mythical creatures such as dryads, witches and trolls and includes the ubiquitous vampires. Kate Griffin on the other hand looks at a more deep rooted magic with her protagonist Matthew Swift having become the Midnight Mayor and who has the safety of the Cityâs continued existence in his hands.\n\nSwift inhabits a far grittier and violent London underworld than Genny Taylor does. Ben Aaronovitch takes a different approach. His series of novels, which started with THE RIVERS OF LONDON, is more of a police procedural with touches of added magic.\n\nIn WHISPERS UNDERGROUND (the third instalment of the series) the first person narrator, Peter Grant, is still a novice where magic is concerned but he is able to detect when it has been used. Brought up on a sink estate, he joined the police force but now belongs to a small, elite group of specialists brought in when the regular police think magic might be involved. In this case, it is when the corpse of an American art student is found on the platform of Baker Street Station. He has been killed by being stabbed in the back with a piece of pottery that holds a residue of magic. The investigation is complicated by the fact that the father of the dead youth is a US senator and the authorities are worried about a diplomatic incident, especially when an FBI agent turns up. She takes it upon herself to interfere with the investigation, showing no regard for the protocols of the country she is in.\n\nFollowing the tentative line of clues, Grant and his colleagues are led down into the underground network. Not only does this bring Grant closer to solving the crime but teaches him more about the magical substrate that underlies London for although he has a talent for magic, he has to be taught spells and in that respect he is still very much a novice.\n\nThe approach and ambiance of this novel is very different from either McLeodâs or Griffinâs work and as such would probably appeal to a different kind of readership. Like many genre crime novels, this does not become too convoluted but unlike them, Grant, although having issues concerning magic, is not really a maverick loner kicking against authority. It is a good, light read that straddles the crime/fantasy boundary.\n\nReviewed by Pauline Morgan Jan-2013 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nJoe Abercrombie\n\nRED COUNTRY by Joe Abercrombie\n\nRED COUNTRY is the 6th book by Joe Abercrombie that I have read and it confirms in my mind his eminent position as a writer of grungy, dirty, violent but compelling fantasy fiction. It may not be his best when compared with BEST SERVED COLD but is still a very enjoyable read. This tale is set in his Circle of the World universe and is an alternative take on âcowboys and Indiansâ. In it, Shy South returns home from selling her farmâs crops to find her farm burnt down and her young sister and brother stolen.\n\nTogether with her cowardly stepfather, Lamb, she sets off in pursuit. Lamb however is not all he seems, (being a character well known to readers of Abercrombieâs First Law Trilogy) neither is Shy as she has a murky past of her own.\n\nTo facilitate their pursuit across the grasslands to the âFar Countryâ, to where it seems the kidnappers are heading, and for mutual protection from the Ghosts (Indians) they join a âFellowshipâ (wagon train) led by the legendary scout âDab Sweetâ.\n\nThe second major strand of this story follows the misadventures of Nicomo Cosca, the Captain General of the âCompany of the Gracious Handâ a company of so-called mercenaries, an ill disciplined bunch of cowardly parasitic jackals. They are infesting the âNear Countryâ and move onto the âFar Countryâ in the pursuit of rebels on the behalf of the âMidderland Inquisitionâ, and of course any loot that they can pick up along the way.\n\nOther characters of note are: Temple who is a weak, ineffectual but multitalented drunkard refugee from the âCompany of the Gracious Handâ who meets up with Shy on her trek across the grasslands; The Mayor and Papa Ring, the leaders of the gangs who rule âCreaseâ (a place named after a fold in a map) that is the Fellowshipâs destination in the Far country; Cantliss, the dastardly kidnapper; and finally Sergeant Friendly, a compulsory counter and henchman of Nicomo Cosca (first met in BEST SERVED COLD) All these and many more collide violently at Crease with some expected and unexpected outcomes. All is explained by the end of the story. Lurking around the edges of the tale is Caul Shivers, another character from BEST SERVED COLD.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable book well worth reading. I look forward eagerly to Joe Abercrombieâs next novel.\n\nReviewed by Jim Pearce Jan-2013 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nSHARP ENDS by Joe Abercrombie\n\nOne way to get a taste for an alien world, whether it is SF or Fantasy, instead of diving straight into a trilogy is to look for any short stories set against the same background. Often these will appear in magazines or anthologies but when enough have accumulated, the collection will appear. The stories in this collection all belong in the same setting as the World of the First Law and although some familiar characters may pass through these tales, mostly the purpose is to explore other aspects of the society. As such, being unfamiliar with the novels is not a hindrance to enjoying these for what they are, neatly formed, character-led stories. For those who know the trilogy, dates and places precede each so they can be placed within the body of the whole sequence. Although âA Beautiful Bastardâ gives an insight into the background of one of the principal characters of the first book in the trilogy, THE BLADE ITSELF, it has resonances with characters in other books; Colonel Glokta is not unique in being an arrogant, spoiled nobleman with a huge ego. Nor is that very arrogance the colour that inspires those that donât know him well to follow him into a battle and potential disaster. Of more interest and ingenuity are the characters that first appear in âSmall Kindnessâ and several other stories. Shev is a retired (at twenty-one) thief and the owner of a Smoke House â a place where punters come to smoke drugs. One morning, she finds the beaten figure of Javre on her doorstep and instead of chucking her into the gutter, drags her inside. The result of this small kindness is of Javre coming to Shevâs aid when a theft goes wrong and she hasnât got the object she was hired to steal and a fight breaks out. âSkipping Townâ is set a couple of years later and in a different town. Shevâs latest thieving hire is turning into a disaster, especially whilst in trying to get the money, she and Javre fall into a trap. This particular one is set by a warrior priestess of the Knights Templar of the Golden Order. She has been hunting Javre in order to kill her. They manage to escape and head north. Javre is still being pursued by agents of the Temple and Shev has thugs in the pay of Horald the Finger on her trail for killing his son. In âTwoâs Companyâ they meet Wirrun in the middle of a rickety rope bridge, where neither party will give way. We meet them again, eleven years later, in âThreeâs a Crowdâ they watch from the wings as the boy king of Styria is crowned. For services rendered, Shev seems to have finally got Horald to forget his pursuit of her but the Temple has finally got Javre cornered. The duo makes a final appearance in cameo roles in âTough Times All Overâ when a mysterious package passes from hand to hand, legitimately and by stealth. Overall, this pair make a contrasting couple but there are resonances between them and Fritz Leiberâs Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories. They are enjoyable but not spectacularly original. Several other characters recur in various stories. Before Wirrun meets up with Shev and Javre in âTwoâs Companyâ he has been travelling with a group of mercenaries who, in âThe Fool Jobsâ, have been sent to acquire a thing that the leader of the group, Craw, is told he will recognise it when he sees it. Craw and some of his company return in âMade A Monsterâ, the last story in the book. Here they are meant to be involved with a hostage exchange. While situations and characters in the other stories may be familiar to readers of the trilogy, here they represent stand- alone tales. Having not read the novels doesnât take away from enjoyment of the stories in their own right and might encourage readers unfamiliar with them to seek them out. While I have reservations about the originality of the plot lines, the individual characters are well drawn and Abercrombie has worked hard at setting them within his timeframe.\n\nReviewed by Pauline Morgan Feb-2018 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nTHE HEROES by Joe Abercrombie\n\nThis story describes the few days immediately before and afte, as well as the three days of the battle in the valley of Osrung between the Northmen and the Union. In it we meet again a number of the characters depicted in Joe Abercrombieâs first three books (THE BLADE ITSELF, BEFORE THEY ARE HANGED and THE LAST ARGUMENT OF KINGS) as well as a host of other characters.\n\nTHE HEROES is, as are the books named above, full of well defined characters and dirty, gritty violence all of which are an essential part of the storyline. Amongst these persons is âBlack Dowâ the Protector (King) of the North who stole his throne from the âBloody Nineâ who in turn won it by killing Bethod the first King of the Northmen.\n\nSuch is the âBloody Nineâs reputation that in spite being dead (or âreturned to the mudâ in the parlance of the North) he plays a pivotal role in the battle. Other key characters on the side of the North include Bethgodâs younger son, Prince Calder, who isn't interested in honour; all he wants is power, and he'll tell any lie, use any trick, and betray any friend to get it, just as long as he doesn't have to fight for it himself. Curnden Craw described as the last honest man in the North, who has gained nothing from a life of warfare but swollen knees and frayed nerves. He hardly even cares who wins any more, he just wants to do the right thing.\n\nOn the other side, key characters include âThe Dogmanâ, an old companion of the Bloody Nine, who is the chief of the Northmen fighting for the Union; Bremer dan Gorst, a disgraced master swordsman and formally the Unionâs Kingâs First Guard who, obsessed with redemption and addicted to violence, has sworn to reclaim his stolen honour on the battlefield, far past caring how much blood gets spilled in the attempt, even if it's his own; Marshal Kroy who is the Unionâs commander in chief (when Bayaz, the âFirst of the Magiâ lets him) and three politically appointed and mainly incompetent divisional commanders.\n\nDespite its title the book does not glory in war but rather shows its futility, demonstrating that it is often used as a political tool to gain a short term advantage which is frequently squandered, as it appears to be in this case. In fact the heroes of the title are not any of those fighting in the battle, although they could be, but are a ring of standing stones crowning a hill around and on which much of the action takes place.\n\nTHE HEROES is a dark tale, but strangely compelling, enjoyable and well written, progressing at a fast pace. I look forward to future books from this author.\n\nReviewed by Jim Pearce Feb-2011 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nKatherine Addison\n\nTHE WITNESS FOR THE DEAD (Goblin Emperor 2) by Katherine Addison\n\nAlthough billed as the sequel to THE GOBLIN EMPEROR this book works perfectly well as a stand-alone. The first novel won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and was nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and World Fantasy Awards. Following up such a well-received book can be hard but in my opinion THE WITNESS FOR THE DEAD succeeds admirably. In particular it manages to retain the warmth and charm which was such a key component of the first book while wisely moving both location and the focus away from the main protagonist of the previous book.\n\nThara Celehar is a Witness for the Dead. These officials possess the ability to communicate with the dead for a short while after they have passed. Anyone may ask a Witness to talk to a dead person and questions can range from simple matters such as appropriate funeral rites, through inheritance questions and up to identifying causes of death.\n\nIn the previous book, Thara helped the newly appointed Emperor find out who set the bombs that killed the Emperorâs father and half-brothers. Now he has been assigned to the City of Amalo, far from the Imperial court and its complicated politics, which he much prefers. However, being an honest representative for the deceased is far from easy and Thara finds he has swapped one form of politics and pressure for another. The narrative sees him trying to uncover the murderer of an unknown young woman pulled from the canal, advise on who a deceased rich merchant wanted to inherit his substantial estate, investigate the death of a pregnant woman and if that wasnât enough also deal with ghouls who prey on the dead (and sometimes the living!). He is hindered and threatened by those who donât want him to succeed and also by some of the local priesthood who resent his preferment from the Emperor and his anomalous status outside the normal hierarchies.\n\nWhat I absolutely love about this book is both the comprehensive worldbuilding and the characterisation, particularly of the protagonist, Thara Celehar. The town of Amalo is beautifully detailed, from opera houses to airship factories, differing religious practices and funeral rites, systems to investigate crimes, richer and poorer sections of society, family and religious politics etc. The complexity makes this feel like a very credible world even while being very definitely a fantasy setting and yet the author introduces all this skilfully with small minutiae mentioned in passing that accumulate to build a full and satisfying picture.\n\nKatherine Addisonâs other strength is for characterisation. Thara Celehar is not a stereotypical all-action hero; instead we have a middle-aged, emotionally bruised and quite lonely man. Despite his troubled past his integrity and honesty will not allow him to turn aside from the truth, even when he risks being harmed physically or socially. He is someone who doesnât appreciate his own worth and intellectual capabilities and to the reader he is very appealing and engaging. While he is the main protagonist, other characters also have depth and variety including one of my favourites, the flamboyant Pel-Thenhior, the director of a local opera house.\n\nWhat this book also has is an absorbing narrative with a murder mystery at its heart. Like any good detective story, THE WITNESS FOR THE DEAD carefully scatters information as the story progresses so the reader can enjoy piecing together clues and speculating who the culprit(s) may be.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite reads so far this year, and hopefully will start a trend for more kind, compassionate and decent characters in SFF. It has aspects that will appeal to admirers of Sherlock Holmes, or authors like Becky Chambers or Aliette De Bodard and is one I thoroughly recommend.\n\nReviewed by Carol Goodwin Aug-2021 Published by Solaris\n\nReturn to top\n\nSaladin Ahmed\n\nTHRONE OF THE CRESCENT MOON by Saladin Ahmed\n\nThis book has been nominated for a Hugo award, so there must be a lot of people out there who like it. It is an enjoyable romp and for a debut novel it is competently written. It has some idiosyncrasies that give it a different twist on the average fantasy format. Three of the main characters are elderly, reaching the ends of their adventuring lives. Adoulla Makhslood is the last of the ghul-hunters. Ghuls are magical constructs similar to golems conjured out of inanimate material for nefarious reasons. His friends are Litaz and Dawoud. Litaz is an alchemist, Dawoud, her husband, is a scholar and a mage. They have worked together in the past. To add youth to the mix, there is Raseed, a warrior-trained dervish and Zamia a shapechanging girl from the desert tribes.\n\nWhen the niece of the woman Adoulla has loved for twenty years is killed by water ghuls, he promises to investigate. From the opponents he encounters, he deduces that there is a very powerful but evil sorcerer determined to destroy his city and take over the known world. With an unlikely ally in the person of a revolutionary aiming to lead a peopleâs uprising against the despotic Khalif, Adoulla and his friends have to find a way to thwart the evil.\n\nMost of the characters and the social structure of the part of this fantasy world that we have been introduced to have a recognisably Arabic flavour. This is refreshing since most fantasies have an Anglo-centric slant but if this aspect was stripped away, the result would be that of a largely traditional format. This is a world where magic works and monsters lurk in the shadows. There are the heroes who have to solve the riddles and overcome the obstacles to save the day. The villain is totally evil with no redeeming features and seems to have no motive other than total destruction. It is not a narrative where subtlety reigns. These though are all symptoms of the inexperienced writer as is the lack of depth in both the descriptions and the action sequences. Everything happens a little too fast and although Ahmed tries to give depth to his main characters, and to differentiate them by their attitudes and philosophies it doesnât go far enough.\n\nOn the whole this is a good effort but I would hope that the next novel will push the quality of style, plot and characterisation to a higher level.\n\nReviewed by Pauline Morgan Aug-2013 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nBrian Aldiss & Roger Penrose\n\nWHITE MARS or THE MIND SET FREE: A 21st CENTURY UTOPIA by Brian Aldiss & Roger Penrose\n\nThere are two ways of writing a novel about a utopia: the more common is to demonstrate it as a going concern by having a native of it explain things to a visitor (as in Thomas Moreâs original). Almost unique is to show the utopia being set up, which is what Aldiss does.\n\nThe setting is a Mars lightly colonised by humans in the 2060s, when its 6000 inhabitants are suddenly cut off from Earth by Earthâs financial collapse. Quickly abandoning money, the colonists debate over how they should govern themselves, how their society should be structured, how lawbreakers should be treated, and similar problems. So the novel is partly an examination of what makes a utopia. Clearly, no form of government will satisfy all of the people all of the time, so part of the problem is deciding how dissenters should be treated.\n\nThe elderly Tom Jefferies is the main architect of these Utopian attempts, and also one of the novelâs two major narrators. The other is Cang Hai, a young Chinese woman who becomes Jefferiesâ adopted daughter. (I must mention that the colonists include representatives o f just about every colour and culture on Earth, reminiscent of the old 1950s clichÃ© o f a starship being sent out crewed by ten people from ten different nations. I didnât believe it then and, despite Aldissâs explanations, I donât believe it now.) There are, alas, too many characters here, mostly minor, so itâs impossible for the reader to remember whoâs who, and almost the only personalities, which come across, are those of the narrators.\n\nAn important thread of the novel (which provides its title) is the belief by most colonists and the authors that Mars must be protected from commercial exploitation and preserved for science, similar to Antarctica.\n\nIn particular, Mars must not be terraformed.\n\nThis is a novel containing clever plot twists, fascinating details of life in the domes, some drama, many references to that great utopian H.G. Wells and, unfortunately, too much impassioned argument about science and utopianism. Itâs difficult to know how much influence Roger Penrose has had here, though heâs probably responsible for an extended section concerning the search for a subatomic particle called a smudge.\n\nSo WHITE MARS is a most worthwhile subject and a grand saga of Martian colonisation, which is extended, in summary form to cover the whole 21st century. It contains dozens of larger-than-life characters and a wonderful sub- plot concerning Olympus Mons. Without giving away too much Iâll tell you that utopia is eventually achieved, though in a very unexpected manner.\n\nReviewed by Chris Morgan Apr-2000 Published by Little Brown\n\nReturn to top\n\nAlan F Alford\n\nWHEN THE GODS CAME DOWN by Alan F Alford\n\nAlan F Alford has joined a growing band of authors who are putting into doubt the basic message that religious organisations are trying to perpetuate. As people are becoming better educated and the flow of information is becoming more easily accessible, the dogmas of the church and some of the fundamental premises of Archaeology are coming under attack. To the modern reader it is obvious that civilisation did not spring into being fully formed as was taught in schools some fifty years ago but took a much longer process of evolution. Also that so-called pre civilised man had a much better understanding of the world about him than was given credence.\n\nThe modem bible, which has undergone many revisions since the Authorised King James version, has been edited and altered so that it is a long way from any source materiel. Many of the myths and legends in the old testament were recorded from much earlier oral traditions and have no doubt been corrupted through the telling, or as Alan F Alford would have believe, that the theology of the old testament was constructed on half-truths and in some cases outright lies.\n\nWhen gods came down presents an interesting hypothesis that modern religion is a dumbed down version for the masses of a much older religious truth. Also that earth was seeded by meteorites from a celestial body that exploded, eventually giving rise to the legends of ancient mythological gods who fought battles in the skies and came down from Heaven to Earth. Where the real truth lies nobody really knows but as Archaeology uncovers finds that do not fit into the comfortable niche that has underpinned our understanding of the rise of the human race more and more speculative hypothesis with surface. Some of the present âoutlandishâ claims of other authors may yet turn out to be the bedrock of our future understanding, and long forgotten knowledge that has been lost or suppressed may still surface and give support to these claims.\n\nThis book must join the growing volumes of well-researched theories that are well worth the time to read for the interested reader.\n\nReviewed by Chris Chivers Oct-2000 Published by Hodder & Stoughton\n\nReturn to top\n\nJim Al-Khalili\n\nSUNFALL by Jim Al-Khalili\n\nThere have always been professional scientists and mathematicians who have, presumably in their spare time, turned their hands to writing SF -Smith, Bell, Sheffield, Vinge, Brin, Benford to name just a few. More recently, the likes of Carl Sagan, Brian Cox, Hannah Fry, and others whose names are omitted only because they do not immediately come to mind, are to be found fronting popular science programmes on radio and TV. Now, to tick all the boxes, physicist and successful broadcaster Professor Jim Al-Khalili has published his first SFnovel.\n\nHe posits an incipient collapse of the Earth's magnetic field which normally protects us from the devastatingeffect of Coronal Mass Ejections from the Sun. Without that protection, we can look forward to probably nothing less than the end of civilisation as we know it and perhaps even the extinction of life altogether.\n\nInevitably in this sort of situation it takes a group of maverick scientists to come up with an audacious solution - restarting the magnetic field with beams of dark matter! -and get it accepted by the powers-that-be so that it can be put into effect. It is of course inevitable in this kind of novel that they will be successful, but the story is as much about the obstacles that they have to overcome and their personal problems and struggles as it is about the scientific process. It has been suggested elsewhere that the characters involved lack depth and personality, but that does not in fact seem to be sufficiently the case to constitute a significant detraction.\n\nMeanwhile the gravity of the situation has been made apparent by accounts of storms, tidal waves, plane crashes etc. much in the manner of a mainstream disaster movie. At the same time a quasi-religious group believing that the extinction of humanity is the true destiny of the Earth comes into being and plans to sabotage the plan to save the world and as one might have expected the true identity of the leader of this movement is onlyrevealed at the last possible moment, just in time for him to be thwarted. This kind of thing has, of course, been done several times before, there being a propensity for SFwriters to introducethe science-vs-religion dichotomy as a means of demonstrating the superiority of the rational point of view. The result is a tendency for SUNFALLto stray into the thriller area popularised by the likes of Michael Crichton or Dan Brown(Readers unable to see beyond the latter's association with THE DA VINCI CODE should perhaps try his latest, ORIGIN, an intriguing speculation on human evolution both past and future.) However,the science does take centre stage in the story and SUNFALLdoes not fail to be an enjoyable book,holding the reader's attention to the very end if only to see how the science and all the other complications are all worked out. (Needless to say, they are.) The author has taken great care to be sure that the science can be presumed to be faultless, however speculative, and any shortcomings of plotting or characterisation are not massive enough to worry about unduly.\n\nIt may not go down in history as one of the all-time great novels, but it may be summed up by that old clichÃ© that if this is the sort of thing you like, you will like this. Your reviewer did. Michael Jones\n\nReviewed by Jun-2019 Published by Bantam Press\n\nReturn to top\n\nPoul Anderson\n\nTAU ZERO by Poul Anderson\n\nOne of the odder (and sometimes amazing) things about being an SF fan who started reading SF in the early eighties is the way you can be aware of a name like Poul Anderson for years, but due to the backlog of excellent SF novels to read, how one might not have ever actually gotten around to reading any of Poulâs novels until now. Which seems a shame, because if TAU ZERO is anything to go by, Poul Anderson is really rather special; Poul Anderson has won the Hugo seven times, and the Nebula three. And TAU ZERO is merely one of his Hugo âbest novelâ nomineesâ¦\n\nI have heard a few different definitions of âhardâ science fiction in the last 20 years; one common view is that hard SF realistically portrays characters as real human beings, with understandable human motives and frailties. This improves the believability of the story, as the reader can relate to the characterâs actions â it all makes human sense, regardless of the SF situation the characters may be in. A different definition of hard SF might be that the technological fiction described in the story seems plausibly extrapolated from existing scientific knowledge, thus making the story seem more plausible in its own right (of course, this depends on the readerâs actual scientific understanding, but a fair proportion of SF readers have at least a passing interest in science as well, so I guess this helps). TAU ZERO satisfies both these definitions very well; I quote author James Blish âThe ultimate hard science fiction novel.â The basic premise concerning a crew of 50 carefully selected humans in a spaceship built to survey and, if possible, colonise a nearby star system, is well handled in this novel. The characters know that ultimately they might need to pair off and start families, if the mission is successful, and the interplay between them is handled in colourful yet realistic fashion, giving the reader a great insight into the characters themselves. The spaceship itself, built to utilise interstellar hydrogen in a Bussard engine, constantly accelerating to a significant portion of the speed of light, seems realistically described, to the extent that the reader can easily believe that this might indeed be a way to the stars. The explanations of the relativistic effects of having such a high velocity feel plausible (to one with a basic understanding of Einsteinâs theories, at any rate), allowing the crew to reach their destination within a reasonable human timescale. If it is all this well worked out one wonders, why havenât we gone to the stars already??\n\nAnd this novel does not stop giving there, either; in the best 70âs tradition, this is also a disaster novel! Without wanting to give too much away (the blurb reveals this at least) an unexpected incident in the voyage damages the engines such that the ship can never stop accelerating. The results are believably fantastic.\n\nGoodness! If a `lesserâ Anderson novel is this good, what must his award winners be like? Or the competition for the Hugo back in 1971, for that matter?\n\nPerhaps the best thing about being young enough to have started reading SF in the eighties is that I still have time to catch up on authors like Poul Andersonâ¦\n\nand itâs going to be a lot of fun!\n\nReviewed by Dave Corby May-2009 Published by Gollancz\n\nReturn to top\n\nGillian Anderson and Jeff Rovin\n\nA VISION OF FIRE - BOOK ONE OF THE EARTHEND SAGA by Gillian Anderson and Jeff Rovin\n\nGillian Anderson will of course always be known for her role in The X-Files (yes, that Gillian Anderson!), but she has since moved on to become a quite highly regarded stage and screen actress. In collaboration with established writer Jeff Rovin she now makes what the publishers describe as her âthrilling science fiction debutâ with the first volume in a Saga of as-yet unspecified length. In point of fact, it may well be that Rovin has provided the majority of the writing while Anderson's contribution is largely confined to providing her supposedly prestigious name to be put on the cover. (See Ansible #328.)\n\nIt tells the story of how child psychologist Caitlin O'Hara is called in when the teenage daughter of India's ambassador to the United Nations becomes severely disturbed after her father survives an assassination attempt. O'Hara discovers that other cases of disturbed teenagers have occurred in such unlikely places as Iran and Haiti, cases which appear at first glance to be different although certain points of similarity are to be found. Eventually a connection emerges in the form of a kind of possession by a spirit force seeking escape from a fiery cataclysm and O'Hara also becomes affected. This volume ends with her having discovered something of the nature of this mysterious influence which seems to arise from a civilisation of the remote past in the Antarctic, but a full understanding will, obviously, not emerge until it is explained in the later volume(s).\n\nMeanwhile, a highly secret and very powerful Group hidden within something called the Global Explorer's Club is pursuing its own agenda and clearly knows already a lot more of what is involved than O'Hara has yet discovered.\n\nThis is all a lot less thrilling than they would have us believe. The writing is pedestrian and the overall style and structure of the book are strongly reminiscent of a mainstream novel where the general lack of originality might be less noticeable. The characters spend a lot of time just talking and thinking about things instead of actually doing anything and trips to Haiti and Iran are described in unnecessary detail which contributes to the sense that it has all been padded out beyond the length the story is naturally capable of supporting. Learning more of what the shadowy Group are seeking to achieve might have made it more interesting or even exciting, but again that may have to await later opportunities for revelation.\n\nThere is perhaps some scope for subsequent volumes in The Earthend Saga to redeem the shortcomings of this one, but the signs are not hopeful.\n\nReviewed by Michael Jones Jan-2015 Published by Simon & Schuster\n\nReturn to top\n\nJohn Appel\n\nASSASSINâS ORBIT by John Appel\n\nSometimes the hype that comes with a book can set the wrong expectations and this can make it harder to enjoy the actual text when it doesnât match up. This book was promoted as âGolden Girls meets The Expanse with a side of Babylon 5â. In particular, while there are certainly older women as main characters, they are not what I would describe as âgolden girlsâ â they are of working age, tough and physically capable (with a few handwave limitations such as a little less stamina than younger characters) and this jarred for me. Secondly, it felt like an outdated (and patronising) reference â one that a younger demographic is probably not even aware of â certainly my son (who is in his twenties) had never heard of the programme.\n\nMuch of the story is set on and around an orbital station, Ileri and the planet Kochi. Various colonies were all formed after a hasty diaspora from old Earth, fleeing from the âUnity Plagueâ â invasive software designed to control people and remove their free will. At the time of the story, the Ileri/Kochi people have just voted to join one of the larger blocs, the Commonwealth, but there is a significant faction who want to stop the alliance and diplomatic tensions are high. When the Commonwealth Consul is one of the people killed at an elite party, solving his murder becomes a top priority. As well as the official police investigation, representatives from a local private security firm and an undercover agent from the Commonwealth also have vested interests in uncovering the perpetrators. Their different resources and abilities each aid in following the trail. Initially working independently, they start to overlap and forge a partnership especially as they uncover a threat to not only Ileri station but also the whole of the new worlds of humanity.\n\nWhat is refreshing in this book is that the three main characters are all capable women in positions of responsibility and they are also all women of colour. That being said, I didnât really warm to any of them. Some of this was due to the relentless pace of the action so there were few âquietâ moments to add detail to their characters and background. Also, the story shifted points of view quite often, and not just with the main three protagonists, so I found it confusing as to what their precise roles where.\n\nIt also took time for me to work out the backstory and setup of the world and what the various factions represented. Personally, a little more foreshadowing and detail at the front end of the book would have helped me enjoy the book more. However, towards the end of the book things did start to make more sense and the climactic scenes were fun and did bring together the various strands of the plot. I got the feeling that the author much preferred writing action scenes and these in fairness usually worked well. In essence this is a reasonable space opera read but not up to the standards of writers such as Gareth Powell or Alastair Reynolds.\n\nReviewed by Carol Goodwin Aug-2021 Published by Solaris\n\nReturn to top\n\nRachel Armstrong\n\nORIGAMY by Rachel Armstrong\n\nNewCon Press do publish some excellent books and are not afraid to take chances that larger publishers will not.

Well-respected authors such as Adam Roberts, Justina Robson and Adrian Tchaikovsky have highly praised it but I must admit that I really struggled with it. Normally when writing a review, I like to give an idea of the main plot but discerning one is one of the major difficulties I have with this novel. The structure is not conventional, consisting of very short chapters, ranging from a couple of lines to a few pages and it jumps from one often unconnected scene to another. The reader is flung in at the deep end and spends a lot of time and effort trying to comprehend what is happening. After a lot of struggle, it appears to concern Mobius, a member of a strange family of circus acrobats/spacetime travellers. By pulling âthreadsâ from spacetime they can weave them and jump to different parts of the galaxy as observers. Mobius is an unreliable narrator as her memory is patchy and events are not necessarily being shown in chronological order. As we jump from one scene to the next it gradually becomes apparent that something dark is affecting and threatening the universe and the weavers must unite to prevent catastrophe. The novel is a dizzying melange of ideas from crafts, poetry, biology, physics etc. While some readers may enjoy this deluge of information, I found the long digressions into things as diverse as the Philae spacecraft to the ecology of a âstomach gardenâ tiring and of little obvious relation to the plot. This patchwork of scenes is clearly intended to stitch together into a coherent whole but unlike the character in the book who urges âYou donât need to understand, Mobius. Sometimes too much rationalisation gets in the wayâ I am afraid that I do like to understand and felt that more explanation and less sheer unrelated details and exposition would have improved this book immensely for me. In addition, I could not feel any connection or interest in the characters â Mobiusâ parents in particular seemed very remote and not fully rounded â existing mostly to talk in ambiguous maxims or enigmatic parables or stories. The reader does not really get into the charactersâ heads and I felt they operated only on a cerebral level with little emotional depth. This meant that I had no great interest in what happened to them to keep me wanting to read. All of the above also meant that I found the pace of the book extremely slow and found myself suffering from a kind of âreader fatigueâ where I could only read in short bursts at a time. Its Alice In Wonderland/Grand Tour of the Universe combination may appeal to some but is definitely is too literary and unconventional for me.\n\nReviewed by Carol Goodwin May-2018 Published by NewCon Press\n\nReturn to top\n\nNeal Asher\n\nDARK INTELLIGENCE by Neal Asher\n\nDARK INTELLIGENCE is the first volume in the new Transformation series of novels by Neal Asher and is a very welcome return to his popular Polity universe. In it we meet again a number of characters that featured in some of his previous novels. These include Amistad, a scorpion war drone who through extensive upgrades to its AI systems has become the warden of a Polity protectorate planet, Masada. This is the home of the Weaver, the only sentient Gabbleduck (or Atheter), one of the previously thought to be extinct ancient races who occupied the galaxy long before humans evolved. Much of the action in this book takes place there. Amistad had been given responsibility for the dark (evil) AI, Penny Royal, whom in the previous Polity novel THE TECHNICIAN it was believed he had rehabilitated by removing its eighth and evil state of consciousness, but is this true?\n\nPenny Royal features strongly in this book and is feared an"
