Lyra Belacqua, the series' protagonist, comes from an alternate Earth where John Calvin, instead of forming a new breakaway church, instead became the Pope, moved the Church to Geneva, and so by the time of the first book the Church (named \"the Magisterium\") is far more dominant, aggressive and interferes in society's affairs. Much of the dress code and social mores are still from the 18th century (women are not allowed to teach at Oxford University), cars and fixed-winged aircraft, but zeppelins are a common and dominant mode of transport. There are six known planets in this world and the month of April has an extra day. Magical aspects exist as the underpinning quantum reality of Lyra's universe, and other species, such as Witches and talking, intelligent armoured bears (called panserbjørne) co-exist with Humans. Other worlds include that of the world of Cittàgazze, which serves as the crossroads to the worlds because all the windows lead here. Other worlds include that of a world where elephant-like creatures evolved a distinct anatomy based on a diamond-framed skeleton without a spine, and one where Humans aligned with the Majesterium are engaged in a genocidal war with the Gallivespians.\n\nNorthern Lights (1995)\n\nThe Subtle Knife (1997)\n\nThe Amber Spyglass (2000)\n\nLyra's Oxford (2003)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the North (2008)\n\nThe Collectors (2014)\n\nLa Belle Sauvage (2017)\n\nThe Secret Commonwealth (2019)\n\nSerpentine (2020)\n\nThe Imagination Chamber (2022)\n\nAltered State J.
