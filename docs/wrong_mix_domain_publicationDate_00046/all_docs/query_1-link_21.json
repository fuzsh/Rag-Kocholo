        "text": "Bryan, Ashley. The Story of Lightning & Thunder. 1993, Atheneum. ISBN 9780689318368\n\nDid you know that Lightning and Thunder used to walk among us here on earth? Uh-huh, it’s true! They were free to wander and summon their good friend Rain whenever needed to help the village. Well, this charming and enchanting retelling of a traditional tale from West Africa is indeed the story of Lightning and Thunder, and how they came to be banished from the earth to the sky.\n\nThunder once took the form of Mother Sheep, and Lightning was her son, a rambunctious young ram. Together they wandered the center of their village, happily chatting up their many friends and visitors. Unfortunately, Lightning just cannot seem to behave himself, and insists on butting in everywhere causing trouble. These escapades land the two at the edge of town, where they can no longer enjoy the constant company of the village. Further misdeeds get them sent to the center of the forest, and finally, when the King can take no more of Lightning’s recklessness and disrespect, they are banished from the Earth altogether, and make a final ascent of the mountains where they keep going up, up, up into the sky!\n\nThis beautiful book is based on Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria, West Africa by Elphinstone Dayrell which was published in 1910. We are told the tale is set long ago in a village on the West Coast of Alkebu-lan, which is now called Africa. The illustrations transport us to the sunny landscape of a colorful village surrounded by hot, dry fields and high hills and mountains. The drawings are simplistic, almost childlike renderings of the village people, their interactions with the land and our main characters in their animal forms. The people in the illustrations are clearly culturally specific to Africa, and the main characters of Lightning and Thunder are true to the folktale formula of beast tales, where animals take on human characteristics. In this case, Ma Sheep Thunder is the wise elder, and Son Ram Lightning is the foolish youngster.\n\nThe theme of the story is USE YOUR HEAD! Always think before you “BIFF, BAM, BUTT! Also, there is a healthy dose of respect your elders and listen to your mother because “bad ways will get you into trouble”.\n\nThis is a great read-aloud story with tons of great action words, “parrom, parrom, parrom,” “wham, biff, bam”, and “Baa-ba-lam!” that kids will want to hear and repeat over and over again.\n\nA definite jewel from the African coast! This is one to read during the next storm, and kids will have no trouble imagining Lightning streaking through the sky, with his mother’s rumbling voice calling after him.\n\nEditorial Reviews"
