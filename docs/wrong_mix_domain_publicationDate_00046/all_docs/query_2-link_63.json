        "text": "Johnny Thunder and his Magic Thunderbolt. DC’s Muddled Master of Mystics. What can I say? This is the Comics Relief character to beat all Comic Relief characters, because Johnny was Comic Relief to the entire Justice Society of America at once, and had his own solo series for nearly 90 issues of Flash Comics. This is no Doiby Dickles, no Stretch Skinner, no Percival Popp. Johnny T was the real thing. And, since comics got all serious’n’shit, he’s been a real problem to account for.\n\nJohnny Thunder, whose series was originally entitled Johnny Thunderbolt, was created by writer John B Wentworth and artist Stan Aschmeier (who usually signed his work Stan Asch). He made his début in Flash Comics 3 and his first five stories are reprinted in JSA All-Stars Archives Volume 1. Johnny was the infant son of Simon and Mildred Thunder, who was kidnapped and taken to the Pacific island of Bahdnesia, where he was raised to be the one who would give Bahdnesia the rule of the world.\n\nHowever, Johnny, who could easily be diagnosed as suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder, managed to float away from the island one day, return to America and get back to his grateful parents, where he finished growing up (to the extent that he ever did). However, as the Bahdnesian Chosen One, Johnny found that he had been given a magic Thunderbolt that, if summoned by the Bahdnesian words ‘Cei-u’ make people do what Johnny told them for an hour. Johnny did not wear a costume as such, but he had a very limited wardrobe, consisting of a green suit, white shirt and an infinite number of yellow bow-ties (presumably from the Earth-2 equivalent of Barry Allen’s tailor).\n\nAt first, the Thunderbolt was simply a bolt of lightning. Gradually it grew into a pink genie, with jagged, lightning edge features and body. At first, Johnny didn’t even know he had a pet Thunderbolt. Fortunately, ‘Cei-u’ was pronounced Say You, so Johnny was always summoning the Thunderbolt accidentally. Over time, Johnny finally discovered that he had a magic Thunderbolt (Flash 11). Then, some time after that, he worked out what he was doing to summon the ‘Bolt (Flash 20). However, he never quite got the hang of giving the ‘Bolt clear, exact and effective commands, since Johnny tended to get flustered whenever he was in danger (that is, if he recognised he was actually in danger in the first place). So the ‘Bolt could only ever save the day accidentally.\n\nJohnny Thunder was the first member to join the Justice Society after the founders. He did attend the opening meeting in All-Star 3, but that was as a Thunderbolt-assisted gatecrasher. There, Johnny managed to wish away all the banquet, but redeemed himself by suggesting that the founders tell their most exciting mission, so as to fill out the issue. He also had a cameo in issue 5, but his hour in the sun came in issue 6, when the Flash stepped down to become an honorary member, and Johnny put himself forward as Flash’s replacement, having obtained the permission of his girlfriend, Daisy Darling. Instead of being upset or outraged at his cheek, the JSA subjected him to a joke Initiation ceremony, that gradually turned into a serious case. Nevertheless, Johnny was in, and he stayed in until All-Star 39.\n\nOne unexpected twist came when Johnny became the first – and I hope only – comic relief character to get a comic relief character, in the form of his adopted daughter, Peachy Pet. Having now read the complete run of Johnny’s series, I can safely say that this was one dumb idea. The only thing that could have been worse would be to give the Thunderbolt a family, and a son who teams up with Peachy. Oh, wait…\n\nThere’s not a lot to say about Johnny Thunder’s JSA career: if you read one story, you’ve read them all. Johnny was dumb as a mud post, and it became a standard feature of his JSA stories that each member’s solo chapter would end by them being summoned rapidly by the Thunderbolt to Johnny’s rescue, whilst Thunder’s own chapter was saved until last to enable the kids to see just what mess he’d gotten himself into this time.\n\nWhen the JSA disbanded to join the Army, Johnny was the only one to hold back – because he joined the Navy (much to the Navy’s regret). In All-Star 30, when the rest of the JSA were driven mad, Johnny was driven sane, until he got a bump on his head at the end, and went back to normal. And when the JSA were in their creative doldrums, before Kanigher’s intervention, Johnny’s chapters managed to be even dumber than they’d been at the start.\n\nBut once Kanigher stuck his nose in, Johnny’s days were numbered. He called upon his Thunderbolt for the last time in All-Star 33, was overlooked by the Wizard for a mission in issue 34, much to his disgust, was absent with a cold and requesting Superman to take his place in 36, reconciled to sitting and waiting with Wonder Woman in 37 (maybe he wasn’t that stupid) and in 38 made the mistake of dying and passing his last words on to Black Canary. It was the beginning of the end,\n\nWe’ll have more of the Canary when her turn comes. For now, suffice to say that she had been introduced as a villain in Johnny’s series in Flash but had been immediately reinterpreted as a superhero. She became Johnny’s co-star for five issues, and then, in Flash and the JSA, she replaced him. Bye bye Johnny.\n\nIt’s possible to argue that Johnny Thunder was actually the first JSA member to have his name taken by a new character, well before the Barry Allen-Flash. Johnny Thunder 2 was schoolteacher John Tane, son of Sherriff Tane, a hard, strict man who had, nevertheless, married a young, sweet schoolteacher. He wanted John to succeed him as Sheriff, but she’d wanted him to be a man of peace, as he’d promised her on her deathbed, much to his father’s disgust. But with coaldust to darken his hair, and a set of buckskins and guns, John Tane was able to aid his father, riding the range as Johnny Thunder for the next decade.\n\nThe original Johnny Thunder returned in 1965. He was the very first JSA member I ever read, in the opening chapters of Justice League of America 37: complaining that it had taken this long to be invited to a JSA meeting, calling his Thunderbolt back after twenty years, getting distracted into travelling to Earth-1 to meet its Johnny Thunder, a petty crook, and being knocked out, his Thunderbolt taken over and basically sleeping out the rest of a spiralling adventure that made me fall heavily for the Justice Society.\n\nJohnny took part, on occasions, in the annual team-ups: he was the hero in 1967, when his awful jokes prove to be the weakness of the invading black sphere aliens (as do water, wood and wisteria, but no-one has the heart to break it to him), but in general terms, he remained the comic relief character, still with a crush on Black Canary after she’d transferred to Earth-1, and not keen on Green Arrow.\n\nThere were even stories to explain why Johnny had ceased calling on his Thunderbolt in the late Forties: that he had no longer been able to summon the ‘Bolt because the Bahdnesians had resumed plotting against him, that he had been kidnapped to and brainwashed into becoming King of Bahdnesia, before Superman had assisted him in seeing sense and he’d turned the island into a democracy. Johnny was even turned into a deadbeat Dad by Roy Thomas, having apparently fathered a son on an unmarried Indian woman, who he’d abandoned because of shame over the prejudice against mixed race marriages: her son was William Twotrees, aka Willpower in Primal Force.\n\nDuring the JSA’s absence in limbo, Roy Thomas did another ‘salvage’ job, introducing private detective Jonni Thunder, a young woman with the secret ability to turn into a bolt of black lightning. She can be regarded as Johnny Thunder 3, though the character did not go far at all, making only one post mini-series appearance, in which she lost her powers. If Thomas had used her more, inevitably she’d have turned out to be related to Johnny T himself, but no go.\n\nJohnny was developed a little further when the JSA returned from limbo. He’d grown somewhat chubby after years of being a skinny guy, and he found himself rich, having leant Peachy Pet some money to start a frozen yoghurt stand before disappearing, and come back to find himself co-owner of a national franchise. But Johnny, feeling out of place, went back to Bahdnesia, only to find all the Bahdnesians gone. The JSA get involve to expose the island as having been taken over by a fascist organisation, but it was a downbeat story, serving to demonstrate that, when the ‘Bolt left with Johnny, it took away all the Bahdnesians’ magic, leading to their terminal decline.\n\nThe story was clearly intended to introduce a new master, or in this case mistress, for the Thunderbolt, in the form of Kiku, a young girl who was the last Bahdnesian, and who could command the ‘Bolt. Kiku became Johnny’s new foster daughter, but the series was cancelled before anything could be done with her. Kiku did appear in Primal Force, when she formally took control of the Thunderbolt, only to vanish forever without explanation. Or anyone remembering her.\n\nPost- Zero Hour, Johnny aged rapidly and developed Alzheimers. He forget where he kept the Thunderbolt, he forgot his magic words. In The Flash 134 (Wally West’s series), Jay Garrick was trying to track down the Thinker’s Thinking Cap, which had gone to Johnny Thunder, who was responsible for the JSA’s souvenirs. The mentally confused Johnny sent him away with a fountain pen which Jay lost whilst signing autographs in Keystone. All of which set things up for Grant Morrison to write the first JLA/JSA team-up since the Crisis, in JLA 28-31, in which the pen – which contained the Thunderbolt – turned up in the possession of foul-mouthed street kid J.J. Thunder (real name later given as Jakeem Jay Williams) who can command the Thunderbolt, and becomes Johnny’s successor (Johnny Thunder 4 in all but name) in JSA 1."
