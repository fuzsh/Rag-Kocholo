        "text": "I am honored and excited to announce that Flames of Stone (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 3) has launched! The paperback is live, and the audiobook is coming April 30th 2024.\n\nIt’s hard to express the feeling of getting this book out there, as it’s been a long road. I am proud of the three years of work it took to get here. Thank you so much for your amazing letters and support.\n\n-Sever\n\nP.S. The ebook for Prodigy of Thunder, the first book in the saga, is on sale for only $0.99 until December 14th. If you know someone who you think might enjoy the trilogy, consider sending them the link. Thank you\n\nP.P.S. For those wanting to support my work on social media, I place at your disposal the media kit to Flames of Stone (especially check out the cool animated GIF). Consider posting the image featuring the entire trilogy. (I do my own social media and am not very good at it, so your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.)\n\nI’m thrilled to announce that The Arcane Artist (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 2) is finally out! You can snag it here. Get ready for new spells, new lands, and a whole new side to Anna you have never seen before.\n\nAlso, Prodigy of Thunder (Chronicles of Anna Atticus Stone, book 1) will be on sale in the USA and Uk for 99 cents for one week. And as always, ALL my work is available for Kindle Unlimited subscribers.\n\nThank you to everyone for your amazing support over the years. This is my eleventh(!) book, which boggles my mind. Yet my career as an author could not have been possible without you. So, yeah, thank you ;)\n\nWarlock Anna Atticus Stone is on her final year at the academy. As head of student council, academic prodigy, and champion arena dueler, she seems the perfect pupil.\n\nIn reality, Anna is grieving, overwhelmed, and so lonely she talks to herself. Above all, she fears assassination if people find out her father’s dying gift to her was a scion. Only seven of these powerful artifacts exist, one in each kingdom—a precarious balance that maintains peace.\n\nThat peace shatters when a kingdom steals a second scion and invades its weaker neighbor. Anna feels compelled to act, but that would mean facing her crippling fears, a quest into the unforgiving wilds, and risking her kingdom becoming a target of war.\n\nDriven by the memory of her father, she must find the one thing eluding her thus far . . . courage.\n\nC O M I N G D E C E M B E R 2\n\nPREORDER HERE\n\nThe paperback should be available on release day.\n\nThe audiobook is scheduled to launch April 11th, 2023. The preorder for it will be available any day now.\n\nI can’t wait for you to experience Anna’s epic new adventure!\n\n—Sever\n\nP.S. The Advance Reader Team will receive a separate email imminently\n\nA family of warlocks . . . torn by an ancient secret.\n\nFourteen-year-old Anna Atticus Stone is a prodigy.\n\nA warlock prodigy.\n\nThe youngest to ever wield lightning, Anna burns with ambition, dreaming of attending the prestigious Academy of Arcane Arts.\n\nBut her life’s a mess.\n\nShe’s friendless, her father barely lets her out of the house, and her older sister keeps knocking her teeth out.\n\nAnd her parents fight. Constantly. Mostly over her father illegally training the sisters in the old way, as it’s forbidden to learn so far ahead.\n\nNow Anna readies to take the academy entrance trials. A pass will mean friends, warlock tournaments, and exploring a thousand-year-old academy. Typical teenage warlock stuff.\n\nExcept her sister is bent on sabotaging her. And there’s a reason for that sabotage—and for the illegal training . . . their father carries a dangerous secret.\n\nA secret for only one daughter.\n\nAnd Anna is about to find out what her sister is willing to do to claim it.\n\nPersonal thoughts from the author:\n\nThe day has finally come! After a long year of writing and editing Anna’s story, Prodigy of Thunder has launched. I cannot wait for you to experience the beginning of her journey. You have been requesting her story ever since reading about her in Arcane (The Arinthian Line, book 1). It gives me great honor to deliver on that request.\n\nIt was a tricky endeavor for me to write a book about an already established character. For that challenge, I searched deep into who Anna was whilst asking myself what sorts of things would she have gone through as a child and as a teenager. Writing the answers into the book was immensely enjoyable for me, even though Anna went through serious trials.\n\nAnna’s strengths come from her independence, her compassion, and her ambition. But she has always suffered from loneliness too. This story partly aims to explain why and how that loneliness took root. I find her to be a complicated soul with an epic story, one I look forward to fleshing out in subsequent books.\n\nNote that both the paperback and ebook versions have a map and Anna’s full academy class schedule. Also, I hope you’ll consider sharing the launch on social media (or even sharing my Facebook post about it).\n\nThank you all for your amazing support over the years, and feel free to email me your thoughts when you’re done reading.\n\nEnjoy the book!\n\nAll my best to you and those you love,\n\n-Sever\n\nP.S. Extra special thanks to the ART team, as well as the wonderful souls who participate on this website. You know who you are :)\n\nYour wait is over! The grand finale to the Fury of a Rising Dragon series, Champion’s Wrath, has finally launched on Kindle.\n\nThis book was a huge undertaking and an emotional journey for me, but I am mighty proud of the work—and the entire Fury of a Rising Dragon series as a whole. Loads of surprises coming your way.\n\nChampion’s Wrath is a true epic, clocking in at a whopping 275,000 words—736 paperback pages, maxing out the printer (and my nerves). I gave it my very all every step of the way.\n\nI cannot thank you enough for your amazing support over the years. You have sent me emails by the thousands from all corners of the world, throwing nothing but kindness my way, encouraging this endeavor. Because of you, I have been able to be a full-time author now for over five years (and I’ve spent nine years writing the trio in total—thus far).\n\nAnd special thanks to the ART. You know who you are, and you are very much appreciated\n\nThis has been a difficult year in particular for everyone, and hopefully Augum, Bridget and Leera can give you a little pick-me-up for the holidays. So grab a blanket and get cozy, because the last adventure in the Fury of a Rising Dragon series is about to begin. I proudly reveal Champion’s Wrath, available from Amazon in the following countries:\n\nUSA | UK | GERMANY | FRANCE | SPAIN | ITALY | NETHERLANDS | JAPAN | BRAZIL | CANADA | MEXICO | AUSTRALIA | INDIA\n\nAll my best to you and those you love,\n\n—Sever\n\nP.S. Additionally, I put the Kindle version of Arcane and Burden’s Edge on sale for only 99 cents (sale ends Dec 8th). Please share if you have people in your circle who you think might enjoy the saga.\n\nP.P.S. I hope you will consider leaving an honest review of Champion’s Wrath on Amazon when you’re done, as every review helps Augum, Bridget and Leera reach new readers. Thank you so much.\n\nP.P.P.S. Bonus photos of Buddha. She pretends like she wants to be part of the fun, but what she really wants are the cookies:\n\nHeyas :)\n\nShipping is a touch slower these days so I thought I’d launch the paperback as soon as it was ready. This way those who are gifting it to others (or themselves ;) will hopefully receive it in time for the holiday season. At 275,000 words, it’s an epic book (and it just managed to squeeze in under the max page count with the printer). Can’t tell you how much fun I had writing it and how excited I am for you to read it!\n\nThe Kindle ebook is launching this Friday/Saturday, depending on how long Amazon’s approval process takes. But you’ll get an email from me as soon as it’s live.\n\nYou can snag the paperback copy of Champion’s Wrath (Fury of a Rising Dragon, book 4) from your country as follows:\n\nUSA\n\nCanada\n\nUK\n\nJapan\n\nItaly\n\nSpain\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nPlease note some countries may not be able to order the paperback yet due to Covid restrictions, which are beyond my control as they are set by Amazon.\n\nAll my best to you and those you love,\n\n—Sever\n\nSummoning dragons exacts a price. Can they afford to pay it?\n\nAugum, Bridget and Leera are the first to summon dragons in thousands of years. But the ancient spell inflicts an unforeseen side effect—after every casting, it turns them against each other.\n\nAs the Canterran army plunders their kingdom, Katrina Von Edgeworth uses her siege engine dragon to crush all resistance. The trio, fledglings at fighting in the air, soon find themselves outmatched.\n\nNow everything hangs by a thread and Augum, Bridget and Leera must somehow carve a path to victory—without gouging each other’s eyes out.\n\nLittle do they know the enemy is readying a deadly surprise.\n\n* * *\n\nChampion’s Wrath is the grand finale to the Fury of a Rising Dragon series. Also by Sever Bronny: The Arinthian Line series, the epic coming of age adventure that began it all.\n\n* * *\n\nI’m so excited to at last be able to share the cover and blurb with you guys. It’s been a long and emotional journey to get to this point, but we’re finally in the home stretch. So get ready to embark on another wondrous adventure with the trio, because it’s just around the corner!\n\nAll my best to you and those you love,\n\n—Sever\n\nP.S. ART: watch out for the email, it’s coming soon ;)\n\nHeyas! How’s everyone doing? I’m going to announce the name of the next book. But before I do, I just wanted to note that I haven’t posted lately because I’ve been taking a break from social media to focus on finishing a major editing round, which was incredibly complex due to the sheer scale of the book.\n\nAnd the book is epic, and I mean EPIC. I have a feeling you guys will be quite satisfied with how this particular series ends.\n\nNow on to the crux of the post . . .\n\nThe name of the last book of the Fury of a Rising Dragon series will be Champion’s Wrath. It is currently on schedule for a December launch. (The image I uploaded is a stock image to whet your appetites.)\n\nI’m also trying to decide on which series to write next: a story of the trio as adults, or a story about Mrs. Stone’s tempestuous youth. What are your thoughts?\n\nToday marks the five-year anniversary of the launch of Arcane. In celebration of this amazingly special milestone, I am hosting my first ever giveaway. The winner will receive a complete signed paperback set of The Arinthian Line series (sword not included). I will announce the winner in the comments on Saturday, November 30th, 2019.\n\nHOW TO ENTER:\n\n1. Follow me @severbronny on Instagram, where this contest is being held\n\n2. Like the contest post on my profile\n\n3. Leave a comment on the post naming your favorite fantasy character of all time, from any series.\n\n4. Tag two people you know like fantasy books.\n\nGiveaway is international. Entrant must be 16+ years old, or have parental permission. One entry per Instagram account. Entries from giveaway-specific accounts will be disqualified. Contest closes 11:59 pm PST Nov. 29, 2019, at which point one winner will be chosen at random. Winner must provide an address so I can ship them their prize. Postage will be covered by author. This giveaway is not sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with Instagram.\n\nGood luck!\n\n-Sever\n\nP.S. And not long after this contest—you guessed it!—comes the launch of Mercy’s Trial :)\n\n– Announcing the name of book 3\n\n– I need your help nominating Arcane for its first-ever book contest\n\nFirstly, I’m excited to announce that the name of the next book, coming out in December, will be Mercy’s Trial (Fury of a Rising Dragon, book 3). It’s an epic work (a book as long as Legend!). It’s currently with my wife, who is doing the developmental editing. When that gets done, it’s going to go through another couple of edit rounds before a line editor takes over. The cover reveal will come in the next few months. In the meantime, I’ll get to start writing book 4! Needless to say, I’m ultra excited.\n\nSecondly, I’d like to ask your help with something I’ve never tried before–a book contest! Epic Fantasy Fanatics is running a massive contest on Facebook, and I’ve submitted Arcane for contention. The tricky part is that Arcane will require 100 nominations to enter the main contention round, and I’ve only got a handful so far because I haven’t publicized that I’ve entered the contest. Nominating the book is super quick and easy:\n\nSimply go to Arcane’s nomination page (link below), scroll down, and click on “nominate”. Doing so will prompt an automatic Facebook dialogue asking you if you wish to nominate Arcane. Click on “Yes.” \n\nLink to Arcane’s nomination page\n\nThe nomination round ends in four days (July 14th), so your help in getting us to 100 is crucial. Thank you so much for your amazing support :)\n\nSo what do you think of the name Mercy’s Trial? Are you as excited as I am?\n\nAll the best,\n\nSever"
