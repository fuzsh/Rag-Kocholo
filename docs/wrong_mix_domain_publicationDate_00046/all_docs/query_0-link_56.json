        "text": "Rave The New York Times Book Review Practically a book of poetry ... Williams distills a lot of learning — about philosophy, aesthetics, metaphysics and morality — into her vignettes ... Running almost silently below the loneliness and the silky comedy in these stories is the sense, down on earth, of acidifying oceans, species loss and space junk crashing Muskily down from the cosmos.\n\nMixed The New York Times Let’s get the bad news out of the way. The Heart in Winter is not top-shelf Kevin Barry. He never quite gets a handle on these characters ... Because Barry is Barry, moments of comic wonderment sneak in through the pantry door ... Perhaps fearing he would give his readers too little, Barry has given them too much. It’s a great quality in a host, except when it isn’t.\n\nMixed The New York Times This memoir, which despite its darts of insight and many flashes of good writing remains lukewarm and distant ... If this quarter-life crisis memoir were a stool, the third leg — after Russo’s story and Prose’s own — would be the author’s attempt at a group portrait of her generation, not the baby boomers writ large but a sophisticated subset of them. This material is the least successful.\n\nPan The New York Times Skippable for all but her most devoted tier of readers ... Sterile, ostentatious and essentially plotless, Parade is an antinovel, a little black box of a book. It fails the Hardwick Test. The sole burden of an antinovel, the critic Elizabeth Hardwick wrote, is that it must be consistently...interesting ... Airless and abstract ... The art talk that consumes this novel is leaden. It is the way you might begin to speak if you were raised solely in the Tate and the Whitney and had never eaten a hot dog.\n\nPositive The New York Times Casual, sympathetic and compulsively readable ... It’s an awkward title that, as the book goes on, begins to seem apt ... This is Courogen’s first book, and she relates it as if over Negronis. She casually drops a lot of f-bombs. At times, she rambles ... The author is an ardent fan who’s read everything and talked to whomever she could. Her intensity shines. Sometimes you’d rather ride along with a fan than with a professor.\n\nPan The New York Times Book Review Ambitious but uneven and exhausting ... Hallberg is an intelligent writer, but he’s a wild and frequently sloppy one. His narratives don’t click into gear; his curveball only sometimes makes it over the plate ... There is little sense of momentum; the pages never turn themselves. It is so intensely written that it gave me a headache, as if I had been grinding my teeth. I was glad when it was over.\n\nMixed The New York Times We count on our best young fiction writers to bring us news from the digital nervous system. Honor Levy, in My First Book, a collection of stories that is indeed her first book, does so with special bite and élan ... She has a fine intake filter; her book unloads a ton of fresh writing. That’s the good news. The bad news is that she was encouraged to publish My First Book too soon. The falloff is steep between this book’s best stories and its lesser ones, a few of which I suspect were typed on a MacBook a long time ago ... In this collection’s finest work, Levy’s sentences are cold poetry of a sort.\n\nPositive The New York Times Unlike any economist’s memoir I have ever read ... The annihilating level of detail in Loury’s book convinces you that he is aiming for straight talk, even if candor and honesty aren’t quite the same thing. It’s among this book’s drawbacks that the two Glenn Lourys aren’t persuasively synthesized. Late Admissions is also about 100 pages too long. The writing can be haphazard ... You don’t finish Late Admissions particularly liking Loury, or admiring him. He’s sorry about a lot of the things he’s done. But it’s to his credit that he doesn’t gin up a false catharsis, a ready-made Today Show moment of abiding contrition.\n\nPan The New York Times Overwrought ... Put a few thousand sentences like these between hard covers, add wooden dialogue...and you have Blue Ruin ... I was surprised to find so little to admire in this novel.\n\nMixed The New York Times Book Review The essays are, by and large, as tweedy and self-satisfied as these lines make them sound. There are no wild hairs in them, no sudden deepenings of tone. Nothing is at stake.\n\nPositive The New York Times Book Review Schwartz’s poems, especially the later ones, are dated ... There is something more important to talk about. Unearthed here is Schwartz’s masterpiece, a two-part autobiographical poem in free verse, \\\"Genesis,\\\" which he worked on for more than a decade. It’s so squirming and alive that it will, I suspect, be the rock upon which future considerations of Schwartz will stand.\n\nMixed The New York Times Book Review Alas, Reese does not explain his editing process — how he winnowed six boxes of material down to a 152-page book that still contains a lot of filler and close-to-meaningless verbiage ... As an editor, Reese writes sensitively about Rollins’s music but somehow never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity. His introduction does not mention Rollins’s drug use and other troubles. His endnotes are sparse.\n\nPositive The New York Times \\\"...candid, plain-spoken and gripping ... I’ve rarely read about worse physical trauma ... This is not, it must be said, the most elegant book. It does not have the emotional, intellectual and philosophical richness of the journalist Philippe Lançon’s memoir Disturbance (2019), about surviving the 2015 Charlie Hebdo magazine attacks by thugs claiming allegiance to Al Qaeda. But Rushdie was wise to largely stick to the details and stay out of his story’s way. To paraphrase Roy Blount Jr., I put this book down only once or twice, to wipe off the sweat ... Humor bubbles up organically from pain ... Knife is a clarifying book. It reminds us of the threats the free world faces. It reminds us of the things worth fighting for.\\\n\nRave The New York Times \\\"Because this is a Percival Everett novel, we are not surprised that he tears down and rebuilds a cultural landmark ... Because this is a Percival Everett novel, too, it luxuriates in language. Everett, like Twain, is a master of American argot; he is the code switcher’s code switcher. In James, he puts his skills to incandescent use ... What sets James above Everett’s previous novels, as casually and caustically funny as many are, is that here the humanity is turned up — way up. This is Everett’s most thrilling novel, but also his most soulful. Beneath the wordplay, and below the packed dirt floor of Everett’s moral sensibility, James is an intensely imagined human being ... My ideal of hell would be to live with a library that contained only reimaginings of famous novels. It’s a wet-brained and dutiful genre, by and large...James is the rarest of exceptions. It should come bundled with Twain’s novel. It is a tangled and subversive homage, a labor of rough love ... Everett shoots what is certain to be this book’s legion of readers straight through the heart.\\\n\nRave The New York Times It takes focus and discipline and a certain single-mindedness to become a good prize fighter. It takes those same qualities to write a book as fresh and strong and sinuous as Headshot ... Make room, American fiction, for a meaningful new voice ... To remark that Bullwinkel is observant about Reno and its casinos would be an understatement ... There is no whimsy in Headshot. Instead, there is astringency ... The impact of this novel, though, lasts a long time, like a sharp fist to your shoulder. It is so enveloping to read that you feel, at times, that you are writing it in your own mind.\n\nRave The New York Times Book Review A well-made disco ball of a book — it’s big, discursive, ardent, intellectual and flecked with gossip ... Romano, who worked at The Voice for eight years in its later stages, clearly asked good questions, and she has a snappy sense of conversational rhythm ... The tone of The Freaks Came Out to Write is a symphonic kind of anarchy.\n\nPositive The New York Times It is competent and professional, as if built from solid pine and good plaster. It is dispassionate and well researched. Reading it is brutal because McCullers’s life was brutal to endure ... earborn’s style is clean; we’re in a doctor’s office or a museum, and McCullers’s life is in a lighted display box ... A necessary book, though. It builds on Carr’s work and considers newly released material, including letters and journals and, most tantalizingly, transcripts of McCullers’s late-life psychiatric sessions with the female doctor who would become her lover and gatekeeper.\n\nRave The New York Times This book is buoyant and crunchy from end to end ... Trillin’s understatement matters because through it he resolves the traumas of life into humane comedy ... Maybe he included this lesser stuff for the same reason he once proposed that The New Yorker intentionally print one cartoon in each issue that isn’t funny.\n\nRave The New York Times Book Review Her memoir is moving for many reasons, but primarily for its observations about aging and vanity, as seen through the separated colors of a prismatic lens ... Vividly written ... One of the things that make this memoir convincing is that it is, on a certain level, unconvincing. Sante is a writer with a lot of peripheral vision ... It’s a story worth following, to watch her ring the bells that will still ring. Her sharpness and sanity, moodiness and skepticism are the appeal.\n\nRave The New York Times Powerful and intimate ... The book is made up of Heti’s frank, funny, filthy and casually philosophical diaries, 10 years of them ... The effect is riveting ... Heti is wrestling openly with the things that matter.\n\nRave The New York Times Not wet but dry. It is also short, strange, spiky and sublime. It’s a historical novel, a great speckled bird of a story, set in 1519 in what is now Mexico City. Empires are in collision and the vibe is hallucinatory ... Enrigue wears his influences on his sleeve.\n\nMixed The New York Times An atrocity exhibition. Butler taps a vein of garish and almost comic malevolence that keeps flowing ... It’s a disordered book, almost Lovecraftian at times in its airless luridness. By the end, the writing has become both tedious and odious. But the first 125 pages or so are electric and sharply observed ... He is unsparing about Brodak’s flaws, but his tone is warm and sympathetic. If you squint, you can see this tell-all, train-wreck memoir as an act of love ... My feelings about this book are mixed, but I won’t forget reading it. It makes you look up at the sky, fearful of what might fall out of it.\n\nPan The New York Times Fitzgerald has proved to be a difficult subject for biographers ... Academic language creeps like mold into this biography ... Tick clearly reveres Fitzgerald’s music, but her prose is buttoned-up. She can’t quite transmit her enthusiasms or make her distinctions stick ... It’s poor sportsmanship, perhaps, to write about what isn’t in a book as opposed to what is. But even browsing a Sotheby’s catalog of Fitzgerald memorabilia auctioned in 1997 gives you a deeper sense of her personal style than Tick manages to convey.\n\nRave The New York Times Masterly ... Robust ... If you don’t live within 100 miles of a real Chinese restaurant, or an H Mart, this book will not only entertain and instruct you — it might make you go mad with longing.\n\nRave The New York Times Animals and uncomfortable topics: Count on these in a Sigrid Nunez novel. Her slim, discursive, minor yet charming new one, The Vulnerables, is no exception ... This one comes across as a Covid diary, with a light scaffolding of incident to hold its meditations up. The narrator’s interactions with the parrot are funny and moving ... I can do without animals, most of the time, in novels. But Nunez is a closer observer than most, and she is wittier ... Like certain storms, this novel churns intensely in one place. There is a bit more plot ... I am committed, until one of us dies, to Nunez’s novels. I find them ideal. They are short, wise, provocative, funny — good and strong company ... You don’t have to follow her all the way, and start digging the novel’s grave, to sense that she is onto something. It has always been true: Being told about life, by a perceptive writer, can be as good as, if not better than, being told a story.\n\nRave The New York Times The first 150 or so pages of Sonic Life describe this childhood and his early years in downtown Manhattan. Mostly, though, the opening chapters are about his listening habits ... This section is too long and impersonal, and I might have put the book down if I weren’t getting paid to keep going ... But the book gets much better ... Excellent ... One reason Moore is a good observer of the early years is that he’s a good observer of other people, always a good sign in a memoirist.\n\nPositive The New York Times I don’t believe a word of the filmmaker Werner Herzog’s new memoir ... But then, I’m not sure we’re supposed to take much of it at face value ... The bulk...consists of Herzog’s thoughts on the subjects that interest him, about which he has made movies or would like to ... This book has been translated from the German by the superb Michael Hofmann. But every so often the language is awkward ... This book will be a boon to those people who, after dinner, sometimes like to unwind by reading choice morsels from books aloud. There are some instant classics here.\n\nRave The New York Times A book I would have tracked down even if this weren’t my job ... Lively and bittersweet ... This is really two books that are stacked, like mozzarella and tomato, in one pile. The first is a sharp memoir about illness and recovery ... The sections about his parents are most alive as a love story.\n\nPan The New York Times Sludgy, claustrophobic and pretentious. Each succeeding paragraph took something out of me ... When the Jorie Graham-like gauziness dissipates, when the fog lifts, what’s left are sentimentalities and near banalities ... Maybe Phillips’s early books were simply there when I needed them. But I need them still, and I didn’t need this one.\n\nPositive The New York Times Gravid ... A simple thread on which to hang beads of perception. Coetzee, who is 83, retains a sure touch. This is a convincing late-period novel. If it doesn’t rank with this Nobelist’s finest work, it is no embarrassment. It’s a pared-down book that avoids the excess philosophizing that has dragged down some of his more recent novels.\n\nRave The New York Times Episodic this biography is. It’s also vastly entertaining ... Reads a bit like one of McMurtry’s novels. Elegy and humor bleed into each other. This biography contains many sentences that verge on the humorous ... He rakes his material into a story that has movement; he’s a good reader of the novels; he has an eye for anecdote and the telling quote ... Comprehensive.\n\nRave The New York Times The first comprehensive biography of this hipster magus. It tours his life without ever quite penetrating it. But it’s a knowing and thoughtful book ... He wrestles this material into a loose but sturdy form, as if he were moving a futon. He allows different sides of Smith’s personality to catch blades of sun. He brings the right mixture of reverence and comic incredulity to his task ... here’s a lot of material to tap into, and you’ll want to. Smith added a great deal to the national stock of peculiarity. He was the worm at the bottom of American culture’s mezcal bottle. You slam the glass down, because his experience still makes you feel alive.\n\nMixed The New York Times [Hartigan\\'s] book is an achievement: It’s solid and well reported. But it’s dutiful. It lacks ebullience and critical insight. The writing is slack and, by the second half, the clichés are falling so heavily you need a hat ... This book couldn’t have been easy to write ... Hartigan is adept at keeping the lines straight ... An imperfect book.\n\nPositive The New York Times Several of the stories are among his best; a few are midlevel Millhauser; a handful of others don’t rise above craft. So it goes with books of short stories ... Millhauser’s stories are often about cracks in everyday life, cracks that reveal other possibilities and other modes of living. Sometimes one soul journeys through them; sometimes there are hundreds ... When Millhauser is on, he hands you a periscope of his own unique design, and he allows you to really look and feel. You can bring your own allegory.\n\nPan The New York Times The sensuality of his fiction is frequently related to olfaction. Few living writers pay as much attention to smell as Khalifa does ... A tension between faith and reason plays out in each of these stories. This is a secular novel about religious madness. Lives are at stake ... Nadine Gordimer said in her Paris Review interview that she didn’t mind being puzzled when reading a novel. I don’t either, generally. But Khalifa goes to great lengths to frustrate his readers. This narrative shifts back and forth in time ... The intricacies of Khalifa’s plotting, and his occasional vagueness, have led critics to compare him to Faulkner. But Faulkner’s characters feel more real than those in No One Prayed Over Their Graves. They’re earthier. Khalifa’s too often flop between stereotypes — saints or sinners, lovers or fighters ... Khalifa buries his story under a late-Rushdie-like muchness, with embellishment upon embellishment. There are prophecies and rising souls and forbidden loves; every tear is bitterly wept. There are conversions and renunciations of conversions. Your eyeballs begin to glaze over, as if they were ceramic plates. Everything is desperate, to paraphrase the old Adam Ant song, but somehow not serious.\n\nRave The New York Times Her best in more than two decades ... The stories are about instability and shattered certainties ... An almost comically wide cast of characters ... The rap against Beattie, in sum, is that her work can be aimless, \\'twee,\\' lacking in political and other convictions, plotless, a bit draggy. All feathers and no bird, marginalia in search of a thesis. She is too alert to the tender souls of the bolshy bourgeoisie, stirring groats on their Viking ranges. All these things are true at times, even in Onlookers. This book reminds you, more often, of why readers cared about her in the first place. She’s a dry yet earthy writer, in touch with moods and manners, with an eye for passing comedy ... She takes notes on her species, as if she were a naturalist observing robins. She pries at the mystery of life. There’s a strong feeling of convergence in her best stories.\n\nMixed The New York Times Fluky, fitfully funny and folk-horror-adjacent ... I did sometimes think about how I’d rank it ... Moore is a consummate user of the English language; her moisture-wicking sentences confirm and reconfirm your sanity. So many of them you want to frame and hang. But when her books don’t work, they can seem especially futile ... In terms of the other fiction published so far this year, I Am Homeless if This Is Not My Home is an easy A. In terms of Moore’s own high standards, it’s a C at best ... You settle into the tone of this story. Move over, Hilary Mantel. That’s how good the opener is. There’s a bit of Cormac McCarthy’s recent cosmic-circus high jinks. Then a different story comes along to replace it. It’s as if you are a child again, and someone has stolen your hot dog ... Moore stretches for deeper themes in this novel, and of course they’re there: It’s a book about loss, and about the patience and endurance it takes to treat the dying with respect, and about the shaggy and multiform varieties of love. But it’s more about the jokes.\n\nMixed The New York Times Be Mine is not unlike a welcome late-evening phone call, two scotches in, from an old friend. Ford’s readers have been through a lot with this man ... And yet ... Be Mine isn’t shoddy, exactly, but it’s the thinnest and least persuasive of the Bascombe novels. The seams in these books have begun to show ... There’s a long, odd, uncomfortable interlude in Be Mine during which Frank falls half in love with a much younger Vietnamese woman ... The Bascombe novels have never felt especially up-to-date, culturally. Not everyone cares about pop culture, and Frank has a right to be among those who don’t. But what culture Ford does tuck into Be Mine feels random and unlikely ... God forbid he loses his sense of humor, but to paraphrase late-career Leonard Cohen, I want it darker.\n\nRave The New York Times A cathartic leak of a novel, a beautiful bummer, and the floodgates open early ... If Kairos were only a tear-jerker, there might not be much more to say about it. But Erpenbeck, a German writer born in 1967 whose work has come sharply to the attention of English-language readers over the past decade, is among the most sophisticated and powerful novelists we have. Clinging to the undercarriage of her sentences, like fugitives, are intimations of Germany’s politics, history and cultural memory ... She is writing more closely to her own unconscious ... I don’t generally read the books I review twice, but this one I did ... Profound and moving.\n\nRave The New York Times Book Review NB skewered pomposity in its many forms ... NB is the sort of column that people looked at and thought, \\\"I could do that.\\\" Turns out they couldn’t. I still read NB every week with pleasure, but absent J.C., the column has lost a sliver of its freshness and nerve.\n\nRave The New York Times Book Review Easily Slip Into Another World is so good a music memoir, in the serious and obstinate manner of those by Miles Davis and Gil Scott-Heron, that it belongs on a high shelf alongside them ... A lot of attention is paid to Threadgill’s own failures, large and small. This is among the reasons that this memoir is the kind of book I’d want to place in the hands of young musicians ... Threadgill writes ardently about the barriers Black composers and classical musicians have faced. He also refuses, most of the time, to ratify the borders between classical music and jazz.\n\nRave The New York Times The first comprehensive biography of King in three decades. It draws on a landslide of recently released White House telephone transcripts, F.B.I. documents, letters, oral histories and other material, and it supplants David J. Garrow’s 1986 biography Bearing the Cross as the definitive life of King, as Garrow himself deposed recently ... It’s a clean, clear, journalistic voice, one that employs facts the way Saul Bellow said they should be employed, each a wire that sends a current. He does not dispense two-dollar words; he keeps digressions tidy and to a minimum; he jettisons weight, on occasion, for speed. He appears to be so in control of his material that it is difficult to second-guess him ... This is a very human, and quite humane, portrait ... Eig is adept at weaving in other characters, and other voices. He makes it plain that King was not acting in a vacuum, and he traces the work of organizations like the N.A.A.C.P., CORE and SNCC ... Eig’s book is worthy of its subject.\n\nPositive The New York Times Old family stories are hard to revivify, even when they’re good family stories ... This is the problem Ava Chin is up against in her sensitive, ambitious, well-reported, heavily peopled yet curiously remote memoir-cum-history ... It’s a book that has everything going for it except that intangible spark that crisp and confident storytelling throws off. The air is a bit still in this book, as if one is walking behind the docent on a long museum tour ... The story has a certain pageantry ... This memoir evokes emotion but, as with the made-up dialogue, Chin sometimes doesn’t trust her readers to absorb it on their own.\n\nPositive The New York Times Book Review The funny thing about Biography of a Phantom is, after you wade through the trigger warnings, how earnest and low-key and appealing McCormick’s manuscript is ... This is a human and humane book, an insightful exploration of the biographer’s craft ... McCormick’s book is no longer unseen, nor is it a masterpiece. But, reading it, you feel as though you’ve met a real writer, one who had a lot going for himself and let it all slip away.\n\nPositive The New York Times Judge a party not by who’s there, the old credo goes, but by who isn’t. The missing voices include those of O-Lan Jones, Shepard’s first wife; his longtime partner, Jessica Lange; his lovers Patti Smith and Brooke Adams and Joni Mitchell ... Greenfield’s book is faithful to Shepard’s life, while it skips like a stone along the surface. Shepard spent much time laying down cover, and tending to his own mythology ... Greenfield is a prolific journeyman biographer who has written the lives of Jerry Garcia, Bill Graham, Timothy Leary and Burt Bacharach, among others. His Shepard book lacks a certain density, and a critical sensibility, but it’s well organized and cleanly written. It neatly covers the bases ... Shepard’s is a hard life to screw up, and Greenfield doesn’t. His writing about the playwright’s final years is detailed and moving.\n\nMixed The New York Times Book Review A Brief History of Living Forever has an electric start, but after about 80 pages I wanted to slide it under a pile of magazines ... Kalfar’s dystopia feels thirdhand. Happily, he has other things to work with ... He has a Kurt Vonnegut-like satirical touch, at his best, as well as Vonnegut’s interest in science. He also has an old-world melancholy, beneath the humor ... The rest of the novel combines flashbacks to Adela’s past... with scenes of her two children trying to rescue her body from a black-ops warehouse in Florida, in order to give it a proper burial. There are bad guys with guns, and suddenly we’re in a Jason Statham movie. Kalfar’s wit has burned off entirely.\n\nPositive The New York Times \\\"The narrator of Biography of X...has a cool tone and a lonely intelligence; she’s a solitary spirit. Her voice is clear but worn, like beach glass. There’s some early Renata Adler in it, and some Janet Malcolm...C.M.’s voice, with its withdrawn quality and intimations of ruin, is an odd one to preside over a novel this sprawling and ambitious, this strange and dystopian and vividly imagined. Biography of X reimagines the American century while tapping into our evergreen fascination with the downtown art world between 1970 and 1995. It’s a hard book to get a handle on ... This is a magpie novel, one that borrows snatches of text, that tinkers with reputations, that moves historical figures around in time ... By its second half, Biography of X has begun to drag somewhat. We follow C.M. on interview after interview, and the form is too conventional; all that’s missing is a Peter Coyote voice-over ... But you will already be locked in. This is a major novel, and a notably audacious one. Lacey is pulling from a deep reservoir...This book is about facing, and accepting, the things you didn’t want to know.\\\n\nPositive The New York Times Book Review Humanizing details pile up ... This book’s self-consciousness, as an art project, saps some of its immediacy. Belorusets’s prose, in this translation by Greg Nissan, lacks depth and grain ... It’s interesting to witness the way Belorusets thinks about the enemy. She despises what’s happening to her country, and she deplores some Russian soldiers who are drunks and louts. But she’s aware that so many of them have been lied to about what they’re doing in Ukraine. She considers compassion and its limits.\n\nRave The New York Times A big book, a sophisticated page-turner, that does something improbable: It filters anarchist, monkey-wreching environmental politics, a generational (anti-baby boomer) cri de coeur and a downhill-racing plot through a Stoppardian sense of humor. The result is thrilling. Birnam Wood nearly made me laugh with pleasure. The whole thing crackles, like hair drawn through a pocket comb ... Catton has felt like the real thing out of the gate. One reason is her way with dialogue. Her characters are almost disastrously candid. They talk the way real people talk, but they’re freer, ruder, funnier. Alongside the wordplay and in-jokes, and the topping of those jokes, unexpected abrasions pile up. You sense the world being thrashed out in front of your eyes ... Another reason is her knowingness — her thinginess. Catton is at home in the physical world, and her details land ... Finally, there is Catton’s generosity, to her characters and to her readers. She turns her men and women around and around in appraisal, allowing the available light to alternately flatter and roast them ... An ardent ecological novel, but it’s not a softheaded one. That’s another reason it’s a rarity.\n\nPan The New York Times Verges on becoming an insanity trip ... An unusual prison novel. The stakes are low throughout ... What is Yarmysh up to here? At moments the tone verges on the comic...and you sense the author gently pushing the material into satire. But it’s hard to say, because her abilities as a fiction writer are, at least in this translation, rudimentary. Anya may be filled with irony and ambiguity, but Yarmysh’s writing is not. The characters are two-dimensional; the prose offers few, if any, fresh perceptions; the tone never deepens. From nearly the start, it’s as if Yarmysh is trying to light a green log. If only the most impressively brave among us were the best writers! The world seldom works that way ... It must have hurt to translate something that seems as flat as Yarmysh’s novel does. As the clichés piled up...I began to wonder if Tait had let fidelity trample generosity and sensibility. Another translator might have reached out to Yarmysh and, assuming the clichés were in the original, asked if she really wanted to hang onto them.\n\nMixed The New York Times Nesbit, the super agent whose clients have included Joan Didion... is portrayed so coolly in this book that the pages about her almost shatter as you turn them. It’s a devastating portrait ... At its best, this memoir evokes a shaggy lost world.\n\nPositive The New York Times Light, charming and shyly philosophical ... In The Guest Lecture, Keynes is a prop for a novel that’s barely a novel. (The other characters are sketched, as if they were James Thurber drawings, in a gentle line or two.) Riker pulls it off because he’s observant, and he has a grainy, semi-comic feel for what angst and failure really feel like ... In Riker’s hands, Abigail is good company, and sometimes for a novel that’s enough.\n\nPositive The New York Times A bit chaotic, as oral histories tend to be. But the chaos feels true to the experience of prison; this impressive book throws a lot at you, and much of the reading is difficult ... Intensely moving.\n\nRave The New York Times The new volume, in a sensitive and briskly idiomatic translation by Ross Benjamin, offers revelation upon revelation. It’s an invaluable addition to Kafka’s oeuvre ... This edition scuffs him up and returns him to earth, in an intimate manner that does no injury to our sense of his suffering, or his profound and original gifts.\n\nMixed The New York Times A luxe thriller...that rides the line between commercial and literary fiction so adroitly that it will almost certainly move a lot of units, as I’ve heard publishers say about their best sellers ... It’s easy to see why attention has been paid. As a storyteller, Kapoor is a natural. Her novel offers the pleasures of narrative dexterity. It moves — early on, at any rate — as if on rails ... She does not offer, except rarely, the pleasures of subtlety. Over more than 500 pages, the book’s sleekness bends toward slickness and the magic toward tricks. Its length really hurts it. What might have been a crisp and moody entertainment, in Graham Greene’s elevated sense of that word, distends ... The characters (conflicted journalist, wealthy man’s dilettante son, wide-eyed boy from the sticks) are familiar. The politics are not delicate. A Mercedes rams into five poor people, including a pregnant woman, on the first page ... On Audible, the book might really lift the burden of a cross-country car trip. But it doesn’t make you a snob to want more from a novel than you would get from a good evening of Netflix. I kept reading, sometimes admiringly, but mentally I checked out around page 75 ... Kapoor has a cinematic eye. This novel has a lot of moments that feel lush and screenplay-ready ... She can be a perceptive writer, one who has plenty to say about modern Delhi and the conditions that spawned and that sustain the Wadia crime syndicate ... But as Age of Vice rolls on, the exigencies of plot trample whatever flowers, in the form of complexities, attempt to bloom.\n\nPositive The New York Times Cormac McCarthy, who is pushing 90, has arrived with a pair of audacious linked novels, one a total banger and the other no embarrassment. If this is what it sounds like to be on your last legs, young writers should ask their server for whatever he’s having. If McCarthy’s voice is any indication, he’s still limber enough to outrun an aggrieved cheetah in his drawers and stocking feet ... Novels aren’t made, generally, to be filled entirely by talk. But that’s what Stella Maris is — transcriptions of therapy sessions with one of the hospital’s shrinks. This is a Tom Stoppardesque bull session. Does it work? Uh-huh. Does it work more fully if you’ve already read The Passenger? Absolutely ... Stella Maris is, by comparison, a small and frequently elegiac novel. It’s best read while you are still buzzing from the previous book. Its themes are dark ones, and yet it brings you home.\n\nPositive The New York Times Smart and sympathetic but hardheaded ... McBride’s book follows Chris Kraus’s 2017 biography, After Kathy Acker. Kraus is a powerfully original writer, and her book is quirkier ... McBride is more dispassionate.\n\nMixed The New York Times Book Review ... is — how to put this gently? — not a good book of letters. If le Carré had close friendships, they’re not on display here. His tone throughout is bluff but guarded and ambassadorial. Nearly everyone is kept at arm’s length. He has an epistolary gift for writing much but saying little ... Many are bread and butter notes, a hard form to shock to life ... The book is, to echo James, thicker than it should be, as if to justify its steep ($40) price point at Christmastime. The margins are wide, the typeface large. There are many chapter breaks, and many pages with only a sentence or two on them. Le Carré’s baronial address, repeated at the top of his letters, eats up a lot of space on nearly every page by itself ... The editor is cagey about whether le Carré wanted his letters published. He did curate them, choosing which ones to file. He also burned many. He wrote them by hand, in the afternoons, after writing fiction in the morning and taking a midday walk ... There are memorable details ... Le Carré and his wife, Jane, kept a guest cottage on their property, and the letters to prospective visitors are worthwhile ... The only time these letters got to me was at the end. Both le Carré and his wife had cancer during Covid lockdown.\n\nMixed The New York Times Book Review ... devious ... These riffs, which he flicks like tarot cards through a distant cactus, sound a lot like his own song lyrics, so much so that part of me wanted this to be a new record instead, wanted to hear these lines come croaking up from Dylan’s 81-year-old lungs and past his buckshot, barb-wired uvula ... Who else sounds like this? Dylan slits open the underbelly of American life; he pokes at the entrails; he draws a lot out of these songs. It’s total warfare against the humdrum, and it’s completely great, except for when it isn’t. The tone becomes repetitive. In a lot of the cases, you could switch Dylan’s commentaries around, apply them to different songs and not know the difference. By the end he seems spent; he’s phoning some of the language in ... You keep reading because it’s Dylan, because there’s always an eerie little gas station, an Indian casino, an itinerant preacher or a syphilitic old madam around the next corner. You want to know what condition Dylan’s condition is in. Probably he’s about to release a bladderful of P.B.R. on somebody’s grave ... God, this book is sly ... Dylan is helplessly epigrammatic ... The humor in The Philosophy of Modern Song trips over, often enough, into full-on gaslighting ... It’s been art-directed to its back teeth. The photo researcher deserves all the best legal drugs for Christmas. It’s filled with vintage movie stills and Life magazine covers and car ads and pulpy detective images, some more clever than others, the kinds of things you might find on the walls of a self-consciously retro diner ... I respect the work that went into it, but the photos sometimes crowded me out ... This book is about a genius recognizing unfiltered genius in others, when he can find it. Often enough it’s an argument for simplicity.\n\nPan The New York Times Book Review ... fantastically dull ... It’s unclear if Rickman wanted these diaries published. I bet he would not have. They aren’t embarrassing, but the entries are rarely fleshed out. Much of it reads like an aide-memoire, quickly jotted notes one might return to later for a different sort of book ... Nothing here can be held against him, but they’re a bit depressing, these diaries ... Not a lot of light shines through the windowpanes ... He saw so much but described so little ... It’s possible to go through this book, as if with a metal detector, and retrieve shreds of tabloid coin ... Rickman isn’t good at capturing his fellow humans in a few crunchy words. He’s better on other topics ... In the manner that it takes a large ground crew to put a single fighter pilot in the air, it takes a large company of humans to move a famous actor through his days: makeup and clothing and sets and black cars and interview requests and tickets and reservations and all the rest. I wish Rickman had something, anything, to say about these people, and these processes. He glides as if on a magic carpet ... The last months of entries are moving not because Rickman relates much about his treatment, or his hopes and fears. They are moving because he realizes he’s lived so fast and hard that he’s never had time to look back, to savor it all ... a reminder that, as Simone de Beauvoir wrote, \\'What an odd thing a diary is: The things you omit are more important than those you put in.\\'\n\nPositive The New York Times Book Review ... exists in a liminal zone between poetry and prose. It can resemble a sophisticated children’s bedtime story ... This dichotomy, the idea that the world can be divided neatly into people who lead with their hearts and those who lead with their heads, can feel reductive. Yet Glück, in shrinking the world to the size of a pair of blankets inside cribs, manages to gently pack her narrative with feeling ... Glück wrings more emotion than you might imagine out of a father’s going and coming home from work every day ... A cynic might call this a children’s book for very pretentious children. You can imagine it with red and black illustrations by Barbara Kruger, with oracular phrases printed in that artist’s signature typeface ... This is a delicate, minor-key book. It addresses, in larval and thus primal form, many of the concerns of Glück’s poetry.\n\nPositive The New York Times Grittier than anything we\\'ve read about [Bourdain] before ... Here are exact, disturbing details about his suicide. His heroin habit is recounted. So is his frequent coldness to many who loved and worked with him ... Leerhsen’s book...has a lot of people trying to join Bourdain on the couch, ideally without his trousers, and thus has more adrenaline and feels truer to life ... He’s not here, though, to discredit or dismiss his subject. His admiration for Bourdain is nearly always apparent. It’s hard to say if Bourdain would have liked this book. Either way, I suspect he would have admired the author’s guts ... Down and Out in Paradise is not the most subtle thing you’ll ever read ... His Bourdain book goes down like a mass-market rock bio ... I’d have loved it if I were 17 ... The older me, the one who prefers wine to fizz, wishes Leerhsen had more to say about things like: a) the elite and vernacular food worlds pre- and post-Bourdain; b) how Bourdain walked a moral tightrope across the conventions of travel writing and reporting, no mean feat for a wealthy white man in skinny jeans; and c) the sense that he was at the vanguard, more so than even the most scrutinized actors, of a new type of American masculinity ... You can’t have everything. Leerhsen sacrifices weight for speed ... This book doesn’t merely light candles but scuffs him up. I doubt it will be the final word.\n\nPositive New York Times The sex is torrid, and described with a lemony eye for detail ... The almost primitive directness of her voice is bracing. It’s as if she’s carving each sentence onto the surface of a table with a knife. She is, in her writing, definitely not the sort of girl whose bicycle has a basket ... Not tweaked in postproduction ... The bedroom scenes are bulldozing ... This book is an anthology of her projected anxieties. Her heart is some sort of nocturnal beast ... Getting Lost is a feverish book. It’s about being impaled by desire, and about the things human beings want, as opposed to the things for which they settle. Is it a major book? Probably not. But it’s one of those books about loneliness that, on every page, makes you feel less alone.\n\nPan The New York Times ... the book is so laden with odd convergences and there are so many brushes with demons that it does leave you feeling tiny and weird ... This book review is going to have a disappointed tone that probably isn’t fair to Serpell. She so thoroughly raised expectations with her first novel, The Old Drift (2019), that The Furrows can’t help but seem to follow halfheartedly in its wake ... an atmospheric literary novel not so different from others of its kind ... Serpell is interested in effects here more than in truth dealing. With its scrutiny of doubles, of doppelgängers, of déjà vu, of parallel existences, of the transmigration of souls, of hints of incest, of shifting points of view, the book is a mind-twist (The word I am after isn’t printable) ... It may make you think of the work of filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan and Jordan Peele and, in her latest, Olivia Wilde — alas, not always in a good way ... Serpell intelligently appraises race and class ... These spaces are emotional amphitheaters; they turn me into an eager groundling, waiting to see what news a writer has to bring. In the case of The Furrows, I was let down every time, doubly so because I know what a shrewd observer Serpell can be ... has stuck with me for three years. The Furrows mostly vanished a few hours after I put it down. But I can’t imagine picking up her next one with any less eagerness.\n\nRave New York Times Life’s Work is one of the best books about television I’ve read. It’s funny, discursive, literate, druggy, self-absorbed, fidgety, replete with intense perceptions ... Anyone who works in mass culture should read it... probably ... Writing dialogue as sharply as he does, his book suggests, requires a heroin habit straight out of a Denis Johnson short story, a ruinous gambling addiction, an ability to stretch deadlines to their dissolving point, an ego that can shatter buffet platters at 30 feet, and a knack for making others love you and want you poisoned at the same time ... What warms this book, and gives it a long view of life, is that it was completed while its author was suffering from the early effects of Alzheimer’s ... He goes deep on a lot of things ... Life’s Work does get a bit fuzzy toward the end. The pearls begin to lack adequate stringing. This feels natural, part of the human drama. You finish feeling you’ve really met someone. Milch was his own best creation.\n\nPan The New York Times ... this historical novel is verging on the steamy and operatic ... Hamnet wasn’t ridiculous in the way that The Marriage Portrait is ridiculous; at its best it was an affecting portrait of grief. But it too went in for lush atmospherics, for a lot of rustling leaves, for creating scenes that longed to be bowers of enchantment ... It, too, had few sharp perceptions, little wit and little humble sense of life as it is lived down near the ground. Reading each I pined instead — for the reason one goes to a good restaurant — something simple and unpretending ... Murder and unwanted sex are primal drivers of narrative. In this novel the characters are so one-dimensional and overwrought that the force of neither driver lands. The novelist begins to resemble a conjurer forcing cards.\n\nPan New York Times It’s a title that, in its thoroughgoing lack of self-awareness, matches this book’s contents ... He betrays little cognizance that he was in demand because, as a landslide of other reporting has demonstrated, he was in over his head, unable to curb his avarice, a cocky young real estate heir who happened to unwrap a lot of Big Macs beside his father-in-law ... Breaking History is an earnest and soulless — Kushner looks like a mannequin, and he writes like one — and peculiarly selective appraisal of Donald J. Trump’s term in office. Kushner almost entirely ignores the chaos, the alienation of allies, the breaking of laws and norms, the flirtations with dictators, the comprehensive loss of America’s moral leadership ... This book is like a tour of a once majestic 18th-century wooden house, now burned to its foundations, that focuses solely on, and rejoices in, what’s left amid the ashes ... Reading this book reminded me of watching a cat lick a dog’s eye goo ... The tone is college admissions essay ... Kushner, poignantly, repeatedly beats his own drum ... A therapist might call these cries for help ... The bulk of Breaking History — at nearly 500 pages, it’s a slog — goes deeply into the weeds ... What a queasy-making book to have in your hands.\n\nMixed The New York Times I am not uninterested in the reservoir system, but I (probably) would not have picked this book up if someone else had written it. I’ve followed Sante’s work for decades, the way you follow a band, because her writing has an unmistakable and addictive tone ... while Nineteen Reservoirs is a beautiful object — the period photographs and postcards are expertly reproduced and glow with feeling, and the book concludes with an apposite photo essay by Tim Davis — that elusive tone only rarely emerges ... This is a static and somewhat repetitive book that lacks a narrative through line. Sante seldom makes the kinds of connections and associations she does in her best work. And yet: Her semi-failures have more going for them than most writer’s successes ... Sante has always had an underdog’s left-of-the-dial feeling for what’s been threatened or lost. The best material in Nineteen Reservoirs is about the people who had their land confiscated, in colonial fashion, and submerge.\n\nPositive The New York Times A new miscellany that includes depictions of his mental illness, reminiscences of peers including Anne Sexton, John Berryman, Randall Jarrell, Sylvia Plath, Allen Tate and Hannah Arendt, and other twigs and seeds, many seeing print for the first time ... Does the world need Memoirs? ... The argument I will make for Memoirs is this: It’s densely yet nimbly written, and you sense Lowell’s judgment and discrimination in every paragraph. As with nearly everything he wrote, there’s a sense of wheels within wheels ... Memoirs is evocative, and sly, in its assessment of Lowell’s Boston Brahmin family ... This book’s editors, Steven Gould Axelrod and Grzegorz Kosc, silently and deftly amend, in their footnotes, Lowell’s many small errors of fact, and point out where he seems to have invented characters. There’s a whole other book going on down there in the footnotes ... Reading Memoirs is like finding a roll of undeveloped film from 1954. Lowell rode these sentences into new ways of thinking and writing. There were riddles of existence that, clearly, he was only beginning to shake down.\n\nMixed New York Times The first half of Other Names for Love is the best half ... Soomro writes clean, vivid sentences and this novel has a certain elegance, but it lacks a worldview and the kind of drilling insights that would take it to another level ... I did not stop, once, to pencil a curse word of admiration in the margins, which sometimes means nothing but sometimes means a lot. When the second half begins to drift, the absence of electric drive-by observation and intellection becomes more apparent.\n\nMixed The New York Times Murata’s prose is deadpan, as clear as cellophane, and has the tidiness of a bento box. She’s not the most subtle writer. You don’t read her for her extra-fine perceptual apparatus. You read her because when her stuff works, it’s chilly and transgressive at the same time ... A few of the stories are quite long; others are vignettes. A handful are banal...Even in her best stories, Murata has a weakness for thesis statements ... Murata’s prose, in this translation from the Japanese by Ginny Tapley Takemori, is generally so cool you could chill a bottle of wine in it. Body Magic is warmer, and more subtle. It made me wonder if she really needs the big-time conceits.\n\nPan New York Times Book Review If you removed phrases like \\'no clear account exists,\\' \\'we can’t be sure,\\' \\'a curious silence,\\' \\'it’s possible that,\\' \\'complete absence of documentation,\\' \\'appears to,\\' \\'seems likely\\' and \\'questions abound,\\' Seymour’s biography would shrink by 10 percent. These locutions clutter Seymour’s book, especially since what we do know of Rhys’s life and career is, if not encyclopedic, a good deal ... Seymour is the author of many well-regarded biographies, including those of Mary Shelley, Robert Graves and Lord Byron’s wife and daughter. This one has, somehow, gotten away from her. It’s curiously lackluster ... On the one hand, it’s breezy — the sort of biography in which the author prints a snapshot of herself outside a school Rhys attended, and describes chatting up various locals on her researches ... On the other hand, it’s mean-spirited ... The prose and analysis are soft. Seymour leaves out so many of the best things Rhys wrote and said, and thus makes her seem less intelligent than she was. She lingers over Rhys’s intense interest in her own appearance, even quite late in life, for example, without noting that Rhys wrote that such an interest is \\'the real curse of Eve\\' ... Seymour has some material previous biographers didn’t. But the details in her book are, sentence by sentence and page by page, less piquant than the ones in Angier’s ... Rhys had a uniquely lonely intelligence, and a talent for facing hard truths. If all you know of her is Wide Sargasso Sea, this book will encourage you to branch out. That’s nearly — almost, maybe — worth the price of admission.\n\nPan New York Times Ottessa Moshfegh has a glittering intellect and an unquenchable dark turn of mind. Only the latter is on display in Lapvona, her fourth novel. It’s a pungent book but a flat one, narrow in its emotional range, a bleak, meandering and muddy-soled mix of fairy tale and folk horror ... Atrocities pile up. It’s easy to lose the thread ... It’s especially easy for concentration to wander because no one is quite who they seem to be, and because little that occurs has much in the way of resonance. I’m peeking at my notes to write this because it all blurred in my mind ... vigorously if bluntly written. The sentences seem to have been composed in lead type and locked into a letterpress. What’s gone missing is Moshfegh’s destroying wit ... the novel lacks an attitude, a stance toward this material ... No one tattoos the page with food horror quite like Moshfegh ... Moshfegh is one of the most interesting writers alive, but Lapvona is a gloomy, punishing and curiously flavorless banquet.\n\nPositive New York Times A wise, mild and enviably lucid book about a chaotic scene ... Is it OK to out your kid like this? ... Still, this memoir will seem like a better idea if, a few decades from now, Raffi is happy and healthy and can read it aloud to his own kids while chuckling at what a little miscreant he was ... Gessen is a wily parser of children’s literature ... He is just as good on parenting manuals ... Raising Raffi offers glimpses of what it’s like to eke out literary lives at the intersection of the Trump and Biden administrations ... Needing money for one’s children, throughout history, has made parents do desperate things — even write revealing parenthood memoirs ... Gessen’s short book is absorbing not because it delivers answers ... It’s absorbing because Gessen is a calm and observant writer...who raises, and struggles with, the right questions about himself and the world.\n\nRave The New York Times Shipnuck can\\'t help tracing the arc of the Woods-Mickelson rivalry...Shipnuck is interested in Mickelson\\'s reputed dark side and why it keeps threatening to pop out from behind his carefully constructed nice-guy facade...Shipnuck digs more deeply into Mickelson’s gambling than anyone has so far...His addiction has led him to grow tight with dubious characters...He bets on football so heavily, Mickelson told a friend, that his bets \\'might move the line\\'...His gambling losses totaled more than $40 million from 2010 to 2014, according to documents reviewed by one of Shipnuck’s sources...Is his willingness to sign autographs forever, for example, the mark of a generous spirit or a \\'shameless brand-building exercise\\'?...Shipnuck considers arguments both ways...Golf turns people into bores, in my experience, but Mickelson does not seem like one. He’s convivial, and his conversation is not always about golf.\n\nRave The New York Times Gunn had been raised in Kent, England, where his parents were journalists...He arrived in America fresh from Cambridge, and his first book of poems, Fighting Terms, had been published to lively notice...When he got a look at San Francisco, he knew he’d found his place...Not only was it beautiful, in league with the \\'best European cities,\\' he wrote to a friend, but it was \\'incidentally the queerest city I’ve ever been in,\\' Gunn remained there for the rest of his life, living in the Haight and teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, eventually six months on and six off...That letter is among the hundreds collected in The Letters of Thom Gunn,\\' an appealing selection of his rowdy, funny, filthy, intensely literate letters...These details, in general, won’t surprise anyone who kept up with Gunn’s poetry, which was metrically sophisticated and dealt sometimes with earthy topics such as LSD, the Hell’s Angels, sex and its itchy discontents, and gay culture writ large...This book, like Gunn’s life, puts an unusual mix of pleasures on display...On the one hand, he had indestructible appetites for sex and drugs, together and separately...Typical sentences from this book are: \\'I woke up the next day surrounded by naked bodies and uniquely hungover\\' and \\'Remind me to tell you how I lost the hair on my ass\\'.\n\nRave New York Times The most indelible scene in American literary memoir, for this reader at any rate, occurs about two-thirds of the way into Harry Crews’s A Childhood ... It is a nearly Dickensian anthology of physical and mental intensities ... A Childhood is the best introduction to his work. It explains so much of where Crews was coming from in his blood-tinted fiction ... This memoir has a foot in another world, a weird, old Depression-era America. Crews writes with knowledge and feeling on a wide series of topics ... Harry Crews died in 2012 at the age of 76. His novels, which are mostly out of print, aren’t for everyone, despite my abiding fondness for several of them. This memoir is for everyone. It’s agile, honest and built as if to last. Like its author, it’s a resilient American original.\n\nPositive The New York Times This is a rich, florid, funny history, with undertones of human grief. Knight plays it very straight. His prose is measured and measured again. It’s as if Strunk and White took the manuscript on vacation and made buffing it a competition ... Knight does seem to have his tongue in his cheek at moments, but that tongue is buried so deeply it would require an oral surgeon to locate and extract it ... The good news is that Knight is shrewd and perceptive, and his book is as good as his article. The bad news is that his book is not a great deal better than his article. The short version was enough for me ... Knight’s portraits of Barker and Fairley are lively ... Knight’s book is crisp, almost clinically so. It’s on the passionless side. The crooked timber of humanity is cut into two-by-fours. Photographs are employed to profound, poetic effect.\n\nMixed New York Times The Trouble With Happiness, a collection of stories, and The Faces, a novel...consolidate but don’t greatly extend her reputation; neither quite makes the claims on you that the memoirs do ... This is a lurid crackup novel, too heavy-handed for my tastes, but I suspect a lot of readers will respond to it ... This is a promising setup, thematically; you want to soak in the brine as if it were a Marianne Faithfull album. But a sense of overkill emerges ... The constant return to the idea of faces — we all have more than one, they can appall, those of our friends turn strange — is heavy, too, but it does lead to a starkly comic moment, in the asylum.\n\nRave New York Times Batuman has a gift for making the universe seem, somehow, like the benevolent and witty literary seminar you wish it were ... an even better, more soulful novel. Selin is more confident and, more important, so is Batuman ... This novel wins you over in a million micro-observations ... When Selin does begin to have sex, she is so perceptive that the scenes are a wonder ... When you write as well as Batuman does, there are worse fates. But you wonder if the next two novels will recount Selin’s junior and senior years, in a Harvard quartet, and what would happen if Batuman kicked away from shore.\n\nPositive New York Times The Trouble With Happiness a collection of stories, and The Faces, a novel...don’t greatly extend her reputation; neither quite makes the claims on you that the memoirs do ... It’s easy to make these stories sound even bleaker than they are ... Yet as Martin Amis said, \\'Achieved art is quite incapable of lowering the spirits.\\' You sense, in these stories about miscarriages, cheating men, dinner parties gone wrong and frightened children, a writer pulling from a deep well, returning to familiar themes out of a deep compulsion, and that compulsion squeezes us too, in a kind of claustrophobic bliss-out, as if we’ve been inserted into one of Temple Grandin’s deep-pressure hug machines. The stories aren’t microfiction but, translated by Michael Favala Goldman, they’re really short—five or six pages each, somehow an ideal length.\n\nPositive New York Times This book reminds us how permanently interesting our bodies are, especially when they go wrong. Fisher’s account of his days is gripping. While reading, we are all, helplessly, medical voyeurs ... Fisher’s writing about his stream of patients is what gives this memoir its immediacy, its pulse ... His book derives its depth and tone from his arguments about the inequities of American health care. Fisher is moved, and infuriated, that so many African Americans die young because they lack access to decent insurance and treatment. His frustration, his outraged intelligence, is palpable on every page ... Fisher works out his aggravation by writing letters to some of his patients, explaining why he couldn’t spend more time with them, and why the health care system is so dismal for so many. These are long letters, and they appear in this book. I’m sorry to report that they don’t work; not really. The letters are a conceit, and they feel artificial, like exposition-filled movie dialogue ... Fisher remains a somewhat distant figure in The Emergency. He skips quickly through his own biography ... We don’t learn a lot about his private life now, either the small, earthy details or the things that seem to genuinely matter. What Fisher does provide is the best account I’ve read about working in a busy hospital during Covid ... Fisher locates beauty in a different part of the medical process.\n\nRave The New York Times Amy Bloom and Brian Ameche were a handsome couple. I know this not because there’s a photograph of them in Bloom’s new memoir ... I know this because I was so moved by Bloom’s bittersweet, truth-dealing book that I looked them up and read whatever I could find ... I’m not sure why I hadn’t until now read Bloom’s fiction. Maybe her soft, generic titles...were a deterrent. The title of this memoir is similar ... Not reading her: my loss. Bloom has one of those warm, wised-up, tolerantly misanthropic New York voices, in the manner of Laurie Colwin and Sloane Crosley and Allegra Goodman and Nora Ephron, and an ability to deepen her tone at will. I am not, as are these writers, Jewish. But when I read them I feel I’ve found my people ... Bloom tells this story with grace and tact. Scenes of their trip to Zurich are shuffled with scenes from their courtship and marriage ... There are a lot of tears in this memoir ... Part of what makes this book moving is Bloom’s toughness. She’s a mama bear, in the right ways. She doesn’t go overboard in explaining her moral reasoning. She doesn’t have to. Her title is her explanation.\n\nMixed The New York Times Mamas, don’t let your babies grow up to collect their PEN International speeches between hard covers ... The amount these speeches have added to the sum of human dullness is incalculable ... This applies even to those who can clearly write and think, like Margaret Atwood ... In Atwood’s new book...there are so many such speeches, including a PEN talk, that they quickly capsize the boat, threatening to drown even the good material. The heart-sinking opening sentences start early, and they never entirely stop ... I kept reading. Hope springs eternal across a crowded table of contents. And there is some smart material and pawky wit in Burning Questions, even if they huddle, trembling, like ferns behind a waterfall ... In some of the essays here, Atwood recalls the gestation and reception of her best-known novels ... Some of the most memorable things in Burning Questions are simply stray comments that noodle their way into your mind ... Atwood, at 82, hardly seems ossified. She’s radiant on this book’s cover, and the best pieces here cast a certain glow as well. As for the speeches, I suppose during those you can, as at any conference, sneak out to the sidewalk for an illicit vape.\n\nRave New York Times There’s nothing pulpy about David Wright Faladé’s Black Cloud Rising. It’s a Civil War novel based on the actual experiences of the African Brigade ... Faladé’s book is so accessible and rousing, though, that you hope it becomes available as a mass-market paperback, in packaging that more clearly announces: This book is a straight-up page-turner ... There are no braided points of view here, no too-pretty words, no splintered syntax. No leaden diagnoses of the human predicament belch on the smoky skyline. The nature of the American experiment is implicitly questioned but not burned to the ground ... This is a classic war story told simply and well, its meanings not forced but allowed to bubble up on their own ... This is in some senses Faladé’s first novel ...There’s blood and sinew in the story he tells ... It seems built out of pine, not mahogany, as if heeding the poet A.R. Ammons’s advice: \\'Sometimes the best piece of / wood is not right for what you have in mind.\\'\n\nMixed The New York Times Sheila Heti’s new novel, Pure Colour, is about a young woman who turns into a leaf. \\'Unrequited love’s a bore,\\' Billie Holiday sang. So, it turns out, is photosynthesis ... Her transformation is disorienting, to us if not her. One moment the reader is consuming shot after shot of Heti’s strong, familiar brand of espresso. The next we’re sipping as if out of Meret Oppenheim’s fur-lined teacup at MoMA ... Heti has long been a devastating writer about sexual magnetism, her prose as sensitive as the tip of a conductor’s baton ... Where is Heti going with this? It’s complicated. Pure Colour runs its readers along a borderline of substance and hallucination. You sense her doing several things at once ... She is niftily confounding expectations ... Does the novel work? Not entirely, not for this reader. Pure Colour is awfully earnest at times. It’s static as well; very little, beyond the big, Gregor Samsa-like reveal, happens ... And yet, she has a way of turning metaphysics to her advantage ... Heti is interested in charisma and beauty, the utter unfairness of them ... She can compact political and class antagonisms into small fists of meaning ... Pure Colour is not helplessly, organically, healingly funny, as were some of Heti’s earlier novels. But there are moments.\n\nRave New York Times Sometimes...you pick up a novel and it makes your skin prickle—not necessarily because it’s a great novel qua novel, which you can’t know until the end, but because of the velocity of its microperceptions. You’ve entered elite head space of one kind or another. Jennifer Egan’s new one, The Candy House, is one of these novels. It makes you feel a bit high, drugged, and fitted with V.R. goggles, almost from the start ... You don’t have to have read Goon Squad to pick up The Candy House, but it helps. Most of the characters are back ... All sorts of strings from the earlier book are picked up and braided, twanged or cauterized ... My description...makes this sound like a clash-of-civilizations novel, or a techno nail-biter...but it doesn’t read that way: It’s more nubbly. It comes alive in dozens of entwined stories, in connections and convergences ... The Candy House is a trim 334 pages, but it has a dwarf-star density. Inside, 15 or 20 other novels are trying to climb out. The chapters are short; the tone is aphoristic; the eye for cultural and social detail is Tom Wolfe-like ... Egan has a gift for combining the outrageous and the plausible without ejecting us from the narrative ... All this is wound together; nearly everyone is somehow connected. It’s all too much, except that it isn’t ... She knows where she’s going and the polyphonic effects she wants to achieve, and she achieves them ... I could argue, I suppose, that this novel’s corners are too sharp, that it lacks a certain heft and drift. The implications of the cube on sex habits, online and off, are oddly omitted. And the ending is tapioca soft ... Always check for your wallet when a writer goes all in, as Egan does here, on the power of storytelling and of fiction. The Candy House makes that case simply by existing.\n\nMixed The New York Times ... a fond, earnest, sepia-toned book, the color of old clippings. It’s pretty good. I mean, it’s OK. It’s better than a sharp stick in the eye. It’s just … long and pokey and a bit underthought. I might not have finished it if my paycheck didn’t depend on leaving a clean plate ... A lot happened in the world in the early 1960s ... He describes these historical events in detail, as if few had written about them before. He’s evocative about newsrooms themselves circa 1960 ... He’s good on the camaraderie he found ... Had it run to 175 pages, Chasing History might have been a small classic ... His heart glows remembering his early days in the business, but he can’t quite make ours glow alongside his. If at 370 pages this book overstays its welcome, well, the kid was all right.\n\nPositive The New York Times ... brash and talky ... achieves immediate liftoff ... It’s a treat, always, to read language that’s excited about itself. You wonder if Andreades will be able to keep it up over the course of a novel. If she doesn’t, not quite, she comes close enough that she has put herself immediately on the radar screen ... Andreades dryly, and deftly, sets up the conversations that ensue ... \\'Brown girls, brown girls, brown girls,\\' the author likes to repeat. She uses these repetitions for effect, relishing the words the way Chris Rock does in his comedy, pacing the stage ... Andreades’s writing has economy and freshness. Brown Girls reads as much like poetry as it does like a novel, which is another way of saying: Don’t arrive here expecting a good deal of plot ... The chapters are short, ramekin-size. The novel always seems to be stopping and starting over ... This quality can relieve Andreades of doing the hard work of exploring character, or ideas, in real depth ... fearless.\n\nMixed The New York Times Five or six of these essays are obvious masterpieces of the form, their sting utterly intact. There’s a lot of filler here, too, though—mundane essays that, if you removed Hurston’s name, could have been written by anyone ... If the editors aren’t scraping the bottom of the barrel, they’re an inch or two away. This book’s long introduction is well written but not, somehow, useful. The authors devote many pages to telling you what you are about to read and cherry-picking the best quotes. It’s like watching a 15-minute trailer for the film you’re about to watch ... Relevant biographical information is absent ... I liked this book anyway. Reading Hurston, you always wonder what shape her dignity will take next. Her style and spark were her own.\n\nRave The New York Times ... terrific: confident, creepy, a powerful and soulful page-turner. I had no idea where it was going, in the best possible sense ... The thing about Darnielle’s writing, in all its forms, is this: If you’re that dorky outcast kid drawing a pentagram on the back page of your three-ring binder in algebra class, not because you want to drink anyone’s blood but because you think it’s cool, he sees you. His novels are in close contact with the alternative cultural universes of fantasy and the occult and science fiction, yet they don’t resemble genre fiction. They’re earthy and fly low to the ground. They are plain-spoken and in no hurry ... Devil House...[is]never quite the book you think it is. It’s better.\n\nMixed The New York Times There’s enough animosity, jealousy, score-settling and killing gossip in Tinderbox, James Andrew Miller’s mountainous new oral history of HBO, to fill an Elizabethan drama. Yet the book’s tone is largely fond ... prepare for a landslide of corporate history. Students of power will find much to interest them. HBO had many stepparents over the years. Following these deals is complicated, like following the lyrics to \\'There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly\\' ... Miller gets good quotes ... Oral history is a strange form. It gives you a staccato series of micro-impressions, as if you were looking through a fly’s compound eyes ... Miller is a good interviewer, but a corny writer ... There are a lot of winning moments in Tinderbox. But wading through its nearly thousand pages I often felt spacey and exhausted, as if it were 4 a.m. on the third night of one of those endurance contests and I had to keep my hand on the pickup truck.\n\nPositive The New York Times Book Review If you sense you are about to step into a sword-and-sandal epic with a mud room, you would not be altogether wrong. If you detect a saving, dill-scented note of satire, you would not be wrong either ... an unruly, overwhelming, vastly eccentric novel. It’s sophisticated and ribald and brimming with folk wit. It treats everything it bumps into at both face value and ad absurdum. It’s Chaucerian in its brio ... This enormous novel makes space for a landslide of incident and commentary ... At a key moment, a character might wander off and weed the oregano. It’s that kind of book ... Tokarczuk can be very funny ... The comedy in this novel blends, as it does in life, with genuine tragedy: torture, betrayal, imprisonment, death ... feels modern in its sense of an old order ending. End times feel closer than they once did ... This novel’s density is saturnalian; its satire nimble; academics will tug at its themes, as if they were pinworms, for decades. The author’s enthusiasm never flags, even when a reader’s does. She bulldozes the sprawl forward ... Yet the characters remain at a distance. The Books of Jacob rarely touches the emotions. No page, for me, turned itself. A word from Finnegans Wake came to mind: thunderslog ... I don’t mean to dissuade. As with certain operas, I’m glad to have had the experience — and equally glad that it’s over.\n\nMixed New York Times A potent, pointed novel that nonetheless remains distant — it never quite finds an emotional tone ... My favorite parts of The Fortune Men are when the author sends Mahmood to the movies ... Reverberant passages are rare in The Fortune Men. The book dissipates a good deal of its energy, especially in its first half, pivoting between the stories of the shopkeeper, her family, Mahmood’s estranged wife and their sons, and that of Mahmood himself. There is more summary than scene ... Little momentum builds. When it threatens to do so, the story feels hemmed in by the details of Mahmood’s actual life. The novel is semidetached ... This is a hit-and-miss novel, but Mohamed is a big talent, and she’s only getting started.\n\nMixed The New York Times A.S. Byatt’s fiction...has been increasingly ornate, humorless, freighted with fantasy and myth, and encrusted with heavy literary reference. All my least favorite things in fiction ... Byatt’s fiction has become less convincing than her arguments. She’s less fierce than Carter, who once began a story, \\'My father lost me to the Beast at cards.\\' She’s less playful than the minimalist Barthelme, and less liquidly philosophical than Iris Murdoch. She seems, most of the time, to be writing with a quill under a prism-fringed chandelier ... Other stories fly a bit closer to earth, though rarely do you sense you’re reading about beings you might care about, or that anything at all is at stake. They’re top-heavy, forced in a hothouse. There are many stories within stories. If such stories were good, they wouldn’t be inside a different one. While reading, I frequently glanced at my wife across the room and made that brilliant new international hand signal that means \\'help me.\\' A human theme does emerge from this book. Byatt is a perceptive writer about aging, about what it’s like to feel like you’re disappearing, like Homer Simpson into that hedge, from the brighter world ... The reason to buy this book—well, to borrow it—is for the title story ... When the explosion comes, it is worth the wait. You no longer sense you’re reading treacle written in high diction, and that the only smoke is like that from the nostrils of a cartoon bull.\n\nRave The New York Times Book Review The whole book is excellent. Highsmith is pointed and dry about herself and everything else. But the early chapters are special. They comprise one of the most observant and ecstatic accounts I’ve read—and it’s a crowded field!—about being young and alive in New York City ... In these diaries she can appear to have popped, fully formed, from a Charles Addams cartoon. Misanthropes will find a lot to please them ... condensed from some 8,000 pages of material. It is still, at nearly 1,000 pages, a whacking book. But it’s not logy. It’s been sharply edited by Anna von Planta, Highsmith’s longtime editor. The introductory material for each section is useful and concise. There’s no desire to hit \\'skip intro.\\'\n\nRave The New York Times ... here comes Rax King, in her ebullient book Tacky: Love Letters to the Worst Culture We Have to Offer, to make the late aughts seem like the most vivid, concrete and ecstatic moment to burst into adolescence since time out of mind ... King’s book is a well-calibrated celebration of \\'bad\\' taste ... That King writes about these things while alluding to Sontag and Updike and Penelope and Odysseus without once seeming like she is otherwise slumming is part of her achievement ... She wears her literacy as if it were a nose stud ... Nor is it new to tuck memoir, wonton-style, inside cultural criticism, which King does. What does feel new — what’s always new, when you find it — is the glitter and squalor and joy and exactness in King’s writing. She’s opposed to distance and irony; you end up taking her seriously because she’s so opposed to the project of being taken seriously ... King writes about herself in the manner Martha Graham taught her dancers to move across the stage: She leads with her crotch. She possesses, in her telling, an incandescent libido, so mighty it could illumine a city’s electrical grid ... reads like sequential shots of Fireball Cinnamon Whisky ... Ode to Warm Vanilla Sugar is in league, as coming-of-age essays go, with Nora Ephron’s A Few Words About Breasts ... So winsome is the writing in Tacky that, most of the time, there’s no other word for it but classy.\n\nPositive The New York Times Marton’s new biography, The Chancellor: The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel, is a bit like Merkel herself: calm, dispassionate, not afraid to bore us. Many readers will find it a balm. It’s instructive to spend time in Merkel’s competent and humane company ... Merkel didn’t talk to Marton for this book. When the author does get a quote out of someone close to Merkel, it’s often a banality...But give Marton credit. She has doggedly retraced Merkel’s trail, and the story she brings is a good one ... On occasion The Chancellor veers toward hagiography, but it steps quickly away again. Marton is a critical observer, especially of Merkel’s tendency not to articulate her deeper feelings, her frequent failure to win over hearts as well as minds ... This book is a bedtime story of a queasy sort, or so it can seem. It’s as if Marton, via her subject, were tucking the old liberal order in and wishing it a good night, for tomorrow it may die.\n\nRave The New York Times ... elegant and well-made ... Some prolific nonfiction writers slowly grow bleary; you sense them, in their later books, going through the motions, rounding off corners. Haygood, on the other hand, has become a master craftsman, one whose joinery is seamless ... This is sweeping history, but in Haygood’s hands it feels crisp, urgent and pared down. He doesn’t try to be encyclopedic. He takes a story he needs, tells it well, and ties it to the next one. He carries you along on dispassionate analysis and often novelistic detail ... As you read, you may find yourself making lists of films to watch or rewatch ... Stale language begins to creep in toward the end. It’s past time for an ambitious young copy editor to invent a search widget called ClicheCatcher™ to routinely run on manuscripts before they go to press ... Yet this is important, spirited popular history. Like a good movie, it pops from the start. (Haygood was wise to omit an introduction.) Like a good movie, too, it comes full circle.\n\nPositive The New York Times Major Labels isn’t a sharp-prowed vessel that’s going to help break poptimism’s icy grip. It’s ecumenical and all-embracing. The good news is that Sanneh...has a subtle and flexible style, and great powers of distillation. He’s a reliable guide to music’s foothills, as well as its mountains. The bad news is that this book about genre is—pun intended, I suppose—sometimes generic. It’s closer to a textbook, a Ken Burns-style history lesson, than a series of well-aimed arguments ... Major Labels is full of good biographical details ... The best thing about Sanneh may be that he subtly makes you question your beliefs ... \\'I am drawn to music that starts fights,\\' Sanneh writes. If I wish this book started a few more of them, well, it has other things on its mind.\n\nPositive The New York Times Angier’s book is ungainly at times, and oddly structured. It escapes, for sure, what the biographer Michael Holroyd called \\'the prison of chronology.\\' Readers not already familiar with Sebald’s work will find her synopses of his books difficult to parse. But her biography acquires a stubborn dignity ... Angier has stared down a writer whose life, in many ways, remains a similar container-box of holes. If future biographies will surely have more to say, Angier has persisted, and written an intelligent and intuitive book about a writer who, like certain mountains, has his own weather, and whose career remains a contested site.\n\nPositive The New York Times D’Aguiar’s memoir is the wildest of [recent books about illness]. Part of his defiance in the face of cancer is to throw everything he has onto the page. The result is weird and articulate and angry; there’s some overwriting, and sometimes the thread is nearly lost. But his rage to live shivers in every sentence ... I liked the sections in which D’Aguiar enters into a dialogue with his cancer. These reminded me of Benjamin Franklin’s dialogue with his gout, during which all he could sometimes utter was \\'Oh! eh! oh!\\' ... I’m happy to report that Year of Plagues ends on a cautiously upbeat note. Cancer’s had to pipe down.\n\nPositive The New York Times This is a strange, gothic, Bible-obsessed novel, laced with buzzard-black themes and intimations of horror ... Admirers of the six-book My Struggle series — I’m among them, with reservations about the final volume — will want to know: Does The Morning Star cast the same sort of spell those novels did? The answer, for a long time, is yes ... About the details of daily existence, he manages to be, without ladling on lyricism, twice as absorbent as most of the other leading brands ... The Morning Star becomes, in other words, a somewhat programmatic novel of ideas. Knausgaard chews on notions of faith, free will, the transmigration of souls, the nature of angels, on meaning and nothingness in Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and Rilke’s poetry ... Knausgaard is among the finest writers alive, yet there is something cramped about his work when he approaches ideas straight on, instead of obliquely ... Here the earnest wrestling is with how we think about mortality. At certain moments you sense he is in close contact with all the oldest and deepest wisdom; at other moments, the stream runs shallow.\n\nRave The New York Times ... a mellow, marzipan-hued ’70s-era heartbreaker. Crossroads is warmer than anything he’s yet written, wider in its human sympathies, weightier of image and intellect. If I missed some of the acid of his earlier novels, well, this one has powerful compensations ... Franzen patiently clears space for the slow rise and fall of character, for the chiming of his themes and for a freight of events — a car wreck, rape, suicide attempts, adultery, drug deals, arson — that arrive only slowly, as if revealed in sunlight creeping steadily across a lawn ... Franzen threads these stories, and their tributaries, so adeptly and so calmly that at moments he can seem to be on high-altitude, nearly Updikean autopilot. The character who cracks this novel fully open — she’s one of the glorious characters in recent American fiction — is Marion, Russ’s wife ... The Franzen-shaped hole in our reading lives is like a bog that floods at roughly eight-year intervals. This time that bog is shot through with intimations of light ... Flannery O’Connor spoke of the \\'moment of grace\\' that appears in many of her stories, \\'a moment where it is offered, and usually rejected.\\' Franzen’s novel is flush with such moments. It’s about tests most of us fear we are not going to pass.\n\nRave The New York Times Atticus Lish’s second novel, The War for Gloria, is, by and large, a monster—solemn, punishing, kinetic, in easy contact with dark areas of the psyche, and yet heartbreaking in its portrait of a mother and son facing her mortal illness. It more than pays off on the promise of his first novel, Preparation for the Next Life, which won the 2015 PEN/Faulkner award ... You never sense [Lish is] merely writing \\'quality fiction\\'; he seems to draw instead from a deep well of experience, especially when it comes to the tastes and textures of life on the economic margins ... The details are intimate and harrowing and, to some degree, drive the core of the narrative ... Lish’s novel is powerful, intelligent, brooding and most of all convincing; it earns its emotions. Two things in it don’t convince ... No matter. The War for Gloria works because the details are so casually drilled home.\n\nMixed The New York Times As Williams’s books go, this isn’t a very good one. Her wit misfires more than usual; the ecological themes are overly familiar; there are no real characters to hang onto, and very little plot, not that anyone comes to Williams for scenario ... Expectations are funny things, though. If you blacked out Williams’s name on the cover and told me that Harrow was written by a recent graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, I would probably have thought to myself, \\'A wild one has escaped the infirmary! I greet you, wild one, at the start of an interesting career. Please stop making me laugh while unspooling my intestines\\'...Such are the mental contradictions when reading a lesser Williams novel ... Williams’s characters strike poses and dispense thought bubbles, verbal pellets; they can seem to have stepped out of a Jules Feiffer strip. Everyone skitters sideways, as if they were crabs. Her humans are given to epiphanic exclamations that often have nothing to do with anything that’s happening. They’re trying to remain sane in a demented world. They’re total weirdos, in the best sense ... You skim Harrow, as if it were a book of poems, for the author’s observations, threaded as they are with acuity and chagrin and strange harbingers and vestiges of old mythologies ... Williams isn’t that kind of nature writer, one of the tenderheaded, cry-of-the-loon variety. Even if this novel is half-realized, like a wire frame awaiting clay for its head, its skepticism and sanity are consistently on display.\n\nPan The New York Times ... so meek, saccharine and overweening in its piety about nature that even a teaspoon of it numbs the mind ... equal parts earnest opinion-page essay (humans + nature = yikes) and middling Netflix science fiction product (boy reconnects with dead mother through high tech) ... The medical science described in “Bewilderment” is really interesting, in the manner of a New Yorker article. As fiction, the novel is D.O.A. — shallowness that requests to be taken seriously ... it’s got a nubbly sentimentality ... To be fair to Powers, he retains an ability to alchemize the strangeness of everyday global life...But these moments are rare here ... There are some books you want to give to your best friend; this is one to give to your distant aunt, for her reading group. It’s a James Taylor song when you require a buzz-saw guitar. There’s no impudence, no wit, no fire and little fluttering understanding, despite the ostentatious science, of how human minds really work ... It’s a book about ecological salvation that somehow makes you want to flick an otter on the back of the head, for no good reason at all.\n\nPositive The New York Times ... subtle and substantial ... Toibin’s symphonic and moving novel humanizes [Thomas] further ... Toibin seeks to grasp the entirety of Mann’s life and times, the way a biographer might, and he does so quite neatly. Maximalist in scope but intimate in feeling, The Magician never feels dutiful. Like its subject, it’s somber, yet it’s also prickly and strange, sometimes all at once ... Toibin is a writer of pinging dialogue, a novelistic Tom Stoppard, and he gives Katia many of the best lines ... Toibin’s fiction is animated by the ever-alert attention he pays to sexual subcurrents ... a big novel that waxes and wanes.\n\nRave The New York Times Book Review Rita Dove’s new book of poems is among her best. The title makes it leap from the bookcase ... Dove’s books derive their force from how she so deftly stirs the everyday — insomnia, TV movies, Stilton cheese, rattling containers of pills — into her world of ideas and intellection, in poems that are by turns delicate, witty and audacious. Her sleepless eye for cant, necessary in all good poetry, is a bonus ... These are fighting poems ... You sense the books of many poets of Dove’s generation slipping to the back of the bookcase. Not hers.\n\nRave The New York Times Grue is a Norwegian writer and academic who owns a shrewd, stern, pared-down prose style ... He writes exceedingly well about his desire not to be too polite, not to be a pushover, while realizing that, as he puts it, \\'you cannot live in an uninterrupted battle with the entire world.\\' He is candid about his peppery feelings, his \\'hostile impulses, discomfort, ill-will\\' ... Grue is helplessly epigrammatic ... a quietly brilliant book that warms slowly in the hands. A bonus is the author’s writing about clothing. Grue learns to pay attention to style and cut. He becomes a bit of a dandy ... artful.\n\nPositive New York Times [Has] a lot to say about desire and pain and depression and shame and unlikely sources of joy, among other topics ... Blind Man’s Bluff is amiable, too. It’s been a long time since I met such a thoroughly normal guy in a memoir. Hill doesn’t try to impress us with his tastes and persona ... His book doesn’t have the grit and the rage and determined literariness [of other memoirs] ... But I’d buy him a beer anytime.\n\nPositive The New York Times Witty and sharply expressed short stories ... Four or five of the stories in Afterparties are good enough that the reader senses that he had a vast amount of soul and spirit in his account, and that he’d only just begun to draw from it ... The author is at his best when he has a lot of plates spinning. A few of the quieter stories struggle to leave an impression.\n\nMixed The New York Times ... earnest and diligent, to a fault ... alas, reads like 300 daily newspaper articles taped together so that they resemble an inky Kerouacian scroll ... Perhaps it’s not the authors’ fault that I Alone Can Fix It is grueling. It may be that a reader, having survived Covid-19, \\'stop the steal\\' and the bear-spray wielders, and feeling a certain amount of relief...is uneager to rummage so soon through a dense, just-the-facts scrapbook of a dismal year ... A primary and not insignificant achievement in I Alone Can Fix It, however, is its bravura introduction of a new American hero, a man who has heretofore not received a great deal of attention: Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A better title for this book might have been Mr. Milley Goes to Washington.\n\nPositive The New York Times Wolff tells a broad, jumpy, event-laden story about Trump’s shambolic final year ... a smart, vivid and intrepid book. [Wolff] has great instincts. I read it in two or three sittings ... It’s the book that this era and this subject probably deserve ... Wolff has an eye for status details.\n\nMixed The New York Times ... a difficult novel to read. The subject matter is about as grim as grim gets ... is difficult to read, too, because of its structure. Ferrell mixes bits of narrative, collage-style, with snippets of news stories, with letters and lists and spells and incantations and social service assessments and the answers to tests and questionnaires. There are atmospheric photographs. The effect is to keep the book’s action slightly remote, at a distance ... No real narrative force is permitted to develop in Ferrell’s novel, either. It’s an endurance test. I admired it while longing for it to end ... Ferrell’s title, Dear Miss Metropolitan, summons to mind the dark comedy of Nathanael West’s 1933 advice-column novel, Miss Lonelyhearts. It’s a misleading title for this book ... The author is a vivid maker of sentences with a flair for casual surrealisms ... There are few scenes of applied, extended torment in Dear Miss Metropolitan. But the dry facts, unbearable in every detail, are more than enough. Over the course of the novel, they make something in your soul break down ... It becomes clear, and not for the first time, that Ferrell is navigating American trauma writ large, as well as her characters’ own. Some nightmares, and subsidiary nightmares, aren’t easily outrun.\n\nRave The New York Times ... coolly written and casts a spell. The light it emits is ghostly, like that from under the lid of a Xerox machine ... The narrator’s voice is largely bloodless. One of Kitamura’s gifts, though, is to inject every scene with a pinprick of dread. Your animal instincts as a reader — the tingling of the skin, the eagerness to pick the book back up — may be engaged before the rest of you is ... Kitamura pays attention to the dark side of urban landscapes, the things we prefer not to learn about ... All novels are, in a sense, about language, but Intimacies presses down on how meaning is made, and how it is compromised ... the real heat here, as in Kitamura’s previous novel, A Separation (2017), lies in the author’s abiding interest in the subtleties of human power dynamics ... Few novelists write so astringently about how we misread people, and are forced to refresh, as if on a web browser, our assumptions about them ... I like Intimacies — it’s certainly one of the best novels I’ve read in 2021 — without it quite being the sort of thing I like. The rapt attention it pays to the problems of glamorous, international, well-appointed people, not to go all Tea Party on the readers of this review, poked whatever class antagonisms I cling to ... You don’t sense the grit and grain of life. No one has ill-timed acne, or really can’t catch a cab. There are not many stray, stabbing insights. A film version would feature a lot of long, somber, pre-dawn drone shots of the stylish urban landscape and a thrumming score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross ... Kitamura has delivered a taut, moody novel that moves purposefully between worlds.\n\nRave The New York Times Tarantino’s first novel is, to borrow a phrase from his oeuvre, a tasty beverage ... Tarantino isn’t trying to play here what another novelist/screenwriter, Terry Southern, liked to call the Quality Lit Game. He’s not out to impress us with the intricacy of his sentences or the nuance of his psychological insights. He’s here to tell a story, in take-it-or-leave-it Elmore Leonard fashion, and to make room along the way to talk about some of the things he cares about — old movies, male camaraderie, revenge and redemption, music and style. He gets it: Pop culture is what America has instead of mythology. He got bitten early by this notion, and he’s stayed bitten. The novel is loose-jointed. If it were written better, it’d be written worse. It’s a mass-market paperback that reeks of mass-market paperbacks. In my memory, it’s the smell of warm coconut oil and dust mites and puddling Mercurochrome ... Tarantino goes so deep into Manson’s once-promising music career, you may feel you’re reading a back issue of Rolling Stone or Mojo magazine ... Tarantino makes telling a page-turning story seem easy, which is the hardest trick of all.\n\nMixed The New York Times I read Rushdie’s arguments with much interest and little agreement, as Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. used to say. He is fencing with a poorly stuffed straw man ... Much of the rest in Languages of Truth is limper and less interesting. The book contains several sleepwalking commencement speeches, semi-obligatory memorial lectures and the introductions to books and speeches delivered on behalf of PEN America, of which he was president from 2004 to 2006 ... He may be right. But the irritable Rushdie felt like the real one, or at least the wide-awake one. If his arguments about the state of fiction in Languages of Truth don’t convince, at least they’re genuine signs of life.\n\nMixed The New York Times ... I picked up Phase Six on a whim and devoured the first 100 pages before I knew what was happening ... In its second half, alas, this one rolls over and expires ... Like a lot of people, I have a sweet tooth for apocalyptic narratives. Shepard efficiently gets his off the ground. Things get dark quickly. He nails the scientific details, but also the cultural ones ... passes the Bechdel test on nearly every page ... Shepard is a crisp and intelligent and reliable writer ... Shepard writes perceptively, in Phase Six, about a lot of things. He’s passionate in his defense of the environment, though it’s hard to find a decent novelist who isn’t. He pays attention to the ways certain cable news channels make every situation worse. He makes scientific realities tactile ... After its creepy and bravura opening, Phase Six stalls. It’s as if, having achieved escape velocity, Shepard turned off his engines. What begins as a brainy potboiler, the kind of book you’d have felt lucky to find in one of those spinning drugstore paperback racks, becomes ponderous ... The world outside is burning and we’re almost entirely stuck inside ... There’s some slack writing, too, which is unusual for Shepard ... aspires to real density, but it can’t quite get there: The characters remain essentially static. The book falls into a no-person’s land between pop thriller and literary novel. It doesn’t satisfy on either level.\n\nPositive The New York Times ... plain-spoken ... McCutchan is a sensitive observer of Rawlings’s work, and of her deeply unconventional life in general ... It’s a pleasure to meet this cursing, hard-drinking, brilliant, self-destructive, car-wrecking, fun-loving, chain-smoking, alligator-hunting, moonshine-making, food-obsessed woman again on the page ... Come to this biography for Rawlings’s outsize personality, her quest to lead a life that felt authentic to her...Stay for the portrait of a woman whose writing meant everything to her.\n\nRave The New York Times You know when you’re reading a page of Rachel Cusk’s fiction. Her narrators tug insistently if coolly at the central knots of being. They analyze every emotion as if it were freshly invented. Nothing is extraneous ... The narrator is familiar: a sharply observant writer in middle age ... More notably, this book has a swirling hothouse quality that’s new ... It’s as if Cusk has been reading Joyce Carol Oates’s best novels. She digs into the gothic core of family and romantic entanglements. I filled the margins with check marks of admiration, but also with exclamation points. This novel pushes its needles into the red ... One doesn’t come to a Cusk novel for plot but for her extra-fine psychological apparatus. Yet there is a fair amount of plot in Second Place ... If I could have rubbed a lamp and lightened this book’s lurid intensities, I might have. It is not a novel that gladdens the soul. But gladdening the soul has never been Cusk’s project.\n\nRave The New York Times Kushner reminds us that she writes as well as any writer alive about the pleasure of a good motor doing what it was designed to do ... The essays in The Hard Crowd aren’t all about motorcycles and antique muscle cars, another of Kushner’s pet topics...But The Hard Crowd swings back around to engines and to motion. The author had found wings; she meant to use them. We watch her move her soul around ... This book has a real gallery of souls.\n\nPositive The New York Times Amid the book reviews in the LRB by critics determined to sound sober and certain, as if they were museum docents, her reviews and essays admitted doubt. They were marvelously shrewd but approachable and witty. Diski’s articles made the sound of someone chewing h"
