        "text": "I just came from Love and Thunder, and while parts of it made me laugh (and parts of it were comedy genius), as something of an MCU Thor-fan, I feel dirty. Also as a writer I’m simply “What was that? No, really, what was that?”\n\nLet’s talk about the humor, first.\n\nObligatory Spoiler Alert\n\nL&T turns Thor into a clown. Really. The beginning shows us Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy engaging in near slapstick clown combat. He’s practically a cartoon caricature of Thor from movies 1 and 2. Even when he gets an emergency “call” from SIF, who hasn’t been heard of since the first Thor movie, the quips barely slow and he shows a lack of urgency in rushing to her aid that’s slightly off-putting. Finding her horribly wounded beside the body of a giant and very dead god, he quips some more. It’s like the writers/director received explicit instructions: “There shall be NO emotional gravitas in this movie.”\n\nWhich is wrong on so many levels, because L&T covers a very serious set of story lines from recent Thor comics. An alien calling himself the God-Butcher has the means and the drive to Kill All Gods, and he has New Asgard in his sights. Nevermind that in the MCU Asgardians supposedly never sought worship, but were simply taken as divine during their period of interaction with the ancient Norse tribes of Earth. In the comics, he was a deadly, deadly threat to all. But extermination of what remains of Asgard isn’t enough, in the movie the stakes are raised as high as they can go; no, he has A PLAN to perform a Thanos-like feat by, wait for it, winning his way into the presence of Eternity (an Ultimate Being in the Marvel cosmology), which for some arbitrary reason will earn him a wish. And his wish will be The Death Of All Gods.\n\nOn top of that, Dr. Jane Foster is dying. Yup. Cancer. Apparently it runs in the family and got her mother and is now gunning for her. She’s Stage 4. Somehow the fragments of Thor’s hammer Mew-Mew, which cannot be moved from the spot on which they fell when Hela destroyed them, call to her, and turn her into The Mighty Thor. Mew-Mew gives her the power of Thor, but doesn’t rid her of her cancer, in fact it interferes with her treatment. This plotline is treated dead seriously, no jokes there.\n\nBUT, Jane’s impending demise aside, every other scene (except the tragic opening-scene backstory of the God-Butcher) contains witty banter, quippy comebacks, high levels of farce. The God-Butcher’s attack on New Asgard–and kidnapping of its children–is almost cartoon action. Pitch (Rise of The Guardians) is scarier.\n\nSo, serious plot, slapstick farce and be-clowned Thor. And of course this silly Thor is the Thor that has to sell us on the tragic love story that is he and Jane. This movie is the one Thor movie where the two of them actually have any kind of relationship talk and with the level of humor throughout it simply doesn’t work. With the lines they’re given, neither can summon any real emotional truth. Jane’s death should have been as much a tear-jerker as Iron Man’s. It didn’t jerk a single tear because the story didn’t build up any investment in Jane or Thor’s love for her.\n\nAs a writer, I find myself asking why the movie writers made this decision. Without being plugged into Hollywood at all, my best guess is that the relatively cool reception of Thor: The Dark World and the better reception of Thor: Ragnarok taught them the wrong lessons. They thought the humor was what sold Thor 3, and that they just needed more of it. Lots, lots more. They were wrong.\n\nSo on to the second thing that really bugged me; the cosmology.\n\nPreviously in the MCU we haven’t seen many gods. There’s the Asgardians, who again were godlike but not gods who sought out worship. More recently we’ve seen the Eternals, who were apparently the source of much mythology, and the Egyptian gods who seem to be the Real Deal–at least as far as having once guided their people and existing in a separate God Realm.\n\nNow we learn that All Gods Are Real. They also all have the distinct flavor of the gods of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld. The God-Butcher was motivated by his meeting with his own personal deity and his discovery that, to the gods, mortal worshipers were . . . vanity bling. Seriously. This conclusion was reemphasized later. The God-Butcher also learned that “there is no reward” for faithfulness. No heavenly hereafter. Mortals live, and then they die. That’s it. At its bottom, the universe is a materialist-atheist one. This is soul-scarring news to him considering his entire people, including his beloved daughter, are now all dead (with some implications that it was due to a holy war or something).\n\nThe amoral character of the gods is further pointed up when Thor, Lady Thor, and Valkyrie journey to Omnipotent City (yes that’s its name, really, and it’s Dunmanifestin from Terry Pratchett again), a grand Home of The Gods. I’m going to need to catch still-shots of it sometime, because I’m pretty sure you see every pantheon in human history partying there. Zeus is played like an Italian godfather. And they have no care that “lesser gods” not lucky enough to be in their country club are being slaughtered by the God-Butcher; in fact they try and keep Thor and company from leaving since the God-Butcher might be able to defeat them and get the secret location of Omnipotent City from them. And get this; you even see a couple of Celestials (you know, giant space-gods) hanging out there quietly.\n\nSo, All Gods Are Real In An Uncaring Universe.\n\nBut THEN.\n\nAt the climax of the movie, when the God-Butcher wins his way into the presence of Eternity, he realizes that what he really wants isn’t all the gods dead but his little girl back. He’s inspired by seeing the love of Thor and Jane as she’s dying in his arms (a scene that leaves you entirely dry-eyed, see above). So his wish is that she live again. He himself is dying, so Thor promises to raise her. Jane dies, dissolving into gold glitter and floating away on the breeze. God-Butcher dies without gold glitter. Thor becomes Papa Thor . . .\n\n. . . and in the after-credits scene Jane de-glitters upon a bridge leading to a beautiful land with white vaguely Norse palaces, where Heimdall welcomes her to Valhalla, the land of the gods.\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\n\n. . .\n\nWhat.\n\nThere’s an AFTERLIFE FOR GODS? But not for mortals? Unless the God-Butcher’s god was simply lying? But Thor himself didn’t seem to know the rules; he told Sif that only those who died in battle went to Valhalla, not those who died after the battle. Jane definitely died after the battle. Which leads to the inescapable conclusion that even the gods themselves have no idea what awaits anybody, and makes all Death Gods scam artists. Actually they’re all scam artists. And then there’s the whole Moon Knight Field of Reeds business, which doesn’t seem to touch on any of this. And as a rule Asgardians never poofed into gold glitter immediately upon expiration before, so are they not gods like the rest we see in Thor 4 are gods? But then why did Jane poof? Jane wasn’t a god when she died, she was just Jane, and now I’m clutching my hair and this is all very, very bad.\n\nIt’s not right that I walked out of the theater thinking that if there’s an afterlife (realms for “untethered consciousnesses”) in the MCU, contra everything the movie previously indicated, The God-Butcher blew his wish; his little girl was perfectly happy and waiting for him somewhere with her mum.\n\nAnd that’s why I don’t like Thor 4. Taken even on its own terms, none of it made any sense.\n\n<Sigh.>\n\nI’ll rewrite it in my head.\n\nMGH"
