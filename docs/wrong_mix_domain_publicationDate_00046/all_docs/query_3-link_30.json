        "text": "Books are great companions. They provide entertainment, offer reasoned and condensed ideas (an invaluable property in a world where we consume thousands of half-baked ideas via social media), they are nice to look at, they smell good, and help you appreciate the quality time you spend with them.\n\nI don’t read as much as I would like to, but I always try to squeeze 2â3 books per month. And at the end of the year, I like to revisit what I read the year before. It’s like time traveling through a personal journey.\n\nIf you follow the ChangeLog articles, you already know all of them. If not, here they are: 35 books divided into 19 fiction and 16 non-fiction. All of them with a brief personal review.\n\nCalifornia: La Fine del Sogno by Francesco Costa (2022)\n\nThis is non-fiction book in Italian describing the issues of theÂ Great State of California (the title translate into California: The End of the Dream). The book focuses, in particular, on the housing crisis that caused a population decrease in the state for the first time in at least 100 years. Informative book. Worth it.\n\nThe Black Company by Glen Cook (1984)\n\nThis is a classic, and many trusted people have highly recommended it to me.\n\nBut I didn’t like it. I didn’t hate it either, but when you read a book and think, “I cannot wait for it to end,” it is not a good point in its favor. As usual, my problem is that the author fails to make me care for any of the characters. Zero. I see a bunch of guys fighting another bunch of guys, and there is no clear motivation for anything. I whispered, “that’s dumb,” too many times while reading this book for me to care to continue with the series. For now.\n\nThe Triumph of CaesarÂ by Steven Saylor (2004)\n\nThe Triumph of CaesarÂ is part of my “Ancient Roman” guilty pleasure books. They are neverÂ great, but they are always time well spent and full of tiny amusing, historically accurate details. This is number 12 of the series, and I consider it above the series’ average. I have been reading this series since 2020 and this is the only book of the series I read in 2023. Probably because I need to find the strength to read the two next entries, that are prequels. Unfortunately.\n\nHyperfocusÂ by Chris Bailey (2018)\n\nI am always uncomfortable with productivity books. I like them more when they focus on psychological insights because I consider them an expression of practical self-reflection of the mechanism of our psyche. I like them way less when they stress the “productive” side of things too much. This topic, though, would start another 2000 words article.\n\nFor now, let’s say that this sits in the middle. There are interesting bits of information that I liked. I agree with the importance and fragility of focused attention, but also on the importance ofÂ mindfulÂ unfocused attention. However, there are still too many of the standard “email/meetings/do a lot of stuff” things I tend to dislike.\n\nSea of TranquilityÂ by Emily St. John Mandel (2022)\n\nI looked at this book because it was the “Goodreads Best Sci-Fi Book of 2022”. The problem is that it is not science fiction, not even close. And I despite 90% of the time travel trope. Books with time travel often become an incoherent mess. This book is no exception. It frustrated me, and I anguished every page of it.\n\nBut I know it is just me. Normal people do not suffer so much from a butchered temporal mechanic. So, maybe, you may find it enjoyable.\n\nWriting into the DarkÂ by Dean Wesley Smith (2015)\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I started writing more. To overcome a slump, I decided to give this book a try.\n\nI think it is a good book. Not exceptionalÂ per se.Â After all, there is very little to explain in a book about not-outlining other than why the author thinks it is a good idea. But the book is very convincing.\n\nAfter I read it, the book made me realize that rewriting and outlining maybe was the primary process that killed most of my books. Some years ago, I wrote two books with very minimal outlining. Then I jumped on the rewriting/careful outlining wagon and&mldr; I didn’t write anything more. So, maybe is it true? Maybe writing into the dark works better for me, even if my rational mind is pro-outlining?\n\nAfter some time, I can say that the truth is in the middle. If I plan absolutely nothing, I end up with very clunky and unsatisfying words on the page. So I need to plan something, and give me the permission to scrap the plan if the characters moves in a different direction.\n\nLa matematica Ã¨ politicaÂ by Chiara Valerio (2020)\n\nThis was a small Italian book whose title translates as “Mathematics is Politics.” The general idea was intriguing. However, I found this book very confusing. There are some good things, but they are scattered. It read as a partially-structured stream of consciousness, and more than once, I struggled to understand what the hell she was trying to say to me. Some parts are good. Some parts are a bit cringe. If I should give it a score, it would be a perfect 5 out of 10.\n\nStar Trek: Vanguard: HarbingerÂ by David Mack (2005)\n\nIn 2023, I also started this fantastic Star Trek book series. In this first book, David Mack’s prose was so good that I took some highlights and notes for passages I thought might be interesting to study for my own prose. The story was enthralling. I also liked that the main story focused on characters that were not from any TV series. Yes, there was theÂ EnterpriseÂ andÂ Kirk, but it seemed like bait to draw readers into a bigger, more exciting story.\n\nThe character’s portrayal, even if not mind-bendingly original, captured me. Nothing is black or white; every character carries their pains, sorrows, secrets, deep motivations, virtues, and flaws. More than once, characters I met with deep diffidence and the strong feeling that they were “the bad guys” ended up being redeemed in my eyes once I understood their baggage of problems and moral dilemmas. This, for me, is a sign of a well-built world.\n\nBut the “problem” withÂ Harbinger’s storyâif I can call it a problemâis that it is only a giant introduction to put the book series in motion. So, it is not a book that can be read as a standalone. You get detailed presentations of the characters, and you get involved with the story of (mostly) every single one. Then the book ends, and you understand that nothingâand I say nothingâgot resolved, and you are up for a long literary journey.\n\nStar Trek: Vanguard: Summon the ThunderÂ by Dayton Ward, Kevin Dilmore (2006)\n\nAnd I jumped into that journey.\n\nInÂ Summon the Thunder, we get to know the next two writers of the series: Dayton Ward and Kevin Dilmore. After reading some GoodReads reviews, I was worried. Many lamented a dip in the quality of the writing and, in general, a much worse book. However, I have to say, the reviews were unnecessarily harsh. Sure, Harbinger is clearly superior, but this holds up very well.\n\nBut it is not perfect. In fact, although the book offers some new clues about the mystery of Taurus Reach, the story itself is somewhat lacking. For example, there are no self-sustaining plot arcs aside from the mission of Quinn and Pennington, who are undoubtedly the strongest characters in the series.\n\nHow to Calm Your MindÂ by Chris Bailey (2022)\n\nAs I said before, I like Chris, and I found the concept of a book on his post-burnout experience promising. Unfortunately, though, it fell short. It is an exemplary case of the “this could have been a blog post” syndrome, from which many productivity books (in a very loose sense of the word productivity) suffer.\n\nIf you are interested in a much better book that tackles the problem of breaking the guilt-inducing cycle caused by the “I always have to accomplish something” mentality, I highly recommendÂ Four Thousand WeeksÂ by Oliver Burkeman.\n\nStar Trek: Vanguard: Reap the WhirlwindÂ by David Mack (2007)\n\nThird book of the Star Trek: Vanguard series. After a slower second book, this was absolutely fantastic. David Mack returned to the typewriter and produced 445 pages of pure thrill and frantic actions. It starts off slowly, but I swear to God, I had real trouble putting the book down (I may or may not have read a couple of chapters during a long, boring work meeting ð).\n\nThe book also solves many questions and plot points created in the previous book. Therefore, it would be a good place for me to take a break. But I will continue with the fourth book for sure. Yes. It is not great literature. It is definitelyÂ pulp science fiction. But, I have to confess, I adore the genre.\n\nThe Blackwater SagaÂ by Michael McDowell (1983)\n\nInterleaved with the others books, in May I started reading the six books of the Blackwater Saga.\n\nThe series, at least in Europe, became famous after being rediscovered in France in 2022 in a widely successful translation. The new edition is enriched by a marvelous cover art, and I’ll be lying if I said that the cover didn’t have an impact on me. I don’t usually judge books by their covers, but a good cover makes them stand out when I am randomly browsing through library aisles.\n\nAnyway, the series follows the story of theÂ CaskeyÂ family, a moderately wealthy family in the town of Perdido, Alabama, from 1919 to 1958. The novels read, for the most part, like a period drama but with a supernatural twist: the presence of Elinor, a mysterious woman that popped out in a hotel room after the 1919 flood of the Perdido River.\n\nI can’t say the series was more than “fine.” But the books are small enough to drive you along the Caskey family without effort.\n\nSurprisingly, it is a series about love. Maybe in a twisted way, but love nevertheless. It is also a sad series, in a melancholic kind of way.\n\nStar Trek: Vanguard: Open SecretsÂ by Dayton Ward (2009)\n\nBook four of the Star Trek: Vanguard series. This is another “transitory” installment that follows the energetic and adrenaline-pumping third book, Reap the Whirlwind. In contrast, Open Secrets slows the peace and focuses on building the plot for the future books. While it wasn’t a chore, it felt like “something I had to do” to move forward in the series.\n\nHow to be FriendÂ by Marcus Tullius Cicero (45 BCE)\n\nThis book is part of a really cool book series by Princeton Press that modernly translates ancient Greco-Roman classics. Every book is divided by theme, and it may be a single opera or an anthology of selected texts.\n\nHow to be FriendsÂ is the first one I read, and it is a translation of Cicero’sÂ De AmicitiaÂ written in 44 BC (9.957Â HE) during Cicero’s “Philosophical Exile.”\n\nNothing to add here; it is a classic and, likeÂ The Conquest of Happiness, still valid nowadays.\n\nUnder the DomeÂ by Stephen King (2009)\n\nGreat concept. Questionable execution. This could have been an interesting exploration of human character when people get cut out from the rest of the world. A slower descent into a state-of-nature scenario. A rich ethical exploration of people facing a desperate situation. Especially for a book that a thousand fucking pages long.\n\nInstead, it is just one of the most flat stereotypical mono-dimensional cast of characters ever doing the most stereotypical shit you can imagine and ending superb, What the actual fuck? Moment. It is so exaggerated and ridiculous that it was really hard to take it seriously.\n\nThe Conquest of HappinessÂ by Bertrand Russell (1930)\n\nThis is a classic by Bertrand Russell, written at a time when philosophy was still true philosophy, and philosophers were interested in how to liveâa time before the self-help gurus swooped in with easy questions, tarnishing the entire practical philosophy genre with the stain of money-grabbing marketing.\n\nAfter almost 100 years, “The Conquest of Happiness” (published in 1930) remains modern and worth reading, surprisingly so. We haven’t changed much in 90 years, after all.\n\nIn one passage, for instance, Russell criticizes contemporary parents (remember, it is the year 1930) for not allowing their children to experience boredom. He argues that the cinema, the radio, and all the new modern activities provide excessive passive entertainment.\n\nOh, Bertrandâ¦ If only you could have seen the depth of this problem in the 2020sâ¦\n\nHow to Say NoÂ by Diogenes,M. D. Usher (2022)\n\nIt is another book in theÂ Classical Wisdom for Modern ReadersÂ series. Here, the primary author and translator M.D. Usher compiles an anthology with various passages about Diogenes the Cynic from ancient authors.\n\nDiogenes is a genuinely fascinating figure, the original rebel. It is a shame it is, at the same time, ignored and misunderstood by the modern general public.\n\nYes! No! but Wait&mldr;!Â by Tim Lott (2023)\n\nIt is another bookÂ aboutÂ writing. Despite its brevity, it effectively highlights the unnecessary constraints of over-complicated story structure models. However, stories (I mean,Â plots, sorry) do have a structure, and knowing the main points of a plot can be truly beneficial.\n\nThe Greek BuddhaÂ by Christopher Backwith (2015)\n\nIt is a very informative book. However, I find it too speculative for my taste. There are a lot of logical “leaps of faith” that, even if they are well argued, they are “leaps of faith” anyway.\n\nFor instance, there is a section in which the author claim that the “founder” of Daoism, Laozi, is just a way for ancient Chinese to write Gutama, the name of the historical Buddha. There is a string of “we can imagine that,” that make sense individually, but they get weaker and weaker the more we string them together. It feels a lot like the author want to get Gutama out of Laozi by cherry-picking assumptions on Ancient Chinese language. I don’t think this is good science.\n\nHow to be FreeÂ by Epictetus, A. A. Long (II sec.)\n\nI am continuing theÂ Classical Wisdom for Modern ReadersÂ series. This time, it is a re-read.Â How to be FreeÂ is a modern translation of Epictetus’s Enchiridion. It’s not an easy book, but probably in the list of the top 10 books that changed my life. The book also includes some selected passages from Epictetus’Â DiscoursesÂ touching the theme of Freedom.\n\nPhilosophy in the Islamic WorldÂ by Peter Adamson (2015)\n\nThis is one of those books that I read from time to time. This month, I finally finished it.\n\nPhilosophy in the Islamic World is a part of Peter Adamson’s series History of Philosophy without any Gaps. In this third volume, Adamson delves into the history of philosophy in the Islamic World, covering Christian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophers who lived in Andalusia, North Africa, the Middle-East and India.\n\nAlthough it is a long book, it is a fascinating one. Primarily because it explores a usually ignored part of the philosophical landscape. I am delighted to have filled so many gaps in my philosophical knowledge!\n\nSolarisÂ by Stanislaw Lem (1961)\n\nSolaris is a philosophical science fiction novel by the Polish author Stanislaw Lem, first published in 1961. It belongs to that very early era of science fiction that nowadays appears both weird and unusually captivating. However, the primary focus of “Solaris” is not on science fiction itself â a genre whose topics are only marginally tackled â but on the exploration of the human mind.\n\nThe mysterious, futuristic, and exotic planet Solaris serves as a pretext to discuss very human and modern themes: love, the boundaries of science, the concept of life, and psychology.\n\nIt is a deep, beautiful book â unfortunately, not an easy one.\n\nThe Last ExileÂ by Ann Shin (2021)\n\nIn August, I came across this book through the Kobo Daily Offer (in Italian, La Collana di Giada, or âThe Jade Necklaceâ). It was priced at â¬1, and in the short description, it promised a love story set in North Korea. I’m not typically drawn to romance novels, but the North Korea aspect intrigued me, so I thought, why not? It was only â¬1, after all (a somewhat insulting price for something that, I assume, cost the author tens of hours).\n\nIn the end, though, it was an honest-but-not-great book. But I donât regret spending that token. Iâll do it again.\n\nThe main issue is that it feels unreal, and it is clear that the author wrote with the brakes on. While delving into the inevitable exploration of the gritty and tragic lives of North Korean refugees, there seems to be a barrier separating the reader from the disturbing reality. This doesn’t mean the book avoids difficult subjectsâit certainly doesn’tâbut I feel they pass by too quickly to be truly deeply felt.\n\nThe Internet ConÂ by Cory Doctorow (2023)\n\nThe Internet thrives on the interaction of small, open entities. It is not designed for large, vertically integrated companies that seek to blatantly stifle competition and corrupt the system.\n\nAll the economic systems are like pools of water. You need to put a stick in it and shake it vigorously. You need to add new water and let the old water evaporate. They require agitation, movement, and filtering. If you let a big chunk of mucilage become too big, it will clog the filters, stop the movement and your pool becomes a swamp.\n\nSo fuck those big tech companies. We need competition, interoperability, and ownership of what we buy and do on the web.\n\nThat’s, more or less, the topic of the book.\n\nTo Your Scattered Bodies GoÂ by Philip JosÃ© Farmer (1971)\n\nThis is a 1971 sci-fi book that I read for the first time in my early teens. It serves as the inaugural book of the Riverworld series. It introduces the setting, and the main character, raises 100 questions, and answers almost nothing. So, take this book as a big introduction. The series’ premise is fascinating: every human being ever existed, resurrected along the shores of a never-ending river. Unfortunately, it is very 70s for the modern reader. Still worth it, though.\n\nReady Player OneÂ by Ernest Cline (2011)\n\nThis is a famous one. To be honest, even if I am kind of a nerd myself, I found that it was too much. It is really hard to believe. The worldbuilding is more clichÃ©d than what I could get from ChatGPT if I asked for a 80s-nerd plot. Nevertheless, it is fun. If you donât take it seriously, it is an entertaining adventure.\n\nHow to Keep an Open MindÂ by Sextus Empiricus,Richard Bett (III sec.)\n\nThis is part of the lovely series Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers. It is a collection of selected passages from Sextus Empiricus, a skeptic of late antiquity. It is very technical, so I will not recommend it unless you have a philosophy discussion group (like I do).\n\nMedieval PhilosophyÂ by Peter S. Adamson (2019)\n\nI finally completed the fourth volume of the majestic History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps series by Peter Adamson. This volume was dedicated to Medieval Philosophy, a wildly understudied period in the history of philosophy. It has been a very interesting read. Even if most of the philosophical issues of the time was made-up problems generated from trying to make sense of the inconsistency of religion, the question and the solutions are still relevant in modern philosophy.\n\nMadre patriaÂ by Vittorio Emanuele Parsi (2023)\n\nA small booklet on the value of good patriotism in the Italian setting. I am not 100% convinced, and I can see that the author feels very emotionally attached to the topic. Interesting read nevertheless.\n\nStar Trek: Vanguard: PrecipiceÂ by David Mack (2009)\n\nFifth volume of the Star Trek: Vanguard series.\n\nThis was another action-packed volume. It is a shorter one (or it felt shorter?) and moves the characters forward, overcoming several cliffhangers of the previous books.\n\nIf the characters progress, not the main plot arc. Something is lost at the beginning of the book. Then everything is “fixed” at the end. So, virtually, we are in the same spot?\n\nRoughly speaking, of course."
