        "text": "A science fiction masterpiece. A brain transplant was only the beginning. Paperback, 512 Pages, Good Condition.\n\nAnother of Robert Heinlein's works that push the limits of our understanding of ethics and morality. As much a philosophical treatise as a Science Fiction novel. First it explores the ethics and morals of a brain transplant. Then it explores the ethics and morals of a very rich old man finding a way to potentially outlive his heirs. Then it explores the nature of sexual morality and indeed morality itself. It even touches on gender identification in a way that our world has not yet been forced to deal with it.\n\nA work so far ahead of its time that even though it was released in 1970 it's \"Time\" has not yet come. A masterpiece and a great read."
