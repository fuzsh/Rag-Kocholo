        "text": "An old horndog's swinging fever dream\n\nA bit rough. Heinlein fell seriously ill immediately after writing this draft so it does not have his usual polish. It reads like a stream of consciousness which for many parts it actually is.\n\nfree love\n\nThis is not Heinlein's most famous novel, but perhaps it should be better known. I find Heinlein's style to be magical but I can't explain exactly why.\n\nThe main focus of the novel appears to be sexual open-mindedness. I guess this was a shocking concept to most people in 1970, and I guess this is still shocking to most people in 2012.\n\nI like the warning about overpopulation. The problem was already bad in 1970 and has gotten worse since. I am happy when authors try to open the eyes of the public to this threat.\n\nThe narration is very good.\n\nJohn Christmas, author of \"Democracy Society\"\n\nOk I guess\n\nIf you could sum up I Will Fear No Evil in three words, what would they be?\n\nThe story was pretty good. It seemed to have some gaps which I guess is attributed to the Unabridged version. The narrator's voices were ok, he just was pretty weak in the female voices. :)\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nI guess the Johan for his ability to adapt.\n\nWould you listen to another book narrated by Anthony Heald?\n\nNot sure\n\nNot one of Heinlein's best stories\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to I Will Fear No Evil the most enjoyable?\n\nThe narrator did an wonderful job of giving each character a distinct voice and keeping them separate, even when the lines came machine gun style.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the ending? (No spoilers please!)\n\nAs we approach the end of our lives, we all wish to live it with our greatest loves close to us. But honestly, the ending becomes almost ridiculous.\n\nSoft-core porn gets boring\n\nIf I wanted sexist soft-core porn, I'd buy some. And like most porn, chapter after chapter gets boring. Hardly qualifies as science fiction. As in all his later books, Heinlein's women are all the same, defined by their biology. They're all stunningly brilliant and equally beautiful but they all want to have sex and babies as their major, if not only, fulfillment. Almost the only action in the story is an adolescent boy's wet dream. Only a couple of scientifically interesting ideas alternate with his retro-conservative politics and judgmental opinions straight out of 18th century myths about \"John Wayne\" men and compliant women who are hot to trot and just want to get laid.\n\ntoo slow for my taste\n\nHeinlein is one of the GODS of sci fi and I read some of his work when I was a kid - many years ago. I don't think I read this one and for me \"now\" it's just too slow - two people talking most of the first 5 hours and then I gave up. An interesting plot but if I were editing it, I would take a blue pencil to a whole lot.\n\nNice to be read to Awesome\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nAwesome Book And Story and Nice to be read to not having to read when you want to have something to help you sleep I love to have a bedtime story!!\n\nWho was your favorite character and why?\n\nEunice !! She is awesome Death is not the end for her nor her Charm She is Awesome\n\nWhat does Anthony Heald bring to the story that you wouldn’t experience if you just read the book?\n\nHearing the emotional impact of the conversation and mind set\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Stayed up all night to get it all\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nWell done LIke the way download and process went and to have the titles here for us\n\nWonderful story, but a bit cringe.\n\nI love almost all of Heinlein’s writing, even though his female characters can be caricatures of 1950’s ideas of femininity and sexuality. This story may be the apex of his cringy female stereotypes. This is exacerbated by the producers using the wrong narrator for the story. Don’t get me wrong, the narrator is wonderful and did a fantastic job, but using a male narrator exacerbates the cringe, and makes the whole thing feel very dirty-old-man-ish. I felt dirty even listening to the story. It’s worth listening to, even if it’s difficult at times, but only if you’re a loyal Heinlein fan who isn’t troubled by writings “problematic” by today’s standards."
