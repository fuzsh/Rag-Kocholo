        "text": "Winner of the Margaret McWilliams Award and Manitoba Day Award. A new perspective on encounters between missionaries and Ojibwa, blending research with conversations and interviews to examine philosophy-in-action\n\nThe history of Christian missions in Canada has traditionally been told only from the point of view of the missionaries, and not those they were attempting to convert. In I Will Fear No Evil, Susan Gray offers a new perspective on missionary-Indigenous encounters between the Berens River Ojibwa and Methodist and Catholic missionaries between 1875 and 1940.\n\nSupplementing her historical research with conversations and interviews with Berens River elders, Gray explores the ways in which Christian beliefs have become incorporated into the traditional Ojibwa worldview. The Ojibwa were active participants in these missionary encounters. They accepted those missionaries who treated them with sensitivity and respect and integrated Christian beliefs and practices into their established belief system.\n\nToday, a blend of Christian and Ojibwa ideas is still interwoven in the lives of Berens River residents, with both traditions holding meaning and sincerity. Their uniquely adaptive religion sheds new light on our understanding of cultural contact and conversion, placing the indigenous experience of these events at centre stage.\n\nSusan Elaine Gray is a Research Associate to the Canada Research Chair in Aboriginal Peoples in an Urban and Regional Context at the University of Winnipeg.\n\nForeword by the Very Reverend Dr. Stan McKay\n\nPreface\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n1.
