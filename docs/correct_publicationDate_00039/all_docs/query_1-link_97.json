        "text": "My name is Blake and I am a 21 year old college student in Philadelphia. I love to read books for pleasure, however i am not an avid science fiction reader. Putting this aside, i decided to read Stranger in a Strange Land, the Uncut edition and i must say that it is one of my favorite books i have ever read. I know there are a lot of Heinlein works out there, so i am asking for your suggestions on which one to read next. I was thinking about JOB: A Comedy of Justice, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, The Man Who Sold the Moon, Tunnel in the Sky, or I Will fear no Evil. To tell you the truth, i have read many forums and have seen a lot of varying opinions. Please give me some suggestions on what Heinlein work i should read next, and please give a brief explanation why. Thanks a lot and i hope to see some responses in the near future.\n\nI think that (though it has grown on me over the years -- which, according to some, means I seriously need my head examined ) I'd put I Will Fear No Evil at the bottom of the list, actually. I'm gathering that Stranger is all you've read so far, so I'd suggest either The Man Who Sold the Moon, which is some of his classic shorter works (and one short novel) and part of his Future History series, or The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (which is tangentially connected to same).\n\nIf you'd like to read the stories in The Man Who Sold the Moon in context, pick up a copy of The Past Through Tomorrow. That, along with one story from MWStM (\"Let There Be Light--\", left out of PTT), Orphans of the Sky, and Time Enough for Love covers the series as originally envisioned. (The Number of the Beast, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, and To Sail Beyond the Sunset are also part of that series, continuing the timeline further and tying together many of Heinlein's disparate stories, but not necessary, though -- with the exception of NotB, which puts most people off -- quite enjoyable.) Job is an excellent book in its way, but quite different ... however, it may be more to your taste after Stranger, with its biting satiric edge.\n\nPersonally, The Man Who Sold the Moon would be my choice, as it introduces you to several of the concepts that Heinlein returns to frequently, as well as beginning the larger series as a whole... if you like it, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the series; if not, then you won't have a massive tome sitting around unread....\n\nConcur, jd - and if you would like to try what were originally written as juveniles, bcl62, though none the less enjoyable for that, my suggestions would be Have Space-suit - Will Travel, or Tunnel in the Sky.\n\nOh, and don't expect Starship Troopers to be anything like the film - [SIZE=-1]Paul Verhoeven lifted the character names and the Bugs out of the book, and left practically all that was Heinlein behind.\n\n[/SIZE]\n\nj.d. said:\n\n[SIZE=-1]\n\n[/SIZE]though it has grown on me over the years -- which, according to some, means I seriously need my head examined\n\nShows what the loss of neurons can do - very sad!\n\nConcur, jd - and if you would like to try what were originally written as juveniles, bcl62, though none the less enjoyable for that, my suggestions would be Have Space-suit - Will Travel, or Tunnel in the Sky.\n\nOh, and don't expect Starship Troopers to be anything like the film - [SIZE=-1]Paul Verhoeven lifted the character names and the Bugs out of the book, and left practically all that was Heinlein behind. [/SIZE]\n\nShows what the loss of neurons can do - sad!\n\nMy only caution about the juveniles is that, as enjoyable as they are as single novels, when read in order as a series, they take on extra dimensions... like his Future History, you see a broader tapestry, and it's really quite an impressive achievement. And, no... the film and the book of Starship Troopers are nothing alike...\n\nUm - do you think there are enough potential takers that we could get that T-shirt reprinted (most of Heinlein's work has been)\n\nIf he's chewed through \"Stranger\", and enjoyed it, probably not a short story person? I'd go for Mike and \"the moon's a harsh mistress, myself.\n\nThe idea of reading \"Time enough for love\" without having read \"Methusela's children\" seems very odd to me; sort of like buiding a house from the roof down (which is, of course, how one builds a space elevator)\n\nAnd I quite enjoyed the number of the beast; more so in fact than the cat who walked through walls (no disparagement of our own trans-mural feline intended, evidently)\n\nUm - do you think there are enough potential takers that we could get that T-shirt reprinted (most of Heinlein's work has been)\n\nIf he's chewed through \"Stranger\", and enjoyed it, probably not a short story person?

It's the capstone of the series, as Heinlein originally saw it, I think...\n\nAnd I also liked Number of the Beast quite a bit... but most people I know did not; quite the contrary. As for The Cat Who Walks Through Walls... I did enjoy that one, and with it having part of the novel connected to The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, it would be best to read the latter first, then Cat, I think...\n\nAlthough I am a big Heinlein fan, it has been a long time since I read most of Heinleinâ€™s work. As I recall, Time Enough for Love and I Will Fear No Evil were 2 of my favorites.\n\nI think that a lot of people found I Will Fear No Evil irritating because the bulk of the book is spent dealing with (apparently) sexual shenanigans that the situation provides. While it does indeed do so, it is also exploring through that various levels of relationships, what it means to be a person of either sex, what love actually is (how to define the different types)... a lot of other things that aren't normally Heinlein territory (one might think, until looking through his other books a bit more carefully ... it's there, it's just not in the foreground, so to speak, except for Stranger, until after I Will Fear No Evil, when it became one of his major themes). Time Enough for Love had much the same effect because of some of the aspects of sexuality he was looking at... and a lot of people feel he doesn't handle the subject well to begin with. I'd agree that he wobbles a fair amount on that one. However, I think people forget how much humor, irony, and satire are directed toward these things in a lot of his work, too. He's saying some serious things, but he doesn't mind taking a poke at himself along the way, either... or lampooning (though showing it baldly) a lot of the stereotypical male attitudes, for that matter.\n\nI think that a lot of people found I Will Fear No Evil irritating because the bulk of the book is spent dealing with (apparently) sexual shenanigans that the situation provides.

They may have been the first Sci-Fi I read dealing with the adult subject matter as openly as they did. I also liked Heinleinâ€™s sense of humor. The combination was a real winner for me at them time. They may not hold up well to a current reading, but I have many books to go through before I start re-reading old favorites.\n\nWell, the only reason I put out the caveats is because most people who enjoy Heinlein in general tend to have some reservations about those. Though I Will Fear No Evil had to grow on me as a whole, I did always like the humor; Time Enough for Love has always been a personal favorite -- though there I also caution because it really is better read as the capstone of the Future History series (well, until The Number of the Beast, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, and To Sail Beyond the Sunset took that particular series even further).\n\nAlso, something I should have mentioned earlier, in connection with Stranger: Red Planet, though one of the juveniles, has some connections with that novel, both thematically (certain aspects of the philosophies explored, especially in relation to the Martians and immortality) and concerning the milieu -- thematically, Red Planet (or certain aspects of it) can be seen as a prequel to Stranger, while chronoligically (within the story) Stranger is a prequel to Red Planet! Also, thematically (immortality) Beyond This Horizon also has some similarities to certain aspects of Stranger in a Strange Land as well. (And now, darn it, I want to go dig my Heinlein out of storage and reread them.... )\n\nI appreciate the caveats, j.d. Heinlein seems to be a writer that many readers either love or strongly dislike. Although I read a fair smattering of Sci-Fi as kid, I did not discover Heinlein until after college. My first was Stranger in a Strange Land. I liked it, but I was not overwhelmed. Next, I read Time Enough for Love, which hooked me on Heinlein. I have read several of his latter works, but only a few of his earlier ones. I have not read any of the Future History before Time Enough for Love. I intend to remedy that at some point."
