        "text": "Possibly the worst Heinlein novel, and certainly not worthy of being listed by iTunes as \"an essential.\" Overwrought, rambling, silly, absurd, poorly-edited, repetitious; truly an awful, awful book. If you can only read one Heinlein book, choose \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", \"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\", or one of his excellent young adult books such as \"Have Spacesuit, Will Travel\" or \"Citizen of the Galaxy\".\n\nLook: I'm a huge Heinlein fan. I enjoy even his bad books, and have reread almost all of them, even such iffy offerings as \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"The Day After Tomorrow\". But this? #Epicfail. Do not buy. Seriously.\n\nA man's brain transplanted into a woman's body, and then shares the brain with the previous female occupant. There should follow a fascinating story about what it's like to be female and male, or how difficult it would be to have the brain of a man and the body of a woman. The only problem? Heinlein clearly has no idea what women think, or even that they are intelligent beings. This book could serve as the ultimate insult to the female psyche, and I only wish I could go back in time to smack Heinlein across the face for this insipid and insulting book. I can only imagine that early on in the book, Heinlein realized he had no idea what women think so he decided to create a woman who thought how he would want her to think which is about sex. Nonstop sex with anyone that he/she comes in contact with which is really only half of the problem. The main characters are brainless morons, making the plot and conflict non existent. What a waste. This had the potential to be a very interesting read, and I would love to see someone with talent and intelligence handle this subject matter, but clearly Heinlein was not that person. Don't waste your money."
