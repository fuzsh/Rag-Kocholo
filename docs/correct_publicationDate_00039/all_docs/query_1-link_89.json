His exceptional abilities lead Valentine to become many things to many people: freak, scam artist, media commodity, searcher, free love pioneer, neon evangelist, and martyr. Heinlein won his second Hugo Award for this novel, sometimes called his ”divine comedy” and often called his masterpiece. Stranger in a Strange Land caused controversy and uproar when it was first published. Still topical and challenging today it is in the great tradition of stories that endure through the power of the author’s imagination that stretches from Gulliver’s Travels to 1984. This Blackstone audiobook is the ”as published” version, read from an Ace paperback published in 1987. It is not the uncut, uncensored version that Heinlein originally wrote , but which wasn’t published until 1991.\n\nPodkayne of Mars\n\nFrom the author of Friday and Rocketship Galileo comes this classic tale featuring the grand master of science fiction’s most remarkable hero*ine.

But she s about to learn some things about war and peace because Uncle Tom, the ambassador plenipotentiary from Mars to the Three Planets Conference, is traveling not quite incognito enough, and certain parties will stop at nothing to sabotage negotiations between the three worlds.\n\nGlory Road\n\nE. C. ‘Scar’ Gordon was on the French Riviera recovering from a tour of combat in Southeast Asia , but he hadn’t given up his habit of scanning the Personals in the newspaper. One ad in particular leapt out at him:’ARE YOU A COWARD? This is not for you. We badly need a brave man. He must be 23 to 25 years old, in perfect health, at least six feet tall, weigh about 190 pounds, fluent English, with some French, proficient in all weapons, some knowledge of engineering and mathematics essential, willing to travel, no family or emotional ties, indomitably courageous and handsome of face and figure. Permanent employment, very high pay, glorious adventure, great danger. You must apply in person, rue Dante, Nice, 2me tage, apt. D.’How could you not answer an ad like that, especially when it seemed to describe you perfectly? Well, except maybe for the ‘handsome’ part, but that was in the eye of the beholder anyway. So he went to that apartment and was greeted by the most beautiful woman he’d ever met. She seemed to have many names, but agreed he could call her ‘Star.’ A pretty appropriate name, as it turned out, for the empress of twenty universes. Robert A. Heinlein’s one true fantasy novel, Glory Road is as much fun today as when he wrote it after Stranger in a Strange Land. Heinlein proves himself as adept with sword and sorcery as with rockets and slide rules and the result is exciting, satirical, fast paced, funny and tremendously readable a favorite of all who have read it. Glory Road is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment with a typically Heinleinian sting in its tail. Tor is proud to return this all time classic to hardcover to be discovered by a new generation of readers.\n\nFarnham’s Freehold\n\nHugh Farnham was a practical, self made man, and when he saw the clouds of nuclear war gathering, he built a bomb shelter under his house, hoping for peace and preparing for war.

After surviving a global nuclear war, Farnham had no intention of being anybody’s slave, but the tyrannical power of the Chosen Race reached throughout the world. Even if he managed to escape, where could he run to…\n\n?\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress\n\n11 cassettes/15.5 hours For his many finely crafted novels, Robert A. Heinlein has been hailed as the master of science fiction. His detailed stories of future politics and society create unforgettable visions of the ways technology can shift the basic tenets of life. ‘The Moon is a Harsh Mistress‘ takes you to the moon in 2075.

Heinlein delivers a wild and intriguing classic of science fiction. Written at the dawn of the 1970s, this novel is the brilliantly shocking story of the ultimate transplant.\n\nAs startling and provocative as his famous Stranger in a Strange Land, here is Heinlein’s grand masterpiece about a man supremely talented, immensely old, and obscenely wealthy who discovers that money can buy everything.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach Smith was immensely rich — and very old. Though his mind was still keen, his body was worn out. His solution was to have surgeons transplant his brain into a new body. The operation was a great success — but the patient was no longer Johann Sebastian Bach Smith. He was now fused with the very vocal personality of his gorgeous, recently deceased secretary, Eunice — with mind-blowing results! Together they must learn to share control of her body.\n\nFriday\n\nEngineered from the finest genes, and trained to be a secret courier in a future world, Friday operates over a near-future Earth, where chaos reigns.

As natural accidents occurred without cease, Alex knew Armageddon and the Day of Judgement were near. Somehow he had to bring his beloved heathen, Margrethe, to a state of grace, and, while he was at it, save the rest of the world…\n\n.\n\nFor Us, the Living\n\nFrom Grandmaster Robert A. Heinlein comes a long lost first novel, written in 1939 and never before published, introducing ideas and themes that would shape his career and define the genre that is synonymous with his name. July 12, 1939 Perry Nelson is driving along the palisades when suddenly another vehicle swerves into his lane, a tire blows out, and his car careens off the road and over a bluff. The last thing he sees before his head connects with the boulders below is a girl in a green bathing suit, prancing along the shore…\n\n. When he wakes, the girl in green is a woman dressed in furs and the sun drenched shore has transformed into snowcapped mountains. The woman, Diana, rescues Perry from the bitter cold and takes him inside her home to rest and recuperate. Later they debate the cause of the accident, for Diana is unfamiliar with the concept of a tire blowout and Perry cannot comprehend snowfall in mid July. Then Diana shares with him a vital piece of information: The date is now January 7. The year…\n\n2086. When his shock subsides, Perry begins an exhaustive study of global evolution over the past 150 years. He learns, among other things, that a United Europe was formed and led by Edward, Duke of Windsor; former New York City mayor LaGuardia served two terms as president of the United States; the military draft was completely reconceived; banks became publicly owned and operated; and in the year 2003, two helicopters destroyed the island of Manhattan in a galvanizing act of war. This education in the ways of the modern world emboldens Perry to assimilate to life in the twenty first century. But education brings with it inescapable truths the economic and legal systems, the government, and even the dynamic between men and women remain alien to Perry, the customs of the new day continually testing his mental and emotional resolve. Yet it is precisely his knowledge of a bygone era that will serve Perry best, as the man from 1939 seems destined to lead his newfound peers even further into the future than they could have imagined. A classic example of the future history that Robert Heinlein popularized during his career, For Us, the Living marks both the beginning and the end of an extraordinary arc of political, social, and literary crusading that comprises his legacy. Heinlein could not have known in 1939 how the world would change over the course of one and a half centuries, but we have our own true world history to compare with his brilliant imaginings, rendering For Us, the Living not merely a novel, but a time capsule view into our past, our present, and perhaps our future. The novel is presented here with an introduction by acclaimed science fiction writer Spider Robinson and an afterword by Professor Robert James of the Heinlein Society.\n\nVariable Star (With: Spider Robinson)\n\nA never before published masterpiece from science fiction’s greatest writer, rediscovered after more than half a century.

But Jinny wasn’t willing to wait. And when Joel asked her what they were going to do for money, she gave him a most unexpected answer. She told him that her name wasn’t really Jinny Hamilton it was Jinny Conrad, and she was the granddaughter of Richard Conrad, the wealthiest man in the solar system. And now that she was sure that Joel loved her for herself, not for her wealth, she revealed her family’s plans for him he would be groomed for a place in the vast Conrad empire and sire a dynasty to carry on the family business.

To Jinny’s surprise, and even his own, he turned down her generous offer and then set off on the mother of all benders.

As the noted editor and critic David G. Hartwell has observed, ‘Lazarus’ comments are acute, lively and intelligent.’ And here they are, compiled in one beautifully designed trade paperback, filled with illuminations and illustrations by renowned Science Fiction artist Stephen Hickman, for the delight of the millions of Heinlein fans around the world.\n\nWaldo & Magic, Inc.\n\nNorth Power Air was in trouble.
