        "text": "I’m rereading The World Beyond the Hill (1989) by Alexei and Cory Panshin. It’s a brilliant, Hugo award-winning work (1990), that chronicles the Golden Age of Astounding Science-Fiction by focusing on John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and A. E. Van Vogt. If that sounds similar to Alec Nevala-Lee’s recent Hugo award-nominated book Astounding you’d be right. But each book tells a very different story covering the same history. Nevala-Lee felt L. Ron Hubbard was the big fourth rather than Van Vogt. The Panshins work to explain science fiction’s literary evolution in a historical context leaving you feeling their book is primary about science fiction. Whereas Nevala-Lee works to describe the psychology of the men who wrote this science fiction, leaving you feeling its a biography of these men. You need to read both books to get the big picture.\n\nI’ve been a Heinlein fan since I was 12, but mostly for the work he wrote in the 1950s. Rereading The World Beyond the Hill inspires me to study Heinlein’s stories from the 1940s. The Panshins often point out there were contextual differences between the magazine publications and book publications, sometimes reflecting changes in Heinlein’s personal philosophy. The Panshins make a great case that Heinlein was doing truly groundbreaking SF writing in the 1940s that reshaped the genre. And they explain how John W. Campbell worked with Heinlein, Asimov, and Van Vogt to push science fiction in new directions.\n\nI worry that the current attacks on Campbell’s many faults forget to consider his virtues. I believe anyone who vilifies Campbell because of the Nevala-Lee’s book should also give Campbell a fair shake by reading The World Beyond the Hill. I’m less concerned with the biographies of these men than how science fiction developed. After I finish rereading The World Beyond the Hill I plan to read The Pleasant Profession of Robert A. Heinlein by Farah Mendlesohn.\n\nThe Panshins made a great case for how exciting science fiction was during the early years of Campbell’s editorship, especially regarding Heinlein. Their descriptions of Heinlein’s early stories reveal far more than I got when I read them. I’ve decided they deserve a close rereading.\n\nThe Panshins quote from Heinlein’s July 1941 Guest of Honor speech at the third Worldcon in Denver:\n\nThere won’t always be an England—nor a Germany, nor a United States, nor a Baptist Church, nor monogamy, nor the Democratic Party, nor the modesty tabu, nor the superiority of the white race, nor aeroplanes—they will go—nor automobiles—they’ll be gone, we’ll see them go. Any custom, technique, institution, belief, or social structure that we see around us today will change, will pass, and most of them we will see change and pass.\n\nHeinlein worked to illustrate that in his early stories, especially the ones he called Future History stories. Later on Heinlein would admit his particular extrapolations were wrong, but I believe the essence of science fiction is the attempt to imagine such change.\n\nAs I read these books about Heinlein I want to study his development by rereading the stories as they were published. I looked around for a convenient list of them in chronological order but didn’t find any that I liked. So I made one.\n\nJust looking at this list shows how productive Heinlein was in the 1940s, especially 1941.\n\nStory Issue Magazine “Life-Line” 1939-08 Astounding “Misfit” 1939-11 Astounding “Requiem” 1940-01 Astounding “If This Goes On –” p1 1940-02 Astounding “If This Goes On –” p2 1940-03 Astounding “Successful Operation” 1940-Spring Futuria Fantasia as “Heil!” “Let There Be Light” 1940-05 Super Science Stories “The Roads Must Roll” 1940-06 Astounding “Coventry” 1940-07 Astounding “Blow-Ups Happen” 1940-09 Astounding “Magic, Inc.” 1940-09 Unknown “Sixth Column” p1 1941-01 Astounding “Sixth Column” p2 1941-02 Astounding “Sixth Column” p3 1941-03 Astounding “–And He Built a Crooked House” 1941-02 Astounding “Logic of Empire” 1941-03 Astounding “Beyond Doubt” 1941-04 Astonishing Stories “They” 1941-04 Unknown “Solution Unsatisfactory” 1941-05 Astounding “Universe” 1941-05 Astounding “–We Also Walk Dogs” 1941-07 Astounding “Methuselah’s Children” p1 1941-07 Astounding “Methuselah’s Children” p2 1941-08 Astounding “Methuselah’s Children” p3 1941-09 Astounding “Lost Legacy” (excerpt) 1941-08 Super Science Novels Magazine “Elsewhen” 1941-09 Astounding “By His Bootstraps” 1941-10 Astounding “Common Sense” 1941-10 Astounding “Lost Legacy” 1941-11 Super Science Stories “My Object All Sublime” 1942-02 Future combined with Science Fiction “Goldfish Bowl” 1942-03 Astounding “Pied Piper” 1942-03 Astonishing Stories “Beyond This Horizon” p1 1942-04 Astounding “Beyond This Horizon” p2 1942-05 Astounding “Waldo” 1942-08 Astounding “The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag 1942-10 Unknown Worlds “The Green Hills of Earth” 1947-02-08 Saturday Evening Post “Space Jockey” 1947-04-26 Saturday Evening Post “Columbus Was a Dope” 1947-05 Startling Stories “It’s Great to Be Back” 1947-07-26 Saturday Evening Post “Jerry Was a Man” 1947-10 Thrilling Wonder Stories “Water is for Washing” 1947-11 Argosy “The Black Pits of Luna” 1948-01-10 Saturday Evening Post “Gentlemen, Be Seated” 1948-05 Argosy Magazine “Ordeal in Space” 1948-05 Town & Country “Our Fair City” 1949-01 Weird Tales “Nothing Ever Happens on the Moon” p1 1949-04 Boy’s Life “Nothing Ever Happens on the Moon” p2 1949-05 Boy’s Life “Gulf” p1 1949-11 Astounding “Gulf” p2 1949-12 Astounding “Delilah and the Space-Rigger” 1949-12 The Blue Book “The Long Watch” 1949-12 The American Legion Magazine “Farmer in the Sky” p1 1950-08 Boy’s Life “Farmer in the Sky” p2 1950-09 Boy’s Life “Farmer in the Sky” p3 1950-10 Boy’s Life “Farmer in the Sky” p4 1950-11 Boy’s Life “Between Planets” p1 1951-09 The Blue Book “Between Planets” p2 1951-10 The Blue Book “The Puppet Masters” p1 1951-09 Galaxy “The Puppet Masters” p2 1951-10 Galaxy “The Puppet Masters” p3 1951-11 Galaxy “The Year of the Jackpot” 1952-03 Galaxy “The Rolling Stones” p1 1952-09 Boy’s Life as “Tramp Space Ship” “The Rolling Stones” p2 1952-10 Boy’s Life as “Tramp Space Ship” “The Rolling Stones” p3 1952-11 Boy’s Life as “Tramp Space Ship” “Project Nightmare” 1953-04/05 Amazing Stories “Sky Lift” 1953-11 Imagination “The Star Beast” p1 1954-05 F&SF “The Star Beast” p2 1954-06 F&SF “The Star Beast” p3 1954-07 F&SF “Double Star” p1 1956-02 Astounding “Double Star” p2 1956-03 Astounding “Double Star” p3 1956-04 Astounding “The Door Into Summer” p1 1956-10 F&SF “The Door Into Summer” p2 1956-11 F&SF “The Door Into Summer” p3 1956-12 F&SF “The Menace from Earth” 1957-08 F&SF “Citizen of the Galaxy” p1 1957-09 Astounding “Citizen of the Galaxy” p2 1957-10 Astounding “Citizen of the Galaxy” p3 1957-11 Astounding “Citizen of the Galaxy” p4 1957-12 Astounding “The Man Who Traveled in Elephants” 1957-10 Saturn “Tenderfoot in Space” p1 1958-05 Boy’s Life “Tenderfoot in Space” p2 1958-06 Boy’s Life “Tenderfoot in Space” p3 1958-07 Boy’s Life “Have Space Suit-Will Travel” p1 1958-08 F&SF “Have Space Suit-Will Travel” p2 1958-09 F&SF “Have Space Suit-Will Travel” p3 1958-10 F&SF “All You Zombies …” 1959-03 F&SF “Starship Troopers” p1 1959-10 F&SF “Starship Troopers” p2 1959-11 F&SF “Podkayne of Mars” p1 1962-11 If “Podkayne of Mars” p2 1963-01 If “Glory Road” p1 1963-07 F&SF “Glory Road” p2 1963-08 F&SF “Farnham’s Freehold” p1 1964-07 If “Farnham’s Freehold” p2 1964-08 If “Farmham’s Freehold” p3 1964-10 If “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” p1 1965-12 If “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” p2 1966-01 If “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” p3 1966-02 If “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” p4 1966-03 If “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” p5 1966-04 If “I Will Fear No Evil” p1 1970-07 Galaxy “I Will Fear No Evil” p2 1970-08/09 Galaxy “I Will Fear No Evil” p3 1970-10/11 Galaxy “I Will Fear No Evil” p4 1970-12 Galaxy\n\nJames Wallace Harris, 11/5/19"
