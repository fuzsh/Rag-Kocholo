        "text": "\"Even though I walk\n\nthrough the darkest valley,\n\nI will fear no evil,\n\nfor you are with me;\n\nyour rod and your staff,\n\nthey comfort me\" - Psalm 23:4.\n\nDavid faced the temptation to fear, but he avoided it by determining not to be afraid no matter how dark the situation was. Instead he chose to focus on the fact that the Lord was with him to comfort him in his troubles. Fear is the great enemy of your faith, and even if the Lord speaks to you (as some have said, \"If only I had a word from the Lord\"), you will still fear some evil coming upon you unless you decide not to. When the women went to the tomb to anoint Jesus, they found an angel who told them \"not to fear.\" Yet even with that exhortation, Matthew wrote, \"So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy\" (Matthew 28:8). Are you afraid? Has God revealed His will to do, told you not to fear, yet you still find fear gripping your heart and restricting your actions? Do you see that you must act in the midst of fear and not wait for the fear to subside or go away?"
