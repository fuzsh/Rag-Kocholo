        "text": "Manoel de Oliveira made a career out of being the oldest living filmmaker; every profile about him and his work (Including ours) will go on and on about how long he worked and how he saw movies grow from shorts in picture houses to CGI-filled adventures. No directors alive today are even close to Oliveira’s 106 years on earth, proving that he was a true one-off. None of today’s filmmakers are really that close to Oliveira’s record, and very few over 90 years old are actively working on films, but some senior directors are getting close.\n\nWe’re talking about directors who’ve seen it all. Some started their careers in the 1940s, and some picked it up later in life, but they’ve all seen a lot, and many of them are still going. A lot has been said about Clint Eastwood’s new film and about how it might be his last one yet. That’s sad, but it’s also incredibly impressive to imagine him still making movies; who knows, perhaps he’s got another 12 years left in him like Oliveira did.\n\nThere are quite a few lists that attempt to list all the oldest living directors, but this one tries to push the barrier just a bit, just enough, to include 100 directors. There is no way that this is a finalised list, as there are almost certainly directors hiding under rocks or else just not noted down due to happenstance. As I work on the various profiles and BTS of this site, I make note of every director I mention for a project I’m working on; I pull from this list for this article. If you happen to notice I’ve forgotten a director, please tell me; I’d like this to be as factual as possible.\n\nOriginally, I wrote as ‘up to date’ as possible instead of factual, but that made me consider something: this list is depreciating by the second; unless I decide to keep updating it, it will be out of date very quickly, as all of the people on the list are well above the average human age. Frankly, I think updating the list means this loses its time capsule value, so I have no interest in that. So, we’re timing this as of early February 2024. In a year, perhaps I will revisit the list and post an updated one; I’m not sure.\n\nA few notes before the article itself: Firstly, technically, first on the list should be Edgar Morin, the 102-year-old director who co-directed Chronicle of a Summer with Jean Rouch; however, seeing as this was his only directed film and he is far better known in other fields, I thought including him wouldn’t feel quite correct, as is it really fair to call him a director?\n\nI’d also like to note the directors who passed who would have been on the list as I was either working on this list or just before I did. Norman Jewison and Janusz Majewski.\n\nThe 100 Oldest Living Directors"
