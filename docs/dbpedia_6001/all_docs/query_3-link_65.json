        "text": "James Caan glances around the dimly lit living room of the big rustic home in Bel Air that he has just sold. The actor built the house years ago at the peak of his career; it is a movie star's home, richly paneled and filled with leather furniture and cluttered with Western-style paintings and reproductions of Remington statues. One of the actor's former wives said something unprintable about the masculine nature of this place. \"It's the one funny thing she ever said,\" Mr. Caan remarks with a laugh.\n\nGiving up the house and its often vivid, painful memories and trying again to accommodate his new family is, for Mr. Caan, a metaphor for renewing himself. At 51, he is at an age when most movie actors find it virtually impossible to revive their careers. But Mr. Caan, whose personal and professional life crumbled in the 1980's, who virtually disappeared from the screen, has suddenly returned to the Hollywood mainstream, held in the same regard as his actor friends Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman and Robert Duvall.\n\nAdvance word on his co-starring performance opposite Bette Midler in the big-budget musical saga \"For the Boys\" has given an extraordinary boost to a moribund career that was jump-started last year by \"Misery.\" The film, directed by Mark Rydell, opens Friday, after lavish publicity and strong favorable reaction from preview audiences. Mr. Caan is enjoying it all: he has been mentioned as an Academy Award nominee, \"friends\" he hasn't heard from in years are calling (\"Typical,\" he says with a laugh), and new scripts are arriving. \"They're from 20th Century Fox and Universal,\" he says. \"It used to be Podunk Productions.\n\n\"Thank God,\" he adds quietly. \"The No. 1 luxury of success is being able to choose the director you want to work with.\" He pauses. \"There was a pretty scary period there for me. A pretty dead period. I missed a decade.\"\n\nIn \"For the Boys,\" Mr. Caan portrays a song-and-dance man named Eddie Sparks, a U.S.O. performer who teams up with a character named Dixie Leonard (Ms. Midler) in the early days of World War II. The film covers half a century. They entertain troops through the advent of television and the McCarthy era, through Korea and Vietnam. The two become show business legends. The Caan character, as written, is a faintly sleazy figure, compulsively unfaithful, forced to yield to the Communist witchhunt and betray a friend. As performed by Mr. Caan, however, Sparks is multidimensional, weak but compassionate.\n\n\"Somehow Jimmy's acting never shows,\" says Ms. Midler. \"Believe me, his acting school is so much better than mine. Mine is a school of mugging. He has a more languid way of working. And everything he does is very small -- he's a master of the small gesture, the flickering eyelash; everything was exquisitely right.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
