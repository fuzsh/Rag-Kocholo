        "text": "You would think as a Steve McQueen film \"The Reivers\" would have been seen by more people. 38 Letterboxders have watched this, 38! I saw this many many years ago and didn't quite get it. Too young, late night tv, I don't know?\n\n\"The Reivers\" was based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name. I didn't know that. Apparently William Faulkner's book was a bestseller back in 1962 and when Mark Rydell decided to direct this in 1969 there were reservations about how to do it. That I can understand, and although I haven't read the book, the movie is a difficult one to categorize.\n\nIt starts off as a lighthearted comedy but has so many awkward…\n\nThis is a Steve McQueen movie that I don’t expect many people have seen seen . Not because it’s a terrible film ( it’s not ) but because of the racist and sexist undertones would prevent any TV station showing it .\n\nIn turn-of-the-century Mississippi, an 11-year-old boy comes of age as two mischievous adult friends talk him into sneaking the family car out for a trip to Memphis and a series of adventures.\n\nThis feels like an extended version of an episode of The Little House on The Prairie but where John Boy calls his black friend the N Word and beats up friendly prostitutes.\n\nApart from the unpolitically correct stuff it’s quite a jolly story .\n\nUnsurprisingly ,…\n\nYou could tell him that you lied to your Aunt Callie, your Uncle Ike, and your Cousin Zack. All that’s easy. But how are you gonna tell him that you quit?\n\nA young boy is convinced to go on a road trip with two men in the new, fancy family car and gets himself into trouble along the way. This is a strange little film, starting off as a comedy and then going fairly dark. It shows period racism and sexism without much restraint, tiny moments of slapstick in between. Would I say this is a good movie? Eh. Not particularly. It isn’t one I would ever have any interest to revisit. It was nice to see Steve McQueen in…\n\nI can imagine Clark Gable playing Steve McQueen’s role in this film in about 1936 as he played raffish, unflappable men who got through life with humor and confidence in their own appeal. McQueen seems a lot colder than Gable as a lot of his roles rely on him being stoic and standoffish. That made him seem cool in the 1960s when he played bad guys who carried out crimes in style and hippies of the counterculture movement selected him as one of the defining stars of their generation. I would never count him among my favorite stars and I don’t think he was able to display any self awareness or humor in most of his films. The great stars,…\n\nNOTE: This review deals only with the book. I am posting the movie review separately as part of my Adapted Screenplay Challenge (4)\n\n===========================================================\n\nThe copy of William Faulkner's comic classic that I read was the original hard-cover edition published by Random House on June 4, 1962, just one month before the Nobel Prize laureate's death by heart attack at Wright's Sanatorium in Byhalia, MS. The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction was awarded to the Mississippi native for this novel posthumously in 1963. The book covers 305 pages, divided into eight chapters.\n\nIn Chapter i, a narrator identified as Grandfather, but later known to us as Lucius Priest, tells us of when he was eleven years old and working for his…\n\n#8 of 12 films in my Adapted Screenplay Challenge (4)\n\nIt's fitting that the duties of adapting this book into a screenplay fell to the writing team of Irving Dover Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. Married since 1946, they first collaborated in 1957 on a script adaptation of William Faulkner's novel \"The Hamlet\" (released as \"The Long, Hot Summer\"). It was followed in 1959 by their collaboration in bringing the Nobel Prize laureate's bestseller \"The Sound and the Fury\" to the big screen.\n\n\"Faulkner is absolutely our favorite novelist of all American novelists.\" ~ Irving Ravetch\n\nFor their 1963 work on the movie \"Hud,\" the screenwriting couple won a WGA Award for Best Written American Drama and were nominated for…"
