        "text": "PLYMOUTH — It started as a weekend project by a young, out-of-work actor and became the film that exposed Squam Lake to the world.\n\n'On Golden Pond' is now 25-years-old and many of the artists and local people who made that movie possible gathered at Plymouth State University this past weekend to share their memories of the film's making.\n\nThe stage of the Hannaway Theatre looked like a country porch with wicker furniture and flowers set up for 'Silver Goes Golden: An Evening of Music and Memories' at the Silver Cultural Arts Center Saturday night.\n\nErnest Thompson, who wrote the original play at 28-years-old; Doug McKeon, who played young Billy Ray; and composer Dave Grusin sat down with local supporter Sid Lovett. Director Mark Rydell was scheduled to appear but he had to cancel due to a project in San Francisco.\n\nThe presentation was a roundtable discussion as well as an opportunity for the three to share what inspired them to do the movie that became a cultural icon and is the only major film made in New Hampshire.\n\n'On Golden Pond' is the story of an elderly couple whose estranged daughter drops off her young son in their care as she and her fiancee go to Europe.\n\nThompson, who was born in Vermont and grew up in New Hampshire, wrote the original play over a Memorial Day Weekend.\n\n\"When I was a kid, we went every summer to a house on a lake in Maine,\" he said. \"As soon as school was out, you get to the lake in Maine.\"\n\nThompson said after the discussion that, while living in Santa Monica, a stop at a hardware store reminded him of the general stores in New England. \"It got me in the mind of New England.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1978, 'On Golden Pond' debuted off-broadway before coming to Broadway and reached the attention of Henry Fonda. \"He took it upon himself to go to the theater in New York. Without him I don't know if the movie would have ever been made.\"\n\nThe setting on Squam Lake was a decision made as preparations for the movie got underway. The original story took place in Maine and that is where it originally was to be shot. When Ryerson made the decision to shoot on Squam, new plans were put in place.\n\nFor the camp setting, Lovett was asked to call its owner, Tom Chalmers, a resident of New York who was in Tokyo at the time. When Lovett called Chalmers and told him a movie was going to be made on Squam requiring his house, Chalmers asked, \"Is it 'On Golden Pond?' And [he] knew his house was appropriate for the play.\"\n\nSince then a bevy of local residents took part in the production, several of whom attended the Plymouth event.\n\nCharlene Joyce Willingham had acted as a production assistant as well as an assistant to Katherine Hepburn. Joe Cummings drove for Hepburn and did logistics for transportation. Brenda Fournier was a seamstress.\n\nRichard and Carol Hogan owned the Staffordshire Inn where many members of the cast and crew stayed during production and Richard Sutton was Henry Fonda's driver. Sutton now has a large collection of photographs from the production, in an effort to rebuild the house where the action was set.\n\nAll those in attendance stood up to applause. Thompson also gave tribute to Bill Mead, who recently died, and who at the time owned property used in the production.\n\n\"Bill became our host; our trucks parked in his yard,\" Thompson said, also saying he was \"fascinated by filmmaking\" and his children became drivers and production assistants.\n\nComposer Dave Grusin was invited onto the set by Rydell to get a feel for the scenery before writing his score.\n\n\"I don't pretend it was long enough to absorb how beautiful this place really is,\" Grusin said. \"I'm sure after that weekend I jumped into whatever work [I had]. It could have flown away had I not seen this place. I don't get to come on location as a rule.\"\n\nRydell, however, \"thought I ought to get some osmosis going.\" When composing, \"I started to think about what this place sounded like. Geography can play a big part in how I accompany something; that territory has a sound.\"\n\nGrusin played the pastoral opening theme and \"New Hampshire Hornpipe.\"\n\nDoug McKeon was 14-years-old when he got the part of Billy Ray, the young man who bonds with his grandfather, Norman Thayer. During his fifth and last audition, he spoke with Rydell who asked if he could drive a boat and other outdoor things. \"I lied like a fish,\" he said.\n\nMcKeon started in show business at five-years-old after his sibling was \"spotted by a talent scout,\" though his parents \"were leery of the whole idea of getting us involved.\"\n\nHis parents were in the audience at the event, though his wife was at home, eight months pregnant with their third child.\n\nMcKeon said time on the set was \"80 percent of the time on one location. You hung around the set, you sat down in a chair, and heard some great stories.\"\n\nKatherine Hepburn, while sometimes difficult to be around, was one of his best teachers. \"She referred to me as 'boy' through most of the production.\" On the last day of filming \"she put her arm around me and said 'Doug, it was a pleasure working with you.'\"\n\n\"She came in, took over, and she was at times a true and royal pain in the ass and complicated and difficult and amazing,\" Thompson said of Hepburn, in whose criticism \"I was given the greatest info that a writer could have.\" He asked the audience to applaud in tribute.\n\nThompson also remembered Henry Fonda, \"who was just the soul of this production.\"\n\nThe film was released 25 years ago, though for many reasons it still resonates with viewers. Thompson pointed out that no other major film has been shot in New Hampshire since \"On Golden Pond,\" a fact he calls \"regrettable.\"\n\nSen. Carl Johnson of Meredith is working on strengthening the state film office and bringing more filming into the state.\n\n\"It seems to have struck a chord with people and it's not going away,\" Thompson said, quoting a line used by Norman Thayer in the film that was cut from the movie: \"Golden Pond is very near wherever you are.\"\n\nWhile the play has been translated into 25 languages, it is still a theme that resonates.\n\nThompson also thanked New Hampshire in general for the film and locals expressed their thanks as well."
