        "text": "Dabney Coleman\n\nDABNEY COLEMAN HONORED WITH\n\nSTAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME\n\nWatch Daney Coleman unveil his star on the Walk of Fame below.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce proudly honored actor Dabney Coleman with the 2,533rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, November 6, 2014 at 11:30 a.m. PST. The star in the category of Television was unveiled at 6141 Hollywood Boulevard in front of the newly developed Eastown. Along with friends and family, actress Penelope Ann Miller was on hand for the festivities.\n\nHelping emcee and Hollywood Chamber President/CEO Leron Gubler to unveil the star were directors Dennis Klein and Mark Rydell who worked with Coleman. “The charismatic Dabney Coleman has a well-deserved reputation as one of Hollywood’s finest actors. He constantly delivers characters with diverse and poignant roles,” stated Leron Gubler. “We are pleased to welcome him to the Hollywood Walk of Fame.”\n\nDabney Coleman was born in Austin, Texas in 1932 and was raised in Corpus Christi. He attended both the Virginia Military Institute and the University Of Texas School Of Law before deciding on a career in acting. He also served in the military, with the US Army, Special Service Division.\n\nFilm, stage, and television actor Dabney Coleman has most recently been seen as ‘Commodore Kaestner’ in the Martin Scorsese directed and produced series “Boardwalk Empire” for HBO, for which he won two SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. He was also recently seen in “Char·ac·ter” a documentary on six illuminating filmmakers and friends. A documentary is currently in the works title “The Dabney Coleman Documentary” and will be released in 2015.\n\nColeman’s TV career began with a recurring role of the boyfriend in “That Girl.” He proceeded to play a succession of doctors on the NBC soap opera “Bright Promise,” cops on the CBS detective series “Cannon,” and politicians in the ABC TV-movie “The President’s Plane Is Missing.” His popular persona solidified in Norman Lear’s innovative soap spoof, “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.” Coleman was ‘Merle Jeeter’, the shady father of a child preacher, who eventually became mayor of the fictional Fernwood and reprised the role on the spin-off, “Forever Fernwood.”\n\nColeman’s despicable, egotistical, insecure ‘Bill Bittinger’ on “Buffalo Bill” earned him a Golden Globe nomination and two Emmy Award nominations. As an unsavory sportswriter in “The ‘Slap’ Maxwell Story,” Coleman received an Emmy Award nomination and won a Golden Globe Award. He then starred in and was an executive consultant of “Drexell’s Class.” In 1994, Coleman starred in “Madman of the People” as an opinionated magazine columnist who frequently clashes with his publisher-daughter.\n\nMuch of Coleman’s earlier television work was in comedy yet his roles were equally rich in drama. He was nominated for a Golden Globeand won an Emmy for his dramatic performance in the television movie “Sworn to Silence” opposite Liam Neeson and Peter Coyote. He received an Emmy nomination for the miniseries “Baby M,” one of the first shows to deal with surrogate mothers, and got another Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for a role in “Columbo.” He was nominated for a CableAce Award for his performance in the HBO television special “Murrow.” In 2001, he began a three-season run on “The Guardian” alongside Simon Baker. Most recently he was seen in an episode of “Law & Order: SVU” as a con struggling with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nColeman has been in countless comedy and dramatic series as well as many Movies-of-the-Week including “The Texan,” “Kiss My Act,” “My Date with the President’s Daughter,” “Kidnapped: In the Line of Duty,” “Must Be Santa,” “Guilty of Innocence: The Lenell Geter Story,” and TNT’s “Never Forget.” He recently played Jenna Elfman’s irascible father in “Courting Alex,” and in TNT’s “Heartland” where he re-teamed with “The Guardian” creator David Hollander.\n\nColeman’s most memorable film roles include the villainous boss in “9 to 5.” the pompous director in “Tootsie,” and the sympathetic role of Jane Fonda’s boyfriend in “On Golden Pond.” Other film credits include “Where the Heart Is,” “War Games,” “Cloak and Dagger,” “Dragnet,” “Meet the Applegates,” “Amos and Andrew,” “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “You’ve Got Mail,” “Inspector Gadget,” “Stuart Little,” “Moonlight Mile,” and “Domino.”\n\nColeman is involved in several such charities as: The Christian Children’s Fund, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Wounded Warrior Project.\n\n★★★\n\nABOUT THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME www.WalkOfFame.com\n\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is an internationally-recognized Hollywood icon.
