        "text": "“You’ve come a long way. I appreciate that you’re traveling all this way to see me,” Monte Hellman said after I rang his doorbell and he opened the door. I did leave Hollywood early in the morning—I took the Metro Rail from Hollywood and Vine to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles, there I hopped on the Greyhound bus to Palm Springs, and from there, a Lyft ride brought me to the gated community near Palm Springs where Mr. Hellman now resides.\n\nBut that itinerary was peanuts compared to his long and rewarding journey as a director whose film output includes four early Jack Nicholson films, “Flight to Fury” and “Back Door to Hell” (both 1964) and two westerns “The Shooting” and “Ride in the Whirlwind” (both 1966), as well as “Two-Lane Blacktop” (1971), the action drama “Cockfighter” (1974), and another western of his, “China 9, Liberty 37” (1978). Films that film buffs are all very familiar with.\n\nJust to pick out one of them, “Two-Lane Blacktop” (1971)—which is undoubtedly one of the greatest road movies ever made. The film stars singers/musicians and first-time actors James Taylor and Dennis Wilson (co-founder and member of the Beach Boys), with Warren Oates and Laurie Bird in the other leading roles. The slow-paced, atmospheric cross-country car race, about everything and nothing, with great visuals and limited dialogue, has always been a favorite film of mine, and the subtle cult masterpiece looks even better today than it did almost fifty years ago. This might as well be your typical Monte Hellman picture, although his entire body of work has so much more to offer.\n\n“Two-Lane Blacktop” (1971, trailer)\n\nHis first film was “Beast from the Haunted Cave” (1959), brought to him by Roger Corman. The film was shot back-to-back with Corman’s “Ski Troop Attack” (1960), using the same locations in Deadwood, South Dakota; the same cast, including Michael Forest, Frank Wolff, Sheila Noonan, Richard Sinatra, and Wally Campo; the same screenwriter, Charles B. Griffith; the same cinematographer, Andrew M. Costikyan, and so on—which is so like Roger Corman, who introduced Mr. Hellman to filmmaking. He mentored him, just as he launched the careers of so many others.\n\nBorn in New York City in 1932, and moving with his family to Los Angeles when he was five, Mr. Hellman made all of his films on a tight budget. The all-round, multi-skilled film craftsman who made very personal character studies was not only a film director and editor—in the latter capacity, also working for other film directors such as Roger Corman (“The Wild Angels,” 1966), Bob Rafelson (“Head,” 1968), Sam Peckinpah (“The Killer Elite,” 1975), and Jonathan Demme (“Fighting Mad,” 1976).\n\nOver the years, Mr. Hellman also shot the prologue for Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dementia 13” (1963); he was dialogue director (Roger Corman’s “The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre,” 1967); finished Mark Robson’s “Avalanche Express” (1979) in post-production; did second unit work for Paul Verhoeven (“RoboCop,” 1987), and co-executive produced Quentin Tarantino’s debut film “Reservoir Dogs” (1992). His latest film as film director was “Road to Nowhere” (2010), the first feature he directed since “Iguana” (1988).\n\nMr. Hellman still has a huge following in Europe and his work is much praised by the French because the films he directed have a European—or at least a foreign—flavor. Consequently, it’s no surprise that he has always been fond of foreign-language films.\n\nIn November 2018, he moved from Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills to Palm Desert, California. That’s where I met him five months later at his new home, in March 2019. He still got invited to attend numerous events in Los Angeles, but, as he said, ‘I can’t go. Los Angeles is too far. I haven’t been back since I moved here.’\n\nDuring our conversation in his living room, you couldn’t ignore the posters on the walls, all beautifully framed, of films that are very dear to him.\n\nMr. Hellman, since you don’t live in Los Angeles anymore, don’t you miss the film community?\n\nNo, there is no film community; at least, I was not a member of any film community.\n\nNevertheless, you had an impressive career, didn’t you?\n\nIt was sporadic, but it was fine.\n\nDon’t you think you were underestimated as a filmmaker?\n\nI don’t think so. I actually had a very good score with critics—I don’t believe in critics, but they liked my movies from the very beginning. I never had a problem with them liking me, I had a problem with me respecting them because they may have liked me for the wrong reasons.\n\nWhat gave you the passion to become a filmmaker?\n\nThe Saturday matinee serials like “The Lone Ranger” and the “Tarzan” films, that was really the beginning of my love of cinema.\n\nWas it the storytelling that inspired you, or was it because of the performances, the directing…?\n\nNo, I wasn’t thinking about those things. I just liked movies.\n\nOut of the many films you made, would you consider “Two-Lane Blacktop” [1971] a highlight of your career or your most personal film?\n\nI enjoyed making it, and it was one of my best films, but my most personal film was “Road to Nowhere” [2010]. If I didn’t have any other film, that’s the one I would keep.\n\nYou also edited your films. When you were shooting on the set, did you edit already in your mind?\n\nNot really. I was an editor and I edited most of my own movies, but I wasn’t thinking about that when I was on the set.\n\nHow did you work with your actors? Did you have a specific approach or working method?\n\nNo, because whatever I did, I didn’t do it consciously. I didn’t think about it. I didn’t analyze it. Later in my career, when my movies came out on DVD or Blu-ray, I saw interviews with some of the people I worked with. Millie Perkins [Jack Nicholson’s co-star in “The Shooting” and “Ride in the Whirlwind,” both 1966] told a lot about my direction because I didn’t know what I was doing. She said that whenever she would ask me a question, I would always say, ‘I don’t know.’ I wouldn’t even answer her question [laughs]. So that was my first insight. I think I worked from my instincts. I didn’t think about things too much.\n\nHow did you cast your actors?\n\nI usually cast actors from their look, from their appearance, and then I was always surprised because they were so inspired. I didn’t expect that. The most surprising actress I worked with was Shannyn Sossamon [“Road to Nowhere”]. I cast her because she looked apart, and when she turned out to be so brilliant, it was a pleasure, but it was also surprising. And I thought there was a little bit of Laurie Bird in her [1953-1975, actress who appeared in “Two-Lane Blacktop” and “Cockfighter”]; quite a bit of Shannyn’s dialogue even comes from things I remember from Laurie when we did “Two-Lane Blacktop” and “Cockfighter” together.\n\nYou have worked with a lot of amazing people. You even turned James Taylor into a magnificent actor.\n\nHe was really amazing, but he still hasn’t seen the movie. I think he doesn’t like to see himself.\n\nYou made four films with Jack Nicholson, also four with Warren Oates [1928-1982], who was one of the best character actors of his generation. According to Richard Linklater, he was one of the reasons why you’d love “Two-Lane Blacktop” because ‘there was once a God who walked the earth named Warren Oates.’ What made him so special?\n\nHe was such a special human being, to begin with. I first saw him in a stage production of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” playing the part Jack Nicholson played in the movie, and he popped into my mind for “The Shooting” [1966]. We both liked literature, that was one of our common interests, and we became close friends. So I really enjoyed working with him, and he was always very surprising to me. But generally, I don’t give direction at all. Which means I don’t direct, and I expect my actors to be the same way. I don’t want them to act. They don’t have to be the character: they are the character. The character is whoever you cast; that actor becomes the character. That’s why casting is the most important job of the director. After that, there’s nothing more to do. So if people ask me how I direct, I say, ‘I don’t.’ And if actors ask me how to act, I say, ‘Don’t.’ Most great directors don’t direct, you don’t tell an actor what to do. It’s like Clint Eastwood once said, ‘How can I tell Morgan Freeman how to act?’ So you don’t. That’s the bottom line.\n\nDoes that mean you don’t rehearse?\n\nI don’t rehearse, that’s right. That doesn’t mean it’s all very fresh—not if you do fifty takes. But I don’t rehearse.\n\nHow do you know which take is the right one?\n\nSometimes I don’t know until I’m in the editing room.\n\nAs an editor, do you leave a lot of material on the cutting room floor?\n\nI would think so. I shoot probably a ratio of ten to one, so I leave ninety percent on the cutting room floor. Maybe even more than that, because if I have different angles, there’s duplication here and there.\n\nWhen you see Jack Nicholson on television in a movie, do you still recognize the actor and the person that you’ve known now for so many years?\n\nIt’s difficult for me to say because I haven’t seen all his movies. I loved working with him, but I like a different kind of movie than the ones he’s been making. My favorite movies from the last few years are “Silence in Dreamland” [2013, original Italian title “Silencio en la tierra de los sueños”] and “Saint George” [2016, original Portugese title “São Jorge”].\n\nCan you name a film that you didn’t like and that everybody else seemed to enjoy?\n\n“La La Land” [2016]. I just couldn’t watch it.\n\nWhen they send you a script, how do you judge it? What does it take for you to accept it or turn it down?\n\nI work emotionally, so it has to interest me. I never think about things like the structure or anything like that. That doesn’t interest me.\n\nHow do you work with your cinematographer?\n\nI worked with the same cinematographer for years. Josep M. Civit made my last four movies, I guess. We didn’t have to talk; we just knew what to do.\n\nAre film reviews important to you? Do you read them?\n\nOh yes, I read them [laughs]. I have enough of a curiosity to be interested; also if the reviewer doesn’t like the movie, I’m always interested.\n\nDo critics usually know what they’re writing about?\n\nNo. Very few. The only person I ever met who really understood one of my movies—the movie was “Two-Lane Blacktop”—was a man who worked in a brewery; he came to me and told me what he saw. Now that didn’t matter to me, I mean if someone had a different interpretation, that was okay too, you know. But I thought it was interesting; here you had this one guy who saw what I saw. And what made the film interesting from my point of view was that the first edit was three and a half hours. But according to our contract, it couldn’t be more than two hours. So I cut it down to two hours, and then I kept cutting to what it is now, which is an hour and three quarters. So after we reached the contractual obligation, I still cut it because I wanted to.\n\nDid that also same happen with your other films? “Cockfighter” [1974], for example?\n\nThat’s the only film, with “Road to Nowhere,” that I didn’t edit completely. I edited the scenes with the actors, and Lewis Teague edited all the scenes with the cockfights. I intended to edit “Road to Nowhere,” but my protégée was a woman [Céline Ameslon] that I had convinced to go back to Paris to get a degree in editing after she had been there as a director. So when I brought her over to be my assistant, we watched the dailies for three days, and we talked about them. After that, I said, ‘Why don’t you start editing? Start with the first scene?’ And she did, and when we watched it, I suggested she’d finish the movie. And she did.\n\nWas it easy for you to let it go, especially since you were used to editing everything yourself?\n\nWell, what can I say? She was better than me, that’s why I urged her to do it.\n\nHow important is editing to you?\n\nI was a stage director, and in movies, the directing and the editing combined make up what a stage director does. So directing and editing are equally important.\n\nWe just talked about film critics. What about critics such as Roger Ebert, Rex Reed, or Pauline Kael? Did you know any of them personally?\n\nNo, I didn’t know them, but Pauline Kael, for some reason, disliked my movies so much that she would even mention me when she was reviewing another movie, not mine. She would say, ‘It’s almost as bad as a Monte Hellman film.’ She never liked any of my movies.\n\nHow important were the box office receipts to you? Were they crucial?\n\nObviously not, because I never made a movie that made a lot of money [laughs]. It was something that I wished for, but I can’t say it was crucial because I lived without it.\n\nWhen your movies are on TV, or people buy a DVD or Blu-ray of your movies, do you get paid for that?\n\nNo, I never get paid for that. Every once in a while I get a check for a few dollars from the Directors Guild as my receipt for box office sales or DVD sales in Holland or something. So as far as I’m concerned, there’s not a lot of money in making movies.\n\nPeople always talk about the film business, but shouldn’t it be called film art?\n\nI don’t use the word film anymore. It goes back to the early days when they called them motion pictures. I still call them pictures now. Film is no longer accurate because we don’t make movies on film anymore. They’re pictures. So I make pictures.\n\nAnd do you see your own pictures again from time to time?\n\nNo. Except “Road to Nowhere” that I show to people, and every time I think I’m going to watch a couple of minutes, but in the end, I watch the whole thing.\n\nDo you still watch a lot of movies?\n\nNo. I try. I can tell if a movie is good after one or two minutes. That works, at least for me. After two minutes, if I feel it’s not right for me, I don’t watch the rest of it. I look for something very unique. With “Saint George,” which I saw at the Academy when I was a member of the committee for foreign-language movies, I knew right away it was a movie for me—from the first few frames.\n\nIs that what you also try to achieve as a filmmaker? Capture the attention of the audience from the very beginning?\n\nWhen you’re directing on the set, you’re experiencing it differently. As a filmmaker, I have basically learned to shut off my brain, and so everything is through my instincts. I work from the unconscious. And that’s also what I tell my actors, ‘Shut off your brain, don’t think too much. Just let it happen.’ Only then it will come from the unconscious, not from the conscious.\n\nDid you ever teach film students?\n\nI had a few students for a while; we called it a masterclass but everything I know about movies, I can teach or tell you in a minute or two. So what we would do in those masterclasses is watch movies and talk about them afterward. On the other hand, I think I learned more from those students than what they learned from me, especially in terms of using modern technology.\n\nAnd what would be your advice to film students now?\n\nDon’t [laughs]. If they want to be a director, I’d say, ‘Don’t.’\n\nIf you would be able to start all over again, would you choose the same path?\n\nI didn’t choose it, and I don’t think I would have any choice. But I would still do the same thing.\n\nYou have a lot of books here in your living room. Are they film books?\n\nNo, there’s only one, a biography of David Lean.\n\nYou admire him?\n\nI do. I was at his 80th birthday party. I didn’t know him, but I managed to attend that party.\n\nDid you ever have problems financing your films?\n\nAlways. I never had a project of mine that got made, except for “Road to Nowhere,” that was the first one. Before that, somebody always called me and offered me a movie. They hired me as their director, I was a director for hire. So I never had one of my projects green-lighted until “Road to Nowhere.” My daughter [Melissa Hellman] had raised the money for it, and she became my producer, but we haven’t made another movie since then. It’s always difficult to finance a movie.\n\n“Road to Nowhere” was your first film in more than twenty years. Was the money issue the reason why it took you so long to make another feature?\n\nMelissa got tired of seeing “Two-Lane Blacktop” over and over again, so she said it was time for me to make another movie. And one day, she told me, ‘Let us just stop waiting for other people to give you permission and the money to make a movie.’ So she went out on her own and raised most of the budget that we used to shoot the film on location in Los Angeles, North Carolina, London and Italy. Then she raised more money to get us through post-production.\n\n“Road to Nowhere” (2010, trailer)\n\nAre you still a member of the Academy?\n\nYes. But I’ve only been a member of the Academy for like ten years. I was put up for membership over the years—twice—before I was finally taken in. Now let me see [takes his wallet]. I became a member of the Academy in… where’s my membership card… in 2007. Only in 2007 because I was never accepted. But I’m happy to be in, and I was a member of the foreign-language committee, so every year I would see 35 out of 90 movies. I have become friends with the directors of the foreign movies that I mentioned, because of my love for their movies. They don’t necessarily broaden my horizon, but the few movies that I love, I see them over and over again—I see them a dozen times, sometimes two dozen times. I know those directors because I write them for a copy of the movie after I had seen it at the Academy and liked it so much.\n\nDo foreign films have something that you may not find in American films?\n\nAlways. In recent years I’ve become less and less interested in American movies. I don’t watch them very much.\n\nDo you still have the opportunity to watch foreign-language films, now that you’re no longer based in Los Angeles?\n\nIt has become difficult now, but I still get screeners once in a while.\n\nYou directed Sam Peckinpah in “China 9, Liberty 39” [1978]. How do you remember working with him?\n\nWhen I did that movie, I already knew him, and I kept trying to have him come over and play a part, but he just didn’t show up. I had him set for three different parts, and when we wanted to shoot his scenes, no Sam Peckinpah, so someone else did it. Then the last day of shooting, I tried to get hold of him again, and he finally showed up. He was completely insane and very difficult because he would be under the influence of one drug or another. But I loved him; he was a wonderful, crazy person.\n\nHow about Roger Corman? Do you remember the first time you met him?\n\nNo, I don’t remember that, but I was aware of him when I was working at a studio over by Griffith Park. I had my lunch there, and he was there one day shooting a movie. He was very important: without him, I wouldn’t be here. He launched many careers over the years.\n\nIs it true that you also knew James Dean?\n\nI knew him at UCLA, and I said to him I didn’t think he would make it as an actor because he was too short. He was a star, he looked great, he was a wonderful actor, but I told him, ‘It’s too bad you’re not tall, Jimmy’ [laughs].\n\nYou co-executive produced Quinten Tarantino’s first film “Reservoir Dogs” [1992]. What does an executive producer do?\n\nHe is usually the one who comes up with the money, and that’s what I did.\n\nDid he like your films?\n\nYes, he loves my work, but there is no movie he doesn’t love [laughs].\n\nMay I take a picture of you before I leave?\n\nNo, I don’t do pictures anymore. I want people to remember me like I was [laughs].\n\nPalm Desert, California\n\nMarch 30, 2019\n\nFILMS\n\nBEAST FROM THE HAUNTED CAVE (1959) DIR Monte Hellman PROD Gene Corman SCR Charles B.
