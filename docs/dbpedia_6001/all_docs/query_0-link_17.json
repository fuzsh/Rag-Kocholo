        "text": "American actress and acting teacher (1928–2021)\n\nBeverly Joanne Linville[citation needed] (January 15, 1928 – June 20, 2021) was an American actress. She later taught at the Stella Adler Academy, Los Angeles.[1] Linville guest-starred as a Romulan Commander on Star Trek: The Original Series.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLinville was born in Bakersfield, California, on January 15, 1928.[2] She attended high school in Long Beach, California, and worked as an oral surgeon's assistant before studying acting. While she studied with Stella Adler, she danced professionally to pay her tuition.[3]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nLinville's motion-picture credits include The Goddess (1958), Scorpio (1973), Gable and Lombard (1976), A Star Is Born (1976), The Seduction (1982), and James Dean (2001).\n\nIn 1959, Linville appeared on the CBS daytime drama The Guiding Light as Amy Sinclair, a runaway drug addict whose daughter was nearly taken from her as part of an illegal adoption scam ring. Linville starred in two television presentations of One Step Beyond— as Aunt Mina in the episode \"The Dead Part of the House\" (1959) and as Karen Wadsworth in the episode \"A Moment of Hate\" (1960).\n\nIn 1961, she starred in the Twilight Zone episode \"The Passersby\".[4] Also in 1961, she was in the second episode of The Defenders with William Shatner.\n\nIn 1968, she guest-starred as a Romulan commander in Star Trek[5] episode \"The Enterprise Incident\". In this episode she falls for Spock after taking him aboard her spaceship for violating Romulan territory. She offers Spock an opportunity to command a ship of his own if he agrees to lead some Romulans on board the Enterprise and bring it to Romulus. Spock pretends to go along with her in order to steal the cloaking device from her ship, and he is successful. In the aftermath, however, Spock tells her that although “military secrets are the most fleeting of all”, he hopes that what they exchanged between them is “something more permanent”. This role earned Linville cult status, and remains her best-known performance.[6]\n\nHer other television appearances include Decoy (in the premiere episode), Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Have Gun Will Travel, Coronado 9, Checkmate, Adventures in Paradise, Empire, Gunsmoke (three episodes), Dr. Kildare, Ben Casey, Gunsmoke, Route 66, The Eleventh Hour, I Spy, Bonanza, The Fugitive, The F.B.I. (two episodes), The Invaders (two episodes), Felony Squad, Hawaii Five-O (three episodes), Kojak, Columbo: Candidate for Crime, The Streets of San Francisco (two episodes), Barnaby Jones, Switch, Charlie's Angels, CHiPs, Mrs. Columbo, Dynasty, and L.A. Law.\n\nShe appeared in the made-for-TV movies House on Greenapple Road (and the resulting series Dan August) (1970), Secrets (1977), The Critical List (1978), The Users (1978), and The Right of the People (1986).[7] Linville played the mother of Janine Turner's character in Behind the Screen.[8] Linville and George Grizzard starred in \"I Kiss Your Shadow\", the final episode of the television series Bus Stop.\n\nLinville portrayed Valeria in the Broadway production Daughter of Silence (1961).[9] Linville played gossip columnist Hedda Hopper in the television movie James Dean (2001), directed by her former husband Mark Rydell, who also played Jack L. Warner.\n\nWriting and teaching\n\n[edit]\n\nLinville retired from acting in the 1980s to concentrate on teaching.[6] She taught \"The Power of Language\" course at the Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles in 1985.[5] One of her students was Mark Ruffalo, who wrote that she \"does not theorise about great acting. She is great acting\".[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLinville was married to actor/director Mark Rydell from 1962 until their divorce in 1973. Linville had two children with Rydell: Amy and Christopher, both actors.[6] Her daughter Amy Rydell reprised her mother's role as Romulan commander Charvanek on episodes 10 and 11 of fan production Star Trek Continues.\n\nLinville was also an amateur tennis player, and appeared at charity events where people were invited to pay $100 to challenge her in a game.[6]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nLinville died on June 20, 2021, aged 93.[10]\n\nCalifornia portal\n\nFilm portal\n\nTelevision portal\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1950 Copper Canyon Showgirl Uncredited 1958 The Goddess Joanna 1973 Scorpio Sarah Cross 1976 Gable and Lombard Ria Gable A Star Is Born Freddie 1982 The Seduction Dr. Weston 2005 Beyond Lovely Voice over Short film\n\nPartial television credits\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1954–58 Studio One Various roles 6 episodes 1956 The Kaiser Aluminum Hour Gwyneth Episode: \"Gwyneth\" 1957 The Alcoa Hour Daisy Sage Episode: \"The Animal Kingdom\" Decoy Molly Orchid Episode: \"Stranglehold\" Robert Montgomery Presents — Episode: \"Return Visit\" 1958 Alfred Hitchcock Presents Millie Manners Season 3 Episode 36: \"The Safe Place\" Kraft Television Theatre Pat Colson Episode: \"Killer's Choice\" The United States Steel Hour Martha Purvis Episode: \"Old Marshals Never Die\" Suspicion Lois Episode: \"Someone Is After Me\" 1959 Guiding Light Amy Sinclair The Further Adventures of Ellery Queen — Episode: \"Bury Me Deep\" The Third Man Marguerite Episode: \"Confessions of an Honest Man\" Playhouse 90 June Episode: \"In Lonely Expectation\" The DuPont Show of the Month Antonia Episode: \"I, Don Quixote\" Deadline Peg Joyce Episode: \"Charm Boy\" One Step Beyond Aunt Minna Boswell Episode: \"The Dead Part of the House\" 1960 Hotel de Paree Jennifer Wheatley Episode: \"Sundance and the Barren Soil\" Have Gun – Will Travel Maggie Episode: \"Saturday Night\" 1961 Gunsmoke Beulah Parker Episode: \"Old Yellow Boots\" Our American Heritage Alice Hathaway Roosevelt Episode: \"The Invincible Teddy\" The Twilight Zone Lavinia Episode: \"The Passersby\" 1962 Bus Stop Donna Gibson Episode: \"I Kiss Your Shadow\" 1962 Gunsmoke Susan Bart Episode: \"The Ditch\" 1963 The Dick Powell Show Aura Tomlin Episode: \"Everybody Loves Sweeney\" 1966 Bonanza Maggie Dowling Episode: \"The Bridegroom\" 1967 The Invaders Angela Smith Episode: \"Moonshot\" 1968 Professor Pat Reed Episode: \"The Pit\" Star Trek Romulan Commander Episode: \"The Enterprise Incident\" 1969 Judd, for the Defense Paula Miles 2 episodes 1970 House on Greenapple Road Connie Durstine TV movie 1970 Hawaii Five-0 Camilla Carver Kiss the Queen Goodbye 1973 Columbo Vickie Hayward Episode: \"Candidate for Crime\" 1973 The Streets of San Francisco Rosemary Episode: \"Before I Die\" 1974 Martha Howard Episode: \"One Chance to Live\" 1979 Barnaby Jones Mimi Nettleson Chiles 2 episodes Charlie's Angels Maggie Brill Episode: \"Angels Go Truckin\" Mrs. Columbo Paula Episode: \"Falling Star\" 1981 Behind the Screen Zina Willow Episode: \"Pilot\" 1982–83 Dynasty Claire Maynard 2 episodes 1986 The Right of the People Rosalind TV movie 1988 L.A.
