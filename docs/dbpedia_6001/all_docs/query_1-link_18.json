        "text": "Born on March 23, 1929 in New York City\n\nThanks for everything, so far...\n\nAmerican actor, film director and producer.\n\nRydell's initial training was in music. As a youth, he wanted to be a conductor. He studied acting at The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City. His first notable roles were as Walt Johnson on The Edge of Night and as Jeff Baker on As the World Turns, which he played from December 12, 1956 to 1962. When he would not sign a long-term contract to remain on ATWT, the producers had his character die in a car crash.\n\nHe started directing episodes on different TV-series, like The Virginian, Mr Novak, Ben Casey, I Spy, Gunsmoke and others, before starting directing feature movies in 1967, though still occasionally acting under other directors.\n\nAs Jeff Baker on As the World Turns TV-series 1956 to 1962.\n\nFeature film acting debut in Crime in the Streets 1956, with John Cassavetes\n\nOne of the early TV credits as director, episode of The Virginian 1963.\n\nThe Fox 1967 marked Rydell's feature film debut as a director, made in Canada and based on a novella by D.H. Lawrence, starring Anne Heywood, Kier Dullea and Sandy Dennis. The movie did very well on the European markets, and after it's general release in 1968 became the fifth biggest grossing English-speaking movie that year. (Even if most countries in Europa are dubbing movies, it's still considered as English-speaking)\n\nThe Reivers 1969, based on a William Faulkner novel. Starring Steve McQueen.\n\nBehind the scenes, during The Cowboys 1972, starring John Wayne, Bruce Dern and a lot of kids.\n\nCinderella Liberty 1973, starring James Caan, Marsha Mason and Eli Wallach\n\nBehind the scenes pic, Mark Rydell had an acting role in The Long Goodbye 1974, here with director Robert Altman and Elliott Gould who played Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.\n\nHarry and Walter Go to New York 1976, a period caper comedy starring Michael Caine, Elliott Gould, James Caan and Diane Keaton. A notorious big flop at the box offices.\n\nThe Rose 1979, starring Bette Midler, Alan Bates and Frederic Forrest, a story loosely based on the life of singer Janis Joplin. It sold many tickets and albums.\n\nOn Golden Pond 1981, starring Henry Fonda, Katherine Hepburn and Jane Fonda. Based on a hit play by Ernest Thompson. The movie became a big hit and was the second highest grossing film of 1981. Rydell earned his only Oscar nomination.\n\nThe River 1984, starring Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising Spacek's performance and the cinematography, but criticizing the screenplay, execution, and Gibson's performance, whom many considered to have been miscast. It was a box office failure, grossing only $11.5 million against an $18 million budget.\n\nMark played Meyer Lansky in Havana 1990, seen here with Alan Arkin and Robert Redford.\n\nFor the Boys 1991, starring Bette Midler and James Caan as entertainers among the troops during WWII.\n\nIntersection 1994, starring Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, Lolita Davidovich and Martin Landau, a remake of the French film Les choses de la vie 1970 by Claude Sautet, and set in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nJames Dean 2001, A TV movie with James Franco as James Dean. Besides directing Mark also played the role of Jack Warner.\n\nEven Money 2007 is Rydell's last credited directorial effort to date, a crime movie starring Forest Whitaker, Nick Cannon, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Kelsey Grammer, Tim Roth, Carla Gugino, Jay Mohr and Ray Liotta.\n\nStill acting though, seen here in Chicanery 2017.\n\nPost by teleadm on\n\nHaven't seen all of Rydell's movies, but of the ones I've seen my favorite remains The Cowboys. It's taken its fair share of critical lumps, especially for promoting violent revenge, but I just can't help finding it irresistible. Besides, The Cowboys has many other traits that make it a great western, including the storytelling, the dialogue, and the terrific chemistry between The Duke and the kids.\n\nI like The Cowboys, it's rousing pre-Jaws score by John Williams, and I liked how John Wayne played a character in his own age, with arthitis and arthrotis and all such pains, and he's great with the kids.\n\nIt also has Bruce Dern at his slimiest.\n\nI've also read old reviews that was horriefied that the kids take revenge. As it takes time before National Institutions of a young Nation to work and function and become known on the praire, such thing takes time. So I had no problem that the kid's took revenge."
