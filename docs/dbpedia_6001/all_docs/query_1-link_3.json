        "text": "I'm a hopeful person; I'm not a cynic. I believe that cynicism is a cancer for an artist. It's a way of insulating yourself from experience. If you're cynical about something, it becomes removed and can't invade you. If you believe that life has to do with an engagement of issues and personalities that make you young and vital, it's hard to be anything but hopeful.\n\n[After making \"On Golden Pond\"] There's no question in my mind that Henry Fonda is the greatest living actor. I have great admiration for a number of great actors, but there's something very special about Henry Fonda. He is an actor's actor, and I worship his skills."
