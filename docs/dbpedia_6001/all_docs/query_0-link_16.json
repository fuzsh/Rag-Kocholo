        "text": "Lee Grant, the Oscar-winning actress (“Shampoo”) says she decided after her win to try to direct since good roles for older women were limited. It turns out that was about the halfway point of her 98 year (so far) life. What followed was a narrative feature (“Tell Me a Riddle”) and several documentaries, including “Down and Out in America,” which won an Oscar.\n\nWhen we last ran our list of the oldest living feature film directors in late 2022, where Grant stood was a mystery. Since her breakout in William Wyler’s “The Detective Story” (1951), her first nomination, her year of birth was unclear. But recently she has clarified that that she was born in 1925. That makes her, to the best of our knowledge, older than any of her peers.\n\nBelow are listed the 25 oldest. Since our most recent list, Norman Lear, Robert M. Young (both of who briefly were the oldest), and Norman Jewison among others have passed away. Also, several of the oldest-living directors that were overlooked previously are now listed.\n\nThe three oldest (apart from Grant, Roger Corman and Mel Brooks) remain vital figures, including regularly engaging in social media and in the case of Brooks recently accepting an honorary Oscar. Corman recently noted that Grant outranked him in age on a just-published similar list compiled by the British Film Institute. Their list however does not include seven names we’ve determined should be included (to give them credit, they had three not on our compilation).\n\nThe following is a list of every known living director who has helmed at least one feature-length narrative or documentary film. It was compiled from multiple sources and independent research with every effort made to be comprehensive. Apart from the BFI, IMDb also compiles something similar. Every effort has been made to make this the most complete list.\n\nWe found 26 other directors 90 or older, with two — Clint Eastwood (93) and Roman Polanski (90) still active. Among those older, Frederic Wiseman is still going strong, with his documentary “Menus-Plaisirs: Les Troisgros” winning awards recently from both the New York and Los Angeles Critics.\n\n[Editor’s note: In instances where a photograph of the director could not be used, a production still or screenshot from one of their most renowned works appears.]\n\nWith editorial contributions from Wilson Chapman.\n\nLee Grant — 98\n\nBorn: October 31, 1925\n\nKnown for: “Tell Me a Riddle” (1980), “Down and Out in America” (1985)\n\nRoger Corman — 97\n\nBorn: April 5, 1926\n\nKnown for: “The Little Shop of Horrors” (1960), “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1961), “Wild Angels” (1967)\n\nMel Brooks — 97\n\nBorn: June 27, 1926\n\nKnown for: “The Producers” (1968), “Blazing Saddles” (1974), “Young Frankenstein” (1974)\n\nMargot Benacerraf — 97\n\nBorn: August 14, 1926\n\nKnown for: “Araya” (1959)\n\nEverett Chambers — 97\n\nBorn: August 19, 1926\n\nKnown for: “Run Across the River” (1961), “The Lollipop Cover” (1965)\n\nAlvin Rakoff — 97\n\nBorn: February 6, 1927\n\nKnown for: “Hoffman” (1969), “Say Hello to Yesterday” (1970)\n\nPere Portabella — 97\n\nBorn: February 11, 1927\n\nKnown for: Warsaw Bridge (1990), The Silence Before Bach (2007)\n\nAllen Baron — 96\n\nBorn: April 14, 1927\n\nKnown for: “Blast of Silence” (1961), “Terror in the City” (1964)\n\nJerry Schatzberg — 96\n\nBorn: June 26, 1927\n\nKnown for: “Panic in Needle Park” (1971), “Street Smart” (1985)\n\nToshio Masuda — 96\n\nBorn: October 5, 1927\n\nKnown for: “The Rusty Knife” (1958), “Red Hankerchief” (1964), “Tora!
