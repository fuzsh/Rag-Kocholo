        "text": "The trees of Central Park were alternating shades of maize and red, and the stream of yellow taxis along Fifth Avenue blended into the autumn palette. Mark Rydell stood at the window of his 24th-floor hotel suite and smiled at the bold landscape, fraught with contrasts - of golds and grays, of nature and construction, of people and machines.\n\nThe people moving across town looked different from the farmers he had come to know last year, when he directed the filming of ''The River,'' which opens Wednesday at the Beekman Theater. The steel facades they work within, and hide behind, seemed so distant from the weathered homes, and faces, of the Tennessee Valley.\n\n''It's hard sometimes to believe it when you compare them superficially, but the essential elements of life and family and work are really common to both environments,'' said Mr. Rydell. ''The issues transcend the tapestry. They are basic, fundamental, primitive.'' ''The River,'' starring Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek, is the story of the Garveys - a young family determined to save their farm and rural heritage in the face of a flood, technical progress and economic pressure.\n\nThe farmer's plight has been explored recently in other movies, such as ''Country'' and ''Places in the Heart.'' All three movies contain elements of a family's devotion to their farm, a devastating force of nature, an unsympathetic bureaucracy and a strong-willed woman who binds her family during adversity.\n\n''The River'' is the last of these movies to be released, but Mr. Rydell, who won an Academy Award nomination for his direction of ''On Golden Pond,'' did not lament competition.\n\n''If so many filmmakers are drawn to the subject, it must mean that we are recognizing real concerns,'' he said. ''There must be a communal sense that we are losing something, letting something valuable go. I am grateful that they are devoting their attention to a great problem.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
