        "text": "At Work\n\n1950\n\nThe Whirlwind hall computer at MIT is the first machine to generate real-time graphics on CRT display. Initially the system could light 256 points. It's purpose demands development of better graphics terminals for real-time interaction and animation.\n\nFirst video game is to be seen at the Canadian National Exhibition. Bertie the Brain was built by University of Toronto, but abandoned soon after that occassion, playing tic-tac-toe displayed on panels with lightbulbs behind.\n\n1951\n\nFirst commercialy available computer is the Ferranti Mark 1 from Manchaster, UK. A custom NIMROD unit was assembled for two shows playing the game of Nim. Showing the game state by series of lights, this exhibit attracted more attention then any other.\n\n1952\n\nThe very first video game I know about- OXO aka Noughts and Crosses, was written by A.S. Douglas at Cambridge University. The tic-tac-toe game puts a player against one of kind Edsac computer, and is therefore rather unknown.\n\n1955\n\nMIT's Lincoln Laboratory starts tests of first transistorized computer, the TX-0. It is a prototype to test various graphics applications.\n\n1956\n\nGraphics system of TX-0 transforms computer usage- from batch processing to interactivity. Software for pattern recognition and on-line program debugging is in use.\n\n1957\n\nDeployment of the TX-0 brought need to use scientific symbols. To enable some 200 keys input first graphical interactive text editor is developed.\n\n1958\n\nAs the first video game is usually considered Tennis For Two by William H. Donner. It was made for Model 30 analog computer. As a screen was used oscilloscope, on which electric signals were sending signals that would draw two lines for the field ground and net. Two players were pushing buttons to \"hit\" the ball.\n\n1959\n\nMIT developed the first computer with interactive graphics. The TX-2 hall machine has a nine inch CRT and lightpen. The team behind the TX-2 is going to form the Digital Equipment Company.\n\n1960\n\nAfter collaboration with General Motors, IBM produces the first commercially available Computer Aided Design program, known as DAC-1.\n\n1961\n\nAnother MIT student, Steve Russell, created the first video game for a CRT screen, Spacewar. It was written for world's first commercial interactive computer, DEC's PDP-1. Spacewar was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC even included it into bundled software as a test program. Try it.\n\n1962\n\nIvan Sutherland's work on TX-2 culminates with Sketchpad, first interactive (vector) graphics system with various input methods and data structures for replicating components.\n\n1963\n\nSketchpad is commercially available and new version enables display of 3d object in classic orthogonal views together with a scalable perspective view.\n\n1964\n\nDEC developed Type 340 Precision Incremental CRT Display system. Control and data are stored in a word loaded to internal buffer within a couple of microseconds, offloading main computer from display control. The 340 automatized drawing of primitives such as characters and curved lines. Important new feature was subroutine support, making the 340 programmable. Despite the increased complexity, it did not yet occurred to the engineers that they are effectively developing a new kind of processor. But the realization will come with work on better subroutine control in following years.\n\n1965\n\nIBM offers to public 2250 terminal for its computers. The CRT system can be upgraded with buffered display channel and character generator just like DEC hardware, but for it's 1024x1024 monochrome raster calculates position in 4kx4k grid for subpixel precision.\n\n1966\n\nTeam of Ivan Sutherland develope Head Mounted Display, ancestor of virtual reality head mounts. The project will expose complexities of 3d graphics and leads to first important optimization: clipping. Sutherland's team came up with algorithm eliminating parts outside the field of view.\n\n1967\n\nUniversity of Utah played a great role thanks to their computer graphics laboratory, with people like John Warnock (later founded Adobe, author of PostScript), and the image processing group led by Tom Stockham, were was Jim Clark, who later founded Silicon Graphics. Major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers, the hidden-surface algorithms. In order to draw 3D shaded polygons on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are behind others from to the viewer's perspective (along \"z\" axis), and thus shouldn't be drawn. The first popular algorithm was scan line rendering, without need for additional memory as opposed to Z-buffer.\n\nIn UK the University of Cambridge will contribute greatly. CADCentre was created to promote the technology to home industry. Dick Newell oversaw the creation of 3D process plant design. He will later commercialize the research in Cambridge Interactive Systems with Medusa 2D/3D CAD system.\n\n1968\n\nArthur Appel presents the first ray casting rendering algorithm. One ray per pixel is traced from the eye, finds the closest object blocking the path, thus determining visible objects in 3d scene. Materials can have different properties to choose shading of the object. Speed of ray casting is little affected by geometrical complexity.\n\nDr. David Evans and Dr. Ivan Sutherland are together founding own company. Unhappy with commercial products of the time, they set on development special graphics processors, The soon to be famous E&S will be first to build graphics computers, giving birth to the industry.\n\n1969\n\nE&S begins to sell first Line Drawing Systems, capable of matrices multiplies for 3d transformations.\n\nMAGI released SynthaVision, first commercially available solid modeler program. It used ray-tracing algorithm.\n\n1970\n\nSutherland's Sketchpad got its first commercial incarnation: affordable PDS-1. With vector display resolution of 1024x1024, it is going to serve 3d games as well.\n\n1971\n\nWhile flat shading can make an object look as if it's solid, the sharp edges of the polygons can detract from the realism of the image. While one can create smaller polygons (which also means more polygons), this increases the complexity of the scene, which in turn slows down the performance of the computer rendering the scene. To solve this, Henri Gouraud presented a method for creating the appearance of a curved surface by interpolating the color across the polygon. This method of shading has since come to be known as Gouraud shading. It hardly takes any more computations than flat shading, yet provides a dramatic increase in rendering quality. However polygons remain obvious along the edges of the object.\n\n1972\n\nFirst high resolution frame buffer is created for Xerox by Richard Shoup. It fueled the SuperPaint system with 311,040 kB of memory that allowed for 640x480x8 raster graphics. The memory chips were scattered across 16 boards, and data were continually read/written by shift register cascade. But ability to refresh such huge screen within a second was still major breakthrough in animation.\n\n1973\n\nB. T. Phong publishes his dissertation about shading and reflections calculated with per pixel normal. Expanding on Gouraud shading, Phong's method provides much smoother surface at several times higher computing demand. His reflection technique leads to specular highlights- angle dependant intense light seen on shiny surfaces.\n\n1974\n\nEvans & Sutherland released the first commercial framebuffer, 8k 36 bit words big and supporting double buffering. Eight bits were used for grayscale intensity, but soon three of those were combined for 24 bit (true color) framebuffer. The \"Refresh Buffer\" together with own Picture Processor for 3d high precision transformation, clipping, and rastering, propelled powerful Picture System. Demos and Whitney left E&S to join Triple I and form the Motion Picture Products group. They continued own frame buffer development, building one for thousand lines.\n\nEd Catmull received his Ph. D. after thesis covering Texture Mapping, Z-Buffer and curved surfaces rendering. Texture mapping brought computer graphics to a new level of realism. 2D images representing object's surface are applied onto a 3D object. This is still the most important technique of making 3d graphics look realistic. The Z-buffer aided the process of hidden surface removal by using zels which are similar to pixels but instead of recording the luminance of a specific point in an image, they record the depth of that point. The letter \"z\" comes from \"z\" axis, conventionally reflecting the depth. The Z-buffer was then an area of memory devoted to storing the depth data per pixel.\n\n1975\n\nXerox'es computers are first to feature bit block transfer ability. This major performance advancement will be mightly push for fully bit mapped graphics and \"blitter\" hardware accelerators.\n\nMandelbrot followed up his paper with a book entitled \"The Fractal Geometry of Nature.\" This showed how his fractal principles could be applied to computer imagery to create realistic simulations of natural phenomena such as mountains, coastlines, wood grain, etc.\n\n1976\n\nThe first major feature film to use 3D computer generated imagery is screened: Futureworld. Among the CGI content is Edwin Catmull's left hand, digitized in his 1971 experiment.\n\n1977\n\nThe first graphical standard is developed: The 3D Core Graphics System (a.k.a. Core). 25 experts of the ACM developed this \"conceptual framework\" and it became a foundation for many future development in the field of computer graphics.\n\n1978\n\nJames Blinn developed a new technique expanding on texture mapping: bump mapping. One does not have to just map the colors from a 2D image onto a 3D object, the image data can have other uses as well. The brightness of pixels from monochrome image were used to add new details to the surface. As pixels of bump map are more deviating from average gray, they will appear as bigger bumps or dents. When both a texture map and a bump map are applied at the same time, the result can be very convincing. Blinn described another useful technique that year, on surfaces that reflect their surroundings. By rendering six different views from the location of the object (top, bottom, front, back, left and right). Those views are then applied to the outside of the object in a way similar to standard texture mapping. The result is that an object appears to reflect its surroundings, hence the name environment mapping.\n\n1979\n\nTurner Whitted in Bell Labs shakes the CGI world with a much faster ray-tracing algorhitm. Captured in The Compleat Angler, it is one of the most notorious CGI movie ever.\n\n1980\n\nNEC releases their uPD7220, a single chip graphics display processor enabling new level of video performance on highly integrated devices. The clever easy to use instruction set and DMA reducing software overhead made it the standard GPU for years to come.\n\n1981\n\nApollo starts to sell first graphics workstation, that will begin long line of popular products. Using two Motorola 68000 and black and white graphics in relatively small case, workstations drives down the costs far below old big computers like VAX.\n\nDisney turns to MAGI to provide CG for Tron movie. Synthavision will handle the challenges of fluid 3d animation in cinamatic quality.\n\n1982\n\nIntergraph's terminals included a dedicated Graphics Processor for 3D rotations, surface shading, perspective calculations, and polygon processing. With a dedicated processor working in parallel with CPU, it was one of the first terminals able to transform simple 3d objects in real time, dynamic pan, and continuous zoom in or out.\n\nSUN corporation is founded to build own graphics workstations. Sun-1 used a sophisticated CAD software powered by graphics controller with memory-mapped frame buffer for bit-mapped graphics at resolution of 1024x1024 pixels and accelerated raster operations.\n\nJim Clark and Marc Hannah developed the Geometry Engine. It is a 5 MFLOP VLSI chip performing beside others 4x4 matrix transformations, window clipping, perspective and orthographic projections.\n\nBleeding edge 3d graphics of 80's was reserved for flight simulators, such as CT-5 with a graphics system by Evans & Sutherland. First general purpose CT machine leaps over abilities of the previous image generators. It splits the picture into tiles processed separately, removing parts hidden by closer objects. Multiple surfaces can be color blended for transparency effects, and 3d texture mapping was soon added as well.\n\n1983\n\nAnother new corporation, Silicon Graphics Inc., rolled out its first system, the IRIS 1000 graphics terminal. The company focused its resources on creating the highest performance graphics computers available. Iris line offered built-in 3D graphics capabilities, being first to implement Geometry System of Jim Clark.\n\nComputervision also boosts it's CAD performance, their CGP200 enables raster graphics accelerated by dedicated co-processor board known as the Graphics Processing Unit.\n\n1984\n\nIBM expands possibilities of PC by PGC adapter, carrying own CPU, 68kB of ROM, 4 bit DAC and 320kB of RAM. The massive triple PCB card supported hardware rotation and clipping, but did not find much support besides Autocad.\n\nPixar shows a version of their first film: The Adventures of Andre & Wally B. Groundbreaking technology allows for complex flexible characters, hand-painted textures, and motion blur.\n\n1985\n\nSGI offers a second line of IRIS workstations, pushing 80,000 transistors Geometry Engines to 8 MHz for peak 44 megapixels fillrate. Apollo has a new graphics system as well, with 25 megapixel triangle fillrate. Hardware acceleration can now perform real time rendering resolutions above one megapixel, but is still limited to transformations and rasterization of flat shaded polygons. Lighting, smooth shading and depth buffering done in software carry large penalty.\n\nAutoCAD, the first program of the kind for microcomputers, now supports 3d visualization.\n\n1986\n\nDedicated 3d coprocessors are spreading. Texas Instruments TMS34010 is first truly programmable graphics chip, albeit still without floating point operations.\n\nIBM tries a CAD comeback with \"RT PC\", RISC machine with optional Floating Point Accelerator. High resolution video card for first time employed dual ported VRAM memory. But even then 3d graphics performance is behind competition.\n\nSilicon Graphics takes on hardware implementation of smooth shading and depth buffering with 4DG, though the speed is not yet practical.\n\nIntel came out with the 82786 coprocessor, integrating unit supporting rich set of drawing operations, display processor that performs video generation and windowing operations, memory controller and bus logic. The architecture is also flexible, because the graphics memory is directly accessible by the CPU.\n\n1987\n\nIBM RT line offers new models with built-in Motorola 68881 FPU (192 kFlops). It's hardware implementation of transcendental functions exceeds the graphics speed of the original Floating Point Accelerator. But what's more, IBM offered own Advanced FPA card with even higher performance.\n\nPixar completes Red's dream, a cinematic breakthrough in atmospheric effects and complex lighting models.\n\n1988\n\nLoren Carpenter introduced the alpha channel to the frame buffer, allowing images to be efficiently composited and blended, even with antialiasing.\n\nEvans & Sutherland provides powerful 3d accelerator for VAXstation 8000. Project Shadowfax introduces hardware anti-aliased rendering in 16 chips, effectively multiplying resolution.\n\nIBM developed new RT Systems with Enhanced AFPA. Peak double precision speed reaches 2 MFlops, still only matching more established competition. Apollo and SGI are bringing true second generation accelerators, quickly processing lighting from multiple sources, smooth shading, depth buffering with rejection of hidden surfaces. Also memory capacity increased to allow high resolution double buffering.\n\nRobert L. Cook and Loren Carpenter after several years finished Reyes- Pixar's software suite that in anticipation of further rapid development can be called an API. It sets many standards for describing 3D scenes featuring bump, environmental and displacement maps, shadows, refraction and antialiasing techniques. The term shader is used for creating procedural textures and complex color programs.\n\n1989\n\nSilicon Graphics, assisted by Autodesk and VPL, shows new technology coined as Virtual Reality. Computers have become strong enough to generate a 3D environment that allows real time interaction with users.\n\nSGI, HP and Apollo lead graphics workstations to hardware texture mapping and line antialiasing. Next year HP will buy Apollo and their graphics products will be fused into one line.\n\nIntel releases the i860 CPU with unique features, especially high-speed floating point operations. It's 64-bit FPU contains adders, multipliers and integer \"graphics processor\". Instructions could act on data sizes up to 128-bit at rate 1 FMAD per clock.\n\nIBM is coming back to mainframe rendering with a monster, launching new \"6090\" 1280x1024 display system. Ten floating-point graphics processors could transform one million vectors per second, or display true color shaded images at 40 million pixels per second. Shading was produced by an optional processor that supported multiple light sources and depth-cueing. The 6090 was one of the first commercial devices that could rotate shaded images in real time. IBM also introduced new channel control units that could handle up to 192 displays.\n\n1990\n\nAutoDesk shipped their first 3d animation product, 3D Studio. Its Heidi API will allow for hardware acceleration.\n\nEvans & Sutherland abandons supercomputer plans and instead starts own workstations. 3D accelerator of ESV line is feature wise similar to Shadowfax, but faster and lot more integrated with only four pixel processors fed by many-DSP geometry processor. On a true color 1280x1024 double-buffered display with 24 bit Z-buffer the ESV can render up to 100,000 Gauroud shaded polygons.\n\nAfter years of research US Military starts to use SIMNET for tank combat visualization. Binary Space Partitioning was the technique of choice for military simulations, but falling memory prices allowed SIMNET to use Z-buffered 3d graphics to enable on-ground point of view and large numbers of moving vehicles.\n\n1991\n\nFirst 3d accelerator card for IBM Personal Computers is ready: IrisVision. Originating from Personal Iris, the card featured SGI's fifth generation Geometry Engine capable of 24 bit color rendering and optionally also 24 bit Z-buffering.\n\nSame year SGI finishes ELAN 3d accelerator. New workstations now offer performance of 180K Z-buffered, lit, Gouraud-shaded triangles per second, and possibly even 1280x1024 true color mode. ELAN was comprised of five daughterboards for different subsystems: the Command Engine, Geometry Subsystem, Raster Engine, framebuffer and Display Subsystem.\n\nIBM's graphics workstations made a massive performance jump with RS/6000 line, now offering GT4 family of 3D accelerators based on TI's TMS320C30 DSPs. The most powerful option made of GT4x and two ramdac boards offers double buffered 1280x1024 speed of 80,000 Gouraud shaded polygons in 24 bit color and depth precision. Floating point performance was the main advantage of new Power(PC) line of CPUs. Stand-alone Power Visualization System achieved 2,5 GFLOPS rate.\n\n1992\n\nEvans and Sutherland starts Freedom line of SPARCstation compatible workstation accelerators. They support mip-mapped texturing and pixel fillrate is nearing 100 million/s.\n\nSGI finalizes OpenGL- first open standard 3d API, an evolution of proprietary IRIS GL API. As 3d hardware expands, need for a unified way of programming is increasing. The first members of Architecture Review Board are Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft and of course SGI.\n\n1993\n\nSun offers own 3d accelerator for SPARCstation ZX. It uses 11 ASICs of three types: pipeline control featuring triangle setup, four 150 MFlops chips for coordinates transformation and lighting, and five rendering chips rejecting hidden pixels. The design had in mind newly appearing bottleneck of 3d graphics: memory bandwidth.\n\nThird generation of 3d acceleration was mostly defined by RealityEngine of Silicon Graphics. The first Onyx visualization system is full of components for hardware accelerated graphics pipeline. The feature set includes perspectively correct trilineary mip-mapped texturing, antialising, sub pixel precision, 32 bit Z-buffer and up to 48 bit color precision. Even if SGI's future looks bright number of engineers are leaving and starting own companies targeting consumer markets.\n\n1994\n\nIndustrial Light & Magic brought dinosaurs to life for the movie Jurassic Park, animating herds of dinosaurs upon live-action backgrounds using SGI's Crimson hardware.\n\nEvans & Sutherland try expansion into cheap workstation market with Freedom Series. Single slot PCI card that should have support OpenGL even on lowly Windows 95.\n\n1995\n\nPixar released the first fully 3D animated movie, Toy Story with big critical acclaim. SunSPARC workstations were used to perform 0.5 million arithmetic operations per average pixel.\n\n3Dlabs finishes their complete 3d pipeline implementation in a single chip. The 300SX based cards will dramatically decrease cost of 3d workstations.\n\nJames Clark proving his Geometry Engine by this five-bit slice.\n\nnotable sources: http://classicgames.about.com/od/classicvideogames101/ http://web.textfiles.com/games/nesgfx.txt http://www.system16.com/ http://inventors.about.com/ http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/ http://www.wikipedia.org/ http://www.cadhistory.net/ http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/ http://www.digibarn.com https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/ First-Hand:The Development of Pong: Early Days of Atari and the Video Game Industry Theaters of War: The Military Entertainment Complex Funding a Revolution: Government Support for Computing Research RS/6000 Graphics Handbook On the Design of Display Processors (Myer-Sutherland) RealityEngine Graphics (Kurt Akeley) Many great members of vogons.org"
