        "text": "Leveling Up Technology\n\nLike many others, I remember waking up to the hyped-up Nintendo-64 gaming console with its stocked Mario on Christmas morning in 1996. At first glance, the only difference was a cleaner, slicker console, smaller gaming cartridges, and the added joystick. But when we plugged it in and powered it on, we genuinely understood the joystick’s advancements and point! The joystick allowed us to navigate 360 degrees, adding a third dimension to gaming.\n\nMy interest soon shifted from gaming to writing software, but the worldwide demand for improved graphics by gamers paved the way for today’s vast technology. In the summer of 2010, while doing a Research Experience for Undergrads at Northeastern University, I first heard of using graphics cards for general-purpose engineering tasks. We used Jacket, a third-party wrapper for CUDA in MATLAB, to speed up a computer simulation of light propagating through lung tissue. In 2012, while on co-op at Analogic Corporation as an Electrical Computer Engineer, I got to work with their leading software engineers to implement image reconstruction algorithms onto the GPU. This allowed CT scanners to be used as bag scanners in airports, a feat that was previously…"
