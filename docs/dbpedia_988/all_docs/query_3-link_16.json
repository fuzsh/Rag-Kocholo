        "text": "Video Game Graphics – it’s an art form which has evolved so quickly throughout so little time, and has come from the humblest roots to reach the highest point of technological advancement. Fast-paced and constantly changing, with competition for the most advanced visuals always a battle taking place between game studios, visuals in games are still very much a developing art form, and continue to make drastic advancements and leaps in technology which no one could have dreamed of in this art form’s early days.\n\nWhat I find so intriguing about video game graphics is how they evolve so rapidly, and how the rules and pipelines for the production of these visuals is always subject to change. Belonging to an industry such as this one means you always have to be on your feet, researching and taking in everything you can to get ahead.\n\nTHE DAWN OF THE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY\n\nIn the early days of graphics, moving a pixel across the screen was an astounding feat. In the 1970’s, there were two varying types of ways to render graphics – Raster, which renders line by line on the screen to form the picture – and Vector, directly manipulates the electron beam to create their images. The two forms of rendering were used in many early arcade games – while vector images were smoother, their lack of versatility allowed the use of pixels to dominate the game industry.\n\n1970’s\n\nThe very first major success of the video game industry was PONG, a revolutionary game which basically paved the path for the future video game industry. Released in 1972, the game’s simple concept proved wildly popular, and although it had only a few white pixels moving around the screen, in comparison to the lack of visuals games at that time possessed, it was an amazing thing to witness.\n\nBut as will all advancements in technology, the the novelty of the visuals of PONG and following monochromatic games like Gun Fight (1975) wore off – graphics needed to improve if the industry was to survive. The first thing developers did to enhance the aesthetic appeal was to use colour overlays on the arcade displays – translucent sheets which were overlayed on the screen to present the illusion of a coloured background.\n\nBut the use of RGB colour in games was what really pushed the industry forward – the first most successful game to include these graphics was Galaxian (1979), an arcade game which was very similar to Space Invaders. With the multicoloured alien sprites, the visuals of this game were wildly impressive at the time.\n\n1980’s\n\nBy 1980, colour graphics were standard for arcade games.\n\nSmooth scrolling was something which early games lacked – they had fixed playing fields which were sized to fit the arcade screen. But in the 1980’s, a host of games aimed to push this restriction, and while they sacrificed visuals, the playing field was able to move and change smoothly. Defender, released in 1980, was a side scrolling game which utilized new side-scrolling technology, and effectively paved the way for the future side-scrolling genre of games.\n\nSega’s Zaxxon in 1982 was the first game to employ an isometric view with smooth scrolling.The most important thing to consider here is how this game effectively simulates a 3D view, which shows how games were slowly moving towards the use of 3D graphics. The isometric view would be seen in many other games in the future.\n\nFrom here on, game visuals started to improve drastrically. With the lack of depth 2D games offered, developers started to attempt to add visual effects which simulated depth in their games, such as the sprite re-scaling used in Nintendo’s Radar Scope.\n\nWhen the creation of 16-bit hardware for arcade machines was created, game visuals had an opportunity to advance even more. SEGA’s 1985 release of Hang On provided audiences with smooth sprite scaling and fast frame rates, and had a huge impact on the arcades. A new era was truly beginning.\n\nThe Supreme Rule of Sprites\n\nSprites are two-dimensional images which represent a non-static aspect of the game, such as the player character or enemies.The importance of sprites became evident in the 1980’s. Where before art had not much of a place within video games because of hardware and technological limitations, the advancement of sprites started to welcome in more use of artistic expression within the industry. While early sprites were blocky and limited in palette, the later sprites were smoother, larger and much more diverse in their colour palette. Capcom’s Strider (1989) used an impressive display of sprites, with the cps1 arcade board with dedicated sprite chips.\n\n1990’s\n\nThis arcade board would go on to power Street Fighter 2 (1991). With it’s diverse character sprites and fluid movement, it brought a surge of interest back into the arcades as fighting games became popular.\n\nHand drawn sprites required good artists – but one interesting alternative in games was rotoscoping animation. Prince of Persia utilized rotoscoping – meaning they used real footage of a person, and traced the sprite directly from the video footage. This made the movement much more believable in smooth, but wasn’t commonplace in many video games.\n\nDigitized sprites also became a very popular artistic addition to games. These sprites utilized pictures of real people to add a sense of realism to the game. The game which used this technique well, and gained a lot of popularity, was Mortal Kombat (1992).\n\nAnother important advancement in game graphics was the inclusion of Parallax scrolling. This was the act of splitting the foreground or background into different layers, and allowing them to move at different paces to simulate the illusion of movement and depth in a scene. Parallax scrolling soon became commonplace in 2D side scrollers, an with the new 16 bit machines, it was an much more of an attainable feat.\n\nWhat games were really missing in the era before the 1990’s was true character and artistic appeal. With the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991, it was clear that games were heading in a more exciting direction. Sonic the Hedgehog brought new colour and life to the arcades, as well as home consoles, and the popularity of this game encouraged a surge of new life into cartoon mascots in the platforming genre.\n\nEarthworm Jim (Shiny Entertainment, 1993) is a great example of how this era introduced personality and humour into video games. With Jim’s unique style and humorous, stylized animations the game was a hit.\n\nSuper Mario World 2 (1994) was an interesting addition to the market – while it was not technically impressive, it’s hand-drawn art style had such a distinct charm and uniqueness to it. Seeing a game utilize aesthetic and artistic appreciation over the push for advancement in technology was interesting, and begins to outline a new priority for video games – to be innovative and artistically expressive, rather than just graphically impressive.\n\nBy the mid 1990’s, sprites were no longer so impressive. The focus was shifting – the industry was interested in what the third dimension could bring to video games.\n\nTHE REIGN OF POLYGON’S\n\nEarly 3D games faced a lot of difficulty – with strict hardware restrictions, they were left simply with a vector wireframe representation of the 3D world.\n\nAtari’s 1980 Battlezone.\n\nWith the decline in interest around arcade games, and the demand for 3D graphics, the game industry was going through a tough time. Many games used flat-shaded polygons to break away from the wireframe representation of 3D, and this proved to work well in a few games.\n\nDevelopers were desperate to get the depth that 3D offers into their games – so some tricks were used to feign 3D detail. Super Mario Kart (1992) on the NES utilizes a illusory 3D feel, while not actually possessing three dimensions.\n\nGames which did utilize polygons mostly used pre-rendered backgrounds painted as bitmaps, and only used 3D elements for the player or enemies. This helped preserve polygon use and ease the strain on the hardware.This technique was used in Alone in the Dark by InfoGrames, in 1992.\n\nMoving on into the 3D realm, raycasting was a technique employed mainly in first person shooters. It renders scenes based on what the player can see – Wolfenstein 3D utilized this technique, and with the use of simple level geometry, the game’s walls can be fully textures and yet still remain playable. Doom (1993) was the father of first person shooters, and had the biggest impact on the genre. It built on the Wolfenstein engine and enhanced it’s graphical prowess to allow more more organic level design. As a whole, the game was made more atmospheric and believable – something which couldn’t be found much in games of that time.\n\nTrue 3D was something that required a lot of processing power, and as such didn’t come into play until the mid 1990’s. The arcade games led the way for this advancement, seen in games like Ridge Racer, which were praised for their graphics at the time.\n\nHome consoles began showcasing impressive use of 3D graphics – the Super Maro 64 for the Nintendo 64 was by far one of the most revolutionary 3D platforming games, and is still remembered today for its impact on the industry. The game was genuinely fun to play, as well as colourful with full player mobility.\n\nThe PS1 also introduced ints own 3D platformer, Crash Bandicoot. With a fun, expressive personality, Crash Bandicoot had a unique art style and despite its low polygon count, was both technically and artistically impressive.\n\n3D Games were illusions no more. They were now a key part of the mainstream gaming industry. Games like Quake and Unreal pushed the bar even higher for 3D gaming, and dawned a new era of technological advancement in the 3D realm.\n\nThe old 2D tricks of the late era were old news. 3D graphics were now being assisted by graphical co-processors. Once these 3D cards reached the PC market, they became an essential part of gaming – and ever since the PC has experienced unprecedented dominance in the realm of video game graphics. Unreal Tournament was a huge milestone for 3D gaming in the first-person genre. With coloured lighting, real level geometry and fast frame rates, Unreal and its engine would go on to power many other games, and its graphical power would evolve drastically.\n\n2000’s\n\nEvery releases of a new FPS title brought with it new expectations of graphical power and visual appeal. Half-Life 2 (Valve, 2004) stands out in this respect, as it combined impressive graphics and a bleak art style with good gameplay.\n\nWith the explosive popularity of 3D accelerator cards, the FPS genre was shining.\n\nBut something happened with the importance of art style here – in the desperate battle for graphical dominance, many FPS games deserted artistic expression and instead focused on making the visuals as realistic as possible. This caused many FPS games to have a gritty grey brown aesthetic, which caused a lot of them to look technically impressive, but aesthetically dull.\n\nDesaturating colours became a very common issue in the video game industry, and it still can be seen today. The aversion to including bright colours in games was seen across all genres, from RPG’s to FPS.\n\nOverused bloom in video games of the early 2000’s was another prominent issue. The overuse of cinematic effects can be seen in many games of the era, and can be attributed once more to the race for more realistic graphics – but it simply blinded everyone in the process, and washed out a lot of the game’s scenery.\n\nExample below from Syndicate.\n\nAn interesting artistic trend in video games was the introduction of more stylized art, such as cell-shading. Instead of adhering to the gritty photo-realism many games are attempting to replicate, cell shading utilizes flat shading and black lines to make things look more cartoon like. This unique aesthetic was used in quite a few popular games, and outlines a new focus in the industry on artistic expression and the use of a cohesive style.\n\nGames such as Wind Waker and Borderlands employed this style.\n\nWhere Now?\n\nThis brings us to an interesting question – are graphics really that important? This question has been asked many times, and no one truly knows the answer. Many triple A game studios push for photo-realism and impressive graphics over gameplay – and some studios are introducing a more artistic style to their games, valuing gameplay and style over photorealistic graphics. Some players want graphics, while others want gameplay. Some want interesting, stylized visuals over technologically advanced graphics.\n\nThe importance of art in video games has changed throughout the industry’s history. We are seeing many games departing from their original stylized art forms to adopt more realistic visuals – but we are also seeing game studios which continue to produce innovative gaming experiences with interesting, unique visuals. And now with indie games thrown into the mix, the game industry contains more diversity in artistic expression then ever before.\n\nVideo Games are a fascinating medium, and are constantly evolving. Being an artist in the industry is like being part of an ever-changing movement – the standards of graphics are always subject to change, and the hardware limitations are becoming less restrictive.The production pipeline is constantly evolving – we have gone from modelling low polygon characters with restricted textures to sculpting and retopologizing high detail models with a polygon count no one would have ever thought was possible. The use of 2 and 4K resolution textures is now commonplace. This means as artists we have so much more freedom, but a lot more expectations.\n\n3D software has evolved with the game industry, and now PBR texturing programs and high detail sculpting programs can be used by anyone! And it’s fascinating to see how Unreal Engine began with Unreal Tournament, and to now be working with Unreal Engine 4 and its amazing graphical capabilities is mind blowing.\n\nLooking back on your industry’s history is important as an artist. It helps put so much in perspective, and see how lucky we truly are to be able to express our art freely and easily with new software and tools.\n\nThe possibilities are endless for games as of now – it will be interesting to see how the graphics evolve even further in the future – and what this will mean for artists."
