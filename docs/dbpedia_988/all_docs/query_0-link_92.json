The students will have 2 quizzes on the terms. Basically the terms are split in half for the quizzes. Each quiz will only be given after the terms are introduced in the discussions.\n\n@thomasb It is important for students to be able to put a term and definition to what they are doing. I have some of the basic programming concepts in vinyl on my classroom walls. It makes for good discussion, connections and decoration."
