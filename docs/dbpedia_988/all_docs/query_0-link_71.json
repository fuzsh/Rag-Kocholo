What is Graphics? 2 Graphics means:  Clear lifelike or vividly realistic description.  vividly or plainly shown or described E.g. autographs are images or designs on some surface, such as a visual wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone\n\n3. Purpose of Graphics 3 Their purpose is  to inform,  to illustrate, &  to entertain. It includes pictorial representation of data. Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics\n\n4. What are Computer Graphics? 4 Computer graphics are pictures and movies created using computers, usually referring to image data created by a computer specifically with help from specialized graphical hardware and software. Another name for this field is Computer Generated Imagery , simply said as CGI\n\n5. Computer Graphics? 5 The term computer graphics describes \"almost everything on computers that is not text or sound\". It refers to several different things:  the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer  the various technologies used to create and manipulate images.\n\n6. Applications of computer graphics 6 Computer graphics is widespread today. Computer imagery is found on  Television  Newspapers ,  Weather Reports &  all kinds of Medical Investigation and Surgical Procedures.\n\n7. Types of Computer Graphics 7 Two-dimensional  2D computer graphics are the computer-based generation of digital images—mostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them. Pixel art  A large form of digital art being pixel art is created through the use of raster graphics software, where images are edited on the pixel level.\n\n8. Types of Computer Graphics 8 Sprite graphics:  A sprite is a two-dimensional image or animation that is integrated into a larger scene.\n\n9. 9 Vector graphics:  Vector graphics is the creation of digital images through a sequence of commands or mathematical statements that place lines and shapes in a given two-dimensional or three- dimensional space.\n\n10. Types of Computer Graphics 10 Three-dimensional 3D graphics compared to 2D graphics are graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data.  For the purpose of performance this is stored in the computer.  This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing. Computer animation Computer animation is the art of creating moving images via the use of computers. It is a sub-field of computer graphics and animation.\n\n13. What are Graphics Software? 13 Graphics software or images editing software is a program or collection of programs that enable a person to manipulate visual images on a computer.\n\n14. List of Graphics Software 14  Aladdin 4D  Animation: Master  Blender (Blender Foundation)  BRL-CAD  Cobalt  DX Studio  Free CAD  Mesh Lab  Open FX  Photoshop (Adobe Systems)"
