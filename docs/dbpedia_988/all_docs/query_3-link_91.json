There are fewer hiding places for the weaknesses and edge cases in our rendering features, as care has to be taken to ensure features work in all scenarios. This talk discusses some of the challenges faced on Far Cry 5 developing a water system, a physically-based time of day cycle and closes by looking at some small techniques to improve the lives of artists.\n\nBio: Stephen McAuley is a 3D Technical Lead at Ubisoft Montreal on the Far Cry Central Tech team, where he holds the vision for the future of the 3D engine. During his time at Ubisoft, he has worked on many Far Cry games, spearheading the switch to physically-based lighting and shading, working towards a more data-driven rendering architecture, and focusing on visual quality.

The authors extended the Diffuse BRDF to model Lambertian microfacets with multi-scattering. They derived a simple method to mipmap normal and gloss maps, by directly correlating gloss to average normal length of a distribution, bypassing an intermediate representation, like variance. Then cavity maps are auto-generated for every surface that has a normal map, and the presentation will also show how the authors handled occlusion and indirect lighting in cavities represented by these textures. The presenters will demonstrate how the environment split integral precalculation can be easily reused for energy conserving diffuse. Finally, they will show how Rational Functions can be a useful tool to approximate many functions that can't be represented analytically or efficiently.\n\nBio: Danny Chan is Principal Software Engineer at Sledgehammer Games, leading the rendering effort on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and Call of Duty: WWII.

The challenge of real-time depth of field is to output the highest bokeh quality while remaining fast. This talk will journey through the step by step implementation of a depth of field algorithm starting from existing state-of-the-art, and fixing artifacts one after the other to converge to the final implementation released in Unreal Engine 4.20. In order to achieve its opposing goals including scalability across a large variety of hardware, high quality and performance, the self-contained algorithm blends between:\n\n-The fast performance of scatter-as-gather approach while efficiently solving a physically plausible geometric occlusion with large variety of blurring radii for background, and hole filling for the foreground;\n\n-The quality of scattered sprites for highlights and deals with all the complexity implication of combining them plausibly;\n\n-The details of sub-pixel accuracy of slight out of focus convolution with the challenges of running with a Temporal Anti-Aliasing from older but sadly never published algorithm used in Unreal Engine 4.\n\nBio: Guillaume Abadie is Graphic Programmer at Epic Games, working directly on Unreal Engine 4's renderer, more specifically on post processing.

Each of the approaches (forward-, forward-plus, or deferred) has a number of strengths and deficiencies, widely covered in previous conference presentations from shipping games engines. The features offered by each rendering architecture varies widely, and often can be content-centric.\n\nWhen designing the high-definition rendering pipeline (HDRP) for the Unity engine, the authors desired to leverage the strengths of each rendering approach, as necessary for various application contexts (a console game, VR application, etc.). Thus, an important design constraint for the architecture of HDRP became a unified feature set between the deferred and forward rendering paths.\n\nThis presentation will explain how the team tackled designing the lighting, material and rendering architecture for the HDRP with the feature parity design constraint as one of the main pillars. It will cover the details of the flexible G-buffer layout architecture, explain the logic behind the taken design choices, and necessary optimizations for efficient execution on modern console hardware. In addition, the authors will present advanced developments made in the field of physically-based rendering, material advances, focusing on the novel BRDF model used for the rendering pipeline. The talk will also provide a framework for correctly mixing normals with complex material for evaluation at runtime. Lastly, the architecture and technical details of the physically-based volumetric lighting approach will be described, along with the necessary optimizations for fast performance.\n\nBios: Sébastien Lagarde is a lead graphics programmer at Unity Technologies where he's driving the architecture of Unity's high definition rendering pipeline, amongst other projects. Prior to Unity, he has worked on many game consoles for variety of titles, from small casual games to AAA (Remember Me, Mirror's Edge 2, StarWars Battlefront, among some).Sébastien has previously worked for Neko Entertainment, Darkworks, Trioviz, Dontnod and Electronic Arts / Frostbite.\n\nEvgenii Golubev, Graphics Programmer in the Unitys Paris Graphics team, where he is contributing to Unitys high definition rendering pipeline architecture, focusing on physically-based materials and advanced light transport, making them run efficiently on modern hardware. Previously worked on the rendering technology at Havok and Microsoft.\n\nMaterials (Updated: August 25th 2018): PDF (14 MB), Book of the Dead HD RP Video, Automotive HD RP Video, Volumetrics in HD RP Video (Slide 134), HD RP Participating Media Authoring Video (Slide 137), Spotlight with highly forward-scattering fog GIF (Slide 140)\n\nEfficient Screen-Space Subsurface Scattering Using Burleys Normalized Diffusion in Real-Time\n\nAbstract: Screen-space subsurface scattering by Jimenez et al and the multitude of parameterization options developed for it, such as Gaussian lobe, two Gaussian lobe, SVD, etc.,have produced impressive results in rendering organic materials and characters. However, these methods focused primarily on the multi-scattering contribution rather than the single scattering contribution (aside from simple approximations via an extra weight for the original diffuse texture.) These previously introduced techniques rely on a separable Gaussian filter to achieve fast performance on modern GPUs.\n\nIn this talk, the authors build on the recently introduced Burley normalized diffusion method, bringing this technique developed for offline rendering pipelines into real-time with a novel screen-space subsurface scattering method. This method accounts for both multi and single scattering appearance models. Its parameterization model is simple and is derived based on the values from real world measurements. The authors will compare the quality of this approach to the more commonly used screen-space subsurface scattering techniques and explain the necessary optimizations required to evaluate its non-separable kernel efficiently in real-time. This method is used in production and is highly performant on commodity console hardware, such as Playstation 4 and Xbox One at 1080p resolution.\n\nBio: Evgenii Golubev, Graphics Programmer in the Unitys Paris Graphics team, where he is contributing to Unitys high definition rendering pipeline architecture, focusing on physically-based materials and advanced light transport, making them run efficiently on modern hardware.

The ability to trace rays offers the promise of finally being able to accurately simulate global light scattering in real time graphics. Just as physically-based materials have revolutionized real-time graphics in recent years, physically-based global lighting offers the chance to have a similar impact on both image quality and developer and artist productivity.\n\nGetting there won't be easy, however: currently, only a handful of rays can be traced at each pixel, which requires great care and creativity from the graphics programmer. There are lessons to be learned from offline rendering, which broadly adopted ray tracing ten years ago. The author will discuss the experience of the offline pipelines with the technology and highlight a variety of key innovations that have been developed in that realm that are worth knowing about for developers adopting real-time ray tracing.\n\nBio: Matt Pharr is a Distinguished Research Scientist at NVIDIA where he works on ray-tracing and real-time rendering. He is the author of the book Physically Based Rendering for which he and the co-authors were awarded a Scientific and Technical Academy Award in 2014 for the book's impact on the film industry.\n\nMaterials (Updated: August 24th 2018): PDF (74 MB)\n\nReal-Time Ray Tracing of Correct* Soft Shadows\n\n(* without a shadow of a doubt)\n\nAbstract: With recent advances in real-time shading techniques, we can now light physically based materials with complex area light sources. Alas, one critical challenge remains: accurate area-light shadowing. The arrival of DXR opens the door to solving this problem via ray tracing, but the correct formulation isn't obvious and there are several potential pitfalls. For instance, the most popular strategy consists of tracing rays to points randomly distributed on the light source and averaging the visibility, but we will show that this is incorrect and produces visual artifacts. Instead, we propose a definition for soft shadows that allows us to compute the correct result, along with an efficient implementation that works with existing analytic area lighting solutions.\n\nNote: this talk is an extended presentation of the paper Combining Analytic Direct Illumination and Stochastic Shadows (presented at I3D) that includes additional practical details.\n\nSpeakers: Stephen Hill (Lucasfilm) and Morgan McGuire (NVIDIA)\n\nNon-speaking contributor: Eric Heitz (Unity Technologies)\n\nBios: Stephen Hill is a Senior Rendering Engineer within Lucasfilms Advanced Development group, where he is engaged in physically based rendering R&D for real-time productions such as the Carne y Arena VR installation experience.\n\nMorgan McGuire is a scientist at NVIDIA, holds faculty appointments at the University of Waterloo, Williams College, and McGill University, and has co-authored several books, including The Graphics Codex and Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice.\n\nEric Heitz is a Research Scientist at Unity Technologies. His research focuses on physically based rendering including materials, lighting, sampling, LoDs, anti-aliasing, etc.\n\nMaterials (Updated: August 27th 2018): PDF (78MB), Video"
