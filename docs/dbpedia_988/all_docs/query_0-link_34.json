        "text": "Abstract\n\nComputer games are a rich subject for computer science instruction. Unlike many traditional topics in computer science, gaming is inherently interdisciplinary. Developing games requires integration of concepts from computer graphics, artificial intelligence, operating systems, physical simulation, and, for multi-player games, networking and distributed systems. Consequently, a course in computer games offers an opportunity to survey a broad number of subjects in Computer Science while still maintaining a coherent focus on a single subject. In addition to this unique perspective on Computer Science, computer game development is also a topic of great interest to students. In the following I describe a curriculum for a course which surveys Computer Science through the perspective of computer games. This course has been successfully used for two different courses at different institutions. Over the course of this curriculum, students construct a fully functional game. As topics in computer science are covered, functionality related to those topics is implemented in the game. This incremental development provides students with an integrated view of what are traditionally disparate topics in Computer Science.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nArroyo, I., Wallace, R., Beal, C.
