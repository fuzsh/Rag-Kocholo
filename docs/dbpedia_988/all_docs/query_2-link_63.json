Rarely prominently featured outside of niche titles after the invention of the polygon, because most people seem to like having their eyes desecrated by boxy characters and slipshod environments.\n\nAn image that can be move independently on a screen without affecting the background.\n\nSprites are graphics (pictures) that can be moved around the screen. They are frequently used in games (spaceships, bullets and characters are all usually sprites) because they can be moved around quickly and easily and can be any shape or size. TNT Basic has in-built support for sprites and allows you to do special effects with them too. Sprite Commands Sprites Tutorial\n\nAn animated image, a sprite is defined once and is then animated by commands that change its position or appearance.\n\nAnimated images that form objects or characters in 2D games. These were used in most video games until the PlayStation popularized 3-D, polygon graphics.\n\nA small graphic drawn independently of the rest of the screen.\n\nA small graphic that can be moved independently around the screen, producing animated effects.\n\nA graphics object that moves freely between screens.\n\nA bitmap of an arbitrary shape that can be moved across complex backgrounds without flicker or damage to the background image.\n\nA small graphic image on the computer screen that can be moved around independently with a mouse or with keyboard commands. Examples are the ordinary cursor in its many forms, and the characters in video games. More Info\n\nA programmable, movable, high-resolution graphic image. Also called a Movable Object Block (MOB).\n\nA small-animated image in GIF format.\n\nSeveral 2D graphics images of one object or character for each of it's possible positions and states. The game engine displays the correct image based on the object's or characterâ€™s position.\n\n1) A cast member that has been placed in the Score, and consequently can be seen on the Stage. 2) Any graphically manipulable or programmable object that has been placed in the Score.\n\nA two dimensional image, often with transparent areas, that is drawn to the screen to represent some in-game object.\n\nIn dynamics, a render type that displays a texture image or image sequence at each particle. At any given particle, the texture image or image sequence displayed can be identical to or different from those at other particles. Depending on the type of texture image used, sprites can be used to create effects such as smoke, clouds, fog, or stars. A sprite appears as a small rectangle until a texture image is mapped to it. The image faces the camera directly regardless of the camera's position or orientation."
