        "text": "The first interactive electronic game with an electronic display was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith back in 1947, albeit it was never manufactured. Vector-drawn dots were employed in the cathode-ray tube amusement gadget, which was based on radar display technology.\n\nThe first manufactured video game was developed by scientist William Higinbotham in 1958, just over ten years later. Since the 2D, basic graphics of the Pong tennis game, video game graphics have advanced significantly.\n\nEarly graphics from arcade games\n\nYou probably take it for granted now that you can play tens of thousands of different games online, ranging from shooters and puzzle games to platform games and role-playing games. It, however, would have been pure science fiction in the 1970s.\n\nVideo games from the 1970s and 1980s lacked processing capability, therefore they used simple graphics that fooled players into thinking they were 3D, like the 1983 Star Wars arcade game. The game had lines of various colors, but the images lacked texture. The game’s 3D may not resemble 3D games from today, but in the early 1980s, games like Star Wars incorporated cutting-edge technology. Simple sprites were utilized at the time to represent characters in games like the well-known Space Invaders. Once video games become available to be played on home consoles, the graphics technology employed in Space Invaders will soon become the standard type of visuals used in video games.\n\nGraphics from first console games\n\nThe visuals of early home game consoles, such as the 1977-released Atari 2600, were inferior to those found in arcade games. Pac-Man, for instance, looked wonderful in the arcade with its vibrant colors and beautiful graphics. Nevertheless, the home version, which had choppy animation and a limited color palette, was far more constrained and less aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe Next Step in Home Console Development\n\nThe Nintendo Entertainment System was introduced in 1983. The games on the platform made significant advancements in their 8-bit visuals. The game’s creators explored alternative ways to improve the aesthetics while still adhering to the programming constraints. Four different sprites were flawlessly combined to generate some sprites, such as Mario. That was ground-breaking technology in its day.\n\nThe era of 16-bit\n\nThe visuals of video games made yet another significant advancement in the 1990s. Sprites were more detailed than ever before during the 16-bit period, which also included larger color palettes. The availability of 16-bit platforms like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and titles like Super Mario Bros. demonstrated the rapid advancement in video game visuals. You can notice how different 16-bit games like Final Fantasy II and Chron Trigger look and play when you compare them to prior generation games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior.\n\nOther technologies were being used in video games at the same time. For instance, a method known as Mode 7 completely changed Nintendo’s racing games by allowing game developers to manipulate 2D objects to generate 3D visuals. Moreover, Nintendo discovered that it could incorporate a chip into the game cartridge to support more powerful graphics processing. The chip made it feasible to create games like Super Mario RPG.\n\nThe era of 32-bit\n\nSoon after, 32-bit graphics replaced 16-bit graphics as the more modern option. The 32-bit gaming era was pioneered by the Sony PlayStation. Games for the platform were distributed on CDs, allowing developers to store more data on the discs. The 3D visuals in many PlayStation games were great, yet they were still behind those in today’s games.\n\nThe era of 64-bit\n\nFor 3D graphics, the Nintendo 64 was a game-changer. Games like Super Mario 64, which debuted in 1996 and drew amazing power from the new Nintendo 64 console, completely changed the way 3D platformers were made. The underlying technique for producing 3D visuals, however, continued to rely on deft sprite placement and manipulation.\n\nAn Increase in 3D Graphics\n\nSega debuted its Dreamcast gaming platform in 1999. For the first time, 3D images began to mimic those from contemporary video games. In contrast to the previous generation of games that employed sprites, titles like Sonic Adventure were made possible by advancements in computer hardware. Games like Crazy Taxi, Shenmue, and Jet Set Radio on the Sega Dreamcast showcased some of the best graphics and gameplay ever seen in a video game. Sega was ahead of its time with the Dreamcast. Moreover, the Dreamcast was the first gaming system with an included modular modem for online play. The three major game developers of today, Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, eventually adopted a similar strategy with the release of the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.\n\nContemporary graphics\n\nThe 21st century saw an even greater innovation in graphics. Higher frame rates and high quality graphics are common in today’s video games than they were even 20 years ago. Also, the images appear considerably more lifelike. In fact, than anyone could have imagined just a few decades ago, the graphics in games like LA Noire: The VR Case Files are more lifelike. Several games include beautiful, nearly photorealistic visuals and a cinematic level of detail.\n\nOver the next two decades, game graphics are likely to change even more as virtual reality and machine learning technology provide game developers greater alternatives.\n\nThe Evolution of Video Game Graphics was fun, we hope you enjoyed it. You might be playing video games in a virtual reality environment similar to The Matrix in 50 or 100 years. Perhaps you aren’t even aware that you are engaging in a game!"
