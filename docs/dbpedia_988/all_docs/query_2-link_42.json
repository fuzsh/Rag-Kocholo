        "text": "Replace Sprite From File\n\nThe key image we imported back in Tutorial 4 doesn't look so at home in this Space Hub background. So, let's replace that key image with a new key image that looks more alien. Save the following alien key image to your computer. We'll be importing it into AGS Editor in a moment.\n\nWithin the Sprite Manager, navigate the \"Sprite Tree View\" and \"Sprite Preview Window\" until you can find where you imported the key earlier. Right-click on it and choose \"Replace sprite from file...\".\n\nNavigate to and select the new alien key image in the dialog box, and then you'll be presented with this:\n\nThis is the Import Sprite window. You'll see the image from the file that you chose, along with various options. The \"Zoom\" slider on the right allows you to zoom in on the image (very useful for low resolution graphics), and the \"Transparent color\" section options allow you to choose how AGS decides which color is the image's transparent color. \"Tiled Sprite Import\" will be discussed later in this tutorial.\n\nNow, you have two choices:\n\nIf you want to import the whole image, just click the \"Import\" button, and you're done.\n\nIf on the other hand you only want to import a portion of the image, then you need to right-drag the mouse within the image to select the area that you want to import. You will see a pink grid appear over the image to help you track your selection. (Don't forget, you can zoom in on the image!) Once you've got it, click the \"Import\" button and the selected area of the image will be imported.\n\nNOTE: For character graphics, make sure you import graphics that are a suitable size for the game backgrounds. For example, don't import a 320x200-sized image for your character if your game resolution is 320x200. A good size for games with this size of screen resolution would be about 20x50 pixels."
