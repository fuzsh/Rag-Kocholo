        "text": "Yes, it is aliased, but how is it not pixel art? When I draw in GIMP sometimes, I might draw stuff just like as shown in the CD-I Link screenshot; I use the pencil tool with alias, which to me is helpful for editing details, and then I color in with the bucket fill tool afterwards. This is definitely not vector art. What I’m describing is raster/bitmap art. But why can’t it be called pixel art? It is pixel art because it uses pixels and it is aliased. I don’t see anything wrong with using pixel art. But if you want to be more professional, like how most animations are done in production companies, then it’s best to use raster/bitmap art, particularly for background paintings and animation sketches. I agree with you that it is not exactly pixel art in the conventional sense, which is aliased like the method I’ve described earlier, but no matter how any of us look at it, bitmap/raster drawings are still pixel art. Even when you export vector graphics to GIF, PNG or JPG, it will become bitmap/raster drawings and therefore pixel art, just anti-aliased. When you zoom in on vector layers, the vector outlines and edges will appear smooth, never pixelate, and inherently anti-aliased.\n\nI’m sorry if I made you upset. I don’t mean to cause an argument over semantics. Please forgive me.\n\nThe game was made in 1993, the technology that was available in that year was limited when compared to now. Sure, it was advanced when compared to say, 1983, when primitive methods of making hand-drawn animation on a computer was around. But back in 1983, the drawings were still done on paper as it was normal back then, then the drawings were scanned into the computer and colored in. One of the first TV shows to use this primitive process was the last two seasons of The Jetsons, which was broadcasted in 1985. Hanna-Barbera was pretty cutting-edge back then when it came to television.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I don’t want to offend you and argue over semantics here, but the screenshot that I’ve shown you from the game’s cutscenes is still pixel art, even though you are right that is pure raster/bitmap graphics. But how is it not pixel art? It is drawn with aliased raster graphics, which is how video games used to be made in the past and continue to be to this day. So, why can’t it be called pixel art? It is pixel art.\n\nAlso, in reference to your previous reply, I wouldn’t call the screenshot I’ve posted a sprite, this is a sprite which would be in the game itself, usually they are small hence low-resolution when compared to the background. Granted, the sprite is scaled to a larger size, but this is what I could find. They are also playable and usually in side-scroller games like this:\n\nThe cutscenes from CD-I Link on the other hand have a much higher resolution hence larger screen size than the Link sprites in the game itself, resulting in much greater detail of the characters, backgrounds and props, like this:\n\nBut no matter how we look at either the Luigi sprite sheet or the CD-I Link cutscene screenshot, they are still pixel art nonetheless, which you could define as aliased raster/bitmap graphics.\n\nBut here’s the thing though, even anti-aliased raster graphics and rasterized vector graphics are pixel art. Also, like you said earlier that in video game terminology, both the cutscenes and playable characters are still considered sprites. I get it.\n\nBut I just want to experiment with making animation like this because I think it would be in some ways easier than usual animation process done by most professional studios and even ametuer filmmakers. I will definitely give Pixelorama a shot. It looks good to me.\n\nUntil the vector coloring tools are fixed, which won’t be for a long while, I will try using either Pencil2D or better yet pixelorama for making animated movies.\n\nI’m sorry if I offended you, since you are basically like the Big Kahuna of Pencil2D. I respect you greatly.\n\n@JacobZeier1992 Hey Jacob, I don’t think anyone here considers themselves “kings” or in a position of power to shut down others opinions. Everyone’s opinion is important, don’t worry. I can see there is a language barrier. English is not my native language either.\n\nWhen talking about pixel art there are many schools of thought and ideas, but most artists consider pixel-art to be what I described before, which is an intentional raster drawing with limited colors, and purposefully placed pixels on the screen from scratch.\n\nWhat scribblemaniac mentioned might be true that the Zelda image might not be “pixel-art” in the sense of the previous definition, but it is indeed a raster image made of pixels and that is a fact we all can agree on.\n\nEach person that creates artwork will have their opinions forged by experience or acquired knowledge, but at the end of the day what matters is that these kinds of discussions where opinions and facts are mixed together are not to be taken personally.\n\nAt this point I don’t really think it’s important to discuss if something is or isn’t pixel-art. Your original question was if you could make, and I quote “specifically pixel-style animation” with Pencil2D. The answer was yes, and we provided tips on how to achieve that.\n\nRelated to the confusion from our comments, I for example have a miscommunication problem in real life. I tend to provide too many ideas at the same time, assuming people can understand them, and without proper context or speech regulation people tend to misunderstand me pretty quickly and I have to re-explain myself or clear up confusion after confusion, so perhaps your comment on vector after we were taking about raster was misunderstood like that.\n\nOf course I can’t speak for Scribblemaniac or yourself, but I’m personally not offended at all by your comments.\n\nEven if sometimes I have some difficulty understanding what you’re trying to convey, because of the language barrier I understand perfectly that any perceived attitude or “tone” we can read on the text, might not be there at all, so I hope that you too are not offended by our comments either, as none of us here reply with the intent of offending or making users feel uncomfortable, otherwise we would not even try to help .\n\nTo me “text has no emotion” and these discussions should be considered as simple exchanges of words and knowledge if nothing else. Don’t read too much into these replys, and keep the knowledge and learning. We hope to see more of your work in the future regardless of the software and techniques you use. Until next time!"
