        "text": "The field of computer graphics focuses on using technology to create works of art and pictures. Computer graphics are a fundamental technology used in many specialized applications today, including digital photography, movies, video games, digital art, mobile phone and computer displays. Numerous specialized pieces of hardware and software have been created, and computer graphics hardware now powers the majority of devices' displays.\n\nIt is a modern and expansive field in computer science. Verne Hudson and William Fetter, computer graphics researchers at Boeing, came up with the term in 1960. It is frequently referred to as CG or, more commonly, as computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the context of movies. Computer science research focuses on the technical elements of computer graphics.\n\nThe task of successfully and meaningfully presenting art and visual data to the user falls to computer graphics. In addition, it's utilized to process visual data that comes from the real world, such pictures and videos. Animation, movies, advertisements, and video games have all undergone radical change as a result of the advancement of computer graphics.\n\nUnderstanding Computer Graphics\n\nIn a broad sense, \"roughly everything on computers which is not text or sound\" has been referred to as computer graphics. Generally speaking, the word \"computer graphics\" can mean numerous distinct things:\n\nthe computer's depiction and tinkering with picture data\n\nthe different methods for creating and modifying photographs\n\nSee the subject of computer graphics for techniques for creating and modifying visual information digitally.\n\nComputer graphics are widely used today. These images can be seen in and on newspapers, television, and weather forecasts, as well as during a number of other medical tests and operations. Complex data may be presented in an easier to comprehend and interpret way with the help of a well-made graph. Such graphs are employed in the media to show papers, reports, theses, and other presentation materials.\n\nTo display data, several technologies have been developed. Animated graphics, two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated images are some of the numerous categories that it may be divided into. Although 3D computer graphics are more prevalent now thanks to advancements in technology, 2D graphics continue to be prevalent.\n\nA branch of computer science known as computer graphics has arisen to study techniques for digitally synthesising and modifying visual images. Other specialized fields have emerged over the past ten years, such as information visualization and scientific visualization, which are more focused on \"the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, biological, etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so on, possibly with a dynamic (time) component.\"\n\nHistory of Computer Graphics\n\nThe developments in the fields of electrical engineering, technology, and television in the first half of the 20th century served as the foundational sciences for the creation of contemporary computer graphics. Since the Lumiere brothers' use of mattes to produce special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, screens have been able to display art, but such displays were constrained and non-interactive.\n\nThe oscilloscope and the military's command panel, the more direct forerunners of the field, were made possible by the invention of the first cathode ray tube, the Braun tube, which was made in 1897. These devices offered the first two-dimensional display screens that reacted to programming or human input.\n\nBut until the 1950s as well as the post-World War II era, computer graphics was hardly known as a field of study. At that time, the field was born out of a combination of purely academic research in universities and laboratories into more advanced computers and the continued military advancement of technologies like radar, and advanced aviation, and rocketry. In order to process the vast amount of information produced by these initiatives, new display types were required, which is how the field of computer graphics came to be.\n\nJohn Whitney was regarded as a pioneer and one of the early computer animators throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Early in the 1960s, William Alan Fetter, a graphic designer for Boeing America, became familiar with the phrase \"computer graphics.\" With the introduction of graphics hardware, the phrase \"computer graphics\" was created.\n\nAdditionally, it serves as a hub for hardware innovation that enables interoperability in computer graphics. The Lincoln Laboratory at MIT created the TX-2 in the 1950s, combining it with a number of unique interfaces. This program's creation also gave her the appearance of being Avan Sutherland, the father of computer graphics. Additionally, General Motors produced the DAC-1, the company's first designed fuel system.\n\nImages in Computer Graphics\n\nComputer graphics come in a variety of forms, each of which has a specific application. For instance, the majority of games nowadays utilize three-dimensional graphics, but the majority of visuals use two-dimensional images.\n\nTwo-Dimensional\n\nA two-dimensional graphic is one that was created digitally by a computer using methods that were identified by the models themselves. Originally intended for printing and drawing techniques including typography, cartography, industrial drawing, advertising, and more, these 2D images are mostly utilized in software for such purposes. These visuals in these applications serve as both a depiction of reality and an autonomous, stand-alone good with added value. Because they allow the image more immediate control than 3D graphics, these graphics are favoured in earlier ways.\n\nThree-Dimensional\n\nIn contrast to 2D graphics, which employ three-dimensional representations of the technical data contained in computers to do computations and create 2D visuals, 3D graphics are a subset of computer graphics. And Martin Newell's 1975 work at the University of Utah produced the first three-dimensional model. The original jug is housed in the National Museum of Computer History in California, the United States of America, and its form is present in most 3D programs.\n\nTypes of Computer Graphics\n\nA large majority of individuals are likely to see images on computers, smartphones, and tablets without giving the processing or screen presentation of the image any thought. That's wonderful if you're just using the picture for graphics purposes, but anyone who wants to create or edit computer graphics images has to be aware of the design of the image in question. Here it shall describe numerous types of computer graphics in this part. They are:\n\n1. Vector Graphics\n\nScalable vector graphics (SVG), another name for vector graphics, are very popular. Similar to connect-the-dot games one might have played as a youngster, these visuals are made of anchoring dots that are joined by lines and curves. These visuals are characterized as resolution independent since they are not dependent on pixels, making them infinitely expandable.\n\nNo matter how big they are, their lines are precise and retain all of their beauty and detail. Additionally, these visuals are independent of the device they are displayed on, therefore the quality of them is not influenced by the amount of dots or pixels a printer or screen can produce. The files are quite minimal in size because they only include lines and anchor points.\n\n2. Raster Graphics\n\nRaster pictures are created using small colored and toned dots or pixels as the building blocks. When a picture is zoomed in or magnified, pixels take on the appearance of tiny squares on graph paper. Digital cameras, computer scanners, or raster-based software are used to produce these images. There is a maximum number of pixels that each image may have; the number of pixels affects how well an image turns out. Resolution is what is meant here. At a similar or bigger size than the original, more pixels improve quality, but doing so also makes the file larger and requires more storage space.\n\nThe resolution decreases with decreasing pixel count. The maximum image size that may be increased without pixel visibility is determined by resolution. On the other hand, a high-quality image printed at a tiny size will make the pixels \"cram\" together and make the image seem just as unprofessional as if there weren't enough pixels in a huge image.\n\nApplication Of Computer Graphics\n\nThe production, modification, and storage of many types of pictures and objects are all dealt with in computer graphics. Computer graphics may be used for a variety of purposes, including:\n\nComputer Art: With the use of computer graphics, we are able to produce both artistic and commercial art, such as paint and animation programs.

CAD enhances the drawing with fine details, resulting in sharper, more accurate, and drawings with better specifications.\n\nGraphics for presentations: Utilizing computer graphics tools allows for the construction of bar graphs, pie charts, and time charts in addition to summarizing financial, statistical, mathematical, scientific, and economic data for research reports and managerial reports.\n\nEntertainment: The movie and video game industries are where computer graphics find the majority of their applications. used to produce cartoon animation films, music videos, TV programs, and motion movies. Computer graphics assist in delivering such qualities in the gaming sector, where concentration and engagement are the primary actors.\n\nEducation: In order to teach a vast array of concepts and basics in a way that is simple to comprehend and learn, computer-generated models are of utmost use. Computer graphics may be used to build a variety of teaching models that will increase student interest in the subject.\n\nTraining: It is possible to teach candidates using specialized systems, such as simulators, in an approach that will enable them to acquire the material in a little amount of time and with greater comprehension. Computer graphics may be used to easily and effectively create training modules.\n\nVisualization: Nowadays, there is a greater need than ever to visualize things. Data visualization, for example, aids in discovering insights from data. To observe and analyze the behavior of processes around us, we also need appropriate visualization, which is made possible by the appropriate application of computer graphics.\n\nProcessing of Images: To be utilized in diverse contexts, various sorts of pictures or images need to be edited. One of computer graphics' numerous uses is the processing of current pictures into improved ones for better interpretation.\n\nAutomated Drawing: The main benefit that comes from employing computer graphics for this purpose is the ultimate and highly desired clarity and accuracy that we get from such drawings for the safe manufacturing of machines using these drawings. Computer graphics are used for designing, modifying, and creating various parts of machines as well as the entire machine itself.\n\nGraphical User Interface: The use of pictures, images, icons, pop-up menus, and graphical objects contributes to the creation of a user-friendly environment where working is simple and enjoyable. By utilizing computer graphics, we can create a setting where everything is automated and anyone can easily perform the desired action.\n\nImportance of Computer Graphics\n\nThere are several domains in which computer graphics are crucial now, and their significance is only increasing. The importance of computer graphics is best illustrated by the following main points:\n\nDesigning\n\nWith the use of computer graphics, it is possible to communicate complicated concepts graphically.

That plan calls for development to happen later. Computer graphics have made it feasible to create this design.\n\nEntertainment\n\nAn essential part of the entertainment sector is computer graphics. This contains a significant amount of video game, film, and visual effects stuff. Today, computer graphics are used to create and present all movies, web shows, news, etc. In order for all of us to enjoy watching whatever material is inside of it, it must appear authentic to all of you.\n\nIn addition, one must have watched the films and online series for Game of Thrones, Avatar, Matrix, Avengers, Iron Man, Baahubali, The Jungle Book, King Kong, and other popular shows and movies. Virtual effects are also provided in this along with computer graphics. Because of this, the events depicted in those films and web series seem genuine.\n\nEducation and Training\n\nComputer graphics are frequently utilized in training and education to assist students in visualizing challenging ideas. Computer animations and visuals may be used to illustrate difficult subjects in a more comprehensible and interesting way. For all pupils, it has improved access to and enjoyment from learning.\n\nTeachers in the majority of schools and universities utilize digital tools to help their pupils comprehend their subjects more fully. Therefore, they employ projectors to demonstrate visual materials like photographs or films to dispel any misconceptions that students may have. This allows the teacher to more clearly explain each element of the picture or video that is displayed to the pupils. Consequently, the value of computer graphics in education or learning is essential.\n\nAdvertising and Marketing\n\nAll advertising in today's world now takes place online. In order to provide eye-catching visuals that can communicate a brand's message, computer graphics are frequently employed in marketing and advertising. Animated logos, commercial movies, and other marketing products are nevertheless produced using computer graphics. Since everything is now accessible online, everyone prefers to offer their items online. Marketing and advertising are needed for this. In order to fulfill this criterion, computer graphics are employed.\n\nFor marketing or advertising, famous platforms like Instagram, Facebook Ads, and Google Ads are just a few examples. Products are sealed on all of these channels by marketing via video, ads, or branding. These advertisements, banners, and brand logos were created using computer graphics.\n\nComputer graphics are becoming a crucial tool for companies to use to market their products as e-commerce has grown. Customers enjoy a more engaging and realistic buying experience thanks to high-quality product photos and interactive 3D models.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nWith the use of computers, computer graphics creates visuals and artistic works.
