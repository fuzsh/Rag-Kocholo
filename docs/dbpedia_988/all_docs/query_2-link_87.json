It is used to make most visual elements in a project, such as the player, enemies, projectiles, explosions and non-tiling scenery. (Tiled scenery is much better done with the Tiled Background object.)\n\nIf a Sprite has a single animation with a single frame, it just shows an image without animating. However, multiple animations can be added to Sprite objects with the Animations editor.\n\nAll instances of Sprite objects share their animations. In other words, there is a single set of images comprising the animations which belongs to the object type, and these images are referenced by instances.\n\nSprites can have effects applied. For more information, see Effects.\n\nScripting\n\nWhen using JavaScript or TypeScript coding, the features of this object can be accessed via the ISpriteInstance script interface.\n\nSprite properties\n\nAnimations\n\nClick the Edit link to open the Animations editor for the object. All instances of the object type share a single set of animations.\n\nSize\n\nClick the Make 1:1 link to size the selection at original size (100%). This makes the width and height of the object the same as its first animation frame image.\n\nInitially visibile\n\nSet whether the object is shown (visible) or hidden (invisible) when the layout starts.\n\nInitial animation\n\nSet the initially displaying animation.\n\nInitial frame\n\nSet the initially displaying animation frame from the object's initial animation. This is a zero-based index, so the first frame is 0.\n\nEnable collisions\n\nEnable or disable collisions for the object. Disabling collisions means no collision events will register for the object nor will any behaviors on the object register collisions with solids or jump-thrus. Disabling collisions does not improve performance unless there are some events or behaviors that test collisions.\n\nPreview Paid plans only\n\nEnable to run a preview of the initial animation directly in the Layout View.\n\nSprite conditions\n\nFor conditions in common to other objects, see Common conditions.\n\nCompare frame\n\nCompare the current animation frame number, which is a zero-based index (the first frame is 0).\n\nCompare frame tag\n\nCompare the current animation frame tag.\n\nCompare speed\n\nCompare the speed of the current animation, in animation frames per second. Animations which are playing backwards (e.g. with ping-pong animations) have a negative speed.\n\nIs flipped\n\nIs mirrored\n\nTrue if the object has been flipped or mirrored with the Set flipped or Set mirrored actions.\n\nIs playing\n\nTrue if a given animation is currently set. Animations are identified by their name (case insensitive).\n\nOn any finished\n\nTriggered when any animation reaches the end. Looping animations do not finish.\n\nOn finished\n\nTriggered when a given animation reaches the end. Looping animations do not finish. Animations are identified by their name (case insensitive).\n\nOn frame changed\n\nTriggered whenever the animation switches to another frame while the animation is playing.\n\nCollisions enabled\n\nTrue if the object's collisions are currently enabled.\n\nOn image URL loaded\n\nOn image URL failed to load\n\nTriggered when Load image from URL finishes downloading the image and is ready to display it, or if the load fails.\n\nSprite actions\n\nFor actions common to other objects, see Common actions.\n\nAdd/remove animation\n\nAdd or remove an animation with the provided animation name. When adding a new animation, the animation name must be unique, and the new animation will have a single transparent frame sized 100x100. The last animation cannot be removed, as Sprite objects must have at least one animation.\n\nAdd/remove animation frame\n\nAdd or remove an animation frame in the animation with the given name. When adding a new frame, it will be transparent and sized 100x100. The last animation frame cannot be removed, as an animation must have at least one frame. The Where parameter is the zero-based index, or animation frame tag, of the location to modify, and can be -1 to refer to the last frame in the animation. When adding an animation frame not at the end, it is inserted just before the given frame.\n\nSet animation\n\nChange the currently playing animation to another animation. Animations are identified by their name (case insensitive). The new animation can either play from the beginning or from the same frame number as the last animation was on (current frame).\n\nSet flipped\n\nSet whether the object image appears vertically flipped or normal. This also affects image points and the collision polygon. This is a shortcut for inverting the height (a flipped Sprite's height is a negative size).\n\nSet mirrored\n\nSet whether the object image appears horizontally mirrored or normal. This is useful for platform games. Mirroring also affects image points and the collision polygon. This is a shortcut for inverting the width (a mirrored Sprite's width is a negative size).\n\nSet frame\n\nSet the current animation frame that is showing, either by its zero-based index, or a string of the animation frame tag. If a tag is provided and there are multiple animation frames with the same tag, then it will use the first one. After this action the animation will continue to play at its current speed.\n\nSet repeat-to frame\n\nSet the frame to return to when looping in the current animation, either by its zero-based index, or a string of the animation frame tag. This essentially changes the Repeat to property of the animation in the Animation Editor. It is especially useful when reversing animations, since the default of repeating to the first frame is no longer suitable. Instead when playing looping animations in reverse it is more useful to repeat to the last frame of the animation (so the animation actually repeats, instead of getting stuck on the first frame).\n\nSet speed\n\nSet the playback rate of the current animation, in animation frames per second. Instances can have different animation speeds. You can also use negative speeds, which causes the animation to play backwards. Note in this case repeating animations should set the Repeat to frame at the end of the animation, otherwise by default it repeats to frame 0 (the start of the animation), causing the animation to stop after playing in reverse.\n\nStart\n\nIf the current animation is stopped, start playing the animation again. Playback can either resume from the current frame, or restart from the beginning.\n\nStop\n\nStop the current animation from playing. The object will be left showing the current animation frame.\n\nSpawn another object\n\nCreate a new instance of a given object type. The new instance is created at the current object's position and also set to the same angle. The created object can be on any layer (chosen by its name or its zero-based number), and it can be positioned by an image point instead of the object's origin (chosen by its name or number). If a Family Paid plans only is created, a random object type in the family is picked. Tick Create hierarchy when creating the root object in a hierarchy to automatically create the rest of the scene graph hierarchy with connections in place. Choose a valid Template name so the new instance is created based on the template rather than an arbitrary instance.\n\nSet scale\n\nSets the width and height to a multiple of the object's original size, similar to zooming the object proportionally. For example, if the object is 50x100, Set scale to 2 will set its size to 100x200, and Set scale to 0.1 will set its size to 5x10.\n\nLoad image from URL\n\nLoad an image from a given URL. The current animation frame will be replaced with the image. It is not shown until the image has finished downloading, and On image URL loaded triggers. Images loaded from different domains are subject to the same cross-domain restrictions as AJAX requests - for more information see the section on cross-domain in the AJAX object. Data URIs can also be passed as an image, e.g. from a canvas snapshot or webcam image. The Size parameter sets whether the Sprite object will be set to the image size when it loads, or whether to keep its current size and stretch the image.\n\nSet collisions enabled\n\nEnable or disable collisions for the object. Disabling collisions means no collision events will register for the object nor will any behaviors on the object register collisions with solids or jump-thrus. Disabling collisions does not improve performance unless there are some events or behaviors that test collisions.\n\nSet solid collision filter\n\nEnable or disable collisions with the Solid behavior according to tags. Specify tags using a string of space-separated tag names. In Inclusive mode, collisions are only enabled with solids that match any of the given tags; if no tags are specified, collisions are disabled with all solids. In Exclusive mode, collisions are disabled with solids that match any of the given tags; if no tags are specified, collisions are enabled for all solids (the default).\n\nSprite expressions\n\nFor expressions common to other objects, see common expressions."
