        "text": "Video game animation is something a game can hardly do without these days. It’s not unheard of for players to take notice of poor animation, even when you’ve got superb graphics in your game. Animation enlivens the game, increases immersion and engagement, and helps you give players the experience that will captivate them for a while.\n\nWhether your game is 2D or 3D, simple or complex, regardless of the genre and type — to attract players and to keep them, you’ll need to invest in gaming animation.\n\nThis article will touch upon our experience with animating the works of our artists and 3D modeling specialists, whom we asked for input and to share their knowledge.\n\nBeing in the mobile game development industry for some time already, they have worked in a variety of styles, both 2D and 3D, realistic and cartoonish, even anime.\n\nAs a mobile game development company, we’ve got a somewhat niche expertise, focused on mobile games. However, the process of mobile video game animation is essentially the same as animation for PC/console or even movies. The specifics of mobile platforms come into play at a later stage, posing unique challenges for animation specialists. We will cover those in this article as well. And if you have specific questions this article doesn’t answer, drop by our contact form with them ;)\n\nHow does video game animation affect game performance?\n\nThe short and simple answer to this question is that animation makes games more fun, of course. However, if we were to dissect the whole into parts, here are some of the main things that become better when mobile video game animation gets involved.\n\nMore immersive gameplay\n\nFluid and realistic animations help players immerse themselves in the game world by making characters and environments feel more lifelike. This immersion is essential for creating emotional connections and engaging experiences.\n\nIt’s especially noticeable (and important) in action games, of course. But even in a 2D visual novel-type game with limited animation, having a character smile or take something out of their pocket makes players more engaged.\n\nCharacter expression and personality\n\nSpeaking about characters smiling :) Animation allows developers to convey the personalities and emotions of characters through their movements and gestures. Whether it's a tiny smile or a boisterous laugh, the stride they walk with, an expression made in a tense moment, animations bring characters to life and make them more relatable.\n\nGameplay clarity\n\nClear and responsive mobile game animation helps communicate gameplay mechanics to the player. Whether it's indicating a successful action, conveying damage, or signaling the start of a special move, animations provide visual feedback that enhances the player's understanding of the game.\n\nStorytelling and cinematics\n\nIf you’re building a narrative-driven game, you might need cinematic scenes. Even if your game itself doesn’t offer a lot in terms of animation — again, a visual novel game can be an example — an animated cinematic scene here and there will help advance the plot and develop characters.\n\nEnvironmental detail\n\nAnimation extends beyond characters to include environmental elements such as weather effects, foliage movement, and dynamic lighting. These animations contribute to the atmosphere of the game world, making it feel more dynamic and immersive.\n\nCombat and action sequences\n\nIn action-oriented games, fluid animations are essential for creating satisfying combat and action sequences. Responsive controls combined with visually impressive animations make combat feel impactful and enjoyable for players.\n\nCustomization and personalization\n\nMany games offer customization options for characters and avatars these days, allowing players to tailor their appearance and animations to their preferences. This level of personalization enhances player engagement and investment in their in-game personas.\n\nTypes of video game animation\n\nWhat can be animated in video games? The obvious one is characters. But that’s not all. Animation in video games can be applied to everything. We have four main types of animation in game development:\n\nAny of those animation types can also be 2D or 3D — regardless of the style you choose for your game. As in, you can use 3D game animation to move a 2D character or object in a 3D environment. Likewise, both 2D and 3D characters can be made to only move in a two-dimensional space.\n\nAlthough, most of the time, developers animate games under the same style as art.\n\n6 key animation principles used in video games\n\nIn truth, there are numerous things that need to be considered when you’re getting into animation for video games. There are more than six. However, if we were to try to list all of them, this article wouldn’t see an end any time soon. So we’ll cover here the fundamentals our animation specialists follow.\n\n#1 Timing\n\nTiming refers to the speed and rhythm of movements within an animation. It determines how fast or slow objects or characters move from one pose to another. Timing is crucial for ensuring that actions feel responsive and appropriately paced, especially when it comes to mobile games — considering the limited screen space and short attention spans of mobile users. Smooth and well-timed animations enhance the overall gameplay experience by providing a response and feedback loop for player actions.\n\n#2 Spacing\n\nSpacing means the placement and distribution of keyframes or poses along the animation timeline. It determines the distance and trajectory that objects or characters travel between poses. Spacing is used to create smooth and natural movements, particularly in character animations and transitions. Proper spacing helps avoid abrupt changes and ensures that animations flow seamlessly from one frame to the next.\n\n#3 Easing\n\nEasing, also known as interpolation, is the acceleration and deceleration of movement within an animation. It adds a sense of realism and weight to objects or characters by mimicking the way things move in the real world.\n\nImagine a person running full speed and hitting a wall because they didn’t slow down gradually. Satirical cartoons love this effect, a character getting splattered on a wall or ground. Even if there’s no wall in the way of your characters’ movement, the lack of easing will make it look like the stop was unnatural, too abrupt. Like there is, in fact, a wall, but it’s invisible.\n\nEasing is used to make movements feel more natural and organic, especially during character actions like running, jumping, and attacking. By applying easing curves to keyframe transitions, animators can create smoother and more lifelike animations that enhance player immersion.\n\n#4 Anticipation\n\nAnticipation is about preparing the audience for an upcoming action by exaggerating the movement or pose beforehand. It helps build excitement, making actions feel more impactful and satisfying.\n\nIn video game animation, anticipation is used to foreshadow player actions and provide visual cues for upcoming events or interactions. For example, a character might crouch down before jumping, indicating to the player that a jump is about to occur.\n\n#5 Follow-through\n\nFollow-through, also known as overshoot or settle, refers to the continuation of movement after the primary action has occurred. It adds secondary motion and enhances the sense of weight and momentum when we make animations. Follow-through is used to add detail and finesse to character movements.\n\nFor example, after a character stops after a sprint, you can add an animation of them regaining balance — a slight movement forwards and then backwards for the upper body. This will add realism and detail to the motion.\n\n#6 Squash and stretch\n\nSquash and stretch involves deforming objects or characters to convey elasticity and flexibility in their movements. It exaggerates motion and adds visual interest to animations. These principles are used to convey impact and emphasize key moments in gameplay. For example, when a character jumps, their body might squash as they crouch down and stretch as they leap into the air, enhancing the sense of energy and excitement.\n\nAnimation techniques used in video game development\n\nSo, how do we use animation in mobile video games? Is there a single correct way? Of course not. Depending on the style of your game’s art, the game’s overall complexity, and sometimes even your budget, the techniques applicable for game design animation will vary.\n\nSprite animation\n\nThis is the technique used for 2D animation exclusively, and it’s also the oldest video game animation technique in existence. (It’s been around since the 1970s.)\n\nWith sprite animation, a character in a game is made up of several individual images (sprites) representing different parts of the body or different poses. By rapidly displaying these images one after another, we create an illusion of movement.\n\nSprite animation isn’t exclusive to characters, of course. It’s used for any animation, including even VFX.\n\nKeyframe animation\n\nKeyframe animation, sometimes also called pose-to-pose animation, is the most popular animation technique in 2D games, though it has more uses than just 2D games.\n\nBasically, to animate via keyframes, the artist animator creates the asset’s looks at starting and ending points — that’s the main keyframes. After that, they set up timing — how long the action takes — and create notable poses at specific points between the starting and ending keyframes.\n\nDepending on how smooth you want the animation to be, there might be only a few keyframes at loose intervals, or they can be densely packed with a keyframe for each miniscule shift.\n\nThese days, artists don’t really need to draw each tiny frame by hand — a computer algorithm can do that instead. The artist only needs to provide several most important poses for the machine to rely on.\n\nSkeletal animation\n\nAs an alternative to animating each part of a character separately like in sprite animation, or drawing multiple frames for keyframe animation, there’s skeletal animation.\n\nSkeletal animation — also called rigging — involves creating a digital skeleton for the character. Animators then move and rotate the bones of this skeleton, and the software automatically deforms the character's mesh to match the skeleton's movements. This technique allows for more fluid and realistic animations while only drawing the character once.\n\nWhen using skeletal animation for mobile games, the trick is to make the rig simpler. With a simpler rig, the animating process takes less time, and it’s also easier to optimize the animation in the engine later.\n\n— Andriy, lead 3D artist at Mind Studios Games\n\nIt’s most frequently used for 3D game animation, although using skeleton technique for 2D animation is also possible.\n\nMotion capture\n\nNow this is an expensive technique mostly used for AAA video games. Motion capture involves actual people wearing special suits covered in sensors and cameras capturing their movements. This data is then translated into digital animations for characters in games.\n\n[Image source: Britannica]\n\nMotion capture allows for incredibly lifelike animations because they're based on real human movements. Besides the big movement, it’s also incredibly useful for translating facial expressions into game — something all other types of animation struggle with.\n\nParticle effects\n\nNow, this is from the realm of VFX — the visual effects. Particle effects involve simulating small, often short-lasting visual elements like smoke, fire, sparks, drops, or magical spells. These effects are created by generating and manipulating thousands of individual “particles” (tiny dots) that move and behave according to predefined rules.\n\nThese are the most widely used techniques in animation for video games. Each of them has its own peculiarities and most suitable use cases. An experienced animation specialist will help you choose the proper technique based on your game description.\n\nHere’s a hack our artists employ in their processes:\n\nFor general and small animation, we use Mixamo, it’s a great tool that saves us a ton of time and effort that we can instead dedicate to more complex and unique animations.\n\nAt the same time, when I do need a unique animation that has few if any references, I take out my smartphone, put it on a tripod, and record the moves. It’s quite fun, and there’s no better way to know how to animate a move than to perform it yourself.\n\n— Andriy, lead 3D artist at Mind Studios Games\n\nChallenges and considerations\n\nAnimation comes with special needs and requirements for any platform, but animation in mobile video games has its own flavor, and oftentimes that flavor is bitter. As a company specializing in mobile games, we’ve encountered a range of challenges, and found solutions for them — via trial and error as well as by seeking advice from the animation community.\n\nHere are some things that can become a headache for mobile game animators, and how to deal with them.\n\nBy addressing these challenges and implementing optimization strategies tailored to the specific requirements of mobile game development, we can create engaging and immersive experiences that run smoothly on a variety of devices.\n\nBest practices for mobile game animation\n\nBesides addressing the challenges, there are also recommendations for quality animation in mobile video games. They’re varied and numerous, as everything in life is, but there are those that we believe should be followed religiously by any mobile game animation specialist.\n\nBesides testing, which we’ve already mentioned above in the challenges section, there are three main practices we believe are useful even for animation novices.\n\n#1 Optimize your sprite sheets\n\nSprite sheets contain multiple animation frames packed into a single image. They’re made to reduce the number of draw calls and to improve rendering performance. When creating sprite sheets:\n\nArrange frames efficiently to minimize wasted space.\n\nUse texture compression formats like PNG or WebP to reduce file size without sacrificing image quality.\n\nConsider using tools or libraries that automate sprite sheet generation and optimization.\n\n#2 Use efficient animation data formats\n\nChoose animation data formats that are optimized for mobile platforms to minimize memory usage and loading times. Some efficient formats include:\n\nJSON: Lightweight and human-readable, suitable for storing animation data in a structured format.\n\nBinary formats: Compact and fast to load, reducing file size and memory overhead.\n\nFormats specific to game engines: Utilize animation data formats provided by popular game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine for seamless integration and performance optimization.\n\nAt Mind Studios Games, we’re building our games with Unity, which has its own animation functionality and imports files in .fbx or .obj formats easily. However, Unity is also compatible with Blender, 3ds Max, Maya and other software.\n\n#3 Leverage hardware acceleration\n\nLast, but not the least important, take advantage of hardware-accelerated graphics rendering to achieve smooth and responsive animations. To optimize hardware acceleration:\n\nUse graphics APIs like OpenGL ES or Vulkan that support hardware acceleration on mobile devices.\n\nImplement batching and instancing techniques to reduce draw calls and efficiently utilize GPU resources.\n\nOffload CPU-intensive tasks like physics calculations or AI processing to the GPU whenever possible.\n\nOverall, we always try — and advise everyone else — to design animations that respond to user input and enhance the overall gaming experience.\n\nSmooth transitions and easing functions make animations feel natural and fluid. Visual feedback for player actions improves responsiveness and engagement. Particle effects, lighting, and shaders add depth and polish to animations, making them visually appealing and immersive.\n\nAll this helps make animation for video games in a way that enhances the gaming experience, not annoys players with lagging. And if animation isn’t the only good thing about a game, then this game will captivate its audience for a while.\n\nCase studies and examples from Mind Studios Games\n\nIn our years on the mobile game development market, Mind Studios Games has created dozens of mobile games and tried our hand in a variety of genres, mechanics, and complexities. Thanks to this, we’ve acquired a range of animation skills applicable to any kind of game.\n\nDid you know that the jumping mechanic is one of the hardest things to do properly when it comes to video game animation? There are so many things to consider there that even some AAA games decide to forego it. We did jumping mechanics for our Beetle Riders game — players can have their beetles jump to catch more rewards, as well as to avoid obstacles and opponents.\n\nAmong our 2D games, animation-wise, we’re pretty proud of our Troop Tycoon, where we did a range of animated actions. Being an idle game, Troop Tycoon for the most part features short looped animations. However, we approached it with the mindset of seasoned idle game developers: in a game where a player doesn’t take all that many actions, the visuals need to be entertaining to watch and animation should be eye-pleasing.\n\nSo, we animated characters to reflect bits of personality, gave them a variety of tools, and tried to make them memorable. We think they came out quite nice 😀\n\nConclusion\n\nAnimation in video games is a potent attention grabber, able to help keep players in the game and add to your well-thought-out mechanics, art, setting, and narrative. Even the simplest-looking game with stickmen for characters will be heaps more enjoyable for players when said stickmen move smoothly and perform small but distinct actions.\n\nWith proper gaming animation, you can offer your players more immersion — regardless of the type and genre of your game. And with the advancement of technology, animation in mobile video games is already close to — and sometime on par with — its PC/console counterpart.\n\nIf you wish to up your game’s success chances, hire skilled professionals who know how to make animations that are fluid, seamless, and eye-catching.\n\nMind Studios Games has such specialists. Check out our games or get in touch with us directly so that we can show you what we can do (which is, we believe, quite a lot) 😏\n\n1"
