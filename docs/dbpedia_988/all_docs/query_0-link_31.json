Primarily used in Games and Film, Computer Graphics is a very large field in Computer Science, so this course will be an introduction to some of the historical techniques which make up the basis for a great deal of the techniques that are being used in modern Games and and Films.\n\nStudents will be working with primarily Realtime Graphics programming in this course.\n\nAssumed Knowledge\n\nBefore commencing this course, students should:\n\nHave a good grasp of Programming in C\n\nHave a basic knowledge of Linear Algebra and Trigonometry\n\nHave a passing knowledge of Object Oriented Techniques\n\nThese are assumed to have been acquired in the courses ...\n\nStudent Learning Outcomes\n\nAfter completing this course, students will:\n\nUnderstand the techniques that go into rendering\n\nModels and Geometry\n\nSimulation of Lighting in Graphics\n\nHave been introduced to coding with C++ and OpenGL\n\nHave created a virtual scene with:\n\nSimple 3D objects\n\nSimulated Lighting\n\nPossibly some post processing effects and animation\n\nTeaching Strategies\n\nLectures talk from a theoritical and conceptual perspective. Students will acquire a passion for the idea of Graphics as well as an understanding of the techniques that make things look realistic or artistic.\n\nTutorials provide concrete coding experience to implement the ideas shown in lectures.\n\nHomework gives students a chance to extend their knowledge beyond the otherwise short tutorials.\n\nAssignments allow students to put their learning into practice and show that they have understood the concepts in the course.\n\nTeaching Rationale\n\nThis course is taught with the fundamental idea that students are here because they're interested in Games and/or Film and want to know how these things are made. We're going to be constantly referencing turning points in these industry and part of the learning in the course will involve playing and watching these things to understand their importance.\n\nThis is most apparent in Lectures, which will be referencing important games and films and the idea of \"reading lists\" of important media. The focus in practice will be on how things are made and to try to get students as close to this as possible (in Tutorials) while also acknowledging that this is a massive field that we can only barely introduce in 9 weeks of teaching.\n\nStudent Conduct\n\nThe Student Code of Conduct ( Information , Policy ) sets out what the University expects from students as members of the UNSW community. As well as the learning, teaching and research environment, the University aims to provide an environment that enables students to achieve their full potential and to provide an experience consistent with the University's values and guiding principles. A condition of enrolment is that students inform themselves of the University's rules and policies affecting them, and conduct themselves accordingly.\n\nIn particular, students have the responsibility to observe standards of equity and respect in dealing with every member of the University community. This applies to all activities on UNSW premises and all external activities related to study and research. This includes behaviour in person as well as behaviour on social media, for example Facebook groups set up for the purpose of discussing UNSW courses or course work. Behaviour that is considered in breach of the Student Code Policy as discriminatory, sexually inappropriate, bullying, harassing, invading another's privacy or causing any person to fear for their personal safety is serious misconduct and can lead to severe penalties, including suspension or exclusion from UNSW.\n\nIf you have any concerns, you may raise them with your lecturer, or approach the School Ethics Officer , Grievance Officer , or one of the student representatives.\n\nPlagiarism is defined as using the words or ideas of others and presenting them as your own. UNSW and CSE treat plagiarism as academic misconduct, which means that it carries penalties as severe as being excluded from further study at UNSW. There are several on-line sources to help you understand what plagiarism is and how it is dealt with at UNSW:\n\nPlagiarism and Academic Integrity\n\nUNSW Plagiarism Procedure\n\nMake sure that you read and understand these. Ignorance is not accepted as an excuse for plagiarism. In particular, you are also responsible that your assignment files are not accessible by anyone but you by setting the correct permissions in your CSE directory and code repository, if using. Note also that plagiarism includes paying or asking another person to do a piece of work for you and then submitting it as your own work.\n\nUNSW has an ongoing commitment to fostering a culture of learning informed by academic integrity. All UNSW staff and students have a responsibility to adhere to this principle of academic integrity. Plagiarism undermines academic integrity and is not tolerated at UNSW. Plagiarism at UNSW is defined as using the words or ideas of others and passing them off as your own.\n\nIf you haven't done so yet, please take the time to read the full text of\n\nUNSW's policy regarding academic honesty and plagiarism\n\nThe pages below describe the policies and procedures in more detail:\n\nStudent Code Policy\n\nStudent Misconduct Procedure\n\nPlagiarism Policy Statement\n\nPlagiarism Procedure\n\nYou should also read the following page which describes your rights and responsibilities in the CSE context:\n\nEssential Advice for CSE Students\n\nAssessment\n\nItem Topics Due Marks Assignment 1 Getting set up.\n\nPutting together a Dev environment for C++/OpenGL and showing the capabiility to use the basic techniques for rendering objects.

Assignment 3 released 11+ Stuvac and Exams Period - Assignment 3 due\n\nResources for Students\n\nTexts and recommended readings:\n\nhttps://learnopengl.com/ is the semi-official textbook for the course.\n\nCourse Evaluation and Development\n\nThis course is evaluated each session using the myExperience system.\n\nThe previous offering of this course was in 2019 and was a different course. We do not have access to the feedback from previous iterations, but it's also important to note that the current course is not an iteration of the previous course, it's a completely new offering built with the intention to bring some parts of the course closer to common graphics implementation practices and to give the course a big refresh (one could say we're trying to increase our refresh rate . . .)."
