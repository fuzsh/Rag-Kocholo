        "text": "Today, it is hard to think of video games without thinking of 3D games. Even though the indie scene has recently brought a revival of the 2D-pixel art style, AAA productions still have the 3D environment as their driving force. But what was the first 3D game?\n\nThe world of video games has witnessed an incredible journey since its inception, with each passing era introducing new advancements and innovations. All of those have contributed to the huge popularity that video games have today.\n\nAmong these milestones, the advent of three-dimensional (3D) games forever transformed the gaming landscape, paving the way for immersive experiences and realistic environments. 3D technology has even transcended video game applications.\n\nIn this article, we embark on a historical exploration of the evolution of 3D games, tracing their origins and discussing the game that ignited the revolution.\n\nFirst 3D game\n\nBefore the first 3D game, the gaming industry primarily thrived on two-dimensional (2D) titles. However, the desire to transcend the limitations of 2D graphics and create a more immersive experience drove developers to experiment with 3D technologies.\n\nThe concept of 3D graphics in gaming was not entirely new, as early attempts were made in the 1970s with wireframe graphics and vector displays.\n\nAlthough various early games dabbled with 3D elements, the title that often holds the distinction of being the first 3D game is Maze War. Developed in 1973 by a team of programmers at NASA’s Ames Research Center, Maze War was a multiplayer game where players roamed through a maze-like environment in search of opponents to shoot.\n\nWhile the game lacked sophisticated visuals by today’s standards, it introduced the core elements of three-dimensional gameplay and multiplayer interaction.\n\nThe rise of first-person shooters\n\nBuilding upon the foundations laid by the first 3D game, Maze War, the 1990s marked a watershed moment in the evolution of 3D gaming with the rise of first-person shooter (FPS) games.\n\nThis transformative era witnessed the release of groundbreaking titles like Wolfenstein 3D in 1992 and Doom in 1993, which not only harnessed the power of 3D graphics but also redefined the gaming landscape by delivering unprecedented levels of intensity and immersion.\n\nThese games seamlessly integrated fast-paced action, intricate exploration, and a first-person perspective, forever changing the way players interacted with virtual worlds.\n\nWolfenstein 3D, developed by id Software, was a trailblazing title that pushed the boundaries of what was possible in the realm of 3D gaming.\n\nIt introduced players to a fully three-dimensional environment where they assumed the role of a protagonist navigating through treacherous Nazi strongholds.\n\nThe game’s visceral gunplay and relentless combat, combined with its immersive first-person perspective, captivated players and set new standards for the FPS genre.\n\nHowever, it was Doom that truly catapulted the FPS genre into mainstream popularity. Developed by id Software, Doom unleashed a frenetic and adrenaline-fueled experience upon the gaming world. The game transported players to a dark and foreboding Martian moon base infested with demonic creatures.\n\nAs players navigated through intricate levels filled with secret passages, formidable enemies, and an arsenal of powerful weapons, Doom became a cultural phenomenon that forever transformed the gaming industry.\n\nThe impact of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom on the gaming industry cannot be overstated.\n\nTheir commercial success and critical acclaim paved the way for an explosion of FPS titles in the following years, sparking fierce competition among developers to push the boundaries of 3D graphics and gameplay even further.\n\nThe innovations introduced by these games became the blueprint for future FPS classics, such as the Quake series, Half-Life, and Halo, among others, which continue to shape the industry to this day.\n\nThe introduction of 3D acceleration\n\nAfter the first 3D game, the demand for more realistic and visually captivating 3D games surged, and game developers encountered significant technical hurdles that needed to be overcome.\n\nThe breakthrough that revolutionized the industry arrived with the introduction of dedicated 3D graphics accelerators, most notably the 3dfx Voodoo Graphics card, which made its debut in 1996.\n\nThese dedicated graphics cards were specifically designed to handle the computationally intensive tasks associated with rendering 3D graphics, relieving the burden of the computer’s central processing unit (CPU).\n\nThis innovation proved to be a game-changer, enabling smoother frame rates and more complex environments, and ultimately unlocking the potential for visually stunning games.\n\nBefore the advent of dedicated 3D graphics accelerators, the rendering of 3D graphics heavily relied on the CPU, which often struggled to deliver satisfactory performance due to its primary responsibilities of managing overall system operations.\n\nThe introduction of the 3dfx Voodoo Graphics card and similar accelerators revolutionized this landscape by offloading the demanding graphics processing tasks to a specialized hardware component.\n\nThis allowed the CPU to focus on other crucial aspects of the game, resulting in improved performance, faster frame rates, and the ability to render more visually intricate and detailed environments.\n\nGames like Tomb Raider and Quake, released in 1996, took full advantage of these advancements to deliver stunningly realistic 3D environments.\n\nThe 3D graphics accelerator not only enhanced the visual quality of the game but also enabled more intricate level design, complex lighting effects, and smooth character animations, all of which contributed to a more immersive and captivating gameplay experience.\n\nThe success of Tomb Raider and Quake, among other games of that era, demonstrated the tremendous potential of dedicated 3D graphics accelerators in pushing the boundaries of visual realism and immersive gameplay.\n\nThis resulted in a rapid evolution of graphics hardware, with subsequent generations of graphics cards introducing even more advanced features, such as hardware transform and lighting, antialiasing, and improved texture filtering.\n\nThe modern era of 3D gaming\n\nThe turn of the millennium marked the dawn of a new era for 3D gaming, characterized by refined graphics, diverse gameplay experiences, and powerful hardware.
