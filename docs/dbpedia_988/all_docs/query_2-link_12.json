You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nWe continue our journey through the history of video game graphics. Today we enter the 1980s. A time when games become visually more colorful and gameplay more complex. When the famous mustachioed carpenter/plumber (who, by the way, never worked a day in his profession) appeared. And when more \"personal\" adventures began to appear.\n\nTHE WHOLE POINT OF SPRITES\n\nDuring these years, games began to use sprites - standard two-dimensional images. Sprites were, for example, Pac-Man and his ghost enemies, Mario, the fighters in Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, and so on.\n\nIt wasn't that easy to create a sprite. Nowadays we can draw such an object easily, but in the 80's we had to go through several difficult steps. For example, images for Super Mario Bros. were first drawn on celluloid, colored and then digitized.\n\nOver the years, the sprites became richer visually. This was achieved through the release of new consoles. 16-bit consoles could display up to 512 colors, twice as much as 8-bit consoles. However, due to technical limitations of the same SNES, only 64 colors could be seen on the screen at a time. There were also some innovative methods. For example, Mortal Kombat used digitized footage of real people shot against a green or blue background.\n\nCLASSIC 8 BITS\n\nBut we've skipped over something. Let's start with the basics - namely 1981 and Donkey Kong. It's considered the first platformer game (although Space Panic was released earlier, in which you could climb ladders, but without jumping). By the way, in it the main character's name was not Mario, but just Jumpman. The action of the game took place on one screen, without scrolling vertically or horizontally, which greatly constrained the genre.\n\nAlthough there were already side-scroller platformers in those years. For example, Jump Bug (1981), Quest for Tires (1983) or Pac-Land (1984) - the latter used parallax scrolling.\n\nBut the real breakthrough was, of course, Super Mario Bros. released in 1985 on the Family Computer, aka Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nThe console was renamed and redesigned for the American market. First, the expression \"family entertainment\" in the U.S. had ambiguous connotations; second, the colorful look of the Japanese console did not conform to the visual presentation of the \"miracle of technology\" Americans.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. took side-scrolling platformers to a new level. There was an elaborate level design, memorable enemies, bosses, and secret passages. Of course, the scrolling was only horizontal, but that was all you could ask for at the time. Later significant games in this sense were Mega Man and Metroid.\n\nTWICE THE COLOR\n\nThe 16-bit era brought us expanded color palettes, increased the scale of levels and more detailed sprites. It's enough to put the third and fourth parts of Final Fantasy next to each other, for example, to see what a graphical advancement has taken place in a few years.\n\nBut progress wasn't just measured in terms of sheer numbers. There were some cool innovations that allowed games to provide a whole new experience.\n\nThe Sega Mega Drive, for example, had an interesting feature compared to its main competitor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was able to process information faster because its Yamaha YM7101 VDP GPU had a faster DMA controller and higher memory bandwidth. Even the term Blast Processing was born in this context. True, it could not be explained exactly by Sega itself. The project to which this killer feature allowed to stand out and become a cult, you all know very well - Sonic the Hedgehog.\n\nAnother interesting technology was \"Mode 7\" in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It allows you to create a simulation of 3D images by manipulating 2D objects. More simply, developers could scale and/or rotate the picture at a certain point in the game to create interesting visual effects. The most popular was the perspective effect, which added a three-dimensional feel to the space.\n\nIn addition, Nintendo figured out how to add a special chip to the game cartridge that increased graphics processing power. This made it possible to release such a game as Super Mario RPG.\n\nInformation taken from the websites:\n\nnetology.ru\n\nredbull.com\n\nthelogocreative.medium.com\n\nyoutube.com"
