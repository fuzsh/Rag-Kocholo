        "text": "If anything, my comments were meant to be silly, in fact playing on the stereotypes rather than endorsing them. Nothing derogatory was said or implied. My apologies for allowing my feathers to be ruffled, if you weren't addressing me... but just the same, part of the larger problem is that kind of hypersensitivity, to exaggerate harmless banter and paint it as the worst kind of hate speech, when it's nothing of the sort. If we want peace, it's our first responsibility not to jump into battle in response to the slightest uncomfortable situation. We -- all of us -- need thicker skin or our fate is eternal bickering.\n\nOne of the great things this site affords us is the freedom to categorize words in any variety of ways. Even, perhaps, offensive ways. Though I would argue that nothing on this page could reasonably be described as such, let alone hate, homophobia, or discrimination. You needn't be so hasty to throw those words around. They're much better saved for those who deserve them. Let's not condemn one another so quickly, OK? This is certainly not the place to be throwing stones.\n\nI actually do, in all seriousness, have a deep love of ballet, and ballerino is my new favorite word. Can't believe none of you guys wordied it earlier.\n\nAnd speaking of speaking, I'm planning on rolling out a new 'talk' feature soon, so there's a place to discuss things in addition to the threads attached to comments and lists. Any ideas on how that would best work are welcome -- or if you think conversation is best left attached to the words, let me know that, too.\n\nIf we weren't all monitoring the \"recent comments\" list (I assume that's how the rest of you do it) who would imagine all this on the sprite page? There are all kinds of great funny -- and serious -- discussions in the randomest of places on the site, and I think that will increasingly lend itself to more exploration, the fun of discovery. In enough time from now, a future user could theoretically search for any word and find a huge array of cool stuff attached to it, left by us, his or her predecessors. Hopefully still around and active at that point too, of course. I think the site as a whole could become known as a repository for intriguing discussions for a whole dictionary's worth of words.\n\nIf the Talk section doesn't take us away from building up that collection, it would be great. If it becomes just another web forum while these pages stagnate, perhaps I wouldn't be so much in favor of it.\n\nSecondly, I agree with uselessness--the conversations now are attached (sometimes very loosely) to certain words or to lists, which is often hard to follow if you're not on the site constantly to monitor the recent comments (that's how I've been doing it too). But it does mean that the words and the lists are central, and the messages are tangential. Opening up a message board would make the words and lists tangential, and I, too, would be opposed to that. But if there were a way to maybe track messages from certain folks or messages on certain lists (a way less clunky than an RSS feed for each one), that would be awesome.\n\nThanks again for the great site. I'm loving it. Perhaps too much. Hopefully I won't get fired...\n\nAbraxas, for what it's worth, some people truly do believe in turning around words with negative connotations in a way that allows them to \"own\" the word. It's one way to survive when you feel maligned. You may not think it's effective or appropriate, but those people who scrawled those words on the sidewalk at your college believed it was. I don't appreciate that kind of language myself and I don't generally use it--and I'm not even sure that I agree with the idea--but it's their belief that it works somehow.\n\nAs for posting a \"gay words\" list--why the hell not? Take a look at a few of the other lists on this site. It doesn't have to be derogatory. There IS a cultural difference, in my opinion. Just as with every ethnic or social group, or within certain occupations, members often use certain words and phrases within their own groups that they might not use in other situations. So someone ran a search for a gay list--is that a problem? (I'm not trying to be smart here--just asking.)\n\nWhen I first signed on to this site and was browsing, I recall reading a discussion about a particularly offensive list and whether it should be taken down (see John's reference). The agreement was to let it stand, for the precise reason uselessness mentions--so members have the freedom to categorize words in whatever way they choose. That's why I stayed (that, and the fact that this site is truly addictive). I hope that doesn't change.\n\nJohn, I agree with chained_bear and uselessness regarding the addition of a talk feature. Sounds like a great idea, as long as it doesn't detract from the sheer and delightful serendipity of coming across discussions under word or list pages where you least expect them. And thank you for adding yet another obsession to my life. ;-)\n\nAn even more difficult question is, who gets to determine what words should be allowed and what words shouldn't? If, for example, people don't like to see swear words, then I'm a big offender, because fuck (and all its glorious variants) is one of my favorite words in any language. What is to prevent someone from putting forth the argument that fuck should be disallowed because it may offend some people, or children may be using Wordie, or any other argument in that direction?\n\nThere is an interesting conversation, as someone pointed out, that took place on this site about just this subject (perhaps someone will post a link here as I was unable to find it again). I found the list that was the center of that conversation to be far more disturbing and unpalatable, to me, than anything I've seen on the site since. Yet it was decided to leave the list in place (a decision I applaud). It is up to users to accept this site, and its words--ALL of them--as representative of the community of people who use it. It isn't fair or right to suggest that people cannot use or list words in whatever way they choose. I'm sure there's a line somewhere--as you suggested, a list of denigrating terms for Jewish people might be on that line and might not, who knows. But I don't think this particular conversation, or the suggestion that there are words that taken together remind one of gay culture, is offensive enough that it requires censorship or self-censorship.\n\nEveryone involved on this particular conversation has attested to their community-mindedness and their sorrow that anyone would take offense at what was (to them) a clearly light-hearted conversation. IMHO, that should be enough. Just as a person should be free to ignore a list or debate its value or question the intention with which it was posted--one of the greatest features of this site--so should a person feel free and able to post any words to any list he or she desires. That is, after all, the point of the site. More speech! More speech! :-) Let's keep talking--that's the main point."
