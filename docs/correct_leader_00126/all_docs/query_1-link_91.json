        "text": "From Tunku Abdul Rahman to Najib Abdul Razak, Dr Mahathir Mohamad has something negative to say about every prime minister who has graced this country. I wonder if Mahathir had been at the helm when our country got independence, would Malaya still be called Malaysia or Mahathirasia.\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman\n\nMalaysia’s Father of Independence is undoubtedly the most loved prime minister of the country. While the entire nation heaps hymns of praises for Tunku Abdul Rahman, Mahathir has a completely different take. Recently, Mahathir made the headlines again for saying if the non-Malays were not expelled from Malaysia, why should the Rohingya? Little does he realise if the non-Malays were indeed exiled, Mahathir would be in Kerala, India today.\n\nMahathir repetitively invokes racial sentiments by making bigoted statements. He once said “One should look back and remember that Tunku Abdul Rahman was worse than me, he gave one million citizenships to people who are not qualified and not even tested,” referring to Chinese and Indians. Why does Mahathir despise Tunku so much? It is because Tunku sacked Mahathir from Umno.\n\nAbdul Razak Hussein\n\nMalaysia’s second prime minister played a pivotal role in allowing Mahathir back into Umno. It was Razak who gave Mahathir a second shot in politics. How did Mahathir repay him? Mahathir once insinuated that Razak was the one responsible behind the 1969 racial riots, definitely the darkest period in the history of the nation.\n\nIn fact, the truth is that Tunku Abdul Rahman sacked Mahathir from Umno because Mahathir was alleged to be the brainchild behind the May 13 incident.\n\nHussein Onn\n\nIt was Hussein Onn who gave Mahathir a sniff as the premier of the country by appointing Mahathir as his deputy after becoming the prime minister on the demise of Abdul Razak. Mahathir cunningly allegedly manoeuvred Hussein off the PM’s seat and capsized it himself for two decades.\n\nMahathir allegedly accused Hussein’s wife of running Petronas from home. Mahathir then allegedly mysteriously sent opposition leaders in DAP documents on Exxon allegedly stealing Malaysian oil on the high seas, unknown to Petronas. The then-DAP secretary-general, Lim Kit Siang, later got embroiled on a legal suit in court with Exxon as a result of the allegations.\n\nWhen Hussein went to London on a later date, Mahathir allegedly spread rumours that Hussein had a terrible heart condition and was stepping down as the prime minister on his return to the country. Isn’t it ironic how DAP inadvertently assisted Mahathir becoming the fourth prime minister of the country?\n\nAbdullah Ahmad Badawi\n\nMalaysia’s fifth prime minister was not spared from the spade of Mahathir either. On resuming office from Mahathir in 2003, Abdullah engineered Barisan Nasional to one of its biggest wins ever in the 2004 general election. However, a devastating outcome in the subsequent general elections was used as ammunition for Mahathir to oust Abdullah.\n\nWas it really the results of the election that invoked Mahathir to oust Abdullah? Of course not. Abdullah did not bow down to Mahathir and numerous projects by Mahathir’s cronies were allegedly discontinued and many others were not granted permission. Mahathir even went personal on Abdullah, labelling him “sleepy” and “lazy”.\n\nMohammad Najib Abdul Razak\n\nMahathir is at his best again presently. Waves after waves of attacks are being targeted towards Najib’s administration. So far, Najib seems to be the target of the venom of the 90-year-old Mahathir, who has so far failed in his attempts to oust Najib.\n\nInstead, for the first time Mahathir is being forced to activate his defence mechanism against attacks on him and his family, and he is powerless to get the attackers arrested and thrown in jail as he always did.\n\nWill Mahathir eventually prevail in his quest or gets his legacy trashed to tatters is something only the future will tell. I am definitely hoping for the latter."
