        "text": "GEORGE TOWN, Nov 26 ― Racial harmony was the mainstay of the struggle and administration of Malaysia's first Prime Minister the late Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, said Gua Musang Member of Parliament Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah.\n\nThe Umno veteran said that was why when the country was seeking independence from British colonialists, Tunku Abdul Rahman, then Umno president, formed an alliance with MCA and MIC because he believed that it was only through racial harmony that independence could be obtained.\n\nHe noted that the coalition called the Alliance Party was successful in uniting the major races in the country, namely the Malays, Chinese and Indians.\n\n“Tunku Abdul Rahman stressed that independence could only be achieved through cooperation between the Malays, Chinese and Indians,” he said in his lecture titled “Tunku Abdul Rahman's Vision for Peace and Prosperity” at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) here today.\n\nTengku Razaleigh, who is a former vice-president of Umno, said the coalition later became a dominant entity which fought for independence until it was achieved on August 31, 1957.\n\n“The Alliance Party later became the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition which had ruled democratically to this day,” he said.\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman was Malaysia's prime minister from August 31, 1957 until September 22, 1970. He died on December 6, 1990 at the age of 87.\n\nThe lecture on Tunku Abdul Rahman, considered the Father of Malaysia's Independence, was organised by the Penang State Muhibbah Consultative Council (MPMNPP) with the cooperation of USM, Think City Sdn Bhd and the National Archives, in conjunction with the forum '“Tunku Abdul Rahman's Vision for Peace and Prosperity' at USM.\n\nThe panel members of the forum comprised Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) Chairman Datuk Seri Azman Ujang; Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) chief executive, Wan Saifulruddin Wan Jan and The Sun newspaper columnist R.Nadeswaran.\n\nIt was chaired by USM's Media and Public Relations Centre director, Mohamad Abdullah.\n\nSpeaking to reporters later, Tengku Razaleigh said the time had come for the government to initiate steps to remind the younger generation of important and historical events in the country.\n\nReplying to a question, he said the government should consider setting up a special institute on Tunku Abdul Rahman. ― Bernama"
