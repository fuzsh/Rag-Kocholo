        "text": "Summary\n\nRelations between the United States and what is now the Federation of Malaya go back to the 19th century, when U.S. merchants traded at several Malaysian ports. However, it was not until the 20th century, particularly after Malaysian independence in 1957, that U.S.-Malaysian relations grew beyond this small-scale commerce.\n\nModern Flag of Malaysia\n\nDiplomatic Relations\n\nEstablishment of Diplomatic Relations, .\n\nDiplomatic relations were established on August 31, 1957, when the United States elevated its Consulate General in Kuala Lumpur to the status of Embassy. Then Consul General Thomas K. Wright was placed in charge of the Embassy as Charge dâ€™Affaires.\n\nChange in Accreditation, .\n\nIn 1963, the Federation of Malaya joined with Singapore, Sarawak, and Borneo to form the Federation of Malaysia. Henceforth all U.S. Ambassadors were accredited to the federation of Malaysia, and resident at Kuala Lumpur."
