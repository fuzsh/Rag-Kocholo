Tunku Abdul Rahman was the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, leading the country to independence from 1957 to 1970. He studied law at Cambridge University in England and returned to serve in the civil service of Kedah. Rahman dominated Malaysian politics as leader of the Alliance Party, winning landslide elections in 1959 and 1964. One of his greatest achievements was forming Malaysia in 1963 by uniting the Federation of Malaya with Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. However, Singapore withdrew from Malaysia in 1965. Rahman's power was reduced in 1970 and he resigned as Prime Minister, replaced by Abdul Razak.",
