        "text": "Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR) was officially launched on 13 August 2002 as a not-for-profit private university providing affordable quality education. It is established under the UTAR Education Foundation and registered under the Malaysian Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996.\n\nGuided by its vision to be a global university of educational excellence, UTAR is highly reputed as one of the fastest growing private higher education institutions in the country with phenomenal growth in all aspects of its development since its inception. With the first intake of only 411 students in its Petaling Jaya campus in 2002, the University’s enrolment has now reached 20,000 students with campuses located in Kampar, Perak and Bandar Sungai Long, Selangor.\n\nUTAR has graduated over 86,600 students since its inaugural convocation in 2005 and has made impressive strides in establishing a strong reputation as a comprehensive University with the dedication to achieving excellence in teaching and research. The University currently offers more than 130 academic programmes from Foundation Studies to Bachelor's, Master’s, and PhD degrees in the fields of Accounting, Business and Managerial Science, Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities, Biological and Health Sciences, Computing and Mathematics, Engineering, Technology and Built Environment.\n\nUTAR was founded with a mission to provide quality education to all. To serve a large portion of the populace, the University has two campuses, namely the UTAR Kampar Campus in Perak, and the UTAR Sungai Long Campus in the Klang Valley. The two campuses house 9 faculties, 3 institutes and 4 centres of studies.\n\nUTAR Kampar Campus (Perak)\n\nThe Kampar Campus in the state of Perak is conveniently located off the North-South Highway, a 190-kilometres or 2-hour drive from Kuala Lumpur. Known as a former tin mining town, Kampar is a district within Perak's Kinta Valley, which is historically rich with tin reserves. Today, Kampar is a bustling education hub following the establishment of the Kampar Campus.\n\nThe award-winning Kampar Campus is flanked by picturesque mountains and scenic lakes, offering a naturally peaceful environment that is conducive for learning teaching and research.\n\nSungai Long Campus (Selangor)\n\nThe Sungai Long Campus located in Bandar Sungai Long, a main township in Kajang, Selangor, is a state-of-the-art, purpose-built campus. Its location within the Bandar Sungai Long residential township near Kuala Lumpur city provides the best of both worlds. It offers the tranquil learning environment of a suburban setting and the conveniences of a big city such as plentiful housing, affordable eateries, banking facilities and diverse entertainment.\n\nTo complement its teaching, learning and research experience, the campus is equipped with a library, laboratories, computers and medical equipment."
