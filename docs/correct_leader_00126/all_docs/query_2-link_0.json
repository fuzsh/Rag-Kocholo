        "text": "Tuanku Abdul Rahman\n\nMalaysian leader\n\nTuanku Abdul Rahman (born August 24, 1895, Sri Menanti, Malaya [now Malaysia]—died April 1, 1960, Kuala Lumpur) was the first supreme chief of state of the Federation of Malaya. After the declaration of independence from Great Britain in 1957, the tuanku became the first head of state, or paramount ruler, elected by and from the Malay rulers for a five-year term. Abdul Rahman died before completion of his term.\n\nThe son of Tuanku Mohammed, ruler of the state of Negri Sembilan, Abdul Rahman in 1925 accompanied his father to England, where he remained to study law; he was called to the bar from the Inner Temple in 1928. After returning to Malaya, he held a variety of posts in the civil service. On the death of his father in 1933, he succeeded to the throne of Negri Sembilan.\n\nAbdul Rahman was a retiring and kindly man who learned from his father a deep respect for constitutional law and a sympathy for his people. (He should not be confused with Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was independent Malaya’s first prime minister.)\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
