        "text": "The Round Table Conference in London which was held in January 1956 was when the Malaya Alliance delegation led by Tunku Abdul Rahman and the British government agreed that Malaya will gain her independence.\n\nUpon Tunku’s return from London, on Feb 20, 1956, he made a public announcement at Padang Merdeka, Bandar Hilir, Melaka, in front of more than 100,000 people that Malaya would achieve her independence on Aug 31, 1957. That was 66 years ago.\n\nAt my current age of 81, I can still remember vividly these two historic events which took place on Aug 30-31, 1957. I was a 15-year-old student at the Sultan Ibrahim Girls’ School, Johor Baru. My father had been\n\ntransferred from Johor Baru to Kuala Lumpur in July 1957 to assume the position of District Officer, Kuala Lumpur, just a month before the Merdeka celebrations.\n\nAs I was sitting for my Lower Certificate Education (LCE) that year, he left me behind in Johor Baru to stay with his sister Mak Chah but as August was a school holiday month, I came up to Kuala Lumpur to be with my family.\n\nBy the time my father arrived in Kuala Lumpur, preparations for the historic day were almost completed. His office was at the State Secretariat building and right smack in front of the Selangor Club padang (now known as Dataran Merdeka) and central Kuala Lumpur, was all dressed up with colourful flags lining the streets.\n\nOn Aug 30, 1957, I persuaded my father to take me along to the Selangor Club padang to witness the start of the Merdeka celebrations. I have always been fascinated with history, even at a young age, and I was adamant to be part of this historic event. My other siblings were too young then, and my mother was pregnant with my youngest brother, Kam.\n\nI knew about Merdeka as we had a great teacher, Miss Ting Wen Lian, who meticulously explained to us all about Merdeka – and how we were then under the colonial yoke and would be free from the shackles of colonial rule once we achieved our independence.\n\nIt was certainly a night to remember. My father made sure I stood at a vantage point, making me feel so important and privileged to be amongst the tens of thousands of people at the Selangor Club padang.\n\nA moment before midnight, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Datuk Abdul Razak (Tun), Tan Cheng Lok (Tun) and V. T. Sambanthan (Tun) representing Umno, MCA and MIC, took their places on a raised dais facing two flag poles, one of which bore the Union Jack flag and the other, the new flag of the Federation of Malaya.\n\nWhen the clock at the tower of the Secretariat building struck 12, the Union Jack was slowly lowered. At the same time, on the other pole, the flag of the Federation of Malays was hoisted. I remembered that Miss Ting had informed us that the Federation of Malaya flag was designed by Mohamad Hamzah, who was then the Technical Assistant in the Public Works Department in Johor Baru.\n\nIn a voice choked with emotion, Tunku Abdul Rahman said, “At the stroke of midnight, a new year is born – a nation that will stand forthwith free and independent.”\n\nThe crowd shouted at the top of their voices: “Merdeka! Merdeka! Merdeka!” I too shouted at the top of my voice, Merdeka, three times. There was so much excitement that night.\n\nI felt truly blessed to witness this historic night.\n\nWe returned home late but I woke up very early the next morning as my father said he would take me to the Merdeka Stadium. I was dressed in my favourite frock with a Peter Pan collar which my mother had made and a very comfortable pair of Clark’s shoes and socks.\n\nMy father had also asked me to bring an umbrella in case it rained. On the way, my father informed me that the Merdeka Stadium was specially built for the occasion, The $2.3mil stadium had been officially opened by Tunku Abdul Rahman on the morning of Aug 30 before 50,000 people.\n\nBy the time we arrived at the Merdeka Stadium, it had started to rain. I had to sit by myself as he was busy on duty. By the time the ceremony started, the rain had stopped.\n\nThere was a huge platform at the centre of the stadium. Amongst the VIPs who sat there were the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the ruler of Negri Sembilan, the Sultans, resplendent in colourful brocade royal attire, the Duke of Gloucester, Queen Elizabeth’s representative, Tunku Abdul Rahman and Sir Donald MacGillivray, the out-going High Commissioner.\n\nWitnessed by thousands of people from all walks of life, the Duke of Gloucester formally handed the constitutional documents of the transfer of sovereignty to Tunku Abdul Rahman, who then read the Proclamation of Independence. There was a pause, then he raised his right hand and, in a voice, choked with emotion, cried out very loudly, “Merdeka!” seven times.\n\nHis cry reverberated around the stadium and each cry invoked the crowd’s passionate response, echoing Merdeka! I was overwhelmed and also shouted at the top of my voice, Merdeka! seven times.\n\nIn crescendo, drumrolls ensued and with the wave of the conductor’s baton, the sound of the national anthem filled the stadium and the flag of independent Malaya was slowly raised. As the flag reached the masthead, came the crash of the first shot of a 101-gun salute.\n\nI was elated! That moment will forever be etched in my memory."
