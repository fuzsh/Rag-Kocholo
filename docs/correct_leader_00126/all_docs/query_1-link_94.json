        "text": "If any person wants to know and learn about leadership, he or she must have to learn from Mahathir Mohamad about leadership, how to lead the people, and how to turned into the rich country from a poor agricultural economy. He is known as the Father of Modernization for Malaysia. In this respect, dynamic reforms which have taken place in the context of whole Malaysia owe much to the leadership of Mahathir Mohamad. His leadership ability led the community to grow from lower level to upper level and the achievement unparalleled neither by any contemporary leader nor at the present time. He is a true patriot and a multi-talented leader where he was able to achieve a breakthrough in a short period of time. The purpose of this writing is to know about the leadership qualities of Mahathir Mohamad, achievements, and effective ruling ideas which turned Malaysia into a rich and developed country. This paper has written based on the analysis of literature review of some previous works about Mahathir Mohamad and Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia experienced the first change of government since its independence in 1957 when the Barisan Nasional (BN) was defeated by the Pakatan Harapan (PH, “Alliance of Hope”) coalition on May 9, 2018. The twist to the plot is that the PH victory was led by Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamad, who previously had served as prime minister for twenty-two years as a member of the BN. At ninety-three years old Mahathir broke his allegiance with the BN and the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) - the major component party of the BN – to join hands with opposition leaders who were once his arch enemies. For insight on this political change and the challenges that the PH government faces, Abdillah Noh sat down for an interview with Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar, who served in government roles for more than thirty years, including stints as Law, Foreign Affairs, and Home Minister. Like Dr Mahathir, Tan Sri Syed Hamid Albar, along with other senior UMNO and BN leaders such as Rafidah Aziz,[1] Daim Zainu...\n\nGenerally, this paper discusses Malaysia’s nation building process that includes the changing of national understanding from Sultanate perspective towards democratic nation. In 1957, Malaya achieved its independence. Ethnic Malays through United Malays National Organization (UMNO), ethnic Chinese through Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and ethnic Indian through Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) are the major political parties, which at that time maintained separate identities, based on ethnicity. However, they had to compromise and unify for independence. This paper will also touch on the factors, which influenced the process of nation building, especially internal and external factors. The role of several important leaders, especially former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, their policies and actions to develop and establish Malaysia’s nation building process, is discussed. Keywords: Nation Building; Leadership;\n\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was born in a remote village in Gopalganj of the then East Bengal in 1920. His personality grew during childhood life through active participation in so many socio-economic and political activities. He used to take initiative and lead various kinds of political, social, religious and cultural functions. All common qualities of leadership were present in his charismatic personality. The genuine leaders don’t think about particular people, areas or groups. They think about the entire world and the entire human being. We find the same thing in the thought of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This research paper is divided into these parts: (1) Introduction, (2) Leadership and Personality of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, (3) The Quest for an Independent Bangladesh, (4) Formation of a Nation’s Identity, (5) War of Liberation, (6) Bangabandhu and His Four Comrades; Four National Leaders (7) Conclusion.\n\nis regarded as a \"liberation emblem.\" He was a one-of-a-kind nationalist leader who freed the people of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) from West Pakistan's oppression. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has played a pivotal role in the Bangladeshi independence movement. He has been dubbed \"Father of the Nation\" due to his dominating role and presence. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is the most towering figure in Bangladeshi politics has been explained, claimed, and counterclaimed by political parties and intellectuals as a secular, a Bengali, and a socialist or a mix of all. As a leader, there is no end to his merits and there is no end to writing about him. There is very little scholastic research on the ideology and political philosophy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, so the Primary object of this Research Paper is to identify and clarify the concept regarding the philosophy and ideology of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman which reflects the guiding principles of The Constitution of the People 's Republic of Bangladesh.\n\nThis paper explores the significant lessons from Mahathir's domestic and foreign policy pursuit for the developing states and their leaders. From 1979, every mention of Malaysia's multi-faceted development would remain synonymous with Mahathir. The two can hardly be historically separated for they have so much bearings on each other, especially in terms of transformation and development of Mahathir's personal philosophy, political statecraft, thoughts, and ideals for development, and Malaysia's development and excelling not only among rivals and contemporaries, but before the so-called advanced nations and states. The paper is conceptual and used secondary sources of historical method of data collection and analysis. The paper is significant at this material time when many developing states and nations/leaders have lost the commitment, philosophy, practical statecraft, and inspiration, political maxims, and consistent and sustained principles for development which Mahathir embodies, preaches and practices, and has taken Malaysia where it is today with pride, dignity, development, prosperity and stability on both domestic and foreign scenes.\n\nThis chapter will analyse the case of Malaysia. It will demonstrate an understanding of its development trajectory in terms of oscillations between goals of GDP growth and redistribution, in order to maintain both. Split into four sections, each analyses the contemporary development path through exposition of key strategies and policies of the state. It will show that rising ethnic tensions since its independence in 1957 led to a focus on redistribution to ethnic Malays through a series of positive-discrimination polices combined with state-driven industrialisation. After recession in 1985, this turned towards increasing liberalisation to reignite GDP growth, and then back to a redistributive emphasis in the context of the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. The chapter finishes with a final section that analyses current development policy in the context of recent trends, not least the global financial crisis."
