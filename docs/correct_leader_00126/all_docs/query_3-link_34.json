        "text": "Tun Haji Abdul Razak bin Hussein (born March 11, 1922, Pekan, Pahang state, Federated Malay States [now Malaysia]—died Jan. 14, 1976, London, Eng.) was the prime minister, foreign minister, and defense minister of Malaysia from 1970 to 1976.\n\nA lawyer by training, Abdul Razak joined the civil service in 1950, entered politics in 1955, and was a key figure in gaining his country’s independence from Britain in 1957. As deputy prime minister and defense minister (1957–70) and as minister of rural development (1959–69) under Tunku Abdul Rahman, first prime minister of independent Malaya (Malaysia from 1963), Abdul Razak was largely responsible for the country’s progress in rural and national development. Appointed head of the National Operations Council set up with emergency powers in 1969, he steered the country through that year’s violent disturbances between Malays and Chinese. As prime minister from 1970, he pursued a policy of nonalignment, in furtherance of which he established relations with mainland China in 1974.\n\nIn 1959 he was awarded the Seri Maharaja Mangku Negara, one of Malaya’s (and Malaysia’s) highest honours, which carries the title of tun."
