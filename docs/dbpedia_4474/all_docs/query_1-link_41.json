        "text": "As we grow older, we gain wisdom but often struggle with the loss of physical and cognitive abilities. The arts keep us vibrant by providing physical and mental stimulation, entertainment, and avenues for social interaction and connection.\n\nTen thousand people turn 65 each day, and the fastest-growing age group in the United States is women 85 years of age and older. By 2050, the U.S. population over 65 will more than double, to 86.7 million people, and the global average lifespan is expected to extend by 10 more years. This increase in an aging population will weigh heavily on the already-stressed social services and medical sectors, as well as on the caregivers of these older adults.\n\nGetting older can be both a joy and a challenge. It’s a new time of celebration, freedom (for many) from daily work, the opportunity to learn new skills, explore new places, and enjoy life. It can also be a time of periods of loneliness, declining health, and the grappling with the end of life. The arts are there for all of it.\n\nArts participation can improve health, decrease depression and loneliness, and increase participation in other kinds of activities. It also has been shown to decrease anxiety, which affects cognitive performance and decision-making, and lower the risk of dementia. Using the arts to engage with aging effectively provides life-long learning, increases social engagement, decreases loneliness and isolation, and improves frail health and memory loss at home or in care facilities.\n\nAgriculture and food sustain and enhance life, but aren’t equally accessible to everyone. The arts encourage healthy habits, empower access, and spur innovation to make more healthy food more possible.\n\nThe line between the arts, culinary arts, food, and agriculture can be blurry at times—a sign of how much creativity sits at the center of how, when, and where we produce, prepare, and consume the food that sustains us. Movements like Slow Food, Creative Agriculture, and ongoing efforts to tackle and dismantle food deserts and increase food equity all benefit from the infusion of arts, culture, and creativity.\n\nThe web of growers, packagers, preparers, and consumers that exists in American communities today are linked together. Food—its display and cooking—can be an artist's statement, and artists over centuries have used food to comment on politics, economy, and society. Even the way crops are set up and the care with which plants are raised not only for taste, but for beauty, and the specific connections that come when we enjoy a common meal all speak of the centrality of creativity in the enterprise.\n\nThe arts build awareness of our world by helping us visualize our relationship to the plants, animals, and other human beings that make our lives possible—and the food web is no exception.\n\nThere are many types of art: theater, music, visual art, media art, literature, dance, opera, craft, and more. Regardless of the type, the arts transform people and communities every day.\n\nWhile the arts have the potential to strongly integrate into many other aspects of a community, the truth is they also have a power all their own. Whether you're talking about singing in the shower, dancing in the club, or composing award-winning poetry, the hum of creativity infuses many of the activities we each do every day.\n\nMillions of people in the United States receive income from their art-making, and millions more attend an arts event each year. At the same time, companies can boost their business with creativity and outperform their peers in revenue growth.\n\nConsidering art means considering our history, our heritage, our politics, the way we learn—in short, the arts are part of everything, and play a role in all aspects of the human experience.\n\nCivic dialogue is when communities discuss issues, policies, and challenges in people’s lives, communities, and society. The arts are a powerful facilitator for positive dialogue and engagement.\n\nWhen individual and collective actions identify and address issues of public concern, we’ve entered into a civic dialogue. As engaged citizens, we volunteer in areas of need, work with others to solve a problem, or interact with our government institutions. As engaged citizens, we develop the knowledge, skills, values, and motivation to make a difference in the civic life of our communities.\n\nCommunities in which residents socialize with and trust each other have higher livability scores than communities with lower social trust, and the arts are a driver in building that trust. In addition, cultural participation leads to wider community participation and to increased volunteerism and increased tolerance—all of which are key to civic engagement. It also increases involvement in local issues and projects that promote community health.\n\nThe role of the arts in civic processes manifests in many different directions, but focuses on the power of the arts to bridge gaps in understanding, offer new and innovative ways of thinking about challenges, and to catalyze change. The arts provide a focal point for dialogue, spark individuals to action, and reduce barriers to participation.\n\nThe cohesion of a community is what binds residents to each other and to their locality. Community cohesion is vital in creating a common vision for a collective future. When differences arise or cohesion weakens, the arts help bring people together.\n\nA community is at its best when it feels coherent, collaborative, and safe. Social tensions created by an influx of new people, economics, environment, or any number of factors can disturb citizens’ sense of self and stress the threads that bind them. Arts participation contributes to social cohesion by reducing isolation, encouraging cooperation, and building community networks.\n\nInvolvement in the arts helps build individual identity, as well as group solidarity. Arts participation helps to resolve conflicts and increase tolerance and cross-cultural understanding by bringing together people from different backgrounds and providing opportunities to recognize the contribution of many segments of the community.\n\nArts participation crosses barriers of social class and ethnicity and leads to residents learning about each other and other neighborhoods. People involved in the arts meet more people, and participatory arts projects make marginalized groups more visible and promote positive community connections.\n\nEconomic development seeks to create economic well-being for a community. The arts generate hundreds of billions of dollars in positive economic impact each year.\n\nEconomic development results in economic growth and improved quality of life in our communities. The economic health of our communities—which means the economic health and security of each individual as well as the for-profit and not-for-profit businesses and institutions within that community—is crucial to our collective success, happiness, and progress. Creative and artistic solutions are central to building inclusive creative economies that provide opportunity for all people to reach their individual potential.\n\nThe creative economy is an economic ecosystem of for-profit and not-for-profit creative industries, artists and arts workforce, culture-bearers, educators, entrepreneurs, vendors, policy makers, funders and other stakeholders that work together to produce and distribute creativity- and arts and culture-based goods and services. Economic activity driven through the creative economy depends on individuals and organizations using their creativity to drive jobs, revenue, community resources, and cultural engagement.\n\nArts and culture accounts for 4.4% of the nation’s economy ($1.02 trillion). Globally, the U.S. is a major exporter of arts and cultural commodities. The arts are a proven economic accelerator that increase both arts and non-arts jobs alike. They fuel equitable economic development and vitality at the national, state and local levels and increase a community’s competitiveness to attract tourists and an innovative creative economy workforce.\n\nEconomic arguments have been the backbone of much of the arts advocacy and policy progress this country’s arts and culture sector has made over the past several decades. While just one slice of the total community pie, the economic health and vitality of a community is something that is prioritized by most decision-makers and the general public. Demonstrating that artistic and cultural creativity as a human-based, primary driving force towards impact, empowerment, and economic and social justice in lives across the country is critically important to the sector’s funding success.\n\nThe sustainability and fragility of our environment—the world that surrounds us and everything we rely on to survive—is crucial. Whether as a way of advocating, innovating, or educating, the arts are playing a crucial role in raising awareness and driving change.\n\nEnvironmental issues like climate change, conservation, and sea-level rise are important issues that have grabbed the public attention, but the difficulty in mustering the political will to implement necessary changes continues to hamper environmental efforts. Moreover, the concepts and details behind issues like climate change can make it hard for people to understand or activate.\n\nFor decades, artists have been at the forefront, using their work to inspire and educate the public to change their behaviors to be more sustainable, whether through writing, photography, community engagement, performance, or innovative partnerships with scientists and environmental advocates.\n\nThe arts have been shown to amplify the uptake of pro-environmental messaging and to improve the clarity and impact of the message. Visually representing complex concepts can help people better understand problem and how they can help. The arts also positively connect and empower people, inspiring advocates and documenting change.\n\nThe pursuit of equity and diversity is about improving conditions and addressing systems to create equal justice and opportunity for everyone. The arts have always been central to such movements, and always will.\n\nThe diversity of America is its greatest strength. Arts and culture embody, reflect and communicate intersectional lives, including beliefs, values, spirituality, identities, and traditions that are passed down from generation to generation, and that continue to evolve in individuals and communities. Arts and culture can play a significant role in promoting equity by fostering inclusivity, diversity, and representation, as well as addressing social, economic, educational and cultural disparities, through their ability to amplify diverse voices, facilitate access and participation, address disparities, foster community, create opportunities, preserve culture, advocate for change, and inspire future generations.\n\nThe persistence of historic and oppressive systems disadvantages women, immigrants, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, disabled people, and other marginalized groups. Arts and culture are powerful tools that can impact public opinion and open the door to legislative change. Art has the power to comment on and critique social injustices, inequalities, and systemic issues. Artists often use their work to shed light on pressing societal problems, raising awareness and encouraging dialogue and activism.\n\nArts and culture provide a platform for underrepresented voices and communities to share their stories and perspectives, challenge stereotypes, and broaden the public’s understanding of different cultures, identities, and experiences. Research suggests exposure to arts and media featuring characters or cultures representing these groups can help reduce and eventually eliminate racist, sexist, heterosexist, ableist, and other negative views. When we read literary fiction, we are more able to understand others’ mental states—which is to say, we increase our ability to empathize.\n\nArts and culture events can bring communities together, fostering a sense of belonging and social cohesion, where people from different backgrounds can connect, build new relationships, and create a shared sense of identity. The arts can help preserve and celebrate the cultural heritage of marginalized communities by ensuring that artistic expression, traditions, languages, and histories are not lost and are passed on to future generations.\n\nThe arts can provide equitable economic opportunities for individuals and communities from diverse backgrounds by creating jobs, supporting small businesses, and driving tourism and local economies. More than 75 percent of communities with new local arts organizations have seen reductions in their levels of income disparity. The arts improve intercultural understanding, promote civic dialogue, and create a common ground for celebrating diversity and pursuing equity.\n\nThe traditions, history, and heritage that link us to our past and to each other are simultaneously crucial to our well-being and often ignored. Art strengthens the bridge to our past and carries traditions forward into the future.\n\nArts, history, tradition, and heritage intersect in all sorts of important and surprising ways. The collective memory of a community resonates inside each member of that community, and if that connection to history is weakened then the ability to participate fully in the community’s present and future is weakened as well. Whether culture is the core of heritage, or is the mechanism through which heritage and tradition are preserved and transformed over time, art is central to cultural health and heritage.\n\nArts and crafts provide economic independence for artisans in underdeveloped communities, improve educational outcomes for children, and contribute a significant amount to the economy in the form of cultural heritage-related tourism.\n\nThousands of cultural heritage organizations work to preserve and promote cultural heritage and identity every year. Artists help pull and transform traditional stories from communities, reconnecting members of the community in new and interesting ways. By making cultural history more accessible, we can break down preconceptions and bind our communities together.\n\nThere is not a more basic need than housing and the shelter, care, and security that it provides. The arts are a powerful tool to help advocate for housing needs, innovate for new housing models, and drive conversations to build homes in communities that thrive.\n\nSafe and affordable housing is a basic need that affects our health, access to education, and our access to security both financial and physical. Without it we can’t thrive, and whether you’re an artist or someone else in a community, the struggle to find housing that allows for the stability needed to be successful can be difficult and draining.\n\nArtists play a critical role in the vibrancy and vitality of their neighborhood, community, and city. Neighborhoods where artists cluster often become cultural hubs, increasing the value of the surrounding neighborhood. Artmaking can provide innovative and unique ways of raising the profile of housing issues in a community and can be helpful in efforts to balance “gentrification” with “regeneration.”\n\nActivism around housing, as well as the planning, financial distribution, and communications needs of nonprofit organizations, local governments, and developers have all found solutions in arts-based interventions.\n\nImmigration—the permanent migration of a person or community—can be a disorienting and challenging. The arts’ ability to preserve heritage and tradition and to encourage communication across barriers can ease the journey.\n\nEach new wave of immigrants to the United States brings new perspectives, traditions, and art, which add to the evolving cultural tapestry of America. The unique, complex amount of immigration and integration that American communities constantly go through can place cultures in conflict—but arts and culture is also one of the best ways to create a new harmony.\n\nImmigrants contribute greatly to the artistic and creative experiences that benefits all Americans from all backgrounds. However, immigrants—particularly first-generation immigrants—often choose not to participate in formal mainstream arts and culture activities, favoring participatory arts activities (e.g., amateur choruses, poetry writing circles, hip hop groups, etc.) that tend to be more informal and often connected to their cultural heritage. Immigrants, and particularly their children, tend to adopt the cultural behaviors of their U.S.-born neighbors over time.\n\nThe longer an immigrant stays in the United States, the more their arts participation resembles that of the U.S.-born population. The arts also bring immigrant communities together, and act as a bridge to connect to mainstream American culture. Immigrant artists are more likely to operate within the informal arts sector.\n\nThe basic physical and organizational structures that allow society to operate--broadly termed our infrastructure--encompass everything from buildings and roads to complex social systems. The arts has a role to play in all of those aspects.\n\nThe intersection of the arts and infrastructure accrues economic and social impacts through arts infrastructure, such as performing arts centers and public art pieces as well as through the use of arts and culture to improve overall infrastructure in communities.\n\nMore recently, artists have begun to collaborate with government officials and businesses on infrastructure planning efforts to improve community engagement, increase equity in planning, and design innovative, unintrusive, and environmentally-friendly buildings.\n\nInfrastructure is all around us, and the arts play a vital role in making that infrastructure as impactful and equitable as possible.\n\nLearning doesn’t stop just because school does—at our best, humans are endlessly curious and constantly learning. The arts provide a gateway to an endless supply of new ideas for exploration.\n\nThe arts make every phase of life better and more fulfilling. Learning through the arts has proven benefits for participants at all stages of life.\n\nChildren, teens, adults, and seniors all gain from participation, and the whole community is positively impacted when arts participation rises. In addition to personal benefits to everyone from the very young to the elderly, the development of fuller and more empathetic perspectives on other cultures, other viewpoints, and the civic identity moves communities toward health, vibrancy, and equity.\n\nIn early childhood, the arts can boost IQ and get kids school-ready. As young people move toward adolescence, participating in arts programs shows significant improvement in conflict resolution, future orientation, critical response, and career readiness. Arts participation also correlates with higher rates of tolerance and lower rates of juvenile delinquency and truancy. For older adults, arts participation also leads to better physical and mental health, higher morale, lower risk of dementia, and better quality of life.\n\nLivability is the sum of factors that affect a community’s quality of life—the environment, economy, social stability, education, and culture. In that mix, can you imagine a community without the arts?\n\nCommunity livability is composed of economic, architectural, and cultural factors, as well as intangibles like community resilience and levels of citizen engagement. Indicators of livability including things like the capacity for homeownership, the average length of residency, the percentage of housing units that are occupied, voting rates, crime rate, and various measures of economic health and vitality.\n\nThe presence of arts organizations, along with opportunities to participate in artmaking, help improve livability immediately. Creative placemaking projects, especially those that involve residents in planning and design, affect livability indicators long term.\n\nFor example, participation in cultural activities leads to wider community participation and a greater propensity to volunteer, and creative placemaking projects positively affect residents’ feelings about their neighborhoods.\n\nMembers of our armed forces sacrifice for us, and in turn we must ease their burdens, celebrate their bravery, and nurture their continued health. The arts promote healing helping us serve our nation’s military personnel, veterans, and their families.\n\nThe arts are essential for the health and well-being of our active duty service members, Veterans, their families and caregivers across the military continuum. The arts promote readiness and resilience from pre-deployment to deployment, and provide viable employment opportunities and marketable skills for reentry and reintegration into the civilian workforce after military service.\n\nWhile there are many examples of the arts and the military coming together for entertainment purposes like the USO, the integration of the arts can address the physical and mental well-being and recovery of military personnel.\n\nCreative arts therapies are proven to increase the recovery rates of service members with physical, mental, and moral injuries. Arts and military based activities in communities facilitate the difficult transition from military to civilian life for veterans, their families and caregivers, providing socialization, and fostering positive meaningful relationships that bridge the military/civilian divide.\n\nThe planning and directing of a community’s growth, engagement, and development requires ingenuity, broad communication, and the sharing of a common vision.\n\nThe arts are proven to inspire and to bridge differences to make more things possible. The arts can provide creative tools to help planning and urban design professionals engage with communities affected by their projects. Using storytelling, visual arts, and technology tools, community members can play a significant role in designing safe, beautiful, and useful spaces that reflect community needs and desires.\n\nCollaborative planning toward a common goal helps communities develop a sense of social cohesion. Design processes that engage the community create ownership among residents. There is a significant correlation between how attached people feel to the place they live and GDP growth. And arts districts help retain vernacular culture, helping to arrest the homogenization that makes cities less livable.\n\nAll in all, integrating the arts into the planning of our spaces and places can make them more human, more accessible, and more innovative over time.\n\nAn enlightened, politically activated citizenry is essential to the functioning of our country. The arts inspire such activation, increase involvement, and drive higher rates of voting.\n\nProtestors and political activists come to their rallies and marches armed with banners and signs, often displaying creative slogans to give visuals to their cause. When political activism intersects with the arts, it finds expression for the passions of those seeking justice and social change.\n\nWe’ve seen such cohesion between the arts and social justice in people who have risen to fight for the rights of immigrants, responsible gun legislation, LGBT rights, civil rights, and more. There has never been a political movement that did not converge around a core set of imagery meant to articulate core values, nor a political movement that has succeeded that did not use the vehicles of arts and culture to amplify and clarify the goals and messages of the movement.\n\nArt-goers in general are far more likely to vote, and those who work in the arts even more so. In addition, people who engaged in participatory arts felt differently about their rights afterward, with more wanting to continue to engage in local community projects. Furthermore, research shows that the right imagery can transform a person’s stance more quickly and more completely than text alone.\n\nIncarceration is intended to punish individuals for violating criminal laws, but with an estimated 2.4 million people in U.S. prisons on any given day, the art may provide ways to reduce these numbers.\n\nThe United States has 5 percent of the world's population but 25 percent of its prisoners. As we struggle to overcome the many problem associated with this reality, the arts have not only become a proven way to discuss these issues and break down barriers that divide us to find solutions, but they have also become a tool for driving successful rehabilitation programs which reduce the number of return offenders to the prison system.\n\nArts programs in prisons offer inmates opportunities for self-expression and self-reflection and teach valuable social and emotional life skills. Arts participation lowers racial tension and decreases disciplinary problems and recidivism.\n\nAdult and juvenile offenders who participate in arts programs are more motivated to participate in other kinds of rehabilitation programs and more likely to report positive interactions with others.\n\nIn a time when prison populations are growing and the number of repeat offenders is at an all-time high, solutions offered by art programs in prisons could be a major factor in turning the tide.\n\nOne of our number one concerns as Americans is our safety and the safety of our families and communities. The arts inspire community pride and mutual trust, provide alternative activities, and help make places healthier and safer.\n\nPublic welfare addresses the stability and financial viability of families and individuals and the support services in place for them. Arts and culture can help meet public safety goals by improving neighborhood livability and reducing violence and criminal activity. The arts also provide a pathway for communities to articulate needs and organize for change.\n\nNeighborhood arts projects help to build community trust and cohesion and also make it more likely that residents will participate in the community in other ways. People feel safer in communities with art and have more community pride.\n\nArts participation correlates with lower rates of juvenile delinquency and truancy, and cultural resources are linked to better health, schooling, and security. Arts also help maintain racial and economic diversity and lower rates of racial harassment.\n\nThe way we practice religion or maintain our spiritual health within a community or as individuals is deeply personal. This history of art, spirituality, and religion are deeply intertwined, and throughout this long history the arts have been a resilient instrument fortifying religious practices.\n\nThe intersection of the arts and religion is as old as spiritual practice itself. All art forms have served as teaching tools, instruments for praise and worship, and revelatory mechanisms. For centuries, religious institutions have also been primary funding partners of art making, and have played central roles in informal or personal practice, including choirs, fabric arts, writing, and social dancing.\n\nThe perceived liberal/conservative challenges of this moment run counter to a long and fruitful history of collaboration. Artifice continues to sit at the center of most faith traditions, and the creation of awe and wonder continue to drive a lot of art.\n\nInvolving arts in religious practice increases attendance, deepens spiritual understanding, and promotes tolerance. Moreover, the pairing of religion and the arts is a powerful way to provide a “third space” for youth and promote pro-social behavior.\n\nArts and technology have always had a symbiotic relationship. Enhancing technological development with principles from creative and design processes drives innovation, and in turn new technologies are adapted and transformed by artists to create new art forms that challenge our world views and provide new ways of interacting with art.\n\nCreativity generates new ideas and approaches while innovation implements them. Because the arts are so firmly rooted in creative expression, they have an immense possible impact on technology and innovation, as well as on the economy. Creative industries that use and expand new technology generate billions of dollars each year. Technologists and artists often collaborate on projects that create new tools and technologies, while inventing entirely new artistic media.\n\nTechnology is also inspiring artists as they find new means of expression through technology, and has democratized the process of creating. From digital art to kinetic pieces, and works that tap into the internet, artists are creating provocative new and interactive art forms. The proliferation of technology into the hands of every individual carrying a smart phone has also begun to reshape the definition of the artist. As the disciplines of art and technology continue to grow in tandem and fuse, they will jointly produce the innovations of tomorrow.\n\nTourism—whether state-to-state or international—is both an economic driver and an engine for increased understanding and empathy between different communities. Arts and culture destinations are key factors in determining where people choose to travel.\n\nTourism is a business that contributes economically and socially to our communities, and cultural tourism is even better business. According to the Americans for the Arts’ Arts & Economic Prosperity 5 study, arts and culture travelers stay longer and spend more than other travelers, resulting in a strong economic impact for the communities with arts and culture offerings.\n\nIn addition, cultural tourism—whether you’re heading to the next town over or halfway around the world—inspires connection, empathy, and a renewed appreciation for the ways of others. Communities understand the role that arts and culture have in strengthening tourism, regional identity, and person-to-person connection. Increasingly, municipal governments have allocated local hotel/motel taxes to the arts, encouraging growth and continued investment.\n\nThe arts are the fourth largest driver of tourism and influence decisions made when planning travel. Experiences can include brick-and-mortar establishments (e.g., museums and theaters) along with transitory events (e.g., festivals and community projects). They appeal not only to domestic audiences but also to foreign ones, with a significant number traveling specifically to experience new cultures.\n\nThe integrity and ease of our transportation systems, services, and roads is crucial to how we function in today’s world. Underlying these systems—helping plan them, making them safer, ensuring they’re integrated into communities—is, you guessed it, the arts.\n\nSince the launch of the first collaborative transportation systems, artists have been commissioned to beautify the spaces, places, and vehicles that comprise these systems with murals, mosaics, writing, and other artwork. And the integration of creativity, whether through architectural design, artifice, interior design, or placemaking, has been core in every major design movement in U.S. history.\n\nMore recently, artists have begun to collaborate with government officials and businesses on transportation planning efforts to improve safety, access to roads and transit systems, deeper engagement with future transportation decisions, and environmentally-friendly solutions to community transit challenges.\n\nThe integration of the arts into both the planning process and the physical components of existing transit systems improves the user experience, increases feelings of safety and well-being, creates more community cohesion, and can educate users on the environmental and social implications of different transit projects and options.\n\nWorkforce development is our collective responsibility—to provide training and support that produces exceptional and well-equipped workers who in turn secure our economic strength. The arts help create well-rounded workers who drive innovation, foster participation, and excel at communicating in an ever-changing and swifter business environment.\n\nWorkforce development is any training or support program that aims to produce outstanding and well-prepared workers. Combining the arts with workforce development programs helps create well-rounded workers who not only have “hard,” technical skills in their field, but also have creative thinking skills that foster innovation and drive our global economy.\n\nWorkforce development grows economic stability and prosperity by focusing on the skills of the individuals who make our economic engine run. Successful programs focus either on the needs of the people or those of the sector. Building robust growth and health in available jobs can involve finding and developing opportunities, training and supporting individuals, and expanding and enriching individuals’ outlook through other areas like arts and culture.\n\nProviding a comprehensive education for our children, both in and outside of school, improves our country. Studies repeatedly show the positive effects on students when the arts are part of a well-rounded education.\n\nThe arts have intersected with education strongly and inextricably for all of human history. Each of the art disciplines (music, visual art, theater, dance and media arts ) can carry forward a civilization's history, teach lessons, and celebrate our individual and collective heritage.\n\nIn more recent history, starting with early advocates like John Dewey, both formal and informal education in the United States have demonstrated imagination, better test scores, more civic engagement, public savings, increased lifelong earning potential, better community cohesion, and more. Arts and youth development also extends beyond the classroom to the domain of what is now called Creative Youth Development, which means the longstanding theory of practice that integrates creative skill-building, inquiry, and expression with positive youth development principles, fueling young people’s imaginations and building critical learning and life skills.\n\nThe rich and well-documented links between the arts and education, both formal and informal, create a robust case for supporting pro-arts education funding and pro-arts education policy in every community"
