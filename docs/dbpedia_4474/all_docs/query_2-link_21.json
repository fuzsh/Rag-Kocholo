        "text": "Throughout his life, Isamu Noguchi thought deeply about memory and memorials. In fact, he devised fifteen memorial designs, five of which were completed prior to his death on December 30, 1988.\n\nConsidering himself a citizen of “Spaceship Earth,” Noguchi’s universal worldview was exemplified in his memorial making, perhaps evidenced nowhere more clearly than through his concept for the immense Sculpture to Be Seen From Mars (1947).1 His Japanese American identity, and the evolving conflicts he felt therein, also came out through his multifarious memorial projects: while he designed a memorial to Benjamin Franklin—and effectively, American ingenuity—in 1933 (it would be completed more than fifty years later, in 1985), as well as another that same year to the American plow, an innovation attributed to Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, he would also put forward, just eighteen years later, a memorial dedicated to the atomic bombing victims of Hiroshima, the deadly result of America’s technological, industrial, and military might. That he was torn between identities, cultures, and societies was his quiet strength as a designer of memorials. Such projects were no doubt a productive way for Noguchi to work through his shifting allegiances and polar perspectives.\n\nWhat made Noguchi special, or even spectacular, as a memorial maker was his aim of capturing something spiritual—a sort of transcendence of space and time through physical abstraction. His memorials were made to be experienced. Between 1950 and 1953, when devising a project dedicated to Gandhi, for example, he sought to create “a living memorial in which many people may participate.”2 Memorials were, for him, democratic acts of un-forgetting.\n\nNoguchi understood how to create ambitious works that were evocative exactly because of their ambiguity. Their power and strength lies in their pairing of abstraction with a certain level of specificity—enough to make clear what’s being memorialized while still allowing for a multitude of meanings, interpretations, and responses. “One does not silently bury the dead building a monument,” Noguchi once wrote.3 He sought to make profound works that deal with “today’s problems” and capture various ideas at once—“aspirations, problems, sufferings.”4\n\nWhile Noguchi was without question singular in his approach to memorials, his creations followed pathbreaking examples by Auguste Rodin, who was commissioned in 1884 to create a monument to the burghers of Calais in France, and Constantin Brancusi, whom Noguchi worked under in Paris for five months in 1927, and who created the towering Endless Column memorial in Târgu Jiu, Romania, completed in 1938 and dedicated to the soldiers who died fighting off the Germans from that town during World War I. Noguchi would evoke Endless Column in several projects, built and unbuilt, including the Memorial to Buddha (1957) and the Challenger Memorial (1985–87). When conceiving his Challenger project, Noguchi also looked to Vladimir Tatlin’s plans for the never-built Monument to the Third International (1919–20) as a reference (the Tatlin monument had long interested him: on a brief trip to Moscow in 1930, Noguchi had tried to find the structure, which he thought had been built, to no avail).5\n\nA ten-mile-long earthwork depicting an abstract human face, Noguchi’s Sculpture to Be Seen From Mars was, as the artist himself once put it, “a requiem for all of us who live with the atomic bomb”27 and alternatively “a flight of the imagination.”28 Prompted by the World War II atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which horrified Noguchi—“he often spoke of his fear of atomic annihilation,” Hayden Herrera writes in Listening to Stone—he began thinking about end-of-mankind scenarios.29 “It was in 1945, wasn’t it, when we dropped the atomic bomb?” Noguchi once reflected. “All of us were concerned about our place on earth, and that it might be rather precarious.”30\n\nFor Noguchi, the monumental work was intended to be “an eternal reminder to the rest of the solar system that the planet earth, seemingly bent on self-destruction, once had its civilizations,” writes Friedman in the Imaginary Landscapes catalogue, hailing it as the artist’s “most impressive memorial to the futility of war.”31 The work, as Friedman points out, was also Noguchi’s way of showing his respect and reverence for ancient and indigenous monumental forms, such as the pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the Andes. “‘Earth sculpture’ is nothing new,” Noguchi said. “It’s just a new name for an old thing.”32\n\nThe earthwork also connected to Noguchi’s ongoing interest in outer space and the cosmos. When the art critic Lucy Lippard asked Noguchi to use a photograph of the project in her 1983 book Overlay, paralleling contemporary art with prehistoric sites and symbols, Noguchi replied, “I recently saw a reproduction of a face which was found in the landscape of Mars taken by the Viking Satellite. I think it would be very appropriate to show this version along with mine. I have written to the Mars Research Laboratory asking for this image and will send it to you if you are interested.”33 The connection of rocks across the universe was not lost on the artist. “Ultimately,” Noguchi told Calvin Tomkins in The New Yorker in 1980, “I like to think that when you get to the furthest point of technology, when you get to outer space, what do you find to bring back? Rocks!”34\n\nAn incredibly moving, visionary concept that, as Friedman notes, in many ways preceded the land art and conceptual art movements that would emerge and flourish in the second half of the twentieth century, Noguchi’s memorial to mankind was intended for “some desert, some unwanted area.”35 It was, as the artist put it, “a sculpture just to be seen from the air so that, when you come to a landing, you will see the sculpture there.”36 That Noguchi was concurrently working on the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial suggests he was balancing both a belief in America’s future technological prospects and an acknowledgment of the bleak potential for mankind to destroy the planet and itself. Sculpture to Be Seen From Mars is today only memorialized in a single photograph of a model Noguchi had formed out of sand.\n\nThroughout his life, Noguchi had a long engagement with India, and had formed many friendships in New York with people from India who had “welcomed me unchanged.” He was also awarded a Bollingen Foundation fellowship to travel to the country in 1949, which furthered his interest. Despite this, Noguchi felt that he was viewed as an outsider in the country. “Entering Asia,” he wrote of the Bollingen trip, “I felt myself becoming an intruder. If I wish to think so, mixed-blood disqualifies additionally beyond the question of race.”\n\nDuring his travels through India that year, Noguchi went to places such as Bombay (“not for me,” he wrote of the city); Madras, where he spent time with the dancer Uday Shankar; Pondicherry, where he visited the ashram of Sri Aurobindo and stayed in the the Antonin Raymond–designed Golconda dormitory (considered by many to be the first modernist building in India); and Tiruvannamalai, where he met the Hindu sage Ramana Maharshi. He also visited ancient monuments, including the Taj Mahal and the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur and Delhi, two of five astronomical observatories built by Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II in the eighteenth century, which he was particularly excited by. For Noguchi, India wasn’t just a connection to his Asian roots, complicated as that was; it was also a place of deep spiritual connection. “The search for India seems to go on and on,” he wrote in his Bollingen papers.40\n\nA year before the Bollingen trip, following the assasination of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948, Noguchi found himself moved to create a memorial to the celebrated nonviolent-resistance leader, citing his own “attachment to the Orient and to what Gandhi’s work stood for.”41 Producing a model he described as “the Outstretched Hand of Humanity,” he sent the proposal to Jawaharlal Nehru, then the prime minister of India and uncle of Noguchi’s one-time love, Nayantara Pandit, or Tara. Around this time, Tara had sent Noguchi a letter, as well, writing of Gandhi’s passing, “There is no way of describing to you the void that his death has created, how unbearably empty life is,” adding, “He was our friend and confidante, the father of the nation in so many ways, the person above all whom we could talk to for advice and guidance no matter what our troubles were.”42 Tara’s grandfather had been close with Gandhi, and Tara herself had even called Gandhi “Bapu,” meaning “father.”43\n\nWhen Noguchi shared the design with Tara, she appreciated it, taking note of its “starkness & austerity.” Unfortunately, the timing for such a memorial was not in Noguchi’s favor, as India was in political turmoil following Gandhi’s killing. She wrote that her uncle Nehru, who could have helped make the memorial happen, was “anti-monument of any kind.”44\n\nNoguchi’s first memorial proposal for Japan following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Bell Tower for Hiroshima, was to be a tall, open structure designed as “a standing thicket of rods from which huge brass bells would be suspended,” writes Martin Friedman in the Imaginary Landscapes catalogue. “Noguchi intended that the bells, activated by the wind, would provide a muted, ghostly reminder of what had transpired.”47 Conceived without a sponsor—Noguchi hoped to find one—the memorial was presented as a model, made of ceramic and wood, in the artist’s exhibition at Mitsukoshi Department Store in Tokyo, his first presentation in Japan. He was never able to find the funding.\n\nThe Bell Tower proposal and the Mitsukoshi exhibition, made using whatever basic materials he had at hand, were conceived “under rushed conditions, in a land barely finding its way out of the debris of war,” Noguchi wrote in the November 1950 issue of Arts & Architecture.48 It was during this time that Noguchi found himself precariously perched between his Japanese and American selves, with the Japanese, “a people who have lost so much,” looking to him for some sort of answers, for a way forward. Writes Noguchi: “I suggested that to be modern did not mean to copy us [Americans] but to be themselves, looking to their own roots for strength and inspiration.”49\n\nMainly consisting of sculptural ceramic works Noguchi made with ceramicists in Japan’s Seto region, the Mitsukoshi exhibition also included a plaster model of the sculpture Mu (1950), which he had labored over at the Industrial Arts Research Institute, on the invitation of industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi.50 Mu would soon be realized in sandstone and installed as part of Shin Banraisha (1951–52), a memorial space dedicated to Noguchi’s father at Keio University in Tokyo. One of the ceramic works in the show, Skin and Bones (1950), featured a cross-stick construction similar to the Bell Tower model and also was not entirely dissimilar in vernacular to A Monument to Heroes.\n\nFollowing the exhibition, as a result of the Bell Tower proposal, Noguchi was asked to propose a project for Peace Memorial Park in Hiroshima. This would lead to the designs of two memorial bridges in the city, adjacent to the park.51\n\nIn February 1952, much to Noguchi’s surprise, the cenotaph job was canceled. Mayor Hamai had sent Noguchi a letter telling him that he had been taken off the project. “Tange was as bewildered as I,” Noguchi wrote to Entneza of the experience. “All he could tell me in the beginning was that it was perhaps because I was an American.” In that same letter, he called it his “one really disagreeable experience in Japan.”74\n\n“Unfortunately,” elaborates Noguchi in his autobiography, “both Tange and Mayor Hamai had neglected to consult with the committee in charge—specifically with Mr. Kishida Hideto, an architect and Tange’s teacher.”75 Was it because he was American? Noguchi wondered. “But, of course, I could understand that, under the circumstances, having an American make the memorial to the dead was a little too much,” Noguchi stated years later.76\n\nIn the aftermath, Tange later recalled, “the press enjoyed making a big issue out of it.”77 One article, published in the newspaper Tokyo Shimbun, attacked Noguchi as a conceited, hubristic foreigner imposing himself on Hiroshima: “In Isamu Noguchi’s blood there is mixed hay which is from overseas … Coming to occupied Japan where Nisei have clout, he spread the idea in the press that he, of all people, was the most suitable person to make the monument for the slogan ‘No More Hiroshima’—thus showing the mixed character of his temperament.”78\n\nConsidering Noguchi’s design “too difficult” for ordinary people to understand, the Peace Memorial Park committee ultimately determined that, because Tange was designing the entire park already, he should also design the cenotaph. “Tange thought the committee’s decision reflected a widening but unspoken sentiment that a memorial for the atomic bomb victims ought to be designed by a Japanese,” Duus writes in The Life of Isamu Noguchi.79 “What I find regrettable,” Noguchi would say in a 1956 magazine interview, “is that in Japan there is an especially deep-rooted problem of political—or maybe boss—favoritism.”80\n\nTange’s final design for the cenotaph loosely references Noguchi’s original—“another version of the haniwa roof” is how Noguchi put it—and still sits on the site today (alongside Peace Memorial Museum, Peace Memorial Hall, and Hiroshima City Auditorium, all designed by Tange).81 Over the decades, the park came to be considered by many critics and historians a modernist beacon—an exemplar of postwar globalism, merging Western modernism and traditional Japanese architecture.\n\nIn 1957, the Indian government sponsored an international competition for a commemorative monument in honor of the 2,500th anniversary of Buddhism, to be built in New Delhi. Then living in Japan, Noguchi was approached by a group of young architects who asked him to join them in a competition entry. Coincidently, in 1955, Noguchi had been queried by Manuel Jimenez of UNESCO about his interest in helping design a Buddha memorial park in Lumbini, Nepal, the birthplace of Buddha, and eventually traveled there to survey the site. “[The Nepalese government is] interested in getting in touch with an architect and garden designer who could take an interest in the project and would seem to prefer somebody who could, because of his background, be akin to Buddhism,” Jimenez wrote.82 Though that project didn’t materialize in the end, Noguchi had kept “the wonderful memory of Nepal in my mind.”83\n\nFor the New Delhi competition, Noguchi and the architects focused on the lotus flower as the main motif. “In the blossom so closely related in significance to the teachings of the Buddha,” Noguchi wrote in the team’s entry application, “we found the theme of recurrent change and rebirth. We came to realize it was not only the birth of Buddhism that we wished to celebrate, but the significance of universal birth and awakening.”84 Universalism was at the heart of Noguchi’s work, and while this project was technically religious in nature, it’s clear that it was a way for Noguchi to address the interconnectedness of all humanity, as well as a celebration of the natural world. Memorials such as this one served as vessels to speak to a higher power and transcend time and culture. In a 1985 interview with Newsweek, clearly extending out of this thinking, Noguchi described his views on religion this way: “I’m not a partisan of any religion, but there was a certain respect that religion promoted. Maybe that’s what we need now, to share an impulse, some common agreement that something is worthwhile other than having just a comfortable house. You can call it religion. You can call it art. It’s the space beyond.”85\n\nSeven years after the death of his friend and former collaborator the architect Louis Kahn, Noguchi began work on a Kahn memorial installation as a gift to the Kahn-designed Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. The resulting Constellation (for Louis Kahn) is a series of four elegantly assembled basalt boulders, placed far apart in a contemplative arrangement on a grassy lawn adjacent to the museum. One stone is upright, another horizontal, and the other two squat, almost square—all in harmonious dialogue with Kahn’s barrel-vaulted building. The project, writes Kenneth Frampton in the catalogue to the 1996 exhibition Play Mountain: Isamu Noguchi + Louis Kahn, “was not without obstacle, for it took Noguchi a number of years to convince the museum to accept the work, and then only as a gift.”89\n\nFor Noguchi, Constellation was meant not only to honor Kahn’s life and their special collaboration, but to also show his great reverence for the architect and the Kimbell building in particular. In a letter to the Kimbell’s director, Edmund P. Pillsbury, Noguchi wrote that the stones were made “in stellar relation to your marvelous space and no other. I am the last one to intrude upon an area that I consider holy with objects that would diminish its unique emptiness.” He added, “The Kimbell Museum is also a work of art and needs to be nurtured. My sculptures were done with this in mind, and are in no way assertions of the self separate from the building.”90\n\nDescribing Constellation as a “Ryoanji-like rock garden,” a reference to the famous Zen temple in Kyoto, Hayden Herrera writes in Listening to Stone that the memorial “was anything but bleak.”91 In the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the art critic David Hickey, who had watched Noguchi, then in his eighties, at work on the installation, noted that the artist was “poised in an almost prayer-like attitude of complete attention—watching the heavy stone, strapped to the crane hook, come floating toward him out of the sky.”92 Noguchi did indeed view the Kimbell as Kahn’s “sacred spot,” the result of “his own kind of meditation,” and so Noguchi was very much channeling that same energy.93\n\nFour decades after he first conceived it, in the last years of his life, Noguchi was still searching for a way to realize his Hiroshima memorial in some form, even thinking that there may be a more appropriate spot for it in the United States—a reminder of the evil of which the country is capable. Beginning in 1981, he would search for a site for his Memorial to the Atomic Dead, but he ultimately never found a place for it.95 Even before that, in a 1973 interview, Noguchi had said of this project in particular, “My best things have never been built.”96 Upon the opening of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum in 1985, the artist devoted an entire permanent gallery installation to his model of the memorial.\n\nIn addition to Play Mountain, the Hiroshima memorial was perhaps one of Noguchi’s greatest unrealized obsessions. Over the decades, clearly wanting to see the project through, Noguchi proposed building it at a dizzyingly long list of locations: in Washington, DC, where he hoped to situate the memorial on the National Mall;97 in New York City, where he suggested it be installed in Riverside Park98 or Central Park,99 or in Long Island City,100 or at the Audubon Research Park in Washington Heights;101 in Los Angeles;102 in Los Alamos, New Mexico, home of the first atomic bomb test and the proposed location of a J. Robert Oppenheimer memorial;103 at Stanford University;104 in Mauna Kea, Hawaii;105 and in Paris.106 In the proposal text for Washington, DC, Noguchi’s supporter Peter Putnam declared that, recreated for this context, the design “takes on new and broade[ne]d meanings. It becomes there a symbol of our shared concern for the moral and material significance of nuclear arms.”107\n\nAccording to Duus, at one point, Noguchi learned that the Peace Memorial Park cenotaph that Tange had designed in Hiroshima needed to be rebuilt and restored due to corrosion, so Noguchi called up Tange and suggested that they install his original design instead. Irritated by the suggestion, Tange wouldn’t speak to Noguchi for some time after that.\n\nLocated in the southwest corner of Miami’s Bayfront Park, Challenger Memorial reaches a height of 100 feet in the form of a tetrahelix. One could easily mistake the spiraling steel, white-painted sculpture, made of thirty-one tetrahedrons, for the work of R. Buckminster Fuller, a longtime friend and creative compatriot of Noguchi’s. But it is indeed by Noguchi, who was inspired by Fuller, as well as, according to Herrera, by Vladimir Tatlin’s unbuilt design for Monument to the Third International (1920).112 A tribute to the seven astronauts who died in the 1986 Challenger space shuttle explosion, it was built to resemble a DNA molecule—Noguchi’s way of suggesting a continuity of nature. At the base is a granite triangle engraved with the names of the astronauts.\n\nOne of Noguchi’s final works, this was his last public monument to be built before his death on December 30, 1988. The memorial was officially unveiled at a ceremony in January 1989. Shoji Sadao, an architect and longtime friend of both Noguchi and Fuller, oversaw the completion of the sculpture, which was part of a larger Bayfront Park plan for which Noguchi was commissioned by the city of Miami in 1978. Despite a slew of bureaucratic obstacles over the decade to come, Noguchi and Sadao saw through about three-quarters of the park plan.\n\nOn the whole, the park was, as Noguchi put it in a 1986 interview, “a prototype or an image of the future world.” Through its design, he sought to somehow capture the fact that Challenger “had that appealing quality of the opening up of science and space and so on. There is an element of heroism and of hope.” But, he clarified, the park wasn’t about progress; rather, it was about existing on the fine line between past, present, and future. “The past is as much a part of the future as anything,” he said. “In fact, we have more knowledge of the future by looking at the past.”113 That was his greatest ability as a memorial maker: to live in the urgent, immediate present, and to also honor the past as a means to look toward the future.\n\nAt a moment in which racist monuments are being torn down, a “commemorative justice” movement is growing, and, as we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic death toll and begin to think about what a tribute to those lost to the virus might look like, Noguchi’s memorials prove incredibly instructive and prescient.114 Throughout the twentieth century, Noguchi sought to create universal reminders, not prescriptive, dictatorial monuments. Eschewing figurative statues, he understood memorialization to be an opportunity for celebrating humanity through approaches that extend across space and time. While his Sculpture to Be Seen From Mars was specifically a monument to mankind, in the end that’s what all of his memorial work was about: a direct engagement with the messy, complicated, often contradictory experience of being human.\n\nSpencer Bailey is the author of In Memory Of: Designing Contemporary Memorials (Phaidon), cofounder of the media company The Slowdown, and cohost of the podcast Time Sensitive.
