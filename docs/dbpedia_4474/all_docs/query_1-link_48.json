        "text": "MCB Camp Lejeune is bound by Highway 24 to the North, Highway 172 to the East, and the Atlantic Ocean to the South. Highway 17 bisects the western portion of the Base. Developed areas of the Base are located centrally along the New River while training functions are located in surrounding wooded areas. For the most part, mature stands of pines denote the outer boundaries of the base, extending a positive image.\n\nMCB Camp Lejeune is divided into a network of Special Districts which are based on unique geographical locations. These Special Districts delineate the character of Camp Lejeune through distinct architectural style, color schemes, and landscaping.\n\nHadnot Point is located in the geographic center of MCB Camp Lejeune and is the architectural and landscape soul of the Installation.\n\nPrimary roads include Holcomb Boulevard and McHugh Boulevard, which traverse Hadnot Point along two perpendicular axes and are heavily used. Julian C. Smith Road (locally known as River Road) parallels McHugh Boulevard but its slower speeds and use as a running route make this a secondary road. Birch Road and Louis Road are also secondary roads, both serving four corners and outer reaches of Hadnot Point.\n\nHadnot Point\n\nHadnot Point contains an extensive Historic District which follows parts of Holcomb and McHugh Boulevards. The consistent Georgian architecture as well as the continued use for command services sets the character and importance of this area.\n\nEXISTING ARCHITECTURE\n\nA common palatte of colors and materials as well as classical elements of the Georgian style are ubiqutous. Combined these features evoke a sense of heirarchy and formality, as well as traditional values.\n\n· Red to red-brown brick\n\n· White base foundations, sill, and lintels\n\n· White door and window trim\n\n· Gray asphalt or standing seam metal roof\n\nBuilding facades are largely symmetrical and entryways embellished. Other common details include:\n\n· Cupolas\n\n· Quions\n\n· Raised concrete foundations\n\n· Molded cornices\n\n· Hipped or gable-on-hip roofs\n\nFrench Creek is located to the south of Hadnot Point and encompasses the land between French Creek and Sneads Ferry Road.\n\nMcHugh Boulevard is the primary route into this district, followed by secondary roads Julian C. Smith Road and Gonzales Boulevard. Sneads Ferry Road borders the east side of the district and is the primary means of getting to Cogdels Creek.\n\nFrench Creek is the least cohesive district in terms of overall theme and architectural styles. Its sporadic development through the 1980s and 1990s resulted in a variety of materials, colors, and forms:\n\n· Red to brown brick\n\n· Stucco and metal panel\n\n· Low slope, hipped, gable, or gable-on-hip roofs\n\nFrench Creek\n\nCourthouse Bay developed both as a training area as well as means of access to the New River and the Atlantic Ocean littoral. It is far removed from main side Camp Lejeune, located 2.5 miles south, toward the mouth of the New River as it meets intracoastal waters. This district is divided into two parts connected by a narrow strip of land.\n\nNC Highway 172 bounds the north edge of Courthouse Bay, which has two primary entrances: Horn Road on the eastern side and Courthouse Road on the western side.\n\nCourthouse Bay\n\nThis district is an artful mix of Georgian-like original structures and contemporary architecture. Materials and colors include:\n\n· Brick, red and red-brown\n\n· White, light gray foundations, sill, and lintels\n\n· White door and window trim, eaves, gutters and downspouts\n\n· Medium gray and dark gray asphalt or standing seam metal roofing\n\nCommon ornamental details:\n\n· Cupolas\n\n· Quions\n\n· Raised concrete foundations\n\n· Water table lines\n\n· Molded cornices\n\n· Monitor and clerestory windows\n\n· Entryway canopies\n\n· Distinctive water tables\n\n· Brick mansonry details\n\nParadise Point, named after a peninsula of land that is formed by a bend in the New River, is comprised of single family housing, community, and other personnel support facilities.\n\nIts primary circulation route is Seth Williams Road, an extension of McHugh Boulevard, which shadows the river’s edge and connects to Brewster Road by means of a roundabout. Stone Street completes the triangle that forms the district.\n\nParadise Point\n\nAlthough there are no historic districts in Paradise Point, there are ample examples of period architecture that make the character of this area clear and distinct. Georgian style buildings, interspersed between single family dwellings, echo the design elements of Hadnot Point. The Officers’ Club, surrounding BOQs, and Marston Pavillion suggest the time honored traditional values of the Marine Corps with the symmetry and rhythm of fenestration, basic solidity of brick masonry and class of white trim and moulding.\n\nMarston Pavilion\n\nLocated adjacent to MCAS New River, Camp Geiger is one of the oldest parts of Camp Lejeune. Originally developed as an actual camp site, it was the temporary home of the first Marine units to be stationed in the area.\n\nCamp Geiger\n\nCamp Geiger is on the north edge of the air station boundary, cradled by the Jacksonville NC 17 Bypass to the north. Entrance is by way of the Air Station via Curtis Road. 'A' Street runs north south along the edge of a gridded street network.\n\nAfter Camp Lejeune headquarters moved to Hadnot Point, Camp Geiger was left relatively unchanged from the 1950s until the 1970s. Today there is a variety of materials and detail, including:\n\n· Red brick and concrete\n\n· Hip, gable, and low slope roofs\n\n· Gray or green asphalt shingles or light gray standing seam metal roofing\n\n· White banding across the facades\n\nAcademic facility with distinctive white banding\n\nMarine Corps Air Station New River is relatively independent from MCB Camp Lejeune, although the two share many missions, training areas, and some services. For the purpose of this study, MCAS New River is included as a Special District.\n\nMCAS New River\n\nNew River is located west of the river and has two entry gates, Curtis Road and Douglass Road, which serve as primary routes into the installation. Several secondary routes cross between, and provide circulation around the air field district.\n\nThe character of New River is contemporary and often utilitarian. Materials and colors consist of:\n\n· Brick, concrete block, stucco and metal panel, typically beiges and white\n\n· Low slope, gable or gable-on-hip roofs\n\n· Green standing seam metal roofing\n\n· Pilaster detail typical on two story structures\n\nPilaster detail on a high bay simulation facility\n\nStone Bay consists of marksmanship training facilities, a reserve training compound, and the US Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) complex.\n\nThis area is located across the New River from Hadnot Point and accessed via Highway 17. The main entrance, Range Road, skirts the MARSOC complex and terminates at the ranges.\n\nStone Bay\n\nThis district is divided into two distinct themes: a historic area after the Georgian style and the MARSOC complex, which has its own contemporary architectural language, loosely based on classical detail. The historic Rifle Range area consists of the following:\n\n· Brick, red and red-brown\n\n· White, light gray foundations, sill, and lintels\n\n· White door and window trim, eaves, gutters and downspouts\n\n· Gable-on-hip roofs\n\n· Medium gray and dark gray asphalt or standing seam metal roofs\n\n· Cupolas\n\n· Raised concrete foundations\n\n· Water table lines\n\n· Molded cornices\n\nTypical architecture in the historic district of Rifle Range\n\nMARSOC consists of the following:\n\n· Single course block foundations\n\n· Recessed friezed detail at cornices\n\n· Standing seam metal hip roofs\n\n· Brick soldier coursing, reveals, and set backs\n\n· Hip roofs\n\nTypical MARSOC facility with brick detail and translucent wall panels\n\nCamp Johnson is located between MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River, and is bordered by the Jacksonville NC 17 Bypass to the north and waters of the New River on three sides.\n\nMontford Road is the entrance to this district and continues south to a peninsula of land known as Montford Point.\n\nCamp Johnson and Montford Point\n\nCamp Johnson experienced a significant time of little to no development after an initial surge in the 1940s. This gap is visible in the character of the historic buildings and the contemporary structures that began arriving in the 1980s. Elements of the historical district include:\n\n· Beige or white facades, usually stucco\n\n· Brick framed windows and doors\n\n· Gray asphalt shingles\n\n· Gable roofs and shed roofs above entries\n\nMuch of Camp Johnson is single story buildings, shaded by tall pines and otherwise unimproved\n\nContemporary architecture is varied, but the predominant materials and colors include:\n\n· Brick, various colors of reds and browns\n\n· Two or three brick colors, split horizontally or vertically across the facade\n\n· Standing seam metal roof of various colors\n\nThis academic facility uses three brick colors\n\nCamp Lejeune Environmental Management Department has identified individual buildings and historic districts that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, as of the year 2008. These are described in detail in a document available from Environmental Management:\n\nHistorical Architectural Evaluations, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Onslow County, North Carolina (Bowers, Dixon, and Jacobe 2008)\n\nHistoric districts are regarded as a cultural resource to be protected and preserved. The buildings and monuments not only reflect a high degree of design, workmanship, and materials, but possess a central importance in defining and maintaining the historic and architectural character of the Base. Designated historic districts on Camp Lejeune include the following:\n\nAssault Amphibian Base (Courthouse Bay) and Camp Geiger Chapel and Entrance Circle\n\nCommand Services/Regimental Area No. 3 (Hadnot Point), Parachute Training, and Naval Hospital/Surgeon’s Row\n\nMontford Point Camp No. 1, 2 and 2A and Stone Bay Rifle Range\n\nAlthough the National Register considers all resources eligible for listing as equal, Camp Lejeune has categorized historic districts and buildings in order to prioritize preservation and guide repairs and other treatment.\n\nThe Environmental Management Department manages changes to historic districts and buildings. Guidelines are available in the following document:\n\nGuidelines for Historic Buildings Management, Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune, Onlsow County, North Carolina (The Louis Berger Group, 2008)\n\nThere are three common architectural styles on Camp Lejeune by which some, not all, buildings may be classified. These are the following:\n\nGeorgian\n\nThe Georgian Style was formed from 1700 to 1800 and is characterized by a formal arrangement of classical details based on a symmetrical façade. Often the entry is emphasized by a pediment or monumental pilasters or columns. Common elements include water table line, pedimented dormers, and quions.\n\nBuilding 15, Hadnot Point\n\nColonial Revival\n\nFormed from 1870 to 1920, the Colonial Revival Style is a combination of Colonial and contemporary elements. Similar in formality to the Georgian style, Colonial Revival facades may exaggerate their individual ornamental elements. A common historical detail among these buildings is the broken pediment above the entryway.\n\nWalsh Hall, Rifle Range\n\nShingle Style\n\nThe Shingle Style dates between 1880 and 1900 and is characterized by a uniform covering of unpainted wood shingles, including roof and façade. Roof lines typically continue to create porch coverings. Windows are usually small and grouped in twos and threes.\n\nGeneral Officers’ beach house, Onslow Beach, is in the Shingle Style\n\nThe visual setting and natural environment of the Carolina coastal plains is one the greatest assets of MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River. The Installation invests in the recreation facilities at Onslow Beach and continues to take great care in preserving the shore.\n\nOnslow Beach\n\nGreater view access to the edges of the New River on MCB Camp Lejeune would further take advantage of this asset.\n\nThe historic districts, closely associated with the growth of the Marine Corps, are another asset which the Base should continue to take advantage of. These districts offer not only good examples of early American architectural styles, but a window into past significant events.\n\nBase Theater at Hadnot Point\n\nWater recreation opportunities at both MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River are assets that the Installations have recognized and are using. Marinas provide access to the river waters and shoreline via piers, boat slips, and basic marina buildings. Investment in upgrading these facilities would further enhance the Installations' enjoyment of the New River.\n\nMarina at MCAS New River\n\nThe primary liabilities of MCB Camp Lejeune are a result of the core industrial functions of the Installation. Although efficiently located along the railroad and central to the cantonment, the Industrial Sub-district shares many of the same view scapes as the ceremonial center of MCB Camp Lejeune. This is not likely to change, but can be controlled through the preservation and renovation of the remaining perimeter surrounding the parade deck.\n\nView of steam plant from across the parade deck\n\nVehicle barriers at MCAS New River are ubiquitous. Although placed for necessary protection or access control of key facilities, these barriers take away from the character of the district and become a memorable negative image of New River. Access control may be provided by other types of devices which have less visual impact, such as high curbs. If anti-ram passive barriers are required, decorative bollards may be installed around existing facilities without great impact on the Installation's architectural character.\n\nVehicle barriers are prevalent on MCAS New River\n\nSimilarly, above ground steam lines obscure building facades and become both a physical and visual barrier to the appearance of MCAS New River and parts of Courthouse Bay. When opportunities arise, steam lines may be routed below grade to free the visual and physical space which they currently occupy.\n\nElevated steam lines obscure building facades\n\nAn overall installation architectural theme sets the framework for guidelines and standards. This theme integrates the goals for the built environment with the broader non-facility goals and objectives of the missions at MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River. Existing settings, buildings and structures were analyzed to determine the factors to provide the framework for the overall theme. (See Appendix A: Summary of Field Work.) This analysis concluded:\n\n· An overall predominant architectural style presently exists at MCB Camp Lejeune, but is weakened by designs which dilute the formal rules of the style.\n\n· Predominant materials, color, and forms do exist at MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River in most districts, but some areas lack cohesion.\n\n· Architectural character and positive visual impressions can be found in many areas of Camp Lejeune and are early American design styles.\n\nIn addition to architecture, other visual aspects of infrastructure elements have been evaluated. This analysis includes:\n\n· The major roadways\n\n· The larger scale landscape elements (trees and other mature vegetation including natural areas)\n\n· Streetscape and site elements\n\n· Signage and graphics\n\n· Existing lighting\n\n· Camp Lejeune environmental setting\n\n3.1.1 DESIGN THEME FRAMEWORK\n\nThe architectural foundation of MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River is based on a surge of construction during the 1940s when designers used Georgian and Colonial Revival styles for command, administrative, and support facilities across much of what is now mainside. Many of these structures are now in historic districts, as they are considered windows into the significant past of the military and the country. They also represent values found in the Marine Corps: solid fundamentals, tradition, order, and an affinity for the country’s roots. Therefore, the design theme for MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River is based on early American design.\n\n3.1.2 INTRODUCTION TO THE MECHANICS OF THE GUIDELINES\n\nThe purpose of these design guidelines is to establish standards for improving MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River’s physical environment. The guidelines provide a framework for the enhancement of the visual setting of the installations through the siting, design, style and color of building and landscape elements for all improvements to the physical environment.\n\nThese guidelines are based on the BEAP goals and objectives, Section 1.7: Overall Project Objectives, and general operations and maintenance considerations. The design guidelines also refer to separate criteria specific to the MCB Camp Lejeune Historic District, and the remainder of the installation, when necessary.\n\nDesign guidelines have been developed for the following:\n\n· Site planning: gates, roadways and access, building siting, parking, pedestrian circulation, plazas and courtyards, common areas/activity nodes/open spaces and parks, service areas, and maintenance and improvements (Common Operational Level or COLs -- See Appendix B)\n\n· Architecture: building design, building entrances, building renovations and additions, historic architecture, and the Building Color Design Guide\n\n· Landscape architecture: focal point devices, memorials and static displays, flagpoles, plant material, signage, paving services, bollards, fencing, utilities\n\nNatural and cultural resources must be maintained, protected, and possibly enhanced. Every designer must be aware of the impact each new project will have on these resources and must design their project to complement or coordinate with the existing environment of the Installation. These resources give the Installations character and aesthetic appeal:\n\n· Historic districts\n\n· Waters edge along New River and tributaries\n\n· Onslow Beach\n\n· Monuments and statues\n\n· Military equipment static displays\n\n· Preservation areas\n\nIncorporate antiterrorism and force protection (AT/FP) design with other design elements so that protection is attractive and unapparent. Elements that occur in site design which can unobtrusively protect the building and its inhabitants include:\n\n· Drainage ditches and bio swales\n\n· Ponds\n\n· Open lawn and ground covers\n\n· Lighting and mass notification systems\n\n· Vehicle circulation\n\nOther AT/FP devices can be incorporated into the site design without creating a fortress appearance:\n\n· Berms and ditches\n\n· Setbacks\n\n· Fences and walls; seat walls\n\n· Bollards and planters\n\nWithin the framework of the AT/FP planning standards, design all modifications and enhancements to existing facilities to be cohesive and compatible with the Installation's character.\n\nBerms and Ditches\n\nBerms and ditches offer an effective means of protection against vehicle-borne threats and have less visual impact than fences and other barriers. Soil berms on the protected side of ditches improve its effectiveness. Refer to UFC 4-022-02 Selection and Application of Vehicle Barriers for more information on ditches and berms.\n\nBerms, when combined with ditches, can be integrated into site design and provide an effective vehicle barrier without detracting from the building design\n\nFences and Walls\n\nFences and walls provide both physical protection and a visual barrier to the building beyond. When an anti-ramming fence is required, use decorative black finished metal pickets to reduce the visual impact. Steel cable reinforcement should be integrated with the fence design such that it’s less visible.\n\nCrash-rated vehicle barrier across service driveway. If this type of barrier is required, it should be tied into a system of barriers which prevent by-pass.\n\nThe cable reinforcing in this fence design is hidden in the three rails and anchored to the ground through the post\n\nThis fence design uses exposed cable reinforcing\n\nAnti-ramming knee walls are an alternative to re-inforced fencing. Knee walls must have minimum dimensions and steel reinforcement to provide adequate protection, but may be veneered with the same materials as the building facade in order to blend into the design. Refer to UFC 4-022-02 Selection and Application of Vehicle Barriers for more information on anti-ram walls.\n\nKnee walls, when properly constructed, serve as a vehicle barrier, but also provide the designer an opportunity to add visual interest to the site\n\nBollards and planters\n\nBollards and planters provide protection from vehicles while still allowing pedestrian traffic to move through. They must be constructed to specific construction standards as well as match the character of the Special District. Planters may be veneered in the same way as knee walls. Bollards designed for anti-ramming are substantial structures, constructed from structural steel pipe, and filled with concrete.\n\nAnti-ram bollard indicating the structure required below grade; bollards shall have a decorative exterior\n\nThe character of these decorative bollards is appropriate for most districts\n\nSustainable planning and design is the practice of implementing strategies for buildings and landscapes that protect the environment, reduce life cycle costs, and improve the quality of living conditions. All of these strategies are compatible with improving the appearance of the Installations. Protection of the environment includes the use of recycled and environmentally friendly materials, managing stormwater through the strategy of low impact development, and limiting the impact of atmospheric emissions.\n\nThe reduction and conservation of energy is particularly important to the Marine Corps. Lower the costs of operation by reducing the use of energy through high performance building systems, employing renewable energy sources, optimizing solar orientation, and reducing the amount of materials and man hours required for maintenance. Optimize living conditions by providing good ventilation, natural task lighting, and avoiding items that emit chemicals.\n\nLEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN\n\nThe U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) developed the LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system to objectively judge a building’s sustainability. Categories by which buildings are rated include:\n\n· Site sustainability\n\n· Water efficiency\n\n· Energy and atmosphere\n\n· Materials and resources\n\n· Indoor environmental quality\n\n· Sustainable design innovation\n\nRefer to the LEED® guidelines and other resources located on the Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG) website (www.wbdg.org/design/sustainable.php).\n\nIn addition to the sustainable site category, many LEED® credits affect the outward appearance of the building and impact the character of the Installation. Sustainable elements of a building should contribute positively to the aesthetic appeal. The next sections clarify these specific details.\n\nLOW IMPACT DESIGN\n\nThe goals of LID are to create a developed site that closely maintains the natural hydrologic functions and conserves the maximum amount of the existing natural resources. The key elements of LID are custom site design, conservation, localized stormwater management, pollution prevention and hydrologic recharge of the local aquifer and/or adjacent wetlands. LID implies reduced reliance upon stormwater features such as catch basins, underground piping and concrete curbs, in favor of more natural features such as swales and infiltration basins. All of these elements work hand in hand to create an LID site design. See Section 3.2.12 Stormwater management and Low impact development.\n\nBiomass filtration basin at MCAS New River\n\nDAYLIGHTING\n\nDaylighting design uses the sun to supplement or replace artificial lighting in interior spaces, even deep within the building. Daylight harvesting reduces energy costs and improves the quality of the work environment. Often this is done with a combination of strategies including large window openings, shading devices, unique building geometries, or glazing located high in a wall or roof. The key to using these strategies at MCB Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River is to incorporate them in the building without compromising the overall design concept and detracting from the district character.\n\nThe following are good examples of daylight design:\n\nRoof monitor with translucent wall panels allows daylight into the atrium of the MARSOC Headquarters.\n\nWall panels are integrated into this façade without detracting from its overall appearance.\n\nRoof monitor allows daylight to entry deep interior spaces in the Courthouse Bay fitness center.\n\nThis maintenance facility in French Creek uses a clerestory window strategy to daylight vehicle bay space.\n\nWindow size and location should be the first strategy employed for day light harvesting. Position window openings above 2'-6\" from the finished floor to maximize available light. Window glazing above 7'-6\" is the most effective in allowing light deep into interior spaces. Thus, a window opening from 2'-6\" to the height of the ceiling will collect the most light for a space. This results in tall window openings on the facade.\n\nThis window height spans from 2'-8\" to 10'-0\" to maximize sun light collection\n\nExterior shading devices may be necessary to reduce the glare from direct sun light on working surfaces while still allowing light to enter the space. These devices greatly affect the building appearance and therefore must be fitting for the Special District, especially if that district uses historical context as a basis for style. While many shading device manufacturers offer modern-looking products, a more traditional look is achievable by designing from off-the-shelf kit of parts using outriggers, fins, and fascia pieces (below).\n\nThese sun shading devices emulate window shutters, a common element of early American architecture, and are congruent with many Special Districts\n\nPHOTOVOLTAICS AND SOLAR HEATING\n\nPhotovoltaics and solar heating use large expanses of panels to collect the Sun’s energy to covert to electrical power or hot water. The decision to use a stand-alone structure or integrate panels with the building (for example, building integrated photovoltaics or BIPV) depends on many factors, but both have an impact on outward appearances. Low slope roofs provide an ideal location for these devices, are usually not visible from the ground, and have been installed on several buildings in the Industrial Sub-district of Hadnot Point. When incorporated onto high sloping roofs or as a stand-alone structure, renewable energy collection devices have a greater impact on the visual character of the district. Arrange panels in such a way that they are logically organized in harmony with the building and district's aesthetics.\n\nThe BIPVs on these roofs are organized harmoniously with the building design\n\nPhotovoltaics arranged as parking shelter perform multiple functions besides energy collection. These structures have a large visual impact on a site, and shall be designed to enhance the style of the building and district.\n\nThis stand-alone photovoltaic structure is consistent with the early American design theme of Hadnot Point\n\nPhotovoltaic array arranged to provide parking shade\n\nRAIN WATER COLLECTION DEVICES\n\nCisterns are large water storage tanks used for rain water collection to be used for a building or site's non-potable water needs, such as flushing fixtures or irrigation. Rain water cisterns may be placed underground, but if not, they are likely to detract from the character of the building and district. Therefore, all above-ground cisterns must be properly screened so they blend in with surrounding architecture. Screen wall must use like-materials as adjacent structures and must comply with anti-terrorism/force protection standards.\n\nThis above ground cistern is obscured from view with a traditional brick screen wall pattern that would be appropriate for most districts\n\nObjectives:\n\nEstablish a hierarchy of welcoming entry Gates consistent with Base security requirements that enhance the identity and image of the MCB, provide visual distinction from the roadway streetscape.\n\nEnhance security functions and clarity of vehicular movement, through well organized site layout and treatment of security shelters, circulation, controlled sight lines, signage and effective site lighting.\n\nDesign Guidelines:\n\nComply with UFC 4-022-01 Security Engineering: Entry Control Facilities/Access Control Points and UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings.\n\nMCB Camp Lejeune entrances shall express a clear hierarchy in their scale and appearance based on prominence and vehicle volume.\n\n· Primary entry is given greater prominence through more substantial scale of roadway, special pavement, perimeter wall and fence detailing, massing of plant materials, lighting, and identity signage.\n\n· Secondary entries maintain the elements and character of the primary entry, but at a reduced scale and extent of detailed treatment.\n\n· Tertiary Entries to residential family housing areas should also be visually distinct from the adjacent roadside, with reduced number and scale of entry elements.\n\n· Closed entrances should be clearly designated as such from Highway 24 and conflicting signage removed.\n\nEntry fencing should be ornamental steel pickets (black) set on low brick faced wall (primary entry) and on concrete curb or mow strip at secondary and tertiary entries for ease of maintenance and consistency of design between entries.\n\nMonument signage should be prominent at entry, without conflicting regulatory or directional signage detracting from integrity or full visibility of the identity sign either along the approaching roadside or within the entry setting. Directional and regulatory signage should be minimized to provide clarity of direction without extraneous clutter and conflicting visual cues.\n\nSignage at MCB Camp Lejeune Main Gate\n\nSpecial paving treatments should be considered at entry gates both upon exiting from the local roadway and at sentry plaza to increase visual demarcation of entry and establish the importance of entry. By varying the extent of special paving the hierarchy of entries and circulation ways are reinforced. All entry gate roadways shall have well defined curbed edges.\n\nPlanting should enhance the dignity of the entry and should be composed of mass planting in scale with the overall space. Existing wooded edges work well to frame the entry space and should be augmented with seasonally interesting understory tree plantings to distinguish entries from typical perimeter edges. Clarity of space is paramount; planting should not be fussy or distracting from operation of entries. Planting should not obscure traffic or pedestrian sightlines at intersections or where surveillance is required.\n\nRoadway, monument signage and architectural lighting at sentry house should reinforce circulation patterns, define edges of entry space, highlight attention to sentry house, and provide adequate lighting for security functions.\n\nProvide security guard shelters, cover and lighting for inspection area per ATFP standards. Security cameras shall be mounted on light poles or building structure to reduce numbers of poles.\n\nObjectives:\n\nEstablish a visually unified and distinctive perimeter of naturalized landscape edge along the public right of way that conveys a positive image of the Base to the surrounding community and instills pride in the Base community.\n\nPreserve the wooded setting boundary buffer between public lands and military base facilities.\n\nDesign Guidelines:\n\nPreserve, maintain, and enhance the mature tree stands at the camp perimeter. Remove diseased and dying materials. Clear deadwood and fallen branches from the outer most 25 feet of wooded edge.\n\nEnhance and diversify existing stands by establishing perimeter planting program including planting of shade tree saplings and understory trees.\n\nProhibit development within the wooded perimeter buffer.\n\nEstablish consistent perimeter roadway treatment including street tree planting, roadway lighting, pedestrian walks, and security fencing\n\nProvide a hierarchy of perimeter fencing (see 3.4.9 Walls and Fences) Maintain open ground plane to fencing and vertical clear zone to 20 feet for horizontal distance of 20 feet on the exterior side of fencing, 10 feet on interior side of fencing. Shrub masses shall be set back 60 from perimeter fence either side to maintain visibility by security patrols.\n\nObjectives:\n\nEstablish a coherent framework of streets and walks that collectively contribute to a positive, unified Base community setting with a coordinated system of pavements, edging, lighting, signage, furnishings and planting.\n\nProvide clear and safe, convenient circulation for motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.\n\nRenew emphasis on visually reducing the scale of the roadways and encouraging pedestrian and bicycle circulation. Roadway cross section design shall give equal consideration to motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians in providing safe travel ways for all functions.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nConform to UFC 3-210-02 Design POV Site Circulation and Parking.\n\nPromote expanded use of roundabouts on Base. Roundabouts express a distinct Base identity and improve traffic flow and intersection safety. Additionally, use of roundabouts reduces long-term operational costs associated with maintaining signalization and related structures and signage. Where employed, roundabouts should be carefully constructed with appropriate lane markings and traffic signs to clarify the intended movement patterns.\n\nPromote expanded use of roundabouts\n\nPriority consideration should be given to replacing signalized intersections at ceremonial locations and roadway focal points and to poorly performing interactions. Smaller scaled roundabouts should be considered for secondary and tertiary road intersections as a means of improving the overall aesthetic of the area and emphasis on non-motorized environment.\n\nIntersection setbacks\n\nMaintain sight lines and pedestrian crosswalks at intersections. Locate driveways and curb cuts a minimum of 50 feet from the intersection. Provide setbacks between roadway edges and building or parking areas at 30 foot (minimum) on primary roadways and 25 foot (minimum) on secondary roadways.\n\nOn street parking will not be permitted on primary or secondary roadways. On street parking will not be permitted on tertiary roadways without review and approval of the BEAP Review Board. In the event the Review Board approves on-street parking for a specific tertiary roadway setting, the following guidelines shall be met: on-street parking will be limited to parallel parking, one side of the road only, applying set back of 30 feet from the corner or 15 feet from the edge of any crosswalk, whichever is greater.\n\nRecommended clearances at streetscape\n\nSigns, hydrants, poles, headwalls, fences, and similar obstructions should be set back from the edge of road and walk/bicycle ways a minimum of two feet.\n\nAs street and pathway trees mature, branches extending over roadway shall be limbed up 12 feet (minimum) and at walks/bicycle ways 10 feet (minimum) from paved travel surface.\n\n3.2.3.1 PRIMARY ROADWAY\n\nPrimary roadways include: Highway 24 (four lane divided highway), Highway 172, and Highway 17, Holcomb Boulevard, Main Service Road (McHugh and Seth Williams Boulevard), Brewster Avenue and Sneads Ferry Road.\n\nPrimary Roadways\n\nNew primary roadways greater than two travel lanes each direction are discouraged.\n\nOn street parking is prohibited.\n\nBicycle travel within the curb line is discouraged and shall be accommodated through off-road multi-use or dedicated bicycle ways.\n\nPrimary Roadway Section\n\nPrimary roadways shall include pedestrian travel way (six foot width minimum) on either side of road. Multiuse pathways (minimum 10 feet width) should be considered in lieu of separate pedestrian and off road bicycle travel ways.\n\nStreet edges shall include a deciduous tree planting strip (six foot width minimum, eight feet or more preferred) at the curb edge. Deciduous shade trees reduce the perceived scale of roadway, slow traffic and create a more welcoming environment for pedestrians through separation from traffic and introduction of shade. Primary road street trees shall be formally aligned with the street and spaced at 40 to 50 feet on center typically, but may be closer in heavily trafficked pedestrian areas as part of a larger landscape plan. Mixed, informal grouping of trees and shrubs shall be provided at the rear side of the walk (eight foot minimum width) either to screen adjacent parking or as part of a larger “greenbelt” planting. Roadway medians ten foot width or greater shall be planted with ornamental and/or columnar tree plantings.\n\nStreet lighting should contribute to streetscape character, hierarchy and consistency in pole/fixture and quality of lighting. Consider using a combined approach of taller street and lower pedestrian level lighting or dual fixture lighting on shared poles in higher density pedestrian/commercial zones.\n\nPrimary roadways shall have reinforced/turfed shoulders and, only where absolutely required for stormwater management, vertical curbed edges/concrete curb and gutter edge.\n\nRoadway signage and billboards shall be limited to reduce visual clutter and establish clarity for safe movement and improved way finding.\n\n3.2.3.2 SECONDARY ROADWAY\n\nProvide one (11 foot width) or two (22 foot width) travel lanes in each direction. If there is no bicycle lane within the curb line, consideration should be given to providing an additional one foot shoulder at each curb edge.\n\nSecondary Roadway Section\n\nOn street parking is prohibited.\n\nThird, center turning lanes should be considered for secondary roadways that include several vehicle entrances for safe maneuver of left turns. Turning radii should consider movement of large tactical vehicles, especially at operational areas.\n\nBicycle travel may be accommodated within the curb line through dedicated bicycle lane (five foot width) adjacent to the curb edge or through separate off-road multi-use (10 foot width) or dedicated bicycle ways.\n\nProvide tree planting strip at the street edge, walks, and mixed planting landscape edge at rear of walk and lighting as in primary roadway section.\n\n3.2.3.3 TERTIARY ROADWAY\n\nProvide one travel lane each direction.\n\nAlternatively, pedestrian and bicycle travel may be accommodated through a combined multi-use pathway. Roadways shall be edged with tree planting strip (six foot width minimum) and planted with shade trees spaced 40 feet on center (maximum). Adjacent landscape –either to rear of walk or contiguous to street tree planting - shall be composed of mixed stands of shade and understory trees as part of “greenbelt” planting.\n\nLighting shall be provided for combined roadway and pedestrian functions in character and scale with reduced roadway width.\n\nOn street parking will not be permitted on tertiary roadways without review and approval of the Architectural Review Board. In the event the Review Board approves on-street parking for a specific tertiary roadway setting, the following guidelines shall be met: on-street parking will be limited to parallel parking, one side of the road only, applying set back of 30 feet from the corner or 15 feet from the edge of any crosswalk, whichever is greater. Parking “bump outs” are encouraged to minimize road width at intersections, reduce extent of impervious pavement and improve pedestrian and vehicle safety.\n\nBicycle travel shall be accommodated within the roadway in “shared” vehicular/bicycle travel lane or through off-road pathways.\n\nPedestrian walkways (six foot width) shall be provided on at least one side of roadway.\n\nTertiary Roadway Section\n\nTertiary Roadway Plan Diagram\n\n3.2.3.4 SERVICE ROADWAY\n\nProvide service roadways and driveways from secondary or tertiary roadways to adjacent parking areas or building service zones as required and allowed by ATFP requirements.\n\nMaximum pavement width shall be 18 feet on typical access routes with intermittent use. Access road layout and related loading dock and service functions shall be designed for efficient movement and to minimize extent of impervious paved surfaces.\n\nAlign service drives to minimize service/ pedestrian crossings and visibility of service functions from public areas. Provide screening from public areas through planting or architectural quality screen walls.\n\nObjectives:\n\nSite buildings in positive physical and functional relationship to each other and surrounding site developments, circulation systems and open space to strengthen community identity and activity.\n\nEstablish clarity in site design, with logical order and sequence of spaces from site arrival to building entry.\n\nRespond to the natural environment by limiting the extent of development-related disturbance, and preserving and enhancing the natural setting.\n\nReduce development related storm water runoff and enhance the stability of natural environment. Increase shade and reduce the need for infrastructure through wise siting and design of buildings and treatment of surroundings including implementation of extensive tree planting program.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nIncrease emphasis on creation of buildings segregated fro parking and site-focused design in response to ATFP requirements, with parking and roadways to the periphery and contiguous pedestrian/ bicycle open spaces and building environments at the core of community settings. Conform to UFC 4-010-01 DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings.\n\nGroup built facilities in positive relationship to each other and adjacent exterior space within contiguous standoff zones to maximize site land use options and preserve the greatest amount of continuous impervious land.\n\nSiting Diagram\n\nOrient building entries onto shared space and connect entries to each other by convenient pedestrian ways. Siting buildings to open onto pedestrian dominated open spaces is encouraged.\n\nPresent inviting and favorable articulated building facades toward adjacent streets and parking, even if not providing an entry at that face due to ATFP requirements. Avoid “fortress-like” appearances or otherwise minimally animated exterior facades.\n\nEstablish visible “entry forecourts” to provide welcoming exterior arrival spaces that lead one from off site to building entries.\n\nProvide pedestrian and bicycle connections between buildings, to adjacent parking areas and to local roadway, pedestrian, and bicycle systems. Minimize conflicts between vehicular and non-vehicular circulation by providing separation and clarity in routes.\n\nProvide convenient service, delivery and emergency access that is visually screened from public areas.\n\nSite buildings in proximal relationship to other facilities to maximize efficiency of shared resources including walks, lighting, utilities and infrastructure, common facilities, roadways, parking, and long term care and maintenance of grounds.\n\nSite buildings for maximum solar orientation benefit, daylighting opportunity, and reduced heating and cooling demand.\n\nWhen determining location of development, protect existing natural resources. Avoid development within 50 feet of a water body, five feet of floodplain, and 100 feet from wetland edge.\n\nWhen planning facilities, give consideration to future expansion of buildings, parking and stormwater management features.\n\n3.2.5 PARKING\n\n3.2.5.1 SURFACE PARKING\n\nObjectives:\n\nProvide attractive, well organized, safe parking areas.\n\nReduce the overall need for surface parking area through efficient design and decreased use of vehicles on Base.\n\nReduce the environmental impact of parking and related amenities such as lighting.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nAll parking areas shall conform to UFC 3-210-02 Design: POV Site Circulation and Parking guidelines. Standard off-street parking layouts, curbing and striping shall be applied Base-wide. Restripe non-conforming areas, and areas with inefficient layouts or unclear circulation to gain stall count and/or reduce lot size. Remove unneeded pavement and create planting beds where removal of “painted islands” allow.\n\nProhibit on-street parking on all primary and secondary roadways. On-street parking on tertiary roadways will not be permitted without review and approval of the BEAP Review Board. In the event the Review Board approves on-street parking for a specific tertiary roadway setting, the following guidelines shall be met: on–street parking shall be limited to parallel parking, one side of the road only, applying set back of 30 feet from corner or 15 feet from edge of crosswalks, whichever is greater. Maintain fire lanes and safe pedestrian crossings.\n\nMaximize parking efficiency and clarity of movement. Utilize standard 90 degree parking layout with two way access aisles.\n\nWhere possible, consolidate parking for multiple facilities so that buildings may be sited in clusters without separation by individual parking areas that may result in increased standoff zones.\n\nReduce visual impact of parking from roadways and adjacent use areas by establishing planting strips (eight foot width minimum) of informal planting of varied heights – shrub, ornamental trees and shade trees. Situate planting islands within the parking area to maximize screening potential and overall shade coverage.\n\nPlant trees to shade parking areas. Provide 15 percent minimum shade coverage measured 10 years after installation of trees. Within the parking limits, provide pervious planting bed equal to or greater than five percent of the total square footage of paving area.\n\nProvide defined curbed edge to all parking perimeters and planting islands. Curbed edge may include regular breaks or notched inlets as part of stormwater management design. If curb is not provided due to stormwater management design requirements, provide pre-cast parking bumpers at all parking stalls and provide edge of pavement line markings to discourage travel at the edge of pavement.\n\nProvide two foot clearance at back of curb (bumper edge) for safety and ease of maintenance. Bollards, signage and other vertical objects shall be placed outside this two foot zone. Plant materials within this area should be 6 inch height maximum.\n\nOpportunities to reduce stormwater management infrastructure demands through Low Impact Design features, including bio swales, infiltration basins and pervious pavement, shall be considered. Pervious pavement shall not be used in tactical vehicle paving areas or along delivery or trash pick-up routes within POV parking lots.\n\nIn order to limit the spread of light to adjacent facilities and restrict upward light spill, all parking area lighting fixtures shall be full-cutoff type. The use of LED lighting fixtures is encouraged.\n\nProvide universal accessible parking spaces and associated pedestrian walks to facilities as required by State and Federal ADA regulation.\n\nProvide designated motorcycle parking spaces 4 ½ feet wide by 12 feet long where need is demonstrated.\n\n3.2.5.2 PARKING GARAGES\n\nObjectives:\n\nProvide attractive, efficient structured parking where demand justifies.\n\nReduce the visual impact of structures on adjacent buildings and outdoor use areas through effective siting, design and landscape treatment of adjacent standoff zone.\n\nReduce the overall demand for surface parking and related impacts including greater land disturbance, increased impervious surface, and heat island effect.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nEstablish “greenbelt” treatment in standoff zone between parking structure and unobstructed space of adjacent facilities. Greenbelt planting shall include mixed tree planting of understory and deciduous shade and/ or evergreen trees.\n\nConsider approaches to grading that reduce the visual impact of structured parking through combining berming and naturalized planting.\n\nInclude pedestrian walkways linking structured parking to adjacent facilities, roadway and existing walk system in the implementation of new parking structures. Include bicycle parking and shower facilities within structured parking facilities and connections to the bicycle route system.\n\nParking garages shall be designed with the same style and characteristics as the Special District or sub-district in which they are built. This is particularly important because parking garages will be large, dominant structures on any site and its character will over-power other small adjacent structures.\n\nAbove illustration shows a three story parking deck appropriate for Hadnot Point, Wallace Creek, or other Special District where the Georgian or Colonial Revival style is called for. The pre-cast stair or elevator tower is used to break up the expanse of the structure.\n\nThe exterior of parking garages shall be level and not express inclined ramps on the façade, in order to blend the structure's appearance with surrounding buildings.\n\nObjectives:\n\nBicycle transportation provides an alternative to vehicular use on Base and results in reduced demand for roadway, parking and utility infrastructure.\n\nProvision of safe, enjoyable bicycle travel ways encourages bicycle use for transportation and recreation.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nMulti-use trails (10 foot width) for use by pedestrians and bicyclists shall be included within all primary streetscape sections. Primary roadway related multi –use trails may run parallel to roadways or more informally with curving alignments. Alignment design should respect nature of safe travel for both pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\nMulti-use trails reintroduce bicycles to traffic at roadway intersections. Intersection and crosswalks design shall consider safety of all users.\n\nContinued implementation of Base-wide multi-use trail and “Greenway” system serving bicyclists, joggers, and pedestrians and linking roadway system, areas of development, and natural areas is encouraged. The Greenway Master Plan allows planned incremental development. All Base projects shall include both pedestrian and bicycle connections to adjacent roadways and facilities.\n\nWithin secondary roadway sections, bicycle travel shall be accommodated within the roadway in dedicated bicycle travel lane (five foot width) or through adjacent off-road multi-use trail if one exists as part of overall trail system. On tertiary roads, bicycles “share” the vehicular travel lane.\n\nAll bicycle ways, whether dedicated bicycle trail, multi-use trail or bicycle roadway lane, shall have minimum two foot clear zone to either side of the travel way without vertical obstruction or abrupt grade drop.\n\nAs trees adjacent to bikeways mature, branches extending over travel way shall be limbed up 10 feet (minimum) from travel surface.\n\nMulti-use trails and dedicated bike lanes intended for use after dark shall be lighted as appropriate for general street conditions with special emphasis on lighting at intersections and road crossings.\n\nBicycle parking shall be provided within 200 feet of the facility with all new non-residential projects at the rate of one space per five percent (minimum) of all building users based at peak regular occupancy. Provide covered bicycle parking at new residential facilities at one space per 15 percent of occupants. Garage parking facilities shall include provision for bicycle storage and showering.\n\nContinue to expand system of multi-use trails\n\nObjectives:\n\nWalking provides an alternative to vehicular use on base and results in reduced demand for roadway, parking and utility infrastructure, conserved resources and reduced vehicle pollution.\n\nProvision of safe, convenient, accessible and well linked, enjoyable pedestrian ways encourages walking as an alternative to driving, improves physical fitness, and supports healthy well functioning Base community development and ATFP driven design.\n\nDesign Guidelines\n\nWalkways shall be designed and implemented to establish a continuous network that is convenient, with direct routes between destinations. Establish pedestrian walkway connections to adjacent facilities, parking and roadway walk and multi-use systems at new and, over time, at existing developments.\n\nProvide amenities including benches, receptacles, planting and lighting.\n\nWalkways width shall be determined by function and scale of importance within setting.\n\n· Troop Movement Walkways: four abreast shall be 10 foot width minimum.\n\n· Major walkways: commonly traveled by two people abreast with frequent use and/or located in proximity to prominent building or open space setting shall be eight foot width minimum.\n\n· Standard walkways: typical walkway use, single person, or two people abreast with lower frequency use shall be six foot width.\n\n· Minor walk: infrequent, limited or local use, low volume shall be 4 foot width.\n\nAll roadways shall be designed with pedestrian walkways included in the cross section. See roadway sections for relationship of walks to roadways.\n\nCrosswalks shall be provided at intersections and shall be 10 foot width minimum. Crosswalks shall be clearly marked by a consistent pattern of paint stripes or by crosswalk paving consistent with walkway paving material and contrasting to roadway paving.\n\nWalkways shall be provided with tree cover.\n\nWalkways shall be planted with formal lines of shade trees to provide 50% shade coverage within 10 years of installation.\n\nAs trees mature, branches shall be limbed up to ensure eight foot minimum clearance between walkway surface and branching. For multi-use trails accommodating bicycles and pedestrians, clearance shall be 10 foot minimum. Trees shall be selected for appropriateness to setting and planted a minimum distance of five feet off walkways and trails, eight to 12 feet preferred as space allows, minimizing long term impact on paving. In tighter planting conditions, consideration should be given to installing root barrier at the walkway edge.\n\nMulti-use trails and dedicated pedestrian walks intended for use after dark shall be lighted with special emphasis on lighting at intersections and vehicular crossings, destinations (building entries) and outdoor gathering spots. Bollard-style lighting is preferred at pedestrian ways as opposed to overhead lighting. Provide handrails and wall-recessed lights at outdoor pedestrian steps, ramps and stairs.\n\nAll pedestrian travel ways shall be universally accessible and in compliance with state and federal regulations, including Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and Americans with Disability Act Accessibility Guide (ADAAG). Building access and general walkways should be designed to avoid use of stairways or grades requiring handrails when possible. When required, ramp access shall be integrated into the overall site/architectural design and shall not be a lesser means of access.\n\nMassing\n\nBuilding mass shall be based on the historical context of Camp Lejeune, primarily the Georgian and Colonial Revival styles. Symmetry in building mass, windows, and roof shall be a large determinant of design.\n\nAllowable roof forms are gable-on-hip and hip at slopes between 4:12 and 6:12.\n\nWindows and Entrances\n\nWindows and entrances shall be designed to match the historic character seen in Georgian and Colonial Revival buildings throughout Camp Lejeune. Window dimensions shall fall within a range of 1:1.6 to 1:2 ratio of width to height, as shown in the diagram below.\n\nWindow heads and sills shall be detailed to avoid a punched opening affect. This can be accomplished with different types of lintels which blend with the historic character, such as precast concrete or stone or jack arch. Sills may be precast concrete (preferred) or special brick shapes.\n\n(Left) Example of window head using soldier coursing; (Right) Example of precast concrete sill\n\nEntry elements for the primary entrance shall be proportional to the building mass. In two story buildings, entry elements shall be greater than half the height of the building. In three and four story buildings, entry elements shall be at least two stories in height. In five story buildings, entry elements shall be at least three stories in height.\n\nEntry elements (shaded) for three and five story buildings\n\nEntrances shall provide some type of weather protection, such as a pocketed door or canopy. Entrances must be formal, clearly identifiable and located toward the most common approach, preferably facing the public way or open space.\n\nBody and Roof Materials\n\nAll facades shall be face brick, modular size. Base foundations shall be architectural concrete block.\n\nRoofing shall be standing seam metal with high standing seams between 12 and 18 inches on center.\n\nColors common\n\nDescription\n\nColor\n\nFacade\n\nBuilding body\n\nScreen walls\n\nred flashed smooth\n\nstandard gray mortar\n\nred flashed wire cut\n\nstandard gray mortar\n\nBase foundation\n\nwhite split face\n\nwhite mortar\n\nMetal Panel\n\nsandstone\n\nBM: OC-48\n\nPANTONE: 400\n\nFED STD: 17875\n\nPainted Surfaces and Factory Finishes\n\nExterior stairs\n\nUtilities/equipment\n\nAppurtenances\n\nslate gray\n\nBM: 2133-40\n\nPANTONE: 444\n\nFED STD: 36173\n\nGutters/downspouts\n\nFascia/soffit/frieze\n\nsandstone\n\nBM: OC-48\n\nPANTONE: 400\n\nFED STD: 17875\n\nbone white\n\nBM: 2140-70\n\nPANTONE: 9041\n\nFED STD: 37875\n\nHandrails\n\nclear anodized aluminum\n\nEntry accents\n\nDoors\n\nWindow/door trim\n\nbone white\n\nBM: 2140-70\n\nPANTONE: 9041\n\nFED STD: 37875\n\nclear anodized aluminum\n\nRoof Cladding\n\nMetal roof\n\nsandstone\n\nBM: OC-48\n\nPANTONE: 400\n\nFED STD: 17875\n\nDetails\n\nCommon District details shall be designed according to the early American architecture that is the prevalent style on Camp Lejeune, which includes elements of Georgian and Colonial Revival.

This is primarily due to their abundance throughout base and the large visual impact BEQs have on a site and district. Often these buildings are four or even five stories and clustered together, making them a predominant feature regardless of location.\n\nCareful massing of BEQs is critical. Forms shall be designed to evoke the early American styles of the installation, as well as be visually rich. The complexity of massing in the diagram below brings the scale of the BEQ to a human level, as well as break up its large silhouette against the site.\n\nThis BEQ design for the west coast exemplifies the blending of the Installation's character and a complex mass of forms.\n\nA similar massing which would be appropriate for Camp Lejeune.\n\nRegarding windows, entrances, and details, BEQs shall adhere to the guidelines of the district in which they are located.\n\nBEQ materials and colors shall be the following:\n\nColors BEQS\n\nDescription\n\nColor\n\nFacade\n\nBuilding body\n\nScreen walls\n\nred flashed wire cut\n\nstandard grey mortar\n\nBuilding body\n\nScreen walls within French Creek\n\nblended sand faced\n\nstandard grey mortar\n\nBase foundation\n\nwhite split face\n\nwhite mortar\n\nPainted Surfaces and Factory Finishes\n\nExterior stairs\n\nUtilities/equipment\n\nAppurtenances\n\nslate gray\n\nBM: 2133-40\n\nPANTONE: 444\n\nFED STD: 36173\n\nGutters/downspouts\n\nFascia/soffit/frieze\n\nMatch roof color\n\nHandrails\n\nclear anodized aluminum\n\nEntry accents\n\nDoors\n\ntaupe\n\nHC-85\n\nPANTONE:\n\nFED STD:\n\nbrick red\n\n2094-20\n\nPANTONE\n\nFED STD\n\ntan\n\nAC-33\n\nPANTONE\n\nFED STD\n\ngray\n\nHC-169\n\nPANTONE\n\nFED STD\n\nWindow/door trim\n\nclear anodized aluminum\n\nRoof Cladding\n\nMetal roof\n\nsandstone\n\nBM: OC-48\n\nPANTONE: 400\n\nFED STD: 17875\n\ntaupe\n\nHC-85\n\nPANTONE:\n\nFED STD:\n\nslate gray\n\nBM: 2133-40\n\nPANTONE: 444\n\nFED STD: 36173\n\nHadnot Point’s Georgian and Colonial Revival style buildings are the dominant architectural precedent for much of Camp Lejeune, particularly for administrative facilities. Therefore, it is important that this area be preserved and future development respect the historic context.\n\nAside from Hadnot Point proper, this district is comprised of two sub-districts and an historic district: the Industrial Area, the Marine Corps Exchange Complex, and the Command Services/Regimental Area No. 3 historic district.

This may include precast concrete shapes, special brick shapes or brick detailing used as lintels and sills of the window opening. Window muntins are not preferred in French Creek except where necessary to support glazing or window operation.\n\n(Left) Window framed by a brick sill and soldier coursing above; (Right) window with pre-cast concrete lintel and sill\n\nThere are many acceptable entry elements for French Creek. The basic requirement is that primary building entrances be recognizable as obvious points of entry to the facility.

The default brick color shall always be the blended sand faced. However, the designer must conduct a site analysis to verify this as the most appropriate choice. Use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the project site and the surrounding significant structures. A rule of thumb: structures within 450 feet of the project site or any structure which has a large visual impact on the project site is significant.\n\n2. Determine the brick colors of the surrounding structures. For the purpose of the study, brick shall be classified as either a brown or a red hue.\n\n3. If the majority of the brick in surrounding significant buildings is a red hue, select the red brick from color chart. Otherwise use the default color.\n\n4. If the project is an addition or replacement within a well-defined group or complex, such as a quad of BEQs, use the brick color associated with the existing structure or structures within the group.\n\nExample: The majority of surrounding significant buildings for the above project site is brown brick. Therefore the appropriate brick color should be brown to match the predominant context.\n\nExample: The above project is completing a group of four BEQs, all of which are red. Therefore, the brick color should be red to complete the group.\n\nDetails\n\nDetails in French Creek primarily revolve around creative use of clay masonry units. Brick details and special brick shapes shall be used to give facades visual interest, to include:\n\n· Common bond\n\n· Soldier coursing\n\n· Rowlock coursing\n\n· Brick reveal\n\n· Cove or bullnose water table\n\nCommon Bond\n\nSoldier and Rowlock coursing, Brick reveal\n\nCombination of details\n\nWhite base foundations are permitted.
