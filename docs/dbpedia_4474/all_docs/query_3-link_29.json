The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m. in room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Mark Udall presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARK UDALL, U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO Senator Udall. The Subcommittee on National Parks will come to order. This afternoon we have a very full agenda of eight bills, including several national memorial proposals. While some of the bills appear to be noncontroversial, a few of the bills do raise issues that will require greater review. Three of the bills on the agenda concern a proposed World War I National Memorial. S. 760, sponsored by Senators McCaskill and Bond, would designate the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, as the National World War I Memorial, as does the House companion measure, H.R. 1849, sponsored by Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, who we will hear from in just a few minutes. We will also be receiving testimony on a different World War I memorial proposal, S. 2097, sponsored by Senators Thune, Webb, Rockefeller, and several others, which would rededicate the District of Columbia War Memorial as a National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial. The other bills on the subcommittee's agenda include S. 1838, Senator Landrieu's bill to establish a commission to commemorate the sesquicentennial--the 150th anniversary of the Civil War; S. 2722, Senator Barrasso's bill to authorize a study of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming, to assess the suitability and feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System; S. 2726, Senator Johnson's bill to modify the boundary of the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in South Dakota; S. 2738, sponsored by Senators Dodd and Grassley, which would authorize establishment of a memorial in the District of Columbia to honor free persons and slaves who fought for independence, liberty, and justice for all during the American Revolution; and H.R. 3689, sponsored by Congressman Rahall, which would extend the legislative authority for construction of the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial visitors center. We do have a lengthy witness list this afternoon. Several of our colleagues have asked to testify, we need to hear the administration's views on all bills, and we have several witnesses testifying on the various proposals. I'm also informed that there are likely to be votes on the Senate floor this afternoon, beginning around 2:45. So that we have enough time to hear from everyone, I would ask everyone to please summarize your statements as much as possible. We will include your written statements and any other materials in the official hearing record. At this point, I'd like to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Burr, for any comments he may have. [The prepared statements of Senators Landrieu, Dodd, Barrasso, and Enzi follow:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Mary L. Landrieu, U.S. Senator From Louisiana, on S. 1838 The American Civil War, fought from 1861-1865, tore the United States apart, and engaged the U.S. in the most deadly struggle that has ever befallen our great Nation. As we approach the War's 150th anniversary, we must remember the contributions of our forefathers, those many Americans who gave their lives to make America what it is now. That is why I introduced the Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission Act of 2009, along with my colleague, Senator Webb, to commemorate this turning point in American history. We all studied the Civil War in school. We know that the opening shots of the Civil War were fired at Fort Sumter, South Carolina in April of 1861 and that Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant agreed to peace at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865. We recognize those most horrific battles-Antietam, Gettysburg, Fredericksburg, and the 10,000 other sites from New Mexico to Vermont that were host to fighting. We celebrate the strength and bravery of individuals such as Frederick Douglas and Harriett Tubman who risked everything to combat the deplorable institution of slavery. And every February, we observe President Lincoln's birthday, a day to recollect his legacy. The Emancipation Proclamation and Gettysburg address are two of the most memorable documents in American history, and it is thanks to President Lincoln that slavery was eradicated. These are the most memorable aspects of the Civil War, but the influence and impact reaches so much further. The American Civil War has reverberated throughout our history. Every aspect of American life was affected whether economic, cultural, political, or otherwise. The most profound consequence of the Civil War was to end the legal edifice that justified the subjugation of people based on accidental characteristics such as race. We must remember what our forefathers sacrificed for us. More than 3 million men fought in the Civil War. They left their homes and their loved ones to fight for their beliefs, their families, their Nation. 620,000 of those soldiers gave their lives. We must remember the untold number of civilians who lost their lives or welfare because the battles were taking place all around them. No State, city, community, or family was untouched by devastation or loss. We must remember the legacies of the Civil War. The United States emerged completely altered after the four years of struggle, and as a testament of American resilience, grew stronger than it was before. The cultural and political ramifications still shape the American landscape today. It was in the era of Reconstruction that Congress adopted the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution, acknowledging black Americans as free and equal citizens of the United States. The Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission Act of 2009 is about preserving the memory. It will establish a Commission to ensure a suitable national observance. Consisting of 25 members from government, business and academia, this commission will develop and carry out programs to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. It will work together with State and local governments, as well as various organizations, to assist with these activities and ensure that remembrance occurs at every level. The year 2011 marks the anniversary of a monumentally tragic time in American history, but also a time of intensive change, growth, and hope. We must use this opportunity to reflect upon the Civil War, the sacrifices, legacies, and changes in our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support quick passage of the Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission Act of 2009. Thank you for your consideration. ______ Prepared Statement of Hon. Christopher J. Dodd, U.S. Senator From Connecticut, on S. 2738 Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing on the National Liberty Memorial Act, a bill I introduced with my colleague Senator Grassley. This important legislation would authorize the construction of a memorial in Washington, D.C. honoring the African American patriots who fought in the Revolutionary War. For too long, the role these brave Americans played in the founding of our nation has been relegated to the dusty back pages of history. Fortunately, historians are now beginning to uncover their forgotten heroism, and they estimate that more than 5,000 slaves and free blacks fought in the Army, Navy, and militia during the Revolutionary War. They served and struggled in major battles from Lexington and Concord to Yorktown, fighting side by side with white soldiers. More than 400 of these brave Americans hailed from my home state of Connecticut. More than twenty years ago, Congress authorized a memorial to black Revolutionary War soldiers and sailors, those who provided civilian assistance, and the many slaves who fled slavery or filed petitions to courts or legislatures for their freedom. Unfortunately, the group originally authorized to raise funds for and build the memorial was unable to conclude its task, and there remains no memorial to the important, and too often unacknowledged, contributions made by these 5,000 Americans. But a group of committed citizens has formed the Liberty Fund DC to complete this memorial and ensure that these patriots receive the tribute they deserve here in our nation's capital. I'm grateful that the Committee has invited Mr. Maurice Barboza to testify to the importance of this memorial today today, and I am honored to work alongside Mr. Barboza and the many others who have made honoring the contributions of these Americans their life's work. The time has come to recognize the sacrifice and the impact of the African Americans who fought for the birth of our country. I urge my colleagues to support the National Liberty Memorial Act. ______ Prepared Statement of Hon. John Barrasso, U.S. Senator From Wyoming, on S. 2722 Thank you for holding this hearing today Mr. Chairman on S.2722, the ``Heart Mountain Relocation Center Study Act.'' This legislation will authorize the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study of the site of Heart Mountain Relocation Center near Powell, Wyoming. The site is an important part of our national history and of the history of our communities in western Wyoming. Between 1942 and 1945, when Japanese American families from the West Coast were forcibly moved to Park County, Wyoming and interned at the site near Heart Mountain. During those years, the Heart Mountain site was the third-largest community in Wyoming, housing nearly 11,000 Japanese Americans. The experience during those years shaped internees and local residents alike. It represents an important chapter in American history. This legislation is a credit to the individuals, local communities and grassroots organizations supporting recognition of the Heart Mountain site. I have submitted eleven separate letters of support for S.2722 to be a part of today's hearing record. I encourage Senators to read the heartfelt comments of Senator Alan Simpson and Secretary Norman Mineta about their experience as children at Heart Mountain. They are accompanied by support from local organizations, including the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation and the Park County Commissioners, along with national organizations, including The Conservation Fund, the Japanese American Citizens League, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Heart Mountain Relocation Center Study Act will help to define this historic site. It will allow us to determine the best way to recognize the site as an important part of our national history. I look forward to working with this Committee to advance consideration of this bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. ______ Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael B. Enzi, U.S. Senator From Wyoming, on S. 2722 Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding a hearing today on S. 2722, the Heart Mountain Relocation Center Study Act of 2009. The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility of adding the Heart Mountain Relocation Center as a unit of the National Park System. Heart Mountain, Wyoming was one of ten relocation centers created during World War II to house Japanese and Japanese-Americans who were forcibly relocated inland from the west coast. The current site contains the most existing structures of any site in the country. To memorialize this history, the Heart Mountain, Wyoming Foundation is working to develop a Learning Center on the site of the Internment Camp. The Foundation is a well-established and credible organization with notable Board and Advisory Board members including former Senator Alan Simpson and former U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta. Senator Simpson and Secretary Mineta first met as Boy Scouts when Senator Simpson's Cody, Wyoming Scout Troop visited Secretary Mineta's troop while he was interned as a young man in the Heart Mountain camp. They developed a bond that would last for decades and eventually served in Congress together. Private and public entities alike strongly believe that Heart Mountain, Wyoming should be preserved for future generations. I, too, believe preservation of one of our country's landmarks from World War II should be saved so our children and grandchildren have another tool to learn about our country's history. There are many ways to preserve this important landmark, and our legislation allows for study of one of those methods. With introduction of S. 2722, we are examining whether the Heart Mountain Relocation Center meets the criteria to be a part of our National Park System. Simply because we introduced this legislation does not guarantee that Heart Mountain will become a part of the National Park System. The bill will allow the Secretary to study that question and to make a recommendation based on the merits of Heart Mountain and how it would fit within the entire National Park System. Heart Mountain Camp internees want to leave a legacy of learning through this Center to future generations such that abridgements of freedoms and lack of ethnic understanding not occur again in this great country. Preserving the land and structures and building the Learning Center will do just that. The Heart Mountain Relocation Center Study Act of 2009 is the next step forward in making their dream a reality. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for considering the merits of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center Study Act of 2009. Senator Barrasso and I look forward to working with you on further advancing this legislation this Congress. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA Senator Burr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We do have a full agenda--and I'll be brief--an agenda that includes 8 bills. I understand that today's hearing is probably the last of this subcommittee this year. Yay. We're glad to be at that point, and I'd like to take this moment to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman Udall of the subcommittee. It's been very productive so far this year, and I know all the members appreciate the leadership in addressing their bills in a timely fashion. Most of the bills before us today involve memorials in Washington, DC, and elsewhere. All these memorials commemorate very important historic events in our Nation's history, but one bill is particularly important to me, S. 2097, which I cosponsored, to rededicate the DC War Memorial as a National and DC World War I Memorial, also known as the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act. We are very honored to have Mr. Buckles here with us today, and I would like to not only thank him for his service to his country, but also for joining us here today in an effort to establish a World War I Memorial for all of our Nation's veterans on our National Mall. Having said that, there's also competing legislation. I think it's important for all members to thoroughly look at both pieces of legislation and to fairly evaluate both proposals that are on the table. I would like to thank all of our witnesses for being here. I yield the floor. Senator Udall. Thank you, Senator Burr. I would also like to acknowledge Mr. Buckles' daughter, Suzanne, is here. I was pleased to learn from her that Mr. Buckles is a big fan of cowboy boots, and I was lucky enough to have my cowboy boots on today. So, I want to associate myself with the fine words of Senator Burr and thank Mr. Buckles for taking the time to be with us. Let me turn to Senator Rockefeller for comments he would have. Senator Rockefeller, the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the ranking member, with whom I serve on the Veterans Committee. This is a very important effort that Senator Thune, Senator Webb, myself, and others are making here, the so-called ``Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act.'' I'm especially proud to introduce Mr. Buckles, and, with the committee's permission, after--I understand the committee will allow him to say a word. His daughter, Suzanne, as you pointed out, is here. She's integral to his life. I've been to his house and walked with awe through his library to see books written in Chinese and German and French and Spanish, all of which he spoke at one time or another, and probably still does. Extraordinarily--not just patriotic but educated and visionary patriot. I think it's really important that we have this memorial. I recognize there are others that have their views, but this is Washington, DC. This would not be the creation of a new mall, it would be the rededication of a mall--of a memorial that Herbert Hoover dedicated for those who served in World War I, but it's never really gone over to the full veteran side of matters, as have--is the case with some others that just honor those who died in World War I. The wounds from World War I were often not very well treated, and--so that Frank Buckles is not here today just to share his remarkable story of valor and his own historic nature, but also as chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation. Washington is the capital of the Nation. It's the center point of the spiritual value. Some could say that Congress doesn't always present all those spiritual values in the most admirable way, but, in terms of our fighting soldiers and our great moments in history and our great patriots, this is the center, and this is where they deserve to be honored. I honestly believe, and strongly believe, that our Nation owes a tremendous debt--more 4.3 million Americans, who, like Frank Buckles, offered to go to service for a period of 4 years. So, I strongly support Senator Thune, Senator Webb's and my proposal to have that firmly established, not just for the dead, but also for the survivors, of whom there is only one, and he's with us in this room. At the conclusion of the other two members' presentation, I would ask--hope that I could ask Mr. Buckles to say a word. I thank the Chair. Senator Udall. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. Let me turn to Senator Thune for his remarks. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a great honor to be able to be here today, in the presence of the lone survivor of that great conflict. I appreciate Senator Rockefeller, who is Mr. Buckles' home-State Senator, taking a lead on this, and Senator Webb, who has combat experience, been a great advocate for those who have served our country. We think that this bill--what it does is, it does something that I think is very fitting, and that is to add a memorial to those veterans of World War I. We have what we call the ``memorial triangle'' on the National Mall today--World War II, Korea, Vietnam. There were, as Senator Rockefeller said, over 4 million Americans who served in World War I; over 100,000 casualties. It really was the first step in America's path to superpower status, something that--there was so much sacrifice that was made by people in this country, although we were only involved in the conflict for about 18 months. So, I think it's fitting that all the great wars of the 20th century have their place on the National Mall, so that the people, when they come here to pay their respects and to honor and pay tribute to those who served in all those great conflicts, to also have the opportunity to honor the veterans of World War I. So, I hope that we can move this legislation. I hope we can move it fairly quickly. I understand the issues with regard to Missouri. I hope that we can work through those. It seems, to me at least, that where--with respect to our National Mall, that we ought to have a place that recognizes the service and sacrifice of our World War veterans--World War I veterans. Particularly honored, as I said, to have the lone survivor, the last man standing from World War I with us here today, in Mr. Frank Buckles. So, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity, and appreciate the chance to have a hearing on this legislation. [The prepared statement of Senator Thune follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John Thune, U.S. Senator From South Dakota, on S. 2097 Chairman Udall, Ranking Member Burr, distinguished colleagues, thank you for the opportunity to discuss S. 2097, the Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act. For far too long, the sacrifices of American World War I veterans have gone unrecognized on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Senator Rockefeller, Senator Webb and I introduced this legislation to provide proper recognition, which is long overdue. The Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act would rededicate the existing District of Columbia War Memorial as the National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The act is named for Frank Buckles of West Virginia, who at 108 years of age is the last surviving American World War I veteran. While the United States was in World War I for only 18 months, the war had profound effects on our nation. Without question, World War I thrust the U.S. onto the world stage. The U.S. lost over 100,000 brave men fighting the war, more than both the Korean War and Vietnam War combined. Today, memorials on our National Mall rightfully honor the men and women who served and sacrificed during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. However, nowhere on the National Mall do we recognize the service and sacrifices of all American World War I veterans--veterans like Frank Buckles. At 108 years old, Frank Buckles is the last surviving American World War I veteran. He joined the Army at the age of 16 and served in Europe during World War I, driving ambulances and motorcycles for a casualty detachment. Mr. Buckles is also the Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation, which is seeking refurbishment of the District of Columbia War Memorial and its establishment as the National World War I Memorial on the National Mall. S. 2097, The Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act will help to make this vision a reality. The District of Columbia War Memorial honors the 499 District of Columbia residents who died in World War I. This legislation would rededicate the District of Columbia memorial as the ``National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial.'' The legislation would also authorize the non-profit World War I Memorial Foundation to make repairs and improvements to the existing memorial, as well as install new sculptures or other commemorations at the memorial to underscore the sacrifice of over 4 million Americans who served in World War I. The bill would not require any taxpayer dollars because the World War I Memorial Foundation would raise the necessary funds through private donations. All of the major wars our nation has fought in the 20th century are memorialized on the National Mall. Rededicating the District of Columbia World War I Memorial as the National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial fits the narrative of the Mall, with its wonderful memorials to World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. I think it only makes sense to rededicate a memorial to this twentieth century war that established our nation's path to superpower status among the community of nations. I can think of no better way to honor Mr. Buckles and his departed comrades than by passing this bill which would provide long overdue recognition of all World War I veterans in our nation's capital. Thank you for holding this hearing today. I look forward to working with this subcommittee and my colleagues to pass this bill. Senator Udall. Thank you, Senator Thune, for those thoughtful remarks and for taking the time to join the subcommittee. Senator Webb. STATEMENT OF HON. JIM WEBB, U.S. SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA Senator Webb. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also, Senator Burr, for your cosponsoring of the measure. I appreciate that-- the timely hearing that you brought forward here. I would like also to express my appreciation to Senator Thune for having originally brought forth this idea. It's a very sensible approach. Actually, My personal view is that we might be able to do something in concert with the other proposal. I recently spoke at the National Civil War Museum. It's in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It would be logical, if they were able to make their case for a World War I Museum, that it might be appropriately located in Missouri, where President Truman hailed from. He was a veteran of World War I. But, in terms of a national memorial to World War I service, I don't think there could be any better place. If I could just ask my staff member to put this--with thanks to Google Earth. This the Mall. To your left would be the Lincoln Memorial; to the right would be the Washington Monument. You can see the--just the natural flow of the wars of the 20th century, if we were to put the--to take this memorial in the right--lower right-hand corner, which is now the District of Columbia War Memorial, not add any more space, and no cost--this is privately funded--then you would have, in the Mall area, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and then, going clockwise, the World War II Memorial, the World War I Memorial, and the Korean War Memorial. I can think of no greater tribute to those who fought the larger wars of the 20th century, to have them located in a way that they can be accessible to those who come and visit our national capital. With that, I again thank the Chair for this timely hearing. I hope we can work out something with the situation in Missouri. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Udall. Senator Rockefeller, let me turn to you, if I might, because the vote has just been called. We have been joined by Congressman Cleaver, and I know we want to hear his testimony, but I think it's very important to hear from Mr. Buckles, so I'd like to recognize you and---- The Chairman. There's no need to introduce Frank Buckles. He's the last man standing, and an extraordinary man, at that. I just think that he should, as chairman of the Foundation-- honorary chairman of the Foundation, have something to say. I appreciate your courtesy on this matter, of course. Senator Udall. Mr. Buckles, the floor is yours. Voice: Papa, you want to--go ahead and tell them what you think. Can you do it? Mr. Buckles. What am I supposed to say? Voice: You're supposed to tell them what you think about having a World War I Memorial on the Mall. Mr. Buckles. Oh. I think it's an excellent idea. I think it was a nice idea to call it a National and--DC. Voice: Thank you, sir. Senator Udall. Thank you, Mr. Buckles. I'm tempted to adjourn the hearing, because the case has been made---- [Laughter.] Senator Udall [continuing]. But I know Senator Bond and Senator McCaskill would want to have their say, as well, as Congressman Cleaver is here to testify. Congressman Cleaver, thank you for making the trip over to the Senate side. It's great to see you. We served together in the House. You'd like to share your testimony with us at this time, and the floor is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER, II, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FROM MISSOURI Mr. Cleaver. Sure. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, it is somewhat uncomfortable testifying in opposition to some folk with whom I agree, about 99 percent of the time. But, I think it may have some importance for me to share with this committee what's going on in Kansas City. I think it is important, also, that, if you have not seen the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, that it's difficult to have a good perspective. Mr. Chairman, before you is a newspaper article--front-page newspaper article, from the Kansas City Star. This newspaper article is important because, shortly after I became mayor, the first directive from me was to restore the eternal flame at the top of the Liberty Memorial. It's actually steam, it's not flame. The Liberty Memorial, which you'll hear from our director shortly, was an effort put together by people in the community shortly after the end of World War I. It was built completely, and financed, by the people of Kansas City, Missouri. It went into some decay. I came to Washington as mayor, made a request that the Liberty Memorial be taken over by the National Park Service. They politely declined, saying that the National Park Service had difficulty trying to maintain all of the memorials they presently hold responsibility for. I went back to Kansas and City and made a pitch to the voters Kansas City. They responded and approved a sales tax, which was used to restore the Liberty Memorial. From that point on, the people of Kansas City, Missouri--the voters--decided that this was something that we would do. We would assume the responsibility. We did not want one dime from the Federal Government. This is no small monument. This is the Liberty Memorial today. This is downtown Kansas City in the background, Missouri's largest city. This is the Liberty Memorial. Just 11 months ago, President Barack Obama stood on the mall with 75,000 people in the background. I drew the people there, but he spoke---- [Laughter.] Mr. Cleaver [continuing]. After I spoke. Seventy-five thousand people on the mall of the Liberty Memorial. Every year, there's a Veterans Day observance, where people from all over--all over the country--in fact, Mr. Buckles, 2 years ago, I sat next to him and his daughter at the Liberty Memorial on Veterans Day. The people of Kansas City, Missouri, are saying to the U.S. Senate the same thing they said to the House, which voted 418 to 1 to support this, that we want absolutely no money from the United States Federal Government. We don't need to raise any money around the country. We are going to assume the responsibility for supporting and preserving the Liberty Memorial, which was built not as a municipal memorial, but as the national memorial, which is why 100,000 people, including all five leaders of the allied forces, gathered here for the beginning and opening to the Liberty Memorial. This is a national monument. If there is, sometime in the future, a need for repair, we will do it. We've added an entire dimension to it--a new dimension to this, because now we have a museum on the lower level of the museum. It is one of the most stately monuments that you will see anyplace, day or night. You can see it from all over Kansas City. Our community is a city that stretches 322 square miles. You can virtually see the top of the Liberty Memorial anyplace in Kansas City, Missouri. It is a city, as we say, on a hill. So, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I think that what we are trying to say to you, and we successfully said it to our colleagues in the House, across party lines, that this was something that our community will continue to give for the Nation. We assume the responsibility completely, and we hope that you would see fit to give the people of Kansas City the opportunity to continue to spend their own money to preserve something for the Nation. [The prepared statement of Mr. Cleaver follows:] Prepared Statement of Emanuel Cleaver, II, U.S. Representative From Missouri, on S. 760 and H.R. 1849 Chairman Udall, Ranking Member Burr and other members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of S. 760 and H.R.1849 to designate the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Memorial and to establish a World War I Centennial Commission. Along with my Missouri colleagues, Representatives Akin, Blunt, Carnahan, Clay, Emerson, Graves, Luetkemeyer, and Skelton, plus 101 other House cosponsors, we introduced and passed a bill in the House of Representatives designating the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri as the National World War I Memorial by a vote of 418-1. This bill also establishes a Centennial Commission to ensure a fitting observance of the centennial of World War I. The First World War extended through four of the bloodiest years in world history. This truly global conflict involved the world's major powers, mobilizing over 70 million military forces. The War to End All Wars ended with an armistice on November 11, 1918 on the Western Front in Europe, after approximately 16 million military and civilian deaths across the globe, including 375,000 American casualties. The death and destruction of World War I irrevocably impacted the lens through which people viewed the world: The optimism that initiated the early 1900s was swiftly sobered by a consciousness that came to be known as the Lost Generation. Many people, however, were determined to make this generation a generation remembered and honored. Concerned American citizens in Kansas City, Missouri initiated a movement to erect a lasting and meaningful monument to the men and women who served and died for liberty in World War I. According to R.A. Long, the founding president of the Liberty Memorial Association, the 217-foot Liberty Memorial was intended to represent ``on the part of all people, a living expression for all time of the gratitude of a grateful people to those who offered and who gave their lives in defense of liberty and our country.'' In 1919, the people of Kansas City, Missouri expressed an outpouring of support and raised more than $2,500,000.00, or the equivalent of $30, 815,028.90 today, in two weeks for a memorial to the service of Americans in World War I. This fundraising was an accomplishment unparalleled by any other city in the United States and reflected the passion of public opinion about World War I, at the forefront of everyone's memory. H. Van Buren Magonigle won a national architectural competition officiated by the American Institute of Architects to further transform the Liberty Memorial idea into reality. On November 1, 1921, nearly 200,000 people witnessed the dedication of the site for the Liberty memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. The dedication marked the only time in history that the five allied military leaders--Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium, General Armando Diaz of Italy, Marshall Ferdinand Foch of France, General John J. Pershing of the United States, and Admiral Lord Earl Beatty of Great Britain, were together at one place. General Pershing echoed the significance of the dedication by asserting, ``[t]he people of Kansas City, Missouri are deeply proud of the beautiful memorial, erected in tribute to the patriotism, the gallant achievements, and their heroic sacrifices of their sons and daughters who served in our country's armed forces during the World War. It symbolized their grateful appreciation of duty well done, an appreciation which I share, because I know so well how richly it is merited.'' Shortly after its dedication, the Liberty Memorial was again distinguished during an Armistice Day ceremony in 1926 when President Calvin Coolidge marked the beginning of its three-year construction project by laying the cornerstone of the memorial. In his dedication speech, President Coolidge declared that ``[. . .] the magnitude of this memorial and the broad base of popular support on which it rests, can scarcely fail to excite national wonder and admiration [. . .].'' A message on the Liberty Memorial's tower bears an inscription that inspired its namesake: ``In Honor of Those Who Served in the World War in Defense of Liberty and our Country.'' Four stone ``Guardian Spirits'' representing courage, honor, patriotism, and sacrifice proudly perch above an observation deck, making the Liberty Memorial a noble tribute to all who served in World War I. The evidence articulated above demonstrates that the Liberty Memorial already is, has been, and deserves to be regarded as a national tribute to World War I. This legislation aims to make official what so many people already consider to be the National World War I Memorial. While we look to the Liberty Memorial in remembrance of World War I, we likewise must look to the upcoming World War I centennial, to be honored in 2017. To ensure a proper observance of the World War I centennial, this legislation also aims to create a commission to be known as the World War I Centennial Commission. The Commission will promote not only a suitable observance of the centennial of World War I, but will also recognize the values of honor, courage, patriotism, and sacrifice, in keeping with the representation of these values through the four Guardian Sprits sculpted on the Liberty Memorial Monument. The Commission will plan, develop, and execute programs, projects, and activities to commemorate the centennial of World War I. With Kansas City, Missouri as its official host, the Commission will be composed of twenty-four members who will work together to facilitate and coordinate activities throughout the United States to honor the Great War. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Burr, it is with great pride that I speak for myself, our Missouri Congressional Delegation and the citizens of Missouri in support of this legislation to make official the historic, powerful, and unparalleled stature of the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Memorial coupled with the establishment of the World War I Centennial Commission to properly observe the World War I centennial. We owe the Liberty Memorial's designation as the National World War I Memorial to the hundreds of thousands of people, including those who served our country in World War I, who have looked to the Liberty Memorial as the interminable symbol of sacrifice and sovereignty that continue to shape our country. The World War I Centennial Commission will further observe America's historic commitment to freedom and appropriately remember those who fought for our country in the War to End All Wars. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Burr, attached to my testimony is an overview of events at the Liberty Memorial, a time line of Significant Dates at the Liberty Memorial and reasons to support the Liberty Memorial designation as the National World War I Memorial. attachment.--overview, timeline and reasons to support of the liberty memorial as the national wwi memorial Historical Background Overview An armistice was declared on November 11, 1918 to end the fighting on the Western Front. Concerned citizens in Kansas City, Missouri were determined to commemorate those who served in WWI. Shortly after the armistice in November 1918, community leaders galvanized a campaign to raise money for the construction of a lasting tribute to the men and women who fought in WWI. Within ten days--during an influenza epidemic--Kansas Citians raised $2.5 million for the construction of what came to be known as the Liberty Memorial. $2.5 million calculated for inflation in today's currency would be worth $30,815,028.90. This fundraising was an accomplishment unparalleled by any other city in the United States and reflected the passion of public opinion about World War I, at the forefront of everyone's memory. The slogan of the campaign was ``Lest the Ages Forget.'' Following the fund raiser was a national competition for the selection of the New York architect H. Van Buren Magonigle. Construction of the Liberty Memorial began in 1921 which was commemorated with a dedication ceremony on November 1, 1921, attended by General John J. Pershing of the United States; Admiral Lord Beatty of Great Britain; General Armando Diaz of Italy; Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France; and Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium. --The dedication marked the only time in history that the five allied military leaders were together at one place. --The allied military leaders spoke to a crowd of nearly 200,000. --General Pershing echoed the significance of the dedication by asserting, ``[t]he people of Kansas City, Missouri are deeply proud of the beautiful memorial, erected in tribute to the patriotism, the gallant achievements, and their heroic sacrifices of their sons and daughters who served in our country's armed forces during the World War. It symbolized their grateful appreciation of duty well done, an appreciation which I share, because I know so well how richly it is merited.'' --Harry S. Truman played a high-profile role in the parade following the 1921 dedication ceremony as Vice Chairman of the Decoration Committee of the American Legion. On Armistice Day in 1926, President Calvin Coolidge marked the beginning of the three-year construction project by laying the cornerstone of the memorial. --In his dedication speech, President Coolidge declared that ``[. . .] the magnitude of this memorial and the broad base of popular support on which it rests, can scarcely fail to excite national wonder and admiration [. . .].'' There has been a Veterans Day observance at the Liberty Memorial every year since 1926. There has been a Memorial Day observance at the Liberty Memorial every year since 1948. A rededication ceremony in 1961 was marked by the attendance of President Harry S. Truman and President Dwight D. Eisenhower. --Then Mayor H. Roe Bartle expressed his support of the rededication ceremony: ``For four decades Kansas City has pointed to its unique and unusual war memorial with pride. Millions of people from over the globe have visited our shrine to our heroic dead who fought in World War I for freedom of the world. It pleases me that the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and other veterans' associations are joining hands with the city to make the 40th anniversary program an event not soon to be forgotten.'' --Representatives from 57 nations were present at the rededication ceremony; this was the largest diplomatic gathering ever assembled in the Middle West. --A crowd of 40,000 attended the ceremony; as in the celebrations of 1921 and 1926, schools dismissed afternoon classes and businesses around Kansas City closed their doors for the event. --President Eisenhower delivered a speech addressing his hopes for everlasting world peace and the elimination of totalitarian power. A rededication ceremony in 2002 was attended by General Myers as the Keynote as well as dignitaries from Italy, France, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. The Liberty Memorial that overlooks Kansas City extends far beyond the Kansas City limits. The Memorial serves as a perennial reminder of and for all Americans who served our country during World War I. Reasons to Support the Liberty Memorial as the World War I National Memorial The Liberty Memorial already exists and would not require any additional construction. The Liberty Memorial is open to a partnership with the National Parks Service, but would prefer independent administration. The Liberty Memorial was recognized by the 106th Congress as a national symbol of World War I. (The concurrent Resolution was passed on October 24, 2000, ``Recognizing the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, as a national World War I symbol honoring those who defended liberty and our country through service in World War I.'') The Liberty Memorial is a National Landmark (as of September 20, 2006). The Liberty Memorial has been designated as a National Symbol for World War I. The Liberty Memorial ultimately seeks the recognition as the National WWI Memorial; it does not necessarily wish to be managed by the National Parks Service. As with the designation of the National WWI Museum, the Liberty Memorial would prefer to be independently administered. Hundreds of thousands of people--since the memorial's inception and even today--regard the Liberty Memorial as a powerful symbol of and tribute to Americans who served in World War I. There is no nationally recognized memorial honoring the service of Americans who served in World War I. Kansas City is home to the National World War I Museum (as designated by Congress in 2004), which is adjacent to the Liberty Memorial. An inscription on the Liberty Memorial tower reads, ``In honor of those who served in the world war in defense of liberty and our country.'' Many other national monuments exist outside of Washington, DC (examples include the Mt. Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota; the Jefferson National Expansion memorial in St. Louis, Missouri; the AIDS Memorial Grove in San Francisco, California; the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Chamizal National Memorial in Texas, etc.) Not only does the Liberty Memorial already exist, it boasts an extensive and unparalleled history. H.R. 1849, the World War I Memorial and Centennial Act of 2009, passed the House of Representatives on November 5, 2009, by a vote of 418-1.

Senator Udall. Thank you, Congressman Cleaver, for those compelling words, and for the history that's attached to the project that you led and brought to fruition. We look forward to working with you, and the Senators that are here, to find a reasonable way forward, to commemorate the work of people like Frank Buckles, and the heroism that is attached to it. I think we do have a vote on the floor of Senate at this time. I think we ought to recess the committee, and we'll return as quickly as we can to continue the hearing. So, thanks, again, to the witnesses who took the time to join us. Thanks, to Mr. Buckles. [Recess.] Senator Udall. The Subcommittee on National Parks will come to order. Before I recognize Ms. Stevenson for her testimony, I wanted to make a few announcements. Senator McCaskill, the sponsor of S. 760, was unable to be here today, but has submitted a statement, and, without objection, it will be included in the hearing record. She has also submitted letters of support from the American Legion, the VFW, and the family of Sergeant Alvin C. York, and, without objection, those letters* will be included in the record, as well. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * See Appendix. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- [The prepared statement of Senator McCaskill follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Claire McCaskill, U.S. Senator From Missouri I would like to thank the Chairman Udall and Ranking Member Burr for holding this hearing on S.760 and H.R. 1849, to designate the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri as the National World War I Memorial and to establish a World War I Centennial Commission. These bills seek to honor the patriotism and dedication of those who fought in World War I (WWI), as well as those who have to sought to preserve that honor embodied in a national memorial and museum. Just two weeks after the 1918 Armistice, members of the Kansas City community embarked on a campaign to create a grand monument and museum to honor all those who fought and lost their lives in WWI. A community- based fundraising drive in 1919 raised over $2.5 million from citizens across the in US in just ten days. This was unprecedented for the time and reflected the passion of citizens from across the United States to support Kansas City's efforts to establish a memorial to all of WWI's fallen heroes. The national scope of the support for the endeavor and the inclusion of all of the nation's WWI fallen as part of the Memorial set the foundation for the Memorial to be recognized as a National memorial, a moniker we now seek to finally give the memorial. Underscoring the scope and breadth of the Memorial, during the 1921 site dedication in Kansas City, the military commanders from each of the five Allied nations attended the dedication--the only time in history the five senior most military leaders from WWI were together in one place at the same time. Subsequently, after 3 years of construction, the two hundred and seventeen foot tall memorial was dedicated by President Calvin Coolidge before a crowd of 150,000 people. In the decades since, veterans of the Great War and their families have come to this site to honor and remember those who fought. More recently, their experience has been enhanced with the expansion of the WWI Museum. In 2006, after a $105 million renovation, the WWI Museum reopened its newly renovated 32,000 square feet of exhibitions that nobly honor the heroes of WWI. At the updated museum, visitors can view films dedicated to the War in a state of the art theater; follow US involvement in the war from the United States' entry in 1917 to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919; and read real accounts of those connected to the war. Over 1 million people have visited the site since the reopening in 2006. On October 24, 2000 the Liberty Memorial was recognized by Congress as a ``national World War I symbol honoring those who defended liberty and our country through service in World War I''. And in 2004, Congress designated the museum at the Liberty Memorial the National World War I Museum. Given this national recognition it is only befitting that the Liberty Memorial be finally and rightfully recognized as the nation's National World War I Memorial. This legislation has received substantial support. The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the family of Sgt. Alvin C. York, the most decorated U.S. World War I soldier, have all written letters supporting the designation of the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Memorial. Each of these letters are attached to my testimony. Also attached to my testimony is a photo which helps to illustrate the grandeur and magnificence of the Liberty Memorial and its presence in the city. There is truly nothing like it. I am aware that others are seeking to establish the District of Columbia World War I Monument, which resides on the National Mall here in Washington, D.C., as a National World War I Monument. I am saddened by the disrepair of the D.C. Monument and the general lack of care it has received over many years. I believe this must be addressed and remedied as soon as possible and I applaud those who have taken up this cause. However, I do not believe that a monument's presence on the National Mall alone should entitle it to the moniker of a National monument. Nor should a monument's presence elsewhere be exclusionary. Other considerations should also include the scope, history and care of a Monument, as well as the general manner in which the Monument is perceived by our citizens. With these types of considerations, it is clear that the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City is our nation's National World War I Monument. I firmly believe we should assign it that moniker as we approach the 100th Anniversary of World War I. I look forward to working with my friends supporting the D.C. Monument and to seeking a solution that wins that monument revitalization and appropriate recognition associated with its location while also recognizing the national nature of the Liberty Memorial. Again, I want to thank Chairman Udall and Ranking Member Burr for holding this hearing. As you can tell from my testimony am so proud to be the lead sponsor of this legislation and even prouder of the citizens of Kansas City. Senator Udall. We also have letters from the National Coalition To Save Our Mall opposing H.R. 3689, the Vietnam Memorial Visitor Center bill, and one from the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department in support of the same bill. We have a statement from District of Columbia shadow Senator Paul Strauss, opposing S. 2097, the DC World War I Memorial bill. All these letters and statements will be included in the hearing record. With that, let me turn to Ms. Stevenson, who is the assistant director of business services, the National Park Service, Department of the Interior. Ms. Stevenson, nice to see you. It isn't your first visit to the subcommittee. Ms. Stevenson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Udall. The floor is yours. STATEMENT OF KATHERINE H. STEVENSON, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, BUSINESS SERVICES, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ACCOMPANIED BY PETER MAY, ASSOCIATE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR LANDS, RESOURCES, AND PLANNING, NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION Ms. Stevenson. Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to offer the views of the Department of the Interior on the eight bills before you. I'll summarize my remarks and ask that the full text be entered into the record. With me today is Peter May, the Associate Regional Director for Lands, Resources, and Planning with the National Capital Region, in case you have any detailed questions about the projects on the Mall. S. 760 would designate the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, as the National World War I Memorial. A companion bill, H.R. 1849, would also establish the World War I Centennial Commission. The Department supports the intent of establishing such a commission, but believes it is premature to designate the Liberty Memorial as the National World War I Museum until a study of the various World War I memorials in the United States has been completed. That study would determine which memorial is best suited to be named the official National World War I Memorial. Such a study would be timely, as S. 2097, before you today, also proposes designation of the DC World War I Memorial as a National World War I Memorial. In 2008, the Congress directed the National Park Service to study the Soldier Memorial Military Museum in Saint Louis, also a World War I Memorial, as a potential addition to the National Park System. S. 1838 would establish a Civil War Sesquicentennial Commemoration Commission to ensure that there's a suitable national observance of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. The Department supports enactment, with some minor amendments. S. 2097 would rededicate and enhance the DC War Memorial as a National and District of Columbia World War I memorial. The Department cannot support S. 2097, both for the reasons I explained regarding other World War I Memorial candidates, and because the sculptural or commemorative elements proposed would so alter the existing memorial in purpose and design that the result would be, in effect, the creation of a new memorial within the reserve. Our position is supported by the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission and by the American Battle Monuments Commission. S. 2722 would authorize the Secretary to conduct a study to determine whether it is suitable and feasible to add Heart Mountain Relocation Center as a unit of the National Park Service. The Department supports this bill. However, we feel that priority should be given to the 49 previously authorized studies. S. 2726 would modify the boundary of the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in South Dakota by transferring 25 acres of Buffalo Gap National Grassland from the U.S. Forest Service to the National Park Service for use as a visitor facility and administrative site. The Department supports this bill, with some technical amendments. S. 2738 would authorize the National Mall Liberty Fund DC to establish a memorial in DC on Federal land to honor free persons and slaves who fought during the American Revolution. The Department supports the bill if it is amended to conform to the principles, purposes, and requirements of the Commemorative Works Act. While S. 2738 states that the memorial shall in established in accordance with the Commemorative Works Act, the bill contravenes a critical requirement of that Act by preselecting Area 1 as the site. You will recall that the Commemorative Works Act was amended in 2003 to provide for the establishment of a reserve where no additional memorials may be located. Finally, H.R. 3689 would extend by 4 years the authority of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Incorporated, to establish a visitor center. The Department supports that bill. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared testimony. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statements of Ms. Stevenson follow:] Prepared Statement of Katherine H. Stevenson, Assistant Director, Business Services, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, Accompanied by Peter May, Associate Regional Director for Lands, Resources, and Planning, National Capital Region s. 760 and h.r. 1849 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before your committee to present the views of the Department of the Interior on S. 760 and H.R. 1849, bills to designate the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, as the National World War I Memorial. H.R. 1849 also establishes the World War I Centennial Commission to ensure a suitable observance of the centennial of World War I. The Administration appreciates the sponsors' recognition of the sacrifices of Americans who served in World War I. This is an important era in American history which has been honored through a number of monuments throughout the nation. The Administration shares the sponsors' sentiment on this subject and would like to continue working with the Congress on it. We believe however, that it is premature to designate the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, as the National World War I Memorial. There has not been any study authorized or conducted to determine which of the various World War I Memorials in the United States would be best suited to be named as the single or official National World War I Memorial. The Department of the Interior supports the intent of establishing a World War I Centennial Commission; however, the Department of Justice has advised that it has constitutional concerns about certain appointment provisions in the bill and we understand Justice is providing its recommended amendments to the Committee to resolve these concerns. The Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Government Ethics would also welcome the opportunity to work with the Committee to address matters related to the status of the Commission's members and employees for purposes of various laws governing Federal employment. We defer to those agencies for the specifics of their concerns.. Both S. 760 and H.R. 1849 as passed by the House would designate the Liberty Memorial at the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, as the National World War I Memorial. H.R. 1849 also would establish the World War I Centennial Commission to plan and execute various activities to commemorate the centennial of World War I, encouraging private organizations and other governmental entities to participate in the centennial, and coordinate these activities throughout the United States. The Commission would consist of 21 members appointed by the President and certain members of Congress and would also include the executive director of the American Legion and the president of the Liberty Memorial Association. The bill authorizes $500,000 for fiscal years 2010 through 2019 to carry out the activities of the commission. The Administrator of General Services would provide the administrative support services to the Commission. Mr. Chairman, our Department would be pleased to work with the Commission if it is established. This concludes my testimony. I will be pleased to answer any questions from members of the Committee. s. 1838 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to present the views of the Department of the Interior on S. 1838, a bill that would establish a commission to commemorate the Sesquicentennial of the American Civil War. The Department supports the enactment of this legislation subject to addressing some minor amendments discussed in our testimony and the concerns of the Department of Justice, which has advised that it may have constitutional concerns about an appointment provision in the bill and will provide its recommended amendments, if any, at a later date to address these concerns. The Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Government Ethics also welcome the opportunity to work with the Committee to address matters related to the status of the Commission's members and employees for purposes of various laws governing Federal employment. We defer to those agencies for the specifics of their concerns. S. 1838 would establish a Civil War Sesquicentennial Commemoration Commission to cooperate with and assist States and national organizations with programs and activities to ensure a suitable national observance of the 150th anniversary of the Civil War. It also authorizes a grant program for the development of programs, projects, and activities on the Civil War that have lasting educational value. The Civil War was, in the words of Robert Penn Warren, ``the great single event of our history.'' It was the both the greatest disaster that has ever befallen our nation, and also our era of greatest achievement. It was a wrenching conflict that resulted in the loss of 620,000 lives, the liberation of four million African American slaves, and the ratification of three Constitutional amendments that forever changed the face of American democracy. S. 1838 is mindful of this reality as it directs the Commission to recognize ``the experiences and points of view of all people affected by the Civil War,'' and provides for the development of ``programs, projects, and activities on the Civil War that have lasting educational value.'' As S. 1838 acknowledges, the military aspects of the Civil War are important events to commemorate. It is equally important, however, as we prepare to reflect on the war from the vantage point of a-century- and-a-half later, that we explore the causes of the conflict to understand better why the democratic framework of the country failed to resolve the sectional issues short of war. Likewise, we would be doing a disservice to those who fought and fell, if the Sesquicentennial did not fully examine and reflect upon the consequences of the Civil War including not only the Reconstruction era and its aftermath, but also the subsequent constriction of equal rights for African American citizens, and the ultimate achievement of those civil rights for the descendents of enslaved peoples almost a century later. As the country approaches the 150th anniversary of the war, the meaning of the Civil War should be explored fully. Its causes and consequences, subjects which Congress directed the National Park Service to address in its programs and materials beginning in 1999, can and must be a major part of the Sesquicentennial. The Sesquicentennial should assume the broadest possible approach to remembering and commemorating the war. With that in mind, and subject to the concerns of the other federal agencies referenced above, the Department would recommend the following suggestions for strengthening S. 1838 and making its implementation more efficient and effective. First, the findings mention specific organizations and places important to the Sesquicentennial of the Civil War. It is important to remember that the Civil War was a national experience and its Sesquicentennial commemoration should likewise represent a broad spectrum of the nation. For example, the Virginia Center for Digital History (University of Virginia) with its The Valley of the Shadow project could contribute much to our understanding of the war. Other entities that might logically be considered would include the Center for Study of the American South at the University of North Carolina and the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi. We recommend that other scholarly centers and programs be acknowledged so that the social, political, and economic aspects of the war receive emphasis. Second, respecting the importance of the appointments to this nationally important commission, we recommend that the bill allow for 180 days instead of 60 days for the selection of the commission members. Third, the bill envisions a commission that would include twenty- seven members. We believe a commission of this size would significantly impede the timely selection of its members, diminish its ability to work efficiently and effectively, and would be too costly. We recommend a smaller commission, with perhaps fifteen or seventeen members. We would be glad to work with the committee on language for these proposed amendments. Establishing a commission, subject to modifications as discussed above, to commemorate the sesquicentennial of the Civil War as envisioned in S. 1838 would provide the nation an opportunity to reflect upon this momentous event within an environment that would be inclusive and contemplative. The Department of the Interior and the National Park Service stand ready to contribute its resources and expertise to this important commemoration. It would enable all Americans to reflect anew upon the war, its consequences, and its lasting legacies. It would result, we can hope, in greater public insight into the war and promote increased awareness of its remarkable influence upon our society today. This concludes my prepared testimony, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to answer any questions you or the committee might have. s. 2097 Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to present the Department of the Interior's views on S. 2097, to authorize the rededication of the District of Columbia War Memorial as a National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial to honor the sacrifices made by American veterans of World War I. The Administration appreciates the sponsors' recognition of the sacrifices of Americans who served in World War I. This is an important era in American history which has been honored through a number of monuments throughout the nation. The Administration shares the sponsors' sentiment on this subject and would like to continue working with the Congress on it. However, we feel that it would be premature to designate the District of Columbia War Memorial (Memorial) as the National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial. There has not been any study authorized or conducted to determine which of the various World War I Memorials in the United States would be best suited to be named as the single or official National World War I Memorial. Further, the bill undermines several significant provisions of the Commemorative Works Act. Therefore, the Department cannot support S. 2097. S. 2097 would authorize the World War I Memorial Foundation (Foundation) to establish a commemorative work rededicating the existing District of Columbia War Memorial as a National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial by restoring the Memorial and adding an appropriate sculptural or other commemorative element. The District of Columbia War Memorial was authorized by Congress on June 7, 1924, to commemorate the citizens of the District of Columbia who served in World War I. The Memorial was funded by both organizations and citizens of the District of Columbia. Construction of the Memorial began in the spring of 1931 and was dedicated by President Herbert Hoover on November 11, 1931. It was the first war memorial to be erected in West Potomac Park and remains the only local District memorial on the National Mall. The Memorial is a contributing structure in East and West Potomac Parks entry in the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Washington architect Frederick H. Brooke, with Horace W. Peaslee and Nathan C. Wyeth as associate architects, inscribed on the base of the Memorial are the names of the 499 District of Columbia citizens who lost their lives in the war. The Memorial was designed to be used as a bandstand and is large enough to hold an 80-member band. Concerts were held there until May 1, 1960. Today's visitors are likely those who are there for its peaceful and contemplative setting. The Department concurs with the findings of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission (NCMAC) and the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) that adding a National World War I Memorial near the District of Columbia War Memorial would allow a new memorial into the Reserve as well as encroach upon the existing Memorial, either of which would be violations of the Commemorative Works Act Moreover, the sculptural or commemorative elements that S. 2097 proposes would so alter the existing District of Columbia War Memorial--in both its purpose and design--that the result would be, in effect, the creation of a new memorial. This legislation exempts this proposal from key provisions which are at the heart of the Commemorative Works Act. Section 8908 of the Act precludes the addition of new memorials in the Reserve, the great cross-axis of the Mall, which generally extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and from the White House to the Jefferson Memorial. Section 8905 of the Act requires the site and design for a new memorial be developed in a public process, first obtaining the advice of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, and then obtaining approvals by the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Veterans of World War I are honored at the General John J. Pershing Park, which is a national World War I Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue. Pershing Park, located in the center of Pennsylvania Avenue, between 14th and 15th Streets, was built by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation and includes a statue of General Pershing, as well as artwork detailing the major battles in World War I that involved U.S. troops. This commemorative work represents all who served in that conflict. Quotations on this existing World War I Veterans Memorial include General Pershing's tribute to the officers and men of the American Expeditionary Forces of World War I and a commemoration of those who served in the United States Navy in World War I. Veterans of World War I are also honored on the Mall near the White House by the 1st Division and 2nd Division Memorials. The Department appreciates the interest in improving the conditions at the District of Columbia War Memorial. While, as with other memorials, this memorial receives routine maintenance, the National Park Service has recognized it needs comprehensive attention. Open mortar joints and failed metal flashings have allowed water infiltration into the brick, terra cotta tile, and marble. Marble displacement, spalling, and cracking have also occurred. The character of the Memorial's grounds has also changed. The Memorial grove is now a mix of hardwoods, evergreens, understory plantings, and non-native plants, altering the intended character of the open grove. The bluestone paving is severely deteriorated and broken from vehicular use. As a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $7.3 million has been set aside for an extensive three-stage project to restore and rehabilitate the Memorial and grounds. First, stone conservators are conducting tests to determine the best methods for cleaning and removing general and biological soiling, stains, and old paint to restore the Memorial to an appearance consistent with the structure's age and material character. Corrections to the built-in gutter and drainage systems will also be made to help eliminate moisture infiltration and the associated staining and spalling. Second, the project will restore the original planting plan, re- establishing the 50-foot open lawn around the Memorial, set within a grove of trees. Third, the current deteriorated condition of the surrounding stone plaza and walkways will be rehabilitated with thicker, more durable stone paving and the walkways widened from eight feet to ten feet to address contemporary use. The National Park Service received approval for this restoration and rehabilitation project from the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts on September 17, 2009, and from the National Capital Planning Commission on September 24, 2009. Final design, as well as final approvals from both Commissions, is expected to be complete this spring, with the rehabilitation expected to be complete by September 30, 2012. As the District of Columbia World War I Memorial is dedicated to, and was built with funds from the citizens of the District of Columbia, any modification to rededicate it and turn this local memorial into a national memorial would run counter to the letter and spirit of its original authorization and to the intent of the Commemorative Works Act. Rather than making exceptions to the Commemorative Works Act and setting this precedent--superimposing a new memorial over an existing one, the Department believes that greater recognition could be given to studying opportunities to improve upon the national World War I Memorial in Pershing Park, in accordance with the Commemorative Works Act. . The Department believes that the memorial in Pershing Park could be given an even greater national stature, without impinging on the Commemorative Works Act. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks. I would be happy to answer any questions that you or any other members of the subcommittee may have. s. 2722 Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to present the Department of the Interior's views on S. 2722, to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility of adding the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, in the State of Wyoming, as a unit of the National Park System. The Department supports S. 2722. However, we feel that priority should be given to the 49 previously authorized studies for potential units of the National Park System, potential new National Heritage Areas, and potential additions to the National Trails System and the National Wild and Scenic River System that have not yet been transmitted to Congress. S. 2722 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to conduct a special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility of designating the Heart Mountain Relocation Center as a unit of the National Park System. The study would also consider other alternatives for the preservation, protection and interpretation of the site by federal, State, or local governmental entities, or private and nonprofit organizations. The bill also directs the Secretary to identify any potential impacts to private landowners if the site is designated as a unit of the National Park System and specifies that the Secretary, through the study process, shall consult with interested federal, State, or local governmental entities, federally recognized Indian tribes, private and nonprofit organizations, and owners of private property that may be affected by any designation. Not later than three years after funds are made available, the Secretary is directed to submit the results and recommendations of the study to Congress. We estimate that this study will cost approximately $240,000. Located in northwest Wyoming, in the Shoshone River Valley, the Heart Mountain Relocation Center is one of 10 relocation centers established by the U.S. military to incarcerate Japanese Americans during World War II. The Center opened on August 11, 1942, and operated for 39 months, closing on November 10, 1945. At its peak, Heart Mountain contained 10,767 Japanese Americans, nearly all of whom were former residents of California, Oregon, and Washington, and two-thirds of whom were United States citizens. The site tells the story of a group of American citizens whose constitutional rights were abrogated during a time when our nation was at war. Heart Mountain is also directly associated with one of the largest single draft resistance movements in United States history. To protest the confinement of their families, 315 Japanese Americans from all 10 relocation centers were imprisoned for resisting induction into the military. Heart Mountain had the highest rate of resistance with 85 men imprisoned for their resistance to the draft. The Heart Mountain Relocation Center originally encompassed 21,521 acres. However, the center's core developed area, which included the residential and administrative areas, contained approximately 740 acres. Jointly managed by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Heart Mountain, Wyoming Foundation, the current Heart Mountain National Historic Landmark contains 124 acres with the remaining parts of the area privately owned. The Bureau of Reclamation owns and administers 74 acres, which includes the site of the original hospital complex and a portion of the administrative complex. The Heart Mountain, Wyoming Foundation owns 50 acres, which includes the relocation center's military police compound. The Foundation is currently engaged in a significant fundraising campaign to construct an 11,000 square foot Interpretive Learning Center at the site. To date, nearly one-half of the needed funds have been raised. Although, as a nation, we are not proud of what happened at the Heart Mountain Relocation Center and the other nine detention sites where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II, such sites allow us to learn from our history and remind us of how far we have come. The designation of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center as a National Historic Landmark has brought increased public recognition and awareness of the site. However, this designation does not guarantee additional safeguards or protection of the site. The special resource study process would allow all interested parties to comment on ways to preserve and allow for visitor enjoyment of the Heart Mountain Relocation Center. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks. I would be happy to answer any questions you or any other members of the subcommittee may have. s. 2726 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before your committee to present the views of the Department of the Interior on S. 2726, a bill to modify the boundary of the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in the State of South Dakota. The Department supports S. 2726 with some technical amendments included at the end of this statement. S. 2726 would authorize the Secretary to transfer 25 acres of Buffalo Gap National Grasslands from the U.S. Forest Service to Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in Philip, South Dakota, to establish a visitor facility and administrative site. The new facility would be located north of exit 131 on Interstate 90 in Jackson County, South Dakota. Minuteman Missile's enabling legislation states, ``On a determination by the Secretary of the appropriate location for a visitor facility and administrative site, the boundary of the historic site shall be modified to include the selected site.'' The enabling legislation also included a map of the visitor center site indicating that the proposed area would be 10 acres in size. Later planning indicated that a minimum size for the visitor center site would require 25 acres. National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service personnel, in consultation with our respective lawyers, have discussed that in view of the increase in acreage, it would be appropriate to provide for that increase in new legislation. There would be no cost involved in this land transfer. The U.S. Forest Service (Buffalo Gap National Grassland) is in agreement with the recommended land transfer and has provided Minuteman Missile NHS with an outline of the land transfer process. The National Park Service's Midwest regional architects and engineers conducted an on-site visit in March 2009 with the Minuteman Missile NHS staff to determine the number of acres necessary for the land transfer. The National Grassland representatives met with representatives from the National Park Service to discuss the proposed land involved in the transfer and the U.S. Forest Service has agreed to the transfer of 25 acres. We note that the U.S. Forest Service also has identified the Bankhead Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 as another possible vehicle for this transfer. Public Law 106-115 established the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. The General Management Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (GMP/EIS) scoping began in 2001 and the record of decision was signed on July 2, 2009. The GMP's preferred alternative included the development of a visitor center/administrative facility and a land transfer from the U.S. Forest Service to the National Park Service for the site of the facility. The GMP recommended the preferred location at I-90 South Dakota Exit 131 with ``up to'' 25 acres for the complete facility. The estimated cost to build the visitor center and administrative site is $4.7 million, and the estimated cost to annual operate and maintain both facilities would be approximately $750,000. All funds would be subject to NPS priorities and the availability of appropriations. The transfer between the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service would be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony. I look forward to working with the Committee on these amendments and other technical issues. I am prepared to answer any questions from members of the Committee. Proposed amendments to S. 2726, the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site Boundary Modification Act Page 2, line 2, by striking `` respectively; and '' and inserting ``respectively;'' Page 2, line 6, by inserting ``also'' after `` historic site ''. Page 2, line 18, by striking `` 2009 ' . '' and inserting `` 2009 '; and '' Page 2, after line 18, by inserting `` (3) in section (3)(a)(3), as redesignated by paragraph (1), by striking `` (4) AVAILABILITY OF MAP.--The map described in paragraph (2)'' and inserting `` (4) AVAILABILITY OF MAPS.-- The maps described in paragraphs (2) and (3) '' ----(4) in section (3)(e)(1), by striking ``Except as provided in paragraph (2)'' and inserting ``Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3)''. ----(5) in section (3)(e), by adding a new paragraph (3) as follows: (3) The Secretary of Agriculture shall transfer administrative jurisdiction over the lands described in paragraph 3(a)(3) to the Secretary, and shall modify the boundaries of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland to exclude the transferred lands from the grassland boundaries. As soon as practicable after the transfer, the Secretary shall prepare a map and a legal description of the lands described herein, which shall be on file and available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of the National Park Service. s. 2738 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to present the Department of the Interior's views on S. 2738, a bill to authorize the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to establish a memorial on federal land in the District of Columbia to honor free persons and slaves who fought for independence, liberty, and justice for all during the American Revolution. The Department supports S. 2738 if amended to conform to the principles, processes, and requirements set forth in the Commemorative Works Act, which has successfully guided the process for establishing monuments in the Nation's Capital since it was enacted in 1986 and as amended since that time. We also recommend that one technical correction be made to a map reference in the bill. The bill would authorize the establishment of a memorial on federal land in the District of Columbia to recognize and commemorate the contributions of 5,000 African Americans who served as soldiers and sailors or provided civilian assistance during the American Revolutionary War. The bill prohibits the use of federal funds to establish the memorial, directs that the memorial be established according to the Commemorative Works Act, and repeals two laws for the authorization and site selection of a similar memorial proposal that expired. In 1986, Congress enacted the Commemorative Works Act to guide the process for establishing memorials in the Nation's Capital. Since its enactment, the Act has played an important role in ensuring that memorials in the Nation's Capital are erected on the most appropriate sites and are of a caliber of design that is worthy of their historically significant subjects. The Act was amended in 2003 to, among other things, provide for establishment of a Reserve where no additional memorials may be located. While S. 2738 states that the memorial shall be established in accordance with the Commemorative Works Act, the bill contravenes a critical requirement of the Commemorative Works Act by pre-selecting Area I as the site for this memorial. Area I is located within the Monumental Core of the Nation's Capital extending around the Capitol Reflecting Pool to the eastern boundary of Arlington National Cemetery and along the Virginia shoreline. Area I excludes the Reserve, the great cross-axis of the Mall, which generally extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and from the White House to the Jefferson Memorial. Congress, in the Commemorative Works Act, reserved Area I for subjects determined to be of preeminent and lasting historic significance to the Nation and it established a process for making this determination which has worked well for over 20 years. Through this process, a new memorial may be located in Area I only if the Secretary determines, after consulting with the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, which holds public meetings, that the memorial's subject warrants location in Area I and recommends it to Congress. If Congress agrees with the recommendation, it enacts a law within 150 days approving the location. As currently written, S. 2738 bypasses this important process. Following the Commemorative Works Act, in the Department's view, would not hinder the Liberty Memorial Foundation in its ability to establish this memorial. In fact, if it obtains an Area I designation through this process, it would be granted an additional seven years to complete the memorial, for a total of 14 years. This change was made by Congress when it amended the Commemorative Works Act in 2003, and as a result sponsors no longer need to fear that seeking an Area I designation might cost them their authority to establish the memorial at all. We also would note out that S. 2738 makes no provisions for the disposition of monies raised in excess of funds needed for the establishment of the memorial or to hold in reserve the amount available should the authority to establish the memorial expire before completion. The Department recommends that the bill be amended to clarify the disposition of these funds. The Department also notes that the bill references the 1986 map, which Congress amended in 2003 when it changed the boundaries of Area I and created the Reserve. The 1986 map is no longer valid. We recommend that the bill be amended to reference the revised map, numbered 869/ 86501B and dated June 24, 2003. The Department reiterates our support of the establishment of a memorial in the Nation's Capital that recognizes and commemorates the contributions of African Americans who fought for independence, liberty and justice during the Revolutionary War. We look forward to the opportunity to work with the subcommittee to develop language that would provide for such authorization in a manner consistent with the principles, processes, and requirements set forth by existing authorities. Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared testimony, I would be glad to answer any questions that you or other members of the subcommittee may have. h.r. 3689 Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to present the Department of the Interior's views on H.R. 3689, a bill to provide for an extension of the legislative authority of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc. (the Fund) to establish a Vietnam Veterans Memorial visitor center, and for other purposes. The Department supports H.R. 3689 as passed by the House. The visitor center was authorized by Public Law 108-126, signed on November 17, 2003. Following site analysis and the completion of an environmental assessment, the visitor center was approved to be located on the NPS proposed site on the grounds of the Lincoln Memorial, bounded by Constitution Avenue, Henry Bacon Drive, Lincoln Memorial Circle, and 23rd Street, N.W., so long as certain mitigation set forth in design standards developed jointly by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) are met. To protect the sensitive landscape of the site, which includes views to and from the Lincoln Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the design team is responding to these critical design standards and criteria. The criteria have been helpful to move this important commemorative work forward while minimizing potential impacts to the surrounding views and nearby memorials. In addition to public consultation under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Commemorative Works Act requires an important series of reviews and approvals by NCPC and CFA. To meet the challenges associated with designing this project on such a sensitive and highly visible site, and the legislative requirement that it be located underground, the NPS and the Fund have made design refinements as needed during this process. We are pleased to report that significant progress has been made gaining approvals for the design. Furthermore, the NPS believes that the design will be fully approved in a timely fashion and that the visitor center can be completed and open to the public within the additional four years that H.R. 3689 would allow. Without the proposed extension, the Fund's current authority to establish this visitor center will expire on November 17, 2010. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to comment. This concludes my prepared remarks and I will be happy to answer any questions you or other committee members might have. Senator Udall. Thank you, Ms. Stevenson. I will recognize myself for a series of questions. Your testimony states that the administration believes that the designation of a World War I memorial at this time is premature, since there hasn't been a study yet. Do you have an estimate as to how long it would take and what it would cost? Ms. Stevenson. We ordinarily testify that between $200- and $300,000 is required for such a study and that it takes approximately 3 years. Senator Udall. Thank you for that clarification. As you know, the statue in Pershing Park is considered to be a World War I memorial. The cross in the Mohave National Preserve has been designated as a National Memorial commemorating World War I, as well. Do you think there should be a single official national World War I memorial, or whether it makes sense to have multiple recognized memorials? Ms. Stevenson. I believe we'll defer that answer to the Congress. Senator Udall. Thank you for that opportunity. [Laughter.] Senator Udall. My understanding is the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City is privately owned. Do you have any concerns with designating a private facility as a national memorial? Ms. Stevenson. That would depend on how the designation was written. We have other private buildings that are units in the National Park System, and agreements have been worked out. Senator Udall. You mentioned in your testimony that $7.3 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is available to restore the District of Columbia War Memorial. Do you know if these funds are sufficient to restore the memorial, or would additional funds be necessary? Ms. Stevenson. May I ask Mr. May to assist me with that question? Senator Udall. Of course. Mr. May, join us at the witness table and---- Mr. May. Thank you very much---- Senator Udall. Would you give your name and title, for the record, please. Mr. May. Certainly. Senator Udall. Thank you. Mr. May. Peter May, Associate Regional Director for Lands, Resources, and Planning for the National Capital Region of the National Parks Service. Senator Udall. Thank you, Mr. May. You're recognized. Mr. May. Thank you. We do believe that we have sufficient funds to complete the restoration of the DC World War I Memorial. Senator Udall. Thank you. Feel free to continue to sit at the witness table. Ms. Stevenson, let me turn to World War I and Civil War Commissions. With respect to those two bills authorizing Federal commissions to commemorate the anniversaries of the Civil War and World War I, just to clarify for the record, the administration supports the creation of both commissions, but wants to modify the way in which commission members are appointed in order to avoid appointments cause--clause conflicts. Is that correct? Ms. Stevenson. That is as we understand it. The Justice Department is the one that has raised that objection. So, it will be they who deal with you all. Senator Udall. Thank you for that clarification. Let me move to the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial. That is S. 2738, which would a be a new authorization for the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial. You object to a provision in the bill which finds that the subject matter of the proposed memorial is of preeminent and lasting significance to the United States, as required under the Commemorative Works Act. Given that the Secretary of the Interior and Congress has already made that determination for the previously authorized memorial, and since the subject of the new memorial is identical to the previously authorized one, why does the Park Service believe it's a problem to acknowledge that significance in this legislation? Ms. Stevenson. Mr. May. Senator Udall. Mr. May, you're recognized. Mr. May. Thank you. On a certain level, this is a matter of principle in the execution of the Commemorative Works Act. We believe that the Congress very wisely set a specific process for establishing when something is worthy of being in Area 1. We'd like to see that confirmed at this point for this memorial. Senator Udall. Thank you for that clarification. I have no further questions. I know Senator Burr, because of the busy nature of this week, and this day in particular, has been unable to join us immediately. He may well have questions for you, and I know you'll be willing to---- Ms. Stevenson. I'd be delighted to answer---- Senator Udall [continuing]. Answer those questions. Thank you for taking the time to---- Ms. Stevenson. Thank you, Senator. Senator Udall [continuing]. Come up to the Hill. We will see you again soon, I'm sure. Ms. Stevenson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Udall. As Ms. Stevenson, Mr. May depart, I'd ask the next panel to take your seats at the table, and we'll turn to your testimony. [Pause.] Senator Udall. Thank you. Good afternoon, to you panel members that have joined us. I'd like to turn to your"
