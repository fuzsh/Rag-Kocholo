Walter Miguel served in World War 1 with the United States Army. The enlistment was in 1918 and the service was completed in 1918.\n\nStory of Service\n\nWalter Wave Miguel (3802505) was born to Henry and Nellie Miguel in Arnolds Park, Iowa on Oct. 5, 1887. He was drafted and called into service July 22, 1918.\n\nWave received his training at Camp Pike near Little Rock, Arkansas before sailing for France on the Katoomba from the Port of New York Sept. 1, 1918. He was originally assigned to Company H of the 330th Infantry, but was transferred to the 5th Division’s 11th Infantry, Company L in mid-to-late October 1918.\n\nWave was killed on Nov. 10th by an artillery shell as the 11th Infantry fought to liberate the village of Louppy-sur-Loison during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Five other American soldiers were killed by the same blast: Pvt. Thomas Wade also of Company L (3270565—Lake City, Arkansas); Pvt. Miles G. Goleman, Company L (2660865, Greenup, Illinois); Cpl. Orval Boggs, Company L (2660977, Greenup, Illinois); Cpl. Henry Wilson Company G (736096, Jacksboro, Tennessee); and Pvt. Sherman H. Turner Company G (400196, Knoxville, Tennessee). They were initially buried where they fell but were reinterred next to each other at the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery June 18, 1919. All six were repatriated and sailed back to the United States together on the U.S.A.T. Wheaton. The ship left Antwerp Sept. 21, 1921.\n\nRead Walter Wave Miguel's entire Story of Service here.\n\nSubmit your family's Story of Service here."
