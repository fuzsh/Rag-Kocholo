        "text": "History and Honor\n\nYou are transported into the history of the battle. The illustrious and honorable history of the Marines deserved the tribute of this monumental undertaking. Adults and children alike are enthralled with the scope and realism of the exhibits here. It is clear the utmost care and respect were afforded this place, whose exhibits continue to be completed to this day.\n\nThe museum hosts events regularly one may partake in with a family-friendly atmosphere. The museum “honors the commitment, accomplishments, and sacrifice of the Marines” (National Museum of the Marine Corps). The Museum of the Marine Corps is a place to honor and reflect on those who have sacrificed so much for the United States.\n\nMuch More to Come\n\nYou discover there is much more to come as you encounter new exhibits in progress viewable from above. This exhibit featuring our Marines serving in Afghanistan is one example. There is always more to explore and learn at the museum of the Marine Corps. It is clear so much care and effort goes into this museum, and we can’t wait to see what exhibits are released next. Veterans, active service personnel, and civilians alike are sure to be moved and enthralled by this fascinating museum.\n\nEach new exhibit has clearly been created with the care and consideration worthy of the Marines. The exhibits here really unify the stories of brave Marines past and present. And the museum motivates you to return with future generations of Americans.\n\nHighest Participation in Military Service\n\nAccording to former U.S. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, “American Indians have proudly worn our nation’s uniform in every one of our conflicts… American Indians per capita have had the highest percentage of their people in military service, exceeding every American ethnic group.” (DENIX, 2023) The unwavering contributions of Native Americans during WWII are an inspiration to us all. Their bravery and ingenuity played a crucial role in the success of the United States and its allies in WWII, and we remain ever-grateful for their service.\n\nNative Americans in WWII\n\nAccording to the U.S. Dept. of Defense, more than 44,000 Native Americans served in the U.S. Military between 1941 and 1945, out of a population of less than 350,000 . (DENIX, 2023) This was a remarkable display of patriotism, considering that Native Americans were not guaranteed citizenship until 1924 with the passing of the Indian Citizenship Act, and some states continued to deny their voting rights until the 1950s. (Library of Congress, 2023) Additionally, according to the Library of Congress, “by 1932 the sale of both unclaimed land and allowed acreage resulted in the loss of two-thirds of the 138 million acres that Native Americans had held prior to the Dawes Act.” (Library of Congress, 2023) Their patriotism remained steadfast and loyal, despite these adversities. As the National Museum of the American Indian states, “Despite everything that American Indians had endured in the past, the warrior tradition—the tradition of protecting their people—called many of them to serve in the United States military.” (National Museum of the American Indian, 2020)\n\nA Declaration of War\n\nNative Americans served in combat and support roles, often distinguishing themselves for their bravery. Thomas Morgan explains that “Indians saw the Axis Powers as a threat to their liberty, and the Indian tribes responded patriotically. The Chippewa and Sioux joined the Iroquois in declaring war on the Axis. The Navajo… were extremely determined to serve.” (Morgan, T. D. (1995). Native Americans in World War II. Army History, 35, 22–27.) The Daily Mirror World Service announced that “Iroquois Braves Declare War” on the Axis Powers on September 26, 1942. (National Library of Australia, n.d.) The Axis powers would have never guessed that these Native Americans would become one of their greatest threats, and one of the most significant factors in the outcome of the war.\n\nCode Talking\n\nOne of the most well-known contributions of Native Americans was their use of their native languages as codes. Native Americans who served the military in this way are known as Code Talkers. The Navajo Code Talkers, for example, developed a code based on the complex Navajo language that was never broken by enemy forces. This code played a crucial role in communications during the Pacific island battles, saving countless lives and aiding in the United States’ victories. According to the National Museum of the Marine Corps., “They were indispensable members of reconnaissance missions and operated radio nets at key moments, such as the landing on Iwo Jima.” (The Navajo Code Talkers. Triangle, Virginia, National Museum of the Marine Corps, n.d.) And the National WWII Museum quotes 5th Marine Division signal officer Major Howard Connor, who stresses how critical the Code Talkers were to our operations: “Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.” (National WWII Museum, 2023)\n\nPreserving the “Code”\n\nWhile we recognize the service of these Veterans, let us also remember that America’s native languages are a national treasure. Their preservation is essential. According to the Administration for Native Americans, “Native languages have been in decline for decades; currently Ethnologue lists 245 indigenous languages in the United States, with 65 already extinct and 75 near extinction with only a few elder speakers left.” (hhs.gov, 2023) History implores us to reverse this trend.\n\nHonoring Our Veterans\n\nThe contributions of Native Americans in WWII exemplify the virtues of bravery, patriotism, dedication, and determination. Let us remember and honor their loyal service during Native American Heritage Month and always. To learn more about the Code Talkers, visit the Smithsonian’s engaging and informative interactive feature here.\n\nOf course we continue to honor all of our brave Veterans.

Both Windows PCs and Macs are vulnerable to a wide range of threats. To ensure the safety of your data and privacy, it’s crucial to take proactive measures and stay informed. In this comprehensive article, we’ll explore essential strategies for safeguarding your Windows PC or Mac from cybersecurity threats. Protecting your PC or Mac from cyber threats is more important than ever as digital integration into our daily lives becomes more and more prevalent.\n\nA Major Problem in the United States\n\nAccording to CompTIA, “The United States remains the most highly targeted country with 46% of global cyberattacks being directed towards Americans.” (CompTIA, 2023) This alarming statistic highlights the severe risks we face from adversaries in the digital environment. And it’s not just government agencies and major corporations being targeted. Pew Research Center indicates, “41% of Americans have encountered fraudulent charges on their credit cards” and “35% have received notices that some type of sensitive information (like an account number) had been compromised.” (PRC, 2017) We can all benefit from steps to protect our devices.\n\nSteps to Stay Safe\n\nFollow these steps to maximize the security of your PC or Mac:\n\n1. Install Reliable Antivirus Software\n\nSecure your Windows PC or Mac by installing a robust antivirus software package. These programs detect and eliminate malware, viruses, and other malicious entities lurking in your system. According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, “Anti-virus software looks for patterns based on the signatures or definitions of known malware.” (CISA, 2019) Hackers are constantly evolving their attacks, and your protections should be evolving with them.\n\nWith so many anti-virus software options available on the market, you may be wondering which one is right for you. Harvard University’s Information Security and Data Privacy department recommends activating the basic tools provided by your operating system. They also suggest considering the free tools available from Avast and Bitdefender. Further, they advise awareness of what renewal costs may be incurred, how many devices are included, and what features are available in any anti-virus package you are considering. Learn more in Choosing Personal Anti-Virus Software. (Harvard, 2023)\n\n2. Keep Your Operating System Updated\n\nDon’t overlook the importance of regularly updating your Windows or Mac operating system. They are not a “one and done” installation and require frequent updates. These updates fix vulnerabilities and protect your system from potential exploits. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency emphasizes the significance of maintaining up-to-date operating systems. (CISA, 2023) Both Microsoft and Apple provide instructions for keeping your operating system updated online. For Windows, refer to Get the Latest Windows Update. For Mac, visit Keep Your Mac Up-to-Date.\n\n3. Activate and Configure Firewall Protection\n\nAdd an extra layer of security to your computer by enabling and correctly configuring the built-in firewall. Firewalls act as a protective barrier against internet threats. Microsoft offers comprehensive guidance on effectively using the Windows Firewall. Learn more at Turn On Your Windows Defender Firewall. MacOS also provides a built-in firewall. To learn more, visit Firewall Security in MacOS. Stop the threats you can from infiltrating your computer in the first place so you don’t even need to deal with catching them and removing them later.\n\n4. Exercise Caution with Downloads and Email Attachments\n\nBe cautious when downloading files and handling email attachments, as they are common targets for malware. According to the Federal Trade Commission, “Scammers use email or text messages to try to steal your passwords, account numbers, or Social Security number.” (FTC, 2022) The FTC provides additional, valuable guidance on recognizing and avoiding email scams and malicious downloads in their article How to Recognize and Avoid Phishing Scams.\n\n5. Utilize Strong, Unique Passwords and Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\n\nPassword security is paramount for protecting your Windows PC and Mac. Use strong, complex passwords with a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. To further enhance security, enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) whenever possible. MFA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring multiple forms of verification. Boston University asserts that MFA “is essential to web security because it immediately neutralizes the risks associated with compromised passwords.” (BU, 2023)\n\nCreating passwords that are both difficult for adversaries to crack and easy for you to remember can be challenging. Resist the temptation to use familiar names and important dates. The National Council on Aging recommends using a phrase instead of a single word, shorthand that makes sense to only you, or creating a “code” from a complete sentence. (NCO, 2021) Learn more from How to Create Strong Passwords: A Simple Guide.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy following these essential tips, you can substantially reduce the risk to your Windows PC and Mac. Protecting your PC or Mac from cyber threats should be a top priority for anyone who wants to protect their data, identity, and property. Remember, cybersecurity requires continuous effort and vigilance. Stay ahead of evolving threats by regularly updating your knowledge and security measures. Ensure a safe and secure digital environment for your devices by adhering to best practices and staying informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity.\n\nNow that you’ve achieved security for your computer, perhaps you’re seeking a remote career?

But many feel it’s important to include paying homage to those who have served into our routines throughout the year. The start of a new year is a good time to consider these goals and how we can fulfill them. Places like Merritt Island’s Veterans Memorial Park provide an excellent opportunity to relax and reflect on the contribution that our veterans have made in preserving the freedoms of our homeland and those of our allies. Whenever you plan a visit to a park, you may want to consider visiting a veterans’ park such as this one. Consequently, the experience is likely to be very rewarding.\n\nAs former President Ronald Reagan has said, “Our hearts and thoughts turn to all the Nation’s veterans. Let us reflect on the great achievements of those whose sacrifices preserved our freedom and our way of life. With a spirit of pride and gratitude, let us recall their heroic accomplishments and thank them for their unselfish devotion to duty.” (reaganlibrary.gov). And specifically to the Marines he remarked, “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in this world. The Marines don’t have that problem” (marines.mil). Indeed, the difference veterans have made for our country and in our lives is immense.\n\nStrength and Freedom\n\nMany moving monuments dedicated to our veterans who served in wars from the American Revolutionary War in 1776 to the present are thoughtfully displayed throughout the park. This monument to those who served in the Revolutionary War (pictured above) is “Dedicated to all our patriot ancestors who sacrificed their lives, families and fortunes to secure our freedom.” The monument is topped by the statue of a bald eagle, and a Minuteman is inscribed on the front.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the American Bald Eagle has been the national bird since 1782. Former President John F. Kennedy voiced his appreciation for this choice: “The Founding Fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation. The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird aptly symbolizes the strength and freedom of America” [va.gov (PDF)]. Given the strength, courage, and dedication to preserving our freedom that our veterans exhibit, the eagle is indeed a fitting symbol for our country and for such a monument.\n\nTanks for the Memories\n\nThe Merritt Island Veterans Park is home to an impressive collection of historic military air and land vehicles. Dwight D. Eisenhower has said, “Guns and tanks and planes are nothing unless there is a solid spirit, a solid heart, and great productiveness behind it” (eisenhowerlibrary.gov). While this is undeniably true, the equipment used by the military has played a vital role in our military history. The park satisfies the nostalgia surrounding this critical equipment that both serves and protects our armed forces.\n\nMany historic vehicles are punctuated around the park, including this M41 Walker Bulldog American light tank (pictured above). The placard informs the visitor of the illustrious history of this vehicle. This impressive tank replaced the M24 Chaffee Tank used in WWII and was used for nine years by South Vietnam. It was produced between 1951-1954 in Cleveland, Ohio by the Cadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors. Further, it houses a crew of four soldiers. These tanks have served worldwide in 30 countries, including engaging T-34s during the Bay of Pigs. All of the air and land vehicles displayed throughout the park give a detailed history that is both educational and fascinating.\n\nFlying for Freedom\n\nIn addition to land vehicles, the park houses multiple intriguing aircraft. This A-7E Corsair II Carrier-Based Attack Bomber (pictured above) flew at a maximum speed of 693 miles per hour at sea level. Six wing stations provided a combined maximum load of up to 10,000 lb. of bombs, rockets, or AGMs (air-to-ground). Its tactical range was 490 miles. The crew consisted of a pilot only, and 535 of these aircraft were produced.\n\nThe U.S. Navy describes the distinguished history of the A-7E Corsair II: “The A-7E flew its first combat missions over Vietnam in May 1970… Following the end of the Vietnam War, the A-7E remained a mainstay on carrier flight decks, called into combat action throughout the 1980s in Grenada, Lebanon, Libya, and Panama. By the time Navy carriers launched their first strikes into Iraq and Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Storm in January 1991, only two A-7E squadrons remained… It marked the final deployment of the venerable Corsair II, whose beginning and end came in the face of enemy fire.” (history.navy.mil).\n\nNo Military Without Moms\n\nActive duty military members and veterans display tremendous courage, dedication, patriotism, and mental and physical fortitude. But there are unsung heroes residing in their shadows that I want to honor today: moms of military members. Their service and sacrifice to their children in the military, their military, and their country merits remembering and honoring. There are no soldiers, airmen, or sailors – and no military – without them.\n\nThe Profound Challenges of Military Moms\n\nAs a mother of two sets of twins, I can certainly attest to the challenges faced by mothers – all mothers. Raising children the right way so that they evolve and grow into well-rounded, responsible adults who lead lives of integrity is perhaps the hardest, yet most rewarding duty a person can have. And as the mother of a U.S. Army soldier, I can attest to the unique and particularly profound challenges of being a military mom. This role is one that is constantly testing your perseverance, and one that is ever-reminding you of what’s truly most important in life – to never take your loved ones for granted.\n\nA New Chapter\n\nWhen my son wanted to discuss his interest in joining the Army, I had conflicted feelings. It was a lot to sort through in my mind. I had so many burning questions. Would he stay safe? Would he be happy? How would he adjust to this new life? How would I adjust? Would he survive Boot Camp? Above all of these feelings and considerations, however, I was proud of him because of what it means to serve your country in the military. I was proud of his desire to serve alongside other men and women who exemplify the traits of courage, dedication, and selflessness that are required to serve in the military.\n\nNever Asked for “Easy”\n\nMy son followed his ambition, and I encouraged him to do what was right for him. Fast forward a few years, and my son is enjoying a successful career in the Army. Turns out, it really was the right choice for him. It has certainly not been easy, but given the traits that lead someone to join the military in the first place, is someone like that really ever seeking “easy?” My son has no regrets and has gained very valuable career and life experience that will serve his future well.\n\nServing with Honor\n\nBeing the mother of a military member often means missing out on holidays and family celebrations with your son(s) or daughter(s). It can mean rarely seeing the children you raised day-in and day-out for so long. Most challenging of all, it can mean worry and anxiety over your child’s safety and/or well-being – particularly in times of military engagement overseas. This may be especially true if your son(s) or daughter(s) is not able, for security or communication restraint reasons, to divulge the details of what they are doing or where they are. It takes great strength and perseverance to be the mom of someone serving in the military. Moms must be strong for their sons and daughters of whom they are so proud. And those who serve honor the moms who raised them by serving their country with honor.\n\nAll Grown Up Now\n\nAs any mother knows, they grow up so fast… This may be more true than ever when your son or daughter joins the military. Your child is fully embracing adulthood, with the weight of responsibility, discipline, work ethic, and commitment that come from experience in the military. Despite that, they’ll always be our babies, regardless of their chronological age. It will always be tough to watch them embark on this exciting journey alone. When we do see them, we cherish that time more than we ever could have envisioned. The impact of the distance and concerns moms have, which can be amplified when their child is in the military, are profoundly felt.\n\nSeeking Support\n\nAre you the mom of a military member (or members) who is wondering where to turn for support? “Today’s Military” offers a wealth of links to support resources for Moms with children serving in different branches of the military here. You are there for your children, now let others in the military community be there for you. Whether your child is in the Army, National Guard, Marines, Air Force, Navy, or Coast Guard, you will find tools to help you there.\n\nActive-Duty Moms in the Military\n\nI want to mention another group of moms who deserve recognition. They are the moms currently serving in the military who must endure so much time separated from their families in service to their country. Their sacrifice is tremendous, and we owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. To all of you moms that are serving in the military, thank you so much for your service and sacrifice.\n\nWe are always mindful of the sacrifice active-duty military members and veterans have made in service to our great country and people.

As an intern at Global Dimensions for eight months and counting, I can confidently say that my time here has been among my most impactful and formative internship experiences. Over the course of my time here, I’ve had the opportunity to work on an interesting and diverse range of projects. These projects covered most steps of the international business process. I worked through the initial stages of researching foreign markets and regulations to every step of the establishment process. I have even had the opportunity to use my foreign language skills to find business opportunities and translate documents. More importantly, I have never felt that my time was being wasted on busywork. I feel that I am adding value to the company’s mission and goals with every assignment.\n\nA True Team Member\n\nGlobal Dimensions offers opportunities to learn more about different parts of the industry and contribute my knowledge and experience to company operations. But it also offers a unique work environment. Interns for many companies are subject to micromanagement and fluff. This is not the case at Global Dimensions. Furthermore, communication is no-frills and straightforward. My supervisor Jim is respectful of my time. He trusts me to get work done on a flexible schedule and without constant supervision. At the same time, all of the staff I’ve had the pleasure of interacting with are extremely helpful and understanding. I am kept updated on the company’s international operations. And this is the case even when the matter doesn’t directly concern me. In other words, I’m treated as a full team member with a stake in the company’s success despite only interning part-time.\n\nFind International Business Internships\n\nThe wide range of meaningful assignments and the hands-off and respectful work environment are what make Global Dimensions a unique place to work. I would highly recommend an internship here for anyone interested in international business and taking a leading role in growing a company overseas. For more information about internships at Global Dimensions, visit their Careers page, or view openings on Handshake.\n\nBy Maximilian Dunat\n\nMy Favorite Internship\n\nOf the many jobs and internships I’ve had, my time at Global Dimensions has far and away been my favorite. From meeting new people to learning new skills to having new experiences, this internship has been a diverse learning experience. At Global Dimensions I’ve never felt like anything less than a valued member of the team. In my experience, that isn’t all that common with an internship.\n\nAmazing Training Opportunities\n\nLast August I had the chance to attend a two-day training on foreign military sales. It was an incredible opportunity since most companies would not pay for an intern to get such training, and I learned a lot. I’ve also gained experience in a range of government processes and been able to apply that knowledge on a variety of projects. As an international affairs major, the international aspects of this internship have been particularly interesting and applicable. Through my research about a variety of countries Global Dimensions has looked at for doing business I have gained knowledge that I have used in my classes and will use at future jobs. I have also had the chance to do more in depth research about countries that are in my area of interest. This has been particularly helpful because it overlaps with topics in my classes.\n\nProfessional and Personal Balance\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this internship is the leeway I have when it comes to doing my work. My supervisor trusts me to get things done on my own time. He encourages me to prioritize my schoolwork over assignments that are not time sensitive. This is extremely helpful in creating a good work-life-school balance and, in my opinion, the optimal way to do an internship. At the same time, I feel like I am held to a high standard of work. Since beginning this internship, the quality of my work has improved because of feedback from my supervisor.\n\nInternational Business Internship\n\nOverall, working at Global Dimensions has been a very positive experience. I don’t feel like I’ve been treated any differently than other employees because I am an intern, and everyone has been welcoming and helpful. I have learned a lot in a variety of topics, and it is knowledge that I will take with me going forward because it is applicable in the field I am pursuing.

It all started when I moved to Washington D.C. in August, 2018 for school. Before that, I had visited D.C. a handful of times, mostly on school trips. On those school trips we visited the museums, the White House, and the Capitol. It was Normal fifth grade stuff. And while the monuments and museums are certainly part of the experience of living in D.C., they fade into the background of everyday life when you become a resident here.\n\nWhat were incredibly special places for me as a fifth grader became places where I need to fight my way through hordes of tourists and school field trip groups to get to ultimate frisbee practice. Because the history of the United States is so prevalent and visible here, it is easy to take it for granted.\n\nThe Normalization of Politics\n\nAt least three times a week my commute takes me past the iconic Lincoln Memorial. My university ultimate frisbee team practices on the National Mall next to the renowned Reflecting Pool. A few weeks ago, HBO shut down part of Virginia Avenue near my apartment because they were filming a show about Watergate. And within a few blocks of my apartment are the Embassies of Egypt, Argentina, Spain, Tajikistan, Saudi Arabia, Kosovo, and Qatar. The International Monetary Fund and the State Department are a five-minute walk. I and many people I know have interned in some capacity for the Federal Government. Election night watch parties are a common occurrence, even in off years.\n\nBreathing Rarified Air\n\nI lived across the street from Kamala Harris before she was elected Vice President. I saw Elizabeth Warren jogging on the Mall with her dog. This became a normal part of life. Waiting for the Presidential motorcade to pass is more noteworthy for being an annoyance than for possibly getting to see Joe Biden. D.C. is a different city for the people who live here. Politicians are no longer mythical figures on T.V. They are your neighbors.\n\nCatch a Museum\n\nAfter living amidst the buzz, the Federal Government stops being exciting. So, we have to seek other sources of entertainment. There are many Smithsonian museums devoid of throngs of fifth graders. The Renwick Gallery is my favorite. It has a gallery of rotating exhibits featuring work from younger, less established artists. Another good one is the Hirshhorn. It can get crowded, but you generally won’t see any field trip groups while you are there. The Hirshhorn holds the permanent collection of Joseph Hirshhorn in addition to rotating modern art exhibits. All the Smithsonian museums are completely free to access. They have been free since 1846. However, some museums, like the African American History Museum, require you to reserve a free ticket.\n\nD.C. Sports\n\nIt could be argued Washington sports teams have a reputation for being bad, at least recently… Sometimes the Nationals’ World Series win in 2019 and Capitals’ Stanley Cup win in 2018 seem like distant memories. Fortunately, this is reflected in D.C. team ticket prices. Wizards, Nationals, and D.C. United tickets are all pretty cheap. In addition, most of the stadiums are super easy to get to and in great neighborhoods. Capital One Arena, where the Wizards and Capitals play, is in the middle of Chinatown, and Nat’s Park and Audi Field are in Navy Yard. Chinatown has a bunch of great Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants, such as Pho 88, as well as bars like Jackpot. On game days Navy Yard comes alive with fans flocking to places like Dacha Beer Garden and Swizzler. What used to be one of the rougher parts of town, the Navy Yard is now one of the hottest areas in D.C. with great restaurants and high-end condos.\n\nA Night Out\n\nAdams Morgan has been the place for young counterculture people since before my parents lived in D.C. twenty-five years ago. It is still host to many great bars and restaurants. Colombia Station has live Jazz music and Jumbo Slice Pizza has slices bigger than your head. All the bars turn into clubs after 10 p.m., so plan your trip accordingly. NOMA and the H St. corridor are home to some great restaurants like The Big Board, but walking around the neighborhood is not as pleasant at night because H St. can get pretty busy.\n\nBrunch on the Waterfront\n\nAfter a night of partying, walking around Georgetown is a great way to clear your head. If you are hungry, the many brunch spots, like Call Your Mother, are a great way to wait in line for a breakfast sandwich that is totally worth the thirty-minute wait. If you order online ahead of time you can reduce the wait time. You can take your sandwich to the Georgetown Waterfront where people spread out blankets and watch the activity on the Potomac River while listening to music or reading. Alternatively, you can walk through the residential part of Georgetown where there are beautiful old houses you can fantasize about owning.\n\nLiving in the Nation’s Capital\n\nOne of my favorite memories of D.C. is of walking through Georgetown. It was the morning of a warm fall day but the air hadn’t quite heated up yet. The leaves had already changed color and were beginning to fall off the trees in a fiery-shaded flurry. It had rained the night before, so everything smelled like wet leaves. Most people hadn’t started their day yet and it was quiet. I remember standing in the brilliant sun, as a breeze shook some dewy leaves from a tree across the street, just thinking. Sometimes our Nation’s Capital is at its best when you retreat from the craziness of the tourist crowds and political stage and experience D.C.’s less-traveled neighborhoods. If you are visiting, I hope you’ll take some time to explore my D.C.\n\nReady to slow down from the excitement of the city?

At my very first internship, I worked 20 hours every week, I was surrounded by a group of renowned researchers, and I learned how to refill massive coffee dispensers. In other words, I was not entirely happy with my experience. As a student and an intern, I discovered there is no point working in the same office as people well-versed in the field if there is no opportunity to learn from them. Fortunately, my internship experiences since then have improved substantially. I was able to work on projects that actually piqued my interest, and found people that challenged me to improve. Of all my internship opportunities, my time at Global Dimensions certainly takes the cake. I could not be more thrilled to work with such an incredible and welcoming team!\n\nExposure to Different Projects\n\nInterns at Global Dimensions can expect great variety in the types of tasks they are assigned. It has been five full months since I came onboard, and it would take me a minute to recall all of the different projects I have worked on since. Firstly, I have created presentations. Secondly, I have learned the ins and outs of the Workable recruiting platform. Thirdly, I have conducted phone screens, and created a company survey. These are just to name a few of the things I have done or learned how to do while at Global D. The variety encourages me to keep producing my best work and learn something new every day.\n\nFor a past internship, I conducted monotonous data collection and data entry. It got old after a while… The urge to count down the hours until the end of the shift was a familiar occurrence. I am very happy to say that I have never felt that way while interning at Global D. I appreciate the constant possibility of new assignments and different kinds of projects from week-to-week. The variety encourages a certain level of enthusiasm that underscores the time spent clocked in. Not only that, the different responsibilities greatly enhance my professional development. And they instill transferable skills that are useful now and will continue to be in the long run.\n\nRespect: A Rare Commodity in the Internship World\n\nAnother key part of the internship experience at Global D. is respect. This vital commodity is often, unfortunately, hard to come by in an internship environment. As team members who may be newer to the industry than their colleagues, many interns experience a certain level of condescension from superiors. It can be a bit disorienting because that attitude breeds discouragement, and can cause interns to question themselves and their abilities.\n\nAt Global D., it is absolutely the opposite. Everyone on the recruiting team has always excelled at making me feel like a valued member of the group. Even in individual meetings and conversation, there is never the sense of feeling like a less valuable contributor. Interns’ ideas and input are always appreciated and that appreciation is clearly expressed. In addition, it is not simply assumed that you know your contribution matters. Jeff, my supervisor, and the rest have always gone above and beyond to communicate the extent of their appreciation. It is a very unique feeling as an intern, and I am beyond grateful for it. Having a great work community and work relationships is essential to putting out one’s best work, and I look forward to meetings as opportunities to hear from everyone.\n\nKeeping it Real When No One Else Does\n\nThe team at Global D. also promotes a culture of keeping it real: there is no need for beating around the bush, being indirect or unclear, or using unnecessary flowery language. That applies to interns too. There is no need to show-off or to try to win over anyone by stepping on anyone else’s toes. We are honest with each other about what we want, our thoughts, our needs, and our visions- and that cultivates strength. The culture of honesty has resulted in genuine bonds and strong regard for coworkers.\n\nThe company culture at Global D. is certainly unique in all the best ways possible, and interning with the Operations team is an amazing opportunity. Anyone who joins the internship team can expect to be surrounded by (virtually) a great group of professionals who are always rooting for everyone’s growth and development. I could not be more thrilled to intern here and learn so much from the work and from my colleagues, especially in my last year of college.\n\nInternship experiences are cherished parts of the college experience. They are even more special when you actually have a fun time interning with people who have really taken the time to get to know you. I would highly recommend prospective interns to visit Global D.’s Careers page and monitor for internship postings on Handshake!\n\nby Ayesha Khan"
