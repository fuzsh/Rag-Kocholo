        "text": "The Brookline Monument, better known as \"The Cannon,\" has been a mainstay on the boulevard\n\nfor many years, dating back to 1935. It is the showpiece of our local Veterans Memorial,\n\nor the Brookline Boulevard Triangle Park as it is officially known on the city register.\n\n♦ A Gathering Place\n\n♦ Freehold Real Estate\n\n♦ Flag Raising and Plaque\n\n♦ A Permanent Memorial\n\n♦ The Original Cannon\n\n♦ Our Schneider Howitzer\n\n♦ Updates and Upgrades\n\n♦ Old Soldiers\n\n♦ Memorial Day Parade\n\n♦ Honor Roll Plaque\n\n♦ Military Casualty Lists\n\n♦ Veteran's Remembrances\n\nNewspaper Clippings ♦\n\nRationing/Bonds/Banners ♦\n\nPTSD and the Military ♦\n\nPost #540 Honor Roll ♦\n\n4.7 inch M1906 ♦\n\n155mm Schneider ♦\n\nThe Cannon - 1982 ♦\n\nThe Cannon - 2013 ♦\n\nCaretaker Dan McKeever ♦\n\nFresh Coat of Snow ♦\n\nPAT Bus Crash - 2017 ♦\n\nHoliday Decorations ♦\n\n* Last Modified: September 22, 2022 *\n\nCommunity Gathering Place\n\nThe war memorial is located on the small triangular shaped island situated between Brookline Boulevard, Queensboro and Chelton Avenues. The cannon, a World War I artillery piece, honors the legacy of Brookline's fighting men and women in arms as it quietly stands watch over the Commerical District.\n\nSituated at the heart of the community and often simply referred to as \"The Cannon,\" the tiny parklet has become a familiar gathering place, either for an event or just to get together with friends. \"We'll Meet at the Cannon\" is phrase familiar to anyone who has called Brookline home.\n\nAt the entrance to the park is a fine pink granite Memorial Bench adorned with with three bronze memorial plaques. The one on the rear of the bench, above the planter, is \"In Memory of All American Veterans.\" Another is placed on the lower part of the bench honoring \"The Veterans of Brookline,\" our local military men and women that have served in the various conflicts from World War I through the Persian Gulf War.\n\nThe most recent addition is the Brookline Honor Roll plaque, dedicated on August 31, 2019. Placed on the front of the bench, it honors the fifty-six local soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that lost their lives during the wars of the 20th Century. By the grace of God there have been no local casualties since during the War on Terror in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe park contains a few other park benches, a flag pole and a flower garden. Each year, the local Memorial Day Parade begins at the Veteran's Memorial. The parade is preceeded by a somber ceremony in honor of those who fell in battle.\n\nMany Brookline residents and casual passers-by, however, are unaware of the true significance of this small park, and the sacrifices made by Brookliners over the past century in the service of our country. It is in their honor that this park exists, and it is our duty to tell that tale on this webpage, thus keeping their stories, and memories, alive in our hearts and minds.\n\nFormer Site of the Freehold Real Estate Office\n\nIn 1905, when the Brookline section of the former West Liberty Borough was undergoing the transformation from a rural farming district into a modern residential and commercial community, the Freehold Real Estate Company established a small sales office on the triangle. The original one-room wooden shack was replaced by a two-room brick building in 1912. The office was a busy place for many years as the community grew.\n\nThe Freehold Real Estate office along Brookline Boulevard in 1910 (left) and again in 1913.\n\nAs for ownership of the triangle, Freehold owned the larger share of the property, and the City of Pittsburgh owned the rest, located near the tip of the triangle that pointed in the direction of the developing Brookline Boulevard Commercial district.\n\nFirst Flag Raising and Memorial Plaque\n\nOn October 20, 1917, the Boy Scouts held the first flag raising ceremony and in November 1919, a city ordinance was enacted allowing the Brookline Board of Trade to place a bronze Memorial Tablet \"Commemorating the Achievements of Brookline World War Heroes.\" This was placed on the city owned portion of the triangle.\n\nThen, in 1932, as a result of the financial crisis caused by the onset of the Great Depression, the Freehold Office in Brookline was closed. Their land was sold to James McGaffin, a prominent Brookline businessman and owner of the McGaffin Construction Company. The old Freehold office was razed in the fall of 1933.\n\nA Permanent Memorial\n\nDespite the struggling economy, the 1930s were a time of great change in Brookline. The Joint Civic Committee was busy working on many initiatives to help modernize and improve the community. One such project was to establish a larger Veteran's Memorial to honor Brookline soldiers who fought in World War I.\n\nOn April 18, 1934, James McGaffin sold his portion of the triangle to the city for the purpose of establishing a permanent memorial. The cost of the transfer was $5750, and the land was designated as the Brookline Boulevard Triangle Park.\n\nOn July 4, 1935, before the start of the annual Independence Day Parade, members of Brookline's American Legion Post #540, formed just two months prior to that in May 1935, dedicated a white marble Memorial Bench. Bolted to the bench was the original bronze Memorial Tablet originally dedicated in 1919.\n\nMembers of the local American Legion Post #540 dedicate the original white marble\n\nMemorial Bench at the Brookline Boulevard Triangle Park on July 4, 1935.\n\nSoon afterwards, The United States Department of the Interior granted the American Legion Post #540 the loan of a government surplus artillery piece to be placed on the triangle as another local monument to Brookline Veteran's. It was placed on a concrete pad with the gun barrel facing towards the Commercial District.\n\nOther additions to the Veteran's Memorial continued in the years that followed. On Memorial Day, 1937, the American Legion Post #540 and the Brookline Americanism Committee, headed by Mary E. Laitta, dedicated a flag pole.\n\nIn the spring of 1939, the Pittsburgh Department of Public Works spent $1600 to build a retaining wall along the Chelton Avenue side of the park to level the land, install additional concrete paving and metal fencing around the memorial, as well as providing new landscaping and other improvements.\n\nThe Original Cannon (1935-1942)\n\nThe present-day Cannon is actually the second rendition of the monument. The granite memorial bench itself is also a replacement. The original cannon was a surplus World War I American field artillery piece. It's official designation was 4.7 inch Gun M1906.\n\nAn American howitzer, the 4.7 inch Gun M1906, is shown here on May 21, 1939\n\nat the Brookline Veteran's Memorial in Triangle Park.\n\nThe original howitzer, dedicated in 1938, stood for four years, until another global conflict called it back into service. This time, the cannon was not headed for the front lines in Europe. It was, instead, heading to Jones and Laughlin Steel. The World War I artillery piece was donated by the American Legion to the J&L Mill in Hazelwood to be melted down during a scrap metal drive for World War II.\n\nAmerican Legion Post #540 members stand by Brookline's original Cannon.\n\nIt happened on October 13, 1942, when John Renner, a foreman at the J&L 16-inch roller, and George Winslow, superintendent of the mill's Hazelwood polishing plant and senior vice-commander of the Brookline Legion Post 540, held a small ceremony before the 4.7 inch cannon was again carted off to war, this time against the empire of Japan. The cannon was inscribed \"To Japan via U.S. Armed Forces.\"\n\nBrookline's original Cannon being hauled away for scrap metal on October 13, 1942.\n\nOur Schneider Howitzer\n\nAfter World War II, an Army surplus howitzer was obtained on loan from the Department of the Interior as a replacement for the original cannon. The current model 1917 Schneider 155mm howitzer was installed and the park re-dedicated in 1946. In the spring of 2021 Brookline residents celebrated seventy-five years with their now iconic Schneider howitzer.\n\nThe Cannon is arguably the most recognizable feature on Brookline Boulevard and has always been a favorite amongst decades of youngsters who love to climb aboard and spin the wheels.\n\nAlthough it still federal property and belongs to the Department of the Interior, our Schneider howitzer is something Brookliners have claimed as their own, as shown by the outpouring of concern caused by the bus crash on July 8, 2017.\n\nFor decades, children have been fascinated by the Cannon at the Veteran's Memorial.\n\nUpdates and Upgrades\n\nThe aging white marble Veteran's memorial bench was replaced with the present-day polished pink granite bench in 1995. At that time the old World War I bronze tablet was replaced with two new bronze memorials, one to all American veterans, including references to the conflicts from World War I to the Persian Gulf War, and another dedicated to local veterans from the Brookline community.\n\nThe pink granite bench in 2000 with the bronze veteran's plaques in the original configuration as installed in 1995.\n\nThe upper plaque was moved to the rear of the bench in 2019, replaced by a larger Brookline Honor Roll plaque.\n\nOld Soldiers\n\nBrookline's Veteran's Memorial Park has always been popular gathering place. Several generations of Brookliners have uttered the words, \"I'll meet you at the cannon.\"\n\nSometimes the park benches are just a nice place to sit down and enjoy a relaxing moment, either alone or with friends.\n\nFor the three gentlemen captured in this Robert Daley print, entitled \"Old Soldiers,\" this meeting at the park was something of a casual reunion of Veteran's. On a crisp fall morning, the old soldiers have gathered near the cannon to chat about the day's events.\n\nThe average pedestrian would pass them by without much thought, not realizing what sacrifices these brave men had made so many years ago on the battlefields of far away places. They had been to hell and back, an experience that only a veteran can understand. They share a common bond, one that is forged in the cauldron of war.\n\nThese fine men were part of our Greatest Generation and oh, what stories they could tell.\n\nBrookline's snow-covered cannon on December 29, 2012.\n\nSouth Hills Memorial Day Parade\n\nEvery Memorial Day, beginning in 1934, the South Hills Memorial Day Parade Association hosts the annual Memorial Day Parade. The event begins at the Brookline Veterans Memorial with the opening ceremony.\n\nThe parade then follows a 2.2 mile route from the cannon along Brookline Boulevard, Pioneer Avenue and West Liberty Avenue. The procession ends at Mount Lebanon Cemetery, where a closing ceremony is held. The parade is a fun, yet somber event honoring local soldiers who gave their lives in the service of our country.\n\nFrank F. DeBor, the owner of DeBor Funeral Home and Commander of the American Legion Post #540 lays a wreath\n\non the memorial bench in Triangle Park prior to the start of the 1954 Memorial Day Parade.\n\nAt the Memorial Day Parade in 2010, I was struck by the fact that nobody could recite the names of Brookline's fallen heroes, those whose sacrifice was being celebrated that day.\n\nMy curiosity led me on fruitless searches to the local American Legion, nearby VFW and the Brookline library. It seemed so wrong that our proud community, unlike others like Beechview, Carrick, Dormont and Mount Lebanon, had no record of the native sons that died in war.\n\nBrookliners gather at the Veteran's Memorial for the Memorial Day ceremony before the parade in May 1960.\n\nWith this in mind, Doug Brendel and myself took it upon ourselves to research this topic and learn the names. We scoured the casulty lists of old archived Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Mount Washington Times and Brookline Journal editions.\n\nIt took a few months, but in the end we had identified the names of fifty-six Brookline natives who perished during the WWI, WWII, Korean and Vietnam Wars.\n\nAlong with these fifty-six brave souls, we also learned of many Brookliners who suffered wounds and many others who were held as Prisoner of War. By the time of the Memorial Day Parade of 2018, it was with pride that we could present the names listed below in the casualty section of this webpage.\n\nThese are the heroes celebrated on Memorial Day, and may their sacrifices never be forgotten by the generations of Brookliners who live under the blanket of freedom they helped to provide.\n\nDedication of Honor Roll Plaque - August 2019\n\nAt noon on Saturday, August 31, 2019, a dedication was held at the Brookline Veteran's Park and War Memorial to dedicate a beautiful bronze Honor Roll plaque listing the fifty-six soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines that lost their lives during the conflicts of the 20th Century (World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam). The plaque was commissioned by Brookline Historical Society members Clint Burton and Doug Brendel. The names of those soldiers are listed on this page in the local casualty lists section.\n\nHonor Roll Dedication Page with Recap and Over 150 Photos\n\nBrookline Military Casualty Lists\n\n♦ World War I ♦ ♦ World War II ♦ ♦ Korean War ♦\n\n♦ Vietnam War ♦ ♦ War on Terror ♦\n\nListed below are many of the sons of Brookline who gave their\n\nlives to preserve freedom and contain aggression during\n\nWorld War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam.\n\nIt is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died.\n\nRather, we should thank God that such men lived.\n\nGeneral George S.

All names listed have been verified as casualties through the National Archives (Army and Navy) or the Defense POW/Missing Persons Office online resources. The home of record is listed as the address of the soldier's next-of-kin.\n\nAs for our World War I and World War II research, we've made every attempt to be as accurate and thorough as possible. These daily published lists were the only consistant resource available for the Army and Navy's World War I and World War II records containing street addresses. Hence, it is possible that we may have omitted names that should be present on this record. It is also possible that Brookline natives who moved to another city or state may not be identified as being from Pennsylvania, therefore not recorded here. We really did do our best to get this right.\n\nA Work In Progress\n\nThis page is an ongoing project. Our research will continue on this casualty list. Our goal is to present the most accurate account possible of Brookline's fallen servicemen with the admiration, respect and honor befitting their sacrifice.\n\nSpecial thanks to Doug Brendel, Michael Brendel, John Rudiak, Carol Anthony, David Wonn,\n\nJohn Turanin, Rosario Scumaci for their research assistance.\n\nThe National Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota on a June morning.\n\nPhoto from the Minneapolis Star/Tribune - 2012.\n\nAdditional World War II Information\n\nOur research into World War II casualty lists also uncovered several postings regarding local soldiers that were wounded, missing or held as prisoners.

Chief Murray than spoke to the boys and girls about the importance of continued effort in gathering scrap metal.\n\n\"I am very well pleased with the splendid manner in which all of you First Class Privates, Corporals and Sergeants are turning in scrap. Remember, boys and girls, it is the scrap that makes the equipment which is necessary to win the war. Keep up the good work; but make sure you ask permission before taking scrap from any property.\n\n\"Also keep in mind that a Commando must be polite and courteous, and above all, must perform his or her job in a quiet manner.\n\nAll Junior Commandos who have reported collections of 200 pounds of scrap metal or more have been invited by mail to see the Pittsburgh Steelers wallop the New York Giants at Forbes Field on Sunday, October fourth. The squads of those who reported collections will also receive tickets - all for free!\n\nTwo Brookline Junior Commandos, along with their squads, have collected over a whopping 9400 pounds each. James McKenna and Herbert Swann will join 45 other commandos from around the city in ceremoniously having their names engraved on a 30-ton tank that will one day be trundling after the enemies of our country.\n\nNOTE: James McKenna, an army Silver Star recipient, lost his life in the Korean War.

The girls trained once a week at the No. 1 Police Station shooting range.\n\nIn this December 21, 1941 Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph photo Rosemary and Patsy Shenkel receive\n\nNational Rifle Association medals from Troop #77 Scout Leader Mrs. Florence Galvin.\n\nThe Brookline girls were also very active during the war years holding benefit dances to raise money for special charities such as the American Red Cross, Salvation Army and the March of Dimes. The ladies would knit and sew for the Red Cross and make holiday favors for the Veteran's Hospital. All of the girls were instructed in Red Cross home nursing and first aid.\n\nOne of their most successful projects was preparing gift packages for servicemen that were distributed at the USO lounge on Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh. Each package contained three postal cards, three candy bars, cigarettes and chewing gum. The troop received many appreciative letters from soldiers who received these packages.\n\nOne of those letters read:\n\n\"I am a soldier in the Air Corps. I just arrived in Chicago from my home in Nutley, New Jersey, where I ahve been on a ten-day furlough. On my way home my train stopped in Pittsburgh for an hour, and I stopped at the USO there. I was given a package made up by you. I am dropping this letter to thank you for this swell gift. It made a soldier very happy, because I had no money to buy anything, and was glad to get the candy and cigarettes. Keep up your good work, and thank you girls. Signed - Private A. S.\n\nThe girls of Troop #77 march in the 1942 Memorial Day Parade along Brookline Boulevard.\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\nHonoring Their Heroes\n\nJohn and Carol Ann Daum.\n\nDuring and after the war years, military-style oufits were a popular fashion in children's clothing. The entire country mobilized for the war effort. Defense Stamp drives and scrap collections made children feel as though they were doing their part to help, and a feeling of patriotism swelled among the nation's youth. Wearing a outfit fashioned to look like the men and women they looked up to was a natural expression of that pride.\n\nIn this photo from 1946, John Edward and Carol Ann Daum are shown wearing naval uniforms fashioned by their grandmother, Viola Jane Daum, from their father's old uniform. Albert Daum, a decorated veteran who was awarded the Purple Heart, served in the Navy SeaBees during the campaign in the South Pacific. The children wore their special outfits with pride in a classic example of Norman Rockwell's vision of Americana.\n\nJohn Daum went on to serve in the United States Navy as a submariner. This photo was contributed by Scott Price, son of Carol Ann Daum. Scott's grandfather, Harry R. Price, also served in the Navy SeaBees during World War II.\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\nShortages at Home\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette article published on December 30, 1945.\n\nRationing - Defense Drives - Service Stars\n\nRationing During World War II\n\nImmediately following America's entry into World War II, a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone and prevent inflation. Tires were the first item to be rationed, in January 1942, because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber.\n\nOn October 28, 1942, the government instituted a national speed limit of 35 mph. This was an effort to both lessen fuel consumption and increase safety. Most Americans were allotted a mere three gallons of gas per week and, due to rubber shortages, most vehicles were driving on old, worn tires.\n\nProperty and Supplies Director Harry Aufderheide and Police Sergeant Ernest Andrew\n\nare shown testing one of the new \"jack on wheels\" on August 26, 1943.\n\nThe problem with bad tires became such that creative measures had to be employed to deal with the frequency of flat tires and the ensuing traffic delays caused by stranded vehicles. It became a near necessity that these valuable tires be saved.\n\nFor instance, here in Pittsburgh, by 1943 an average of three vehicles a day were getting flat tires while driving through the Liberty Tunnels. In response, \"jacks-on-wheels\" were developed. A flat tire was lowered into a wheeled cradle and the car could be driven out of the tunnel without doing further damage to the tire.\n\nBy 1943, consumers needed government issued ration coupons to purchase typewriters, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, fuel oil, silk, nylon, coffee, stoves, shoes, meat, cheese, butter, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, and many other items. Some items, like new automobiles and appliances, were no longer in production as U.S. factories turned completely to wartime production. The rationing system did not apply to second-hand goods, like clothing and used cars.\n\nTo get a classification and a book of rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local rationing board. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and children. When purchasing gasoline, a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book and cash. Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to prevent hoarding.\n\nFamilies kept a close eye in their ration booklets as they could not be replaced. When in need of a new pair of shoes or a dress, parents would carefully collect the requisite number of red or blue tokens and then redeem them, along with cash, for the requested merchandise.\n\nHere in Brookline, families tightened their purse-strings and did their best to make do with less. The public transportation network became a prefered method of travel, and car-pooling became commonplace. Most homes grew Victory Gardens to help offset the shortage of foodstuffs. Parents learned how to mend worn clothing and repair broken appliances.\n\nOne thing that sticks out in most people's mind from the war years is a white vegetable substance, called Oleo Margarine, that became a common butter substitute. Many said that it did not taste like butter at all, and had the look and consistency of lard. In an effort to make the margarine look more palatable, there was a capsule of yellow dye inside each package. The capsule was broken and the dye kneaded into the oleo, making it look more like butter. The effort provided some relief, but most kids still considered it quite gross.\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\nWar Bonds and Defense Stamps\n\nAnother thing that was commonplace during the years 1942-1946 was War Bond Drives. In order to finance the war effort, the United States government sold savings bonds. Because of rationing, families often had more money than they could spend, so they saved it, mostly by investing in these government bonds.\n\nWar Bond rallies were held in most cities and communities, often featuring Hollywood film stars and war heroes to help draw the crowds needed to make the program a success. The bond buyer paid 75% of the face value of the bond, and received the full face value when redeemed after a set number of years.\n\nThese uniformed pledge girls took orders for War Bonds and Defense Stamps at a bond rally held in Brookline Memorial\n\nPark on July 20, 1942. Left to right are Florence Bergman, Dorothy Williams, Connie Adam and Martha Jane Tawney.\n\nThe rally was held by the Brookline Business Men's Association. This photo appeared in the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph.\n\nThere were seven major War Bond drives, including the Great Lakes War Bond Drive in 1945. Pittsburgh was one of the stops along the way for LST-512, a D-Day landing craft that toured the Great Lakes waterways. The vessel, loaded with war exhibits, was moored along the Monongahela Wharf on October 17, 1945.\n\nMay, 1942 - Defense stamp drive at Brookline School.\n\nScrap metal drives and the sale of Defense Stamps were another option for the government to raise capital with the help of the general public. Stamp drives were a great way to get the nation's school children involved in the homefront war effort. All public, private and parochial schools participated in the Defense Stamp drives. Locally, among Pittsburgh Public Schools, Brookline Elementary was the top seller of defense stamps in 1942.\n\nWhile the Little Kids spent their time selling defense stamps, collecting scrap metal, drawing patriotic posters in school and learning how to distinguish between American, German and Japanese fighter planes and bombers, the Bigger Kids joined the military and were sent overseas to fight the war.\n\nThe Stengel brothers, James Gillespie and other members of James Cowan's Boy Scout Troop collecting\n\nscrap goods and other items for the war effort along Norwich Avenue in 1945.\n\nPittsburgh Press newspaper carriers, also called Press Junior Merchants, also sold war stamps along their routes. The Pittsburgh Press highlighted a Brookline boy, Robert E. Templeton, son of Mr. and Mrs. R.J. Templeton, on January 28, 1944, as one of the leading carriers in the sale of war stamps.\n\nRobert E. Templeton\n\nTempleton, a student at West Liberty School, delivered along Lamarido Street, Fernhill Avenue and Pioneer Avenue. Up to that date, he had sold 38,965 War Stamps to subscribers along his route, fourth highest among all Press carriers.\n\nBesides being a newspaper carrier, Robert did odd jobs for neighbors and customers. With the money he earned, he bought War Stamps and clothing. At school, arithmetic was his favorite subject and he had ambitions of becoming an Aeronautical Engineer. As hobbies he built model airplanes and played the trumpet. Football was his favorite sport.\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\n<><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><> <><><><>\n\nService Banners and Stars\n\nAs the war raged, here in Brookline, as in all other Pittsburgh neighborhoods, blue service stars began to appear in many of the neighborhood windows. On a growing number of these red banners, gold stars replaced the blue. By 1945, it seemed as though there were one or more stars displayed on every home in the city.\n\nService flags hung from windows were a a proud symbol that one of more members of that household were actively serving in uniform during the war effort. These banners were adorned with a blue star for each member serving in a branch of the armed forces of the United States of America. A gold star represented a family member that had fallen in the line of duty.\n\nPTSD and The Military\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder is something that affects many of our veterans who have served in combat or other hostile environments.

The gun was produced between 1906 and 1919. Of the 960 guns ordered, only 209 were produced. Some of these saw action during the 1916 Mexican Border Campaign and in France during World War I.\n\nNot many of the guns have survived the test of time. Three of these are still on display here in Allegheny County. There are two standing in South Park at the intersection of Corrigan Drive and Brownsville Road. One other is on display in North Park.\n\nAn American 4.7 inch Gun M1906 was chosen to be the first cannon displayed at Brookline's Veteran's Memorial.\n\nThe two 4.7 inch M1906 guns on display in South Park at the corner of Corrigan Drive and Brownsville Road.\n\nAn American 4.7 inch Gun M1906 being fired in Texas during the 1916 Mexican Border Campaign.\n\nThe 155mm Schneider Howitzer\n\nThe Cannon on display at the Brookline Veteran's Memorial is officially known as a Canon de 155 C modele 1917 Schneider. The 155mm heavy field howitzers were made in France and used by the Allies in World War I. The weapons remained in the U.S. arsenal for many years as training guns. These howitzers also saw action in World War II, used by France, Finland, Poland, Germany, Italy, Spain and Yugoslavia.\n\nThe 155mm Schneider howitzer was one of the most common field guns used by the Americans in World War 1.\n\nLeft - An American battery equipped with 155mm Schneiders at Varennes in the Argonne, 1918;\n\nRight - Live fire training by the 4th Infantry Division at Camp Carson, 1943.\n\nLeft - 155mm Schneiders after WWI in 1919; Right - U.S. artillery training in 1940.\n\nThe Brookline Monument - The Cannon - 1982\n\nThe Brookline Monument - The Cannon - 2013\n\nThe Brookline Cannon stands silhouetted against a colorful sky in the Spring of 2013.\n\nDan McKeever - The Caretaker - April 2014\n\nOn April 27, 2014, new flags were installed at the Brookline Veteran's Park. The flags were hung by American Legion Post #540 members Joe Nellis and Dan McKeever, who for the past several years acts as volunteer caretaker of the memorial. McKeever, a U.S. Navy Vietnam Veteran, secured the POW/MIA flag, emblazened with the words \"Gone But Not Forgotten,\" solely with the profits from aluminum can recycling.\n\nJoe Nellis and Dan McKeever were instrumental in getting new flags for the Veteran's Memorial Park.\n\nBrookline has always been supportive of our proud veterans, who have served our country over the years with dedication and devotion. Our community also honors the memory of our young men who gave the ultimate sacrifice in times of war, and supports the ongoing efforts of veterans organizations to account for those soldiers who remain listed as Missing in Action.\n\nUnder A Fresh Coat Of Snow - January 2015\n\nBus Crashes Into Veteran's Memorial - July 2017\n\nOn July 8, 2017, the calm summer morning was interrupted with the sudden crash of an out-of-control Port Authority bus as it slammed into the Brookline Veteran's Memorial. The bus didn't just wreck into the memorial, it drove right through it, then went over the embankment and smashed into the wall and railing across the street on Chelton Avenue.\n\nThe bus had made its' usual left turn off of Queensboro Avenue and then lost control. It continued into a full U-turn, collided with two parked cars then barreled through the memorial, hitting the 100-year old Cannon and dragging it along until coming to a complete stop.\n\nBy the grace of God, no one was in the normally busy park at the time, and there were no serious injuries to report among the passengers on the bus. When the wild ride ended, it appeared that the bus actually faired worse than the vintage French-built howitzer, which sustained only minor damage.\n\nIt was a chaotic scene as the bus smashed through the small park and came to rest on Chelton Street.\n\nThe Cannon's tow hook and recoil brace got lodged in the bus' window frame and was pulled along.\n\nThe park fence and benches were mangled by the out-of-control vehicle as it smashed it's way through.\n\nMcGann and Chester were called to remove the cannon and bus and take them to a Port Authority repair facility.\n\nIn addition to the cannon, other damage in the park included a couple crushed benches and a fence which was mangled and torn from its' foundation. Once police and paramedics cleared the area and the chaos died down, a crew from McGann and Chester loaded the wounded cannon onto a flatbed and delivered it to the Port Authority garage, where repairs could be made.\n\nIt took a while to negotiate the bureaucratic red tape to determine how to proceed with the cannon repairs. Still the property of the Department of the Interior, special care had to be taken during its' restoration to meet their strict guidelines and procedures.\n\nBy October, the Port Authority had made good on it's promise to repair the iconic Brookline landmark, and on the fifth of that month, a PAT maintenance crew returned the cannon to the Veteran's Memorial and placed it back on it's concrete pad. The Pittsburgh Department of Public Works had already repaired the benches and fencing.\n\nTo the astonishment of Brookline residents, the cannon looked brand new. The restoration went much better than expected. Years of rust, weathering and neglect were repaired. New tires were installed and the howitzer was painted in traditional Army green. For all intents and purposes it looked brand new!\n\nIt is amazing how some things work out. For several years a coalition of concerned veterans and citizens had been trying to get the cannon restored. Their efforts were always thwarted by government red tape and other frustrations.\n\nIn the end, it took a near tragedy to provide the urgency and lifting of restrictions necessary to effect the proper repairs and ensure that this community landmark, first brought to Brookline in 1946, is now in a condition to last another 100 years.\n\nThe park looked a bit out-of-sorts for a couple months while repairs were being made.\n\nThe damaged Cannon at the Port Authority maintenance yard awaiting restoration.\n\nIn early October the restored cannon was ready to be returned to it's location in the park.\n\nAfter three months away from home, Brookline's cannon is back where it belongs, honoring our local veterans.\n\nBrookline's historic landmark French Model 1917 Schneider 155mm Howitzer hasn't looked this good in years.\n\nDecorated For The Holiday Season - December 2017"
