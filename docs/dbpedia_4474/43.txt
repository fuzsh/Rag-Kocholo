LOCATION: The Washington Avenue / Memorial Park Super Neighborhood is bounded on the east by the western part of downtown Houston, on the south by Buffalo Bayou, on the West by IH-610, and on the north by Hempstead Road, MKT train tracks, White Oak Bayou, and IH-10.

COMMUNITY DESCRIPTON AND HISTORY: Memorial Park, and the Camp Logan and Crestwood neighborhoods, are at the western edge of the super neighborhood, and were home to a World War I training camp for US Army soldiers. Today, Memorial Park is a 1500-acre urban park that also contains the Houston Arboretum and Nature Center. The park is also home to many recreational amenities, such as a 3-mile long jogging trail, picnic areas, tennis courts, a swimming pool, and soccer, softball, and baseball fields.

At the eastern edge of the super neighborhood are the Old Sixth Ward and First Ward neighborhoods. These are historic neighborhoods created late in the 19th century, and were the first designated by the City of Houston as a Protected Historic District. Many of the commercial and industrial sites created in the 20th century, are giving way to a vibrant art district today.

SN22 is also home to two historic cemeteries. Olivewood Cemetery ws founded in 1875, and is the first to serve the African-American community in Houston. Glenwoood Cemetery was founded in 1871, and is the resting place for many notable Texans, including the last president of the Republic of Texas.

There are more than 10 neighborhoods in SN22, founded early in the 20th century as working-class neighborhoods. Today, they are one of the most rapidly changing areas in Houston, and home to many upscale single and multi-family residental properties.
