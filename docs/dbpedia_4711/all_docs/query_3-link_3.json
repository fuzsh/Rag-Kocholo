        "text": "What does Pizza 73 Franchise do?\n\nPizza 73 is a fast-spreading pizza restaurant franchise based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, featuring a menu of delectable pizzas a cut above, but for wallet-friendly prices. Pizza 73 offers a broad menu of more than 20 different pizza toppings, three types of crusts and three kinds of sauces, plus wings, chicken bites, wedgies, salads and other sides. Even with the fast growth of the Pizza 73 brand, the company’s motto remains: “Better Meal. Better deal.” Pizza 73 also prides itself on its cutting-edge delivery technology, assuring a fast, hot, delectable meal every time out.\n\nPizza 73 Franchise History / Relevant Facts\n\nPizza 73 first opened its doors in 1985 and grew quickly right out of the gate, opening 17 new stores in its first two years of franchising, and growing to more than 70 Pizza 73 locations today, all across Western Canada. Pizza 73 corporate headquarters are located on the 17th floor of Canadian Western Bank Place in Edmonton.\n\nHow Much Does a Pizza 73 Franchise Cost?\n\n****Pizza 73 employs a different approach to franchising. While most companies charge a royalty payment as a percentage of sales, Pizza 73 does not charge a royalty fee at all. Rather, the parent company shares profits equally, so that the company and its franchisees grow together, or take losses together. If a franchisee doesn’t make a profit, Pizza 73 corporation doesn’t charge a percentage fee."
