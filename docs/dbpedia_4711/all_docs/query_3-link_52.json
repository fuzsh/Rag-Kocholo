        "text": "Vegan pizza: It’s arguably the best culinary creation on the planet. And it’s getting even better, since PETA has worked with businesses to expand their meat- and dairy-free options. We’re thrilled that many chains now offer vegan cheeses, animal-free meats, and scrumptious veggies, making it easy for compassionate customers to find fresh, tasty pizza.\n\nSatisfying our pizza cravings should never mean supporting the cruel meat and dairy industries, which exploit thinking, feeling individuals.

By simply choosing nondairy cheese and other vegan toppings, we can make a huge difference for cows, pigs, chickens, and all other animals.\n\nPapa Murphy’s\n\nKnown for its Take ’N’ Bake pizzas, Papa Murphy’s offers vegan cheese from Violife as an option on all its pies.
