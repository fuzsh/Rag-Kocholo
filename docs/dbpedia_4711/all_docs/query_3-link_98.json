And now for My Top 5 BEST and WORST Episodes. As you all know, they are based solely on the episode’s qualities themselves and not all major wins/losses will be factored into the lists.\n\nMy Top 5 BEST Episodes\n\n#5: Oct. 24\n\nIn spite of a rough R2 and a throwaway guess in R4 by eventual winners Elizabeth & Sharon, we had a couple PRs and a $10K MW win by said team I just mentioned. In the BR, I was relieved when said team called the I’s, and that was what they needed to solve the names of two Chinese cities for the first $50K payoff of the season! Well done.\n\n#4: Dec. 13\n\nWe had a bad first half and were nothing above the minimum assuming the first two Toss-Ups were solved, but Jeremie turned things around w/ a great EXPRESS run and solved the next two puzzles for a MAINGAME SWEEP! He then picked a perfect combo in the BR to complete the TOTAL CLEAN SWEEP since Melanie from Mar. 12, 2015! Nicely done!\n\n#3: November 20\n\nThis was an awesome start to the first America’s Game episodes of the season. Bridget got off to a fast start winning over $13K cash & spree after the first three puzzles, but Steve really poured it on by solving all of the next puzzles in the maingame, and he put the game out of reach by solving R4 for a whopping $21,250 thanks to selecting four T’s on $5K! Plus, there was no BANKRUPT trash in the game! In the BR, I had the puzzle w/ RSTLNE and I was relieved he chose the P and three A’s. Picking that vowel lead him to solving BEAUTY PAGEANT for the Mercedes-Benz GLA and becoming the temporary S35 leader w/ over $92K cash & prizes! A thrilling show from start to finish.\n\n#2: March 8\n\nI was absolutely impressed w/ Shonda’s performance. She really put the game away after solving the first three rounds and won nearly $49K cash & trips. In the BR, she showed us that you take some time in picking your letters (the F was logical since she thought the first word could be FAST), and her $45K win was the cherry on top and she wound up becoming the new S35 leader until…\n\n#1: MARCH 21!!!\n\nR2 may have been rough, but we had perfect rounds in R1 and R3, and our big winners, the Mandells, picked some good consonants including the H courtesy of their WC (it was impossible to pick a vowel for additional help since the E’s were the only vowels up there) and they became the first and only $100K winners of the season! Now that is big time redemption and we definitely needed this since we had no grand prize wins in all of 2017.\n\nAnd now, prepare for the ugly.\n\nMy Top 5 WORST Episodes\n\n#5: April 4\n\nThis midweek episode of College Week Spring Break was an absolute flunk-fest. All of the first three rounds were riddled with penalties and it didn’t help that Keely was playing too conservative after her opponents each got a Toss-Up in the beginning. With nobody breaking five figures after the first three rounds, I was afraid we were gonna have a four-figure win and ultimately, Keely somehow managed to hang on and win w/ just a pitiful $9,900 cash & trip. Her WIPEOUT in the BR for not reading enough superheroes really sealed this episode’s fate.\n\n#4: February 22\n\nBoy, I was lucky to not have covered this episode while I taped my episode on that day. After the PR in R1, things really started falling apart. Late in the Mystery Round after Christina’s successful MW gamble, she kept on going and flushed away $15,050 to BANKRUPT. Was that even necessary, girl? I don’t think so. Three more BANKRUPTS were incurred in the next round, including two by said female. With none of the scores breaking five figures, this episode was headed for disaster. In the end, the Jim back then rallied and beat PP winner Monique w/ a final score of $9,550 to her $9,187. The total BANKRUPT trash? A whopping $20,550. And Jim’s large BR loss of $45K just made things worse. Not an episode worth watching.\n\n#3: March 12\n\nThis extra episodes on the set of Disney Sea & Shore was far from magical. All of the first three rounds had so many blunders especially R2. I was wondering if any of those teams have even seen the movie “Footloose”. With nobody reaching five figures after R3, this episode was headed for disaster. In the end, the Bryants eked out a win by just $290 over the Gutowskys w/ a total of just $11,750. And with no win to boost the Bryants’ total, this taping day as unfortunately a TOTAL WASHOUT. Another episode not worth watching.\n\n#2: November 10\n\nNot a very thankful episode to end our salute to veterans. We had a CRITICAL DUD late in R1 by Yvonne to squander $8,950. Midway through the next round, both Catherine & Bill BANKRUPTed on either side of the MDW, costing said woman $750 and a $7,400 New England trip courtesy of American Cruise Lines she picked up on her first turn. And later, Yvonne took an unnecessary spin w/ only the G’s remaining in the crossword puzzle to flush away $13,450 including the $10K MW — that was totally unnecessary, lady. -___- With only $100 above the minimum after the first half, I didn’t feel confident where this episode was headed. Bill improved nicely in the next round and got the last Toss-Up to win the game w/ over $18K cash & Hawaii, but the total BANKRUPT trash was too much at $24,550. And after only getting little help in the bottom word of his OCCUPATION puzzle in the BR, he ULTIMATELY BECAME THE THIRD $100K LOSER THAT SEASON, and this week back then marked the second time that in 2017 we had two $100K losses in a week (the previous was that WHEEL Around the World week from the previous season).\n\n#1: MARCH 6\n\nYou’re about to find out why I ultimately decided this episode would take the crown for WORST EPISODE OF THE CORAL SEASON. It all started when we had a CRITICAL DUD of C by Ricardo to leave $4,950 sitting there. In the Crossword Round, Margaret didn’t even notice the blank following FLOWER on the bottom across word, and Mary would make an unnecessary SPINGLE like in the last round. As a result, we were nothing above the minimum after the first round. And Ricardo would make a big fail late in the last round by purchasing the sole dud vowel of O to throw away $5,050. I need to give this guy a grammar lesson: the two letter word used to indicate the noun being mentioned is an article. In fact, when the second word starts with a vowel, the first word had to be AN. Why he thought the O would go there is beyond me. Ultimately, Margaret solved for just the PP and went on to become the first contestant in history to win the game w/ just an expensive PP prize. Unbelievable. And not surprisingly, she lost her BR.\n\nAs for my vote on Wildest Episode of S35…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…May 8. Amber committed a CRITICAL DUD late in R1 saying N was the last remaining letter in R A _ T instead of H to throw away $6,650. But in the next round, she took a big risk on the MW w/ the South Africa and $500 on the line, and it paid off! She would hold on to win the game w/ nearly $22K cash & South Africa.\n\nNow for the notes of this season aside from the season changes…\n\nThe Nissan Versa was pretty much the 1/2 CAR for a majority of this season except weeks where they had a Ford Fiesta on offer.\n\nOn the premiere (Sept. 11). Pat accidentally looks at the yellow arrow instead of the red arrow during the Final Spin, but is quickly corrected by the staff.\n\nLaura from the September 12 was the first contestant ever to win a trip to Cuba in the PP.\n\nOn Sept. 13, The 80’s marked the first appearance of a “decade” category since S32.\n\nOn Sept. 15, RSTLNE was very generous and Bill was only the seventh contestant to have ever called a Z.\n\nOn Sept. 21, the 80’s SONG LYRICS puzzle “NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN” went viral due to it being lyrics from Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up”, the song associated with the Internet meme of rickrolling. The new category of WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? was selected for the very first time.\n\nOn Sept. 28, Mike solved the bonus puzzle PIZZA PARLOR on the buzzer. Although the win music played and the answer was revealed, they had to check the tape and be sure that he said it in time. And the hosts declared that he was a winner. As a result, Pat announced the amount he won instead of Jim.\n\nOctober 2: the show was pre-empted in several markets due to expanded coverage of the Las Vegas shooting. It would be rebroadcast during Saturday reruns for the next season.\n\nEvery episode during the week of October 9 opened with a pre-recorded clip in which Pat and Vanna stated that the episodes were taped prior to Hurricane Harvey, followed by a flashback clip from a previous Texas road show.\n\nOct. 18: the Round 2 puzzle “MY HEART GOING BOOM BOOM BOOM” uses a hanging indent, so that the last three words were aligned directly underneath each other.\n\nFollowing the $1M loss on Nov. 15, Pat and Vanna did the closing chat with Brandon Peters, the 2017-18 Walt Disney World Resort ambassador.\n\nOn November 16, Ellen DiGovanni, who designed gingerbread houses for Walt Disney World Resort, prepared a gingerbread house for Pat and Vanna during the closing chat.\n\nOn Jan. 8, the original $1K Toss-was is thrown out due to an incorrect answer being accepted. According to a Facebook post, this was not discovered until after the team who gave the wrong answer was interviewed, resulting in the entire show being reshot to that point and the replacement puzzle NAVIGATION SYSTEM not being themed.\n\nFeb. 6: nine of the puzzles until the $3K Toss-Up had a T in them.\n\nOn Feb. 15, the Round 3 puzzle MY BIGGEST BRIGHTEST SMILE is the only WAYW? puzzle to date that is not an article of clothing or accessory.\n\nIn the closing segment on March 26, Pat and Vanna honored the 45th anniversary of “The Young and the Restless”, with Christian LeBlanc, Tracey Bregman, Bryton James, and Camryn Grimes present onstage.\n\nOn March 28, contestant Aggie’s last name and hometown were never mentioned.\n\nJennifer from the April 18 was wheelchair bound, and so husband Shawn spun for her.\n\nApr. 30: All the contestants playing in the final week from Walt Disney World that night were left-handed.\n\nMay 16: The Crossword Round was the only one this season to use three words.\n\nMay 31: Dennise solved the bonus puzzle MOVING BOXES on the buzzer, and so they checked the tape for only the second time that season, and she was ruled a winner.\n\nThat’s all I have for now. If anyone has any more notes about this season, please feel free to let me know in the comments.\n\nPortions of the materials used in this segment are trademarks and/or copyrighted works of the Wheel of Fortune History Wiki.

This whole season to me was basically a carbon copy of S28 due to tying the big number of grand prize losses at 11. The 2017 part was below average for the most part due to the two $1M losses and three $100K losses we unfortunately got, and it got more worse w/ that long losing streak from the get-go in January plus other bad stuff in 2018. That being said, I’m afraid I have to give this whole season a below average grade at BAD.\n\nSEASONAL RATING: 4\n\nCLOSING REMARKS\n\nThat does it for this unpleasant S35. I’m sure you all enjoyed my appearance for Apr. 11. I got @jpgenius to help me out more and March 21 was the first appearance we heard from former admin @SkippsLargo. He joined us in the admin business and did his first recap late in the season during finale week. Too bad it didn’t start out right.\n\nNext up on my project list, S36…"
