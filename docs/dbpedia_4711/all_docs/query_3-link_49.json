While every Big Red alum may have the Collegetown of their East Hill years emblazoned in their memory, the student-driven enclave is forever evolving—from decade to decade and even year to year.\n\n“Each generation of students and alumni has its own view of what the ‘timeless’ icons are—and in many cases, they’re pretty narrowly focused,” says Mark Anbinder ’89, a second-generation alum who has been covering the Ithaca food scene for decades for 14850 Magazine and 14850.com and via a regular weekly segment on WVBR.\n\nIndeed, while some legendary establishments—like Johnny’s Big Red Grill, the Royal Palm Tavern, the Nines, Aladdin’s, Rulloff’s, and the Chapter House—existed for decades, countless others have come and gone: changing names, locations, or cuisines or closing altogether, with new ventures popping up to take their place.\n\nFor example, as Anbinder notes, when Student Agencies (the building’s owner) announced plans to demolish the Chacona Block—prompting CTB’s move—many who objected were unaware of the venerable bagel shop’s history: it has been operating in Collegetown since 1976, originally residing in a different storefront in the same building.\n\n“They had no idea that CTB’s familiar corner spot wasn’t its first home,” Anbinder says, “or that Oliver’s [deli] was the corner icon there for a while.”\n\nAs major construction continues to change the face of Collegetown, Cornellians asked alumni to share their memories of the neighborhood’s restaurants and watering holes.\n\nAs recent grad Reed Rosenberg ’20 observes: “I think the appeal of Collegetown, upon reflection, is that it encapsulates what most people are nostalgic about when they think about their college years: it’s a close-knit, walkable community where you can see your friends easily and frequently.”\n\nThe following is a not-at-all-comprehensive (and in no particular order) smorgasbord of establishments that offered nourishment, libations, and entertainment to alums from the mid-20th century onward. While alums weighed in on nearly two dozen favorites, others—such as Café Decadence, the Connection, Dino’s, and Johnny O’s—didn’t get detailed shout-outs. But please feel free to add your memories to the comments below!\n\nRoyal Palm Tavern\n\nFor Lucrezia Herman ’76, one of its salient features was the stickiness of its tables: “I once made the mistake of putting a paperback on a table there, leaning my elbow on it for an hour or so and then tearing part of the back cover off when I tried to pick it up!”\n\nThe building that housed the Palms is no more; it was one of several properties razed in 2017 to make way for Cornell’s Breazzano Family Center for Business Education.\n\nJim’s Place / The Chapter House\n\n“I still have my own personal beer mug from Jim’s in my den at home,” recalls Bill Waters ’54. That Stewart Avenue watering hole had opened in the late 1920s; it segued into the Chapter House in the 1960s—weathering a 1980s stint as an ice cream parlor before reemerging as a popular hangout that eventually offered 49 beers on tap as well as house-made sodas, games, live music, and popcorn.\n\n“Mostly, the clientele consumed upstate Pilsner by the pitcher,” recalls Jason Gettinger ’64. “Did it serve food? Who noticed? Oh yes, burgers and fries in a basket lined with a red-and-white checked napkin.” Ron Bulmer ’67, who worked as a bouncer when the establishment was briefly known as “Jim’s Chapter House,” sums up his takeaway: “I learned to hate pizza—messy to wear.”\n\nMany recall 25-cent drafts, frat and sorority composites on the walls, and singing along with the jukebox. “Every time I hear Bobby Darin’s ‘Mack the Knife’ or Robert Palmer’s ‘Sneakin’ Sally Through the Alley,’ I’m immediately transported back to the Chapter House,” says Sharon Palatnik Simoncini ’78.\n\nDestroyed in a 2015 fire—after which, memorably, a crop of corn sprouted up in the vacant lot, seeded by the cache of popcorn kernels—the building was rebuilt a few years later in a style similar to the original. But the Chapter House has not been revived, and the space remains vacant.\n\nJohnny’s Big Red Grill\n\nRuthy’s Place\n\nIn business briefly in the early 1970s, the restaurant (also known as Ruthy’s Flamboyan Restaurant) was located across from Chef Italia on College Ave. “Aside from great lasagna and her signature cranberry chicken, Ruthy was best known for her hot, fresh-from-the-fat donuts, available a few evenings each week,” Rick Curreri ’73 reminisces. “If you were lucky, she’d give you the donut holes for free.”\n\nRulloff’s\n\nKnown for its lunchtime burgers and weekend brunches, Rulloff’s was a Collegetown staple from 1977 until its demise in 2020. (It had been previously scheduled to close to make way for demolition of the Chacona Block that summer, but shut down earlier that spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.)\n\n“Rulloff’s was my date restaurant,” notes Matt Van Ryn ’82. “They had delicious quiche and French onion soup.”\n\nThe establishment was named for notorious local murderer Edward Rulloff, who, in 1871, became the last man executed in New York State by public hanging. Rulloff’s cerebral organ is one of the most notable occupants of the University’s Wilder Brain Collection.\n\nUniversity Delicatessen\n\nNicknamed Uni Deli, the sandwich shop at the corner of College and Dryden was a mainstay of the 1970s. While some alums note its corned beef, pastrami, and slices of cheesecake priced at 10 cents per ounce, Beth Anderson ’80 calls it “the place to go for coffee, a sandwich, ice cream, or any type of comfort food.”\n\nThe Nines\n\nThe beloved pizza joint took its name from its building—the original, early 1900s home of Ithaca’s Fire Station No. 9. A new station was built next door in the 1960s, and the Nines opened in the early 1970s as a bar, restaurant, and music venue (first called “Old No. 9”). Its outdoor patio was one of Collegetown’s largest.\n\n“Who didn't love the Nines?” says Peter Brav ’77. “Reasonable prices, many varieties of beer, burgers, those buckets of steamers, and great atmosphere with friends, especially after hockey games at Lynah Rink.”\n\nThere was much lamenting when the Nines closed in 2018, with hordes of alumni and locals clamoring for a final taste of its deep-dish pizza—and a glimpse of what Tom Helf ’83 praises as the “very cool” dumbwaiter that transported food down from the second-floor kitchen.\n\nCosmopolitan Restaurant\n\nKnown as Cosmo’s, the establishment “was everyone’s intro to Greek food,” says Curreri. “Demos, the ever-friendly owner-chef, would send out moussaka, pastitsio, avgolemono, and other Greek specialties (along with a great Spanish empanada) for under two bucks. The most expensive dish was a great boneless strip steak and fries, both covered with a Greek lemon sauce, for $2.22.”\n\nStories You May Like\n\nChef Italia\n\nThe Ithaca franchise of this Rochester-based chain helped popularize spiedies in Ithaca in the 1970s. “Where else could you get a burger (or spiedie), fries, and a mug of draft beer for all of 99 cents?” Curreri says of this College Avenue eatery, which briefly became the Italian restaurant the Vineyard before closing in 1980. “And the meager price didn’t prevent us from sending the burger back if wasn’t properly cooked to order.”\n\nCabbagetown Café\n\nThe legendary spot on Eddy Street was a vegetarian mecca with a national reputation, mostly due to its chef-turned-owner, Julie Jordan ’71, who authored the landmark cookbook Wings of Life, as well as the Cabbagetown Café Cookbook, which featured dozens of the eatery's recipes.\n\n“I went regularly for lunch with friends and co-workers,” says Herman, adding that she still uses one of Jordan’s cookbooks. “I bought a replacement copy when I left Ithaca in the late ’80s, as my housemates had used/abused it heavily as well!”\n\nThe Chariot\n\nLocated one flight below street level, this Eddy Street pizzeria was a favorite for many years before closing in 2005. “The sandwiches at the Chariot were gi-normous!” says Van Ryn. “There used to be a B. Kliban cartoon, ‘Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head.’ Those were the sandwiches at the Chariot.”\n\nNicole Neroulias Gupte ’01 remembers the “legendary” corn nuggets. “The Daily Sun used to go there after electing the next slate of editors,” she says, “and they comforted me greatly when I lost an election junior year.”\n\nDunbar’s\n\nIn business for 36 years until its closure in 2015, Dunbar’s—with its accumulated graffiti, framed jerseys, and the famous Lynah Rink cowbell—was a formative and memorable spot for many. Laura Tocco Mariani ’99 recalls meeting her now-husband, Matt Mariani ’97, there. “Matt offered to buy me a beverage and the rest is history,” she says, adding that they named their border collie after the bar.\n\nDunbar’s was also a favorite for Michelle Giuffrida Cannon ’90, who reminisces that “Wednesday night was Group Therapy—$6 for a pitcher of beer and some kamikaze shots.” And as Meg Feury Ragland ’94 recalls, “Back in our undergrad days, Pete Shephard ’94 and I used to meet for beers at Dunbar’s on St. Patrick’s Day, along with probably a few hundred of you.”\n\nThe Souvlaki House\n\nH. Fisk Johnson ’79, MEng ’80, MS ’82, MBA ’84, PhD ’86, remembers this family-style Greek and Italian stalwart so fondly that he gave the eatery—and its now-retired owner, Peter Papachryssanthou—a shout-out during the 2017 celebration of the gift that created the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business.\n\n“I think I ate 14 or 15 meals a week at Pete’s restaurant, the Souvlaki House,” Johnson said, then led the audience in a round of applause for Papachryssanthou (who was in attendance) and added: “I highly recommend the large Greek salad with extra feta.”\n\nI highly recommend the large Greek salad with extra feta.\n\nH. Fisk Johnson ’79, MEng ’80, MS ’82, MBA ’84, PhD ’86\n\nMany other alums share happy memories of the Souvlaki House—still in business on Eddy Street after more than half a century.\n\nNotable for its fold-up booth seats and wall art showcasing both soccer jerseys and images from classical history, it has long been a go-to place for hockey fans’ pre-game dinners, featuring not only the eponymous meat dish and huge Greek salads but pizza, Italian entrees, and garlic bread.\n\nOliver’s\n\nBefore Collegetown Bagels took the iconic corner spot at College and Oak avenues, Oliver’s deli resided there from 1980–94.\n\nCelia Shafer Feiler ’95, DVM ’99, remembers Oliver’s for having “the best matzo ball soup! Homemade chicken soup and one giant matzo ball that filled the container. My boyfriend then (and now husband) would pick up an order whenever I was sick.”\n\nCollegetown Bagels\n\nThe iconic bagel shop first opened in the Chacona Block in 1976, in the storefront that would later house Bear Necessities. It moved to its familiar corner spot in 1994, operating there for a quarter century before moving to its current home in 2020.\n\nJanelle Teng ’11 calls CTB “the classic, the stalwart. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a late-night snack. The most coveted seat in Collegetown as soon as the temperatures rose in the spring was on the CTB patio.”\n\nThe Collegetown CTB has since spawned four related outposts (some operating under the name Ithaca Bakery)—at the foot of East State Street in downtown Ithaca, in East Hill Plaza, on Route 13, and in the Triphammer Mall in Lansing.\n\nGreen Café\n\nThe “short-lived, but legendary” eatery—as described by Teng—was located in a large space on the southwest corner of Dryden Road and College Avenue that remains vacant today. “It was an NYC-style Korean deli that served everything from mashed potatoes to sushi to beer towers, open 24 hours a day,” she says. “They closed within a year, during which they were a go-to spot for many students.”\n\nAladdin’s Natural Eatery\n\n“It was made with apples, grapes, kiwi, melon, berries, and maybe some other fruit, topped with plain yogurt, drizzled in honey, and sprinkled with walnuts,\" Rubinstein recalls. \"So simple.”\n\nMama Teresa’s\n\nA staple on Dryden Road for 15 years before moving to Ithaca’s West End in 2012, Mama Teresa’s was (infamously) ranked by Playboy in 1999 as a top spot for diners to enjoy while in a state of—shall we say—inebriation.\n\n“There are not many things certain in this life, but getting a slice during prelims or a night out to get your greasy fix at Mama T’s was certain,” says Lorraine Medeiros ’01. “Nothing made a night more complete than a slice and a soda with friends.”\n\nStella’s\n\nA somewhat more upscale establishment amid more casual options, Stella’s opened in the early ’90s—amid a resurgence of cocktail culture—and offered a menu with local and organic options and a diverse list of libations. In its adjacent, dark-paneled café, coffee drinks and pastries were plentiful.\n\nChristen Aragoni ’02 has fond memories of her favorite Stella’s beverage, an alcoholic concoction of hot coffee, chocolate, and mint called a Troop Leader—“perfect after freezing at the hockey game.”\n\nPixel Lounge\n\nAnbinder notes that even though Pixel was only in business for a decade (2005–15), it “garnered just as much attachment for students as did Dunbar’s, which lasted 36 years.” Located in an alley off Dryden Road, it was named one of the best clubs in Ithaca by the Daily Sun. Local and NYC-based graffiti artists were commissioned to decorate the exterior walls; inside, it offered an arcade of old-school games like Ms. Pac-Man, an ongoing stream of projected movies, and a variety of DJs offering hip-hop and electronica mixes to an eager crowd.\n\nTop: Video by Cornell University.\n\nPublished March 29, 2022\n\nDo you have your own Collegetown eatery memory to share?"
