        "text": "Been eating here for years and nary an issue. When choosing toppings for your personalized pizza, items are clearly marked. You can also order their 3 gf pizzas if you don’t want to choose toppings yourself. Their pizza crust is 7/10 for a gf. It’s less flat and blah then papa George’s or TJ’s Pizza but not as fluffy as pizza huts new gf crust. I always order mine well done otherwise any leftovers are soggy by the next day. Also they sell gf breaded boneless wings that are quite good for what they are. I love ordering their creamy dill dip for wings and pizza. Takeout or delivery only, no dine. Their regular wings are amazing for non gf eaters!\n\nI have ordered here once before a cheese gluten free pizza and was totally fine. I order a few nights ago and ordered a gluten free pepperoni pizza, sad to say I was sick with in a hour. I think maybe pepperoni did it since it was a new one I tried or CC???"
