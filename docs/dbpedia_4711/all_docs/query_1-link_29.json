Each delivering on our promise to serve up a “Better meal. Better deal.” every time.\n\nOur menu has grown too. When we started out, we offered a limited number of pizzas. Now we cook up 25 varieties of specialty pizzas, offer over 20 different toppings, five styles of crust (Traditional Pan, Super Pan, Thin Crust, Sesame Seed and Gluten Free), and seven types of sauce (Traditional, BBQ, Donair, Sriracha Honey Garlic, Pesto, Buffalo and Creamy Garlic) for you to create your own pizza, and prepare eight flavours of wings. We even whip up an assortment of fresh side dishes such as boneless wings, wedgies, dipping sauces and salads daily."
