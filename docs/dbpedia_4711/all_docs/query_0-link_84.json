        "text": "TORONTO, February27, 2017 – Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 continue to raise dough through its Slices for Smiles Foundation, announcing that the companies raised a record $500,000 in 2016. The half million mark is the most funds raised to date by the sister chains in the foundation’s 10-year history.\n\nThe money will be donated to Children’s Miracle Network and its member children’s hospitals across Canada. All funds will stay within the communities they were raised to benefit the children’s hospital for that region to help provide critical treatment, equipment and overall care, and funds research, new equipment purchases and social programs for kids.\n\n“Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 have been putting smiles on children’s faces for decades, so supporting children’s hospitals and improving the well-being of children across Canada is important to us,” said Pat Finelli, Chief Marketing Officer, Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73. “We’re thankful for the support of our franchisees, partners, team members and, most importantly, the generous support of our customers who continually help us to exceed targets, year after year.”\n\nFunds were raised through the sale of smile pizzas, events and donations.\n\n“Pizza Pizza and Pizza 73 are great supporters of children’s hospitals and the work they do,” said Adam Starkman, Chief Development Officer at Children’s Miracle Network. “Fundraising programs, like Slices for Smiles, raise funds that help ensure that our member hospitals are able to provide the best possible care to children in their communities.
