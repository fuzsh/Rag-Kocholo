        "text": "Pizza Express is to close 73 of its UK restaurants with the potential loss of 1,100 jobs.\n\nThe chain, which at the moment has 454 UK outlets, said it had cut a deal to reduce rent costs.\n\nIt said although most of its restaurants have been profitable over the past three years, earnings had been declining.\n\nPizza Express also confirmed it had hired advisers from Lazard to lead a sale process for the business.\n\nIt is currently majority owned by Chinese firm Hony Capital.\n\nZoe Bowley, Pizza Express's managing director for the UK and Ireland, said: \"Unfortunately, the impact of the global pandemic has meant that we have had to make some incredibly tough decisions to safeguard Pizza Express for the long term.\"\n\nMs Bowley said that in most cases, the stores selected for closure are near to another Pizza Express that has already reopened or will be reopening soon.\n\nShe added that the process \"will protect the jobs of over 9,000 of our colleagues\".\n\nThe outlets to close are:\n\nAberdeen, Belmont St\n\nAylesbury\n\nBarnstaple, Three Tuns\n\nBiggleswade\n\nBillericay\n\nBirmingham, Corporation St\n\nBirmingham, Mailbox\n\nBournemouth, Post Office Road\n\nBramhall\n\nBristol, Berkeley Square\n\nBristol, Regent Street\n\nBromsgrove\n\nBruton Place, London\n\nCharlotte Street, London\n\nChippenham\n\nDalton Park\n\nDarlington\n\nDudley, Merry Hill\n\nEarls Court, Earls Court Road, London\n\nEdinburgh, Holyrood\n\nFormby\n\nFulham Palace Road, London\n\nGlasgow, Princes Square\n\nGlossop\n\nGosforth\n\nGrantham\n\nHalifax\n\nHampstead, London\n\nHatch End\n\nHereford\n\nHeswall\n\nIpswich, Lloyds Avenue\n\nLeeds, Crown Street\n\nLeeds, Horsforth\n\nLudlow\n\nLymington\n\nMelton Mowbray\n\nMidhurst\n\nMilton Keynes, Hub\n\nMoseley\n\nNew Brighton\n\nNewcastle\n\nNewport, Isle of Wight\n\nNewport, South Wales\n\nNorthallerton\n\nNottingham, Goosegate\n\nO2 Finchley, London\n\nOrpington\n\nOxford, Oxford Castle\n\nPoole\n\nPort Solent\n\nRamsgate\n\nReading, St Mary's Butts\n\nScarborough\n\nSheffield, Devonshire Street\n\nSheffield, The Moor\n\nShirley\n\nSouthport, Old Bank\n\nStafford\n\nStaines\n\nStoke\n\nStourbridge\n\nSudbury\n\nTorquay\n\nUxbridge\n\nWakefield\n\nWalsall\n\nWapping\n\nWardour Street, London\n\nWeston-super-Mare\n\nWhiteley Village\n\nWhitstable\n\nWrexham\n\n1965: Pizza Express founder, the late Peter Boizot, brought a pizza oven from Napoli and a chef from Sicily to open his first restaurant in London's Soho.\n\n1992: Mr Boizot grew his empire over the following almost-three decades before selling it for Â£15m to Hugh Osmond and Luke Johnson, the man who was - until recently - chairman of Patisserie Valerie. They floated it on the stock market the next year and ultimately sold out in 1997 when it was worth Â£150m.\n\n2003: It was taken private again in a Â£278m deal by two private equity firms who then floated it two years later - although it lasted less than a year on the public markets before it was returned to private equity hands.\n\n2014: It changed hands again, this time to be acquired for Â£900m by its current owner, Chinese private equity house Hony Capital.\n\n2020: It has more than 600 restaurants globally: 454 in the UK, including five franchises; 19 in Ireland; 24 in Hong Kong; 6 in Singapore; 14 in UAE; 60 in China; and 49 other international sites operated by franchisees."
