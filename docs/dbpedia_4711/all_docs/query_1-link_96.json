        "text": "\"My two friends come here regularly but I've never been. They were stoked to introduce me to this neighborhood gem. Our server, Travis, was an absolute delight. Super friendly, helpful, and great service all around. The portions were quite generous and the garlic bread that our entrees came with was obviously an added bonus. I got the half size salad in an attempt to put some produce into my body and it was still a huge helping. The pastas were all creamy, rich, and absolutely indulgent. I loved the CBD beverage options as I'm currently dry. I hope I get to come back here next time I'm in town!\"\n\n—Tigger H.\n\n\"The drinks are great and they pour heavy. Food is solid and plentiful. Every member of the staff is awesome. The regulars this place draws are good folks no matter what day you show up.\n\nWe've brought people here from out of town. Every time they visit they want to go to Harry's.\"\n\n— Jamie\n\n\"Harry's bar is easily my favorite place to eat PIZZA in the city. Sometimes my partner and I will eat here twice a week.\n\nTravis is one of the greatest bartenders of all time and Harry is always a gracious server, the owner, can you imagine! What a great spot. Get the dinner greek salad, and a mini or small pizza if you want to be happy.\n\nUpdating my review because Google prompted me too and I am a child of the search engine. This is the best bar and restaurant in the city, come here for pizza, order takeout, live your best life.\"\n\n— Betha\n\n\"This place was great. The bartender was very nice and made us delicious cocktails. We got the Pisco sour, el diablo and another drink as well. They were each wonderful. We spent more than we wanted to but we were very satisfied. :) I believe the bartenders name was Alex so I want to give her a special shout out. The drinks she mixed up were amazing.\"\n\n— Rose"
