Join us this week from the couch, as we bring you our first take out wing review!\n\nThe Stats.\n\nWing Night!\n\nNone. Maybe you should give us a break, Pizza 73.\n\nFlavours (8 for $7.99 | 20 for $15.99 | 40 for $29.99 | 80 for $49.99)\n\nGOLDEN CRISPY | SCREAMIN’ HOT | BBQ | LEMON PEPPER | HONEY GARLIC | TERIYAKI | CHIPOTLE (breaded/not breaded) | BUFFALO (breaded/not breaded)\n\nWe tried Golden Crispy, Screamin’ Hot, Lemon Pepper, Teriyaki, Chipotle (Breaded), Buffalo (Breaded)\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\n7.333333333333333333/10\n\nOur Verdict.\n\nPizza 73 will always hold a special place in our hearts, and the atmosphere was obviously tops at Maverick’s. The waitresses were damn fine and the beers flowed generously. Our delivery guy was right on time for the beginning of the Connor McDavid era.\n\nI don’t understand why anyone would order anything but the golden crispies. Next time we will just do 80 of those – Maverick.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5\n\nSize Factor: 8\n\nCrisp Factor: 6\n\nJuicy Factor: 7\n\nFlavour Factor: 8.5\n\nSauce/Seasoning Factor: 8\n\nValue Factor: 5\n\nNot much bang for the buck here but a convenient option. Depth of flavours could use some work. – Goose.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.5\n\nSize Factor: 8.5\n\nCrisp Factor: 6\n\nJuicy Factor: 8\n\nFlavour Factor: 8\n\nSauce/Seasoning Factor: 7\n\nValue Factor: 4\n\nPricy… but hey, you barely have to get off the couch! – Iceman.\n\nOverall Rating: 7\n\nSize Factor: 8.5\n\nCrisp Factor: 6\n\nJuicy Factor: 7.5\n\nFlavour Factor: 7.5\n\nSauce/Seasoning Factor: 6\n\nValue Factor: 4\n\nIceman’s Ranch Quotient: 3"
