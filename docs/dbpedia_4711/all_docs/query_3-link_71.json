        "text": "The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) received a record 943,928 trademark registration applications in 2021, and the number of applications has increased 70% in just five years. Even celebrities such as Hailey Bieber struggle with finding the right brand name, as understood from a recent Trademark Infringement lawsuit for her skincare line, Rhode. Unfortunately, this naming dilemma extends to the blogosphere: While there’s always ample room for new niche content, with over 600 million blogs on the web, naming your blog can be one of the most challenging steps of starting a business and making a website. A good blog name is one of the most inexpensive ways to grab attention in a crowded marketplace amongst these types of websites, but bloggers and creators need creativity and innovation to stand out.\n\nIn this article, we’ll help you create a blog that holds a name with maximum originality, both with brainstorming strategies from professional creatives and tools like Wix’s blog title generator.\n\nHave a blog name ready to go? Get started on your blog with Wix today.\n\nQuestions to ask yourself before coming up with blog names\n\nWhen you start a blog, you should first decide what it will be about and which goals you wish to achieve by blogging. Begin by asking yourself the following questions, after which you will be best equipped to come up with and sort through all your blog name ideas:\n\nWhat type of blog will you create?\n\nWho is your target market?\n\nWhich writing style and tone of voice will you use?\n\nWho are your competitors and how are they going about their blogging strategy?\n\nAdditionally, you should think about the motivation behind your blog. Do you want to make money, educate or simply inspire? Your name should tell your blog’s purpose or niche.\n\nRead Also: Best blogging tools\n\nAsk yourself these additional questions to identify the intention behind your blog name:\n\nWhat do you want readers to feel after they read your blog’s name?\n\nWhat message do you want your blog’s look and feel to communicate?\n\nWhat will you use your blog for most?\n\nTo further help define your blogging style and message, take a peek at our blog templates for inspiration. Knowing where you’re headed can better help you come up with blog name ideas.\n\nHow to come up with a blog name\n\nBefore we jump into our 17 blog naming methods, remember that like choosing a name for a person, pet, business or domain, you want to select a blog name that can grow and evolve with you.\n\nWith this in mind, make sure the name you come up with is original and not too specific so that you can expand in your niche. This allows you to scale your readership and expand your opportunities to make money blogging.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll also want to make sure your blog name examples and ideas are catchy, short and sweet (not more than three words). You should be easy to find and effortless to remember.\n\nAccording to Josh Brentan, a content creator and brand shaper who has named multiple Wix products and features, don’t stop at the first good idea you have. It’s essential to iterate, he says, because the more names you generate, the more open your mind is to inspiration, and the more paths you can explore.\n\n“Once you’ve got a long list, only then should you start to narrow it down,” Brentan says. “Do multiple rounds if you need to.” Brentan also recommends using a naming brief.\n\nLet’s take a look at the most effective ways to come up with blog name ideas:\n\nGather related keywords\n\nPlug your keywords into Wix’s blog name generator\n\nMake it a brand\n\nExperiment with blog naming formulas\n\nInvent a portmanteau\n\nUse a thesaurus and special dictionaries\n\nAdapt a popular saying\n\nIncorporate another language\n\nTry an alliteration\n\nUse your own name or nickname\n\nSimplify with abbreviations\n\nCombine unrelated words\n\nCome up with puns\n\nInclude the name of a city, country or region\n\nMake up words\n\nKeep it easy to spell and pronounce\n\nBe purely descriptive (and remember the rule of three)\n\n01. Gather related keywords\n\nAs you do your research, you'll start noticing repeating words that are often used in your blogging category, whether it's food, fashion or travel. In this very first step, you should jot down as many of the words that come to mind that relate to your niche. In later steps, we can incorporate these phrases into our blog naming strategies and blog name generator.\n\nTo help you gather words, read articles, blog posts and books about your topic and write them down. The greater the list of words, the more blog name ideas we can come up with.\n\nGive yourself room to expand within a niche or industry. For instance, let’s say you’re a personal finance guru and choose to name your blog with the keyword “Crypto.” A name like this may be limiting if you ever want to discuss different investment forms or even change your niche entirely. Personal blog name ideas should have an authentic, genuine feel.\n\n02. Plug your keywords into Wix’s blog name generator\n\nDo you have a word in mind that you want to include in your blog name? Whether you have a starting direction or are at ground zero, you can find great blog name ideas with a blog name generator.\n\nThis online tool suggests names by combining the text you enter with industry trends to come up with relevant ideas that can inspire you, or ready-made names you can use.\n\nThis platform automatically shows you the domain availability for each idea, so you can go ahead and easily secure your domain name before someone else takes it.\n\nBefore you do so, make sure the name is also still available on social media, as you'll want to promote your blog on other channels.\n\n03. Make it a brand\n\nConsider which blog names translate well to branding when coming up with ideas. Eventually, you might choose to sell digital marketing assets, eBooks or possibly launch a product line related to your niche.\n\nConsider how the name will read on social media, as a professional email address, and even as a logo. For inspiration, check out these blog logos built around a memorable brand strategy. Use Wix’s free logo maker tool to create your own custom blog logo.\n\n04. Experiment with blog naming formulas\n\nLuckily, much simpler than calculus, these formulas make solving the blog name equation fun and easy. You can use the keywords you've already come up with that are related to your industry and make them sound catchy once they've been placed in the right order.\n\nTry one of these five techniques to get the best blog names:\n\nBlog name = [modifier] + [noun]\n\nExamples:\n\nParenting blog: Happy Mama\n\nCooking blog: The Experimental Chef\n\nTravel blog: The Lonely Traveler\n\nBaking blog: The Healthy Baker\n\nArts and crafts blog: The Colorful Canvas\n\nBlog name = [audience or topic] + [end goal or transformation]\n\nExamples:\n\nFinance blog: Millennial Investors\n\nPhotography blog: The Photo Wiz\n\nHealth and fitness blog: Yoga for Inner Peace\n\nBlog name = [noun] + [noun]\n\nExamples:\n\nWriting blog: Pen and Paper\n\nBaking blog: Pink Cupcakes\n\nFitness blog: King of the Gym\n\nBlog name = [adjective] + [first name]\n\nExamples:\n\nThrifty Taylor\n\nFlexible Alex\n\nModest Meg\n\nAdventurous Alex\n\nBlog name = Simply + [word]\n\nExamples:\n\nFood and diet blog: Simply Paleo\n\nFitness blog: Simply Cardio\n\nInterior design blog: Simply Design\n\nBe inspired: Fashion blog names, Lifestyle blog name ideas, Travel blog name ideas, Food blog names\n\n05. Invent a portmanteau\n\nPortmanteau is the process of combining two different words to create an entirely new one. You can form many blog name ideas when joining two familiar words into one.\n\nThe benefit of portmanteau blog names is that they can clearly describe your blog niche and are original since you create a unique combination. You also don’t have to worry about blog domain names being taken when you make it up yourself. To help you develop effective keyword combinations, you can use a generator tool such as the Port Manteaux Word Maker.\n\nExamples include:\n\nTravel blog: Footrip = foot + trip\n\nFood blog: Appetizertime = appetizers + time\n\nMusic blog: Discritic = disc + critic\n\nTravel blog: Flightescapes = flight + escapes\n\nPhotography blog: Shutterclick = shutter + click\n\nBlogger Joe Massaro gave his music blog a portmanteau-based name that would look great on any band tee: Paperface Zine.\n\n06. Use a thesaurus and special dictionaries\n\nDust off your thesaurus, or should we more accurately say bookmark a new tab, because this method can help you find just the right blog names you're searching for. How will it help you? A thesaurus lists words in groups of synonyms and finds related concepts that can spark a lot of new name ideas.\n\nFor example, if you've noticed a certain word such as travel is too often used, a thesaurus will suggest words like voyage, wanderlust and globe-trotting instead. More types of dictionaries can help you find the right blog name.\n\nHere are some options to explore:\n\nThesaurus - Synonyms and related words.\n\nRhymeZone - Rhymes, descriptive words, similar sounding words and homophones.\n\nOneLook - Describe a concept and get back a list of words and phrases related to that concept. Tap into special abilities such as choosing the number of letters and the letter the word should start with.\n\nOneLook Dictionary Search - Gives you words that often appear near your word.\n\nReverse Dictionary - Search for words by their definition.\n\nWord Hippo - Find words ending with a specific word.\n\n07. Adapt a popular saying\n\nSometimes familiar phrases just sound right to the ear. You can use this to your advantage by modifying a saying you’ve heard before and tweaking it to fit your blog name. Not only will coming up with a blog name be easier since you have a starting point, but it will also be memorable since it relates to a known phrase.\n\nTo help you think of common sayings, turn to Pinterest for quotes or even articles such as this one that list the most common English proverbs. Let’s show you what we’ve come up with:\n\nFood blog: Bake the Cake and Eat It Too\n\nBook blog: Been There, Read That\n\nFashion blog: [Insert name] Wears Prada\n\nFinance blog: More Money, Less Problems\n\nHome decor blog: Honey, I’m Home\n\n08. Incorporate another language\n\nWant to instantly sound more international and interesting? Consider including a foreign language in your blog name. Don’t worry, there is no need to sign up for a language course. A simple Google Translate search can help you find a blog name you agree with.\n\nTry to choose a language that relates to your niche. For example, if you're starting a cooking blog, use a language from a country where your cuisine originates. If pizza and pasta are your specialties, using an Italian phrase in your food blog name is a no-brainer.\n\nWe've taken some general industry words and translated them into another language, so you can see the magical effect they can have. Take any of these words and plug them into your own blog name.\n\nFashion blog: À la Mode = The Fashion in French\n\nExample: À la Mode by [your name here]\n\nFood blog: Cucina = Kitchen in Italian\n\nExample: Welcome to My Cucina\n\nTravel blog: Adiós = Goodbye in Spanish\n\nExample: Adiós I’m on the Next Flight\n\nThis food blog website template goes by the name Amuse Bouche, which is a French term that literally translates to \"mouth amuser.\"\n\n09. Try an alliteration\n\nAlliteration is when the same letter or sound appears at the beginning of an adjacent or closely connected word. These word pairings tend to roll smoothly off the tongue and help with our memory, as they can be quite catchy. This can be useful for users when they want to look you up again later.\n\nTo come up with an alliteration, make a list of as many words as possible that also start with the same letter of the word you’re set on using. Remember, you can go back to strategy number 5 and get the help of one of the special dictionaries.\n\nHere are some alliterations to get you started:\n\nLifestyle blog: My Luscious Lifestyle\n\nMusic blog: Music Minute\n\nFitness blog: The Weightlifting Writer\n\nArts and crafts blog: Crafting Creatively\n\nFinance blog: Frugal Finance\n\nParenting blogger Shelby came up with a blog name that is both representative of her content as well as catchy enough to be memorable: My Modern Motherhood.\n\n10. Use your own name or nickname\n\nWhat better way to claim something yours than putting your name on it? Using your name or nickname allows people to immediately know the person behind the blog. This is very common in personal blogs. There are two main ways to include your name in your blog: using your full name or combining it with other keywords.\n\nUsing your full name will allow you to have a straightforward domain name that continuously reminds readers who you are. For example:\n\nDianaWilliams.com\n\nTonyJackson.com\n\nAmandaSmith.com\n\nThe other popular way is to use your name and incorporate adjectives, nouns, or blogging niche keywords before or after your name or nickname:\n\nMovie blog: Katy’s Movie Addiction\n\nArt and design blog: Ella the Painter\n\nPoetry blog: Poetry by Andrew\n\nFitness blog:CrossFit With Chris\n\nFor a personal touch, Wix user Anika Pannu hand-lettered her self-titled blog’s logo.\n\n11. Simplify with abbreviations\n\n\"Less is more\" can easily explain why people use abbreviations to come up with a blog name. A shortened form of a sentence or phrase can still allow you to have a longer message behind your name, but makes it short and straightforward to write and remember. This strategy is especially useful if your domain is already taken or if you’ve checked how much your domain costs and it’s too expensive.\n\nSee our examples:\n\nBeauty blog: MBH = Make-up and Beauty Hacks\n\nFashion blog: DOI = Daily Outfit Inspo\n\nParenting blog: MPD = My Pregnant Diary\n\nLove and relationship blog: LRA = Love and Relationship Advice\n\nFitness blog: WWM = Workout With Me\n\n12. Combine unrelated words\n\nWe are not entirely out of our minds by suggesting you use random, unrelated words together. People use this method to come up with a blog name because it often results in some of the most memorable names.\n\nYou should have at least one word related to your blog’s function, but the others can be a color, an adjective or a noun. Let's take a look:\n\nInterior design blog: The Dancing Furniture\n\nPhotography blog: The Laughing Camera\n\nTravel blog: The Lazy Suitcase\n\nFood blog: The Green Kitchen\n\n13. Come up with puns\n\nTime to get punny. To help explain, a pun exploits the different possible meanings of a word or combines words that sound alike but have different meanings. Consider adding a pun to your blog name to help you show your quirky and creative side. After all, people want to read a blog authored by someone with personality and using a pun can show this side of you off the bat.\n\nIf you can't think of a pun, try to use slang or humor in your blog name to achieve the same effect.\n\nPhotography blog: Oh Snap!\n\nBook and writing blog: Never Wrong, Always Write\n\nTravel blog: Love at First Flight\n\nBaking blog: Baking the World a Better Place\n\nLifestyle blog: Extra Fries and Exercise\n\nLife of Pai is a punny play on the title of the popular movie, Life of Pi, suggesting an adventurous and thought-provoking exploration of topics, akin to the movie's rich narrative and themes.\n\n14. Include the name of a city, country or region\n\nWhen blogging in a competitive industry, it can be good to differentiate yourself by becoming a regional expert in your topic. To help highlight your geographic presence, you can include a city or country name in your blog name.\n\nUsing a region in your blog name is also good because it can help your blog SEO. Suppose people are searching for travel bloggers that are experts in a specific destination they are planning to visit, that's when your blog can show up.\n\nExamples:\n\nLifestyle blog: Alice in Paris\n\nTravel blog: Adventures in the Middle East\n\nPersonal blog: Katarina From Korea\n\nLifestyle blog: A Vegan in Portland\n\nFashion blog: Tel Aviv Fashionista\n\nFood blog: Taste buds of Tokyo\n\n15. Make up words\n\nLet's begin by saying that we've followed our own advice when inventing the word Wix as our company name. Need more proof that random words can make a breakthrough? Ikea, Häagen-Dazs and Sony all don't mean anything but with great products, good marketing and branding, we all know who they are and what they offer.\n\nTry to come up with some random words and ask your friends and family which sound like the best fit for a blog name.\n\nWhen making up new words, do a quick check to see if they have any meanings in other languages.\n\n16. Keep it easy to spell and pronounce\n\nThe easier to pronounce, the easier it will be for your audience to remember your domain name. For this reason, avoid using hyphens, dashes, and numbers. Also, stay away from homophones, or words pronounced the same but spelled like “board” and “bored\" or “by” and “bye.”\n\nYou can test with your friends and family to see how easy your name is to pronounce it is to pronounce or spell.\n\nLife As We Explore's blog name is simple and to the point. Readers understand that the blog will function as a travelogue.\n\nSubscribe to the Wix blog for a weekly dose of fresh web design tips and trends.\n\n17. Be purely descriptive (and remember the rule of three)\n\nDescribing the content of your blog in the name might seem obvious. However, it helps your readers instantly understand what you're all about. Being straightforward and to the point in a blog name is often appreciated by people who quickly need to find a specific type of blog.\n\nExamples:\n\nPet blog: All About Cats\n\nBlogging blog: Blogging For Beginners\n\nReligion blog: Daily Prayers and Passages\n\nMusic blog: Nashville Country Music Lovers\n\nHaven Book Reviews aptly describes what readers can expect from their blog: To find a safe place in books. (This happens to be their tagline, as well.)\n\nTo simplify things further, you can list three words that describe what you’ll write about on your blog. A great example of this technique can be found in the book title Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert. Let’s apply this rule of three to some blog name ideas:\n\nExamples:\n\nHealth and wellness blog: Yoga, Meditation and Mindfulness\n\nFitness blog: Gym, Sleep, Repeat\n\nDIY craft blog: Sewing, Knitting and Other Crafts\n\nWriting blog: Short Stories, Poems and Creative Writing\n\nNews blog: News, Gossip and Pop Culture\n\nLifestyle blog: Coffee, Clothes and My Camera\n\nWhat makes a good blog name?\n\nWhen you are coming up with a blog name, you’ll want to make sure that it’s memorable. One of the best ways to do that is to keep it short so that it’s easy to remember and type, even if someone only sees it once. With about 4.4 million new blog posts published every day across all platforms, it can be tough to stand out from the competition and make a name for yourself. Choose a blog name that is different from others in your niche so that people can easily identify you and come back.\n\nYou should also choose a blog name that reflects what you are blogging about. If you're blogging about personal finance, you won’t want to choose a name that relates the wrong message or has nothing to do with that. Choosing words that have to do with money or budgeting is the best way to communicate what your blog is about quickly.\n\nGood blog names should also be brandable. If you have the perfect name but it’s already taken on social media, that might pose a problem for you later on down the line. Find a name that is easy to use as a domain name and social media handle so that people can find your blog. Remember that your blog name is your brand - it's what people will remember you by, so it's important to choose a name that you like and that represents your blog's content and personality.\n\nAnother potential factor to consider when choosing a blog name is that it helps if it’s search engine friendly. Try including relevant keywords that people are likely to search for if possible.\n\nRelevance: Your blog name should be relevant to the topic of your blog. This will help potential readers understand what your blog is about and whether it is something they are interested in.\n\nMemorable: Good blog names need to be memorable so that people will be more likely to find your blog again if they enjoy your content.\n\nUnique: Your blog name should be unique and stand out from other blogs in your niche. This will help you to build a strong brand for your blog.\n\nEasy to pronounce and spell: Make sure your blog name is easy to pronounce and spell. This will make it easier for people to share your blog name with others.\n\nAvailable as a domain name: The blog name you choose needs to be available as a domain name. This will ensure that you can create a website for your blog using that name.\n\n80 Creative blog name ideas\n\nLet’s get less theoretical and more practical by looking at blog name examples we’ve come up with. Below, you can explore 80 blog name ideas by blog niche to spark your creativity. If you see one you like, go get ownership of the domain, choose the best blog template for your site and begin writing your first blog post.\n\nFood blog name ideas\n\nTravel blogs\n\nHealth and fitness blogs\n\nLifestyle blogs\n\nFashion blog name ideas\n\nBeauty blogs name ideas\n\nPhotography blogs\n\nPersonal blogs\n\nDIY craft blogs\n\nParenting and mom blog name ideas\n\nMovie blogs\n\nBook blogs\n\nPersonal finance blogs name ideas\n\nSports blogs\n\nNews blogs name ideas\n\nFood blog name ideas\n\n2.

You need to finalize your blog name so you can launch your blog.\n\nHowever, there are a few final questions to ask yourself before making it official:\n\nIs your blog name short and memorable?\n\nPeople should be able to remember and spell your blog name easily, even if they only see it once. Keeping it simple and making sure people are able to tell what your blog is about just by hearing the name can help them remember it.\n\nIs the domain name and social media handle available?\n\nYou can check the availability of a domain name by using a domain name checker. Imagine your blog name written with a .com (or the relevant extension) after it to make sure it looks and feels right to you.\n\nAs for social media, simply search for it on all available social media platforms to make sure your name isn’t taken.\n\nIs the name search engine friendly?\n\nIf you want people to find your blog through search engines, make sure your name includes relevant keywords.\n\nIs the name trademarked?\n\nYou can check if a name is trademarked by searching for it on the United States Patent and Trademark Office website.\n\nDo I like the name?\n\nThis is probably the most important question of all. Do you like the way the name sounds? Does it represent your blog's content and personality? If you don't like the name, you're not going to be happy with it in the long run.\n\nBlog name ideas FAQ"
