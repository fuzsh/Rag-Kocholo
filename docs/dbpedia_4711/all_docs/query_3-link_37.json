        "text": "In the first half of 2024, metro Phoenix said goodbye to several longtime restaurants and bars, including a well-established Italian favorite, an ice cream shop that's been part of metro Phoenix for 73 years, a family-owned Mexican restaurant that stayed in business for 44 years, the OG of cocktail bars, family-owned bakeries, bars and pubs.\n\nSome closed so owners could retire and spend time with their families, while others are teasing the possibility of reopening in new locations. A neighborhood bar closed to make room for the next generation of owners.\n\nHere are the 20 most surprising metro Phoenix restaurant and bar closings of 2024, so far.\n\nBarrio Cafe\n\nMay 31 marked the end of an era for Phoenix when chef Silvana Salcido Esparza closed the doors to Barrio Cafe, the restaurant she opened over 20 years ago to bring a taste of regional Mexican culture to the Valley. She not only found great success and a cult following at her restaurant, but she also opened the door for many other aspiring young chefs. When patrons learned of her restaurant's closing, they flocked in droves, waiting up to two hours to taste her food one last time.\n\nBS West\n\nBS West, one of the oldest gay bars in Scottsdale, announced its plan to close after 35 years in a Facebook post on Jan. 2.\n\n\"As we approach the end of an era, we wish to extend our deepest appreciation and best wishes to those who made our journey meaningful,\" read the post. \"Thank you to the family of staff, show casts, partners and loyal patrons who helped us create a safe space and loving atmosphere over the years.\"\n\nThe bar's last day was Jan. 7.\n\nCarly's Bistro\n\nThis Roosevelt Row staple closed on May 3 after 20 years. A post on Carly's Instagram account announced the news: \"It is with tremendous love and gratitude for our community and incredible staff we are announcing that Carly’s will be closing permanently May 3rd after nearly 20 years in business on our beloved corner of Roosevelt and 2nd Streets.\" The owners Carla and John Logan told The Republic that they felt it was the right time to close and move on to their next project.\n\nIn its place, Michael Bodow, Michael Cheathem and Jordan Hudgens plan to open Industry Standard, a cocktail bar and restaurant.\n\nCenter Stage Bar\n\nThe bar at Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa at Gainey Ranch closed on April 6 after 18 years. The hotel said goodbye to Center Stage Bar with one last party with food, drinks and live music.\n\nThe bar's closure is part of a $110 million renovation of the resort as it transforms into a Grand Hyatt property. Celebrity Chef Richard Blais will bring six new dining concepts as part of the renovation, with the H2Oasis pool bar already open.\n\nDragon Wok\n\nThis restaurant was forced to close after 19 years when a vehicle crashed into the then-empty Gilbert Chinese restaurant on May 14. The driver was found dead in his car after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Michael Szeto, the owner's son, has set up a GoFundMe account to raise $35,000 for the employees. The reopening date remains uncertain.\n\nThe Farmhouse\n\nThis mother-and-daughter-owned breakfast and lunch spot in Gilbert closed at the end of June after 35 years. Over the years, the restaurant has served generations, from their original customers to those customers' kids and grandkids. Pamela Hillisgardt, Milli's sister and the current owner, told Gilbert Sun News that some people ate two of their meals every day at the restaurant.\n\nGarden Bar PHX\n\nThis award-winning bar went on sale in May. On July 9, the owner posted a farewell on Instagram titled \"Last call at Garden Bar.\" The post informed the fans that the property had a buyer and invited them to stop in one last time. According to the post, Garden Bar might do pop-ups in the future.\n\nGeisha A Go Go\n\nGeisha A Go Go restaurant at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Scottsdale Road in Old Town Scottsdale is closing after 17 years. The sushi restaurant was a popular after-work destination for happy hour and karaoke.

SnapBack Pizzeria replaced the restaurant. He then opened a second location in Glendale in March 2023.\n\nIn the post, Wheeler asked for support in his \"newest endeavor:\" Fatherhood.\n\n\"I’ll be turning off the ovens, untying my flour-dusted apron, and using my rubber-soled non-slip kitchen shoes to walk into this next chapter in life with a full heart, determined to give this new adventure the attention it deserves and the work-life balance necessary to be present and enjoy every moment.\"\n\nHalf Moon Windy City Sports Grill\n\nHalf Moon Windy City Sports Grill in Phoenix closed on Feb. 12 after 18 years.

Since opening, the shop changed hands and locations a few times.

The economy, the market place, lifestyles, and our own personal health bring change to us all. These things, and with the encouragement of family and crew (almost family), I've decided it's time to close P.Croissant and retire. It's been a pleasure to serve you and your families these many years (in some cases four generations!). Thank you for your support, and best wishes to all of you.\"\n\nSakana Sushi and Grill\n\nThis Japanese restaurant closed its Ahwatukee location after 19 years at the end of June.

Our Chandler location is the only one we own outright,\" the post read. \"With the influx of new restaurants downtown, we’ve seen a decline in business over the past few years, and with more than 13,000 square feet, it’s also our most expensive restaurant to operate.\" According to the post, the Chandler employees \"will be offered employment\" at the locations that remain open.\n\nSecond Story Liquor Bar\n\nSecond Story Liquor Bar in Scottsdale closed after 10 years on May 4.
