        "text": "EDMONTON, ALBERTA--(Marketwired - June 8, 2016) - Pizza 73, Western Canada's leading pizza chain, has launched three new Sriracha-infused menu items that will awaken taste buds. Customers can enjoy three new items: Sriracha Chicken Pizza, Sriracha Chicken Wings, and Sriracha Creamy Garlic Dipping Sauce.\n\nThe perfect combination of spicy and sweet, the Sriracha Chicken Pizza uses Pizza 73's new Sriracha Honey Garlic Sauce as the base and is topped with pineapple, chicken and fresh green peppers. Customers looking for a side with the same intense flavour can enjoy the pizza chain's signature chicken wings tossed in the new sauce. For added kick, both can be enjoyed by dipping into the Sriracha Creamy Garlic Dipping Sauce.\n\n\"Our new Sriracha options definitely have bite,\" said Pat Finelli, Chief Marketing Officer for Pizza 73. \"This new recipe is perfect for spice enthusiasts who like a sweet-and-spicy balanced flavour.\"\n\nGreek Salad and Gluten-Free Boneless Wings also added to the menu line up\n\nPizza 73's new Greek Salad and Gluten Free Boneless Wings are a healthy addition to the company's growing menu of side items.\n\n\"Being able to offer gluten-free options is important to us,\" continued Finelli. \"We understand the growing concern with gluten allergies, and want to ensure that Pizza 73 is able to cater to everyone's needs.\"\n\nPizza 73 ensures that when making gluten-free boneless wings, or any of the gluten-free menu items, procedures and controls are implemented to guarantee food safety and avoid cross-contamination.\n\nFor more information on new menu items or special deals and promotions, visit www.Pizza73.com.\n\nAbout Pizza 73"
