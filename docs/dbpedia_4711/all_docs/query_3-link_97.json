        "text": "What are the most hated words in the theme park industry? I suspect that they are “back to school.”\n\nThe start of the school year means the end of summer vacation and with that the end of the high season for most theme and amusement parks. The Halloween season provides an extra financial boost for many parks, but scream season does not start bringing in the big crowds until next month. That leaves August as a time to wind down and say goodbye to many summer friends at most theme park across the country.\n\nBut not at Universal. This year, Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Orlando are hosting the first theme park events I can remember that celebrate the back to school season. Why would Universal do that? Well, celebrating a return to school becomes a bit easier when your parks’ biggest icons represent what might be the world’s most famous school — the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\n\nIt’s “Back to Hogwarts” season at Universal this month. As August was the month in the Harry Potter books and films when students filled magical shops to stock up on school supplies, Universal’s back-to-school event is staying on theme by focusing on merchandise. The resorts are selling “Back to Hogwarts”-themed merchandise bundles, including robes, backpacks and writing journals themed to fans’ selected Hogwarts house. Need a wand or a plush owl to complete your set-up? Universal, as always, will be happy to hook you up for the right price.\n\nUniversal also will be rolling out special bakery treats, as well, such as an iced biscuit that will be available at the Honeydukes sweet shop later this month. But for the most part, it’s an excuse for fans of all ages to cosplay as Hogwarts students, or alumni, and pose for photos throughout Universal’s The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.\n\nThat Wizarding World is growing, too. Universal just announced plans for its next installation of a Harry Potter-themed land, this time at the upcoming Universal Epic Universe theme park in Orlando, which opens next year. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter — Ministry of Magic will be Universal’s first Potter-themed land set outside the United Kingdom.\n\nThis land — Universal’s third Harry Potter land in Orlando — will be set in magical Paris as depicted in the “Fantastic Beasts” film series. That gives Universal Creative’s designers a welcomed excuse to craft a new look for this land, one employing a lot of Paris’ Haussmannian architecture.\n\nBut for the land’s big ride, guests will travel via “Métro-Floo” back to the U.K. and the familiar environs of the British Ministry of Magic to try to capture baddie Dolores Umbridge for her trial on Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry, a motion-base dark ride that recreates omnidirectional Ministry lifts from the Harry Potter films.\n\nPotter fans might start by heading off to Hogwarts, but Universal is working to ensure that those fans can continue a lifelong Wizarding World story long after their school days are done."
