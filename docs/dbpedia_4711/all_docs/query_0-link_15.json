        "text": "Making the decision to open your own business is likely driven by two objectives: personal fulfillment and profit. As your “Partner in Profit”, Pizza 73 will work closely with you to help achieve these goals.\n\nFranchise companies normally levy a 4% to 7% royalty based on sales. Even if a franchisee is not profitable he or she is still obligated to pay this fee. At Pizza 73, we recognize the inequity of this situation and therefore do not charge a royalty fee.\n\nAs “Partners in Profit” we are vitally concerned that each store is financially viable. Rather than levy a royalty fee we share profits equally. At Pizza 73, we recognize our objective is to maximize profits through cooperation and commitment. We only succeed together. If our partner doesn’t make money, Pizza 73 doesn’t make money – it’s that simple!"
