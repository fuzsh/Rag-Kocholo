        "text": "TORONTO, Feb. 12, 2018 /CNW/ - On any given day, love and pizza go together like cheese and pepperoni. This Valentine's Day, Pizza Pizza lavishes Canadians with a package that includes the company's renowned pizza shaped like a heart, complimentary heart-shaped chocolates, personalized labels and the chance to win a two-carat diamond ring*.\n\nThrough the new personalized labels, customers can send a Valentine's Day pizza to that special someone in their life with the message \"You've got a pizza my heart\" and a \"To\" and \"From\" area for their names. The personal touch is offered to the customer at the time of ordering through www.pizzapizza.ca, by phone or in-store.\n\n\"Surprising a loved one with a gift delivered to their home or work on Valentine's Day is a heart-warming tradition,\" says Paul Goddard, CEO at Pizza Pizza. \"Our newest feature allows Canadians to choose to send our Valentine Delight Pizza as a personalized gift for someone special. At Pizza Pizza, we encourage celebrating happy occasions and sharing the moment with one another. Sending a pizza in the shape of a heart, personalized for the recipient, is a fun and unique way to show your love or appreciation for a family member, friend or that special someone in your life.\"\n\nAvailable for $11.99, the Valentine Delight Pizza is equivalent to a medium, 12-inch pizza and comes with a choice of any two toppings (including dairy-free cheeze).\n\n\"We launched the personalization feature in time for Valentine's Day, but it will continue to be available beyond February 14th so customers can share the moment on birthdays, anniversaries and other special celebrations,\" said Goddard.\n\nIn 2015, pizza was named the most widely Instagrammed food in the world. Canadians love pizza so much that the country has two official celebrations for the typically cheesy culinary creation – National Pizza Day on February 9th and National Pizza Month in October.\n\nThe Valentine Delight Pizza is available at all traditional Pizza Pizza locations. For more information on Pizza Pizza's menu items, visit www.pizzapizza.ca.\n\n* Diamond ring contest not available in Quebec.\n\nAbout Pizza Pizza Limited\n\nWith more than 750 locations across Canada, Pizza Pizza Limited is Canada´s pizza pioneer and a quick-service restaurant leader.
