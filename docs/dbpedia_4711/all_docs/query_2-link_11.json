In connection with the transaction, the Fund has acquired the trade-marks and other intellectual property associated with Pizza 73 restaurant operations. The acquisition of Pizza 73, a leading quick-service restaurant pizza retailer based in Edmonton, allows Pizza Pizza to expand into Western Canada.

In addition, Michael Overs, indirectly, and the Pizza 73 vendors acquired an aggregate of 766,392 units on a private placement basis, for total proceeds to the Fund of approximately $7 million.\n\nTorys LLP represented Pizza Pizza Royalty Income Fund and Pizza Pizza Limited in the acquisition, private placement and offering, working with Dan Vukovich, general counsel, Pizza Pizza Limited.
