        "text": "Mahlia Lone tries out Ava Salon & SPAâ€™s Turkish style Hammam rituals\n\nThere are many day spas in Lahore and more than enough salons, but there is only one Turkish style hammam for women. Recently, Ava Turkish Spa opened its doors for business and I was agog with curiosity to try out the treatments on offer.Â I went in for the traditional hammam experience. AvaÂ Â day spa is centrally located in Mini Market and easy to find. The minute I entered the aromatic fragrance and soothing music lulled my spirit made uneasy by the cityâ€™s insane traffic. A cup of flavourful Turkish tea further soothed my ruffled senses.\n\nAfter undressing and putting on a wrap, I was led to a steam room big enough for two. Since the hammam is a communal experience in Turkey, here itâ€™s been made for two women to ideally share. I would recommend you go with another woman you are close enough to strip in front of and who you are comfortable enough to chat or remain silent with as the mood pleases you. Also, I recommend taking your own bikini as though a washed one is handed to you, the more fastidious ones, like me, would prefer to clothe your modesty in your own undergarments.\n\nAn attendant waiting patiently outside the steam room handed me a glass of water to cool me down with a drink and led me to the piece de resistance, the hammam itself.Â Itâ€™s a large immaculately clean room entirely covered with pristine white marble under a blue dome. Massive white marble lotus shaped basins with wall mounted silver taps lined the sides. The white marble glowing under blue light made it appear otherworldly. I lay down on one of the two massive marble slabs and my two masseuses, Merhma and Zeenat, expertly went to work on me. First, they sloughed off the dead cells with exfoliating mits, then used charcoal soap to wash me and finally a pillow cover filled with air to rub sudsy bubble bath all over my body, a divine, indescribable feeling. I felt like I was being kissed by angels.\n\nMy hair was gently shampooed also. Impressed with the quality of service, I asked my two attendants how long their training had lasted for. Three months, they replied, while carefully helping me up from the by now slippery marble slab.\n\nBy now, I was so squeaky clean. Next came the step to massage my skin with aromatherapy oil. I was kneaded and massaged till there was not a knot left in my muscles and my skin glowed silky with the oil.\n\nLast came the Jacuzzi, big enough for two, filled with rose petals and a rich bubble bath to wash away the excess oil. This room too was lit dimly with candles to optimize relaxation. Aaah, bliss!\n\nI highly recommend all women to make the hammam a part of their busy lives. Itâ€™s especially recommended to get ready for an anniversary, for brides the day before their wedding, or even as a monthly ritual. The whole process takes closer to two hours. If, during Ramzan, you donâ€™t want to sweat in the steam, I suggest trying one of their body wraps. The Cleopatra wrap sounds particularly enticing. More on that another day.\n\nâ€œAyesha and I took a trip to Turkey and Greece last September. When we were in Istanbul we visited a hammam there. After our services we both were talking about how there are so many spas in Lahore but none offer the hammam. Thatâ€™s when we decided to tap this market gap and open one in Lahore.â€ â€”Ana Ali\n\nOnce upon a time, when King Arthur reigned in Camelot, there lived a Cornish knight, Sir Tristan, who fell hopelessly in love with his Uncle King Mark’s bride-to-be the Irish Princess Isolde. The beautiful princess too loved her handsome knight who had valiantly slain a dragon and saved her people. Because they had unknowingly ingested a strong love potion, they had a passionate love that could not be deniedâ€¦\n\nBy Mahlia Lone\n\nThe popular Celtic legend of Tristan and Isolde was retold by generations of wandering minstrels who sang of the tragic lovers harkening to the 6th century. Celtic mythology scholars believe that the legend originated in Brittany, western France, which had been settled by Britons. The oral legend, known as the â€œvulgarâ€ version, a representative of story-telling belonging to the Dark Ages, gave the lovers more choice in carrying out their affair.Â In the refined High Middle Ages, the 12th century oAnwards the legend stressed the loversâ€™ honour in keeping with the chivalric and courtly Anglo-Norman literature.\n\nThe Story\n\nKing Mark of Cornwall ruled in the early 6th century with his seat at Castle Dor, near Fowey. He was the son of King Felix who died after an Irish raid on his castle at Tintagel. According to Arthurian legend, King Mark was violent, treacherous and cowardly by nature. His nephew Sir Tristan, on the other hand, stood for all the virtues of chivalry and was noble, brave and honourable. He also had a poetic soul and was a talented harp player.\n\nKing Anguish of Ireland, one of King Arthurâ€™s earlier enemies, was defeated by Arthur in battle and the Irish ruler was forced to accept his supremacy. However, in his later battle with King Mark of Cornwall, King Anguish emerged victorious. When King Mark refused to pay King Anguish seven years back pay for his vassalage, the Irish ruler sent his champion knight Sir Morholt to forcibly extract the payment of tribute.\n\nSir Tristan and Sir Morholt fought in single combat in a fight to the death. Tristan killed Morholt and a broken piece of his sword remained in the latterâ€™s fatal wound for all to see in the body when it was taken back to Ireland. Tristan too was wounded in the desperate fight. When his wound did not heal, he journeyed to Ireland in disguise so he could be healed by the Irish Princess Isolde, famed for her skill in healing. Isolde was the daughter of King Anguish and Queen Iseult the Elder.\n\nUpon arrival, Tristan discovered that Ireland was being terrorized by a fearsome dragon. A brave and skilled knight, Sir Tristan succeeded in killing the ferocious fire-breathing dragon. In gratitude, Princess Isolde nursed him back to health after the fight. But when she found his broken sword, putting two and two together, she realized that he was the warrior who had killed Morholt, her uncle.\n\nAt first she wanted to avenge her uncleâ€™s death, but seeing how grateful her people were to Tristan for killing the dragon that was terrorizing them and destroying their property, Isolde forgave him. Enjoying her company, Tristan lingered on at the Irish court. During his convalescence Tristan played his harp forÂ Isolde and gave her lessons in the instrument as a pretext to spend more time with her.\n\nOn his return to Cornwall, all he could talk about was the Irish princess. Hearing his nephewâ€™s high praises, King Mark decided to marry Isolde himself. Loyal and obedient as a knight is duty bound to his king, Tristan had no choice but to agree to return to Ireland and seek Isoldeâ€™s hand in marriage for his uncle the king. Back in Ireland, the matrimonial proposal was accepted as an offering of alliance and Isolde was sent to Cornwall under Tristanâ€™s care.\n\nTristan and Isolde had already developed feelings for each other but their well-established sense of honour prevented them from expressing themselves freely. To ensure her daughterâ€™s marital happiness, Queen Iseult gave the princess a drink to share with her future husband Mark. It was a magic eternal love potion. During the sea voyage from Ireland toÂ Cornwall, Isolde and Tristan inadvertently drank the potion, not knowing what it was, and fell deeply in love.\n\nUpon arriving in Cornwall, the royal marriage took place. But the young couple couldnâ€™t help but still love each other. Their passionate love affair continued in secret. Since the noble Arthurian principles didnâ€™t condone adultery, according to the story, the love potion freed Tristan and Iseult from responsibility. Mirroring the dynamics of the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle, Mark-Iseult-Tristan also all loved each other. Tristan honoured, respected, and loved King Mark as his king, mentor and father figure; Isolde owed her husband loyalty, devotion and gratitude (for his kindness to her); and Mark loved his nephew as well as his wife and felt that they were the closest to him.\n\nA series of intrigues, plots and suspense followed. The Kingâ€™s advisers warned him that Tristan and Isolde were not as innocent as they seemed. But Mark didnâ€™t want to jeopardise the fragile truce between Ireland and Cornwall and endanger his fragile kingdom till he was sure. So King Mark, his advisers and his knights made various attempts to trap the lovers and obtain proof of their guilt.\n\nEvery night, each of the three main characters had nightmares about the future. When King Mark finally got his proof positive of the affair, he resolved to punish them as cuckolding a king was grounds for treason. Tristan was sentenced to death by hanging, whileÂ Isolde was to be burnt at the stake. Taking pity on his young and beautiful wife, the king reduced her sentence to being sent to live in a leper colony where she could heal patients.\n\nThe dashing blade, Sir Tristan made a daring and exciting escape on his way to the gallows. He made a giant leap from the top of a chapel steeple and rescued Isolde. The lovers managed to escape into the forest of Morrois and took shelter there until they were discovered by Markâ€™s troops. Left with no choice, Tristan gave up Isolde, and went into exile. The King forgave Isolde.\n\nA depressed and despairing, Tristan left Cornwall by ship for Brittany, sailing across the English Channel. There he met and marriedÂ Iseult of the White Hands because she reminded him of his Isolde. His wife was the daughter of King Hoel of Brittany, a late 5th- and early 6th-century member of the ruling dynasty of Cornouaille in northwest Brittany, and a relative and loyal ally of Arthur, who had helped him conquer Gaul (northern France). Her brother was Kahedin, also mentioned in Arthurian legend. Kahedin was also to have a love affair with Brangaine, the handmaiden of Isolde of Ireland.\n\nTristan did not consummate his marriage to Iseult despite her beauty as he couldnâ€™t bear the thought of betraying his one true love.\n\nPining, he recklessly endangered his life riding to the aid of Kahedin his brother in arms, fell into ambush and was wounded by a poisoned lance.\n\nThere were alternating versions of how Tristan got wounded. In the Prose Tristan and works derived from it, Tristan was mortally wounded by Mark who treacherously stuck him with a poisoned lance while the latter was playing a harp for Isolde before he left for Brittany.Â Â According to Thomasâ€™s poetic version,Â Tristan was wounded by a poisoned lance while attempting to rescue a young woman from six knights.\n\nNo one could heal Tristanâ€™s festering wound. Much weakened and pale with loss of blood, Tristan sent Kahedin to Cornwall for Isolde as a last resort in hopes that she would be able to cure him. If she agreed to come and was on board, Kahedin would unfurl white sails on his ship, and if she did not agree the sails would be black.\n\nIn music\n\nGerman composer Richard Wagnerâ€™s phenomenal opera Tristan und Isolde (1859) by German composer Richard Wagner is considered â€œa treatise on life rather than a musical experienceâ€ and was vastly influential, groundbreaking and revelatory. In 1924, Thomas Hardy collaborated with the British composer Rutland Boughton to adapt Hardyâ€™s play into the opera The Queen of Cornwall (1924).\n\nUpon Kahedinâ€™s voyage back, Iseult, seeing the white sails, got jealous and lied to Tristan, telling him falsely that the sails were black.\n\nHopeless, Tristan died in misery before Isolde could reach him. Grief stricken, Isolde, swooning over her loverâ€™s corpse, died soon after of a broken heart. Wrenched apart in life, the lovers were reunited in death.\n\nTristan and Isolde\n\nin Literature\n\nIn the second half of the twelfth century, two French speaking Norman poets penned courtly lyrical romances of the popular legend of oral tradition. Thomas of Britain wrote his poem Tristan the earlier part between 11\n\nand 1170 and latter part between 1181 and 1190 in Old French, while the Norman poet wrote his poem also called Tristan, in the Norman French dialect in 1173.\n\nIn 1227,Â Tristan by ThomasÂ was translated by Brother Robert at the request of King Haakon Haakonson of Norway who wanted to promote the dominant Angevin-Norman (French)Â culture at his court. The Nordic King commissioned the cleric to produce translations of several French Arthurian works into Old Norse, which became very popular.\n\nAnother contemporary of BÃ©roul and Thomas, the famous French poetess Marie de France, who lived at the Medieval Norman court of Henry II, wrote a Tristan episode called Chevrefoil in one of her lais (lyrical, narrative poetry) that told the story of Tristanâ€™s clandestine return to Cornwall in which he signaled his presence to his lady love through an inscription on a hazelnut tree branch placed on the road she would travel. The intertwined honeysuckle and hazelnut tree dies when separated, as did the two lovers. Marieâ€™s lais were so widely read that they influenced the subsequent development of the whole romance and heroic literature genre.\n\nTwo 12th century poems in the Folies Tristan in Old French related Tristanâ€™s return to Marcâ€™s court disguised as a madman.Â But the most important development in French Tristaniana was the Prose Tristan of the 13th and 14th century, shortly after the completion of the Vulgate Cycle (Lancelot-Grail Cycle) in the first quarter of the 13th century.\n\nThe twelve volumes long Prose Tristan included the episode of Tristanâ€™s participation in the Quest for the Holy Grail. This had a great influence on later medieval literature, and tied the legend of Tristan and Isolde securely into Arthurian legend.\n\nAn abridged translation of the French Prose Tristan in English was Sir Thomas Maloryâ€™s The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyones, in Le Morte dâ€™ArthurÂ (circa 1469), which became a basis for all subsequent retellings of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table stories.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a renaissance or revival of Arthurian literature, mostly written in narrative verse occurred, which included the following: Lord Alfred Tennysonâ€™s poem The Last Tournament from Idylls of the King. The poem, set in Camelot, presented an the account of a tournament with the characters of King Arthur, his fool Dragonet and Sir Tristan. Matthew Arnoldâ€™s narrative poem Tristram and Iseult was based on romantic and tragic themes. Algernon Charles Swinburneâ€™s long epic poem Tristram of Lyonesse retold the story in a grand style. Thomas Hardyâ€™s one-act play The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse was published posthumously in 1923. Even all the way in America, poet Edward Arlington Robinson based his Pulitzer Prize winning poem Tristram on the legend.\n\nFrench writer and scholar and historian of medieval France, Joseph BÃ©dier in his editionÂ The Romance of Tristan and Iseult (1900) used several medieval sources to weave seamlessly a retelling of the story eloquently and with dignity. The story of the tragic lovers was also referenced in avant garde Irish writer James Joyceâ€™s literary novel Finnegans Wake (1935).\n\nBest-selling novelist Daphne du Maurier, who is from Fowey in Cornwall, finished Cornish writer Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couchâ€™s Castle Dor (1962), set in modern times but based on the original story. Prolific British author Rosalind Miles wrote a trilogy about Tristan and Isolde: The Maid of the White Hands, The Queen of the Western Isle, and The Lady of the Sea. Bengali author Sunil Gangopadhyay also based his novel Sonali Dukkho on the story.\n\nThere are many other retellings of the story written by authors in recent times.\n\nIn film\n\nNot one, but three French silent films from the early 20th century were based on the story. A controversial Tristan film Lâ€™Ã‰ternel Retour or The Eternal Return (1943), directed by Jean Delannoy and screenplay written by Jean Cocteau, made in France during the Vichy regime, reflected Nazi ideology. Renowned French director FranÃ§ois Truffaut adapted it to modern times in his film La Femme dâ€™Ã cÃ´tÃ© or The Woman Next Door (1981). In the Shadow of the Raven (1988) was set in Viking Age Iceland. There is even an animated film versionÂ the Tristan et Iseult (2002).\n\nBollywood director Subhash Ghai set the story in modern India and the United States in his musical big budget movie Pardes (1997), starring Shahrukh Khan, Mahima Chaudhary and Amrish Puri, which had the hit song I Love My India.\n\nThe most recent Tristan film was Tony Scott and Ridley Scottâ€™s Tristan & Isolde (2006) starring James Franco and Sophia Myles.\n\nThe Tristan Stone\n\nA Cornish granite menhir (long stone) called the The Tristan Stone still stands tall at 2.7 m and proud near the site of Castle Dor, in Fowey, Cornwall. The stone has a mid-6th century two line inscription â€œHere lies Drustanus, the son of Cunomorus.â€ A now missing third line was transcribed by the 16th century antiquarian John Leland as reading â€œwith the lady Ousilla.â€ The menhir marks the story of their eternal love for times to come.\n\nMubashir Khan, one of the long standing, acclaimed hairstylists in our industry, has now opened up his own training academy. When Sana Zehra goes to interview the hair maestro, she observes that his salon is not only tastefully decorated, but also as serene and calm as he is\n\nWhat made you enter the industry of hairstyling and makeup?\n\nFrom the very beginning I knew exactly what I wanted to do in life. I wanted to start my career with hair and makeup and take it from there. I hadnâ€™t even had formal training; I slowly started doing makeup first. When Tariq Amin saw me, he suggested I start cutting hair. Then I went for my formal training.\n\nWhat kind of shampoo and conditioner should we be using?\n\nThe job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair. The moment you start focusing on making your hair silky you start using a stronger product. If your target is softer silkier hair, invest in a good conditioner or a masque. I like Kerastase masques for that. Because the masque is not touching your scalp, that is the right protocol to follow. Use a plain, light weight shampoo and then you use a masque.\n\nWhat about colour safe shampoo?\n\nThatâ€™s a completely different area. Colour safe shampoo is basically sulfate free, meaning itâ€™s free of salt. Salt breaks the colour or the keratin that you may have in your hair. When you use a colour safe shampoo, it prolongs the life of your hair colour.\n\nHow often should we wash our hair?\n\nI know people who wash their hair once in 3 weeks and believe me they have the most stunning hair. They only rinse it out in between. I also know people who donâ€™t put anything on their skin, no cleanser no face wash and they have the most beautiful skin. Theory says that washing is essential but practicality wise Iâ€™ve seen otherwise. Now, that does not mean you stop washing your hair all of a sudden. Keep your scalp clean thatâ€™s my advice.\n\nAre there any treatments that can bring lifeless hair back to life?\n\nOf course! We have Mayo and Mayo plus. When you go to a salon and ask for a protein treatment, they put a masque on and put you under the dryer. Thatâ€™s not very good for your hair because it affects your hair colour. Your hair will look nice and soft for a day or two max. Our hair mayo is pure protein made from five to six natural ingredients, such as cultured oils, honey and eggs; itâ€™s extremely good for hair fall and dry hair. The results are amazing!\n\nWomen have a tendency of oiling their hair and leaving it on for days. Thoughts?\n\nThatâ€™s not very good for your hair. Leaving it on for couple of hours is okay but nothing more than that or your pores will get clogged.\n\nThere is a huge cry of hair fall in Karachi. What is going on?\n\nYou know itâ€™s interesting everyone thinks that change of water causes hair fall. In fact, hair fall is caused by change of climate. It takes about six months for your hair to settle. Some people will lose hair during winter; some will lose it in summer. Nourish your scalp. I might sound like Iâ€™m trying to sell my product but Mayo treatments do work.\n\nWhatâ€™s the best hair style for any face shape?\n\nA ponytail! Itâ€™s simple, practical, looks neat and suits everyone unless you are unlucky.\n\nHow can you maintain a colour at home?\n\nIt is actually a colouristâ€™s job to give you a colour that improves further at home. The nature of colour is such that it will always change no matter what you do. So most people when they pick a colour just think about what will look right at the moment than what it will look like three to four weeks in the future.\n\nHaving worked with many famous faces, ex-model Aaminah Haq to this day still remains MubashAr’s favourite\n\nWhose hair you would have loved to work on?\n\nI would have loved to work on Marilyn Monroeâ€™s head of hair. We did a shoot with Aaminah Haq inspired by Marilyn. I think Marilyn had such presence and personality, it would have been awesome.\n\nYouâ€™ve worked with so many celebrities, who is your favourite?\n\nI have shot with a lot of celebs and, in my experience; I loved working with Barbara Sharif. She just transforms. Film star Reema has always been naturally beautiful with a lovely personality. But in terms of talent and skills Iâ€™ve yet to be impressed by someone like Aaminah Haq. She was the most talented and the most hardworking model Iâ€™ve known.\n\nWhat are the biggest hair care dos and donâ€™ts?\n\nWomen abuse their hair when they wash it and then squeeze it after. I canâ€™t even begin to tell you how damaging that is to the hair. Hair is elastic and if you stretch it to its limit then you are damaging it. Back in the day, women used to even beat their hair with a towel after washing it. Women also unravel tangles starting near the scalp instead of the ends.\n\nTo get a better understanding of your hair, donâ€™t try to make it listen to you but the other way round.\n\nBeauty trend you think that suits everyoneâ€¦\n\nLip gloss\n\nThree products one women should never leave home without.\n\nLip Colour\n\nTissue\n\nSunglasses\n\nWeirdest request ever made by a client?\n\nHaving dead straight hair, she wanted to look like Julia Roberts but wouldnâ€™t let me touch a hairdryer.\n\nOur hair mayo is pure protein made from cultured oils, honey and eggs; Itâ€™s extremely good for hair fall and dry hair\n\nWorst beauty and hair products?\n\nWaxes are really bad for your hair and Iâ€™m not a fan of fake bases.\n\nLamest beauty trend?\n\nThose long fingernails. Canâ€™t understand.\n\nIf you werenâ€™t in this business you would beâ€¦\n\nAn architect\n\nThree qualities that got you where you are today?\n\nFocus\n\nHard work\n\nPassion\n\nMovie with the greatest ending?\n\nThe trilogy: Before Sunrise, After Sunset and Before Midnight\n\nWorst pitfall of the job?\n\nNothing\n\nCraziest thing you did for love?\n\nI ordered flowers from Switzerland!"
