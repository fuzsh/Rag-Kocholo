        "text": "PL3.1 Analysis of RNAseq from 4400 individuals in the 100,000 Genomes Project identifies new potential diagnoses\n\nJenny Lord 1, Carolina Jaramillo Oquendo1, Niall McGinness2, Alexander Ho2, Terena James3, Mark Ross3, Lily Hoa2, Greg Elgar2, Diana Baralle1\n\n1University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom; 2Genomics England, London, United Kingdom; 3Illumina Cambridge Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nBackground: Diagnosis of rare disorders has been revolutionised by whole exome and genome sequencing (WES/WGS), yet despite these advances, around half of sequenced patients do not receive a molecular diagnosis. Interpretation of variants which affect splicing and gene regulation has lagged behind coding variation, and improvement in this area will boost diagnostic yields. Here we present early analyses of whole blood based transcriptome sequencing data from over 4,400 individuals with various rare disorders recruited to the 100,000 Genomes Project lacking a molecular diagnosis from WGS.\n\nMethods: Gene expression outliers were identified by OUTRIDER via DROP and splicing outliers were identified using LeafCutterMD. Candidate outlier events were assessed in combination with WGS data to identify underlying genetic causation, and gene panels were applied to flag candidate diagnostic events. Application of additional tools for identifying splicing outliers (rMATS-turbo and FRASER) is in progress.\n\nResults: An average of 5.4 expression and 5.3 splicing outliers were identified per proband genome wide, with 0.2 expression, 0.2 splicing outliers per proband when restricting to relevant gene panels. Filtering and assessment of candidates is ongoing, but early estimates suggests 21% of the cohort have a credible diagnostic candidate for review. Updated analyses will be presented and interesting examples highlighted, including expression outliers tagging structural variants and deep intronic variants causing complex splicing abnormalities.\n\nDiscussion: Although analyses are ongoing, early work has found new diagnostic candidates in ~20% of probands, which is expected to lead to a significant uplift in diagnostic yield.\n\nGrant References: NIHR RP-2016-07-011\n\nConflict of Interest: Jenny Lord: None declared, Carolina Jaramillo Oquendo: None declared, Niall McGinness Genomics England, Alexander Ho Genomics England, Terena James Illumina Cambridge Ltd., Mark Ross Illumina Cambridge Ltd., Lily Hoa\n\nPL3.2 Rapid, definitive treatment of phenylketonuria in variant-humanized mice with corrective editing\n\nDominique Brooks 1, Kiran Musunuru1, Xiao Wang1\n\n1Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Cardiovascular Institute, Department of Medicine, and Department of Genetics, Philadelphia, United States\n\nPhenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, results in the accumulation of blood phenylalanine (Phe) to neurotoxic levels. Current dietary and medical treatments are chronic and reduce, rather than normalize, blood Phe levels. Among the most frequently occurring PAH variants in PKU patients is P281L (c.842C > T). Using a CRISPR prime-edited hepatocyte cell line and a humanized PKU mouse model, we demonstrate efficient in vitro and in vivo correction of the P281L variant with CRISPR adenine base editing. With delivery of ABE8.8 mRNA and either of two guide RNAs in vivo using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in humanized PKU mice, we observe complete and long-term durable normalization (>90%) of blood Phe levels within 48 h of treatment, resulting from corrective PAH editing in the liver. We have comprehensively assessed off-target editing by ABE8.8 with one of the guide RNAs and have made modifications to the guide RNA to eliminate off-target editing while preserving efficacy. These studies nominate a drug candidate that we are further developing for testing in early-phase clinical trials with PKU patients. We are extending this work to additional humanized mouse models with PAH variants that are not amenable to standard base editing, including R408W (c.1222C>T) and c.1066-11G > A, the most frequent variants reported in PKU patients worldwide. With delivery of a prime editor using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, we observe complete and durable normalization of blood Phe levels.\n\nConflict of Interest: Dominique Brooks: None declared, Kiran Musunuru Verve Therapeutics, Variant Bio, Verve Therapeutics, Variant Bio, Xiao Wang: None declared\n\nPL3.3 SMAD4-associated Myhre-syndrome mutations are under positive selection in the male germline\n\nKatherine Wood 1;2;3, Ronald Spencer Tong1;2;3, Viviana Cordeddu4, Alice Traversa5, Marialetizia Motta6, Viviana Caputo5, Valérie Cormier-Daire7, Andrew Wilkie1;2;3, Stephen Twigg1;2;3, Marco Tartaglia6, Anne Goriely1;2;3\n\n1University of Oxford, MRC-Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom; 2University of Oxford, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom; 3University of Oxford, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom; 4Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Rome, Italy; 5Sapienza University, Department of Experimental Medicine, Rome, Italy; 6Bambino Gesu` Children´s Hospital, Molecular Genetics and Functional Genomics, Rome, Italy; 7Institut Imagine, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Service Genetique Clinique, Paris, France\n\nWhile it is widely thought that de novo mutations (DNMs) occur randomly, we have previously shown that some DNMs are preferably transmitted because they are positively selected in ageing testes. These “selfish” mutations cause disorders with shared features including: (1) high apparent germline mutation rate, (2) significant increase of the father’s age and (3) exclusive paternal origin; pointing to their origin in the ageing male germline. To date, all known selfish genes cluster within the RTK-RAS-MAPK pathway, a critical modulator of testicular homeostasis.\n\nIn previous screens for selfish genes, we identified variants in SMAD4, a key effector of Activin/BMP/TGFB signalling, associated with Myhre syndrome, suggesting that these DNMs may be clonally expanding in ageing testes.\n\nTo assess the selfish nature of Myhre syndrome-causing SMAD4 mutations, we asked whether they fulfil the 3 criteria defined above. We developed an ultra-sensitive enrichment-based assay to analyse 65 sperm and blood samples from individuals of different ages. We show that the c.1498A>G (p.I500V) mutation was commonly detected in sperm with 75% samples carrying mutation levels >10−6; reaching ~1:9650 in the semen of a 60-year old man; and correlated positively with donor age. Using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrate that positively-selected variants in the germline exhibit gain-of-function properties. Finally, analysis of 14 informative trios demonstrates that, in all cases, the causative mutation is present on the paternally-derived allele.\n\nTaken together, these data suggest that SMAD4 is the first gene outside the RTK-RAS-MAPK pathway associated with selfish selection.\n\nFunding: Wellcome 219476/Z/19/Z; Italian Health Ministry 2019_5x1000\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nPL3.4 Early evolutionary branching across spatial domains predisposes to clonal replacement under chemotherapy in neuroblastoma\n\nJenny Karlsson1, Hiroaki Yasui1;2, Adriana Manas Nunez3, Natalie Andersson 1, Karin Hansson3, Kristina Aaltonen3, Caroline Jansson1, Geoffroy Durand1, Minjun Yang1, Subhayan Chattopadhyay1, Kajsa Paulsson1, Diana Spierings4, Floris Foijer4, Anders Valind1;5, Daniel Bexell3, David Gisselsson Nord1;6\n\n1Lund University, Instution of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Clinical Genetics., Lund, Sweden; 2Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nagoya, Japan; 3Lund University, Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund, Sweden; 4University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing (ERIBA), Groningen, Netherlands; 5Skåne University Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Lund, Sweden; 6Laboratory Medicine Skåne, Department of Pathology, Lund, Sweden\n\nBackground: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric solid malignancy outside the central nervous system. Little is known about how NB cells surviving chemotherapy in the primary tumor are related to the lineages dominating prior to treatment.\n\nMethods: We performed whole genome genotyping across 89 tumor regions from 12 NBs. Targeted resequencing and single cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) was performed on a subset of the samples. This was followed by phylogenetic analyses and spatial mapping of subclone geographies before and after chemotherapy to assess the impact of treatment on the clonal landscape.\n\nResults: Under effective treatment and tumor shrinkage, densely packed territories of closely related subclones present at diagnosis were replaced by distantly related survivor subclones, a pattern denoted collateral clonal replacement. Tumors that progressed under treatment instead displayed linear evolution where the ancestors of subclones dominating later in disease were present already at diagnosis. These patterns were confirmed both in xenograft models and in cell culture. Phylogenies based on scWGS illustrated that a rich repertoire of subclones emerges early and lays the foundation for clonal replacement under treatment.\n\nConclusion: We reveal two contrasting response scenarios following chemotherapy, depending on whether the tumor initially responds significantly or not. We also show that evolutionary branching early in NB pathogenesis sets the stage for clonal replacement under effective therapy, which has direct implications for how to sample these tumors for genomic profiling.\n\nGrant references: Swedish Research Council, Cancer Society, Childhood Cancer Fund, Royal Physiographic Society and LMK Foundation.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nPL3.5 Limb girdle muscular disease caused by HMGCR mutation and statin myopathy treatable with mevalonolactone\n\nYuval Yogev 1, Zamir Shorer2, Ohad Wormser1, Max Drabkin1, Daniel Halperin1, Arie Koifman3, Geula Davidov4;5, Hila Nudelman4;5, Raz Zarivach4;5, Ilan Shelef6, Ohad Shmuel Birk1;3\n\n1Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, The Morris Kahn Laboratory of Human Genetics at the National Institute of Biotechnology in the Negev, Be’er Sheva, Israel; 2Soroka University Medical Center, Department of Pediatric Neurology, Be’er Sheva, Israel; 3Soroka University Medical Center, Genetics Institute, Be’er Sheva, Israel; 4Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Department of Life Sciences, Be’er Sheva, Israel; 5Ben Gurion University of the Negev, National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Be’er Sheva, Israel; 6Soroka University Medical Center, Department of Radiology, Be’er Sheva, Israel\n\nBackground: Myopathy is the main adverse effect of the widely prescribed statin drug class. Statins exert their beneficial effect through inhibiting HMG CoA-reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. The mechanism of statin myopathy is yet to be resolved, and its treatment is insufficient.\n\nMethods: We performed phenotypic delineation and genetic studies of a novel form of human limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), through homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing, followed by functional analysis of the disease-causing variant using confocal microscopy, biochemical and biophysical methods. We then biochemically synthesized and purified mevalonolactone, and tested the safety of its oral administration in mice. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of oral administration of the synthesized and purified mevalonolactone in human LGMD and in a statin myopathy model in mice\n\nResults: We demonstrate using genetic, statistical, and functional methods that a pathogenic homozygous loss-of-function missense mutation in HMGCR, encoding HMG CoA-reductase, causes adult-onset severe progressive LGMD. We synthesized and purified mevalonolactone, never administered to humans before, and establish the safety of its oral administration in mice. We then show that its oral administration is effective in treating a human patient with no significant adverse effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that oral mevalonolactone resolved statin-induced myopathy in mice.\n\nConclusions: HMGCR mutation causes a novel late-onset severe progressive muscular dystrophy, which shows similar features to statin-induced myopathy. Our findings indicate that Mevalonolactone is effective both in the treatment of hereditary HMGCR myopathy and in a murine model of statin myopathy.\n\nConflict of Interest: Yuval Yogev Folks foundation grant, A patent has been filed for an invention in this study for YY and OSB, Zamir Shorer: None declared, Ohad Wormser: None declared, Max Drabkin: None declared, Daniel Halperin: None declared, Arie Koifman: None declared, Geula Davidov: None declared, Hila Nudelman: None declared, Raz Zarivach: None declared, Ilan Shelef: None declared, Ohad Shmuel Birk The research was funded by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 2034/18) awarded to OSB, as well as by the National Knowledge Center for Rare/Orphan Diseases of the Israel Ministry of Science, Technology and Space, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, A patent has been filed for an invention in this study for YY and OSB\n\nPL3.6 Eye2Gene: a novel AI algorithm enables phenotype-driven gene prioritisation directly from retinal scans in inherited retinal diseases\n\nNikolas Pontikos 1;2, William Woof1, Miriam Bauwens3, Saoud Al-Khuzaei4, Behnam Javanmardi5, Michalis Georgiou1;2, Malena Daich Varela1;2, Thales Antonio Cabral De Guimaraes1;2, Muhammad Moghul1;2, Alice Davidson1, Panos Sergouniotis6, Jamie Ellingford6, Konstantinos Balaskas1;2, Alison J. Hardcastle1, Susan Downes4, Gavin Arno1;2, Peter Krawitz5, Damian Smedley7, Elfride De Baere3, Andrew Webster1;2, Michel Michaelides1;2, Omar Mahroo1;2\n\n1UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, United Kingdom; 2Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; 3Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; 4Oxford Eye Hospital, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom; 5University Hospital Bonn, Institute for Genomic Statistics and Bioinformatics, Bonn, Germany; 6University of Manchester, Division of Evolution, Infection and Genomic Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester, United Kingdom; 7Queen Mary University of London, Clinical Pharmacology and Precision Medicine, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground/Objectives: The ACMG PP4 criterion is invoked in the assessment of the pathogenicity of a variant when the phenotype is deemed specific to the gene and is relevant to inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). Approaches such as Exomiser use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prioritise genes based on gene-phenotype relationships. However, identifying specific HPO terms is often challenging and time-consuming, and requires specialist knowledge. We have developed an AI algorithm, Eye2Gene, capable of automatically identifying likely causative genes directly from retinal scans of patients with IRDs without the need for HPO terms.\n\nMethods: We benchmarked Eye2Gene on IRD cases with a known gene diagnosis for which whole exome/genome, retinal scans and detailed HPO descriptions were available. We included 130 IRD cases with a known gene diagnosis, each having at least 3 HPO terms available which were specified by experienced clinicians. HPO gene scores, as provided by Exomiser, were compared to the Eye2Gene gene scores.\n\nResults: We found that Eye2Gene provided a rank for the correct gene higher or equal to the HPO-only score in over 75% of the cases, showing that image-based gene predictions can outperform HPO-only predictions for IRDs.\n\nConclusion: We have developed an AI approach, Eye2Gene, able to infer directly from retinal scans the probability of a causative gene. Using Eye2Gene to score genes, it is now possible to incorporate PP4 into variant interpretation in an objective way, without relying on phenotypic labels such as HPO for IRDs. This approach could potentially increase the diagnostic yield in IRDs.\n\nConflict of Interest: Nikolas Pontikos full-time University College London and part-time Moorfields Eye Hospital, Principal investigator on NIHR AI Award (AI_AWARD02488), Phenopolis Ltd unsalaried co-founder and director, William Woof full-time UCL, co-investigator NIHR AI Award (AI_AWARD02488)., Miriam Bauwens: None declared, Saoud Al-Khuzaei: None declared, Behnam Javanmardi full-time Bonn, by IIR-DE-002818 from Shire/Takeda and by the European Reference Network for Rare Malformation Syndromes, Intellectual and Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ERN-ITHACA), Michalis Georgiou full-time UCL and Moorfields Eye Hospital, Malena Daich Varela full-time UCL and Moorfields Eye Hospital, Thales Antonio Cabral De Guimaraes full-time UCL and Moorfields Eye Hospital, Muhammad Moghul UCL and Moorfields Eye Hospital, Phenopolis Ltd unsalaried co-founder and director, Alice Davidson full-time UCL, UKRI Future Leader Fellowship, Panos Sergouniotis full-time, Jamie Ellingford full-time, Konstantinos Balaskas full-time Moorfields Eye Hospital, co-investigator NIHR AI Award (AI_AWARD02488), Alison J.

Integrator subunit 11 (INTS11) is the catalytic subunit that cleaves nascent RNAs. To date, three integrator complex subunits have been associated with human disease (INTS1, INTS8 and INTS13). Here, we describe 15 individuals from 10 unrelated families with biallelic variants in INTS11, who present with global developmental delay, intellectual disability and progressive pontocerebellar atrophy, and detail functional studies assessing these variants.\n\nMethods: We generated null alleles in flies and show that IntS11 is an essential gene expressed in a subset of larval and adult CNS neurons and glia. Finally, we tested seven of the human INTS11 variants using orthologous modeling in Drosophila.\n\nResults: Loss of dIntS11 is lethal but can be fully rescued by a wild-type fly cDNA. Two of the changes fail to rescue lethality of null mutants indicating that they are strong loss-of-function variants. Five other substitutions rescue lethality but cause a short lifespan. When these variants are expressed at reduced levels, the flies display bang sensitivity and impaired locomotor activity indicating that they are partial loss-of-function variants (LoF).\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that individuals with biallelic LoF alleles die at an early age whereas most individuals compound heterozygous for hypomorphic alleles have milder symptoms. Here we provide data on the functional consequence of biallelic INTS11 variants underlying a novel complex neurological disorder.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declare\n\nC01.2 Biallelic variants in NSUN6 cause an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder\n\nFrancesca Mattioli 1, Lina Worpenberg1, Cai-Tao Li2, Nazia Ibrahim1;3, Shagufta Naz3, Saima Sharif3, Saghar Ghasemi Firouzabadi4, Shohreh Vosoogh4, Radoslava Saraeva-Lamri5, Laure Raymond5, Carlos Trujillo6;7, Nicolas Guex8, Stylianos Antonarakis9, Muhammad Ansar10, Hossein Darvish4, Ru-Juan Liu2, Jean-Yves Roignant1;11, Alexandre Reymond1\n\n1Center for Integrative Genomics—UNIL, Lausanne, Switzerland; 2Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai, China; 3Lahore College for Women University, Department of zoology, Lahore, Pakistan; 4Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran; 5Eurofins Biomnis, Lyon, France; 6Universidad CES, Departmento de Genetica, Medellin, Colombia; 7Genome Unit, KFMRC, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; 8Bioinformatics Competence Center-UNIL, Lausanne, Switzerland; 9University of Geneva, Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, Geneva, Switzerland; 10University of Lausanne, Department of Ophthalmology, Lausanne, Switzerland; 11Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Mainz, Germany\n\nBackground/Objectives:While the leading causes of neurodevelopmental diseases (NDD) in Western countries are autosomal dominant de novo mutations, autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance is common in countries with frequent parental consanguinity. Due to the extreme heterogeneity of NDD about half of the cases remain without diagnosis.\n\nRNA modifications have emerged as an important post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. Among these, the 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification, driven by NSUN methyltransferases is a widespread RNA modification found in mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA and implicated in RNA stability, processing and translation. NSUN2 and NSUN3 were previously associated with Mendelian NDD.\n\nMethods: We combined exome sequencing of consanguineous families with functional characterization to identify a new NDD gene.\n\nResults: We identified three unrelated consanguineous families with deleterious homozygous variants in NSUN6. Two of these variants are truncating. One maps to the first exon and is predicted to lead to the absence of NSUN6 via non-sense mediated decay, while the second one is in the last exon and leads to a protein unable to fold correctly. Likewise, we demonstrated that the missense variant identified in the third family has lost its enzymatic activity and is unable to bind the S-adenosyl-L-methionine methyl donor. The affected individuals present with developmental delay, intellectual disability, motor delay, and behavioral anomalies. We engineered an animal model by homozygously ablating the Drosophila NSUN6 ortholog. Mutants displayed locomotion defects and learning impairment.\n\nConclusion: Overall, our data provide evidence that biallelic pathogenic variants in NSUN6 cause one form of AR intellectual disability and establish another link between RNA modification and cognition.\n\nConflict of Interest: Francesca Mattioli: None declared, Lina Worpenberg: None declared, Cai-Tao Li: None declared, Nazia Ibrahim: None declared, Shagufta Naz: None declared, Saima Sharif: None declared, Saghar Ghasemi Firouzabadi: None declared, Shohreh Vosoogh: None declared, Radoslava Saraeva-Lamri Eurofins Biomnis, Laure Raymond Eurofins Biomnis, Carlos Trujillo: None declared, Nicolas Guex: None declared, Stylianos Antonarakis Co-founder and CEO of Medigenome, Swiss Institute of Genomic Medicine, Muhammad Ansar: None declared, Hossein Darvish: None declared, Ru-Juan Liu: None declared, Jean-Yves Roignant: None declared, Alexandre Reymond: None declare\n\nC01.3 De novo missense variants in phosphatidylinositol kinase PIP5KIγ underlie a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome associated with altered phosphoinositide signaling\n\nManuela Morleo 1;2, Rossella Venditti1;3, Evangelos Theodorou4, Lauren C.

Mutations in PI metabolizing enzymes cause a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Lowe and Joubert syndrome, both of which are due to mutations in phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] phosphatases, and thus associated with increased levels of PI(4,5)P2.\n\nMethods: Whole exome or genome sequencing was performed. Research and clinical teams were connected with GeneMatcher. Immunofluorescence experiments and quantification were performed on patient’s fibroblasts. A zebrafish (Danio rerio) model was generated.\n\nResults: We identified three recurrent de novo heterozygous missense variants in the PIP5K1C gene, which encodes an isoform of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K1γ), in nine unrelated children exhibiting intellectual disability, developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures, visual abnormalities and dysmorphic features. We provide evidence that the PIP5K1C variants result in an increase of the endosomal PI(4,5)P2 pool, giving rise to ectopic recruitment of filamentous actin at early endosomes (EEs) that in turn causes dysfunction in EE trafficking. In addition, we generated an in vivo zebrafish model that recapitulates the disorder.\n\nConclusions: Our data provide compelling evidence that these three PIP5K1C variants result in a novel neurodevelopmental disorder associated with aberrant PI signaling.\n\nGrant References: Telethon Undiagnosed Diseases Program (GSP15001); the NIH (U01HG007690,1UL1TR001102); Programme Investissements d’Avenir IHU FOReSIGHT (ANR-18-IAHU-01); Tuscany Region Call for Health 2018 (DECODE-EE); France Genomic Medicine Plan 2025 (SeqOIA); AIRC (MFAG2020_25174); RD-Connect (FP7-N.305444).\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC01.4 CRISPR-engineered disruption of POGZ in neuronal lines alters synaptic pathways through indirect epigenetic effects\n\nMariana Moysés-Oliveira 1;2;3, Yating Liu1;2, Serkan Erdin1;2, Dadi Gao1;2, Riya Bhavsar1;3, Kathryn O’Keefe1, Kiana Mohajeri1;2;3, Phillip Boone1;2;4, Gabriela Xavier1;2;3, Calwing Liao1;3, Aiqun Li5;6, Rachita Yadav1;2, Monica Salani1, Benjamin Currall1, Celine De Esch1, Derek Tai1;2;3, James Gusella1;7;8, Douglas Ruderfer9;10, Kristen Brennand5;6;11, Michael Talkowski1;2;3\n\n1Massachusetts General Hospital, Center for Genomic Medicine, Boston, United States; 2Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Department of Neurology, Boston, United States; 3Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Cambridge, United States; 4Boston Children’s Hospital, Division of Genetics and Genomics, Boston, United States; 5Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, New York, United States; 6Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Nash Family Department of Neuroscience, New York, United States; 7Blavatnik Institute, Harvard Medical School, Department of Genetics, Boston, United States; 8Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United States; 9Vanderbilt Genetics Institute, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Nashville, United States; 10Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Nashville, United States; 11Yale University New Haven, Department of Psychiatry, New Haven, United States\n\nPOGZ (Pogo transposable element-derived protein with ZNF domain) is strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), yet little is known about its direct and indirect regulatory mechanisms. On two independent human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) backgrounds, we created an extensive allelic series of 36 CRISPR-engineered clones harboring POGZ loss of function (LoF) variants and 30 unaltered clones exposed to identical editing conditions. All 66 hiPSC models were differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) and Ngn2-induced glutamatergic neurons (iNs), followed by RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing. POGZ disruption resulted in both reduced and increased expression of its regulatory targets, with the direction of effect dependent on cell-type and predicted POGZ interactors. Differential gene expression analyses indicated that heterozygous and homozygous POGZ LoF disturbed genes associated with synaptic function in iNs, and extracellular matrix organization in NSCs and iNs. In heterozygous models, ATAC-seq revealed unchanged chromatin accessibility for POGZ regulatory targets, but footprinting disruption of other transcription factors that occurred more often at promoters of differentially expressed genes associated with synaptic function. Neurite arborization and synaptic activity were increased in iNs with POGZ homozygous LoF mutations but unaltered in heterozygous models. In iNs derived from the same hiPSC background, we observed significant convergence on disruption of cytokine-related pathways by POGZ, MEF2C, and SCN2A heterozygous LoF mutants. Overall, the signatures observed in these isogenic allelic series provided insights into cell-type-specific POGZ regulatory mechanisms and shared molecular consequences between different ASD/NDD-associated genes, suggesting key points of convergence on neurodevelopmental pathologies.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC01.5 De novo variants in KDM2A cause a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder - virtual\n\nKonrad Platzer1, Eric Anderson2, Sukhleen Kour2, Deepa Rajan2, Senta Schönnagel1, Laura-Marie Pilgram1, Karen Stals3, Deirdre Donnelly4, Siobhan O’Sullivan5, John Mantovani6, Pia Zacher7, Nicolas Chatron8, Pauline MONIN8, severine drunat9, Julie Cohen10, Kirsty McWalter11, Pedro Sanchez-Lara12, Katheryn Grand12, Hyung-Goo Kim13, Rebecca Belles14, Klaske D.

Variants in genes of the epigenetic machinery, including multiple KDMs, have previously been described to cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, KDM2A was an appealing candidate gene for further investigation after the initial identification of a de novo missense variant in an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nMethods: Through international collaboration and matchmaking, we identified heterozygous de novo variants in KDM2A in twelve unrelated individuals. We use cell and fly models as well as genome-wide methylation analysis to establish gene disease causality.\n\nResults: Affected individuals showed mild to severe intellectual disability and a spectrum of epilepsy, microcephaly, autism and facial dysmorphism. De novo variants comprise seven missense variants and five truncating variants. We provide several lines of evidence for causation through (1) in silico prediction and structural modelling of variants in a gene constraint for both missense and truncating variants; (2) an aberrant subcellular distribution pattern of mutated KDM2A with patient specific variants in a mammalian cell model; (3) expression of patient specific mutant KDM2A in Drosophila melanogaster caused a more severe external eye degenerative phenotype as compared to WT KDM2A and (4) aberrant genome-wide methylation profiles in blood derived patient DNA. Further testing of developmental abnormalities and motor defects in Drosophila melanogaster are ongoing.\n\nConclusion: Taken together, we firmly establish heterozygous de novo variants in KDM2A as a novel cause of a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC01.6 Biallelic loss of function variants in WBP4, encoding a spliceosome protein, identified in individuals with syndromic neurodevelopmental delay\n\nEden Engal1, Kaisa Teele Oja2;3, Ophir Geminder1, Thuy Linh Le4, Naama Elefant5, Naama Zvi5, Maha Zaki6, Joseph Gleeson7;8, Tamar Harel1;5, Orly Elpeleg1;5, Kai Muru2;3, Sander Pajusalu2;3, Monica H Wojcik9, Reza Maroofian10, Chris Gordon4, Katrin Ounap2;3, Maayan Salton5, Hagar Mor-Shaked 1;5\n\n1Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel; 2Tartu University Hospital, Genetics and Personalized Medicine Clinic, Tartu, Estonia; 3Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia; 4Institute Imagine, Paris, France; 5Hadassah Medical Organization, Department of Genetics, Jerusalem, Israel; 6Human Genetics and Genome Research Institute, Department of Clinical Genetics, Cairo, Egypt; 7University of California San Diego Core Bio, Department of Neurosciences, San Diego, United States; 8Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine, San Diego, United States; 9Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, United States; 10UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Department of Neuromuscular Disease, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground: The spliceosome is a complex of RNA and proteins responsible for promoting accurate splicing. Over two dozen spliceosome proteins are involved in human diseases, also referred to as spliceosomopathies. WBP4 (WW Domain Binding Protein 4) is part of the early spliceosomal complex, and was not described before in the context of human pathologies.\n\nMethods: Following informed consent, individuals underwent exome or genome sequencing. Protein analysis included immunoblotting with anti-WBP4. RNA Sequencing and analysis was performed on primary fibroblasts.\n\nResults: Eleven patients, from nine families ascertained through GeneMatcher, were diagnosed with a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome with variable manifestations. Clinical manifestations included hypotonia, global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, brain abnormalities, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal abnormalities. Genetic analysis revealed overall four different homozygous loss-of-function variants in WBP4. Immunoblotting on patient fibroblasts from two patients with different genetic variants demonstrated complete loss of protein. RNA sequencing analysis uncovered shared abnormal splicing patterns, including enrichment for abnormalities of the nervous system and musculoskeletal system genes, suggesting that the overlapping differentially spliced genes are related to the common phenotypes of the probands.\n\nConclusions: Biallelic variants in WBP4 cause a spliceosomopathy. Further functional studies are called for better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenicity.\n\nFunding: PRG471.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC02.1 Discovery and targeted rescue of functional signatures associated with X-Linked dystonia-parkinsonism in postmortem brains and neuronal models\n\nRachita Yadav 1;2;3, Christine Vaine2;3, Aloysius Domingo1;2;3, Dadi Gao1;2;3, Shivangi Shah2;3, Ellen Penney2;3, Siddharth Reed1, Serkan Erdin1, John Lemanski1, Riya Bhavsar1, Kathryn O’Keefe1, Celine De Esch1, Moira McMahon4, Michaela Jackson4, Margo Courtney4, Joseph Ochaba4, Holly Kordasiewicz4, C.

From de novo assembled XDP genome and transcriptome datasets, we discovered aberrant splicing (AS_i32) and intron retention (IR) that was specific to XDP cases and localized proximal to novel SVA insertion within intron 32 of the TAF1 gene on a founder haplotype, as well as a modest but significant reduction (~18%) of TAF1 expression. We generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal models and demonstrated rescue of these disrupted splicing and expression signatures through CRISPR excision of the causal SVA. We have now replicated these XDP-specific hallmarks in 21 postmortem brain tissues across the 15 brain regions from Filipino cases and saw the strongest signatures in brain regions associated with dystonia, such as cerebellum and striatum. Motivated by the convergence of in vitro and post-mortem tissue results, we designed a neural stem-cell based platform for testing molecular therapy for this disease in partnership with Ionis Therapeutics using 37 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that tiled the intron 32 region of TAF1 proximal to the causal SVA mutation. Overall, targeted and capture RNA sequencing of 1556 samples revealed that ASO therapy could ameliorate the aberrant AS/IR of TAF1 and 43% of the transcriptome-wide XDP expression signatures, including rescue of established neurodegenerative pathways such as GPCR signaling, cation channel and neuropeptide hormone activity. This study highlights the potential of exploiting simultaneous genomics discovery and precision therapeutic research in Mendelian disorders and rare disease research.\n\nConflict of Interest: Rachita Yadav: None declared, Christine Vaine: None declared, Aloysius Domingo: None declared, Dadi Gao: None declared, Shivangi Shah: None declared, Ellen Penney: None declared, Siddharth Reed: None declared, Serkan Erdin: None declared, John Lemanski: None declared, Riya Bhavsar: None declared, Kathryn O’Keefe: None declared, Celine De Esch: None declared, Moira McMahon Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Ca, USA, Michaela Jackson Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Ca, USA, Margo Courtney Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Ca, USA, Joseph Ochaba Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Ca, USA, Holly Kordasiewicz Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, Ca, USA, C.

Early teeth loss is followed by progressive bone resorption, atrophied ridges, and reduced vertical dimension of occlusion hindering the construction of a suitable prosthesis. Bone monocular cells (BMMNCs) have been used for bone regeneration as they contain a fraction of stem cells. Replantation is a technique used to preserve avulsed teeth, it showed success however, usually followed by ankylosis and root resorption. Here, a new technique is introduced in which a modified replantation technique is used in combination with BMMNCs.\n\nMethods: This study included 2 patients diagnosed with PLS, their canines were extracted, endodonticaly treated, disinfected using a 980 nm diode laser, and replanted. A combination of; autologous BMNCs, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), and nano-hydroxyapatite was added to the bony socket before the replantation. Clinical and radiographic assessment was performed at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.\n\nResults: All the replanted teeth were successfully fixed with no mobility after 6 months. No signs of ankylosis or root resorption were detected either clinically or radiologically throughout the follow-up period.\n\nConclusion: Introducing this modified replantation technique using stem cells provides hope for patients with PLS to preserve their own teeth and subsequently the alveolar bone expanding their restoration options which will help improve the lifestyle and health of those patients.\n\nGrant References: Science and Technology Development Funding Authority (STDF), young Researcher Grant (STDF - YRG– Call 10, Grant number 33438, 2019).\n\nConflict of Interest: ahmad abd Elazeem full, member in a project, Mohamed Abdel Kader Full, Member in a project, yasmin khalil full, member in a project, Nermeen Ahmed full, Principle investigator\n\nC02.3 Challenges, insights and outcomes of a clinically integrated multi-omic rare disease program, RDNow, for individuals who remain undiagnosed after clinical genomic sequencing\n\nTiong Yang Tan 1;2;3, Michelle De Silva1;2;3, Katrina Bell2;3, Lyndon Gallacher1;2;3, Rocio Rius2;3;4, Kirsten Allan1;2, Natasha J Brown1;2;3, Natalie Tan1;2;3, Smitha Kumble1;2;3, Russell Gear1;2;3, Cas Simons2;3;4, David Stroud1;2;5, David Thorburn2;3, John Christodoulou1;2;3, Sue White1;2;3\n\n1Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Parkville, Australia; 2Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Parkville, Australia; 3University of Melbourne, Department of Paediatrics, Parkville, Australia; 4Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Centre for Population Genomics, Darlinghurst, Australia; 5University of Melbourne, Department of Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Parkville, Australia\n\nBackground: Genomic technologies are transforming diagnostic efficiency and can guide precision child health by enabling targeted treatments. However, we need to improve diagnostic yield and overcome the barriers of knowledge, systems and lack of natural history data to access clinical trials. The Rare Diseases Now (RDNow) program is a multifaceted, clinically integrated rare disease pathway from diagnosis to clinical trials and therapies.\n\nMethods: Individuals who remain undiagnosed after clinical exome/genome sequencing are recruited on referral from genetics or other medical subspecialties. A bespoke testing strategy is designed from a suite of multi-omic technologies and informed consent obtained. Genomic reanalysis may be undertaken prior to additional tests, while family-based genomic sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, deep sequencing, long-read sequencing or other functional analyses are deployed depending on clinical phenotype and prior testing.\n\nResults: Testing strategies: ES/GS reanalysis, n = 67; Singleton ES/GS, n = 22; Family-based ES, n = 149; Family-based GS+RNAseq, n = 96; Deep sequencing, n = 9; Long-read sequencing, n = 5; Transcriptomics, n = 8; Proteomics n = 14. Of the 256 families recruited, sequencing and analysis is complete for 65 families and for 37 of them we have identified the genetic cause for their condition (57% diagnostic yield).\n\nConclusion: We have demonstrated that a personalised testing strategy informed by deep phenotyping increases diagnostic yield for patients with undiagnosed rare monogenic diseases. Scalability remains an ongoing priority to deliver integrated multi-omics for rare disease diagnostics.\n\nGrant references: The RDNow program acknowledges financial support from The Royal Children’s Hospital Foundation and the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declare\n\nC02.4 Development of a Pharmacogenetic Service for the NHS: The PROGRESS Programme\n\nJohn McDermott 1;2, Jessica Keen1, Videha Sharma3, Duncan Stoddard4, Rachel James1, Stuart Wright5, Algy Taylor1, Garima Dalal5, Paul Wilson6, Katherine Payne5, Munir Pirmohamed7, William Newman1;2\n\n1Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary’s Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom; 2Division of Evolution, Infection and Genomics, School of Biological Sciences, Manchester, United Kingdom; 3Centre for Health Informatics, Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Science, Manchester, United Kingdom; 4DS Analytics and Machine Learning Ltd, Hereford, United Kingdom; 5Manchester Centre for Health Economics, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research, and Primary Care, Manchester, United Kingdom; 6Centre for Primary Care and Health Services Research, Division of Population Health, Health Services Research and Primary Care, Manchester, United Kingdom; 7The University of Liverpool, Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Liverpool, United Kingdom\n\nIntroduction: The effectiveness and safety of many medicines show considerable inter-personal variation. Strategies are required to reduce this variability. One approach is to leverage genetic data to support medicines optimisation, a concept known as pharmacogenetics. Evidence for pharmacogenetic-guided prescribing exist for many medicines. Despite this, implementation is limited. The PROGRESS programme aims to develop an end-to-end solution for the return of pharmacogenetic data into clinical practice to inform prescribing.\n\nMethodology: Pharmacogenetic programmes were assessed via literature review and semi-structured interviews. Genotyping technologies were assessed for analytical performance, turn-around-time, and cost. Bespoke software was developed to handle genotype data and, via dedicated open application programming interfaces, convert this into actionable prescribing guidance. The system’s performance was appraised at stakeholder workshops before implementation in primary care settings across the North West of England.\n\nResults: Forty pharmacogenetic programmes were characterized, revealing a heterogenous implementation landscape. Several challenges unique to the NHS were identified, including the importance of developing an interoperable system able to function across institutional boundaries. All genotyping platforms had excellent analytical performance, but there was a notable variation in turnaround times and cost. The software solution (Genomic Prescribing Advisory System) can agnostically convert genotype data into meaningful prescribing guidance, acceptable to primary care stakeholders. The system is being deployed into four general practices as part of the PROGRESS trial, scaling to additional recruiting sites across England in 2024.\n\nConclusion: Implemented correctly, pharmacogenetics can potentially better use NHS resources and improve health outcomes. The PROGRESS programme provides an approach to achieve this.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC02.5 Polygenic risk scores from multi-ancestry GWAS of >450 phenotypes in the Pan-UK Biobank Project offer insights into impacts of genetic architecture, ancestry, and statistical methodology on prediction\n\nKristin Tsuo 1;2;3, Ying Wang1;2, Konrad Karczewski1;2, Rahul Gupta1;2;3, Masahiro Kanai1;2, Nikolas Baya1;2, Raymond Walters1;2, Patrick Turley1;2, Shawneequa Callier4, Duncan Palmer1;2, Jacqueline Goldstein1;2, Gopal Sarma1;2, Matthew Solomonson1;2, Nathan Cheng1;2, Wenhan Lu1;2, Sam Bryant1;2, Claire Churchhouse1;2, Caroline Cusick1;2, Daniel King1;2, Timothy Poterba1;2, John Compitello1;2, Wei Zhou1;2, Cotton Seed1;2, Mark Daly1;2;5, Hilary Finucane1;2, Benjamin Neale1;2, Elizabeth Atkinson1;2, Alicia Martin1;2\n\n1Broad Institute, Cambridge, United States; 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, United States; 3Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States; 4George Washington University, Washington, D.C., United States; 5Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki, Finland\n\nMost polygenic risk scores (PRS) developed using large-scale biobanks, like UK Biobank (UKB), are trained in primarily individuals of European (EUR) ancestry and consequently show decreased predictive power in other ancestries. To facilitate more diverse genetic studies, the Pan-UKB project conducted thousands of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across 441,331 individuals from 6 genetic ancestry groups. With this resource of multi-ancestry GWAS, we performed a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of PRS across these ancestry groups in UKB. We first conducted extensive heritability-based QC to prioritize 452 phenotypes, spanning biomarker, categorical, continuous, electronic health record, and prescription categories, and estimated their polygenicity using SBayesS. To elucidate governing principles for PRS accuracy as a function of multiple ancestries, genetic architectures, and PRS methods, we applied heuristic and Bayesian methods to construct PRS and evaluated accuracies in holdout ancestries not included in the discovery GWAS. Comparing PRS constructed from heuristic methods, we identified a few phenotypes, mostly of lower polygenicity, for which multi-ancestry GWAS improved accuracy over EUR-only analyses, including LDL (1.4-fold increase in the African ancestry group) and pulse wave reflection index (2-fold in East Asians). We found that Bayesian methods outperformed heuristic ones to substantially varying degrees across target ancestries. For some traits, like vitamin D, heuristic methods using EUR-only and multi-ancestry GWAS performed better than Bayesian methods by almost 2-fold in some non-EUR ancestries. Altogether, our study provides extensive accuracy benchmarks and guidelines for PRS for hundreds of phenotypes in UKB to advance the development of more accurate and generalizable PRS.\n\nConflict of Interest: Kristin Tsuo: None declared, Ying Wang: None declared, Konrad Karczewski Vor Biopharma, Rahul Gupta: None declared, Masahiro Kanai: None declared, Nikolas Baya: None declared, Raymond Walters: None declared, Patrick Turley: None declared, Shawneequa Callier: None declared, Duncan Palmer: None declared, Jacqueline Goldstein: None declared, Gopal Sarma: None declared, Matthew Solomonson: None declared, Nathan Cheng: None declared, Wenhan Lu: None declared, Sam Bryant: None declared, Claire Churchhouse: None declared, Caroline Cusick: None declared, Daniel King: None declared, Timothy Poterba: None declared, John Compitello: None declared, Wei Zhou: None declared, Cotton Seed: None declared, Mark Daly Maze Therapeutics, Hilary Finucane: None declared, Benjamin Neale Deep Genomics, Camp4 Therapeutics, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Biogen, Elizabeth Atkinson: None declared, Alicia Martin: None declare\n\nC02.6 Early prevention for 9 common diseases via combined genomic and metabolomic prediction\n\nJeffrey Barrett 1, Heli Julkunen1, Sini Kerminen1, Sara Lundgren1, Kirsten Schut1, Peter Wurtz1\n\n1Nightingale Health, Helsinki, Finland\n\nBackground/Objectives: Early identification of individuals at high risk of chronic disease is essential to personalised disease prevention. Cost effective interventions can be aimed at the right people before they are sick. There has been a lot of recent attention to using polygenic scores for this purpose but less attention on combining genetics with other easily measured biomarkers.\n\nMethods: We derive and validate prediction models for nine leading causes of disability-adjusted life years using both genomic and metabolic biomarker data (measured by NMR spectroscopy on blood samples) on 275,000 individuals from the UK Biobank. We replicate our findings in independent cohorts with equivalent data.\n\nResults: For each of nine diseases with the highest disability adjusted life years lost in the WHO European region we can identify individuals with substantially elevated risk. For example, the individuals in the highest risk 10% of individuals have a 10-fold risk of liver cirrhosis, 8-fold risk of diabetes, 4-fold risk of COPD and 1.8-fold risk of depression. The metabolomic and genetic data complement each other, and except colon cancer, metabolomics provides more information than genetics, even 8–10 years after the blood sample is taken, demonstrating that multi-omic prediction is valuable even for events far in the future. The same approach can also be used to find clinically useful sub-groups, such as recently diagnosed diabetics at elevated risk of subsequent kidney disease.\n\nConclusion: Population-level risk screening across multiple diseases is effective with affordable technologies, and is substantially boosted by combining genetic and metabolomic data.\n\nGrant References: NA\n\nConflict of Interest: Jeffrey Barrett Nightingale Health, Nightingale Health, Heli Julkunen Nightingale Health, Nightingale Health, Sini Kerminen Nightingale Health, Nightingale Health, Sara Lundgren Nightingale Health, Nightingale Health, Kirsten Schut Nightingale Health, Nightingale Health, Peter Wurtz Nightingale Health, Nightingale Health\n\nC03.1 The recurrent p.Ser470Phe gain-of-function variant in DCAF15 leads to Cornelia de Lange syndrome by targeting SMC3 for aberrant ubiquitination\n\nSahar Da’as 1;2, Frédéric Ebstein3;4, Constance Wells5, Aymeric MASSON6, Julien Paccaud6, Waseem Hassan1, Sixto Garcia-Minaur3, Emi Rikeros Orozco7, Elena Mansilla7, Mamen Sanchez-Gomez7, Miranda Splitt8, Ruth Richardson8, Florent Fuchs9;10;11, Yannis Duffourd6, Raissa Relator12;13, Elke Krüger3, Christophe Philippe6;14, Laurence Faivre6;15, Christel Thauvin-Robinet6;14;16, Bekim Sadikovic12;13, María Palomares-Bralo7;17, Khalid Fakhro1;2;18, Antonio Vitobello6;14\n\n1Sidra Medicine, Human Genetics Department, Doha, Qatar; 2Hamad Bin Khalifa University, College of Health and Life Sciences, Doha, Qatar; 3University Medicine Greifswald, Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Greifswald, Germany; 4Nantes Université, Institut du Thorax, Nantes, France; 5CHU Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, Department of Medical Genetics, Rare diseases and Personalized medicine, Montpellier, France; 6Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, INSERM UMR1231 GAD, Dijon, France; 7Hospital Universitario La Paz, Institute of Medical and Molecular Genetics (INGEMM), Madrid, Spain; 8Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust, Northern Genetics Service, Newcastle, United Kingdom; 9University Hospital Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Montpellier, France; 10Reproduction and child development, Inserm, CESP Center for research in Epidemiology and Population Health, Villejuif, France; 11Univ Montpellier, INSERM, (CHU Montpellier), Desbrest Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health (IDESP), Montpellier, France; 12Western University, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, London, Canada; 13London Health Sciences Centre, Verspeeten Clinical Genome Centre, London, Canada; 14FHU-TRANSLAD, CHU Dijon Bourgogne, Unité Fonctionnelle Innovation en Diagnostic Génomique des Maladies Rares, Dijon, France; 15FHU-TRANSLAD, CHU Dijon Bourgogne, Centre de Référence Maladies Rares “Anomalies du Développement et Syndromes Malformatifs”, Centre de Génétique, Dijon, France; 16FHU-TRANSLAD, CHU Dijon Bourgogne, Centre de référence maladies rares « déficiences intellectuelles de causes rares », Centre de Génétique, Dijon, France; 17ITHACA-European Reference Network, ITHACA-European Reference Network, Madrid, Spain; 18Weill Cornell Medical College, Doha, Qatar\n\nCornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous developmental disorder with multiple defects. Through whole exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated individuals with the same de novo rare variant in DCAF15 (NM_138353.3:c.1409C>T; p.Ser470Phe). Clinical features included severe developmental delay, microcephaly, congenital heart defect, and craniofacial features consistent with CdLS. In one case, termination of pregnancy was performed following a diagnosis of fetal malformation syndrome. DCAF15 (DDB1 and CUL4 Associated Factor 15) is the substrate-recognition component of the DCX complex, a cullin-4-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of target proteins, including proteins of the cohesion family. The p.Ser470Phe variant is located within a highly conserved protein fold that is predicted to recognize these target proteins. Protein analysis in primary cells from two affected individuals demonstrated DCAF15/Cullin-4 (E3 Ubiquitin Ligase) influenced ubiquitination and accumulation of SMC3, suggesting a gain-of-function mechanism and thus, providing a functional link with CdL syndrome. EpiSign analysis demonstrated DNA methylation signature consistent with CdLS. Functional validation in the zebrafish model showed accumulated smc3 and phenotypically mimicked the patients’ presentations of stunted growth, altered head width, visual and auditory impairments, and structural heart defects. As well, the crispants displayed neurological presentations including reduced cerebellar neurons and shorter spinal motor neuron axons. Remarkably, induslam treatment rescued the upregulated SMC3 in both the cellular and zebrafish models. In summary, these findings broaden the CdLS genetic heterogeneity, describe a novel DCAF15 variant, and provide insights into the disease mechanism that can serve as a potential treatment.\n\nConflict of Interest: Sahar Da’as These results reported here were generated using funding received from the Solve-RD project within the European Rare Disease Models & Mechanisms Network (RDMM-Europe).

To date, the genetic causes of only 30% of PL cases are known. Through whole genome analysis of PL cases included in the 100,000 Genomes Project, six proband with novel variants in the ERG gene were identified.\n\nVerification and co-segregation analysis of the four frameshift and two nonsynonymous variants were completed by Sanger sequencing. Plasmids containing wildtype-ERG or mutant-ERG were overexpressed in human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs), and qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence carried out. Wildtype-ERG was correctly localised in the nucleus with endogenous ERG. However, overexpression of mutant-ERG resulted in a diffuse distribution in the cytosol of HDLECs.\n\nERG is a transcription factor, and its role is well known in the blood vascular endothelium as preserving adhering cell junctions, angiogenesis and blood vessel stability. However, the role of ERG in the lymphatic system is not clearly established. Our studies showed that ERG expression colocalise with PROX1, a LEC marker, in vivo by immunostaining of ear skin from mice.\n\nIn conclusion, this study identifies novel heterozygous pathogenic variants in ERG causing dominantly inherited primary lymphoedema. There is no treatment for PL and patients need lifelong management. Understanding the underlying causes plays a huge role in the accurate diagnosis and the potential for the development of future therapies.\n\nThis work was funded by the Swiss Federal National Fund for Scientific Research (CRSII5_177191/1), the Medical Research Council (MR/P011543/1) and BHF (RG/17/7/33217).\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC03.3 Large-scale data-driven analysis to understand the contribution of rare variants to congenital heart disease\n\nEnrique Audain Martinez 1;2, Anna Wilsdon3, Gregor Dombrowsky1;2, Alejandro Sifrim4, Jeroen Breckpot4, Yasset Perez-Riverol5, Allan Daly6, Pavlos Antoniou6, Philipp Hofmann1, Anne-Karin Kahlert1, Ulrike Bauer7, Thomas Pickardt7, Sabine Klaassen8;9, Felix Berger9, Ingo Dähnert10, Sven Dittrich11, Brigitte Stiller12, Hashim Abdul-Khaliq13, Frances Bu’Lock14, Anselm Uebing1, Hans-Heiner Kramer1, Vivek Iyer6, Lars Allan Larsen15, J David Brook3, Matthew Hurles6, Marc-Phillip Hitz1;2\n\n1University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Department of Congenital Heart Disease and Pediatric Cardiology, Kiel, Germany; 2Klinikum Oldenburg, Institute for Medical Genetics, Oldenburg, Germany; 3University of Nottingham, School of Life Sciences, Nottingham, United Kingdom; 4University of Leuven, Department of Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium; 5European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), Cambridge, United Kingdom; 6Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom; 7Competence Network for Congenital Heart Defects, Berlin, Germany; 8Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and Max Delbrück Center, Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Berlin, Germany; 9Deutsches Herzzentrum der Charité, Department of Congenital Heart Disease-Pediatric Cardiology, Berlin, Germany; 10University of Leipzig, Department of Pediatric Cardiology and Congenital Heart Disease, Heart Center, Leipzig, Germany; 11University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Erlangen, Germany; 12University Heart Center Freiburg—Bad Krozingen, Department of Congenital Heart Disease and Pediatric Cardiology, Freiburg, Germany; 13Saarland University Hospital, Department of pediatric Cardiology, Homburg, Germany; 14East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre and University of Leicester, Glenfield Hospital, Congenital and Paediatric Cardiology, Glenfield, United Kingdom; 15University of Copenhagen, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nBackground/Objectives: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is a global health problem, affecting ~1–2% of live births worldwide. Despite recent advances in our understanding of underlying disease aetiology, a significant proportion of CHD cases remain unexplained. Here we have assembled and analyzed a case-control cohort to further investigate the contribution of rare genetic variants to CHD at single gene and digenic level.\n\nMethods: We have compiled an exome cohort of 57,628 samples (4747 CHD cases and 52,881 controls). Case and control data was processed and harmonized using the same alignment (BWA), calling (GATK), annotation (VEP) and quality control (Hail) pipelines. A gene-based collapsing approach was used to discover significant genome-wide associations. In addition, the contribution of digenic interactions was evaluated using the RareComb framework. The analysis was complemented with an enrichment analysis on cardiac-specific cell populations.\n\nResults: Our analysis revealed 14 genes significantly enriched at FDR 5% for rare LOF or constrained missense variants associated with CHD. Furthermore, digenic interactions contributed more to non-syndromic forms of CHD, than syndromic (P = 6.7 × 10−3, proportion Z-test). We observed distinct enrichment patterns of different cardiac-specific cell populations for syndromic (e.g., cNCCs) and non-syndromic (e.g., capillary endothelial cells) CHD.\n\nConclusions: In summary, we analysed ~57,000 exomes and complemented this with transcriptomic data at single-cell resolution. The findings have strengthened previously described genes with CHD, identified novel candidate genes, and provide a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CHD at gene and digenic level.\n\nGrand references: German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK).\n\nConflict of Interest: Enrique Audain Martinez: None declared, Anna Wilsdon: None declared, Gregor Dombrowsky: None declared, Alejandro Sifrim: None declared, Jeroen Breckpot: None declared, Yasset Perez-Riverol: None declared, Allan Daly: None declared, Pavlos Antoniou: None declared, Philipp Hofmann: None declared, Anne-Karin Kahlert: None declared, Ulrike Bauer: None declared, Thomas Pickardt: None declared, Sabine Klaassen: None declared, Felix Berger: None declared, Ingo Dähnert: None declared, Sven Dittrich: None declared, Brigitte Stiller: None declared, Hashim Abdul-Khaliq: None declared, Frances Bu’Lock: None declared, Anselm Uebing: None declared, Hans-Heiner Kramer: None declared, Vivek Iyer: None declared, Lars Allan Larsen: None declared, J David Brook: None declared, Matthew Hurles M.E.H. is a co-founder of, consultant to and holds shares in Congenica, a genetics diagnostic company., Marc-Phillip Hitz: None declared\n\nC03.4 Expanding genotype-phenotype associations in biglycan-related Meester-Loeys syndrome\n\nJosephina (Jeannette) Meester1, Anne Hebert 1, Maaike Bastiaansen1, Laura Rabaut1, Jarl Bastianen1, Nele Boeckx1, Antoine Benichou2, Jan D.

Since the initial publication of five families in 2017, we identified eleven additional MRLS families. All sixteen probands, except two, are male and had an average age at presentation of 38 years. Thirteen males and one female presented with aortic (n = 10) and/or arterial (n = 6) aneurysms/dissections, one male (11y) presented with syndromic features without cardiovascular symptoms (yet), and one female proband (42y) was identified as part of comprehensive prenatal testing. An additional 33 BGN variant-harbouring family members (M/F:6/27) were identified with cascade screening. Their phenotype ranged from no cardiovascular or connective tissue phenotype to death due to aortic dissection. Identified BGN mutations causing a stop codon insertion, frameshift, or splicing defect and partial BGN deletions were shown to result in loss-of-function by cDNA and Western Blot analysis of skin fibroblasts of seven probands, or were strongly predicted to lead to loss-of-function based on the nature of the variant. Interestingly, a male proband with a deletion encompassing exon 2–8 of BGN presented with a more severe skeletal phenotype. RNA sequencing revealed expressional activation of a downstream ATPase (ATP2B3; normally repressed in skin fibroblasts) driven by the remnant BGN promotor as a possible explanation. These observations indicate that extensive analysis at RNA, cDNA and protein level is required before concluding on the pathogenicity of BGN variants; and distinct mutational mechanisms may underlie the wide phenotypic spectrum of MRLS patients.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC03.5 Rare heterozygous variants in PTCH1 are associated with bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex\n\nGlenda Beaman 1;2, Rebecca Yarwood1, Filipa Lopes3, Raimondo Cervellione4, David Keene4, Imran Mushraq5, Paul Romitti6, Martin Lowe1, Heiko Reutter7, Adrian S.

Most affected children have no family history and it usually occurs as an isolated developmental anomaly. A small number of affected children have duplications at chromosome 22q11.\n\nThrough exome and Sanger sequencing, we identified 9 of 277 individuals with BEEC with very rare (MAF <2 × 10−5) heterozygous variants in PTCH1. This contrasts with 7 in 1199 healthy controls (p = 0.0008, odds ratio of 5.6 (95% Confidence interval 2.1–14.9)). The variants clustered at the 3’ end of the gene and have not been associated with Gorlin syndrome or other phenotypes.\n\nZebrafish embryo studies of a recurrent de novo BEEC associated variant c.4246T>C (p.Phe1416Leu) in PTCH1 demonstrated that injection of mutant and wild type human transcripts resulted in a disrupted cloaca, whereas injection of wild type or mutant sequences alone resulted in no phenotype.\n\nWe present genetic and preliminary functional evidence that putative dominant negative variants in PTCH1 result in BEEC in a subset of individuals. We predict that these variants result in disrupted hedgehog signalling, a process integral to urogenital and midline developmental processes.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC03.6 TUBB4B variants specifically impact ciliary function, causing a ciliopathic spectrum\n\nIsabelle Perrault 1, Méchaussier Sabrina1, Dodd Daniel2, Yeyati Patricia3, McPhie Fraser3, Shoemark Amelia4, Zariwala Maimoona5, Marie Legendre6, Lucas Fares Taie1, Josseline Kaplan1, Descartes Maria7, Jabs Ethylin8, Jean-François Papon9, Laurent Pasquier10, Marlène Murris11, Heymut Omran12, Amjad Horani13, Jean-Michel Rozet1, Pleasantine Mill14\n\n1Imagine, Laboratory of Genetics in ophthalmology, Paris, France; 2University of Edinburgh, The University of Edinburgh MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburg, United Kingdom; 3University of Edinburgh, Edinburg, United Kingdom; 4University of Dundee, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United Kingdom; 5University of North Carolina, North Carolina, United States; 6Sorbonne Université, Hôpital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France; 7University of Alabama at Birmingham, Genetics, Birmingham, United States; 8Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, United States; 9Bicêtre Hospital, Paris, France; 10CHU Pontchaillou, Medical Genetics Department, Rennes, France; 11Larrey Hospital, Department of Pulmonology, Transplantation, and Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Toulouse, France; 12University Children’s Hospital Münster, Department of General Pediatrics, Munster, Germany; 13Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Saint Louis, United States; 14University of Edinburgh, MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburg, United Kingdom\n\nCilia are small microtubule-based structures found on the surface of most mammalian cells, which have key sensory and sometimes motile functions. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a type of ciliopathy caused by defects in motile cilia. The genetic basis of PCD is only partially understood. Studying a cohort of 11 human patients with PCD, we find that de novo mutations in TUBB4B, a beta tubulin isotype, cause three distinct classes of ciliopathic disease: a sensorineural disease, a PCD or a syndromic PCD. In vivo studies in mice show that Tubb4b plays a specific role in cilia, building centrioles and axonemes in multiciliated cells. Examining the effects of specific TUBB4B variants in cells and in mice, we further demonstrate that distinct TUBB4B mutations differentially affect microtubule dynamics and cilia formation in a dominant negative manner. Finally, structure-function studies reveal that different TUBB4B mutations disrupt distinct tubulin interfaces. Importantly, these molecular differences correlate with disease features. We show that tubulin heterodimer-impairing TUBB4B variants underlie nonsyndromic PCD, whilst additional renal and sensorineural ciliopathic features in a syndromic PCD subtype arise from microtubule lumenal interface-impaired TUBB4B variants. These findings suggest that specific tubulin isotypes have distinct and non-redundant subcellular functions, and demonstrate that human tubulinopathies can be drivers of ciliopathic syndromes.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC04.1 Participant experiences of receiving looked for additional findings in the 100,000 Genomes Project: a mixed methods study\n\nMelissa Hill 1;2, Bethany Stafford-Smith1, Jana Gurasashvili1;2, Morgan Daniel1, Blanche Griffin1, Rashida Baptiste1, Michelle Peter1;2, Dame Lyn Chitty1;2\n\n1Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation, NHS North Thames Genomic Laboratory Hub, London, United Kingdom; 2UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Genetics and Genomic Medicine, London, United Kingdom\n\nBackground/Objectives: Participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project were able to consent to receive looked for additional findings (AFs) relating to genes associated with susceptibility to cancer and heart disease. We aimed to evaluate the experiences of participants who chose to receive AFs to inform clinical practice.\n\nMethods: Our mixed-methods study, conducted at 18 sites across England, comprised a cross-sectional survey and in-depth interviews with participants who received a positive AF (PAF) or a no additional findings (NAF) result.\n\nResults: To date 131 surveys have been returned and 34 interviews with participants with a PAF and 28 interviews with participants who received an NAF are complete. Survey findings indicate that most participants felt their PAF result was useful and agreed their result would influence their health management in the future (82%). The majority (90%) reported they had shared the result with family members. Interviews highlight that some patients with a PAF were initially anxious about their results and worried about informing their children and wider family, however, with time they could see benefits from receiving the AF result. For interview participants with an NAF result, most were positive about the experience, but we also found many had misinterpreted the result.\n\nConclusion: Analysis is ongoing and the overall results of this evaluation will be important in determining whether and how additional findings should be offered in the English NHS Genomic Medicine Service and the clinical implementation of genome sequencing more widely.\n\nGrant reference: NHS England and the GOSH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC04.2 Exploring uncertainties regarding unsolicited findings in genetic testing\n\nVyne van der Schoot 1, Eline van der Meer2, Marij Hillen3, Helger Yntema4, Han Brunner4, Anke Oerlemans2\n\n1Erasmus MC, Clinical genetics, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 2Radboud University Medical Center, IQ Healthcare, Radboud Institute for Health Sciences, Nijmegen, Netherlands; 3Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Department of Medical Psychology, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 4Radboud University Medical Center, Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen, Netherlands\n\nBackground/Objectives: Non-normative uncertainty (uncertainty about empirical facts) and normative uncertainty (uncertainty about moral values or beliefs) regarding ‘unsolicited findings’ (UFs) might play an important role in clinical genetics. Identifying normative uncertainty is of special interest since it might guide towards novel directions for counseling practice. This study aims to gain insight into the role of non-normative and normative uncertainty regarding UFs, as expressed by counselees and counselors.\n\nMethods: We performed a secondary qualitative analysis of 40 interviews with counselees and counselors who had been confronted with UFs. Following a deductive approach, we used an existing theoretical framework of uncertainty, in which we additionally incorporated normative uncertainty.\n\nResults: Major issues of non-normative uncertainty were practical and personal for counselees, whilst counselors’ uncertainty pertained mainly to scientific issues. Normative uncertainty was a major theme throughout the interviews. We encountered the moral conflicts of autonomy vs. beneficence and non-maleficence and of autonomy vs. truthfulness.\n\nConclusion: Non-normative uncertainty regarding UFs highlights the need to gain more insight in their penetrance and clinical utility. Importantly, even if uncertainty about empirical facts regarding UFs were to be resolved, the identified moral conflicts should be addressed when counseling UFs. Exploring counselees’ non-normative uncertainties and normative conflicts seems a prerequisite to optimize genetic counseling. This study suggests an important role for moral conflicts as a source of feelings of uncertainty in clinical genetics beyond the scope of UFs.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC04.3 Multidisciplinary healthcare professionals’ views on a psychiatric genetic counselling service within the northwest of England\n\nHanna Quigley 1;2, ramona moldovan1;2\n\n1Manchester university NHS foundation trust, Genomic medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom; 2University of Manchester, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nBackground: Psychiatric Genetic Counselling (PGC) is not a service currently offered in England despite psychiatric conditions being very prevalent and highly heritable. Psychiatric conditions are complex conditions, due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Despite genetic testing not currently being available to confirm psychiatric diagnoses, genetic counselling has been consistently shown to be valuable for both patients and family members. This study explores healthcare professionals’ views on setting up a PGC service within the northwest of England.\n\nMethods: Purposive sampling was used to select participants with relevant background and/or experience with patients diagnosed with psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions. The 8 participants included a clinical psychologist, two geneticists, and five genetic counsellors. All participants were employed by NHS trusts in the northwest of England. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis.\n\nResults: Data analysis indicated four themes: benefits of PGC; challenges for PGC; the clinical and cultural context of PGC; and opportunities for a PGC service. Thirteen subthemes were identified, and included increased knowledge, therapeutic gains, therapeutic barriers, expectation management, resources, appropriate collaboration, society and mental health, clinician training, structural challenges, clinical models, service formats, scope of practice and research advancements.\n\nConclusion: Participants agreed that PGC could be of great benefit to patients and families. Participants detailed the main opportunities in setting up a PGC service, as well as the main barriers to consider, including cultural context.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC04.4 The decision-making of at-risk marriages after pre-marital screening for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease in alqatif, saudi arabia - virtual\n\nSara Alkaff 1, mohammed aldarwish2, saud takroni3, Shirin Al Sharfa4, Moeen Al-Sayed3\n\n1King Saud Medical City, Genetic and metabolic, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 2Alqatif Central Hospital, Alqatif, Saudi Arabia; 3King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; 4Alqatif Central Hospital,, Alqatif, Saudi Arabia\n\nBackground/Objectives: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia major in the Middle East. Because of this, the Saudi government established the Saudi Premarital Screening and Genetic Counseling (PMSGC). In Saudi Arabia there’s decreased in the number of at-risk marriages, but in some areas, the rate remains as high as 80%. Here, we aimed to identify the factors that affect couples at risk of proceeding with their marriage knowing the test results.\n\nMethods: Descriptive, cross-sectional study Al-Qatif Central Hospital, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. A total of 124 Saudi couples underwent a premarital screening from 2004 (when the pre-marital screening became mandatory) to 2019 and were deemed incompatible. Seventy-three completed a self-administered questionnaire in the outpatient paediatric hemoglobinopathies clinic at the Al-Qatif Central Hospital, and 51 couples were telephonically interviewed.\n\nResults: Of the 124 at-risk Saudi couples, 113 (91%) received an “incompatible” certificate, and 31 (25%) were aware of their medical status before the screening. Factors influencing at-risk couples to proceed with marriage included a lack of awareness of the severity of the disease (33%), familial commitment or pressure (20%), a pre-existing love story (12%), the wedding had already been arranged and was non-cancellable (7%), religious considerations (7%), and learning of methods of having a healthy child (7%).\n\nConclusion: These findings suggest the need to conduct an effective educational program and optional screening at high schools, educating the community using social media. Qualified genetic counsellors should be assigned to all premarital screening centres.\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared\n\nC04.5 Preferences of people with inherited genetic conditions and family members in Portugal toward informing at-risk relatives of genetic risk\n\nMara Pinto1, João Parente Freixo2, Filipa Júlio3, Tamara Hussong Milagre4;5, Luís Sousa6, Liliana Sousa1, Álvaro Mendes 2;7\n\n1CINTESIS@RISE, Universidade de Aveiro, Department of Education and Psychology, Aveiro, Portugal; 2IBMC – Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, i3S – Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, Universidade do Porto, CGPP – Centre for Predictive and Preventive Genetics,, Porto, Portugal; 3Associação Portuguesa dos Doentes de Huntington, Lisboa, Portugal; 4Evita – Associação de Apoio a Portadores de Alterações nos Genes Relacionados com Cancro Hereditário, Lisboa, Portugal; 5ePAG ERN GENTURIS - European Patient Advocacy Group, European Reference Network for all Patients with one of the Rare Genetic Tumour Risk Syndromes, Nijmegen, Netherlands; 6APAHE – Associação Portuguesa de Ataxias Hereditárias, Vila Franca de Xira, Portugal; 7IBMC – Institute for Molecular and Cell Biology, i3S – Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, Universidade do Porto, UniGENe, Porto, Portugal\n\nPatients commonly shoulder the dissemination of information on genetic risk among relatives, yet genetic counselling and testing of at-risk relatives is under-utilised. This study aimed at exploring the preferences of persons with inherited genetic conditions and family members about informing relatives of genetic risk.\n\nSeventeen patients’ organisations in Portugal advertised online surveys between November 2022 and January 2023. Data were analysed through descriptive and comparative statistics.\n\nAfter exclusions, 293 participants were considered: mean age 45.5 (range: 18–77, SD 11.54), 74.7% female, 72% with children, 59% with higher education. Participants (45.4% symptomatic, 33.2% family members, 21.4% pre-symptomatic carriers) were mainly from families with Transthyretin amyloidosis (15%) Huntington disease (14%), cystic fibrosis (13%), and hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes (11%). Most participants (39%) thought that all relatives should be informed, 32% believed that direct relatives should be contacted first and 26% that only direct relatives should be informed. Most participants (45%) also thought that probands should make the first contact and the health professional the following, while 28% thought the proband should choose whether health professionals would be involved in informing relatives. A large majority (84%) believed that health professionals should actively offer support to inform relatives, and that health professionals should inform relatives directly when patients are unable or unwilling to do it (for un/treatable conditions) (83.6%).\n\nResults highlight preferences toward involvement of patients and health professionals in informing relatives, including direct contact of health professionals.

Research has considered the impact of receiving a diagnostic result, but rarely focused on the impact of receiving a no primary finding (NPF) result. This study aimed to investigate the experience of parents of children with rare undiagnosed conditions following an NPF result from GS.\n\nMethods: Parents (n = 9) whose child had an NPF result were recruited to semi-structured telephone interviews through a patient organisation. Interviews explored motivations for testing and experience of receiving results. They were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Grounded Theory.\n\nResults: Analysis suggested a central theory: ‘the disequilibrium of hope’ reflecting the peaks and troughs parents experience in their GS journey. Two sequential themes were identified: (1) ‘Hoping to Solve the Unsolved Puzzle’ comprising the subthemes ‘Hoping for Diagnosis’ and ‘Hopeful, yet Fearful’; and (2) ‘Hope, Lost and Found’ including the subthemes ‘Hopes Dashed’, ‘Isolation Revisited’ and ‘Hope out of Darkness’. Hope was identified as in important coping mechanism for parents.\n\nConclusion: Our research highlights the dynamic, complex, and important role hope plays in the parent journey. Health professionals must tread a delicate path to both nurture hope to maintain healthy coping and manage expectations. For parents receiving an NPF, ways of promoting hope e.g., discussing healthcare options, practical support, and psychological wellbeing, is valuable. Further research should consider how to support parents after an NPF result.\n\nGrant Reference: Celine Lewis: NIHR Advanced Fellowship Grant (NIHR300099)\n\nConflict of Interest: Jana Gurasashvili Full time, Sergio Silverio Full time, Melissa Hill Full time, Michelle Peter Full time, Bethany Stafford-Smith Full time, Celine Lewis Full time\n\nC05.1 DAAM2 mutations cause androgen insensitivity syndrome by interfering with transcriptional droplet formation at androgen receptors\n\nJulian Knerr1, Ralf Werner2;3, Carsten Schwan1, Hong Wang4, Peter Gebhardt4, Helga Grötsch2;5, Almuth Caliebe6, Malte Spielmann6, Paul-Martin Holterhus7, Robert Grosse1;4, Nadine Hornig 6\n\n1Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; 2Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; 3Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; 4Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; 5Veraxa Biotech GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany; 6Institute of Human Genetics, Universitätsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; 7Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany\n\nBackground/Objectives: Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a 46,XY difference of sex development classically caused by mutations in the X-chromosomal androgen receptor (AR) gene. Nevertheless, in over 50% of individuals with clinical AIS no AR coding gene mutation can be detected. We previously established an assay that measures androgen dependent AR activity in genital skin fibroblasts (GSFs). Using this "
