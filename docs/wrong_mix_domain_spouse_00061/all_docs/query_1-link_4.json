        "text": "Like most of countless romantic comedy films out there, “Anyone but You” will not surprise you that much if you are your average seasoned moviegoer like me. Right from its conventional Meet Cute moment, the movie is thoroughly predictable no … Continue reading →\n\n“What’s Love Got to Do with It”, which is incidentally not associated with the 1993 Tina Turner biopic, is as predictable as your typical romantic comedy. Right from when its two lead characters appear together at the beginning of the … Continue reading →\n\n“Polite Society” is a little but feisty genre exercise to cherish for good reasons. As an energetic mix between martial arts action movie and coming-of-age comedy, it kicks and punches all the way for giving us a bunch of outrageously … Continue reading →\n\n“Father of the Bride”, the third film based on the 1949 novel of the same name by Edward Streeter, is a likable remake which deserves its own little place besides the 1950 version and the 1991 version.

Usually held at those big halls, weddings in South Korea are pretty much same in terms of routines and procedures, and I must confess that … Continue reading →\n\nAs an Asian audience, I knowingly smiled as watching the heroine of “The Farewell” coming inside her dear grandmother’s residence full of their family members. When I was young, I and my family routinely visited the house of my mother’s … Continue reading →\n\nThe heroine of “Ready or Not” faces a lot more risks and troubles than she ever imagined, and that is the main source of naughty pleasure in this morbid black comedy film. Poor girl, she only wants to present herself … Continue reading →\n\n“Plus One” did not surprise me much, but it did not bore me at least. Yes, this is another typical romantic comedy film about two different young people who gradually come to realize that they are really in love with … Continue reading →"
