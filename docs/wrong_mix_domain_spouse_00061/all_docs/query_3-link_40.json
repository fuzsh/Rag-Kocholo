Both our work environments and our social lives have been greatly affected, and we have experienced an unprecedented feeling of social isolation and restraint, as well as anxiety for the future of ourselves and the whole community.\n\nFortunately, we were blessed by the might of the web, which has helped us in the face of so many difficulties. We have learned how to explore and communicate in a virtual world—slang such as call and link and tele-this or tele-that has penetrated our language and become our leitmotiv to survive isolation and loneliness. This could not in any way compensate for the collapse of personal interactions, but it removed what was initially perceived as an insurmountable wall between us and the others, helping us to realize we were not alone after all. In looking back at the last two years, we might conclude that the Sars-Cov2 pandemic changed our lifestyle and made our days less frantic and neurotic. We suddenly found ourselves with plenty of time for thinking, putting ideas together, and brainstorming in the search for new scientific avenues.\n\nIn reviewing how the scientific literature embraced thousands of solid or naïve reports on the evil virus, I have the impression that we never stopped conducting science. Looking at how our journal faired during the pandemic, it is clear that our authors faced the challenges presented to them head on and broadened their focus on what a healthy lifestyle means. We all became, more than ever, aware of the importance of nutrition as a preventive or curative indispensable strategy. As a result, nutrition research is stronger than before and represents a unique arena to welcome translational collaborations and efforts to fight COVID-19. More importantly, nutrition research has become a flagship of a revitalized interest in life and the environment.\n\nI wish you all a healthy and fruitful 2022!\n\nThe whole team in “Pediatric Nutrition” wishes all co-workers and authors a very happy 2022 and we thank you for your devotion and interest.\n\nOn behalf of the Editorial Office of Nutrients we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Nutrients’ authors, readers, Editorial Board members, and reviewers, thanking them for their kind and continued participation in the journal in 2021.\n\nThis year, we have published many relevant findings in the field of human nutrition. For example, several important papers have highlighted the role of vitamin D in reducing the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19, or other factors such as vitamin K or zinc, and how the pandemic has changed the dietary habits and physical activity due to lockdowns. Nutrients has also published studies demonstrating the positive health effects of nuts and coffee and has reviewed the benefits of fasting and its application. We have also seen research concerning meta-analysis, showing that animal protein tends to be more beneficial for lean mass than plant protein, a work suggesting that a ketogenic low-carbohydrate high-fat diet induces a deleterious blood lipid profile, and an innovative study using a metagenomics and metabolomics approach to show how western and Mediterranean diets differently affect gut microbiota metabolism. Finally, some studies have also shed more light on controversial topics such as the effects of the consumption of potatoes and saturated fats on health.\n\nIn 2021, the impact factor of Nutrients has increased to 5.719 and thanks to all the excellent papers we have published in 2021, we expect to further increase the impact of Nutrients in 2022.\n\nWe wish you a very happy new year, and we welcome submissions of even more excellent articles in 2022.\n\nWishing you health and happiness in the New Year ahead.\n\nSports nutrition is a rapidly expanding area of scientific investigation. The interaction of exercise and nutrition is compelling and complex. Advances in measurement technologies have allowed hundreds of metabolites, proteins, lipids, and genes to be measured simultaneously. This approach has improved the capacity to provide accurate and practical guidelines for athletes. The “Sports Nutrition” Section of the journal Nutrients is devoted to advancing scientific understanding, and I encourage you to send us your best papers in 2022.\n\nProf. Dr. Yan Chen\n\nEditorial Board Member in Nutrients\n\nWish for Nutrients to be nutritious and important to all fields of biological research.\n\nDear readers,\n\nCongratulations to all those who contributed to this year’s “Nutrition and Metabolism” Section and to our supportive readers and editorial staff. We were pleased to receive very informative manuscripts on diverse topics. The Section published about 400 manuscripts representing the scientific activities of researchers and scholars from the Americas, Asia, and Europe. The scope of the science is broad reflecting the many aspects of nutrition and metabolism research being conducted in well-established research centers.\n\nWe look forward to your continued support by submitting reviews, original research, and/or editorials on topics that are of greatest importance to nutrition and metabolism. In these challenging times of the pandemic, scientists are to be commended for their resilience and commitment to their work. As we learn to navigate the present health challenge, we anticipate additional submissions on new aspects of the role of the immune system in metabolism and new strategies to enhance immunity through nutrition. We encourage you to continue to submit your research findings to this section next year. We urge you to encourage your fellows and students to publish their thesis work and to use this forum as a key resource of innovative research in nutrition and metabolism.\n\nWe extend to our readership, authors, and very able editorial staff best wishes for a productive 2022 and for better control of the healthcare challenges we confront worldwide.\n\nDear readers,\n\nOn behalf of the “Nutrition Epidemiology” Section of our journal Nutrients, we wish all authors and readers a happy Christmas time and a scientifically productive 2022, with our best wishes for your personal and familial life.\n\nDear readers and authors,\n\nThe last two years have been very challenging to all of us. People all over the world lost loved ones and many suffered economic hardship. Even though the pandemic is not over, it is thanks to the outstandingly fast development of COVID-19 vaccines that many of us will be able to meet friends and family in this holiday season and hopefully lead a more normal life in 2022. Therefore, I would like to take the opportunity to send a word of gratitude to our fellow scientists who worked hard to develop the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAdditionally, I would also like to take the opportunity to thank you, the readers and the authors, for following Nutrients and for publishing more than 400 excellent original manuscripts and review articles this year in the “Clinical Nutrition” Section. Indeed, if I look at the many submissions and manuscripts published in this Section, but also the journal in general throughout the past year, I have the impression we never stopped engaging with science, and that nutrition research is an ever-developing discipline being one of the keys to a healthy life.\n\nHappy Holidays to everyone and a healthy and fruitful 2022!\n\nAs we near the end of another challenging year, a Season’s Greeting full of enthusiasm for the progress we have made in the world of nutrition research and optimism for our future progress is the order of the day. It is easy for me to be enthusiastic about progress. I was lucky to stumble on a research path that has made particularly impressive progress during the last two decades—the metabolic effects of added sugar consumption. I assess this progress starting in 2001 with our NIH summary statement for our first R01 proposal to conduct a well-controlled dietary intervention study on the metabolic effects of fructose and glucose. A reviewer panned our hypothesis that fructose consumption increased risk factors for CVD, stating that it had already been disproven 30 years ago when it was proposed by John Yudkin (eventually, and luckily, we got funded anyway). Fast forward to 2015, reviewers of our new proposals were questioning the need for any more dietary intervention studies on added sugar. Specifically, one reviewer wrote that everyone, except those associated with the sugar industries, knows that the consumption of sugar is bad for health. While the comment is arguable, specifically concerning the “everyone knows” part, it certainly suggests a lot of results were generated and a lot of learning occurred in only 13 years! We can also reasonably claim that the change in the 2015 US Dietary Guideline for the upper limit of added sugar consumption is indicative of outstanding progress; down from 25% of daily energy to 10% of daily energy. However, the U.S. per capita consumption of added sugar (sucrose plus HFCS) has only decreased 17% since 2002 (from 350 to 292 Kcal/day), therefore the average level of added sugar consumption in the U.S. is still closer to 15% of daily energy than 10%. Furthermore, the decrease consisted of solely high fructose corn syrup (HFCS); sucrose intake has increased by 16 kcal/day since 2002. (Nutrition educators, please broadcast the finding of our latest publication: Liver fat, insulin resistance, circulating lipids/lipoproteins, and uric acid are significantly increased by consumption of sucrose, and the increases are comparable to those caused by consumption of HFCS.)\n\nClearly, we need to keep adding to the evidence base that demonstrates that the refined Western diet is a mediator of chronic disease, ensure that the evidence is translated to dietary advice and education for the public, and develop and test new strategies that will promote dietary change. Does my enthusiasm for our recent progress on the topic of added sugar translate to optimism that we can make equally impressive progress on the goals stated above? I am not sure. I worry that the challenge of obtaining funding to conduct a clinical dietary intervention study, the gold standard of nutrition research, has sky-rocketed alarmingly during the last decade. The researcher must not only meet the NIH standards for being significant and innovative (a challenge in itself), but many reviewers are judging the study design (approach) based on the same standards set for evidence-based medicine. These evidence-based medicine standards for sample size, duration, direct disease outcomes, blinding, control of confounding variables, and compliance monitoring are achievable for a Phase III drug study, for practical, ethical, and methodological reasons, they are not realistic standards for clinical dietary intervention studies.\n\nFurthermore, I think summary statements from my recent unfunded NIH proposals illustrate additional challenges that face nutrition researchers who are seeking funding for clinical dietary intervention studies. For example, in the same summary statement, two reviewers offered completely non-reconcilable critiques of my plan to provide the human subjects with 6 weeks of standardized meals and beverages prepared in our metabolic kitchen. The first reviewer described the dietary protocol as a weakness as it “...is so tightly controlled it is unclear how generalizable these findings will be”; the second reviewer described the dietary protocol as a weakness as the subjects “are not brought into a monitored or controlled setting” for meal consumption, thus may cheat.\n\nI was also disconcerted when a reviewer of my most recent unfunded proposal stated that it was unclear how elucidating the mechanism between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain would result in public health policy to reduce the availability of SSB. It is the objective of nearly all dietary intervention studies to generate results that will influence public health policy. While many of us researchers put substantial effort into trying to ensure our published results have an impact, the role of translating research evidence into public health policy belongs to others specifically trained for this. Luckily, more and more of our young people are embracing this role, and from 1992 to 2016 the number of post-graduate degrees conferred in public health has more than tripled.\n\nOne of the hurdles that the current and future public health advocates have to deal with in their efforts to impact dietary policy is gaps in the evidence base. Filling these gaps is our role, and it takes three types of studies to do this: 1. The observational studies that can show associations between dietary components and health or disease; 2. The basic animal research that can demonstrate causal mechanism between dietary components and health or disease; and 3. Clinical dietary intervention studies to test the relevance of the mechanisms in humans using surrogate markers of health and disease. With all three, we will arm the public health advocates with the best possible evidence base. Therefore, we have to work to ensure that unrealistic standards do not impede the conduct of clinical dietary intervention studies. Dietary intervention studies will never test CVD or diabetes as outcomes, only their surrogates. They will never have sample sizes or durations to rival Phase III drug studies. If they use a free-living/free-choice dietary protocol, the results are subject to confounding by other dietary variables. If they use the standardized dietary protocol in which subjects are confined to consuming only the study diet, mis-compliance is still possible and the results may not be generalizable to real-world diets. While it may be my fantasy, it is not possible, even with unlimited funding, to conduct a dietary intervention study that will not have limitations and that will single-handedly impact dietary policy and consumer behavior. This must not become an excuse not to conduct them. Let us work together to ensure that it does not!\n\nHappy Holidays to everyone!\n\nProf. Dr. Guansheng Ma\n\nEditorial Board Member in Nutrients\n\nAs the pandemic continues to rage around the world in 2021, nutrition research is still being conducted, despite the impact. To fight against COVID-19, the link between vitamin D, zinc, polyphenols, other nutrients and resistance to infection and immune function has received particular attention. The results of these studies have shown that adequate and appropriate intake of nutrition is essential for strengthening immunity and preventing the infection of COVID-19. Investigations have concluded that quarantine does changes dietary behavior and physical activity, eventually impacting the health of the population. Nutrition and healthy aging, food allergies, mechanisms and effects of dietary factors on chronic diseases are the focus of research; moreover, the food environment, food systems, low carbon and sustainability are the focus of researchers.\n\nIn the coming year, 2022, as researchers, our scientific research in nutrition and health will never stop. We will continue to make new advances in our own research fields in order to benefit both mankind and nature.\n\nHappy Holidays! I wish you all a healthy and fruitful 2022!\n\nCongratulations to the journals Cancers, Diversity, Future Internet, Nutrients, Polymers, Pharmaceutics, Remote Sensing, Sustainability, Symmetry, Toxins and Water for publishing their 10th volume in 2018!\n\nWe would like to send warm wishes from the Editors-in-Chief of these journals and look to the future. Acknowledgement of our past achievements provides the strongest stimulus for future endeavor.\n\nTo date, the journal Cancers has published more than 1000 papers and will receive its first impact factor in June. This milestone could not be achieved without our readers, authors, peer reviewers, editors, and all the people working for the journal who, for years, have contributed their tremendous efforts.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Samuel Mok\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Cancers\n\nTen years is a long time but a short period for a new journal. When we started Diversity 10 years ago, we had hoped that a journal with such a broad coverage of topics would attract potential authors and good contributions. We are very satisfied that our vision became reality.\n\nToday, Diversity is home to interesting studies on different aspects of diversity mainly in biology, ranging from systematics, phylogeny and evolution, to ecology, biodiversity and conservation issues. I am confident that the next 10 years will witness the further growth of Diversity both in quality and quantity.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Michael Wink\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Diversity\n\nTen years have passed from the foundation of the “Future Internet” MDPI journal. We have witnessed the positive evolution of our journal, with ever-increasing interest from potential authors. The increasing fundamental eco-systemic importance of the journal’s subjects has also had positive effects. Therefore, the journal is currently evolving to cope with the increasing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary views.\n\nPast achievements and future prospects give us reason to celebrate ten years since the journal’s foundation. We will also set up a commemorative Special Issue.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Dino Giuli\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Future Internet\n\nIt is with great pride that Nutrients enters its 10th year of publication. Through the hard work and dedication of its Editorial Board, journal staff, and individuals who have unselfishly given their time to peer-review manuscripts, the journal has grown to become a leading publisher of nutrition research. During this 10th Anniversary year of Nutrients, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all who have contributed to the journal during its first decade.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Jonathan Buckley\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Nutrients\n\nI am pleased and honored to celebrate the first decade of Pharmaceutics, as the founding Editor-in-Chief. This is also an opportunity for me to thank our authors, readers, reviewers, and editorial board members for their continuous support. We will receive our first impact factor in June 2018, in recognition of the great efforts made in the past ten years. We shall strive to improve the journal in the next ten years.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Yvonnne Perrie\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Pharmaceutics\n\nSince its foundation in 2009, Polymers has evolved into an internationally renowned and successful Open Access journal. The core concept, namely that Open Access publishing can stand for high-quality publications, is working well. On a daily basis, ever since the journal’s foundation, the editorial team and the editorial board dedicate themselves to ensuring a high-quality rigorous peer-review process: only 30 to 50% of the submissions will be published in Polymers. This strategy been complemented by, among other features, the increasing impact factor of Polymers, the most recent one being 3.364. On the occasion of Polymers’ 10th anniversary, we would like to thank all authors who have contributed to the success of the journal by submitting their high-quality research papers. We look forward to your continuous support and the continued growth of the journal in the next decade.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Alexander Böker\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Polymers\n\nMDPI’s Open Access journal Remote Sensing is now one of the top international scientific journal 's in remote sensing science.

This anniversary demonstrates the growing interest in and recognition of the importance of sustainability. The journal has been able to showcase the many advances made over the last decade in the thinking, methods and applications surrounding sustainability. Recently, the content of the journal has reflected the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was adopted by the United Nations in September 2015. Sustainability has had a notable impact and expects to have an even greater impact over its next decade through publishing research on new advances in sustainability and fostering critical discussion.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Marc A. Rosen\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Sustainability\n\nOur journal Symmetry celebrates its 10th anniversary in 2018. During the last 10 years, the journal has become one of the leading journals among all multi-science journals. This shows the fundamental role played by the symmetries of nature in natural science. This also reflects the huge number of researchers whose work relates to symmetry. We hope to achieve even better results in the coming years.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Sergei D. Odintsov\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Symmetry\n\nIt is my honor as Editor-in-Chief of Toxins to inaugurate the 10th anniversary of the journal’s inception. From the founding EIC, Professor Florian Lang and EIC Vernon Tesh and the many Section EICs and Editorial Board Members, the combined leadership of this effort to provide an outstanding vehicle for the dissemination of the results of high-quality scientific investigations and in-depth, insightful comprehensive reviews has resulted in the flagship journal of toxinology as we know it today. The publication metrics associated with Toxins support this claim by virtue of our increase in manuscript submissions and publications and annual citation rate of articles published in Toxins. Importantly, the impact factor for Toxins remains strong and representative of the significance of the science published in Toxins. As we progress in this anniversary year, we will celebrate the 10th anniversary with a continuation of our acclaimed travel award program for Post-Doctoral Fellows in the field of Toxinology as well as our soon to be announced “Toxins' 10th Anniversary Top Cited Researcher Award” program.\n\nThus, 2018 will be an exciting year, celebrating the 10th anniversary of Toxins, but also a year of looking forward for the best practices by which the journal can serve the toxinology community. With that in mind, please join us in celebrating the journal by submitting your work to Toxins and as always I welcome your suggestions for the improvement of “our” journal.\n\n— Prof. Dr. Jay W. Fox\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Toxins\n\nThank you to all the dedicated researchers, reviewers and editors who have made Water a success.
