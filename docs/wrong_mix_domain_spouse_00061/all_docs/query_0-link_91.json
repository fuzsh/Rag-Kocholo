        "text": "Earlier this year, during his ill-fated campaign to become mayor of London, Zac Goldsmith was interviewed at an event celebrating India’s Bollywood cinema. With his silver-grey hair and silver-grey eyes, his lofty height and patrician diffidence, he looked every inch like a man aching to be sitting at his favourite Mayfair eatery, but instead finding himself having to savour the uncertain offerings of some high street tandoori takeaway.\n\nHe declared himself a “Bollywood fan”, saying that he lapped up anything with a Bollywood theme. The interviewer then asked him about his favourite Bollywood films and actors. Suddenly speechless, the 41-year-old old Etonian’s baffled expression suggested he’d just been asked to describe Euclid’s theorem – in Greek.\n\n“No, I’m not going to give you one,” he finally said. “I can’t think of a favourite.”\n\nIt wasn’t exactly a deciding moment in the election, but it was the most graphic of a series of encounters that left the impression that Goldsmith was not born to get down with the people. In the event, the Back Zac ticket cracked.\n\nAfter a campaign targeting his Labour opponent’s Muslim background and connections so stubbornly that it was accused of racism, and even Goldsmith’s sister, Jemima, said she was saddened by its tone, Sadiq Khan walked away with the mayoralty and Goldsmith withdrew to his Richmond Park constituency.\n\nBut although he is a long way from being a natural in the spotlight, Goldsmith was never going to disappear into the constituency rigmarole of, for example, saving a cashpoint in Barnes from being closed. There’s too much history and celebrity in his family, too much ease and speed in his progress to settle for the sleepy backwaters of life in a safe Tory seat.\n\nAnd lo, last week, Goldsmith announced that he was resigning his seat, thus triggering a byelection, after the government said that it was going ahead with the plan to build a third runway at Heathrow. He will stand as an independent.\n\nGoldsmith promised last year in his campaign to hold on to the seat that he first won in 2010 that he would resign if the government backed the Heathrow expansion scheme. So he is as good as his word. But not all observers are impressed. Some noted that the government has a very small majority, Theresa May is enduring a difficult period after the Brexit vote and the last thing she or the Tory party need is a byelection.\n\nThey conclude that the move is less about principle than privilege. Writing in the Daily Mail, the political columnist Peter Oborne suggested that Goldsmith represented a familiar type from London’s centres of inherited wealth, of “none too bright” men who lead “agreeable but empty lives”. “To put it brutally,” wrote Oborne, “he’s placed his own vanity above loyalty to his colleagues.”\n\nWhether this is true, Goldsmith is the owner of a demeanour that doesn’t exactly express collegiate solidarity. Or as Oborne puts it, in characteristically blunt style, he “gives the impression he’s bestowing a favour on his fellow MPs by joining them in the Commons”.\n\nOf course, if you’re the beneficiary of a £300m Swiss trust fund, courtesy of a father, James Goldsmith, who built a ruthless reputation and a billion-pound fortune from corporate raiding, if you’re blessed with dashing good looks and you’re not much intimidated, as most MPs are, by the thought of losing your job, then you’re probably not going to win any House of Commons popularity contests.\n\nA common complaint about modern MPs is that they have never had any job outside politics. They leave university, become political researchers, special advisers and, next thing, they’re an MP deciding how the country should be run. But Goldsmith’s story makes that standard model of progress look like a tale of epic struggle and sacrifice out in the big bad world.\n\nHe was kicked out of Eton for possession of cannabis that, he insists, was not his. He did a crammer and then travelled around the world, staying in Ladakh in the Himalayas for six months, an experience that helped inspire his ecological thinking. In 1997, he got a job as reviews editor at the Ecologist magazine, which just happened to be edited, owned and published by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith. A year later, aged 23, he became its unpaid editor-in-chief. He then set about turning it into a less academic magazine, upping the circulation in the process.\n\nBy 25, he was married with a child. His first wife was Sheherazade Bentley, herself the daughter of the renowned asset-stripper John Bentley and the Colombian actress and socialite Viviane Ventura. These were the years when Goldsmith developed an alternative organic image, in a multimillionaire kind of way.\n\nThe Tory party, itself in the middle of an image overhaul, took note and made him deputy chair of its quality of life policy group, which produced a whole mass of greenish recommendations that David Cameron bought into when in opposition and then largely junked in power.\n\nBy 2010, Goldsmith had been handed the safe seat of Richmond Park, near to where he grew up. His marriage was over, having produced three children, and he’d taken up with Alice Rothschild, who – deep breath – is the daughter of a Guinness and a Rothschild, and the sister of Goldsmith’s brother’s wife, Kate, who later took off with a rapper.\n\nAll very aristocratic. And, let’s face it, not your typical tale of Westminster bed-hopping. That’s the thing about Goldsmith. For all his protestations of normality or, rather, humility, he mixes and marries in an exclusive social circle of the ultra-wealthy.\n\nAnd with that kind of wealth and influence, team-playing is a discipline for the drones. The political columnist Matthew Parris called Goldsmith a “gold-plated loose cannon” and now, as of last week, the cannonball has been fired.\n\nBut where, exactly, is it heading? Towards the Tory party? Heathrow? Goldsmith’s career? All are possible, indeed probable, destinations. With an opposition in terminal disarray, only an act of sabotage or an early Brexit can threaten the government’s comfortable lead in the polls. Fortunately for the Labour party, the Tories have their own self-destructive streak.\n\nIn a sense, the pickle the country and the political class now finds itself in started with the Goldsmith’s family’s taste for rogue individualism. It was Zac’s father, the billionaire, Tory supporting James Goldsmith, who in 1994 set up the Referendum party to campaign to get Britain out of the EU. The elder Goldsmith was from a Franco-German background and lived much of the time on the continent, but he was passionately against his fellow Britons enjoying the same freedom of movement.\n\nAlthough the Referendum party died along with James Goldsmith in 1997, it gave momentum to the surviving anti-European party, Ukip. And slowly Ukip made enough inroads into Tory support that Cameron was panicked into calling a referendum. Zac has called his father “the man who saved Britain”.\n\nThe rest is history, or a shaky future, but one small footnote of the resulting replacement of Cameron by May is the green light for Heathrow expansion.\n\nThe arguments for and against that decision could fill a library, but Goldsmith clearly sees himself as the green hero of the hour. Just as the father, once a keen Tory supporter, turned his back on the party to fund an anti-European party, so has the son abandoned the Conservatives to stand as an independent. Polls suggest that he’s the favourite to win.\n\n“If I see something that is wrong,” Goldsmith told one interviewer during the mayoral campaign, “I just want to do something about it and change it. It was probably drilled into me as a child, although I don’t remember it being drilled into me as a child.”\n\nIt could be said that both Goldsmith senior and junior made principled stands, but equally they can be seen as acts of devil-may-care arrogance that comes with huge wealth. If so, the Tory party only has itself to blame. Attracted to the power and glamour of money, it promoted someone who was always likely to walk off if the decision went against him.\n\nByelections are funny things. They can change the conversation, the sense of what is possible. Just as 20 years ago James Goldsmith set in train the movement that did for David Cameron, so might his son trigger the start of the demise of his successor, Theresa May.\n\nWith its multi-generational plot, power plays and attractive cast, it’s a story that has all the drama of a Bollywood film. Just don’t ask Goldsmith who should star in it.\n\nTHE GOLDSMITH FILE\n\nBorn Frank Zacharias Robin Goldsmith, 20 January 1975 in London. His father was the litigious billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith and his mother Lady Annabel Birley, after whom the Mayfair club Annabel’s is named.\n\nBest of times Winning his Richmond Park seat in 2010 and then holding it five years later with an increased majority.\n\nWorst of times His disastrous and lasting attempt to become Mayor of London earlier this year. Jeremy Corbyn dubbed it a “vile campaign”, and it resulted in Sadiq Khan winning with a record percentage majority.\n\nWhat he says “I’ve never sought to hide who I am. I was dealt a very good hand and I’ve always tried to play it well.”\n\nWhat others say “He was left money by his daddy, he’s never had a job other than a job given to him by his uncle, so what qualification has he got to do anything?” Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Heathrow.\n\n“He is quite shy actually and sometimes he is a little bit nervous of the limelight, which in politics is not necessarily how you succeed.” His friend Tony Juniper, former director of Friends of the Earth."
