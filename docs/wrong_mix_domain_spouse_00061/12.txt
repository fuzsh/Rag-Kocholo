LAHORE, Pakistan, Jan 14: Former Pakistan cricket great turned politician Imran Khan Wednesday said he would challenge in court the seizure of tiles from his wife Jemima on charges of smuggling, reports AFP.

"The seizure is part of the government's victimisation policy," Imran told reporters here.

He said the government was "crumbling" in the face of law and order problems and an economic crunch and since my party poses a serious challenge to the ruling party the government has launched a vilification campaign against me and my family.

Pakistani customs officials intercepted a consignment of hundreds of tiles in December and have registered a case against Jemima, the daughter of the late Franco-British Tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, for illegally exporting antique tiles.

The decorative tiles were destined for her mother Annabelle Goldsmith in London. Jemima Goldsmith married Imran Khan in 1995 and settled in Lahore.

The couple said the shipment was lawful as the tiles were purchased from a local market.

But the customs department referred the tiles to the archeological department which has declared them centuries-old antiques dating from the Mughal era.

Customs officials believe the tiles were originally stolen from a site in southern Thatta district.

Imran who has formed Movement for Justice Party, did not elaborate when he will challenge the confiscation.

He reiterated the tiles were not antiques. They were purchased from Islamabad and the government allegations are "politically motivated and baseless," he added.

"In order to clarify our position following the registration of the case against my wife, we will go to the court."

Export of antiques is an offence punishable by a fine or a maximum imprisonment of five years.
