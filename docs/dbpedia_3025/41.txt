I believe one of the most underrated anime’s ever is Blue Seed. Now it is from the mid 90s, so it IS pretty campy and cheesy at times, and some of the dialogue, subbed or dubbed, is kind of basic. BUT there is so much in the story and characters that have made it one of my all time favorites. I will try to keep any spoilers to a minimum, but there will be some so this is your warning.

So the story is based on the Izumo cycle of Japanese mythology, specifically about the storm god Susanoo, and his human wife Kushinada. We find out there are these parasitic monsters called Aragami, and there is a secret government organization, the Terrestrial Administration Center, that fights them and keep them a secret from the rest of Japan. Our main character, Momiji, is a direct descendant of the Kushinada, and whose sacrifice can stop the Aragami.

First of all I LOVE all the super complex female characters. I won’t say Strong Female Characters™, because while some ARE physically strong, not all of them are. Most of the main characters are female, which is nice in any media, but especially anime, not to mention they aren’t sexy lampshades, refrigeratored, or there for fan service. (I mean, there IS some fanservice, but that’s not their main role)

You have the super empathic Momiji, who has pretty much NO special skills, but who does everything she can to help out in every situation, especially to protect those she loves. One of her first major actions is to save Kusanagi, who at the time was trying to kill her to stop the Aragami. She does come off a bit as an anime cliché, but her compassion and empathy is amazing, and ends up saving the day more than once.

There’s Ryoko Takeuchi, former police officer and number 2 at the TAC, who’s both take charge and no nonsense. There’s Azusa Matsudaira, science officer and general genius who builds most of the TACs weapons. There’s one of my personal favorites Kome Sawaguchi, former soldier in the Self Defense Force; she’s tough as nails and has no time or desire for anything inherently “girlie”. Sakura Yamazaki, a powerful psychic and Miko, who is also very abrasive and selfish.

And they guys aren’t any slouches either. Kusanagi, a human given Aragami souls to protect the Kushinada for the Aragami, who goes rogue and joins with the TAC to stop them, Mr Kunikida, the head of the TAC, full of dad jokes, and haunted by the disappearance of his adopted daughter and Momiji’s sister Kaede. Yoshiki Yaegashi, the computer analysist for the TAC, he was a bit of an otaku nerd nice guy at the beginning, but he really grows into a strong confident person.

The romances are really great too, and they subvert plenty of tropes. The main one is between Momiji and Kusinagi, which is probably the most expected. Then there’s Ryoko and Kunikada, there’s quite an age difference between them but they greatly admire and respect each other. There’s Kome and Yoshiki who are as opposite as can be, and Kome does rag on him in the earlier episodes, but in one of the Omake episodes it’s implied that she is drawn to more sensitive men, so she’s more like a girl picking on the boy she likes, and Yoshiki shows her how strength can come in different forms.

The main plot is also really special. The Aragami are mostly plant based, and much of the story of their fight against humans is about the environment getting revenge for human’s mistreatment of it. This is very much a Shinto based story, about how the Japanese have lost their way. Considering how nature based Shinto is, it’s not hard to see why they might think that. ***BIG SPOILER*** What I also really love, is in the end it isn’t fighting and brute strength that stops the Aragami and Lord Susanoo, but Momiji’s compassion and love, which transforms the energy Susanoo was using to turn all of the citizens of Japan into plants, into a communal sort of warmth that makes the land reborn. Doing so costs her her life, but she is brought back***END OF SPOILER***

It very matter of factly destroys the idea of a patriarchy, as most of the TAC are extremely capable women, whose expertise range from science, to military might, to magic. It also takes the character of the Kushinada, originally meant as passive sacrifice, with little to no agency, and instead makes them into the dynamic hero of the story. One of my favorite scenes is when Momiji has turned herself in to be sacrificed, and it is Kome, Ryoko, and Sakura that bust in and come to the rescue in a real kick ass kind of way. Again, the fact that this was in an anime in 1994, is kind of unbelievable.

As a little treat to viewers there are also the little Omake Theater episodes, just a few minutes long each, which are non cannon jokes, including some 4th wall breaking insight into the difference of painted backrounds and animation cells in a cartoon. It’s basically the most feminist and environmental anime I’ve ever come across, and more people need to know about it.
