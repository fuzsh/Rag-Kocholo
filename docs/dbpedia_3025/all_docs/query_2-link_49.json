        "text": "The New York Seed Improvement Project’s (NYSIP) mission is to oversee the amplification of genetically pure Foundation seed stocks of improved crop varieties developed by Cornell University plant breeding programs, or by other U.S. seed improvement programs, with the goal of increasing access to quality, high-performing seed to New York State growers. NYSIP is commissioned by New York State Dept. of Agriculture & Markets to certify seed grown in New York State and is a member agency of The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies (AOSCA). NYSIP operates as an extension project within the Plant Breeding & Genetics section of Cornell University’s School of Integrative Plant Science.\n\nFoundation Seed Program\n\nThe goal of our Foundation Seed division is to amplify and disseminate foundation seed stocks developed by plant breeders at Cornell to growers in New York. The program takes newly released breeder seed and manages the increase of the variety, following all certification requirements, facilitating the production of the seed at a scale required for entry into commercial production. NYSIP’s Foundation Seed Program currently primarily works with The Cornell Small Grains Project (CSGP) on amplification of new oat, wheat, and barley varieties.\n\nIn 2022 we added “Excelsior Gold”(CU31) malting barley to the Foundation program, and in 2023 “HudsonNY”(CU198) malting barley was brought into the program. These varieties hold great potential for malt houses and brewers looking to source barley and malt from within New York State, especially producers participating in the Farm Brewery licensing program.\n\nFoundation seed is made available for sale by NYSIP to qualified growers.\n\nMore information about our Foundation Seed program\n\nSeed Certification Program\n\nCertified seed is recognized in national and state legislation as seed meeting high standards for genetic purity and quality. Validating identity, health and consistency of seed is important and enables seed growers and companies to market, promote and sell seed that is genetically pure. NYSIP currently focuses primarily on small grain and seed potato certifications but has also inspected soybean, bean, forage crops, vegetable crops, hemp, and vegetatively propagated grasses.\n\nTrained inspectors from the project inspect seed fields and harvesting equipment to make sure they meet the high standards required for Certified seed. Harvested seed lots must pass quality standards for germination rate and purity of seed, both in terms of being free of disease and weed seeds, as well as being true to type. NYSIP works with the NY State Seed Testing Lab for seed viability and purity testing. Certified seed, labeled with its distinctive blue tag, provides a standard for seed quality for NY State farmers. Certified seed can be sourced directly from participating Certified growers who can be found in our Certified Seed directories. For qualified growers, Foundation seed can be purchased direct from our Foundation Seed program.\n\nOverview of the NY Certified Seed program\n\nHow to become a certified seed grower\n\n2023 Certified Seed Crop Directories\n\nNYSIP annually compiles and publishes two grower directories listing all growers who successfully certified small grains and potato seed in New York State. The directories list information about varieties grown, acreages, classifications, and contact info of seed producers offering certified seed for sale. Our most current and previous years’ directories are available on our Grower Directories page."
