        "text": "I’m getting things lined up to start “dining room mural take two.” I painted the mural in my last dining room with very little planning. I just had an idea in my head and used MMS Milk Paint and some acrylics that I had on hand. I was just going to throw the paint on the wall to see how it worked. It’s just paint after all and I could always paint over if it wasn’t working. I kept it very loose, drippy, watery, and light, so I was able to finish it in just a couple of days.\n\nFor this mural, I decided to use Farrow & Ball paints so there is cohesion with the paint colors (Light Blue and Card Room Green) used in adjoining rooms. I also like the idea of having a palette of colors instead of mixing my own colors. I’m sure some amount of mixing will still happen because I can’t help myself, but when I’m working on such a large scale it will be easier and more cohesive to use a set color palette. I think it will also help me to design a loose “paint by number” approach where specific colors live in specific areas instead of colors blending into each other.\n\nSo, I spent some time with my Farrow & Ball paint decks and swatches to put together a palette. I started with colors I already had and then ones I liked that would bring something new to the palette. I was also considering values (lights, mid-tones, and dark), the colors I needed for specific subjects (like shadows on the tree trunks), and a range that would read monochromatic without being boring. Here is the palette of colors I am going to play with…\n\nChine Green No. 35\n\nCalke Green No.34\n\nCard Room Green No. 79\n\nGreen Smoke No. 37\n\nOlive No. 13\n\nBreakfast Room Green No. 81\n\nCooking Apple Green No, 32\n\nChurlish Green No. 251\n\nHay No. 37\n\nSkylight No. 205\n\nLight Blue No. 22\n\nOval Room Blue No. 85\n\nTeresa’s Green No. 236\n\nDix Blue No. 82\n\nStone Blue No. 86\n\nTanner’s Brown No. 255\n\nMouse’s Back No. 40\n\nI will use a pure white paint and create some off-whites using these colors.\n\nThe cool thing about these colors is that I naturally mix similar ones when I’m painting and making color swatches. I think I’ll be able to create a nice hybrid of my own style and the classic mural style I’m going for with these colors.\n\nIn addition to the paint, I’ll use a clear medium to extend the workability of the paint and water to thin it for the base layers. I’ll be figuring it out as I work, but I will make a video and take pictures so I can share the process. I’m also going to do some initial sketches prior to working on the walls and I’ll share those as well.\n\nFor now, it’s just been fun playing with color and dreaming about getting started on the mural. Of course, I still have painting and trim work to do first, but sometimes it’s hard to resist diving into the fun part…"
