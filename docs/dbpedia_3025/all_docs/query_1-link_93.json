        "text": "American novelist\n\nThis article is about the writer. For the rugby union player, see Terry Wright (rugby union).\n\nTerrance Michael \"T. M.\" Wright (September 9, 1947 – October 31, 2015) was an American author best known as a writer of horror fiction, speculative fiction, and poetry. He wrote more than 25 novels as well as novellas and short stories, over 40 years. His novels were translated into many different languages around the world. His works were reviewed by Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, Booklist, and many genre magazines.\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\nWright's first publication was the non-fiction study of unidentified flying objects, entitled The Intelligent Man's Guide to Flying Saucers in 1968 for AS Barnes. Strange Seed had five foreign editions.\n\nHis seventh novel, A Manhattan Ghost Story, has had 14 foreign editions and was optioned to be filmed in the 1980s. A screenplay was written by Ronald Bass for which he was paid two million US dollars, a record-breaking amount for an adaptation of a novel to the screen. The option was taken over by Robert Lawrence Productions in 1991, and then exercised in 1993. Many actors and directors have been attached to the project over the years including Wayne Wang, Julia Roberts, and Sharon Stone (who received five million US dollars because of her pay or play contract). As of 2015, the film is in development at Touchstone Pictures.\n\nWright's fiction appeared in several magazines including Twilight Zone Magazine, PostScripts, Cemetery Dance, Flesh and Blood Magazine, UpState, and Brutarian.\n\nWright had painted book covers and he created illustrations for magazines including Brutarian. He did the artwork for his own book covers of two foreign editions of Cold House (German and Italian language editions), The Eyes of the Carp from Cemetery Dance Publications in 2005, Blue Canoe from PS Publishing, Sleepeasy (from Leisure Books), and his collection Bone Soup from Cemetery Dance Publications.\n\nIn 2004, T. M. Wright was the judge for the inaugural Anubis Awards by Jeff Schwaner (owner of Broken Umbrella Press). He spent the last years of his life in a Corning, New York nursing home living with Parkinson's disease. Has wife, Roxane A. White-Wright lives in Corning, also. T.M. Wright died October 31, 2015, according to PalMac in Memoriam Facebook Page.[1]\n\nSelected bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nNovels and novellas\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Woman Next Door (Playboy Press, 1981 and Tor Books, 1990)\n\nThe Playground (Tor Books, 1982)\n\nCarlisle Street (1983)\n\nThe Island (1988)\n\nThe Place (1989)\n\nThe School (1990)\n\nBoundaries (1990)\n\nThe Last Vampire (1991)\n\nLittle Boy Lost (1992)\n\nCold House (Catalyst Press, 2003) (featuring an introduction by Jack Ketchum)\n\nThe House on Orchid Street (2003)\n\nVisiting the Edge (2004) (a collection)\n\nThe Eyes of the Carp (Cemetery Dance Publications, 2005) (a novella) ISBN 1-58767-111-5\n\nI Am the Bird (2006) (a novella)\n\nBlue Canoe (2008)\n\nSally Pinup (2010) (a novella)\n\nRyerson Biergarten series\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries of novels featuring a detective named Ryerson Biergarten:\n\nThe Changing (as F.
