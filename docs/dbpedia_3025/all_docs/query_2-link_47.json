Grown in Texas.\n\n*We don’t mill your grain until you order it. We believe that the richness of freshly milled grain is a key ingredient in crafting your flavorful beverage.\n\n**Contact us for volume pricing and freight if you are a commercial brewer or distiller. Ordering a few bags at a time through our web site is fine for small orders shipping on UPS to a home crafter’s residence. But orders larger than a few bags can be shipped more economically to a business using LTL freight. Give us a shout and we can quote cost and shipping for larger grain bills."
