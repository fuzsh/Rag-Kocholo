        "text": "\"Singeing Vision of the Firmament\"\n\nNameless Deity of Light, or simply Nameless Deity, is a post-game superboss that is meant to be fought after Entropic God, Noxus has been defeated. It is the final and most difficult encounter in Wrath of the Gods.\n\nSummoning\n\nThe Nameless Deity does not spawn by itself and requires the player to stand under the apple tree in the Eternal Garden, which becomes accessible via the Terminus following the defeat of Entropic God, Noxus. Following this, a brief cutscene will play and the Deity will spawn shortly afterwards.\n\nBehavior\n\nThe Nameless Deity has three phases that it sequentially enters as it loses health, using a variety of extremely dangerous attacks in rapid succession in each phase. Infinite flight is granted for the entire fight. Despite going into the background for some attacks, the Nameless Deity can still be attacked in this state.\n\nPhase One\n\nThe Nameless Deity performs attacks from the following pool:\n\nStarburst\n\nThe Nameless Deity hovers to the side of the player and shoots out a ring of orange fireballs, along with several rings of smaller blue bolts that accelerate and home in on the player.\n\nDimensional Slashes\n\nThe Nameless Deity flies into the background and slashes horizontally at their position five times, leaving a damaging rift in the wake of each slash. Each slash produces two rows of Light Daggers that fly out perpendicular to the slash itself. After the horizontal slashes, the Nameless Deity will perform five slashes forming a pentagon around the player.\n\nStarburst Ring\n\nThe Nameless Deity floats above the player and snaps its fingers to create six twinkles around them, each of which explodes into four homing blue bolts.\n\nCosmic Bursts\n\nThe Nameless Deity charges horizontally above the player, leaving behind a row of portals that fire telegraphed energy rays perpendicular to its flight. This is repeated three times, with the second use charging vertically to the left or right of the player instead. The Nameless Deity also leaves a trail of Primordial Stardust behind the portals which will damage the player if they get too close or try to move behind the portals.\n\nCollapsing Star\n\nThe Nameless Deity snaps its fingers and produces a massive sun before following the player. The sun creates two solar flares that spin around it, with the flares eventually stopping and bursting outwards along with a double ring of fireballs. This is repeated four times, with each burst adding two more solar flares to the sun. Afterwards, the Nameless Deity will disappear and compress the sun into a black hole, which chases the player for the next few seconds while also sucking in sparks from further away.\n\nOn Revengeance Mode, the sparks will home in on the player, while on Death Mode, the sparks will be slightly more numerous and curve in on the black hole's position.\n\nAttack Cycle\n\nThe Nameless Deity performs attacks in the following fixed order, resetting after the last attack:\n\nStarburst\n\nDimensional Slashes\n\nStarburst Ring\n\nCosmic Bursts\n\nStarburst\n\nCollapsing Star\n\nStarburst\n\nCosmic Bursts\n\nPhase Two\n\nUpon reaching 65% health, the Nameless Deity will temporarily vanish as the background is replaced by a monochrome kaleidoscope effect. In Revengeance Mode or higher, two hands will also crush the player's Rage and Adrenaline meters, rendering them unusable for the rest of the battle. Fourteen rows of Light Daggers are then summoned in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines around the player, with each row having a dense cluster centered on the player. The rows will fire increasingly faster as the attack progresses.\n\nFollowing this attack, the Nameless Deity will appear again and start using a new set of attacks. It will no longer use most of its attacks from the previous phase, with the exception of Collapsing Star, which now starts with four solar flares instead of two.\n\nJudgement Cut\n\nThe Nameless Deity disappears and covers the screen in a randomized net of harmless light beams. After a brief delay, it will slash along all the beam telegraphs, creating a visual screen shatter effect and leaving behind short-lived spatial rifts.\n\nFractal Punch\n\nTwo fists line themselves up with the player and punch together, dealing impact damage and exploding into six-way dimensional slashes, each of which produces two perpendicular rows of Light Daggers that fly in a telegraphed fractal pattern.\n\nSolar Sparks\n\nThe Nameless Deity flies into the background and summons six teal stars into existence, which it launches into the foreground after a brief delay. The stars target the area around the player and each explode into four accelerating Solar Sparks on impact. The attack is repeated twice, with the second burst having ten stars instead.\n\nOrion's Sword\n\nThe Nameless Deity creates a massive constellation sword in its hand and points it at the player. After tracking the player for a moment, the Deity will pause and dash at extremely high speed, leaving a dimensional rift in its wake. This attack is repeated four times, with the Nameless Deity teleporting to a random position around the player in between slashes.\n\nConverging Supernova\n\nThe Nameless Deity flies off the screen while bombarding the area around the player with fireballs, which fly outwards after a delay. Afterwards, three ring of large flares will converge on the player's location at the time, with each convergence producing an explosion of fireballs and homing bolts.\n\nAttack Cycle\n\nJudgement Cut\n\nFractal Punch\n\nSolar Sparks\n\nOrion's Sword\n\nConverging Supernova\n\nFractal Punch\n\nSolar Sparks\n\nCollapsing Star\n\nOrion's Sword\n\nConverging Supernova\n\nPhase Three\n\nUpon reaching 30% health, a full-screen visual will flash across the screen and the Nameless Deity will vanish before using a new set of attacks, discarding all attacks from the previous phases outside of Orion's Sword. The background becomes a colorful kaleidoscope pattern during this phase.\n\nLight Slashes\n\nThe screen becomes black and the music becomes muffled as the Nameless Deity vanishes. A crack will appear near the player after a delay, after which a barrage of slashes will emerge and chase them for a few seconds. This is repeated four times, with each crack appearing at a random position around the player after the previous slashes end.\n\nChronos' Hand\n\nThe screen becomes bathed in a brilliant pink light as the Nameless Deity floats to the top left of the player, creating a massive golden clock that tries to stay on top of the player while trapping them inside. The clock will start ticking after a delay, and a spiral of light orbs starts shooting out from the center of the clock. After a delay, the clock will stop and reverse direction, turning all the light orbs red and sucking them back into itself instead. At the end of the attack, two dimensional slashes will strike along the hands of the clock, each one producing two angled rows of Light Daggers.\n\nNote that going too far from the clock will deal a potentially fatal amount of damage in return.\n\nNebula Gigabeam\n\nThe Nameless Deity teleports near the player and, after a charging period, fires an enormous Nebula Gigabeam that spins around to track the player, darkening the screen and muffling all other sounds. The Nameless Deity will also periodically emit six-way dimensional slashes that produce perpendicular rows of Light Daggers. If the player sticks too close to the Nameless Deity or tries to hide behind the laser, the Nameless Deity fires a singular moving starburst at them from its face.\n\nUnlike other attacks, the Nebula Gigabeam grants significantly lesser immunity frames and can quickly whittle down the player's health should they be caught in its path.\n\nMoment of Creation - Genesis\n\nThe background turns black and the Nameless Deity flies into the background, where a grey, censored flower blooms and creates a massive explosion. Newborn Galaxies of varying sizes will start to rain down randomly around the player at an increasing speed, each one telegraphed by a pillar of light.\n\nNote that this attack must be performed at least once before the Nameless Deity can be defeated. If the Nameless Deity is somehow brought to 1 HP before using this attack, it will immediately perform this as its next attack.\n\nAttack Cycle\n\nLight Slashes\n\nOrion's Sword\n\nChronos' Hand\n\nNebula Gigabeam\n\nMoment of Creation - Genesis\n\nAftermath\n\nWhen the Nameless Deity is defeated, the screen will turn black and the text \"You have passed the test.\" will appear in red. Afterwards, countless hands will appear and smash the screen into static, instantly kicking the player back to the title screen. The player will have to load back into the world again, upon which they will spawn back in the overworld and the Nameless Deity's loot will spawn above them, albeit with its name in the boss defeat message obfuscated with incomprehensible symbols.\n\nThe title screen will be automatically set to the Light Dimension theme, with the tModLoader logo now saying \"You have passed the test\". When loading back into the world, the loading bar will display the same thing, while the loading tips will be a continuous repeating string of the aforementioned phrase.\n\nOn subsequent defeats, the player will be able to skip the final cutscene with a button prompt, upon which the Nameless Deity will be defeated and drop its loot like a normal boss.\n\nThe icon of the world that the Nameless Deity was defeated in is permanently replaced by a shattered tree.\n\nA constellation of the player's head can be seen in the Eternal Garden's sky upon returning to the subworld.\n\nWith a rare chance in the sky in the subworld, the stars can line up in a \"thumbs up\" shape. This way, the Nameless Deity will praise the player for their challenge.\n\nThe Light Dimension title screen theme is unlocked.\n\nGood Apples can now be used.\n\nTips\n\nAs Noxus does not drop anything that will help against the Nameless Deity, the same gear preparations for Noxus apply.\n\nThe Exo Box mount is excellent for precision in dodging the Nameless Deity's projectile-heavy attacks, although the player may have to dismount during faster attacks to gain enough speed to avoid them, such as during its Light Slashes in the third phase.\n\nItems that interact with Rage or Adrenaline, such as the Occult Skull Crown, Shattered Community, Gael's Greatsword, and Draedon's Heart, are less effective as they will be disabled for the majority of the fight. They still may be useful if they provide other passive benefits.\n\nThe Rod of Harmony can be a useful tool for dodging tight attacks.\n\nHowever, it is less effective on getfixedboi worlds as the Nameless Deity will smash it when entering Phase 2 and go on a minute-long rant, allowing most cooldowns to refresh.\n\nTrivia\n\n“\n\nHey, this apple isn't bad. It's quite good actually...\n\n流れてく時の中ででも 気だるさが\n\nほらグルグル廻って\n\n— If the player eats a Good Apple on get fixed boi\n\nhttps://terrariamods.wiki.gg/wiki/File:NamelessGoesInsaneOverGoodApple_(Wrath_of_the_Gods).ogg\n\nGeneral\n\nThe Bestiary entry for the Nameless Deity rates its danger level with an excessive amount of stars instead of five, to the point where they no longer fit on the window. In addition, its Bestiary entry is written in a unique, glitchy font and alternates between the following responses at random with each viewing:\n\nPower.\n\nCreation.\n\nCosmic pulchritude.\n\nOmniscience.\n\nTranscendance.\n\nCelestial interweavings.\n\nThe Maker.\n\nUnending.\n\nEternity.\n\nShining light.\n\nRefulgent Blossoms.\n\nThe Whisper of the Flowers.\n\nThe track which plays during the Nameless Deity's fight is Twisted Garden, composed by ENNWAY and Heart Plus Up!.\n\nThe part of the song that plays during the final phase is internally named ARIA BEYOND THE BLAZING FIRMAMENT.\n\nThe name is a reference to an older version of the title for the Nameless Deity's concept art.\n\nThe Nameless Deity is based on Xeroc, a character from the Calamity Mod. It is specifically based on an older iteration of Xeroc who was an all-powerful god of light.\n\nIf the Boss Checklist Mod is installed, its unique despawn message will be \"You have failed the test.\"\n\nIf the Infernum Mod is installed with Infernum Mode enabled, a title card reading \"??????????????????????????????????????????????????\" will show once the Nameless Deity appears.\n\nThe name of one of the Nameless Deity's attacks, \"Judgement Cut\", was named after an attack of the same name preformed by the character Vergil in the video game series Devil May Cry.\n\nIf the player dies to the Nameless Deity, they explode into golden dust. Additionally, the death timer is greatly accelerated and will display a string of integers that gradually scroll back to 0. The chat log will also show one of several unique death messages instead of the usual ones, including:\n\n[Player name]'s purpose has been fulfilled.\n\n[Player name] failed the test.\n\n[Player name] died in spite of their valiant efforts.\n\n[Player name] faded into the aether.\n\n[Player name] became one with all.\n\n[Player name] merged with the symphony of the universe.\n\n[Player name]'s spirit will linger in the garden as their body disintegrates.\n\n[Player name]'s atomic structure was divided for the purpose of being absorbed by the garden.\n\n[Player name] died in bliss as the divine light consumed them.\n\n[Player name]'s journey ended in the sacred embrace of the garden.\n\n[Player name] dissolved into the infinite lattice of existence.\n\n[Player name]'s form will soon be one with the stars.\n\n[Player name] became one with the cosmic tapestry.\n\nIn-fight\n\nIf the Calamity-style Boss Health Bar option is selected, the Nameless Deity's name will only show an ever-changing string of symbols.\n\nOne of approximately fifty-seven sextillion (1021) different unique combinations can be displayed at any moment.\n\nAttempting to use the Noxus Sprayer on the Nameless Deity will make them reflect the spray back towards the player, instantly kicking the player to the title screen with the loading tip being a voiced \"Do not.\"\n\nAttempting to use Rage or Adrenaline after Phase 2 will play a unique sound effect as the Nameless Deity laughs at the player.\n\nThe background during the boss' Light Slashes will flash to show various images, such as Julia fractals, the Terraria title screen, or even a portion of the source code that governs the Nameless Deity's behavior during this attack.\n\nIf Entropic God, Noxus is spawned in the Eternal Garden while the Nameless Deity is alive, the bosses will temporarily ignore the player and attack each other. However, the player can still be damaged if caught between their attacks.\n\nTheir damage against each other is massively increased compared to that against the player, allowing them to potentially deal hundreds of thousands of damage with each attack.\n\nIf Noxus is defeated by the Nameless Deity, it will simply explode instead of playing its usual death cutscene. Its loot will drop as normal.\n\nAppearance\n\nGeneral\n\nSeveral aspects of the Nameless Deity's thematic draw from religious iconography, including religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Paganism.\n\nThe censor being present over the face of the Nameless Deity draws parallels to how several religions describe god as physically incomprehensible.\n\nThe body of the Nameless Deity resembles that of Buddha.\n\nOne of the wings of the Nameless Deity resembles that of a cherub.\n\nThe hands by the Nameless Deity's head are poised in the shape of deer created by hand-shadow puppetry.\n\nOne of the wheels on the back of the Nameless Deity is a dharmachakra. Another one of the wheels is a cut glass design made by decorator Philippe-Joseph Brocard.\n\nThe paper arms of the Nameless Deity include those of Christ the Redeemer, Shiva, Gabriel from Annunciation, God from The Creation of Adam, and Vishnu.\n\nThe Nameless Deity also has six arms during certain attacks, akin to the multi-armed forms of several Hindu and Buddhist gods.\n\nThe flora growing on the Nameless Deity include dangling vines of lavender, sakura branch antlers, as well as wing-side lotus, marigolds, and daisies.\n\nThe true face of the Nameless Deity is that of a sacred lotus turned towards the player's screen. The moth crown behind it is made of an Atlas Moth.\n\nThe paper arms of the Nameless Deity are held at the joints by metallic connectors, much like a doll's or a mannequin's.\n\nThe clocks present on the side of the Nameless Deity do not symmetrically rotate like their flower counterparts. Rather, their handles rotate in step with the in-game time.\n\nPresets\n\nThe Nameless Deity's appearance constantly shifts in-game, with the only consistent feature being the censor bar on its face. The appearance of the boss will change to different fixed forms if the player is named one of several specific names of people who have contributed to the mod.\n\nDominic - The censor of the Nameless Deity is lifted, revealing its true face of an omniscient lotus with a moth's crown.\n\nAdditionally, the Nameless Deity is set to a specific form with spiritually-themed parts. The censored form of this preset is the version used for the Boss Checklist image.\n\nMoonburn - The red parts of the Nameless Deity's aesthetic are tinted blue. Additionally, the background of the fight has a similar blue tint applied to synchronize with the changed colors.\n\nMyra - The Nameless Deity is set to a specific form with pale, angelic parts, and tinted golden.\n\nSnake - The Nameless Deity's censor is replaced with a black and white X-ray sketch of a morphed torso and a vaguely butterfly-shaped head. Additionally, the Nameless Deity is set to a specific form with forest-related parts.\n\nThe butterfly-shaped sketch is a recolored cross-section of the spinal cord.\n\nAster - The Nameless Deity is set to a specific form of blue and purple parts.\n\nLynel - The Nameless Deity is set to a specific form with elk antlers and raven wings.\n\nAdditionally, the sound played during the Nebula Gigabeam is replaced with Jerma985's \"I'm Killing You\" rant.\n\nToasty - The Nameless Deity is set to a specific form with a color palette akin to that of toasted bread.\n\nBlast - The Nameless Deity gains a top hat in reference to the Hat Kid from A Hat in Time.\n\nThe same contributor has a similar reference in the Infernum Mod in the form of the Blasted Tophat.\n\nGinYuH - The Nameless Deity changes each and every one of its parts every frame (~0.0167 seconds).\n\nDue to its extremely loud visuals, this preset will not be activated if the in-game photosensitivity mode is toggled on.\n\nsmh - The Nameless Deity spins every moment.\n\nAmmyan - The Nameless Deity is 247.63% as wide.\n\nLGL - The censor is replaced with a screenshot of the tester giving the middle finger.\n\nGet fixed boi\n\n“\n\nGet that Rod of Harmony out of here, I don't ever want to see that ever again!\n\nI mean, what was Re-Logic thinking? A rod of discord with no cooldown? Seriously? Post-Moon Lord modding is RUINED... Come on, man. I wanted to create a universe that is fair and square. But the Rod of Harmony ruins EVERYTHING. So no. I'm not letting you use it. You thought you could troll me, and it turns out YOU'RE the one getting trolled. And you know that. Hell, you probably already knew that anyway. You probably looked up the fight on the Internet. You probably KNOW that I'm doing this. I mean, I can't see why you wouldn't expect it, I already smashed the Rage and Adrenaline, of COURSE I'm going to smash the Rod of Harmony! But now, I'm gonna have to smash you.\n\nOoh, that came out wrong...\n\nBasically, what it boils down to is I don't like cheaters. And if you disagree with that, I don't know what you're doing here.
