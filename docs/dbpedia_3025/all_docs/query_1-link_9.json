        "text": "Dan Dăscălescu is a Romanian-American entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley, who co-founded[2] the ship-based seed accelerator project Blueseed in an attempt to allow entrepreneurs to start companies near Silicon Valley without US visa restrictions. He is also a public speaker[3][4][5][6][7] and former software engineer at Google[7] and Yahoo! and ambassador for The Seasteading Institute, a think tank researching ocean communities.[8]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nDăscălescu was born in Romania and immigrated into Silicon Valley in fall 2004,[9] after facing visa issues. He applied for a green card in 2007[1] and received it in April 2013.[10] Dăscălescu cited his visa difficulties as an inspiration for Blueseed, a startup accelerator that would avoid immigration restrictions by being located on a ship in international waters.[8]\n\nBefore Blueseed, Dăscălescu worked at Yahoo! as a software globalization developer and open-source contributor, and became an ambassador for the Seasteading Institute[11] and founded the Quantified Self Forum, an online community for users passionate about self-tracking.[12]\n\nWhile in Romania, he translated books on TCP/IP networking[13] and on building web applications.[14] Dascalescu has a degree in Computer Science, with published papers on knowledge modeling[15] and robotics.[16]\n\nMost recently, Dăscălescu worked as a Developer Advocate for AI startup Weaviate[3] and Google.[7]\n\nBlueseed\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Blueseed\n\nBlueseed was a startup community project that Dăscălescu co-founded with Seasteading Institute colleagues Max Marty and Dario Mutabdzija, and served as CIO for. The project prepared to launch a ship near Silicon Valley to serve as a startup community and entrepreneurial incubator without United States work visa requirements. The platform was set to offer living and office space, high-speed Internet connectivity, and regular ferry service to the mainland.[17][18] The existence of the project is due to the lack of U.S. visas for entrepreneurs. Instead, customers will use the much easier to obtain B-1/B-2 visas to travel to the mainland, while work will be done exclusively on the ship.[17][18]\n\nOn July 31, 2013, Dăscălescu became COO of Blueseed, after CEO Max Marty announced he was stepping back from day-to-day operations.[19]\n\nPersonal\n\n[edit]\n\nDăscălescu's interests include transhumanism,[20] life extension,[21] physical fitness and self-quantification. He completed the P90X program and presented his findings at the 2011 Quantified Self conference, contrasting it with the Occam Protocol described by Tim Ferriss in Four Hour Body.[22] He is an open-source contributor,[23] advocates for English to be used as a global language[24] and challenges religion.[25]"
