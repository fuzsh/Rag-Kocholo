The lab has a long track record of contributing to formal undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\n\nThe constant contact with a broad range of clients who manage seeds or make seed business decisions such as seed growers, cleaners, analysts, and dealers makes it possible to design the services that respond to current and long term needs.\n\nTraining is presented in flexible customer-friendly formats, from individual study to group workshops to online courses. All training held in the lab focuses primarily on hands-on experience, accompanied by formal instruction as needed."
