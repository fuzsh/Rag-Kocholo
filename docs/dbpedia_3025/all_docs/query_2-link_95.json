        "text": "Removing the coffee seeds (aka beans) from the coffee cherry takes work. There are a few ways farmers do this. The two main methods used around the world are washed processing, also called wet processing, and natural processing, also known as dry processing.\n\nIf the coffee is washed (the more common method), then the cherry goes through a pulping machine, where the fruit’s outer skin is removed, but the fruit flesh remains. These pulpy seeds are then soaked, or fermented, to help remove the clinging bits of fruit, scrubbing the seeds clean. Washed coffees differ in flavor depending on origin, but common to all good-quality washed coffees is clarity and smoothness.\n\nNatural processing is the older way of removing coffee seeds from cherry. No water is used in this method. Instead the entire fruit dries on racks beneath the sun before the coffee seeds can be removed. This process takes many days, even weeks. To do it well, producers monitor cherry’s moisture levels, frequently turning piles of red cherry over to prevent mildew. When done with utmost attention, naturals are exquisite, fruity with a syrupy mouthfeel because of the prolonged contact between seed and fruit.\n\n6. Ferment the cherry\n\nDepending on the producer and the country in which we are buying, this step happens at all different times in the supply chain. Oftentimes we get our coffee from producers we’ve long admired, whom we see as partners, and have known for years. Other times, we are forming new relationships, or working with exporters who’ve done the groundwork to work with producers in regions too remote for our team to visit.\n\nIn countries where national restrictions dictate how producers interact with roasters, like Ethiopia or Kenya, we often buy at the point of export through nationally regulated systems.\n\n10.
