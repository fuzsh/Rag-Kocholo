Being immune to traditional combat damage, players must use their Mining, Smithing and Runecraft skills to create imbued tephra capable of destroying her stone armour. Once her armour has been destroyed, they must damage her by mining her with a pickaxe.\n\nZalcano's prison can be accessed from Prifddinas' Trahaearn district via a teleport platform just west of the south-eastern bank. As Prifddinas requires completion of Song of the Elves to access, Zalcano requires a minimum of 70 Mining and Smithing to be fought, though higher levels in Mining, Smithing and Runecraft will be advantageous, as well as higher Hitpoints to withstand her various attacks. All of Zalcano's attacks are typeless, meaning that protection prayers cannot be used to reduce their chance of taking damage or the damage itself.\n\nIronmen are eligible for rewards from Zalcano when defeating it alongside other players.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n\nZalcano is a demon and Skotizo's sister, who both held the rank of general in Zamorak's armies. During the God Wars, when Zamorak personally sent Skotizo and his squad to recover an artefact in the Karamjan Temple, Skotizo eagerly took the mission only to betray his squad and take the artefact for himself, escaping to a certain continent far west. Zamorak held Zalcano personally responsible for her brother's treachery, and cursed her to slowly turn to stone, which would only be lifted if she brought her brother back to him.\n\nBelieving that Skotizo had fled to the elven lands of Tirannwn, Zalcano made her way there. The elves initially believed she was the first of many demons to attack their city, but to their surprise, she was the only one and roamed the forests as if she was looking for something. Amlodd mystics soon learned a curse was slowly turning her to stone, and this prompted the Trahaearn Clan to capture her for study. The Ithell and Trahaearn Clans worked together to create a prison in the volcanic caverns to keep her in the city, and successfully captured her, albeit with many casualties.\n\nFollowing her capture, the curse accelerated, with an elf believing it to be the result of Zamorak already knowing she had failed her mission. With the help of Amlodd magic and Meilyr potions, the elves learned why she came to Tirannwn.\n\nThough she had appeared to have slowly descended into madness, the elves dared not to release her as they had lost many of their brethren luring her inside and did not want her power to grow unchecked. The aforementioned elf returned many years later to personally see the demon they were studying, and was surprised when she talked, simply muttering the name \"Skotizo\".\n\nToday, she remains in Prifddinas, and the Trahaearn elves who study her often require aid in keeping her in check.[1]\n\nOfficial worlds[edit | edit source]\n\nThe following official worlds are assigned to Zalcano:\n\nWorld Location Members Activity 375 Germany 1 Zalcano 378 United States (west) 1 Zalcano\n\nRecommended Items[edit | edit source]\n\nA Pickaxe (Required)\n\nGraceful outfit\n\nFood\n\nStamina potions\n\nAttacks[edit | edit source]\n\nWhile the player is inside the prison, Zalcano has six different attacks that the player must watch out for as they attempt to take on the stone demon. Each of the attacks are performed at random intervals throughout the fight.\n\nZalcano will stomp on the ground, causing boulders to fall from the ceiling. These are easily avoided by stepping at least one tile away. Boulders can be easily spotted by watching out for the falling pebbles/dirt, which will be followed by the falling boulder. It is also easy to know which tile they are falling onto by the location of their shadow on the ground. When demonic symbols are summoned, they may obscure the shadow, making the attack more difficult to notice. Players who are hit by these can take 40+ damage.\n\nZalcano will summon blue and orange demonic symbols. If a player is standing on a blue demonic symbol when attacking Zalcano with imbued tephra, it will increase the player's damage by 50%. The orange demonic symbols, however, should be avoided: These will damage the player as well as reduce their run energy if they pass through it or stand in it. After the first three ticks upon spawning, they deal increasing damage every tick (maxing in the low 20s) if a player stands within them and can very quickly kill players that are not paying attention.\n\nZalcano will summon a golem on the edge of the prison. If the golem reaches her, it will restore her armour's health based on the health of the golem. If the golem is at full health, it will restore 50 hitpoints towards her armour. It is possible for a player to hurt the golem with the imbued tephra. The golem will also drop 16-24 imbued tephra when killed.\n\nZalcano will fire a red ball of energy at the current glowing red rock formation to deactivate it, changing its location. If a player is standing within 1 tile of the rock formation when this happens, they will take 21+ damage. These can be avoided by walking away from the rock.\n\nAfter Zalcano has fallen and players have caused her damage, she will rise again. If any players are standing next to her while this occurs, she will create a shock wave push them back, causing the player small amounts of damage and briefly stunning them. Additionally, when she rises she will destroy all of the imbued tephra in the room.\n\nZalcano will randomly hit all players within the prison with a barrage of small pebbles. These are not avoidable, but players will only take a few hitpoints worth of damage.\n\nPlayers will also get damaged if they stand under Zalcano when she has fallen. Damage rate is much less than an orange symbol, dealing around 3-10 damage per tick, and the danger persists until Zalcano begins to rise again.\n\nMax Hit Calculation[edit | edit source]\n\nAttacking Zalcano[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen attacking Zalcano by throwing imbued tephra at her shield, the max hit will be calculated by dividing the average of the player's Smithing and Runecraft level by seven, and adding that number to a base damage of five.[2] In other words, the calculation follows the formula: 5+(Smithing+Runecraft)/27\n\nMoreover, there is a chance to add an additional point to the maximum hit that increases as the player's average approaches the next threshold of seven levels.[3] The maximum hit will be increased 50% further if the player stands on a blue demonic sigil while throwing the tephra.[4]\n\nMining Zalcano[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen attacking Zalcano with a pickaxe the max hit is calculated from the following table based on mining level plus max((P−40)/15,0)where P is the level requirement for the pickaxe being used.[5]\n\nMining Level Max Hit 95–104 33 85–94 32 75–84 31 1–74 30\n\nBonus damage from pickaxe Pickaxe Bonus Rune pickaxe 41 +0 Dragon pickaxe 61 +1 Crystal pickaxe 71 +2\n\nRegardless of the amount of damage done, the same amount of Mining experience is awarded per hit.\n\nZalcanoLevel required 1 Mining XP[i 1]35.2 xpRequired toolAny pickaxeRespawn timeN/A\n\nLocation[edit | edit source]\n\nLocation Levels Members Spawns Map Volcanic caverns beneath Prifddinas3361Maplink\n\nMoney making[edit | edit source]\n\nThe following money making guide is available for Zalcano:\n\nMethodHourly profitSkillsKilling Zalcano1,559,211\n\n70+\n\nAll Song of the Elves' quest requirements\n\nDrops[edit | edit source]\n\nPlayers must do at least 5 shield damage to Zalcano's hitpoints to be eligible for drops, and 31 combined damage to be eligible for uniques and pet.\n\nDrops from the main table and from the tertiary table scale with the player's points from the kill. The points are calculated as shown in fig.1, For the tertiary table, the damage to hitpoints and shield are capped to a max of 400 and 300 respectively, for a maximum of 1,000 points.[6]\n\nPM=H+2×SPT=min⁡(H,400)+2×min⁡(S,300)\n\nWhere PM is points towards main table, PT is points towards tertiary table, H is damage to hitpoints and S is damage to shield.\n\nThe MVP, the player who deals the most damage to Zalcano, will also receive an additional 10% (rounded up) of their non-unique loot.\n\nPlayers can speak to Rhiannon to switch between receiving item drops or Mining experience. This does not affect the unique drop table, which is always rolled regardless of choosing items or experience.\n\nDrop rates estimated based on 655,595 samples from the Drop Rate Project, unless otherwise cited.\n\nThe average Zalcano kill is worth 198,964.52.\n\n100%[edit | edit source]\n\nInfernal ashes are only dropped for the MVP. Players eligible for a drop will receive one crystal shard, players eligible for unique drops or pet will receive two shards and the MVP will receive three shards.[7]\n\nItem Quantity Rarity Price High Alch Crystal shard1–3AlwaysNot soldN/A Infernal ashes1Always3,7841\n\nRunes[edit | edit source]\n\nItem Quantity Rarity Price High Alch Blood rune64–4801/3614,912–111,84015,360–115,200 Cosmic rune295–9261/3630,090–94,4528,850–27,780 Death rune201–8311/3639,798–164,53821,708–89,748 Law rune166–7901/3627,058–128,77023,904–113,760 Soul rune47–3921/369,917–82,7128,460–70,560 Nature rune1–8421/36136–114,512108–90,936\n\nMaterials[edit | edit source]\n\nItem Quantity Rarity Price High Alch Silver ore86–800 (noted)3/366,364–59,2003,870–36,000 Coal169–938 (noted)1/3622,139–122,8784,563–25,326 Mithril ore56–388 (noted)2/369,632–66,7365,432–37,636 Adamantite ore51–297 (noted)2/3644,268–257,79612,240–71,280 Runite ore3–27 (noted)2/3631,722–285,4985,760–51,840 Gold ore86–721 (noted)3/3614,104–118,2447,740–64,890 Steel bar77–534 (noted)3/3642,042–291,5644,620–32,040 Mithril bar53–459 (noted)3/3642,135–364,9059,540–82,620 Adamantite bar13–107 (noted)2/3624,193–199,1274,992–41,088 Runite bar3–27 (noted)2/3636,909–332,1819,000–81,000 Uncut diamond2–21 (noted)2/364,434–46,557240–2,520 Uncut dragonstone1–12 (noted)2/3613,820–165,840600–7,200 Onyx bolt tips1–452/368,763–394,335600–27,000 Pure essence784–5,500 (noted)1/36784–5,5001,568–11,000\n\nTertiary[edit | edit source]\n\nEvery Zalcano kill has a 1/200 chance of rolling the crystal tool seed table which includes a 1/40 chance for uncut onyx.

The chance of landing on the crystal tool seed table is now 1/200 with a 1/8000 chance of getting an uncut onyx. The Zalcano shard has been removed from this table and will now be rolled as a tertiary drop (like pets). The amount of mithril, gold and silver ore received as drops has also been reduced.\n\n13 February 2020\n\n(update)\n\nThe MVP now no longer receives a second roll on the standard loot table, but instead gets 10% extra non-unique loot.\n\nEvery kill will now trigger a 1/500 roll which, if it passes, will add a unique to the drop table. A separate roll will then be made to decide which unique that will be. Finally, the unique is given to an eligible player, the likelihood of which is determined upon each player's participation. This does not apply to Smolcano, the pet drop.\n\nThe non-unique drop table for Zalcano has been rebalanced to include less valuable items.\n\n8 August 2019\n\n(update)\n\nZalcano's symbols now take slightly longer before dealing damage.\n\nThe damage taken when standing beneath Zalcano after she's been knocked down has been reduced.\n\nThe quick-pass option on Zalcano's prison barrier has been removed, as it served a limited purpose.\n\nThe falling rocks during the Zalcano encounter now deal damage when hitting the floor rather than the player to be consistent with other similar mechanics.\n\nZalcano now takes a consistent amount of time to destroy the glowing rock.\n\nZalcano's death animation has been extended to prevent her from reappearing for a brief moment.\n\nThe drops from the golem will now only be given to the player who deals the most damage.\n\n1 August 2019\n\n(update)\n\nPlayers who contribute a fair amount now receive a drop on Zalcano's better loot table, with the quantities of items being received scaling based on individual contribution.\n\nEverybody above a certain threshold of contributing will have a chance of receiving any of the unique drops, including the pet, with the chance scaling based on individual contribution.\n\nThe MVP still receives Zalcano's additional drop, but from a \"lesser\" drop table\n\nTrivia[edit | edit source]\n\nIn the Trailblazer League, it was possible to fight Zalcano without the Mining or Smithing requirement, because Song of the Elves could be automatically completed."
