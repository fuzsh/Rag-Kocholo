        "text": "Big Bluestem\n\nA warm season, perennial bunch grass that grows to a height of 3 to 8 feet. It has roots that permeate the top two feet of soil. Big Bluestem is adapted to moist, deep, well-drained soils. It is very palatable and nutritious. Big Bluestem, if continuously grazed closer than 6 to 8 inches, will be replaced by less desirable grasses. It also works well in pure stands or mixed with other grasses. Used extensively for nesting habitat, and reclamation projects.\n\nLittle Bluestem\n\nA warm season, leafy perennial grass that grows to a height of 1 to 4 feet. It can be grazed and has good forage value when the leaves are tender. It does not cure well and has moderate palatability for fall or winter grazing. Recommended in a mixture of warm season grasses for erosion control or summer pasture.\n\nSideoats Grama\n\nSide Oats Grama is a warm season, erect native perennial grass that grows in tufts and open bunches to a height of 1 to 2 feet tall. It is more tolerant to drought than Indiangrass or Big Bluestem. It grows fast in late spring and early summer and stays green late into the summer. Side Oats Grama has good forage value and is grazed mostly in late summer and fall. It is found primarily on poorly developed shallow soiled, steep slopes, and ridgetops. Primary use is in grass mixtures for rangeland seedings. Its excellent seeding vigor allows rapid establishment.\n\nBlue Grama\n\nA warm season short tufted perennial of the mixed grass prairie that is widely distributed on medium to heavy soils throughout the Dakotas and Minnesota. It has high drought tolerance on all soil types. Primarily used in rangeland seed mixes, low maintenance turf areas and roadsides.\n\nIndiangrass\n\nA warm season grass that spreads by seed and short rhizomes. It grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and will grow on sandy soil, it is better adapted to moist well-drained bottomlands. Indiangrass exhibits moderate salt tolerance and will withstand occasional flooding. It makes good quality hay, and is found primarily in the tall grass prairie, and mixed-grass prairie. Primary use is in wildlife habitat and native range and pasture mixtures.\n\nGreen Needlegrass\n\nA cool season, perennial bunch type grass that grows from 1 1/2 to 3 feet tall. It is a native grass that grows on medium to fine textured soils. Green Needlegrass starts growth early in the spring, and is nutritious, palatable, and remains green throughout the year. Stand establishment may be slow because of high dormant seed percentage.\n\nSwitchgrass\n\nA warm season, perennial grass often found growing in large clumps to a height of 2 to 5 feet. It is found primarily in the tall-grass prairie on good moisture sites, and can stand flooding for short periods. Primary use is in wildlife habitat plantings, and in waterways. It has potential for summer pasture on good moisture sites, exhibits rapid growth in late spring and early summer and is readily grazed by livestock. It is high yielding and produces best if cut early.\n\nBuffalograss\n\nBuffalograss is a warm season, short, stoloniferous, dense, sod-forming grass. Buffalograss is palatable and nutritious as forage. It recovers rapidly after a drought and can withstand heavy grazing. It is primarily used as a low maintenance turf grass for lawns, airstrips and road shoulders.\n\nPrairie Sandreed\n\nPrairie Sandreed is a drought-tolerant, strong rhizomatous, sod-forming grass. Early growth is nutritious, but forage value is only fair due to high fiber and lignin content. The leaves are light green with a leathery texture; stems are coarse. Its primary use is in rangeland seed mixtures on sandy soils where it is well adapted. Prairie Sandreed is is excellent for stabilization of sandy soils. Seed supplies are usually quite scarce.\n\nCreeping Foxtail\n\nCreeping Foxtail is a cool season, very early maturing, high palatable, perennial, and sod-forming grass that grows best on wet or imperfectly drained soils. It tolerates long periods of flooding in early spring and a uniformly moist soil, exceeding 50 percent of field capacity, is beneficial during seedling emergence for successful establishment. The light fluffy seed tends to clog grain drills. Primary use is for hay, pasture and conservation plantings on wet or imperfectly drained soils. Seed is very light and easily transported to other wet sites.\n\nSand Dropseed\n\nSand Dropseed is a warm season, perennial bunch grass that grows to a height of 1 to 2 1/2 feet. Growth starts in mid-spring and plants are mature by mid summer. It is a prolific seed producer and has high drought tolerance, allowing it to take over thin stands of alfalfa or other less greedy grasses.\n\nIndian Ricegrass\n\nIndian Ricegrass is a cool season, perennial, bunch type grass. It grows from 1 to 2 1/2 feet tall. It produces the most forage in spring and early summer and also provides excellent winter grazing as it cures well and the lower stems remain green throughout the winter. It is very drought resistant and tolerates some alkali and low fertility soils.\n\nIntermediate Wheatgrass\n\nA cool season, tall, perennial, sod-forming grass with a vigorous root system similar to that of bromegrass. It is easy to establish. Growth starts in early spring. Though usually dormant during the dry hot summer months, it resumes growth in fall. A high yielding grass generally adapted to the northern Great Plains.\n\nSlender Wheatgrass\n\nA short-lived, cool-season, perennial bunchgrass. It is primarily used in seed mixtures of introduced and native grasses due to its excellent seed vigor, ease of establishment and fast growth. Plants lose vigor, and decline in abundance within three to four years. Presence in mixtures improves stand productivity, especially during the first production year, until other grasses become better established. It possesses a high tolerance to saline-alkali soils.\n\nTall Wheatgrass\n\nTall Wheatgrass is a hardy, drought tolerant perennial bunch type grass with coarse foliage. It is quite alkali tolerant and best adapted to low marshy and high water table areas. Tall wheatgrass is used widely in nesting mixtures and to a lessor degree in reclamation work.\n\nWestern Wheatgrass\n\nWestern Wheatgrass is a native, cool season, perennial, sod forming grass, which reproduces from underground rhizomes and seeds. Western Wheatgrass spreads rapidly and forms a dense sod, making it valuable for erosion control. It produces an abundance of forage early in the season that is nutritious and readily eaten by livestock until late summer when it becomes harsh and fibrous. It makes a good quality hay if cut during the late bloom, and can stand close grazing. Western Wheatgrass will do well on a wide range of soils, from sands to clays. It is very tolerant to alkali. It can be seeded in pure stands but is usually used in mixtures because it provides ground cover quite slowly.\n\nThickspike Wheatgrass\n\nThickspike Wheatgrass is a strong rhizomatous, perennial, sod-forming grass found on rough, broken buttes and to a limited extent on sagebrush flats with native grasses on adapted sites. Also used for revegetation of disturbed areas, roadsides and other critical areas that receive little or no maintenance.\n\nWildrye Grasses\n\nWildrye Grasses have rather coarse, rough and stemmy foliage. They are hardy, easily established and make early spring growth. They give quick ground cover, so their main use is in revegetation and soil holding. They are rather tolerant to alkali and grow well on many kinds of soil.\n\nRussian Wildrye\n\nRussian Wildrye is an early, long-lived, cool-season, drought tolerant, perennial bunchgrass with fine basal leaves. It is a special purpose grass used primarily to extend the grazing season into late fall. Protein content of the forage remains at relatively high levels when saved for fall grazing. It possesses a moderately high tolerance to saline-alkali soils. Highly competitive with other forage species, Russian Wildrye is recommended for fall grazing in separate pastures as a single species.\n\nAltai Wildrye\n\nAltai Wildrye is and early, long-lived, cool-season, drought tolerant, winter hardy, perennial bunchgrass with coarse, erect leaves. It is a special purpose grass used to extend the grazing season into late fall and winter. Upright and erect stature and leaf retention after snowfall permits late fall/early winter grazing. It is especially adapted to loam and clay soils. The root system is extensive and penetrates to depths of 10 feet. It possesses a high tolerance to saline-alkali soils, but less than tall wheatgrass. Forage nutritional value is limited to its low seed yield. Recommended as a single species stand for grazing.\n\nCanada Wildrye\n\nCanada Wildrye is a tall growing, coarse perennial bunchgrass. It is winter hardy. Grows well on many kinds of soil but is especially well adapted to sandy soil. Produces early spring grazing. Seedlings are vigorous. Its best use is in mixtures with other grasses.\n\nGreat Basin Wildrye\n\nGreat Basin Wildrye is a perennial bunchgrass native to much of the western United States. Great Basin wildrye is a tall grass that provides excellent grazing for livestock, and nesting and escape for wildlife. It can also be used as a grass windbreak for wind erosion protection or to control blowing snow. Great Basin Wildrye is adapted to a broad range of soil textures, but does not do well on coarse or shallow soils and is susceptible to leaf and stem rusts.\n\nPrairie Cordgrass (Spartina pectinata)\n\nThis dramatic native grass has a graceful, weeping form that takes on rich golden tints in autumn. Prairie cordgrass is also called ripgut, marshgrass, and sloughgrass, it is found in moist low areas, ditches, and marshy areas. Prefers deep, heavy, wet lowland soils. Can occur in both fresh and salt water. It reproduces from seeds and rhizomes. Often forms dense stands. The leaf blades are very coarse, with pointed teeth along the margins. When rubbed, it can cut the skin, which is what the common name “ripgut” refers to. It is fast growing and can be used to prevent soil erosion. It grows throughout much of the U.S. Prairie cordgrass is of poor forage value when mature, but can be eaten by livestock during its early growth stage. It will produce moderate quality hay when harvested before the stems develop. It also provides good cover for wildlife. It often remains erect through the winter. Red-winged blackbirds will nest in it."
