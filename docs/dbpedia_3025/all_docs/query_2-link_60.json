The effects are well balanced and appreciated by all consumers. Flavors range from sour, lemony, sweet, and even gassy.\n\nThe plant is very nice and compact, and because of the haze genes, this plant tends to be slightly taller than the other crosses of Gelato #41 Auto. Indoors, this plant can produce up to 500g/m2 if grown correctly, with a height of 100/140 cm. Outdoors it is also very resistant and can produce up to 80/100g per plant.\n\nThis genetic is characterized by medium node spacing and good number of branches. The flowers are elongated and full of trichomes, with colors ranging from dark green to purple.\n\nThe most expressed terpenes are D-Limonene, β-Caryophyllene and α-Humulene"
