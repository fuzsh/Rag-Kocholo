        "text": "Japanese manga artist\n\nYuzo Takada (高田裕三, Takada Yūzō, born March 21, 1963 in Edogawa, Tokyo) is the pseudonym of Yūji Takada (高田裕次, Takada Yūji), a popular Japanese manga artist. He worked as an assistant for manga artist Fujihiko Hosono before starting his career as an original author. His first work appeared in November 1983 in Young Magazine, and his first series Tokonatsu Bank started in that publication in January 1984 and ran until February 1985.\n\nTakada is better known for his supernatural manga 3x3 Eyes and Blue Seed, and for the comedy-action manga All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku. The anime versions of these series all star voice-actress Megumi Hayashibara. In 1993, he won the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen for 3x3 Eyes.[1]\n\nTakada has also worked on character design and illustration for video games, including Enix's Just Breed.\n\nSelected bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nShuushoku Beginner (1983)\n\nEndless Summer Bank aka Tokonatsu Bank (January 2, 1984 – February 18, 1985)\n\nTour Conductor, Nikumori (March 3, 1985 – September 1, 1986)\n\nSportion KIDs (November 17, 1986 – November 2, 1987)\n\nEvery Day is Sunday (November 13, 1987 – February 10, 1989)\n\n3x3 Eyes (December 14, 1987 – 2002)\n\nToritsuki-kun (February 1989 – March 1991)\n\nAll Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku (1990)\n\nBlue Seed (1992–1995)\n\nThe New All-Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku (1997–1998)\n\nGenzou Hitogata Kiwa (1998–2004)\n\nTsukumo Nemuru Shizume (2004–2006)\n\nLittle Jumper (2004–August 2008)\n\nUltraman: The First (2004–2008)\n\n3x3 Eyes Gaiden (2009–2010)\n\nCaptain Alice (2009–2013)\n\nLunfor (2013)\n\n3x3 Eyes: Genjuu no Mori no Sounansha (2014–2016)\n\n3x3 Eyes: Kiseki no Yami no Keiyakusha (2016–ongoing)\n\nMugou no Schnell Gear: Chikyuugai Kisouka AI (2019–ongoing)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
