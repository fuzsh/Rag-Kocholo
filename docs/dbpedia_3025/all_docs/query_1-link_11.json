        "text": "American entrepreneur\n\nMax Marty is an entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley, who co-founded the seed accelerator project Blueseed with Dario Mutabdzija and Dan Dascalescu. He was previously Director of Business Strategy at The Seasteading Institute.[3]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nMarty was born in Florida of Cuban political refugees. He graduated from Muhlenberg College with a B.S. in Global Political Economy and Philosophy. Later, he obtained an MBA from the University of Miami.[2]\n\nBlueseed\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Blueseed\n\nBlueseed is a startup community project that Marty co-founded in July 2011[4] with Seasteading Institute colleague Dario Mutabdzija and seasteading ambassador Dan Dascalescu.[5][6] The project is preparing to launch a ship near Silicon Valley to serve as a startup community and entrepreneurial incubator without United States work visa requirements. The platform is set to offer living and office space, high-speed Internet connectivity, and regular ferry service to the mainland.[5][6] The existence of the project is due to the lack of U.S. visas for entrepreneurs. Instead, customers will use the much easier to obtain B-1/B-2 visas to travel to the mainland, while work will be done exclusively on the ship.[5][6]\n\nOn July 31, 2013, Marty announced he was stepping back from day-to-day operations at Blueseed and taking on the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors.[7]\n\nAppearances\n\n[edit]\n\nMarty's first television appearances were in December 2011, on the After the Bell show with Liz Claman and David Asman[8] and on the Stossel Show with John Stossel.[9] On April 13, 2012, Marty presented Blueseed at TEDx Monterey.[10][11] He was later interviewed by Richard Quest for CNN International,[12] Melissa Francis for Fox Business[13] and Jeff Glor for CBS This Morning.[14] In November 2011, he spoke on Big Picture Science with Seth Shostak.[15]\n\nPersonal\n\n[edit]\n\nMarty said he would like to live in a society close to minarchism[16] and if he weren't working in Blueseed, he would pursue radical but practical innovation in education, telecommunications, augmented reality, and clothing.[2]\n\nMarty is signed up for cryonics and runs the Cryonics Underground podcast.[17]"
