        "text": "The Special World is a unique region in Super Mario Wonder that can only be accessed through one of the seven hidden Special World entrances. The Special World is home to some of the most challenging courses in the Flower Kingdom, and despite their difficulty, each course houses at least one Wonder Seed.\n\nTo find the first Wonder Seed, use the rolling Hoppos to activate the P-Switch and reveal a lengthy trail of Blue Coins. At the end of the trail, leap onto the bridge between the trees to retrieve this Wonder Seed.\n\nThe second Wonder Seed will be given to you upon completing this course. After snagging the first Wonder Seed, enter the Warp Pipe, then leap off the Hoppos in the following area to grab the Goal Pole and free the imprisoned Poplin.\n\nTo collect the first Wonder Seed, ascend through the course until the colorful blocks lead you to a cliff. Quickly wall-jump between the cliff and the vertical colorful blocks to reach the top of the course. From here, it's just a short sprint to the Wonder Seed, and you'll have made it before the goop swallows you up.\n\nThe finish goal post is just a few feet away from the last Wonder Seed, so you can take your victory lap up the steps and hop over to get the final Wonder Seed for this level.\n\nAfter collecting the third Flower Coin from beneath the clockwise rotating firebar, you'll reach a tunnel of moving blocks. Wait for the blocks to move out of your way, then sprint through to find this Wonder Seed at the end of the path.\n\nAfter collecting the third Flower Coin, continue climbing up the poles, and when you reach the top, you'll notice a brief pause in the action. Soon, a giant balloon enemy will fly in from the right side of the screen. Bounce off the green balloon to reach the pole overhead, then wait for a pink balloon to shoot out of the cannon to your right. Bounce off the pink balloon to propel yourself toward the Wonder Seed above you, and the course Wonder Effects will be disabled.\n\nAfter grabbing the Wonder Seed to enter a freefall, survive your hazard-filled descent and avoid the moving walls of sludge. As you near the end of this Wonder Effect sequence, you'll notice a small trail of Gold Coins at the center of two walls of sludge. Dive through the center of the area to collect the coins, and you'll collect the Wonder Seed to disable the course Wonder Effects.\n\nThe first Wonder Seed in this course can be found in the same area as the third Flower Coin. After avoiding the rolling spike balls, use the bubbles to bounce toward the right. Once on the center platform, wait for the birds to shoot out fresh bubbles, then bounce off the bubbles to reach the platform housing your Wonder Seed.\n\nTo collect the first Wonder Seed, sprint past the parade of large Piranha Plants while avoiding the barrage of Bullet Bills. When you reach the end of the musical number, three multicolored Warp Pipes will appear to reward you with a Wonder Seed.\n\nThe first Wonder Seed can be found shortly after collecting the third Flower Coin in this course. Once you've secured the Flower Coin, continue advancing, grab a falling Super Star, and sprint ahead to make the most of your limited invulnerability. When you reach the end of the path, you'll be rewarded with this Wonder Seed."
