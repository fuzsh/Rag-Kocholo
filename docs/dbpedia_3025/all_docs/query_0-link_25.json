Breath…\n\nWhat are the best free techniques that everyone can use to share free love when they feel good and also to use to stop feeling bad (break negative cycles)? EG give anyone a free hug at any time and say pass it forward many times (why not pick them up and slowly swing them round or do a team hug:)\n\nWhat are the best gifts that we can all give at no cost to help everyone remind themselves to relax and love everyone?

Eg should everyone (not create startups/organisations/government as organisations are innert…) do what we all love and give it away asking for donations to cover their living costs… (if you like this pass it forward by helping many others and donate at www.webiversity.org plus get free money below!)\n\n1. Can we all help enhance (and also fund if needed) your work/passion/love with responsible accountable selfless open crowdsourcing & crowdfunding? Or even better help everyone crowdsource & crowdfund everything selflessly by saving the 90-99% of failed startups/ideas/conversations such as www.drumbeat.org by running them a open source charities at zero cost (with volunteers…) as they can serve invaluable public services free eg by partnering with www.mozilla.org www.wikipedia.org …\n\nDo take a few seconds to read these few sentances as they are a free way to enhance any idea/project/startup…\n\n2. How best to help everyone automatically set up their own crowdfunding platform as an open source decentralised charity as by donating the profits to innovative projects not only do we all save (our) lives with every pound/dollar/bitcoin… but also gain more interest/collaboration from the selfless and open source communities and therefore more success which means (counter intuatively) everyone gets richer with higher performance pay from a successful company than nothing from a (tech sartups have a 90-99% failure rate) highly probable failed company.\n\nAlso anyone can copy it using others free software if you dont and all big orgs will copy and scsle as that is what they do best.
