        "text": "Species of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae\n\nThis article is about common species Borago officinalis. For related plants sometimes called borage, see Borago\n\nBorage Borage flowers Scientific classification Kingdom: Plantae Clade: Tracheophytes Clade: Angiosperms Clade: Eudicots Clade: Asterids Order: Boraginales Family: Boraginaceae Genus: Borago Species:\n\nB. officinalis\n\nBinomial name Borago officinalis\n\nSynonyms[1]\n\nSynonyms\n\nBorago advena Gilib.\n\nBorago aspera Gilib.\n\nBorago hortensis L.\n\nBorage ([2] or ;[3] Borago officinalis), also known as starflower, is an annual herb in the flowering plant family Boraginaceae native to the Mediterranean region. Although the plant contains small amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, some parts are edible and its seeds provide oil.\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nB. officinalis grows to a height of 60–100 centimetres (2–3+1⁄2 feet), and is bristly or hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and 5–15 cm (2–6 inches) long.\n\nThe flowers are complete, perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue, although pink flowers are sometimes observed. White-flowered types are also cultivated. The blue flower is genetically dominant over the white flower.[4]\n\nThe flowers arise along scorpioid cymes to form large floral displays with multiple flowers blooming simultaneously, suggesting that borage has a high degree of geitonogamy (intraplant pollination).[4]\n\nIt has an indeterminate growth habit, which may lead to prolific spreading. In temperate climates such as in the UK, its flowering season is relatively long, from June to September. In milder climates, borage blooms continuously for most of the year.\n\nChemistry\n\n[edit]\n\nThe seeds consist of 26–38% borage seed oil, of which 17–28% is gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, an Omega-6 oil), the richest-known source.[5]\n\nThe oil also contains the fatty acids palmitic acid (10–11%), stearic acid (3.5–4.5%), oleic acid (16–20%), linoleic acid (35–38%), eicosenoic acid (3.5–5.5%), erucic acid (1.5–3.5%), and nervonic acid (1.5%).\n\nThe oil is often marketed as \"starflower oil\" or \"borage oil\" for use as a GLA supplement, although healthy adults typically produce ample GLA from dietary linoleic acid.\n\nThe leaves contain small amounts (2–10 ppm of dried herb) of the liver-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) intermedine, lycopsamine, amabiline, and supinine and the nontoxic saturated PA thesinine.[6] PAs are also present in borage seed oil, but may be removed by processing.[7][8][9][10][11][12]\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\n[edit]\n\nIt is native to the Mediterranean region, and has naturalized in many other locales.[13] It grows satisfactorily in gardens in most of Europe, such as Denmark, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, remaining in the garden from year to year by self-seeding.\n\nToxicity\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to the liver-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in the leaves and seed oil, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has advised that honey from borage contains PAs, transferred to the honey through pollen collected at borage plants, and advise that commercial honey production could select for raw honey with limited PA content to prevent contamination.[14]\n\nUses\n\n[edit]\n\nTraditionally, borage was cultivated for culinary and medicinal uses, although today, commercial cultivation is mainly as an oilseed.\n\nBorage is used as either a fresh vegetable or a dried herb. As a fresh vegetable, borage, with a cucumber-like taste, is often used in salads or as a garnish.[15]\n\nThe flower has a sweet, honey-like taste and is often used to decorate desserts and cocktails,[15] sometimes frozen in ice cubes.[16]\n\nVegetable use of borage is common in Germany, in the Spanish regions of Aragón and Navarre, on the Greek island of Crete, and in the northern Italian region of Liguria.\n\nAlthough often used in soups, one of the better known German borage recipes is the Frankfurt speciality grüne Soße (\"green sauce\").\n\nIn Liguria, Italy, borage (in Italian, borragine) is commonly used as a filling of the traditional pasta ravioli and pansoti.[17]\n\nIt is used to flavour pickled gherkins in Poland[18] and Russia.[19]\n\nThe flowers produce copious nectar[20] which is used by honeybees to make a light and delicate honey.[21]\n\nBeverage\n\n[edit]\n\nBorage is traditionally used as a garnish in the Pimms Cup cocktail,[15] but is nowadays often replaced by a long sliver of cucumber peel or by mint. It is also one of the key botanicals in Gilpin's Westmorland Extra Dry Gin.\n\nIn Persian cuisine, borage tea (using the dried purple flowers) is called گل گاوزبان : gol gâvzabân, \"cow's-tongue-flower\".[22]\n\nHerbal medicine\n\n[edit]\n\nTraditionally, Borago officinalis has been used in hyperactive gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders,[23] such as gastrointestinal (colic, cramps, diarrhea), airways (asthma, bronchitis), cardiovascular, (cardiotonic, antihypertensive and blood purifier), urinary (diuretic and kidney/bladder disorders).[24]\n\nOne case of status epilepticus has been reported that was associated with borage oil ingestion.[25]\n\nA methanol extract of borage has shown strong amoebicidal activity in vitro. The 50% inhibitory concentration (LD50) of the extract against Entamoeba histolytica was 33 μg/mLl.[26]\n\nCompanion planting\n\n[edit]\n\nBorage is used in companion planting.[27] It is said to protect or nurse legumes, spinach, brassicas, and even strawberries.[28] It is also said to be a good companion plant to tomatoes because it confuses the mother moths of tomato hornworms or manduca looking for a place to lay their eggs.[29] Claims that it improves tomato growth[30] and makes them taste better[29] remain unsubstantiated.\n\nIn culture\n\n[edit]\n\nPliny the Elder and Dioscorides said that borage was the nepenthe (νηπενθές : nēpenthés) mentioned in Homer, which caused forgetfulness when mixed with wine.[31]\n\nKing Henry VIII's last wife, Catherine Parr, used borage in a concoction to treat melancholy.[32]\n\nFrancis Bacon thought that borage had \"an excellent spirit to repress the fuliginous vapour of dusky melancholie\".[31]\n\nJohn Gerard's Herball mentions an old verse concerning the plant: \"Ego Borago, Gaudia semper ago (I, Borage, bring always joys)\". He asserts:\n\nThose of our time do use the flowers in salads to exhilerate and make the mind glad. There be also many things made of these used everywhere for the comfort of the heart, for the driving away of sorrow and increasing the joy of the mind. The leaves and flowers of Borage put into wine make men and women glad and merry and drive away all sadness, dullness and melancholy, as Dioscorides and Pliny affirm. Syrup made of the flowers of Borage comfort the heart, purge melancholy and quiet the frantic and lunatic person. The leaves eaten raw engender good blood, especially in those that have been lately sick.[31]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of companion plants\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nhttps://persianmama.com/chai-gol-gavzaban-brewed-borage-tea/\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.ca/pin/557179785128125722/"
