        "text": "Hybrid fish species\n\nPumpkinseed x bluegill sunfish Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Actinopterygii Order: Perciformes Family: Centrarchidae Subfamily: Lepominae Genus: Lepomis Species:\n\nThe pumpkinseed x bluegill sunfish[1] (Lepomis gibbosus x macrochirus), sometimes referred to as hybrid sunfish or pumpkingill,[citation needed] is a hybrid between a pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and a bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus).[2] They are sometimes found in lakes and ponds where both parent species are present.[2]\n\nDescription\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile the appearance of a pumpkinseed x bluegill sunfish can vary between individuals, they usually share a combination of traits from both parent species.[2]\n\nColoration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe colors can differ from bright greens and oranges to darker greens and browns. They usually have dark orange or brown spots, chain-like stripes, or most often a combination of both. The ventral side of this hybrid ranges from yellow to dark orange. The main body color is often a combination green and light blue. The blue fades into green dorsally. The opercular flap has a black spot on it with and orange rim running along its edge.[2] The orange rim can sometimes be light and even pinkish in color. Though in some cases it can be more red like a pumpkinseed. The face of pumpkingills have faded and less prominent blue streaking on its head compared to its pumpkinseed parent.[2]\n\nThe median fins are usually mottled.[2] The fins on this fish are usually dark in color with faint white rims on the median fins.[2]\n\nRange\n\n[edit]\n\nThese hybrids have been found mostly in the North Eastern and great lakes region of the United States. In states such as Connecticut they are the most common type of lepomid hybrid.[3]\n\nDiet\n\n[edit]\n\nThey mostly eat things the parent species eat. That includes stuff such as worms, insects, small crayfish, and small fish."
