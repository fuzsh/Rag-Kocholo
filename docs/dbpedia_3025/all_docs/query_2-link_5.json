        "text": "Never really did reviews for shows before, but I think this one does deserve one.\n\n\"Blue Seed\", for those who don't know, is a 26 episode tale of....well, it's difficult to pine down a genre for this show since it incorperates so many! We've got kick-butt action, sentimental romance, insane comedy, government dealings (and double dealings), an environmental message, strange mystisicm and ancient history, powerful monsters....heck, this show has everything you can find in an anime except giant robots! (but luckily it doesn't need that) The basic idea of the show involves a girl, Fujimiya Momiji, who is connected to a sacrifice ritual and a power that goes back thousands of years in Japanese history connected to the legend of Susano-oh, the Princess Kushinada, and the mysterious monster Orochi. Eventually, she finds herself fighting against monsters (many of which are connected to Japanese legends) alongside a group within the Japanese government called the TAC, who is trying to stop the monsters (er, the Aragami) for the safety of Japan. And then there is Kusanagi Mamoru, a humanoid \"plant-guy\" whose sworn duty in life is to protect the Kushinada. (although he does fall for her, not to mention an obsession with looking at her panties!) Slowly, though, the plot eventually entangles the Susano-oh of legend being not all that he seems, not to mention a mysterious twin sister of Momiji who was the \"previous\" Kushinada and wants to create this series' version of Instrumentality (using the Eva terminology) by turning Japan green again in order to \"protect\" what once was!\n\nI guess going into this series from what I had heard (and from how ADV had been promoting it on some places), I guess I expected some sort of insane/scary horror-type anime. But instead, I was awfully surprised at how good this show really was, not to mention how much the various genres seem to go well together as the series progresses. Of course, one of the things this show is known for the most is its action, and it doesn't dissapoint with that level. Whenever Kusanagi goes to fight, you know you are in for a ride (especially his several fights with main rival Murakumo), not to mention Kome's little gun fetish! (in a sarcastic way) On the romantic side, we do get the slowly developing relationship between Momiji and Kusanagi as the show progresses....which while good for the most part, does go a little too much on the sappy side at times. But they are not the only ones whose feelings develop as the series progresses: TAC chief Kunikida and his second-hand woman Takeuchi seem to develop something as it goes along, not to mention reserved workaholic Yaegashi (whom I definately related to with his ethics...not to mention his perversions and \"unrequited love\") and Kome. Comedy was pretty well used as well, mostly as a developmental tool early on but still a couple of places here and there as the show gets more serious towards the end. One of the best characters in this department is \"faith healer\" Sakura, a weird combination of a Japanese girl who works alongside the TAC even though she was adopted and trained by the US Government. It seems like every time she talks in that weird Japanese/English combination, I can't help but smile. Another one of the great things about this show was how realistic (in a fantasy way) they tried to make the Japanese government here, with the evolution of how to handle the Aragami situation slowly being pondered out and negotiated as things go from bad to worse. And, of course, with everything going on, there is also time to create a big environmental message to the series, using some ideas that would become a bit more \"well known\" in other, later anime series such as Eva. Even though the arguement got a tad confusing at times, it pretty much tries to find a balance between whether humanity can or can not save the natural balance of Japan and this planet while connecting it to the ancient, more natural-based, rituals such as the situations between Kaede and Susano-oh. (although part of the reason I suspected Kaede wanted to do this is due to the lonliness and ignorance she had recieved just because she is the Kushinada, thus by \"Instrumentality\", it would be one part revenge, one part restoring Japan, and one part relieving her lonely feelings)\n\nWith everything going on in all of these departments, the characters shine about in each of their own ways. Momiji goes from a girl who is slightly aware of her own destiny at the start of the series to one who is willing to sacrifice everything in order to protect Japan, as well as Kaede, from the actions brought about. But through all of this, she is able to keep her innocent, somewhat child-like nature. She is probably one of the best Megumi Hayashibara characters I have ever seen her act. (and I usually don't like her since Megumi is a tad overrated to me) Kusanagi is just one of the great anime heros, trying to do what is right for the sake of himself and for the sake of both Kushinadas, even if he is a tad brash about it. Everyone in the TAC also finds a sympathetic nature and grows throughout the series to adapt and stand by their own character, from the noble Kunikida and just Takeuchi to the brash Kome, calm Matsuridaira, honest Yaegashi, impulsive Sakura...even the quiet Kaede.\n\nI guess I can say that this anime is probably one of the most fun and fufilling I have had watching an anime in a while. While I do have a couple minor problems to it (while Murakumo is somewhat developed, they could have done a bit more to develop his character; they could have done a bit more explanation over Susano-oh), it was a great show. I may buy \"Blue Seed\" for myself eventually (I actually watched it by borrowing it from a friend), but I know it will be a good purchase. If you like an anime with a little something for everyone, this could be for you!\n\nBTW: I didn't mention it in my review, but the Omake stuff (well, some of them) are some of the funniest things in the whole show! (especially the Kusanagi/Murakumo \"mah jongg\" match, Susano-oh's \"king of the beasts\" bit, and the \"giant monster\" movie trailer) Of the not-so-funny ones, I also though the Kome one was rather sweet.\n\nDianaGohan said:\n\nNote: You missed a couple of the Great Omaki Theatres. One is where Kunkida is taking a bath but Momiji uses up nearly all the hot water before he can. (\"Boom shaka laka, a wompa bam bo. No, child abuse is wrong\"). Even thinking about it makes me laugh, as does the one where Momiji becomes a Sailor Moon Ripoff.\n\nActually, the one with Kunikida getting ready for his day is OK, but a tad scary to me. (well, I am male) But I did forget about \"What would happen if Momiji DID become an idol?\"...for both the punchline and Yaegashi's \"mistake\". (well, it did relate to his program in ep. 6)\n\nMight as well review all 13 Omake while I am at it:\n\n-1: Great in seeing Kusanagi \"watch\" Kaede and the TAC, but got a tad scary when Kunikida showed up.\n\n-2: Good outakes reel, although I thought the \"funny joke\" strategy reminded me of Monty Python's \"funniest joke in the world\" bit.\n\n-3: OK...if only because we sort of see anime characters for once note on how their world is animated to fit themselves.\n\n-4: As I said, really good for seeing Momiji/Megumi act like herself and Yaegashi's perversions coming through again.\n\n-5: OK...somewhat cute...if only to hear Momiji hum the closing theme.\n\n-6: One of the best! Mah Jong will never be the same after what Kusanagi and Murakumo do to it\n\n-7: One of the better of the sentimental ones, partially because I like Kome...\n\n-8: As I said above, OK, but a tad scary...\n\n-9: You know, I actually thought this was about Takeuchi when I was watching this for the first (and only) time until the emphasis on Sugishita comes out at the end...but then he does have a crush on her!\n\n-10: Another of my favorite, if only because Mother Nature finally gets its revenge on Susano-oh.\n\n-11: Yet another classic: pretty much transforming 26 episodes into a giant insane \"giant-monster movie\" parody. Besides, this is one of the few Omake Sakura shows up in....\n\n-12: Eeeeww....scary! Keep me away! Evil! (yes, this is the one with Momiji's grandma)\n\n-13: Things finally come full circle both in the anime and the omake...and yet again Kunikida and Kusanagi try to be disturbing once more before the anime ends. (not to mention more \"unrealistic\" Momiji fanservice)"
