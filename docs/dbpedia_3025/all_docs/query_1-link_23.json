The best way I can pay it forward is by passing a baton of wisdom from lessons I have learned so that others can build on them.\n\nIn my experience and estimation, intrapreneurship is neither easier nor harder than entrepreneurship. They are just different. Both require pitch presentations, but entrepreneurship can quickly turn into a continuous search for new, outside money. This can be difficult depending on the cyclical appetite of investors. On the other hand, outside funding should be be more risk tolerant once it is secured.\n\nFor better and worse, true entrepreneurs are often more singular in their missions. Think Tesla: “to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.” When everybody in the organization sinks or swims together, it is easy to pull on the same end of the rope.\n\nThe mission for intrapreneurs will likely be more nuanced. Even the most clever entity strategies will create competition for talent and resources...nevermind the pitfalls of trying to disrupt yourself. Avoiding all the ways large organizations accidentally eat their young can be a daunting and isolating task. This is especially true when 110% focus is required to develop new products, business models, and markets.\n\nI know “disruptive innovation” has become cliché and there are numerous TED talks and other presentations on the topic, but there is no better read to prime your thinking. The examples in the book are dated, but the underlying lessons are timeless.\n\nThis book is not focused solely on innovation, but the concepts are essential to creating a culture that is open to “challenger safety” where new ideas can come to life. This may also cause you to rethink your legacy recruiting, measurement, and incentive systems so smart people will want to work on your innovation team. Honestly, it’s a great read whether you’re working on innovation or not.\n\nOnce we got started, I wanted to share my experiences with people, but almost nobody could relate to them. It was like I was speaking another language. So for me, this book was one part entertaining and one part therapy. The insider perspective of the vision and personal commitment required by Steve Jobs and Tony Fadell to birth the iPod from within an organization built around selling Mac computers is arguably the best case study of self-disruption in history.\n\nIn the end, I learned a ton and am forever grateful for the opportunity to breathe life into a few new ideas that will create a better experience for future boaters. I could not agree more with Theodore Roosevelt’s “Citizen in a Republic” speech (aka “The Man in the Arena”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic). I applaud all of those who have gotten out of their comfort zone to try something new. I believe you will be better for it. I will always do my best to pay it forward as a sounding board for anybody who finds themselves in the strange and interesting waters of innovation and just needs someone to listen."
