        "text": "1964 picture book by Rieko Nakagawa\n\nSora Iro no Tane (そらいろのたね, lit. The Sky-Colored Seed or The Blue Seed) is a 1964 Japanese children's picture book by Rieko Nakagawa and illustrated by Yuriko Ōmura. It was serialized by Fukuin Kanshoten in their Kodomo no Tomo (こどものとも) magazine in 1964, and then published as a book in 1967. Since being published in the magazine, it has been in continuous publication and had sold over a 1.7 million copies in Japan by 2010.[1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nOne day, a young boy named Yuuji was playing with his favorite model airplane when a fox asked him to trade the airplane for the fox's treasured \"blue seed\". Yuuji planted the seed in his garden and watered it. The next morning, it had grown into a small toy-like blue house. Yuuji chanted, \"Grow bigger!\" while continuing to take care of it. Before long, it had grown bigger and a small chick started living in it, saying, \"This is my house!\"\n\nThe house continued growing bigger and bigger. A cat and a pig took up residence there as well. Yuuji's friends all came over and had a great time in the house. Soon, all kinds of forest animals and neighborhood kids came to the house as it grew larger and larger. When the house had grown really large, the fox came by and was astonished at how large the house had grown. He told Yuuji he would like to return the model airplane and take back the house. So, all the animals and children in the house left.\n\nThe fox entered the house by himself and quickly locked all the doors and windows. Yuuji said, \"Oh no! The sun is going to crash into the house!\" The sun did just that, causing the house to crumble and disappear. After that, the fox collapsed in a faint where the seed had been planted.\n\nPublication\n\n[edit]\n\nSora Iro no Tane was originally published in the children's magazine Kodomo no Tomo (こどものとも) in 1964 by Fukuin Kanshoten.
