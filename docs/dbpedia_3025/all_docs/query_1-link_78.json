        "text": "2011 American film\n\nBitter SeedsDirected byMicha PeledWritten byMicha PeledProduced byMicha PeledDistributed byITVS\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n88 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglish\n\nBitter Seeds is a 2011 documentary film by American filmmaker and director and political commentator Micha Peled. The film is the third part of Peled's globalization trilogy after Store Wars: When Wal-Mart Comes to Town (2001)[1] and China Blue (2005).\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nMicha Peled's documentary on biotech (Bt) farming in India observes the impact of genetically modified cotton on India's farmers, with a suicide rate of over a quarter million Bt cotton farmers each year due to financial stress resulting from massive crop failure and the price of Monsanto's Bt seeds. The film also disputes claims by the biotech industry that Bt cotton requires less pesticide and promises of higher yields, as farmers discover that Bt cotton requires more pesticide than organic cotton, and often suffer higher levels of infestation by Mealybug resulting in devastating crop losses, and financial and psychological stress on cotton farmers. Due to the biotech seed monopoly in India, where Bt cotton seed has become the standard, and organic seed has become unobtainable, thus pressuring cotton farmers into signing Bt cotton seed purchase agreements with biotech multinational corporation Monsanto.[2]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nLeslie Hassler in the Huffington Post called Bitter Seeds riveting and poignant, though in places incredibly painful to watch.[3]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nThe documentary has won 18 international film awards,[3] including the Green Screen Award (2011)[4] and the Oxfam Global Justice Award (2011).[4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
