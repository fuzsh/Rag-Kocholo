        "text": "See other formats\n\nHi. I go by the alias name Karm. I like to work on different projects like this one. If you like females especially animated ones than you have found the right source to get your information. This book is actually a follow up to the one I previously did. You can find the link for it below plus other works I have done. This one actually focuses more on animated series rather than just video games. I mostly used Wikipedia for the information (a BIG thanks to that site, I also donated to them recently since I use it so much) and left links to all the pages at the end of this book. All of the images used were from many random sites, a BIG thank you to them as well. I guess I made this book because well first there was that other one and I missed out on a ton of anime for that time due to lack of funds and just general access. Nowadays you can find most of these just about everywhere online, some of it is even decent priced to own on DVD's. Art books for this kind of stuff are also my favorite, probably another reason why I made this. I have not seen every single anime on here yet but I am sure that the information should be as correct as it can possibly be. The covers for some of the VHS, DVDs, etc., I was unsure about but did my best to explain some of them. So hopefully you enjoy this piece I have worked on for months and find something that maybe you missed out on or are interested in viewing. Enjoy!

She is a beautiful Oni alien who is capable of flying and generating electrical shocks and even lightning (resembling the thunder oni Raijin; one time Ataru dreamed of Lum wearing the same drums on her back as Raijin). She is extremely popular and is famous for ending her sentences with ~daccha (loosely translated as \"yes?\" or \"you know?\"). Except when in her schoolgirl uniform, human-style street clothes (consisting of jeans, sneakers, and a tee-shirt with a jacket), or a swimsuit, she usually wears her standard outfit consisting of a tiger-striped bikini and knee-high go-go boots (of which she has only one). While generally good-natured, sweet, faithful, and innocent, Lum also has a very hot temper. Her dream in life is to live in a \"Sweet Home with Darling\", in which she keeps house and raises the children, while Ataru, her \"Darling\", works a job. Unfortunately, this plan has some problems, such as how Lum's idea of \"cooking\" is to take very spicy ingredients like jalapenos, cayenne peppers, and Tabasco sauce and irradiate them with an alien energy bazooka until they carbonize into inedible, crystallized nuggets (although it doesn't seem to bother all non-earth-based life). As an alien she has access to many bizarre gadgets whose use she doesn't always understand completely, leading to comic results. 1 dr Jk C& Nuku Nuku Series: All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku (OVA - 6 epiosodes) Plot: The plot generally focuses on the custody battle for Ryunosuke and the attempts by Akiko and Mishima Heavy Industries to reclaim Nuku Nuku's body, which often involves amusingly larger-than-life battles between Nuku Nuku and military hardware produced by Mishima Heavy Industries. Two episodes also deal with a one-sided war between Nuku Nuku and another android named Eimi, who suffers from an over-the-top inferiority complex and envies Nuku Nuku's more stable design. As it stands, Eimi was made after her and seeks to transfer her programming into Nuku Nuku to ditch her own body, which Akiko calls \"a piece of junk.\" In spite of Eimi being more emotionally unstable than Nuku Nuku, both their fights end in a draw.

This prompts the high priest to ask his daughter to awaken Dark Schneider, a wizard and former leader of the Riders, from within the body of 14-year-old Luche Renren. Bastard M's history is about sorcery, revenge, and other power struggles in a Dungeons & Dragons-like world. It is a dystopian world, where people need magic to survive against wild beasts, and evil monsters. There are four kingdoms, each one the protector of one of the four seals that keep the God of Destruction in stasis. While the first half of the manga follows most a theme similar to Dungeons & Dragons scenarios, it later also focuses on aspects such as beliefs, morals and religions. Characters: Tia Noto Yoko & Thunder Empress Arshes Nei - !! Images below: US VHS, US DVD Series: Hime-chan's Ribbon (Series - 61 episodes) Plot: The story is about Himeko Nonohara (SJ^Jf^SS-F* Nonohara Himeko), also known as Hime-chan (Â®t>^ Ay), an aloof, childlike, yet boasty fourteen-year-old girl who frets over the fact that she is the biggest tomboy in the school. Himeko would like nothing more than to be a proper, feminine young lady, like her older sister Aiko, so that she could approach her secret crush, Hasekura. One night, Himeko is unexpectedly approached by a girl, who is a near-mirror image of herself, floating outside of her bedroom window. She discovers that the girl is Princess Erika of the Magical Kingdom. Erika explains that people in the Magical Kingdom have an exact counterpart in the Human World and that, in order to prove herself worthy as a princess, she must give Himeko a magical item that she has created. Himeko is allowed the use of this item, a red hair ribbon, for one year to determine whether it is useful, and consequently, if Erika will inherit the crown. The ribbon allows Himeko to transform into anyone in the Human World for one hour. If Himeko is unable to recite the magic incantation in reverse before the hour is up, she will be trapped in that person's form for the rest of her life. She is unable to reveal the secret of the ribbon and the existence of the Magical Kingdom to anyone. If she does, her memory will be erased as punishment. Assisting her with this is her stuffed lion, Pokota, whom the ribbon brought to life. Erika will watch her in the Magic Kingdom through her crystal ball for one year, at which point the ribbon will be returned.

Exploits constantly see prestigious family males trying to take Jun's virginity and buy into the Asuka estate. Note: The OVA series was also released in the US.

They are typically of the style of John Dickson Carr, and frequently feature a locked room mystery[6] or other seemingly \"impossible\" crimes, such as a murder occurring when all surviving suspects have (apparently) airtight alibis. A notable distinction of The Kindaichi Case Files is that the killers are not depicted as psychopathic murderers and the murders are never committed for financial reasons alone. The identified killers all have deep rooted problems, often involving great emotional trauma through the greed or thoughtlessness of others, as their reasons for committing the murder(s). Thus the killers are often portrayed as sympathetic figures, as opposed to cold, calculating killers in some other mystery series.
