Please take the time to know us all better and register.\n\nI received seeds of Pinanga \"blue fruit\" from Mike's garden in Puerto Rico in September 2010. His original plant was from Floribunda, who still have them listed as \"blue seed\". I had five sprouts. Somehow, I lost all but one which I planted in May 2015. Here is what it looks like today. It hasn't grown particularly large, but has many stems.\n\nI imagine this is the same as sold in Australia. I have seen it in seed and very pretty. Easy grow in Brisbane. Has a blush in the new frond and mottled esp suckers. Mine is trying to flower\n\nDoesn't seem to clump as much and more pinnate. Depends if you're a lumper or a splitter I suppose. Tip of ctown 1.2m\n\nSteve\n\nSome fruit were developing last year, but they were yellow. But this spring, the fruits turned metallic blue (on bright red rachillae), just like the pictures I have seen on the web. Here is a picture of my blue fruits, taken just yesterday. The only info I can find on them is from the RPS site, which just says that they are from Sarawak. If RPS is a source of the seeds, a palm colleague in Florida/Puerto Rico fought some plants from Floribunda, which probably got the seeds from RPS, and when they produced fruit, they sent some to me. So my plant might be a third generation from an original set of seeds. Since the appearance (leaves and seeds) seem to have remained the same for several generations, this would seem to me to indicate that this is a real species, and not a hybrid (with adangensis, as has been suggested). Any opinions, anyone?\n\nEdited June 24, 2021 by mike in kurtistown\n\nadded more info"
