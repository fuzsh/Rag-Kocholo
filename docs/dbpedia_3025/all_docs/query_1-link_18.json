        "text": "Basics of Botany\n\nHydroponics and the Botanists who work there are important to the station, especially on longer rounds. Botanists grow plants that the Chef can use for food. Without botany, the food choices will be limited.\n\nLatest video tutorial can be found here (made in May, 2020).\n\nYour Area\n\nHydroponics is divided into two rooms. The big section is where you'll spend most of your time growing goods. Trays are available where you grow plants and two vending machines, one with seeds and the other with miscellaneous items such as nutrients and tools for your job. The bio-generator can be used to grind plants and produce things for the station. In tandem is the seed dispenser used to reproduce your product. The northern area is where you can grab most of the equipment needed to work in botany.\n\nPlants require nutrients (fertilizer) and water to grow. They are also bothered by pests and weeds.\n\nTrays come equipped with alerts that flash specific colors to tell you what's happening with your plant.\n\nFrom left to right -\n\nGreen: Ready to harvest.\n\nRed: Low health, caused by toxins/lack of nutrients/low water/end of lifespan.\n\nRed (middle): High weed, pest or toxicity levels.\n\nYellow: Low nutrients.\n\nBlue: Low water.\n\nTools that are of use in botany -\n\nPlant Analyzer: Ordinary left-click. It doesn't matter if Combat Mode Enable with 4, disable with 1 or toggle with F by default. Left-clicking people with an empty hand will Harm them if on, or Help them if off. Prevents you from switching places or being pushed when colliding with people. is on or not. Shows detailed plant statistics. Ordinary right-click. It doesn't matter if Combat Mode Enable with 4, disable with 1 or toggle with F by default. Left-clicking people with an empty hand will Harm them if on, or Help them if off. Prevents you from switching places or being pushed when colliding with people. is on or not. Shows plant and tray chemical contents and production traits. (also works on crops)\n\nCultivator: Kills Weeds.\n\nPlant Bag: Collects up to 50 items or 100 seeds from your harvest. Useful for moving those into the fridge or biogenerator.\n\nWrench: Used to move your trays around.\n\nHatchet: Chops tower-caps into planks, chops other things. This is also a robust tool that fits in pockets.\n\nShovel: Digs up grass floors and cleans the dirt.\n\nSpade: Removes and destroys plants in a tray.\n\nSecateurs: Can be used on a fully grown and harvest-able plant once to obtain a plant graft.\n\nAll-In-One Grinder: This is how you extract reagents from plants - throw them in and hit the \"grind\" button.\n\nPortable Seed Extractor: This can harvest and pick up plants and turn up to 100 plants into seeds. Less efficient than the machine.\n\nTools that require techs for use in botany -\n\nFloral Somatoray: A gun that requires the botany tech in order to produce. It has 3 modes, which can increase plant yields, mutate a plant's stats, or mutate a plant's species. With a full charge, using it on a tray in close range can limit its mutations to a single product, but requires at least 20 plant endurance.\n\nBotanogenetic Shears: A tool that requires the Experimental Tools tech. These can remove a gene, chemical, or trait from a plant when used on a tray, but the plant must have a plant health or endurance higher than 15.\n\nPlant growing 101\n\nTake some seeds from the vendor and put them into the trays. Now, take a look at the tray with a plant analyzer. For now, you only need to pay attention to the bottom five stats - Water/Nutrition and Weeds/Toxic/Pest levels.\n\nNow, fill a bucket from the water tank and grab fertilizer from the vending machine. You get rid of weeds with the cultivator and remove pests with pest spray. Chemistry can give you better chemicals for this, which will be explained later in the guide.\n\nSome plants have a varied growth times, such as wheat growing faster while watermelons or apple trees take a little longer before you can harvest from them.\n\nOnce your tray flashes green, you're set to harvest. If you want to replicate the plant to continue growing more, just insert it into the seed extractor.\n\nYou can click seeds with a pen to change the name of the plant, the seed's description, or the plant's description. After planting in a hydroponics tray the tray updates with the name and description of the plant inside it.\n\nBiogenerator\n\nThe Biogenerator makes items out of the nutriment in plants. As a rule of thumb: More nutriment = more biomass. Watermelons and pumpkins are commonly used due to their 20% nutriment boost trait.\n\nTo get biomass, grab a spare bucket and equip the machine with it, then use the plant bag to put fruits inside.\n\nIf you somehow run out of fertilizer in the vendors, remember you can produce more here. Reagents produced will be poured into the inserted bucket. You can also craft a whole bunch of useful items from the leather/cloth sheets the biogenerator can create.\n\nStats, reagents and traits\n\nThree things determine how your plant will turn out: Their stats, reagents and traits.\n\nStats\n\nStats determine whether your plants are small and grow slowly, or are big and fast-growing.\n\nReagents/Content\n\nThis determines what chemicals are present in a grown plant - New reagents can be transferred between plants with the use of cross-pollination, while reagents can be removed with botanogenetic shears..\n\nWith a bit of creativity, you can mix your own mutagen, produce unique healing chemicals or turn tomatoes into napalm grenades. Solid Chemistry knowledge will help you out immensely.\n\nFor a detailed list, check out: Plant reference chart\n\n\"Fragile\" chemicals are unable to be removed via gene shears, but can be cross-pollinated (or even grafted in some cases) like normal chemical genes.\n\nTraits\n\nTraits give your plants unique properties. There are plenty - Perennial Growth, for example, lets you harvest plants multiple times.\n\nThese can be transferred, just like reagents.\n\n\"Immutable\" traits are unable to be removed via gene shears or grafted from any plant.\n\nLikewise, \"Essential\" traits are unable to be removed via shears, but can be grafted in some cases.\n\nPlants can also have core plant traits. These are irremovable traits that cannot be randomly mutated, but affects how that plant acts at its core.\n\nMany of these traits require 'plant protection' to be picked up and used safely. Plant protection can be gained by using proper leather botanical gloves or a hardsuit / biosuit. Podpeople naturally have plant protection, as well.\n\nDiscovery Value\n\nSome unusual plants can have a Discovery Value in their stats, which means their seeds can be sent via the cargo shuttle to be categorized by Centcom. If you can improve upon the plant's potency and send another seed packet, Centcom will reward you handsomely. Remember to send a low potency version first and then the high potency seed on a second trip, gotta show the big boss you are working hard on those vegetables!\n\nThis process has a bit of price inelastic/quantity elastic, only need to export a few samples, Centcom doesn't need 200 packets of bluespace tomatoes!\n\nTIP: Some plants have 3 levels of mutations, the third one usually has a higher Discovery Value.\n\nPlant reference chart\n\nAll you need to know about plants - their reagents, traits and what they can mutate into.\n\nTraits that can be copied with GRAFTING are underlined. If a plant does not have an underlined trait, it will default to Perennial Growth, even if the plant traditionally does not have it by default.\n\nChemicals\n\nA lot of chemicals influence plants when in their trays or dirt piles.\n\nSome reagent effects scale with amount of units stored in the hydroponics tray's or dirt pile's container. This means using more units can cause faster stat changes. These are listed per unit.\n\nReagents with random stat changes will have their average (avg) effects listed. These typically do not scale with amount, and require at least 1 unit in the tray.\n\nEffects without randomness and without scaling are listed as a simple number. They need at least 1 unit in the tray to work.\n\nAll reagents count as \"nutrient\" for the dark yellow tray lights to go away.\n\nReagents will be consumed over time. Remember to refill.\n\nThe listed effects in this table happen (tick) about every 20 seconds.\n\nName How to get Description Potency Yield Production speed (lower is better) Health Instability Pests Weeds Toxicity E-Z-Nutrient Vendor or biogenerator Trays and dirt piles start with this fertilizer by default. 0.3 per unit 0.1 per unit 0.2 Left 4 Zed Vendor or biogenerator Raises instability but does little else.

Great stuff, and very useful even if you're no traitor!\n\nFor more info, click here for the guide on beepeeking.\n\nAdvanced Botany\n\nThis is where you get to PLAY GOD and mess with the stats, reagents and traits of plants.\n\nPlant Grafts\n\nOnce any plant has fully grown, it can now be grafted. Grafting a plant costs a small amount of plant health, but it will produce a plant graft. Plant grafts can be be scanned with a plant analyzer to keep track of what traits have been grafted off. Grafting a trait onto a plant freely integrates that trait into the plant. Plant grafts are always physical traits, and can only be grafted once for every instance of the plant grown.\n\nPlant grafts can also be used to average another plant's stats together. It will add 2/3rds of the difference between the two plants, or the graftee's stats, whichever is the higher of the two. This will affect the plant's Lifespan, Endurance, Production, Yield, Weed Production Rate, as well as Weed Vulnerability. This Grafting is good for health related stats and yield, but typically damaging for weed stats and plant production speed.\n\nCrosspollination\n\nCrosspollination is available for any two trays who have plants placed right next to each other (including diagonally). When any 2 plants are adjacent to each other, they will slowly average their potency, yield, and instability off into each other, at a rate of 1/10th of their difference every time the plant grows older (1/2 for yield), either upwards or downwards. This allows for using extra plants with high potency or yield to be planted next to plants with signifigantly lower starting stats, in order to either raise up, or drain off stats to where you would want them.\n\nIf trying to increase potency or yield, plants like watermelons or Tea Aspera are typically the best for this purpose. If trying to increase instability, Corn is one of the best for improving a plant's instability (In real life, corn was originally a kind of wheat grass, until it was crossbred for centuries into growing larger and larger wheat kernels, eventually growing into maize). The best plants to grow to decrease a plant's instability are any of the flowers, all with a natural instability of 1.\n\nWhen a plant has over 20 instability, it will begin to accept chemical traits from adjacent plants at random. As a result, this can mean that having plants meant for the chef, like wheat, tomatoes, etc. should be grown next to similar, stable plants if that's your goal. It can also enable you to create chemical mixes within plants, given enough time. Extra chemicals can be removed from a plant through the use of Gene Shears at the cost of health, so if planning to make pure chemical mixes through your plants, you should also plan on improving the plant's endurance to enable them to lose more unwanted chemicals like nutriment faster. A receiving plant can have a chemical production trait upgraded if a sender has the same production with higher percentage.\n\nCrosspollinating plants have a yellow particle effect over them.\n\nMutations\n\nMany plants can be mutated to change species, change stats or add random new traits or chemical traits.\n\nInstability\n\nFor each new threshold of instability in a plant, a different effect is added. These effects stack on each other.\n\nFor 0-19 instability, the plant will not be affected by mutations, and will not accept reagent genes from other plants. This is where you want your plant to be if you're happy with its current reagents/traits/stats, and you want to keep it that way.\n\nAt 20+ instability, the plant will casually mutate. Their stats will mutate up and down randomly over time, and can lead to very lopsided stats if left alone.\n\nAt 30+ instability, each of the plant's harvested produce has a chance to be a wild mutation, becoming the produce of one of the possible species mutations instead. The chance is (instability/3)%, so a minimum of 10% and maximum of 33~%. Wild mutations will carry over traits from the parent plant.\n\nAt 40+ instability, the plant will mutate much more strongly, and can result in a larger change in stats than the 20-39 range.\n\nAt 60+ instability, every time they age they have a chance to hard mutate into one of their possible species mutations. This chance is their (instability/2)%, so a minimum of 30% and a maximum of 50% every time the plant ages.\n\nAt 80-100 instability the plant will roll a 5-25% chance every time it ages to gain a new random trait or reagent, similar to what strange seeds can get. Starts at 5% chance at 80 instability and scales to 25% at 100 instability.\n\nThe agonizingly slow way to raise instability is using E-Z Nutriment to make the plant gain it at a static rate. Left 4 Zed is a faster alternative, which improves the plant's instability based on the amount of it within the tank!\n\nMutating with unstable mutagen\n\nYou can speed up the process by asking your local Chemist for a few bottles of Unstable Mutagen.\n\nHaving at least 1u mutagen in a tray has the following effects as of current, with odds and effects rolled every time the plant increases in age:\n\nA 50% chance to increase the plant's instability by 5, useful for statically increasing a plant's instability without the use of other reagents.\n\nA 10% chance to mutate weeds into their more dangerous counterparts.\n\nA 10% chance to mutate pests, and create spiders within the tray.\n\nA 10% chance to harm the plant inside, damaging the plant's health.\n\nDue to how the effects work, using mutagen on a plant tray should be used in combination with other reagents to produce the best results.\n\nFloral Somatoray\n\nR&D can also research a wonderful thing called a Floral Somatoray. It has three options: randomly increase yield, mutate the plant stats and force a species mutation.

This can be useful when mutating a plant, and whittling down their available reagents to what you need for crosspollination. Print it from the service techfab after research.\n\nFixing awful stats\n\nMutating plants has a chance of really ruining stats. Luckily, there are a few ways to fix them. Check the chemical table for the stats you want. Examples:\n\nSaltpetre. Increases potency and decreases production time.\n\nAmmonia. Increases yield.\n\nFloral Somatoray. Can increase yield and can randomize stats.\n\nDude weeds\n\nTrays, whether empty or occupied by plants, can be occasionally overtaken by a weed if their level is 5 or more. In that case the old plant is destroyed, and a new one will sprout in its place.\n\nPossible plants include:\n\n1/6 chance for Reishi/Starthistle.\n\n1/9 chance for Nettle/Harebell/Amanita/Chanterelle/Tower Cap/Plump Helmets\n\nHaving unstable mutagen in high weed level trays can result in different plants:\n\nKudzu, Deathnettle, Destroying Angel, Liberty Cap\n\nOther Notes\n\nAutogrow Mode\n\nOn any non-dirt tray, ctrl-clicking it will give it a golden shine, activating autogrow. Now it will generate its own water, self-tend weed/pest removal, and consume less nutrients if the tray is upgraded, but at the cost of a large amount of power. This is good for high maintenance plants that require a lot of tending if you need to leave botany for a few moments. Autogrow also prevents species mutations, but does not prevent stat/trait/chem mutations.\n\nThis is great in combination with plants that have the Perennial Growth trait, if you can manage the power drain!\n\nUpgraded trays can hold more nutrients, water, and will consume less nutrients every time chemicals are processed. This makes upgrades for individual trays much more valuable, especially when using difficult to produce chemicals.\n\nIf possible, growing glowcaps to power your APC can heavily offset the cost of using autogrow on a tray. You'll need a lot of power output in order to generate enough electricity to have all your trays on autogrow, so it's best to individually manage only 1-2 using this feature.\n\nAutomation with Plumbing\n\nPlumbing allows the creation of several systems to assist you in your work. For example:\n\nFeeding the trays reagents and possibly water, replacing the autogrow as long as there are reagents in input.\n\nCreating an automated grinding and/or filtering system for harvests.\n\nYou will need fluid ducts , a plumbing constructor , and potentially a plunger. Those can be found in the Chemistry Lab, or constructed on the medical Techfab. Alternatively, you may use Cytology (Science) equipment, if they're not using them.\n\nConnecting Trays\n\nHydroponics trays can be connected to plumbing pipe-networks and machinery.\n\nThe trays possess a pipe input facing southward, but you may rotate them by unwrenching the tray and alt-clicking it; simply remember to wrench it back in place. If you're using machinery, the red pipe is the input, while the blue one is the output.\n\nYou may add reagents to the pipe network using Inputs, fed manually using containers (beakers, bottles, ...). You may also produce some through plumbing machinery (e.g., synthesizers , grinders ) and link it to the network. A plumbing tank might be a useful addition.\n\nBeware that using a plumbing system may fill the reagent tanks to the maximum, disallowing you from manually and individually adding reagents. Since the pipe input leads to the trays' reagent tanks before being sorted out, adding water to the network is nearly guaranteed to provoke said 'clogs.'\n\nTo add water to the network, you may transform one of the water tanks into a plumbing-compatible one, using iron sheets, or use a synthesizer configured on water production.\n\n[to confirm] Note that the plumbing water tanks may suffer from a bug and not connect on the first wrenching attempt. Subsequent attempts should work, assuming the pipe output is oriented properly.\n\nReplica Pod Cloning\n\nReplica pods can be used to grow dead people back to life - even when their brain and head are missing.\n\nTo clone someone, follow these simple steps:\n\nTake a blood sample from the body using a syringe.\n\nInject it into the bag of seeds.\n\nPlant the seeds.\n\nLet the plant grow and then harvest it.\n\nIf the ghost of the corpse is still online, and did not turn on \"Do not Resuscitate\", that person will be cloned as a Podman.\n\nIf there was no ghost available, the resulting harvest will simply produce up to two new packs of seeds.\n\nThe podmen are a little different from normal humans. E.g. they regenerate in light but suffer in darkness and don't get attacked by bees or plants.\n\nCabbage can be mutated into Replica Pod.\n\nPer this PR, Podepeople can now have different chemicals for their blood. The chemical trait with the highest % will be their blood. If there are no chemical traits then their blood is water. While this may sound fun, you have to keep in mind that\n\nControlling the chemical traits on the replica pod to get your desired trait is a long and time consuming process, reliant on RNG and getting the botanical sheers.\n\nIts only one chem so no you cant make a mixture of potassium+water so everytime you bleed there is an explosion\n\nHaving omnizine blood sounds cool, but you are immune to the chemical that makes up your blood.\n\nBloodloss will be dangerous, as the only way to replenish it will be injecting more of the chemical into yourself or waiting to naturally regenerate it. If you're at 50% blood loss though its probably a death sentence.\n\nStrange Seeds\n\nStrange seeds (from hacked vendors or cargo crates) have completely random reagents and traits.\n\nNotable examples are:\n\nGaseous Decomposition\n\nNitroglycerin\n\nAny drink, like Gin Tonic or Beepsky Smash\n\nGlitter\n\nPlasmaman Mutation Toxin\n\nHell Water\n\nOf course, this is pretty gimmicky and unreliable.\n\nKudzu\n\nKudzu is a weed that can appear when having Unstable Mutagen in a tray with a weed level of 5 or above. The tray version of kudzu will grow normally in its tray. When harvested it will produce kudzu pods . The kudzu pod is like any other fruit/vegetable and can be eaten or ground. To create wild-spreading kudzu, you must put a kudzu pod into a seed extractor, which will create packs of kudzu seeds . Then activate a kudzu seed in your hand to start planting wild-spreading kudzu on the floor.\n\nSome plant stats will affect the wild-spreading version of kudzu in specific ways:\n\nPotency of the seed will make kudzu mutate more on spread. The chance to mutate on each new piece is [potency / 10].\n\nProduction speed will affect how fast the kudzu will spread. Better (lower) production speed stat speeds up the process. Production speed used to have inverse effect on kudzu spread until a fix in July, 2020. Fastest kudzu spread is now achievable with a production speed stat of 1.\n\nProduction speed also affects how far a single kudzu piece can spread, with production speed stat of 1 providing the largest range.\n\nSeverity points scale linearly based on potency (0 potency = 10 max severity, 50 potency = 17.5 max severity, 100 potency = 25 max severity) Event kudzu gets a +10 max severity bonus.\n\nKilling the last piece of kudzu will create a kudzu seed in its place with all the accumulated mutations saved in the seed. So if you reactivate it, the new kudzu on the floor will have all the same mutations the seed had, and will spread it to all its progenitors. You can examine a wild kudzu to see what mutations it has. Color is decided by the last mutation gained.\n\nKudzu traits have been significantly changed recently. There is now a maximum severity value which is [potency * 0.15 + 10]. Each mutation carries a severity, and you can only combine up to the severity limit. In addition, the Timid and Transparent traits can be used to create truly beneficial Kudzu. A chart with all the traits and mutations is also to the right.\n\nIn addition, Kudzu also stops spreading unless it has the Cold-proof mutation if the tile its on is under 100K in temperature, discouraging malicious actors from venting the area to space.\n\nNote on Aggressive Spread effect:\n\nFor non-carbons (silicons) it does 75 brute damage flat\n\nFor carbons (humans) picks a random bodypart and its armor to damage\n\n80% chance of doing 60 (sharp) brute damage and 2 seconds knockdown\n\n20% chance of doing 60 (non-sharp) brute damage, 3 seconds knockdown, and throwing player away from the vine\n\nIf vine has thorns, an additional 40% chance of doing 50% armour-piercing (point-wounds) 50 brute damage and 1 second stun\n\nSandstone and Soil\n\nIf you pick up the grass and use it (click on it in your hand), you will prepare astroturf. Get a crowbar and remove some floor tiles, then place astroturf in their place. In addition to looking nice, it can be used to get some sand. Just dig it with your spade and you'll get two piles. Now, pick up the sand and use it; you will make a sandstone brick. Using three bricks, you can make a soil plot, which is like a tray, except you can walk over it and there are no lights. You can also build a sandstone door with 10 bricks.\n\nScience can build hydroponics trays. They can also upgrade them by replacing the matter bins, and this increases the water and nutrient capacity of the tray.\n\nWood and Drying Racks\n\nFirst you need to get some tower-caps, grow them and harvest them. You can then use hatchet (and some other things, but it's not important) on the logs to chop some planks. They have many uses: you can make chairs, tables, wooden floors and so on. A unique thing here is a drying rack. You can use it to dry a plant, and then smoke it. First, build a rack with 10 planks. Then, grab a plant you want to dry and put it in the rack. Click on the rack and toggle drying so that the red arrows light up. Give it a few seconds and it's done.\n\nNote: you can dry any plant, and smoking it will give you all chemicals that were in it. You can smoke dried apples if you want, and get nutriment from them.\n\nFermentation Barrel\n\nYou can craft wooden barrels with the crafting menu (under tribal)( or by using planks in hand), which requires 8 wood planks . Clicking it will toggle it between open and closed. When open you can insert plants or liquid. When closed you can draw liquid by using a container on it.\n\nInserting a plant into the barrel will ferment the plant after a few seconds (even if not closing it). This will grind the plant, adding all the plant's contained reagents to the barrel. But it can also add an additional reagent depending on plant used. Most plants will create a special wine with varied boozepower depending on plant used. Some plants will create other reagents than wine, and some plants will not work at all.\n\nOther ways to get fertilizers\n\nChemistry exploded too busy to help you out?\n\nBad idea: Steal a chem dispenser. This will start a blood feud and is one of the biggest reasons why botanists are hated by some chemists. Think of it as someone stealing half your plant trays.\n\nBetter: Grab the spare chem dispenser board from tech storage. The AI, silicons and all members of the Engineering department can let you in.\n\nLater: Ask Medbay to print you a spare chem dispenser board. After very basic research (Chemical Synthesis), the medical protolathe is able to print chem dispenser boards.\n\nFor stock parts: Print them from a public autolathe (if such has been built) or ask RnD/Engineering for a part replacer with stock parts.\n\nFor stock parts you can also disassemble a hydroponics tray and a cell charger. A cell can then be found or gotten from disassembling a cyborg recharger.\n\nThe Toiletbong (Getting high with style)\n\nAre your personal high standards keeping you from enjoying a fine smoke? Fear not, for you will no longer have to use rolling paper like an animal. The toiletbong can be crafted with a flamethrower, a wrench and a toilet.\n\nRefer to the Toiletbong Construction Guide for more information on how to build it.\n\nFill the toiletbong with produce or food of your choice and turn those items into smoke, one at a time.\n\nThere is a 5% chance of something coming up the pipes. Is it good, is it bad? Depends on you.\n\nThe smoke radius is always 1 (or 2) and cannot be increased further.\n\nSince the toiletbong is literally a flamethrower attached to a toilet, it will definitely ignite plasma in the air during usage, just like any other heat source.\n\nDeconstructing the toiletbong will always yield a flamethrower with an empty plasma tank. This is due to balancing reasons you being high while deconstructing it. Engineers may give out toiletbongs freely without having to worry about assistants running around with flamethrowers shortly after.\n\nThe toiletbong can be emagged for the following two effects:\n\nThe smoke radius is increased from 1 to 2\n\nInstead of smoking one item at a time, all held items are turned into smoke at once. (Your victim might overdose)\n\nThings You Can Make Out of Your Plants\n\nAdd some cable to a potato to make a potato battery. It starts completely charged, and capacity depends on its potency (x20) and the Electrical Activity trait (additional x20 if present).\n\nThe maximum capacity is that of Bluespace cells—40,000\n\nBeware: If the potato has plasma in it, the resulting cell will be likely to explode on use.\n\nGlowberries and glowshrooms, as the name suggests, glow.\n\nYou can carve a pumpkin with a hatchet. Carved pumpkins can be worn and you can toggle them to emit a weak light.\n\nYou can make a cob-pipe out of a corn cob.\n\nYou can carve a carrot with a hatchet to make a shiv. It's not very strong but it's good at slicing things. If the carrot is big enough, there's a small chance that it will turn into a carrot sword instead. Unlike the carrot shiv, carrot sword is really strong (19 brute damage with some armor penetration and small block chance), but is quite rare even at 100 potency.\n\nFlowers and ambrosia can be worn on your head.\n\nAdd dried ambrosia, wheat, tea aspera tips or tobacco leaves to a tower cap log to make a torch.\n\nDried ambrosia, tobacco or any mutations of those are able to be smoked from wrapping paper, found in smoking vending machines. You can also grind them and put the liquid in an e-cig.\n\nOld guides"
