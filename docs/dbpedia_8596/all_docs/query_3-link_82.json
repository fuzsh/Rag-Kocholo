        "text": "The club have now entered a period of consultation with Well Society members and Motherwell Football Club shareholders with regards to the proposed investment from Erik and Courtney Barmack, with voting scheduled to commence at the start of next month.\n\nFollowing on from our last update, we can confirm that the Heads of Terms have now been agreed between all parties and will be distributed to all Well Society members and Motherwell Football Club shareholders in the weeks prior to the vote commencing on 1st July 2024.\n\nContact details for any queries can be found below.\n\nAt this point of proceedings, a clearer timeline of the proposed investment process can be made.\n\nThis timeline is as follows:\n\nMonday 10th June\n\nStart period of consultation with option for shareholders to email questions to Club via shares@motherwellfc.co.uk. Well Society members can also contact the Well Society directly with any queries via members@thewellsociety.uk.\n\nMonday 1st July\n\nBallot Opens for Well Society members and Motherwell Football Club shareholders – 2 weeks voting period.\n\nSunday 14th July\n\nBallot Closes.\n\nA note from our Chairman Jim McMahon\n\nAs has been well documented, the club has been in discussions for a number of months with Erik Barmack, a Los Angeles based entrepreneur. These talks have centred round how Erik and his wife Courtney could make an investment in MFC and become involved in helping to run the club.\n\nThese negotiations have now advanced to the point where MFC have signed Heads of Terms (HOT) about how this would work going forward and the Board of the club are recommending that shareholders accept the offer.\n\nI set out below:-\n\nA synopsis of the HOT including the safeguards built into the agreement.\n\nA note on valuation and the rationale for this deal.\n\nA steps paper on how this would be done.\n\nA note from Erik and Courtney about their aspirations for MFC.\n\nAnd I apologise for the amount of information which is involved. This is mainly because of the nature of the deal. The bulk of corporate transactions involve an acquisition – party A buys party B – the money goes to the shareholders in B, not the underlying business. In our case all the money is going into MFC by way of yearly subscriptions for new shares in the club and that makes it much more complicated.\n\nHeads of Terms\n\n1- As you will see from Erik’s note below, he sees this as a partnership with the fans and the Well Society (WS) – one where both parties invest on a yearly basis for six years, with the Barmacks putting in £300k for the first three years and £350k for the next three.\n\n2- The WS commitment is £200k for the first three years and £250k for the next three.\n\n3- The current shareholders in MFC are WS 71% – other shareholders 29%.\n\n4- Other shareholders will have the right to subscribe for their pro rata amount each year eg if a shareholder owns 1% at present, they will be entitled to subscribe for 1% of the new shares issued. If they do that, it will reduce the amounts the WS need to subscribe and the number of shares they receive on that share issue.\n\n5- Erik and his wife will own 8% of the shares in MFC in the first year, going up by approximately 8% per annum until they reach 49% by year six.\n\n6- As outlined above, this money is going in as share capital not debt and so strengthens the balance sheet; unlike other instances in Scottish football where excessive debt has led to significant problems for the clubs involved.\n\n7- There is a buy back option for the WS up to the end of year two. If the arrangement isn’t working as envisaged, they can buy back the WS shares for £660k (two years contributions plus costs).\n\n8- As a further safeguard, 30% of any player sales above £2m will be put into a separate account and can be used to help that purchase eg Player sales have been £4m – the £600k in that account can be used to help fund the buy back.\n\n9- Other safeguards:\n\nThe club cannot take on any external debt.\n\nNo value can move to the Barmacks other than normal expenses.\n\nNo assets, ground etc, can be sold.\n\nNo change to the club name, colours, home ground can be made without the agreement of 75% of the shareholders.\n\nThe existing loan from the WS to the club remain in place until the final payment is made in six years time and at that point half of the loan is forgiven.\n\nGiven the money the WS holds at present, to meet its commitments over the next six years it needs to raise £100k per annum – 60% of what it currently achieves.\n\n10- The Executive Board will be eight in total. The club’s existing CEO and FD remain in post. An additional three directors each will be nominated by the WS and the Barmacks. If tied at 4-4 on any matter the Chair (Erik) has the deciding vote.\n\n11- The new money will be very helpful in underpinning our budget and allowing additional income from cup runs and player sales to be invested on a longer-term basis; but is not in itself transformational. What could be is the access to other income sources, new fans, media connections and commercial opportunities that Erik and Courtney are looking to bring.\n\n12- What we have looked to do is agree a deal which opens up fresh opportunities without risking the future of the club. For the next six years the club is a “locked box“. All the additional value generated stays within the club.\n\nWhich is why the MFC Board recommends the transaction.\n\nValuation and reasons for the deal\n\nOne of the key questions for shareholders is whether the transaction values the club fairly. The amounts being subscribed by the Barmacks – £1.95m – prices the equity in the club at just under £4m – with the addition of the debt of £3.7m (WS and Government) that equates to an Enterprise Value (EV) of £7.7m for the whole club.\n\nThere are three main ways to value a business.\n\nNet assets – the club does have net assets – but to realise these would mean selling the ground – work we have done in looking at a new stadium has estimated a cost of £40m – net assets is only a valid basis to look at the deal if the assets can be sold. Ours can’t be.\n\nA multiple of sales/turnover – commonly used for hi tech or software companies who have yet to reach profitability – again not relevant.\n\nA multiple of maintainable profits – this can be profit, profit before tax or EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation- sometimes referred to as a measure of the free cash flow a business generates).\n\nWe have operated at around breakeven over the period since we moved into fan ownership.\n\nThere is no standard multiple for businesses – especially football clubs – there generally is a range – eg pubs might go at 5/8 times profits.\n\nBut to get to £7.7m EV for MFC would require something like stable EBITDA of £1m and a multiple of 8.\n\nRationale\n\nWe will now have been in the top division for 40 years, have managed to “balance the books” under fan ownership, improve the ground, training facilities and extend contracts for players who could have significant sell on value. So why think about changing the model?\n\nTwo reasons.\n\nWe have always seen the WS money as an insurance policy against a major downturn in our finances – relegation would cost us approximately £3.5m and we have had to live with that possibility in the last two seasons. The rainy day money is a static strategy. Is it better to contribute regular annual amounts which can be fed into our budget? Does that make it less likely we will get dragged into relegation? The answer is probably yes, so that is something we need to consider and this transaction provides that opportunity.\n\nAnd secondly, and aligned to that, because it’s the main duty of the Board to look at ways to safeguard the future of the club. Lots of good work is being done to try and increase membership, income from events etc but will that bring in sufficient revenue to protect us totally or even make a significant contribution to our cost base?\n\nWill it allow us to compete and remain in the top level? Or do we need to do more? That is the ultimate question fans and shareholders need to consider.\n\nThis deal offers-\n\nFan ownership still embedded at the heart of the club.\n\nNew worlds to explore.\n\nAnd two safety nets. Buy back plus no value leaving the club for at least six years.\n\nWhich is why we are recommending it unanimously as a Board.\n\nSteps paper\n\nTo accept this deal 75% of our shareholders, have to vote in favour.\n\nThe WS owns 71% of these shares. If more than 50% of the votes cast by the WS members is in favour that translates to a 71% acceptance.\n\nIf more than 50% of the votes cast are against, the transaction cannot take place.\n\nGiven the significance of what we are proposing it is important to give shareholders and supporters time to consider it and ask questions about any aspects which are unclear.\n\nWe are therefore building in a twenty-one-day period to do that – which we think is sensible in the circumstances, then a further 14 days for voting which should allow the club to factor the new money into next season’s plans, if the deal is accepted in that timeframe.\n\nThe WS will consult its members separately. The club will write to other shareholders asking them to vote. After the consultation period of 21 days, voting for WS members and MFC shareholders will commence on 1st July 2024 and everyone will have a further two weeks to administer their vote which will close on 14th July 2024.\n\nIf there is a 75% + acceptance, we will then instruct our lawyers to draw up the relevant papers (Shareholders Agreement – Subscription Agreement – New Articles) for a General Meeting to formalise the transaction.\n\nJim McMahon\n\nA note from the Barmacks\n\nSubject: Proposal for Strategic Partnership with Motherwell FC\n\nDear Members of the Well Society, MFC Shareholders, and Fans of MFC,\n\nI recently had the pleasure of meeting so many of you in person, hearing your inspiring stories, exploring the town of Motherwell, and witnessing firsthand the vibrant atmosphere at Fir Park. Thank you for your time and sharing your Motherwell passion with me. I appreciate now more than ever what makes Motherwell so special.\n\nMy wife, Courtney and I deeply respect Motherwell FC’s culture and identity, especially its fan ownership, which is a vital part of the club’s DNA. Our aim is to complement, not control, the Well Society’s shareholding and support its core mission.\n\nWe are incredibly excited about the possibility of joining forces with all of you to enrich this foundation with new resources and innovative ideas, propelling the Steelmen forward while preserving its cherished traditions. We are committed to a long-term partnership that focuses on sustainable growth without imposing financial burdens.\n\nBelow are a few more details about our proposed investment and involvement in Motherwell FC:\n\nCapital Investment: We propose a sustained investment strategy to build long-term value for Motherwell FC, focusing on enhancing the club’s infrastructure and long-term strategic projects rather than short-term player acquisitions.\n\nMedia and Broadcasting: With our background in international film and television production, we see significant opportunities to boost MFC’s global visibility. A broadcaster recently approached us about a docuseries on the club that could open considerable commercial opportunities.\n\nTechnology and Innovation: Leveraging our extensive experience in Tech Ops & Strategy and media rights negotiations, we aim to drive MFC into new frontiers in AI and social media. This includes optimizing MFC’s engagement and innovation in digital realms.\n\nAdditional Investors: We see opportunities to bring in additional investors (which would dilute our share of the club, not yours) who can help raise MFC’s profile internationally, enhancing the club’s stature on a global stage.\n\nGlobal Football Networks: Our connections with club owners across premier leagues provide us an opportunity to extend MFC’s network internationally, supporting the club’s long-term strategic goals.\n\nEngagement and Transparency: We propose creating forums to ensure ongoing dialogue with you, allowing us to align our initiatives with the community’s needs and aspirations.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you and hope to meet soon to discuss this exciting opportunity.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nErik and Courtney Barmack\n\nIf you have any questions about this transaction, please contact the club at shares@motherwellfc.co.uk and we will respond quickly. Alternatively, WS members can also contact the Well Society directly with any queries via members@thewellsociety.uk.\n\nWe take a trip down memory lane as we revisit some players who have worn the claret and amber between the sticks.\n\nLuke Daniels\n\nA product of the Manchester United youth academy, Luke Daniels made the switch to West Brom in 2004.\n\nHe arrived at Fir Park on loan for the second half of the 2007/08 season. At the time, Graeme Smith was the number one choice keeper, so Daniels had to spend most of time in North Lanarkshire on the bench.\n\nHowever, his chance came in May when Celtic visited Fir Park and Daniels was handed his debut between the sticks. Celtic came away with a narrow 2-1 win that day, but Daniels would get the nod in the final game of the season against Hibernian at Easter Road. Keeping a clean sheet, the Steelmen came away with a 2-0 win that day.\n\nHe returned to West Brom, and remained on the books there for ten years. He may have only made three appearances for the Baggies in that ten years, but Daniels would go out on loan on a number of occasions.\n\nLoan spells with Shrewsbury Town, Tranmere Rovers, Charlton Athletic, Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southend United would see the shot stopper gain plenty first-team experience before he left West Brom in 2015.\n\nHe would go on to make over 100 appearances for Scunthorpe before joining Brentford and and Middlesborough. Daniels was most recently with Forest Green Rovers and has now become a free agent this summer.\n\nWith 148 appearances in League one, over 25 in the Championship and even one Premier League appearance thanks to an injury to number one West Brom keeper Ben Foster, Daniels has gone on to have a fruitful career in the game and become a reliable keeper for a number of teams.\n\nJohn Ruddy\n\nHe came through the ranks at Cambridge United and earned the name “Iceman”, John Ruddy was impressing under difficult circumstances.\n\nAfter making his debut in 2004, Ruddy became first choice at the U’s and despite them getting relegated, he kept a number of clean sheets and conceded only 45 goals in the league.\n\nHaving went on trial with Manchester United, Everton came calling and secured his signature. Manager David Moyes was seriously impressed with his displays in training and touted him as the next big thing.\n\nRuddy went out on loan to Walsall, Rushden & Diamonds, Chester City, Stockport County, Wrexham, Bristol City, Stockport County and Crewe Alexandra.\n\nAt the start of the 2009/10 season, Jim Gannon signed Ruddy on a six-month loan from Everton. He went into direct competition with Michael Fraser and Sebastian Kosiorowski for a place in goal.\n\nGannon, under his second spell with Ruddy, trusted him with the number one jersey and was placed in goals against Romania outfit Steaua București, saving a penalty in the first-leg.\n\nThe hype was building around Ruddy as he kept clean sheets against both Celtic and Rangers, also saving a Barry Robson penalty in the December.\n\nWith Ruddy flying and both clubs keen, it was agreed Ruddy would remain in Lanarkshire until the end of the season. 39 games and 15 clean sheets later, Ruddy’s time in ML1 drew to a close but not after Motherwell secured more European football and Ruddy claiming the player of the year award.\n\nFollowing his loan spell with Motherwell, he earned a move to the English Championship with Norwich City on a permanent deal. Making 242 appearances across a seven year spell, he featured in the Premier League and even had the captain’s armband on one occasion.\n\nDuring his spell at Carrow Road, Roy Hodgson would name Ruddy in his England squad ahead of Euro 2012. He missed the tournament through injury but made his England debut in August 2012 in a friendly against Italy.\n\nHis next move would be to Wolves in 2017, where he earned promotion to the Premier League as champions in his first season. His performances earned him a place in the PFA Team of the Year and was awarded the EFL’s Golden Glove Award for the most clean sheets with 24.\n\nHe moved onto Birmingham City in 2022, where it was expected he would be the number two. That didn’t prove to be the case as Ruddy has went on to play 89 times for City and was even voted players’ player of the year for the 2022/23 season.\n\nRuddy’s contract at Birmingham has expired after their relegation to League One, however he has been offered a new deal as they look to bounce straight back to the Championship next season.\n\nDarren Randolph\n\nDarren Randolph arrived in England in 2004 to sign for Charlton Athletic. That would be the beginning for a six-year relationship with the London outfit, where he spent time on loan with Welling United, Accrington Stanley, Gillingham, Bury and Hereford United.\n\nEach loan had varying successes but one of the highest points of Randolph’s early career was making his Premier League debut against Liverpool for Charlton in 2007.\n\nHe made 20 appearances for Charlton, keeping six clean sheets in those matches.\n\nIn the summer of 2010 with his contract expired, Charlton offered Randolph a new contract however he opted to make the switch to Fir Park.\n\nHe signed a three-year deal and with fan favourite John Ruddy vacated the number one jersey, had big gloves to fill. Craig Brown handed him his debut in the Europa League against Breiðablik, where Motherwell progressed to the next round.\n\nIn that first season, he ended up breaking John Ruddy’s record of 15 clean sheets in a season, finished third in the league and reached the Scottish Cup final.\n\nHis second season in claret and amber would also prove to be a success. Motherwell would finish second in the table, qualifying for the Champions League, with Randolph continuing to be a pivotal part in the club’s success. He was named in the PFA Scotland’s team of the year.\n\nEntering the final year of his contract, he played in the Champions League and Europa League ties against Panathinaikos and Levante. His consistency and impressive shot stopping ability, seen him earn his first cap for Ireland against Oman on the 11 September 2012.\n\nThis didn’t distract the number one and he went on to be named in the PFA Scotland’s team of the year again, alongside Shaun Hutchinson, Michael Higdon and Nicky Law, as the team finished second place.\n\nAfter a successful three-year spell, manager Stuart McCall made it clear it would difficult to retain Randolph at the of his contract, which proved to be the case. He departed for the English Championship with Birmingham City. He remained at St Andrews for two seasons, making just shy of 100 appearances in that time, missing very little matches before moving onto West Ham where he would go onto make a number of Premier League appearances, and even signed a four-year deal in that time.\n\nHe moved for a report £5 million to Middlesbrough, where he made it into the 2018–19 Championship Team of the Season thanks to his displays.\n\nA reported £4 million move back to London seen him return to West Ham, and although he stayed for three years, game time was limited and he played only five league matches in that time.\n\nIn 2023, he joined Bournemouth where he didn’t make an appearance and it was announced this summer that he would depart the Cherries.\n\nWith 50 Ireland caps to his name, including being part of the Irish squad that went on an incredible run at Euro 2016 playing Sweden, Belgium, Italy and France, Randolph has 199 Championship appearances, alongside 34 Premier League. He has reached the top of the English leagues and left Motherwell fans with a number of memories in his three impressive years at Fir Park.\n\nGunnar Nielson\n\nHaving began his career in the Faroe Islands and Denmark, Blackburn Rovers signed Gunnar Nielson in 2007. It was after one year that Motherwell drummed up their interest in the Faroese stopper and brought him to North Lanarkshire on a six month loan in 2008.\n\nThat initial loan spell amounted to nothing and he would go back to Blackburn at the end of the season. Mark Hughes, who signed him at Rovers, brought him to Manchester City in 2009.\n\nHe would be loaned out to Wrexham and Tranmere Rovers and ended up making his Premier League debut in 2010, replacing Shay Given against Arsenal. It was a bit of international history as he was the first Faroese footballer to play in the Premier League.\n\nEventually leaving city in 2012, Neilson would move to Denmark with Silkeborg. It was April by the time he arrived there Motherwell, under the influence of Gordon Marshall, brought Neilson back to Fir Park for a second spell.\n\nIt was a straight shootout between Nielson and Lee Hollis for the jersey and injury to Hollis meant the Faroese got his chance. His debut came against Kuban Krasnodar in the Europa League over in Russia, where Kuban won 1-0.\n\nHe then had a run of games between the sticks, and went on to make 23 appearances for the club during the 2013/14 season, as Motherwell finished runners up in the Scottish Premiership. He helped his side claim a point against Celtic at Fir Park when he saved a Kris Commons penalty.\n\nHis second season in claret and amber would see him remain on the bench mostly and he moved onto Iceland with Stjarnan 2015, the team who ironically knocked the ‘Well out of Europe earlier that same season. After 22 games there, he moved to Icelandic champions Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar where he played until 2023.\n\nThe 37-year-old played 168 times there and seemingly hung up the gloves last season. Capped 70 times for his country and becoming captain in 2016, Nielson was the number one stopper for his nation and picked up two club trophies in his career.\n\nConnor Ripley\n\nConnor Ripley was with Blackburn Rovers as a youngster before switching to Middlesbrough in 2009. It was Gordon Strachan who brought him to Teeside but it would be Tony Mowbray who would give him his first chance in the senior team.\n\nHe stayed at the Boro for eight years but as has been the trend in this piece, he went out on loan for most of that time. With some successful loans and others not so successful, and having played under Graham Potter in Sweden, Motherwell would come calling in July 2015.\n\nSigned on a season-long loan, he started between the sticks on the opening day trip to Inverness. That would the first of 40 appearances for the club that season, which had some memorable moments including a win over Celtic at Parkhead.\n\nHis strong performances kept Craig Samson and Dan Twardzik out the picture and overall, he returned South a better player.\n\nHe joined Oldham under Steven Robinson and Ian Baraclough following his time in ML1 and continued to impress as he won the player of the year award there.\n\nBurton Albion, Bury and Accrington Stanley would follow next for Ripley on loan before he moved on from Middlesbrough permanently to join Preston North End under Alex Neil on a three-year-deal. Three years and only ten appearances, he moved to Morecambe in 2022 where Derek Adams named him captain.\n\nHe once again won a player of the year award however Morecambe’s relegation meant he moved on at in 2023. His current team is Port Vale and although they were relegated to League Two, he was a standout performer for Darren Moore’s side. It looks to be the case that he will stay at the Vale for 24/25.\n\nAnother player who got his first run of consistent games, Ripley’s career has been steady since his departure from Fir Park and with him only being 31, there’s plenty left in the tank for the shot stopper.\n\nGeorge Long\n\nBorn and raised in Sheffield, George Long became Sheffield United’s youngest goalkeeper at 17 years old when he made his debut in 2011.\n\nAfter impressing in the Youth team, he signed a long term deal in 2012 that seen him commit until 2016. Although the plan was for him to be second choice, injuries meant Long became a regular for the Blades.\n\nA change in manager’s seen plans change at Sheffield United and Long would spend time out on loan. In February, deadline day, Long was recruited by Ian Baraclough.\n\nWith 15 appearances and three clean sheets between then and the end of the season, Long steadied the ship between the sticks in what was a tricky year for the Steelmen. He was strong and commanding overall and impressed in the relegation playoff victory over Rangers at the end of the season to keep the ‘Well in the top flight.\n\nHe returned to Sheffield and under new manager Nigel Atkins, was named first choice. However, Mark Howard would earn the jersey and he would become a cup keeper. However, he impressed when he played in cup games and got his position back.\n\nCome February 2016, Long had made 100 starts for his boyhood club and got a new contract under Chris Wilder. He went out on loan again and decided the time was right to move on after seven years as a professional at the club.\n\nHull City would be his next destination in the Championship where he enjoyed regular game time. In three years, he amassed 65 games for the club and is moved on Millwall in 2021.\n\nHe is currently playing with Norwich, where he made 12 appearances last season, all of which came in October and November. At present, it looks like he will remain with the Canaries as they push for promotion back to the Premier League next season.\n\nHis stint may have been shorter at the club, but his saves at Ibrox in the relegation playoff win will be remembered in what was a game of the highest importance."
