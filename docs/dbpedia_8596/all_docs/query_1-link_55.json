        "text": "Everton have been hit with an immediate 10-point deduction for breaching the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nThe news means the club will drop into the relegation zone - level on points with bottom-placed Burnley - with immediate effect, as their points tally goes from 14 to 4.\n\nThe findings were delivered by an independent Commission, which met in October.\n\nTransfers\n\nMan City target £68m Eze, PSG in talks to sign Man Utd's Sancho – Paper Round\n\n23/07/2024 at 07:58\n\nIn a statement, the Premier League said: \"An independent commission has imposed an immediate deduction of 10 points on Everton FC for a breach of the Premier League’s Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSRs).\n\n\"The Premier League issued a complaint against the club and referred the case to an independent commission earlier this year. During the proceedings, the club admitted it was in breach of the PSRs for the period ending Season 2021/22 but the extent of the breach remained in dispute.\n\n\"Following a five-day hearing last month, the commission determined that Everton FC’s PSR Calculation for the relevant period resulted in a loss of £124.5 million, as contended by the Premier League, which exceeded the threshold of £105 million permitted under the PSRs. The commission concluded that a sporting sanction in the form of a 10-point deduction should be imposed. That sanction has immediate effect.\"\n\nIn response, an Everton statement read: \"Everton Football Club is both shocked and disappointed by the ruling of the Premier League’s commission.\n\n\"The club believes that the commission has imposed a wholly disproportionate and unjust sporting sanction. The club has already communicated its intention to appeal the decision to the Premier League. The appeal process will now commence and the club’s case will be heard by an Appeal Board appointed pursuant to the Premier League’s rules in due course.\n\n\"Everton maintains that it has been open and transparent in the information it has provided to the Premier League and that it has always respected the integrity of the process. The club does not recognise the finding that it failed to act with the utmost good faith and it does not understand this to have been an allegation made by the Premier League during the course of proceedings.\n\n\"Both the harshness and severity of the sanction imposed by the commission are neither a fair nor a reasonable reflection of the evidence submitted.\n\n\"The club will also monitor with great interest the decisions made in any other cases concerning the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules.\n\n\"Everton cannot comment on this matter any further until the appeal process has concluded.\"\n\nThe points penalty is the largest ever issued in the Premier League's history, and only the third to be handed out after those given to Middlesbrough in the 1996/97 season and Portsmouth in the 2009/10 campaign.\n\n- - -\n\nTNT Sports presents the premium live sports rights previously carried by BT Sport including the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Conference League, Gallagher Premiership Rugby, Investec Champions Cup, EPCR Challenge Cup, MotoGP, Cricket, UFC, Boxing and WWE.
