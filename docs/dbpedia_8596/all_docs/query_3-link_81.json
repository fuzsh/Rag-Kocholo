paywall is down now, so just taking the chance to capture one of their articles:\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/f...e-alternative-team-of-the-season-2009-10.html\n\nThe PFA's selection of Joe Hart in goal, Branislav Ivanovic, Thomas Vermaelen, Richard Dunne and Patrice Evra in defence, Fabregas, James Milner, Darren Fletcher and Antonio Valencia in midfield, and Rooney and Drogba up front is undoubtedly a fine team.\n\nBut a number of players from less fashionable clubs have also excelled this season, without achieving the recognition they deserve from the PFA. Here is your chance to nominate an alternative team.\n\nGoalkeeper: It has been a good season for Premier League shotstoppers (apart from at Arsenal), with a host of contenders vying for the number one spot. Thomas Sorensen has been inspired at Stoke, Craig Gordon has finally started to live up to his £9 million price tag at Sunderland, and Tottenham's Heurelho Gomes has put his early problems behind him to emerge as one of the finest keepers in the land. Brad Friedel has once again been consistently superb, while Shay Given and Paul Robinson have impressed: who gets your vote?\n\nDefenders: England contenders Leighton Baines and Stephen Warnock suddenly found themselves under the spotlight this season when Ashley Cole broke his foot, but that was a mark of how well they have played for their respective clubs. Similarly, Tottenham's Michael Dawson could make a late burst for Fabio Capello's World Cup squad after an excellent campaign, while Birmingham defenders Liam Ridgewell, Roger Johnson and Scott Dann have all excelled for Alex McLeish's side. Wolves centre-back Jody Craddock has been another notable performer, along with the likes of Blackburn's Christopher Samba and Aston Villa's James Collins.\n\nMidfielders: The omission of Chelsea's Florent Malouda from the official PFA Team of the Year certainly raised some eyebrows, while Gareth Bale's recent run of form has propelled him into the headlines on a consistent basis. Alex Song has added some much-needed muscle to a previously flimsy Arsenal midfield, while the under-rated Steven Pienaar has once again enjoyed a wonderful campaign at Everton. And what about Ashley Young has continued to impress at Aston Villa, Matthew Etherington at Stoke and Damien Duff at Fulham? Do they make your alternative team? Have Lee Bowyer or Charles N'Zogbia done enough to be included?\n\nForwards: Bobby Zamora can count himself unlucky to have come up against opponents of the class of Rooney and Drogba for his place in the official Team of the Year, but he is surely a certainty for the alternative side. Carlos Tevez has been magnificent for Manchester City, while Darren Bent has been an inspired signing for Sunderland. Which forwards deserve more recognition?\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/f...-Leagues-most-improved-player-of-2009-10.html\n\nRooney’s outstanding season for Manchester United has overshadowed some terrific performances at rival clubs. Here is Telegraph Sport's choice for the 10 most-improved players in this season’s Premier League.\n\nLeighton Baines (Everton)\n\nEverton’s left-back has been one of the club’s most consistent performers this season, producing a string of impressive displays leaving him well worth his England call-up after 16 appearances for his country’s Under-21s. With Ashley Cole injured and Wayne Bridge withdrawing from international football, the left-back slot was available and he did not disappoint against Egypt, taking the opportunity well and impressing Fabio Capello in the full 90 minutes.\n\nGareth Bale (Tottenham)\n\nHarry Redknapp cannot believe his luck. Benoit Assou-Ekotto was his first-choice at left-back and the Spurs manager waxed lyrical about the Cameroon international’s performances. But an injury meant that Bale, more used to operating on the left side of midfield, was thrust into defence – and he did not disappoint. And yet when Assou-Ekotto returned from injury, Bale took advantage to injuries, mainly to Aaron Lennon, and remains one of the first names on Redknapp’s list. Great news for Spurs and, also, for Wales, who have lost Aaron Ramsey for the foreseeable future and need a player of Bale’s capabilities.\n\nDarren Bent (Sunderland)\n\nSurely the time will come when Fabio Capello recognises Bent’s remarkable achievements at the Stadium of Light this season. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp saw fit to allow the former Ipswich and Charlton striker to leave, for a £10 million fee that will eventually rise to £16m. But it is looking like money well spent and Bent must have relished his two goals against Spurs – even though he also missed two penalties – against Redknapp, whose jibe about “my missus could have scored” when Bent missed against Portsmouth last season, coming back to haunt him. His 23 goals represent his best ever scoring season so far and England could beckon.\n\nDidier Drogba (Chelsea)\n\nIt’s easy to take Drogba’s goals for granted but the records confirm his massive improvement this season. On Saturday, at Old Trafford, he scored the winner to take his tally for the campaign to 31 goals, including 25 in just 27 appearances in the Premier League – and that is more than in his previous two seasons combined. Last season he managed just 14, with 15 in the 2007-08 campaign. Three more goals will give him his best ever return (he got 33 in 2006-07), and then he flies the Ivory Coast flag at the World Cup. Perhaps that has been the spur.\n\nJoe Hart (Birmingham City)\n\nIt is, perhaps, no surprise that Birmingham’s hugely impressive return to the Premier League has coincided with goalkeeper Hart’s arrival at St Andrew's. He is on loan from Manchester City, having lost his place to Shay Given, and fears a return to the City bench next season. Hart has not played for City since the arrival of Given but was allowed to help Birmingham in their return to the Premier League and was important in guiding the club to a 12-match unbeaten run, the club’s best sequence since 1908. He is brave and athletic, with room to improve further, and could be Fabio Capello’s third choice goalkeeper.\n\nLucas Leiva (Liverpool)\n\nNot the best season for Liverpool, while Lucas has not always been the most popular player on Merseyside. But even his most ardent detractors cannot deny that the Brazilian midfielder has improved vastly this season. The feeling remains that there is more to come, but Rafael Benitez remains a great fan and continues to select him.\n\nJames Milner (Aston Villa)\n\nFabio Capello has already identified Milner as the “most improved” England player this season. The Villa player has been instrumental in helping Villa push for a European spot and the England manager, when asked which players caught his eye, Capello had no hesitation in singling out Milner, saying: “Last season Theo Walcott was a surprise to us, he came in and was very important in crucial qualifying games. This year our most improved player is Milner. He played with us three or four times and he will be part of the squad.”\n\nRyan Shawcross (Stoke City)\n\nShawcross’ season will be best remembered for the regrettable incident when he broke the leg of Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey. But his performances have been outstanding, with the one-time Manchester United defender producing a succession of outstanding performances. He never played for United but after a loan spell at Stoke, he joined full-time. Ironically, he earned an England call-up the day of the incident involving Ramsey. With Rio Ferdinand and Gary Cahill unavailable against Egypt Shawcross got the call. Though he was an unused substitute, he remains in Fabio Capello’s mind.\n\nAlex Song (Arsenal)\n\nJust how much Song has improved could be gauged by how much Arsenal missed him when he was on duty at the African Cup of Nations in January. Equally at home in midfield or the centre of defence, Song is still only 22 but his strength and passing have been influential in helping Arsenal to maintain an interest in the Premier League race. Indeed, Arsenal’s continuing injury problems would have been felt much more but for the burgeoning talents of Song. Even his manager admitted recently that Song was Arsenal’s most improved player, admitting he had “real quality”.\n\nBobby Zamora (Fulham)\n\nJust a couple of corner kicks away from Drogba, at Craven Cottage, Bobby Zamora has hit back at his critics, including Fulham fans, to inspire a remarkable season down by the River Thames. It could have been so different for Zamora; in the summer his manager Roy Hodgson gave the former Spurs and West Ham striker permission to speak to Hull but he decided to stay and it has proved to be the best decision of the season. Andrew Johnson’s injury has helped; now he is the main striker and has responded with 18 goals – more than his previous three seasons combined.\n\nAsamoah Gyan (Rennes and Ghana) is missing due to the CAN that happened in the middle of the season. His 13 goals tally in the league can look thin compared to the numbers of Doumbia but Doumbia was playing in the Swiss league. Gyan was sensational enough during that season league (Doumbia was not selected for Ivory Coast, but there was some concurrency with more experienced players. Doumbia scored that goal against Germany in November 2009 coming from the bench at the 83rd minute).\n\nThen, runner-up + ToT at the CAN, Q/F's with 3 goals at the WC. Although it doesn't count in that precise exercise it was well his year so it has the effect of making him overlooked imo.\n\nHe'd score at Wembley only in march 2011 but he has no less than 9 international goals in 2009-2010 when pushing it to the month of June (3 at the CAN in january, including a winner over Nigeria in the SF's in a 1-0 win, the same right before against Angola, 1-0 loss in the Final... that was all 1-0/ 0-1... 3 at the World Cup, 2 decisive pk's in the first round with high work rate, the winner over the USA in the R16... high individual ratings there after a very good and remarked season.\n\nIt was sure he would not stay long at Rennes before the WC already, then he left only in August surely because he had more offers to study. The whole thing earned him a ticket to the PL.\n\nAs for comparison, Doumbia moved to Russia.\n\nBefore Rennes, Gyan has had an experience in Italy. In the meantime, Doumbia (2 years younger than the Ghanaian) was playing in Japan. After that, since around 2011, Gyan faded away while Doumbia scored some \"highlight goals\" in the CL against PL clubs with CSKA Moscow from 2013 to 2016 and scored 20 goals over a league season again in 2016-2017 once back in Switzerland after inconclusive experiences at Roma and Newcastle. Doumbia also has only one career goal in tournaments (CAN 2015). While Gyan has at least one 25/ 8 at Udinese and one 31/ 10 at Sunderland and way more tournaments goals with 6 at the WC (probably there was more concurrency at Roma and N'castle too).\n\nThat's to say that the feeling is that it is \"now or never\" for Gyan, and more \"never or never\" for Doumbia, perhaps (because that's a bit what I was saying, also). In comparison. Opinion."
