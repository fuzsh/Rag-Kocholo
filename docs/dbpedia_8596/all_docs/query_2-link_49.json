        "text": "There is cloud hanging over Manchester City with the Premier League champions accused of 115 alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side were charged by the Premier League over a year ago in February 2023 but fans have been left confused over their lack of punishment.\n\nThat has been compounded by the fact that the Premier League has already punished Everton and Nottingham Forest for lesser offences.\n\nClubs in England’s top-flight previously voted to fast-track independent commissions for teams accused of overspending.\n\nThat was to ensure any potential punishment would be as close as possible to any breach, hence why Everton and Forest have already been punished over breaking Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).\n\nBut the Premier League say the City case is different – according to The Telegraph – because of the depth, scale and complexity of the 115 charges against them.\n\nEverton had just one charge against them when they were first hit with a 10-point deduction – which eventually dropped to six – explaining why the Premier League was able to deal with their case so quickly in comparison to City.\n\nWhat are the 115 charges against Man City?\n\nManchester City were charged with breaking financial rules over a nine-year period from 2009 to 2018.\n\nThey allegedly didn’t provide accurate financial information and the Premier League referred the case to an independent commission.\n\nCity have always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhy have Man City not faced punishment?\n\nLogistically, the City case is a lot more time-consuming and it will take far longer to reach a punishment verdict, the Premier League have argued.\n\nEverton are unhappy with that explanation and believe they opened themselves up to a speedier punishment by cooperating with the Premier League.\n\nLast month, Premier League CEO Richard Masters confirmed that City were set for their hearing in the ‘near future’.\n\n‘We can’t comment on the case, the date is set,’ Masters said. ‘The case will resolve itself at some point in the near future. I can’t make any further comment on it.’\n\nWhat type of punishment could Man City face?\n\nJamie Carragher suggested back in October that City could find themselves relegated all the way down to the National League North – the sixth-tier of English football – if they are eventually punished.\n\n‘The PL (Premier League) want a 12 point deduction for Everton for one charge,’ Carragher posted on X.\n\n‘Man City are going to end up in the National League North if the PL get their way!\n\n‘Unbelievable the amount of stories that come out about Everton’s situation, but Man City’s, which has 114 more charges [and] has gone on for much longer, has gone very quiet.’\n\n‘One rule for one and one rule for the other’\n\n‘Just like everyone else, we are all wondering what makes one rule for one and one rule for the other,’ Everton boss Sean Dyche said in February. ‘I think that’s the only thing. I don’t know the ins and outs for every reason, but I think we are all asking that. The people in the street are asking: ‘Why is it particularly Everton?’\n\n‘I don’t know what the exact number is, but they reference over 100 charges for City. I don’t know the implications of that either. I don’t know the details of the charges but you go: ‘Well, we have one.’\n\n‘You just go with common sense, I’m not talking about the rules. I’m not questioning Man City or whether they’ve done stuff or not done stuff. The point is it is certainly a long time. That story has been going round for a while now about all these charges.\n\n‘I think you’ll agree that it is not just from Evertonians. I know football people. I live in Nottingham, I know Forest fans, and when I’m travelling around I stop at services and there’s always football fans and they go: ‘What’s that all about?’\n\n‘Not just Evertonians but people are going: ‘Where does that come from?’ If they’re asking it, they’re usually saying the same thing which is, ‘How come it is you then and not so and so?’\n\n‘So everyone is a bit like, ‘Come on then, where is it going?’ – if you’re going to do it with them then you have to start doing it with everyone and you’re going to have to fast track everything because it is relevant now. We will see.’\n\nMORE : Son Heung-min breaks silence on the miss that could cost Arsenal the Premier League title\n\nMORE : Why Bayern Munich decided against a move for Erik ten Hag in favour of keeping Thomas Tuchel"
